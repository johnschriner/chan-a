Way too busy.</br>  <br>Looks amazing. Can't wait.</br>  <br>Dark flame master?</br>  <br><br>Too many girls + 1 guy<br><br>Looks like haremshit</br></br></br></br>  <br> two girls is too many <br><br>I can't deal with retards</br></br></br>   Superhero shit. <br>Oh give me a break.<br><br> Run for half a year. <br>Jesus WHAT.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are 2-cour anime a strange alien thing to you?</br>  <br> apotheosis <br>I love japs and their ways.</br></br>  <br>Oh joy a story from the writer who gave us Conqueror of Shamballa. Thanks Bones.</br>  <br>They also gave us UN-GO. You didn't watch it, but it was good.</br>  <br>I did watch UN-GO actually and yes it was good. Honestly Aikawa Shou has a really weird talent of doing some fantastic things like Neo Ranga, Juuni Kokuki etc. Yet then giving us something like Eureka Seven AO.</br>  <br> superhero anime <br>Seriously bones.</br></br>  <br> Tokyo is flooded with countless heroes — chōjin — during the time of "apotheosis." Their origin stories are all different. While some were altered by evil organizations, others cames from space. While some came from magical worlds, others came into being as fairies from ancient times. While some are robots built by scientists, still others are anachronistic robots, out of place and time. But the Japanese government could not simply close its eyes as these superheroes run rampant!! <br>Sounds like a trainwreck.  Picked up. </br></br>  <br> shit director <br> shit scriptwriter <br> superhero shit <br> keyart has an edgy self insert for tweens <br>You all know this is going to be every bit as bad as Captain Ass.<br><br><br> UNKO <br> good </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then let's hope together this is one of his great works.</br>  <br>That's not really something new to them</br>  <br>What is OPM, LeDouche ?</br>  <br>How does that sound like a trainwreck?</br>   look at the pic <br> think of Bones <br> it is Bones <br>They never died.</br></br></br>  <br> FMA <br>Thank god it's the staff from 2003.</br></br>  So how much blaming of the U.S. will be in this show?  <br>So what kind of superpowers will they have?</br>  <br> Not Academia anime </br>   Bones <br>Fucking trash</br>  How much will BONES fuck up the ending?  <br>You must be new. Japan loves superheroes.</br>  <br>it needs more chapters IMO. maybe in a year or two.</br>  I like the design of the females.  I feel like this is gonna be fun, it's gonna be nice to watch it with you all, I can't wait! <br><br>there's like 60 chapters out, give it some time, man.</br></br>  <br>But anon, that's not OPM</br>  I'm so fucking tired of superhero anime  <br>How? It's not that common of a genre.</br>  <br>How is this haremshit? Are you retarded?<br><br>Oh wait, do we got superhero anime every season?</br></br></br>  <br>If you count all the stuff where it's about teenagers with special powers and shit, it's definitely common.</br>  <br>I'd say magical girls count more as superheroes, and that's a bit of a stretch.</br>  FINALLY, I love superhero anime. Tiger and Bunny was hella good.  <br>But 2003 is a terrible mess</br>  why the fuck did a demi god lost to mere mongrel?<br>gil could have killed a high schooler with all his noble phantasms. fucking UBW asspull and shirou is suddenly an expert in close combat. fucking PLOT ARMOR</br>   suddenly an expert in close combat. <br>bait</br>  A king shouldn't deserve this kind of treatment.  <br> King of jobbers jobbing <br><br>No surprises here</br></br></br>  Gil a shit.  <br>yeah, no Gilgamesh could have slice his head in a sceond, King of heroes isn't only a title</br>  If Gil had a decent master, could GoB had countered UBW?  <br> Strongest heroic spirit <br> Jobs to Saber, Shirou and Sakura in F/SN <br> Jobs to Lancelot in Zero <br> Jobs to Gawain in Extra <br><br>Why is Gil such a shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is why a Servant needs a Master. If someone could have told him to stop being an overconfident shit, and just use his trump card at the start, he would have won.</br>  <br>because PLOT ARMOR<br>so self inserts can feel good about shirou beating him</br></br>  <br>Shirou became stronger during his fight against Archer.<br><br>I suggest you watch the 20th episode (6:05).</br></br></br>  <br> because PLOT ARMOR <br><br>It's not plot armor when literally everyone beats him. Just accept he's a shit servant.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't need a decent master, he needs to stop toying with everybody.</br>  <br>nah<br>unless he brings out ea but using ea is like a gun to a fist fight</br></br>  This thread is silly. <br><br>If he used Ea on Shirou from the start, Shirou wouldn't have stood a chance. <br><br>Even then, it took the Tohsaka Crest, Avalon, Unlimited Blade Works, and Shirou's powerleveling with Archer, and Shirou just BARELY defeated Gilgamesh. With Archer's help, too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Nasu made Gilgamesh too powerful to not balance him out with hamfisted personality flaws.</br>  <br> &gt;Jobs to Lancelot in Zero <br> &gt;Jobs to Gawain in Extra <br>Those never happen. Fate/Zero even says that Lancelot would not have been able to deal with more GoB.</br></br></br>  King of jobber can't really win against shirou<br> Ea <br>Ea takes too much time to use<br> Enkidu <br>enkidu won't work on humans also even if he did shirou could've just sword spam gil while he loads enkidu<br> jet thing <br>hrunting or calad bolg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't take too much time to use.</br>  <br>explain this</br>  <br>You know what actually does take a significant amount of time to cast? UBW.</br>  <br>Why didn't Saber ever do that shit?</br>  How much explanation do people need for an egotistical character to lose because of his ego  <br>Yeah but you only have to cast it once and then you're good for the rest of the battle. Ea needs to spin up every time.</br>  <br>He had his armor on when he fought Saber</br>  If both Shirou and Gilgamesh are not proficient at using NPs and weapons then why can he beat a heroic spirit with equal theoretical knowledge in close combat?  <br> Lancelot would not have been able to deal with more GoB <br>False. Lancelot he get out of the line of fire of GoB with his A+ agility.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't Shirou gain the knowledge associated with using the weapon when he projects it? So he can temporarily use it much better than he should be able to, this is a pretty big point brought up in the VN when he projects Caliburn and holds his own against Berserker for a while, or the same deal later the first time he projects Archer's swords.</br>  <br>this<br>you only have to say the first go<br>ddamn sentence</br></br></br>  <br>Ea only needs to spin once to obliterate Shirou long before he finishes chanting.</br>  <br>How can he withstand the pure strength physical strength of a heroic spirit? Knowing a weapon won't make you faster and stronger.</br>  <br>Yeah but that assumes Gil considers him enough of a threat to do this right from the start. His problem is that he fucked around and didn't finish him off early when he had a good chance to.</br>  <br> muh armor <br>nah saber is unable to cope with the sword spam</br></br>  <br>Plot<br>Is your first anime?</br></br>  <br>Most of a heroic spirit's strength is because of their magical energy. It's outright stated at one point in UBW that Saber is weaker than Shirou and Rin without using magic to reinforce herself. If Shirou's weapons he pulls out of UBW also lend him magical reinforcement then it's not hard to believe that he could match a Servant for a while</br>  <br>You're only good for the rest of the battle against Gil, when he lets you cast it. And that's if you put no stock in the anime, wherein he had plenty of time to actually do something.</br>  <br> Fate/Zero even says that Lancelot would not have been able to deal with more GoB <br>lol nice. And where does it say so, Gilfag?</br></br>  <br>That's the whole point though. Gil could have won at the start if he wasn't an arrogant shithead, but he threw away his easy chance because of his personality and belief that whatever Shirou did wouldn't be a threat to him anyway.<br><br>I don't think it's up for debate that Shirou would have lost if Gil had come at him full force from the beginning.</br></br></br>  <br> archer saw sword used by its wielder <br>projects it and learns how to wield it by watching wielder<br> shirou sees it <br> is that too hard for you to understand?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He used his armor and the GoB to keep her at bay. Gil isn't great shakes at melee, but he isn't absolutely terrible, either.</br>  <br>Also it was spelled that to Gil, having to use Ea and going full force against a child would be as good as losing in his mind. Hell he STILL hesitated to use Ea after saying he was going all out as Shirou was falling on him.</br>  1. Judging the concept of creation<br>2. Hypothesizing the basic structure<br>3. Duplicating the composition material<br>4. Imitating the skill of its making<br>5. Sympathizing with the experience of its growth<br>6. Reproducing the accumulated years<br>7. Excelling every manufacturing process<br><br> Reproducing the accumulated years <br><br>It's bullshit, but it's bullshit we've been told of beforehand.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy but that's what the narrator says in the F/Z Vol. 1 novel. This is the Type-Moon world, things can change all the time after all.</br>  <br>Literal magic, guy.</br>  <br> Not that guy but that's what the narrator says in the F/Z Vol. 1 novel. <br>That was easily disproved when Rider survived 80 GoB rounds soon after. Lancelot could do the same kind of result.</br></br>  <br>Muh unreliable narrator.<br><br>Lancelot probably gets fucked at some point, anyway. It just won't necessarily be to shitty outputs of GoB like 32.</br></br></br>  <br>Rider didn't survive anything for any notable amount of time. He had his mad dash, got hit by who knows how many swords, and then got trussed up like a Christmas turkey without any real difficulty.</br>  I'm going to post this again because every thread needs it:<br><br>Cu V EMIYA = Cu wins due to protection from Arrows and EMIYA having no way to stop Gay Bulge HOWEVER EMIYA can potentially Caladbolg Cu from a long way away.<br>Cu V Gilgamesh = Gilgamesh wins due to Enkidu and probably sword spamming at Gil to not let him Gay Bulge.<br>Cu V Medusa = Could go either way. Gorgon Breaker should be able to immobilise Cu who needs to look at his target to Gay Bulga them.<br>Gilgamesh V Herakles = Enkidu holds down Herakles pretty damn well, and plus Herakles was protecting Ilya at the time.<br>Medusa V Herakles = I can't see Herakles losing.<br>Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. On the one hand, it's Herakles, so Iskander might be able to kite him around the battlefield with his chariot while his army slowly whittles away Herakles' lives. Maybe.<br>Cu V Iskander = Could go either way. If Cu dodges and weaves in between Rider's army to finally reach Iskander, he could then use his runes to 1v1 Iskander into a duel which Rider would certainly lose. However, Rider could simply use his chariot to kite Cu around the battlefield while his army takes Cu down. Cu might be able to theoretically defeat Rider's army but eh. The problem is Rider won't let Cu cast Gay Bulge even once, but Cu still has a fair chance.<br>Medusa V Iskander = Gorgon Breaker. Nuff said.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Change Gorgon Breaker to Cybele.</br>  <br> Rider didn't survive anything for any notable amount of time. He had his mad dash, got hit by who knows how many swords, and then got trussed up like a Christmas turkey without any real difficulty <br>But, the moral of the story is surviving more gates than the spouse 32 is possible what Rider got was sheer durability what fucked him over was the chains. Lancelot do the same with his agility which will make him a harder target.</br></br>  <br>I need to change that whole copypasta, there are typos everywhere.</br>  <br>I like how nobody gave a fuck about Archer killing Souichiro when he wasn't a master any more, nor a mage.</br>  <br>It's already been stated that he couldn't handle more. Stats aren't everything.</br>  <br>I was only answering where the quote came from. If you want to look for powerlevel arguments, I'm not your guy.</br>  <br>No, fuck you, that's the point. He's described as being incredibly strong and then he looses to people he clearly wasn't supposed to. He's just a guy for the main characters to beat, but they can't even make it credible. If this isn't shit writing I don't know what is.</br>  <br> Iskander V Herakles = Tough one. <br>Not really. Iskander or his army can't get past God Hand.</br></br>  <br>If I remember correctly, Shirou had some problems with it in the VN, but he also has the policy that if he believes someone brought something onto themselves, then he's not gonna do anything.</br>  <br> If this isn't shit writing I don't know what is. <br><br>Did you just now see how silly the fights between Servants are? The stats, Noble Phantasms, skills.</br></br></br>  <br>Iskander can, it's the army that's the question.</br>  <br>Rider just isn't a very good example. He sustained some notable wounds from GoB in a very short period of time because he knew he was essentially a dead man and could afford his last stand.</br>  <br>Thank you, someone understands finally</br>  <br>None of those things seem particularly silly to me though. It's probably just your preferences that makes it seem silly to you.</br>  <br>...So that's when Shirou projected Saber's mystic sword to beat Berserker! Cool, huh?</br>  <br>That line was talking about every servant, not just lancelot<br><br>It's wrong, your only line about how Lancelot would lose is disproven by a far weaker (melee combat wise at least) servant later in the novel</br></br></br>  <br>Some of them presumably can ignore God Hand just fine. You only need to be A rank. The problem is landing a hit without Herakles fucking you up beforehand.</br>  Why didn't Shirou just use a Command Seal to instantly teleport Saber behind Gilgamesh and kill him?  <br>How about this.<br> Urobuchi is a hack </br></br>  <br> It's already been stated that he couldn't handle more <br>Expect was later proved false later that surviving 32 gates is possible. Not everything is in set in stone you know.</br></br>  <br>I can agree to that</br>  <br>Didn't have any</br>  <br>Which route? In Fate, he didn't have any to spare.</br>  <br>Because he wasn't Saber's master</br>  <br> trusting the narrator <br>This is the same narrator that repeats a thousand times that a human could never possibly defeat a servant?</br></br>   Why are character flaws affecting my hard number crunch <br><br>Literally roleplayers VS rollplayers</br></br>  <br><br><br>OK but how come no other master ever uses their Command Seals offensively in the story, like, ever?</br></br></br>   Nothing but blood thirst flowed from the black knight. Even the whirlwind of prana seemed ominous as a groan full of deep hatred. <br><br> Berserker... Everyone could see that without waiting for a confirmation. Such a fiendish surge of murderous intent could only come from the class of the Heroic Spirit of fury. <br><br> A Noble Phantasm is a weapon for the exclusive usage of the Heroic Spirit who owns it. Another Heroic Spirit who gets a hold of it won't be able to handle it correctly. Be it by miracle or skill, it should be properly impossible to repel a consecutive strike so clearly in a flash. <br><br> As the King of Conquerors calmly commented, Berserker wasn't taking one step back in front of Archer's fierce attack. On the contrary, when a more powerful Noble Phantasm flew at him, he would abandon his current one to exchange it scrupulously with the new weapon. <br><br> In the hollow silence, there was only Berserker in the middle of the dust coming down. The surroundings, including the storehouses and street lights, were all completely ruined. The black knight had a battle ax in his right hand and a simple sword in his left. All the other Noble Phantasms were scattered at Berserker's feet, or stuck in the rubbles around. Not a single blade had reached the black armor. <br><br> The next count of glowing Noble Phantasms reached thirty-two. This time, even Rider kept silent. Berserker had endured a continuous attack of sixteen Noble Phantasms, but there was no way to resist twice that number. That was the same for all the other Servants. Nobody could estimate the limits of the latent power of the golden Archer anymore. <br><br> Still, what an astonishing power that was. Berserker was capable of pillaging at will the countless Noble Phantasms thrown at him by Archer. They now understand the frightening lure. The instant Berserker's gauntlets grab one, the control of Archer's Noble Phantasms go to the black knight. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rider just isn't a very good example. <br>And how come? what really fucked him up at the end was chains not the relentless volley of GoB.</br></br>  Why did Saber attempt to kill Rin on episode 1?<br>So much for muh honorable knight values.</br>  <br><br><br>Why didn't he just project a sword shaped Command Spell?</br></br></br>  <br>You (can) do it in fate/extra when rescuing Rin/rani<br>You do it in fate/hollow ataraxia in the hrunting scene</br></br>  <br> What is Hollow Ataraxia <br>Because they're not just something that you can use on single battles like that, and you need to keep one to make the Servant kill themselves.</br></br>  <br>FSN pulls shit like this with every occasion it gets, the story makes no sense at all. I have a hard time remembering an anime with more ridiculous asspulls and irrational characters.</br>  <br>I agree with you. I personally never gave a shit about the power levels so it never really bothered me.</br>  <br> with more ridiculous asspulls <br>Well, the fact that it did so much damage was an asspull, but the sword itself was foreshadowed long before the fight with Berserker.<br> irrational characters <br>They're not really irrational, just really fucking weird at times. And the ones that are really fucking weird are treated as being really fucking weird.</br></br></br></br>  <br> By possessing yourself with a previous self </br>   Berserker is definitely not a simple mad dog. The Heroic Spirit that became Berserker is a master warrior with amazing skills that even after his Mad Enhancement, he still possessed such an extraordinary ability. <br><br> As soon as he lets go, Berserker will butcher everything it sees, and it will not stop until all of its prana is spent. If the battle had continued for much longer, all would have been lost. Kariya would be drained into a dry husk by the worms as he would have been forced to supply more prana – more than his body would ever be able to handle. <br><br> To Kariya, the battle among Servants was truly risky. If he couldn’t endure to his limits and stop Berserker, the only thing that’s waiting for him is his own destruction. <br><br> Berserker has been hit by Rider’s Noble Phantasm. The damage was enormous. Without question, in order for it to fully heal it would take a great amount of time. And prana. The prana Berserker requires to repair its body can only be obtained from the worms in Kariya’s body.   gross </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't kariya just ordered Berserker to kill Zouken?</br>  <br>Why didn't Natalia just land the water in the plane?</br>  <br>Zouken is everywhere and you can't kill him directly, something like that.</br>   Muh gil  <br> Muh Gate Of Babe Lone <br><br>Not only Gil is countered by UBW, but this fucking retard was arrogant till the end, it was not matter of skill/strength, it was to decide which one would spam the most blades and the fastest, turns out UBW spam faster than GoB, and Gil realised that he should've pulled Ea out of his poophole too late.<br><br>Also, Gil is the strongest servant, but just on paper, because he got a load of Noble Phantasm to spam, but that's it, he is a king, not a warrior.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What stopped him from striking an immobile Gil was Enkidu, but he had still been skewered ''from head to toe'' by Gate of Babylon. He might not have survived those wounds, regardless, but it was commendable that he didn't stop running.</br>  <br>Yeah, we got that anon-kun. Shirou explained it, remember?</br>  <br>lol Zouken has trucker bugs inside Kariya which basically notify him of everything Kariya is doing.</br>  <br> he didn't stop running <br>I thought that was implied to be from help from Waver's Command Seal?</br></br>  <br>That would give Zouken time to shit his pants</br>  <br>Cuz Gil didn't use his world destroying weapon seriously.</br>  <br>Yea, the number of thread on the matter prove that.</br>   projections are strictly worse than their originals because human imagination is limited <br> actually nevermind who said that a fake can't surpass the original? <br> I said that? Fuck <br> doesn't matter, Shirou wins lol <br><br>Nasu's "logic" behind that fight</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It has nothing to do with sword spam, which isn't even what makes GoB so deadly. Gil is the strongest Servant, he's just lazy and too fucking careless.</br>  <br>Some people can't handle the truth.</br>  <br>His Command Seals helped, yeah.</br>  <br>But Nasu wrote it, so it must be true.</br>  <br>Nothing about that was violated during the fight.</br>  <br>They're a rank down, but they're made of the same materials, so they break.</br>  <br> Gil is the strongest Servant </br>  <br>You do know that Shirou's mentality is really important to having the blades not be shit, right? If he doubts that they're the real things, then they'll break instantly from the next attack. He needs to be confident for the blades to work.</br>  <br> Fate/Zero even says that Lancelot would not have been able to deal with more GoB. <br>F/SN says Saber/Shirou/Berserker/Rin/Caster will die thousand times.</br></br>  <br> grab Gil's NPs <br> stick them in the ground everywhere <br> run and jump like a ginger <br> throw the NPs back as needed <br>Unlimited Theft Works</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than JETS, at the very least.</br>  <br>Yes it has, that's the whole point of the fight, heck, that's the point of GoB and UBW<br><br> Muh gil is teh strongurst <br>In terms of stat he is a little bit above average, and that's all<br>Also Archer Heracles would like to have a word.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> stats </br>  Why argue about powerlevels when perfection already exists?  <br>Archer Heracles would lose just as badly as everyone else. There's not even the chance of Gil not taking him seriously, so he's more fucked than others.</br>  <br>Why are Caster's always so best?</br>  <br> muh Archer Herakles <br>You're a funny guy.</br></br>  <br>Tbh, it was a bad exemple, cause of Enkidu, but in term of strength on paper, Archer Heracles could be a serious threat.<br><br><br><br>HurrHurr</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a component of GoB vs UBW. Doesn't change how GoB is best used to capitalize on your opponent's weaknesses a la Ko-Gil rather than spamming countless swords in one direction.</br>  MUH GIL<br>MU SELF-INSERTING<br>MUH GIL IS STRONGEST</br></br>  <br>He really couldn't. His high Divinity and lack of proper defences for GoB means that he's pretty much fucked. Archer Heracles hasn't been said to have anything that could really compete with a serious Gil, which WOULD be a thing if Archer Heracles was around.</br>   be strongest of strong <br> get rekt by a mongrel <br> cry <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>A Servant said to approach the strongest Heroic Spirit, in his best class, is a serious threat? You don't say.</br>  <br>I don't know, but it's true</br>  <br>We barely know anything about Archer Herk ''on paper.'' Being a serious threat just means he gets fucked by Gil that much faster.</br>  I've been wanting to watch the Fate series. Where should I begin? some friends told me I should begin with Zero, then move on to UBW and completely skip the first Stay Night, is that correct?  <br>Ask your mom for help, retard</br>  <br>The best way to go through fate is to start with the visual novel for f/sn</br>  <br>Start with Zero. I'm not really sure what to recommend after that; I just finished UBW, which is well-produced the whole way through, but kind of falls apart story-wise, and I've heard that the original Stay Night might actually give you the context you need to enjoy it more. So... maybe start with Zero, try the original Stay Night, and if you're not enjoying it because of the production, switch to UBW?</br>  <br>I would definitely say start with Fate/Zero. It fills you in on how Servants and the Grail War work along the way (though it might help to have Google on standby to look up some things if need be), and adds some beneficial backstory for some of the characters. The identity of one minor character in Fate/Zero is something of a spoiler for F/SN but I'd say it doesn't really impact your enjoyment of it too much. The DEEN F/SN is sloppily animated, which makes it kind of a chore to watch, so skipping that would be recommended as well, just skip right over to UBW (since it partially acts as a sequel to Zero anyway). Fair warning: UBW kinda falls off a cliff once it hits the second half, because the fights aren't as creative and it loses its lightheartedness and charm. Like Gabbo said in her ANN review I'm kinda tempted to just tell you to skip from episode 13 to the epilogue because it gets tedious.<br><br>Sidenote: some people will tell you to start all the way at the beginning with the VN. Don't. The writing is piss-poor, the pacing is like molasses in January and it really hurts not being able to truly *see* the epic fights that are supposedly taking place. It's good for a few laughs from the awful prose but that's about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch Zero, then read the Visual Novel. After completing the Fate route (the first one), you can choose to either watch the UBW anime or read the UBW route in the novel.</br>  <br>If you're only gonna watch the anime, it doesn't entirely matter where you start, as long as you stay away from the stuff from Deen. I recommend reading the VN though, since that gives the most information and background, especially when it comes to the characters.</br>  <br>I agree with that first half, but he should at least try the VN, just in case he actually likes it.

While Rider has several different types of Noble Phantasms, Lancer also has protective ability from rune sorcery, hence counter measures from her mystic eyes. Against an expert monster exterminator like Lancer, one who has a monster alignment such as Rider might seem to be in for a tough fight....!?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why the fuck did a demi god lost to mere mongrel? <br>What's a god to a non-believer?</br></br>  <br>Still a really powerful being in a universe where gods exist and can wipe you off the face of the earth by looking at you</br>  <br>Still a god, even if you don't acknowledge someone infinitely stronger than you, he's still infinitely stronger than you.<br><br>You can go "Well I don't believe in this muscleman" to a body builder and still get punched in quite easily.</br></br></br>  <br>The guys with A or higher Strength or Magic rating can kill him once, maybe, the others can't since they didn't materialize their NPs.

However, due to the limit of the King of Conquerors abilities, he was unable to materialize their Noble Phantasms.("そんな中でも、「王の軍勢の中には征服王本人より<wbr>も強い英霊がちらほらいる」</wbr> <br> 「でも征服王の能力に限界があるので宝具までは具現化できない」など <br> 小ネタもでてきたりで、楽しんで読めました。") <br><br>People underestimate it a lot, but his army is full of heroic spirits, not a bunch of E rank shits. They are noted to be quite strong each, but just lack a finishing attack since they can't use their NP in this form. Some people in his army are far stronger than himself as a heroic spirit. Those people might have A rank strength and everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the F/Z anime visual guide had anything else of interest in it.</br>  <br>She followed Gatou up to the Mooncell because she thought it would be fun, Mooncell went "Okay fine, asshole, that's your servant now I guess" and slapped a servant mold on her.</br>  <br> But his army is just a shitty army from when he was alive. Do you know anyone strong from back then? No, then they're shit. <br><br>That's another complaint seen often<br><br>No, it's directly said that anyone from any of his summonings that pledges loyalty to him can join his army. So his army can have people from outside of his age entirely. Nasu even muses that Rider from Extra might be in there, as an example.<br><br>Not many heroic spirits would willingly grant him supreme loyalty, but if he can charisma them hard enough then some are bound to join.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said it's a maybe if the army can kill him. So far, the only thing other than NP's that we've been shown that can get past God Hand is magic, and we don't know if Iskandar has mages with A rank magic in his army.</br>  <br>They could just use pure A rank strength, like Saber does in the recent anime.</br>  And so, our piece goes on!<br><br>Kansai-hen when</br></br>  <br>No need to sully the group photo by adding the quitter loser to it.</br>   and then he said "wanna go to the Agate Festival with me?" <br> I just replied "Huh?

All those babies they experimented on for example...</br>  <br>They are homosexual lovers?</br>  <br><br>No, Naruto(Hashirama) managed to talk some sense into Sasuke(Madara) so he comes home to the village and parts his hair dresses in all black while still being kind of an oddball.<br><br>Sasuke could very well come to realize Naruto was wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hashirama or any Ashura <br> Homo. <br>Indras always get mad becuase of that.</br></br></br>  <br> And if it was Tenten's child it would have said so right there anyways. <br>Not necessarily.

Ino, Temari, Karui, hell even Sakura look more toned and fit because of their training and not eating as much.<br><br>Hinata never looked physcially fit...just soft.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck do those shutters work?<br>Its two of them with a support in the middle but when both are up the entire support just disappears?</br></br>  <br>Truly Hinata is perfect.</br>  <br>Didn't she have a crush on Shikamaru? That's quite a jump in preferences.</br>  <br>And Lee had a crush on Sakura. Both get rejected, and find each other. Or something like that.<br><br>Like I said, it's just a wild guess. After all, who would have predicted Choji would marry Karui?</br></br></br>  <br><br>That it has everything except TenTen's name. The kana isn't there.</br></br>  why havent we still gotten any good quality japanese sound for the last naruto movie? I can't take korean voices  <br>It could still be a possibility. His eyes are sort of shaped like Tenten's, and... his headband cloth is the same color as Tenten's in Part II. I'm grasping at straws at this point though. I just want to know who got "the blue beast."<br><br>And I can't tell if that's an earplug or a comm device in his ear.</br></br></br>  <br>The Novel about everyone buying Nh wedding gifts.

The Big Two aside, he could probably beat anyone from his generation. Especially now that Neiji is dead. Neiji and Shikamaru are his banes. Shikamaru is Batman, and Neiji is extremely dangerous to get up close and personal with. <br><br>Also, I vaguely remember Kakashi saying that he is actually talented. That was during Chuunin exams though, so eh.</br></br></br>  I thought Mitsuki was speculated to be Kakashi's kid?<br><br>Didn't Kakashi meet some woman with light blue hair in his gaiden from another country?</br></br>  <br> Dat Hyuga combination ultimate attack </br>  <br> Arrow shows Inojin being Sai's son instead of saying he's Ino's son. <br>Why?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm really sure Lee could open the Gates and blitz Shikamaru the fuck down before he had a chance to come up with anything unless Shika had time to set up beforehand.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I guess it depends on how the fight starts. Shikamaru with prep time is potentially game over for Lee. <br><br>Can you brute force your way through his shadow control jutsu?</br></br></br>  <br>Naruto did it during the war, also hidan and kakuzu did it</br>  <br>Sai is now a more relevant character than Ino despite never being much other than Sasuke's (less autistic) replacement for fillers and movies.<br><br>The character description does say that he is both Ino and Sai's kid and that his last name is Yamanaka.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes. His own physical strength/condition relates to it, which is why he was unable to finish Tayuya off near the end of their fight because he was too tired and weak to have it crush her neck.<br><br>Pretty sure Kakuzu and Naruto broke out of it before too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so Sai is keeping is codename as his real name and adopted the last name Yamanaka?</br>  <br>Shikamaru should eat his oats and do his squats then.</br>  <br>100 situps, pushups, squats and a 10km run everyday?</br>  <br>Yes, and throw these in for safe measure.</br>  <br>He still has a bomb tattooed on his tongue.

How can he understand romantic love if he doesn't understand the basic rules of friendship?</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127350<wbr>122</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Sorry for the late reply but I had the same problem.

The everyday lives of the nine super-powered siblings of the royal family are monitored by more than 200 surveillance cameras and broadcast nationwide. The people of the nation who are watching the broadcast will have the ability to elect the next monarch. Akane is the third-oldest sister who can manipulate gravity. She is shy and desperately does not want to be caught on camera.  Seems that maybe me and OP will watch the stream since anyone being silent about this show.<br><br>Oh well.</br></br>  <br>Was watching the Laplace stream, besides there's still an hour to go and that sabage show in 30.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was pretty excited for this show, I'm sort of confused as to why nobody else is. Unless &gt;Laplace. <br><br>Also, is it just me or is CC down?</br></br></br>   HanaKana as the lead <br>Oh well, I did watch and enjoy Saekano despite Matsuoka.<br><br>I'm good to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I checked the archive and found that CC is dead. RIP</br>  Akane is the cutest, Scarlet Bloom too<br><br><br>CC has been dead for a while unless he came back without me noticing. Neetball is the new. <br><br>As to why people aren't interested, no idea honestly. It's a kirara series so I expected a few more maybe, though it only has something like 3 chapters translated so maybe that's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shuu and Satou are best OTP. Kanade's a cutie too.  <br>Maybe because subs are not ready for new season</br>  <br>Shouldn't stop people usually, there's plenty of things being discussed that still only have funi for subs.<br><br>Some group might pick it up after it's aired too. No idea who though.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi hasn't even released any of their new simulcasts this season.</br>  Don't worry anon, I'm in for this  <br>And stuff is still being talked about? There's plenty of people on /a/ who watch the livestreams. I'm watching it right now.</br>  Manga is finally scanlated. First 3 chapters are out since yesterday  <br> I'm watching it right now. <br>I thought it didn't start until like 20 more minutes</br></br>  So wait which stream should I be watching? Sorry I haven't watched a livestream for a while so no idea where I should be looking.  <br><br>People can't really talk much about the shows without subs, don't you notice how /a/ is slow as fuck, new season /a/ is usually fast</br></br>  <br>Who picked it up?</br>  <br>Some survival game show is on, it's alright. This is on after.<br><br><br>People still talk about the source and just random shit. This is strangely slower than a lot of other stuff. Faster than some things though.<br><br><br>Neetball</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see channel offline at Neetball is that right? Or do I have to sign up or something.</br>  <br> Neetball <br>I've been on neetball for like an hour now and it still says channel is offline.<br><br>Is this just a problem on my end?</br></br></br></br>   can't into Nip <br>Guess I'll wait for subs.<br> Funi <br>Kill me.</br></br></br>  <br>Discusting!</br>  <br><br>Connectcast is messed up or something, follow the vaughnlive link below</br></br>  Here we go.  The dad doesn't seem to gigantic.  starting<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br>  Ah, this colorful art is so refreshing.      <br>Good start<br><br><br>Yeah he seems to have been scaled down a little.</br></br></br></br>  kanade best girl  Oh an advert for Urara Meirochou, interesting.    CGI Cameras, oh baby    Tail Red S2        I would vote for her   Hayamin as background character           seven thousand incest doujin<br><br>or none at all</br></br>  <br>Manage to get a screen of all the posters?</br>  <br><br><br>These images are hi-res. What are you streaming from? It can't be netball, that's like 240p.</br></br></br>      Didn't expect so much QUALITY during the 1st fucking episode.   IMS <br>How long until this show completely falls apart?</br>    GOD HAND  <br>Not really a background character, she got a name and even appears in OP</br>    Is this yuri?      <br>Gay as fuck</br>    Smooth Haruka, smooth <br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br>  JAPANESE TRUCK TAKES MANY DIFFERENT FORMS    <br>Yay!</br>  I vote for Shu.  Why doesn't Akane just wear pants?    <br>Pants aren't kawaii</br>    Man, this show looks retarded already.  why is misaki such a slut?    <br>Has to appeal in some way because she's got nothing else. All her clones are excellent in specific ways and she's just average in every way.</br>  That was actually better than the manga    <br>She can split herself into a load of copies<br>Imagine the possibilities</br></br>  <br>The girls are cute, which is enough for me. But the QUALITY and plot is retarded, I agree</br>    Is the monarchy and power gimmick really needed. It feels like this could stand on its own if it was just a SoL.  end card  <br>Yeah it did a good job of introducing the powers. You don't learn some of them in the manga for a while if I'm remembering right. Next episode is Satou, excellent.<br><br>End illustration by Harikamo too, guess kirara might be trying to push their manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If it wasn't the for the King competition and their superpowers what would the story be? Just a slice of life about a huge family?</br>    <br> QUALITY <br>Looked fine to me honestly, unless you're that autistic over CG cameras.</br></br>  <br>such lewd body</br>  <br>What's the problem with that? It's not like we've had a fuckhuge family SoL before.<br><br>Though don't get me wrong, I don't really mind it that much. I just personally would have preferred if it didn't have it is all. Still good fun.</br></br></br>  I feel like the monarchy is unneeded, that as a large family with powers it would work. The monarchy is retarded. They have all this money, yet come home to a small home instead of a mansion, and have family dinners where the mom cooks. Its like masturbation material for the "average Japanese family", as if that's the best way to live.  <br>Akane is my favourite, but oh god Misaki is so hot<br><br><br>Camera's looked fine honestly, they even blended in fairly well which is strange for CGI. Drones looked a bit dodgy when she first created them. Not something that ruins the episode though.</br></br></br></br>   AOTS   OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3ue<br>ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3x0</wbr></br></wbr>  this is probably shit but I love the character designs. How are they so good?  <br>Same guy who did twintails. <br>I don't think it's that shit, but I did import the manga a while back so I'm a little biased maybe.</br></br>  Is somebody saving us from Funi?  so, is it shit?  It's  gangsta.   <br>used girl 0/10</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>Do I need to listen to good rapists like Puff Diddy, Fifty's Scent and Little Wine to truly appreciate this anime?</br>  <br>Sorry bro, you can't enjoy this show if you're that white.</br>   VAs are great <br> OST is okay <br> Animation is uhh... <br><br>Conclusion: Read the manga.</br></br></br></br>  I just feel like the show could use a little extra style to make it better. As it stands it's got a lot of grit but not a whole lot else  <br>yes it is akame ga kill 2.0</br>  <br>They're nothing alike, it's more like Samurai Champloo on literal steroids</br>  <br>but it is, with any fucking show there are always similarities<br> antagonists are a group team <br> antagonists are edgy, half of the time no one likes these fucks is simply because they're being massive dicks for no reason <br> author relies on edgy antagonists and their crimes in order to rile up the reader against the evil group <br> muh rape </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> literally reposting bait from the thread yesterday <br>disgusting</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, not yet anyway. Right now it's just average.</br>  <br>It's a fucking mafia plot you stupid fucking Weeb, every single mafia plot creates antagonists in this way, from Godfather to Jojo Part V.</br>  <br>None of which is just there to shock, but integral part of each character storyline<br> antagonists are a group team <br>Wow really. If for you it's about what and not how every anime will look the same to you</br></br></br>  <br>The manga is better. Read that and drop the anime.</br>  Whats there to hate?  <br>Especially since the latter part of the series relies heavily on action.<br>Unless the animation gets better Manglobe just can't do it with all dat QUALITY</br></br>  <br>I just read the manga, because the first anime episode was promising.<br><br>Of course, it had do drift to this clusterfuck plot of human society discriminating xxx like in Black Bullet etc.<br><br>Why not just a chill Gangsta anime?</br></br></br></br></br>  It's great, so all the show is going to get is shitposting. After it's finished it'll get a few random threads ala Jormungand.<br><br>If only it'd started airing during winter when the kids are back in school.</br></br>  <br>I get the feeling you are a bot. You said the same thing yesterday over and over again. didn't /sp/ used to have this same thing? people getting riled up by imaginary people?</br>  <br> &gt;antagonists are a group team <br>I'm guessing you keep posting this because it was your first manga ever and it traumatized you by how bad it was?</br></br>  butthurt gangstfags detected tbh  <br> bots <br> 4chan </br></br>  Left or right?  <br>Right.<br>Duh.</br></br>  <br>none</br>  Both and add Espada  <br>Aki always</br>  <br>left looks soft</br>   The virgin   This is Killua. Killua is cute. I also just eliminated the wiggle gif, so let's discuss something other than wiggles.  Do we even know if Togashi is still alive?  Hey guys I just caught up to the current chapter of Hunter x Hunter but I can't find any chapters after 349. Does anyone know where the chapters after that are?      <br>But wiggles are so cute</br>  Why didn't they keep their promise?  <br>Well, you know<br>Shit happened</br></br>  YOU  JUST  no  SMILE  <br>But they're going to, anon. On their quest for Gyro they're going to see the world together.</br>  i'm glad the anime had a cooldown period after the chimera arc but it was also a really awkward place to end it, feels like the adventure's only just begun  Why is this allowed?  <br><br>fuck that fish cunt for eating her<br><br>she could have been eaten by the ant queen and turned into a QT beegirl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if she was fed to the queen by that point, she'd just be food for meruem.</br>    Domestic violence  Morel is cute  <br>Shoot is cute</br>  Rejoice everyone new Dragon Quest game is coming out!    <br> Slaps imbued of Nen </br>  <br>Less than Morel.</br>  <br>Impossible.</br>  <br>I love Shoot but Morel sweats cuteness literraly with his little glasses.</br>  Drawfag Thread 1528<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1527 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You.</br>  <br>the ones with the worst voices</br>    <br>Who?</br>  <br>lolis</br>  Please read the guide before asking questions<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>And it would look even more shit in plastic form.</br>  <br>Looks as if they're wrapped with bubble wrap</br>  What's a safe temperature for figs? My room has no ac and good way to cool it and during the middle of the day it gets really hot and I'm worried about my fig  <br>well, if it gets too damn hot, the coloring would probably melt away.

As cool as possible seems like a safe bet though</br>  <br>Is it humid?<br>I don't think dry heat is as bad as nasty humif heat.<br>Get an ac or something in there, you shouldn't be collecting figures if you have no means of maintaining them.</br></br></br>  After seeing so many people wank this shit off on here, I decided to give it a try.<br><br>What the fuck? I couldn't make it past episode 36. It's legitimately horrible, I don't even know how I made it this far. Does it get any better? Good enough to even actually watch?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the ending is missing.<br>Oh well, I've got other things to watch.</br></br>  <br>It presents things in a better order to introduce the viewer to the characters and how alchemy works, instead of starting the first episode with ice tsunamis and city-wide transmutation circles.</br>  What happens in episode 36?  <br>To be fair, from the beginning they established that the opening act was going to be extremely brief because it's all still the same as that first anime that everyone already watched.</br>  <br>Dude, if you made through to the Briggs story, you gotta see the ending. There aren't many left and it actually gets good there.</br>  Pictured are purely platonic feelings. No sexual or romantic tension here.  <br><br>Humorously enough the exact opposite sentiment has been expressed plenty of times in these threads.<br><br>Irohafags complain that when their girl starts getting hated on, it means the Americans are waking up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see that you still like Iroha, satan.</br>  <br>It's 8PM in the UTC+1 zone right now. If anyone's going to sleep it's sure as hell not the kind of people who spend there time in general threads on 4chan.</br>  <br>Nah. EU, AUS/Asia are Irohafags to the core.<br>The complaints about US waking up are mostly from Irohafags.</br></br>  <br>I'm in burgerland in the Iroha posts tend to pop up during the periods of 1 AM to like 5 AM in the morning. So I can conclude that you're full of shit anon.<br><br> Though I'm an Irohafag myself, but then again I hate living in America so that might have something to do with it. </br></br></br></blockquote>]
