I think WW can add a half chapter somehow, then finish off the series with Volume 12.  Yukino is at her weakest point right now.<br>This is going to be a very long wait.<br>Watari, don't fuck us on this one. You've been building up to this for over half the series. This had better pay off.</br></br>  so is volume 12 confirmed to be the last one?  <br>Learn from Irohafags' example: Expect the worst but hope for the best.<br><br><br>Confirmed? Nah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>where does the light novel pick up after this?</br>  <br>My heart</br>  <br>I am dumb and this isn't working for me.</br>  <br> Learn from Irohafags' example: Expect the worst but hope for the best. <br>There is wisdom in those words but this is an entirely different matter.<br>Yukino is the main heroine of this series. If Watari doesn't handle her character development correctly then he has failed as a writer.</br></br></br>   just finish watching ep 13 <br> No idea what was happening <br>AM I A FUCKING RETARD? I don't even know what was their problem</br></br>  <br>We need a movie for vol 10.5</br>  Irohasu!  <br>Volume 12, 6 months from now.<br>The anime covered everything.<br>If you want more content reread the entire series from the start. The anime skips over A LOT.</br></br></br>  At least I got to see her one last time  <br> The anime covered everything. <br> The anime skips over A LOT. <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. The whole "hurting eachother is part of genuine" thing set up both the main heroines an gigantic window to fail.<br><br>It would be trivial for Watari to sink either one of them and it wouldn't negative the writing whatsoever.</br></br></br>   pls help one day, i'm autistic,spoilt and rich but i got problems okay ;_; t-his isn't forced drama or anything just GENUINE problems, btw i want ur dick   How can 8man be genuine with Yukino when Sensei forced him into the club with her to solve her problems?  <br> Volume 10,5 OVA fucking when. <br>Hopefully soon, capt'n.<br><br>Irohasu~</br></br></br></br>  <br>Daily reminder that vol11 and 12 translation never because spyro is an autistic yukinofag who even deleted some iroha parts in novel 10</br>  <br>One of them getting hurt =/= Yukino's character development being thrown out the window for drama<br><br>I don't see where you made that connection.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> even deleted some iroha parts in novel 10 <br>Prove it.</br></br>  <br>That's not the point of genuine. Genuine isn't just being able to accept eachother's feelings, it's being able to accept them being rejected as well.<br><br>What made the Tobe/Ebina situation non-genuine wasn't that he couldn't confess, it's that he couldn't confess without the group falling apart. "Not that close" and all that.<br><br>Watari could easily sink the main heroines, with them being able to accept that and preserve their group as the resolution of their efforts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can't tell the difference between ships and character development then there's no reason to keep talking. This conversation is over.</br>  <br> that pic <br>Fucking why. Literally why.</br></br>  <br>Yukinon's cookies defy logic.<br>Don't question them.</br></br>  <br>And why is that bait?<br>am I bait too for asking?</br></br>  <br> romance isn't character development <br>At least you tried.</br></br>  <br><br>Yukino a shit.<br>She has been nothing but a pile of dramas since volume 6. <br><br>Even if she manage to fix herself in the final volume, she will still be remembered as the damsel in distress who have done nothing but having others save her ass every volume. <br><br>I can't even think of a way for her to redeem her character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's why you aren't the one in charge of writing her character.</br>  So is there a  fanfic somewhere where Haruno shits on Hayato in front of his friends and they all try to white-knight for him but Haruno proceeds to tear them apart by exposing to them just how shit Hayato really is? <br><br>Because I just realized that I like Hayato's friends less than I like Haruno.</br></br>  <br>Hayama is a good guy</br>  <br>we need a movie or two to wrap things up, hopefully in 2-3 years</br>  <br>fuck off with your memes</br>  Ok, so who the fuck do I have to kidnap to get a 10,5 OVA?  <br> nearly an hour of newspaper-making <br>Please god no.</br></br>  <br>More like 40 minutes of Iroha date being adapted wonderfully, the rest would be the newspaper and it's comedy moments.<br>But I must say that an OVA is much better for that.</br></br>  <br>The date probably wouldn't need all that much time to adapt at all. 8man spends an entire day with Iroha yet they only do like 4 things.</br>  <br>Not confirmed, but very likely. Although I fear with Oregairu's popularity and success at the moment WW will turn into a shilling hack and needlessly extend the series more than it should be.</br>  <br> The date probably wouldn't need all that much time to adapt at all. <br>Yeah I know, don't mind me. That was just my Irohafaggotry showing.</br></br>  I am convinced Watari hates Yukino and will end her with Hayama.  <br> 8man spends an entire day with Iroha yet they only do like 4 things. <br> mfw Watari writes a script to extend the date </br></br>  <br><br>Nothing whatsoever has been said about it being the last. Not sure why you'd assume it is. There's still a hefty amount of plot to get through.</br></br>  Why does irohafags always tries to make her seem more relevant than she actually is? She just replace komachi because komachi is busy with exams and shit. It's getting annoying to be honest.  What will you guys be expecting from the new Yahari VN?<br><br>Hopes and dreams that will be shattered by Vol .12?</br></br>  <br>People think there will only be 12 volumes because that's what Watari's contract says, he can still write more but 12 volumes is a requirement.</br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> What will you guys be expecting from the new Yahari VN? <br> An English translation. <br> And Miura route. </br></br></br>  <br>Please go back to your containment thread.</br>  <br>He better fucking write more than 12.</br>   Want to get Yui Windows 7 theme. <br> Its all pink. <br><br>Decisions, Decisions.</br></br></br>  <br>The .5 books don't count as part of the contract?</br>    <br> it's not Saturday yet, anon </br>  <br>Most likely since they are more like side stories.</br>  <br> she just replaces the character that 8man loves more than anyone else <br><br>She sounds pretty relevant to me.</br></br></br>  <br> she replaces komachi <br>That is why she will always have my hatred.</br></br>  <br>I like the new deredere Yukino but she'll be better when she sorts her problems out. At least 8man has told her to basically get a grip now.</br>  <br> she just replaces the character that 8man loves more than anyone else <br><br>Nah, the one that 8man ever say love to are Zaimokuza, Komachi, SakiWho, saika. Guess how relevant they are.</br></br></br>  <br> liking moeblob Yukino compared to the s1 Goddess <br><br>I'm sorry, we can't be friends.</br></br></br>  <br> someday </br>  <br>The date seems really weirdly written. Is it normal in Japan to spend like 5 hours chatting in a cafe? Because they eat lunch, go to the cafe, and then it's dark. Watari doesn't even do a "we walked around some more looking at stores" handwave to explain where the time went.</br>   Yukinofags think Yukino is a different character now. <br><br>She's the same useless girl guys.</br></br>  <br> 8man loves Komachi more than anyone else <br> Komachi is irrelevant <br> Iroha is irrelevant. she just replaced Komachi, who 8man loves mores than anyone else </br></br></br>  <br>You really need to read that chapter again.</br>  <br>I liked the Ice Queen from S1 but it's nice to see her like this if only for a while, after that it's painful to see her this way.<br><br>Hopefully she does get passed this.</br></br></br>  <br>What were they talking about?</br>  <br><br>To be revealed.<br><br> But The LN. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Were they going to  Saize ?</br>  <br>He planned to go there</br>  <br>It can't be helped.<br><br>His favorite heroine is totally useless in this volume compared how she is in previous volumes.<br><br>No wonder he has no motivation to do translation anymore.<br><br> tfw you realise your waifu is shit. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Unless Spyro omitted something, it's true. 8man finishes kicking Iroha's ass at ping pong at 11 o clock, they go to lunch, and then go to the cafe. There was a bit of walking, but 8man mentions being warm from the ramen just as they get to the cafe, so it couldn't have been that long.<br><br>He does also mention they were chatting inside the cafe too long, and it's getting dark when they leave.<br><br>Really not sure how that could be interpreted as anything other than them being in the cafe for a long-ass time unless winter in Japan makes it get dark at like 2 PM.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> We pondered over places we could eat at as we walked around. <br><br> “If you’re okay with anything, then… Saizeriya sounds good.” <br><br> Isshiki shook her head in rejection. Come on, didn’t you just say you were fine with anything…? In the end, I had to take into consideration some of Isshiki’s needs when I answer. <br><br>She had the class not to laugh in his face over it. Not bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't that long, that was during winter when the daylight lasts a lot less than usual.</br>  <br><br><br> Saize </br></br></br>  <br> teaching him how to deal with girls <br>Based Iroha.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Alright.Whats with this Saize ridicule going on? Is there some deep Chiba culture at work here?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> His favorite heroine is totally useless in this volume compared how she is in previous volumes. <br><br>She has been useless since dayone.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm fine with anywhere <br> Okay, how about this place? <br> Are you kidding me? I'm not fine with that. <br><br>I don't have any experience with women but this sounds incredibly annoying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SORE ARU</br>  <br>it gets completely dark by 5pm in japan's winter. so getting dark by 3~4ish when they leave the cafe sounds about right.</br>  <br>Iroha CGs.</br>  <br> Since dayone. <br><br>I love you for your puns.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, me too. More Haruno pls.</br>  Don't mind me, just dropping some Iroha foreshadowing.  At this point I'll be happy if anyone but Yukinoshit wins.  <br> He does also mention they were chatting inside the cafe too long, and it's getting dark when they leave. <br> chatting <br> too long <br><br>I smell something here.  Did they also go to a love hotel "for practice"? <br><br>Joke aside, now I understand why he was scared to the recipe blackmail, spending 5+ hours with a girl alone in a cafe is nowhere near "safe"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man fell for the exact same thing when he brought up Saize with Orimoto.<br><br>Iroha's just teaching him about girls, in his monologue he even feels like he got more out of the date than Iroha did.</br></br></br>  <br> CR </br>  <br>That still leaves them in the cafe for a really long time. The LN makes it sound like they literally go straight from the ramen place to the cafe.</br>  <br>No wonder he wants something genuine.</br>  <br><br>Why is 5 hours too long? I always thought chatting on dates would go for longer than that. Heck, just loitering and walking around is the usual stuff.</br></br>  <br>Now that you mention it, FFF has that episode out.<br><br>Still, they don't really butcher the meaning. Though just saying "type" rather than "your type" is a mistake. (Hayama specifically says 好きのタイプ in that line)</br></br></br>  Got the image from another thread.<br><br>Can't believe I wasted three month on btb.</br></br>  <br>they spent that days to know more about each other. Haven't you notice that after the date 8man seeing Iroha differently (to the point he stopped talking picture in the library, which never happen before)?</br>  <br>I can only speak for myself, but the thought of spending several hours on small talk makes me want to kill myself.<br><br>Also it would imply that the cafe makes up the majority of the date, yet they basically timeskip through it. I guess it's for the sake of keeping the reader from knowing more than they need to about 8man/Iroha's relationship at this point in time.<br><br>That said, 8man has a negative narrative bias, so the fact he didn't have much of anything to say about their time in the cafe implies it was productive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*scratches head*<br>not that impt to me but walking around does take more time than people usually realize it takes. maybe the trip from ping pong centre to ramen place took longer than it seemed? likewise from ramen place to cafe.</br></br>  <br>well, i'm not surprised if Spyro will be down becus his fav character is in the lowest condition but I don't think he should be disappointed forever becus watari will write her growth for us to see (Haruno mentioned growth to 8man before, so I think that will be the moment Yukino will reach too).<br><br>vol 11 will be dark arc of Yukino , vol 12 will be gray arc of Yukinoshita siblings. and the final will be her geniune form.<br><br>so , I want to give some courage to Spyro a bit but I don't know he will read my comment or not.</br></br></br></br></br>  This is the author's way of saying that she doesn't win, isn't it?  <br>Not 5 hours, but a couple of hours. Remember that after eating ramen, they changed places and went to that cafe in another district, so they spend time walking<br><br> While we were lethargically chatting over pointless things and enjoying our sweets, we were apparently sitting inside for too long. <br><br>Now that I have read the date chapter again, I realized 8man mentioned "glossy lips" twice.<br><br>Also,the theory about her being a poorfag isn't that off, since it's mentioned she was wearing knitted sweater and kept receipts (yeah, I know she used those to blackmail him, but still she looks very familiar with asking for receipts)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She won't win, but she has won over my heart</br>  <br><br>Well with 8man, he does engage in conversations properly with Iroha. He would always be comfortable and proper.</br></br>  <br> “There’s like a lot of nice stores if we go that way,” Isshiki said, hastily walking on. The direction she headed in veered slightly away from the town center and led to a subdued street with a park, offices, and apartments. <br><br> We passed the front of the central station and walked down a street that had gone through maintenance relatively recently. This area, unlike the crowded “pick-up” street, was sparse with buildings. <br><br> Having had my fill of ramen, I was feeling nice and warm—and I wouldn’t say I wanted to go home at this instant—but I wasn’t very fond of walking for long periods of time. <br><br> I looked at Isshiki wondering how much longer this was going to take and she pointed ahead with a smile. “You see that? It’s that store over there.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she knits her own sweaters that's hella kawaii</br>  <br><br><br><br>All this talk about genuine gives me a good laugh.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The recurring "sugar, spice, everything nice" theme, as well as occasional dialogues/monologues about what girls are like, suggest that the date is when 8man starts to see Iroha as a girl. It's also about him getting a better understanding of girls in general, as he ultimately relates some of his experience to Yukino and Yui toward the end.<br><br>It's no surprise that he both seems more conscious of the club members, and his interactions with Iroha start escalating pretty quickly, after the date. Iroha's a driving force behind Yahari's romantic plot.<br><br><br>The receipts weren't just to blackmail him, they were so she could deduct the costs from the student council fund. (Remember, one of the reasons for the date was to put the stores in the newspaper)<br><br>That said I wouldn't be surprised in the least if she's a poorfag. She's really, really good at using her time and money efficiently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  these threads got me thingken<br><br>thingken of<br><br>thingken of genuine</br></br></br></br>  <br>top kek</br>  If Yukino was just a cynical icequeen who wins/loses the 8bowl within 7-8 volumes, this could've been a good anime.  <br> Iroha's a driving force behind Yahari's romantic plot. <br>sore aru!</br></br>  <br>Moonfag here, 8man stares at and mentions her lips on multiple occasions on volume 11.<br>I wonder why.</br></br>   Control + F "genuine" <br> 9 results <br> Out of 113 posts <br>You disappoint me, yahari.</br></br></br>  <br> Alright, now that we’re done eating, let’s go home! <br> At least, that’s what I wanted to say, but we were still walking around the town of Chiba. <br> 7 lines later <br> Having had my fill of ramen, I was feeling nice and warm—and I wouldn’t say I wanted to go home at this instant—but I wasn’t very fond of walking for long periods of time. <br><br> Scoring after the cafe <br><br> “Why the heck is it so low…?” <br> I thought I tried pretty hard, you know? Yeah? Aren’t you being just a little unfair? I gave Isshiki a discontent look and she raised both of her hands that were covered with mittens. <br><br> “And if we include your behavior and conduct, that’s a total of minus forty points, okay?” <br> “I guess that’s fair.” I nodded back naturally. If anything, the fact that I lost only that much points meant I did well. Though it might’ve been more due to Isshiki’s lenience than my hard work. <br> “So you were aware of it…” <br><br>Jesus 8man could you be any more tsundere?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe Wataru wanted to kiss his kouhai.<br><br>Btw, is volume 11 any good? I can read moon but not that fluent so I tend to avoid the trouble. But since english translation isn't deliver anytime soon, I might have the motivation to read the raw. So is it any good?</br></br></br>  <br>In Watari's twitter he mentions 艶めいた唇, which is glossy and enigmatic lips (google TL). Does he use the same words in the LN?</br>  <br>He's almost out of tsun tsun in volume 11.<br>I really hate Watari for doing this shit, they have ridiculously good chemistry and yet won't end up together.</br></br>  <br>She's his type, it'll happen.</br>  <br>I don't hate Iroha but I hate when this shit happens.<br><br>"The last girl to appear has the fastest advancement and greater compatibility with the MC, leaving the other heroines in the dust."<br><br>This only leave everyone bitter and salty for the fans of the older heroines whether they win or lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Btw, is volume 11 any good? <br>It's good unless you really don't want to see Yukino's character plummet.<br><br><br>Literally TLs into 'glossy lips' or 'alluring lips' and if you want to force it into an even less common TL, it could be taken as 'sexy looking lips' or something like that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a cunt, that's what he is.</br>  <br>So Watari used the same words to describe his kouhai and Iroha lips? Someone should teach him not to be so obvious</br>  <br> Does he use the same words in the LN? <br>Sorry for taking this long, I had to grab my volume 10,5 real quick.<br>And yes, he uses the same fucking words twice.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not only watari, it's pretty much almost universal for haremshit SoL</br>  <br>Not that anon, but I actually agree and I personally jumped on the Irohaship very early. <br><br>Most of the time it is done very poorly, and usually only so that the author can shove in some comedic jealously moment. But while Watari definately uses that aspect quite a great deal, I say he does a really good job of making Iroha stand on her two feet. <br><br>The late game girl usually has minimal actual character, and is literally there solely to bring about new shades of other characters. Placed alone and she wouldn't be compelling whatsoever.<br><br>Iroha on the other-hand, at least in my opinion, is interesting in of herself, and she doesn't need the other heroines around her to make her moments shine.<br><br><br>It wouldn't surprise me personally, she definitely seems to have the mentality of "I'm going to marry a rich dude and have an easy life". Poor families usually instill that kind of thought process into their kids intentionally or not; so she might have fostered her "cute girl" appeal with that intent in mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember, she wants to marry an editor who could make large money</br>  <br>Iroha confirmed for poorfag</br>  What went wrong?  <br>It's realistic though. If two people have great compatibility they'll lock into place so quick it'll make everyone else's heads spin. Chemistry is often considered the strongest thing in romance.<br><br>If you think about it, "love at first sight" is simply what happens when a writer tries to turn chemistry up to the highest level possible.<br><br>That said even if it's realistic, doesn't mean it's always handled well. I think Yahari is a pretty good example of it being handled well. Two people don't need to go through mountainous amounts of bullshit to fall in love, it's a very natural thing that can happen easily between the right people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well i am Yuifag but i am with <br> "The last girl to appear has the fastest advancement and greater compatibility with the MC, leaving the other heroines in the dust." <br><br>It was completely opposite compared Yui x Hikki development<br><br>For me I like how Yui keep loving 8man more despite every odds is against her.<br><br>It's like She want to obtain something impossible and yet she can't be helped herself to keep trying obtain it.<br><br>I guess try hard girl is totally my type.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both she and 8man want to marry a rich person and just stay home all day, and yet both of them can actually do work just fine when required.</br>  <br>So does 8man. Those two just have the same mindset, part of their chemistry</br>  <br>She also wants 8man to become an editor.</br>  <br><br>Best couple.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127338718 <br> author <br>It's editor</br></br>  <br>Oh I know, and I'm a Yuifag too. <br><br>Yui's action increase the possibility of either her or Yukino end by not insignificant margin.<br><br>I just hate how "Iroha appears, instant healing you fuckers!". Literally exist there to cocktease the faggots.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lazy people works harder.</br>  <br>I don't think any threads have made me irrationally angrier than these.</br>  <br>Lazy people work smarter*</br>  <br> not getting the reference <br>I am disappoint.</br></br>  <br>Wat reference?</br>  <br><br>Well as an Irohafag I admit you do have a point, but that's kind of a hallmark part of Yui and 8man's relationship. She tries really hard to understand him but really can't, which makes it really hard for her to interact with him more since she can't get past his barriar. Which, again, makes it harder for her to understand him.<br><br>Then comes someone like Iroha who pretty much instantly comes to an understanding with 8man. So if Yui ever comes to learn the full details of their date aside from just the cafe, I imagine her reaction would be far more negative than her pretty passive one in reaction to the picture. <br><br>Basically being Yui is pretty fucking terrible, and I really do sympathize with you guys. At least volume 11 bumped up your chances instead of sinking it like we thought it would.<br><br><br>I know right? This was literally the first season where I closed threads out of sheer frustration with the shitposting to actual posts ratio.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There, Isshiki tapped my shoulder. When I turned around, her eyes sparkled and as if to talk in secret, she placed her hand to her mouth and whispered near my ears. “Senpai, I recommend becoming an editor.” <br> “I won’t become one, I won’t work, and I won’t look for a job.” I answered, while twisting my body to get away from the fluffy smell of Anna Sui and her ticklish breaths. <br><br> Anna Sui <br><br>What does it smell like and is it  expensive ? Teiuka, how does 8man tell its Anna Sui?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Anna Sui <br>Holy shit, poorfag nothing.<br><br>If she's actually poor, she probably starved herself trying to buy it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw she starved herself to buy it just for that date with 8man </br>  <br><br>triple dubs.</br></br>  <br>I don't know man.<br><br>I got a feeling that Yui actually understand 8man more than you imagine but she herself is not confident of it.<br>Just look how she expect 8man would to do another genuine speech by doing her action in volume 11.<br>Even in LN there's so many scene where she is reading his mind like text book especially in volume 10,5. <br>I think her understanding of him come from how she keep watching him in class and used together with him for a long time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She tries really hard to understand him but really can't <br><br>What are you even talking about.<br><br>If anything, volume 11 just shown us that out of all the girls Yui is the one who understand 8man the most.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's foreshadowing her winning.<br><br>If she won out of no where all the butthurt would be immense from people with lesser taste. This scene was setting up a massive flag so people can reference it after she wins.</br></br></br>  Irohasu~  <br>Same moonfag here.<br>So I did some checking and 艶めいた can only take the 'glossy' translation when referring to an object. <br>Since Iroha is a woman, the correct translation for 艶めいた唇 is 'alluring lips' as in a sexy way.<br>I wonder if Spyro's translated it that way on purpose or not, probably not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Threatening to turn the club into a facade and expecting that 8man would object doesn't show any exceptional understanding. It's one of the things he's most vocal about his distaste for.<br><br>All Yui did was play the bad guy, and the running theme of the series is that while playing the bad guy might bring results, it's not good in the long run.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you're misinterpreting the series pretty fucking massively if you think Yui is supposed to be the person who understands him the most. The fact that it is the complete opposite is pounded in volume after volume. Volume 11 just further plunged that nail in even harder. Volume 10 made it really fucking obvious when 8man said in his monologue that he doesn't want to be understood, he wants to understand (i.e his relationship with Yui and Yukino respectively).<br><br> And volume 10.5 had several scenes to show how a character like Iroha who actually understands him interacts with him. <br><br>I'm not saying that Yui has no romantic chemistry with 8man, I'm saying it's a pretty fundamental fact and recurring theme throughout the story that she doesn't understand him. Seriously, your shipping goggles must be on pretty bloody tight to miss a theme that fucking obvious and integral to your character's development. <br><br><br>Mind citing a scene from volume 10.5 that was along the lines? I'm not doubting you or anything, but I seriously can't recall any scene like that except for maybe the Totsuka one. <br><br><br>I'm sorry anon, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't work that way. <br><br> At least you have the VN I guess? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kanon is going to win and Yui will be crying. The series isn't even slightly subtle about this.  <br> VN <br> Sensei end is bad end </br></br>  <br>Welp, Watari really is being obvious then.<br>Jesus..</br></br>  <br>Not strictly true<br><br>Sensei end is consolation prize for wasting your time doing nothing productive.</br></br></br>   not!nice girl <br> pasta girl <br> actually perfect girl with cute sly attitude and kouhai status <br><br>How can anyone like any other girl other than Iroha? <br>I'll concede some other girls are good too, but not from the main ones that is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really the fact that 8man's always staring at her lips is pretty obvious on it's own.<br><br>Specified as alluring or not, you don't just look at them because they look nice.</br></br></br>  Nobody wins ending   Yuigahama is not a nice girl <br>Is this supposed to mean that 8man is supposed to think that she is a bitch or that all the times he thought she was nice to him was because she was in love with him?</br>  <br> dat lips </br>  <br>A lot of people confuse liking a character for thinking they're a good romantic interest.</br>  <br> If I keep shitposting this every thread, it'll catch on! </br>  <br>Or maybe that's just his take on it.</br>  <br><br>She's too manipulative and insincere. And her rapid transfer of affections from Hayato to Hachiman is strange, even if the latter is where they were really targeted all along. And 'kouhai' is neither a positive nor a negative in my book.<br><br>That being said I don't dislike her as a character. I just think it'd be bizarre if she ended up with Hachiman.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's /a/, if you don't want to fuck or be fucked by a character, it's not a good character.<br><br> But still, the current circumstances for both of the main girls needs a bit more of development. <br><br><br> not liking younger girls </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It means Yui isn't always nice, that's all. There are times when she can be mean, selfish, or flawed, even if they're rare.<br><br>It's not like a drastic image change, more like acknowledging her as a person rather than an archetype.</br></br></br>  <br>  cute sly attitude <br>Not genuine</br></br>   艶めいた唇  <br> to be shiny; to be glossy; (for a woman) to be alluring, to look sexy <br>Literally self insert fapfiction.<br>Let me guess, Iroha appearance started the same time with his kouhai tweets?</br></br></br>  <br> best chemistry with the MC <br> bizarre ending <br>That makes no sense.<br>And she's only manipulative toward those she either doesn't care about or has interest in. The whole Hayama excuse is blown in volume 11, at which point 8man knows what's going on and accepts it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mind citing a scene from volume 10.5 that was along the lines? I'm not doubting you or anything, but I seriously can't recall any scene like that except for maybe the Totsuka one. <br><br>As far as I remember the scene is :<br>- When Hikki feeling's cold in the club room. Yui asking him to reconfirm that fact and want to share Yukino blanket with him, only for Yukino cockblock her before she is done saying it.<br><br>-Yui worried about Hikki in when stumbled in his work(deadline part). Instead she place her expectation like other two/pressure him, she comfort him and make sure he will be fine even he doesn't make it in deadline.<br><br>-This scene :<br><br> Then, Yukinoshita glanced at me. “As for Hikigaya-kun…” <br><br> “Cameraman, got it.” <br><br> Cameraman, that is, to take pictures of every club. That basically means I had a legal way of procuring photos of Totsuka. I was so motivated that I’d exclaim, “Leave the cameraman role to me! Scratch scratch!” but Yukinoshita’s reply was callous. <br> “You will handle the writing, coverage, photography, planning, production, proofreading, public relations, accounting, and all routine duties.” <br><br> Talk about a lot… There are even unnecessary jobs in there, too. I made a vexed look and Yukinoshita glared at me. <br><br> “Are you unsatisfied with something?” <br><br> Not something, but everything. I thought. Then, Yuigahama patted Yukinoshita’s shoulders. <br><br> “O-Okay, okay, Yukinon. We’re already done with the coverage for the stores, so…” <br><br> When Yuigahama tried to intervene, Yukinoshita had a slightly objecting face. She then sighed and brushed aside her hair. <br><br> “…That’s true. In that case, Hikigaya-kun will be in charge of the writing and routine tasks.” <br><br> “…Roger.”  <br><br>I think most of them You can say she just being considerate. But for me she understand him enough to make him feel as comfortable as she can.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Yukinoshita family problem isn't the endgame, the option for Iroha end is opened, anon. It's just that Yukino family is probably the endgame</br>  <br> he doesn't want to be understood <br><br>He doesn't care if he's being misunderstood. <br><br> volume 10.5 <br><br>Yui ditto but actually:<br><br> he doesn't want to be understood <br> Iroha who actually understands him interacts with him. <br><br>I don't know whether or not you're doing it on purpose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Triple dubs. Iroha get it again</br>  <br>Nah, Iroha showed up much earlier than that tweet.<br>Also, nice triple dubs in Iroha's name.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I misread the post in question and ended up saying the opposite thing by mistake.<br><br>Yukino and Yui have a lot of good traits, but they have among the worst protagonist chemistry I've ever seen in a romantic series. Retarded harems notwithstanding, of course.</br></br></br></br>  Umm.. has this show ended? or is there another cour?  <br>8man could be a complete stranger and you'd be able to recognize he's getting screwed by Yukino in that scene. It really doesn't say much of anything at all.</br>  <br><br>She's manipulative towards 8man. She puts on a fake front in her dealings with him and pretends something that isn't true, that she knows herself isn't true. Furthermore she has done so over and over and over again. I just don't think that's what Hachiman is going for or what he really wants.<br><br>I dunno. I'm not really a shipper. I assure I have zero emotional investment in any particular girl getting with Hachiman. If I were his friend and Hachiman asked me right now (end of vol 11) which girl he should go for (and assuming he personally can't express a preference), I would say Yui without hesitation. Earlier in the series I would have said Yukino and I might go back to that depending on how the rest of the series plays out, but until her issues get dealt with I couldn't in good conscious tell anyone to be with her.<br><br>The only way I could really see an Iroha end is in an epilogue type situation that takes place after the events of the main story. This would assume that Hachiman and Iroha are both different people to some extent.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This ending right?</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah yeah. The master troll Wataru never hesitates to needle his shippers.<br><br>I'm not saying it's impossible, but acting like a twitter post is some holy gospel of truth the way a lot of posters like to do so is silly.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Because</br>  <br>Not from volume 10,5.<br><br>This scene in LN still counted as Yui understand 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>Iroha's chance is so slim that their fans cling onto every good mention of her</br>  <br>Why are people saying she isn't a girl?<br>The stunt she pulled toward the last ep is literally mother teresa tier.<br>Any other girls would leave Yukinon to rot by herself.</br></br></br>  <br> She's manipulative towards 8man. She puts on a fake front in her dealings with him and pretends something that isn't true, that she knows herself isn't true. Furthermore she has done so over and over and over again. I just don't think that's what Hachiman is going for or what he really wants. <br><br> I want a genuine too <br> take responsability for making me realize this <br> "hurr durr she's not genuine" <br>Are you a moron or something?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She gave me an invitation to her wedding party. </br>  <br> manipulative and insincere <br>[citation needed]<br><br> And her rapid transfer of affections from Hayato to Hachiman is strange <br>It makes perfect sense if you have paid literally any attention to the story whatsoever.<br><br> I just think it'd be bizarre if she ended up with Hachiman. <br>Considering you find her development from Hayama strange, that doesn't mean much.<br><br><br>Iroha doesn't put on fake fronts, she operates on several fronts at once. There's a big difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why are people saying she isn't a girl? <br>Are you confirmed Yui to be a futa?</br></br>  <br> Iroha's fans actually pay attention to details in the narrative <br><br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Why are people saying she isn't a nice girl? <br>Fucking typo</br></br></br>  <br>Son you are the one who need to take off the shipper google.<br><br>I'm not saying that Yui understand 8man 100% completely, but relatively speaking, out of three girls Yui is the person who understands him the most.<br><br>Iroha knows how to deal with 8man only because of their similar personality.<br>Unlike Yukino/Yui, she never connects with 8man on a deeper level. <br><br>While Yui is fundamentally different from 8man,<br>Yui learns about 8man by years of observing and spending time together. <br>What make her different from Yukino is the fact that Yukino only saw the idealized image of 8man, but Yui always looking at the real 8man. <br><br>If you really think that Iroha knows 8man better than anyone else then you are seriously delusional, <br>taking this episode for example, Iroha doesn't even know that 8man likes sweet things.<br><br><br>Also<br><br> he doesn't want to be understood, he wants to understand (i.e his relationship with Yui and Yukino respectively). <br><br> implying 8man doesn't want to understand Yui <br><br>He literally said that he wants to know everything about Yui in  <br><br><br><br>Whatever you say,<br>but this scene provided that she knows 8man from the inside out, <br>she knew that 8man will stop her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people claim Iroha puts up a front? Let's use the date as an example.<br><br>Iroha says that it's for work, but she also tells 8man it's a date, and it's reference for Hayama.<br><br>There is literally no reason why all of the above can't be true.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also know that if I punch some random guy at the bar he's probably going to punch me back.<br><br>Does that mean I have a deep understanding of bar guy?</br></br></br>  <br> said it is reference for Hayama <br> actually go to places that Hayama will never go <br><br>How do you use that as reference?</br></br></br></br>  Every thread<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=N0<wbr>YoUh0SjWc</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br>The tweet was from December 13th 2014, between vol 10 and 10.5 releases</br>  <br>It's not like she specifically said she'd want to take him somewhere he'd find different and interesting or anything.</br>  <br>That just like saying Slaine gonna end up with Asshime in Aldnoah zero despite staff keep shipping them outside anime itself.<br><br>*prepare shield before <br> how dare you compared Aldnoah shit with Oregairu. </br></br></br></br>  <br> A.Z babies </br>  <br> file name <br><br>I always missed that part, why 8man reacted to that sentence.</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga<br><br><br>Hachiman pretend that he's immune to pain<br><br>He's not</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I only watch mature anime like oregairu </br>  <br> He literally said that he wants to know everything about Yui in  →  <br>No proof. He could be lying!</br></br>  <br>Everyone in this series is a nice girl.<br><br>Including Miura.</br></br></br>  <br> "艶めいた唇で彼女は文字数制限" <br> 艶めいた唇 <br>Fucking motherfucker.</br></br></br>  <br>Even  Hayama? </br>  <br> have leftover stuco funds <br> formulate a project to use them, so your budget doesn't get cut <br> as a part of that project get to take your #2 on a date on stuco funds <br> it's also reference to help you win with #1 <br> have a good date, and the project turns out well <br> also get some bragging rights for #2's competition <br><br>10.5 Iroha gave me the biggest utilitarian boner</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> #2 <br> #1 <br>Falseflag someplace else.</br></br></br>  <br> oregairu <br> mature  <br>Kektop</br></br></br>  <br>She didn't just stop caring about Hayama when she got rejected, you know. The train scene is proof of that.<br><br>Her growing/acknowledging her feelings for 8man and waning feelings for Hayama is a gradual process just like 8man warming up to her is a gradual process. It wouldn't be unusual if she still, consciously at the very least, thinks of Hayama as her #1 when she takes 8man out on the date.</br></br></br>  <br> Even if I thought I knew something, there were still a lot of things that I just didn’t know. Like how Yuigahama who normally didn’t wear glasses would surprisingly look good with them. <br><br> At some point long ago, there was something that Yukinoshita had once said as if out of regret. That she didn’t know about Yuigahama at all. <br><br> I was the same. <br><br> The way I was before, I truly didn’t even try to know. <br><br> Not just about Yukinoshita, but also about Yuigahama. <br><br> However, right now, it was just a tiny bit. It was far from understanding and I couldn’t even say it was ideal, but even so, the three of us had definitely spent and accumulated time together. Slightly over half a year wasn’t really all that long. But even so, compared to back then, I most certainly did know just a little more about her. <br><br>Also, I just noticed:<br><br> “You’re already funny in the head if you’re equating glasses to intelligence, you know…” <br><br>Later:<br><br> Like how Yuigahama who normally didn’t wear glasses would surprisingly look good with them. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  genuine hair color <br>Should be orange, like her mama</br></br>  <br>He was hiding his inner feeling for her.<br><br>That why he almost never write sonnet for Yui in his mind except at early novel.</br></br></br>  <br> platonic friendship monologues (no seriously, he even specifically says Yukino shares the same sentiments)  <br> also she looks good in glasses <br><br>Small pickings for yuifriends, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She was basically shipping Miura with Hayama by the end of volume 10.<br>There's no way anyone would know what she thinks, we only get to see things from 8man's perspective. She had 8man decide where to go and what to do, even though he's like the antithesis of Hayama and whenever he messed up, she pressed him on to keep up with the date.<br>There's really no point in doing any of that and admitting that she had fun if she's trying to get reference for Hayama like you stated.</br></br></br>  I converted volume 11 to txt format. Anyone want it? (bear it mind that this one isn't edited so it contains some errors here and there)  <br>I do, please.</br>  <br>Please share. Someone will thank you.  I do too </br>  <br> tfw she spent all her allowance in wool balls to knit a sweater for the date, and she did that under the light of a candle </br>  <br>There's no reason why it can't be both. Iroha likes to overlap her goals.</br>  <br>Calm down, m8. I was refuting this  claim which said that what 8man said in this  was fake/lying whereas 8man implied that he does (even if it's a little bit) want to know Yukino and (by extension) Yui.</br>  <br>I'm just saying that there's no point in doing that. And I'm sure she knows that too.<br>The same shit happens in volume 11 with the whole choco and cookie story, except that this time she completely blew her hayama excuse for good.</br></br>  <br>Literally a crime if she doesn't win.</br>  <br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/pftxhpwras.txt<wbr> <br><br>also, I'm pretty good at ruby and html/css, so if you really want it I'd try to slight parse the text (remove chapter title, merge line break (page split), split to paragraph etc) and put it in a nice looking html format (proper line height, limit character to 40 etc.)</br></br></wbr></br></br>  YuixYukino<br>HarunoxCunt<br>8manxIroha<br>EbinaxTobe<br>MiuraxCookies</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw she just smiled impishly when 8man asked about that <br> "what are you talking about, Senpai?

She literally states the point when they bring it up. Read 10.5 again if you have to.<br><br>For the choco scene I'm pretty sure that's her confirming 8man's feelings one last time, and that she's going to confirm her own feelings and make an earnest go at him in the next volume. Her disappearing for the rest of the volume is the "calm before the storm" of sorts.</br></br></br>  <br> Tobe x Iroha <br>Top fucking kek</br></br>  <br>Okay, I don't disagree.

The guy will definitely swallow it. <br> 8man: You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now. <br> Yukino: Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad. <br> Yui: I wouldn't be happy with it... <br> Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai... So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, Hayama's name doesn't come up at all.<br>It only shows up when Iroha is leaving with the chocos.</br></br>  <br> So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer? <br>Very subtle there, Isshiki-san.</br></br>  https://gifsound.com/?gif=i.imgur.c<wbr>om/XqMuhN5.gif&amp;v=qhqnvaq6BwA</wbr>  I think I finally figured out why Yukino and Yui never talked about 8man when they're alone.<br><br> Yui didn't want to let on she liked him and was always kind of afraid that Yukino liked him too. Yukino had weird girl feelings for him that she could never really explain so she never brought them up. </br></br>  <br>So the reason 8man asking her out that time because he is thinking that was good time when it had valentine day atmosphere at that time.<br> <br>not bad 8man.</br></br></br>  <br>*8man asking Yui out</br>  <br>8man, she's not your grill.  Yet. </br>  <br>Translate the indirect kiss scene please</br>  <br>After Yukino's problem, we need an Iroha poorfag arc<br> Birthday party <br> 8man happens to know where she lives <br> They end up kissing   in her 1LDK </br></br></br></br>  <br> I just tried to imitates Senpai... <br><br>What does this imply? Did she explained something that was supposed to be understandable but actually is biased by her own view just like 8man always do? How the hell could she understand 8man to that extent in only like 3-4 months?</br></br></br>  <br>I think she was just afraid that Yukino will think that Yui used "friendship with Yukino" as pretext to join the club and get close to 8man.</br>  <br><br>I was thinking though, when they were making that cup for him, they had to have talked about him at least a bit. Admittedly they'd probably just talk filler at each other about hachiman anyway, but its always made me wonder what the cup making was like.</br></br>  <br>Translate when 8man mentioned her birthday please. Is there anything skipped?</br>  <br>Most of it's already been translated.</br>  ITT: Irohafags  <br>It's not that hard. I did the same thing before when I started reading LN.<br><br>Btw, already remove chapter titles, working on merge unfinished line.</br></br></br>  <br>methinks Yui was considering her promise to Haruno and not inflict Yukino with all the terrible and pointless girl-drama by sharing her thoughts about 8man.</br>  <br><br>She's similar to Komachi, so she understands him well and realizes that he's mercantile and also, right about that dialogue, 8man says how you can get MAX coffee for cost lower than usual.<br><br><br>It was somewhere in the archive<br><br><br>Just a little bit. At the very start she said that Yukino was angry that she came into the club until Yui and 8man. Then Yui said that she can't into chocolate making . 8man took out of the bag MAX coffee, saying that he likes it's level of sweetness and Iroha said that buying MAX coffee as ingredient would be tough for her budged.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> buying MAX coffee as ingredient would be tough for her budged. <br>Holy shit, she's a poorfag.<br>Just marry her already, 8man.</br></br></br>  <br> tough for her budget <br>She really is a poorfag?</br></br>  Trying to force myself to watch episode 13, but the dialogue is so fucking garbage. Surprise SakiSaki ending or I give I rate this anime a shit/10 and go read the light novel for my SakiSaki feels.  <br>I want to fuck this killing cunt</br>  So I have this theory about Iroha. <br><br>She likes Hayama but she seems more interested in what 8man's preference in chocolate is than Hayama's. It is odd to base your chocolate around who you're giving obligation chocolate to instead of the one you really want it for. She also seemed to stop what she was doing when Orimoto started talking to 8man, which is a move that other girls who like 8man did.<br><br>I have a suspicion that Iroha likes 8man and it using her "crush" on Hayama as a way to get close to 8man without triggering him and to bypass Yui's/Yukinon's anti-hussy sensors. She even forced an indirect kiss on him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No fucking shit.</br>  <br>iroha is so irrelevant</br>  <br>Spoonfeeding you just this time.<br><br> - So you really good at cooking <br> - Do you not believe my words, Senpai? <br> - No, not really... I just thought you're incredible. <br> - *Are you making passes on me?* <br> Shove the spoon into his mouth <br> - Do you hate that level of sweetness? <br> - ...I don't. <br> - Ah. I wasn't talking about the flavor though <br> She was almost touching her lips and sligtly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for. <br> - Even so, answer is the same <br> - ...Is that so.  <br> Isshiki started thinking of something and her gaze dropped inside the bowl. She then hastily lifted her head <br> - Thanks for the reference, I'm off then. Hayama-senpai~ <br> - Too sweet... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wasn't being able to stand this shitty melodrama anymore, fuck problematic girls, Sakisaki should win this shit to give 8man some peace of mind instead of more problems to worry about.  <br><br>POORFAG CONFIRMED</br></br>  <br>I think you're stressing Hayama too much. He doesn't come up nearly as much as, say, her getting 8man to assist her duties.</br>  <br>Yeah, what was with that? Why were these two together?</br>  Who is SakiSaki?  So did the girls telepathically declare war or was the end of EP13 aborting the love triangle?  <br>Yeah, sure, keep telling you that, anon.<br>I will laugh so hard at your face when Iroha wins.</br></br>  If Iroha wins I'll eat my own shit  <br> Iroha  <br> winning <br>I'll shoot my own foot if that happens.</br></br></br>  <br>They couldn't even admit their feelings.

For all the talks of genuine connections, these asshole teens are not committing to anything in their love lives and it's making me feel like this plot is grinding to a fucking standstill. Can someone win already?</br>  <br>How to Kill a Fucking Cunt.</br>  <br>Thank you, anon</br>  <br>I wonder how Saki felt about it internally. Do you think Saki has a crush on 8man?</br>  <br><br>Need more details.</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Definitely. Just from anime alone it is obvious.

If you miss all the flags, you'll end up with Orimoto.</br>  <br>It's implied she's mediocre, she's smart but not necessarily book smart. But considering she was able to become president and they usually have grade restrictions on that shit, it probably isn't all that bad.<br><br><br>I actually wouldn't mind that.<br><br><br> Hikio <br>The complete opposite, pink.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon mind if I ask where did you get those scans?</br>  <br>Was I supposed to get the impression that Yui fell out of love with Hikki during episode 13?

Thats the point of what Yui did.

I thought this whole poorfag thing was just bored anons reading too much into it.<br><br>Please 8man, just take her already</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some anon said it as a jokes, but somehow it turned out to be implied in the series.

In Yui it's also extremely obvious, she has constant self-esteem/self-loathing issues regarding not being smart, not being helpful, being selfish, etc.<br><br>This is essentially shown at the extreme at the end of the anime as well. Yuigahama has to act in the worst possible fashion to get 8man move, and Yukino of course would have gone with Yui's proposition had 8man not interrupted them. In that moment, they were both completely dependent on 8man to stop the club from regressing severely.<br><br>It seems to me that Yukino and Yui have started putting 8man on a pedestal at this point, similarly to how 8man used to with Yukino. Iroha's the only one ho actually treats 8man as an equal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  8man doesn't deserve a poorfag waifu like Iroha.  <br>Thats why Iroha will win.</br>  So when 8man gave the girls scrunchies, did they like them or did they feel indifferent? Did they dislike the gifts?  <br>Bimbo girls are best</br>  <br>no, apparently google translate API is a paid service.

She is trying to win the 8bowl but knows that he isn't ready to open himself yet, that's why she closes the distance between them with the Hayama excuse. However, YY were not being genuine, because both of them have feelings for 8man but are afraid of making any move and breaking the status quo.</br>  <br> spoonfeeding <br> that scene <br>I see what you did there</br></br></br>  <br> I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side. <br> “That’s why, for now…” <br> Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end. <br> She added some spice smeared with sugar. <br> “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.” <br> “You realize that’s like saying it’s okay for me to hate you, right…?” I said, retreating my upper body away from her. Isshiki chuckled. <br><br>Sounds pretty damned straightforward to me. She's sly in method, but in actual terms of her pursuing 8man she's pretty fucking forward about it. <br><br><br> So you said Iroha still love Hayama isn't it? <br> She's been genuine entire time isn't it? <br><br>Try learning proper English and then we'll talk kid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Using lie to get close someone she loved <br> Genuine <br><br>Irohafags logic everyone!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Keep using Hayama as pretense to get close 8man <br>[citation needed]<br><br>She's mentioned 8man as a reference, but has never explicitly used that as a reason for doing something.<br><br>She probably hasn't completely let go of Hayama, no.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please provide LN quotes of Iroha lying.</br>  <br> Uses an excuse that she knows will make 8man put his AT-Field down so that she can hang out and have fun with him <br> Equals not genuine <br><br>Denial, try looking it up. If you're using that as a reason for why Iroha isn't "genuine", then that's pretty stupid. Especially since you can make that argument for all of the bloody girls since they've all used pretenses to hang out with 8man in previous volumes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> because both of them have feelings for 8man but are afraid of making any move and breaking the status quo. <br>Yukino doesn't love 8man. Only Yui loves her Hikki<br><br> that's why she closes the distance between them with the Hayama excuse <br>She actually likes Hayama and not 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just looked at your HTML thing and compared it to my book.<br>It starts off at the 2nd page of the book so it's missing the 1st page.</br></br>  <br>The thing is, she barely even uses Hayama as an excuse in the first place.

Do you anons think friendship end is feasible or will he choose between the two, and how will they even fucking stay friends the guy they likes choosing one of them?  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  <br> _____________You____________ </br>  <br><br>Here's your reply</br></br>  <br>friendship end if volume 12 is the last, or else it would be a very rush yukino end in that case.<br><br>whether they can stay friends afterwards depends on how well 'genuine' is concluded. otherwise if either one leaves they better get a proper conclusion.</br></br></br>  <br>A neutron star</br>  <br>Here is LN quotes:<br><br> Isshiki interpreted that as a response from me and arbitrarily continued her story. “Considering the situation right now, it’s a chance for me. People noooormally give up after confessing, right? Hayama-senpai seems totally sick of the confessions too, so that’s where I can come in as a ‘safe tile’7 and ambush—I mean, I can, like, give him some plump comfort!” <br><br>If she lying about it that's mean she is not genuine.<br><br>If she doesn't lying about it but she just want Hayama. That's mean she doesn't have any feeling with 8man.<br><br>If she doesn't lying about it but she did that to get close with 8man too. That's means she is slut.<br><br>Now choose your poison.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just watched the OP for the latest episode that Commie released.<br><br>Fuck, can someone describe /a/'s reaction to it?</br></br>  <br> Once Yukino solves her problems the plot will probably focus on the love triangle <br><br>Probably, Volume 12 will be Yukino's request and Volume 13 Hachiman's request.</br></br></br>  <br> how will they even fucking stay friends the guy they likes choosing one of them? <br>Neither of them are that hung up on him. Yukino can take his rejection just fine and Yui doesn't shit herself at the thought of losing him.<br><br> Do you anons think friendship end is feasible <br>Yes, Yukino wants genuine to be applicable to, including herself, both 8man and Yui. Yui's idea of genuine is different though. All of this depends on 8man rejecting both.<br><br><br>Most people who read the novel don't think vol 12 is the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see any LN quotes there, anon.</br>  <br>I'm thinking Yukino will win in the end just because Yui has been acting as a bridge between them for the entire series and this would be her final act between them. Not to mention the story basically revolved around 8man and Yukino's relationship and the dynamics between them up until genuine, so it would be pretty likely for her to win. I'm not sure how Yui will feel after losing though</br>  <br><br>There has to be someone who didn't anticipate it. I mean I thought Yui's crush would go away and Yukino wouldn't fall so hard for him.</br></br>  <br>Friendship end is not going to happen, not after volume 11. The whole threesome date was her implying she's leaving the club no matter what happens.</br>  <br>No I mean it when you say you missed a page from the first chapter.<br>Just look at my book.<br>Also I've fixed the lines that were messed up on that page.<br><br><br>Line 2<br> 冬の寒さは未だ厳しく、乾燥した北風が吹き抜けるごとに、教室の窓ガラス<wbr>をがたびしと鳴 らしていた。</wbr> <br><br><br>Line 5<br> 暦の上ではじきに立春。毎年のことながらこの寒さで春とか何言っちゃって<wbr>んだょお前の頭 だけスプリングハズヵムかょと思もののだ。</wbr> <br><br>Line 6<br> が、冬来たりなば春遠からじ、とも言う。 <br><br>Line 7<br> 放課後の教室も少しずつ春めいた雰囲気が漂ってきていた。 あとひと月もしないぅちに暦は啓蟄。 <br><br>Lines numbered based on your 1st txt file.<br>Line 1 being 二月に入つてしばらくのこと。<br>Chapter tile being 冬は、その始まりを知るとき既に過ぎ去っている。</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  OST when.  <br>Does the genuine thing she wants lies in Hayama? No, she doesn't know, she doesn't even know what is the genuine thing she sought. She said that because she want to knows if the genuine thing she sought lies within Hayama. If it is, then 8man won't be hurt because he expects it from her. If it isn't, which most likely because she maybe saw a glimpse of it within 8man (that does explain her act towards 8man), then she finally can drop the Hayama excuse</br>  <br>Who would leave? Yukino explicitly said they still need to do her request and 8man's. <br><br><br> I'm not sure how Yui will feel after losing though <br>She'll be fine, she isn't that hung up on 8man. I get the impression that she has been falling out of love with him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> COMMMIEEEEEEEE!!!!! </br>  <br> Here is LN quotes: <br> quotes a single quote <br>That's not how the plural form works<br><br> If she lying about it that's mean she is not genuine. <br><br> If she doesn't lying about it but she just want Hayama. That's mean she doesn't have any feeling with 8man. <br><br> If she doesn't lying about it but she did that to get close with 8man too. That's means she is slut. <br><br>All this retardation, since you are obviously an ESLfag let me explain this very basic fact concerning the English language.<br><br>The word "genuine" does not mean "not a lie", if you want a word that means "not lying" you use either "real" or "truth". <br><br>The word "genuine" is in relation to but separate from those terms, hence why they are different words.<br><br>In other words you're a retard, and you're arguing with a lot of people who are just on a higher level of intelligence. In other words we have at least the mental capacity of a primary student while you do not.<br><br>Because even 4 year olds are capable of using a dictionary.<br><br><br>Perhaps you should try reading the posts preceding that one anon?

That's what the date was for.</br>  Goddess.  <br> If she doesn't lying about it but she just want Hayama. That's mean she doesn't have any feeling with 8man. <br>She hadn't even been on the date with 8man at that point. She has feelings for 8man but she hasn't given up on Hayama yet either.<br><br>If that's all you have then I can safely conclude you're full of shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would she leave?</br>  <br><br>  unable proving his own point. <br>  calling other people full of shit. <br><br>Where is your proof anon?<br>Where is it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you think the last few episodes were showing</br>  <br>His quote never proved Iroha lied, so I don't need proof.</br>  <br>Ok 👌👌👌👌</br>  <br>Yui trying to make a gambit to get them to be more open with their feelings. In worse case scenario she wanted to prevent Yukino from getting 8man and destroying what they have.</br>  <br>I am asking you for proving this one though <br> <br>You are accused grasping at straw by one anon there</br></br></br>  <br>She bet on 8man to say something for them to follow, instead of just speaking for herself.<br><br>Yui's just as bad off as Yukino at this point. She's entirely dependent on 8man to tell them what is and isn't acceptable.</br></br></br>  <br>Congratulations on someone actually trying to engage you when this is the whole breadth and depth of what your post deserves.</br>  <br>If it was as simple as only being more open with their feelings she wouldn't be staying back and looking sadly at penguins and giving Hachiman and Yukino as much time as she needed, or muttering that it's almost over. She was ready for this to be the last time they would be together.</br>  <br>Neither of those posts are directed at me.

Oh wait, I already do.</br>  <br>Yukino is always ready to slap a ho.<br>Look at her face any time a girl approaches Hachiman.</br></br>  <br>Sorry for omitting descriptive text<br> Senpai, you're late <br> So, why are you here? <br> Yukinoshita-senpai had such an amazing smile at the moment I came, but got dissapointed and was like that whole the time <br> ...Isshiki-san? <br> Well, well. Iroha-chan, are you here for something related with student council? <br> Nah, we got a lot of spare time there unexpectedly <br> What? <br> There are no events right now, and vice president is taking care of routine stuff, so all I have to do is to place the stamp in the end <br> So I'm getting a day off when student council is not so busy <br> Don't you have a club to attend too? <br> ...It's too cold in the soccer club right now <br> Ah, haha... So, what did you want? <br> By the way, Senpai. I don't really care, but do you like sweets? <br> I think Hayama will gladly eat everything <br> Ah, but Hayama said that he doesn't accept chocolate <br> Eh?! Why is that? <br> ...Dunno <br> It's because they end up deputing. At the elementary school, classroom atmosphere was always awkward on the next day. <br> ...Ah <br> ...I kinda understand it <br> Well, I'm okay with Senpai at this rate. Do you like sweets, Senpai? <br> Isn't that question kinda weird? <br> Hikki likes sweets! <br> That's right <br> I wonder why did you two have to answer... Well, that's good! <br> Ah... Wait, what's good? <br> I was wondering how sweet should it be. Aren't preferences different from person to person? <br> How sweet... Isshiki-san, are you going to make it by yourself? <br> Unexpected... <br> Why is that? I'm very good at pastry making <br> So nice. I'd like to master it too but I'm not so good... <br> Yui-senpai. Cooking is all about sincerity. The most important thing in homemade cooking is kindness and feelings. Thoughts about your partner lead the way to the progress. Because your partner is a guy who knows nothing about pastry making.So handmade is easy-peasy. You can get a low-cost mass product, show a little ingenuity and make some individual customizations. The guy will definitely swallow it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's clear that Yukino won the final battle and I feel bad for Yui. She didn't do anything wrong and has stronger feelings for 8man but she has zero chance of winning.  <br> You got off from the road of sympathy... It's more about the wallet than sincerity now. <br> Even thought there is nothing wrong with that way of thinking, this feels bad. <br> I wouldn't be happy with it... <br> Well, that was a joke, I just tried to imitate Senpai... So, i was asking this for reference to make obligatory-gift chocolate. Senpai, what level of sweetness do you prefer? <br> Sweet, huh? Well, that's...　Takes out of the bag MAX coffee can and places it on the table. <br> ...I think I could make some too <br> Idiot, are you kidding, don't underestimate MAX coffee. It's not simply as just adding sugar and condenced milk to it. Stop, for god's sake <br> He got really angry! <br> But that way it will go over budget <br> I don't know how much is she planning to make, but 130yen for one can is a quite severe amount of money <br> It's okay. If you choose store properly and buy in bulk it will be cheaper <br> Just how much does Hikki like MAX coffee... <br> *Crap about the taste of coffee* <br> Ha, Well, I don't really care about that <br> I was just thinking of criteria for obligatory chocolate <br> Obligatory chocolate, huh? <br> Ah, could it be that you never got chocolate senpai? Aren't guys counting how many times they get chocolate? If that number tends to zero it's kinda painful, right? <br> No, that's not true... Was Valentine's day made into some kind of sports competition? <br> Well, in that case... <br> You don't have to worry about that <br> Eh... Could it be that Yukinoshita-senpai <br> Hikigaya doesn't have friends to compete with <br> Oh, I see <br> You don't have to worry... And Hikki does recieve chocolate... Right? <br> Eh..? Does it mean... <br> Fu, that's right... Because I have Komachi! <br> Huh? Komachi? Who's that? Rice? <br> She's not rice <br> Ah, Komachi-chan is Hikki's little sister <br> Oh, that's right, Senpai had little sister <br> Yeah <br> ...Pervert? <br> Idiot, I'm not <br> ...Can't really deny that </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui <br> 0% chance winning <br><br>Don't make laugh anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> As I thought, Senpai does like younger ones <br> No, not really <br> Then... <br>*8man vision ON*<br> Do you... Hate younger ones? <br>8man answers internally: "If I had to choose between hate and like, i would pick I LOVE THEM!"<br> That is really about the way you ask... <br> ...Well, right <br> I'd love my little sister no matter if she was younger or older! <br> That's even worse than being pervert or liking younger girls! <br> And where do you count the years from? School grade? Year of birth? Or do you call younger everyone who's birth date different from yours even on a tiny amount? Terms are not defined. Shouldn't we start from this point? <br> Ah, but I think that Hikki could get along better with a bit older sister, yep! ...Probably. Absolutely <br> That doesn't really matter. Nothing changes if you're just one year apart <br> Eh, is that so? Do you think the same about Hayama-senpai? <br> No, I don't know about that <br> But, but, Senpai, didn't you say earlier that being kouhai gives advantages? <br> Yeah, That's right <br> But actually, you were born in April, so we're less than year apart, so I don't get the feeling of you being younger <br> ... <br> What? <br> Ah, no... I was just surprised a little <br> Why do you know her birthday?! Hikki, creep... Really creepy... <br> ...You know such details <br> No, Didn't she say it by herself that time　vainly showing off her appeal? <br> Vainly?! It wasn't in vain! And it wasn't showing off! It's Senpai who's showing off! <br> It differs with my memory... By the way, if you're done with your business go back to either student council or soccer club <br>Isshiki went out of the room "Yeah, yeah showing off"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She didn't do anything wrong and has stronger feelings for 8man <br>Yui has been falling out of love with him recently. She can stomach him being with Yukino or any girl. She hasn't hitched her herself to him nor does she seek him for validation.</br></br>  <br>I hope 8man realizes why Yui really did what she did.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Man, I wish my moon was good enough for this. I'd translate Irohasu all day.<br>Anyway, thanks a lot brother.</br></br></br></br></br>  puhleeze /a/<br>WHAT THE FUCK IS COMMIE DOING?</br>  <br>That's rather disgusting anon :&lt;</br>  <br>Puhleeze anon, don't pretend you don't like it.</br>  <br>That's just the way our Goddess talks.</br>  When is Orimoto coming back and claiming what is rightfully hers? Yukino and Yui won't mind. <br><br>Seriously though, did she say she was going to give him giri choco?</br></br>  <br> :&lt; </br>  <br> yo'sup </br>  8man should pin either Yui or Yukino down against their will and do what he wills to her body. He should nut inside. <br><br>That'll make one of them fall out of love with him.</br></br>  <br> If anything they'll trigger nice boat </br>  <br>Wow, it's even worse than what the anime showed.<br>Just fuck already.</br></br>  <br> against their will </br>  <br> yo 'sup </br>  <br/>  <br>Konnichiwa</br>  <br> Yui <br> has zero chance of winning <br><br>If you're talking before vol 6 came out, then yes. Too bad, the table has been flipped since.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would that trigger nice boat? Both of them seem well adjusted enough.<br><br><br>Are you implying they would just let him do what he wants?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui has been falling out of love with him recently. <br>That explains why her hands were trembling as she gave him cookies.</br></br>  <br>The love triangle dissolved at the end of volume 11. Why do you think Yui and Yukino smiled at each other as if they confirmed something telepathically?</br>  <br> &gt;Fu, that's right... Because I have Komachi! <br> &gt;Huh? Komachi? Who's that? Rice? <br>Really?</br></br></br>  <br>here's your reply</br>  <br> dissolved  <br>You can't be serious</br></br>  <br>I have to agree with you on this. poorfag waifu can do almost anything (cooking, cleaning, sewing, knitting, handling money...), they also modest and reserved. Real life poorfag might be stingy and having inferiority complex but 2D waifu got none of that.</br>  <br>Rice is kome. Maybe she though it was a brand or something.</br>  <br>Seems more like they agreed to have a peaceful love triangle to me. <br><br>That, plus the fixing of Yukinon's issues next volume can lead to the good ending (if WW want to write one, that is) in which regardless who win, the other girl won't be broken and their  genuine  friendship won't break.</br></br></br>  <br>See you at the end of volume 39 when this series finally ends with yaoi.</br>  <br>They're doing it a lot in the past. Are they not allowed now?</br>  <br>Those smiles weren't genuine.</br>  <br>They evolved. Instead of talking they are making-out telepathically now. In front of 8man. That was lewd, shouldn't be allowed.</br>  <br>They had that already during the choco event and Haruno called their shit. no way they're going back there.</br>  I haven't wanted a threesome end this much before.<br>Both girls deserve to win but I know they won't ;_;</br>  <br>She was nervous. It is nerve-racking to give someone cookies.<br><br><br>How weren't they? They agreed that the triangle is nonsense and that neither one of them is that much in love with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off jesus christ<br><br>They agree for ceasefire, but they will never stop loving 8man because it's what 8man wanted and expect from them.</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't acknowledging their "rivalry" back then and tried to ignore the issue. That seems similar, but is different from current situation now. Now, they acknowledged both are in love with 8man, but aren't going to go for a bloody war then will end up destroying everything.</br>  <br>Your friendship end bias is showing.</br>  <br><br><br>Sorry for replying this late, I was too busy fixing some css and javascript.

Might as well squeeze in Asuka's parent problems to make her a mess for more drama.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are allowed to make jokes, you know. Calm down. When you see people calling Asuka a sociopath or how Kaori only thinks about Asuka, do you also consider those posts IRC shitposting? It's the same kind of joke, exaggerating a person's personality trait for the sake of humor.</br>  <br>Sounds expensive and experimental.

Contrabass because it just sounds fucking rad.</br></br></br>    <br><br>TRANSLATION</br></br>  <br>But everyone knows that oboe is the most special instrument.</br>  lol is shoeshit gets with kumiko this show retroactively become shit. they didn't even have a developed relationship. not even a yurfag tbh  <br> Oboe-chan featured prominently not only in the ep, but in the preview <br>二期決定！！</br></br>  <br> All those notations <br>I remember writing down important reminders and corrections/revisions from my band instructor but not nearly to this extent.</br></br>  <br><br> so much salt <br><br>The episode haven't even aired yet, calm your tits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, when I was in symphony, if you wrote anything except necessary corrections/notations or wrote them in anything but light pencil, the conductor would strangle you.</br>  <br>everyone is wearing special ribbons, Midori has one too</br>  <br>S2 or movie about Oboe lipstick-chan confirmed.</br>  <br>Taki-sensei is very particular about how you play. And don't touch his blankets.</br>  <br>Why would it matter? As long as you play it correctly it should be fine.</br>  <br><br> Ribbon's is best friends with both Natsuki and Mizore <br>why do we hate her again?</br></br></br>  <br>Because you had to return all your sheet music after the current contest/concert/season/semester/etc<wbr>. was complete.</wbr></br>  <br><br><br> Shuichi standing-up and not sitting besides Kumiko <br><br>HAHA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> why do we hate her again? <br><br>because Ribbons a  shit </br></br></br>  <br>What, that's dumb. You should be able to keep it.</br>  <br>Because she acted on her emotions, and that confused and agitated us.</br>  <br>She even sacrifice her dignity to fullfil her beloved senpai wish<br><br>She is the hero than no one deserve</br></br></br>  <br>I'll comfort her and tell her that everything is going to be okay.</br>  <br>My school was the same way. The sheet music isn't printed on 8.5x11 paper, so they had to keep it since making copies would be expensive and dumb.</br>  <br>keep dreaming</br>  <br><br><br>Anyone?</br></br></br>  <br>The school has to pay for copies of the sheet music (and to perform it) so they are damn sure going to get their sheet music back. And they don't let students copy the music because it's copyrighted (as if a student is going to go perform it outside of school functions...). At least that's how it was at my high school.</br>  I wish we knew what adventures these two have been on, they're wayyy too chummy  <br>What would Mizore look like with a ponytail?</br>  <br>Trumpet looks really simple just three buttons</br>  <br>It's pretty obvious what they're saying.</br>  <br>have they literally said anything to each other the whole season so far</br>  <br> Asuka: Such a fun time is going to end. If only summer could continue on like this forever <br> Goto: Don't worry, it'll be fine <br> Reina: Good luck on the performance <br> Midori: I'm so excited! <br> Shuuichi: I said it'll be fine, we've practiced so hard <br> Taki sensei: are the preparations for the performance done? <br> Kumiko: We'll definitely go to Nationals <br> Haruka: KITACHUIII, FWAITOOO <br><br>basically everyone but Natsuki says something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They seemed close enough in episode 11. Who knows what they get up to when everyone else is playing in front of Taki.</br>  <br>they can't mash anything together because every volume is its own tournament (Kansai and Nationals are after Kyoto). You can't fit volume 3 drama into volume 2 because each drama leads to their own resolution at the end of the tournaments</br>  <br>fucking hell they're so tiny</br>  <br> Asuka <br>That sounded like Aoi.</br></br>  <br>Here you go.<br><br>あんなに楽しかった時間が終わっちゃうんだよ。ずっとこのまま夏が続けばい<wbr>いのに<br>Such fun times are coming to an end. If only this summer could go on forever...<br><br>大丈夫。うまくいく。<br>It's OK. It will go well.<br><br>本場、頑張ろうね。<br>Let's do our best at the competition.<br><br>みどり、めちゃくちゃ楽しみなんです！<br>I [Midori] had so much fun!<br><br>大丈夫だって。<br>I said it would be OK.<br><br>あんなに練習したんだからさ。<br>After all, you practiced so much.<br><br>会場を「わっ！」と言わせる準備はできましたか？<br>Are you prepared to make them say "Wah!" at the competition?<br><br>絶対に、全国に行く<br>We will definitely go to the Nationals.<br><br>北宇治ファイト！<br>Kitauji, FIGHT!<br><br>Ribbon a cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>she's dead, let it go</br>  <br><br> Shuuichi: I said it'll be fine, we've practiced so hard <br><br>Shoe stepping confirmed.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tell Kumiko everything is going to be diejoebu <br> she steps on your foot </br></br>  <br>Finally, I can be released from KyoAni's wild ride.</br>  what did Gotou say to Riko?  <br>You don't pay very good attention.</br>  <br>You don't get to tell me what to do.</br>  will you miss her?  <br><br>Sweaty couch sex after the competition</br></br>  <br> I like tuba. </br>  <br> After this is over let's get married </br>  <br>She will live on in my dreams  until S2/movie </br>   the fagotts get a PV shot <br>based  left </br>  <br> みどり、めちゃくちゃ楽しみなんです！ <br> I [Midori] had so much fun! <br>Shit, I messed that one up.<br>"I'm really looking forward to it!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at her, her face is broken. She can't even put on a fake smile anymore but still does the genki hand motions.</br>   tfw they're not going to make it nationals in typical Kyoani bait style   <br><br> yfw Asuka is kill </br></br>  I had dream where I was in my middle school days picking an instrument for band. Right when I was gonna pick the French Horn (which I did play irl) I remembered this show and picked the euphonium. Fucking Kyoani infecting my mind.  <br>I want to cum inside Kumiko before she meets up with Reina to have oral sex performed on her so that Reina gets a creampie NTR surprise when she's about to go down on Kumiko. She tries to back away in horror but just then Kumiko grabs her head and squeezes her cheeks and forces her tongue out into her pussy to lick it all out of her pussy.</br>  <br>"If we make Regionals I want your virginity"<br><br> &gt;Implying those two are virgins </br></br></br>  This show needs a second season. Please KyoAni, please.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/blogspot/</br>  would you rather have a s2 announced at the end of episode 13 or Bakuon announced done by Kyoani?   Kumiko was gunning for the trombones when she first joined the band <br> If she picked them she would have been section mates with Shuu1 for all of high school <br> Would have practiced together, talked with one another, possibly grow their friendship into something more. <br> Instead she ended up picking her first love UFO-kun. <br><br>Shuu1 was LITERALLY NTRed by a euphonium from the beginning, Shuu1 BTFO</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have have an Amagi s2. As much as I enjoyed Hibike, I enjoyed Amagi far more.</br>  Is there material for a season 2 or is this where the story ends?  <br>three volumes + sidestories<br><br>first season only covered ONE volume<br><br>so we have enough material for a s2 and a movie</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is enough material for 2, possibly even 3 more seasons.</br>  <br><br>thanks very much</br></br>  <br>So, who is that supposed to be in the background of Vol 2's cover?</br>  <br>Oh, shit. Kumiko is going to drop the stomps.</br>  <br>Kumiko, Reina, Asuka, Oboe-chan, Oboe-chan's friend.</br>  <br>Huh. I thought people were joking about them being relevant</br>  Natsuki has been embraced by the genki, and I'm totally fine with it. <br><br>Hopefully that means more banter.</br></br>  <br>I hope kyoani will continue it.</br>  <br>Mizore is pretty relevant. Even in the season where she doesn't say anything she has more screentime than Midori</br>  <br>I wonder if Natsuki took Hazuki to WcDonalds.</br>  <br>Isn't that the same flutist that got chewed out by Taki early on?</br>  The last image is two girls holding hands. Who are the girls?  <br>You are not a smart man.</br>  <br>shorter ponytail</br>  <br>No, she quit the band last year.</br>  Fuck, he doesn't have a hot dog. Shit is getting real. <br><br><br>They probably go on Nichijou levels of adventure.</br></br></br>  <br>TYBKA<br>Y<br>B<br>K<br>A</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably girls from the flute section, they're a really tight group and prone to crying</br>  Last part of the preview is Kumiko blushing during the competition.<br><br>What is she thinking of?</br></br>  <br>since when was Shuuichi so dreamy?</br>  <br>So are the girls behind her</br>  <br><br>Taki sensei in a suit</br></br>  There really are going to force the romance.  Kumiko about to fuck some trick ass niggas up.  <br>Their going on stage its a given that she's shy.</br>  would lolis have saved euphonium   Finish reading first novel <br> Unsure of whether to start second or wait for an anime adaptation since KyoAni has almost objectively been telling the story better </br>  <br>They finally animated his character nicely.</br>  <br> Only if the euphonium was the loli. </br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>Good directors, and Kumiko-centric POV is shit.</br>  <br>why is Taki sensei such a big deal?</br>  <br>does Green Mayoi not count? She's even smaller than Pink Mayoi</br>  <br> green mayoi <br>wait damn what is this from. i only watched bakemono &amp; kizumono  and mayoi is my favorite &lt;3 </br></br>  <br>Amagi Brilliant Park has a red Mayoi.<br>Someone at Kyoani must be a fan of SHAFT's.</br></br>  <br>where's green mayoi from? and what are the characters names, red and green?  i haven't seen Amagi or anything </br>  I dropped this show a few episodes ago, but I can't wait until they reveal an ending that we'll be talking about for the next five years.  <br>Green Mayoi is from this show, her name is Lala but she's a background character<br><br>Red Mayois from Amagi and her name is Shiina</br></br></br>   Shuuichi is back for real    Shipgirls  beat Kitauji in the competition.  <br>welp, time to watch both i guess. thanks<br> is there loli fanservice </br></br>  <br>no, they're very minor characters to begin with and their very little screentime is spent being cute but not sexy</br>  <br>There's a wrestling scene with her in the OVA.</br>  <br>requesting webm</br>   last episode is the rise of shoeman <br><br><br>HYPE</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the blue towel.</br></br>  <br>Your post is literally what's going to happen.</br>  <br> tfw no red mayoi arc <br>If only we get s2.</br></br>  <br><br> Fuck, he doesn't have a hot dog <br><br>it's on his breast pocket covered by the towel.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>seconding</br></br>  soooooo...<br><br>the main character and the trumpet girl are totally gay for each other, right? Because it really REALLY looks that way</br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Nah, Asuka was the one who forced her to take euphonium. Maybe that's why He didn't like her.</br>  <br>That's just bait, both of them have male love interests.</br>  <br>you're so full of shit</br>  <br> being this delusional </br>  <br>It's in all likelihood just bait. With any luck we might get something conclusive tomorrow.</br>  I will personally import 2 copies of the blu rays if they have sex  How would you encourage Kumiko right before the big bash?  <br><br>Like a dream</br></br>  <br>Either ignore her or shout at her from a distance. Works every time.</br>  In the first of these two scenes, he seems to be right next to Kumiko's seat so they're probably talking. This might be the encouragement scene. They're traveling by train and chatting. She's nervous and he tells her it's going to be daijobu. It doesn't need to be a romantic scene.<br><br>In the second one, they're not showing Kumiko at all. The scene might be just bait, there is no certainty that the two are talking together, Kumiko might be just throwing a quick glance at him.</br></br>  <br> hetbait </br>  <br><br>Encouragement scene happens before they perform not in the train. The first one may be anime original.</br></br>  <br>That's what I meant. They might cut the novel encouragement scene and make the anime original train scene the encouragement scene.</br>  <br><br>Feeling nervous, yurifag?</br></br>  <br>shouldn't you be posting this on /u/?</br>  <br><br>I highly doubt that.</br></br>  another waifufagott from 2ch, his waifu is forehead ribbon<br> tfw these idiots printscreen </br>  <br>forehead glasses*<br><br>forehead ribbon is someone else. 2ch has this amusing list of nicknames for all of the side characters.</br></br></br>  <br>How are Japs reacting to preview?</br>  forehead ribbon plays horn  <br>everyone is thinking the Mizore screenshot means s2 is happening.<br><br><br>yes</br></br></br></br>  You know after reading all the novel spoilers.

You could probably count the Shu x Kumiko shippers with your own fingers.</br></br></br>  <br> 420Hz <br>That's super low, I've seen Baroque chamber players do this thing of playing with time replicas and tunings at 432 or so, but never as low as 420.</br></br>  <br> unironic shipping </br>  <br> shipping <br>It's probably for the best that the writers don't pander to you and your kind.</br></br>  <br>But I like taki X reina</br>  <br>Because Reina loves Taki and Kumiko grows to like Shuuichi eventually. It's just the way the cookie crumbles son.</br>  <br><br> most popular ship <br><br>And this is why winning against a popular ship will be so satisfying. The salt and tears produced will accommodate me for a life-time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hanada Jukki <br>I can't believe this is the fag who worked on Chuu2 and Shitcolle.</br></br>  What was the point of all that yuri bait?  <br>Make me happy</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mWO<wbr>uUdymjeI</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Shameful, what a slacker.</br>  <br>¥¥¥</br>  <br>If you have to ask, you'll never understand.</br>  <br><br>I can't believe this was uncensored, such wanton carnality!<br><br> Who do you think is holding who here anon? </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> I have shit taste but excuse it by saying "you guys are shippers SO THERE" </br></br></br>  <br>She has a cute voice, but doesn't deserve a song full of so many fart noises.</br>  <br> That Reina autism face <br> Cumiko's head is much too small. <br><br>Why is this allowed? Why don't they just use screencaps, which look better 99% of the time?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Salty.</br></br>  <br>That's what she gets for playing the chuba. It's exactly what she deserves.  And I love it. </br>  <br>Sheckels</br>    Why is she so perfect, /a/nons?  <br><br>Wouldn't that backfire?<br>They might get sales for the first volume, but for all the other volumes that are released after the show finishes airing?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Wouldn't that backfire? <br><br>Nips apparently like yuri bait. Hence why Kyoani can get away with it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko pls</br>  <br>But she isn't.</br>  <br> Kumiko's c/w song tacitly about Reina <br> Hazuki's c/w song tacitly about Shuu <br>I'll guess then that Reina's second song will be about Kumiko and Peridot's will be about  chuuba-kun. </br></br></br>  <br>I just can't take her character seriously.<br>Whenever I think of her I imagine the dumb face she's making in  and how cute it would be to do stuff like   </br></br>  <br>People eat that shit up, pluS if kyoani starts rawdogging their own original story everyone will be hyped for s2/movie potential  but not even remotely likely  Yuri shit.</br>  <br><br> Hazuki's c/w song tacitly about Shuu <br><br>What's the lyrics?</br></br></br></br>  If there's anything I learned from yurifags is not to celebrate early. I'm gonna wait for the episode to actually air and then rub it into people's faces.  <br>The dialogue in the preview pretty much confirms that it's mostly sticking to the novel so not much will get resolved either way. Kumiko and Shu1 will just get the innocent foot-stomp-banter-encouragement scene and that will be it.</br>  <br>About a girl in love.</br>  <br>Will they really keep the foot-stomp? I don't know about how it is in the novels, but that really doesn't sound like something anime Kumiko would do.</br>  Reina's song will be a 10 minutes long poem where she expresses all her feelings for taki with trumpets trying to imitate the sound of bomgoes in the background  <br>I don't think so either, since Kumiko doesn't really have much to still be mad at Shuu about anymore.

You literally have no right to speak of rebellion if you haven't watched it</br></br></br>  One piece  I'm not trying shitpost or anything, this is a genuine question. I've seen so many people praise KyoAni as the pinnacle of anime. Though content wise these have been adapting series with mediocre writing. Animation wise they look appealing but it isn't considered good animation because it mostly backgrounds, shot with massive amounts of light everywhere. And it's known that KyoAni have below average production values. Now they do have a few gems such as Haruhi, Disappearance Movie, Full Metal Panic especially Fumoffu, and Hyouka which can be subjective because the story is really boring depending on the person. However they do adapt a lot of mediocre series that have terrible writing in it.<br><br>Now I'm not saying KyoAni is a bad Studio because they are far from it, but why do some people think they are the best Studio? If you look at their content it says otherwise.</br></br>  Because plebs like digital filters and over-animated turd.  <br>Just imagine how would look Yahari's last episode of KyoAni had animated it.</br>  <br>Shit?<br>Yahari season 2 is already better animated than anything KyoAni ever made.</br></br>  Because Clannad and Haruhi  <br>Kyani is a good studio, not my favourite but still. <br>Like comedy show.</br></br>  <br>No it is not. Kyoani doesn't have one thing, creativity.</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  <br>Yahari have sakuga animators.<br>KyoAni doesn't.</br></br>  <br> why do some people think they are the best Studio <br>It's not. Ufotable is.</br></br>  <br> over-animated </br>  <br>Why are the eyes so suck before 2008 ?</br>  <br>Look at this and tell me it isn't over-animated.</br>  <br> Why Do Some People Like Things I Don't Like: The Thread </br>  <br> Ufotable <br>Ufotable is easily the most over-rated studio, yes.</br></br>  They are the Nintendo of /a/.  <br>go back to your cancer thread yaharifag</br>  Oh boy another studio war thread. <br>Can't wait for all the "lol kyoanus moeshit" shitpost.</br>  Why are half the posts in this thread, including the OP, written like it was an ESL at the keyboard?  <br>how were they allowed to get away with that 2005 face</br>  <br><br> animation in an animated medium is bad </br></br>  Nichijou is conveniently missing from your image and argument, so that's why you don't know.  <br>Because Key.</br>  <br>Keyshit designs.</br>  <br>This should be the norm, instead shitty studios skip frames and put shitty in between animation and people think it's actually acceptable.</br>  <br>You're over-retarded</br>  <br>Its Key shit, what do you expect? They fixed the faces by now, but overall still same shit.<br><br>Charlotte by PA Works this season is another revival of that cancer. Thanks God KyoAni stopped whoring themself to them.<br><br>Also, if you think thats ugly - see Higurashi.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's distracting from the most important element of any storytelling medium, the story.</br>  <br>It isn't over-animated.</br>  <br>The only bad thing I see is some poor movement of the characters relative to the background early on when she starts running.</br>  <br> over-animated <br>god damn you're retarded</br></br>  <br>It's not the work of the animators to fix shitty scripts</br>  <br>What about Full Metal Panic though? It's in 2003 and still has good animated eyes.</br>  They're not even the best modern studio.  <br>Why are you even watching anime in the first place? Read the LNs or manga if you don't like pictures moving, faggot.</br>  <br>Holy shit, you're too much of a pleb for LN adaptations about high schoolers playing instruments. I didn't think this was possible.</br>  <br>I wonder where they took the photo shoots for this scene.</br>  <br>That's like saying literature would be better as powerpoint slides of the plot and themes in bulletpoints because prose is distracting.</br>  <br>meh, $hinbo's gimmicky animation style gets old quite fast</br>  <br> before 2008 <br>K-On! eyes aren't better. Only good eyes KyoAni ever produced are Hyouka and now Euphonium.</br></br>  <br> anime <br> storytelling medium <br><br>Top b8</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't dislike animation.<br>I hate when it's done poorly and unbalanced.</br></br>  <br> I'm not trying shitpost or anything <br>Yes you are.</br></br>  <br>Because they didn't have a style that made money back then. Keyshit gave them money so they keep doing that even in other anime (see haruhi 2006) after that k-on was the one who made money so they kept doing that kind of designs after that (see harui 2009 or hyouka) <br>Amagi and Hibike are dfiferent though.</br></br>  <br>They did.<br>KyoAni traces photo.</br></br>  <br>Then you must love KyoAni, they rarely do it poorly and always retain the same quality all around their series.</br>  <br>Literally everything is better than am I kawaii uguu. Fucking Aku no Hana's faces were still better than that.</br>  <br>Its Uji, the small town Kyoto Animation itself is located. If you paid attention Hibike school is "KitaUJI", its located in same time.<br><br>Thats one of main reasons KyoAni picked about this novel in the first place - since its written by local about the area they work and live.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how that one would look with one of those 60fps interpolators.</br>  <br>Some people say that KyoAni anime have bad writing. I disagree, they're only simple, and being simple doesn't make something bad. <br>Yesterday I was watching Sora no Woto and started to think about what would be if it had a more simple writing, without those events, like Kanata's fever in episode 3 to deliver exposition. Regularly anime writing have plenty of well know events and situations, but KyoAni have the capacity to make these things more subtle, hence the accusations about nothing happening towards some shows.</br></br>  <br>I thought Tamako did pretty well in that department.</br>  <br> Euphonium <br>Too bad they fucked up on the cheeks with that pinkish dot shit. Looks like they have cancer.</br></br>  <br> shit isn't just flapping mouths, slow pans behind the heads and detail shots of the face <br> has more than once scene and 3 shots per minute <br> over-animated <br><br>Over-animated sounds like an oxymoron anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  HARUHI S3<br>FULL METAL PANIC S3<br><br>NEVER<br>EVER!<br><br>NEVER <br>EVER!<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>Thanks for your attention.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> done poorly <br>That was quite well done, though.<br><br><br>I think I would have some sort of seizure trying to watch it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One of the animation professors I had back in college was ex-Disney, he was a 2D animator who worked on a lot of their films for years and years. He started there in the early '80s when Bluth still worked at Disney, and he hated Bluth. He distinctly remembers Don Bluth having a group of friends/followers in a sort of clique in the animation department, who were very haughty and unpleasant to everybody else. The group also liked to 'outdo' each other with their animation, trying to trump each other with intricacy and stuff. The whole group left with Bluth when he did.<br><br>My prof still wanted to give him a chance and went to see Secret Of NIMH in theaters when it came out, but he walked out after about ten minutes. His reason: "The damn crow wouldn't stop moving". He always stressed how there was a time and place for certain animation and how animators needed to know when to NOT animate, and Bluth's over-animation of everything drove him crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>There is some videos when you see where Kyoani took their photos. <br>There is one for Hibike.</br></br>  <br>You're like that guy who calls people tryhards if they put any amount of effort into something.</br>  <br>Complaining about "moeshit" in Kyoani anime is old, the new hotness is shitposting about "forced drama" and "forced animation".</br>  <br>Good old MS Paint VNs.</br>  <br>Your teacher tastes in animation don't mean shit in the grand scheme of things.</br>  <br>Buy a book faggot. Story shouldn't be the only reason to watch something animated. Unless you are idiot.</br>  KyoAni's animation is like Micheal Bay's movie.<br>KyoAni is trying too hard to make everything look pretty and fluid.<br>But when you made everything special, nothing is special.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2TH<wbr>Vvshvq0Q</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  The only thing I would call "forced animation" or "over-animation" were some of Nichijou's gags.  <br>Ufotable is like Michael bay, all filters and action.<br>Kyoani is like Nolan, all filters and PRETENTIOUS storytelling.</br></br>  <br> But when you made everything special, nothing is special. <br>The struggle is real... <br>So the right thing to do is only do well one and another scene and let everything else look sakuga?</br></br></br>  <br>Nichijou has a lot visual gags... so why would you want to make them worse?</br>  <br>Sounds like he felt slighted somehow and had to make up something to complain about.</br>  <br> let everything else look sakuga <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br>I agree with Ufotable-Bay. I don't agree with KyoAni-Nolan - Nolan's pretentiousness (which is pretty minor compared to a lot of other filmmakers, to be honest) is in his plots' sense of self-importance, not really his style, and KyoAni's plots don't really pretend to be important.</br>  <br>Gee, it's almost like the point of most of the gags in Nichijou was to make simple, mundane things be so over-the-top that it was ridiculous</br>  <br> KyoAni <br> Pretentious storytelling <br><br>What? Was K-On, Amagi or Nichijou too complex for your little brain that you need to call them pretentious?</br></br></br></br>  <br> pretentious <br>Outside of perhaps Hyouka, I don't see how anything done recently by KyoAni could be labelled pretentious.</br></br>  <br>KyoAni`s difference from other studios is - they love what they do. Animation, characters, stories they do.<br><br>Others just forced to slave work on whatever given to them not giving a fucks and if possible pushing it all on north korean slaves.<br><br>So no, from begining, KyoAni is the antipod to the "hollywood" like Tokyo anime industry.<br><br>They are rural, indie "we do what we want!" studio. Also success made them grow to one of biggest studios in industry.<br><br>Madhouse can make 1 anime they like in X years, doing shit rest of time (not to forget 7 years of hand drawn animation!!). KyoAni can do it every season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember everyone. <br><br><br>Inability to handle even minor amounts of sensory stimulation is a common trait of autism. It's why so many autists have to keep the walls of their rooms completely blank.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kyoani <br> Pretentious storytelling <br>You w0t</br></br></br>  They are consistent in terms of quality.<br>And they have cute girls.<br>Not my personal favorite but if it has the Kyoani name I'll most likely watch it.</br></br>  <br>But Hyouka was pretty straighforward</br>  <br>I personally think it's the expressions that moves my heart. It's subtle, yet it can makes me feel how exactly the character feels currently. <br><br>Even in K-ON, for example, when they first go to the stage, you can feel how the audiences below are very silent and although the HTT girls are smiling, it's apparent that all of them looks pretty nervous.<br><br>They don't need to make the girls saying/monologuing "I-I-I'm nervous, doushio?" on the stage. You can FEEL it from the atmosphere and their subtle expressions (although they are keeping their smiles).</br></br></br></br></br>  Chapter 124 in color<br>http://imgur.com/a/RwhkJ<br><br>Cooked anything recently, /a/?</br></br></br>  I love this spread.  Whats so dangerous about Souma's hujiao bing?  So Souma's making steamed buns?  <br>JIBUN WOO</br>  <br>man this looks delicious</br>  <br>I can't cook shit .<br><br>To lazy to learn.</br></br></br>  Spread reminded that Risa Taneda sounds like an angel and I want to hear her do a falsetto again as Erina.  So I just noticed, the flashback is to Souma in his first year of primary school, and he doesn't have the scar. Did we already know he didn't get it until after he was old enough for elementary school?  <br>It's never that hard. I just made a bowl of ice cream</br>  <br>This. What exactly does hujiao bing have that dispels mabo tofu?<br><br>Relief against the spiciness?</br></br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>Why cook when you can have other people do it for you?</br>  So what is rooster planning?<br><br>Sabotage?</br></br>  <br>He has it here. I wonder if there's an important story behind it.</br>  lol  <br><br>a dark chef tried to kill soma but his mom loved him so much it rebounded and killed dark chef leaving a scar on his forehead</br></br>  <br>Probably will have to do with his mom dying or something</br>  <br>Shit, you're right. Back story when?</br>  <br>Good eye. So he got it between his 1st and 4th years of primary school.</br>  Now I'm wondering what else I missed.<br><br>Fuck redrawing, how do people do it?</br></br>  <br> In Italy the children wait until Epiphany, January 6, for their presents. According to tradition, the presents are delivered by a kind ugly witch called Befana on a broomstick. It was said that she was told by the three kings that the baby Jesus was born, she was busy and delayed visiting the baby. <br> She missed the Star lost her way and has been flying around ever since, leaving presents at every house with children in case he is there. She slides down chimneys, and fills stockings and shoes with good things for good children and it is said leaves coal for children who are not so good. <br>Interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>Primary 1 Souma is the cutest.

There was just too much of it. <br><br>We're on ch 124 right now, for now the arc has literally been half of the manga's serialization. That's insane.<br><br> Depending on who you ask, many will also blame this on why Erina's screen time and development has been so lackluster. It's hard for her to be involved in the arc when she's relegated to an observer role for the entirety of it. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nigger <br>Was there any reason to have that word in your post?</br></br>  <br>Season 2 is going to kill Season 3 in the womb if it's all tournament.</br>  <br>Go back to tumblr</br>  <br>Anon, we are all niggers on 4chan.<br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/ </br></br>  <br>why'd you spoiler that?</br>  <br>Ehh it depends on how they do it<br><br>As long as they space out the battles with stuff like erina and alice's swimathon and only have 1 episode each for the first round battles it should be fine</br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't offend me in anyway it just makes you look like a child.</br></br>  <br> J.C.

She's childish at heart, but she knows deep down Souma's talent is extraordinary, to the point it impresses her, but she'll keep stubbornly denying it and act all oujo-sama towards him because of her superiority complex. <br><br>I can't wait for their eventual shokugeki and when she admits defeat, it will be   delicious  .</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooked the eggs benedict with salmon roe, it was surprisingly good. That one addition makes it taste like an entirely different meal, like a fishy seafood version. I served it to someone who had never tried it or seen the anime beside a plain version, he really liked the roe more.<br><br>I have almost never cooked in my life, youtube gordon ramsay and you can really do some amazing shit.

Otherwise it looks pretty good.</br>  <br>So extra saltiness makes eggs benedict taste real good? I've had regular buffet eggs benedict and it was the most impressive meal I had in that one buffet I can't remember where.</br>  <br>Shit looks budget as fuck bro.</br>  <br>What  said.

Its deceptively hard, so we didn't exactly nail it. We couldnt find pickled plum sauce and tried with regular plum sauce, it was moderately refreshing rice but didnt have the kick it needed.Our steak also turned out shit and tough because of a poor tenderizing process and forgetting to cut slits in the meat. But now that I have said everyone that has gone wrong, let me be blunt.<br><br>This recipe is fucking AMAZING.<br><br>The anime reactions are 100% accurate with literally no exaggeration, we were fucking shoveling these onions down and the dish just kept begging us to eat faster and faster. I just ate literally the best onions in my entire life. If you can nail the plum sauce rice, and even make a quarter decent steak, this can easily be your big guns showoff recipe. Like holy shit, I can't even express how accurate the anime taster reactions are. The refreshing rice balances out what would normally be a heavy handed taste.<br><br>If I had one major tip for anyone trying this dish yourself: DONT MAKE ENOUGH. Next time I will half the steaks I buy. It's the kind of food that will have you crawling back for more, but if you make a fuck ton and eat it all at once until you cant eat anymore, it loses its appeal and can even get dissatisfying pretty quickly. Treat it like oil and only let people have it in small amounts, then promise them some more next time.<br>timestamp 11:52 for our reaction while eating the onion sauce also smells fucking delicious <br>https://<span>youtu.be/4j202mFMGAA?t=711  [ ]</br>  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Especially naked apron sempai putting his all into the song. I wish I had a sempai like him in high school, not even gay.</br>  <br>He is talented in the sense that he worked hard and gained a good level of mastery in the kitchen, but he's nor naturally gifted (like erina or currynigger) nor has an outstanding talent for cooking.</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br> The reactions are 100% accurate <br>So you and your friend let out 20+ years wort of semen while eating it?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Thats because it is budget as fuck bro. Like I said earlier, the sauce was perfect but as we cooked the eggs it really started to clump up and turn to shit, we thought all was ruined until we discovered the adding hot water trick. So it's not perfect, but it still tastes amazing and for my first eggs benny in history I think a little thick sauce is ok. The other thing I would improve is more pork, thin ham slices werent enough you need a real chunk of meat to get the most out of it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Rice looks terrible. Meat and onions look all right.<br><br>You're right about having too much meat. That thick slab looks like a fucking monster. compared to everything else.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yes we did. Shit was unreal.</br>  <br>It's not just saltiness, it gives it a fishy taste. It's almost like seafood eggs benny.</br>  <br>I need to try this at some point.<br>While it isn't going to look like the animu counterpart, is it possible to make the onions maintain their golden colour after frying them in wine. It'd look much nicer.<br>Also, you added too much water to the rice</br></br></br>  <br>Also when she finds out who Souma's dad is.</br>  <br>Yeah I suck at rice. As for the onions, I really think that would be a challenge and that they exaggerated in the anime. Keep in mind the sauce consists of meat juice, red wine, and burnt soy sauce. No matter how you cook the onions those are pretty dark ingredients. I could be wrong, but i think you'd have to add something to color it. The spring onions on top might make it look nicer though.</br>  <br> Yeah I suck at rice. <br>4:5 rice-to-water ratio in a rice cooker always seems to work for me.</br></br>  Bro I just want the dad making a surprise appearance and saving souma in a drastic situation. Everyone would be flipping out by the sight of him and everything and his father would probably have make some plain af dish but would make the people tasting it jizz more than souma could make them  <br>Ah yeah, the soy sauce. I forgot about that.<br>It'd probably be doable if you put the soy sauce in with the rice instead. If you then caramelised the onions and didn't go too mad with the red wine, I think you could make those onions have a bit of gold in them. It'd be good to try it out, though properly caramelising onions takes a lot longer.<br><br>For the rice, just try to get the water ratio right. Apparently, you should have around 1.5-1.75 times as much water as rice volume wise when cooking. The longer the grain, the more water you'll need. But you also need to make sure you don't cook it for too long. 10 minutes I find is a good length of time. Around 15mins and you start getting mushy crap.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think moving the soy sauce would work. The soy sauce is part of what makes the onions godlike, you dont wanna fuck with those onions anon. Putting it in the rice also removes the refreshing zest that they give to balance out the dish, and would make the entire thing heavy like nikumis dish was.<br><br>Also I want to reiterate, don't settle for plum sauce. It has to be pickled plum.</br></br></br>  <br>That actually sounds tasty.</br>  <br>Does the zest from the soy sauce come from frying it? if so, then yeah, I can understand not wanting to put it on the rice alone.<br><br>you really want to maintain a salty kick from the onions, then the only other thing I could think of to improve the colour and also buff the onions is frying it with hoisin instead. It's nowhere near as darkening and also has a great sweetness which both boosts the caramelised onion's sweetness and also pairs with the steak brilliantly</br></br></br>  <br>Would frying the onions with honey work?</br>  <br>Nononono, the zest is in the rice. Thats the refreshing kick. The soy sauce deepens and makes the flavor heavy and... umami. Watch the original clip, its exactly like the judges describe it. I recommend trying to make it once before tweaking, the hoisin really sounds like a good way to try on your second cook though.</br>  <br>You don't know until you try :) Post the result tomorrow.</br>  <br> italy  <br> no custom about Santa <br>Lies!</br></br></br>  <br>Prelims were fun as fuck</br>  <br>Have a try. It would certainly make the dish very sweet. Just make sure you add it late, or it'll caramelise and burn</br>  <br>Ah of course. Good point. Rice really is a different beast when it's got soy sauce mixed in.</br>  <br><br>Megumi is too precious</br></br>  What's with Yugi's scary look on Souma this chapter? Do you think that he realized what he's doing and thought of countermeasures?  <br>He recognized the oven. Also, reasonably, he's not going to be an idiot. So it's certainly likely that he's already though up plans.</br>  <br>truly a besy</br>  <br>best*</br>  Translation never  Nikumi a Shit  <br> You a shit </br>  <br>truth</br>  <br><br>You is best girl. Don't hate.</br></br>  <br>Index? Oh wait.</br>  <br>inb4 its revealed there was a childhood rivalry with Souma, about attaining recognition from Jouichirou surpassing him as a chef but she has since forgotten his face.<br><br>Gonna get Nisekoi'ed.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow, the girls are practically Hinako and Fuyumi.</br>  <br><br> loli hair mandibles <br><br>what happens if you pull loli Erina's hair mandibles?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Now that's too cliche and it's not gonna happen. Erina looks a bit too old in the pic and if she could remember Jouichiro back then she would remember a childhood friend. She remembers her squabbles with Alice when they were 5 years old. So nope.</br>  <br>Although Souma can be just a guy served an impressive entry dish, could grandpa know Souma already since Jouichirou was hired?</br>  <br>Shell probably try to hit and kick at you.</br>  <br><br>her wig will fag</br></br>  <br>Her bodyguards jump you.</br>  <br><br>*fall</br></br>  <br><br> Joichiro says the secret to being a great cook is having a woman to devote all your cooking to <br> Soma declares he will exhaust all of his cooking skills to make sure Erina says it's "delicious" <br><br>sasuga tsukuda<br>like poetry</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope Tsukuda still remembers these scenes and hasn't forgotten because of the looooooong pacing.</br>  <br> Implying Erina is whom Souma will end up with and not the whom she'll get her ass handed in cooking </br>  <br> in italy there's no custom about santa <br>Do they even Italy?</br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it the first chapter?

Hayama could have his nose kicked in by Ryo and lose his smelling and drop to rank 9.<br><br>Erina is rank 10 now but she could very well be "better" than 8 and 9. The ranks are a ballpark but people treat them like absolutes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hayama could have his nose kicked in by Ryo and lose his smelling <br>That could easily get him expelled. But obviously Ryou isn't the type to do that anyway. I honestly don't think you'd simply lose your rank simply because your special talent is lost or impaired. With that logic Erina could drop as well if she couldn't use her God's tongue.</br></br>  <br>Erina has near "perfect" technique on top of her tongue. All of them are highly competent but their specialties are what got them so high. Hayama without his nose would still have his knowledge of spices but he won't be able to pull out their potential entirely.<br><br>He'll still be good but he'll lose the edge that won him the finals. But maybe he'll learn to stop relying on his nose so much.<br><br>Hayama vs stinky sadatsuka might be an interesting match if her stinky stuff overwhelms his nose</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Erina has near "perfect" technique on top of her tongue. <br>We honestly don't know that. Her skill and technique could also be complemented by her God's Tongue. Chefs still need to rely on their sense of taste more than anything else. She pretty much has been dependent on it all her life. The only time we can say she's still as good without it if she cooks without having a single taste of her dish.</br></br>  <br>Oh my bad if it sounds like I'm disagreeing with your assessment on Erina. I'm not. Without her tongue I think she'd be making food that's textbook good but nothing special or unique. Her whole thing is about perfection.</br>  Made a Fresh Orange and Cream Tart.<br><br>1.

Why she doesn't participate more? Is her cooking THAt good?</br>  <br><br>Her intention is just not wanting to run into him. I'm talking about her already at that slippery slope of caring or liking him and she doesn't understand why she's feeling this way due to her naivety to love.</br></br>  <br>She's getting more screen time with her tasting Souma's dishes lately</br>  <br>Her cooking is absolutely godly by first year standards.<br>Basically having her in competitions when she's already 10th seat is unfair to other students and her scores are most likely straight As.</br></br>  <br>A hurdle for Souma to overcome because her taste &gt; everybody else' taste</br>  <br><br>With how the series is with foodgasms, it's like he's declaring he's going to use all his power to have sex with her.</br></br>  <br>Would you be up for a civil union?</br>  <br><br>Erina's foodgasm was already lewd when she was suppressing Soma's furikake. Imagine how lewd it'll be when she finally embraces his food and considers it delicious.</br></br>  <br><br>Obviously you have not read Ichigo 100%. Erina winning the Soumabowl is not obvious a guaranteed shoe-in. She was clearly an antagonist for like the 100 chapters romantic interest. And you're implying that Souma will have any romantic interest with any of the girls in the near future. And you are an obvious Erinafag,</br></br>  <br>I think Erina will become something like Asuna in Negima  please no Negima ending  once it turns out they are related.</br>  <br> hujiao bing <br>Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't that like uber-plebian food?<br>Although I have to admit it's a good counter to mapo doufu and being a pleb is Souma's strong point.</br></br></br>  <br>So does Soma subconsciously have the goal of impressing her every time he cooks?</br>  How would Souma even have the funds to make enough buns to rival a full-manned restaurant?  <br>I assume they get some funds from academy as a kind of loan, hece the whole expulsion thingy.</br>  <br>He's gonna fail spectacularly. He won't bee expelled thanks to Erina.</br>  <br>Nah</br>   NEW SOUMA'S GAZE! <br> lasts 2 chapters <br>I'm glad.</br></br>  <br>MEGUMI</br>  <br>Well Hujiaobao are cheap as fuck in materials compared to mapo doufu so I guess that's something. Are Yugi and Souma competing for highest profits or most portions sold, because Souma could cheese the system since most customers would buy more than one if they plan to eat a 'meal' in Souma's place but nobody really orders more than one bowl / serving of mapo doufu.</br>    <br>This. I was hating him already.</br>  <br> Megumi - lovable country bumpkin  <br> Meat - Meat <br> Erina - princess type <br><br>Megumi wins less hassle</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Where's that anon who said he would translate it? Is he still alive?</br>    <br> yfw this is how Erina will try to impress Soma after she falls </br>  <br>Lucky little twerp</br>  <br><br>I can't think of any situation for Erina to grow as a character except making her lose big time that she'll go into a journey to find herself. <br><br>Maybe something like lose a shokugeki where she loses everything (how, why, i dunno) that brings her down to the lowest of lows. It can set up as those stories where the big headed egotistical person finds more to life than what he/she knows. And why not make it that she loses all of her luxuries and ultimately land herself in the Polar Star Dorm and find herself there and go to some inspirational healing character arc?<br><br>The only problem with this theory is that I can't imagine her losing everything with her grandfather tied so heavily to the school. Though he seems the kind to let Erina go into a healing phase if she loses big time instead of pampering her further.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wait, has Souma even actually tasted Erina's dish?   you're cooking when this beauty suddenly appears  <br><br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Lose to Souma, disbelief on how his dish rocked her world, humbled/mellowed out,  marriage . Or she could just be that huge unchanging wall until the end</br>  <br>Keep cooking, I like being stared at</br>  <br> beauty <br><br>albinos are fucking disgusting<br><br>I bet IRL you could see all her veins</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't even be shocked if there were some kind of custom in Nakiri main branch that if you lose a cooking duel you have to marry that person.</br>  <br>He's never tasted a dish she's made, not even her eggs.</br>  <br>Would explain Nakiris' reaction here <br>Thinking it was a marriage proposal? Who knows, its just crack theory at his point  but funny </br></br>  <br>Senzaemon won't really care if Erina loses and would likely see it as good learning experience for her. Remember he also vetoed her decision not to pass Souma for the transfer extrance exam which shows she prides herself too much. Her other granddaughter Alice already lost to Souma in the Autumn Elections and he was one of the judges.</br>  <br>How can she be so perfect?</br>  <br>Its the black/red evil eyes on her snowy white body and hair. I would love to tongue her butthole</br>  <br> a single harem title <br> against hundreds of harems <br>nice try kiddo</br></br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  I made an extra-bacony gotcha roast pork last night...  so glad it's finally a 24 ep series.  <br>seems light and nutritive <br><br> ... </br></br></br>  <br>I'm feeling a bit of mild stroke just looking at it, would still eat</br>  <br><br> she loses to Eizan or someone higher than her in the E10 <br> stipulation is she gives away everything she acquired (the clubs she's taken, privileges, etc.) to him if she wants the upper seats <br> Erina literally a hobo with no place to live <br> Hisako tries to help her but since she's Erina's aide, that makes her one of Erina's privileges she already gave away from losing <br> no place to go <br> trying to act cool and calm <br> only has her shoujo manga to keep her by <br> suddenly Soma  <br> he sees her predicament and invites her to stay at the PSD <br> Erina goes full tsun, trying to hide she has no trouble at all but reluctantly accepts cause she has no choice <br> PSD healing arc begins </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hisako would follow her everywhere though, no matter what.</br>  <br>It pretty much fell apart once I got it on my plate but god damn it was delicious. The leftovers tasted even better this morning, all the flavors really blended well once it was refrigerated and then warmed up in the microwave.</br>  <br>I mean it is actually pretty common trope for  side characters in harems  from rich families to be bound to mc after losing to him. Would fit, even if Erina is more prominent.</br>  <br>Jesus, I don't think my heart can take that much meat and fat in one plate</br>  <br>I just want to see Souma serving her up and looking all smug and handsome,  no homo </br>  <br> He looks like a totally new person <br> it last 2 chapters </br></br>  <br>I would gobble up his d ish  and Im a hetero guy.</br>  <br>Looks like a semen demon.</br>  <br>I barely ever eat bacon but I think I got my quota for the year. I wrapped the potato-mushroom mix in this bacon weave so the twine wasn't necessary. I tucked sprigs of rosemary in between the weave and the potato. My only failure was the sauce. I started making the sauce while in was finishing the roast under the broiler... however my broiler is shit and took fucking forever to brown the top so the sauce got way too thick. Still tasted good though.</br>  <br>He looks older/with longer hair, but he's not been in that style since that chapter.</br>  <br>I bet, still sleeping off this mini stroke, thanks</br>  <br><br>I remember when the leaks came around, people thought we're getting a big timeskip.<br><br>Makes me wonder if we'll get a legit timeskip. However, this is a school-set manga so unless the manga still continues after school, I doubt we'll see a 2 year timeskip and have every guy be beefier and all the girls grow more voluptuous than they are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That image was only to imply Souma had a big power up in his cooking.</br>  <br> once it turns out they are related. <br>nah, I doubt there'll be a connection like that. If there was, the other Nakiris would have at least left dropped a hint.<br><br>What I do expect is that we'll discover Jouichirou was the son of a noble, who was disowned after he broke off an arranged marriage, and married a mere commoner. And perhaps that woman he broke it off the 'engagement' to was Senzaemon's daughter. Senzaemon probably matched the two together himself, hoping to create the ultimate cook. But it fell through... so Senzaemon had to wait for the next generation to come about.<br><br>Now, given the cost of sending Soma to an elite private school, Jouichirou's employer is probably Senzaemon. In exchange working at his restaurants &amp; hotels, Soma gets a free education. Most likely. Senzaemon likely arranged it so the two would meet from the very beginning, hoping the two would one day wed. So that 'god tongue' and the son of (taking a wild guess here) 'god hands' will create the ultimate offspring. The old man watching them from the shadows and his crazy eyes can't be just 'coincidental'.<br><br>Course this is all theoretical, and probably will never be touched on or if it was, pieces of it wouldn't be unveiled til the very end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Senzaemon <br> commoner </br></br>  <br>How do you factor in Jouichirou apparently working for the Nakiris at one point, that's how Erina gets to know him.</br>  I want to stick my penis inside megumi.<br><br> And hold hands. </br></br>  <br>You mean Senzaemon has keikaku?</br>  <br>all according to</br>  <br>It's a quick opportunity to observe his skills since he got disowned. Gramps knows about Soma and wants to see how good his dad is, making sure that Soma is around good talent before he meets Erina for the first time.</br>  <br>No need to talk about your shit taste here.</br>  <br>Can you read? I said Jouichirou likely BROKE OFF an engagement with Senzaemon's daughter AND married a commoner.</br>  <br>Oi, oi. No, I mean, ei.<br>No. Just, no.</br></br>  <br>Megumi already did it with Souma.</br>  <br>Basically this. Senzaemon had to make sure Jouichirou's knives haven't dulled.</br>  <br>Damn this sounds too based.</br>  <br>He became such a man in a single year.</br>  <br> &gt;Erina literally a hobo with no place to live <br><br>She lives in the Nakiri mansion on campus, pretty sure that's off limits to school shenanigans. Make it that she moves out herself out of pride after losing.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that anon but maybe he needed money because his wife was sick or wanted to buy the shop.</br>  <br> NEW SOUMA'S GAZE! <br> lasts 2 chapters <br>Explain.<br><br><br> that banding <br>What the fuck anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And perhaps that woman he broke it off the 'engagement' to was Senzaemon's daughter. <br><br>There's a chance Erina's parents and maybe Alice's dad were at Tootsuki with Jouichirou and Gin, though not all in the same year level<br><br>If there was a Nakiri in Gin's batch he/she could only be third seat at best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Explain. <br>see </br></br>  <br>As opposed to frail noble daughter runs off with a commoner, gets married, gives birth and dies? If there's any link, it's going to have some level of cliche in it.  And if the Yukihira clan was related to the Nakiris, I think Alice's mother would have dropped a hint or two. So I don't see Erina &amp; Soma being related by blood. Just saying. <br><br><br>This too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hisako, Hayama, and Megumi</br>  <br> cooking with Hayama <br> muh jun <br> spices spices spices <br> I don't want to be here <br> muh jun <br><br> cooking with Megumi <br> but I can't do it <br> you can <br> but I can't  <br> you can <br> repeat over and over </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot &gt;muh superior nose</br>  <br><br><br> cooking with Hisako <br> cold blooded killer stare <br> only following orders <br> muh Erina-sama </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Erina's parents <br><br>At least one, but I imagine everyone who marries into the Nakiri clan tends to be in the food industry.<br><br>But the Nakiris and Tootsuki are such top dogs that they don't seem to have any serious rivals in Japan.

It's a shame there's never really been anything since that even comes close to comparing to that.</br>  <br>You still hear Haro voice</br>  <br>His twin was shown literally in the first season you stupid fuck. Even the episode title was named "Twin GN Drives" or something in episode 9.</br>  <br>The only emotional moment in 00 was when the super-soldier stop fighting to save Sergei. Too bad she became a shit character when she fell in love with the retarded orange schyzo.</br>  Mission Accepted.  Easy, this.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XCn<wbr>tH4cPX2M</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>And then he gets replaced by his twin brother instead of someone else and that Karaba expy goes almost entirely to waste and remains and underused point in his character.<br><br>Also that horrendously bad Anew Returner romance, jesus christ why did they turn S2 of 00 into such a shitfest?</br></br></br>  <br>Char lamenting the death of his mother to Amuro.</br>  <br>Why is SEED so ugly? Even 0079 look better than that crap.</br>  <br>yeah, but do they have gundam transformer?<br> nice bait by the way </br></br>  <br> bait <br> implying fukuda art looks good <br>Also the only good moment in all of SEED was when Kira "died". It should have just ended there.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not bait, I genuily think anime with this kind of aesthetic (code Guess, Dai-Guard) look bad. I won't deny that there is some fairly good design in SEED but golly, does it look like shit.</br>  When Tomino BTFO'd Newtypes.  <br> gundam transformer? <br>What?</br></br>  I haven't even finished G-Reco yet. I'm at ep 15, and I hear the next one is the RAGE MODE episode.  <br>When tomino BTFO his audience by making a shit show</br>  <br>You're just too stupid to understand it.</br>    <br>It doesn't last long. Like a lot of episodes it just kinda fades to black, some indiscernable amount of time passes and then he's gotten over it.<br><br> The fight in Ep 15 was better and is one of the best in the series IMO </br></br></br>  <br> RAGE MODE <br>Not really. If you've enjoyed it that far you'll enjoy the rest.</br></br>  <br><br> He's serious <br> He also probably thinks F91 is a good movie </br></br></br>  Crossbone Gundam anime fucking when?  <br>Yeah, Unicorn was garbage overall but episode 4 was pretty good.</br>  <br>Its a pretty easy show to understand cause its exposition is obnoxiously shoved into your face, the series is just incredibly inconsistent both in its message and storytelling that its easily up there as one of the worst entries in the franchise. buts its fine the last 4 episodes were fucking hysterical, Cumpa Rusita's death is the funniest moment in all of gundam for me</br>  <br>I couldn't resist</br>  Be nice to your big sister.  <br>Unicorn goes to complete shit after episode 4.</br>  <br> f91 was bad <br>*tips rafflesia*</br></br>     He's a good chess player so he's a good military strategist!   <br> He's good at sucking dicks so he's a good OP! </br>  <br>That was the point of the scene, anon.</br>  <br> memorize openings: the game <br> Pros play for a draw before a win <br>Why does anyone play this shitty game?</br></br></br>  <br> I have no idea about chess <br>Openings won't do you any good if the opponent also knows them.

You should still consider reading it though, the ending isn't just a reveal of the tricks. It's a conclusion that draws on the morals strewn through all the episodes and is the definitive final drop on the rollercoaster.<br>The "culprit"'s motivation runs really deep, without her backstory there would be no heart to the senseless murders. A lot of other characters get their hearts laid bare too like Irie and Ooishi who have suprising motivations.<br>Finally, the last moral Ryukishi tries so hard to convey is pretty profound (I thought), about the nature of sacrifices and guilt.</br></br></br></br>  Do you watch anime through your monitor/laptop screen or your TV?  <br>I'm the same, technology confuses me.</br>   Not watching anime through a projector  <br><br>Plebs.</br></br>  its probably 60% on my pc, 30% on my tv and 10% on my laptop in bed  Depends.
