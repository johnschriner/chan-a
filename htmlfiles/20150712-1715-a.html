It's a shitty lifestyle.  <br><br>Speaking of Non Non Biyori, did anyone figure out which real-life village it is based on?</br></br>   slow and boring country life <br>It's an ignorant filled hell, you have nothing to do, why do you think people leave those places?</br>  Thanks for sharing.  So? Were you planning to move there or something, faggot?  Depends on the economy. They'll go back to the countryside if life in the city becomes too expensive.  <br><br>They also can't completely abandon the countryside either due to MUH DOMESTIC AGRICULTURE</br></br>  <br>While Im against heavy expansion such a life is pretty shitty. I lived like that for 6 years but instead never made friends. People went to church to have fun. I better leave now...</br>   plant rice, farm some shit <br> raise pigs and chickens <br>You're now a millionaire.</br></br>  Japan takes their roots, as well as farming ,very seriously. while we may see a decline, I am certain that the village lifestyle in Japan will never die  until China successfully invades   Ranma/Takahashi thread! All Takahashis welcome.    <br>Is she even still alive?</br>  <br>Ayep</br>    I never really liked the Ranma anime, didnt really capture the energy of the manga. Plus they changed a bunch of shit. The movies were lackluster especially the first one. The OVAs didnt even cover some of the better battle arcs like the Herb and Ryu Kumon arcs. Almost makes me wonder if thats what started DEEN's record of shoddy adaptations.    Ranma is best girl and best boy    <br>That is a fact.</br>   Thai kicku   What do you guys think of rin-ne,  <br>The op is pretty awesome</br>  Urusei Yatsura was so popular, it used to get its own fan magazine.  <br>And the first fucking image on the fan art is Lum's ass.</br>  <br>watching Tanaka grovel in No Laugh Prison before getting thai kicked wasn't fun at all, it was sad.</br>            So I started reading the Ranma manga and I'm at the point where Happousai was just introduced and I'm starting to find it hard to read on.<br><br>Does it get any more bearable?</br></br>    <br> dem thighs </br>  <br>The anime had some of the best original one off character's thought, and the OVA's made sure to include all of the main characters; not just Ranma and Akane</br>  <br>gotta milk Rin-ne a little while longer.</br>  <br>And hips?</br>  <br>That's the problem. If there are too many characters it becomes too chaotic. There's no focus. <br><br>If you can't bear happosai, it's best to just drop it now.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Ranma and Akane do the same shit till the veru end.</br>  <br> there are not cameos of ryoga being lost in takahashi's other works </br>  <br>Wasn't there a crane game with Ryoga inside in Rin-ne?</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br><br>That's not Ryoga being lost.</br></br>  <br> Ranma and Akane do the same shit till the veru end <br>Ranma and Akane do the same shit even after the very end.</br></br>  <br> needing to be spoonfed </br>  <br><br><br>dubs for truth</br></br></br>  <br>Shit like this would be great, specially in Inuyasha.</br>    <br>Inuyasha needed the help.</br>  Quick!

Multiple times?</br>  <br>UMI GA SUKI!</br>  <br><br><br>Fair enough, I just remember this one episode (OVA?) Where both he and Mendou both end up not flirting with a girl and everyone else comes to the horrified realization that she's actually a man, simply because they seemed completely uninterested in "her" (but neither of them knew why).</br></br></br>  <br>Would it be rape?</br>      <br>That ghost girl that was going to be Ryuu's husband, but we know Ryuunosuke loved Benten.</br>  <br>not fluffy enough</br>  UGUUUUUUUUU~  <br>The feeling seems to be mutual.</br>    Which is your favorite?<br> Short hair is best. </br>            <br><br><br>Oh well. It was a fun read while it lasted.</br></br></br>    <br> being this big a bitch </br>  <br> short hair <br>nah reminds me too much of akane.

A LOT of porn is outright illegal or censored now, and many parents/liberals are terrified of anything remotely sexual. Even innocent nudity is banned in many contexts.</br></br></br>  <br>YOUR RIGHTS END WHERE YOUR PENIS BEGINS</br>  <br>Remember if you want anything banned just either say it's to protect the children or stop terrorism.<br>Nothing can stop you.</br></br>  <br>what?</br>  <br>Can I bullshit them hard enough and say censorship harms children in some way and get away with it?</br>  <br>You just admitted you're a child molester. Good job.</br>  <br>No, because that way it makes you sound like you want children to have sex.<br>Good job losing all credibility and fucking up your life.</br></br>  <br>Outbullshitting people is the essence of life. Go for it.</br>  <br>Freedom of speech, liberty, and the common man having any value or say whatsoever are new ideas the west forced on Japan after dismantling their country, culture, regime and entire sociopolitical powerstructure by force some 70 years ago. The generation who laboured as serfs to an imperialist military dictatorship bent on genocide and manifest destiny still exist today, and their children are the ones that rebuilt that country and govern over it today.<br><br>This whole 'having a say' thing is still a new concept to their government. Hell, even in the west where concepts like freedom of speech and "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are ingrained so deeply into your nationalist character, you have frumpy housewives spearheading movements and lobbying politicians at every scale of government to ban X, legislate Y and stop Z because they don't like that you like what they don't like.<br><br>Ignorant people on a moral highhorse trying to take away the things you take for granted under the auspices of 'common decency' or 'intuitive morality' are commonplace everywhere, and asian cultures have far fewer lines of defense preventing those people from getting their way.</br></br></br></br></br>  So are the novels beyond the 4th available anywhere? Do I actually have to buy them? Did nobody care about this before it got an anime that they didn't even bother uploading the newer stuff? That's like 5 novels missing.  <br>You feel uncomfortable when warm water touches your dick?</br>  <br>Yeah, I do, It also doesn't feel that great for my dick to be pelted constantly with water.</br>  <br>Water makes for a horrible lube, and a wet dick is not a happy dick. It just gets clammy and uncomfortable and the sensations all feel more distance and less satisfying.<br><br>Plus pruning; fuck pruning.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a sad sad world we live in, when we willingly give up those things that good, honorable men gave their lives to protect.</br>  <br>I'm a dry fap too, but how can you dick feel uncomfortable by warm water?<br>Do people not like warm baths too?</br></br>  <br>Using spit is a better lube than warm water.</br>  Just jerk off in the shower but not directly under the shower.

If someone were to ask another person to describe Eriri's character, the most they could say is that she's a tsundere. That's not perfection.</br></br>  <br>See pic related<br><br><br>IF someone were to ask me to describe Eriri's character, I would say that she's the best girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a good way to discredit yourself. I like it.</br>  <br> IF someone were to ask me to describe Eriri's character, I would say that she's the best girl. <br><br>And you would be wrong. Her character development pales in comparison to the rest of the cast's.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And if I happen to be a tsundere enthusiast? Why can't I like what I like instead of having people shit all over it? If someone likes eating shit then let them eat shit.</br></br>  <br>"A formerly dependent and weak girl slowly growing into a strong-willed artist who's more at ease with herself around others" is probably what Maruto expected people to think of Eriri. It was kinda the point of GS and vol 8.<br><br><br>Eriri and Tomoya are two characters who have developed the most though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eriri is third place, first is Tomoya since the series is from his POV and second is pic related. Of course, all the character development in this series is great.</br></br>  <br>I want to know nips opinion about this development. Because if people turn to hate her even more, it will become an irony.</br>  <br><br>Eriri is still weak and selfish. <br><br> thinks Tomoya doesn't hold a grudge against her anymore <br> thinks she still has a say in who joins the circle despite leaving <br> still self-conscious about Izumi and how she might surpass her <br><br>And then there's this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Utaha <br> Generic harsh kuudere sepnai #1831823 <br> Megumi <br> Generic normal and dull boring girl #1238123 </br></br></br></br>  <br> Megumi <br> Generic normal and dull boring girl #1238123 <br><br>Nice bait. That's Onodera you're describing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has a severe superiority complex.</br>  <br>Megumi hasn't developed that much. She's largely been the same since vol 6, pushing herself too hard to be someone she isn't.<br><br><br>They don't hate her (not like what we have here anyway), and some even think Eriri might win in the end because Maruto has reset her and Tomoya's relationship (basically they speculate there might be another vol 6 all over again).</br></br></br></br>  <br> pushing herself too hard to be someone she isn't. <br><br>How is she doing that? Her relationship with Tomoya is the most natural one in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Out of the three principal girls, Eriri is dead last in terms of popularity.</br>  <br> Eriri might win in the end because Maruto has reset her and Tomoya's relationship (basically they speculate there might be another vol 6 all over again). <br><br>But that's not possible. If Eriri wins then her career as an artist over. If anything, she might give up on Tomoya romantically in a couple of volumes like Utaha did.</br></br></br>  <br> bait <br>It's not bait when it describes her to a tee.</br></br>  <br> Eriri is still weak and selfish <br>She is a flawed character but still the best.</br></br>  <br><br>She's only normal and dull if you're completely blind. Does this look anything like "dull?"</br></br>  <br>Speaking of Utaha, is her spinoff canon?</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>It is bait when it describes your post to a tee.</br>  <br> pales in comparison <br> Literally is one, if not is the most developed girl before volume 7 <br>Disliking tsundere doesn't mean you can make up horseshit, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a rhetorical question?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>Then you are blind.</br></br>  Best  <br>That's shame. I thought it was perfect prequel for her and morals-kun.</br>  <br><br>Eriri's development is good, great even. But it's just not the best. She is still a bitch.</br></br>  <br>What's the problem? Eriri has always been a balance of strong and weak. That one of her main appeals. Removing either one for the other entirely isn't good for her. Eriri's resolve and goals have evolved, that's the change in her. Her strong mentality towards those objectives that makes her stubborn remains, but she isn't as full of pride as she used to be and can apologize for her mistakes as seen in volume 6.</br>  <br><br>Yeah yeah, and Eriri isn't a tsundere, amirite?</br></br>  <br>She's become very controlling so the circle won't fall apart, but it's not who she really is. Iori comments on that in vol 8.<br><br><br>It's possible because Tomoya says someday he might understand creators like Eriri and become like them too. But yeah I don't see it happening before Maruto wraps everthing up unless he pulls another "5 years late".</br></br></br></br>  <br> bitch <br>Not to Tomoya. She still fights with Utaha and that is a good thing.</br></br>  <br> she isn't as full of pride as she used to be and can apologize for her mistakes as seen in volume 6. <br><br>Then why does she need Tomoya to get her to apologize to Megumi?</br></br></br>  <br>*later</br>  <br><br>Utaha is her closest ally.</br></br>  <br>Eriri is a cookie-cutter generic tsundere with nothing that makes her stand out among the large pool of existing tsunderes.</br>  <br>Eh your words are too good to her. It's Tomoya idea, so she basically stand there doing nothing.</br>  <br> She's become very controlling so the circle won't fall apart <br><br>That was mainly because of Tomoya's screw-up in volume 6. Eriri and Utaha would have left whether or not Megumi was in the circle. <br><br> Iori comments on that in vol 8. <br><br>Is that when he called her 重い?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Explain why you think Megumi is "boring."</br></br>  <br>Because neither Eriri nor Megumi is willing to do anything about it.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, and if Eriri learned her lesson in volume 6 then she'd know that she should apologize. But nope, she doesn't because she's scared. Even in volume 7 when Megumi confronts her she tries to excuse herself by saying that Megumi left too.</br></br>  <br>I assume Megumi is first and Utaha second, right?<br><br>If so, Japan has pretty damn good tastes for once.</br></br></br>  <br>He screwed up since vol 1. That's why he's trying to do things differently this time.</br>  <br>Megumi is a cookie-cutter generic normal girl with nothing that makes her stand out among the large pool of existing normal girls.<br><br><br>You first. Explain your meme.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people prefer Kerry over Shirou?<br><br>Which Emiya was the better protagonist?</br></br>  Red is a glorified self-insert. That aside, he's pompous and idealistic on annoying levels. Kerry wins by default.  kiritsugu is a badass. <br>Shiro is an idiot</br>  Kiritsugu has the better  voice   For me it's because Kerry actually has a cool magic theme. All Shirou has is le swords.  <br> Kerrytugu <br> not an idiot </br></br>  Kiritsugu did stuff that was fun to watch <br><br>That simple. I would rather watch someone execute terrible acts of violence on other jerks than watch some dip flail around like an idiot and have to constantly get rescued by everyone around him, despite a total lack of regard for his own safety.</br></br>  <br>All Kerry has is Guns and a small Time Alter.</br>  <br>because kerry is a self insert for edgy teens</br>  <br>Thinly veiled fedoracore exposure thread.</br>  <br> and an imba Time Alter <br>FTFY</br></br>   le girls can't fight so i must protect you  <br><br>shirou was a fucking retard protagonist, I blame shirou for saber being so shit in F/SN</br></br>  <br> implying Sugita's yells and screams aren't magnificent </br>  <br><br> Liking Kira over best Bro-Jo </br></br>  I wouldn't go as far as comparing them. Of course UBW anime looks like the most generic shounenshit in existence but those who actually finished the VN should know that Shirou is a more complex and overall good character. Kiritsugu is cool from every side hands down.  <br> Being a edgemaster is fun <br><br><br>both of them are manchilds</br></br></br></br>  <br>This just displays a fundamental misunderstanding of Shirou's character. He would happily die before allowing someone else be hurt. He values his life less than he does a single drop of blood from a non-evil person. Saber being in danger of being hurt for Shirou's sake is, in his view, a terrible waste. His life and well-being are not valuable enough for anyone to risk themselves for. Due to his culture, he displays this in the only semi-reasonable way he can think of with Saber by claiming that she shouldn't fight because she's a girl.<br><br>It's not a girl fighting that he has a problem with, it's a girl fighting for him. This isn't displayed very well in the anime, but is very clear if you've played the VN.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not just that, though. Shirou is actually misogynistic though. Throughout his routes he always talks about how guys should act one way and girls should act another.</br>  <br>Still sexist, especally when Shirou realizes that Saber fighting is something he loves about her.</br>  <br>I-Isn't that good?</br>  <br>I don't know if being an edgemaster is fun<br><br>But they get up to some pretty ridiculous shit in action shows. And I like watching ridiculous shit.</br></br></br>   there are plebs in this thread RIGHT NOW that rent zerofags  <br>what plebs. This is why zero is objectivity better than f/sn.</br>  <br>But isn't it right?</br>  <br>  Being an edgemaster not fun <br><br>It's like you are trying to deny yourself faggot. Everyone has a bit of edge inside. <br><br>Kerrytugu is indeed better than shirou.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Never said it was good or bad. I'm just correcting that anon that said Shirou only acts sexist as a mask for his messed up sense of justice. Even if Shirou didn't strive to be a hero, he would still be sexist. He's sexist regardless of his views of justice.</br></br>  <br><br>No Shirou, it's not right.<br><br>Letting women fight alongside you isn't a bad thing, especally when they beat you up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What would Kerry be like if he had all of the Emiya family crest?</br>    <br>He does display some measure of sexism, particularly when thinking about Ayako for example. Him thinking women shouldn't fight is a combination of cultural perceptions of women in Japan, and Shirou's personal issues regarding someone else sacrificing for his sake.</br>  <br>Zero was such a wild ride, SN can't even compare</br>  <br> still no Kayneth DLC for MK8 <br><br>what the fuck, nasu</br></br></br>  <br>It's kind of easy to see why in retrospect<br><br>Whatever it was that people loved about FS/N originally was because it was a VN, and a very wordy VN that had a fair degree of introspection and philosophical wrestling, regardless of how well it was executed or not. Also weird sex.<br><br>Meanwhile Zero is like "What if we take this setting and did COOL SHIT" which would naturally make for a better anime.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Zero also had a considerable amount of stuff that wasn't in the LN, making it new for everyone while UBW was mostly a straight adaption.</br>  One is a mature and developed badass character while the other is a edgy self insert throwing a tantrum.    <br> Kariya suffering <br> Iri is kill <br> Broskandar losing 'cause EAgglol.png <br> Gil coming back because 'ego' <br>Fucking Zero, man.</br></br></br></br></br>  Was Shiro throwing away his ideals for Sakura worth it ?  <br> Zero also had a considerable amount of stuff that wasn't in the LN, making it new for everyone while UBW was mostly a straight adaption. <br>Zero mostly cut stuff out from the LN and only expanded upon filler scenes like Rin's Adventure and Kiritsugu's back story. UBW had more anime original material, notably the last episode, Answer, and the stuff with Caster's master.<br><br>The real reason why the F/Z anime was more of a ride on /a/ than FSN is because pretty much everyone knows the story of FSN while barely anyone knew anything about F/Z. People could make tons of parody content for the "new" zero characters, meanwhile fan material for all the fate characters had pretty much existed for years. Also UBW was horribly shitposted to death.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no because wormslut a shit</br>  <br>They're both shit. I did find Shirou to be a lot more annoying, I couldn't get myself to finish the first route because of him, but that may be just me. At least in FZ the entire show doesn't revolve around the MC, so him being shit is not such a big deal.</br>  <br>I thought Kiritsugu was more fun overall. He was an all aroudn badass who had already been through some shit and he was on a non-stop action warpath until the end of zero.<br><br>Shirou, while honestly being less fun, was a better character solely because of how complex he is. He's a character who in each route gets to experience drastically different paradigm shifts. He's a character whose not on a bloody warpath but a character whose on a soul searching journey trying to find out why he deserves to live.<br><br>If we got a full vn where Kerry was the protagonist and got multiple routes where you can actually experience his changes, then he might be considered a better character. But since the only thing we have for Kerry right now is 10 hours worth of material theres no way he can be a more complex protagonist. I guess if you think he has cooler powers than thats fine for you, but I have an insane boner for weapon summoning and archery.</br></br></br></br></br>  Kiritsugu is fucking Batman with magic, what's not to like?  <br>UBW threads were so unfunny in contrast to the Zero threads in the past, it's such a fucking shame. No one knows how to have fun on these threads anymore.</br>  <br>The one that isn't an honorless shitbag who deserved far worse.</br>  <br>Batman Isn't THAT edgy, anon</br>  I don't care for either, Waver is a much better protagonist than both.  Kerry was a manchild. He failed at everything he did pretty much solely because he had the logic and mindset of an eight-year-old.  <br>Magic is edgy.</br>  The true hero  <br>you mean me?</br>  <br>Was gonna post this guy.<br>Best Fate/ Protagonist</br></br>    <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kKn<wbr>OFRLs9hU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Because of style over substance. From a more critical lens, obviously Shirou is the better written character since Kiritsugu is pretty much completely static and by the book for the whole story with very little interaction with other characters and barely having his ideal challenged.<br><br>Shirou also suffers from the rest of the cast being more interesting than him while most of F/Z's cast is so boring it's no wonder Kiritsugu ended up being so popular.</br></br></br>  Kayneth "Fast Wheels" Archibald El Melon is the true hero of Fate.    <br> Liking Sasuke </br>  <br>Dragon Dick &gt; Melvin<br><br>Zork &amp; Pals is getting a Season 2 soon.</br></br></br>  Iri is so boring and shitty. Ilya is the best.  <br>I liked Zero S1 because all the setup was interesting and the Kirei/Gilgamesh talks were beyond great, and it had fun episodes like Grail Dialogue and Rin. <br><br>Zero S2 though just swallowed a double dose of edge and gave up character development in favor of how edgy they could kill of someone in each episode. And then Escape from Zombie Island and Zombies on a Plane completely slaughtered the pacing of the cour going into the lackluster ending especially since we didn't need 2 episodes for his generic backstory.</br></br></br>  <br> Batman kills using Guns with magic bullets </br>  <br>Have you read the Zero LNs?</br>  <br>I don't.<br><br>Kiritsugu never grew up.<br><br>Shirou grew up, challenged his beliefs, strengthened them, and got a massive power boost in the span of two weeks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're full of shit, but even if you were right, that's sexism, not misogyny, retard. Sexism is about gender roles and preconceptions, misogyny is hating women.</br>  F/Z &gt; FS/N<br>Kiritsugu &gt; Shirou<br><br><br>Also, Shirou's voice is annoying is fuck.

Deep inside he still wanted his beliefs to happen but knows it's not feasible. That plus he only had a limited amount of time left to live. That's why Shirou picks up the slack for him after he passes away.</br>  <br>I would add Extra as well. It not have anything to do with the Grail itself, but still nails the masters and their legendary servants facing each other to the death concept.</br>  <br>Shitrou fag pls go to your dolphins.</br>  <br>UBW is the best written Fate story. Prove me wrong.</br>  <br> It not have anything to do with the Grail itself, <br><br>This is a very strange comment<br><br>It's as much of a grail as the Fuyuki one, if not more so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean for asspulls then yes.</br>  They're both good for different reasons.  <br> UBW best plot <br>That'd be HF, UBW has the best characters, Fate has the best sex scenes.</br></br>  <br>Kiri has gap moe going on for him.

It's not gay though.</br>    <br><br><br>Wasn't it just a copy of the real thing created by the moon cell? <br><br>I don't remember</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fixed font version.</br>  <br>Anything that can grant a wish is the Holy Grail<br><br>Ironically the real Holy Grail cannot grant wishes, as confirmed by CCC.<br><br>If you think the Holy Grail in F/SN or Apoc was the real Holy Grail, then you really need to reread shit. Holy Grail is just a designation given by the Church for anything that can grant a wish. Because it is fake, its real, in a sense. The Holy Grail in F/SN wasn't anything genuine.<br><br>There's also some very genuine grails in CCC, but the Mooncell is by designation a Holy Grail in the same way that the Fuyuki one is, as it can grant a wish, except a few thousand times stronger.<br><br>Even outside of that whole explanation, Mooncell when it creates something by data cannot be called a copy as its too close to the original. Kind of like Touko's deal in Kyoukai, where she incidentally created clones so similar to herself that they were basically the real thing. If the Mooncell made the grail, or made something, it would be as real as life.<br><br> Sakura: Yes, that's right. To be more precise, they are perfectly reproduced from the Moon Cell's records of human history. However, that human history is connected to the throne of heroes in multiple ways, so they can't be called copies as a rule. In short, the Moon Cell consciously creates its own history of humanity, but that history is the exact same as the throne of heroes, so it's like they overlap in multiple ways as the same existences. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be clear, the Holy Grail in this case is the core of the Mooncell, Angelica's Cage. At the heart of the Moon is the heart of the Mooncell. Whoever reaches that can rewrite the records of humanity or just ask the Mooncell to make their dream come true, and Mooncell will reshape the outside world so that their ideal world will come to pass entirely. A wish was granted by reshaping everything, that's its power.<br><br>The Holy Grail of the Seven Heavens which created the Seven Seas.</br></br></br>  <br> Ironically the real Holy Grail cannot grant wishes, as confirmed by CCC. <br>What if my wish is flooding the world with thousands of curses? <br>Or having a comfy meeting with Angry Manjew where he gives me riddles about saving people in boats?</br></br></br>  <br>What if someone wished that they want to be screwed over by Angry Manjew? Would it simply not grant a wish &amp; make the person regret their wasted chance?</br>  <br> What if someone wished that they want to be screwed over by Angry Manjew? <br><br>It would bring world peace, end hunger, poverty and crime, and shower you and your loved ones with infinite happiness, wealth and pleasures.<br>That was the secret to make it work all along.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're so hopeless anon-kun.<br> Wish Granting Machine! <br><br>Do this wish-granting shit yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What if my wish is flooding the world with thousands of curses? <br><br>Not sure you get the point; the real holy grail doesn't grant your wishes if you wish for curses, the holy grail in F/SN was almost as far from genuine or the real thing as you can get. F/SN Holy Grail literally had nothing to do with anything that actually could be called such a thing. It's just a designation given by the church, that has nothing to do with the actual cup.<br><br>Real Holy grail has nothing to do with Angya Manyu, wishes, or stuff like that to begin with. The Holy Grail in F/SN was just three families getting together, creating a cup, filling it with mana, and that's it really. Nothing holy or grailish about it, they just lied to the servants about the true nature of this thing.<br><br>Real Holy Grail is just Jesus cup; it might have some powers or it would give you some abilities, but a cup of selfishness and greed that hands out all Earthly desires without question, such a thing has nothing to do with Christ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Golden Chalice &lt;Aurea Boura&gt;(? アウレア・ボーウラ): EX <br> The golden chalice that BB holds. As well as a Holy Grail. <br> A negative Holy Grail that grants the impudent, self-centered wishes of the owner. <br><br> The chalice possessed by the Whore of Babylon that appears in the Revelation of St. John. <br> A pseudo-Holy Grail, but exactly because it is a fake Holy Grail that it became a "genuine" Holy Grail that grants the desires of humans regardless of right and wrong. <br><br> To the Christians that treated the honorable poverty of those days as virtue, a chalice molded with a symbol of riches such as gold evidently had connotations of corrupted wealth, greed and the vanity of adorning oneself. <br><br> Although it was clear from the point that this was the chalice held by the Whore of Babylon - the personification of the Roman Empire - but this chalice has inverted Christ's words of "Do not pile up wealth on the land" and symbolizes the earthly wealth. <br><br>**<br><br> "I saw a single woman straddled on a red beast. <br> That beast, whose whole body was covered with numerous names that blasphemed God, had seven heads and ten horns." <br><br> According to the Revelation, this is the description of the beast of ruin that appeared in the Holy City and the woman that was straddled on said beast. <br> A giant beast possessing seven heads as if the Hydra was said to appear from the sea and land on the Holy City. <br> This beast and woman are one and the same, it is impossible to think about them detached from each other. <br><br> The woman is treated as one who brings forth all evils, it has been said that the imprudent and avaricious are unable to oppose her temptation and corrupted by this chalice. <br><br>This entry kind of makes a few twists in F/SN a lot more open that were set up from the beginning. Its a shame the whole Beast angle was dropped from F/SN in favor of Angya, since it kind of would have made certain things a lot more obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  People try to undersell this, but fuck.<br><br>It's almost as long as F/SN.<br><br>Lotta dialogue</br></br></br></br>  Threads keep losing steam halfway in lately.  <br>Not enough Fate/Powerlevels.</br>  <br>Cu is sexier than Shiki.

To him only the outcome mattered. Then the miracle blows up in his face and he gives up on his ideal. All this while being an adult.<br><br>Shirou also has an ideal that he knows is impossible bu he doesn't do something so radical as to put all his hopes in one miracle. Instead he pursues it anyway knowing it can't come true because even when he fails to save everyone he would still had done good by saving some, and to Shirou this process is more important than the final goal. All this while being a teenager.

Gotham probably has LexCorp towers around (they're even in Arkham Knight).<br><br>So will Bruce find Superman a threat because he "helped" destroy a city or will he take it more personal since he destroyed Wayne tower and might be a threat to Gotham as well. Seems slightly unlike Batman to worry about a different city's safety if it has nothing to do with Gotham or his family.<br><br>Also, having older Bruce Wayne around as an experienced Batman when Superman is just starting is a little weird.

Speaking to a Japanese audience about Japanese culture is inherently Japanese, but the lesson he drew, that they were fucking things up and needed to learn from other cultures, is part of why he is beloved by western audiences while still having a uniquely Japanese voice.<br><br>Kon could not make his movies if he were Brad Kone in Hollywood. He couldn't make them if he were Claude Konne in Switzerland. <br><br>He could only make his movies as Satoshi Kon. And Satoshi Kon was as much a student of Igmar Bergman as Osamu Tezuka.<br><br> tfw anime as a whole is quite happy to cater to Chuunis and lolicons and ignore the fact that they have a unique art form available to say things and build something new, because the age of experimentation when new ideas were marketable is passed <br><br>I sure hope you're all looking forward to a lifetime of heterosexual male "Japanese" white dude protagonists who are just waiting for the right opportunity to unlock their hidden potential and save the world and/or their bland fanservice love interest. Because that's what we have now. Anime Spider-Man saves the 12 year old Gothloli.

But he technically has no-one even remotely strong to fight, so we don't really know his limits. So yeah, it's kind of hard to say.</br>  <br>No, 9  Kingdom massacre. Gazef's death </br>  Anyone here watching this show?  <br>I can't tell if you're rusing me.</br>  bump  <br>Yeah since i watched that episode i thought it was going to be fun, especially for pic related<br><br>it was a new level of shit drama</br></br></br>  <br> it was a new level of shit drama <br>This. Literally worse than Shigatsu.</br></br>  <br>CHEERIO!</br>  [HorribleSubs] Aquarion Logos - 02 [720p].mkv  <br>For that matter, Rei had some hotheaded moments.</br>  I wasn't so keen on the characters in the first episode but their unique brand of retardation is very endearing. I'm hoping the savior schtick doesn't get old.<br><br>The lack of music is jarring though. It doesn't feel right without an insert song so far though perhaps that's because there hasn't been a scene to warrant it (besides the Aquarion in the first episode). Don't know if May'n is up to the task.<br><br>Also, their mouths being unusually small makes them all look silly, especially Akira.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is something seriously off about the MC's design.<br><br>I think its because his mouth is too small?</br></br></br>  <br>For some reason the brunette waitress chick looks on-model most the time unlike all the other characters.<br><br>I've grown attached to her just because she isn't a a blobby offense to the eyes like everyone else.<br><br>Too bad she's just a side character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mouth too small <br> silly haircut <br> baggy ill-fitting clothes </br></br></br>   http://rule34.paheal.net/wiki/Note<wbr>s</wbr> <br> http://booru.org/tos <br><br>B-b-but my beautiful lolis!

It starts with a p I believe. Am I right?</br>  <br>Yeah but that interface. I prefer ex's.</br>  Are you ready for the inevitable Atelier Sophie anime?  <br>Just learn the system for first playthrough then do many more things right for the second.</br>  <br>Wait, there are triggers for them? I thought Eschatology is pretty straight forward compared to Ayesha or even Arland and what i did just bringing my best party to the dungeon.</br>  <br>EtL is all based on friendship level, I thought. Just keep them in your party and it will happen eventually.<br>And since you can switch parties out of town it was never a pain to include someone.</br></br>   Continuation of Dusk <br>I better not get blueballed like in the last one. I like Mad Max Atelier but wrap this shit up already.</br>  <br>I still need to finish Atelier Shallie... <br><br>Was disappointed in the lack of Ayesha through the rest of the series.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
