I love it. You have a good weekend color friend.</br>  <br>god damn adorable.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127282524 <br>Nice spoiler, fuckhead</br>    <br><br>God tier.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127282524 <br> messing up the spoilers </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127282524 <br>holy shit</br>  <br>Weak how anon? <br>I thought the composition was nice.</br></br>  <br>can you point out whats wrong with it to help him improve?</br>  <br>Not him, but the line work could be more refined as well as the neatness of the whole thing. Some of the colors spill out of the lines. Personally, I would have preferred her doing something with her hands and a small head tilt to be a little more dynamic. Regardless, it all came together quite nicely.</br>  <br>The composition is fine. His figure/lines are just weak. <br><br>Take BB for instance. His figure drawing is a lot stronger. There's dimension etc. People in waifu threads get dazzled by pro coloring and disregard the drawing itself-no matter how feeble it is(not that this guy's is absolutely horrible).</br></br></br>  <br>Well yes it's a bit rushed, isn't that the nature of this whole thing? <br>I mean his value work is insane. <br>I mean that alone does not mean everything is great but it's a picture that focused on it instead of something like movement. <br>Personally I only dislike the sharp blur filter but once again I think it's just because it's a rushed work.</br></br></br></br>  <br>thats valid criticism i suppose...</br>  Requesting a drawing of Cave at the beach in her swimsuit.  <br>I think the way her hair is in motion instead of her covers the dynamic aspect.</br>  <br>I don't think you can say the figure is weak if it works. I mean sure it could be more interesting but it's not like that is the only measure of a drawing. Being able to make a good one with a simple pose is very important too. <br>If you want to rate him as an artist this picture alone is not enough to judge that, and one picture really can't ever do that anyways. <br>It could be he struggles with more complicated gestures and and figures but you can't tell that from that picture alone.</br></br></br>  There's always that one person.  <br>And as the artist, it's that one person's comment you always remember.</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's like. They weren't asking for any critique or anything like that. I bet they wouldn't have responded with that criticism at all if there weren't a ton of people saying they liked the art.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure once you get to this point you know how to handle critique, good and otherwise.</br>  <br>Here you go, Inoribro</br>  <br><br><br>if only someone kept track</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, I can: It's a weak drawing. It hasn't got dimension and his lines lack confidence. <br><br>Also, why bother getting defensive about anonymous critiques? Especially if you aren't even the artist. Who cares, really.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course they wouldn't have. It's frustrating having something relatively simple get so much attention while your best efforts don't always measure up.<br><br><br>Not angrily denying there's a problem is one thing. Not being bothered by it for weeks is another.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you keep track of birthdays too or only anniversaries?</br>  <br>Ugh.</br>  <br>thats a birthday list</br>  <br>Am I in there?</br>  <br>What is this? Where is it from?</br>  <br>Oh.</br>  <br>I'm not defensive, this is called a conversation anon. <br>You said the figure is weak but it's not. It works for the composition very well. <br>Yeah the linework is not strong but doing that well takes a good bit of time.</br></br></br>  <br>Props to you anon.<br><br>And if anything, my waifu's anniversary is in a month</br></br></br>  <br>who could forget your birthday, anon</br>  <br>nice!!</br>    <br><br>OR here, I think it really fits. She has very long hair for her height, and she knows how to be graceful when the situation requires it, which is exactly the sort of situation where long hair shines. In this image, she has both dignity/grace (straight, unmoving pose) and cuteness/liveliness (flowing, moving hair, plus her smile). That's one of the reasons I'd still think it's beautiful even if it wasn't her.</br></br>  <br>Awesome collage list.</br>  <br>Requesting the whole birthday list. I want to know if mine is recorded.  It's in November  </br>  Hi everyone.

Niboshi is sleeping  <br>sleep tight nibosshi</br>  <br>any news about VN2 script translations?</br>  <br><br>walelel</br></br>  <br>Sorry, I'm not a translator. Maybe we'll get some in this thread if it lasts longs enough</br>  <br><br>we have had YUYUYU threads last a good long while before</br></br>    <br>just woke up.<br>sad that there are still no spoilers.</br></br>  <br> 6:40PM in Shikoku <br>There should be some soon</br></br>  Where do people typically go for spoilers? Futaba?<br>It's times like this where I wish I knew moon</br>  I want to  _be_  Yuuna      GOOD NEWS EVERYONE!<br><br>I got sick of the 2nd VN not being translated so I decided to go do a scenario myself.<br><br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/q<wbr>ppe7mp6adnelap/10-Inubouzaki+Fuu+ca<wbr>n%27t+deal+with+ghosts.txt<br><br>The translations are http://pastebin.com/KGYa8RaR but heavily edited as the original were crap. My Japanese is not amazing, so some things I had to assume the original was right in, but at least the English grammar is now readable. Also there are a few things lost in translation, especially さしすせそ, but if that's a problem, just go learn Japanese already.<br><br>Instructions for inserting the script into the VN can be found here: https://www.mediafire.com/folder/67<wbr>05q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS<br><br>It took a lot longer than I expected, mainly because the game crashes if there isn't a line break in the right space in every single goddamn line and English takes up so much more space than Japanese. Still, it would've been impossible without the guy who provided the mediafire files for inserting the script into the VN (see above), so kudos to him.<br><br>If someone else wants to do other ones, I'd be happy to provide editing/translating work for the other 2 crappy translations ( http://pastebin.com/3Jn10QDg and http://pastebin.com/cGYp9HEy ) but I'm not going through that line-spacing nightmare again. Have fun.<br><br>But on the bright side, enjoy Fuu and Itsuki trapped in slime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks anon!</br>  <br>Thanks anon!

I forgot what was the news on this.</br></br>  <br>Gyuuki Gyuuna is a badass</br>  I wonder if the other translator anon is still around.  <br>There're so many translators anon around, which one are you talking about?<br>  I'm the very first LN translator anon, btw. I'm waiting warmly for the new chapter.  </br></br>  <br>Yes good!</br>  <br>Great you're still here, I'm the second LN translator.<br>How do you wanna do this this time?</br></br>  Through unknown means, a guy got the book before clock hit midnight.

There're still some parts that can be picked up. The story of [Yuuki Yuuna is a hero] still hasn't ended. People who has expectation, please keep believing and reading Dengeki G's magazine, something might be in there.  <br>A bit about [The second Hero Record]<br> There's a bit info about Nowayu <br> An illustration of Nogi Wakaba, she looks like an Ikemen version of Sonoko. <br> Yuuna looks like she knows something about Wakaba. <br> etc </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's dizziness <br><br>I knew Takahiro was planning something!

This is almost the likely route but they can still play us like a piano in this and completely go another way.<br><br> What kinds of influence it might have might be outside of your expectation. <br><br>They must have gone around the net to see the fan predictions and come up with an unexpected scenario at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Did these ever get scanned?  <br>not even the art book got scanned.<br>not a single one to my knowledge.</br></br>  <br> bottom right </br>  <br>everytime I see that one picture of the Artbook I am crying a bit ;_;</br>  <br>Did they get Parunyasu to make everyone promise not to scan them?

I don't know why all my favourite MCs always end up being the ones who punch things into submission.</br>  <br>This reminds me of that sperms exploitable pic or the one with the vibrator.</br>  <br>I-I'll need a source on this. For research.</br>    <br>They said Wakaba looks like she'd be popular. <br>People is gradually getting their copies now but none of them spoil anything.</br></br>  I miss Tougo's wheelchair  <br>Ikemen mahou shoujou named Wakaba.<br>Why does this seem familiar?</br></br>  <br>Lewd.</br>    <br> bakawakaba will never be your girlfriend <br>That fat genuise NEET autist girl sure is lucky.</br></br>  <br>Yuushabots, roll out.</br>    <br>poor wheelchair kun.</br>  <br>Who would win in a wheelchair race?</br>  <br>You need to exclude Tougou for a viable discussion.</br>  <br><br>Hearing Aurora Days while watching the image makes me feel sorry about the wheelchair, I don't know why.</br></br>  Sonoko= Gold General?

See you in 8 hours  <br><br><br>OK what's even supposed to be happen on these pics?</br></br></br>  Wait, so it's just a LN? No second season or whatever? Well damn.    <br><br>*happening</br></br>  S2 when?  <br><br>Scans when? Mine will take one month to arrive.</br></br>  <br>Why are they so gay, god damn.</br>  hey, remember that time Yuuna punched a thing.  Hey guys, script anon here. I've been really busy lately, but now I have some time to work on adding translation data.<br>Also some good news, while fiddling with the data files I found how to remove the text size limit, so separating lines won't be necessary anymore, I also found how to translate the color codes for names so adding the @ won't be necessary either.<br><br><br>Yeah the most annoying part is getting the line breaks right, but the crashing issue should disappear with this fix, if you can edit the other translations I'll gladly add them to the script file.<br><br>After I'm done re-editing the existing translations so they work with the new fix I'll upload them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah, good times</br>  <br>There's still 3 unannounced news so I'm pretty sure a second season will be one of them. I'm not surprised they haven't released any information about a s2 yet considering it was only a short while ago s1 aired and they didn't expect it to get the popularity it did. I rather wait for them to pan out the details than rush it.</br>  <br>i l-love you anon</br>  <br>You're doing God's work anon!</br>  Got some tiny bit of information<br> The new LN chapter doesn't directly connect to the supposed S2 but to Nowayu. <br> Highlight is Wakaba's picture. <br> Chapter has an unrest atmosphere. <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cleaned this picture up a little bit.<br>Though, having a scan in 1200 dpi and original size I'd be able to make it look better.</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>It kills my kokoro that we know that something is wrong with Yuuna but we don't even know what exactly.<br>During the whole second VN Yuuna acted like she was daijobu so the others don't have to worry.<br>God damn it Yuuna you are supposed to talk to someone if you are troubled ;_; <br>Protect Yuuki Yuuna, even if she is 100% Vertex or godess or whatever now she still is perfect!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna may turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>c-come on anon,,, t-tell me it's a joke ;_;</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>Why this</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>So she's an immortal divine being with the  soul of a lion  now.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human </br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>I NEVER ASKED FOR THIS</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>W-which Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>REAL HUMAN BEAN</br></br>  <br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. </br>  Okay, guys. Brace yourself for chapter summary, as well as a tiny snapshot of Wakaba. <br> Chapter starts with Sonoko and Karin in the bath talking about candidates for the next club head. <br> When Sonoko went home she found an old Hero Record book. <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br> However, at the last page there's a picture of a girl that looks like her. <br> The name is Nogi Wakaba, the year is 2015. <br> Sonoko shows the book to the club. <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Last illustration is of the entire club looking at Wakaba's picture. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br> Chapter ends. <br><br>Inb4, the old Yuuna's soul hijacks our current Yuuna's body.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Content has been heavily censored by Taisha. <br>damn not again Taisha</br></br>    <br>I'm scared, /a/. Also, <br> 2015 </br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br><br>I bet her soul is  burning as hot as the sun .</br></br></br>  <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>I don't want to see her cry...</br></br>  <br>Guys, we got too used to the cute SoL moments in the vita and VNs. This is the true face of Takahiro. Brace yourselves.</br>  <br>E-everything will be ok.</br>  <br> Yuuna suffering continues <br>I can't go on guys, this is too much for my heart.<br>Can't she just punch things back into daijobu again? ;_;<br>God I need NoWaYu now</br></br></br></br>  <br>Y-yeha be postive guys!<br>The healing will feel even better after Yuuna dealt with the next shit happening. She is a hero she won't lose! let's just belive in her!<br>You're likely to succceed if you try!</br></br></br>  Okay, prediction time:<br>Yuuna absorbed a part of Leo's soul when she touched the core. She was in coma because of the adjustments in her soul that had to happen.<br>Leo's soul is now sleeping inside her waiting for a trigger to wake it up. I can see two different paths from there:<br>1. Yuuna becomes a combined hero-super-vertex and the final boss, Tougou calls out to her, Yuuna fights within her soul against Leo and wins.<br>2. Leo is actually an observer and messenger and its task is to see what's going on inside of the walls of the Shinju-sama and to assess if they should continue trying to destroy humanity or if the Shinju has a point.</br></br></br></br>  we evangelion now  <br>I'd like the first thing.  Actually as long as Yuuna is fine in the end I'd love any ending I guess. <br>The whole Takashima deal makes all this a bit complicated though. I think because of the <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br>we can assume that Yuuna either has <br>A. The memories of Takashima<br>B. Is Takashima<br>Just being named after her won't work now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God I need these YuYuYu Character songs now.<br>I am in need of healing.</br>  <br>Or may be Takashima   is Leo </br>  <br>Or maybe Takashima got absorbed by Leo, and now both got absorbed by Yuuna.</br>  <br><br><br>It would make a lot of sense that the humans dying within that small world reincarnate over and over again as they have nowhere else to go.<br>I like this idea a lot </br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Yuuna unintentionally absorbed Leo as fuel and is slowly becoming a godess theory. As time goes on she is becoming more aware of the past events and her blacking out is the recalling of past events triggered by her immediate surroundings. That play that they put on may have actually occurred word for word in the past.</br>   mfw all the people who got crazy about Yuuna's fainting after ep.12 aired were right after all   Guys, I think we're too naive to thinks that there'll be any scans in the near future. Remember that this is from a Visual Fanbook, not a magazine, not many people are willing to dissect their book to scan it.  <br><br>Makes me wonder why there are no paper-thin flexible scanners. There are paper-thin flexible displays, shouldn't be too hard to create something like that using a combination of microscopic light sources and detectors that basically create a snapshot of the surface they're put on.</br></br>  <br>T-try not to give up ;_;</br>  i need more healing already...  <br>Just gives me incentive to buy the books myself.</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Healing when ;_;</br>  <br>Staying true in her time of struggle, eh?</br>  <br>Alright, here's Yuuki Yuuna 24-hour coverage, edited/retranslated: http://pastebin.com/QpW8Dys6<br><br>Note that the original TLs don't distinguish between Tougou dialogue and Tougou narration - I've left it as is, but if you get confused anywhere let me know.<br><br>Actually, the original translations were a lot worse for this one, reading like a machine translation at times - my favourite parts were the copy-paste definition of 顔パス - "free admission for being well known" and the translation of 国語 as "national language" instead of Japanese. <br><br>Note everyone that this scenario contains the most information about Yuuna's post-recovery status that we get in the VN.<br><br> Tougou: There are still mysteries left, but with everyone, I'm sure... <br> Tougou: I casually raise my head to the sky. <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tougou is becoming a stalker.<br><br>Also<br> Tougou: However, did they really return? <br> Tougou: Could it be that we were granted something new...? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Takahiro! i'm not ready for this!</br>  <br>No need for that, my copy will arrive in about 4 days. If there's still no scans for 2nd translator anon, I'll take up the task myself.<br><br><br> Yuuna's soul (consciousness) fused with Leo and then got taken away as offering. <br> When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br>I can see this happening.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Tougou: ...I let them know about being chosen as an offering. <br> Tougou: However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Tougou: Just being delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>About this part, I think it should be<br> ...My parents knew about me being chosen as offering. <br> However, no one is to blame for the human sacrifices. <br> Just seeing how they're so delighted with my recovery is sufficient. <br>As seen in Wasuyu, Taisha only hid the truth from the heroes, not their parents so it'd be weird for Tougou to be the one letting them know. Her parents knew the truth and didn't do anything about it, however, seeing how they still truly care about her, she doesn't blame them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Such a mature behaviour from a teenaged girl really strains my suspension of disbelief.<br> Just kidding. </br></br></br>  <br>It's 喜んでくれただけで, which definitely means that the parents are the one's being delighted with Tougou's recovery. I think I intended it to be "Just them being delighted with my recovery is sufficient" but accidentally a word. Sorry.</br>  <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br>  <br>However, the "let them know" is correct, 知らされていた definitely implies Tougou imparting the information to her parents.</br>  <br>Wait nevermind, I'm an idiot. The information was imparted to the parents but not by Tougou, you were right.</br>  <br><br>I love Karin</br></br>    <br>She looks like a mix between Sonoko and Wasshi.</br>  <br><br>That's a fucking glorious hairstyle.</br></br>  <br>Hot damn, she looks like some bad-ass Taisha hitwoman</br>  <br> Or may be Takashima is Leo <br>Or may be Takashima Yunna is   Yuuki Yuuna, when she is in coma. Mental time travel yo. So they actually foreshadow it in the spin off?? Damn. </br></br>  <br> time travel shenanigans <br><br>Now we're talking.</br></br></br>   Standing on top of Kamagura castle's inner right citadel in Kaogawa prefecture, Nogi Wakaba stared at Seto Inland sea.  <br>6 main characters:<br> Nogi Wakaba <br> Kamisato Hinata <br> Takashima Yuuna <br> Gun Chikage <br> Doi Tamako <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br><br>Tfw Wakaba's flower is the same as Tougou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to mention, for this one, Takahiro's just in charge of planning, Akashiro Aoi'll be the one writing it.</br>  <br> Gun Chikage <br><br>I hope that is also her weapon of choice.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So I missed a few threads, this is going to be another LN series like WaSuYu?</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll be about the very first group of hero back in the time before they changed the calendar.</br>  <br> Iyoshima Anzu <br>Actually, it's "Iyojima Anzu".</br></br>  <br>Elysium works fine, Bloatgirls if you desire so.<br><br> Lesbian <br> LESBIAN <br>You delusional fuck she even writes that her dream is to become a wife.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's Marugame Castle, which is the one that Sumi visited with her mother in episode 10.<br>So the setting will probably be the same as WaSuYu's, meaning that the old Yuushas won't have to see their homes turn to fire at the end of the LN.</br></br>  <br>Elysium's release is overfiltered garbage.</br>  <br>Yeah, my mistake, it's Marugame castle.<br>Their home won't turn into fire but the rest of the world might. <br><br>Got another interesting detail in the new chapter<br> Sonoko talks about the type of person she likes. <br>  &gt;It sounds exactly like she's describing Wasshi.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/651<wbr>19<br> 2018 <br> mfw 2015 nao <br>THE SUFFERING NEVER ENDS<br>WE HAVE NO FUTURE</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>I don't really know how to tell the difference man, the only thing I can measure is blurriness and even that I'm not very good at.</br>  <br>Tfw Vertices's attack is in 2015. We'll never get to read it. <br>All joking aside, they probably just fucked the release date. Officially, the Visual Fanbook's supposed to be released on 30th yet they're selling it now.</br></br>  Still no scans.  <br><br>2018.7.30 is the date when the novel events happen.<br>The novel starts being published in September's Dengeki this year.</br></br></br>  <br>The Hero Record was written starting from 2015, though.</br>  <br>Then maybe it doesn't start with the very first event?<br>I mean what the fuck else could 2018.7.30 stand for.<br>Alternative idea: maybe we're starting off with a few members and gain a big party by that date, there are 6 people to be collected after all.</br></br></br>  It can't arrive soon enough.  <br>We're counting on you, anon.</br>  Even if we get no scans this time there'll still be translation as some of us also bought the book. The problem is when Nowayu starts, there're no guarantee that each chapter'll get scanned as soon as it comes out or at all.  <br>I wasn't arround when WaSuYu got scanned but there were no problems that time as far as I know so why would it be different now?</br>  <br>WaSuYu has been out for months before the anime started and translations began.<br>We only really had to wait for the final chapter.</br></br>  <br>And the final chapter never got scanned, an anon had to the digital version released half a month later of the magazine. If Nowayu has no scans, who in here has enough money and is willing to keep buying the magazine for ~8 months straight?</br>    <br> High quality scan <br>is it happening!?</br></br>    <br> I'm feeling healed already </br>    <br>glorious school girl with Japanese sword and ponytail.</br>  <br>I want to touch their marshmallows<br><br> that underwater navel peek <br>too lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br> Katana <br>Meh.<br>Hopefully they have someone with a mace/flail/staff/anything blunt in the new old crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we're going to get an axe again. <br>Her sword looks quite special to not be used in actual combat. Maybe they're going to fight without transforming and just got some stats boost this time. <br> No fairy <br> No magical armor <br>I wonder how many of the main 6 will pull a Gin before the final chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>or get one hit killed by scorpion in the guts.</br>  <br>Its been three hundred years, They could be related.</br>  <br>Where does this leave Gin now anyway?<br>There were six Yuusha in the past- not seven.<br>So either Gin or one of the six remaining girls in 300 cannot be a reincarnation of one of the six girls in the past.<br>Could this mean- Gin's death was an accident? She was never supposed to have been a Yuusha?<br>Or is one of the current girls not supposed to be a Yuusha? Which one would it be? Itsuki? She only became one to be with her sister. Or Karin? Who only became one because another Yuusha died?<br> They are creating way more questions with this story than they are answering.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody said they have to be a reincarnation.</br>  <br>Is it back in stock? Or did they really sell out in the first 30 minutes it was on sale?</br>  <br>so last night I posted this<br>and today I come home and find this: <br>She even carries a sword as her weapon.<br>An Ikemen mahout shoujou named Wakaba who even carries a sword! At least they changed the hair and eye color.<br>Will this Wakaba princess carry loli's as well?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hoenstly think the chance of one of the Yuushas being a loli is pretty high.  Gotta please the audience. </br>  <br>I don't care as long as there's a megane Yuusha.<br>Seriously.<br>Come on.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is this? Sonoko's little sister?</br>  <br>Sonoko's ancestor.</br>  <br> 2014 <br> yuuna punches a thing <br> 2015 <br> yuuna is a thing <br>What went wrong?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This really makes it look like Sonoko is entering the Karinbowl. To win.</br></br>  <br>Don't lose hope. Sonoko After got translated based only on cellphone pictures.</br>  So will Takashima finally get an awesome red scarf of badassitude  <br>I thought Itsuki was the acting loli since she was only 12?</br>  <br> &gt;When Shinju "returned" the offerings, it "accidentally" mistook Yuuki Yuuna's soul with Takashima Yuuna's because they're too similar. <br><br>Who in the name of fuck is Takashima?</br></br></br>  <br> Only leaves wincest route left <br>Praise be to Sonoko.</br></br>  <br>One of the original yuushas, along with Wakaba.</br>  <br>But when asked what type of person she likes, Sonoko basically described Wasshi, or so I heard.</br>  <br> Itsuki &amp; Fuu <br> non-straight <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>I pick Itsuki  x  Fuu</br>    <br>Yes, but she has to face reality like Karin had to. Maybe that was the real reason Sonoko cried in episode 8. If the Vita game is canon she already knew Togo had lost her memories.<br>So it makes more sense that when she saw Yuuna with her that she realized that Togo had found someone else.</br></br>  <br>What's going on? Where did this scan come from? Why isn't there more?</br>  I wish Gin was here.  <br>I think having flowers floating in the bathwater is pretty gay.<br>Especially if the flowers are all the character flowers of you and the other girl you are sharing the bath with.</br></br>  <br>It's Vertices, not Vertexes.</br>  <br>Well we will find out now if its true she died because Taisha made her fight with 300 year old weapons.</br>  <br>probably of someone who made a scan of the cover.<br>Probably no scans of the insides because it might hurt the book.</br></br>  <br>But anon, it'd be really dangerous if she drops her megane or if it's broken in the middle of a fight.</br>  <br>But the cover is . That oughta be a page in the middle. Unless the LN chapter comes in a separate booklet.</br>  <br>noun [C] uk /ˈvɜː.teks/ us /ˈvɝː.t̬eks/ (plural vertices or vertexes) specialized</br>  Got the details of Sonoko's type now<br> Someone who is serious, good at taking care of people but also gets out of control sometimes. </br>  <br>She'd like Shirou.</br>  <br>Cant that apply to Karin? She is certainly serious.</br>  <br>Why are Sonoko and Karin sharing a rose bath together?</br>  <br>Well it was one of the sleepovers.<br>But the flowers were Sonoko's idea.<br>(She is also the only one with enough yen to buy a couple dozen roses just to cut up to do this)</br></br></br>  <br> She is certainly serious. <br>About muscle training and supplement. And she certainly isn't that good about taking care of people, Tougou and Fuu have to force her eats proper foods from time to time.</br></br>  <br>Sonoko is making some advances</br>  <br>Flowers smell nice.</br>  <br><br>It doesn't work like that if you take the future setting into account where loads of girls can become heroes.</br></br>  <br>I want to smell Karin.</br>  <br>It's more about genetics.<br>Those girls who have the most compatible genes (aptitude) can become Yuushas.<br>Thats why the big familys close to Taisha came to exist. But because those families couldn't always produce offspring that could be used they changed it to look for girls outside those familys.</br></br></br>  <br>It is not same as Tougou. It is Balloon flower [as analyzed by communities i am in], which is very similar but still different. Its flower language is endless love, honesty, the return of a friend is desired, obedience, changless love, amiable romance and so on.</br>  <br>Gin became  Yoshiteru. </br>  <br>Fuck</br>  <br>It's been pretty clear for a while now that Karin's subtext-endgame is Fuu.</br>  <br>Who is Itsuki's subtext-endgame with? Why is there always an odd number?</br>   The Yuuna at the end of episode 12 and who returned to Togo is actually an ancient Yuuna imposter from 2015.  <br><br>what</br></br>  <br>what</br>  <br><br/></br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>84327<br>Is this another remix album, or maybe unused music?</br></wbr>  <br>Music that wasn't included in the first OST, VN exclusive BGMs, Forestize Warning, Emergency Warning, and Emergency Warning "Censored Version" (the one from episode 10) and Inori no Uta.</br>  Wait, are we gonna get a S2 and things are gonna go back to being fire instead of fine?      <br>everything was on fire from the beginning</br>  <br>Cool. I can't get enough of the warnings.</br>  I refuse to believe these spoilers until I've seen the scans for myself.<br>I invite you all to do the same.</br>  さあさあ has never been the same after Karin's awesome fight. I grin like an idiot every time I think of it.  <br>I hope so</br>  <br>And I think of it every time I hear someone say it.</br>  <br>They sound pretty believable. Can't say the same about a lot of the speculation done after them in this thread.</br>  <br>too bad the one i ordered still haven't leave Japan...</br>  <br> 2015 <br>is this legit</br></br>  <br>  The Yuuna at the end of episode 12 and who returned to Togo is actually an ancient Yuuna imposter from 2015.  <br><br>Wouldn't Yuuna-15 freak out what the hell is going on and who all those people are?<br>Or does she not give a fuck and just rolls with it? Because that would be hilariously awesome.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she has the memories of current Yuuna</br>  <br>I think she understands whats happened and doesn't want to cause issues so is trying to impersonate Yuki to the best of her ability.</br>  <br>No, it's the real Yuuna! It has to be. I won't believe it...</br>  <br><br>Absurd.</br></br>  <br>I'm with this anon. All of those happy moments at the end can't have been lies. I think it's more likely that Yuuna's soul traveled back in time somehow while she was a potato and that's why she recognized Wakaba. My bet is that Takashima Yuuna is none other than Yuuki Yuuna.</br>  Yuuna was never taken by Shinju in the first place, it was because of the Leo core. If anything, she's the one who was sent through time during her coma and is impersonating Takashima in the LN.  <br><br>This sounds like the most plausible explanation and I like it.<br>Also<br> 1 post apart </br></br></br></br>    <br>NERD</br>  <br> Yuna and Togo finally get to fucking <br> Yuna stops halfway <br> Can't proceed knowing she's not the same Yuna Togo loved <br> Angst ensures </br></br></br></br>  <br>I posted that as a joke tweeeeest when we first learned Takashima's name, but it's actually looking surprisingly plausible now.</br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br><br>Aaaand here we go again or, more accurately, the ride never actually ended. It was all just an illusion to dull our senses into a false state of security.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yep.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yuuna going back in time certainly sounds more plausible than "lol ancestor hijack".<br><br>In b4 Yuuna's time fuckery is the trigger that caused the gods to fuck humanity in the first place</br></br></br></br>    <br>Well, if she caused the whole problem it makes sense she's the hero that has to solve it, then.</br>  <br>Well.... most time travel war story ends up like this<br>Like Achron.   Inb4 Leo is built according to Yuuna.  </br></br>  <br> Yuuna going back in time is what caused the vertexes to attack earth <br> the vertex invasion is what ultimately led Yuuna to go back in time <br>That's why time travel shenanigans aren't a very good idea.<br><br>Still, we do have a precedent for time travel if you take that special 4koma chapter to be canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But Anon, that's how the Shinju-sama ACTUALLY fight the infinitely regenerating heavenly god! Trap them in a stable time loop!</br>  <br>If anthing, Yuuna would bring the Vertex core with her that is used a base for Vertex back in 2015.</br>  <br>We'll go full Night Watch. Whatever caused the time travel fuckery gets original hero Takashima Keel killed early, Yuuna has to take her place and preserve history (and humanity) by establishing the Hero System and beating back the first wave of Vertex in order to ensure that there even is "present" left for her to return to.</br>  <br> Takashima Keel <br>  Keel <br><br>Wait, was that name confirmed before?</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>I don't follow these threads since the end of the anime, what does than mean? What is shen then?</br></br>  <br>we don't know either, we all still waiting for actual scans and then the translation.</br>  <br>Vertex, probably.<br>If you watched the last episode you might have an idea.</br></br>  <br><br>So Yuuna was never human or maybe the human Yuuna got replaced by the Vertex Yuuna?</br></br>  <br>Keel was the character who died at the start of Night Watch.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she writes that her dream is to have a wife.</br>  <br>Why are bloatgrils so bloaty anyway?</br>  Why is Niboshi so good?<br>Karin has some god tier taste.</br>  <br>  Tougou got her waifu killed and replaced by an alien bodysnatching murderbot <br><br>I could smell the angst if something like this happened.<br><br>What if Yuuna's soul actually never returned and we got Shinju-sama occupying her body instead?</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Niboshi <br>Gross.</br></br>    Does 2ch copy our threads?  <br>why?<br>what are they posting?</br></br>  because <br>I wonder if they had copied any of our speculation too</br>  <br>dunno, don't even know how to navigate their site.<br>horrendous to find out if they even have a thread up.</br></br>  This feels too much like post episode 11. I'm scared<br><br><br>You really missed out, it was crazy.<br><br><br>Yay!<br><br><br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human. <br>pls no<br><br><br>Please be healing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And I'm done editing. The script file with the 4 translated and updated chapters (8-10-11-12) is here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/3<wbr>d5ilb4163gbqxq/script.dat <br>Everything else is uploaded to the usual folder (https://www.mediafire.com/folder/6<wbr>705q59djxz5n/YuYuYuS)<br>I also updated the instructions since it's not necessary to break lines anymore (I updated the previously translated chapters accordingly) and it's not necessary to write names with the japanese text and @, just the translation.<br>Since it takes so long to work out the line breaks I made a little application to test the scripts before adding them to the game, it sped things a little (also uploaded in the utilities folder).<br>With this 1/3 of the translation is done, thanks translators for the hard work!<br><br>PS.

Plus it made Kureha and Kanata react strangely and made Kureha say pic related.</br>  <br>I was certain they meant the fact Noel is well, eccentric as fuck and they were trying to calm her down with"don't worry, someone will marry you for sure someday", but now I'm not that sure.</br>  <br> Tougou: Since it is noon, the stars aren't visible. <br>For some reason, that line makes me even uneasier than the 0% human thing</br></br>  Bah, there's no way S2 would be better than S1 anyways.  <br>There's that too, but don't forget that her and Alisha were gaying it up quite a bit in the last couple of episodes, and that Noel uses boku. <br><br>I'm a yurifag but I don't tend to activate my goggles unless I see good evidence. I didn't really see any yuri in Pleiades, for example (which will definitely be another really bad case of S2 never)</br></br></br>  <br>At the end of the sequel, Yuuna'll manage to raise up her human part to 80% just like Parunyasu.</br>  <br>Did you watch Etotama?</br>  <br>No, but I've heard that it's a fun series. I was thinking of checking it out.</br>  I really want to see that artwork with everyone looking at wakabas picture. I am worried about Yuuna ;_;  <br>Me either, I heard decent things on the yuri front though and it's refreshing to come across a yurifag with objectivity. I can subtext into anything, but I'm also willing to admit when it's just wishful thinking on my part.</br>  <br>Yurishipping is supposed to be a fun thing, I'm well aware that we probably won't ever get confirmation in any shows with subtext (although Tougou being confirmed as being at least Yuunasexual is hopeful). <br><br>I think that being overly serious and autistic about yuri and het should be left to tumblr and their ilk.</br></br></br>  <br>Never lose hope in those shows nor in this one.

Now they have me worried that it is something sinister.</br>  <br>It could be both. Either way Tougou will save her, because so far she hasn't done anything heroic, so it's her turn.</br>  It's been a while since I was in one of these threads. I really need to read these LNs already.<br><br><br> Yuuna might turn out to be 0% human <br>The ride never ends.</br></br></br></br>  Already has fanart.

Will you tell me if they hint at it? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, this better have scans.</br>  <br>Download the 2nd VN and the script link here <br><br>You can find a link of the 2nd VN in one of the previous threads, then copy the script to the VN folder and just play it.</br></br></br>  <br> this better have scans </br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.<br><br> But seriously, I can't go through all that trouble on my shit toaster. How ecchi is that scene? Will you tell me if they hint at it? </br></br></br></br>  <br>No bully</br>  <br>It's just a vn anon, I'm sure it'd run on any toaster. Play them both, they're fun!</br>  I want to fuck Yuuna.  <br>Which Yuuna?<br> &gt;inb4 they're the same </br></br>  <br> When Yuuna looks at Wakaba's picture, she's a bit surprised but also has an "of course that's how it is" reaction. <br> She spaces out and only comes back to her sense when Fuu calls out to her. <br> Yuuna's the only one with her eyes hidden in the pic. <br>Guys, maybe it's indeed a body hijack, but it's not by Takashima   but instead by Wakaba </br></br></br></br>  <br>Noticed a small typo in Fuu's scenario.</br>  Fuck.<br>It still hurts.</br>  <br> scans <br><br>I feel you.</br></br></br>  <br>It'll be futa anyway.</br>  I was gone for almost two months on medical reasons and I lost pretty much all of Born. Just got it downloaded from episodes 5 onwards and im going to watch it now, but im a bit surprised. No specials or ovas? or am i looking for them wrong?  Here ya go.<br>http://deadfish-encod.es/index/high<wbr>_school_dxd_born/0-876</wbr></br>  There was also an OVA but it was labeled as NEW 13.  Now be warned that if you are familiar with the LNs then you may be surprised when BorN has definite changes from them.  <br>What medical reasons?</br>  <br>had to travel for 2 surgeries<br><br><br>I am.<br><br>What im saying is, there are no OVAs yet? no special episodes?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Mother of god  <br>The season just finished.</br>  Posting best doujin  <br>Travel where for what kind of surgeries?</br>  <br>Surgeries on both his balls, stop asking questions</br>  Another Ophis special fucking where?  what the fuck is the deal with this fucking family?<br><br>did I miss a season where they explained why the Yukinoshita family is so fucking strange and horrible?</br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  The ride is over, now what?<br>That family is just fucked up, OP-kun.<br> </br></br> </br></br>  Two, actually. Season 1, and season 2.  <br>Ah, welcome back, captain!</br>  <br>Thanks, I drink too much at the end of a season that I enjoyed.</br>  <br><br>What is affluenza for 500?</br></br>  <br><br> ride is over <br> anime ended on a cliff hanger <br><br>Ride has just begun anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br><br>We're missing too much information to know exactly what the deal is with that family. How healthy or unhealthy they are remains to be seen.<br><br>All we know is that they produced one warped but very capable daughter and one warped but extremely incapable daughter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually it's not been covered properly yet, they've just been dropping hints (In the LN mostly, anime cut a bunch). We'll have to wait on the volume 11 translations (In which Yukino will hopefully finally explain it to Yui and Hachiman).</br>  <br>No, it's a shitty show where basically nothing is ever explained so it makes little sense unless you've read the source material and the fact that it is so objectively vague encourages conversation about it all the time because everyone interprets it differently. But not because it's a rich piece of art with many interesting things to discuss. Rather because it's just kind of a bad show but /a/ is invested because the self-insert as 8inch.</br>  <br>This whole show is fucking awkward drama. <br>Jesus christ it is physically hurting me to watch right now. <br>Why is everyone socially retarded in this.<br><br>Why can't it just be fun like the first season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sure but she's been doing that effectively the entire series. I mean the first GENUINE scene would not have happened without her.<br><br>Viewing it all as a scheme by her just to help her friends suggests no actual growth on her part.<br><br>At least to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to that anon that insisted Yukino would never like 8man and that there would never be a love triangle? He also said that Yui wouldn't be hurt by losing 8man and was falling out of love with him.  <br> The ride is over <br><br>I want to believe so but for some reason I just keep coming back.</br></br></br>  <br><br>fucking this it doesn't even make sense any more its just awkward moments and bizarre passive aggressive conversations that are never explained</br></br>  <br><br>It suffers heavily from "read the LN for context" syndrome.</br></br>  <br>continuing fro last thread.<br><br><br>From LN vol 9 ch 3<br><br> “…Are you going to do it by yourself again?” <br><br> Even in this encroaching darkness, I could see her face very clearly. Her sorrowful cast down eyes and the weakly biting of her lips. I even thought that I did all this just so she didn’t have to make that kind of face. <br><br> As I tried to push away the squeezing feeling in my chest, I quickly moved my feet forward. <br><br>by your definition 8man loves Yui, isn't it?<br><br>Oh something more to add from Vol 10,5 ch 3 :<br><br> With a feeling of bewilderment, I found myself turning around to see Yuigahama wearing a frail smile. <br><br> “…I don’t really like seeing you in pain, Hikki.” <br><br>So their love is Mutual isn't it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Yuckyno YukinoSHITa is the worst girl.  <br>Her issues and love are two different things.<br>She already had an interest in 8man before those issues even began to surface, by the time she fell in love with him he did the Ebina confession which caused her "unexplainable feelings" that she hated.<br>After the whole StuCo thing he betrayed her expectations again, kinda contrasting the same way she betrayed his, at this point she was trying to fall out of love telling him to stop forcing himself to show up if he didn't want to, and to not be considerate of her and Yui.<br>Once "genuine" happened, the Ice Queen was already melting away, instead of falling out of love she fell even harder for him.<br>None of this was her being dependent on him.<br><br><br>I want to believe that Hachiman is in love with her but he needs to realize it first.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   gay marriage is legal now <br> no one posting that shitty trap <br><br>Senseifags where are you? you guys are more tolerable than these iroha/yui queers</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that there isn't a love triangle and Yukino isn't in love with 8man (read her memorandum) <br><br>Houly reminder that there is only one girl who loves her Hikki.</br></br>  <br>Yuifag, the LN is written to be a cash cow. The fictitious girls all have a good stake for a damn good reason: moolah.<br><br>The anime's ending reflects this, and the director's inability to work past it. The possibility for spinoff material remains open, if the LN closes sometime soon, and nobody is terribly inflamed with this ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Typical k-drama rich family.</br>  <br><br>8man has very unreliable narration when it comes to Iroha. Take their date for instance.<br><br> Our walking pace must’ve dropped due to the both of us thinking how much trouble we were. <br><br>Do you think someone would walk slower with someone they're irritated by? 8man goes as far as making an oxymoron because he won't admit to the narrative that he had fun. In fact in general he only really has poor things about the date, but by the end it's clear he enjoyed himself.<br><br>8man is tsun as fuck for Iroha and it's clear he wouldn't internally admit it even if he did love her. Granted, that doesn't mean we can just assume every love where he says he's not in love with her, that he actually is. However, it does at least mean we have to account for the possibility of unreliable narration.<br><br>I think the chocolate scene was a bigger deal because it's the closest he's come to actually, honestly admitting his feelings for any girl. However, that doesn't mean the cookie scene can be written off as nothing. 8man was clearly very excited to get something baked by Iroha, especially when you compare his reaction to later for instance. He's emotionally touched by getting Yui's cookies, however he's not frozen, blushing, and thinking about love in his own roundabout fashion when he gets them from her. (Granted the mood is different as well, but there's still a clearly observable difference.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is 8man still your dark knight, /a/?  <br>Reporting for duty. Marriage inbound.</br>  <br>But that doesn't involve roundabout conversations. Also, no bitchy mother in laws or Kimchi throwing</br>    <br>It's not Yui because she likes Tobe.</br>  <br>Yui end confirmed.</br>  After watching EP 13 I get the impression Yui isn't actually in love with 8man.  What volume is the anime at?     If only the girls had a reliable man like Shirou Emiya.  <br>No, what happened at the aquarium is very different from what happened during Genuine and before that.<br><br>Yui was working from two directions at once- the part of her that was afraid of losing her friends actually wanted them to accept her proposal so they could just go into superficial friendship stasis and wouldn't have to be hurt<br><br>Another part of her knew they (or at least 8man) would never accept it, because that part of her knew as well that her proposal was wrong. She put it out there knowing that, but hoping that somehow 8man could come up with something that could let her finally reject it and get her moving towards a new answer.</br></br></br></br></br>      So we'll be getting OVAs next?  <br>Anon, no matter what you say, Yuifags and Yukinofags will always dismiss Iroha as nonexistent.<br><br>Irohabros are just sitting back furiously masturbating to those spoilers.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably with the VN or sometime after the BDs release.</br>  <br>SENSEI WINS</br>  <br>We've already established that the anime director is a biased Yukinofag.<br><br>He basically removed every 8man monologue/scene/reactions that suggest he MAY has feeling for Yui.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the name of this?</br>  <br><br><br>Because 8man won't genuine any one girl by the time he graduates, he'll end up marrying sensei and feeling feels.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, that makes Sensei the most realistic choice to 8man.<br><br><br>Ahoy!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yukino isn't in love with 8man (read her memorandum) <br>Really? Wouldn't more people be talking about it if it was true?</br></br>  <br><br>It was effectively the same thing. There are arguments about Yui's motivations in that ending scene and whether she really wanted her proposal to be accepted or not, but regardless what she did was bring the two loners together yet again.<br><br>I'd like to think that she wanted her proposal to be accepted and this was actually an aggressive move on her part to "take a step" and finally get what she's wanted all this time. But it's hard to reconcile with a few other details of that 'date'.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  I think he's a good Onii-chan.<br>I wouldn't mind being his imouto. I've even let people know we were related.</br>  Can someone describe all the main characters motivations in a single sentence or    <br><br>Obviously Yui likes Hikki and Yukino likes the elusive cookie man. But the cookie man only has eyes for Yui.<br><br>So it's not a love triangle, it's a love quadrilateral.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay so I'm actually pretty retarded and I always forget the name of this every fucking time before I actually watch it. Totsuka should win Hikky's heart btw.</br>  <br>They all want to have sex with their mom.<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>The fact that they're all ignoring your post proves this anon right. <br><br>Somebody else said that these threads are accurate depictions of what's going on in the novel, Yui and Yukino are too busy having at each other and causing drama while Iroha is getting flag after flag after flag under their radar.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't want to accept it.</br>  <br>But cookieman is 8man.<br>So 8man loves Yui.<br><br>YUI END CONFIRMED</br></br></br></br>    <br>I didn't understand any of their plotting at the end of 13... can you elaborate?</br>  Does Hachiman actually have feelings for Yui? People keep spouting that Vol 11 suggests this. <br><br>People posted spoiles and kanji that supposedly were flags but all I saw were instances of him showing a code of honor. <br><br>Please post snippets that show he has feelings for Yui</br></br></br></br>  <br>this picture reminds me how good S1 was compared to all the angsty drama that s2 was, also that band scene was pretty cool</br>  <br><br>Nah cookie man is on sesame street. 8man is reaching and misinterpreting Yui in thinking it's him.</br></br>  <br>le influential powerful traditional nihongo family trope</br>  <br><br><br>From the LN, it's already been posted. However, it is clearest that 8man has feelings for Sensei -- he unabashedly explains this because he is most comfortable with dynamic personalities.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone will post the long wall of text shortly I'm sure. I dunno if it's actually right though. People tend to think long wall of text must be true.</br></br>  <br>8man jelly scene in volume 6,5 is the biggest indicator of it.</br>   There’s something I want. <br> No matter how much I rack my head over it, I could arrive at only one, permissible answer. But mysteriously enough, it’s accompanied by an echo of ambiguity. <br> That’s why, I actually don’t have a tangible understanding of what it really is. <br> However, every time the words leave my lips, I break into a smile, overcome with the desire to hold my head from embarrassment. <br><br>What does she want if it the thing that it isn't are companionship, friendship, or love?</br></br></br></br></br>  This season needed more Shizuka.  <br>Yukino's issues and her love for 8man are connected, no matter how much you seem to want to believe they aren't.

She is one of the only dynamic characters anyway (aside from 8man, that is), so why bring her down to the others' level?</br></br></br></br>      <br>Cool thanks. <br><br>Honestly, with the way he reacts with Yui/Yukino, he should just have a 3way with them. Forget the penguins.</br></br></br>  <br>After seeing this for some reason i get a feeling why 8man keep looking Hayama group talk in class for knowing what actually Yui do within group(Keeping eye on her).</br>  <br>Anything from S1 returning is a breath of fresh air from all the Yukinoshit drama, honestly.</br>  <br><br><br>Sensei is best option</br></br></br>  <br>I'm guessing as a secondary that Haruno got the full dose of Yukinomom's shit early on and really doesn't want her imouto becoming Yukinomom jr. and is doing her best to steer Yukino off that path. The problem is that Haruno is fairly warped herself and can't really do shit without being heavy handed about it, causing Yukinon to flinch away from anything Haruno says. <br><br>Yukinon is well aware of how manipulative her mother is, but is not as aware of how she is manifesting the same traits herself. She went on an imitation spree with Haruno as her way of thumbing at her mother, but outside of that doesn't know how to operate outside of that. Or something like that.<br><br>Can Freud-anon psychoanalyze this family please?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>pic related</br></br></br>  <br>Is it obvious that there is still a love triangle? It was kinda vague.</br>  <br>So now what? wait for OVA? And what about Volumen 11?</br>  <br><br>And with that, I leave for the day. STAY STRONG, SENSEIFAGS.</br></br>  <br>GARdere sensei. Which I guess would be sort of what we've seen so far- sometimes sweet, sometimes offering hot-blooded advice and/or violence for encouragement.</br>    <br>Well when he looks at Yui and the Hayama group there's always another motivation for Hachiman to do so<br><br>Forgot the volume, but in stuco election, he looked at her because he was comparing the Hayama group to the situation they were in<br><br>10 had him looking at the group to figure out how to get closer to Hayama. Also he looked at the group when Ooka spurted that Yukino was dating Hayama <br><br>11 had him looking at her because of their conversation about homemade treats (and he made connection between Yui's cookies and him)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So who else didn't see the love triangle coming?</br>  <br><br>Wait, it's dangerous;  take her with you, for SCIENCE reasons of course. </br></br>  <br><br>That's not best girl though</br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't surprise me, <br>in volume 10.5 he also dissuaded Yui to join the college social club out of the exact same reason.</br></br></br>    <br> We'll be honest about our feelings no matter how scary it might be <br> no more love triangle. </br></br>  <br>It could be that Haruno really cares for Yukino, but at the same time seeing OP's screencap it seems like she's bitter she had to get all her life arranged by her family while Yukino made all her choices herself, even if she ended up following her sister quite closely. I don't know anymore.</br>  <br>Have they say something about any OVAs guys?</br>    <br>Wait where in 10.5 was that? I don't remember anything like that come up but I am thirsty as hell for some more 8man being possessive of Yui.</br>  Do you think Yuimom knows Yui is in love with Hikki-kun? What do you think Yui says about Hikki? Maybe she talks about how he is gross.  <br> 8man being possessive of Yui. <br>How does Yui think about all this?</br></br>  <br>Interesting.<br><br>So Haruno is forced to live a life she doesn't want and begrudges Yukino for having freedom but not utilizing it.<br><br> Maybe Yukino's request is to help Haruno and Hayama escape the influence of their families. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably is frustrated that her sister having all that liberty is doing the same things as her, and in a mix of trying to help but also some resentment is what make her act so bitchy.</br>  If 8man wins the club contest at the end, I hope his wish is for him to be with sensei.  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.  Is vol 11 out?  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br> “That’s your reason!? I got happy for nothing…” Yuigahama dropped her shoulders and looked away. No, no, it’s not like I said you weren’t cute or anything, yes. I was just saying that if it’s you, you could easily fit in with these enthusiastic, go-go university students, yes. It’s just, you know, I don’t think it’s a good thing if you let those people drag you into their pace! </br>  <br>She would call him gross but blush furiously and be really happy about it. She might act more dere to him for it.</br>  <br>If there is still a love triangle how well will it play out if they are honest about them?</br>  Anyone thiknk Hachiman looks stupid the way ponkan drew him in Vol 11. His face and hair is derpier than usual.<br><br>Anime 8man &gt;LN</br></br>  <br>Getting mad at the only one taking initiative in the entire season.</br>  <br>Gamama definitely knows Yui is in love with Hikki-kun. Yui probably only talks about stuff they've done in club and brings him up that way rather than him being the direct topic of conversation, but that's enough for a mom to know.<br><br><br>Pretty sure he didn't give anything away about how he was feeling in 6.5, and from  (thanks by the way, I remember that bit now) it looks like she was hoping he was jealous but he managed to play it off. Don't know exactly how the scene in interlude A will play out but I'm excited for it now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fairly well from the look of things. Someone's feelings are going to get hurt, but they all care enough about each other that it's not going to create any sort of permanent rift between them.</br>  <br>To be fair, I'd be pretty bitchy too if I had a sibling as autistic as Yukino who was always trying to one-up my past accomplishments.</br>  <br> Yui probably only talks about stuff they've done in club and brings him up that way rather than him being the direct topic of conversation, but that's enough for a mom to know. <br>How would she figure? By Yui's body language or the fact that he is the only boy she brings up. I am sure Yui has made some sort of comment about him.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Gahamama know that he is the boy who saved their dog?</br>  <br><br>What is this.<br><br>I need to feed my sensei fetish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's that demon king harem show that aired in Winter. Don't remember the name. <br><br>He fucks her by the way.</br></br></br>  Which is more feasible? An OVA, a movie, or another season?  <br><br>Why was I born too early?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=JlC<wbr>k6Z2HZxY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>OVA not enough content for a new season, unless he somehow pumps out 4 volumes within 2 years and they somehow drag out the episodes.</br>  <br> He fucks her by the way. <br>BOTH CANONICALLY VIRGINS TO THIS DAY</br></br>  <br>They had to resort to being vague because they were running out of source material</br>  <br>As much as I'd like a season 3, this would be more practical. I would like to see a movie though, because they could spoil us with glorious animation and 4k suffering.</br>  <br>Shinmai something something?</br>  It's just simply shit anime  girls probability of winning the 8bowl as of vol 11<br><br>yukino: 50%<br>yui: 45%<br>iroha: 3%<br>harem/friendship end: 1.9%<br>any other: 0.1%</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OVA. not enough material for another season unless it stretches out to volume 14 or volume 15, by which point it would be too much of a good thing.</br>  <br>Yeah, that one. <br><br>Pretty sure I fapped to the official manga adaptation chapter that has them fucking. Maybe it wasn't full on benis in vagina, I don't remember, but there was definitely paizuri.</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>ALL IN ON SAKI</br>  Vol 1:<br> As I watched her, a strange feeling suddenly overcame me. <br> She and I are certainly alike in some way. I found myself thinking that in spite of myself. <br> The silence in that moment somehow felt nice. <br> I felt my heart beat a little faster. It was like my heart was saying it wanted to beat faster than the ticking of the second hand and beyond.  <br><br><br>Vol 6:<br> Maybe that’s why. Maybe that’s why, whenever we exchange words like this, it always feels refreshing and pleasant. <br> I felt the remaining passion from the festival welling up in my body. I posed the question again and the new answer I arrived at is my conclusion. <br> So maybe. <br> So maybe she and I. <br><br>Will he ask her the same question again in Vol12?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OVA, maybe will bundled with LN final volume</br>  So who's really going to win? Hachiman clearly has a thing or both o them since he is possessive as fuck on Yui. <br><br>Also I never thought Hachman had it in him to be "possessive".</br></br>  <br> totsuka getting flustered over titties <br>BODY SNATCHER</br></br>  <br>Maybe one or two specific comments if Gamama asked about him but yeah, mostly body language, the way her tone and expression change when she brings him up, and the fact that he features so prominently in Yui's stories.<br><br>Whenever Yui mentions Hikki, she'll hear that added note of excitement in her voice. It's a tone that never appears even when she's gushing about how much fun she had sleeping over at Yukinon's place, but it's there even for the hum-drum days where they spend the entire afternoon sitting in the club room.<br><br>And of course there'll be the way her eyes light up. Even though he's not even in the room, Gamama's maternal intuition will tell her that bright-eyed smile is the same one Yui greets this boy with every day at school.<br><br>That's more than enough to tell Gamama that her baby girl is in love.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  8man, you know what to do. It isn't an acceptable answer, nor is it the appropriate answer but it is the right one.  <br>I dont think he's possessive of Yui per se; only girl who gets that treatment is Komachi</br>  <br><br>Everybody in the show has a fucking attitude problem.<br>Yui doesn't want anything to change, which is childish because it's going to change when they leave school.<br>Yukino is even less well adjusted than 8man. Like, shit, everything she does is what her sister did so she's just a mini-me except she's missing the ability to socialise.<br>8man was forced into a club he didn't want to be in and now everyone is paying the price. So in a way he's Rambo.<br>Haruno is trying to get Yukino to be herself, but she's doing it in the most fucked, passive aggressive way. Fuck, I just want to slap the shit out of her, she needs to check herself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Excluding Komachi of course. You think him being all "Hurr I hate nice girls" won't make him KIND OF possessive of Yui. I mean who the fuck tells a girl (that's not even your girlfriend) to not join a club/get a part time job just because you can't keep an eye on her?</br>  <br>Maybe not 12 but yes he will eventually; its obvious Hachiman will ask her something in the future, probably when he asks if they can be boy/girlfriend. Remember that Yukino said they can never be friends (and she never lies) but the bf/gf isnt out of the question.<br><br>It should be noted that he never tried doing anything remotely similar to Yui or Iroha nor has he felt "passion" or "heart beating faster" in a similar situation (asking a girl something). Yes im aware he has felt those emotions with the other girls but context is everything</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think he's being possessive as much as he's likely scared.<br>If Yui does things he doesn't know, can he says he knows her? Would his relationship with her be genuine if he doesn't understand her?<br>Furthermore, if there's other people she's with that he doesn't know, perhaps, she'll forget about him.<br><br>Though I'm not denying the romantic connotations, I think he also has, in a way, that childlike attachment Yukino has for Yui.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, he has feelings for both Yui and Yukino.<br>He clearly shows jealousy when guys hit on Yui, and he shows denial and disgust at the thought of her liking someone.</br></br>  <br>Thinking about Yui babbling about Hikki to her mom makes me get a huge heartboner.<br><br>It was funny how she just wanted to talk about Hikki-kun and Yukino was the afterthought. I wonder why Yui said this though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you really think 8man didn't possessive with Yui<br>Atleast Try to explain , and 8man jelly scene here <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125999356  .</br></br></br>  <br> ride is over <br>not yet captain</br></br>  <br>Oops<br><br>I mean here 8man scene<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/125998<wbr>270/#q125999356</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, he acts that way with Yui from time to time. Not sure how much it actually means <br><br>10.5 Ch 3 had similar trains of though from him<br><br> Yuigahama was red down to her neck as she stuttered. When she finished, she gave me a feverish look. Quite frankly, if we featured her on the cover, I’m sure a select group of people would rejoice, bu t I couldn’t really feel that way. I mean, look, the person in question clearly didn’t like it, see? <br> “I get you. I totally get you.” Yuigahama nodded, boldly expressing her agreement. Mmhm, girls nowadays… I can’t help but be worried that a bad adult or upperclassman will deceive them one day…(them being Yui/Iroha) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't 8man just convert to islam and marry both of them???<br>Allah is genuine.</br></br>  <br><br>I am legitimately hoping for threesome end. The penguin scene foretells it.</br></br>  Who has a clear copy of this? <br/>  Should I read the manga or the LN? <br><br> If LN where to find LN? I'm a retard, please spoonfeed me </br></br>  <br>Well, there's a huge chance that Yukino will win, because of First Girl syndrome and cliches that make the protag fall in love with her. But I really want Yui to win because she can be the nice girl that's different from what m8'man has seen, and I'm pretty sure she'd be dtf more than Yukino.</br>  <br>Its more like taking advantage of Yui and/or putting Yui into situations that might be less than ideal for her....<br>see<br><br>He doesnt do this with Yukinoshita because he believes he can handle herself. Though he does have this funny monologue<br><br>  Mmhmm, Discommunication-chan… I’m a little worried about you, too! <br><br>That foreshadows what's to come<br><br>Man, 10.5 as a whole was so lighthearted and cozy then shit hit the fan with 11.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and he shows denial and disgust at the thought of her liking someone. <br>This was towards Yukino.</br></br>  <br>I don't mean to throw gasoline to the fire and start a waifu shit flinging war,  no really I don't , but why would Saki react like that on this scene. Why'd they put it there? Is it written in the novel like that?<br><br>I like how you get so many reactions from just one little piece of dialogue that seems so unimportant.<br><br>Also the let's-think-it-together dude likes childhood-tan crush, I wonder if that's some side story for the club.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hmmm, so pic related is most probably what 8man will get in the long run if he goes with Yui.  <br>Because it would be embarrassing as hell and a tacit admission of how madly in love with him she is.<br><br>Even if it weren't for the three of them being in MAXIMUM AWKWARD mode at the time she'd probably have done the same, trying to rush her mom out before she started grilling him.<br><br><br>We can only pray, anon. The penguin scene is definitely my dark horse favorite though. I thought Gamama would be the biggest heartboner I got this week, but when I saw the sign I immediately made the connection in pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The problem is 8man himself actually know Yui able handle herself like in this scene did<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/125998<wbr>270/#q125999356<br><br>He just try to playing off his feeling of it.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Man, I'm no Yuifag, but are you really saying the tls  are just 8man taking care of Yui so that she isn't taken advantage of?<br><br>Come on, he's clearly being jealous in <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;125999356 .</br></br></br>  <br> With this much sweat on my hands, the hammer might accidentally fly out of my hand and crack that sports club guy in the back of the head. Ufufufu </br>  Meh, 8man gets jelly with Yui and Yukino (latter especially when it involves Hayama and their past)<br><br>Dont see why people are debating this</br></br>  <br>This<br>The only one he doesn't give a shit who she is with is Iroha.</br></br>  <br>Well for me I was just surprised how jelly 8man can get to the point where he doesn't want them to do certain things. Mind you I'm only just now catching up to the novels to see what the anime has fucked up</br>  Season 1-OP-English<br><br>I’m in this sunlit room,<br>waiting for all of it to melt.<br>Without realizing it, I’ve been looking from high above<br>with no one to have the same point of view as me.<br>Eventually my heart became white and opaque…<br>and the light falling into the snow dispersed.<br>Cold rain comes down from the clouds<br>and only the distant breeze of spring can clear it away.<br>Let the Azalea bloom<br>in a warm garden<br>and take me, lead me, to it…<br>or something.<br>This is not like a fairy tale with a happy ending,<br>I know that very well,<br>but even so,<br>I want to go there…<br>I was able to solve<br>a complicated equations without the help of anyone.<br>I thought it was natural to do it alone, <br>so I never doubted it…<br>But now, as the season is about to end, <br>the only one with me… is my own shadow.<br>The frozen pathway<br>is buried by the rain of flowers<br>so properly show me how<br>not to get lost.<br>There are no perfect crystals created by miracles,<br>that’s why we, one by one,<br>start to join hands.<br>The glass clinging to my heart melts and streaks down<br>into a world filled with light…<br>and soon…<br>That small room I kept safe<br>still has that empty space.<br>I never knew<br>that I was fine with it being just the two of us.<br>The day I waited for without realizing<br>has already melted away with the snow and soon spring will come.<br>It will become clear water<br>and then…<br>it will make the Azalea bloom.<br>But even after the long winter is over, <br>I’ll always, always, <br>be in this sunlit room.<br><br>I think this shows Yukino's development in the series.<br><br>It also tells that the spring will come from under the snow and will let the Azaleas bloom.<br><br>What do you think /a/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't see how anyone could think of Yukino as a possible love interest. She creeps me out with how dependent she is. What the fuck are you doing 8man?  <br>Saki's had a small crush on 8man since the cultural festival, when he casually shouted "love ya Kawasaki!" after she helped him find Sagami.<br><br>It's really, really hard to pick up on in the anime since tons of her scenes got cut back or removed, but she's given 8man some serious dere, and even suggested he come to the community center to play with her baby sister again sometime. I don't think anyone's bothered translating the reactions to that line from the LN yet, so we'll have to wait and see on that one. Maybe it was just a gimme to Sakifags for getting left on the cutting room floor, but who knows.<br><br>And I'd love to see a side-story where they have to hook up Tamanawa with Orimoto.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dat aspect ratio, is that the new Queen Bee H ova? Heh.</br>  <br>I think that Watari's making it up as he goes along, so S1 OP has no bearing.</br>  What is Volume a?<br>I see it is translated at Kyakka.</br>  <br>Isn't it kinda hypocritical that he gets jelly but causes all sorts of jelly from them? He has some nerve being possessive of them but not acknowledging they are both in love with him.</br>  <br>Well these particular scenes are from bd/side novels so the anime wouldnt adapt them. 6.5/10.5 didnt really get adopted (6.5 had that one sport festival but Im not sure how faithful it was)</br>  <br> Yukino never lies <br> Being this delusional </br></br>  <br> she never lies <br>8man hated himself for thinking that.<br>Yukino can lie just like everyone else.<br>Becoming his friend would be character development.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man Yuki Toki was good<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=eRx<wbr>Nbn1aRuk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, even with all of the blatant Yui bias with FEEL's adaption, I have to say some of Yui's scenes were just fucking great. Gives me hope that she has an actual chance at winning and Watari won't be going for a generic Yukino end.</br>  <br> 4:3 <br>W<br>H<br>Y</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he just care for them?<br>Would you be happy if your friends go out with some cunt like chad and that other loser dude?</br></br>  <br>That is one handsome man.</br>  <br>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=oregairu+ln</br>  <br> and she never lies <br>Nigga I'm not even a Yukinofag but that's just bullshit.</br></br>  <br><br><br>No she doesnt. 8man knows this and has accepted this fact. I dont see why people keep bringing it up<br><br>From Vol 10<br><br> Yukinoshita doesn’t lie. It’s just that she doesn’t say what’s true. There’re also times where she’d try to cover things up in an incoherent, roundabout way. I knew all of that. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am very depressed as a Yukinofag.<br>Watari is using her character just to create drama and to keep the story going.<br>I don't know what to say when people say that she isn't suffering.<br>First they tell that she is Mary Sue and when her problems surface, then they say that she is full of problems.<br>Why is Watari ruining her character like that?<br>Will there be any positive development in next volumes?<br>I'm pretty sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isn't it kinda hypocritical that he gets jelly but causes all sorts of jelly from them? He has some nerve being possessive of them but not acknowledging they are both in love with him. <br>Yep, I think this is stupid as well. Yeah yeah he got rejected in middle school, but that is no reason for him to consciously ignore the obvious feelings of the two girls.<br><br>Or maybe he just doesn't want to choose so they can retain that atmosphere? I don't know</br></br></br></br>  <br> Will there be any positive development in next volumes? <br>For you, yes. She'll do a complete 180, run 10 miles and win the 8bowl in just one volume.</br></br>  <br>Well she's going to win the 8bowl in the end so....</br>  <br> She doesn't lie <br> But she's intentionally misleading and obscures important information <br><br>Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Divinity!</br>  <br>Lying through omission is still lying.</br>  <br><br>Well, with 6.5 he's been so busy trying to play off his feelings I think he'd barely realize what he's doing. As for 10.5 and the Interlude, yes it is a bit hypocritical but a) he probably doesn't realize they are getting jealous of how he interacts with Iroha and b) even if he is aware of his own feelings he probably doesn't know what to do with them.</br></br>  <br><br>At what point do you think she realized 8man was the boy her driver ran over, and then decided not to ever mention it to him?</br></br>  <br>Lying is saying something that is blatantly false. Not telling the whole truth is an entirely different thing<br>Anyways, 8man has no qualms with what Yukinoshita did in Vol 6 and he is over that incident</br></br>  <br> Would you be happy if your friends go out with some cunt like chad and that other loser dude? <br>You got a point</br></br>  Remember<br><br> Yukino: Good Luck &gt; Small Luck <br> Yui: Excellent Luck &gt; Bad Luck &gt; Small Luck <br> 8man: Small Luck <br><br> Yukino tied her good luck slip with Yui's bad luck slip so it even out and both got small luck. <br><br>The prophecy will come true,<br>Yukino will become a bro and help Yui at the end by prompting 8man to chase after Yui,<br>the scenario will go something like this  .<br><br>This is the only way to redeem Yukino's character without an asspull timeskip.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> (and she never lies)  <br>She does, and 8man tells her it's fine to lie, but she at least tells him why she rejected him this time.</br></br>  <br><br>Same guy here.<br>I don't know. Anything could happen. Iroha and Yui are good characters too.<br>If anything, Watari could hook him up with some other character.<br>You never know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yukino going minori <br> genuine <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>He has no more future qualms over it. He doesnt bring it up anymore I should add,, Yes, he had issues with the whole lying thing but its not a big deal anymore when it comes to Yukinoshita</br>  <br>First time she saw him, she acted like she didn't know him, even if she obviously did.</br>  <br>I guess it's not lying... but more deception. Yukino likes deceiving others.</br>  <br>The moment she saw him</br>  <br>Hikigaya's refusal blew the fuck out of that ending</br>  <br>The only lie Yukino has told is saying she didn't recognize Hachiman.</br>  <br>thats the truth, and also pic related. Also Yuimom was the miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>Anon she's at her weakest point right now. She's more vulnerable than ever before, both within the story and without. From here she can only go up.<br><br>Watari has been building up to a character development arc for over half of the series. Her character development is essentially the end of the story, so you can be damn sure Watari is going to do everything in his power to make it satisfying.<br><br>At this point, especially ending on a cliffhanger, Watari wants you to believe that anything could happen, but anyone who knows how storys are made knows how things are going to progress, at least in a general sense. So stop letting fear cloud your judgement and look past what legions of people on 4chan tell you and simply judge for yourself what you think is going to happen based on everything you know, not just select parts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> meanwhile you're completely ignoring the significance of the fact that 8man has dropped that behavior pattern when he's thinking about the other two girls. <br>Not only have you failed to support your statement, you haven't even stated how it's supposed to indicate romance for the other girls.<br><br>My statement that the chocolate is the closest he's come to expressing, let alone admitting, romantic feelings for any girl still stands as well. To claim anyone else has a lead when that's the case is laughable.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>So with the fact that her car hit 8man, she still had the audacity to shit on him?</br></br></br>  Could this be a possible ending?<br> Hachiman himself thought that he will never have Yukino as his girlfriend. <br> In the end, she might become his girlfriend. <br><br>My Teen Romantic comedy Is Wrong as I Expected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was her final development anon.<br><br>She is only one of three that never did any self-sacrifice for both of them.</br></br></br>  <br>i am at season 2 episode 5 now and i am literally thinking that all of them have downsyndrome. they are so fucking weird. but than, the whole anime is weird. i dont understand anything from it yet i still watch it cause YUI *-*</br>  <br> Yukino's final arc revolves around learning to become independent from 8man <br><br>Not happening.</br></br></br>  <br>also what i forgot what the fucks wrong with these yaharro greetings? cant they say hello like every other human being?</br>  <br><br>The anime adaptation went nowhere. It's basically a gallery of scenes for the LN readers to enjoy. <br><br>You might as well read it if you are still interested.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, because "muh driver". I don't know you, but if I'd run over someone I'd go check on him, or at least ask if he's ok. And I'll surely remember his fucking face.</br>  <br>I stopped watching this show because character development has largely stagnated to cliches and desperate attempts to create "tender" scenes if you can even call them that. Since the show in general was so dry to begin with it wasn't very fun to watch successive episodes without becoming disinterested. Hachiman regularly cockblocks himself with his over-analysis of every single facet and how he can become more separated and hipsterish thinking he's morally superior and any such trifles are beneath him in terms of social interaction that its really really difficult to keep watching in the first place. Regular dialogue montages contribute to the boring factor and I'm fully confident that the writers do it purely to add filler to the show because they had one or two spurts of a good idea. Although there does seem to be some sort of development again its left to cliches and supposedly "genuine feelings" but its almost like they forget its happening the next day. Characters don't interact smoothly or naturally and its left to Yui being a dumb girl, Yuki being an equally overanalyzing prick, Hachiman wanting nothing to do with it but he keeps coming back for more, and the pose of characters that is hayama and the band who are merely side characters with no importance. I'm actually so confident with the lack of importance in hayama and those people that if you removed them completely and left them purely to one-liner episodes there'd be no difference in the outcome of before and after. Any contributions they make later are purely filler as such. Hachiman wants to be blunt and he is for the most part but lacks any direct support from himself and thus his actions and words feel hollow because theres nothing to really say than "hes blunt". It really devalues character design when all your characters are so drab that it could be a close contender for Naruto of being the most underwhelming in terms of character content.</br>  <br>Yeah. Never in my whole life have I heard of people having this many problems.</br>  <br>So now that I'm comparing the show to Naruto, lets get all the "memes" I was referring to earlier out of the way. The "I want something genuine" only reinforces how bland his fucking character is and this outstep isn't some hidden feelings hes been withholding but rather and purely an out of character dialogue that is largely forgotten about because its in the name of the shitty club. Yui will never have anything more to herself because of this and shes so "fallen in love with the club" and in fact all the characters have some sort of meaningless tie to the fucking club like it means something when it doesn't. Since the club has no meaning then all this "genuine" shit is genuine garbage and is just shallow baiting for anything. So in turn, watching this show is like watching an American football game where I really don't want to sit through this ENTIRE thing, I'll log on, watch the game's top plays and highlights and then go about my day. Thats largely what this show is, boring boring boring something boring boring boring, and I log onto /a/ to watch these threads for the "highlights of the day" shit with some significant "event" if you can call it that happening.<br><br>Likewise the story is developing slow and its almost a shitty slice of life sitcom at this point except its not remotely "a slice of life" and its not a comedy by any default. The romanticism is non-existent as well purely because the main character literally cockblocks himself and hes so autistic he can't take a hint nor will he extend himself to get what he wants. Oh but somehow Hachiman is placated to completely OVER extend into "HURR I WANT SUMTHIN GENUINE TOO~". Nothing has actually changed and no recourse for this action has any merit and so long story short this fucking meme that was spawned of itself in itself is literally trash writing in action.<br><br>TL:DR This anime is shit, kill yourselfs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>New pasta?<br><br>Great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where were you?<br>Why weren't you on the weekly Iroha thread?<br>Mods killed it.</br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> audacity <br>nah shes simply autistic. she didnt mean nothing by it.</br></br>  When do you think Yukino became conscious of Hachiman?  <br> I want something genuine <br>I thought that was the gayest thing ever</br></br>  <br><br> Expecting anything more than melodramatic teenage harem shenanigans  <br><br>I do agree that the show is taking itself way to serious during season 2.

It was noted it was in Tsukihime, it was noted its in Kara, maybe even Fate, despite how it being mentioned the events/characters in Kara and Tsukihime are incompatible for reasons. Yet a certain priest and vampire are sometimes seen there.<br><br>Its a cafe of meetings that exists in all universes, its always the same place, people from any world line can enter and briefly meet people from other worlds without ever realizing that these people are from somewhere else.<br><br>So its inspired two different manga so far about this place, and one anime. A place that allows all TM stories to converge briefly. Maybe Zelretch is partially responsible for this existence of course, but of course its never taken that seriously.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino boat. <br><br>Shirou also works part time as Luvia's maid.</br></br></br>  <br>An entire episode of epilogue, what the hell are they going to do?<br><br>Oh, I see</br></br></br>  <br>No, that was Servant Archer. He just survived... somehow</br>  <br> best girl <br> getting a route <br>New to TM?</br></br></br>  <br> In addition, even if Emiya’s spiritual core sustained lethal damage, he can still survive for a short period. This ability is the reason why Emiya is able to secretly observe Shirou and gang’s battle as a spiritual body after being defeated by Shirou. In addition, after the battle between Shirou and Gilgamesh had concluded at Ryudo Temple, Emiya appeared in front of Gilgamesh as he attempted to pull Shirou into the darkness. He shot an arrow between the eyes of Gilgamesh and sent him alone into the darkness. The arrow shot at that time was a regular arrow, and from the fact that Emiya gradually began to disappear after this attack, this is probably the limit of Emiya’s materialisation. <br><br>Dunno why people think he was a CG there, a CG can only act after everyone has been killed basically. He just survived due to IA, and he was at the absolute limit of his mana at the end which is why he looked so fucked.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All Around Type Moon</br></br>  <br>Oh, yes, thanks.</br>  <br>Wait, what the fuck is this?

She obviously knows they're shacking up yet flirts brazenly. Who does that?  <br>When did Rin become Karin from Monogatari?</br>  <br>A trollop, that's who.</br>  <br>Whores</br>  <br>There's an interview where Nasu says that Shirou's chances in all routes is infinitely close to zero. Anything else was just fanwank.</br>  <br> Who does that? <br>THE MOTHERFUCKING EDELFETS.</br></br>  <br>The Throne being outside of time doesn't actually mean changes to the hero would be done immediately. This is hinted at by the fact Archer isn't aware of every single one of his summons despite the information already existing there.</br>  <br>She's a slut</br>  <br>finns</br>  <br>I was in the thread on some Japanese forum, wasn't even watching the episode, refreshed the page, and Luvia was there with a bunch of freaking out. Blew my mind that we were actually getting London right there and then. Shame HF can't do something to top that scene for an epilogue.</br>  <br>It does confirm that he won't ever remember his summonings, as the answer is already written.<br><br>All of his summonings have happened, he compares it to a library full of books he has the choice of reading or not. The result is that even if the answer is there, he will not read it, since 99.999 percent of all books in the library are just him being summoned and killing everything which he gets tired of reading.<br><br>Its Archived Time, not Observed Time, time cannot move forward in a 1, 2, 3 type manner since all things are on the same scale. It's like a book, the end and beginning are on the same scale in terms of time per the reader.<br><br>If the Throne has not already replaced Archer, then it never did, since the end and beginning are on the same scale. Time cannot move forward or backwards, its the same from the start, everything has already been reached.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder to everyone that Archer FALSE FLAGGED Nero and was the actual person responsible for burning down Rome.<br><br>Nero's fantasies were becoming too dangerous and overwriting reality that Archer was sent to burn down Rome and have the blame put on Nero.</br></br></br>  <br> Rome is burning before Acha appears <br>You can't trick me, Whore of Babylon.</br></br>  <br>Aniplex fucked up with the subs but Shirou works part time as Luvia's maid.<br><br>Also, Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino riverboat owned by a DAA.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer?</br>  <br> Only summoned to prevent apocalypse-level events <br> Kills a bunch of ragheads with AKs <br><br>What</br></br></br></br>  <br>How could Archer do such a thing.

Yet Archer in Extra is aware of the events that occur in F/SN despite his "younger" self being hopelessly unaware. Only confirmed difference is that Mooncell Archer is not bound to the Counterforce which is why he's less of a jackass.</br>  <br>cuckold brittistani?</br>  <br>Neither of those things make it okay to hit on someone else's boyfriend, much less in front of them. I'll have to agree that it's because of  slut </br>  <br>Mooncell updates heroic spirits info based on shit that's happened on Earth.<br><br>The fifth war happened on Earth, it was recorded, info was updated on Archer. You're arguing that all servants retain information based on previous summonings, which is wrong.<br><br>Cu also remembered Archer from the fifth war in Extra, he's not a guardian.</br></br></br></br></br>  Luvia's anus is probably blander than Rin's.  <br>what would yous search for in the archive for the live threads in the subject line or post?</br>  <br>Luvia probably bleaches her anus. Rin probably has hair on hers.</br>  <br>Nope. <br> Yes, that's right. To be more precise, they are perfectly reproduced from the Moon Cell's records of human history. However, that human history is connected to the throne of heroes in multiple ways, so they can't be called copies as a rule. In short, the Moon Cell consciously creates its own history of humanity, but that history is the exact same as the throne of heroes, so it's like they overlap in multiple ways as the same existences. <br>Mooncell copies = Throne copies.</br></br></br>  http://www.fate-sn.com/bdbox/<br><br>Drama CD for the BDs is gonna be about the Clock Tower.<br><br>Also it seems like they're setting things straight somewhat with the amount of extra animation. They're pinning it at a little over 10 minutes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look for the thread with 900+ posts.</br>  <br>Just so you know Archer always talks about himself in 3rd person before he became guardian.</br>  <br>My hair is naturally curly to the point it forms drills, its possible anon, if your genes allow it.</br>  <br> bleached anus <br> spending obscene amounts of money to look like a whore  <br>Sasuga Luvia.</br></br></br>  <br> Supposed to be summoned as part of the CG to stop humanity ending catastrophes <br> Always summoned to kill random sand niggers, small-time militias, and children who couldn't possibly do anything big <br><br>Bravo ufotable, Bravo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's just Aniplex fucking up. They made the same mistake in episode 20 and UTW had to fix it.</br>  <br>you never know man, butterfly effect and so</br>  <br> Rin probably has hair on hers <br>That's a good thing. The hair traps the feces, dirtying her anus to the point where you can taste Shirou's cooking in it.</br></br>  <br>I just find it hard to believe, is all. Was hoping he'd deal with more interesting disasters like the manga portrayed (participating in wars and large scale conflicts) instead of killing sand niggers for a living.</br>  <br>never read the manga, who does he kill in that, mecha hitler?</br>  <br/>  Why is Rin so jealous Luvia? She has tons of things that Luvia doesnt have like her uh ZR yeah that works that's something Luvia definitely doesnt have.  Hopefully, this episode will inspire someone to finally write the Rin/Luvia hatesex doujin everyone wants.  <br>No idea. But we see some flashbacks of him in the middle of a warzone screaming like a madman with dead bodies all around him.</br>  <br>I dont know what are you talking about. Archer clearly says shounen wa shounen ga.<br>Translation is correct. He talks about ubw Emiya and himself when he was alive at the same time. And he got his answer.</br></br>  <br>Luvia is rich as fuck, has a body that makes Rin realize she was always just a big fish in a small pond who was less than she realized, has as much ability as Rin but even more going on outside of that.<br><br>She's someone that makes even school idol Rin feel a little self conscious.<br><br>Although you might say the same about Saber.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luvia has money. Rin doesn't.</br>  <br>And she has a route</br>  I just cant believe we got a satisfactory pretty good end with some fan service.  Luvia is Blue<br>a Red's natural rival</br>  <br>do you have big tits and childbearing hips too?</br>  <br> And she gets plowed by dirty ginger and is impure, while Luvia is always pure and prime <br><br>Wow, real accomplishment</br></br></br>  <br>She's not jealous? She's just annoyed Luvia keeps trying to make moves on her sentient sword.</br>  <br>The Counter Force acts through subtle means usually by empowering and leading a living person to neutralize the thread. Counter Guardians are only send when the situation is already beyond fucked and they will literally kill anything in the vicinity.<br><br>Maybe they send more than one guardian and Archer just got stuck with cleaning out the place?</br></br></br>  <br>Even in the routes where Luvia never meets Shirou, Rin still gets jealous and goes after her just the same.<br><br>Saying Shirou is the core of this problem is stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Luvia constantly lusts after the Shero dick, but she'll never get it, not even in Prisma.</br>  <br>There's probably more than one CG, yeah.<br><br>Still kind of weird how all we saw were Archer dealing with small-fry. I'd be pretty bored even if I was looking forward to all the killing.</br></br></br>  <br>Luvia's not even good enough for the ginger, she tries to get his attention but can't even do that</br>  Ara  <br>It's a multiverse.<br><br>There's guaranteed to be an infinite number of possibilities where Luvia wins  or NTRs Rin .</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about that particular scene with Rin clearly trying to get Luvia the fuck off Shirou.</br>  <br>She'll always be pure and noble, while Rin is gaping and dirty anus. An unreachable but always pure Aristocrat, while Rin is a gorilla that can be talked into sex in less than two weeks.<br><br>As said before, Luvia never meets Shirou in Fate or HF, so its definitely not constantly anything. <br><br> He denied "putting others before himself", however that was obviously self-deception. His goal was to be a house-husband. <br> However, his butler-spirit had already awakened. After the True End of Rin route, he was working part-time at the mansion of Rin's rival. What the heck is this? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Saber is also blue.<br><br>The natural conclusion is for blue three-way to occur as red is left out in the cold.</br></br></br></br>  Did Shirou ever realise avalon is inside him?  <br>Infinite universes don't mean everything can happen<br><br>Kotomine will never survive past the 5th war<br>Luvia will never win shirou</br></br></br></br>  <br>Going off that mindset there's also an infinite number of possibilities where Rin has Luvia watch her in the middle of baby-making, or more importantly,  they turn full-on bi and have the Clocktower's wildest threesome .</br>  <br>In Fate he does</br>  <br>Luvia saw Shirou try to jump just like Rin and Sakura. and we all know bitches love the jump</br>  <br>Rin shouldn't talk with cock in her mouth</br>  <br>He might have, but it doesn't really matter in UBW or HF.</br>  <br>People seem to not get despite it being said by Nasu a few times, at their core Sakura and Rin are almost entirely the same. Main difference is one is unlucky and the other is lucky.<br><br> Basically, she is a worrisome girl that never resents others (not even Shinji or Zouken), and always blames herself for everything. <br> The solitary exception to this rule is Rin, because the two of them are so similar. I guess she's only capable of being honest with herself, or someone almost exactly like herself, yeah. <br> As everybody knows, she seems passive, but when she does do something she devotes herself to it completely. <br><br>Rin and Sakura are entirely in sync when they try to kick Bazett out of the house in Ataraxia when they perceive her as a threat.<br><br>They're both the jealous type underneath it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, I only have my drills.</br>  <br> Infinite universes don't mean everything can happen <br>Is that you, Ken Levine?</br></br>  <br>wot</br>  <br>Wrong, Aniplex fucked up the script once again. Actually, you can find more mistakes in the script of ep25.</br>  <br>Where do you come from anon?</br>  <br>The head guy of Bioshock Infinite. He got butthurt over all the incest porn</br>  <br> Twin-tail tsundere with excellent ZR Kana Ueda or busty beautiful Ojou-sama Shizuka Itou <br><br>Talk about a hard decision.</br></br></br>  <br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Now imagine if Sakura was adopted by Luvia's family<br><br> Sakura with Drills <br>Never knew I wanted this.</br></br></br>  <br> there will never be an anime of Rin and Luvia traveling the world doing magic things, basically being Lina and Naga </br>  <br>LONDON<br>OO<br>N N<br>D D<br>O O<br>N N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oondon?</br>  <br>I kinda want another Fate story where Sakura goes to the Edelfeldts, but it would probably be written by Urobutcher.<br><br>The story would end up "See how terrible everything has gotten, looks like rape worms was the best end for Sakura and the world"</br></br></br>    <br>Ken Levine should have had Shirou sit him down and explain the ethical implications of time travel to him and how it's not going to undo personal suffering in any meaningful way and thus has no value as a tool for moral intervention <br><br>I imagine the ending to his games would have been marginally less ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>HF epilogue will have Touko in it though<br><br>And if ufotable wanted to they could put a certain old man in there too.</br></br></br>  <br>it... it was supposed to be diagonal<br><br>I can't triforce</br></br></br>  <br>I was debating leaving Cu figures everywhere when I was in Ireland</br>    <br>That's pretty much Prisma Illya. Replace Luvia pampering Miyu with Sakura.</br>  <br>SEEEIIIBAAAAA</br>  Best seibah  <br>Oh right I forgot about them. Both would be great cameo appearances.</br>  <br>seibaaa</br>  <br>It's a memorial. King Arthur isn't actually buried there. <br><br>And why would she be buried? She's just sleeping till Britain needs her again</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Ufotable can't be stopped! I'm surprised we didn't see Mitzusuri's younger brother though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>My fellow citizen!</br>  <br> Wrestling <br> Rin just punches </br></br>  Ohohoho-hekhhh  Have Luvia put on 30 pounds, start drinking, and spout nothing but memes, and I'll believe she's actually Finnish.  <br><br>But I hate counting. Numbers killed my wife.</br></br>  <br>As a highly-trained numberologist, this triggers me.</br>  <br>As a doujin enthusiast, you too should go get a room and have angry hate sex right now.</br>  <br><br> there are people on this thread <br> right now <br> who like numbers </br></br></br></br>  Soon.  <br> consider it <br>They can't. There are four (4) steps to follow in that order.</br></br>    <br><br>were did you find this?</br></br>   tfw 13 Fate threads right now in the catalog <br>Bravo ufotable</br>  <br>The flashback was only the end of their second year. Mitsuzuri's brother had not even entered the school yet.</br>  <br>If you read this in shirou point of view, it makes more sense.</br>  I can't wait for Prisma 2.5 for more Rin-Luvia shinenigans. Especially the beach birthday party where Shirou gets injected with truth serum.  So does today's episode mean we might actually get a decent epilogue that flows well in HF, showing everyone recovering from all the bullshit they went through instead of just HEY LOOK IT'S BEEN TWO YEARS EVERYONE'S BETTER NOW?  read that as<br> truth semen <br>new hentai trope incoming!</br></br>  <br>[HOPE INTENSIFIES]</br>  <br>UBw could afford to expand the epilogue since it had almost 30 half hours. HF might not be that lucky.<br><br>Hell, they could have rationalized the UBW Clock Tower stuff could work to fill in for cutting it in HF.</br></br></br>  <br> injecting a guy with truth semen <br>That's gay, anon</br></br>  <br>No, it's time constraint.</br>  <br>Why is Ciel ther-<br>Oh right, she gave Archer the shroud.</br></br>  <br> tfw Issei gets NTR'd by that vicious vixen <br>RIP bromolust route</br></br>  Why does she call him Sherou and not Shirou?  <br>Shitty Finnish accent except she speaks Japanese perfectly, blame Nasu.</br>  <br>Why are you gay?</br>  <br>Because she's a shit</br>   That ending after the credits <br>We know Nasu. Shirou goes into the desert to get a tan. It wasn't because he saved a bunch of orphans from a nuclear power plant or that he used magic to darken his skin.</br>    So does this mean I can watch CarnivalP hantasm  now?  <br>Ken Levine wrote a really shitty story for Bioshock Infinite. <br><br>One of the biggest criticisms was that despite having a time travel mechanic with parallel universes, the interpretation of parallel worlds was shitty. In his version, although there are tons of different universes out there, all of them flow through two 'points', meaning that certain events can never change.<br><br>Basically, not a true definition of infinite branches, despite what the title would lead you to believe.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura getting any closure </br>  So do any buyfags know if ufotable are going to be selling stuff at the next comiket?  <br>She did get closure<br><br>But then it turns out that there's like eighty percent more character to her story than we had any idea about at the end of UBW, that we only learned about in the next route.<br><br>As far as people thought when they finished UBW it was like "Well Shinji has calmed down after going wild due to grail madness, and is back to what he used to be, happy end".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it's true that "infinite" != "absolutely everything imaginable". The example given for Fate is Kotomine never surviving the grail war. By the same token, it's not accurate to say that there must be infinite universes where such-and-such person wins the Shiroubowl.</br>    Shinji got PTSD from being literally raped by Iri inside the Grail<br><br>Later, when he's recuperating, suddenly Sakura shows up and begins force-feeding him apples to make him get better. Sakura is getting hungry, too, since Shinji is the only one who takes care of her good and hard, just the way she likes it.</br></br>  <br>Best fight scene in the show</br>  <br>What if Shinji can't take her good and hard anymore?<br>Senpai isn't around too.</br></br>  <br> all those earth-shattering impacts <br> that toughness <br>Are mages able to reinforce and boost their physical abilities to that extent?</br></br></br>  So Shinji wins the Sakurabowl in UBW, right?  So who was the guy that walked past Shirou? I don't think I recognized him.<br>And no I'm not talking about Waver.</br>  <br>Twice Pieceman.</br>  <br><br>Yes. See: Souichirou-sama being buffed by Caster to the point where he could keep up with a Heroic Spirit. Executioners like Ciel and Kotomine and muscle wizards like Bazett also reinforce themselves.<br><br>It's goddamn disgraceful to cast buffs on yourself and fight a wizard's duel by physically beating the shit out of each other by Magus dueling standards, of course, but Luvia and Rin don't give a shit about what kind of duels crusty old magi like Caster believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to the level of servants, but they are able to reinforce that much at least if they're very good at strengthening.<br><br>Servants typically move in the low mach speeds, being ten to a hundred times stronger than humans, with ten times being very low in servant terms.</br></br></br>  Both of them are jealous of Flat's cuteness.  <br>That's stupid. A miracle can exist. It MUST.</br>  <br>Well the likes of Tokiomi and Fast wheels expected a magic pissing contest.<br><br>Fast wheels got the worst blunt. I can't imagine his face if someone decided to go fisticuffs on him.</br></br></br>  <br>Drown in your dreams and die</br>  Haven't watched episode yet but did we get mercury meido?  <br> 80% <br>kek</br></br>  <br>Nope, sorry. Just Waver himself</br>  <br>Who?</br>  Why is purple Worm Girl so nice to Purple not Worm boy who raped her many times?  It would've confused the shit out of people to see Waiver walk by with Saber.  <br>No, he's just back to being an okay enough brother.<br><br>He's not marrying her, his sperm isn't magus anything that she actually needed, Zouken just convinced Shinji to start raping her to break her down mentally more one day as another type of torture, despite her functioning nearly nine years without that sort of thing so the idea "But she needs it" isn't quite right, and Zouken would kill the failure offspring himself rather than see her give birth to a double failure after what happened last time.<br><br> The gutsiest, most rebellious person in the history of the Matou family – against that monstrous old man, just standing up to him and running away was a heroic act of valor. Of course, from Zouken's point of view, no matter how much better Kariya's magic circuits were than his older brother's, they weren't worth the effort it would take to break his will and train him into a proper family head. In fact, at that point he had probably already decided that he had no choice but to bet everything on Byakuya conceiving an heir that would turn everything around. Unfortunately, in the end his longshot gamble backfired spectacularly, and instead of a miracle that would save his lineage, he got Shinji.  <br><br>Zouken brought her into the family to be a breeding machine to restart the bloodline, Shinji raping her isn't to get an offspring, it was just to break her as a hobby, he wouldn't allow something like that after he was fucked over last time a non magus had sex with a magus and gave him Shinji of the no potential. So they're not actually getting together or anything.<br><br>It's at the level where he abused or raped her a few times, but she still remembers him being a decent brother at one point, so she held out hope he could be a good guy again. At the end of UBW he's back to being a decent enough brother as far as we know.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WAIT THAT WAS WAVER?<br>WAVER IS THE GUY WHO TALKS FOR THE MASTER IN PRISMA?<br><br>Wondered what happened to Waver.</br></br></br></br>    <br>If you watched Fate/Zero,  you useless secondary  then the mercury mystic code of El Melloi is inherited by Waver. Waver proceeds to turn it into a Maid who does things for him in the Clocktower and has T-1000 tendencies.</br>  <br>Official reason, she's far too forgiving and tends to blame herself, and can only be honest with someone and let her complaints go if she's dealing with someone far too similar to herself.<br><br>She blamed herself for Shinji going insane, since she stole his birthright basically. She's always weak with the worms sapping her strength, so she can't really fight back against him physically anyway, and she pities him rather than hating him, which only aggravates him more. It wasn't by choice she took on the position as heir, but she still takes responsibility.<br><br>Only against Rin could she finally be honest and say she kind of has a lot to complain about and is upset by all of this, when she was sort of bottling it up for ten years prior. She's a person who has trouble being honest basically.</br></br></br></br></br>  lewd  <br> datacap <br> using an extension which automatically expands images <br><br>People like you are the reason God invented cancer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there any more of Waver and his waifu?</br>  <br>Yeah mean read because as far as I know the maid didn't appear anywhere in the anime.<br>Also fuck your shit I've read Fate/Stay Night and Hollow Ataraxia.</br></br>  No one has the cap of Luvia like this <br>?</br>  <br>Rin, Sakura, and Luvia; they had some sort of mask they wear in public, and can only show their real face when they meet someone far too similar and end up letting it all out. Can't show their real selves unless specific conditions are met.<br><br>The far too perfect sort of "honors student perfect beauty" mask, but then you get past the mask and see the real truth. They are related, they might wear different masks but they seem to have this in common.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you're not a secondary and I have no complaints about you.<br><br><br>You mean the loli bitch? Try Clocktower adventures. Shit I can't remember the name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've got the picture anon just needed to know what to look for.</br>  <br><br><br>Sorry but magi can actually strengthen themselves to the level of Servants.<br><br>Lorelei does it all the time and she easily keeps up with DAAs and even waits to fight them at the best when the red moon is in the sky.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lorelei <br>Literally who?</br></br>  <br>Same rank as Zelretch in the Clock Tower and both are 2nd in rank to the head of Clock Tower.</br>  <br>Someone should remake this and fit Ufo shits in there somewhere.</br>  <br>God bless /a/'s autism.<br><br>And clearly we need more blessing and autism because I'm not seeing my thingo there. <br><br>Lord El Melli II Case files is what I wanted.<br><br><br>Bitch in charge of the Clocktower. Nominally anyway. Crazy strong, fights DAAs. No noted special abilities, just pure strength apparently. Would have appeared in Tsukihime 2 but well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then she's not exactly a good metric for the strength of most mages, is she</br>  <br> Lord El Melli II Case files <br> comiket 87 <br><br>That's some dank shit right there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So after Hollow Ataraxia there's nothing Fate/related left beside untranslated LNs and PSP games?<br>Fucking great.</br></br>  Could Shiro beat Luvia in a fight at the end of UBW? <br><br>It's not like she's a 9/10ths dead Servant or the King of Jobbers facing his natural hard counter.</br></br>   tfw there will never be a slice of life magical university anime about the 6 months Rin/Shirou spent there   <br>She also has an army from Clock Tower and all of them are capable of taking down a DAA.</br>  <br><br>How can anyone take this seriously</br></br>  <br>The fight would turn into her trying to fuck him almost instantly.</br>  <br>Shhh. Don't give them any more ideas. We really need a tsukihime remake.</br>  <br>Could she beat Primate Murder?</br>  <br>But can she beat Shiki</br>  <br>I don't think Shirou can really beat Rin so by extension he couldn't really beat Luvia.<br><br><br>Leave out the top ten DAA, that's not fair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Luvia is just Rin with bigger tits and Shirou doesn't shit swords in combat, Luvia wins.<br><br>The question is would Luvia still want the Shero as husbando or lab project if she saw his traced NPs or UBW</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't really have anything to guard against swords spam does she?</br>  <br>She got mad at Shiki for kill stealing her prey.<br><br>So Shiki is a faster killer than her which is why she gets mad.<br><br>Shiki likely beats her in speed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all of them are capable of taking down a DAA <br>Without her, they would get slaughtered by any of the current DAA except for that one scrub that Shiki soloed (not SHIKI)</br></br>   a mere human being able to fight Altrouge Dumbledore's pet, Primate Murder, which gained the name because it is designed for one and only one purpose   <br>Several counter guardians can only restrain not defeat Primate Murder just because Primate Murder wants to take a walk in the nearby continent.</br>  <br>From Tsukihime 2, Lorelei and a small army spend a couple of days prepping to take down a DAA. Satsujinki waltzes in like it ain't no thing, kills the DAA and his entourage and leaves the same night</br>  <br>Her army are all her personal soldiers that she converted into ultimate tools. They were all made to be the perfect killers.</br>  <br>Just because he arrived there earlier does not mean he is faster or stronger than her<br><br>Shiki would probably burn out before being able to reach Lorelei. She's literally HugeMagicSpam: The Mage.</br></br></br>  What the hell is this shit<br>I haven't watched the series yet, I only played the VN<br><br>Who the fuck is Luvia? <br>When the hell did any of this happen?</br></br></br></br>  How many times do you think Shirou creampies her daily? Why is her route the only pairing that makes my blood boil? I can't help but feel like it's straight NTR if it's not Saber or Sakura, despite me hating Sakura.  <br>Do you remember the Good end of Heaven's Feel when Rin got back to Fuyuki and was complaining about some bitch in the clock tower? That's Luvia.</br>  <br>Have you finished HF? If you did you would know who Luvia is.</br>  <br> ultimate tools <br>Kek, that's a fancy way to describe slightly superior enforcers that would probably get rekt by Bazett 1v1<br><br> Perfect killers <br> implying a perfect human killer can even lick the boots of the DAA </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She even had a speaking role for fuck's sake.</br>  <br> Implying a mangy mutt like Bazett wouldn't get wrecked. </br>  <br>shiki did it</br>  <br> DAA capable of EX rank spells <br> scrub <br>or are you talking about the other DAA?</br></br></br>  <br>Shiki is way stronger than any of her enforcers, he fucking wrecked another DAA when Arceuid was restrained (although she did help)</br>  <br><br>It's been years but I don't ever remember her showing up. Was she just mentioned?</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about Louvre</br>  <br>Not exactly a good showing that DAA was a actually a scrub though since he was only assassinated by Shiki, you know who else got done in by him like this?</br>  <br>Just a mention. See <br><br>Also, read F/HA already.</br></br></br>  <br>Forgot picture, yeah I cleared the whole thing</br>  <br>Even in F/HA she only appeared in one single scene.<br>Luvia is forever irrelevant.</br></br>  I'm about to watch Attack on Titan on Toonami for the first time<br><br>What should I expect?</br></br>  Shit.  A whole lot of shit.  A show called Attack on Titan  CRAWLING IN MY SKIN  <br>THESE WOUNDS THEY WILL NOT HEAL</br>  <br>bernie is the colossus titan<br>eren is a titan<br>the walls are titans<br>the square head guy is the iron titan man</br></br></br></br>  Big guys  Toonami belongs on /co/.  <br>A really bad dub<br>Unlike these</br></br>  <br>Let's pad so the plot won't move an inch : the show.</br>  I've never watched anime before too<br><br>Is it like a TV show?</br></br>  Garbage  <br>its honestly pretty good but hardcore fans of anything will say that anything that gains mainstream popularity is garbage</br>  <br>Crashing the walls with no survivors.</br>  <br>Yeah its like a shitty TV show</br>    <br>That's a fair enough reason since the majority of mainstream crap is crap. If you can't see it in anime, take a look at other popular stuff. <br><br>Attack on Titan is mediocre. Can't say the same for the manga since I haven't read it yet.</br></br></br>  Death. Lots of it  <br> Toonami <br>Americans will defend this.</br></br>  <br>Not really though this one probably look more like a TV show than most others. Also don't watch anime if you want TV shows, just watch TV shows.</br>  <br> Death. Lots of it <br>I even like AoT and I call bullshit on this. People keep saying that there's death left and right, but there's only an occasional death, and usually someone whose name was only mentioned once or twice, or never really had time to develop greatly to give a damn that they died. <br><br>I mean fuck, when is Isayama going to kill off someone who matters, like Erwin, Levi, Hange or Jean?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Redshirts don't count.</br>  <br>Fujoshi would kill Isayama is he killed Erwin, Levi or Jean.</br>  <br>Mainstream doesn't always equal to crap.<br><br>But I guess going all "I see stuff you probably haven't even heard about" is more fulfilling for a stuck-up hipster like you, aye?<br><br>The Lord of the Rings is extremely popular, yet both the book and the movies are fucking great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's good but /a/ hates it because it's popular. <br><br>In fact, that's a good reason not to take recommendations from /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>The classic 'people dislike my favorite anime simply because it's popular' defense. Nice one Anon.</br>  <br>Music, art and animation are gorgeous, the story isn't THAT original but it's still something new.<br>It has a few faults in the overall writing of the story, but overall it's a very good anime.<br><br>An advice: don't listen to /a/. Watch whatever you think you might like and think for yourself.<br>/a/ hates everything that becomes even remotely popular, because "m-muh secret animu club is open to filthy normies!!"</br></br></br></br></br>  We have a fresh and new intro, even the music changed. OST never  <br>The Kitora/Konami filler was gold</br>  Shouldn't Yuma have found the other half of Replica?<br>They were a block away from HQ.<br>Something tells me that Border is dissecting him.</br></br>  Megane-kun's mom is so pretty  The first OP is still the best.  Who directed this episode? Everything felt pretty fast, and the usual silences and ellipsis where you would think that they would capitalize were rushed over at full speed  <br>They put in a lot of extra filler content instead which is probably for the best.</br>  <br>this show worth watching?</br>  <br>Wow, SnK season 2 came early.</br>  <br>If you can handle Toei being Toei then sure. The beginning is slow though</br>    Hey /a/ any sexy deadly cool looking aliens in this series that will make me wanna watch this<br>Thanks in advance</br>  <br>Not /a/, but you have sexy deadly senators waiting for you</br>  <br>Rugby is indeed the sexiest sport</br>  <br>This sexy beast.</br>   I don't know why but I have an immediate dislike of that glasses kid     <br>Quick Osamu turn into a neighbor and fight him off!<br>Damn it, Osamu you can't even do that right</br></br>  <br><br>I'm guessing he's important since the camera zoomed in on him. Who is he?</br></br>  <br>I imagined this prick would have brown hair.<br><br>Btw Rinji Amatori sure has the eyes of a psycho.</br></br></br>  <br>The number 1 B-Rank squad's captain</br>  <br>He is pretty much probably the B-Rank Wars arc antagonist. Also he is a total dick.</br>  <br>He was kind of right though. It would be more efficient to put Yuma on an A-Rank team than have Osamu and Chika try to help Yuma do most of the work</br>  Did they really stretch a single chapter into an entire episode?  <br>Th extra stuff was fun though</br>  <br>But thats going against the whole point. Osamu and Chika want to be the ones to go there and rescue Rinji.<br><br>Still he will probably give the team an humiliating defeat and be defeated after that.</br></br></br>  <br> Rinji Amatori sure has the eyes of a psycho <br>Seems more like a bored sociopath. He probably was unable to find what he was looking for in the Neighborhood, but I can't blame him for trying</br></br>  <br>I think the most probable is that someone else found him and his -most likely- huge trion level.</br>  <br>I'm curious what neighbor world he ended up in</br>  <br>im betting for the ice world</br>  <br>Did the OP change again? I was reading the thread at the time so changes might have gone over my head.</br>  <br>No, just the beginning recap</br>  <br>Ah, my bad. I skipped ahead as per usual so I missed it.</br>  Which Triggers would you use?<br><br>I pick Raygust and Scorpion.</br></br>  <br>those two combine defeats every purpose they had<br>I would pick asteroid+scorpion with optional trigger branch and grasshopper</br></br>  So does Kitora, like, want to touch Osamu's trigger?  <br>Not really, i thought of a fighting style that suits having them both. I could use a kogetsu instead of a scorpion too and it might be better, but i want scorpion claws and leg blade so fuck it.</br>  There's another new OP?! I still haven't gotten over the first one being changed!  <br><br>No, no, the recap segment has changed. New music and stuff. The OP is still the same.</br></br>  I'd just like to wish the 8 people that watch this show a good time. Maybe I'll join you soon. <br><br>God Speed.</br></br>  While the filler stuff was fun I really feel like it kind of missed the tone the chapter in the manga had. The entire chapter in the manga pretty much focused on the flashback and Osamu failing to be useful.  <br>Thanks dude.<br><br><br>I also think it missed most of the dramatic, sad flashback tone with all then fun. The relief should come with his mother and not in between. Still i think it captured some of it. The Rinji scenes were nice and it didnt have the shitty padding this show uses so much.</br></br></br></br>   long hair konami <br>dropped</br>  I like how Kazama just smoothly deflects when the three saw him visiting.  <br>All Konamis are perfect.</br>  <br>Even bald konami?</br>  <br>Do you feel lucky, punk?</br>  <br>This guy being demoted probably made getting to A-Rank near impossible for the B-Units.</br>  They wasted the budget for new OP?  <br>No, not op, intro 'recap'.</br>  <br>Nah only the Mikado city + Border introduction.<br>Op won't change till the end, there are all Rank Wars teams there.</br></br>    Nice boat.      Chopping Chimp  <br> I lost my guts to fight </br>     shock value scenes   Master Keaton<br><br>dooog!</br></br>  Why didn't she just run or jump away?  <br>Mami's death wasn't a shock value scene, it was deeply calculated by Urobuchi to make the plot move and the other girls realize being a magical girl is not a game. Anybody who says Madoka is pure shock value are just haters that should go back to MAL or Reddit.</br>  <br> Mami's death wasn't a shock value scene, it was deeply calculated <br>Stopped reading there. You Madoshits are delusional as hell.</br></br>  <br>What I don't understand is why she didn't fucking run away... it stared at her for like 3-4 seconds before it ate her head, that's plenty of time to get the fuck out.</br>  <br><br> batou_in_closet.jpg </br></br>  <br><br>anime when?</br></br>  <br>Source? Google is stupid</br>  <br><br>tsugumomo</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the Battle of Vermillion got pretty dark. Every time they start commanded thousands of ships into battle, it makes you think how nonchalantly they're sending thousands of men to a horrible death.</br>  <br> Implying mutual exclusivity <br>It's almost like it was a shock for both the viewers and the characters themselves.</br></br>  <br>Anybody who says that Madoka is deeply calculated by butcher should go back to MAL or Reddit.</br>  <br> to make the plot move and the other girls realize being a magical girl is not a game <br><br>This is true, however her death WAS also for shock value. The shock factor was high with this scene and it got even more people to watch the show, especially those who would have ignored it otherwise.</br></br></br>  <br>It's same reason they had Darth Maul stand there like an idiot for a good two second to allow Obi Wan to slay his ass. <br><br>When you have an experienced, well trained character that you need to get rid of and you suck at writing, you have to pass said character the idiot ball in order for them to die.</br></br></br>  Disturbed me more than Asuka's mind rape, actually.  Too bad nothing substantial happened with it next episode.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127252409 <br>For you</br>  Hahaha-- oh, wait...   <br>Sometimes you might have imagine that what's happening isn't happening at the same speed it's being portrayed as.</br>  <br>Also, Mami is in a weird mental state of friendship retardation after talking to Madoka earlier that episode. She was fighting stupider in general, culminating in Charlotte killing her.</br>    <br>greatest scene ever tbh</br>    <br>Not to mention that the show's true nature was deliberately concealed in order to make this specific scene more shocking.</br>  <br>Metal as fuck.</br>    <br>How is that shock value?</br>      <br>oh the classic chop chimp gag wow what a crazy twist</br>  <br>His hand is off. The other one might as well be.<br>It looks like charcoal because it IS. He grabbed a dude who's power is making stuff explode, and just to get a hit in, let the guy turn an entire hand into ash, and give him like, 6th degree burns on the other wrist. <br><br>The way he actually wins that one is actually comparatively smart, too. <br><br>Then they heal it, which takes away the lasting consequences, but DAYUM. That kid, he let a guy burn his hand off.<br><br>He just has that kind of personality. He also "won" his submission match with a 20 year old guy for his license by making him admit that he could do nothing to make him surrender, and this after he had broken ribs and the guy snapped his arm like a dry branch. Then he passed out, but the guy had to admit he could not beat him without killing him. (Disqualification, he wouldn't give up.)<br><br>He's actually even more maimed at this point in the story, if not disfigured. More a spiritual thing. Although at this point, if the story has shown anything getting your spirit powers BTFO/tearing your spiritual ACL is not career ending. A badguy who got his powers sealed recently got them unsealed, and Gon will claw his way back to being Stronk again. (He's actually probably about as weak now as when he first passed his Hunter Exam.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's not shock value, that's a person getting damaged in a risky fight against a character who was established as a sociopathic serial killer.</br>  <br>Pitou did nothing wrong.</br>    <br><br><br>Sauce?</br></br></br>  Read filename first so you don't spoil yourself  <br>My favorite.</br>  Unintentional comedy moments?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127247350 <br>Have any western/4chan memes migrated to the Japanese board equivalents?</br>  <br>That clown face looks like it could fit well within the Powerpuff Girl universe, when it comes to art style.</br>  <br>There were about two scenes that shocked me in Texhnolyze. Strangely that was not one of them.</br>  <br> This entire OVA <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Osm<wbr>UdsgmaMk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Shocking, funny, and confusing. Still one of my favorite SOL comedy moments of all time.    <br>HOLY SHIT<br><br>all this time wated, not knowing</br></br></br>  <br>The sound and visual direction during that scene was nuts</br>  Not even five minutes of the first episode and then...  <br>Iniyusha already has an anime.</br>  <br>Rape from Golgo 13 The Professional</br>  <br>Greatest scene in the series<br> not including EoE because every scene in it is better </br></br>   Mirai Nikki  had a few.<br>Also Disappearance's stab.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=y37<wbr>D0BvACv0</wbr>  [ ]<br> Screen cuts to black <br> Shichika screams for five fucking seconds <br>Brutal</br></br></br>    <br><br>FB</br></br>  <br>that fucking guy just stuffing his guts back in makes me laugh every time its just too ridiculous.</br>   ;_;         <br>Is that from Kaiba? It looks familiar but I can't place it for sure.</br>  And the anime completely fucked it.    <br>I wonder this too</br>  <br>Wait, is she dead permanently? If so I'm about to drop it</br>  <br>Yeah.<br><br><br>E8 haters don't realize how this scene is basically the most important scene in the entire series, since it's the perfect preparation for Disappearance.</br></br></br></br>    <br>daishockuuuuu</br>  <br>That's not shock value.<br><br>Pic related is better. The fight overall isn't for shock value, but the way he destroys her face is. Not to mention impaling her with his own severed limb, jesus christ.</br></br></br>  <br>HxH is sometimes drawn very poorly , but man sometimes is just fantastic. I should watch the anime</br>  <br> 2 left feet  <br>Bravo Togashi<br>This scene is great but i can't unsee it and it will forever ruin it for me</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, that's not shock value.</br>    Good god that was painful to watch<br><br>Not shock value. You should have posted what happened to Ponzu</br></br>    I knew it was getting real dark by that point but holy shit  <br>Not him but I forgot about that.<br><br>Damn.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, just remembering it gives me the shivers. Narutaru had some fucked up shit.<br><br><br>I wouldn't call that shock value, though it's still my favorite moment from that anime.</br></br></br></br>    <br>keep the SnK in the SnK threads</br>  <br>It's drawn badly for about 7 volumes, and they got redrawn. I rather like the rest of the art, more than the anime.<br><br><br>Does something stop having shock value if it has some deeper meaning? Actually now that I think about it, the entire scene relies on shocking you to really drive home the point of how tragic and miserable it all is. If he won the fight without scaring the audience a bit, it would seem like too righteous a victory and that wasn't the point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>.I've only read the original, so i didn't know that. At least all the important events were greatly drawn</br>  most of these are weak as fuck, step up /a/<br><br>here's top tier shock</br></br>  <br> went in hoping for full-on yuri <br> this shit </br></br>  <br>Hoshi no Samidare.<br><br>One of the greats my friend.</br></br></br>    <br>more like biggest fuck you moment</br>  <br>Fuck that show</br>  GOOSH GOOSH GOOSH  <br>Wow, it's fucking nothing. Nobody would care about that except pedophiles. They're just dead kids.<br><br><br><br> retarded butthurt pedophiles </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply</br>    <br> retarded butthurt pedophile can't refute because everything I said are facts <br> all he can do is regurgitate something that other butthurt morons regurgitate when they can't refute <br>What a surprise.</br></br></br>  <br>Rainbow?</br>  <br>That left me depressed for weeks. Like you said, I knew it was getting really dark but holy shit</br>  <br>Punpun is GOAT.<br><br>Also giga fucking spoilers.<br><br>The first time I saw this I forgot about it for a year or so, then I actually read the manga and it all came back.<br><br>10/10 would read again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The scene in Akira where Tetsuo escapes the hospital and starts hallucinating in front of his friends. The sound design is really good, too. The whole thing is violent but this part really grabbed me. Still absolutely a stone classic and responsible for a giant wave of anime localization during the 1990s.  <br> you have been visited by the laughing girl of awful taste. you will be visited by many other awful girls, but only if you post "hot pleb" in this thread <br><br><br>thanks mr skeltal</br></br></br></br>    <br> being this random <br>Don't try to be cute, you dumb boy.</br></br>  The anime did this scene perfectly.    <br>Why would there even be a message there?</br>  <br>Can Avdol even read Japanese?</br>  <br>Why would Kenny G or Vanilla Ice even write in Japanese?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w5J<wbr>ICa_ZxBk</wbr>  [ ]  <br> set this my alarm tone <br> 2 years later, can only relate hearing this to waking up in the morning <br>This kills the PTSD.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she suddenly recognized her friend and was shocked, lost the will to live.</br>  <br>Did Dio teach them?</br>  <br>Good lord.</br>  <br> Not to mention that the show's true nature was deliberately concealed in order to make this specific scene more shocking. <br><br> 'Tis ye hour to recognize mine works as medicinals <br>lel</br></br></br></br>  aay lmao  <br>Anime babbies worship their god Urobuchi yet they've never watched a mahou shoujo show in their lives</br>  <br>Rape Scene was best</br>  One of my first anime, and I will always remember this scene because it ripped out my soul.    <br>twist it however you want, madoka is still mahou shoujo.</br>  <br>fuck you</br>  <br>Nobody said it isn't just saying that it shows that that guy has never watched one other than madoka in his life hence he has no right to imply that mahou shoujo are not as "dark" as madoka.<br><br>I'm not twisting anything.</br></br></br>  <br> other than madoka  <br>does not appear anywhere in </br></br>  <br>Another one of my favorites.</br>  It wasn't shock value. I laughed my fucking ass off.  <br>That isn't shock value you moron.<br><br>That... that was justice.<br><br>Even though the one delivering wasn't a good character.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't shock value, we saw it coming.<br><br>We knew but we couldn't protect those smiles.<br><br><br><br><br>And way before that you had Sailor Moon (manga) characters dying in gruesome ways or having a main character who comitted suicide twice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>PICKED THE FUCK UP</br>  <br> who comitted suicide twice. </br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br><br>?</br></br>  This was one of the few times an anime has ever dropped my jaw. Shame they undid it for reasons in the very next episode.  <br>The fact that they tried to make some dramatic moment like that and instantly undid it almost made me drop it because it was like the pinnacle of stupidity in the show. <br>And that's saying something because that show is really fucking stupid.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Where are these from?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I've been putting off reading this fucking thing for years. My life was shit for the longest of time so I really didn't need anything else to bum me but now everything is going great.<br><br>So great I need to kill some of it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have fun</br>  <br>I won't, you'll see!</br>  <br>google or yandex</br>  <br>I am using a mobile device.</br>  <br><br><br>What the hell?<br>This shit is sweet!</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I only know about Shigurui, not sure about the other.</br></br>    <br>It might have lost some of it's shock value because we'd been talking about it for a week beforehand.</br>  <br>I don't understand how people get so assblasted over this episode.<br>It didn't shock or bother me one bit.</br></br>  <br>Amusingly, the same thing happened to me.</br>  <br>Well, I've got to go to head off to bed.<br>I'm not sure what you meant with that pic but ok.<br><br>I really like the lighthearted tone of the thing. Bit surreal in some spot but so far it's pretty nice. Almost starting to feel like I got bamboozled into reading it thinking it turned pretty dark but there's not even a hint of that yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>YET</br>    Literally all of second Renaissance.<br><br> In B4 "GOD PLEASE HELP ME HELP ME GOD AAAAAAAAAH" </br></br>  <br>Humans were just asking for it though</br>  <br><br>You kind of want to congratulate the production team of the matrix series for attaching something so cerebrally fucked up as the Animatrix to their franchise. I know it gave way to crappier anime knock offs, but all the animatrix episodes had at least something of value in them while also being completely bonkers.</br></br>  <br>Because when you're showing off and not exactly taking a situation seriously, something like this can take you by complete surprise and render you immobile out of fear. Deer in headlights situations</br>  <br>Well to be honest, I was really hoping that the MC had just died like that. It would have been fucking amazing imo. Having this nihilistic ending where MC is supposed to go alpha, but ends up like the rest of humanity (getting fucking rekt)</br>  <br>That scene gave me a panic attack.</br>  New chapter. His name is Josefumi Kujo.<br><br>http://bato.to/read/_/329173/jojos-<wbr>bizarre-adventure-part-8-jojolion_c<wbr>h44_by_hi-wa-mata-noboru<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> The snapback from MiH made the SBR until proven otherwise. <br>It's the other way around, it's different unless stated otherwise. <br><br>ASB and Jorge weren't even made by Araki and the crazy part of Jorge explicitly takes place in a different universe from the manga anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, it's not.</br>  <br>I'm going to make the mistake of taking you seriously for a minute.<br><br>SBR is not the Ireneverse. Why? Because Irene still has Jotaro for a dad. Jotaro doesn't exist in SBR, he's split between Kira and Josefumi. Neither of them live in America. Further that takes place in 2011 and JJL is 2014, further making it impossible to be the same world.<br><br>ASB is non canon as fuck. Vanilla Ice can drink Wham's blood. That's all I have to say on that. And if you're citing Jorge, I remind you it has no translation and most of /a/ just goes on what a few anons have speculated or made up based on author illustrations.<br><br>Josefumi has the same character in his name as Josuke from part 4, and Kujo. Gappy is the second protag, but in Morioh, and stone men aren't the focus. <br><br>Please consider things before you post again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>JoJolion takes place in 2011, actually. Barely a few weeks have passed since the first chapter.</br>  <br>Anon, I haven't even read any of the side material and it's obvious that the Irene shit will be retconned if it doesn't fit with part 8 because Araki is like that. It was made very obvious that SBR takes place after made in heaven shenanigans.</br>  Here's mine:<br><br>Monday:<br>Teekyuu<br>Non Non Biyori<br><br>Friday:<br>Soma<br>im@s Cinderella Girls<br>Miss Monochrome<br>Wooser<br><br>???:<br>DRRRx2 2<br>Gatchaman Crowds<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127283360#p127283360">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather take fantasy LN adaptations than "oh no! senpai saw my panties" again.<br><br><br>Quite the opposite, if it has kept going like this for the past 10 or so years, then it obviously is working for them.
