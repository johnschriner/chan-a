[ It's finally happening. Vol. 11 is going to be released August 25, 2015.  RIKA A BEST  SEASON 3 ANNOUNCEMENT SOON?    Finally we'll be freed from this "yukimura wins" bullshit. I can't believe people actually think it'll be a permanent thing.  So Buriki is back?  And the self-declared winner of the Kiyoshibowl is...  i wonder what her urine must taste like   HANA Say it with me HANA     Will the anime be good?  pls be good;_;      HANA!     Utopia is slacking off again? Where the hell is ch180?     I can fap to this.  Is that the Snow White cap Chiyo had in the cover pic?      Nevermind, the tiara resembles Chiyo's though.    is that a fucking Ootsuka Reika drawing?    He is drawing a non hentai manga now.     Reika   he      she peed on him and then kissed him and yet Kiyoshi's not happy  It's over, Hanabros. There's only so much a woman can do for a man.    Kiyoshi would become the most hated MC ever.     HANA A N A        Mari.     Why is her body so thick in this picture? Not that I am complaining in the least, but she's usually seen as skinny in the manga.   I wish thick Hanna would stay.       Looks skinny as ever to me. Maybe it's the perspective that confuses you.     Dude, you can even see her ribs. Hiramoto really is a god.     Bitch stole the hips and legs from Meiko my niggah.      we'll never get a scene of Kiyoshi and Hana just cuddling, no fetishes        what is perspective?  She's as perfect as ever, no vice-prez shit.      Hana Hana bobana, banana fana fofana, fee fie momana, Hana    What the hell? My dick likes this hana very very much.    Another great porn artirst lost in battle.     He thinks it'll be good   In addition, the anime will ruin the threads, or at least make it worse than it already is.       181 Korean scans tomorrow   Still no sign of utopia     was 180 scanlated by anons? or just the in thread translation of koreans?   It's a dream for a porn drawer to have a proper manga. Look at Tosh, and his Shokugeki no Soma, it's really working.     porn drawer   drawer  eh nandatte?      An anon typeset it in the korean thread   I want to have sex with Hana!   That's what I'm talking about homie. That Ho's ready for Mandingo Thursday.    Hana will never passionately make out with you    Those lovely.....HIPS!    HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA        Her hands and forearms look weird, like they were drawn on later by someone else.    If this is what she'll look like in the wet-tshirt contest then bring it on right fucking now.    HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA HANA    Thick lips; wide hips. Is she, secretly, Latina?  Like, damn girl.      Scans when?    Her head would need to be smaller.     yfw this, actually, happened in the manga    Shit artist can't into foreshortening and perspective.   He kinda fucked up on this cover, but as for the comic interiors he does a pretty great job.    No. She's looking down too.   what is perspective   Please.        Hana hana hana (we love you hana)     fuck off you autist  she's drawn with wide hips here       she could have just confessed and told him she liked him. that's what he wanted, he wanted this to not be a revenge-piss only, but nope, she had to be a cheeky cunt about it. she doesn't deserve the bowl.     Oh shut the fuck up with this shit its whiny shipper bullshit at this point, itll get there soon enough. 4 years later and they are still the only two with ridiculous sexual tension that is unmatched and the only two that even resemble a couple at all. This manga builds shit up for very long periods of time to have explosively good outcomes.    I like that he has to figure out with time that he doesnt like chiyo the way he thinks he does and hana is giving him clues instead of OMG I LOVE YOU crap you seem so accustomed to.     CHIYO!     HANAHANAHANA ANAHANAHANAH NAHANAHANAHA AHANAHANAHAN HANAHANAHANA ANAHANAHANAH NAHANAHANAHA AHANAHANAHAN           I'm not accustomed to it at all. Tsundere being cheeky and unclear about her interest is the common thing, not the opposite.    I want to fuck her so bad     same creative staff as Shirobako  I'm ready even if there's no budget    Daily reminder that you will never get disciplined by the vice-president.   BATMAAAAAN!   Does Hana like potatoes?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=87a<wbr>tHQpNtss</wbr>  [ ] Prison school Open song   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YJ-<wbr>kF_6B4bQ</wbr>  [ ]  Prison school  End song       nice, when does the anime start airing again?     nevermind, I'm an idiot   Let's appreciate them.  I'll appreciate them with my dick  Posting while the thread is still good.    Do not sexualize the imouto!     Blogfags when?    I'll stop sexualizing them when they stop being so sexy   my himouto cant be this cute!   Hopefully soon. Those stories are like cocaine.   Quints and all your imouto needs will soon be satisfied.   Imoutos are the best. Imoutocest is also best and purest incest.      Too lewd   This is how imoutos wake up their onii-chans   I just fapped to this. Shit was great.    Sora represent.    Why do the best imoutos not get any fanart?   Yes    Dem shorts   Love Live imoutos are the best.   anyone else butthurt that she didn't get to succeed to Muse?     Hopefully soon. Those stories are like cocaine.   Post examples?      anyone know if they show up in the movie?   Ah, good. The retard who can't even watch an entire anime and cherrpicks to force their shit opinion as fact isn't here.  If they show up, don't worry. I've got plenty of experience from browsing shitty boards lately to crush them with as much venom as possible.     What?     You most certainly will not, that will only ruin a brand new thread.     Never mind.   Okay.      whatever happened to the anon who duct taped a knife to his bathroom ceiling?  Best imouto.   No school uniform skirt is that transparent.    What?    There was an anon that posted in imouto threads; he duct taped a knife to his bathroom's ceiling in case his imouto tried to rape him while he is taking a shower.    This confuses me.    What's confusing about yandere imoutos?    Many things. Why not get raped by your imouto?     girls   rape      I am fiending for more of this stories oh my god. Especially when its cute or sexy, preferably at the same exact time.    Yes.    Sexycute is what imoutos specialize in    You're from the last thread.  Me too.      I'm from every thread   I don't think having another Imouto thread after that 600 post one earlier today is a good idea. I do not think I'll survival bump this one when it passes midnight. We don't want to become an all the time general do we?     I really can't quite make out what's happening here.  I mean, I get that it's a nude Kirino, but it just looks a bit off        She's stifling her moans by burying her head into the pillow?     Close in age imoutos are superior.  Please don't make Love Live imoutos cry, they need love too   Agreed,    fuck_me_already.jpg    Close in age incest is the best in general.    Maybe he just needs Sora to cheer him up.     Incorrect, 4-6 year separation is best     This. Plus, the younger the best. Ideal age to start corruption/conflicted curiosity or interest is 7-9 and ideal age to start full blown lust is 11-16.   For anyone who isnt privy.   This can't be real, can it?    It can. Believe in the imouto.    what a dumb girl, should've just turned into a slut like our overlords demand it     3D     Hope is nothing more than a cruel laughable delusion to bear reality.    Don't know about the rest of the story, but the initial part about the ringpop sounds believable.   My imouto made me a mixtape when I went off to college. She even went so far as to use printshop or whatever to make a cassette liner insert, listing the songs on each side and a brief blurb about why she chose each one. I still have it somewhere.       OHB and Ringpops (although short and seemingly incomplete) were good. It saddens me that I haven't seen a new hero in the recent year who is comparable.    I really hope they went somewhere safe and fugged. Hard.    There are no more heroes, anon. The Christian god killed them all.    I'm always curious where these people are now. I doubt he pursued this with the way he is in the last part. Girl is probably a slut now..    There are no heroes here, only wizards    There was that anon who nutted up and showed his Onee-san that one incest thread then got kicked out for like a month for it. Last I heard he said if it was going to be this much trouble he might as well had raped her.    There was also tha one anon whose sister got in a car accident, and let slip that she loved him. Wonder what came of that    They look fucking fat.      I forgot about that one.    99% of them are incredible normalfag and not near perverted enough to go the incest route. This delusion is just for people without siblings.    Out of all the anons posting, he seemed like the most sensible one. I think that if he had ended up loving his sister the way she loved him, they could have made a happy pair    Wish the best for him.   tfw Onii-chan wont play games with imouto anymore.    Girl is probably a slut now  <br/>     Imoutos make good slaves. I say slaves but I mean the kind that look up to you even though you treat them shittier than the bad boy love interest in a shoujo manga.  Have them wake you up. Flick their forehead for fun. Have them cook and make bento and bring to your classroom bc you 'forgot'. Tease them. Deny them any boyfriends. etc  Then they forgive you with a head pat.        If he didn't pursue her, she'd probably be burned from this. Not like I hope she became one.    Why are nips so obsessed with little blonde girls?    Because Blonde white girls are the most beautiful.    Maybe because its exotic to them who are awash of black heads.      I really like the colours.      Anything that is not black is exotic by this logic then.    Cute but really fucking fake, but cute. It would of been more believable if they didn't 'meet' on /a/, that is /b/ tier made up story shit.    "The fedora is practically tipping its self!!!!"   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153416  It hurts.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153416  I just want to hear things worked out for them.       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127153416   No imouto  My problem starts there. I hate my life.     She doesn't get enough attention.         Would you do it for Komachi?     Do what?      I'd do Komachi, if you catch my drift.    In the butt, right? Can't risk imouto getting pregnant.    Oh please, you know that anyone on 4chan wouldn't have half the creativitiy to produce such a story as this.    I'm not picky, I wouldn't mind.    Get the fuck out, summerfag. And take your shitty trip with you.    Ubermensch-class imouto.    I've been here for 2 years m8.     Literally no one cares.  Also the more you claim you've been here X amount of years, the more you show how new you are.       So? How long do you have been here? Maybe if you'd have looked up my trip on the archieves that I've been posting with since before summer.  But using that little brain of yours after all these fap sessions, or what ever you do with your life, might be too exhausting.  Guys, am I fitting in yet? I'm calling that Tripfag a summerfag, I'm soooo part of the elitist 4chinchin group. Fuck off and never reply to me again.         Oh, i used to be the Siscon back when i was 15 and my imouto was 12, however over the years she turned into a cock hungry whore who is known throughout our college for her blowjob technique.  I love Karen because she reminds me about her a lot, a shame i didn't know about the power of toothbrushes back then.      Hot.     You should have gotten there first, kept her pure. She's a slut because she has no brother to love.     No it's not, It killed my soul and turned me into a reclusive fuck.      Hot.     You should have fucked her so she would remain pure.    This. You could have avoided all that, anon. If only you took the chance and kept her pure by having her focus her love and sexual interests to you, her onii-chan.     Stop fucking whining, go meet her, enjoy her dick-sucking technoque, give her the fuck of her life, start dating, problem solved.     These are the reasons I'm glad I kept up with my imouto and made sure she stayed pure    How did you assure that?    By loving her and always being interested in her life. She almost got involved with some nasty people and I tried to make sure she didn't.   SINKING HER OWN SHIP EDITION    Todokanai Koi    Is dat some new nickname?  Asking again, from which part of the LN was the aquarium scene?  Cunt killer where?   maybe not yet..

All these Yui flags, are they good or bad I cant tell  Did Yukino just admit she's a fish?  This ep=WA2 onsen ep  COOKIES  why are they inside washing machine?  HAHA TIME FOR DRAMA   Nope   FUCK Yukino's reaction when she didnt give Hachiman her chocolates   Jelly fish tank.  Symbolizing Yui's feelings.

WHY  Jesus fuck, the spoilers didn't do this justice  YUKITEARS  MY YOUTH ROMANTIC COMEDY IS WRONG AS I EXPECTED.  Its all but a Yukino end I feel like   It will happen   It's been an honor Yuibros. But it has finally ended.  Did 8man just save the Yuiship?  WHAT THE FUUUUUCK     Vol. 11    thread blowing up in 1...2...3...   WHAT JUST HAPPENED?  I AM SO CONFUSED     Maybe.

HOLY FUCK.  Still mad  Why? MC got a good end whilst bitch got a bitch end as deserved.   mangafox   He ended up with the bitch though It's all good    Yankee-chan wasn't the bitch.  Angry glasses cunt was the bitch.      Why? He got what he deserved and it works for him. He was a horrible person and wasn't worthy of the girl he liked. She chose someone that brings good vibes to all. You know, the guy that despite all the shit MC did was the FIRST to forgive him and invite others to be his friend!     got what he deserved  If I remember correctly, wasn't he entrapped by that glasses bitch into doing the actions outside of his daily activity?     mangafox    yeah but it was more personal with the girl he liked.    He ended up with the superior girl anyway.   Those that hate it are reminded of themselves.   And I fucking hate that shit, I remember when /a/ first found this shit, horrible.     mangafox    mangafox    mangafox    mangofux    Not him but I started reading it on mangafox (first result on google) then switched to batoto mid way and it's exactly the same thing.    says you    mangafox     mangafox   Still a retard.       pretending to be retarded   Please fuck off.      What ?    mangafox   It was a good ending, you knobheads.     Reading manga on a site I don't understand why is so bad, so I'll just post &gt;mangafox to fit in    mangafox       it's exactly the same thing.      being this retarded     mangafox    magnavox  Odyssey was a good console.    I know, that bitch isn't worth of afrobro    OP pls.  mangafox     OP, Mangafox is pretty bad, so  mangafox       no water mark   higher resolution   the same thing   &gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/         Telling people to go away isn't really going to make them go away.    Better than pretending they don't exist.    mangafox   You stupid idiot.     autism   Am I doing this right guys?  also  inb4 OP         Stop it, OP.    mangafox    people fully empathized with the misanthropic loser bitch boy MC and were mad when his crush got with someone who suits her and actually asked her out  Even losers should have pride and common sense. Don't be pathetic.   Sugawa ending was the best, though  I don't even remember what this was about.  MC likes whacking it Glasses finds out Blackmail ?????         mangafox   Confirmed moron.     Why didn't he end up with glasses..  Would you rather a Rin, or a Hisui &amp; Kohaku?   not picking the meidos     Tsundere  I don't even know what the other two are, but they're by default better than the tsundere. Unless one of them is a tsundere of course, in which case I might as well just kill myself.    MAIDS A I D S        broken mess clones  Incorrect.     Just Hisui for me, please.   What did /a/ think of the anime? Will there be an S2?  It was shit, and you already know the answer to that question.   There is no reason for this thread, wait until tomorrow when the 4koma comes out.    The action scenes and battles were shitty and boring and lacked tension. They even let the "real" final enemy that was hyped up so much die off-screen. It wouldn't be so bad if there was less fighting. They shouldn't have bothered if they weren't going to put any effort into it.     S2  Fuck no.    Haruna best   Wasn't it already confirmed?      What the fuck were they thinking, not cancelling it.  Speaking of which, do the nips want S2?       No Kyuu     It sold pretty well so yes   Why do I get the feeling that the Abyssal girls arem't actually evil?   You're delusional, that's why.    https://twitter.com/michsuzu/status<wbr>/613157974501015554 https://twitter.com/michsuzu/status<wbr>/613158344983838720 Kadokawa says otherwise </wbr> </wbr>    Why cancel it? While it did under perform and was hated by the most of the fanbase, Kancolle is still a profitable franchise. Even if S2 is complete shit, all they got to do is bundle it with a bunch of merchandise and crap it will sell decently.    Because they're cute in fanart?    Just because it didn't sell the way they were expecting doesn't mean it didn't sell pretty well.     Wo 9     Kancolle   small c         cancolle      I don't know, maybe it's the  depressing BGMs and listening to  them crying about falling cherry blossoms?      This, you worded it well. I'm personally not a big fan of SoLs but seeing the girls do shipgirl stuff was cute and fun. I just wish that they focused more on the military base / ship stuff like refeuling, upgrades, stuff like that.   Best Shiratsuyu   But she's a Shigure class girl.     girl     You wouldn't bully number one, would you?    If she grows out her hair I won't bully her.     What did /a/ think of the anime?  Literal fucking garbage. Fuck you for reminding of it.  Will there be an S2?  Fuck you for reminding me of that too.      <br/>    I hope soon     <br/>   Bongou desu   Why Shigure is a boy again?    Boku. That's it. That's the only reason.    She is using boku to referring to herself. And boku usually used by boys.    Because a gender-swapped Shigure is pretty popular. Just like Z1, Z3, and Shimakaze are popular with trap loving artists.    Not always. But I can see how you would be autistic enough to not be able to separate them.    kongou conga when    I have never seen a female actor using "boku" in tokusatsu naturally referring to themselves so, yes its weird when a female does it.    But females do use it, that's the point. So Shigure is a girl, despite the whole Shipgirl angle being ignored but you fucks. So now to put this stupid meme to rest.     So bongo, bongo, bongo, I don't wanna leave the Kongou, oh no no no no no     That's why I said usually.   And this is from my experience watching Chinese cartoons.     under appreciated third sis-con sister Hiei  Anime should have ended with Enterprise-chan avenging Yorktown-san, and annihilating the jap fleet.   Enterprise-chan is too busy chilling in San Diego.    Females using it is weird and abnormal.   I like how Hisahiko properly depicated her as a siscon for her imoutos as much as she is for her oneesan. I wish more fan artists understood her character and personality better then just focusing her attention on Kongou.        under appreciated   That's not Kirishima.    I hope pic of anime  <br/>   No kyuu      A dead series from Kadokawa's manga factory?    would you eat Hiei's curry?      Only after she tastes if first. A chef must know what they are serving to people.    Wokyuu   No good lewds of Kuroshio, such suffering.   <br/>    I would not allow Haruna, DesDiv 6, Beaver, or Bongou to suffer it.    Wo kyuu   Beaver won't suffer it either way.       dead?　not Conclusion　end? I know only 1kan .        sasayuki is Baily Nice hentai mangaka{Cartoonist}       What language is this?      ESL kun hath returned   No translation for today?   Some of them certainly aren't.    Trucks etc    Are trucks breeding?     Petting a facehugger.     hi... HIEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIII!!!</wbr>    this saddens me    Kaga will be an excellent mother for that Chestburster     Disgusting     1+ hour of repair time  I have a bit of free time now, want anything translated from Chinese?    Yes, anything Kaga related please    This has yet to be translated.   http://exhentai.org/g/825825/d1a81d<wbr>59ee/</wbr>       This has yet to be translated.  I could've sworn it already was.

Something with Fubuki-class or Ayanami-class in it     https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gzV<wbr>_a9QlWkg</wbr>  [ ] Vol 6 cover is Akagi.      RIP Nagato  Another victory for Yamato.      Nagato is in vol 5 BD cover with Ooyodo and Mutsu. Ooyodo only has the jacket to herself.    And Yamato got the complete package, your point?    why can't you just say kancolle thread. you don't have to pretend to be curious about the anime or an s2    Red Fleet  when?   Russia didn't have a significant Navy in WW2.    Breast ranking.    Not canon.    The soft carriers are missing (and Katsuragi).    One token destroyer/cruiser is fine. They're like allies lite.     That image is older than them.     They're like allies lite  Italia isn't enough for you?      Zuikaku-sempai a best.    alien ＋kanmusu＝?     I like Shoukaku better. Plus Shoukaku is a way cooler name than Zuikaku      I think Zuikaku is a good name, at least original.       Yuudachi and Naka Kai 2   Kongou not kai 2  Kuso.     This is canaon, right?     Poi and Naka both have a lower Kai II remodel level than Kongou, though.    Yeah but even Suzuya isn't Kai which I just noticed. This is prime level of kuso.   The only Kongou you are supposed to sortie is Kirishima.   The European fast battleships are all way superior.     But it's way easier to level up Kongou than DDs.   but what about the bauxite   You mean the bitch that kept sending me back to base on 5-5 pre-boss node when everyone else only had scratch damage?     But it's way easier to level up Kongou than DDs.   4-3  Either way, maybe that Admiral's just grinding who he likes.      Nothing levels DD so good as being stuck at 3-2 and 5-3.   I will post this occasionally until you like her.  I'm not the only one here who scraps a ship once she gets to 99 and then starts leveling her again, right?    I  already do      http://dec.2chan.net/60/res/526283<wbr>7.htm</wbr>   743 posts, mostly images, just about Murakumo  Jesus christ      Either way, maybe that Admiral's just grinding who he likes.     You better use her as modernization fodder for her lower level self once you kai them    Disgusting.   Looks like I'm out of time.  For now here's what I've translated so far. I'll continue it if I can, or if someone else wants to pick up the slack that's fine too.  http://pastebin.com/4XcJ7CZD      How do you make a show with female girls as ships that fucking boring?  Well Diomedea found a way, I'm not looking forward to S2 unless Shimakaze screen time goes up dramatically.     Look at the brighter side. At least GONZO seems like they're going to make a good work.  I'm actually hyped for S2.      This shitty rumor needs to die.    Why the fuck are they not even considering cancelling this farce?    For the last fucking time it still sold well so they're not going to cancel it.    Shut the fuck up.

Cos you are American   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127154647  Wait, who are you again?    First, I'd like to say that my free 1+ hour ended long ago, so maybe I'd look into translating these, but only tomorrow at the very earliest. The game comes first.  Next, due to quality translation concerns, I'd greatly appreciate it if the Japanese raws are also available for me to cross-reference with if I should have doubts about the Chinese translated text (which is rather often, to say the least).  Now, about the doujin themselves: The first 3 look good (and the nip raws are available on sadpanda, too), but the 4th looks like by the time I get around to starting on it, it'd have been translated, and since I'm not too big on anal, the 5th will be of a lower priority. On top of that, sadpanda doesn't have the nip raws for it so that's another point against it, at least unless some other site has it.  Well then, back to world 4 weekly.

Unless you count the USSR as a fascist regime, which wouldn't be too farfetched during Stalin's regime.     None that I can think of.    That would also have to include Prinz and Takao since they were given to the USA and England as war prizes.    It's fog, probably to help hide the tacky CGI sea.

Haruna is daijoubu    It's rather sad to know that future little destroyers aren't going to have a big nee-chan BB to escort them across the oceans anymore.     future destroyers   little  Anon, in a few centuries I daresay destroyers will become as big as the hotels were in the 1940s.      Don't worry. As laser guided technology, railguns, and mass-driver based weaponry becomes more practical and realistic along with the improvements and continual mass reliance upon drones and non-human piloted aircrafts, battleships will make their return.  Probably in 2180-2200 when the US and Western Europe gets into a space war with China and Russia in the Energy Crisis.      Pretty huge already    I don't like how they keep the name "Destroyer". Why don't they just use Battleship?     The fucking pyramid mast  God damn modern ships are hideous.     It reduces its radar signature mate.    I prefer missile boats, they're cute    Because it can take on air targets,anti ship, and even missile defense(?) and it has VLS.  What battleship has VLS?   muh radar  Like pagodas are better right?           Poi    It would just be a Battleship in name. Why call a ship that is the size of a Battleship a Destroyer?     missile boats     Battleboat.      Battleboats &amp; double Corvette   Wo am I?    Muh politics, muh terminology. People would be less concerned if a navy of another country has "destroyers" than if it has "battleships".      Why is Yayoi always angry?       Yuu are hier.    Just like how a Kirov    isn't a battleship either, even though the Kirov is bigger than most WW2 BBs (almost as big as a yamato), and the largest surface combatant ship in service. Because these ships carry missiles and they don't have large caliber guns. Sure the guns on a zumwalt (and if it ever gets a railgun) are more accurate and perhaps more deadly than a ww2 BB, but its not a large caliber.  Obviously its down to terminology more than anything, but battleships have always been heavily armored and had large caliber guns.         I thought the Kirovs were battlecruisers.      NATO considers them battle cruisers, Russians consider them cruisers. Doesn't change the fact its going to be slinging missiles.    Well technically battlecruisers are still cruisers.    Nigger, most modern day warships including late Cold War era cruisers have practically no armor, smaller caliber cannons and guns and are built around speed and force projection with cruise missiles and AA to safeguard carriers.  Think of modern day surface warships as being like modern day soldiers; well armed, but lightly armored for mobility. And look at old World War I/interwar/2 era warships as their medieval cousins.      Yeah that's what I am saying, so any ship made today regardless of size could not be called a battleship.     Thinking Obama will let America last that long.     Germany please go       Like pagodas are better right?  Pagodas actually look good when not going overboard like in the Fukous. See Nagato's and Kongou's.     Kongous were the cutest ones        Rest in peace     Ha. Take that, stupid bitch.

Daijoubu    How can one girl be this perfect?      Loli    Tits  What kind of abomination is that ?       Wait, so they're saying they seriously never noticed that Yugi changed into a completely different person until he literally pointed it out to them?  What horrible quality are you watching there?   That because his look never change, it's change anime effect for viewer   In 0 manga, most of his face stay same but give bad(creepy) feeling      Poor English aside, this guy is right. In the manga Yugi didn't get tall and sexy, he just got more intimidating usually. It wasn't until the art style started to change a bit and we got into Duelist Kingdom the iconic Dark Yugi look came in, by which point everyone knew there were two Yugi's thanks to the Shadow RPG.    I want to lay Tea in face-down position.    How is Yugi never banned for cheating?    Because he leaves all his opponents in the shadow realm where they can't complain about anything.      In the manga Dark Yugi only comes out for Shadow Games early on. As the series continues and we get into Duelist Kingdom, having their grandfather on the line is enough to warrant Dark Yugi to become more prominent. The only time he really "cheats" as Dark Yugi is against Pegasus, but that barely counts since Pegasus also had a Millennium Item and it was a Shadow Game. In Battle City all of his opponents are Ghouls or those using Millennium Items, Kaiba who considers Dark Yugi his rival and Jonouchi who considers Dark Yugi his goal. I can't talk much for the anime filler since I haven't watched that since I was young, but I don't recall any cheating going on ni Millennium World either.   tl;dr Yugi only turns into Dark Yugi before games start usually and more often then not is against opponents who are dubious at best or downright evil/have dark powers. So the Pegasus Duel is the only time I recall him "Cheating"      what's up with the sudden titties?    Yeah but Yugi isn't the one dueling. He isn't the one winning games. And he gets all the glory and prizes     Maybe the editors told Takahashi to turn down the gay and this is what his response was.   This could be the last summary so let's wait for summary anon  Link to previous thread   and pastebins so far http://pastebin.com/dcRjk8Qz http://pastebin.com/ZYg63XLw          Thank god DAL13 was confirmed, plus we've got the movie    and the game but we still need a release date for Volume 13    really?    I think summary anon said Tachibana says something about volume 13 in the afterwords.   Oh yeah, if any of you guys have a pastebin for chapter 4 feel free to post it.   Movie and Encore 4 will be released this August.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127163123  Stop. Faggot    Ignore him.   So let's continue our talk from last time. Is Shido a lolicon, and if so, how high does his strikezone go?   I don't want it to end. This is one a few series where I can discuss it without the thread devolving in waifu wars    Lets not    Shidou is a lolicon, this volume only confirmed the obvious.    It seems to like imouto-like lolis better than bitch lolis like Natsumi.    Pretty much as low as Natsumi and as high as Mana for lolicon range.   I really should've start continuing reading the actual novel instead of getting the story from a silly card game duel   What are you even talking about? Why would you get the story from a video?    It's pretty much a crossover fanfiction between Zexal and DAL but the author keep DAL story intact, just with Barians running around in the story.  It's what gets me to read DAL in the first place too.      There is no pastebin for volume 4 but we should get it done today.    I know abot the crossover but how can anyone get interested in a LN based on a crossover? It sounds weird.   No. This thread was first.   <br/>     Does Mana even count as a loli?    If Kotori is considered a loli then Mana should be one as well.    It doesn't sound that weird. You have this one anon here who don't know anything about the series, got interested with the girls and spirit stuffs from DAL based on what he'd seen then he tried to read the actual LN.  Having the story to be mainly about DAL helps too      but what if the crossover has a different story than the novels? Would you still read it?    If DAL ended on 12, it would one hell of a rushed job that probably wouldn't make sense.    I don't know who does cause none of the girls are particularly big    Yoshino, Kotori, Natsumi and Mana are loli. Tohka has the mentality of a toddler.   Someone mentioned in the last thread that Shido has 11 hidden in his name, but I still don't see it. Is it like Reine where you have to manipulate the kanji?   Except Miku    Yeah, look at the 10 in Tohka's and 1 in Origami's name then look at Shidou's name.    Yeah, 11 is 十一。士 is in Shidou's name.     Tohka has the mentality of a toddler.  Retard     五河士道 Guess where the hidden number is.     She's still shorter than Miku and slighty taller than Reine.    She is. She's a tiny bit older, like 1 year physically above Kotori. She's always described as a small girl, same narrative like the other lolis.    Well yeah? Since the crossover use DAL settings then if I'm interested with the settings in the first place I don't think I'll be dropping the novel. There's bound to be story difference but if most of the settings are mainly the same then I'll still be reading it. Good thing that the story isn't that different though.  But if the settings are vastly different (e.g no spirit stuffs in the actual novel) then I probably won't read it.      No she has the plot    Thanks.    First time that studying Japanese has confused me more than not. Didn't even think of that.        Fair enough, why is the guy doing those videos anyway?    Token loli =/= loli    He likes card games and chuuni stuffs. Most cardgame fics are done in nico and shows the duels with video instead of just text like plain fanfiction.    No I meant her boobs are to big for loli status    So are Kotori's then    Mana is bigger then Kotori     LOLFUCKINGKEK     What? Did you think those anime breasts were real? She flatter then Origami and let me tell you Origami is flatter than you think.    What breasts?    LEART TO USE THE FUCKING CATALOG YOU FAGGOT       ALSO REPORTED.         it's early and the Autism has already started    Kotori   bigger than anyone  Here are some numbers for you anon: 真那 (Mana) 身長：147cm (4' 10'') スリーサイズ : B74 W56 H80  琴里 (Kotori) 身長：145cm (4' 9'') スリーサイズ : B72 W53 H74             no Kurumi date  2/10 volume   Ignore that guy, he tried to do the same last thread.   I feel the same     dating the original  She didn't even get a date in volume 3, that was her clone.      too big  No, they're not. Her tits aren't you even bug enough to see her as an oppai loli.     That would just be blatant pandering    Author is saving Best for last    aren't even big enough*  Damn. I need sleep.      Wait for her arc and the massive amount of suffering she will get.    I'll be a bit late today. Got some urgent work after got home, so will be back in an hour.     aren't you even bug enough  Heh     See, here's what I don't get. Origami is a 75 bust and has obvious cleavage. Mana is a 74 and does not. There is a 1cm waist difference, but that shouldn't be enough to give Origami tits and Mana a swell.   What's here tragic backstory? Any guesses?       2 DAL threads at once  Kinda faggy, but I like seeing one of my favorite series to discuss on /a/ still alive    Origami suffered and Got a good Arc so that would mean Kurumi's arc will be amazing    Sure no problem.    But this thread was made by a retarded secondary who doesn't know how to use the catalog, the other thread was posted earlier.     What's here tragic backstory? Any guesses?  We already know her story but not the reason she started to mass murder people but it's implied she is trying to change the past to prevent this.     I doubt we will have continuous threads again so enjoy them for now.    we really don't know much about her tbh    We can wait, there is not much left anyway.    I don't know what you're talking about.    See now this is ridiculous. Origami is supposed to be the petite girl    Got it.   We really don't know much about her. We know that she's killing and gathering lots of power, but not her exact reasons why. I fully expect her to go full Nox and for the time travel to fuck up.       we still don't know her entire backstory    This is what Origami really looks like    Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?   I will.  I don't expect /a/ or Japan to do the same though.     I will  S2 never ;_;7     i will never forget cock butt, for it was fat and glorious   If you watch it, buy the BDs.

As much as I love the show, Nya gets on my fucking nerves like nothing else.   I'll remember it as the only show to use CG right, that is, as a fun and colorful medium that clearly looks like 3D, as opposed to shows using it to skirt on animation costs.  Other than that, I doubt I'll hold dear the abysmal humor, the two-dimensional (har har) characters, the annoying co-MC and the forced heartstring-tugging moments.  I wish someone compiled just the 3DCG parts so I could relish in how nice they looked without having to suffer through the shit that the rest of the show was.      Rabbit? More like RabBest.

Those two posts are mandatory in every etotama thread      I don't even get where this came from since she has no notable feet scenes. Like, at all.      watches anime   bashes things for being childish      It makes even less sense since Cow is an actual admitted footfag.    I thought she was just a smellfag.     no foot scenes   literally cums automatically from having her feet massaged  footfags when will you learn     Think of all the effort they put into making those CG models.  Now think about how the data is just going to be stashed into some server, and never to be touched again. Or worse, they delete the models.     But they never even touch her feet. It's always her ankle.  Also her bare feet are never shown or focused on which is kind of a requirement for this fetish.     Cat Rat Ox Tiger Rabbit Dragon Snake Sheep Monkey Rooster Dog Pig  I'll remember and miss them all.     Just her booty? All her body was glorious.    No shots of her feet whatsoever. mad/10   That part of her gloves that only goes over her middle finger is pretty hot.       quints confirm it.    They should sell it. People will probably buy it too.   Number of Etotama threads in the last 24 hours that had less than 100 posts:        5 Etotama threads! Ha! Ha! Ha!           The fuck, why you guys doing this? Just make one thread people.     implying they were all made at once  One guy made a thread, it soon died, another guy came too late, saw that there was no Etotama thread, made one, soon it also died, rinse and repeat     Each one was one thread. Each one died quick deaths.  Not surprised though, there is nothing to talk about until the last episode and no ome will talk about etotama a week or 2 after that.  It will be forgotten and no one will remember it as everyone here latches onto the next waifu show.         Don't you mean 'Sayonara'?      Anon, no please   ;__;   Jaa nee is fine.     Yes.    Actually I saw 2 or 3 threads open at the same time, since there were so many I just ignore.    there is nothing to talk about until the last episode  I think that is sadly true now. I miss the old threads.   waifu show.  You talking about the other 30 series airing every season? Please, Etotama is the only series trying to be original and well, you can see the price of that, if is not waifushit, shippingshit, /ushit, shonenshit, haremshit and more, it won't sell, and then you see people complaining anime industry is shit.          Should I even bother trying to 'clean' these scans anymore? I am not sure this is how you clean them up, but HOLY SHIT look at all these fucking dots   Maybe she has acne?     Will you remember the Etotamas when they're gone?  I'll probably archieve it for now, it might merit a potential rewatch.     What happened to the rest of the chapters? Or the guy translating die?    I shared the mega link to my scans a few weeks ago. An anon who kept posting with Usa-tan reaction images said he would TL them at his free time, but there hasn't been any news from him ever since.  So either the guy really died (if so, sincerely RIP), or  footfags   best anything          Slut   Best girl.      ...unless you're talking about the 'cleaning' I've been doing, which is being done independently from his TL and straight out of whims of an amateur who has never done anything like this before.  Here, have a picture for comparison.      Where are you reading, anon?    https://mega.co.nz/#F!itESTKzD!uN4r<wbr>JYYaMGjrv8JHLKA1kA</wbr>    Amazing, where is the other stitches?    Only other one that I've done is Nya-tan.    You know what I'll remember after they're gone? ne ushi tora u tatsu mi uma hitsuji saru tori inu i  I ain't got room in my head for the chinese version though.        still 6 more than the characters in the show       The first 6 of them yeah       dat weird blue-green tint as the night turns to day  On one hand it looks disgusting, but on the other it feels comfy      Fuck it, maybe if the TLs are not up by the time I finish 'cleaning' Chapter 7 I'll TL the chapter myself.  If I can still remember Morita-san wa Mukuchi and the threads that /a/ had for it I can remember Etotama.  Cock is love, Tiger is love, Cow is love, Dragon is love, Horse is love.  One autist, a paintbrush and a couple hours later.  I want to commit a crime against the gods.    I don't get it     Take a wild guess.     Very nice work.     Yes, but only because I'll have the character songs downloaded to remind me.    I love that Rabbit has a little apron on her bikini bottom.    Who let the cow-titted hag in this image?    third character song mini album released on Japanrecords   track titles are wrong  This seems really suspicious.     45 seconds until I know    And it works.    SMUG AHEAD    What exactly am I looking at?     the etotama protects specific regions of japan.     I must say Piyo-tan fans are really devoted.    Piyo-tan is a treasure and everyone should like her.  Every girl should be loved though.   Except fatties.           a shogi piece appears on her back suddenly  being animator is suffering.     Nyaa, Uri, Moo, Piyo, Mei, Chuu, Usa, Shima, Dora, Shaa, Kii and Inu. They're all best.          Maybe it's cause of the framerate.            I want to make horse feel wanted, if you know what I mean.    I'd  race  with her.    Well, I'd mount her.    I'd whisper her name in her ear over and over again until she starts to think it sounds good.     until she starts to think it sounds good.   I don't think you can live that long.      With or without a bridle?    Not sure why she thinks 'Uma' doesn't sound good, isn't that what Japan calls Caramelldansen?     So, do the etotamas who has ear things over their head, do they still have ears where it would normally be or no?  Like , in that pic you can't see any 'ear' because it's covered by her side hair, same with all the other etotamas (except dess dess) who has ears on top of their head.       Paca-tan S2 never  Why?   Only show I actually really enjoyed this season. Rest have just been really average or not exactly enjoyable. If it weren't for Prisma coming out summer, I'd probably have dropped the cash on the BD's.    I would have totally bought the BDs   But I didn't.   Thank you for your ultimately pointless post.   Feel free to reply to me, just like I replied to you.         Why?  Do you even need to ask that question?     I'm not him but okay    What happened to the brown Etos? I want my collection complete.     I will easily forget them, what a bland boring show. Okay, it's not that bad, 7/10 at least.    I hope we see something Nendowise from Wonderfest this fall.   I wonder how they will play this joke on the bluerays    I hope the rabbit scene is replaced with her thanking the viewer for purchasing the BDs and supporting the industry.   It was a good ride guys.  Glad to share these moments with you all.    which of the etotama would say yes if you just came up to them with a straight face and asked to have sex with them   All of them except the one you like, because you're waifu a shit.     I'm sure dess dess would say yes if you slathered yourself with sesame oil beforehand, and injected sesame oil into your testicles     She should also shit on people who are just pirating the BD in the same scene.    Mo, Shaa, Kii, and Shima seem like they'd be game.      ejaculate sesame oil   Give her what she wants and render yourself permanently sterile at the same time, where is the bad in this        Cow couldn't   Cock couldn't twice   Rat couldn't   Combo of Sheep, Snake, and Rat couldn't    Rabbit could   Best           All of them, if I'm being honest with myself.  If I had to choose the most sexual though, it would be Kii, Shaa, Uma, Nyaa, and Shima.      It helps that this thread asks a relevant qiestion considering the show is ending with no sign of it ever getting a S2.  But yes Usa-tan a best.       Usa-tan seems to be the marmite of the etotamas.  I think she's unbearable, and others have expressed the same opinion. I respect your opinion though.         Mo-tan  Only if you are a cute girl anon.     Please, this thread was dying yesterday, Cock save it     Well I read that question completely backwards. Now I sound like a narcissistic sociopath.  None of them, if I'm not allowed to use trickery.       Cock couldn't even save either of her own threads.     if you raped cock and forced her to take 3 steps every time, will it lead to a mind break     depends.  She will either instinctually learn to crave your cock or instinctually do all she can to rip it clear off any time she sees you.  high risk high reward.         I'm sure it'll be easier if you gave her some form of classical conditioning a la Pavlov's Dog experiment.  Except instead of conditioning a dog to salivate to the sound of a bell, you make cock salivate to a good dicking.  since she forgets the experience every time it's even easier, considering she wouldn't realized she's being conditioned           you could take it a step further and make her associate everyday things to dicks, so when she's doing something like drinking water she'll crave sex.     I don't want it to be thursday yet  What if.... ova.     character specific OVAs that is about them and not about fucking recaps   I can dream       I was thinking more of a catch up ova this fall, with Nyan-tan helping out Chu-tan and  loli Mo-tan  care for the world.    We're getting those OVA shorts. I wouldn't expect anything else.    Still waiting for those manga translations. Some anon said he was going to do chapter 7.  Cock.  You got to take to a date and spend one day with your zodiac, how does it go?    rat  I'd rather kill myself      Kii-tan   I dunno, I wouldn't mind playing around with her but she'd probably miss Inu-tan quickly. Can I take them both?       Kii-tan.  It would end in sex because she's easily tricked, and she really turns me on.       Cock.     I probably won't.  It seems like one of those shows that are fun but forgettable and you barely remember their name a few years later, like Kyouran Kazoku Nikki.      We talk about deep things and end up cuddling.     Dora-tan  Would be fun      Dragon   That's fine. She's cute. And if she's patient enough to deal with Nya-tan's shit then she probably won't have a problem with me either.       We'd play shogi all day and eat KFC.     Rat  Is rat still batshit insane or have the others already cured her at that point?      implying we will have a healing ending  oh anon       Cock.  We'd play board games for awhile. Then I'd take her out to see the town, so I would have to princess carry her around for the day so she wouldn't walk anywhere.   We'd end up getting close, and I'd finally confess my feelings for her. We'd move in close for a kiss, but she'd suddenly trip, take three steps, forget who I was and fly away.       Gonna miss this desdes  I would "Eto" all of the Tamas, if you know what I mean.  That special was cute. Inu-tan x Key-tan OTP       dog  I'd commit a crime.      that thigh gap  I want some porking.      Those hips   That gap   The way her stockings make her thighs bulge a bit   I'd take her for a roll in the mud.        I will, just like i still remember eto-rangers. Gonna love them zodiacs.     Monkey  It would be a fun day, I would take her some nice places, see what she likes, invite her some tasty things, I bet she would want a banana split, the amusement park is mandatory to have more fun and get closer, then walk her back home holding hands, it wouldbe funny, I bet she wouldn't realize we are holding hands after some time have passed and then she would blush, so cute, and by the time we get home I would tell her how much I liked to spend all the day with her and then move close for a kiss, but just in the most important part of the night, Inu-tan would jump out of nowhere and surprise us, we would just burst out laugh and then say goodbye, then turn around and walk away while I hear Inu-tan asking her lots of things, but just in that moment, I heard someone running towards me, and get a surprise kiss on the cheek from Ki-tan, that said to me to see us again some other day.  Sorry for the bad english.       Cute.    If there are good doujins than the memory of Etotama will live on in my penis engine for years to come.    There won't be any doujins and you know it.    We don't know that. There might be one or two.      Well spank my cock and call me in the morning    I don't know about your cock, but I'd spank this cock    Just kidding, I'd spank yours too.      I [simple present form] [insert etoshin]   That's a nice cock, now check my cock having some pussy.   Remove [insert etoshin]   Cow    Already been done  you monster     Ratshit, fuck that stupid whore    ratatats.    Suck cock     Breasts in picture   Ass in thumbnail   MAGIC      [insert etoshin animal]? More like [first half of etoshin animal name]Best.    [fetish] bait   best anything      I would serve her cheese    Snake   Mei-tan a cutest  A CUTEST     She truly is, but I doubt we get any screen time of her in the last episode, really, 12 episodes for this series was too little, for the least 24 to explore every Eto-shin more in deep, we just got sample test from all of them.   I want last episode to show whatever possessed Chu-tan spawned some sort of dark minion after Chu's downed  so the rest of the Etos can have an excuse to enter combat fully armed (Shima's nunchuck, Kii's staff etc) at last     I'm sorry, your picture distracted me to such a degree that all your words look like a jumbled up mess   I'm still waiting for the Onsen King to be the surprise final boss, ripping out Chuu-tan's Sol/Lull Seal and trying to give humanity a spot on the Zodiac.  It's revealed that he's actually a time traveler and was born on the year of the cat, but despises it because most people born on that year turn out to be assholes.    [insert etoshin] did nothing wrong.   Kii-tan and Inu-tan did nothing . Yes, they did nothing.    What?    COCK!    Are we ready for out true love to return?  Boar and Horse is best   I hope she stays ded     Snake  I'll probably spend the entire date trying to leech investment advice off her. I don't think I'll get very far romantically.     Snake is just odd, I like her but she never had enough time to be really show her troll.   But damn that body.      It would be impossible to tell if she was into you.   Welp, less that 12 hours for this wild ride to end. It's been fun.  Why do everything I like doesn't sell  Why the fuck am I getting these ISP ban messages when I haven't fucking done anything, I don't want to miss the last episode discussion   Never mind, all is well.  Have some hamsters as an apology for the out-of-discussion post     The final day is here, such misfortune.   Mei-tan  Why can't my parents have sex a year later or earlier. I want to be born under Monkey, and Horse is atleast fun to bully.        I can't decide between Shaa-tan and Shima-tan. They're both best, along with Kii-tan.     Shag a sheep   It's your last chance to make Moo-Tan respawn!   Finally! The last stitch, thanks.    there is no zodiac portal in my room     ribbons-colon-three  But there are four ribbons in that picture.     Five.     QUICK, SOMEONE ADD THIS TO PIC RELATED     You couldn't just let me shitpost in peace, huh?      Saved     THE LEGEND CONTINUES     Not looking in the right direction. Stop trying to force extra faces in to this image.    <br/>     Up, and to the left   Not the right direction   wat        I like this one better than     羊  She is absolutely not my type, but I have no malice for her and since she's such an friendly, positive girl, I suppose we could just spend the day agreeing on nice things and enjoying stuff. We would listen to an album, something bright and nice, like Pet Sounds (sequel album Zodiac Sounds when?) and drink coffee. We would smile and part ways and I would remember to keep in touch in case I needed medical advice.    I don't want it to be over     Tiger    We hit up a nice bar and grill and she drinks me under the table and has her way with me. WOO HOO!      Soon, my friends  Dancing when   They're... ehrm... cute. Yes. They're cute.   I guess. Probably cute.       Man is the real monster after all.     Etotama will be over in a few hours     With BD Vol 6.   which you'll buy, right? Right?      Tiger is sex, I bet she fucks like one.   I would buy it if it were released in the west to a reasonable price, bundled with other BDs.    She fucks like sex?    It will probably get localized. I've seen less popular things get localized. Pic related.  Don't expect any of the extra content though. I've heard that localized releases are usually bare-bones.       That's okay, I'm sure the full MV will be posted somewhere in the Internet soon   SeolLalBOBVEVO when       Ah, hamsters, aren't they cute?  Little rapist cannibals murdering each another and traumatizing little kids since Hamtaro       Shows skin   Becomes sexy instantly    That's just being a slut anon.       Unfortunately, we all know that she will return.   The CGI on the BDs is still 24fps right?  Wish they'd render these parts at 50 (TV standard) for the BDs.     ToraDora otp    you will never see another episode of Etotama after this week  Why live?   ufufu   Because there are other more enjoyable things to do. Etotama was just a mediocre show in the end. Enjoyable to some degree, but nothing to get sad over when it ends.   Perhaps some dedicated fan will one day make motion interpolation enhanced 1080p 60fps sequences of the show's CGI sequences and upload them on youtube.     2 hours until literal 'Let's mou ikkai'.  You guys ready?     Only if we see breast girls return.    This. Show started off somewhat amusing and just fell over itself when it tried becoming SUPER SERIOUS.   Why isn't there a bear eto musume?   Wish Watanabe did more porn, jesus christ.    okaeri     Jaa ne.     I just want more Mo~      This. And put Show By Rock up there beside it. What disappointing shows with a surprising amount of instantly loveable characters, and bland MCs.      it tried becoming super serious   implying it became serious       TRIED you moron, can't you read?      implying it ever tried       Ready for the finale?  So, why is Rat doing all this shit again?   Never.    I'm curious what a crocodile Eto-musume would look like. Doesn't sound like a workable concept.     something about her etotama being corrupted by negative feelings     I would think like Dora-tan concerning the tail with green hair or some shit like that     If japan can anthropomorphize a horseshoe crab and a cockroach they can make a crocodile eto-musume.     With crocodile hat?  That's true. I guess it can go those two's route and just have it look like a normal girl with giant crocodile on the back.       Hell, Paca-tan is just a (probably) white-haired girl wearing a parka that says 'Alpaca', how hard to make could a Croco-tan be?    Is desudesu shirt the only one sold out?  Original designs look pretty different.    Bottom right  ARE THOSE???     They are.     I'm glad they changed Shima tan to make her paw things into nunchucks   dat bottom right        What are they gonna do with all those unsold I ♥ Nya-tan shirts?      Nya-tan with slightly longer hair   muh dick       Just put them in the old clothes collection.     How much do the Uri-tan figures cost? That's the real question     Aye, seem so. She's surprisingly popular. There quite a few merchandise there.    Not only DEATH DEATH, but those little things next to the shirts are also running out on Uri.  Fantastic taste right there  dess dess        Uri-tan is an oldfag, of course she's popular    So, are you guys gotta make a stream when the new episode airs?   Those seem to be keychains. I want to buy all of them.   Why didn't they make dess dess the main heroine?   She's basically the deuteragonist, what with all the merch, screentime and  manga     It seemed like a good idea to make cat the main character at the time.   It could have worked. You just need good writers.      Eto-musume figures were planned as an annual line, starting with Uri-tan.   didn't work out, only Uri-tan is in circulation    Anime airs in 2015, 8 years after the idea for eto-musume was conceived   business model is complete shit, BDs release before anime even started airing on TV   Etotama is such a 'failed' series, I feel bad man.        Should they have made this a kids' show instead?   I really sometimes wonder how this kind of stuff comes about. It's not that one guy somewhere thought this was a good idea, it's that there surely must have been dozens of people that could have stopped it.     at least it'll be known for its kickass 3D  if in the future 3D is more prominent in anime I'll think of etotama as the stepping stone      Usual stream, right?  Soon will be time for sayonara and not matane  Starting   There was a trailer for an upcoming kids CGI anime series set in a typical fantasy world where a boy/lad, a strong guy, and a girl go on an adventure to fight a gorgon. Can't find it anymore on youtube, since I don't remember it's name, but it looked helluva lot more impressive than Etotama's choppy CGI.    Post stream please!       streaming anime        Forgot to optimize the canvas size.     Them  bird   feet   Cat is kill   noooo   Christ my connection is super laggy today, can't tell jack shit   How does tail work?    nooo     So  Nya-tan betrayed Chu-tan first.   I can't either, wonder if it's the stream or not.     More like Chu-tan is kill.    Wait wut  Fucking stream I swear, maybe I should wait for HS     DID RAT JUST MELT   Rat a cute.    I'd still love her even if she was a puddle    Yay, Chu-tan's fixed.   That was reveal in the clockwork arena scene,  apparently Cat strike first against Rat because Nya-tan want Chu-tan to finally rest, but Cat fucked up and only partially broke Chu-tan's etotama - making her go berserk with negative energy.         Is chu-tan gandalf     you where criminally underused and underdeveloped    I chuckled.    She still dress like a slut. A sluuuuuut.     let's just make her wear white   Oh come the fuck on.     And so  Nya-tan didn't get to join zodiac in the most anti-climatic way ever.  Oh, and,  Moo-tan's back.    SHE'S BACK.   Shirochu is cute   Season 2 confirmed.  S2? S2?  S2---------?!?!    Fuck, the lag literally skipped 80% of the whole anime.  Anyone can explain what exactly happened after the credits?      So Chu-tan became best gril?  WELL, THAT'S IT, GUYS. IT'S OVER. EVERYONE GO HOME.  See you later in the occasional "anime nobody watched" threads.     Truly an art.    cow return     anime nobody watched" threads  I think a lot of good shows this season are going to get dumped in there. Too much Danmachi and Kekkai Sensen taking up everyone's attention. Besides the other obvious franchise shit of course.      matanya   ;_;      It'll be fun to reminisce about Etotama with all the other shows in that category.    All I saw was a mysterious figure wrap in cape standing in a desert(?). I wonder if they had plan for season two or is this just the usual tease ending a few anime have.   Thank you!!    Thank you for all the Sol/Lull   See you again nya!!  And now I'm sad again. Fuck everything.        Can we all take a moment to appreciate how  SHIT  Takeru is and how much  better the show would have been without him    I wouldn't go that far.  As long as we replaced him with manga Takeru.     But he's literally Homuhomu    Manga Takeru would've taken all the spotlight and become best girl.   It's over ;-;    So you want all the other girls to get outshined by his and Uri-tan's banter? Oh and Paca-tan never.  ;_;       It ain't over till the fat lady sin-  Rat ED  FUCK     I checked http://etotama.com/story/ out of habit ;_;   It's not over until HS come out in about half an hour.     More love for the best etoshin.   So, Cat did literally everything wrong.  Sasuga      So what happened? Did the 60 day period end and Nya-tan get denied her Eto-shin pass?    Why is Tiger flipping me off?    Didn't mean to quoote.    You mean the ending?  Chu-tan tell Nya-tan that she can't give Nya-tan her seal because she want to stay as part of the Eto-shin and set thing right by protecting people again, this heartfelt declaration moved everyone (except Nya-tan) and everyone told Nya-tan that she's fine the way she is, being free from responsibility. Chu-tan then offer her hand to Nya-tan and said that they should protect humanity together again,  Nya-tan refuse.     So Cat was a bitch all along.    offer her hand  Oh MY     Cat really is the worst girl.    What?  pig is not. boar desu desu      So she isn't really a cat?    It's done in a comedic fashion, no mean intention.     refusing living a life of adventures with Chu-tan   Worst cat ever     They really put in effort in designing background.   Paca-tan never did become an Eto-shin   ONE JOB ONE FUCKING JOB      Not a life of adventures, I think it's something like the old arrangement we see in the flashback last episode. Chu-tan take control of the Eto-shin and protect Japan, Nya-tan fuck around across the world and hunt mythological monster.  There's amazing effort in the background during all the CG fights. Make me even sadder.      O KI NA WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA      I'm going to miss her.   I'm going to miss all the Etos. Even Nyaa-tan.    I hope the show doesn't flop hard    Hello time-traveling friend from April, the future is a bleak world indeed   Cow lives.   Very hard or just hard?   Owari da.   Very hard.    [HorribleSubs] Etotama - 12 [1080p].mkv  Take your time, it will last longer    subs in time  What the FUCK     upscales   Clearly CR knows what the people want.      Look, when I posted 720p wasn't out, okay?    And apparently what they want doesn't have anything to do with space and magical girls. ;_;      It's over ;_;      less combined sales than average madhouse show     Give rat a white color scheme because good now.   Fucking stupid     Now you know why Madhouse doesn't bother animating shit.    Oh gee I wonder which other show this season did just that    Daga didn't turn good, however.    He turned into semen while Rat turned into a semen  angel-in-a-dominatrix    NANIKORE  Moe~     Gets mini mo-tan as an 'obligatory' mascot character sidekick   best end             all this png    Chuu-tan suddenly became moe  What is this sorcery?    cat started rat downhall because she wanted to kagura senguu her  S2 WHEN?    Oh you'll like THIS then  Final update      Nyaa-tan's VA seems better at drawing than Chuu-tan's VA.    was there any doubt      wait the end cards are all done by their respective VAs?     My heart...   Ari Ozawa is surprisingly good. Mo-tan too.    Holy shit, that CG normal form Nya-tan look as good as any pretty form. Any request for webm or transparent?  Yes, you only noticed this now?    STEEL PIPE DA WRYYYYYYYYYY    ORAORAORAORAORAORAORAORA   Are there figs coming out for this?    Didn't turn into a loli  One job.    https://d.maxfile.ro/arlvbtjilj.web<wbr>m   audio version  </wbr>   Beautiful. Redeemed Chuu-tan is top tier.     Any request for webm or transparent?  Mo-tan popping out of Chu-tans ratatattits    So do we have Nya-tan fight against HOROSCOPE next season???????????  since ending has an english speaking eto-shin to help translation from japanese to english as the Horoscope is on the western side of the world.   Which Horoscope Pretty mode would you like to see?       Chuu-tan imitating Nya-tan, like in this  screencap    Scorpio and Leo    Did anyone grab the other eyecatch?    I want them to animate Aries-tan, I'm sure she'll be a sweet sheep who cares for everyone's health.  I even have a fanart of how she'd look like, original creation do not steal please        that hooded figure in the end  STOP TEASING ME LIKE THIS  WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO US      Chu-tan became quite alright. Nya-tan was amazing throughout. Mo-tan became a lovely minigirl who can travel with her love now. Inu and Kii-tan didn't get any focus until the end. Uri-tan still best best.  Now this is how you do a finale. Show by Rock should learn a thing or two from it.        In the end, I guess we got to see a  c atfight as the end fight.   Uri-tan wasn't the mastermind behind Chuu-tan's rampage   What a shame.      considering the fact they released the BDs early as fuck, that means they animated that shit way before without knowing how shitty of sales they were going to get.       Here.   Did you forgive her, /a/?   THE LEGEND OF DEATH-TAN CONTINUES   Welp, except for a minor error at the end, Probable Ending 1 GET    Somebody make Cock delicious brown cock.       Considering that they managed to keep themselves on time for the weekly episodes and has been keeping the CG pretty consistent, it's not surprising if they had all that shit done even before the season began.   I don't know, I'm busy laughing at her right now to even care.        Thank you.    She did nothing wrong. Rat thought cat wanted to break her etotama.     that rat tail    And here.  Well now that I know her reason, she's not a shiiit anymore. Still dress like a slut though.        It's just sad that they anticipated for a S2, so they animated a teaser  then they went and fucked themselves in the ass what with selling the BDs early        This is so adorable, thanks.    And can we even blame her? Nya-tan was like  Don't worry, I know enough medical shit for this heart surgery, I'm sure you'll be just FINE after I crush this thing inside of you     Fighting game when Racing game when    You know I never thought I say this but the CG fight between cat and rat was incredible. If this is the future of anime and we lose hand drawn, I don't even mind.    S2  never   What a shitty business model and what shitty taste Japan has.     Her boobs are distracting.   Might be because they are not moving.       Too bad.  I would've loved to see more of the characters' antics now that Chuu-tan is with them.  Also, do we have any idea who Takeru is other than being a fucking nuclear reactor for Sol/Lull who for some reason can into God-TV and even tell the manager to step aside? Not that I can care much about it though, I like seeing him stick around.         They did.  In 2007 and then never again ;_;      CG in anime won't survive if the people who animated Etotama goes jobless.  though, I doubt that will even be a problem, I'm sure the CG people behind the anime will have plenty of job openings.       It's not like Nya-tan was in the wrong. She just came up with a method to try to save Chu-tan.      inb4 they get jobs for non-anime shit cause it pays better     That 10/10 Toei high budget movie quality CG in the end   Holy fuck my dick.     made one of the best-selling CG movies in Japan just last year   going out of job     Fuck Cat in the bad sense Fuck Rat in the good sense   So, is this going to have a game or something?    the character models in the movie were slightly strange but fuck me if the CG wasn't the best I've ever seen     You're making it sound like they're newbies and not an established company that's been around for decades now.      in Japan   Hey, they made it through way outside Japan. It's fucking Doraemon.   We wish.          People like you don't deserve to watch Etotama.     bashing people for hating Rat now  You shut up, you don't deserve this episode     I wasn't hating Rat.    Anon, you need to read the other guy's comment better He was bashing cat. All he siad of Rat is that he wanted to fuck her     Christ my brain isn't working  You probably know what I was trying to say     This is a good series.   The CG people are the company behind the anime, the company do a lot of CG for movies and anime. It's probably why the CG quality is so high.    So Cat in the pooper and Rat in the vagoo?    I did. No one did anything wrong in this anime.    I just hope it won't discourage other studios from trying out non-fuckawful CGI. It's a real shame they released the BDs the way they did and it had such awful sales as a result of that + their shit taste.    I still hate Cat for ruining Piyo-tan's shogi game.     Cat didn't do anything wrong you idiot. In fact she saved Chu-tan. Twice.      this entire anime    Yea, the CGI was really impressive.    I wasn't trying to say people should hate Cat, I was just trying to say people shouldn't hate on Rat now but my brain slipped for a moment there    I didn't hate Rat. I called out that anon for saying he'd fuck Cat in the bad sense. She was amazing too.     Etotama CG &gt; Show by Rock CG  She won?  CatXRat CatXCow CatXHuman  Which one?       this episode  What the fuck did i just watch    I wonder how long it will take for this level of CG to become the standard for anime. It's rare to find CG this good.   I guess it was alright but Nya-tan was a terrible protagonist.  It would have been way better with manga Takeru or if each Eto-shin had gotten an actual dedicated episode instead of just being the sidekick of the week. At least the CG saved it every time.     CatxRat but catxcow is also good.     rat dubstep   Sasuga a shit girl       well right now I'm sure Etotama is the current standard for good CG.     Etotama CG will kill you with adrenaline rush SB69 CG will kill you with diabetes  and don't say furryshit because you know you felt it a little bit here      Other studios won't try such amounts of CGI because they don't have the experience for it, nor are they granted the budget to do so. Good CGI costs a fuck-ton of money.   Also, it's really funny to see westerners pretending to have better taste when the average /a/non's first reaction to watching shows with CGI like SB69 and Etotama is to freak out and scream about CGI killing 2D animation, or how this must be kiddy-shit ruining their weeabo-cartoon from nippon.      rrrabu  Muh dick    Of course, alone for the fact that it has one of the few usages of CGI that didn't give me cancer.    Rabbit  I would be in my glory.         dissing Camellia     This is disgusting.    The Takeru? Nope.    She did nothing wrong.    SbR CG wasn't too bad compared to how shit the show itself was, especially the ending. It had no tension, no drama, no feelings, no comfy and no liveliness comparible to Etotama's ending. How they fucked up so hard with it can probably only be explained by Bones not having an idea how to handle a show like that.       Poker face all day as she keep making puns. Would eat her curry though.     She would dress as an australian. The hat, boots and shitty accent and all      japanese VA trying to say 'crikey'   muh dick       How both shows would end were already figured out long time ago since they were quite obvious  Yet SB69 finale feels like shit while Etotama finale is amazing.      paizuri and double fisting  Too lewd. Way too lewd. And thank you for not getting rid of Chuu-tan's cleavage on her new clothes, Takeru.  by the way, we did have enough budget for normal mode CGI  I'll really miss this show ;_;      This show had a some weaker parts in the second half, but the finale was amazing after all.  My AOTS is Pleiades though, this one is second or third probably.       Looks like she really enjoyed her roll as Nya-tan  She must love throwing all those nyas in there.        How horrifying.  They really went all out with this final episode. It's great.     I think after this, we call all agree that  all girls  is best girl.   Dog  Would probably end up playing card games all night.       upscales meme in 2015  simbly ebic    Life sucks.  inb4 CG is officially the norm for anime inb4 threads in /a/ is plagued by "X anime best graphics"   ____ has better graphics   top kek ________ is shit at least _______ has ambient occlusion       Webm of the last scene fucking when?  Nya-tan was the perfect audience surrogate all along.  Her lines and expression perfectly sums it up.  It wasn't necessarily bad, it was sort of good even. But the last thing that the show leaves you with is a resounding:   "What?"         300 would be giving them a few extra.     they almost hid Uma-tan behind rat and cat   My sides if they actually did it       Ox  RUN AWAY  RUN FAR AWAY       Jesus christ this is disgusting. spoiler that shit.    I thought the same.   That would work, if we get a S2  ;_;        Damn, this hurts.    You one of those cursed people whose favorite shows end up with disastrous sales?  Get out of here you asshole, give us back budget for Season 2  ;_;       oi you saying somethin nasty bout my accent?      Uma-tan  Who?     Nyatan bouncing around chutan while spinning during their fight   Obligatory mention of all those big bouncy fat rat tats before the thread ends.   Would that be a still from the MV?  That might partly explain why they only gave a snippet, it had a white-Chu-tan spoiler.   That and hopeful advertisement for BD          Uma is now the new Akari~n     Who do you think that dark hooded figure was at the end then?  Dess dess     Good CG   It flops  I can't expect decent CG like this in the future.        nya-tan will never suddenly jump on your keyboard mid-vidya game and yell ohayou   why live     Jojo thread? Jojo thread.   Gay priest is here now.  Could Made In Heaven defeat D4C?     Sleep tight pupper   Why is Sutah Puratinam so cute ?   It's fast enough to dodge it and one shot johnny so yes.   /r/ing the Iggy/Jotaro "I yiff!" manga edit  please and thank you    I feel that no jojo thread is complete without Pucci_after.png now. Just thinking of the fact that there are anons who don't like gay priest and call it a dumb meme offends me greatly.    There's already a thread up you faggots. Jojofags are as bad as Narutofags.    Someone doesn't like Jojo? IT MUST BE THE WORK OF AN ENEMY STAND!    not as bad as your mum fags who keep trying to fuck my mom fuck off already   I found this:  http://www.kaga-create.co.jp/saki/i<wbr>ndex.html</wbr>    TOKI!

In some cases, utilitarianism is the best choice though.   It's impossible to please everyone so you might as well try to make as many happy as possible.   And one or two people mourning is nothing compared to the happiness of a whole city.         using "objectively" and an adjective in one sentence    Almost got me there.      Justify it however you want, it doesn't change the fact that you committed murder and thanks to how civilized society is, that makes you just as bad if not worse because you did it for revenge .    Utilitarianism is flawed. That's one of the big themes of the Fate series, right next to "What is a hero?" and it's fairly obvious, to boot.  In the end, a person should do the things that they'll be able to live with doing. Heroism is its own reward, and if the reward isn't enough to allay the costs, then you end up like Archer or Arturia.  If a serial killer is threatening your town, and you have an opportunity to stop them, that judgment call that comes with tough choices kicks in. You decide for yourself, and not for "the greater good" or "the benefit of the majority" what you want to do.         So a cop who killed a criminal to save an innocent person's life can never be considered a good person, ever? Oh boy.   I love comic book superheroes, but the harsh truth is that they hold unreal standards of morals that are impossible to meet in real life.     Osananajimi wa Onnanoko ni Naare anime announced      So, is this gay?  I could see this being released as a short series or something.   It's cute,  but so, so unambiguously gay.    What did you think of the chapter?  boring shit, filler tier villain  I don't know why ss fags are happy about this, their happy family headcanons crushed over a gaiden that is completely pointless    SS is going to be canon   we already knew that, ss fag        I just don't understand what was the purpose of this.   Nothing happened, we know Sarada does shit in the movie. Kishi has to close it and may ruin a perfectly tasty waifu when he does.    nardo GT is still a shonen, and Kishi can at most only show shadow clones trading punches, not nardo slaughtering hundreds of children in one go.    to troll the ss haterzzz </blockquote>]
