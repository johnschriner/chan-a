[ What are you hoping for in tomorrows chapter?  1st fo there's at least 3 years of Buriichu  <br>reposting this to get people talking<br><br>'<br>ichibe called him a human. hes the reios son. reio had a tryst with a human female. note how the RG were not so much guarding as waiting on reio. hikifunes food, kirinjis cleanliness, ichibes teachings and oetsus self defence. it seems yhwach got too big for his boots and created a race of his own and that pissed off the shinigami. then they had to imprison reio. remember we saw him waking up. and then the next we see he is in pieces and encased in crystal. also hikifune said that the reiatsu cage she created was the biggest she had created for some time. they imprisoned reio. and back to the yhwach thing - he was fucking up the balance they had created through reios imprisonment so he had to go. yama couldnt kill him though. he fucked him up but only to the extent that yhwh was in a ba(b)by form. yama has shown (with wonderweiss) that he couldnt kill a child. this shows hes capable of massacring enemies but not children<br>'</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'll post some crack theories from around the net.<br><br>'I think it's possible that Tenjiro Kirinji of the Royal Gaurd keeps his Zanpakuto in his pompadour, which is why it has an odd hooked shape at the end. Also, in a chapter sketch in Volume 58 at the end of Chapter 519, it was stated that his pompadour can support a weight of 120 kg. Now why would that information be important?'</br></br></br>  <br>He punched Wonderweiss to dust dude.</br>  <br>After WW turned into a monster. Yama said 'im glad you no longer resemble a child, now i can kill you.'</br>  <br>heres the page. yhwach told him he's gone soft. he said yamas heart opened and he loved the peace and his two students. i think he honestly couldnt bring himself to kill a child yhwach. thats probably how kubo is gonna juxtapose it - a guy powerful enough to reduce SS to ashes, yet wont kill a child.</br>  <br><br>See that look of sadness in the bottom left panel? note what mayuri said ' you could not kill that man 1000years ago'. I think that the bloodthirsty leader of the gotei showed mercy.</br></br>  The 4 senior captains in Gotei - considered to be Yamamoto/Unohana/Ukitake/Kyoraku - can be compared to the Four Humors of the Body. The humors are based on the medieval medicine in which a person needs to have an equal amount of black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood in his or her body for optimal health. A doctor might reduce an aspect when there is an imbalance through unusual means such as bloodletting. Another example, a man suffering from excessive yellow bile is required to stay away from fire or hot, dry air. This notion of having 4 humors with attributed temperaments was derived from the ideas of philosophers like Aristotle, Hippocrates, and Galen, and even from Pre-Islamic concepts in Akhlaat, so there are certainly characteristics of the 4 classical elements too (air – Anaximenes; water – Thales; earth – Xenophanes; fire - Heraclitus). Of course, I’m sure most of you are familiar that these elements are related in the Chinese and Japanese concepts as well, skimming this thread.<br><br>The 4 humors are black bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. Each humor has its own psychological effects and related organs:</br></br>  <br><br>Blood; heart/liver (sanguine – air) – associated with Kyoraku; excessive blood was understood to have caused cheerfulness, optimism, and affection, which are something the 8th division captain mostly exhibit. Blood transport nutrients and important in cell metabolism, and has an attractive force that binds cellular parts due to need. Kyoraku incidentally have a wind-like shikai ability seen in bushougoma. His bankai presumably has an “attractive” force that includes other spectators even if they don’t want to participate; it’s required.<br><br>Phlegm; brain, lungs (to some extent) (phlegmatic – water) – associated with Ukitake; excessive phlegm was understood to have caused passivity, devotion, or sentimentality. Phlegm consists of all the fluids in our body, functioning as an expulsive force, which nourishes, cleanses, and protects many organs from friction caused by movements, for instance. Also, Ukitake’s devotion about protecting the pride of Kaien Shiba inevitably led to his lieutenant’s death. Maybe Mimihagi-sama’s “expulsion” from Ukitake’s body represents a “cleansing” and lead to his eventual recovery like Kubo said in the interview.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yellow bile; gallbladder (choleric – fire) – associated with Yamamoto; excessive yellow bile was understood to have caused aggression and violence. Yamamoto’s zanpakuto is a literal fire and he is known to harbor rage at rule breakers, compelled by a driving need to lead as the captain commander. Attributes of a choleric person include high ambition, boldness, short-temperedness, and passion. Yellow bile is thought to have a digestive force, which is an integral, catalyst function of many processes in the GI tract. It can symbolize Yamamoto as a central figure of directing orders based on his position as the top executive in Soul Society.<br><br>Black bile; spleen/bones (melancholic – earth) – associated with Unohana; excessive black bile was understood to have caused melancholic or sad temperament and is also believed to be a component of blood as a sediment; Unohana is the best healer of the Divisions and appropriately enough, black bile has a retentive force that can solidify or coagulate blood for clotting and thus promote new formation of body structures, either benign or malignant (can be toxic).</br></br></br>   yfw Yhwach raided the maggots nest for more soldiers willing to fight the gotei. <br><br> yfw kyoraku is called spring spring in the chapter he met chad - Spring being a euphemism in chinese for male orgasm </br></br>  <br>And?</br>  <br>He would've done it anyway if he really had to. Just like he would've sacrificed all the Gotei if he had to.</br>  <br><br><br>Interesting, but I doubt that Kubo has thought of it that far.</br></br></br>  <br>just posting it. form your own opinions and theories.<br><br><br>the gotei are adults. not babies. he even said they are all prepared to die for the cause.<br><br><br> underestimating kubo <br>you dont get 600chapters written without inspiration.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Are you prepared for feels tomorrow?  yfw Mimihagi works the same way as Yhwach, albeit in a fairer way. It takes just an organ. yhwach goes the whole hog and takes the soul. He absorbs power in the same way ichigo does. for example when ichigo was meant to get half of rukias power yet abosrobed the fucking lot of it.  <br>Ichigo gives power too. He gave Chad and Orihime their powers.</br>  <br>They are so cute</br>  <br>He does albeit unconsciously thanks to the hogyoku</br>  Amazingly powerful God split into pieces and scattered about?<br><br>We Osiris now.<br><br><br>siris is the mythological father of the god Horus, whose conception is described in the Osiris myth, a central myth in ancient Egyptian belief. The myth described Osiris as having been killed by his brother Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. Isis joined the fragmented pieces of Osiris, but the only body part missing was the phallus. Isis fashioned a golden phallus, and briefly brought Osiris back to life by use of a spell that she learned from her father. This spell gave her time to become pregnant by Osiris before he again died. Isis later gave birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the evil Set.</br></br></br></br></br>  Who the fuck does/did Sōkyoku belong to? Its clearly a zanpakuto. A zanpakuto requires an owner.  <br>The Soul of SS</br>  <br>wat</br>  On this page Bach says ''my father'' as he stabs the Soul King. However, the page includes just Ichibei and Ichigo. Could this have a deeper meaning?<br><br>It could potentially mean the following: Ichibei and Ichigo are related to the Soul King aswell.<br><br>These are the facts:<br><br>1) The Soul King is the father of Bach<br>2) Bach is the creator of the Quincy<br>3) Ichigo is part Quincy<br>4) Ichibei is the head of the Royal Guard<br><br>This means that the first three are related anyhow. Bach even called Ichigo ''My son born in the darkness''. I'm not saying that I interpreted it in a literal sense, but Ichigo is such a special being that I think it's not stupid to think that he'd be related to the Soul King. To add to this, the Soul King has apparently fallen for Ichigo as stated by Kirinji. <br><br>In what way Ichibei fits in here, I don't know. You could say that all Shinigami are related to the Soul King in a sense, but I think there's more than that between Ichibei and the Soul King. After all, he's the most prominent member of the Royal Guard and has a - personal - history with Bach.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ichibei did state the following when he explained to Ichigo how he resurrected after being blown to pieces by Bach: ''Given both our powers, it's actually a logical conclusion''. This suggests that their respective powers are able to connect in a specific sense. I definitely think that Kubo will explain this in further detail later on. It might be in a flashback or if Ichigo learns more about his himself and powers up again, which could very well happen.<br><br>Or the quote by Bach and the background including Ichibei and Ichigo have no relation at all, deeming this my post useless. It just caught my interest and thought I'd share it with you people. Just some food for thought.</br></br></br>  Would you eat her bread?  <br>Remember how Ichigo, during the fight with Ulquiorra, died. However, his soul - for lack of a better word/knowledge - remained alive and he was able to hear Orihime and speak to himself. Similarly to Ichibei being dead while still being able to call Ichigo and resurrect himself. Their powers obviously have a connection, as stated by Ichibei himself. <br><br>Ichibei could take from Ichigo. He took a part of his power/soul and in doing so was able to restore himself. Following this logic, Ichigo took a part of Orihime's power/soul when she screamed his name. This would make Orihime another person sharing the same power as Ichibei and Ichigo, which isn't far fetched as she has god-like powers. <br><br>Does it ring a bell? Bach was the baby who could distribute his soul. It sounds similar to the scenario's of Ichibei, Ichigo and Orihime. Ichigo having this power could explain why his human classmates have become sentient beings - because they unconsciously took powers from Ichigo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also, remember how Bach summoned his sword from the sky, during the fight with Yamamoto. It landed on the ground infront of him and Bach grabbed hold of it. Similarly to Ichigo's encounter with Bach, where he dropped his sword from the sky, landing infront of him and grabbing it. This parallel could suggest that they share the same power.<br><br>Moreover, we know that the Bach from a thousand years ago resides within Ichigo. This could suggest a deep connection. You could say that it's just the manifestation of his Quincy powers and nothing special, but in that case every other person with Quincy powers should have the Bach from a thousand years ago residing within them. I very much doubt that this is the case. So why Ichigo? Why specifically the Bach from a thousand years ago? I hope this question gets answered by Kubo.</br></br></br>  <br>I expect it to suck. As per usual.</br>  <br><br> it sucks so much i read it every week </br></br>  <br>Every day</br>  <br>just for u faget<br><br>Orihime is an avatar of the Soul King. This is a half-formed truth awaiting some more evidence but I wanted to post it here for the "I told you so" if it comes true.<br><br>Similar to the relationship between Bach and Hashwalt, she is "awake" when the King sleeps and vice versa. The King probably uses this as an escape from the tedium of being the lynchpin of all existence for eternity.<br><br>Clues/internal consistencies:<br>- The King seemingly woke up during the crisis, but is asleep again. Why would he go to sleep and end up getting stabbed by Bach? It must be involuntary. This is consistent with the idea that when Orihime awakens, he is forced into slumber.<br><br>- Aizen said there is no one sitting on the throne of heaven. This implies the King spends a lot of time sleeping.<br><br>- Aizen also said Orihime's power infringes on the territory of god.<br><br>- Orihime professed her love for Ichigo. According to the Royal Guard, the King is also in love with Ichigo. I thought this was a joke, or that the kind was eccentric at first, but it factors nicely into this...<br><br>- When Orihime said (or implied) she loved Ichigo, she also said something about wishing she could have 5 lives - to be born in 5 different towns, eat 5 different kinds of food...and fall in love with the same person 5 times. This gives you a reincarnation vibe right away, and it is also interesting in that the number 5 seems to be significant in Bleach. 5 special war potentials. 5 royal guard. 5 cities. 5 noble houses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 2) Bach is the creator of the Quincy <br>Do we actually know this<br><br><br>Why not? It's free.<br><br><br>Ichigo can take powers from people, but it doesn't necessarily mean that Orihime has that same power.<br><br><br>Ichigo is just special to begin with, that's why Bach chose to manifest inside. As for glasses Bach being the one inside him, it could be because he had foreseen the future during that time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The existence of trueborn and converted Quincies was confirmed recently, but hinted at throughout the arc. It comes as no surprise that Ichigo and Uryu who were both descended from the Quincy leader clan are trueborn Quincies.<br>Furthermore Yhwach being the king's son and the king being imprisoned against his will is also no surprise. What comes as a surprise is the fact that the first generations of Quincy "trueborns" were supposedly defective. Yhwach had to build himself up from scratch, while Jugo had no talent whatsoever as a Quincy. Hopefully we will learn more about Jugo and Yhwach's relationship in the next chapter.<br><br>Speaking of which, netabare (fake) spoilers are out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the King is also in love with Ichigo. I thought this was a joke, or that the kind was eccentric at first, but it factors nicely into this <br>I don't think the actual Japanese said this.</br></br>  <br>It just said that the king was anxious to see him, but the royal guard never let Ichigo and SK meet.</br>  Fake spoilers say that Yhwach only exists in the minds of those who he has personally chosen.<br>Chosen for what, I can't say.</br>  <br>him</br>    <br>Yama. Spoilers: The name of Soukyoku implies that it has a twin.</br>  <br>Nope. It was "no wonder the king is enamoured of him" (Ichigo that is).</br>  Which translation of Bleach 514 is correct, the one where Yhwach calls Ichigo a trueborn, or the one where he says that he should not have used a trueborn Quincy to hinder Ichigo from reaching SS?  <br>check mangahelpers</br>  <br>I am checking. BadKarma usually posts the Japanese script as well so that helps. I trust BK more than I trust cnet and BK is the one who translated that sentence as Ichigo being the trueborn, not Quilge. Either way the implication is that trueborns are "genuine" Quincies, while converts are fakes and imitations.</br>  <br>BadKarma<br> Tenjirou：・・・霊王サマが <br> …I can see why the Spirit King’s <br> Tenjirou：惚れンのもわからア <br> Head over heels for him </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't take it literally though.

We might even see the original Gotei.</br>  Remind that technically Ichigo lost against Aizen when he lost his shinigami powers.<br><br>Aizen is still the most OP shit ever.</br></br>  <br>Yes, Kisuke is the one who technically beat Aizen. But it goes without saying that it couldn't be done without Ichigo, and Gin also played an important role.</br>  <br> Wow, it took all 3 of you to beat me. Wooooooow </br>  <br> gg no re </br>  <br><br>You should read a modern American superhero comic. They often make Bleach and shonen like it look like the opposite of fanwank-op-bullshit-marysue-skirtsw<wbr>hogivesafuckaboutconsistency-skirts<wbr>withrealitywarping buttfuckery. Even Yhwach is a fair and balanced villain in comparison.</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>I meant within the Bleachverse, Pre-Mugetsu'd Aizen was the most powerful being, only beaten by Post-Dangai Ichigo at the cost of all his power, but even then, if it had been a fair 1v1, Ichigo would've lost.</br>  <br>You're strictly referring to pre-Timeskip, right?</br>  <br>Not really no, I don't think anyone has come close to the powerlevels we saw with Ichigo and Aizen.</br>  <br><br>SK-Yhwach probly in their league.</br></br>  <br>Well, we haven't seen him do anything except send those black creature after everyone in SS. But yeah, he's at least as strong as them. I'd be disappointed if he wasn't.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Aizen was never beaten. He's immortal and potentially the strongest living thing ever in Bleach.<br><br>Yhwach would get destroyed even with his all mighty and soul king powers. Aizen is the closest thing to a God Bleach has. Not even the Soul King was immortal.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He rebuilt the Soul King palace and the cities that were guarded by the RG.<br><br>He's a god now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aizen was never beaten. <br>He was beaten though, he just wasn't killed. He had a goal he set out to do and was stopped and imprisoned. If Cpt Eyepatch didn't go down their, he probably would've rotted their for all eternity.</br></br>  <br><br> Yhwach is a God <br><br>no he's not. Soul King's not a God either, as he is mortal. Naturally you can't kill a God. Deicide is a fallacy. God's are not mortal. Even in death they are still alive. Soul King got cucked, he's exactly that, just a king, an architect if you will.<br><br>Yhwach is going to get cucked too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Aizen was shown to be walking around freely and loose inside the muken <br> Just two years after his jail he was basically free to his own devices inside there <br> Two years <br> Rot for all eternity <br><br>I hope you're joking right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually ALL of the Muken prisioners or at least the ones that were locked up in the same level as Aizen are immortal.</br></br>  <br><br>That shouldn't have been taken literally. <br><br>Doesn't make any sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Soi Fon <br> chest tumors <br>Just no.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They cant be killed, therefore immortal.</br></br>  <br><br>kek, and pray tell explain to me how this happens?<br><br>"oh shit im immortal lel KEK XD"<br><br>Pls kill yourself. Hougyoku was the first of its kind, and is already bullshit to explain immortality. Kubo's bullshit doesn't fit into the lore or mythos at all if true. 1000 years ago Soul Society and everyone else were complete utter morons and brutes. there weren't just immortal people flying around. Wait, I'm reading too much into this. Bleach is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You really can't get edgier than that.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see your point. He was still trapped in the muken. He only freed his ankles and his left eye after Shunsui has unlocked his mouth.</br>  <br>There was that previous transcendent captain and hollows from the novels. So maybe others have breached the threshold and get locked up for it</br>  <br><br> Man with an obviously working wish granting gem that gave him immortality is apparently stuck in another dimension <br><br>God people are so fucking stupid. You still don't understand Aizen's character? You probably think he's going to be stuck to the chair for the rest of the manga too. These threads are filled with absolute retards. Bring back LM and Lon at least they use their brain.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Man with an obviously working wish granting gem that gave him immortality is apparently stuck in another dimension <br><br>Hogyouku rejected him, and while it cannot take make the immortality it already gave Aizen, it won't do much else for him.</br></br></br>  <br><br> It won't do much else for him <br><br>Holy shit go back and reread the manga. Even Urahara says Aizen has further evolved from his previous being into something greater and more powerful. He's a literal walking GOD now, more of a God than anything else in the manga.<br><br> Replying to a cuck who doesn't read the manga <br><br>I'm the cuck</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LoN <br>woah bro, now you're going too far</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say that he's a god, he's stuck somewhere in between and likely won't go much further. I also don't believe that gotei scrubs who couldn't land so much as a scratch on him are fit to judge how powerful he is now compared to before. He's a different kind of power user, if that makes sense to you. Incarnate power user, someone who doesn't use a proxy like a shinigami, or a fullbringer.</br>  These are the best moments in Bleach. Prove me wrong.<br>Protip:  You can't because taste is subjective. </br>  <br> best moments <br> nemu <br>great taste friend</br></br></br>  <br><br>He's closer to a God than anything else in Bleach.<br><br>Kubo also personally identifies him as a God, figuratively or not.<br><br> Deicide <br> God is dead <br> Return of the God <br><br>Yhwach and Soul King have never been correlated with God before. You could say "Yhwach" is a reference to God, and his almighty power are though, but he's clearly mortal, and just has OP hax powers just for the sake of it. but he's not a god.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>yet another great moment</br>  Still no spoilers?  <br>To say that Yhwach is mortal is too much of a stretch, that man is well over 1000 years old, has high speed passive regen and according to Yama he is extremely difficult to kill.<br>If Kubo identifies him as a god then it must be because that is Aizen's aspiration and how he carries himself. SK and Yhwach both have powers of creation and destruction unlike anything else seen so far in Bleach. They are quite literally what keeps the universe together. Aizen is powerful yes, but ultimately Ichigo is stronger and has much higher potential than he does. Adding insult to injury Ichigo is a descendant of the two beings Aizen aspired to become like and shows signs that he may have the same powers. Aizen is someone who will always crave the highest seat of power, but never be in possession of it. This is what his character song is about, being drawn as a moth to a flame and then burning while regreting his life in agony as he is tortured to death. Aizen becoming immortal is a worse punishment than anything the gotei could've thrown at him.<br>He will play second fiddle to the SK, Yhwach and finally Ichigo for all eternity.<br>If the gotei are smart they'll cut down Yhwach and transfer his powers to Aizen, then seal Aizen as the lynchpin of the worlds. That way he will get exactly what he wants, but in a cruel twist of fate he'll still be a prisoner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Spoilers:<br><br> Nothing happens. Nothing happens.

It's obvious as fuck where you from, faggot.</br>  <br>ur so funny lol<br><br>pls share more joke.<br><br>Also, kindly fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Their gaiden is over. That means more cancer in owr threads</br>  <br> Ichigo is stronger <br>Not even at his fullest he was able to win.</br></br>  <br>I think Aizen gets free and takes over the Royal Realm.<br>It's implied that Kyoraku plans to make Ichigo into the new lynchpin and Ichigo seems to be the the true successor to the Soul King.</br></br>  <br>This, I believe Aizen will be like the Hao of Bleach. He is just going to win but in the end he isn't going to do shit.</br>  <br>Ichigo trashed Aizen to the point that he regressed in his evolution and that was after saying fuck it and just blasting him in the face with his final attack. If he becomes aware of his own ability and starts using his powers with a bit more brains Aizen won't stand a chance.</br>  <br>Their cancer spread to these threads months ago anon. Tumblr is here too.</br>  <br>here's another one:<br><br>Why didn't Ichigo cross the road?<br><br>Cause  NOTHING EVER HAPPENS IN BLEACH </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's okay and I at least owe it to this series to finish it.</br>  <br>Don't fucking remind me. I had an idiot claiming that head pats are rape, patriarchy and oppression the other day. Euthenasia is the only thing that works with those subhumans, or at the very least they should be neutered so that they don't get to spread their dumbass genes.</br>  <br>Do the math, if not even his strongest attack that required him to lose all his powers could do shit, what else could he ever do?</br>  <br>Ichigo didn't technically win though, even after sacrificing his powers, Aizen still stood up could've easily killed Ichigo since Aizen had only regressed while Ichigo was almost out cold. Ichigo also realized that if he kept the fight with Aizen, he'd only be getting stronger from that point, so he had to finish it in one blow before he go too strong.</br>  <br>Dark times.</br>  Spoilers are out, it is confirmed that Jugo has Yhwach's ability and he has been absorbing the powers of those around him to grow stronger.  <br>It's ok, consensual sex in the missionary position for the sole purpose of procreation with the lights off under the cover is literally rape to them, they won't ever breed.</br>  <br>My cute little parasite jugo</br>  <br>At the very least he's got the absobtion part of Yhwach's powers down, if not the distribution part of it. Kubo hasn't contradicted himself yet, this may be a common trait of all trueborns. Quilge may have done it with his sklaverei, possibly Uryu too, Ichigo has done it as well.</br>  Fuck off already, shounen isn't alowed on /a/ anymore.<br><br><br>so how long for translate? 4-5 hours?</br></br></br>  <br>Far less, dadruto and one piece are both out. Bleach will be out any minute now.</br>  <br>I want to know if the reason Jugo wasn't able to use quincy powers was because he was only awake when Bach was awake, and slept when Bach slept.</br>  <br>I want this flashback to end or at least tell us something useful or interesting. This flashback has been a complete waste of time so far, about 2 characters I don't give a shit about.</br>  Please tell me this chapter isn't just Hasch in a room practicing his powers.  <br>It's got nothing to do with that, he was just born powerless like his father and since he was never around someone whose powers he could steal he remained weak and powerless for most his life. However in the last 5 years he has been leeching off Bazz and growing stronger and his own powers are starting to awaken. I don't think Yhwach has divided his personalities yet.<br><br>It ended and we learned more about the truebloods and Jugo's past.</br></br></br>  <br>At least an hour from now</br>  IT'S  NOT  OUT!!  <br>But jugo is important to the plot.</br>  <br>Where the fuck do the Quincy live besides some weird feudal land? Is that just what Kubo thinks Germany is like?</br>  <br>Still ichigo post dangai transcend all other character in the series, is far the strongest character in bleach and is a shame he will never be as strong as he was, fuck he destroyed the black coffin who tears space and time aka black hole with fucking bare hands reshaping the landscape with swings of his sword and in a upper dimension where not even venom aizen could felt his reiatsu fuck kubo</br>  <br>How long do you think it will be before Aizen is free of his extremely sturdy chair?</br>  <br>No, I'm pretty sure that's what Germany's like.</br>  <br>Not too long I hope. I want to see an all out battle between all the godly beings</br>  <br>Dude, that shit took place over 1000 years ago. That is indeed how middle age Europe looked. Well maybe the Quincies were a bit ahead of their time, but they have super special powers so I let it slide. Quincies lived all over the earth since Yhwach conquered all of the civilized world during his day.</br>  <br>Where are the hollows and humans</br>  <br>I think he is just waiting to say all according to keikaku, but we can see he is still in a third dimension because disintegrate people with his presence so is at least butterfly level, I just hope ichigo go fourth dimension again <br><br>Again fuck kubo</br></br></br>  <br>They're around, they're just not the focus of this flashback.</br>  <br>No one really knows where the hell this is taking place yet. One popular theory is that its actually HM and the war is what turned it into a desert.<br><br>Could also be earth, with the shinigami using their memory manipulation tech to wipe Yhwach's empire out of history. Or it could be another area of soul society.</br></br></br>  Where does Ichigo Rank in the Manga? His strongest form couldn't even defeat Azien. ( If it wasn't for Urahara Ichigo would be dead )<br><br><br>Yamamoto, Baragan, Azien, Ichibe, Bach are clearly stronger than him but what about people like Shunsui? Unohana? Urahara? Mayuri?</br></br></br>  <br>I thought the flashback was taking place in the quincy world, if it had taken place in the real world, pretty sure Ichigo would've heard of some great military emperor king thing that conquerored everything 1000 years ago named Ywach.</br>  <br>Fuck. I want to see old man yama nuke some quincy ass.</br>  <br>Most likely he has, but how well did you pay attention in history classes? The Quincy world was only inhabited after the Quincies died in the war 1000 years ago.</br>  Bampu  TROUT  <br> couldn't even defeat Aizen <br>You say that like butterflaizen was weak. Being able to fuck up his body is impressive enough considering he can't die and most characters can't even touch him. And Barragan isn't strong enough to be listed with the likes of Yhwach or Ichibei. He's broken at HIS tier but the really high tiers have enough raw power or bullshit tricks to smash his face in harder than Soifon's bankai. Current Ichigo could probably getsuga spam him to death.<br><br> Shunsui <br>Ichigo has more strength, Shunsui has more hax. Could go either way depending on how well he plays the games.<br> Unohana <br>She lost to Kenpachi and Ichigo is similar or beyond him. Could also go either way, but I'd bet on Ichigo.<br> Urahara Mayuri <br>Stronger than Urahara, way stronger than Mayuri. They'd still drug the hell out of him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Looks like that's the end for Buzz-B. Haschwalth sure is stronger than I expected. He barely even break a sweat.  Sure is a petty reason for buzz-b to be so angry at <br>Haschwalth.</br>  so bazz is dead.. whoopdedoo who even cared..  <br>Believe it or not. He actually has some fans.</br>  <br><br>Unohana killed Kenpachi and resurrected him like a 1000times</br></br>  Shota Toofsy is adorable.  <br>He's got every right to be angry, maybe not at Jugo though. Definitely a case of misdirected anger.</br>  <br>those 2 or 3 faggots who are fan of every same face cannon fodder character can fuck off aswell.<br><br>this was a really shit chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>Well obviously kubo cares about all his characters including the bad guys.</br>  So we learned that every once in a while mini-ywach's are born. We can probably say that Ishida is one as well. Maybe Ichigo but that'd be really weird since they're supposed to be rare as shit. I want to know how Ywach knew his name tho.  Don't fucking die, Based-B! This is just a scratch, reveal Ranso Tengai!  <br>I am more interested on who will defeat Haschwalth. Probably ichigo.</br>  So I guess in addition to the arrows and stuff, Quincy were supernaturally advanced in the field of fashion?  <br>Ishida</br>  <br>Ichigo really need a real fight in this arc.</br>  <br>Reminder that aizen is a three dimensional being who can't be touched with bare hand in risk to be disintegrated by his presence and can make black holes who tear time and space and the first thing that ichigo made to him was BTFO him hard just by touching him and fly miles away from a city in an instant just by jumping and destroyed a black hole with bare hands, and a even stronger aizen(venom) couldn't feel this reiatsu so that made him a dimension above <br><br><br> Reminder that ichigo will never be this strong again, and any other character in almost any anime will lost to him just because they can't see or touching him </br></br></br></br>  SO WAS ICHIGO GIVING POWERS TO THEIR FRIENDS THROUGH HIS INNER YAWACH,  or even by himself  AND NOT BY THE HYOUGOKU BEING IN RUKIA AND NEAR THEM LIKE AIZEN THOUGHT?!<br><br>MAYBE IT WAS ISHIDA?</br></br>  <br>Nice 5's.<br><br>Also it's obvious that Ichigo is one such quincy. He's not only never been shown using or having an aptitude for any kind of quincy power, but he's "shared" his power in that Orihime and Chad got their powers from hanging around Ichigo. It's also implied Tatsuki got some kind of buff as well since she can see Shinigami. There's also the fact that the people who hang around Ichigo in general keep getting stronger, as does he.</br></br></br>  PLEASE KUBO DON'T KILL BAZZ-B  <br>That was while he was still gimping himself. The whole point of that fight is that he's absolutely stronger than her once he gets his brain problems sorted out.</br>  <br> MAYBE IT WAS ISHIDA? <br>Aw shit<br>That's why YHWH picked him</br></br></br>  <br>He's like Rukia male version.</br>  <br>I guess it makes sense a bit, would also explain how Chad got hollow powers.</br>  <br>Maybe Ishida and Ichigo snowballed their powers between themselves.</br>  <br>yawach called haschwald his other half, but with ishida he was just surprised he didn't died when he recalled all his soul fragments. so ishida is probably different.</br>  <br>Ishida doesn't have hollow power to share, makes more sense to have Ichigo share his powers with everyone around him.</br>  <br> wind can make fire stronger <br><br> oh shit no </br></br></br>  <br>Is Ginjo another such Quincy?</br>  <br>haschwalth will be good guy like Gin and will die by black goo hitler</br>  <br>Nah, Ginjou takes power, he doesn't give it. Ichigo's explicitly been called out as unconsciously giving Chad and Orihime powers, similar to Toofsy and Bazz.</br>  <br>Ginjo can only take and share full bring power to share with other fullbringers because of his shinigami status. <br><br>Wait, fuck. What does this mean?</br></br></br>  <br>He literally gave it to the rest of the fullbringers nigga.</br>  <br><br>Amazing. So...Orihime has some Quincy stuff going on then?</br></br>  <br>But that's forbidden love!</br>  <br>Oh yeah, you're right. Sorry, it's late.<br><br>...Fuck, maybe he is? The whole power sharing thing happens a lot. Ginjou's power sounds a lot more like Yhwach though, in that he takes power, refines it, and gives it to others.</br></br></br>  I wanna say that if hollows are the antithesis to shinigami, then fullbringers are the antithesis to quincy.  Reminder that Yukio no longer has the powered up version of invaders must die, and neither did Riruka. <br><br>What does this all mean?</br></br>  So if it switch then it's different Bazz-B? Take your own advice.<br><br>Back to Liltotto.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't that the Hogyoku?</br>   Did you honestly think it was your own power? <br>How often is Kubo going to use this phrase?</br>  Look at Yawach being all overconfident with his eyes open all the time and shit.<br><br>I'm sad this flashback is over. I want to see the war of 1000 years ago.</br></br>   yfw chad and orihime are ichigos star knights   <br> I want to see the war of 1000 years ago. <br>Rape isn't something you can show on Jump.</br></br>  <br>So all this time Ichigo was sucking his oponents' powers? What about Yumichika then</br>  <br> Back to Liltotto. <br>I don't normally get attached to Bleach girls, but wow<br><br>Every panel... wow<br><br>She's hard as fuck</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thry are his shields</br>  I just tapped into my inner kubo jugo gives ichigo or ishida the power to fight ywach as he dies.<br><br>possible another tag team ichigo ishida fight.</br></br>  <br>Nono, Ichigo was giving powers to his friends.<br><br>I suspect Ishida and Ichigo probably form the new generation of the giver and taker pair with Ichigo being the giver and Ishida the taker.<br><br>And only after writing this do I realize that I sound like a Fujoshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to protect that frown<br><br>i hated her when she was a smiling, foul-mouthed bitch</br></br></br>  <br> I want to see the war of 1000 years ago. <br>200 years ago seems like it would be more interesting</br></br>  As soon as he finds out he's a little special he betrays his based best friend like that. Fuck this guy. <br><br> Forgive me for using magapanda </br></br>  <br>What?<br><br><br>Hard?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta make up for Masaki and Ryuken never getting married.<br><br><br>That's exactly what happened the first time they met.<br>Uryu fired off so many shots with Ichigo's power inside him, he started bleeding.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Foolishness</br>  <br>That's because he's jealous of B's ability. He even made fun of him before that page by saying "Hey, that guy there is better than me!"</br>  <br> Hard? <br>Like Giselle? Or hardcore?</br></br>  <br> Implying <br>Toofsy had no reason to hate Yhwach. All he lost was his abusive uncle. He tagged along with Bazz, who treated him as an inferior and who out right said in his inner monologue that he expected Haschwalt to die before they got to Yhwach.<br><br>Then Yhwach comes along and is the first person to actually tell him he has value, and that he needs him. So yes, Toofsy is going to defend him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There isn't a giver taker pair. Jugo and yhwach have the power to give and take power.<br><br>Ishida uses conventional quincy powers so he isnt like them.</br></br></br></br>   inb4 toofsy pulls a gin and just went along with yhwach to get a chance to kill him.   <br><br>Remember Uryuu surviving the cleansing though? He must have some special ability.</br></br>  <br><br>He was 6th last year so it's very likely.</br></br>  <br> There isn't a giver taker pair. <br>Jugo is seme</br></br>  <br>What do you mean by "she is hard"?</br>  <br><br>He's the last of the pureblood quincy. Ichigo survived because he has Yhwach's power.</br></br>  <br>PARALLELS<br>A<br>R<br>A<br>L<br>E<br>L<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Haschwalth gives away Ywach's power away to Ichigo when he's asleep and he gets rekt by his own power.<br><br>It's the only way to avenge Bazz B and fulfill his wish of killing Ywach.</br></br></br></br>  <br>uh... he's gemischsfisfsfsak</br>  <br>Are you blind? Hes definitely uke.<br>Why do I even know these words. Please kill me.</br></br>  <br>Speaking of parallels.</br>  <br> Ishida <br> Pureblood <br>You fucking what.</br></br></br>  <br>He's different because of the powers Ichigo gave him</br>  Is there anything special about Jugs' sword?<br><br>Or is it just a sword?</br></br>  <br><br>ah crap i forgot i knew that. What I mean is, he's being used by Juha for some special task. He probably has some Haschwalth-like power.</br></br>  <br>No, Ryuuken is. Uryuu is a mutt who should have died with his mother during auswählen.</br>  <br>So thats why jugo was upset when ichigo faced juhabah</br>  Soooo Aizen was giving powers to the espada with a trancedent god rock. He created wondertard like a retarded quincy. WW even has zweihandler like haschwalth  Oh god, what  <br><br>Oh right</br></br>  <br>Wonderweiss looks like Haschwalth... O shi-</br>  <br>Better version.</br>  <br><br>These scenes are barely alike</br></br>  <br>She'll probably go back to being a smiling, foul mouthed bitch if we see her just hanging out with friends again.</br>  <br><br>Maybe his family never took yhwach's power</br></br>  so bazz-B is gong to die right? it seems pretty unlikely that he is going to live.  <br>Not so much friends to hang around.</br>  I wish they would animate this shit so i can finally hear how yhwach's name is pronounced.  <br>KUUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Yuhawa[Loch-sound].</br>  <br>Stupid backhistory of stupid characters that don't matter to be over and get back to the fucking action.<br><br>I honestly havn't read a page of the last two chapters because stupid flashback of stupid characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Bugger off.<br><br>He's getting Renji'd.</br></br></br>  <br>Motherfucker<br><br>KUUUUUBOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br>  <br>Yu-ha-bah-ha</br>  http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2755098</wbr>  <br>no. it's that ywatch is a fullbringer and not a quincy. <br>and full bringers are in turn basically hoguyukous</br></br>  <br>Well, that would be a twist.</br>  <br>full bringers are in turn basically hoguyukous<br><br>what?</br></br></br>  <br>So is the hogyoku an attempt to create an artificial SK/Yhwach?<br><br>And strangly enough, tAizen describes both himself and Utahans arriving at the "hogyoku solution". Solution to what? An ineffective king?<br><br>Is Ichigo a different form of artificial soul king, capable of giving and receiving powers? And what's uryuu's role in all this, given he has something that can surpass Ywach. Shits kubo right now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Makes sense to introduce them if this is the case. They did have the power to manipulate souls and ginjou at least could give and take power.</br></br>  Anyone else who feels like Jugo and Bazz aren't even friends, but just a bunch of kids who just hung out together because nobody else was around? Bazz had his own deluded idea of a partnership and Jugo just played along because he was weak, but he never even seemed to enjoy the company. <br><br>Bazz gave him the nickname Jugo and he hated that nickname. Whenever Bazz asked questions about stuff that were personal to Jugo, Jugo'd respond by saying it was none of his business. Bazz called Jugo one of his followers and saw him as a project or a pet even. Maybe because he was a self-proclaimed genius and he felt like it was his duty to take care of the weak and bring them to heights they wouldn't reach on their own.<br><br>It was Bazz who proclaimed the ambition to kill Yhwach. Jugo's reaction was deadpan. No emotions on his face too when he revealed his uncle died in the fire. Bazz claims that they had a mutual understanding. That's just his assumption though. They never seemed to talk about Jugo's lack of progress on all grounds, outside his swordplay and archery, and his value to the team because of it. Bazz thought Jugo was useless, but couldn't bring himself to desert him. maybe because that's what a leader shouldn't do to his follower. <br><br><br>Jugo did somewhat panic when Bazz started fights with officers, which hints at some levels of caring. Maybe Jugo was just happy to play around, training in the woods with Bazz. Jugo even tried to convince Yhwach Bazz was the true talent. But then Yhwach explained him his true worth. Intercepting Bazz' arrow illustrated their relationship is over. <br>Jugo also didn't seem to take Bazz's ambitions seriously at all, while Bazz didn't even consider to talk things over with Jugo, he made the decisions and Jugo would naturally follow. Bazz definitely didn't see them as equals. But as soon as the dynamics changed, Bazz envied Jugo for it, which makes this panel ironic, because in some ways, Bazz' jealousy and frustrations ruined their partnership.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was Ichigo who removed Aizen's powers, not the hogyoku. He responded to the longing in his heart and stripped him away from his powers, balancing the situation by loosing his own</br>   jewgram finally cut down Bazz-B like a dog he is <br><br>Good fucking riddance.</br></br>  Oh yeah. Bazz also stated that the rare Quincies he thought was a myth like Jugram were culled whilst still young. Maybe that's what happened to Yhwach. He got ostracized when he was young, even though everybody went to him as a baby because he could deliver miracles for them, and all of this is just some elaborate way of payback.  <br> implying it's over yet <br><br>Remember quilge. Remember superstar, the slut squad and banana. Remember the elite 4 and ichibei. <br><br>Bazz has at least another 2~3 more chapters before he gets another "final" blow. Then he'll get revied later on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hikifune would be a perfect match for her. Maybe Orihime too.</br>  <br>Holy shit, Jewha is huge. Toofsy doesn't even get to his knees.</br>  <br> he has been absorbing the powers of those around him to grow stronger. <br>Literally the opposite</br></br>  <br>She is heavy-handed.</br>  <br> Chad <br>B - The Bro<br> Orihime <br>P - The Pollyanna</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>KUBO<br>U<br>B<br>O</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He gives power and takes it away from those his power has influenced. He even gains from the deaths of shinigami who fought his star knights.</br></br>  <br>So was gigi thinking about dicks or vaginas? or both?</br>  <br> Sides with the guy who immolated his bad touch uncle <br> Over a kid who treated him like a vassal <br> Who was only strong because he was subconsciously buffing him in the first place. <br>Bazz a shit</br></br></br></br>   toofsy has the same power as Yhwach <br> Yhwach doesn't give him the A </br>  <br><br>Nothing. That is the joke.</br></br>  <br>u fokin wot<br><br>The Hogyoku stopped granting power to Aizen because Aizen doubted himself after being cut down by Ichigo. It realigned itself with Urahara. This is stated clearly, can't you read?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Ichigo probably shared his soul with all those he crossed blades with considering he was always able to feel and see into their Souls when they fought. <br><br> yfw Ichigo Auswahlens the Gotei13 and his Nakama for the final battle. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nowhere is it said that it realigned with urahara.</br></br>  <br><br>Aizen's powers weren't removed, for a brief instant Aizen wished something retarded, I forget exactly what, something along the lines of wanting to be a shinigami again, but that allowed Urahara's binding kidou to affect him.</br></br>  <br>I still think it was censored, not a joke.</br>   liking bleach, when you can read superior naruto instead.   <br>aizen's heart desired to be just one among the rest of the shinigami, because he was always so above the rest of his companions that he felt sad and alone.</br>  <br>but naruto has ended, even the gained has just ended today.</br>  <br><br>He still has Burner Finger 5 to use right guys?</br></br>  <br>We only see her abuse Candy, and they all fuck with Candy because she's kind of a bitch. She protects Gigi and saves Minnie.</br>  <br>Yes, yes, but in general she is not easy to deal with. Highly sarcastic and foul-mouthed, in order to endure her company you need a tough skin.</br>  <br> spouting theory as fact <br><br>There's no confirmation on why Aizen devolved. 3 theories are<br><br>1) aizen lost control of the hogyouku after ichigo layed on the mugetsu smackdown (as stated by urahara)<br>2) aizen wished to be weaker so he wouldn't be alone (theorised by ichigo)<br>3) some shenanigans with ichigo's potential giving and absorbing power (new theory thanks to this chapter)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Everyone will survive (like Mouth Loli, Mohawk, and Zombie Girl did) except Rukia as Ichigo takes all of her power again. He watches her fade out of existence like at the end of the Deicide arc. <br><br>Do you think the idiot unconsciously makes his enemies stronger and that's why he always loses or just barely wins his fights?</br></br></br>  <br>Next chapter. Chapter after that toofsy will nosell burner finger 5 and dramatically cut him again (this time with Schmidt powers)</br>  <br> Do you think the idiot unconsciously makes his enemies stronger <br>No, they are legitimately stronger than him at the time but his soul imparting allows him to absorb/understand their power so he can match and then overwhelm them. Which means that he's been using something like Yhwach's Almighty since the start.</br></br>  <br>Hikifune could probably handle her if she could stand Hiyori. Mopey post-mexico Orihime not so much, but maybe if she went back to being weird.</br>  <br>Hiyori idolized her, maybe the word is "tame".</br>  <br><br>We've known that's how it's been since the beginning though, Urahara flat out said that Ichigo gave them their powers. What Aizen said, was that the reason they managed to awaken those powers was because of the Hougyoko.</br></br>  <br>Nardo is over again?</br>  The 5 war potentials are 5 quincy born without the capability to control reishi<br><br><br>0-Ichigo<br>200-X<br>400-Aizen<br>600-X<br>800-Kenpachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ginjo and ishida?<br>Chad and orihime?</br></br>  <br>yes.</br>  <br>Yhwach said Yama would have been on the list if he hadn't gone soft, so its not that.</br>  <br><br>No. They're just strong guys who could change the momentum of the war.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I say Ishida is one of them, and the last one is a wild card, Ichibei maybe, urahara or mayuri?</br></br></br>  <br>Ishida Char and Orihime are all under 20<br><br><br>He specifically said<br><br>Do you know why i didnt consider you one of the war potentials?<br><br>No answer was actually given.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't be Urahara or anyone else who went to mexico. It would've been mentioned when they got all excited about Ichigo being there.</br>  <br>true, and I don't think it willb e ishiin ryuuken or tessai,so it's probably ginjo or facebook by elimination, and it would make sense, but there's no arrancar in the list, so my theory of a character from each faction is already wrong, unless Ishida isn't a war potential.</br>  Jugo is broken. He flip flops to anyone that shows they care about him, the moment Yhwach patted him on the head and said he needed him his expression changed.<br><br>And bazz is a jelly dick consumed by revenge.<br><br>So it's one of those "everyone loses" situations that Kubo loves.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He mentioned how weak Yama was (spiritually) and asked why he didn't get his arm healed (remember how much grimmjow's power tanked when he was disarmed)</br>  <br>Sharktits might be one. She's pretty strong, beating her means you own mexico, Yhwach went after her personally, and he bothered to capture her like he tried with Ichigo instead of just frying her like he does with everyone else.</br>  <br>Think about it this way. Why would Yhwh ask yamamoto WHY he didnt consider him one of the war potentials?<br><br>He didnt hear the term recently so it had to be 1000 years ago</br></br></br>  <br>I think he did that just to show the arrancar who's boss, not because she was actually a danger.</br>  <br>more liltotto please</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  I feel bad for all the parties involved in this situation.<br><br>Except for Yhwach he's just a nigger.</br></br>  <br>I FUCKING KNEW IT !!! THAT WAS BLUT VENE ON AIZEN'S CHEST</br>   Yhwach had his eyes open back then <br> Yama really did nuke the fucker at full power </br>  <br>My understanding was that the war potential are people potentially capable of turning the tide of war. Yama was now too weak to oppose Yhwach so he wasn't on the list. <br><br>Kenny made the stupid mistake of fighting Gremmy with his eyepatch on and burnt himself out before he could do anything, but I seriously think he was a massive threat to Yhwach pre mimihagi/sk absorption.</br></br></br>    <br>That was hougyoku<br><br>Blut vene would activate to heal someone</br></br></br>  <br>So that was a Vollstandig due to the hogyoku or Aizen had it in himself all that time? Since the HK grants the powers to the persons having the potential to fulfill their dream? Aizen had it in him all this time? Combined with his hatred towards the SK, that means Aizen is part quincy too</br>  What happens to Quincies when they die? Do they go to SS? Will Yhwach have control over them?  <br>Yama is a beast. Not Aizen nor Yhwach wanted to fight him straight up. Both resorted to scheming/sneaky tactics. Yhwach didn't feel the need for that against Ichibei.</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br><br>I think you're putting too much thought into this, nothing implies that Aizen is a Quincy. If he exhibited Quincy traits he did it AFTER fusing with the Hougyoko and becoming a transcendental beings.<br><br>However, it wouldn't make sense for him to actually be part quincy because if he was he would have the potential to surpass ichigo(who is one part of everything), and that wouldn't make sense story-wise.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there's a third place the quincies reside. <br><br>What about Ichigo?<br><br>SS or mexico?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ichigo is part Quincy and Aizen crossed blades with him and also took in some of his Reiatsu. So because Ichigo pretty much has Yhwach/Jugrams power giver ability, Aizen was essentially given a piece of Ichigo's soul and was in turn made part Quincy as a result. This allowed the HG to boost Aizen even more as a result.</br></br>  <br> yfw the espada had to die so aizen could absorb their powers and transform </br>  <br><br><br>No Halo. Also Vollstanding is an invention of Yhwach, it's a power he gave to the Sternritters. It's impossible for Aizen to have it.<br><br>That was just another stage of evolution, just like his previous form, just like the chrisalis form and just like the mantaray orgy monster he was at the end.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Like this?</br>  <br>Yeah if Aizen gained Quincy power it was when he took in Ichigo's Reiatsu at that moment and thus a piece of his soul as well.</br>  <br>That triggered the hogyoku</br>  <br>Yamamoto killed Ywach soldiers with Ryjin Jakka, thus trapping their souls, and with that yawach couldn't get his power boost of recovering his soul fragments.</br>  Will you people stop fucking up my damn theory<br><br>Remember Aizen was also extremely powerful as a child. Just like Ichigo Kenpachi and haschwald. <br><br>Not to mention all 4 of these characters can have there births 200 years apart from each other</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's possible he didn't know about Ichibei's power (he didn't seem to know that his Bankai couldn't be stolen) or he simply knew that he couldn't activate ALMIGHTY in time to fight Yama</br>   mfw reading this thread <br><br>Why is Bleach so retardedly convoluted sometimes</br></br>  <br>Hitsugaya?</br>  <br>Zero level reader pls</br>  <br><br>Your theory is dumb, so is theirs.<br><br>Kenpachi is a war potential because he has boatloads of reiatsu. Which means he could destroy Yhwach, just like Yama did.<br><br>Aizen is a war potential because he is a transcendental being, something that as far as we know, Yhwach wasn't(he probably is now that he absorbed the spirit king) which means Aizen could've made Yhwach kiss his boots if he felt like it.<br><br>Ichigo is a war potential because he is all of the above and he could eat Yhwach if he knew how.<br><br>The other war potentials are probably Urahara and someone else.<br><br>Urahara because he could science Yhwach into a cube.<br><br>And the other one is probably either Uryuu or Ryuken, probably Ryuken since he has quincy magic.<br><br>Also  I think Uryuu going to Yhwach is part of the plan, Yhwach said Uryuu is the last living quincy, but that's wrong because Ryuken is alive and Ryuken literally called himself "the last quincy" and mocked Uryuu for calling himself that.<br><br>Yhwach might not know about Ryuken</br></br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That triggered the hogyoku <br>Sure. Or are you implying that once Ichigo passed a piece of his Soul into Aizen that the HG actually started his transcendence at that moment?</br></br>  <br>Jugo was weak</br>  <br> Yhwach might not know about Ryuken <br>Now that's retarded</br></br>  <br><br>It is. But the alternative is that Yhwach killed Ryuken.<br><br>That'd suck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably Uryuu. Yhwach said he had something could one day surpass him</br>  <br>No fucking way. It was Urahara</br>  <br>Wasn't that because he shot a Getsuga at him? The attack he uses where he shoots his energy from his sword?</br>  <br>Weak enough to crush bazz bs arrow bare handed</br>  So how 'bout them retarded theories? I really liked the one where Jurgram was Byakuya's father, and the one where Ginjo was supposedly Aizen, or Askin was Aizen.  <br>Says my theory is dumb doesnt actually explain why<br><br>instead substitures it with "These are really strong kids"<br><br>With no explanation as to why these random kids hold such power</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He was weak though. Even Ywach says it, it's possible that when Ywach touched him he unlocked his power level or something.</br>  <br>1. He grabbed the center of it mid flight.<br>2. We don't know how strong bazz was in those days. He was likely weak by current standards.</br></br>  <br>Well duh? How else Ichigo's reiatsu will en up inside of Aizen?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Yhwach said Uryuu is the only "mixed-blood" Quincy to have survived his holy selection.<br><br>But then he goes on to say that he is "The only quincy" to have survived the holy selection.<br><br>But we have Ichigo and Ryuken running around, so what gives? We know Yhwach knows about Ichigo so why is he not mentioning him? Ichigo is also mixed blood isn't he? He is half shinigami.<br><br>Unless, that makes him more pure? Yhwach does use a sword with a name(even though we don't know the name yet).<br><br>But that still leaves the question of why he is ignoring Ishida's dad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think that Pernida isn't a human, pic related, you can see some fragments when Oestu pull off his sword from his skull.<br>What do you think ? (Bleach 601)</br>  <br><br> &gt;Yhwach might not know about Ryuken <br> Now that's retarded <br><br>Indeed, but there's always the possibility that Ryuuken has something in him that makes it so Yhwach can't can't get a read on him like how he couldn't understand or predict Mimihagi's actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  Bazz has balls shooting a reishi arrow to a Yawach with the eyes open.  <br>They're saying Ichigo gave him reiatsu via wifi like YWHW but that picture shows him shooting it as an attack wanting to harm rather "give" power. Those are two similar but different concepts.</br>  <br>Fuck, it's not tottally a spoiler image. I misclicked.</br>  <br><br>I explained more than you did bitch.<br><br>There's nothing that even implies that Zaraki is part quincy or quincy anything, your logic is literally "he is strong so he must be part quincy" which makes no sense, since we know there's pure shinigami who can destroy Quincy, even the father of all Quincy since we know Yamamoto blasted that nigger into submission.<br><br>What, you think yama is also part quincy? And i explained why Aizen and Ichigo are dangers to Yhwach perfectly well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ryuken is pure blood, and Ichigo is way more than a mixed-blood quincy.</br>  <br>He don't know Yhwach true powers + he's surrestimating himself + he's blind because of his rage.</br>  <br>He used Blut Vene and Blut Arterie</br>  <br> attackign an enemy you know nothign about <br><br>he still has balls.</br></br></br>  Does anyone care about these fodder characters to the point where we need to waste chapters on them? Does Kubo not have editors to tell him he's being retarded?  <br>Fujos would go ABSOLUTELY MAD with this</br>  <br>Nobody to call me a genius because I found it ?</br>  <br> Does anyone care about these fodder characters to the point where we need to waste chapters on them? <br>Yeah, Bleach fans care.<br>And Bazz-B is very popular. Probably the most loved SR.</br></br></br>  <br><br> does anyone care about all this weird quincy shit being explained <br><br>Yes, because we don't know jack shit about the Quincy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't resemble a hooded human <br> I think it's not a human guys </br></br>  <br><br>Maybe it's an arrancar, or maybe it's just flesh, or teeth, who cares.</br></br>  <br> Probably the most loved SR. <br>That'd be Jizzele</br></br>  <br>Well, the thing is that's basically how Ichigo's Understanding of Hearts through Battle works. He fights people and understands them by crossing blades with them, and with this chapter's revelation it tells us that if Ichigo one of those Quincy, he is probably imparting pieces of his soul into his opponents and taking them back during combat.</br>  <br>Oh, fuck. It's the 6pointed star again. What now kubo?</br>   The Ishida with Yhwach is Ryuken in an Uryuu suit   <br><br> the ultimate seal of destruction <br><br>Probably what was used to seal the spirit king.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The getsuga was before he even touched his sword. How could he understand him then give him a piece of his soul without even making contact? And the time he did he didn't even shoot anything other than Mugetsu. I doubt that would give Aizen a pseudo shrift.</br>  So did Bazz still has got some potential inside him he awakened later or is the power he had all along the arc coming from Jugo which he kept since then ?<br><br><br>Anyway, coming from their several interactions, Bazz clearly isn't a bad guy, even if he was jealous when he heard of Jugo's power (and that was as a kid), we saw him telling he deserves to be the next boss of the quincys instead of Ishida. And before the FB he did say he saw him as a friend.<br><br>I really hope he's not dead. Yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't really give credit to the editor's comment, how many times did we see a "x is dead !" when he isn't.</br>  <br><br>I saved your comments. I will be on this thread the day when Pernida's identity will be revealed, and I will laugh at you.</br></br>  <br>You don't know what story telling is don't you?</br>  <br>I doubt it.<br>Personally, my favorite SR are Lille Barro and MdM.</br></br>  <br> I saved your comments <br>One's telling you that being called a genius for thinking the obvious question doesn't work that way. The other is saying, who cares because it hasn't been relevant for months.</br></br>  <br>The fact they survived until then kinda shows that Baa, liltotto and Giselle are all popular.<br><br>And that's not surprising since they're among the only good quincys.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Yhwach was just bullshiting him. Yhwach is a huge dick.</br></br>  <br> Ichigo couldn't understand ginjo because of Facebook powers <br> Facebook is training with shibas <br><br>interesting</br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be pretty funny. Whatever we can say, Bazz B is still among the strongest quincys, and he clearly improved a lot since the FB.</br>  <br> they're among the only good quincys. <br> Giselle <br><br>pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Yhwach is just fucking with him, look at the way Orihime and Chad work, they've gotten stronger even if Ichigo isn't around them.<br><br>Maybe Toofsy did boost Bazz's power, but it's not like he is strong only because of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good that the flashback didn't show the history of the Quincy army, Yhwach's motives and the formation of the Sternritter. That would have been pointless.<br><br>Also, Bazz tries to kill Yhwach and still gets a place in the ranks of his troops? Why?</br></br>  <br> Gigi isn't one of the best Quincies </br>   Alright! Favorite Sternritter poll! <br> Hashwald <br> BazzB <br> Robert <br> Royd <br>flusteredfrog.jpg</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he is strong and because Yhwach doesn't like scrubs. He literally told Ishida that he was happy all of his men were angry at his decision of making him his successor.</br></br>  <br>fair comparison. What Jugo "gave" him was the key to unlock his potential. But he clearly had one to become what he is now.</br>  Only 7 "big fish" in the bad side (4 elit SR, Jugo, YWH and Ishida) and we still have a lot of people who didn't show all of their capacities in the good side (grimmjow, D0, captain without known Bankai, Isshin, Ryukei).<br>I hope Kubo will be able to handle it.</br>  <br>The actual crossing of Blades doesn't matter for the Soul imparting to work, for instance, Yhwach only needed people to touch him as a baby to do it. I mean it's not like Ichigo actually crossed blades with Orihime or Chad either, but if Ichigo is one of these Quincy then he still imparted a piece of his Soul into them by just being near them. <br><br>That Getsuga attack is just a convenient moment to use if Kubo actually makes a deal about Ichigo imparting his soul into the people he fights.</br></br></br>   yfw Ulqiorria comes back and fucks Haschwalds shit up <br><br>Nigga died too quick</br></br>  <br>the most popular theory to show everyone's powers and makes it a hard fight would be that the D0 becomes part of YWH. They have to protect the spirit king and that's what he is, refer to what the monk said after Ichigo went fighting YWH.</br>  <br><br>Some shit is going to go down pretty soon.<br><br>Also i wouldn't underestimate the number of enemies, remember Yhwach has Yamamoto's Bankai complete with the ten trillion skeletons.<br><br>You also forgot Aizen and his inevitable keikkaku.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then what about that whole bunch of chapters where Ichigo's Quincy powers woke up after escaping Quilge? If they were asleep how would he be able to do Quincy shit before hand?</br>  <br>Yeah, I heard of this theory but I don't believe it personally.<br><br>Skeletons are ultra weak, but it's true that Aizen will do something against the Soul Society.<br>But I still believe that, because of Aizen's shikai, we will have a fight between Juha and him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the only espada that could have fucked the quincies over is Barragan.</br>  Why doesn't Yhwach have a beardstache and not the full beard like Not-Zangetsu?<br><br>This is really making me autistic. 1000 or whatever years ago he should have had the Zangetsu beard.</br></br>  <br>The give and take power isn't something truly Quincy, as we learned this chapter it is a trait unique to beings similar to Yhwach. Like Jugo couldn't do any real Quincy shit until after he met Yhwach but he still imparted a piece of his Soul into Bazz-B and boosted his development. <br><br>Ichigo also always had a bit of his Quincy power unlocked with Old Man Zangetsu giving him power in since the beginning. The Quilge shit just meant that now Ichigo could theoretically form a bow and use Blut Vene&amp;Arterie.</br></br></br>  <br>and what are the royal guards doing? or at least Ichibei? (who I assume has resurrected the others).</br>  <br>And where did he get his fashion glasses?</br>  <br> The give and take power isn't something truly Quincy, as we learned this chapter it is a trait unique to beings similar to Yhwach. <br>Like Gingo? So yhwach is a fullbringer?</br></br>  <br><br>In no order:<br><br>1)Gigi<br>2)Äs Nodt<br>3)Bazz-B<br>4)Haschwalth<br>5)Askin</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of the good guys will jobbed.</br>  <br>Yama beat Yhwach even with his eyes open. That fucker always got nerfed, both by Aizen and Yhwach's sly tactics.<br><br><br>Must have gone to the local Hot Topic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;That would have been pointless. </br>  <br>Same that the gotei 13 I guess. They're coming to Ywach's palate.</br>  <br>Yamafag please. Just keep telling yourself that.</br>  Oh shit<br> Ichigo gives powers to chad and orihime <br> Chad and orihime have small piece of quincy soul in them <br> in the case of hime - hairpins with speshul power <br> with Chad it manifests like Fist of offence and fist of deffence <br> like Blut vene and blut arterie <br><br>KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Against who ? The black monsters Ywach spitted or his quincy ? I'm sure even Orihime can slap them.</br>  <br> Like Gingo? So yhwach is a fullbringer? <br>It's never been confirmed but Yhwach's power over souls is really similar to Full-bring. And Ginjo's give and take power is really similar to Yhwach, so Kubo might bring up the connection if and when Ginjo arrives. Oh and one of Ginjo's full-bring items is a Cross so he could be part Quincy.</br></br>  People are losing their shit about theories and not even reading between the lines. What do we know so far?<br><br>-&gt;Ichigo is part Quincy and wasn't using actual SR powers. His getsuga was similar to that hollow beam attack and in every instance pre-bankai he charged his sword, he was pulling reishi into it. The concept of zanpakutou isn't foreign to Bach, but because it requires a connection to a hollow, it was easier for Young Bach to mock the power. This is a two-fold problem current Bach faces; Ichigo's hollow powers are functioning alongside his Quincy powers.<br><br>-&gt;Kenpachi is a walking tank that wastes too much time on "enjoying" a fight. Yamamoto didn't encourage Kenpachi to lift his restraints before and probably would have insisted they remain because there is next to nothing that can stop Ken from walking through Seireitei unopposed. <br><br>-&gt;Aizen is a transcendental being that even the SK went "Well, fuck" upon picking it up on his soul radar. The thing that held Aizen back was his own arrogance and dissatisfaction with SS as it is to such an extent that he wished himself weak. <br><br>-&gt;Uryu is a war potential alongside the other 3. His power trumps the other Quincy even despite having lost it once before. Why did his grandfather insist upon teaching him the Quincy arts if it was futile? His would-be mother was already doing the dirty with a filthy SR, so it didn't matter. Also, despite Jugo having the potential to be Ywach's inheritor, he wasn't. This suggests that something stopped them from becoming one and because Jugo is now dead, Ywach can't return to full power. His fusion with the SK is a temporary solution that will ultimately end the same way it did with Aizen. <br><br>-&gt;Orihime might possess aspects of the SK, but she's not related. Her power didn't develop until AFTER Ichigo saved her and only because she herself had "died". Chad's situation is similar, despite what the Fullbringer's claim. Both "died" and then came back. (cont)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He wields zweihandler like hashwalth.</br>  <br> retarded Quincy is born every 200 years <br> last Quincy war was 200 years ago <br> Uryuu and Ichigo born at the same time <br> it was actually Ichigo and not Uryuu who's the retarded Quincy </br></br></br></br>  <br> He wields zweihandler like hashwalth. <br>Wow they are similar swords and the Zweihandler is formed outta his Cross. So Ginjou could really turn out to be part Quincy, and if that's true, he should show up soon for some exposition.</br></br>  <br>notice jugo's crazy eyes just before he stops the blow.</br>   Ginjou's powers are similar to Yhwach's and probably to Ichigo's <br> Everything but the Rain took place in Naruki city <br> Naruki city = Xcution's headquarters  <br><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Continued...<br><br>Ichigo had the "potential" to become a Fullbring, but possessed none of the qualities. Instead, Young Bach was manipulating his powers to give the impression that he was one. Ichigo never lost his powers; Bach simply couldn't sustain them and suppress the hollow anymore and put his efforts into a full-time suppression effort. Why would he suppress the powers of someone who could be a potential asset to his older self? Because there was another pureblood. So Young Bach suppressed Ichigo's powers and stopped him from interfering.<br><br>Back to the Fullbring thing, Chad and Orihime "died" and came back. Generally when two souls interact (as shown multiple times) a piece of their individual reiatsu's are absorbed by the other. Orihime absorbed both her brother's and Ichigo's (both powerful as they were) which in turn caused her powers to develop. When Aizen said "Her powers trespass on God's territory" it was the first hint that Ichigo was retard-tier powerful. Orihime absorbed not just SR and Hollow power, but aspects of Quincy as well. Ywach even tells her that trying to fix the SK is "pointless" as though he knows what her power is despite (to our knowledge) having never seen it in action before. Why would he know something he shouldn't?<br><br>Chad's power is similar to Orihime's, but instead of simply "giving back" he "takes" and uses that to destroy. If Orihime is the aspect of "Giving back" and "treading on God's territory", then Chad's is the aspect of "Taking" and "Stealing from God". So why is the level of their powers so different? Orihime had direct contact with Ichigo and Sora. Chad got second-hand germs.<br><br>-&gt;The last two war potentials aren't mentioned because their power is uncertain. Rather than assume they would be reliable assets, both sides assume they'll be too inconsistent to be a help</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blame Bleachasylum, not me.</br>  <br>The fact that he called Orihimed " that woman" means he don't have any consideration for her I think.</br>  <br> Ywach even tells her that trying to fix the SK is "pointless" as though he knows what her power is despite (to our knowledge) having never seen it in action before. Why would he know something he shouldn't? <br><br>Because every villain in Bleach calls something "pointless" without knowing what it is. And half the time, their eyes widen in surprise when it works.<br><br>Orihime fell into the other half, this time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;last Quincy war was 200 years ago <br><br>It was more like a genocide because yawach was still asleep.</br></br></br>  NOW IT ALL DOWN, PAST IT PRESENT!  hide your fanart, hide your waifus   TPP won't do nothing <br> People are exaggerating </br>  Fucking hell, haven't Funi done enough to kill anime in the US already?

Funimation only affects Americans.</br>  You can draw it, but you can't sell it.<br><br>Why is that a bad thing?</br></br>  <br> primarily concerned with brand names and logos <br><br>illiterates are the fucking worst</br></br></br>  So my freedom stops when they can no longer get money off others work?  <br>You don't have any freedom. Unless of course you're in a special part of the world.</br>  <br>And TPP will affect the world.</br>  <br>Logos can be important, like Kill la Kill's. If Funimation had that license, making parody logos of things like Krill la Krill could result in legal action.<br>Also some shows have very important symbols that are trademarked and if Funi has those you can no longer draw them.</br></br>  <br>It will but it still doesn't have anything to do with this specific thread.</br>  Where is Daiz to save anime from Funi  <br>Who the fuck cares? They'll be gunning after the makers of the fan art, and where do 95% of all GOOD fan art come from? That's right, from nip and chink artists on Twitter and Pixiv. Funi and Murrica can't do shit against them.<br><br>If anything, we should be celebrating this occasion because the only thing that'll be cleared away is the shitty Tumblr fan art with red shiny noses and the like.</br></br></br>   Do not post screenshots of anime without the written consent FUNIMATION Inc.   Get your DxD doujins now.  <br>There's good art on Tumblr from western users, just like there's shit art on Pixiv and Twitter from Asian users.</br>  <br>You have clearly never been to a convention's artist alley where you can see all around you, mostly good fanart</br>  <br>That's only limited to 'murrica. You can still import them abroad.</br>  Good thing my drawing skills are so bad that you can't tell which anime the characters are from  <br><br>So you're an idiot who doesn't understand the difference betweent copyright and trademark.<br><br>Hell you don't even need to understand, they explicitly say they'll only go after trademark violations like people using their logo/etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There's good art on Tumblr from western users <br>Yeah, and you can count them on one hand.<br><br><br>It's still not a great loss by any means. And waifufags will finally be freed from Shindol's butchery of their waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they'll only go after trademark violations like people using their logo/etc. <br>their logo, or any of their licensed trademarks<br>like show logos and names</br></br></br>  <br>I never under stood how you fap to a book.<br>the pages don't stay down and you constantly have to change the page.</br></br>  <br>Once TPP hits, Funi will be able to go after the nips and chinks, though.</br>  <br>Quite a lot of Japanese fanart comes from tumblr as well.</br>  <br>Once TPP hits they won't have to, because fanart will be illegal in Japan.</br>  Do you people just not read before commenting on things? This doesn't say fanart can't be made or sold, it even says they encourage artists to create and sell fanart of their shows. What you can't use are trademarks, aka series logos and the funimation logo and stuff like that.  <br>heheh, so much for Comiket</br>  <br> which include a FUNimation-owned/licensed trademark <br> or are on display in conujunction with signage bearing a FffUNimation-owned/licensed trademark <br> primarily concerned with brand names and logos <br>so don't put the brand name or logo in the picture or on your booth sign?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Get your anime now.<br>Consider October your dooms day clock.</br></br></br>  <br>Shindol lives in Tokyo, anon.</br>  <br>fuck I can't type tonight</br>  What will you do when having a waifu is outlawed, anons?  <br>Like hell they can go after copyrights that they don't hold the intellectual property to. <br><br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>No it won't be? It just fucks with Japans existing copyright law. Doesn't mean that fanart is going to be illegal.</br>  <br>They'll pry my fanart folder from my cold dead hands.</br>  <br>Okay, so srs bsns everyone. What really happens when TPP goes down. Will the FBI van me for my anime trove? Do I need to unplug from the internet to avoid 50 years in prison for breaking Japanese copyrights? What do I need to expect?</br>  <br> Funi <br> having any power over Comiket and the doujin market, which studios and distributors implicitly support for free marketing <br>Toppest of keks. Trigger even actively encourages fan art. Remember the scissor relay race? Remember Sushio complimenting the artists on Pixiv and saying how moved he was by their efforts? TPP won't have any substantial effect.</br></br></br>  <br><br> show logos and names <br><br>Doubt they'd give a shit about that even assuming they register trademarks for show names and 'logos' of shows.<br><br>In any case, violation of trademark requires you to be using someone else's trademark in the course of business, if you use funi's logo in some shitty fanart for whatever reason, there's no trademark violation (maybe copyright for the logo art/design/etc though).<br><br>Non-law fags, non-law fags everywhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who has downloaded fansubs, ever, will be raided the moment TPP is signed. Then executed.</br>  <br>4chan shuts down. And fair use is kill.</br>  This just means they'll probably send someone around at American cons to hand out cease and desists in the AA. Which honestly makes no sense because it's not like they make a lot of money off of fanart in there. This is really dumb.  <br>better stock up on guns. I ain't goin down without a fight.</br>  <br>They can actually. That's the thing, TPP allows any kind of lawyer to report copyright violations. Right now Japan only cares if the actual rights holder is interested. That'll change with TPP.</br>  <br>So does this mean you can't sell doujinshi if it has the logo of the series you're "parodying"</br>  So, was TPP approved? I'm not murrikan so I don't really know.  <br>How is it worse than copyright law right now?<br>What is the actual legal ramifications for the typical anime torrenter?</br></br>  <br>I'd like to see what kind of person an " anime lawyer" is.</br>  <br>Oh, no, drawfags can't use Funi's trademarked logos anymore!<br><br>Who gives a shit? And this isn't even Funi's fault - trademark lapsing is a legitimate concern for them.</br></br></br>  You know you can look up what they have trademarked, right  <br>No, What passed was Obama getting the ability to "fast track" it. That just means that he can run by congress and say "This is cool, right?" and then they can say "yes" or "no" but don't get a chance to review.</br>  Is this some kind of witch hunt? These laws aren't new. If you don't defend your copyright, you lose it. FUNi is only saying that it's a bad idea to try to profit off their shit. It says nothing about suing people over creating fan art in general.  <br><br>Well shit, I'll pray to the porn gods so it doesn't pass in the congress.</br></br>  <br> If you don't defend your copyright, you lose it <br>please learn to read</br></br>   WAHHH CEASE AND DESIST <br> WAHHH DMCA <br> WAHHH TPP <br>Every time we get a new scary monster and nothing happens. Maybe a site flicks away some high-profile series and says it can no longer host licensed shit. Bleach and One Piece and Naruto is still fucking everywhere when they're probably the most copyrighted and trademarked titles in anime history.</br></br></br>  <br>The people paying Congress want it, so that means Congress will pass it.</br>  <br>You don't even know what you're talking about</br>  <br><br>Fuck this gay earth.</br></br>  You now remember megaupload.  <br>Not yet, but the TPA was which lets him fast track TPP.<br><br>I swear to god there's no way this gay marriage ruling was a coincidence, they're just dangling keys in front of all the fucking stupid liberals who are absolutely OBSESSED with retarded gender/identity politics so they can just walk over everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>I have to say, your reaction shows that the US is doing some good fucking stuff. God damn if they're not smart. <br>Push some retarded small scale shit that gets a lot of attention. Everyone is fucking scared and against it. Nothing actually happens<br>Now they finally push this big deal that will actually change shit and no one cares and or calls it bullshit. No media attention, not nothing. Well done Burgers, truly the greatest country on the planet.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Also, it has broad Republican support.(Think wealthy business owners getting even cheaper Chinese labor now). Union-backed Democrats hate it,other than Obama (he is committing political suicide by pushing it through, but his career's already over by this point so he doesn't care anymore). Anyways Republicans control congress, so it should pass with flying colors unless the Democrats can filibuster long enough.</br></br>  <br>They literally deserved to get taken down.</br>  <br>TPA prevents fillibuster; they just do a Yes/No vote to pass the "treaty" Obama hands them.</br>  <br> going to cons <br> putting FUNIMATION(tm) on your artwork <br> making conterfeit merchandise <br> good, normal fanart is allowed <br>based FUNIMATION(tm)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I literally never used MegaUpload, so I sometimes forget it doesn't exist anymore.</br>  <br>The letter explicitly states it's talking about the use of their trademarks in the buying and selling of fanart at conventions. Sure sounds like a business issue to me.</br>  <br>well, time to go kill myself. see you all in anime heaven. Don't forget to bring your waifus.</br>  Is tpp like sopa  <br> political suicide <br><br>Obama's been an opportunist since forever the fucking prick.<br>There was even a speech some years ago where he definitively said he doesn't support gay marriage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its Judgment day.</br>  <br>I'm voting for Bernie because in the unlikely event he becomes President, he'll do his best to get rid of it.</br>  <br>you know how big of dicks American copyright police are, yeah? Imagine those same people, except now they have the ability to enforce Asian copyrights as well. and that's TPP.</br>  <br><br>But there's hope yet, right? ;_;</br></br>  <br>see<br><br>There is no hope.</br></br></br>  Maybe they should stop fan-retitling and fan-'remastering' every Dragon Ball episode.  <br>It's a thousand times worse than SOPA. TPP literally gives corporations the right to sue countries in international tribunal for passing laws that 'adversely effect their potential profits', basically allowing them to dictate law in regards to trade, commerce and copyright.</br>  <br>I don't really get why he's being so pushy about TPP anyways. What's the benefit for him? Is he getting a payout from someone I guess?</br>  <br>Clinton is in favor of it too but is hiding for political convenience. She was at a fundraiser hosted by TPP lobbyists while the house was discussing it. Bernie Sanders and maybe Rand Paul are the only ones that would even have a chance of getting us out of it.</br>   tfw I'm retarded and don't understand why TPP would have an effect in Japan when Japan doesn't want it   <br>It's SOPA, but worse, for literally the entire world, rather than just US.<br><br>Actually they can enforce every copyright from every region in every other region, regardless of whether or not the region that the infringement actually takes place in considers it illegal.<br>You can be tried under foreign law in your own country, without access to lawyers familiar with the laws you're being charged as having broken.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is he getting a payout from someone I guess? <br>That's the basis of every law he's passed so far.</br></br>  <br>The same reason he signed the NDAA.</br>  <br><br>Bernie, pls<br>Pls<br>Beat Hillary and become president<br>For our waifus<br>;_;<br><br> Also his platform is mostly solid, probably the only candidate with integrity for this election cycle. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Japan a signatory, though? Just like in America, it doesn't matter what the people what. The government is who's doing the fucking-over.</br>  <br>It's like SOPA except worse and also I don't care about this one.</br>  <br>Japan's government agreed to it because they're crusty old men that don't care about protecting intellectual freedoms.</br>  <br>I mean this is essentially already happening, otherwise this wouldn't have come up. TPP is just the official announcement as in "Hey, we can fuck your shit up. Nigger." No one knows about all the details, I imagine the stuff that is known is small scale shit compared to what they're actually agreeing on in secret. There is a reason why they won't tell you about it.</br>  can't you get around this by using a proxy from a country not under the treaty?<br>if shit hits the fan i have family in the Philippines I can run to</br>  <br> Actually they can enforce every copyright from every region in every other region, regardless of whether or not the region that the infringement actually takes place in considers it illegal. <br> You can be tried under foreign law in your own country, without access to lawyers familiar with the laws you're being charged as having broken. <br><br>How the fuck is this allowed to happen? I'm mad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Goddammit Abe</br></br>  <br> FUNimation <br> no fun allowed <br>everytiem</br></br></br>  <br>/a/ should build barracks and pull a Bundy.</br>  <br>There's no way that's constitutional. We must pray to the gods of SCOTUS. Too bad the Jews are keeping them distracted with SJW stuff...</br>  <br> TPP fast tracked <br> two days later <br> Hey guys, here is you gay marriage thingy </br></br></br>  So are any other /a/ users cancelling their Funi subscription or is this another example of 4chan getting mad about something but not mad enough to do anything about it?  <br>SCOTUS decisions happen at the same time every year, idiot.</br>  <br><br><br>I don't think Japan's actually signed it yet though, they're one of three that's still 'considering' it. If they decide to back out, it shouldn't have any affect on anime/manga. Pretty sure the industry is lobbing against it, we'll see what happens.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's retarded. Why would it exist at the first place?</br>  <br> "I'm a moron who doesn't understand how scheduling works" </br>   just don't literally put Dragon Ball Z® on your picture of oolong and you'll be fine <br><br>this is pretty much nothing</br></br>  <br> the only hope of semi-moral cartoon pirates might unironically be Antonin Scalia and his impossibly stubborn textualism <br>Strange bedfellows.</br></br>  <br> cancelling their Funi subscription <br><br>No, this is a case of you being a fag. Not to mention that you don't belong here.</br></br></br>  <br>With who is on the current court, they would absolutely keep it. This is the same court that said billion dollar donations "don't lead to an appearance of corruption".</br>  <br>From a non-anime viewpoint, won't it also make Chinese products even cheaper and put the final nail in the coffin of the already-dying American manufacturing industry?</br>  <br>shilling<br>http://www.opentpp.org/<br>Sign other anti TPP petitions<br>Also call your senators and congressman.<br>Let them feel your displeasure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because fk u and ur waifu</br>  <br><br>Maybe they will go the Disney route:<br><br>Disney's been known for suing schools for using copyrighted characters; however, they only charge the school something like $1 for the permission.<br><br>Funimation might be doing just that: they HAVE TO enforce their copyright/ tradmark rights, but they will show leniency.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funi is a terrible company whom I would never give a cent to, but in this case they've done absolutely nothing wrong.</br>  <br>What case was that?</br>  <br><br>I guess sarcasm is a lost cause in your country?</br></br>  We should send our waifus to our congressmen to show what they will be losing out on if they pass TPP  <br>because corporations</br>  <br>I doubt Funimation can even afford a real lawyer as it is.</br>  <br> congresspeople <br> caring about their constituents' opinions <br>top kek</br></br></br>  <br>Is this bait or are you just illiterate?</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>Citizens United vs FEC. Both sides have called it the worst decision since Dred Scott and it currently has an approval rating as low as Congress. <br><br>Most actual politicians are ok with it because it helps them stay in office.</br></br></br>  <br>they won't be getting lobbying money if they're voted out of office</br>  <br>You want to prostitute your waifu?</br>  <br>Why would any sane people pass that shit as a law?</br>  <br>It's pretty dumb to say it either way, enough idiots believe it that just stating it is not even close to obviously sarcastic</br>  <br>well obviously the industry would be lobbying against it, if it passes it will kill Comiket and the entire doujin industry due to American copyright law affecting everyone and it being anyone's duty to report it and profit from doing so.</br>  <br>I'd prostitute m'y waifu if that's what it took to keep her safe.</br>  <br><br>Not him but it's not the scheduling, they are blowing it up to keep TPA quiet.<br><br>I mean seriously, they lit the fucking whithouse rainbow, how can you argue they aren't using it to distract the public?</br></br></br></br>  <br> enough idiots believe it <br><br>Exactly.

So maybe that'll balance things out.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> fanart <br><br>Don't you mean ripoff?<br><br>Or is intellectual property theft a more appropriate word?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a real threat for a lot of them, no matter what they do. If they toe the party line, then no major candidate from their own party will have the edge over them on that issue, so as long as they're in a partisan state and don't have to worry about the opposition, they're basically safe voting as their fellows do.</br>  <br>For the first time in my life, I actually thanks Buddha for making me born in a communist shit hole.<br>Fuck Murrican.</br></br>  <br>All important Republicans are in favor and Clinton is in favor. Sanders isn't an important candidate, at least not yet.</br>  <br> making parody logos of things like Krill la Krill could result in legal action <br>Parodies have always been an exception in copyright law. That's why Weird Al is still able to exist.</br></br>  <br>Intellectual property theft is three words, doofus. Three.</br>  You all realize Japanese copyright laws are way stricter than US ones right? If doujinshi circles can do their thing under Japanese law nothing is going to happen under TPP. Funi would never take any kind of action in Japan that wasnt authorized by the actual Japanese rights holders, that would be business suicide for them.<br><br>Not saying TPP is good, just that its a non issue for this.</br></br>  <br>Trademark law is not copyright law. Trademark law is far more strict.</br>  <br>Every single trade deal of the last 50 years has resulted in a net loss of jobs, but it makes the ownership class a shitton of money.<br><br><br>Not only this, but then they get nice cushy jobs in their industries. Look at Eric Cantor and Chris Dodd.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Buddhist <br> Communist <br>Bad news, there are only a few countries I can think of that meet these criteria, and I'm pretty sure all of them are on the TPP.</br></br></br>  <br>Rand is against it.<br>Stop posting.</br></br>  <br>Myanmar hasn't, have they?<br>Though I'm not sure if Myanmar even has internet at all.</br></br>  <br>it will be when millions of people get sued or have their internet cut off for watching the wrong videos on Youtube</br>  <br>No one polling behind Donald fucking Trump should be considered major anon.</br>  <br>There are four _Republican_ candidates polling ahead of Rand. He isn't important.</br>  <br>Clearly you don't know anything about tumblr other than hearsay on here. A fuckton of professional artists have digital portfolios/displays on there.

I can't stop the sound of my mother screaming in the back of my mind</br>  Just ban waifus  <br>because doujinshi</br>  <br>It still won't get them voted out if there's no alternative. If you're in California, and you get mad at your Democratic leaders for voting for this, you can't do shit, because all the Democratic candidates will have the same stance as the ones you're mad at, and the constituency would rather mass sudoku than elect a Republican.</br>  <br>Well shit, time to move to Europoor.</br>  No need to doommonger so hard.<br>Draconian laws always get stamped out or at least watered down if there's enough public outcry for it.</br>  <br>It's not about shutting things down. It's about the copyright holder not having a say in whether or not his work should be taken down. It means any lawyer can profit from the copyright of someone else. Even if the copyright holder does not care.</br>  Funimation was a mistake  <br>The problem is that this is a treaty, not a law, so legally its an entirely different monster.</br>  <br>Wait, what? Fuck, I'm getting my brother to shut down all the fujoshi artists and split his profits with me.</br>  <br>Are you a lawyer?</br>  <br>My brother is.</br>  <br>If they want to keep their industry afloat, could the manga industry perhaps react by publishing their works under some sort of copyleft that specifically allows for doujinshi? That way fat Americans couldn't poach Comiket for free $$$.</br>  <br> internet autists can now profit off of rampantly suing each other <br><br>This can only end badly.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not how it works faggot. You go after one group, you go after all of them. Or someone else will.</br>  <br><br><br>I think the goal of this is to end all pirating once and for all by allowing anyone to make money off of reporting anyone else. Because of people's greed, the entire community will self-destruct and illegal downloading will be a thing of the past. That is the long range goal here.</br></br></br>  <br>No, the manga industry cannot create their own laws to get around the law. Fucking retard.</br>  <br>Like the Salem witch trials.</br>  If there is a doomsday clock of anime, where are we?   third parties can crack down on shit without consent from the legal copyright holders <br>Which braindead motherfucker thought this up?<br>That's literally ass backwards retarded right there.<br><br>This shit's too bizarro dystopian future-tier for me to take seriously. I honestly don't believe this will take flight for an extended period of time, it'll get too much backlash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>October.</br>  <br>Haha, jokes on you!<br><br>I already have my subscription to crunchyroll ready.</br></br></br>  <br>In a way, it's already happening in Germany.</br>  <br> it'll get too much backlash. <br><br>Has that ever stopped a government from fucking its people in the ass?</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm not talking about the laws, I'm talking about the wording of their copyright itself. When you copyright something, you own the copyright and can set the terms for it, yes? They can set the terms to allow for certain things, like people do for Creative Commons or GNU. That's what I was saying.</br>  <br> single handedly popularized anime in the west with Dragon Ball Z <br> THEY KILLED ANIME </br></br>  <br>I've had a subscription to CR for more than 2 years, step it up sendpai</br>  <br>Explain further.</br>  <br>10:30 PM.<br><br>We're still five years away from the Olympics.</br></br></br>  <br>Now THAT will be a shitstorm.</br>  <br>Won't make it any better. Our dear leaders are desperately shilling for TTIP over here, which is exactly the same shit.</br>  <br> never been on /ic/ <br> never heard of the number one site recommended to new artists looking to make money <br> thinking they know what good art is  <br>It's time you killed yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why will the Olympics kill anime?</br>  <br>There is nothing to explain, lawyers hold all the power in Germany when it comes to copyright. They will fuck your asshole if they feel like it.<br><br>I think they cooperate with copyright holders a lot closer though.</br></br></br>  <br>they're taking over Tokyo, so no Comiket for that year.</br>  <br>They will be using the Tokyo Big Sight area</br>  <br>Is anywhere safe from Obama?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>No. Let me explain.<br><br>You are technically required by law to protect your copyright if someone is infringing on it. If you knowingly let someone use your copyright then that infringement can legally be used as precedent to allow further infringement in the future. If you don't sue them you're legally giving up your copyright. Right now the copyright holders turn a blind eye to things like fanart and fanfiction, even though they should technically be suing everyone for it. They pretend not to notice it as long as everyone's doing it for free (selling doujin goods require a special license supplied for a limited time at events), and so everyone's happy. No one can force the copyright holder to go after those people.<br><br>With the TPP, any lawyer from a country under the TPP can go around the copyright holder and directly sue anyone for infringing on the copyright in any country under the TPP.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We all know who to thank for this.</br>  <br> thinks nippon cares about the baka gaijin have to say <br>Funishills everyone.</br></br>  <br>So the suit would be something like "Lawyer vs. anon" for pirating some anime series, without the copyright owners even knowing about it?</br>  <br>2020 WILL END IT ALL</br>  <br><br>Gensokyo</br></br>  <br>I hope so. We already have the dystopian cyberpunk thing down.</br>  <br>They fucked up baddly the soundtrack and you say they popularized the anime in west is bullshit because west is not only us fucker Latin America even Brazil got the original soundtrack and we got dbz years before the shit funanimation did and we got screwed with dbz Kai because U.S. And his shitty censorship</br>  <br>Yes, Mr. Steinberg from New York can sue you for downloading Yosuga no Sora without anyone from Japan even knowing about it. And he'll win because under the TPP you will be considered a digital terrorist.</br>  <br>What countries can I move to that won't give a shit about pirating that aren't China, Russia, or 3rd world shitholes?</br>  <br>Gensokyo</br>  <br>Sweden</br>  <br>I'm white they don't want me there</br>  <br>Unironically Costa Rica.</br>  <br>Literally none. All of america's buttbuddys are supposed to sign similar treaties and they will definitely sign them thanks to enough lobby pressure.</br>  <br>Try a third world shithole that at least has passable middle class privileges. The only thing bad about it is the fact that the internet is more shit than usual. Somewhere in SEA or maybe try Central America.<br><br>I know somebody who moved to the Philippines. In fact, he even went to Comiket once and got to sneak in some loli that he could genuinely get arrested for pass customs. But yeah, he says as long as you're middle class and above in that place, you're good. They have really shitty laws that can fuck over the average anon but lax enforcement makes it so that you can probably live there for more than a decade without getting cracked down by the fuzz.</br></br></br>    <br>I think you'll be safe in most capital/major cities.</br>  <br> Try a third world shithole that at least has passable middle class privileges. <br>Indonesia. Jakarta specifically, has a couple of towns that are filled with gaijins, have pretty good infrastructure and security to go with.</br></br>  <br> some loli that he could genuinely get arrested <br><br>Explain further.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're confused like I was: I think he meant loli doujins, not a loli he picked up off the streets of Manila.</br>  <br>I would have like this story more to be perfectly honest.</br>  <br> http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/re<wbr>pacts/ra2009/ra_9775_2009.html</wbr> <br> (b) "Child pornography" refers to any representation, whether visual, audio, or written combination thereof, by electronic, mechanical, digital, optical, magnetic or any other means, of child engaged or involved in real or simulated explicit sexual activities. <br> (2) computer-generated, digitally or manually crafted images or graphics of a person who is represented or who is made to appear to be a child as defined herein. <br><br>You think the shit happening in UK and France is bad?<br>I hope your legislators don't see this because this is literally your worst nightmare if a country with at least competent law enforcement passes this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm a spic, am I wanted there?</br>  <br>A very slightly related story this reminded me of that I feel like sharing: The author William Vollmann once stole I think an eleven-year-old prostitute out of a brothel in Thailand and found her a place in some orphan school.</br>  <br> visit the philippines <br> no toilet paper in public retrooms </br></br>  <br> public retrooms <br><br>There is your problem.</br></br></br>  <br> being a shut-in </br>  <br> TPP <br> Corporations like funi can sue latin american governments because mexicans sell too much unauthorized DBZ merchandise. </br></br>  <br>ive always wanted to visit central america, panama especially.</br>  <br>It also gives lobbyists greater influence on legislation and lets corporations sue governments for lost profits.</br>  <br>But I live in japan<br>are they gonna fly over the globe and tell me I can't make porn pictures of shows that they have copyright for in america that are initially from this country?<br>Good luck with that I guess</br></br></br>  <br>That's literally what it lets them do if they want to.</br>  <br>TPP allows them to do that and even sue Japananese government because it allows too many h-doujins to be spread</br>  <br>thats what tpp does</br>  <br>You do realize that America isn't the only country in the world that has lawyers? Also, you don't have to fly "over" the globe. Japan and the US are closer than you think.</br>  <br>And who the fuck is going to enforce that?<br>Do corporates really think people will allow their governments to give away their money?</br></br>  <br> allow <br><br>If only.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>okay what if I say I don't understand english, good luck finding an interpreter in this fucking country   obv joke  <br>but no really I highly doubt it will happen and if it will being smart about it is always an option, you can easily make them unable to find you if you post to right places.<br>And even if things get dire which has no probability of happening everyone could just do their OC manga, it's not that difficult to drop doujins, but again it's not gonna happen and at worst people will just have to get a proxy or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   mfw people care about their animus when tpp basically started a war conflict already <br>nukes soon baby<br>get ready<br>reminder doesn't matter where you live if any bomb goes off we're all fucked<br>after that agreement all import and export to ever country will get closed and if you don't live in straya or some shit you won't last even a month<br>nice priorities there</br></br></br></br></br>  It fucking Begins<br><br>Place your bets on whats going to happen next folks</br></br>  <br>Loli will be banned, it has been pushed to be banned for some time now and abe will probably say that having it in japan will offend the westerners visiting for the olympic games. And they will pass it just like the US has been doing with the confederate flag.</br>  <br>First and foremost it is a bunch of groundwork to create a new "Allies" faction for the upcoming WW3. Behind the scenes though it's also a bunch of favors for big businesses who in turn pay the politicians to pass it.</br>  <br>Another false flag.</br>  <br>2020 will end it all.</br>  <br>This kind of shit right here is why no one takes opposition to TPP and bills like it seriously.<br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>The confederate flag isn't banned in the US, you tard.</br>  <br>Torrenting will be legally no different from pedophilia.<br>Thanks the faggot for allowing the democrat to pass TPP in plain sight.<br>If you wondered why we hate you, you know why now.</br></br></br>  <br>This. As far as I know, torrenting being a serious legal liability in certain countries hasn't stopped anyone there from getting a VPN and keeping on keeping on.</br>  <br>The democrats are against TPP<br>Obama is working with Republicans to pass it.</br></br>  You can take away my privacy<br>You can take away my dignity and pride<br>You can take my life for all I care<br>But when you take away my anime and pictures of cute 2D girls you've gone too far. <br>The revolution starts now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> still thinking the democrats are the good guys </br>  <br> The democrats <br>No, lolthefuckno.<br>The people who back the democrats in every elections are completely in favor of it, which mans the democrats are effectively in favor of it.<br>You can't into facade. This is exactly why there is less black business owners post Obama than pre Obama, you're a nation of sheeps unable to even check what your politicians actually do.<br><br>Follow the fucking money!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hows 2006 treating you, anon?</br>  <br> The nose knows! </br>  <br>Also it fuck over small business owners which is the real base of the republicans. It 's an insurrection tier gamble, especially after spitting on their flag and constitution.<br>If the south ever pondered when to kill a president, that would be now.</br></br>  <br>Illusion to make it look like there are actually two sides. Since they can pass it with just the Republicans and the fact that Obama is all for it means all the Dems are too, they just get to pretend not to be.</br>  <br>The unions were against it but they don't call the shots in the party and haven't for a decade and probably 3. They were thrown under the bus in favor of identity politics a long time ago. Pelosi just came out today saying that Elizabeth Warren doesn't speak for the party and that we had been too hard on the financial sector.</br>  <br>It said display to, guess what you are doing with artwork when you put in on mass sites like danbooru?</br>  <br> Small business owners <br> Republican base <br>That's almost as delusional as the Democrats thinking they are for the working class. The Republican base has been religious fundamentalists and large corporations since at least 1980. When the Goldwater faction lost to the Pat Robertson faction, the party stopped representing small business.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>You're all retarded. This isn't controversial - every news source from Huffington to Fox will tell you that the opposition is the Democrats. Boehner and McConnell are backing it heavily and are haranguing the Democrats for holding it back. Reid has actively opposed it, and Obama's been meeting with Pelosi to try and get her to pressure people for him, because he needs more Democrats on board to pass it. The libertarian segment of the far right is pissed, sure, but they aren't in control of the Republican Party.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't differenciate electoral base from people they sold their soul to?<br><br>How strong is a party with no vote?</br></br></br>  <br>in the week leading up to the last episode Trigger asked people to draw pictures of characters running to deliver the scissor blade to Ryuko, like a relay race</br>  <br> How strong is a party with no vote? <br>We won't have to find out, because the Republican base has no other option. They're not going to vote for the Democrats in 2016 because they're mad about this treaty, are you kidding me? The same goes for the Democrat base.<br><br>There are two parties in the US, and as long as their bases are so entrenched in so many opposing positions, your vote is impotent as a bargaining tool against your party, because no matter how much you gripe, you will not withhold it, and the party knows that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> doesn't know about "we got guns, the democrats don't: fuck that shit!". <br>The danger is when the productive members of society considers rebellion not outrageous but a potential option.<br>And this is exactly what Obama created.</br></br></br>  <br>Obama is a Democrat. Stop trying to make excuses for the party leadership that's responsible for the treaty.</br>  <br>Actually this isn't true. The Democratic base holds out their votes on a regular basis (see 2000, 2002, 2010 and 2014). The exception in midterms was 2006 and that was strictly due to the sheer idiocy of the Bush administration in Iraq and Katrina.<br><br>The response from the party and the media is spun as big Republican wave when what actually happened is more Democrats simply refused to vote than Republicans.<br><br>Your vote is even more meaningless than you think.</br></br></br></br></br>   Mega-corps controlling the government <br> Drones flying in the sky <br> Big brother watching my phone and internet use <br> Crypto-anachism is a actually thing now <br><br>Now I just need to move to a metropolis and I can finally live out my cyberpunk fantasy.<br><br> In order to post this I had to help google refine their image identification software <br>Just like my sci-fi books.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the Democrats don't <br>I thought we were talking about the Republican voter base disagreeing with the Republican Party, but apparently you're just pushing /pol/ shit that won't happen. Have a nice night.<br><br><br>I haven't voted on a single thing in my life, so let's not act like I'm a Democrat shill here. Obama, a minority of Congressional Democrats, and a majority of Congressional Republicans are the ones who will be passing this bill, if it does pass (which is likely but nowhere near as certain as people in these threads have been claiming it to be).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cyberpunk is cool again.</br>   250+ posts in <br> brand names and logos <br><br>Its like when anons get baited with fake links.</br></br></br>  <br>but the bruce soundtrack is better. japanese soundtrack is cheesy and has shit music. vegeta ssj is best theme</br>  <br>Boehner and McConnell are Republicans. Stop trying to make excuses for the party leadership that's responsible for the fast-track.</br>  <br>So, electronic fedoras soon?</br>  <br>You're dense. If the republicans don't trust their leaders to oppose the democrats, the guns will talk.<br><br>Politic IS war, you idiot. Politicians fight so that we don't resort to violence.

I guess I got 23 years of misery left. Thanks, Obama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>someone needs to start archiving everything now then.</br>  <br>Yeah, no. "The guns will talk" isn't remotely viable. Especially not when your Ultimate Evil™ has unilateral nuclear capacity.</br>  <br>Someone elses archive cant help you much</br>  France is the 2nd market of anime in the world and a third of all anime &amp; manga related sale.<br>Nothing ever aired in the US ever did shit for anime and manga outside japan.<br>It was all the europeans. In europe the only way for the market is UP when it's related to anime.</br></br>  <br>You are the reason we have TPP. You keep supporting your own enemies just to be spiteful.</br>  <br> the democrats will nuke the us soil. <br> he believes that <br>Most cops don't even dare to enter cholos controlled zone due to all the guns, republicans have weapon cache all over the country.<br>What the fuck do you think will eventually happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br> he think you can keep humiliating the rep for a decade with no eventual consequence. <br>Funny, I remember when you all were saying "for four years" or "for half a term now," and based on how many of those vague pronouncements came to fruition, I have to conclude that the Republicans can be humiliated endlessly with no consequence.</br></br>  <br>If Obama hates America so much, why wouldn't he?</br>  Why are people working hard to make life hard?  <br> Especially not when your Ultimate Evil™ has unilateral nuclear capacity <br>You think they're going to nuke their own cities? And you're calling him crazy for predicting guerrilla rebels like a large portion of the world already has?</br></br>  <br> TPP will affect the world <br>lel, nope</br></br>  <br>why do you keep pretending to be American</br>  <br> Obama the kenyan flipflopper having an opinion. <br>Must remind ya he was anti gay marriage and anti guantanamo.<br>He do what his handlers say. Nothing more, nothing less.<br>Nuking the US won't print anyones money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Europe is currently passing it, moron. The greek debacle is used to hide it from the populace.</br>  <br>No, I don't actually think Obama's going to nuke his own cities. I also don't think there will be a civil war any time soon. I'm saying that the whole "Reps have guns, Dems don't, therefore there will be a massive rebellion and the Dems will be overthrown" line of thought is ridiculous. It functions on analogous logic to the nuclear one, and if both sides actually did abandon all sanity and just go into unrestrained warfare, Obama's powers (most of which go function through people who would obey him regardless of rebellion) would be more than enough to quell the Republicans.</br>  <br>Born in texas but living in france since I'm 5yo.<br>TPP very much affect me.</br></br>  What do Funi agents look like?  <br>Jewish lawyers.</br>  <br><br> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wor<wbr>ldnews/middleeast/israel/11712356/W<wbr>orld-Jewish-population-nears-pre-Ho<wbr>locaust-level.html</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br>  I know it's useless, but people should be offering up at least some fucking resistance to this.

Got it.</br>  <br>How is a transatlantic partnership different from a transatlantic partnership?</br>  <br>Its the same thing, different regions.</br>  <br>France censored sankaku channel and xbooru recently so no.</br>  <br>What did they censor?</br>  <br>They made the boorus unavailable for pedophilia.<br>It is now registered as a pedophile site.<br>Meanwhile a quarter of our politicians in the previous government were confirmed pedophile, ans the guy the socialist wanted as president a proven rapist.</br></br></br>  <br>that's covered in parody works.<br>You can't get in trouble for it.</br></br>  <br>You can't access them anymore because they were labeled as pedo site (but it's really easy to bypass).</br>  <br><br>Do they get put on a list for trying to access it?</br></br>  I don't see this as anything new.<br>The anime already lost ground and caved in to pressure against loli sexualization. It was inevitable the same happen to everything else too, sooner or later.</br>  <br>You can still have the flag. The current SCOTUS and ones in the past have been siding strongly on the side of free speech, check out Elonis v. United States that was decided a couple weeks ago. <br><br>The Government of whatever state decided it was imprudent to fly the Confederate battle flag. I don't live there, so fuck 'em.<br><br>The whole amazon/ebay thing is because some idiot gave SJWs internet, so they whine a lot, so Amazon/Ebay pulled the flags to avoid an unjustified shitstorm.<br>You can still fly your flag pretty much wherever the fuck you want as long as it doesn't block your neighbors view or reflect light into their house.<br><br>The administration may have gone to shit, but SCOTUS' zeal in defending free speech isn't going anywhere fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So basically, murricans ruinning it for everyone, as always.  <br>are you sure they'll be still be defending it in a couple of years? the phrase "your freedom ends where my feelings begin" may be a joke but honestly seems like things are going that way</br>  <br>I imagine anyone that accessed it before is on the list anyway.<br>Using TOR for anime will be a thing in my lifetime I guess.</br></br>  <br>I haven't used TOR in like 3 years, isn't it not safe as it's used to be? Where do I go to get caught up on information about it, keeping safe, and accessing certain things?</br>  <br>I don't know. If you try to access them without bypassing the censor, a text will apperas explaining that the site contains pedo stuff and that you may or may not be pursued.<br>So we don't know but I wouldn't be surprised if I was put on a list given how I go on sadpanda daily.</br></br>  <br>I have no idea, I didn't use it since lurk mode was a thing after a ban.</br>  <br><br>Requesting lewd images of the Funimation logo.</br></br>   illiterate dumbfucks actually think this is something to be concerned about <br> retards trying to use this to shill their tpp agenda <br><br>I know being stupid isn't a bannable offense, but holy shit there should be some sort of repercussions for being this much of a moron.</br></br></br>  <br>In all honesty, the SJW feelings train is a fad. It will have to die out eventually because it's not possible to have a productive society when everyone's a touchy parasite.<br><br>In '77 SCOTUS ruled that it was illegal for a predominantly Jewish city to prevent a National Socialist Party from doing a march. In addition they ruled that the swastika was an article of free speech and not considered "fighting words" (which aren't protected).<br><br>Considering that the US has practically the most liberal free speech constitution of any country, it is worrisome that we're the odd one out. However, it'll take quite a large event or a very long time for "fuck whitey" to be able to be said but displaying a certain flag be illegal.<br><br>If you displayed an IS flag on your porch, it would be hard to get you for it legally. For shit like that, they'd need to show that it was your intent to intimidate. As ruled in Virginia vs. Black, it's prosecutable to burn a cross with the intent to threaten another, but banning cross-burning is unconstitutional.<br>Of course, you'd be immediately be put on a watchlist for displaying IS flag, so I can't advise it. <br>On the other hand, please do fly it. I want to see how the court rules.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   live in england <br> could get sued by americans for downloading japanese media that the japanese don't care I'm downloading <br>Fuck this planet</br></br>  <br> England <br>I feel for you because I've heard that loli is considered pedo there.<br>And my country is slowly going there too <br>Fuck this world indeed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It also has the potential to allow the copyrighting of even genes. So if someone maps out the gene sequence of a seed, they could copyright nature itself. Monsato already kind of does this with terminating seeds where you only get one use out of them. They've "accidentally" put the seeds in farmer's fields and then sued the farmer for owning them. The TPP will give them a further reach and potentially allow them to force all farmers to use their seeds and purchase the seeds off them annually.<br><br>It could also mean fucking around with a lot of medical shit. So medicines could only be sold by one company with no off-brand alternatives which would make the price skyrocket, surgery techniques could mean only certain people could perform them, and doctors could be sued for doing anything that'd save a person but breaks any of this stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, loli falls under the same laws as 3D CP. Such a shit country with so many backwards laws that are incredibly outdated</br>  <br>I've also heard that your politicians are real pedo who don't give a shit about 2D loli but have molested, and more, real children.<br>Fucking hypocrites.</br></br>  <br>Of all the shit I've downloaded over the years, Funi is ONLY company to ever send me a letter through my cable company for downloading something. I had a roommate that downloaded DBZ and Bleach.<br>I tossed the letters in the trash every time they sent one.</br></br>  <br> /a/: "i don't understand lawyer-nese" </br>   FUNimation <br> FUN </br>  <br>This sounds like some Shadowrun shit. Better buy a shotgun and learn the name of a good streetdoc.</br>  <br>Yup, there have been lots of scandals over the last few years. Not just individual cases, full on pedo/grooming rings. And not just politicians, lots of celebrities who were previously seen as cherished public figures. And yet the politicians ignore that and come up with retarded laws to protect themselves, and the public just accepts it for the most part.</br>  <br>Don't worry they can't enforce it. They know it. They state it there. You're fine unless you're using Funimation trademark as a watermark.</br>  <br>Nobody even knows what is in the TPP but everone is an expert. There is a fuckton of misinformation and tinfoiler shit people keep repeating.<br>It will fuck over US jobs but that's about it. They only care about shit like bootlegs, and that's only because half the point of the TPP is to fuck over China.</br></br>  Good thing creative expression is free from all law.  <br>They'll have to at least go after a few people in order for it not to get cancelled. I suppose they'll just find a couple of shit-tier suckers who don't know about this.</br>  <br>Better safe than sorry.<br>If the TPP pass and it is actually fucking us over it will be too late. Backtracking will be impossible.<br>That's why people are assuming the worse and bitching.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would anyone even include 'funimation' anywhere near it? Funi is famous for its cancer.</br>  <br> note that the trademarks funimation is primarily concerned with are brand names and logos <br>pls read</br></br>  <br>They said it includes trademarks owned by them, so if someone puts the logo of the series on their art they'll go after them.</br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHA<br>Ok now I'll be sure to avoid putting logos of the series on my art. Not that I'd even bother.</br></br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I'm against the TPP, I'm just finding a lot of the panic to be both grating and ineffective.

MI magic is particularly taxing and her mother and grandpa already died from overusing MI magic. Honami died because she had no psions left, nothing Tatsuya can do at that point.</br>  <br><br><br>I hope Onii-sama forgives you.</br></br></br>  <br>Once he blows up the world, there will be no room for forgiveness.</br>  <br>There is always room for forgiveness with Onii-sama. Praise Onii-sama.</br>  <br>I'd pray that I'd never accidentally, bump into and knock her over or even touch his sister, they'd never find my body if he was there</br>  <br><br><br>Miyuki is for self-inserting</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Tatsuya is a boring robot, seriously who'd want to fuck him even by animu standards. His whole having a harem for no reason is precisely one of the reasons people claim he's a gary stu.</br>  <br>You know that Miya and Maya are identical twins, right? Obviously they are equally hot.</br>  <br>The difference is drills or no drills. Ayako is a mini Maya, Miyuki takes after Miya.</br>  <br>NTRd<br>T<br>R<br>d</br></br></br></br>  <br>Onii-sama was going for Mayumi</br>  <br>It's just an illusion. PTSD caught to CoD fag and this card is product of his LSD treatment.</br>  <br><br>the author gave him too many emotions here</br></br>  <br> NTRd <br> imblying <br>Masaki is the only one Onii-sama approved Miyuki's suitor.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Masaki: "Here, Shiba-san, your brother is 'this' way." <br> Miyuki: "Arigatou gozaimasu, Ichijou-san." <br>And they were never seen again.  And Mikihiko too. </br></br></br></br>  So. Any news about new volume?<br>Big T and Imoto-san are engaged for real?</br>  <br>Yes they are officially engaged. They will make it officially public in the 10MC meeting if I remember correctly.</br>    <br>Mistaking Mexican with argentinan <br><br> disgusting </br></br></br>  <br>Better win on saturday. Those refballrs will remain 0 copas. <br>Btw I remember an episode where onii-sama was playing soccer. How rektd did the other team get?</br></br>  <br>Not NTR . Only Shityuki wants her brother dick that much. Tatsuya is fine with his sister be with another man .</br>  <br><br>So i went over to jcafe and saw them post their progress so far<br><br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1R5xM1KoU6c7iWuH6T1Cp-A8bBV04EgHStk<wbr>z98XvOfmw/edit?pli=1<br><br>Why didn't you fags say anything about it?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh wow.<br>Dat cover.</br></br>  <br>Hah ...Count me out, i'm stop being care about this novel since vol 12, so it is not my fault that you fags don't know about it.</br>  <br> MI magic is particularly taxing and her mother and grandpa already died from overusing MI magic. <br><br>There's just the one issue where Miyuki's father was explicitly selected to produce children with insane psion counts. Just like Tatsuya, Miyuki has to do insane things to run low on psions.</br></br></br>  <br>I laughed</br>    <br><br> That Katsushige guy had magic sequences tatsuya was unable to keep up with <br><br><br>IT'S OVER</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Psions depletion and overuse are different things. She has a lot of psions, she can still overuse her magic and wear her body down like Miya. She has passed out from using Cocytus in succession.</br>  <br>Really? Tatsuya can "lose" potentially?</br>  <br>When worst comes to worst he can always nuke everything but that's still a draw.<br><br>But yeah, that issue was solved by Miyuki spamming liquid nitrogen.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuga Imoto-chan.</br>  <br>Since when can she do that? I understand Tatsuya being OP but Miyuki being so wonderful for no reason and butting in the fight really annoyed me.</br>  Yes I pray for a fucking S2.<br><br><br>That image is so fucking good.</br></br></br>  <br>I am conflicted between reading the LN or not.<br>On one hand it has ONI-SAMA, on the other hand it's kind of shitty since he is way too OP, also shitty incest.</br></br>  <br>Tats is not THAT op.<br>He is struggling every fucking fight, like hes came straight from Linkin Park song.</br></br>  Miyuki a shit  <br> He is struggling every fucking fight <br>How come? Isn't that just because he is holding himself? For example having a lot of his power sealed by Miyuki. If the fight is about even, I'd read the LN.</br></br>  <br>Yep, part of his powers is sealed by Miyuki. <br>Also, there are guys who can protect themselves against instant disintegration.<br>And his main power can wipe all the living shit off the face of Earth, but it's not very useful in a single combat.<br>He IS the most OP-genius-garystu-godly-magician-bl<wbr>ahblahblah, but at least he is not almighty and immortal. Tats is incapable of traditional magic. He's in losers class for a reason.</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nilfheim has always been able to freeze the nitrogen in the air. Usually this wasn't very relevant because by that time your body is already frozen solid.</br>  Being Frau is suffering.  Is the R;N anime good?  <br>Is decent.<br>No more than 7/10.<br>It falls flat delivering tension.<br><br><br>Also someone has the black and white CG about earth destruction?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This?</br>    What's difference between Revival Legacy and regular story?  Cucked till the very end  She should've stolen the kiss. They made a fucking kid get they still act like complete strangers?  <br>  they made a fucking kid <br> implying </br></br>  <br>She's the mother of his kid. Who cares if she didn't ge a kiss.<br>They fucked already</br></br>   /a/ BTFO in one chapter <br>heh</br>  <br><br> Implying it wasn't artificial insemination against sauce's will. </br></br>  <br>Did you even read the chapter.</br>  I did think that it was strange that the DNA graphs were exactly the same, but I chalked it up to Kishi being ignorant about it. Seems like I didn't give him enough credit.<br><br>Blame Suigetsu for everything</br></br>  <br> Sasuke still dumps his kid on Sakura and won't even kiss her goodbye <br>I don't think so</br></br>  <br>NS-tier delusion.</br>  <br>I seem to be missing something very obvious in this page. Someone care to fill me in?</br>  <br> delivered </br>  <br>he held back a grin when he turned around though!</br>  <br>Are you purposely baiting or do you not know what she meant by deliver?</br>  Is Kishy this autistic he can't draw his characters kiss?  <br>All asians are born with autism</br>  <br>They never ever kissed.</br>  <br>Sasuke still denies Sakura a kiss.</br>  <br>He didn't have a problem doing it back in chapter 3... Between two boys.<br><br>If he wanted some lip on lip action, he could've just drawn their the bottom halves of their bodies leaning in to kiss off-panel</br></br></br>  <br>Are you stupid?<br><br>What do you think DELIVER means you retard?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He smiled because he was amused, not because he was touched.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>But he never drawn a kiss between man and a woman, even between Tsunade and Dan or Minato and Kushina, not even in implied way like you suggest.</br>  <br>because that's dirty</br>  <br><br>Wait, but they're married, did they not kiss during their wedding? Sakura is going to turn into an unsatisfied housewife at this stage...</br></br>  <br>That was for a funneh joke, he can't draw an actuall romantic kiss. Only time man and woman's lips contacted in manga was for extremely unsexual CPR purpose.</br>  Sooooo, what about that guy who deleted and burned his whole SasuSaku collection?  <br>B T F O<br>T<br>F<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>let's hope he deleted himself as well</br>  <br> guy <br>There are guys that ship SS?</br></br>  <br> le lewd maymay <br>Fuck off you dumb fag.</br></br>     talk about how emotion is more important than genetics multiple times <br> throw it all away in the end and make it genetics anyways <br><br>it's hard work beating the genius all over again.</br></br></br>  <br>Real OTP</br>  <br>Genetics don't matter except when you need to prove they don't matter?</br>  <br> it's hard work beating the genius all over again. <br>I didn't understand why Kishi tried to prove this point with Neiji who was a genius and a hard worker.<br>Also Naruto never was a hard worker. He was a slacker to the core.</br></br></br>  <br> complaining about may mays <br> in a nurudu thread <br>bruh</br></br></br>  So, will Kabuto regret letting a horde of Uchiha test tube babies into his orphanage the next day?<br><br>Probably.</br></br>  <br> Sasuke is forgiven for everything again <br> the story still makes more sense if everyone was just lying that Karin wasn't the real mother <br><br>Quality writing<br><br><br><br>It does matter if you drive your own moral point home. Propaganda is useless otherwise</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying he won't be doing some Yamato-style experiments on them </br>   I will become Hokage <br><br>kek, Tobirama is spinning in his grave</br></br>  <br>I think Kishi just dared too much and he got some no nos by someone. There isn't any other explanation for contradicting previous chapters this bluntly. Not like I care, because I wanted to see Sarada being happy, but the exposition was fanfiction tier.</br>  <br> the story still makes more sense if everyone was just lying that Karin wasn't the real mother <br><br>No not really, since Sarada accepted Sakura as her mother without knowing the truth</br></br></br>  <br>They are delusional cuckfags who are mad Sakura fucked Sasuke. Laugh at them.</br>  <br>the nightmare never ends</br>  so sarada is sakura child?  <br>If Kishi cared abut the message. Sakura and Rock Lee would be the protagonists shitting on Naruto and Sasuke who never worked hard.</br>  <br>That's not the point. The explanation given still doesn't make sense regardless of whether Sarada would accept every outcome.<br><br>It makes so little sense they had to make up a KarinSaku friendship out of nowhere just to give it a semblance of logic</br></br></br>  <br>He even took in the giant fat one.<br><br>This orphanage will become a nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe, and also sasuke refuses to kiss cuckura</br>  <br>A fucking man-dragon runs the orphanage, do you think it's by any means NORMAL?<br><br>Also Kurama glaring at Shin and making him piss himself was awesome</br></br></br>  <br> KarinSaku friendship out of nowhere <br>Go read post-Danzo fight chapters.</br></br>  <br> that delusion </br>  <br> maybe <br><br>Dude, its over. Just accept it and move on. Karin deserves better than Saucegay anyway</br></br></br>  <br> Go read post-Danzo fight chapters. <br>No you don't get it. It doesn't matter that they became friends before the Gaiden, it is fact that Salad had NEVER met Karin for her 12 years of existence. That is just STRANGE for a family friend.</br></br>  <br>Indeed it does feel like a cop out, but then again Karin connected with Sakura's feelings when she was pierced by Sauce so it's not that unbelievable.<br><br>There are still much more things that don't make sense in previous chapters though and are never addressed. I stand by my point in that Kishi got told to change the ending.</br></br></br>  <br> The explanation given still doesn't make sense <br>It actually makes perfect sense, the characters have come to their own realization while the viewer is gifted a peace of mind that doesn't affect the characters decisions <br><br>Stop being mad that your "le epic cuck may may" shit got blown away</br></br></br></br>  He looks disgusted, haha. Don't blame him, though.  <br>Yes.<br><br>Karin got over Sasuke and became Sakura's lesbian lover and delivered her child when she was in larbor. They meet secretly like Naruto and Sasuke do for trysts.</br></br></br>  <br>you forget this</br>  Did Vegeta ever kiss Bulma?   cuckfags cucked by Kishimoto <br><br>Good. You ruined the threads with your epic mamay</br></br>  <br><br>No, fuck you. Seriously, even thinking that justifies such hamfisted exposition and a blatant case of telling and not showing should get you a slap. I know you have some vendetta against "cuckfags" but don't justify FF.net level writing</br></br>  <br> Karin got over Sasuke and became Sakura's lesbian lover <br>Korra/Assami ending when?</br></br>  <br>That's a really good point actually.</br>  <br>This<br>Cuckfags are the worst</br></br>  <br> she wanted the d <br>common sasugay, dafug</br></br>  <br>She didn't even met Naruto up close before, this gaiden was the first time she was in his vicinity despite him being best friend of her parents living in the same village, and you're questioning why she didn't know about that one friend of her mother that works for dr. Mengele somewhere far away?</br>  <br>Kishi said he was embarrassed to do romantic scenes more than once.<br><br>He still dedicated all his romantic scenes to two couples: Kushina and Minato and Sasuke and Sakura.<br><br>Hinata and Naruto relied on animated filler because he didn't touch that shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  What if Boruto    <br> yfw Karin saves up the umbilical cord because it's Sakura's child and not Sasuke's <br><br>New InoxSakura.</br></br></br>   Sarada went on a life-threatening quest where she avoided being abducted by onions, stabbed by her father, getting too close to Ninja Mengele, getting hit by friendly fire in an all-scale battle against the most hilariously underwhelming bad guy of the series, just because pic related thought that "Your mother gave birth to you outside the village and was helped by a close friend of hers who was also Sasuke's comrade at some point" was too much of a truth to tell <br><br>sa<br>su<br>ga</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's not a phase dad, this is who I really am</br>  <br>Oh sorry. I forgot the best couple.<br><br> Haku and Zabuza. </br></br></br>  so what was the real story? I want to keep up with the cuckening but i dont' want to actually have to read this tripe.  <br>Shizune just wanted the little uchiha shit to suffer and hopefully run away and die.</br>  <br>Shizune is the new Aoba</br>  <br>Was it ever in question whose kid Trunks was?</br>  <br><br>Karin and Sakura are best friends (and possibly lesbian lovers) and Karin helped her deliver Sarada when Sasuke was trapped in another dimension.<br><br>Karin got to keep Sarada's umbilical cord as a precious memory from Sakura. She's been over Sasuke for a while.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uchiha fucking shits <br>Tobirama was right<br> God I'm pretty <br> I wish I had a boyfriend <br> Start a eugenics program of my own <br>Don't bully Shizune, it's not her fault she suddenly became a massive retard</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Probably not on screen. He acted like a big tsundere most of the time but was also her stay at home husband and paid some attention at least to his kids.</br>  <br>Picture rabid SS fans, done? Now they have to write an alternative ending while trying not to disregard stuff that happened in earlier chapters. That's basically today's chapter.</br>  <br> but was also her stay at home husband and paid some attention at least to his kids. <br><br>Only after a while. <br><br>Sasuke's busy on a mission, once the Boruto movie ends, he'll likely go home.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see you're just going toss out any criticism fanfic tier drama as "lel, cuckfags mad," but here's your reply.<br><br>It has nothing to do with what Sarada realized or didnt, there are literally no consequences to anything that transpired on the cuck plot end and the previous chapters don't make sense with the explanation given. The explanation was also so incredibly contrived that it boggles the mind even more.</br></br></br>  Oh man.  <br>It was Sarada's umbilical cord Suigetsu tested. Karin delivered her when Sakura gave birth. Suigetsu is a fucking idiot.</br>  <br> mad cuckfag <br><br>Anon, everyone sane told you it's going to be a misunderstanding. You refused to face reality.</br></br></br>  why do you guys expect Sasuke to behave like a normal person, when he had such a fucked up childhood and never had an healthy relationship with anyone for years?, I mean he killed his brother and tried to kill his best friend, him being an akward autist, makes totally sense.<br><br>And Sakura probably raped him and that is why there was no kiss.</br></br>  Soooo, now the Uchiha clan is finally restored?  <br> , there are literally no consequences to anything that transpired on the cuck plot <br><br>It was only forced drama to have Sarada wander and find Sasuke. GOD YOU'RE FUCKING STUPID.</br></br></br>  <br>This is Kishi. Expecting things to make sense and not be completely retarded is asking for too much. Still, I'm glad because the gaiden shat on SS so hard, it looks ridiculous, with or without Salad being Sakura's.</br>  <br>Aren't people going to try to kidnap them for free sharingan research or something?</br>  <br> that one Shin outside the orphanage, alone and rejected by all </br>  <br><br>Not him, but how does that change the fact that the story is garbage?</br></br>  <br> when he had such a fucked up childhood and never had an healthy relationship with anyone for years? </br>  Sauce's face while having dinner with his family is hilarious<br> Shut up shitpink <br> Shut up mini me <br> Gosh, I hate these people </br></br></br>  <br>Because /a/ thinks Sasuke is like that because he likes it and refuse to understand dude is fucked up.<br><br>He's just fucked in the head in some aspects.</br></br></br>  <br>kid Trunks is the son of future Trunks and Bulma.</br>  <br>Which is why its a bad story. That ks for proving my point. Nobody's mad about being wrong.</br>  <br>Feels good that he's still a freakish snake man with all his powergaming bodymods.</br>  Sarada: Sakura + Sasuke<br>Boruto: Sasuke + Naruto<br>Mitsuki: Sai<br><br>Hinata confirmed as irrelevant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta was a good dad</br>  <br><br><br><br>Morons not knowing that a mother can also deliver a baby.<br>It means to assist as well as doing it yourself you fucking NEETs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Their Japanese though so it's not actually needed for them to kiss.</br>  <br>It's typical Naruto writing.</br>  <br>Wow, what a revelation.<br><br>Breeding mare character is irrelevant! Must alert the presses.<br><br>She was always irrelevant you retard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it took him years, dying one and a second kid to rehabilitate.<br><br><br><br>its not only about his past, he fucked himself up as well, you know, that is why I posted batman.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So, now that Obito and Madara are out of the question and Orochimaru refuses to come back to Konoha, who else could we get to look over the orphans? <br> Hmm, how about the dragon sage freak who helped Obito start the war and revived Madara? <br> Oh yeah, that's a brilliant idea Hokage-sama </br></br></br>  <br>And that is the problem.</br>  <br>Japanese weddings don't require a kiss.<br>All one has to do is send the document to the city hall along with changing the family register and you're done.<br>Ceremonies and the kiss aren't a matter of law.</br></br></br>  <br><br>*dying once</br></br>  <br><br>Kabuto is like the 4th or 5ht strongest person alive.<br><br> Naruto <br> Sasuke <br> Rock Lee (assuming he knows the 8th gate) <br> Kabuto or Killer B <br>Hilarious power gap<br> everyone else </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cuckfag still ddesperately grasping for straws <br>Sorry, it's over. The jig is up, as much as we hate it</br></br>  <br>Vegeta was a better father to Trunks those seven years Goku was gone than Sasuke was for twelve<br><br>Hell, Karin is a better parent to Sarada than Sasuke</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru might be stronger than him, he took his own power away from him after all</br>  <br> You have to be a cuckfag to point out someones wrong. </br>  <br> having the reading comprehension of a 10 year old. </br>  So that's it right?<br><br>It's over? No more Naruto?</br></br>  <br>Karin and Pink should have just shacked up. Karin seems like she would have just told Salad rather than make sad faces at her or destroy her home.</br>  <br> Karin deserves better than Saucegay anyway <br>Indeed. And was I the only one who thought about Suigetsu hitting on Karin there?</br></br>  <br>Isn't that Kabuto's brother from the previous orphanage?</br>  <br>You sat for 700 chapters about how hard work trumps all where the characters who got the spotlight were reincarnated gods with special bloodlines and powers while the characters who actually worked hard (Sakura and Lee) jobbed or got shat on.<br><br>And do you complain about the Gaiden? You only have yourself to blame.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking how funny would be if Bulma schooled Vegeta for the people he killed in the tournament, and he was just like "Yeah...Sorry".</br>  Is there a worse ending than this?  <br> 2015 <br> people still believe the whole "hard work is the central theme of naruto" biz <br>It was just Neji's mini-arc during chunin exams</br></br></br>  <br> they left the big fat motherfucker outside the orphanage </br>  <br> Karin and Pink should have just shacked up <br><br>Are you implying they aren't? Sasuke and Naruto are obviously gay. I wouldn't be shocked if Bolt was the son of Naruko and Sasuke while a shadow clone fucked Hinata for Himawari.<br><br>They get secret temple meetings while Sakura and Karin get secret mountain meetings. Sakura passed out stressed Sarada figured it out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This whole plot depended on any character who could explain thing within four panels or less being missing or suddenly stricken with autism<br><br>Honestly, this is part of the problem with serials too. They have to leave every chapter ending with suspense in order to keep people reading. Had Kishi just written this and published it in one go, he might have done it a little less incompetently</br></br></br>  <br> This is the closest we'll get to Sasuke earnestly smiling </br>  <br>What if, it was all a ploy to activate the Sharingan?</br>  <br><br>I actually feel sorry for him, he was also punched in the face by Susanoo.</br></br>  <br> mfw Naruto went full on Operation Paperclip </br>  <br> Suigetsu is a fucking idiot. <br>Come on, don't blame that he simply didn't knew everything. It's not like Karin told him what's in there. She literally said that the desk is "part of her".</br></br>  Did somebody replace the "I'll see you next time" panel with "yeah...sorry" ?  niggastream is out    <br>He smiled when he tapped Sakura's forehead and Sarada's.</br>  <br> thinken of Itachi </br>  This nigga can do whatever he wants as long as he pokes a head afterwards  <br><br>only that Sasuke is doing something usefull and hunting the last members of akatsuki, Vegeta only cared about being better than Goku and I guess you forgot how he went full edge and let himself willingly get controled only to achieve a higher powerlevel.<br><br>Sasuke may be akward around his wife and daughter but that is only because he obviously never thought he'd have a happy live with wife and kids in the first place, also all the things he has done and that happened to him, he is really fucked up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is "tapping a forehead" the only form of bonding Sasuke knows? <br>Does he do that with everyone?</br></br>  <br>Vegeta still stayed home</br>  <br>And yet Kabuto still possess snake features, so it didn't worked that hard. He still has DNA of Sound 5, his own Dragon Sage Mode and a lot of Orochimaru's DNA anyway. <br>Add to that Karin's self-healing from her DNA and self-taught Suigetsu-like liquidation that he gained simply by being awesome at analysis. Just like analysis of Juugo's power allowed him to find Ryuuchido.<br>He's still one of the strongest people alive.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Itachi's gesture and it basically means "sorry, i don't have any time for you right now. cya later maybe". <br>Sakura thinks it's affectionate though.</br></br>  <br><br>because he could train there, he was training elswhere when Trunks was born and as I said, Sasuke is actually doing useful stuff.</br></br>  <br> implying he wasn't legitimate happy here </br>  Karin wasnt salads mother<br><br>she just <br> Delivered her <br><br>fucking RUSE</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> useful stuff <br> wandering round the woods looking for aliens </br></br>  <br>Vegetables did a whole lot worse shit than Sasuke did so him being expected to have darkness still in his heart was expected. He was actually conflicted because his family life clashed with his warrior prince who exterminates worlds persona.<br><br>But that wasn't the point. Sasuke avoids his family for 12 years and comes back for one night when it finally dawns on him that maybe his family needs him once in awhile while he's waiting for the plot to catch up to him. Vegeta was at least involved enough in his son and wife's life that it caused huge problems inside him. Point is, Sasuke having a rough life doesn't excuse him, maybe his job does, but that's another argument entirely</br></br></br>  <br>yes.<br>he probably does it with his dick after he's finished banging the street whores.</br></br>  Is there anyone who reads moon here? I'm trying to understand what Karin said.<br><br> サクラはサスケを追いかけて一緒に旅してた時期があってウチのアジトでサ<wbr>ラダちゃん産まれたんだから</wbr> <br> copypasted romaji from google translate <br> Sakura wa Sasuke o oikakete issho ni tabi shi teta jiki ga atte uchi no ajito de sarada-chan uma reta ndakara <br><br>So it says that Sakura chased after Sasuke, but did she eventually catch up with and travel with him, or did she travel with Karin?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Not only forgives orochimaru <br> But also make Kabuto the leader of an actual public organization <br>Literally USA-tier politics</br></br>  KISHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<br>fucking ruse master</br>  <br>yeah<br>sorry</br></br>  <br>Sakura and Sasuke only talked like twice in the series and only ever about Naruto, so it's no wonder Kishimoto doesn't know how to write them together. <br><br>Probably the same reason why Hinata never shows up, he has no idea how to write them together because they never had any chemistry in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>She traveled with Karin, who helped her deliver Salad then took her home. <br>She then proceeded to stick her picture over Karin's next to Sasuke.</br></br>  <br> wandering round the woods looking for aliens <br><br>yeah and he found the cone army of the evil guys.<br><br><br><br>only that Vegeta was raised to be the evil asshole he was, so him doing bad stuff doesn't fuck him up as much as someone who had a happy childhood and suddenly his brother kill everyone for some complicated reasons, that fucked Sasuke up even more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forever cuck<br>I want to be forever cuck</br></br>  <br>She's shit tier</br>  <br><br>Not only that but<br> itachi slaughters uchihas <br> Kabuto now has an orphanage chock full of highly adaptive sharingan-using onion kids <br>The suffering never ends.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  best friends </br>  So Karin is a wizard? Wasted.  <br>*clone army</br>  <br>He at least wrote a few pages of NH going on a date that wasn't nearly as awkward as Sasuke awkwardly dodging Sakura's affections.</br>  <br> She then proceeded to stick her picture over Karin's next to Sasuke. <br><br>Sasuke and Sakura truly deserve each other,</br></br></br>  I wonder what Sakura would have told Sauce if the baby died during childbirth<br> I know it was irresponsible to just out into the woods for weeks while highly pregnant but I really wanted to see you! </br>  <br><br> all the retards that thought Sarada might not be Sakura's child <br> all the mad NH shippers that hate the canon SS pairing <br> people still mad that Sakura cucked Naruto for her true love Sasuke <br> people thinking it would be about sth. else than Sharingan and Team 7 <br><br><br>It could not have been better. All the delicious tears. Perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  so why the fuck was the DNA test wrong or whatever  <br>It wasn't<br><br>It was Sarada's umbilical cord all along</br></br></br>  <br>NH shippers are just the very best.<br> Enough with the Uchiha/Team7, we want Himawari and Hinata! <br>kek, like Kishi gives a fuck about them.</br></br></br>  <br> Tobirama returns by summoning himself via Edo Tensei to once and for all put an end to the Uchiha madness <br>Tobirama hiden when?</br></br>  <br>if only you were so lucky.</br>  <br><br> SS relationship still the worst in manga and sasuke took off again not even wanting to kiss his ugly wife <br> SSfags are denied of sakura in charge of sasuke like a strong woman and she still looks like a bitch putting her head down after failing to get even a simple kiss <br><br><br>Well it could have been better but I'm pretty satisfied.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The enemy literally fell into sasuke's lap<br><br>Also, about Vegeta, it is still kind of sad that Vegeta was practically raised evil and still managed to be as good of a father as he was. Toriyama at least knows how to redeem a villain.<br><br>But all this doesn't matter. The only reason they gave for Sasuke's neglect was his "work" which doesn't make sense. He can be little emotionally distant or scarred, but there was nothing stopping from dropping by now and again</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> implying you fags weren't on suicide watch for the last few weeks </br></br>    <br> implying I'm a shipper </br>  <br>Praise niggastream for making this more bearable</br>  <br> short shorts <br> punk sideshave <br> open shirt exposing belly <br>Karin always looks great.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that translation <br>never change niggerstream, never change</br></br>  <br>Niggerstream is fucking wrong, I posted the Japanese dialogue. A mission involving Sauce/Pink/Karin is never mentioned.</br>  <br>Seriously kabuto looks creepy, I can't stop laughing. Holy shit</br>  For whatever reason, the new anime ED centers around the ramen shop.  Kabuto in charge of a personal harem of uchiwa kids is the best part of this crap  <br>"Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. maybe. Ignore my snake-like appearance"</br>  <br>Swinging off of Sasuke's what?</br>  <br>Karin looks like a freaking Tumblrite. I blame the Ninja world's exposure to the internet.</br>  <br>You have to know many things in Japanese are implied and gathered from the context.</br>  <br>Reminder that was Itachi's mindrapping session fault</br>  <br>All crimes against humanity and nature are frogiven!</br>  <br> The entire message of the manga is that hard work prevails regardless of your status <br> Naruto is literally the reincarnation of da best ninja evarrrr <br>the master</br></br></br>  <br> fucking senju privilege </br>  <br>just like Naruto's life</br>  Goodbye  <br>When Orochimaru was revived by Sasuke, didn't he take back all of his chakra from Kabuto who was still trapped in Izanami, reverting him back to human form?<br><br>The next time you see Kabuto in the manga after Orochimaru took back his chakra, he revives Sasuke who was stabbed in the heart by Madara, but Kabuto has regained the snake-dragon form. Maybe I'm missing something.</br></br></br>   it was sakura daugther <br>How boring, and predictable of kishimoto the ultimate hack.<br>Dropped again like I dropped this 11 years ago.</br></br>  <br> Naruto is literally the reincarnation of da best ninja evarrrr <br><br>That's Sasuke. Hagoromo literally said Naruto's strength are friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru only took away his own chakra stored inside Kabuto, he still had all the other shit implanted in him</br>  <br>manga Salad &gt; movie Salad</br>  <br><br>Kabuto literally gets what oro wanted handed to him in bulk.</br></br>  <br>And he is still stronger than sauce, just like Hashirama was stronger than Madara</br>  <br><br>They're not really uchiha though. <br><br>They're just clones of some guy who had good compatibility with their eyes. So normal risks of them going insane.</br></br></br></br>  I like how the last chapter confirmed that not all women timeskip are birthing tools, with Ino actually being in her combat uniform after a mission.<br><br>Kind of ironic, of all people in the end to look useful.</br></br>  <br>A mission between all three of them is not what's implied. It very clearly says that Sakura chased Sasuke, they weren't already together and she refused to leave.</br>  <br>I'll be sad when the movie is over and there will be no more Naruto threads to discuss Tobirama in anymore. The whole manga should have just been around him and Madara beating the shit out of each other.</br>  <br> Naruto's strength are friends <br>That doesnt mean that he needs his friends to win. Simply that they are his motiviation for improving. Indras/Sasukes were power and revenge.</br></br>   giving orochimaru and kabuto a mass supply of sharingans <br> essentially bringing back the uchiha en masse <br> sasuke dodges a kiss from sakura like she's gonna spit acid on him <br> nothing naruto said to salad even mattered <br> karin cares more about sakura and salad than sasuke <br><br>Hilarious chapter A+++</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt Sasuke thinks he is any good for his own daughter.</br></br>  <br>Which Madara are we talking about?</br>  <br>It doesn't really matter, it's the end.</br>  <br>This page was even funnier than Sakura getting ignored to the very end. Both Huge Shin outside and Kabuto being put in charge of the orphanage and still looking all fucked up snake sage mode. I wonder if he still has that lewd snake growing out of his gut?<br><br>Well done, Kishi!</br></br></br>  <br>Fucking niggastream lying through their teeth.<br>See サクラはサスケを追いかけて一緒に旅してた時期があってウチのアジトでサラ<wbr>ダちゃん産まれたんだか<br>Sakura was chasing after Sasuke's dick, pregnant, nowhere does it say she was with him. They've done it several times in the gaiden, trying to paint SS in a more positive light. Obviously the translator is a nigger SSfag.</br></wbr></br></br>  <br>So like, they're just gonna listen to him?<br><br>This plot point is retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Bulma has worlds more backbone than Sakura. When Vegeta wasn't around, you didn't see her pining after him or searching for him all over the universe.</br>  <br><br>That is fucking retarded. I don't know why people think because he had a fox in his belly he didn't work hard. BY HIMSELF. <br><br>Especially after the series started. Having a bazooka won't really help you in an enclosed space, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wouldve checked out the movie and some other stuff.<br>It just ends the same shit it became after exams, predictable safe crap.</br></br>  <br><br>He doesn't look well at all.</br></br>  <br>Basically Ashura was a late bloomer faggot that needed support from friends until the endgame fight with Indra.<br><br>Indra had all these talents in him since day one, while Ashura had to work continuously towards it.</br></br></br>  <br>SSfag, pls. Karin isn't even a Konoha shinobi, why would she do a mission with them? The raw is as explicit as it gets. Sakura chased after Sasuke and she and Karin travelled together. Can't wait for Viz to btfo you cunts, like the entire gaiden did on your pathetic ship.</br>  <br><br>Never thought I'd see the day where panda is more accurate than niggerstream..</br></br>  Hope Naruto will give all the little Onions jobs in the civil service department. Would be hilarious if the cops and nurses all looks the same, just like in pokemon.<br><br>Bet Kabuto is grabbing baby name books right now.</br></br>  <br><br> &gt;"You little shits don't really think you stand a chance, do you?" </br></br>  <br>Actually 90% of the time, MP is way closer to the meaning in moon than whatever MS pulls out of their ass, it's just that their scans are shitty and they're sometimes too literal but apart from a few mistakes (often because of context, from what I could see) they're way more reliable than fucking niggastream.</br>  <br>And thats why they were the best couple compared to those two examples.<br><br>I mean for fuck's sake Minato killed himself just to get out of being a single dad.</br></br></br>  <br> Tobirama and Madara beating each other senseless <br> for 700 chapters <br> while shittalking each other <br>That would have actually been far better than the original plot</br></br></br></br>  <br>And then he's off to buy ninja cigarettes again. Just about every mother fucker in Naruto gets away from the consequences of their actions.</br>  <br>And I'm not talking about Edo Tensei Uchiha Madara</br>  <br>It isn't even about being good or bad. He just lacks the balls</br>  I'm just glad Sarada is happy  <br>reference to that eating contest omake?</br>  <br>Tobirama lost. Sarada will be Hokage and Uchihas are back. Such a useless and failed character, I almost feel pity for him.</br>  <br>Seriously, this ending makes no sense, why couldn't Sakura/Shizune have just told her this to begin with?<br><br>Kishi is a hack</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he has a forehead fetish thanks to Itachi.</br>  so karin is lesbian for sakura or what?<br><br>Also more importantly, why was everyone acting like Salads birth was such a huge secret? Why couldn't they just have told her "You were born while Sakura was traveling with a friend to find your father"<br>Also what is up with the similarities between Salad and Karin? Just a coincidence?<br><br>You have got to be shitting me kishimoto</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it wouldn't even make sense and it would be <br>the most retarded shitwriting he has ever done.</br></br></br>  <br> Sarada will be Hokage </br>  <br> and Uchihas are back <br><br>Shins aren't uchihas. They're clones some guy who had zero chance of rejecting implants. <br><br>If they reproduce, their kids won't be uchiha.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> All those bowels for Hinata <br>closet fatass.<br> FAPFAPFAPFAPFAP </br></br></br>  <br><br>I always felt the side characters in the series were more interesting than team seven</br></br>  <br>I think this is a case of the editor's running damage control. I think that Kishi fully meant for it to be Karin's kid, but the editors were terrified of the backlash.<br>It would have been glorious</br></br>  <br>YEAH SORRY</br>  <br>Who else besides Bolt can even compete with an Uciha's Hax eyes?</br>  <br>Well, those breasts have to come from somewhere</br>  <br>No wonder he's into Sakura.</br>   the mother traditionally keeps the umbilical cord <br> it's in Karin's office <br>Salad confirmed for two mommies.</br></br>  <br>It goes straight to her tits, dummy</br>  <br><br>All shit posting aside this was honestly better than the last 200 chapters of Naruto</br></br>  <br><br>The alien villains.</br></br>  <br>She will never unlock the MS, so she is way below Burritos power level</br>  <br>They're clones made of Uchiha genes, therefore they're Uchihas.

Good riddance. Hyuuga master race confirmed.</br>  <br> closet fatass. <br>Not if they can't fit through the doors.<br> Also they're fucking ninjas, they run about and fight and stuff all day, no way they'll hold onto the calories.  except that one guy who's family was hated by dieticians because of their one weird trick to lose 100lbs instantly - Click HERE to find out more.  </br></br></br>  <br>damn no more best girl</br>  <br>It doesn't matter. It's how Kishi handles romance. It's not that they are bad, it's that Kishi wanted to be the one fleshing them up.</br>  <br>That would probably be awesome.<br><br>It'd be like Jesus vs Hitler: The mango.<br><br>Would totally read.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>welp, better to live one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep</br>  <br>Practically everyone. Uchiha by themselves are pretty much trash unless they get MS but then they go blind and they fucked. Do you honestly see Sarada stealing someone's eye? Yea she'll cap at about Hinata level and Boruto will just surpass use his superior genetics to muscle his way in.</br>  <br><br>The way kishi wrote this gaiden, had he gone all the way the plot of the gaiden in particular would have made more sense even if it seemed a little weird after chapter 699</br></br>  <br>That delusion, is that before or after the infinite tsukiyomi is released?</br>  <br> karin cares more about sakura and salad than sasuke <br>You don't usually care much about people who stabbed you with massive electrical blades and then asked someone else to finish you off.</br></br>  <br><br>Naruto's, Sasuke's and Sakura's marriages are cover for their homosexual escapes.</br></br>  <br> Uchiha by themselves are pretty much trash <br>Where have you been during the last 700+10 chapters?</br></br>   mfw Sakura x Karin confirmed OTP.   <br>I was ready for a stupid misunderstanding and ridiculous contrivances.

Read the manga. They're clones of some random guy whose genetic structure wouldn't reject any organs with implanted eyes. The elder Shin had also oro's original sharingan arm which was also used on danzou.</br></br></br>  <br>Karin actually cares a lot about Sasuke. She said she only wants to see him happy no matter what.</br>  <br>Where were you when 99% of the Uchiha were wrekt in a single night but a guy who objectively wasn't even that strong?</br>  <br> I think that Kishi fully meant for it to be Karin's kid, <br><br>He and his assistant were the first one says Karin had NOTHING to do with Salad when 700 was out. It's Nasu trolling the shit of NS and SK shippers who wrote insults on that tribute to the end of Naruto because he's based.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they are bad, because Kishimoto is a terrible writer</br>  <br>All Panda really needs is a fucking editor and then we won't have to feel the pain of Sabo and Issho victory.</br>  <br><br>And by original I mean the original idea oro drew up for danzou concerning that arm.</br></br>  <br>Meant to quote &gt;&gt; </br>  <br> bowels <br>Yes, and they'll all be clogged up after that much ramen.</br></br>  <br> Every cloned Shin comes with a Sharingan <br> They're totally not Uchihas <br>How stupid are you exactly?</br></br></br>  <br>What now?<br>I thought Kishi wanted to show with Karin how obsession about a guy can be unhealthy, yet she got over him and the SasuSaku pairing is ok?<br>Did Kishi forgot every new chapter what he previously wrote?</br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING SHIT.<br><br>What about INO?</br></br></br>  <br> who objectively wasn't even that strong <br>Implying Itachi wouldnt have reached Madara levels if he hadnt been suffering from AIDS.</br></br>  <br> implying Sakura didn't give Karin that chord out of sheet spite to say "this is all you get of Sasuke, hoe <br> Sakura didn't value Karin's friendship enough to keep her picture unedited or ever mention her to Sarada <br><br>Karin is the real victim here</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't write romance into your story if you can't be bothered to flesh it out. That IS bad writing.</br>  <br> kabut was once an orphan who lost his way to protect people dear to him <br> goes total haywire in 600 chapters <br> gets trapped in eternal genjutsu that only deavtivates when you see your own mistakes and realize who you really are <br> he remembers that hes an orphan and all that beginning shit <br> is now a good guy <br><br>tbh its more trustworthy than sasuke</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who could kill sauce in this new peace world? <br> Why would Sarada kill him herself? <br> Why would she implant them in herself? </br></br></br>  <br> Karin grew a dick from Sasuke's genes and impregnated Sakura <br><br>There you go, all issues resolved.</br></br></br>  <br> Karin actually cares a lot about Sasuke. <br><br>She's covering up her lesbianism.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Have technology to clone shins <br> Can't clone eyes <br><br>Please.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maximum pottery.</br>  <br> Itachi AND Obito weren't even that strong <br>Yeah, it's not like they were some of the strongest characters in the manga or anything, not to mention that they sneak killed the clan.</br></br>  <br> Did Kishi forgot every new chapter what he previously wrote? <br><br>Yes. For example, what was the point of that filler villian mentioning Itachi and the Akatsuki?</br></br></br>  <br>The irony in that statement.</br>  <br> Why would Sarada kill him herself <br>MS isnt triggered from YOU killing someone, faggot. Its triggered by you losing a person valuable to you.</br></br>  <br>He did once</br>  <br> a guy who objectively wasn't even that strong? <br><br> the guy that made Orochimaru, Kakashi, edo Nagato, Sasuke and Kabuto his bitches <br> not strong </br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds like a good doujin material</br>  If Sakura was the mother all along, why were the adults acting all suspicious when Sarada asked about? 90% if the shit in Gaiden wouldn't have happen if they just told her that she was born outside the village.<br><br>Was it just Kishi's piss poor excuse for cheap drama?</br></br>  <br>See, that I could understand Shizune and Sakura being uncomfortable telling the kid.<br><br>Would also explain why despite being Sasuke's "wife" she's never even been kissed by him.</br></br></br>  <br>Shin's tissues are special that way.</br>  <br>A win-win-win. This should be canon.</br>  <br>So it means that SAkura is not cuckold?<br><br>I FUCKEN MAD NOW!!!111</br></br></br>  <br>When Kabuto injected his prestige class 'Roach, he gained the feat Can't Poach the 'Roach. This made him unpoachable.</br>  Everyone with a brain knew from the beginning it was a MISUNDERSTANDING XD.<br>You only have yourselves to blame if you believed this shit.</br>  <br>Shoulda woulda coulda. Objectively in the grand scheme of things he wasn't that strong yet he still fucked the entire Uchiha in a single night by himself.</br>  <br>Kishi is super gay, thats why he acts so uncomfortable when it comes to straight romance, he just can't perceive it personally.<br><br>His marriage is a sham</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck was Sakura doing chasing after Sasuke when she's about to pop Sarada out?</br>  <br>Kishi thought it wouldn't feel right if his husbando didn't get name dropped in the gaiden</br>   giving someone your umbilical cord as a souvenir <br><br>I guess it's a Japanese thing.</br></br>  <br> Shin's tissues are special that way. <br><br>Now you're just making shit up. If you could rewrite genetics to the point where you could make any human genetic makeup develop a sharingan, you wouldn't even need a shin. <br><br>A hair from sasuke would let oro make tons of sasuke clones.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How on earth did they have sex?</br>  <br>That doesn't matter, the writing was still terrible and this ending makes no sense, why couldn't Sakura or Shizune have revealed all this at the start?<br><br>Glad I wasn't reading the individual chapters personally.</br></br></br>  <br>But he didn't work hard, not consistently at least cause look what happened when he did. Wen't from shit to as good as Prodigy Sasuke in a few months, Naruto was more talented than Sasuke and Neji combined.<br>And even then his hard work was only in short burst to learn something.</br></br>  <br>Yep, your NTR fantasies have been dashed.</br>  <br>Itachi got roflstomped as an immortal clone by Naruto like nothing. Obito was trained by the strongrst Uchiha alive for years and augmented with a shitton of other things. By themselves without the darkness I doubt he woulda been that strong.<br><br><br>Name one Uchiha other than Madara who did it that way?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>it was only about how Sarada at the end didn't care if Sakura was her biological mother or not.</br></br>  <br>Skrillex?</br>  <br>The writing was terrible all throughout, you just didn't care because le cuck meme.</br>  <br>Why would Karin save the umbilical cord?</br>  <br>She's a lesbian and into Karin.</br>  <br> Everyone with a brain knew from the beginning it was a MISUNDERSTANDING XD. <br>Yet most SasuSaku shippers already considered suicide. That was actually worth it.<br><br>By the way. Any tumplr crops about how they knew from the start that it was a misunderstanding and how awesome Kishis story is, despite all that bullshit that he pulled out of his ass, making this misunderstanding actually believable?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never cared about the mommy issue, I enjoyed the Sakura trashing throughout the gaiden and Kishi shitting on SS harder than any ASS would hope for. Honestly, everyone knew since ch700 that Salad was Sakura's but not even die hard anti SSfags expected things to be that pathetic with Sasuke being a deadbeat, Sakura chasing after his dick even heavily pregnant, them not having a single picture together, Salad not meeting her dad for a decade etc. I don't understand how SS fangirls can rejoice over that because I know for a fact that they all expected a happy ending with papa Suke staying at home and being there for his princesses but got him being a nigger dad and Sakura all alone for years.</br>  <br><br>And now I want to eat salad. With ranch dressing.</br></br>  <br>Karin implies she was chasing him for months because she was with Karin "for a while."</br>  <br> Itachi got roflstomped as an immortal clone by Naruto like nothing. <br><br>No he didn't. He also beat Nagato all by himself.</br></br></br>  I am confused.<br>Who is the real mother and why does she look like Karin?<br><br>Why did this hack mangaka get so famous?</br></br></br>  How can Kishi be so based. He trolled the NSfags, NTRfags, SS and in one chapter.  <br>Sasukes MS was so fucking delayed that it wouldnt make sense to say that him killing Itachi triggered it. What triggered it was the realization that his brother died.<br><br>Same applies for Obito who trigger his MS seeing Rin die and holding her in her arms. Unless Kakashi triggered it from killing her which I find highly unlikely that a non Uchiha can awaken MS on his own.</br></br></br>  <br>Because muh connections.</br>  <br>He is a snake charmer</br>  <br> Who is the real mother <br>Sakura, that imbilical cord was Sakura and Saradas it got left there as a memento from the delivery because Karin delivered the baby.<br><br> why does she look like Karin? <br>Honestly you're fucking blind if you think she looks like Karin, Sarada is basically a clone of her mother with black hair.<br><br> Why did this hack mangaka get so famous? <br>Weabs mostly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura's the mother. Karin's her lesbian lover.</br>   All those "two mommies" fags here <br>I want /u/ to  stay </br>  I don't understand how SSfags can even exist. Sakura's whole character arc was about how SS was shit. Now they get married, and lo and behold, it's still shit.  <br>  the desk was a part of her <br>  contained Salad umbilical cord <br>  Sakura and Karin were good friends <br>It's blatant that Salad is Karin's but everyone is happy with how the chips fell in the end.</br></br></br></br>    <br> why does she look like Karin? <br><br>Glasses aren't a genetic trait anon, if you think Kishi purposely took some Karin features and gave them to Sarada instead of being simply a case of sameface you give him too much credit.</br></br></br>  <br> Itachi got roflstomped as an immortal clone by Naruto like nothing <br>Confirmed for never reading the manga. Itachi was able to keep up in taijutsu againt Naruto chakra mode.</br></br>  <br> Honestly you're fucking blind if you think she looks like Karin <br>Salad is blind?</br></br>  <br>what about the Royalties</br>  <br>more like hitler vs hitler with eye hax</br>  <br>We will, m/a/te.</br>  <br>and sealed up orochimaru super hydra while dying from ninja aids</br>  For someone who is a so called friend to Karin, Sakura looked like a pretty bitch in that: <br><br>---she never mentioned her past 'friendship' with Karin to Salad<br><br>--she tapes her own image over Karin's<br><br>--she didn't even mentions the origin of Sarada's glasses to her<br><br>She just dodges questions, goes ape shit own her house, and faints.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're reaching anon take off your whatever the fuck kinda goggles you have on and read the chapter again.</br>  <br>Their physical similarities are so great the whole plot of the fucking gaiden was built around them you shitcunt.</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying he wasn't talented, even though he was shit on as a kid. I'm saying he still worked hard to get where he's at even with it.</br></br>  <br>Karin's Sarada's  father. Through futa no jutsu. </br>  <br>Which makes sense considering Sakura was bullied for having a huge forehead when she was a kid.</br>  Starting the dump back up again with Chapter 4.<br><br>In case you weren't here for the other thread: </br></br>                <br>Will Bazett sell Ice Pops?</br>                                    <br>Here we go</br>            <br>Why is Lancer the best bro?</br>    <br>And that's the end of Chapter 4.</br>  <br>Should I keep going?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Alrighty then.</br>  Damn, I really wish AATM gets animated. Just chuck it in as CarnPhan sequels or something.<br><br>Oh, and maybe adapt Melty Blood X as well.</br></br>  <br>Considering the Tsukihime segments in Carnival Phantasm were mostly Take Moon Chapters, I don't see why AATM can't have the same treatment.<br><br>It gives Kara no Kyoukai attention and has more interaction with everyone, so why not?<br><br> How long till Season 4 again </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Saber Alter appears.</br>    <br>I feel like some Gordon Ramsay shit is about to go down.</br>  <br>You're right.</br>    <br>There it is.</br>  <br> You call this miso?

Does she have a story in anything other than MB?</br>  B-suke's art is so comfy.  <br>She has a manga if I remember right.</br>  <br>The best loli helps fellow lolis.</br>  <br>Illya looks just like her mother grown up.</br>  <br>Why is it that Illya never grew up, if she's supposed to be 18-19?<br><br>Is it because she was half human, or the way her body was made as the grail?</br></br></br>  <br>Hana no Miyako doesn't count. Everyone in that manga only happen to share the same names, that's all and personality wise they're all different as fuck.</br>  <br>The H Scene that was cut is finally going to happen.<br><br> Like father like son? </br></br></br>  <br>Is it another universe then?</br>  <br>Will Illya ever win?</br>  <br>Prisma Illya.</br>  <br>Prism Ilya<br><br>She's the protag, she's already won.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Good thing you mentioned it, there's a Prisma Chapter in Volume 2. </br></br>  <br>The world would shatter if she did.</br>      <br>How is this going to end?</br>  <br>Good end!</br>    <br> Bad End. ;_; </br>  <br>Time to reload, Miyako</br>  <br>At least it wasn't a headbutt. We're improving.</br>    <br>Nope, only when grown up.</br>  <br>Miyako's so cute, so cute</br>  <br>And that's the true end to the 1st Volume.</br>  <br>Shokugeki no Saber</br>  <br>I really want to hug the heroines. Maybe not Shiki, since she would probably be violent.</br>  <br>Is Soma actually Shirou's real brother?</br>  <br>Shiki's a cat, as long as you're gentle, you'll be fine.</br>  <br>Actually, that grown up Miyako and Illya chapter isn't part of volume 1. Saber Alter one is the end of vol1.<br><br>source: I own the tanks for vol1 and 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, I figured as much, that's why I asked earlier if I should post it or not.<br><br>Time for Volume 2.</br></br></br>  <br>Foreshadowing.<br><br> How would Aoko and Touko be as Magical Girls? </br></br></br>  <br>Terrifying</br>  <br>Would a meeting between Kohaku and Hisui and Ruby + Sapphire turn out well?</br>  <br>Depends on which party</br>  <br>Best boy has arrived.</br>  <br> Best boy has arrived. <br>My brethren of african descent</br></br>    <br>What happened to the scan quality?</br>  <br>I think it's only that scan.</br>  <br>No, it looks like all the ones in vol 2. Everything looks thin and saturated for some reason. Someone needs to get a cleaner on that.</br>    <br><br>Whoops, sorry.<br><br>Good thing I'm dumping all of the chapters for them to be cleaned in that case.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it's fine I'm not that autistic yet. I was just wondering about the sudden drop in quality.</br>  <br>It's fine, I actually had to get some pages from another site in the last thread due to certain images being embedded. <br><br> A real autistic thing to say is where are the Death Lines when Shiki picks up that fairy. </br></br></br>      <br>Is Seaweed a good nickname for Shinji?</br>    <br>Yes, because it's a name for dicks.</br>      <br>Will Shinji finally prove his competence as a villain?</br>  <br>Honestly this is the most competent I've seen him be outside of Extra.</br>    <br>He was the most competent in CCC when he tricked Lilith as his shining moment, but he did do that whole thing in Extra where he created money in the arena I guess.<br><br>He was also a pretty good hacker and stuff,  and eight years old. </br></br></br>  <br>Any other names Azaka could use?</br>  <br>HNNNNG</br>    <br>All the first panel needs is Alice.</br>          <br>I wonder how comfy they all are.</br>    <br><br>I know all of her "super powers" are just gags, but Taiga is really scary sometimes.</br></br>  <br>Is the energy on the inside prana?</br>      <br>RIP Seaweed Flower.</br>  That plant just basically bukkaked everyone.    <br>Did Shinji do nothing wrong?</br>  <br>If only Dark Sakura started to come out here: </br>  <br>And that's the end of Chapter 7.</br>    <br>Seriously, she's like some moronic minor deity, or something.</br>  <br>So this is what happens after Battle Moon Wars, huh?</br>  <br>Maybe she's also connected to the root.<br><br><br>Probably.</br></br></br></br>        <br>This is far funnier than it should be.</br>  <br>Oh boy here we go.</br>  <br>Who can really use this potion?</br>    <br>best girl coming through</br>  So there seems to be enough of these to make more Carnival phantasm episodes. Care to explain why typemoon who tries to milk everything Nasu shits isn't making more Carnival Phantasm seasons?    <br>Probably saving it for next year's anniversary.</br>    <br>Isn't it sad, Sakura?</br>          <br>And that's the end of Chapter 8.<br><br>Unfortunately, I sadly need to head out.

The kara no kyokais sold well so he's probably got orders for things like Mahoyo or whatnot.<br>You think he wants to waste his time with MORE carnival phantasm? Shit, he probably wants to do something with the butcher again if he has time to do something special.

It's not always about the money that goes into a show, it's more about the skill of the people making it.</br>  Who?  <br> mappa anything but the most mediocre studio out there <br>how is your first anime going?</br></br>  literally who  <br>I believe they did Sakamichi no Apollon, Zankyou No Terror, Shingeki no Bahamut; Genesis and collaborated with Madhouse on Hajime no Ippo Rising.</br>  <br>The same way Gonzo had good animation - they were talented staff jumping ship from another studio.</br>  <br> The same way Gonzo had good animation <br><br>Ah, so they've only produced shit. Gotcha.</br></br></br>  beside creative and good animation, everything else is pretty meh<br>Well at lest they are number 2 Notamin choice</br>  <br>Actually, not too true. <br>The secret of MAPPA's success is Maruyama, the founder of MAPPA. <br><br>He's probably the most important person in anime industry right now. Unlike Miyazaki who retire, and Anno who only cares for Eva, Maruyama always keep making new project, new anime. <br><br>Just see what he did in Madhouse back then. He still not give up to create his "ideal" place.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can't be a powerhouse if virtually everything they've done solo has flopped. Punchline in particular has become, well, a punchline.<br><br> I guess Japan isn't ready for the punchline. </br></br></br>  <br> Just see what he did in Madhouse back then. <br><br>Bankrupt them?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah stuff they've produced has flopped but regardless their shows have some pretty impressive animation.</br>  <br>that impressive animation won't Last if they can only do anime that sell like shit</br>  <br>Yeah, what I scared is they went to bankrupt or Maruyama dies. <br><br>But I hope they managed to make Pluto adaptation. Maruyama said that project must be done before he dies. And he's thinking one hell of crazy budget.<br><br>800 Million Yen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mappa needs to make enough money to do this. I've honestly enjoyed every show of theirs I've seen so hopefully they stay around for quite some time.</br>  If ZnTerror, SnB and Punchline are "powerhouse" animations then anime truly is dead.  Perhaps they should start adapting some popular light novels.<br><br>Madhouse did Mahouka and No Game No Life. Those two did kind of well for them sales-wise.</br></br>  <br>ZnT &amp; SnB were pretty visually impressive shows. Haven't seen Punchline.</br>  <br><br>Hakomari adaptation by Mappa when?</br></br>  <br>Punchline is pretty neat. I like the style and the animation is good. I wouldn't say jaw dropping but it's a very pleasant show to look at.</br>   no one mentions GARO yet <br>I hate you all</br>  <br>I honestly dropped it. First 2 episodes didn't really interest me and seeing the comparison in animation to Shingeki no Bahumat made me think it wasn't going to be good as they don't have the "A" team working on or something. It's been a while but I just remember being disappointed.</br>  Zankyou no Terror is garbage  <br>Mappa = Madhouse<br>Madhouse = deadhouse<br><br>See Gainax and Trigger.<br>Brainbase and Shuka.<br>Shaft and Silvelink.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shaft and Silvelink <br>Shaft will be eternal till then ran out of Monogatari material to animate.</br></br>  Madhouse are the new Arms.  <br>But ARMS is fuckign great - it does porn, it has Umetsu and some of the greatest industry animators. It does lot of shit, but it can be better than most least animation wise if budget is present.<br><br>Meanwhile Madhouse is just deadhouse.</br></br></br>  <br>It's directing, animation and soundtrack isn't.</br>  <br>Maoyuu looks 10 times better than Overlord. So no. Madhouse != Arms. Arms &gt; Madhouse.<br><br>Madhouse is old bankrupt Gonzo.</br></br></br>  <br>because the people are not new like you.</br>  <br>They also did Garo, which was actually pretty fun.</br>  <br>Aren't new studios supported by their goverment. And that's why Trigger and MAPPA can do the fuck they want?</br>  <br>But neo Gainax is not shit like Madhouse. And Trigger isn't very relevant. The only thing they did well was a 20something minutes OVA years ago.</br>  <br>That Leon vs Alfonso fight was pretty boss.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pFW<wbr>1Br_GqoQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I think their animation and visuals are absolutely fantastic, even if their stories do need some improvement.</br>  <br>why do people praise Mappa so much when they're literally just a smaller Madhouse</br>  <br>ZnT and SnB had mediocre stories but they also had godly scenery.</br>  <br>Yeah. That was awesome. There were a lot of cool action scenes.<br><br>ZnT had a brilliant OST.</br></br></br>  <br>You answered your own question.</br>  <br>Madhouse hasn't done anything good in years. Only decent work in the last years was an adaptation, Ace of Diamond, and it barely looks as an animation sometimes. On the other side, you have GAROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOO in the recent memory</wbr></br>  <br>Agreed.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Xmq<wbr>RsIudBII</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=nKP<wbr>8xhGoZRk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I had so many hopes for Trigger and they always let me down.</br>  <br>Its Yoko Kanno.

They should have stay out of moeshit.</br>  <br> in terms of animation <br>Yeah, no.<br><br>It is just so that the one in charge gets them plenty work for now, mostly from places where most studios probably don't go for.

And the reality is that Bahamut was "suppose to" have a huge budget, but it choke very hard, very fast. Some animator not getting any sleep for a whole week is nothing special.</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be a counter argument? Their shit is slightly above average but to call them a powerhouse? I don't think so.</br>  <br>half of the baseball games are still frames, still a good series though</br>  <br>Also while we are on the topic, ufotable is a fucking joke. Only extreme retards actually believe they are a good animation studio.</br>  <br>He is still as good as ever (except as director). Wizzard Barrister while being meh and running out of budget, had probably the best action animation of any show in this decade. <br><br>Umetsu also animated most iconic and best looking moment in Madoka, Homura guns timetravel.<br><br>Did great work on Blood C movie (its meh, but looks phenomenal).<br><br>And even comparing Overlord this season and Maoyuu - he did direct Maoyuu OP and drew some scenes in show<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EKr<wbr>8xGV1PCk</wbr>  [ ]<br>Also did Madoka movie 1 and 2 OPs<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PQo<wbr>8o682Ny4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Also, he is working on Kizumonogatari (if it ever gets out) and atm working on his new unannounced project as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 'Talking out of my ass' The Post. </br>  <br>God Eater already suffering delays from episode 1.

Bahamut was a fucking mess. Garo that was airing at the same time was actually almost better, because it has a consistent shit animation. Bahamut was all over the place from being bad to superb shit. And good think we are talking about animation only, because so far they haven't made a single good story.</br>  <br><br> what is kids on the slope </br></br>  <br>He's such a God</br>  <br>So how many years are you going to have to backpedal?<br><br>And the answer is an okayish adaptation. And they didn't even do it alone.</br></br></br>  Just like Bones, PA or KyoAni their stuff is consistent most of the time and the animation is definitely above average. But I don't think 'animation powerhouses' exist anymore. The good animators are scattered everywhere and don't stick to just one studio. I'd include Shaft and Ufotable but they're very hit and miss.  <br> Bitches about OP for using buzzwords proceeds to make a post with buzzwords. <br><br>Take of your Fedora for a second. OP isn't talking about how good the show's they've made but rather the Studio's animation production quality.</br></br></br>  <br> what is co-produced by Tezuka productions. <br>I'll give you Kids on the Slope is easily their best "work", but really it's still just "better than most", and I would never willingly recommend it to someone.<br><br><br>that is the dumbest criteria ever, a Studio's job is more than animators, it's hiring writers, and directors, and storyboarders, Why would you credit a studio with the work of an individual animator, that's stupid.<br>The only thing you could ever credit a studio for is the quality of work they put out, of which, MAPPA has yet to produce anything note worthy</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Both KyoAni 190 permanently employed stuff, which in KyoAni case even live in KyoAni owned dorms.<br><br>Not every studio outsources 90% of its work to koreans, other sutdios and freelancers. The only others KyoAni involves are Studio Blue for inbetweens and finishing sometimes.<br><br>Though outside them, i can barely name any studio that does that aside from single projects.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WRONG<br>trigger is the new powerhouse</br></br>  <br> Just like Bones, PA <br>Bones and PA outsource a LOT. Shirobako for instance had almost 50! studios workign on 2nd key, finishing, in-beetweens and even key animation.<br><br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/anime.php?id=16189</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hiring writers and directors (and indeed animation studios) is the job of the production committees, you tard.<br>Animation studios are responsible for animating.</br></br>  <br>More like power bottom<br><br>That fatass Imaishi is a total fuckboy</br></br></br>  <br>Come on, you can't bait anyone with that one.</br>  <br>The OP isn't praising the studio but asking how they are able to produce such high animation quality while being a new studio.<br><br>The simple answer to that question is, they have talented animators working for them.</br></br></br>  <br>The new powerhouse of shit.</br>  <br> high quality <br>while I understand your position, "quality" means nothing without a proper driving force behind it.<br><br>Most well animated scenes, stuff that people will mention, talk about, and praise, have some sort of impact or meaning behind them. Whether it be a pivotal point in the story, a big fight, or has a fitting soundtrack playing to it, there has to be SOMETHING to give meaning to what is being show.<br><br>as far as I am concerned, MAPPA has failed it that regard and as such, I can't possibly praise them.<br>I'd be completely ok with reversing my opinion once they produce something that truly moves me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will they save anime once again?</br>  <br>That's not what good animation is, though. That's just the scene being good (and in a pretty specific way, too - not every good show is particularly moving).<br><br>Anyway, even though ZnT was pretty bad in general, it had a handful of really well-done scenes. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tEK<wbr>sAFlty3M</wbr>  [ ] for example.</br></br></br>  <br> collaborated with Madhouse on Hajime no Ippo Rising <br>No wonder that installment sucks.</br></br>  <br>well done?<br>it's a good scene don't get me wrong, but you'd be grasping at straws to call it anything more than that.<br>I think in your head you're imagining that as some sort of Shinkai-esque visual experience, which is actually a good example.<br>Shinkai gets a pass because what he produces is so visually captivating you can't help but enjoy it.<br>MAPPA doesn't do that, nothing they have produced has been so visually stunning the audience is forced to watch it even if the story isn't doing anything for them.<br><br>I'll just end this all by saying MAPPA is a technical studio that has yet to put out a single impressive piece of work that would put them on the map.<br>Nothing else needs to be said, for or against them, Until they either produce a masterpiece, or being titling into obscurity, there is no reason to mention their name.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Great, can you shut up now and admit that you didn't get what OP was asking?</br>  <br>Why would you expect a Shinkai-esque experience from a TV series. No TV anime has that level of visual detail.<br><br>Also I'm confused by your logic on how you give Shinkai a pass with your standards. The dude is so style over substance imho.</br></br></br>  <br> that is just a scene being good <br> post yet another scene <br>Keep on circling the same examples every time.</br></br></br>  <br> The dude is so style over substance imho. <br>EXACTLY MY POINT.<br>it's the same exact thing, except substitute style is quality of animation,<br>from everything I've seen of them, it's been a lot of technical and good animation, but they haven't produced any breathtaking scenes, or make a series worth talking about.<br>Without those two qualifications, their catalog is TOO SMALL to even begin to comment on their quality.<br>It's the same shit with Trigger dick riders, the sample size is to fucking small to even begin formulating an opinion on the quality of the studio</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would you be okay with your sword being this lewd?<br><br>Also Blade Dance thread.</br></br>   swordsmen <br>ech, no<br>I'm a driller bitch</br></br>  <br>No.<br> Want to sheath my sword <br> It's drenched from lewd juice. </br></br></br>  inb4 THK.  <br> Post above you <br><br>GG.</br></br></br>  I come to post best girl.

Your favorite Blade Dance is wonderful too.</br>  <br>Finally, can't wait to read it.</br>  Thanks mods for deleting the thread but we're back. New yuru yuri thread, and please dont bother shitposting just because you're butt hurt. So who is objectively the best Yuru? and why?  It doesn't sound like you've really got your goals in line there  I like Ayano. I don't know why.  <br>um we are gonna talk about who is the best yuru, which is Kyouko, shes cute and funny and gets all the grils</br>  <br>I like Ayano. I don't care why.</br>  <br><br>Because you can relate to your crush being totally oblivious to your affections?Or is that just me?.</br></br>  I really want to  _hug_  Akari  I like Sakurako because she likes pokemans and doesn't afraid of anything  What a great way to start a new thread.  <br>I know. The threads in general have been pretty ghostly recently.</br>  <br>We could always make weekly threads instead of daily ones.</br>  <br>That probably would be better and would actually give us stuff to talk about</br>  <br>/ag/ ANIME GENERALS WHEN</br>  <br>you mean /a/?</br>  <br>Maybe because you fags had 24/7 generals not too long ago because of s3. <br>It was really fucking annoying. <br><br>Fucking never, and for good reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br> going a week without yurus <br> mfw </br></br>  <br>I don't know. I downloaded the raw manga and remembered that I can't actually read japanese.</br>  <br>Someone seems a bit upset<br><br>I can read to some extent but usually can't really translate it to what the fuck its supposed to mean</br></br></br>  Is it illegal to watch Yuru Yuri on a plane?  <br>every yuru is best yuru op</br>  <br>Not what weekly means. I had /yys/ in mind when I said weekly, the thread can stay up as long as possible but no new threads are made until a week passes.</br>  <br>If only there was an easier way of doing this.</br>  <br>Why would it be? It's 2D.<br><br>Now if you're watching it in 3D space, we have a problem.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, that's some true dedication right there.</br>  <br>oh, well in that case it seems like a gravy idea</br>  I am displeased at the pace of this thread. Faster!  <br>Then lets post cute girls and talk about somethin'.</br>  <br> So who is objectively the best Yuru? <br>Ive gone in circles trying to decide. The main 8 are all the best.</br></br>  <br>Unless you know of an edition of YRYR containing furigana or a method of making KanjiPad not be terrible, this is going to be a slow process.</br>    Mods are asleep. Post C hinatsu  P eeing herself.   <br>Oh you know why.<br> It's because she's best. </br></br>  <br>Some of them don't look like they're enjoying themselves.</br>  <br>Don't worry, they're secretly enjoying it.

It's one thing to draw yurus in meguca clothes, but it is another to specifically draw the megucas being so narrow.<br>Thread = Ruined.<br>Spoil that shit harder next time.</br></br></br>  <br>They were pretty narrow in Rebellion.</br>    <br>So were your threads.</br>  <br>So were you're waifu.<br><br> fat kyubey <br>That gives me an idea on how to give Sakurako boobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Akari is a good girl, she'd probably wish for all her friends to be happy</br>  <br>Now that's dark.</br>  <br>The brightest name, the darkest soul.</br>      <br> I want Yui to kick me. </br>  <br>That is brutal</br>  <br>Don't fuck with Kyouko or else ya get a Yui kick to the shoulder</br>  <br>   You will never bully Kyouko </br>    <br>She didn't deserve it.</br>  <br> Neither did Akari </br>  <br>PMMM would have been better as a YRYR or Hidamari crossover with no suffering.</br>  <br>That's the plan for season 2.</br>  <br>But how can you truly appreciate comfiness with no corresponding suffering?</br>  I really want to read the manga but I want to watch S3 without knowing what is going to happen in every scene.    <br>Now that we have a confirmed date it might be good to wait<br>It's not that far away really</br></br>  What did she see?  <br>a male</br>    <br><br>I agree, I'd love to see the Madoka girls in a nice SoL with no suffering where they can just have carefree fun.</br></br>    <br>S-source?</br>  <br>She looks like a chipmunk</br>  <br> http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1642401</wbr> </br>  <br> http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/125<wbr>2267?tags=akaza_akari+soda_can</wbr> </br>  <br> "soda" <br> not Akari's favourite, "Orange Fanti" <br><br>Absolute joke of an image</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you really think this was Akari's idea, and that she chose what soda to use?</br>  <br>H-how do you know Akari's favourite soda?</br>  <br> they didn't just use one can </br>  <br>Where does one even download raws? All I can find is batches of shitty translated manga.</br>  <br>Season 2 Episode 5, abandoned at the train station sketch. She orders Orange "Fanti" from the vending machine and goes on a soliloquy about how it's the best or whatever. I feel like a Star Trek nerd citing episode numbers for obscure trivia.</br>  <br>Is it shitty because it's translated or is the translation shitty?</br>  Say hi to Himouto  <br>I want them to keep the ability to summon their witch forms like they can after Rebellion though. In fact I'd love an entire series dedicated to cute psychological eldritch abominations doing cute eldritch things written like a regular Slice of Life. Nyaruko doesn't count.</br>  Tiny Tomato is sad. She wants more Yuru's.  <br>I think I've seen this post before.</br>  <br> Nyaruko doesn't count. <br>Nyaruko most definitely does count, however if you want more, I can understand that.</br></br>  <br>The latter.</br>    <br>I don't really post in the Madoka threads so I don't see how that can be. I can't keep up with the people who have rewatched the show like 3-4 times, I feel like my power level for Madoka alone isn't high enough to keep up with the discussion instead of just responding to drivel like 'witch Madoka would you fug?'<br><br><br>I want an entire show of them in abomination form, Nyaruko is fun but doesn't particularly scratch that itch too often.</br></br></br></br>  This thread needs more chibi Yurus.  <br>I feel like that show is going to be a real hit or miss for me. I was bothered when Sora no Otoshimono did the same thing with the changing art styles, but I'm not sure if I can handle it now.</br>  <br>Can't wait</br>  <br>What is this, a gif for ants?</br>  <br> he thinks actual discussions are still being had in Madoka threads <br>It's mostly tripfags and some anons shooting the shit. In fact, it's better the less you know about the show, since you actually asking questions that were already answered years ago would only attract infamous shitposters.</br></br>      <br>This is a Dogakobo show, right? Her 'real' form makes me think of what would happen if someone mashed Kyouko and Sakurako together.<br><br><br>That sounds awful, I'll just stay here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's mostly tripfags <br>Every time someone comes in here to complain about it being a pointless general I'm tempted to say "But at least we're not a Madoka thread.".</br></br>  <br>It will happen to us one day. The comfiness can never last<br>but for now lets enjoy it while we can!</br></br>  <br>To be honest I'd rather take the tripfag blogging than the occasional spergfest that goes on in here.</br>  <br>Were Madoka threads ever comfy? It's not exactly in the nature of the show. In fact, a comfy Madoka thread seems like it would actually be lovely.</br>  <br>So constant tripfagging rather than occasional spergfest? To each their own. It's been a few weeks since I felt the need to bow out of a YrYr thread because it got too terrible.  I may have inadvertently been the cause of that at least once though. </br>  So any updates on S3? Haven't been here in a while.  <br>What's this doing in a Yuru Yuri thread?

Oh, and see you on Non non biyori threads.</br>  I cannot find the link to 36s raws anywhere.  What are you reading, /a/? now that shieldbro has been fully translated, minus the Do Over of Spearhero, i've been having fun tracking down unusual stuff and reading it even if I have to do it through google.<br><br>Following through awesome people that is translating them:<br>* RE:Monster<br>* Risou No Himo Seikatsu (which btw I am also checking through G. Translate, and the fact the title loosely means "My Life as a sponger in a fantasy world" amuses me a lot)<br>* Mushoku Tensei. Its technically over, but I'm still enjoying the "Icing on the cake" chapters.<br>* Overlord (also reading through G Translate, and damn the differences are huge)<br><br>Through G. Translate<br>* Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought there (did the manga stop after they get to the asylum where the MC's mom is at? the novel continues quite a bit. Is it on pause to let the incoming anime catch up?)<br>* Exploring Dungeons with my Fantasy Harem. Guy goes to a fantasy world, decides "fuck it, may as well" and starts adventuring into dungeons to get money and buy slavegirls. Some anons will enjoy the absolute lack of whiteknighting as he isnt shy about using the girls sexually, but at least in so far as I am reading, he still hasn't done the dwarf girl. I guess she would be a legal loli?)<br><br><br>* The Mao is a reincarnated Slime! - Guy reincarnates as a slime and works his way up. Im only on chapter 8 or so but it seems promising so far. Also, morbid curiosity since the author added "sex" to the codes on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why in LN thread there are always people that like to show off their literary credentials? <br>Because these are the kinds of people who look down on others for, uh, any number of reasons. Some sort of internal mental complex they have.</br></br>   start reading DaL for Kurumi  <br> have to get through annoying Tohka and Origami shit first  <br>Who the fuck cares about Rei and the Retard?</br></br>  <br> It bothered me too, but I think it was the author's way of trying to make Rudy more balanced and less of a steamroller like most MCs tend to be. <br>That's retarded. Wow. It's just his personality. That's it. He was a NEET who leeched off of his parents and had no social skills at all. And the author stuck to that. Rudy didn't remain as spineless as he was in his past life, but he did grow from it.<br><br>When someone is strong, someone is strong. Their personality, whether it's weak or strong, shouldn't be used to 'balance out' and make things seem 'fair'. That's why people pile on hate towards spineless, indecisive harem MCs. The personality someone has should compliment their situation. It shouldn't be there to 'make up' for how 'unfairly strong' they are, but to make their situation entertaining.</br></br></br></br>  Are the side stories for Gekkou translated?
