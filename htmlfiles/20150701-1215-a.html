All other assassins (Say Judas or Brutus) only killed one person, and modern ones just aren't interesting. The only other one I could think of was Zodiac, but I already have Houdini for the "American" variety.</br>  <br>Hannibal Lecter?</br>    <br>John Wilkes Booth?<br>Lee Harvey Oswald?</br></br>  NisiO Grail War<br><br>Ruler: Medaka <br><br>Saber: Any Yasuri or Deviant Blade user or Kokorowatari user. <br>Lancer: Udou Bukiko<br>Archer: Emonzaemon<br>Rider: Yozuru Kagenui with her trusty steed Yotsugi. <br>Berserker: Iihiko Shishime<br>Caster: Anshin'in <br>Assassin: Kumagawa. <br><br>Lancer and Rider are bastards since only one person uses a spear and no-one is well-known for specifically using a vehicle of any form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are both only famous for killing one person, not really an exciting assassin in my book.<br><br><br>Thought about him but I wanted to stray away from "Completely fictitious" and more mythological.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Harold Shipman?<br><br>I judge assassins based on the way they killed not so much the number they killed.<br><br>Then again, both JWB and LHO got found out. Not exactly legendary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about Mary Ann Cotton?</br>  <br>Yeah that too. What marks a legendary assassin is if they killed a lot, and were not caught. Jack the Ripper and Zodiac are in my opinion two best options for western assassins.</br>  <br> Kumagawa not lancer <br><br>come on he literally fits lancer to a T.</br></br></br>  <br>what about Zodaic Killer? He's got the same kill count as Jack.<br>or any other serial killers for that matter<br><br>10/10 lol'ed</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty damn good. Especially your selection for lancer /suffering </br>  <br>got a template?</br>  <br>I did consider his E minus minus luck and Bookmaker but in the end I figured that being in the class that is irrelevant and no-one likes even in-universe fits him best. <br><br>Obviously Kumagawa can multi-class like Anshin'in or Freshmaker</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I was thinking of Zodiac as well. It was tough to pick between Jack or him, but I really wanted Houdini as the caster, so I didn't want to add another American servant. But yeah, I would probably prefer Zodiac over Jack since Jack is kinda already done.</br>  <br>Nah I don't I made this years ago.

It is very powerful for trapping and binding others.<br>Bogenform (Bow Form): Combining with its sheath, Laevatein in this form can shoot powerful arrow-like bolts. While powerful, this form is awkward to use, leaving Signum defenseless for a few seconds as she draws and fires.<br><br>Noble Phantasm: Laevatein's Sheath<br>Type: Barrier<br>Rank: C<br>Serves as a mana compressor for when Laevatein is pulled out from it and can create powerful defense barriers.
