[ Too much nationalism and bullshit politics with otaku pandering in one episode.  <br>Cry more murrican</br>  <br>It's tied with Gangsta for worst first ep of the season.</br>  Symphogear GX best first episode  <br> Too much nationalism <br>I really hope you aren't american because if you are, that would be ironic</br></br>  <br>You're delusional anon Gangsta first episode may have been average but it was in no way as shit as Gate. At least the former doesn't have forced nationalism. <br><br>Also Classroom Crisis was completely boring.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I ain't even American faggot.</br>  <br>There is basically no one subbing this then?</br>  <br>Should i watch that?</br>  <br>Triple tie between gangsta, gate and gakkou gurashi</br>  lol, no  <br>Anon, Gangsta was visually ugly and lifeless and filled with boring characters and crime cliches. And the action is shit. It's trash.</br>  <br> worst episode <br><br>Have you even SEEN the summer line up? I'm not saying this is the best, but holy shit it looks like a gem in the rough</br></br></br>  <br>It was still average so stop over exaggerating. Have you seen Gate anon that show was literally dull and boring. I'll admit that Gangsta's first episode wasn't that great but it was nowhere as bad as Gate.</br>    <br> literally dull and boring <br>Just like Gangsta, hence the tie.</br></br>  <br> 1115 posts <br> 173 unique posters <br><br>ALL DAT SHITPOSTIN</br></br></br></br>  Gate's author reminds me of that guy who joined a sports team for one year, never trained, never really played, and then talked about how intense and tough it was, and posts inspirational videos on his facebook all fucking day<br><br>Jsdf is a meme army in real life<br><br> inb4 just the anime is bad  <br>The whole thing is dumb, if you can admit that and still enjoy it then all the power to you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The second number is images you fool</br>  This sounds just like http://www.tboverse.us/HPCAFORUM/ph<wbr>pBB3/viewforum.php?f=29 with added moe/otaku bait.</wbr>  <br><br><br>If you honestly think that Chaos Dragon wasn't the worst fucking episode ever, you are damaged in the brain department for sure.</br></br></br>  <br> Fantasy Monsters geting BTFO by Soldiers with M249 LMG'S <br> Bad </br></br>  Pretty much one of the worst first episodes I've seen in a long time  ppppppfffFFFTTTTTT<br><br>I've been able to ignore said bullshit politics for most of this, but I can only take so much.</br></br>  <br>Tell me more about how they portray nationalism in this first episode. I thought they're going to show that in later episodes?</br>  <br>Are you implying that the honorable Japanese would ever sink to the level of lesser nations?</br>  <br>gonna start watching this now... but no way is as bad as Gangsta, that was garbage tier</br>  <br><br>Jokes on you, I'm korean-canadian.</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of Outbreak Company, but a lot more focused on the military aspect. Also a lot less fun.</br>  <br>I dont understand the gangsta hate. It was extremely average. Nothing crazy, passable animation, fairly generic characters.</br>  It's confirmed <br>Gate threads will be guaranteed hives of shitpost</br>  <br><br>What forced nationalism? I'm actually serious because there was none this episode.<br><br>If you need to make things up in order to hate the show just don't watch it and do something better with your time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that comfort women never happened.</br>  <br>I guess no one know you're a dog in the internet.</br>  <br>This. Korean and Chinese women are huge whores.</br>  <br>good thing I'm dropping this after ep 1.<br><br>I mean I'm willing to go through shitposting if the show is at least somewhat decent, but this is beyond masochism, christ</br></br></br>  <br>Then I bet Japan will love this series.</br>  <br> korean <br>Invalid post.</br></br>  <br>why the only complain that people have about gate always is UUUUHHH TOOO MUCHHH NATIONALISMM DO NOT WATCH/READ<br>lololol murica always put nationalism in EVERYTHING for example in every sci-fi movie murica is always the good guys and they always save the planet<br>what is the problem if now japan has an anime like that?</br></br></br>  <br> worst first ep of the season. <br>Ushio to Tora exists, so nope.</br></br>  <br>Because America truly is the savior of the world while Japan is just some shitty island that draws cartoon porn.</br>  <br>You are both savage countries with shit culture. European masterrace here, literally.</br>  <br>Your country is flooded with niggers,nothing great about that.</br>  nippon stronk  OP apparently hasn't watch classroom crisis. Holy shit what a letdown.  <br> nationalism <br><br>Why are you so butthurt about this? It's a japanese animation made for a japanese audience, why can't it be nationalistic?</br></br></br>  <br> korean <br>Even worse</br></br>  <br>I watched CC just after Gate and actually thought it was great, just because Gate was so shit, even though rationally, it was a huge letdown</br>  You can tell that theres a bunch of retarded butthurt Koreans and Chinese ITT.<br><br>You shouldn't be watching anime and stop fapping to Japanese women.</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>But that's the whole point of the show. <br><br>Outbreak Company did it better.</br></br></br>  <br> worst first episode <br> not even more than 10 relevant shows have aired yet, much less been subbed <br>Fuck off back to /v/ cunt</br></br></br>  <br><br>Let the Nips be free to celebrate the beauty of guns!</br></br>  <br>So everything's a delusion due to him hitting his head right?<br><br>Also 3 months have passed where is the American occupation around the gate?</br></br></br>  <br>Just confess that you are angry because the Gothic Loli didn't show up.<br><br>Because I am.</br></br></br>  <br> Too much nationalism and bullshit politics with otaku pandering <br>That's literally what Gate is about</br></br>  <br> Fantasy Monsters geting BTFO by Soldiers with M249 LMG'S <br> no gore <br>i hate it when people hype for a show based on expectation</br></br></br>  I miss outbreak company  <br> Is 1 good or 5 good? </br>  <br>This, fucking this.</br>  <br>the autofellatio gets to the poiint where the suspension of disbelief ends<br><br>i can accept if japan likes to pretend it's a competent military nation and not a land of betas but i can only accept so much nippon stronk before i start laughing ag the absurdity</br></br></br>  <br> Too much nationalism and bullshit politics with otaku pandering in one episode. <br><br>Agree on the otaku pandering, but there was almost no nationalism. Not that nationalism is a bad thing in the first place too.</br></br></br>  The MC's almond shaped head was seriously bothering me.  <br> but there was almost no nationalism <br><br>Abe pls<br><br> random gate opens <br> fuck that it's part of Japan now, let's go invade <br> NIHON, FUCK YEAH </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It was way better than Gangsta and better than Ranpo Kitan's first episode, but that will likely end up being the better show.  <br>It's called Minimi.</br>  <br>That's hardly nationalism. They even considering to blow up the gate.</br>  <br>Gate's first episode was much better than Classroom Crisis's.</br>  <br>So what was Japan laughing about?</br>  <br> I miss outbreak company <br>Damn, Gate is Outbreak Company told from a different angle  but without demi-elf fuckpuppets  at least so far.  </br></br>  <br>I imagine it's something like ﻿ｔｈａｔ ｗａｓ ｓｈｉｔ ｗｗｗｗｗ</br>  <br> &gt;fuck that it's part of Japan now, let's go invade <br><br>Well yes. Unprovoked attack with many civilian victims and the intent of colonization, the rational response is to wreck their shit. <br><br>Pity they left out all the gore and pic related.</br></br></br></br></br>  How do I fix the fucking banding, This is a joke.  <br>madVR</br>  <br> Can We All Agree That Gate Had The Worst First Episode. <br>no, it was fine.</br></br>  <br>That's literally what any fucking country would do.<br><br>Pretty funny that the JSDF are even allowed to go through though, America would instantly demand that the gate is theirs and Japan would turn it over instantly.</br></br></br>  <br>Have it.<br><br>default debanding strength on low.<br>strength during fade in/out high.<br><br>Funi make me fucking sick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Funi <br>This is CR m8</br></br>   tfw their smartphone games are better than our AAA   <br>well in the manga the Americans said to only be giving weapons and supplies (suppose to anyway)<br><br>though trust me this show is written by an ex JSDF so don't take any representation of foreign nations to seriously unless you plan on shitposting</br></br></br>  <br>Oh so it is, Well this a surprise. CR usually looks decent.</br>  <br>The fuck you are even talking about?<br>I'm someone who normally really hates nationalism for the sake of pandering and muh pride, but this was fucking perfect.</br></br>  <br>Even Outbreak Company figured out something that basic, the nips are covering up the magic portal in that universe.<br><br>This is probably going to be an utter trainwreck, but I need goth loli.</br></br></br>  <br>butthurt murican</br>  <br>Britbong please</br>  <br>nice bait. <br><br>it wasn't anything special, frankly it left a very poor impression on me, but it was no where near as painful to watch as that wannabe black lagoon, er i mean "Gangsta."</br></br></br>  <br> that ED <br>I couldn't stop laughing.</br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded?<br>What would you have done? Wait until some other Gate opens and let a few more of your civilians get slaughtered instead of taking the fight to the enemy?<br>Are you swede by chance?</br></br></br>  <br>The anime was licensed by Sentai. They encode and sub the series for Crunchyroll.</br>   Modern warfare is superior to magic bullshit <br> Magic loli can slay entire untits <br><br>I have problems to grasp the "balance" of this series. The premise is nice, but those are too extremes that are difficult to manage.<br><br>I mean, the entire point is that the modern soldiers can compete fantasy with ease, but then you have a magic character that can obliterate modern soldiers...all the point is lost then, magical land just would need to send some lv99 mages to obliterate all the forces.<br><br>If you go with the premise, that is interesting, stick with that and don't spoil it even before starting.<br><br>For the rest...was an episode full of...nothing. Not the wrost first impression, but definetively didn't was a good one either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> this already happens <br><br>http://arunrajagopal.com/2012/01/31<wbr>/finnairsocialmediacontentstrateg/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Autist murrican  <br> Being this assblasted <br><br>TOP KEK</br></br></br></br>   MC is an otaku <br>My sides every tiem</br>  <br>Fist episode WAS shit, I was thinking it for the whole 20 minutes. The focus of the whole episode was misplaced and it honestly didn't come off as dire enough to me given the circumstances.<br><br>The only thing keeping me going is the cool premise. Hope it gets better because it can be really really good.</br></br></br>  <br> Magic loli can slay entire untits <br>Where you watch this?</br></br>  <br>Koreafag please</br>  How useful would police riot shields actually be against Roman armaments?   Tells people to hide in a huge fucking palace. <br> Gets 2nd Lieutenant. <br>What.</br></br>  <br>There are top tier otakus out there, like that guy that won a maraton dressed like that blonde bitch from kancolle.</br>  what the hell<br>i thought the concept was interesting (but the episode was terrible) so i read the first chapter of the manga.<br>night and fucking day. now i feel really bad for the manga and novel fans.</br></br>  <br> &gt;no gore <br>This bothered much more than I thought it would have.</br></br>  <br>Not very, but they didn't have any armaments left at the end.</br>  <br>Different Anon here, it was in a chapter for this that a bunch tier one operators from the U.S., Russia and China get fucking rekt by a loli with a scythe.</br>  <br>Read the manda or the LN.</br>  <br> SUMMERFAGS <br> MURRICAN OP <br> 4 JULY  <br><br>I see why OP is such a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He kill someone too!</br>  <br> blonde bitch <br>It's Shimakaze for you sir</br></br>  <br>It's the matter of how many lives one can save.</br>  <br>fucking what<br><br>https://sociorocketnewsen.files.wor<wbr>dpress.com/2014/10/bzy8asqccaerrlw-<wbr>1.jpg?w=580&amp;h=448</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>How could it have been more dire? It's a few poxy Romans killing a tiny handful of civilians.</br>  <br>As expected from leloutard.</br>  <br>honestly seeing this they are probably going to gloss over the most controversial parts <br><br>wonder how they are gonna show when the special forces come</br></br></br>  <br>An inmortal apostle of a god loli with a scythe.</br>  Disappointing so far. This would have far more potential as a hentai.  Why didn't the Japanese riot police deploy their water cannons?  <br>I don't think she's even using magic. Just being skilled with her scythe [/spoiler] and being demi-god[/spoiler]</br>  <br>Yeah that part also.</br>  <br>Well the loli is immortal and is the apostle of the god of war and death, so it's normal she can rekt spec ops on close combat.</br>   Gayte <br><br>At least the threads will be hilarious.</br></br>  <br><br>It's pay to win shit.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Atleast it isn't Tumblr the anime like Ranpo Kitan</br></br></br>  <br>How thick are police riot shields, can they repel swords?</br>  <br> muh con!!!! <br> Cutaways before every instance of killing <br> People still walking the streets only a couple months after a massacre <br> City not evacuated <br> "durr, do u think dere will b catgurls? :3" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i cant wait to see a bunch of slashing scene cuts<br>its going to suck so bad<br><br>wonder if they will keep in only America has black people</br></br></br></br>  What I disliked was the complete lack of build-up.  Holy shit this thread is full of butthurt murricans crying like bitches, hesus christ is the fat from mcdonalds getting this hard into their brains?  <br>How do you know that?</br>  <br>those are horrible numbers idiot</br>  <br> Boy the rape scene is going to be neutered </br>  <br> &gt;People still walking the streets only a couple months after an INTER-DIMENSIONAL massacre </br>  <br><br>A regenerating immortal who gives zero shits about bullets.<br><br>High explosives though would have done the trick, but they weren't loaded out for that situation in mind.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you not watch the episode?</br>  <br> but then you have a magic character that can obliterate modern soldiers <br>High tier magic users are very difficult to find and nurture. It's simply overpowered by modern weapon by number. Where the hell is this magic loli you talking about?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I know right. I mean what a genius he must be, who could've ever thought of that brilliant strategy?</br></br></br>  <br>It's slow first episode. More action next ep.</br>  <br>Well, I knew the militarism part was going to suck (because japanese), but the surprise suckiness was the horrible direction in the first ~8 minutes, staying too long on meaningless shots, trying and failing so hard to make the beginning of the invasion terrifying, going as far as to do a full barrel roll with the viewpoint, overall a mess which didn't help the beginning of an anime you didn't get into with the best of expectations.<br><br>That aspect at least got better from one moment to another, only the beginning was intentionally boring you enough to drop it right there.<br><br>Also, lol at that phone call, they want to imply it was the emperor, but they can't even refer to him because japan. As if enough bad aspects of japanese political culture hadn't surfaced already by that point.</br></br></br></br></br>  Murrican STRONK :DDDDDD  <br><br>Did you not see his daydream on the train?<br><br>It ends with him not being able to do shit because the game menu tells him to cough up the dough.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "durr, do u think dere will b catgurls? :3" <br>I would ask myself the same. Getting myself the chance of having my own war spoil catgirl would be a reason to even go on that mission.</br></br>  Is there anything good airing this season that isn't garbage besides returning shows?<br><br>Nothing aired so far is very good.</br></br>  <br>For some reason this makes me depressed as fuck.</br>  <br>Literally the exact opposite of what I said I wanted.</br>  <br><br><br><br> This amount of replies <br>Holy hell I'm surprised.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Out of energy <br> Gets rekt <br><br>Its the kind of mobile shit where you have to buy energy to do anything</br></br></br></br>   Only 'Murrica is allowed to be nationalist <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Yet, he was the only person who stayed calm and collected, even killed one of the enemy soldier. That army guy who was at the area can't even do anything.</br>  <br> "durr, do u think dere will b catgurls? :3" <br> Implying there wouldn't tons wanting to enlist if you could get a monstergirl waifu <br>I know I would.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you you're probably from some poor ass third world country faggot.</br>  <br> Moefag moaning because this season isn't full of moeshit </br>  <br> &gt;"durr, do u think dere will b catgurls? :3" <br><br>The best recruitment material just became a reality for them.</br></br></br>  <br>In the manga and LN he commanded the policemen beacuse the were confused, they holded on the enemy army for a quite time while the reinforcemends arrived under itami´s command if i remember correctly he lied about his rank to pull that off.</br>     Worst first episode <br>Yeah right.<br>Animation was great, music was good, and it was an originalish concept. This is at least decent.</br></br>  <br>So basically he's a Gary Stu then?</br>  <br>This is a shit season full of moeshit garbage. Rewatch LoGH</br>  <br>If I heard a fantasy civilization existed with a population that isn't full human I would ask myself that too.</br>  When will the Americans just fuck off?  <br> savior of the world <br> lose every war with commie <br> literally joining the war when the endings is nearby <br> cheating with the nuke <br><br>Aint even joke m8</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It said "out of energy" so I thought the phone battery was running out. I didn't see the next text that shows after that asking for cash.</br>  <br> muh gary stu gorilla <br> muh shoujoshit <br> muh badhouse <br><br>It's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think he just don't give a shit.</br>  <br><br><br>Catgirls are horrible entry-level slutfus.<br><br><br>The animation was pretty decent, but that's about all the episode had going for itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>enjoy your decade of financial crisis europoor</br>  <br> thread is just europeans complaining about Americans </br>  <br>nah he cares</br>   these threads <br><br>we get 2 whole cours of this<br><br> I'm in love </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm thinking it's everyone else being butthurt, and finding us a convenient fall guy.<br><br>The show has a promising amount of gun porn, and military equipment, this shit clearly caters to our interests more, after Japan of course.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragon girls in other hand.</br>  <br>That's some bad opinion, Harry.</br>  <br>It's fucking koreans, though.</br>  <br>  animation was great. <br><br>Anon there was a shitload of stills and at times it was janky as fuck. This was the first episode and the animation didn't even look good. Since A-1 is adapting 5 shows this season Gate is gonna end up with lots of shitty quality.</br></br></br>  Well, I came here do talk about chineese cartoons, but I must have clicked on /pol/ by accident. Honest mistake, I guess.  <br>Dont forget the Mexicans.  Amigo </br>  <br><br>I enjoyed it, I'll relish the battle in the next episode as orcs and dragons get gunned down and exploded.</br></br>  <br> Catgirls are horrible entry-level slutfus. <br>I like fox girls better, but that actually made me angry to the extend that I actually felt the energy to punch something swelling up in my arms. <br>Well done, you must be proud of yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>You want it be slower than this?</br>  <br>I could see there were off moments but over all the quality was very good. This seems like it might turn out good. Don't have low expectations just because other anime have turned out shit, this one might not.</br>  <br>That's what you get for being wrong on the Internet.</br>  <br> implying it isn't falseflagging Australians trying to start shit </br>  <br> 答えは？ </br>  <br>Fuck off poor assessment nigger.</br>  <br>10,000 year old loli dragon girls to be precise.<br><br> On the other hand, pic is for more refined gentlemen. </br></br></br>  <br> USA is the shit out of Eurpean's ass <br> USA speaks german like monkeys but they always said "muh english" <br> USA is the culture of fat fuckers full of hamburguers </br></br></br>  <br>Give example.</br>  <br>You could say that these threads are a  Gate  to /pol/</br>  <br>No way.</br>  <br> Americans <br><br>More like Chinese and Koreans.</br></br></br>  <br>NYAAA!!!! :3</br>  <br> MURRICANS THINK THEY'RE BETTER THAN EUROPOORS <br> USA IS A SHITTY COLONY OF EUROPOORS </br></br>  <br>Need more moe.</br>  <br>She's ruined<br>THEY RUINED HER</br></br>  Thought it would be trash, But I like it.<br><br>OST sounds fucking godly too, GIVE ME GOTH LOLI ALREADY.</br></br>  <br><br> Thread is Europeans complaining about nationalism and war, and saying its the damn Americans who are complaining. <br><br>I can't be the only American who's excited for gun porn, and explosions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>at least we can pay our debnts</br>   All these assblasted fat murricans crying this hard   this fucking ED  I love this thread and the fact that today is 4 july  <br><br>Nice posts. I'm really impressed by the quality.</br></br>  <br>m8, china owns the majority of your debt.</br>  Why you so jelly of Murrica all the time, rest of the world?  <br>Today is 3, are you posting from japan or the future? Fucking time travelers.</br>  <br>If yuros were the one's complaining, then who blames the americans?<br>I, as a citizen of ger "we hate ourselves" money, loved the episode.</br></br>  <br> people believe this </br>  <br>Literally an inferiority complex. That's why they come onto an American website created about an American to discuss American influenced cartoons.</br>  <br>Are you from the future?</br>  <br> &gt;People still walking the streets only a couple months after an I  9/11   inside job </br>  <br> july 4 <br>It's not.</br></br>  <br>Bravo in proving the stupid third worlder stereotype.</br>  What nationalism?<br><br>I didn't see a single Japanese katana folded 1000 times.</br></br>  <br>Jelly of a Murrifat that can even find his own penis in between his fat? Yup so jelly man</br>  <br>Im from 2chan and this thread makes me kekked</br>  OH GOD PLEASE TELL ME THIS MANGA IS JUST ONE BIG PARODY  These threads are all going to be terrible aren't they. Well I don't care I just hope this gets really popular, starts spawning copy cats and I get more soldiers killing magical shit.<br><br>And one day there will be an anime where a magical girl after a needlessly long transformation finds the monster of the week dead and she is being told by a soldier to go home and let the adults handle this.</br></br>  <br>That's his point you stupid fuck.</br>  Murrican and yuropoor buttblasted by a thread made by gook. Oh am i having a lafiing.<br/>  <br> let's all run into the garden of our great emperor to protect ourselves while our great army takes care of the bad guys </br>  <br>I prefer lamias.</br>  <br>Dude if you owe some money to buy a tank, will you pay the debt? You have tank.</br>  <br> Jelly of the country of heart diseases <br> Jelly of a country without culture <br> Jelly of a place full of xenophobic fatties who kills each other 24/7 <br> Jelly of a country who never wins a single war and always get BTFO or just send a couple of retard to the biggest wars to say "I participate in dis shit" <br> Jelly of the country who got rekt by muslims  <br><br>MURRICA PLZ.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The majority of the U.S. debt is owed to citizens and government branches within itself. China owes like...5 percent.</br>  <br> (americans are starting to wake up) <br> smibbly bibbly </br></br>  <br><br>Here<br/></br></br>  <br>Why are we getting posters like this right now?</br>  <br>Yeah, taking the civilians to a castle to protect them is so retarded.<br><br>Bait harder.</br></br></br>  <br>nah, he's probably some edgy 15yo faggot from america, who ironically enough is a pudgy antisocial retard</br>  <br> Implying fat murricans can get up from bed </br>  <br> US of Gay <br><br>America yes!</br></br></br>  <br> /pol/ <br> not liking nationalism and invading people who attacked you <br>Have you even been there?<br>That's reddit tier morals these guys complaining have.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He never got his doujins, so no.</br></br>  <br>What's so nationalistic to take refugee from incoming danger, does it matter if it imperial palace or not?</br>  <br>Honestly, what disappoints me about all of this is that I'm not against the idea of someone exploring and even reconstructing contemporary Japanese national identity after WW2 and the lost decades, but rather that it's always some buffoonish "Tojo did nothing wrong" Japanese ultranationalist fantasy.<br><br>Ian Fleming and John le Carré both explored the post-imperial UK in a world where it had been supplanted by the US and the USSR as the dominant world powers in a palatable way.<br><br>Hell, you want a Japanese example? Look at Golgo 13. More overpowered than a million boilerplate LN MCs blended together, but still not bad for a prominent post-war Japanese protagonist.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am enjoying the tread, faggot.</br>  <br>I'm jelly of your people nationalism actually.</br>  <br> You would never be cuddled by monster girls while firing at the scum of an enemy. <br><br>Feels bad man.</br></br></br>  I can't wait until he fucks all the goth lolis and cat girls.  <br>yes because the imperial palace is a place where commoners aren't allowed to enter inside. Hence the phone call where they even had to ask for permission.</br>  <br> not hiding in a castle to wait for help  <br><br>If this were 'murrica everyone would've grabbed their guns and fought the invaders back before the army arrived.</br></br></br>  <br>This murrican get rekt<br>Literally best thread in /a/</br></br>  <br>So the people is trampling the country honour to save their own skin. NATIONALISM!</br>  <br>It's being having common sense and humanity, not nationalistic.</br>  <br>They didnt actually ask for permission. They couldn't because its taboo in Japanese culture. But the Emperor called them to let them in.</br>    Post the moment you dropped this.  Why are britbongs so fucking poor?  <br>This first episode hardly had any. Lot of kids waited months to be able to shitpost about Japanese nationalism and being children, they just couldn't wait for the appropriate eps to do it.</br>  What will happened if the gate opened in  Sweden  instead?  <br>Why is she not holding a Thompson or a BAR?</br>  <br>I fucking loved that moment.<br><br>This so fucking much.

At least that's what you realize once you start seeing beyond good and evil.</br>  <br> Why don't they just destroy the gate? <br>Literally explained in the episode.<br> Why didn't US cooperate with Japan? <br> :^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>We already have a sizable military presence there, and have nuclear-powered aircraft carriers docked in their ports. Why do we need to invade them?</br>  <br>Both are trained soldiers, it just that the other one have just fallen off a flying drake.</br>  <br>I dont know anon, do you know anyone who rides wyverns to back that up?</br>  Out of all of the first episodes I've seen from this season, this was the worst.  <br> Why don't they just destroy the gate? <br> Why didn't US cooperate with Japan? <br><br>Both were addressed in the episode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because America can do it convincingly. Japan has no influence anywhere in the world, barely even on their own shores. Its just not believable, ya dig?</br>  <br>I did not even consider that<br><br>Fucking hacks</br></br></br>  The manga is my guilty pleasure. It has my two most favorite things: monstergirls and military.<br><br> I wonder if it will ever get localized in any of the languages I know </br></br>  <br>So amidst all the bitching in this thread does anyone have a link?</br>  <br>You underestimate how fucking hard it is to animate something. Especially something as complex as camo patterns.</br>  <br>I don't like it when America does it either.<br>What kind of defense is this?</br></br>  Putting aside if there are nationalism or not, it was pretty fucking bad  <br> Both were addressed <br>They were? What was the US excuse? I must have missed it.</br></br>  <br>I want summer to end.</br>  <br> That was the most surprising thing of the episode. <br>When the story was written Bush Junior is still in office. And the Japanese PM you see at the start is almost certainly meant to be Koizumi, and that explains why he suddenly left office and got replaced by the end of the episode.</br></br>  question about the scanlations: does the translation get better or should i just download the raws?  <br><br>They could do it Shaft style moving over a fixed pattern background image.</br></br>    Are these threads going to be as Kancolle?

Can you load this thing with stripper clips?  http://strawpoll.me/4819577  <br><br>G-guys, w-what if the loli's mom is still alive but was held captive on the otherside of the gate?<br><br> rape by countless medieval soldiers and humanoid beast <br> JSDF rescues her <br> able to reunited with her daughter <br> few months later suddenly find herself pregnant and the loli is going to have a halfbreed beast sibling soon </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Minimal gore is fine. It actually impressed me. I hate when shows just vomit blood in your face to pander to edgelords.</br>  /a/ warned me about gate threads for months, but I'm still surprised at how awful this thread turned out.  I thought Japan's constitution forbids their military from stepping outside Japanese soil? At least, that's what we made them sign, right?<br><br>Also, I would just send a dozen drones to scout out enemy bases and cities and barrage them with nukes.</br></br>  <br>Its not the 80s anymore, its all done with computers now. The camo has been changed because it would be time consuming, not because it would be difficult.</br>  <br> Navy changes their motto from "A global force for good" to "To get to you, they'd have to get by us: America's Navy." </br>  <br>Damn right, because America is the greatest country on Earth and everyone is happy to be liberated us. God bless America hoo-rah.</br>  <br> the false dichotomy <br><br>I see you've finally caught on. There's no way to win.</br></br></br>  <br>They ARE helping. Sending "personnel and funding".</br>  it was okay, you guys are overreacting because it's not settled in high school  <br>Gate's on Japan's soil, so it counts. Also, weren't there talks to do away with that part of Japan's constitution?</br>  <br>YES</br>  <br>Possibly, yes.</br>  <br>Looks that way</br>  <br>Then why the fuck was someone saying earlier JSDF blown the fuck out the US military?</br>  <br>They logic special region as part of Japan clay so it's fine.</br>  <br>They can step out if it's for self-defense of Japan or an allied country. They only can't start war/combat.</br>   airing this Japanese Nationalism bullshit just a day before 4th of July <br><br>I fucking swear these motherfuckers in Japan are doing this on purpose</br></br>  <br>They explain that away by saying the Gate is a part of Japanese territory. Of course whatever is inside belongs to Japan too of course.</br>  <br> like all the military equipment depicted aren't America's fucking hand-me-downs <br>it wasn't though. the camo was german, the tanks and guns (excluding m2 browning) were homemade, and i'm pretty sure that japan domestically produces their aircraft, albeit theyre all copies of american designs.</br></br>    <br>No gore makes it look sanitized and childish. Too much (as you say) makes it cheap and needlessly edgy. Best gore is tastefully applied gore, where its used sparingly and only at points where it will have weight and impact.</br>   has a job for the sole purpose of funding his hobby <br> if he has to chose he would chose the hobby <br> it's a full time job and now he doesn't even have the weekends free <br>That makes no sense. He can support his hobby by working part time and he would have more time for it.</br></br></br>  <br> They didn't show the dragon/wyvern killing people at the start <br> No people getting killed <br> No knights/lancers on horses stabbing people and running over them only one guy grazed by a sword <br> No declaration of war by the empire <br> MC not showing his plaque/identification <br> No catapults and rams attacking the imperial palace they didn't even mention them <br> No teargas/police charge <br> Political shit happening in japan was shown but not in the one going on in the other side of the gate <br> No soldier/tank camo, they just were standing there behind rocks <br><br>And i guess the rest of will be shown in the next episode.<br><br>Did i miss something?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   2 cour <br>Fucking Dropped</br>  <br>theyre probably keeping all the good stuff back at home in case china grows larger</br>   No eye pro <br> No ear pro <br><br>Didn't even deploy the Type 10 yet either.</br></br></br>  <br> anime can't air on a certain day due to its proximity to a foreign holiday </br>  <br>That happens separately in "secret". Publicly America is supporting Japan.</br>  <br>Yes, but there's a lot of dissent between Japanese citizens. I think having a military is fine, but in Japan's case it's kind of spooky since there are too many crazy right-wingers who want to return to the glorious pre-war Japan (no joke) in the team that supports the constitution change.<br><br>It's also kind of spooky that they air shit like this and Kancolle when Japan is starting to discuss this, although I don't want to sound like a tinfoil so don't take it too seriously. Just keep it in mind.</br></br></br>  Civilian here. I thought 2nd lieutenant is an officer position, why is he still hanging around the grunts?  <br> Of course whatever is inside belongs to Japan too of course. <br>And whatever belongs to Japan belongs to the grapest country in the world.<br><br><br>Two bombs weren't enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  So what's the elves' favorite part of Japanese culture?   2015 <br> HK G3 </br>  <br> dropping becaue of 2 cour <br><br>Otaku culture.<br>  They actually enjoy rape. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Japan's going to celebrate the 2nd best holiday in the world whether they want to or not.<br><br>First being Christmas.</br></br></br>  <br> I wish I was at home reading mangas <br><br> My feet hurt </br></br></br>  <br>God damnit now i can really grasp the lacking of the first episode.<br>I thought it was good enough but it could have been so much better. What a waste.</br></br>  <br>Shit show, shit thread. Like poetry.</br>  <br>I thought Japan had mostly F-4s at this time.</br>  <br><br><br>Didn't show kidnapping qts either.<br><br><br> So what's the elves' favorite part of Japanese culture? <br><br>Fat Middle aged Middle management salarymen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>-<br>No it wouldn't, because even if Americans were abnormally nationalist, it wouldn't be the same as Japanese nationalism, which is based on race.

We plan to spend half a year on the scenario, and work on the storyboard and settings during the upcoming spring. We will get started with the actual production in summer and plan to finish by 2014 winter. As of now, we have the funds to produce a 20 minute episode. However, if we can receive support through the Kickstarter program, we will be able to add 15 more minutes to the running time. The episode will be subtitled in 7 different languages.<br><br> When:  <br><br>Today at 5pm pdt @ anime expo<br><br>Come take an exclusive first look at the premiere of Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade! This will be the first time Little Witch Academia: The Enchanted Parade is screened in front of a live audience.

Movie is 100% guaranteed. <br><br>Update: I may stream both episodes on hitbox @ 830 est time<br><br> We are also aware that not everyone will be able to attend the premiere event.

But why should I care?  I'll be there.  <br> artbook <br>They're releasing it in digital format?</br></br>  Wait, so you'll be getting the new movie today?<br>I thought they would screen it today and screen it later.</br>  Why can they only give out SD versions for the backer rewards?  <br> I thought they would screen it today and screen it later. <br>Shit, I meant to say screen it today and distribute it later.</br></br>  <br>fuck trigger and their jew shit</br>  <br>No anon you are the shitposting jew</br>  <br><br>if you bought the perk for the regular edition of the blu ray and up you get the movie,ost,and artbook digitally.<br><br>I would assume if they release the movie tonight they MAY release the artbook and ost also. But the only thing guaranteed is the movie.<br><br><br><br>this is for anons who didnt attend anime expo.<br><br>Hence the upload and a possible stream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HD digital version isn't getting released until they ship the BDs.</br>  <br>O-oh, so OP doesn't wanna meet some /a/nons?</br>  Anybody going to upload the digital art book?  Still 5 hours?  <br>It starts 8 est, so three hours</br>  <br>Damn, I didn't back the kickstarter but I want the artbook.<br>I wonder if they will include it in the retail version of the BD.</br></br>  <br>Fuck, I'll be sleeping. Too tired to stay awake. Let's hope it will be great.</br>  <br><br>im not flying/driving across all of america to meet anyone.

Did she make it in or is that just a concept?</br>    <br>don't know</br>  i wish I backed more  <br><br>I wish I did too but at least I backed 100$.</br></br>  <br>She was in the exhibit but a bunch of other concepts weren't so maybe?</br>  Fuck, still 2 hours to go. You still planning to stream LWA1?  <br>gonna need a name or link for the stream</br>  MOVIE AIRS IN 20 MINS<br><br>I can stream it if anyone wants me to when it's live</br></br>  <br>20 minutes? I thought it started at 5pm PST, no?</br>  <br>Oh okay, you're right.<br>Tattun said 4:15pm for some reason?</br></br>  I'm pretty hype for that animation quality<br><br>How jelly are you of my super-cheap trigger autograph /a/?</br></br>  <br>step up<br> dat Mako though </br></br>  how long before good quality rips come out?  Damn. Why do I only learn about this now? I'm glad I backed one of the few Kickstarter projects that actually produced something. Soon we'll need the fingers of two hands to count them.  Lucky fuckers.  <br>Whose autograph is on the bottom right?</br>  <br><br>That 4:15 referred to yesterday's panel.</br></br>  I'm not at AX but I backed the project. Are they going to send an email to see the episode or something? I'm looking at this old email that says they'll release the digital contents so we can watch the episode at the same time, but it doesn't say how to access it.  <br>Shigeto Koyama?</br>  <br>I know as much as you do. The only thing we can do is wait for it to happen. I expect them to release a new update on Kickstarter with the details around the time the panel is held.</br>   tfw in line <br> pretty packed for a short animation <br> tfw didnt go early enough to get in line <br><br> don't shoot me if you see your face in the picture. Don't even mention it so no one knows it's you  :^)   </br></br></br></br>  <br> short animation <br>Isn't it like an hour long?</br></br>  <br>Maybe, but shilling has to be involved too.</br>  <br>It's supposed to be at least an hour long since it would have been the lenght of a normal anime episode without the crowdfunding.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty jelly anon. <br><br>I would've given them the poster to sign but I didn't know they were going to be at the convention. <br><br><br><br>Kofumi's</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Me on the right with white hair</br>  <br>Is that Mako with the white shirt? She isn't as genki in real life as I thought she'd be.</br>  <br> mfw I was at AX last year and out of nowhere won a raffle for a Koshimizu Ami and Yuzuki Ryouka autograph <br> didn't even go this year </br></br>  <br>That was a good panel.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6R8<wbr>x5k-BheE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>No wait I'm retarded<br><br>This anon  got it right. Kofumi is the one below Akko's face</br></br></br>  TORRENT WHEN<br>I didn't back it so I won't have access to the dl copy</br>  So are backers getting a link today?<br><br>I'm so confused</br></br>   tfw faggot normie train come and we had to move over an entire row <br> tfw now we're facing backwards <br> tfw someone farted too <br><br>I fucking hate this so much</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only part I really remember is Yuzuki trying to recall the lines of Satsuki's spiel in the first episode. I resisted the faint urge to shout "MUJUN KOSO SHINRI."</br>  <br>Originally it was going to be 25 minutes, the KS was to make it 40 minutes long. It got extended further because the story they wanted to tell needed more time to be fleshed out so the final running time is 60 minutes.</br>  <br>Are those posters only available at the event?</br>  Lotte is hot  <br>They fucked up the line now, there's a loop going around our row, moving and we're not moving.</br>  <br>Really? I thought it was only 45. Where did they say that it went up to 60 minutes?</br>  Does LWA2 have yuri or is it still hetshit  <br>I don't think it's 60 minutes, but when they announced that it was getting a theatrical run in Japan they said it got a bit longer.</br>  <br>The first one wasn't hetero, why this one would be?</br>  <br>I'm also wondering about this. Are they just going to throw the link up on the KS page when it starts or something?</br>  Wow has it really been two years already<br><br>Excited to see my name in the credits though.</br></br>  <br>https://twitter.com/LWA_jp/status/6<wbr>17051183673442304<br>Mass mail sending at 6pm.</br></wbr></br>  <br><br><br>From the official Twitter:<br> Our dear backers, please check your e-mail box on 06:00 pm (PST) around. <br><br><br>It's neither<br><br> hetshit <br>Fuck off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Excited to see my name in the credits though <br>Is this actually happening for all the backers?</br></br>  There are a bunch of muggle shotas with good taste that like Diana. The one girl of the group doesn't like her, though.  <br>Only the ones who donated more than $300.</br>  Pledged 60 buckarinos.  <br>Anyone who doesn't like Diana should just get murdered</br>  <br>It wouldn't have been as embarrassing as the stutterer trying to get Koshimizu to make love-making sounds or the bronies trying to give her a pony from Toys 'R Us.</br>  <br><br>IIRC she's also Tattun's favorite</br></br>  <br>Fuck, still more than an hour of waiting then.</br>  akko x diana doujins when  <br>soon</br>  <br><br><br> 6 pm Pacific Time <br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  When is 6PM pacific?

They were AX 2013 goodies</br>  Enough geography, post more Sucy.  Wait what? When will I be able to DL the second OVA/film?  What are the chances we fight Big Mom and Kaido at the same time?  dem quints  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127533436 <br>you in particular need to fuck off</br>  Pretty unlikely. Unless we got Shanks in there   Half of the crew after Big Mom <br> Taking out Doflamingo sets Kaido on their asses <br><br>Are we potentially walking into a Yonko vs Yonko vs Strawhat fight?</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127533583 <br>no, now you fuck off since this is a normal thread with a normal topic</br>  Crocodile flashback when  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  <br>Potentially yes, but I have a hard time seeing the Strawhats taking on one half of the yonko at the same time, regardless of their new pirate allies. Even with Shank's help, it's still looking pretty ugly.</br>  <br>I hope not cause that would introduce a fuck ton of more side characters who probably won't be relevant because they're just enemies. And the Dressrosa side characters would get shafted.</br>  <br><br>Croc and Daz were on their way to do SOMETHING so hopefully soon. I really need to see Croc getting Sanji'd in Kamabakka <br><br>also stop giving me new ships, I dont need to ship a dead man</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of see Big Mom becoming an ally. If Lola IS Mom's daughter, then Sanji-tachi are probably already chilling with her</br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>and Shachi!</br>  <br>He was a good father indeed.</br>  <br>0%<br><br>it took gear fourth to beat doflamingo and that's only because doflamingo had no active way of harming luffy while he was in that mode. Had there been any sort of help for doflamingo on that island the strawhats were toast.<br><br>Look at what Doflamingo was working with. It was literally him and a bunch of liabilities vs the world</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll try my best.  these threads really should be limited to release day <br>this shit is just annoying</br>  Damn today is Nami's birthday<br><br>someone remember that for the next OP</br></br>  <br>release day is the worst day. <br><br>It's just a by product of summer. People like to pretend it doesn't get worse in the summer but it does.</br></br></br>  <br>then I will post Nami</br>  <br> implying tripfags like you are not part of the problem </br>  <br>I am not. I only talk about One Piece and I have been reading longer than most of you have been alive.</br>  <br>Fuck no, release day threads are the worst of all because cancer from everywhere swarms to the threads and everything is crawling with plebbits, tumblerinas and people who are not even reading the manga and just want to shitpost.</br>  <br>and this is better?</br>  <br>Holy fuck, I want those</br>  <br>*tips fedora*</br>  <br>we are still in the post release day period, the threads will stay shitty like that until sunday</br>  What do you anons think about new SBS. I found 2 really interesting stuff.<br><br> D: I have a question for Odacchi. In "The White City", chapter 762 of volume 76, during the scene where Law stabs Cora-san, I found Crocodile printed on the paper Cora-san was reading. <br><br>So what was that article about? P.N. Yamamoto・Sugiyama・Hori<br><br>O: Yes. I'm quite impressed you found this one~. As you've pointed out, if you look really closely, you can find Crocodile there.<br><br>This was from the time when Law was 10 and Doflamingo was 25; 16 years ago from now. Crocodile was 30 at the time.<br><br>Similar to Luffy, back when he was young, Crocodile's name spread across the seas with incredible momentum, but soon after he was admitted into the Shichibukai in around his mid-20s, he tried to fight Whitebeard and and was completely and utterly crushed by him.<br><br>Though he seemingly tamed down at this point, his eyes became set on the kingdom of Alabasta, and it happened to be precisely during this time period that he was being featured in the papers as a hero who hunted down pirates. In other words, that was an article reporting the acts of heroism by Crocodile at the time!<br><br>This tells us a little bit more about Crocodile while he was still in adventure mode</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it so hard for you to just post without a name and trip?</br>  <br>And this one<br>D: The one who was with Barrels the pirate called "Dorry" was X Drake, captain of the Drake pirates, right?! It struck me when I saw the name "Diez", found the scar on his chin, and discovered that he comes from the sea of the North.<br><br>So does that mean that Barrels is Drake-san's father? from Kobe Prefecture, Kazuki-kun<br><br>O: Yes, that's correct!! Well done with your findings.<br><br>X Drake, along with Luffy and the others, is a member of the youthful "Worst Generation" of pirates that stirred up a great deal of commotion around the world. His father, Barrels, used to be a Marine Officer and Drake admired this, dreaming of becoming a great Marine just like him one day. However; who knows what happened, but his father suddenly turned into a pirate and became a terrible man who would physically abuse even his own son. Drake, who still believed in his past father and followed him around was aged 19 at this time (13 and a half years ago). Though that's a bit too old to be calling him a boy, he probably seemed to look a lot younger while he was weakened with the fear of his father. Later, he fatefully crossed paths with Law, and the Marines soon took custody of him, leading Drake to become a Marine. The thing is, as if resigning himself to fate, after Drake made his way all the way up to becoming a Rear Admiral in the Marines, he ended up leaving the navy and becoming a pirate himself!!<br><br>Just what happened? What's he thinking? Hey, you!! ---come onnnnnn.<br><br>I'm interested in seeing the future of Drake, who has also made an appearance in a cover series!!<br><br>So this almost certainly confirms that next Supernova we will get to know better is X Drake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Law turned way more interesting than he first seemed on sabaody but I can't see Drake getting the same treatment. He is just a T-rex.</br>  <br>just check the goddamn box, it isnt difficult</br>  <br>There is a lot that can be done. We haven't seen his hybrid forme, and with Doflamingo introducing the concept of Awakened DFs, X Drake can possibly transform random people and lamps into dinossaurs<br><br> We Scary Monsters now </br></br></br>  <br>I am pretty sure awakened Zoans do not work that way, but we don't really know jack shit about awakening at this point so who knows</br>  <br><br><br>Nah awakened zoans were introduced in impel down. They are like chopper where they heal faster than normal and have increased strength.</br></br></br>  <br>Buy them and show us.</br>  <br>Basically this as a pirate</br>  <br>Where are they sold?</br>  <br>They look official, so they should be easy enough to get. Check the buythread and the most well known weaboo stuff reseller from your country, or cdjapan.</br>  Lucci is a very good boy  <br>Meh he's alright, but not "good" by any means.</br>  <br>Nah. He's most likely a gorilla fruit or human fruit. Maybe Hydra or some other mythological zoan.</br>  <br>Reminder that if Luffy didn't waste time talking to citizens while in Gear 4 he could have just soloed Doffy. Also reminder that most of Luffy's "help" was fodder and only half of Luffy's crew was even on the island.</br>  <br>nah he needed King kong to put doffy down. He was going to use another kong gun before his time ran out not the huge king kong gun.</br>  <br>http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.p<wbr>hp/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction</wbr></br>  Post your best heart pirate comics  Nah, Big mom will probably be whatsherface's mother, that she told Nami to find in the New World.<br><br>Either that or she will want to clash with Kaidou and there will be a 3 way battle.</br></br>  <br> fodder <br>there is this word again</br></br>  <br> solo <br>He couldn't even beat him at the castle. Even a gamma knifed Dofla (who may have been mentally busy trying to control or hold together his strings patching up his organs) survived G4 Luffy, who needed rescue from everyone else to do it again.<br><br>Keep in mind Luffy was already pissed because of what he did to Bellamy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br>  <br> Hey, Penguin <br> If you win this one round against me, I'm willing to bottom <br> bottom... ! </br></br></br>  <br>She isn't going to just ally with them.

Model Buddha. Kaido may just have another model of a Human fruit. It's unlikely as all hell because if he ate a Human fruit, he'd be enlightened but he's cruel as all fuck so it seems unlikely. Both Chopper's and Sengoku's fruits are ''Hito Hito no mi''. It's just that Sengoku's is a different version.</br>  <br> it doesnt matter if they have different models you cant have two human-human fruits <br><br>Chopper and Sengoku are both Human-Human, the fuck are you on?</br></br></br>  <br>he didn't fucking specified that he could have the human human fruit you piece of shit, he just said that he could have a human fruit</br>  <br><br>also, marco's fruit is not even named so shut the fuck up</br></br>    <br> One more kong gun wouldn't have sealed the deal <br> got up just fine <br><br>standing isn't a big deal in One Piece and you don't exactly have a lot to stand on.</br></br></br></br>   there was people who hated the doffy/luffy fight <br><br>I've just caught up, and got to read it without any gaps and it was the best fight we've had in a long time.

The fights post time skip minus vergo has been been lackluster. Vergo has been the light in the darkness keeping us altogether</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, someone should make a compilation of all scenes were Luffy and Doffy fight, when you see all scenes together without any gaps between them it is one hell of a great fight</br>  <br> never actually read the manga <br> ellipses <br> all around typing like a faggot <br><br>Underage, please fuck off back to Reddit.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Yep, it was nice to see some actual choreography mixed in with the haki/df instead of move names and reaction images.</br>  <br> Vergo <br> good <br>Wow, Smoker threw a bunch of shitty hits, got his ass handed to him, and then Law one shot him. <br><br>Fuck off tripfag<br/></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Smoker acted as a distraction m8</br>  <br> and then Law one shot him. </br>    <br>there have not been any real great fights since Lucci vs Luffy to be honest, I don't care though since I am not a fightfag and am glad when the fight scenes are short.</br>    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Go back to fucking tunblr</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> soo, you've been like this <br> yeah, but we don't remember the culprits, what should we do? <br> isn't it good, you're young again <br> also really cute <br> damn i can't be in the crew like this, isn't there anything to do? <br> soo, you don't know the culprits, this might be a good adventure <br> it's kinda scary when capp'n seems to like this </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> battle shonen <br> don't like fights <br><br>why are you reading one piece instead of a pure gag manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>it is useless anon, thursdays and fridays are just shit days for OP threads and this sadly will never change</br>  <br>they are not going to listen <br>these threads are not about one piece anymore, just about these faggots spamming their shitty fan art</br></br>  <br>I did not say I do not like fights, it is just not the primary reason I read One Piece, I read it because I love pretty much all of the characters and the world building is just great and very intriguing.</br>  <br><br><br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off tumblrtard.</br>    <br> there have not been any real great fights since Lucci vs Luffy to be honest <br><br>Marineford was okay for what it was.

I guess Sabo and Barto's sticking around too?</br></br></br>  <br> implying the quasi totality of the colosseum fighters won't stick around as part of the LawHeart alliance <br>I love this meme</br></br>    When did One Piece get so fucking gay friendly holy shit  <br>When oda put all those gays in his story</br>  <br>For the whole series? Really unlikely</br>  <br>Since Alabasta, don't forget your shit</br>  <br>When your mother started sucking my big black dick every friday night</br>  Since Doflamingo accepted an half human hybrid in his crew does that mean that he's the only non racist Celestial Dragon? He's not that bad aster all.    <br>Nobody would be upset if Law ditches the alliance thing and officially becomes Mugiwara</br>  <br>Cancerous fujoshits acting cancerous.

But Alabasta was a REALLY gay arc</br>  I stopped reading one piece right before the time skip and I was wondering if any of you knew the manga site where the entire chapter is a scroll setup instead of opening a new link like niggastream.  <br><br>For the sake of speeding an eventual series resolution before 2030? Slim to not going to fucking happen. <br><br>This is One Piece, and it has One Pace, and that is slow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>funkfreed ate the elephant fruit<br>that one is a smile however</br></br>  <br>http://mangayou.com/mangaeden-en/on<wbr>e-piece-2<br><br>I don't think they have the latest chapter though.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>well i dont know. A hell of a lot of shit happened in Dressrosa. The introduction of all those new characters would STILL be happening he Oda hadnt crammed them all into the coliseum<br><br>Perhaps he IS hurrying things from this point on</br></br></br>  <br>You may have a point. Luffy made a lot of friends over the 12 years Oda wrote the first half of the story, but none are quality allies for the New World. Getting the core allies out of the way in one arc makes a lot more sense than a slow grind building a fleet from each island</br>  <br><br> new chars/enemies <br> 15 years worth of SJ full of flashbacks <br> 3 chapters with some facts <br> even more years of flashbacks <br><br>rinse &amp; repeat<br><br>Someone please go to Japan and kill Oda,OP was once interesting now it's just a fucking huge cow with unlimited milk</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to the point of fighting 2 Yonko at the same time.</br>  <br>yeah but what if<br/></br>  <br>no</br>  I just realized that if luffy and co. Defeat kaido at wano the world might not even know about it since wano doesn't really tell things to the world. But then I realized that Absalom will be a key figure. He will report to the world luffy and co. slayed kaido. His report will have the power to change the world  <br><br>Eating her own crew is a huge no to Luffy. We know so little of Kaido that the surprise ally thing could work, but our only exposure to Big Mom has been too negative to pull a reversal</br></br>  <br><br>Thank you I'd have a beer with you irl.</br></br>  What devil fruit would goku have <br>What devil fruit would gon have<br>What devil fruit would naruto have<br>What devil fruit would usake urmishsi have</br></br></br>  <br><br>yeah sorry forgot about him and his pauses,unlike valve he can indeed count to 3 but 4 is an unknown number to him</br></br>  <br>Nothing much. Lola's Vivre Card may get Nami's group out of immediate danger but they might still want Caesar. And Big Mom is going to be even more pissed when her treasure explodes. It's basically a 'Get out of jail once' card. Nothing more, imo.</br>  <br>Was that a Half-Life reference?</br>  <br>Monkey zoan<br>Hair parameica<br>Energy logia<br>Laser paramecia</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, stop copying and pasting this. Kaido is not gonna be an ant Zoan.</br>  anybody noticed one of the neighboring islands that received the broadcast is covered in snow? <br><br>maybe we'll see bonney soon.</br></br>  <br>'Be kind whenever possible. It's always possible'.<br>I don't drink but I appreciate the thought. Enjoy those extra chapters while you can.</br></br>  <br>Why I just want to tell others my theory</br>  <br>Was that the first mention of Hancock?</br>  <br>They might still know since the Marines track the Yonko. But you're right, it's probably going to be Absalom. Which reminds me, Moria might pop at the end of Wano to jump Kaido's ass. With a shadow like that, Moria could start wrecking shit again.</br>  <br>But Doflanon is the best anon</br>  Arlong is on Wano aint he?<br><br>Can Drake Law Luffy and Gekko really defeat Kaido? <br><br>I'm sad Brook cannot get laid.<br><br>Isn't Enel and Robin related?<br><br>Jimbie when?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want too but I don't like everybody being on NW islands that are a days trip from the Red Line. Law, Doffy, Drake, Smoker, Wano, Big Mom's ship, possibly Kaido all at the beginning of the ocean</br>  <br>Is this bait ?</br>  <br><br>But since kaido will fall and a new yonko position opens up what if moriah tells Absalom to make it seem like he did it? This could be the perfect revenge against kaido and let moriah be a big shot again.</br></br>  <br><br>I read it mostly for the world building and adventure.</br></br>  I'm rereading the end of dressrosa and I'm crying like a bitch at senor pink flashback. And I already cried like a bitch at law's flashback.<br> Franky best bro </br>  <br>Moria wants to be Pirate King though. And his motto is "Let other people do it". If anything, he'd just let Luffy have it so Luffy can beat all the others and Moria can jump Luffy's ass when he's at the finish line.</br>  <br>Has way more depth than any of the others and still has a sense of adventure romance and friendship, and watching all of those things desintegrate in the eyes of luffy<br><br>Sanji trying to coock for luffy because was jealous <br><br>Robin being an smart bitch<br><br>Nami being cold with ussop <br><br>Everyone screaming for luffy and the haki of the girl hearing them<br><br>Everyone forgot at the end but luffy don't so he has that to remember how much they mean for him to lost them<br><br>Luffy didn't won but still was a masterpiece</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> that whole sequence, from start to finish <br><br>Absolutely hard-boiled.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That'll be for the Dragon arc. One of his bases looks like a post apocalyptic desert</br>  <br> Franky best bro <br>Look, I love Franky as much as the next guy but let's not throw around words that have no meaning.</br></br>  <br><br> post apocalyptic desert <br><br>Well there's that fanart of Mad Max in Oda style too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So did Yuba. I think deserts in OP are just fucked in general.</br>  <br>How do you think this discussion began ?</br>  Is the law wanking finally over?  <br> Sanji trying to cook for luffy because was jealous <br>that was an unexpectedly cute moment<br><br> Nami being cold with ussop <br>and this one was unexpectedly painful. I learned from this movie that it physically pains me if Usopp and Nami aren't on excellent terms<br><br>The most painful thing though was Sanji telling Luffy that it was all his fault the crew was falling apart. The way Luffy sort of shut down at that...after saying he trusted his crew at the beginning killed me. I had to pause the movie and think about my life for a few minutes<br><br>Also made me think about group dynamics more. Had Franky been there, I doubt the crew would have fallen apart unnoticed like it did</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeh but another reason I think it'll be post-apocalyptic is because we need a Dragon backstory. Why did he decide to spend the rest of his life raising an army against the WG? It has to be something ludicrously fucked up the WG did in the past, like nuking entire nations or something.</br>  <br><br>Oh shit just clicked on the thread, alright cool.<br><br> marines finally discover and raid Baltigo <br> rusty cars, rigs and explosives <br><br>Muh dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It has only just begun Ace</br>  Luffy could barely beat Doffy, we need another timeskip before Yonko..<br><br>Of course natural progression would be nice, but Oda's main weakness is writing and the passing of time.</br></br>  <br>Never.</br>  <br>It's probably just something to do with the Void Century and the Tenryuubito's shenanigans.</br>  <br><br> timeskip <br><br>We still don't know what else went on that island - Oda can do as many powerups as he likes really. <br><br> King Kong didn't even work on this one! <br> Gear 5th <br> etc. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   oh shit it's Jesus Burgess! <br> he's so strong dude wow <br> oh man he took out everyone in that Arena <br> gets defeated almost entirely off-camera <br><br>the fuck?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Maybe Rayleigh/another Roger member spoiled it for him. <br><br>Rayleigh was open to revealing it at Sabaody until Luffy said so.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard and Kidd wants to become PK. BB is already a yonko and Kidd is picking a fight with a yonko right now. Its not only about being PK. Law said that to survive in the new world you either ally with a yonko or try to become one. Moriah becoming a yonko would make him a bit closer to being PK.</br>  <br> Big Mom <br>Lola's rescue at Thriller Bark will ameliorate tensions, Luffy and Big Mom will bond over food.</br></br>  <br>I hate that though.<br><br>What excuse did Luffy have for risking everyone's lives when he knows they're under a hard time limit. WHAT POSSIBLE REASON could he have for doing something that would lock him out for 10minutes?!<br><br>When he had something stronger?!<br><br>It makes no sense.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you expect ? He was obviously nowhere near Teach in terms of strength before the TS. Why would things be so drastically different now ?</br>  <br><br>Well he'll pull some shit like 'I couldn't get it to work fully back then'.<br><br>Or 'I didn't think I was ready'.</br></br></br></br>  Okay so who do you all really want to see fuck? Can be /y/, /u/, straight, hell, it can be Usopp and Matsuge for all I care. Just give me names.  <br>Because Teach is supposed to become the main antagonist and his fucking crew should be a threat.</br>  <br>Trunks from the future and Slifer</br>  Ha ha! TIME FOR SANJII  <br><br>Robin and anyone.<br><br>I just really want to see Robin fuck m8.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>His fatal mistake was making robin 6'2. Makes me feel like a little bitch</br></br>  <br><br>If you're under even 6" you are.</br></br>  <br>Luffy didn't give 2 shits about the Void Century. It was Robin who said she'll pass. <br><br><br>Yea but Moria spent 10 years in the Florian Triangle just to get a strong enough crew to get to the New World. He's a dumbass. He's probably going to be smart and not put himself in the front lines where people of Kaido's status reign.</br></br></br></br>  792 was the most recent chapter, right?  <br><br>Oh shit my bad that was One Piece.<br><br>Point still stands though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bet you can't do this: the blugori leader in impell down with lucky roo</br>  <br>769*</br>  <br>  if they have different models you cant have two human-human fruits, you have mythical and ancient due to the animal/organism they portray <br>So the only mythical human in the world is buddha? Holy fuck you are a retard.<br>Oda can literally make a mythical zoan of zeus, odin even jesus and you say that there can not be more than 2? Of course he won't because that would be very op</br></br></br>  <br>Whitebeard was the Strongest man in the World. Yet Marco and Jozu were nothing compared to him.

Luffy wasn't even involved. Teach and Luffy can be a league above with Teach's crew still being dangerous.

You quoted the wrong post them.</br>  <br>what if he was an ant that ate a hito hito mythological fruit</br>  <br> wah wah fujos in my thread <br> meanwhile all other threads except the hxh and free! ones are full of horny, circlejerking NEETs </br></br>  <br>Actually besides you I wrote all the posts here</br>  I thought this arc was pretty meh reading it weekly, but I just finished rereading it and it's without doubt one of the best arcs in the whole series.  <br>CHECK'd</br>  <br>What model though ? That's the important part.</br>  <br>Time for some Doffy Vergo.</br>  <br>You know your shitpost fails when you get mad for real right? It shows in your writing vices.</br>  <br>Fuck off alpha2late</br>  We be streaming Syrup village arc over here. Get ready for lies.<br>http://www.livestream.com/thisfinet<wbr>emperedstream</wbr></br>  <br>Typical, she keeps samefagging over and over and over until half the thread is her. I think it's some manlet fag with issues trying to shit threads that trigger him.</br>  <br><br>Anon is playing detective, tremble homodachis, anon is coming for you.<br>Pic related, it's a hint.</br></br></br>  whats with all the gay stuff in here  <br>what happens in slower chapters.<br><br>Though this chapter had some good stuff to discuss people have been trolling since the release thread.<br><br>If you guys are looking for something to get back on track discuss whether or not you think Akainu is pissed and predict what will happen to fujitora<br><br>My bets is a magma fist through the gut. Some people think Akainu is pleased.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it was fairly chill in here until a few minutes ago. Dunno who blasted that guy's ass but the porn really wasnt necessary</br>  <br>Summer came and was surprised at the moderate amount of gay stuff routinely being posted here, so they started complaining, and it escalated. It's been like this for a few days now.<br>It's fun, but at the same time, it's tiring, and annoying. We can't have actual discussions anymore. It's all just gay posting and complaining about the gay posting.</br></br>  <br>why must you torment us just let us have a manly shounen without having them fuck :(</br>  <br>There's not much left to discuss, I'm bored, and the thread had already become a trainwreck anyway, so why not post homos. <br><br>Pretty sure he's mad as fuck. I don't think he'll hurt Fujitora just yet, but it's certainly going to happen sometime in the future.</br></br></br>  <br> this new <br><br>faggotry was never the norm through, the only big cancer on late years was the sanjihatefag, also a few irl retards who weren't really trolling, just dumb.<br><br>The gay fag is fairly newer and always ends banned and erased when 3/4 people report him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I honestly think Akainu mellowed out somewhat. Fuji definitely won't get blasted because "he" saved the country and uncovered Doffy's shenanigans.</br>  <br>It's still a manly shonen, what are you even talking about. It doesn't matter how many dicks Zoro sucked in fanon, he's still manly.<br>You don't have to approve of everything that's being posted here. Ignore it, talk about something else.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off newfag fujoshit.<br><br>Hope you get banned like your fellow Jinbei hambeast.</br></br></br>  <br> I honestly think Akainu mellowed out somewhat. <br><br>No way. This is *his* marinecorp at stake. His is the one on the line. I can't see him not being angry over fujitora letting a bunch of pirates escape. They nuked a country of librarians women and children but somehow fujitora chose dressrosa over a potential bargaining chip against Dragon not to mention all of dragon's forces that are currently on the island, a shichibukai traitor rather than one who was still actively helping them AND one of blackbeards men. All of these were wounded and would have been easy pickings for fujitora and the rest of the Navy but he instead wanted to broadcast himself apologizing to serve his own agenda<br><br>I can't see him walking away from this without at least losing an arm or a leg or something to magma.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was him, too. He saves billion of gay pics in order to shitpost. Can you imagine an autistic kid with a pc full of thousands over thousands of gay porn pics just for the sake of shitposting? kek.</br>  <br> faggotry was never the norm through <br>Have we browsed the same thread these last months ?<br> the gay fag <br> there is only one <br>Hahaha no. Hell I can list a few regular posters I know: There is Lawlu anon, the Dellingerfag who also likes Robin, Dentist anon, me, and the Bellamy anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  everyone is being savage in this thread and there's no chillll. Let fix that by posting our sexiest pics. But keep it censored since these discussionfags can't handle a little cock. (Or should I say big cock)  <br>is that what's fucking happening? Jesus, that's worse than the nutso from 2 days ago wanting to kill people for posting fanart</br>  <br>Have you ever heard Akainu apologise to anyone else ? He probably isn't the same dude he was back then. And Fujitora didn't do perfect but he still did good and he may have increased relations with a country that previously had a king who didn't care about the WG or the Marines.</br>  <br><br>No it's not, I'm not the Jinbeifag.<br>But it's true that I have thousands of gay porn pics.</br></br></br>  <br>As much as I like this stuff, as long as you can't somehow make it related to the thread, go to /cm/ or /y/ instead.</br>  <br> last months <br> months <br><br>Newfags are truly cancer after all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for admitting you are a newfag fujoshit.<br><br>How does it feel that one of your fellow hambeasts gets permabanned all the time for starting that Luccishit?<br><br>The next person on the list to get permabanned should be the penguinfaggot.<br><br>One by one, you fujoshits will get banned from /a/.<br><br>You likely are the same fujoshits as the ones from the SnK generals.<br><br>You fujoshits post exactly like the cancer in SnK threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry.... I just saw everyone else posting things like this and thought we were sharing our collections.</br>  <br><br><br>Also think about it this way. If Akainu doesn't put his footdown now it only paves the way for more marines to do what they feel is right rather than whatever orders he gives. It will become a slippery slope<br><br> Admiral Fujitora let some pirates escape why can't I <br> Vice Admiral Momonga let some pirates escape and rescued one why can't I <br>etc<br><br>There was nothing good about what fujitora did except the shutdown of smiles on the blackmarket<br><br>But I bet the WG would take a billion smiles out there on the ocean rather than luffy/sabo/law/burgess/island full of pirates getting away scott free. At least they knew where Doflamingo stood.<br><br>Instead they lost an ally and gave more power to someone who has been causing them trouble at every turn and is the son of their biggest thorn in their side.<br><br>he is going to be furious</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>how can i ignore this anon just look at that, its some hot shit and no matter what im going to have to see it</br></br>  Reminder that the last week's leak confirmed the next arc's name<br><br><br>You are not allowed here actually. You are literally forbidden to posting on 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br>you forgot killer, but if something like a yonko war takes place I hope it happens something like this:<br>Big Mom+StrawHeart Alliance (1 Yonko, 3 supernovas and sanji)<br>Vs<br>Kaido+X Drake+KidHawPoo Alliance (1 Yonko, 5 supernovas with drake changing sides in some moment)</br></br></br></br>  <br> and the Bellamy anon <br>I think that one is me unless someone else is out for his pitiable dick while im not here</br></br>  <br><br>Now this is an actual samefag.</br></br>  <br>What do you mean</br>  <br>if we had to rate all the supernovas in order of strength where you do you think sanji comes in<br><br><br>kidd<br>luffy<br>law<br>zoro<br>killer<br>apoo<br>sanji&lt;--?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dentist anon has been posting relentlessly, almost every day since January though. Don't you think that if someone wanted to permaban him, they would have done it by now ?<br> you likely are the same fujoshits as the ones from the SnK generals <br>Eh, nope, sorry to disapoint, guess there are more of us than you'd like.<br> one by one, you fujoshits will get banned from /a/ <br>They've been here ever since /a/ existed.<br>Who's the newfag here, I wonder<br><br><br>Nah, just not born in an english speaking country. Thanks for the grammar lesson.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no dicks, anon.<br>keep it worksafe/vanilla as you can manage</br></br>  <br>You can share your collection somewhere the fuck else<br><br>YOU ARE NOT WELCOME HERE</br></br></br>   http://original.livestream.com/this<wbr>finetemperedstream</wbr> <br> We're all alone here. Come in and have some fun with us. </br>  Why are One Piece threads all of a sudden full of Yaoi?  <br> They've been here ever since /a/ existed. <br><br>As expected of a newfag hambeast.<br><br>Ever wonder why there were never any Hetalia threads when it aired for the first time ever?<br><br>It's because /a/ kicked them out to /cm/.<br><br>You fujoshits were never welcomed on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not getting it. The Marines are most likely not going to give Luffy credit for Dressrosa. It's going to be like Arabasta again. And if there are Marines who follow a morale justice code, they will do what they think is right regardless of orders. Smoker is a great example. But most of the Marines don't so that's not going to be an issue. I'm not saying Fujitora is going to be able to jump around all willy nilly but he definitely won't get hurt.</br>   8 seconds apart <br> 8 Seconds <br><br>Can you please, please lurk moar at least, before trying to shitpost?</br></br></br>  <br> just not born in an english speaking country. <br><br>As expected of third world scum, their fujoshits are equally third world.</br></br></br>  <br>that anon in particular is actually trolling.<br><br>I'd just hide everything else though</br></br></br>  <br> Ever wonder why there were never any Hetalia threads when it aired for the first time ever? <br>Nah, I never wondered and I don't give a fuck.</br></br>  <br> last months? <br>and? last few months doesnt mean it's been here forever. last few months is still considered fairly new.<br><br> There is Lawlu anon, the Dellingerfag who also likes Robin, Dentist anon, me, and the Bellamy anon. <br>Fuck. Listing off known fujofags like thats not a fucking problem. Why use a fucking anonymous board when you can do the same shit on tumblr or where ever the hell you came from? It's bad enough we've still got tripfags here, but at least the one right now is pushing discussion. At least the mods are doing something about the Luccifag too and the Rebeccafag only shits up threads once in a while.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you quoting my dubs post to refer to another one, I'm just laughing that you admitted to be a few months new.<br><br> not being a burger means you can be shit at english while speaking english at others <br><br>No, you can be some spic or autistic german, if you can't evern write in a language you force yourself, it means you are retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  I wish they would animate shanks stopping kaido before the war. Shanks crew is pretty bad ass.  <br>I didn't forget Killer though ? Read carefully next time. He's between Hawkins and Law.<br><br><br>Sanji isn't in the Supernova's so he won't be in the list at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> . The Marines are most likely not going to give Luffy credit for Dressrosa <br><br><br>uh they already have<br><br>did you not read the last page...<br><br> get that to press <br> luffy/law has brought down doflamingo </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know that. You included "and sanji" so I am asking you where do you think he fits in with the rest of the actual supernovas.</br>  <br>the only problem is this new kid posting porn because they don't seem to know any better<br><br>No one else is actually breaking any rules</br></br></br>  <br> a few months new <br>I only admitted to be a few months new (more like a year actually) to browsing the OP thread regularly. Nothing else. <br> if you can't evern write in a language you force yourself, it means you are retarded <br>Okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Akainu and the gov fags will be mad as fuck at it<br><br><br><br>fujofags were never welcome here and always got kicked the fuck out by anyone with more than a few years here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're not getting it. The Marines are most likely not going to give Luffy credit for Dressrosa. It's going to be like Arabasta again. <br>did you even read the last fucking chapter</br></br>  <br>They have not. Some news reporter/camera guy Wants to tell the news. But who controls that ? The WG. Along with Doffy's sensitive case, they most likely would want to keep this under the rug.</br>  <br> new kid posting porn because they don't seem to know any better <br> new kid <br>As if, it's just a reverse troll trying to give us a bad name by acting overly tumblr friendly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>whether you like them or not is irrelevant since there's nothing wrong with them posting here</br></br>  <br> admitting to be new on OP threads and raiding them without even lurking first. <br> agreing on being an illiterate tard <br><br>Nigga, it's like you insult people and then you beat yourself up, says they gonna rape your mom or something, proceeding to rape your own face with a shitcoated stick. Why?</br></br></br></br>  <br>where do you think the reporter guy got the news...<br><br>it was the camera feed</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't include Sanji. I included Killer, even though that guy just didn't see his name on my post, I guess.</br>  <br>im actually starting to think it's that asshole who kept making new threads that got deleted</br>  <br>Some faggot who dropped here this year. If people hide and report like last time, he'd be banned already, again.</br>  <br>Wait a minute, you're right. But why would they know that ? Fujitora didn't say that Luffy and Law took down Doffy, did he ?</br>   yfw people actually think summer is any different   <br>your new kid seems like an obvious shitposter ironically posting fujopornshit. You could tell by his ;)s and his last posts about thinking everyone had their own fujoshit collection</br>  <br>I think it's a problem for me because it's a testament of how much time I actually spend here.<br>I don't really see how that's a problem otherwise. Of course you'd be able to recognize regulars if you spent enough time in any permanent thread. They're still anonymous to everyone but me.</br></br>  <br><br>How can Fuji even have permission for that?<br><br><br> this new <br><br>You see, there's a site called reddit. It's more your face, m8, go try them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only reason One Piece is extremely succesfull is because of the world building. From a storytelling point of view it's pretty average.  <br>they aren't contributing any thing except their gay fan fiction, you need to fuck off to /b/ you're basically the pony posters of this board. If you're posting pics that don't relate to the threads topic then you need to stop</br>  <br>that's sad and pathetic even for 4chan standards</br>  <br>he did. it's implied he said more than just what we saw explaining everything that happened<br><br><br><br>he definitely didnt have permission which is why I am anticipating magma fisting</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It pains me that the only BD rip with English subs I can find of this movie has some of the worst audio I have ever heard in my life.</br>  <br> claiming everything is new instead of refuting me <br><br>you know damn well that posters rarely skirt that line. You could look all day for some rule to get me banned for posting a pic of dudes hugging</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you don't know how long I've been here</br>  <br>talking about the characters is OP related</br>  <br> only reason <br>I'd argue that I read One Piece for its characters and art too. And if the only reason for One Piece's extreme success was world building, I could name a bunch of other series that have good world building too but arent that popular. I wouldnt say it's the best at story telling but I think it's at least above average.</br></br>  <br>No it will be too much for them to handle. At the best after big mom is severely weakened by the alliances. Kaido decide to be a bastard and attack big mom while she is weak.</br>  <br>that's a shame. I just ripped one from youtube but thinking now, I never did watch it back. I should do that</br>  <br> Nigga, it's like you insult people and then you beat yourself up, says they gonna rape your mom or something, proceeding to rape your own face with a shitcoated stick. Why? <br>I'm not beating myseIf up, I just don't care what you guys think, I'm not taking you for the serious shit you guys seem to think you are, and I'm actually kind of bewildered at the sheer idiocy I'm witnessing right now. Not that I've never seen stupid shit ever since I started browsing 4chan, but damn.<br><br><br>Nah, I only made the Monet and the Hancock one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the Mancock thread would have stayed up if you'd worded the OP more neutrally</br>  <br>does bellamy have a beercan dick</br>  <br><br>Whoopsies, sorry, you weren't talking about me. With all these retards speaking to me, I'm starting to feel like I'm hot shit, I apologize.</br></br>  <br>Huh. I was completely under the impression that no one except Dressrosa knew the truth. But then again, would Akainu care about this ? Wouldn't it just be the Gorosei who cares ? And Akainu is kinda pissed at them already so maybe he'll let Fuji off the hook ?<br><br>I'm sorry if I was being a cunt before, Anon. I just didn't know.</br></br></br>  <br>Talking about fan fiction is extremely low quality since you have no experience writing a successful book and only want an excuse to shit up a thread, stay on topic and discuss the official plot/chapter you fucking clown</br>  <br>I thought it was neutral, I meant for it to work. Maybe it would have been fine any other day, but I guess everyone was just too angry back then. Both the mods and the posters.</br>  <br>Sanji is right behind Zoro, neither of them(supernovas and sanji) had shown us their full potential, sanji might not be a supernova but thats just because the WG didn't put him a proper bounty, he is strong (he has to be, i mean, he disapeared completly, he must have an epic mr prince comeback i count on that) <br><br>Oops, I missed him, sory for that</br></br></br>  <br>what? where'd you even find that thought?</br>  <br>No I don't care, and neither do you.</br>  <br>The marines and the WG have an understanding. More so than that Fujitora acted above his paygrade making decisions that could have taken one call into headquarters to ask about before he did it.<br><br>There is no way akainu wants Luffy to have credit for this. None in the world. More so than that Fujitora will let him get away. Akainu spent the entire timeskip making the marines in his image, conscripting stronger force, moving the navy base into the new world to deal with pirates and here is someone apologizing for the way they do things.<br><br>There is no way that Akainu let's fujitora get away with this.<br><br>Even more so than that the WG is going to be peeved some admiral thinks that he can act for them without their permission as well. They are tools of the WG. Not the other way around. You follow orders. That's the way the military works. Whether you like them or not. You can go doing things on your own as a rogue agent. If he didn't like the shichibukai he could have brought up at a meeting and discussed ways on getting rid of them. <br><br>Instead he went about it in the worse way possible making the marines and WG look bad as well as making pirates look good.<br><br>This can't be good in terms of PR for the Navy. They need the citizens on their side.<br><br>It's going to be disaster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>where were you when luccifag was getting banned. lucci is an op character too so by your logic he wasnt shitposting? what's the difference between luccifag and penguinfag? you fujoshits think you deserve special pandering or someshit. penguinfag will get banned if they keep that shit up.</br>  <br> Talking about fan fiction <br><br>it's not fanfiction because you declare that it is. Simply talking about the characters is fine. Trying to shove discussion into categories you can easily dismiss just makes you a nuisance</br></br></br>  <br>he's a big guy.</br>  <br>you're comparing one guy posting the same line every 20 minutes to people actually having conversations though<br><br>the two situations don't equate no matter how much you want them to</br></br></br>  <br>He's been posting almost everyday for more than half a year.<br>You're desperate, aren't you ? Why don't you go cry to a mod, I'm sure they'll listen. They never listened up till now though.</br></br>  <br>Literally everybody in Dressrosa already knows that Luffy defeated Doflamingo.<br><br>It's not like Alabasta where everybody was killing each other in a civil war and didn't pay attention to what happened to Crocodile, or in Thriller Bark where the only witness were the Lola pirates.<br><br>Now every civilian or a major New World country knows that Luffy defeated a Shichibukai, and the only way to keep them quiet would be a Buster Call on an entire nation.<br><br>This is the worst possible outcome for the World Goverment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was fanfiction because, you know, it's not in the manga nor is it one of it's themes.</br>  <br>well that's your mistake and you should do alittle research before spouting words you don't understand</br>  <br>It's so great to see the WG starting to lose their shit. Oda made a good job in making me hate them.</br>  <br>Know Sengoku is human Buddha. I would change it to no but it works.<br><br>ONLY choppers fruit offers enlightenment if a human eats it.</br></br></br>  <br>No, no, I know Dressrosa knew it but the reporter guy was speaking from the Ice place, I think. I just wasn't aware that Fujitora actually mentioned who beat Doffy.</br>  <br>he proved that the navy can not control the warlords, if he can get to that world meeting he has a very good case to make.</br>  <br> [Weeping Screaming] <br> ability: can create invisible barriers </br></br>  <br>if im remembering right, you referenced the drama in the preceding thread. It was bound to start with shitposting that way.<br><br>Each thread has to be its own thing.<br><br><br>I don't know intricacies of the Bane meme. Thanks for the pic though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying he makes it to the world meeting after this  <br><br>lol<br><br>It's like I am the only one who have been paying attention to the politics of this world. After this epic fuck up and how much control the world government wants fujitora is LUCKY if he only gets his title stripped</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking fuck off you pony posting fucktard</br>  <br>  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan<wbr>_fiction</wbr> <br>I don't know, my description seems to fit.</br></br>  <br>well they're different models of hito-hito so that's not surprising</br>  <br>Why ? Both Sengoku's and Chopper's are the same type.</br>  <br> becoming buddha doesn't offer enlightenment </br>  <br>it doesnt really. unless everything discussed here is fanfiction, you're going to have to learn the difference between creating stories and speculation</br>  <br>Don't bother answering him at this point, he's trolling you.</br>  <br>yeah I talked to this same guy not too long ago</br>  <br><br> becoming buddha doesn't offer enlightenment </br></br>  <br>Speculation - luffys gear 5 is going to be <br><br>Fan fiction - *posts gay fan art from tumblr* luffy x zolo</br></br></br>  <br>Trust me, it wasn't me.

He was very similar to Shirou in life. Difference is that Shirou knows he can't achieve his dream, so he doesn't bother with the contract with Alaya.</br>  <br>what the actual fuck</br>  <br>10/10 anime material</br>  <br> Nikos Pappadopulous <br>my sides are in outerspace</br></br>  <br>I know. But Archer's more vocal with his snarking tendencies than Shirou.<br>My point was that Archer is more arousing for Rin.</br></br>  <br>You mean physically or mentally? If physically, we've already seen that Shirou will get an Archer like build in time. If mentally, it's just a matter of getting Shirou to open up about his thoughts.</br>  <br>As an original, Archer is Archer. Plus there's this NTR bonus of him being his other self.<br>Welp, time to look for Archer x Rin doujins.</br></br>  "Heaven's Feel only going to be one movie"<br><br>What they said in Anime Expo<br>https://soundcloud.com/karoshi-4/vo<wbr>ice-003-001</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Miura complained that he didn't have enough time to work in the OPs.<br><br>That faggot should always work on a tight schedule to deliver decent stuff like the Vita OPs.<br><br><br>Full retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the shitposting during the airing was huge though, now that it's over Fate threads are actually enjoyable again.</br>  <br>Yes like that.

So let's have a DxD thread.<br><br>Reminder that all DxDs are a best  including Asia  but Rossweisse is super-best.<br><br>Recent news includes v20's cover being posted and v20 spoilers should be out in 15 days.<br><br>Oh yeah, and friendly reminder that DxD might get licensed in less than 72 hours.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The ride never ends.  bump  <br>will ishibumi finally out vali or is vali going to stay in the closet</br>  DxD has the best advertising.        <br>Ishibumi confirmed that Vali will be outed Vol 21</br>  anime only fag here. Does anyone know how well season 3 did in Japan? Like how high the viewer count was. I keep hearing that the anime did really well on kissanime but that doesn't contribute at all to money. <br> <br>Just asking to try and figure out the likeliness of a season 4.</br></br>  <br>vali x gaspar &lt;3</br>  Going on second hand reports preorders are doing well and season 4 should happen easily.    <br>would vali top or bottom?</br>  <br>bottom</br>    <br> Tfw no animated dulio </br>  <br>Hasn't gone on sale yet. Doesn't on on sale till the 24th.</br>  <br>Season 5 in a couple years.</br>  <br>Aye but he asked about viewer numbers. Since I have no idea about that I gave him the info we do have.</br>  Season 5 never ;_;  <br>Doesn't really matter in regards to sales. There were some series who ranked high in that regard, yet they flopped in sales.</br>  <br>I can see how that can happen, but it was the question asked. Also why I went with pre orders in my answer. <br><br>Almost all of us want there to be at least 2 more seasons. And this season answered an old question of mine about ending a season with vol 11 or vol 12. Without spoilering it, events in 11 are easily as important as vol 1.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Viewer count in Japan isn't available, but the BDs are expected to sell at least 5-7.5k, which is a definite success. Consider S4 pretty much guaranteed.</br></br>  <br>Good. Orifice is such a shitty fucking character and I'm tired of faggots in these threads obsessing over her.<br><br>She's Asia tier</br></br></br>  <br> Orifice  <br> shitty <br> Asia tier <br> Orifice <br><br>Here's your reply.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The butt is presented for your kiss.</br>  <br><br>The only reason you faggots like her is because she's autistic as fuck, just like you.</br></br>  <br>Incorrect. As stated in the OP all girls are best DxD.</br>  <br> Cutest loli and most daughter of all DxD <br> No fucks given attitude <br>Ophis is best.</br></br></br>  <br> Cutest loli <br><br>I love Ophis, but I have to give that title to Kunou or Le Fay.</br></br></br>  <br>Except that some girls are more best than others</br>  <br>Kunou is a very close second for cutest loli, imo.</br>        <br>who the fuck is gaspar?<br> also Gasper is one of the most straight guys around and already has a girlfriend so thats just silly </br></br>      <br>I hope we get another pic of buff Issei in v20.  Although I want colored Crom Cruach much more <br><br> Tfw you realize the BT version is cut above Kuroka's waist and Ravel's clothing is see-through </br></br></br>  <br> v20's cover </br>  <br>Is that... ASIA?!?</br>  <br>his gf is vali</br>    <br>It's Kuroka.</br>  <br><br>Silly anon. Can't you see the blonde hair? That's Le Fay.</br></br>  <br>I have to wonder if she is allowed to wear panties in that armor? What do you anons think?</br>   2015 <br> No TRPG DxD game based on rating games <br> No DxD fighting game <br> No DxD JRPG <br> No qt Xenovia to lay in the grass and stare at the stars with </br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't look like she's wearing any. I can't tell if Fafnir will be happy or sad.</br>  <br> WTF was Rias thinking when she choose to wore that outfit ? </br>  <br>She's being selfish thinking of seducing Issei when the guy is busy being tutored by Ravel.<br><br>Or she's just that confident in her body.</br></br></br>  <br>If Kuroka can be naked and Issei has no nosebleed then it's alright to her.<br/></br>  <br>Nothing like that. She just wore that because she can.<br><br>All the females, including Griselda, are wearing swimsuits and are lounging around the underground pool after their meeting with the DxD group.</br></br></br>  <br>Another question is how effective will Asia be in battle armor? Her strength for her healing is her kind nature, but that seems like a detriment in a direct fight. Maybe she'll take a cue from Issei and Ddraig and let Fafnir be in control of the fighting?</br>  <br>I thought Griselda was wearing her habit? She didn't expect to be swimming right? Along with Dulio and Tobio.</br>  <br>She has Gate of Pansu.</br>  <br>It'll probably be something to up her defense and evasion at the same time so she won't need to be looked after by everyone on the battlefield.</br>  <br>If you got it, flaunt it.</br>  <br>Nah. Bikini. <br>The pool scene is close to the current translation. With the rate the translator is going, most likely after the next update.<br><br><br>Unlimited Breast Works &gt; Gate of Pantsu</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you still on the internet CG ISE, didn't you make a wish to date every single female heroic spirits in the Throne?</br>  <br>Which volume are we talking about? Because I'm thinking the side story one. I still don't think the nun wore a bikini to a swimming party she didn't expect. Heck Kuroka and Le Fay are there and they're not wearing bikinis either.</br>  <br>Faker.</br>  <br>Oh. I was talking about the pool scene in v19. Tobio and Dulio are there too.<br><br>The anon that I replied to has an illustration of Rias and Ravel from v19.</br></br></br>    <br> Tobio and Dulio are there too <br>What were they doing there?</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit Akeno is so hot. Best DxD</br>  <br>They had a meeting with Issei and Rias showing new techniques.<br><br>The people present are the people living in the Gremory group, Dulio, Griselda, Tobio, Vali Team (except Fenrir and Gogmagog)</br></br></br>  <br>Not so hard to guess as they are both part of the greater DxD anti terrorist team and the Hyuodo residence is a major HQ for them.</br>  <br>I see. Thanks.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention, an anon was saying there was the oiling sessions by Issei that the girls were fighting over for who would be first in line. Then Ravel makes a schedule since she wanted to be oiled by Issei as well. Ross apparently nabs one of the first slots by the way.</br>  <br>Seriously? Less than a week after BorN ending for all the "I want to marry Rias" and "Akeno a shit" to just vanish? Are people allowed to like Akeno now without sperg rage?</br>  <br>Source my ass</br>  <br>Assiagamesh</br>  <br>How are Issei's family paying the property taxes on that thing?</br>  <br>Not quite what happened.<br><br> Issei is putting oil/lotion or whatever you call it on both Rias and Akeno <br> Rias said they should continue on the bathroom <br> Akeno said they'd continue on the bedroom <br> Irina and Rose quipped that they too want to be put on some oil by Issei. <br><br>Then, Ravel interjected saying that Issei is a busy person and there is no time for him to put oil on multiple people.<br><br>Rias suggested that she should join as well. After hearing that, Ravel modified Issei's schedule to put in the oiling session with the girls.<br><br>After that, the remaining girls also showed interest and want to be scheduled as well.<br><br><br>v20 is supposed to be Vali's. Ishibumi changed it because there are lots of important things in v20 and it is just proper for the MC to have it. v21 will be Vali's.<br><br>All is from Ishibumi's twitter and blog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't, Rias paid for them, she could give them a mountain if they wanted.</br>  <br>Well since the cover story is that it's a model home for the Gremory, I think it's safe to assume the Gremory handle those small details. Pretty sure they can afford it.</br>  <br>With Rias integrated to the family I think the Hyoudou's problems won't include money<br> Hey Hyoudou-san, heard your family was rolling in cash now. What happened? <br> Nothing much. My son fucked his rich girl and now she's engaged to him. <br> So it's one of those Chinese family marriages? I'm sorry for your son. <br> Not really. More like there's too many marriages about to happen... </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Issei is filthy rich himself now, so he can probably pay it him self as well.</br>  <br>True, but his parents don't know that.</br>  <br> Paying taxes <br>Imagine the damn electricity and water expenditures, it's like running an hotel<br><br><br>I hope so, going around punching people kinda ruins her character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and also Grayfia won't let him go hog wild anyway.</br>  <br> it's like running an hotel <br>Ravel be looking at the ledger of the house<br> Why do we need 50 boxes of condoms? </br></br></br>  <br>Ravel of all people should know why they do.</br>  <br>Kuroka!</br>  <br><br>Wait if DxD Ex is canon then why would they need condom?</br></br>  <br>she goes through 50 boxes per day</br>  <br>Gasper doesn't want kids yet and right now his girlfriend can't say no.</br>  <br>gasper doesnt need condoms if hes fucking men</br>  <br>He has a GF as shown here. </br>  <br>pretty sure he's her gbf</br>  <br>Does Valerie even see Gasper that way?</br>  <br> link on the box <br>Does it work?</br></br>  <br>Nope. Wait 10 more volumes and Val'll be in the harem while Gaspie cheers her on.</br>  <br>I'm still mad Issei's dragon swag took Sona out from Saji.</br>  <br>That dragon aura is weapon of mass destruction.</br>  <br>Nah, don't think Sona sees Issei that way.<br><br>I almost want Serafall to go with Issei and Sona with Saji just so the bros can be bro-in-laws.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Not happening, already too many girls in the harem as is. And if you add more girls, things will become too much of a clusterfuck, then people will bitch and moan that their preferred girl is being shafted. Also the additions will feel forced among others, especially since Sona said she only wants someone that is smarter than her, and that Gasper owes so much to Valerie regarding their past, just wouldn't make sense.</br></br>  <br>No worry, Saji had unlocked armor in vol 17 so dragon swag is coming for him.</br>  <br>Really? I'm seeing signs pointing to Sona wanting to be with Issei.<br><br><br>I know it doesn't make sense but when has Issei made sense with all that he's done?<br> only wants someone that is smarter than her <br>I can totally see Issei getting smarter for the high class devil rank test and exceeding expectations by a mile.<br><br><br>Sure hope so, the dude's been busting ass for her. I hope Ishibumi lets the guy notice Hanakai and Ruruko. Maybe get a few ideas from Issei and form his own harem as well?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Not really, the whole concept is coming from people who are looking to much into those little moments when they really have nothing romantic implied. And you know those Saji/Sona moments that happened in BorN? I guarantee Ishibumi had something to do with those being shown since he helped with the changes.<br><br> I can totally see Issei getting smarter for the high class devil rank test and exceeding expectations by a mile. <br><br>Yeah, really doubt that happens. If Rias can't match Sona in that area, do you really think Issei has any chance of accomplishing that, no matter how much time passes? Would really be forced in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the opposite<br><br>The reason for adding more girls into the harem is simple to understand since this is a cockblocking series and issei's done fucking everything other than sex with his core harem. This severely limits how much more development can be made.<br><br>If ishibumi only focuses on the pre-existing harem, people are going to whine about the plot getting repetitive real quick since there's only so many times you can read about asia getting kidnapped or akeno having daddy issues and it makes the roadblock at sex much more visible.<br><br>Adding more harem members is just an illusion to keep the series fresh since, say, if a MILF gets added in vol 22 or something, everyone's going to be talking and speculating again.<br><br>That said, there's still a lot of harem girls without much development like Le Fay who got introduced a dozen volumes ago and we know nothing about.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's that, the novel is something else. Off the top of my head Sona calls Issei by his first name and has only shown him besides her family her body in a swimsuit. This could always be nothing but I can't help but doubt.<br> Would really be forced in that regard. <br> Boost! <br> Transfer! <br> Issei's brain gets smarter as a result <br>I'm still worried.<br><br><br>I think there's something as too much. The sweet spot of a harem for me is 6-10 girls. Anything else is too much unless it's for gag purposes like Touma's clone following.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The plot's already repetitive and people keep lapping it up so I don't see why it should be a concern. Hell, Japan was split between loving or being neutral on the anime original shit from BorN so it's not like it matters. They clearly have no standards.</br>  <br>That's not saying much seeing as we watch the same shit they do.<br><br>Or do you want them to stop producing just because of one shitty season? I certainly don't want it to end unlike Index. A shitty series is always better than no series.</br></br></br>  <br> Or do you want them to stop producing just because of one shitty season? <br><br>Yes. They've shown themselves to be completely inept in handling it.</br></br></br>  <br>The negative of your statement is that the plot will take a back seat if you add more girls, also the current Arc is already reaching the climax involving Trihexia and Great Red. Not to mention Ishibumi is testing the waters to see how a potential sequel will fare in the EX story line, which means we may be getting close to the ending of DxD. The Asia getting kidnapped and the Akeno daddy issues are already over and done with. Especially since Asia is getting that power up in Vol.20 and Ishibumi said that future volumes will focus on the main four as well as Kuroka and Le Fay. There's already 9 girls in the harem(Kunou is a regional wife) focus on them, really make them standout in regards to how other harems handle their girls.</br>  <br> completely inept <br>Oh a troll. Okay then.</br></br>  <br> I don't like your opinion so you're a troll <br><br>Half of S2 was shoddy.<br>S3 was shit.<br><br>Crawl out of your hugbox mentality, you autistic little bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If I had your negative mentality we'd be out of anime to watch already. That's how negative I am on the animation department. I keep complaining about it yet I don't want it to end.<br> Crawl out of your hugbox mentality, you autistic little bitch. <br>You should be grateful someone's answering you on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>We're getting another "waah save Asia" thing in Ex so I don't know that being finished.</br>  <br> yet <br>*but</br></br>  <br>Seems like a good time to debut this.<br><br>If you don't like it why would you be in a DxD thread?<br><br>On 4chan the answer is troll.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the franchise.<br>I do not like Season 3 or how it was handled.<br>Find the stick firmly lodged up your own asshole.<br>And either remove it or shove it up even further and hopefully impale your brain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People are saying that EX takes place after BorN or Vol.7 at the time. So before Vol.9, which is why only a couple of Issei's kids he has with the girls are present. I'm not so sure if that's the case however, but we will see on the 24th. And saving Asia is more of a secondary objective to the main, which is stopping the event which causes the future war from happening.</br>  <br>Ok I can deal with a well articulated opinion. I withdraw my claim of troll. That said I disagree with you but we can handle that.</br>  Who is collecting all short stories, PDFs and epubs in preparation for the death of the LN in two days?  <br>Did it a month ago.</br>  <br>Fuck, I waited too long and now I'm freaking out because the epub generator is down.<br>Care to share the spoils?</br></br>  <br><br> Vali won't touch her </br></br>  <br>Konozama.co is Japan's Amazon, or something like that.</br>  <br>Shut up white boy.<br>I hope you get fired when you ever get a job because you messed up scanning the papers.</br></br>  <br> epub generator is down </br>  <br>Vali's team is currently a sausage fest.<br><br>Just as planned.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean this?<br><br>http://ln.m-chan.org/v3/<br><br>Alright, let me see what I can do.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy shit, these arguments are a waste of your time. Objectively, Season 3 was bad. However, why can't someone give criticisms of a series they don't like? Why can't that person bring up negative criticisms in a thread relevant to the series? Trivial kids, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one was disagreeing with you saying S3 was bad. They're disagreeing because you said TNK shouldn't produce anymore with their work on S3.<br><br>That's more immature than repeatedly telling you "it's just one season, it'll get better, they've learned their lesson."</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, what? This is my first comment on their little autism-fest. I am just barging into the conversation. I am just defending an /a/non.</br>  I believe we are also getting this..<br>https://lnresource.wordpress.com/</br>  <br>A person CAN give a criticism, but a poorly worded on may backfire.</br>  <br>What is this? Homoeroticism for ants?</br>  <br>Whoops. Missed that! Thank you kind anon!</br>  I wonder if any of the next Sitri rating game will be shown next season?  <br>If they want to get the Rias-Sairaorg fight, then they should.<br><br>From a round robin format, it changed to single elimination and Sona and Seekvaira were seeded.</br></br></br>  <br>I just feel that Sona's development got slighted by the S3 changes,</br>  <br>Sitri rating game then Kyoto.<br><br>I still think TNK should try a 2 cour season.</br></br></br>  <br> I still think TNK should try a 2 cour season. <br><br>That's the thing, being a lower tier studio means their are limited on what they can do. A 2 cour is too much for the studio to handle, also they more than likely don't have the money to back it up.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if alternating between the Sitri and Gremory games could work instead? I mean they ARE supposed to be taking place at the same time.<br><br>I kinda like this idea actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Would only work if they stop the Sitri game stuff around the time Issei nearly OHKO's Kuisha.</br>  <br>Not necessarily, After all who knows WHAT kind of emotional wringer Saji went through in that game? Done right it could actually ADD to the series.</br>  <br>What volume's the pic?</br>  <br>Vol.5</br>  <br>Licensed for what? English translations?</br>  <br>Yep, people are speculating that Yen Press will make the announcement that they have licensed the light novel during Anime Expo. It makes sense since they licensed the manga already.</br>  <br>Light novel akeno &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; anime akeno</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>They just put no time into her character in the anime</br>  <br>they were just like<br>lets balance everything instead of improving what people like the show for</br></br>  Harem anime = otaku NERD  <br>They didn't even balance it. Honestly I started the light novel as a joke and it ended up being really really interesting. The anime is stupid but thats why I like it. Besides The third season which just butchers the source material for no reason.</br>  <br>These are the cons of TNK. Can't produce a two cour or 15 episode season, and since they wanted season 4 to adapt Vol.9&amp;10 and season 5 to adapt Vol.11&amp;12, they had to this this. But changing the story line didn't make any sense. They could've added the Rias/Issei dynamic albeit in a different way, and introduced Loki earlier as well but instead of sealing him at the banquet, have him retreat for the showdown at the end of the season.</br>  Chapter 3-2 of -SLASHDOG- has been translated.      <br>Irina's tits aren't that big plus she's not a rook.</br>  <br>They are that big</br>  <br>What's your point?</br>  Anyone getting the figure(s)?    <br>The rook part is a quirk of the card line. All characters are assigned chess pieces, even if they clearly don't apply. Heck sometimes they slip up and use different pieces for the same character.</br>  <br>I still think Irina's tits aren't that big.</br>    <br>The recent cards certainly have the tits of the girls drawn much bigger.</br>  <br>And you absolutely have the right to that opinion, but your argument is with the artist and not with me anon.</br>  <br>personally I like em that way.</br>  <br>Post more Irina, I need some motivation to continue reading DxD and the last time I read it, it's still Irina volume ch 1</br>    <br>I don't even watch this but that art looks gorgeous.</br>    <br>Asia got ripped?</br>  <br>I think since shes leaning forward, her stomach is making that appearance.</br>  <br><br>fat.</br></br>  <br>cat</br>  <br>tats.</br>  Requestijg Raynere or her alter ego pictures.  <br>Requesting* my bad.</br>  <br><br><br>http://hsddmobage.blog.fc2.com/blog<wbr>-category-38.html</wbr></br></br></br>  Random ract : Rias's father has a harem of his own as well but is being managed by venelara(Rias's mother)  <br>fact*</br>  <br>Link?</br>  <br>That is true Scooby- anon. (Sorry couldn't help myself.)</br>  <br>That's on v10.</br>  <br>I believe it's in vol 10, so in anime terms next season.</br>  <br>So in Issei's case will Ravel still be his manager?</br>  Ishibumi updated his blog.<br> There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br> You can continue reading the main Volumes even without knowing what is on EX. <br> Unfortunately, there will be no new short stories for 6 months. The September issue and EX will be the last, for now. <br> Slashdog will resume by the end of the year. <br><br><br><br>No. Rias is.<br><br>Ravel is just Issei's manager regarding the business stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really need to fuckin reread this shit before it gets taken down.</br></br>  <br> &gt;There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br><br>I  nailed it.</br></br></br>  <br>So YP will really take this down. I thought it's only a speculation since they will announce their next line up.</br>  <br>Only speculation. A speculation that always rises when an something concerning A.) DxD or B.) an event related to anime comes up.</br>  <br>Actually he *did* have a harem. But Venerana broke it up and drove away all the other girls long ago. It is stated that demons in the Gremory line are known to have a particularly strong love and this can translate to being promiscuous. Though neither Rias, nor Zirsechs have ever appeared to me that way and little Mr DragonEdge outright condems that sort of behavior.</br>  <br>Just how fine are these Gremory ladies that the husbands don't complain about it? <br>Do they all have some special demonic bed techniques that make them obey their every command?</br></br>  <br>Venerana is a Baal and she's quite domineering. Rias on the other hand isn't, so doing something like that is out of the question for her. Not only is she friends with the majority of the haremettes, but they frequently try to and some times succeed in stealing a march on her. Even Irina who isn't a devil and gets minimal screen time manages to get ahead.</br>  <br>Speaking of Baal, are there any women gunning for Sairaorg besides his queen?</br>  <br> besides his queen? <br>When did Kuisha show interest in the muscle dick?</br></br>  <br> She’s a woman with strong resolution. That person, she must have feelings for Sairaorg….. <br>Volume 10</br></br>  <br>This looks more like Tail Yellow's armor, actually</br>   Issei's parents will die this volume   <br>Absolutely, this tweet claims that V20 is best read alone and that you're definitely going to cry.<br><br>https://twitter.com/hatano_j/status<wbr>/616900549435265024</wbr></br></br></br>    <br> DxD becomes the GoT of anime </br>  <br>Fuck.</br>  <br> moonrune <br>I'm not 11th anon, translation please?</br></br>  <br>Blah blah promo shit.<br><br>"I recommend that you read it alone. Do not read in the train because you're going to cry! Love overflows!"</br></br></br>  <br>this will probably end up meaning issei and the gang will just move to the underworld as soon as they are done with school.<br><br><br>Still they better get some nice send off, they fucking deserve it for being some of the best parents in history.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't but help but think that it's a throwback to vol 4, when Vali threatened to kill Issei's parents to give him the motivation and strength to fight him on more even terms.</br>  <br> "I recommend that you read it alone. Do not read in the train because you're going to cry! Love overflows!" <br>Doubt that, he's going to troll us again, and reading on the train? Seriously Ishibumi?</br></br>  <br> Vali threatens to do it <br> Rizevim actually does it <br>Well played, Ishibumi.</br></br></br>  <br>The tweet isn't even from Ishbibumi.</br>  <br>The guy is Hatano Jun, an editor and a collaborator for the anime. I think you can say that he's legit.</br>  <br>I know. I said that as it seems like the anon is under the impression that the tweet is from Ishibumi and is self-hyping his work.</br>  <br><br>But they got a grail so unless Rizevim killed them and revived them first I don't see why this could create any drama.</br></br>   all this fear about parents dying <br> forgetting Asia's balance breaker <br> healing doesn't break the balance of nature <br> &gt;but resurrection does </br></br></br>  <br>Do you not understand how that grail works? Every time it's used Valerie loses her sanity more and more, and she's already at the brink. Other people may die and Issei might have to make the tough decision.</br>  <br>Then the old church guy gave her a part of the grail is just to cure her?</br>  <br>That piece was for emergencies, but it still hurts her.</br>  <br>The piece is just to wake her up. The piece itself does nothing.<br><br>Valerie will be doing the resurrection with Sephiroth Graal.</br></br></br>  <br>There's two people she has to wake up. Who does she choose, or does Issei let his parents rest in peace?<br><br>I still think it's Asia's turn to do this. You guys don't listen yet I've been saying this for quite a while now.</br></br></br>  <br>Ishibumi isn't gonna do something as cliche as turning healing into resurrection. Seriously.</br>  <br>And I also can't imagine Asia donning BB armor only to get defense and evasion. Ishibumi already said she can't attack.<br><br>Resurrection is fine if done right. We already experienced it once. Heck, DBZ didn't get worse even after all the wishes they've done for resurrection.</br></br></br>  <br> Asia donning BB armor <br>Balance breaker is not an armor, it can be an armor but is not always one hell its not even usually armor. <br><br>The armor is clearly fafnir just like Azazel used him back during the meeting of the powers so it probably has nothing to do with her healing powers and its just an extension of her dragon afinity .</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you think her BB is then? Because besides her skill at healing which is max I can't think of anything besides resurrection.<br><br>BB are usually an increase of power or a gamebreaking skill. Resurrection for healing makes sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Cao Cao's BB had no relation to the passive ability of the True Longinus, so not always. Ishibumi is clever at making up ideas for powerups.</br>  <br>No idea, i was pointing out that the armor has nothing at all to do with her sacred gear.<br><br>Balance Breaker is actually a "fuck everything" kind of thing, so its not always a plain powerup of the basic powers, specially with issei around who is known to influence the abnormal growth of power in his allies.</br></br></br>  <br> I'll protect it, i'll definitely protect it. ―― Asia Argento <br><br> Ise-san! <br> I will fight as well! <br> Erotic <br> For Asia to fight as vanguard....I won't allow such a thing! <br> I mean it's Asia...! <br><br>Yeap. It's resurrection.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> badass armor gets reduced to bikini armor </br>  <br> Asia's jewels are red instead of purple </br>  I would x her DDs so hard.  <br>Looks like cards received more budget than anime.</br>  <br>I totally would 24/7.</br>  <br>It doesnt really have to mean anything ,It could be Miyama fucking up again, or they were purple because of Azazel or that because this is probably a new contract with fafnir the armor is not the same as it was with down fall dragon.<br><br>The DFD armor design is probably my favorite out of the scale mail armors in the series so seing it turned into bikini armor is kinda heart breaking, lets hope that at least this means Asia starts being more than just a walking first aid kit with a bullseye painted on her back... also lets hope it bring more crazy Fafnir shenanigans .<br> Asia starts wearing it and then cant take it off , ask fafnir how to take it off and he sais she HAS to get hot a sweaty for the armor to come off </br></br></br></br>    <br> best read alone <br> you're definitely going to cry <br><br>I... I don't even think they said that for v11/12 ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeap. It's resurrection. <br> There will be no such thing as Asia hitting her opponents. Her abilities will always be friendly. <br> taking the "I will fight" line literally <br>Keep drinking that delusional kool aid brother.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Must be like Tsubaki or Dulio's anti battle will again.</br>  Well one thing that could really push Asia into BB would be Issei's parents dying. She is an orphan and they just up and took her in and did ALL the parental stuff she fantasized about for her, They really went above and beyond.   Rizevim can stop the effects of Sacred Gears <br> Asia's BB <br> Holy Grail is a Sacred Gear <br>If he kills Issei's parents, can't he just do something to make them immune to Sacred Gears?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends how his ability works. We know pretty much nothing about its origins or whether it can be transferred.</br>  thetimehascomeandsohaveI.jpg      <br>Then that means only 10 western Asia fans will cry. West don't like Asia.</br>  <br>Issei's parents dying is sad in and of itself, no matter how much it affects Asia. West won't like seeing all the other girls in tears.<br><br> I'm actually happy this is looking less and less like a fake death </br></br></br>  <br>am i the only person that don't get it with all these hair styles of the girls from dxd?</br>  <br>If you don't get it, then you have nothing to worry about anon.</br>  <br>i wanna get it, i'm that curious, source for it mate would appreciate it</br>  <br><br>Have you ever played the flash game Super Deep Throat? The hair models are to make the girl look like DxD characters.</br></br>  <br>You're missing out.  https://d.maxfile.ro/indvpskhup.png<wbr></wbr> </br>  So was s3 any good? stopped watching it on episode 4.  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/indvpskhup.pn<wbr>g</wbr> <br>ok link please i wanna play :D</br></br>  <br>It was decent aside from animation through episode 9. Then everything went to shit in the final 3 episodes. You can just watch 1-9 and call it a season.</br>  <br>With the way you type? No.</br>  Friendly reminder that DxD might get licensed in 48 hours. Just gotta get the short stories and v18 PDF (plus the epubs if generator is back up).  Not like the translation will get taken down or anything     <br>So what actually happens if it gets licensed? And why would they nuke fan translations without any product to sell? Walk me through this please.</br>  <br> So what actually happens if it gets licensed? <br><br>In most situations, translator-kun drops the series for fear of legal action. zxzxzx said he'd continue translating as long as there's no significant threat of that.<br><br> And why would they nuke fan translations without any product to sell? <br><br>DMCAs start rolling out as soon as the translation does, and Baka-Tsuki takes down their translation very quickly after it's announced to be licensed (to avoid getting into that legal mess).<br><br>Basically, what'll happen is that translations will continue, but BT won't host them anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Depends on the fan translators themselves. They might just do it still, such as with Danmachi and SAO, but host it on another site. If/when DxD gets licensed, Baka-tsuki will nuke it right off their site immediately. As I said, it's completely up to the fan translators if they will continue, as it's technically illegal to do it once it's licensed because Yen Press is a nazi with their shit. Just to be safe, download the pdf's/epub's because you'll have a rougher time finding them once it's licensed.</br>  <br><br>Thank you for your kind explanations anon.

The guy currently translating this is so stupid that he hosts them on his own website, so tracking him down putting him under pressure will be piss easy.</br>  <br>Like? I LOVE them</br>  <br> Hi <br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>67282&amp;showfiles=1<br><br><br>Bleh, he can host it on my site then.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Please get in contact with zxzxzx then. Also try to convince him to take on another name, for safety reasons.</br>  <br>Yeah, I'm on it. But what good would changing names do? Wouldn't he still be "wanted" under whatever new name he chooses to go by?</br>  <br>Remove any association with previous personas, declare that he has abandoned the project publicly and thus erase his trail. I've done this before.</br>  <br>Is YP really this bad?</br>  <br>Honestly, I was thinking more along the lines of continuing translations like SAO does. Remove the earlier volumes as YP publishes them, keep a PDF set in the back, and continue translating the later volumes publicly.</br>  <br>Yes, they killed the danmachi blog and any attempt to restart the Haruhi translation also gets viciously persecuted. Mahouka has gone under ground and luckily Spice and Wolf was almost finished when they picked it up.</br>  <br>YES. Please take our word for it.</br>  <br>What fucking cunts. Somehow they don't get the idea that people wouldn't care as much if they were faster, but instead they're slow as fuck and license shit that people actually like.</br>  <br>There's no problem with that, just make it so that the trail on the previous translation goes cold and a "new translator" picks it up. Gotta cover your ass, anon.</br>  Is this for anime or LN? Do you have an app for reading LN like mcomix.    <br>The app is known as a "browser" and it can be had here...<br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=High_School_DxD</wbr></br></br>  <br>Pretty typical of copywrong mentality I'm afraid.

Now I'll just wait for his response, but we most likely won't need to worry about DxD getting dropped.  I'd make a topic in /a/ in case other translators want to host their translations there, but I've seen a somewhat mixed/negative reception to LN threads here </br>  <br>Can you maths?</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>Good riddance.</br>  <br>Keep in mind that volume 20 comes out a week before the first volume goes on sale. So expect a boost to the pre-orders of the anime.</br>  <br>It's fine. I've got ties to a group myself and I'd like us host our work on your site. But I'll have to talk to the members first.</br>  For those that want to grab the LNs (1-17) and 3 side stories plus many other LNs in advance of any license announcement please look here.<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>67282&amp;showfiles=1</wbr></br></br>  No thank you.    I finally watched this movie today after putting it off for two years now.<br><br>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT? <br><br> No seriously Bravo Gen BRAVO. I actually rather enjoyed this. Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG!  </br></br></br></br>  Go away  4th movie/2nd season fucking when?  <br>Dear diary today OP was not a faggot for once in his miserable life</br>    <br>But op i cant prove what is completely true. Based op for starting thread about best girl. Give me more homu!</br>  Homuhomu  <br><br>OP Here...I'll post more Homu.</br></br>  Best    <br>Beat girl. Best legs</br>  <br> while(rebellion happened?){ <br> printf("I watched Rebellion\n"); <br> printf("wtf was that\n"); <br> } <br><br>No wonder Homu gone mad in her loop. /a/ also gone mad either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    The fun of Rebellion is that there's a lot to read into, and nearly all of the stuff that doesn't seem to sense or comes out of nowhere actually has an explanation you can assemble.  Rebellion is the End of Evangelion of anime.  Reminder that Homu did literally everything wrong.  <br>You're a sick homusexual.</br>  Rebellion ruined homu a bit for me. While still my favorite, it made her actions seem a bit stupid and out of character. I'm not complaining since it still was entertaining  Homura is worst girl along with Sayaka. Madoka,Mami and Kyoko are best.  <br> liking Mami <br> liking useless characters <br>Ok dude.</br></br></br>  <br>low tier baito</br>  Stop asking stupid questions in the OP and post Homu.  <br>Or just simply my actual opinion? I'm not even saying anything so bad, or at least explain it to me</br>    <br>Also, please remember turning into a witch drives you insane.</br>  <br><br>Great pic. I will never undestand these faggots saying she was out of character in Rebellion.</br></br>  <br>I get it, but my point of view was only that I liked the sweet&amp;sour ending of the anime, and just her remembering madoka. But true, saying it was out of character was wrong of me</br>  <br>It wasn't out of character. Sill, before the movie was out, I was hoping Homura would undergo some character growth and get over her Madoka obsession, at least enough not to go down this path. In hindsight, it was naive to expect something like that from someone like Urobuchi.</br>  <br> spend nearly a decade trying to save someone and getting to know them <br><br>Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic. She felt as attached to her as she would to a family member. She did what she set out to do, protect Madoka and ensure that she can live a safe and happy life. I respect the hell out of her for that.</br></br></br>  <br> Her "getting over" Madoka would be unrealistic <br>That depends on the execution, really. It wouldn't be unrealistic if handled properly.</br></br>  Daily reminder that Homura is preventing you from fucking Madoka.  <br>I find it really funny that almost every day someone finishes watching the movie and posts a thread in a very similar format to this.</br>  <br>Maybe. I'm perfectly fine with how it turned out though.</br>  Hom-Hom  <br>I'm fine with it too, provided they don't ruin it in a sequel. Frankly, now that they drove Homura this far, I'd like things to stay like this, no matter how fucked up the world might be.<br><br>But the movie was a bit of disappointment when I first watched it, to be honest.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just their excuse to start a tripfag/image dump thread.</br>  <br>I like posting images. I just need new ones.</br>  <br>Yeah, I could easily see a sequel fucking things up if not very well.<br><br>Also<br><br> No matter how fucked up the world might be.  <br><br>What makes you say the world is "fucked up?" Aside from some weird aesthetic changes her new universe seems pretty alright.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He said might.</br>  <br>Why don't you just go on Pixiv or Danbooru?</br>  <br>*if not handled very well</br>  <br>Reasons. Don't worry about it.</br>  <br>I worded that wrong. I'm still curious as to what would give him that impression.</br>  <br>Whatever then.<br>What images are you looking to save?</br></br>  <br>Perhaps it's the way Homura handled the megucas, you know, the tea cup, the apple, Sayaka getting clapped, the ending with the half world.<br><br><br>Any really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine.</br>        Damn. I need a PC for webms.    <br>Oh well.</br>  <br>Never fails to have me chuckle.</br>    <br> Rebellionfags </br>          <br>The half moon symbolizes the duality between Homura and Madoka iirc.<br><br>But I think I misunderstood. For some reason I thought you meant the universe itself was physically unstable. How well Homu's universe will turn out is anyones guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes I know, but I think it's fucked because the moon and the world should be whole. That's me though.<br><br> I thought you meant <br><br>I'm not the other person.</br></br></br></br></br>     homu is the best <br><br>I think you mean Sayaka. Homushit ruined everything</br></br>  <br> Homu is still best meguca....prove me wrong faggots....PROVE ME FUCKING WRONG! </br>  <br>Homura's world doesn't follow the same rules as the previous one.</br>    When the melon breaks, it creates a sweet dream.     1. Got my new Homu merch <br> 2. Listened to Kimi no Gin no Niwa <br> 3. Opened /a/(despite not going here for a while) and thinking that "if there is going to be a Homu thread on a top of the frontpage, It will be a miracle <br> mfw there was </br></br></br>  <br>Weird, I just finished doing the exact same thing.<br><br>That scene where they first all transform was frigging beautiful. When you know who's coming last, and how her music sets herself apart.</br></br></br>    <br>No. Homu best girl. You just have shit reading comprehension. Not surprising for a Sayakafag.</br>  <br>In Homu's new world Homu will make sure Mami ends up foreveralone and unable to do a single push up.</br>    <br>Mumi pls.</br>  <br>Her head is going up.</br>  <br>Raped people have no voice.</br>    <br>Ok then i'll say it. <br><br>auuugh! No fighting!</br></br></br>  <br>I liked that doujin where Homu tied Mami up with her own ribbons</br>  <br>I didn't hear anything. <br>What could it possibly mean?</br></br>  <br><br> BULLIED   CHILDREN  detected</br></br>    <br>I was never raped.

I don't really care about Madokami(she came together with Homu), but I suppose I'll keep her  as a pet  and hang her upside down below or opposite Homu<br><br>What sort of frame color would be best?

Also double dubs checked</br>  <br>you're in denial, it was a condom and she was chewing it on the balcony, no doubt after sex</br>  <br>i succedet in having a luced dream with homura once. pic related, thats how sho looked</br>  <br>Why is homu so wide?</br>  <br> suddenly remembering my dream <br><br>F-fuck you!</br></br></br>  <br>This is, no doubt, a message of Fate to me<br><br>I don't know what that means, but for now I decided to spend more time in these threads</br></br></br>  <br>I had lucid dreams with Homu too, but it was a while ago<br><br>I don't remember much now, but I'm pretty sure these were nightmares. <br><br>Anyway, now that I have a Homu pillow(hopefully) more dreams will follow</br></br></br></br></br>  Are the Madoka recap movies good  <br>Also only a sick pervert would look at a freeze pop like if it was a condom. Must be rough since used condom are all you eat.</br>  <br>Some parts were changed, some added, some deleted. Just watch them.</br>  <br> She's been trying to give Madoka a happy life for years <br>At the end of the tv series Madoka seems happy enough with her choices. The idea that she's not, was first introduced in the movie. If they didn't introduce that plot point, instead of making Madoka happy, Homura's journey could have been about learning to accept that Madoka was already happy.<br><br>Portraying character growth properly is never easy. If done well though, it can result in some pretty awesome developments.</br></br></br></br>  Wow you guys are so perverts. Kyouko is just next to me now and she's disgusted.  <br>Sorry, but entire /a/ used to call her "condom-chan" before her character was introduced</br>    <br>They are worth watching</br>  <br>I know.</br>  <br><br>What merch ya get anon?</br></br>  <br>she just sat on my chair and looket at me with that look...i ditnt know what she would do (either she was gonna kill me or have sex with me) so i got so nervous that i woke up...</br>  <br>But letting go of something that was so important to her, would be against Homura's entire character, which was the point of the movie</br>  <br>For a first time view of the series i would say watch the 12 episodes then rebellion. Just to get the full story. Then anytime you want to re watch the show the 3 movies work well</br>  <br>Sorry bro, that's a phantom.</br>   enter thread <br> save all homu's <br> ignore everything else <br> leave </br></br></br>  <br><br>Other then aforementioned posters, I also got myself a clock, some sleeves and a 45x45 pillow with Homu<br><br>Good stuff.</br></br></br></br>    <br> the 3 movies work well <br>That's exactly what I want to do. Don't feel like watching the whole series again</br></br>    <br>She's in my bed. Just next to me, peeping my tablet's screen.</br>  <br>Gohan's a big guy.</br>  Post more lewd meguca.    <br>Hey, I do the same!</br>  <br>Poor you. She is petting my cat as we speak.</br>     &gt;Tulpa people ITT     <br>You speak as if the movie were some fanfic. It's the sequel. If it explicitly says Madoka's unhappy, she's unhappy. Regardless of what it you can infer she may have felt previously in the series.</br>      <br><br>I've got GSC's scale figure (you are not alone version) coming, hope it's worth the $210 I paid.</br></br>    <br>Homura's not a robot programed to do this no matter what. She's doing it because she has put an unreasonable value in Madoka, while lacking self-esteem herself.<br><br>It's not impossible to make her undergo character growth, and it wouldn't go against her entire character if done properly. To begin with, part of the reason Homura's so hung up on Madoka is her lack of self-esteem. A movie or tv series about Homura's character growth would of course need to tackle those issue first.</br></br></br>      <br> You speak as if the movie were some fanfic. It's the sequel. If it explicitly says Madoka's unhappy, she's unhappy. Regardless of what it you can infer she may have felt previously in the series. <br>You missed the point. Of course now that movie is out, whatever it was said there is canon. I was talking about how I would have wanted things to go before the movie was out. How I hoped the movie would have been. That kinda thing.</br></br>  I have a suspicious feeling that the events of the third movie will cause Gretchen to appear.<br>But I can't quite tell why...</br>    <br> petting my cat </br>  Now that's alpha.

He probably crushed them hard.</br>  <br>That feeling when a prison guard has to go take the guy surrounded by ten burly unconscious inmates to solitary, maybe Shun just wanted to be in solitary?</br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me. He's not very good at socializing with others.</br>  <br>"Whats with all these bribes, they won't get my Raidraptors."<br>"Damnit these people are loud, how am I supposed to think about Ruri?"<br>Or it was all a master plan to escape, because in solitary someone has to check on you and open the door.</br></br></br>  <br> Or it was all a master plan to escape, because in solitary someone has to check on you and open the door. <br><br>Sasuga Xyz Reiji.</br></br></br>  Sasuga Neo New Sawatari, taking all of them on at once.

I like the way they look.</br>  <br>D R A G O N S don't automatically make a player good during the format you did actually need to thinking about how you were going to use your resources.</br>  <br>Yeah, but Sawatari is already a super genius in the field of card games, as expected of the undefeated champion of Maiami, he just plays bad decks to give people a chance, and intentionally gets OTK'd to reveal the enemy strategy.</br>  <br> Sawatari jobs repeatedly  <br> He's only pretending to be retarded. </br></br>  <br>Yup, and when he keeps telling people in alternate dimensions that he'll tell his daddy, he's lulling them into a false sense of security.<br>Best at dueling Best at fooling.</br></br>  <br>Pftt.<br>Shun's nowhere near Reiji's league. None of the lancers are yet. Except maybe Dennis with his real deck, but I doubt it.</br></br>  <br>I really want it to turn out that Bennis is REALLY bad at using fusion, and that that's why he's a spy.

Great. I had managed to keep myself away from them until your reply. <br>Fucking spoiler magazines. I have no idea why the Japanese so gladly publish spoilers, or why /a/ so gladly seek them all out.</br></br></br>  <br>Where's Rin's duel disk?</br>  <br>Cravings.<br>And then they read hastily translated synopsises of a few lines and get all the wrong ideas. Like those guys who thought Crow would beat the shit out of Yuya and crush his ideals when they just got into a goofy argument about food.</br></br>  <br> spoilers <br><br>It's called summaries<br><br>For you know, TV guides?</br></br></br></br></br>  Summaries say Yuya doesn't escape. So does he lose to Goyo King?  <br>That was because they assumed that the series would be sucking all over Crow's dick because past series character and all and that he would be able to easily land an epic smack-down on Yuya.</br>  Has Salivo even summoned anything other than Big Star yet? his next seems to be working like a pendulum version of Prophecy with the focus on spells.  <br>She doesn't have one. Remember, they built Yugo's bike together, it's probably the only one they have.</br>  <br>It's only the extended summaries that are riddled with spoilers.</br>  <br>Regular dueldisks seem cheap and commonplace devices, though.</br>  <br> Sharing a duel disk <br> C-Cute. </br></br>  http://www.iflscience.com/technolog<wbr>y/scientists-create-holograms-you-c<wbr>an-touch<br><br>SOON.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  <br> Tag Duels on Motorcycles <br> Rin has to reach around Yugo to place cards <br> Yugo starts blushing and nearly wrecks them <br><br>Too adorable for me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>VR is going to ruin it. We'll just be in VR simulations where we can hook up to other displays and duel in virtual environments, whether it's MTG/YGO/Gunpla/etc. <br><br>It's Kaiba's dream come true.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still wondering how everyone isn't dead by now. It's been proven that you can hurt people and damage real things with no problem using solid vision monsters. All it would take is some asshole summoning something world-ending, like, I dunno, Star Eater or Dyson Sphere or Jurrac Meteor or something and the apocalypse happens.</br>  <br>Probably some type of contingency in place to prevent major damage. Which is why Fusion resorts to turning people into cards afterwards, they can't do any actual damage to the people with the monsters, just buildings and shit, and I think most of the dimensions don't give two craps about ruining their own world, outside of Synchro with the Tops/Slums and that's just more economic than anything.</br>  <br>Hypothetically, if something like Dyson Sphere were ever summoned, it'd probably just be scaled down since there's only so much power you can jam into one duel disk. Like Daibak size instead of their actual size.</br>  KEK<br>You're alright Sawatari.</br>  <br>Wait so for this entire series of duels, couldn't they just realize that they're using styles of summoning and decks that are completely foreign to the City? And does everyone think that hair color and style is completely changeable within 5 minutes or something?</br>  <br>I bet Reira's hair changes color depending on what monsters he summons.</br>   Yuuto could have lived and had another ally if he got Yuugo's name correct in their first meeting   <br>Yuto only existed to praise Yuzu and give Yuya DRXD.</br>  If only Dennis wasn't who he actually was, his facade persona is amazing. <br><br>That's not how Shun would describe him</br></br>  Ruri better have some god-tier character design for them to be stalling her appearance this much  <br>How detailed would you like her card to be?</br>  <br>Super detailed, with an effect, It should make Vennominaga look like god damn speed warrior.</br>   Kurosaki on the D-Wheel <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  Yuto~<br>Shun~</br>    <br>Manga when?</br>  Aw man, seeing Crow again makes me want to see Yusei again so badly. Probably not a good idea storywise but still  <br>don't trigger that one autist</br>  <br>Shun laid down the second biggest smackdown in Yu-Gi-Oh! history, with Jack beating an army of criminals still at first.</br>  <br>I want Sawatari to lose every duel, until the last 3 episodes where he has to have the final duel with Yuya and wins, passing the EGAO torch.</br>  Bumping with Ruri.  <br>Does Yuzu have no shirt on in that?</br>  I want a Ruri and teach her how to duel properly.  I want a Shun to teach me how to duel properly.  <br>You can get out with forbidden chalice + raigeki/dark hole in first hand. Add "cannot be targeted".</br>  <br>Only if you're teaching Yuzu. Serena and Rin would likely punch you or scold you for teaching them.</br>  <br> Talking shit about Rin <br>She's too cute and fluffy to be able to hurt someone. Yuzu is just a mean bully that hits people with fans even after they gave them clothing and shelter.</br></br>  Is this a Ruri?  <br>What the fuck is wrong with her arm.</br>  <br>I'm sorry for your condition Yuugo. But don't worry, I'm sure you'll be with your Ms. Rin soon.</br>  <br>What else would you expect from Batman?</br>  i finally caught up in the series so i can shitpost here<br>why is  sora  best</br>  <br>Because you have bad opinions, Fusion scum</br>  I hope the next opening is sing by  Yuzu's VA.   <br>Fuck no, I hated the ED by her and Masumi that blasted out without warning just when shit was getting good. You see Gon doing cool shit and then suddenly IMA MUNA ODORE YUME CATCH</br>  <br>g e t f u c k e d x y z s c u m</br>  <br>Cute and makes the best faces.</br>  who is the best yuzu and why is it rin  <br>YUZU<br>YUZU<br>YAMERO</br></br></br>  <br>The Yuzu cosplayer isn't actually Yuzu's VA.

I can only imagine how ridiculous Nekroz is, jesus christ, they have a full field of monsters with 2-3k attack by like turn fucking 2-3.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because he's the real love interest</br>  <br>There is no best Yuzu at this point</br>  <br>Fusion Ruris are the best Ruris.</br>  <br>Serena is the best Yuzu, the best Rin, the best Ruri, and the best girl.</br>  <br>I thought the first ED were Yuzu and Masumi and then Yuya and Reji wanting to be the perfect in the next.</br>  <br>Yuzu is the best Yuzu. Fight me.</br>  <br> Implying it's not the same case with Arc of smile <br>A "cheerful" opening doesn't hurt too much, but next ED should be more dramatic or something.</br></br>  <br>The Yuzu is just a cosplayer, not her actual VA.</br>  <br>nah<br>they have 1 that isn't even that good but it's summoned by tributing a monster that prevents you from special summoning as long as they control that ritual monster<br> new banlist is coming out soon so no need to worry <br><br><br>i wanna cuddle with him</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>Well I got my ass rinsed by AI Qlis just trying to remember how to play, which is probably some of my problem, but still, was not expecting that.</br>   new banlist is coming out soon so no need to worry <br>Not if I have anything to say about it.</br>  <br> no fun allowed <br><br><br>the AI fucking sucks too<br> i got back into it recently too, don't worry<br>it's easy to learn shit and get back into the game</br> </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope so, been trying out a few random decks that seemed cool just to see how they were. I think I'll try Raid Raptors next, hopefully I wont let Shun down.</br>  <br>How steeled is your resolve?</br>   Shivers retardation still makes its way in across dimensions <br>I hate everything</br>  <br>Very, I'm determined to make rule over this children's card game.</br>  <br> Chronos is getting SHIBERU from the Lancers <br> they remind him of Judai <br><br> I loathe Shiberu with my every being </br></br></br></br>  where's the best place to watch the anime  Alright I'm finally at Episode 62.

All she's doing is staying in a strange house in the slums with a boy who rides a motorcycle and runs from the police while she wears his ex-gfs short shorts and takes showers around him.<br><br>I mean, it's just a phase Yuya, I'm sure she'll grow out of it, she's being taken good care of though.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, he's sort of right, having the banlist last a specific limited amount of time isn't a good idea.<br>It's best to gradually make changes when needed without being hindered by a calendar</br></br>  <br>That's because you're turning gay. Just accept it.</br>  <br>It got a little silly this episode with the whole willing to abandon his other friends for her and having hallucinations about her.</br>  <br>All he needs to realize is just how stupid Yuugo is, and I think he'll stop being mad. <br><br> turning <br>Yuya had me go bi from episode 1, Shun was the icing on the cake. Serena and the other Ruris are perfect counterbalances though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You wanted Sora dead now you like him? kek</br>  Best YTAS episodes go<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OSq<wbr>kRU8V2iA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I'm not stupid, I'm Yugo</br>  <br>I think you're confusing him with me, I'm about to finish catching up right now.

He's gonna end up doing something great and get fucked over for it eventually.</br></br></br>  <br> Synchro is the strongest dimension <br>ZETSUBOOOOO</br></br>  It always makes me laugh that there's this one Sawatari fangirl/boy in this thread  <br> one <br>Nice joke.</br></br>  <br>More than 1 person has good taste here you know</br>  <br>What episode was this from?</br>  <br> Sawatari fangirl/boy <br>Sure.</br></br>  Does anyone else think Crow is just as unlikable in here as he was in 5ds?  <br>But he's like Gamera, friend to all children</br>    <br>Doesn't change the fact that I hate his voice, deck, attitude, or design. <br>God I hate Crow.</br></br>  <br> Not BUYING BLACKWINGS </br>  So did anyone else play Duel Accelerator or Duel Evolution?  <br>The less he does and the sooner he goes, the better.</br>  <br>What's wrong with his voice?</br>  So, today's manzai is Yuzu complaining a lot of things about being entered into the Friendship Cup, and how Yugo keeps saying "Don't worry about it!". That's about it.<br><br>But like I said in the last thread, I'm not able to upload screenshots due to shit internet quality. I mean I have screenshots, but it's KeyholeTV since that's the only program that's working with me in this country. My usual stream program requires fast internet connection since they're all in HD.<br><br>Full script translation will come later though as usual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with his voice, attitude, or design?<br><br>I have no idea why you hate his voice when Crow's seiyuu is literally sex. He can be retarded but he's also a nice guy. If you don't like him because of that instance in the previous episode, realize that he's been in jail before, 3 times going by his marks, and he didn't want Yuya or any of his friends to get hurt after they had broke out.<br><br>And the only thing in my opinion stupid about his design is again, the three marks. They are all over the fucking place.<br><br>I think you just hate him because you hopped on the bandwagon in all honesty.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoever they are I hope they are prepared for what's coming to them.</br>  BAHSAHKAH SOUL?  <br><br>Didn't Yami call one of his cards trash or something? I'd like to see Yusei try to do something about that</br></br>  <br>MONSTAH CARDO!</br>  <br>Rin a shit. No reason to like her right now other than 'muh pretty girl'.</br>  <br>It'd be funny if Jack did accel Synchro in front of a huge crowd and they inserted Aporia with a ZESTUBO face in the middle of the background.</br>  <br>That fucking Macbook kills me every time.</br>  <br>Jack doesn't Accel Synchro, he's going to double tune out Vylon Omega.</br>  <br> Accel synchro  <br> Not BURNING SOUL <br>They are both advanced forms of synchro summoning anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> not double accel tuning </br>  <br>Jack's burning soul has been extinguished. Haven't you seen the OP or what?</br>  <br>He's isn't going to preform either he will just spam RED DEMONS DRAGON repeatdly.</br>  <br>He said they were useless and he couldn't use them, not exactly trash cards. Which he couldn't use them, it was just a bad hand.</br>  <br> Implying there's anything in this world that's useless </br>  Today's manzai:<br><br> Yuzu: Am I really going to enter the Friendship Cup!? <br><br> Fusion: That's right! Winning through this tournament and fighting against Jack isn't just a dream anymore!  <br><br> Yuzu: But I don't even know this 'Jack' person! <br><br> Fusion: Don't worry about it! <br><br> Yuzu: I also don't know how to do riding duels! <br><br> Fusion: Don't worry about it! <br><br> Yuzu: But! What if the Security catches us and sends us to the Prison Camps?! <br><br> Fusion: Umm, well....Don't worry about it! <br><br> Yuzu: You should really worry about it, even just a little!! <br><br>Image source from maxut.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Jack makes Yuya cry </br>  <br>Yugo has completely forgotten about Rin.</br>  <br>YUGO JA NE YUUGO DA!</br>  <br>He's killing the fruits off one at a time. First Yuto and now he's about to destroy Yuya's will to live by NTRing him. <br><br>Rin is old and busted, Yuzu is the new honest, they're Yugo together.</br></br></br>  <br>Who wouldn't?</br>  <br>I'm gonna fuck that citrus.</br>  <br>yuuya pls.</br>    How amazing was that first episode?  <br>There's no way I can do it justice.</br>  <br>It was awesome.<br><br>Also, it looks like we've got a brand new sub group, with translations by some people who have previously made a fansite explaining all the mythology shit in the previous two series.<br>http://pastebin.com/5bxrb2A7</br></br></br></br>  NANAWILLSIT/10  <br>Don't force it</br>  It had Bikki butt.  <br> noodles <br>I kind of like this one. I get where you're coming from though, conveying the hype of those first 5 minutes in 2 images is fucking impossible, nevermind the rest of the episode.<br><br> Maybe chop a section out of them as well so they match K2. </br></br></br></br>  So awesome that my haato was going HIBIKE HIBIKE all the time.  <br> We translate everything as literally as possible without it sounding awkward, leaving in honorifics. <br><br>already sounds promising lol</br></br></br>  <br>I-Isn't it supposed to be toned? If I didn't love Hibiki so much I'd call her a fat black 3dpd.</br>  熱いのに相変わらず/10  It's amazing how fast the time goes when watching the episode.  <br>They're the ones producing all that heat.</br>  <br>Look at the website linked to at the bottom of the pastebin as an example of what one of the translators has done previously.<br><br>At the very least, we know we aren't going to get terminology fuckups like what happened with FFF and Nanoha Vivid.</br></br></br>  <br> we might actually get subs this time </br>  <br>replace one of the gaijin with Sabin.</br>  <br><br>Looks like they made her butt bigger in every shot but the transformation sequence took it to Nicki Minaj levels of big.</br></br>  10/10 episode, but a little disappointed that we didn't see much of Biki's belly.  <br>Zoid shared some of his progress in the irc channel and it seems totally unobjectionable. He's halfway through the episode, but he had to stop and take a nap because it's almost 9 am there and obviously he stayed up all night.</br>  Charm Points/10<br>http://a.pomf.cat/jlxbiw.webm</br>  <br>Oh really? Any news on if they are including subs for the insert songs? Normally its not a massive deal, but for Symphogear that would be a real dick move.</br>  <br>Well, can't complain with that. Let the guy get his rest.</br>    <br>I guess she's just a growing girl.</br>  <br>All the gohan is going straight to her ass<br>Perfectly fine with me, big bootied fitgirls are my favourite</br></br>  <br><br><br>It's the angle from the camera panning during the transformation.</br></br></br>  <br>cock cakes</br>  Do we have a webm with sound of the entire superflex?  The new transformation sequence looks a little like controlled relicancer crystals.  <br>It looks a little distorted in that frame, but if you watch the whole sequence it looks fairly tight.</br>  <br> Geez Hibiki, warn us next time will you? </br>  <br>Literally cancer</br>  <br>Here's the whole scene from last thread so towards the end.<br>http://a.pomf.cat/jxxrlk.webm</br></br>  <br><br>It's not even fat.<br>It's just the perfect size.<br>That one particular shot is exaggerated because of the camera angle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They definitely intend to do the lyrics but aren't sure yet whether or not they'll be in the first release. Radiant Force has already been translated so it's almost guaranteed, the other two might come down to how long it takes zoid to translate everything else. Here's hoping.</br>  <br>You mean Fine's hexagonal shields and such from S1?</br>  <br>They should just wait until they have them subbed, no point in doing partial releases when the music is the focal point of Symphogear.<br>But whatever, godspeed to them.</br></br>  did nana sing enka again?<br><br>if not, this new season will be shit like the last one</br></br>  Here's to a great season 3, and an even better season 4 (please?)  <br> Season 4 <br>eh<br><br>a couple of OVAs and a movie would do</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The view, positioning as well as the colour separation makes it seem a bit bigger than it is. But yes, I do prefer the G transformation bikkibutt.</br></br>  <br>Where are the subs?</br>  <br> Symphogear the Movie 1st <br> Symphogear the Movie 2nd G <br>Nana please will this</br></br></br>  More sad backstory incoming  I hope this doesn't turn out as bad as Dog Days' 3rd season  <br>If you want Nana singing Enka all the time go back in 1994 or something.</br>  <br>This 1st episode a million times better than Dog Days".</br>  <br>Please wait warmly.</br>  <br>Anon you're confused, we're talking about Hibiki here, we all already know that Shirabe has the perfect size.</br>  <br><br>Screw you, I want 12 seasons of Biki butt and no less.</br></br>  Would anons rather Zenbu's Zenbus or Bikki's Charm point?  <br>Not even one season for Bikki belly?</br>  Why does it look a bit like White Base?  <br>I have a determination to fist Bikki's charm point.</br>  <br><br>that's a spin-off with it's own continuity</br></br>  <br>who is this creampie yokai?</br>  <br>Bikki's  abs. </br>    <br><br>If you’re not going to upload it on 4chan, might as well make it VP9. Smaller, better. <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/ynftydedrt.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>  I hope Hibiki really loses it this season  <br><br>I'll only accept this if the final episode is just Miku and Biki getting all hot and frisky with each other's navels. I'm talking things that would actually justify the censorship.</br></br>  <br>Ok this is bullshit. If they are going full hard gay with these two I better get at least one Hibimiku scene.</br>  <br>My face after watching this.</br>  <br>Kirika was very 熱い if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>maxfile.ro has botnet though</br>  <br>I'd say it's within acceptable parameters.</br>  <br> Does the Shining Gundam Super Mode poses <br>Picked the fuck up</br></br>  How long after G was GX confirmed?  What are they watching, /a/?<br><br> Anime-chan has a Electro-Inspector Ban shirt on </br></br>  <br>He shouldn't force himself to stay up and get burned. People can learn to wait especially since sometimes Commie didn't have the episode out until an hour before the next one.</br>  <br>Shuttle disaster is "shortly after", concert is about 100 days after that.</br>  <br>Is S-Miku not enough for you?</br>  <br>It was green-lit within a couple of weeks if i remember correctly.</br>  <br>The S3 confirmation? It was during the Symphogear Live, so December of 2013.</br>  Hey. Dumping an ongoing scanlation (author of Love Roma). <br><br>This needs an additional editor (600dpi scans). You'd either be helping with the latest chapter that's been translated, or redoing v01 with proper editing and scans at your own pace.<br><br> The story which follows the adventure of Takeo, the most unfortunate girl of the universe. Takeo goes to school and lives alone in an inn called Hyakkisô (the manor of 100 demons). The life of the young Takao will begin to change the day she sees the youkai... </br></br></br></br>      I really like Toyoda's work, it gives me this strange feeling of internal happiness. <br>Plus the moon runes lvl is pretty basic too.</br>      Kumiko and John have never looked this good before.  <br>I will never understand how "degenerate" became an insult on a board of useless people who spend all day jerking to loli.</br>    <br><br> Using a non-Anime image on an Anime imageboard is now a bannable offense <br><br>I've spent eight years on here for this?</br></br></br></br>    Why did this cutie pie get so much screen time?<br><br>Season two!</br></br>  A demon holds a book, in which are written the sins of a particular man; an Angel drops on it from a phial, a tear which the sinner had shed in doing a good action, and his  /ai/ - Idle Activities  are washed out.  <br>You can't really be happy about that.</br>  <br>Any Jewelpet series getting subs is much better than none of them getting subbed.</br>  <br>some new group. [H&amp;D].<br>You could ask the guys in the IRC, but I don't think the people working on JP will be in the channel. The group leader (I think) said they're not in there to avoid Symphogear spoilers.</br></br>  <br>You certain about that?</br>  <br>Didn't even need to check their IRC since it's listed in their Pastebin. Hopefully they do it right.</br></blockquote>]
