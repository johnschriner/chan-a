He even gave it a fucking closure for crying out loud.  <br>I can't, hope is the last thing we lose.</br>  <br> He even gave it a fucking closure </br>  <br> animeonly </br>  <br><br>Talking about the manga as well. I've been reading it and I really wonder why he even begun a new arc when I knew he'll go in a hiatus that will not be over unti he died or something like that.</br></br>  <br>Ging meeting Gon, despite all the plot threads left open, is as much closure as the manga needed. <br>Ending it then&gt;never ending it.</br></br>   you'll never know what happen to Chrollo <br>Fuck off Togashi.</br>  <br>There was no closure in the manga</br>  <br> no more Illumi <br>why even live</br></br>  <br>Why are all Zoldycks so shit? Only Zeno is likeable</br>  <br>Wow, your taste is shit. Every Zoldyck boy is qt, even Silva.</br>  <br>Illumi is the only decent Zoldyck.</br>  <br><br>Shit tier<br> Milluki <br> Killua <br> Alluka <br> Kalluto <br> Kikyo <br><br>Ok tier<br> Silva <br> Illumi <br><br>Good tier<br> Zeno <br><br>Potential tier<br> Zzigg <br> Maha </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think its hard to argue that given everything this is the best place it could have ended.<br><br>But at the same time, I think the biggest problem is that the whole Election Arc is very clearly about setting up the Dark Continent Arc and that just leaves a hole in you.<br><br>Ideally, I think, if he had planned to end it here, we would have gotten a lot less focus on opening up new things the election arc, so that means having no alluka and zodiacs so that things can actually... not just be opened up. Use any other maguffin for Killua to ultimatly have to find, maybe that exorsist guy thats supposed to be helping Chrollo so we can see how that went out, since he might be ale to create a creature to fix Gon. And have the election part not eve really look at the people who are in the zodiacs besides Ging, with his fight with The Leorio bits being the only really important parts to end of his arc, hell, maybe even have him win this time if its ending. Not sure what he could do with Kurapika given the election arc, but something could be changed if he ever intended this to be the end, maybe give him a side plot about what would in this case be the final eye of his people.<br><br>I think really, where he inteds to end it is with some kind of meateor city arc. All the threads that are left open lead back to Meateor City (Gryo, Chrollo, the Phantom troop in general, consequentially Hisoka, probably the eyes, really Meateor City in general, etc.), so I can only imagine thats where things are intended to end, and maybe things like Kurapika and Leorio becoming part of the Zodiacs or things that happen in the Dark Continent are leading up to that. But thats where I think he intends it to end.<br><br>He probably wont though, and we are doomed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alluka has the best personality out of all of them though</br>  <br>It's too early for this shitty of a taste.</br>  What's up with the sudden influx of HxH threads lately?  <br>I imagine its due to many other hiatuses ending that HxH fans are feeling sad</br>  <br>It's how it's been for a long while, they just died off for a week.</br>  <br><br>I think it's because the mangaga of Berserk will start releasing chapters again and they got jealous that their mangaga is still in hiatus.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, but there's been a huge lack of Pitou.<br>Also probably what those anons said about Berserk and D.Gray-man returning and not HxH.

Better to keep everything contained into generals than shitting up the board with multiple threads. That way anyone who doesn't like it can just ignore and hide that one thread.</br>  Why don't we just wait for fucking thursday? It's not that hard  <br>Last thread got 110 unique IP replies. There is a demand.

It's when someone makes a<br> no xxx thread? <br> let's fix that <br>thread in the middle of an otherwise dead week where it becomes a problem. Plus it's the beginning of the season and I'm sure a number of people are picking up the manga who want to talk about it and there are some new chapters so it can't be helped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The threads are pretty tame also, there is quality discussion.<br><br>But let's stop this meta-posting. Either talk about something GG related, or let the thread roll out of page 10 given time.</br></br></br>    Is it just me or is the Mega page being a pile of utter shit for anyone else?  <br>Worked fine for me when I read it<br>Might be your browser, mega's kinda shit</br></br>  <br>Try to download it as zip, the guy didn't compress it for whatever reason.</br>  <br>The angles on some of those can get pretty clever tbh, I think the author is going for a "I'll make it look like its incredibly obvious that she's not real by giving her a bear design and cleverly hiding her on some shots", so in a way he's going for the triple layer, as in, she's real, but then she's not real, but then she's real but not her sister.</br>  <br><br>Seems to be an issue with Chrome.

I'm assuming she's in denial about her sister having turned </br>  <br>There is no loli, just a bear, this much is glaringly obvious.

We've been over this.</br></br>  <br>I'm  but even I have to admit the last two chapters are not conclusive proof, she's missing in some shots and the only one who really talks to Rii is Yuki, who "knows how it's like".</br>  <br>Those are the eyes of a broken person.</br>  <br>    just another random girl <br> they don't give her food <br> they aren't happy that Rii found another living human being <br> she keeps disappearing in various panels <br> her crying didn't wake everyone up <br> her clothes look a lot like Yuki's stuffed bear <br> she never says anything, and when she did say something (i.e. cry), she said ABAJ repeatedly <br> Rii-san's  fucking crazy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My life needs more Yuki</br>  1) The bear is Ruu.<br>2) The bear is Ruu, except Ruu is actually alive at another location, waiting to be relevant to the plot.<br>3) It's not a bear, it's really Ruu.<br>4) It's not a bear, it's a random girl Rii believes to be Ruu.<br>5) There was no Ruu in the first place, Rii just made up a little sister in her mind and is playing house with the bear.<br><br>You can only pick one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is probably it, right? Since she  asks for the girl/bear/whatever's name so it shouldn't be her sister.  I'm also thinking she never had one and she just has an onee-sama personality without a real imouto?</br>  <br>If anyone is going to die from sheer insanity, it's her.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I also forgot<br> she can't climb ladders by herself (she rides her onee-chan's back even though she's old enough to do it by herself) <br> crossbowfag incident <br> Rii's always holding onto her, and when she isn't Yuki is </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll let my dubs pick for me.</br>  <br> several shots without loli <br> loli looks like the bear in several ways <br> the bear was even left there by Yuki <br> Rii was the only one who heard the voices <br> loli doesn't get food when they eat, but an empty plate is placed in front of her <br> when Rii tries feeding loli, Mii and Shovel both have a nervous\skeptical look on their face <br> the only one in any way interacting with the loli is Yuki, who we know is bullshitting on her own already <br> "I SAID ALL OF YOU" shouted by the crossbow boy, with Rii never taking her hands off the loli <br>Face it, my man, that loli is not a loli</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she never actually had an imouto, that just makes her even more crazy, since she'd go so far as to make one up, then lose her shit over something she imagined.</br>  can someone post yuki one ?,and someone other ,(not kurumi ,and miki)  Is there a mega link for the other chapters? Or mediafire, something like that. Haven't found anything other than online manga sites and I'd appreciate it if there was one, my internet makes online reading painful.  <br> not kurumi ,and miki <br> don't post cutest girls <br>Anon please.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with all of those except<br> &gt;loli looks like the bear in several ways <br>because the chapter before bear there's a flashback with imouto in it and she's wearing the same clothes.<br><br>Also it's not like I want her to be real, Rii being delusional is way more interesting plot wise, it just feels like its being presented way too obviously, insultingly so, even.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How crazy is too crazy to stick it in?</br>   Glasses a best new girl   <br>Only one i have.</br>  <br>Rii-san just needs someone to dote on and depend on her to stop from buckling under the trauma. Yuki's broken out of her crazy little kid bit and all the other kids are dead? Nothing a little unhinged imagination won't fix. It's why she asked if Yuki could hear the voice in the classroom, she already knows it's not real but needs it to survive. Yuki's delusion was always holding her together, and now it's gone.<br><br>Kurumi should be affected some too but she has her own timebomb issue and a new cute kouhai to lean on for support.</br></br></br>  I want to fuck everyone in this manga<br>EVERYONE</br>  <br>i mean i already have yuuri and miki ones ,and i want yuki one</br>  <br>Even Taroumaru?</br>  <br>You can find it all in our goddess site</br>  <br>Yuki's isn't a two-page spread, unfortunately.

Miki is God-tier too, though.</br>  <br>That should go without saying. It's the only logical choice aesthetically.</br>  <br><br>She's just a bit cold. Zombies aren't ignoring her.</br></br>  <br>Oh, she's a  bit  cold alright</br>  <br>She's no longer "human" to their senses, they only react when she proactively proves herself to be one to them.</br>  <br> Madokami <br>That's all I'm gonna do for you good sir.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128048312 <br>Are you the gakkou gurashi police?</br>  <br> they only react when she proactively proves herself to be one to them. <br><br>How does that work.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't the zombie reacting to Rii-san though?</br>   Pills here?   <br>One of those is calcium</br>  <br>You might like this then<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51374131</wbr></br></br>  <br>Smell, warmth, sight, whatever they use to identify living humans is already not ticking when meeting her. Only actions a zombie couldn't possibly do (like yelling or moving normally) reveal her to still be alive to them.</br>  <br>I expected dog fucking and got a heart warming image instead. Fuck you OP.</br>  <br><br>That's a good point. It seemed a bit far for a reaction though.</br></br>  <br>I was thinking more like she smells "infected" so they don't bother with her unless she acts like prey would.</br>  <br> Grabbin' pills. </br>  <br>Probably something like that. The zombies obviously know not to attack each other somehow, and Kurumi is triggering that instinct.<br><br>Otherwise they react primarily to light and sound, which is why they were charging into the inferno from the helicopter.</br></br></br>  So it's obvious one of these girls will die, question is which one?  <br> All 3 <br> In the same chapter </br></br>  <br> Middle. Left is too qt to die and glasses is evil mastermind so she can't die. </br>  <br>I'd sooner ask myself which one isn't going to die, if any.</br>  Black hair looks pretty suspicious when the other said they don't get along with the guys.  They're lying, right?<br/>   <br>I think the middle one will snap first.</br>  <br>Middle one first then right and finally left.</br>  <br>Left will live.<br>Middle and Right will reenact the BFF scene from HSotD.</br></br>  <br>The real question is<br><br> Marry/Fuck/Kill </br></br></br>  <br>Marry right, fuck left, kill middle.<br>Easy.</br></br>  <br>I think they used to be one group of survivors but there was a split, most likely because of people getting infected.<br><br><br> Marry left, fuck middle, kill right, how is that even a question? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Marry right, fuck middle, kill left</br>  <br>I would fuck all 3 of them, but definitely marry left</br>  <br>How could you kill Mika?</br>  <br> Marry, fuck, kill, in that order, left to right. </br>  <br>Marry left, fuck right, kill middle.</br>  <br> Thanks a lot, I had only found deel's so I had no idea where the beginning was. </br>  <br>Maybe it's a giant gangbang inside the uni and the three girls escaped, but black is the most traumatized by the forced dickings and is quiet now, but will get her friends killed by flipping out on Crossbow-kun next time.</br>  <br>Link's not working for me for some reason.</br>  I thinking the only good end for this series would be Kurumi looking up from her notebook full of chuuni fantasies of her being an action hero fighting hordes of zombies with a shovel, and having Sakura-sensei scold her about how she was portrayed.  <br> it was all kurumi's chuuni fantasies. <br>After seeing how she saved Rii here, I can see this. No way she would be able to stop a blow from a crossbow like that if all this shit was real.</br></br>  Why does everyone think crossbow was a guy? I bet it was just glasses girl using a cool hat.  <br><br>She's a zombie now. She can go past her human limits like the guy in Zombie desu ka?</br></br>  <br>Freckles.</br>  <br>Marry middle, fuck left, kill right.<br><br>Left gives me the worst feelings, like her entire being is a lie and an act and she's the most evil inside, but she's hot as hell. Right looks like a scheming witch that thinks of you as nothing more than a tool. Middle looks like she might try to use you, but somehow I don't think she's smart enough to do it well without the others.</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies in this series are weak and slow as fuck. It's hard to see how getting zombie'd would make Kurumi faster.</br>  Would anyone mind zipping these up and uploading them to zippyshare or something? Right now MEGA is seriously shitting the bed, no matter what browser I use.  <br>Sure, because everyone who wears glasses is the same person, right? They don't even have the same face or hair. Nor are their expressions the same. Crossbow was panicking and looked untrusting of everything. Glasses girl looked confident and scheming.</br>  <br>Look for the last thread, a gentle anon dumped both chapters.</br>  <br>The bear has been around the whole time, Yuki didn't exactly discover it. It's not hard to believe Rii may have noticed it earlier than the flashback.</br>  <br>Oh, so you say that she already had an image of how her fake sister-bear would look before "rescuing" her? That's interesting as fuck and makes a lot of sense.<br><br> I still stand by my theory tho. </br></br></br>  <br><br>All right bro, see if these work:<br><br>Chapter 36: http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br><br>Chapter 37: http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/gerMN<wbr>YWC/file.html</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're a nice person, Anonymous.

This series hasn't really gone through with the typical Zombie Apocalypse cliche of "seemingly nice group is actually terrifying and horrible" yet and the overall nature of the series makes me feel like it won't...but god DAMN that is one prevalent cliche. They're probably evil, aren't they?<br><br>Also, clever use of "Ruu" by perspective in these chapters.</br></br>  <br>I was hoping it would just be more acceptance like with Mii-kun, but then glasses flashed a scary face.<br>I'm genuinely worried.</br></br>  I wonder what would have happened if Kei wasn't there.  <br>They'd have died?<br><br>Well, in Kei's case, died sooner.  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Why is she so Mexican?</br>  <br>More importantly, this page.<br><br>They say they don't use violence "like those people" but apparently these guys are like "nope, we out".<br><br>I hate this "arc" of zombie apocalypse stories, I was hoping it wouldn't happen here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm talking before they died. Pretty sure Miki was gonna get raped.</br>  <br> that understanding look megane gave the car <br>RUSE CRUISE INCOMING</br></br>  <br>This series is going through a path that may turn it into shit. I'm fearing what's going to be of the story in later chapters.</br>  <br>The path it's on now could also make the manga even better. Don't be so negative all the time.</br>  <br>Yeah, this is about where zombie stories are made or broken. If you get your series caught up in post apolitics, as I call them, you're cruisin' for a bruisin'.<br><br>In the first place, there's very little chance these new characters will accept Rii's delusions and that's going to be troublesome.<br><br>I hope whatever dark secrets these new girls have, they're not too dark.

Perfect Dark came up with nothing and using google I only found dead filesharing links.   Decide to show first episode to my little sister <br> Wait, the school let's them live there? <br> What about there parents? They should just go home. <br>Actually watching it with someone who has no idea what's about to happen is so much more fun then reading about people doing it.</br></br></br>  Reading the manga right now<br>Only 5 chapters in and Christ. This is some heavy shit, doc.</br>  <br>You have no idea. Enjoy the ride!</br>  <br><br>Then work dem muscles, 'cause it's only gonna get heavier.</br></br>   people wary about "evil" humans in a zombie story <br>Zombie stories are all about humans being the real monsters. Let it happen, just hope it's well handled because it's coming and you can't stop it.</br>  <br>Rii-san has the best pajamas, as expected.</br>  <br>I'll be stupidly optimistic and think that she was just smiling because they found living humans and the bully guys stopped chasing. But I know this only means trouble. Either the guys were too scared of dealing with these girls and that was an evil smile, or the guys retreated to regroup and eventually invade.<br>I'll also be stupidly optimistic into believing that the three new characters were introduced all at once because this would be the most realistic scenario once the infection's been around for so long, rather than finding lonely survivors. It also fits the theme of entering university and restarting the club there, with new club members. But then again, I know this only means trouble and that at least one will die.<br><br>Also would like to notice that it was grown up guys chasing away what seemed at first sight as perfectly healthy and friendly girls, when I'm sure they haven't seen alive girls in a while. Either they are really scared of girls for some reason, or author doesn't want to deal with sex at all.<br><br> I hate this "arc" of zombie apocalypse stories, I was hoping it wouldn't happen here. <br>Same here. I understand tyranny, wars and human slavery wouldn't be weird in a lawless world, but it's annoying when zombie series always go "humans are the real monsters!", completely forgetting about the zombies. Just look at how the girls went from barely crossing the barricade looking for provisions to wander around the city looking for new friends.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this thread is just Yuki talking to himself <br><br>also who think the anime is not going to be 1:1 with the manga and will have an original ending?</br></br></br>  <br>Those aren't pajamas.</br>  <br>Duh. This wasn't breaking any records at Kirara and they have the original author on board, plus there are hints like the ending, it's going to have an original ending, but likely one that sort of mirrors how the manga will ultimately end.</br>  <br>They are, females I know wear those short pants sleeveless shirts to sleep.</br>  REMOVE DOG  <br>That's a lot of clothes to wear to sleep. A simple top and panties would be best.</br>  <br>Learn to sleepwear.<br>https://www.pinterest.com/slj2289/p<wbr>jslounging-3/</wbr></br></br>  <br>It's just a top and pants with a light sweater that she put on because it's likely morning and cold.</br>  <br><br> Get ready anon </br></br>  <br>Maybe I should show this to my imouto too just to see her reaction.<br><br>She has good taste so she'll probably like shovel knight</br></br></br>  I got me some hardtack. It tastes like survival!     how the fuck did the guy in the chopper get infected   <br> Covering her with the blanket makes this even scarier/unnerving. </br>  <br> The disease is also airborne. </br>  <br>He was going to save the girls.<br>The plot had to stop him so the suffering could continue.<br> He was actually infected earlier, used the medicine and it wore off. </br></br></br>  Shovel will become the final boss and Yuki will be forced to kill her.  <br>You mean Mii-kun will have to kill her, right?</br>  <br><br>  then shouldn't they all be infected too?  <br><br><br>  that's what I was thinking. I couldn't help but lol when he pulled out the cure and then crushed it  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How long until Kurumi goes nuts and turns into a twintailed, shovel-wielding Wesker expy?</br>  I need to go back and properly read these last few chapters. I initially thought  Ruu was some random, immobile dead girl that Yuuri had picked up . Need to get my head out of the edge.  Come on everybody knows  Rii  is gonna get killed first  <br>That would be delusional, Anon. She's just  bearing  the responsibility of taking care of a normal healthy child.</br>  I think the most obvious "clue" that Ruu isn't real is that she supposedly survived in that school for several weeks (if not months) completely alone. Not to mention that there were loads of zombies in the school and she's like 7 years old.<br><br>Come on.</br></br>  Any good porn yet?  <br> sexualising the gurashis </br>  <br>I'm not a bad person</br>  What if  Ruu kills a zombie? <br> Yuki was able to kill one with a broom, a stuffer animal should enough with how FAT Rii is.  </br>  <br>Just got to chapter 9<br>Every scene with the teacher kills me inside.</br></br>  <br><br> <br>I think they are all infected. The newscaster died locked up in a room all alone. maybe it's slower on younger people..or some bs reason </br> </br></br>  <br><br>didnt mean to quote</br></br>  <br> I think you're retarded. </br>  <br> what if its "of the dead" rules  </br>  <br> not a doujin with Shovel and his zombie senpai. <br>   fendom </br></br>  <br>Another good one would be that Yuki finally gets her first boyfriend at school. <br> It's actually just a zombie and fucks her till she goes even more insane. </br></br>  <br>Not exactly gentle, but he did translate so I can't complain</br>  <br> his <br>Anon pls don't.</br></br>  <br> It seemed like she caught a cold. It didn't look like she got bit. She might have been unsure of what was happening and in the end realized that she must have been turning.  <br> The cold kills you, sasuga Japan. </br></br>  <br><br><br>I think the author is just going with the worst possible outcome for any other people they encounter</br></br></br>  <br>It's true though, Kurumi is manly as fuck.</br>  <br>I just want cute yuri doujins</br>  <br>  rii is gonna fucking snap and die first. Then shovel for feels when mii kills her  </br>  <br>the airborne stuff is speculation presented as fact<br><br>as far as the pilot goes, it is more likely that he got infected but was unable to give himself the cure before it took over</br></br></br>  <br> Do you seriously think anyone in the main four will die? </br>  <br><br>Rii is going to die. There's no curing this insanity.</br></br>  Miki is such a qt.  <br><br><br>Anyone who acts like Rii does in every zombie movie ever dies</br></br></br>  <br>Mii-kun is best boy.</br>  Will we ever know their birthdays?  I think I pinpointed the exact moment where Mii and Shovel found out that Yuki is actually not in lala-land anymore. On this page...<br><br> You've always been a great help <br>Kurumi with this statement shows that she knows that Yuki is changing, and is saying that she was helpful, despite her mental state. <br> R-Really?  <br>Yuki here shows that she wasn't sure of how she "was" while mentally deluded. It's clear she assumed she was a burden, and her insistence to be directly, physically helpful, has shown that she was worried about how much she was helping her friends. <br> Yeah. No Doubt About It.  <br>Miki here also shows that she appreciated Yuki's positivity, even though she was blind to everything around her. <br><br>Continued</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The 3 new girls are going to take over for crazy, shovel and lesbian.  Finally <br><br> Yuki-chan, you're alright now, aren't you?  <br><br>Yuuri is showing that she realizes that Yuki is no longer in that trauma-induced mental state she was in before. By implying that Yuki is "alright", she's aware that Yuki is no longer in an apparent negative place. Yuki never exhibited any form of pain or anguish upon leaving beyond being sad at their graduation, though Yuki promised to be with her friends as long as she could. This wasn't magically changed with a day in the truck. She has to be referring to Yuki's mental state. <br><br>However...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuuri, unwilling to let her big sister elements go, seems to want to believe that Yuki is still buried within her mindset. Yuki wanted to go for a walk outside with a flashlight, and for whatever reason, she chose to go alone. <br><br>We can only infer one of two things: <br><br>a) She is going out, scouting for resources to alleviate some of the work for her already exhausted friends<br><br>b) She simply couldn't sleep due to her friends knowing how she is now, and wanted to just walk the anxiety off<br><br>Yuki attempts to pull the Megu-nee card, but it's clearly not working. Yuuri KNOWS that Yuki isn't seeing Megumi anymore, and as such, she's pressuring Yuki to not go outside and continue exposing herself to danger, much as an elder sister would for a stubborn younger sister. This is probably a tipping point for Yuuri. We all know by now that  she is keeping her mind intact by replacing the horrifying thoughts of her actual little sister with comforting protection of Yuki as if she were a sibling , and this display of Yuki's maturity and insistence to help the others would elevate Yuki from being a helpless  little sister figure  to  an equal to the rest of them, making her no longer a proper surrogate imouto for Yuuri, reminding Yuuri of what is actually missing in her life, which would be her actual imouto. <br><br> Ironically, with one gesture, Yuki is driving Yuuri to insanity by simply showing that she is no longer insane. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder who is best girl.  <br>Yuki is correct. Kurumi and Mii-kun are both best girl</br>  <br>Yuki became pretty great at this point.  But Mii-kun will always be the best. </br>  <br> I don't think she actually has a little sister. She just suddenly "remembered" she had one after all this time. Remembering after Yuki got better is also really convenient. </br>  <br>There was never any doubt in my mind after that chapter.</br>  <br>Miki should know, since she was there when Yuki broke down and also was the first one to consider the idea that she could be pretending.</br>  <br>Link will happen to at least one of them.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hFl<wbr>wczcc9wQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>    <br> I'm distinctly inclined to agree with you. For all the information we've been given, I think Yuuri is falling under a similar psychosis that Yuki was in. However, Yuuri still wants to play the doting big sister. Yuki clearly knows Megu is dead, Kurumi and Miki both clearly know that Yuki is no longer deluded, but if Yuki is capable, in a sound mental state, and can act on her own, Yuuri no longer has that therapeutic big sister role to take on, and as such, she's forced to painfully dip back into reality.  <br><br> I think her "sister" is just an extremely acute projection of her desire to be a protective big sister to something. Anything honestly counts. But with Yuki being awake and, most importantly, capable, Yuuri's role in the group is insignificant-to-meaningless. </br></br></br>  <br> an equal to the rest of them, making her no longer a proper surrogate imouto for Yuuri <br><br>That's what I think happened right here. Like, literally this page. <br><br> Miki wants to drive <br> Yuki wants to drive <br> Yuki is putting herself on the same level of helpfulness and capability as Shovel and Mii <br><br><br>I think Yuuri's just bullshitting about having had a little sister. Not even mental delusion, just plain making shit up. I think that she'd have taken the first little girl they find and claim that was her sister who was driven into amnesia or another traumatic delusion like Yuki. <br><br> Funnily enough, in her search for a real kid, she found a delusion of a kid. As noted by the bear bag that Ruu has, as well as the bear claw pockets on Ruu's top, all topped off by the ear-like puffs on her hair </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Her voice <br>"Nozaki-kun!"</br>  <br>I don't think they clearly know Yuki's normal. At least, not Kurumi. Pic related, she might suspect something's happened but I don't think it's clear cut for either her or Yuuri (Miki's another story)</br>  <br>Would Chiyo survive the zombie apocalypse?</br>  <br>She would thrive in it.</br>  When will they stop wearing their school uniforms? They've graduated, after all.  <br> changing character designs midway <br>that doesn't usually happen no matter the in-universe reasoning</br></br>  <br><br>I got choked up by this scene. <br><br>Something about the combination of her mental state, (which she is somewhat aware of herself, and at this point it's likely beginning to improve somewhat- as Rii's begins to worsen,) and cheerfulness, and the dire situation, and her practical yet adorably child-like preparations, (the bat and the glowstick headgear, 2qt) all really come together to emphasize how brave and selfless she's being here.<br><br>I mean her mind has snapped due to dealing with past trauma, and she at least partially understands this herself, but not only does she suck it up to go look for her friends, she does so with a smile, and even carefully prepares herself to face what she knows will likely be exactly the sort of horrific and dangerous situation she has been unable to deal with or even acknowledge for some time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Manga sales list for the previous week is up.<br>All the data I'm using is from the http://shosekiranking.blog.fc2.com/<wbr> so it's up to you to believe me or not.<br><br>As I've said before, none of the Gakkou Gurashi! ranked on this site aside from the 5th volume which barely managed to sell 2,500-3,000 copies in one week. This time though in just 3 days all the volumes managed to get as much as this:<br><br>Vol.1 - ~11,500<br>Vol.2 - ~9,700<br>Vol.3 - ~8,100<br>Vol.4 - ~7,000<br>Vol.5 - ~6,800<br><br>Still not so much, but if this week's episode will be alright for the people who are buying the manga we may finally see some of them on Oricon with an actual official sales number. So all that's left is to hope.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>It would be cool to see. If uniforms are a must then they could have something military-esque which would be popular.</br>  <br>There are also some new reviews on Amazon and most of them seems to be good.</br>  <br>So long as Nozaki-kun was there.</br>  <br> Nozaki hiding in the closest from the zombies <br> Chiyo with an axe killing anything that tries to get near him </br></br>  <br>She's already a host. The zombies can't get her.<br><br>Shovel Chiyo fanart WHEN?</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really follow the progression of her mental state, it's not really portrayed clearly enough I think. She seems to be in "capable mode" all through the helicopter stuff after it crashes, even preparing herself for eventual zombie-slashing. However, in the next chapter when they go back to the school she's explicitly shown hallucinating classmates in a POV sequence before the crawler attacks her. So she wasn't really 'back' during the helicopter part but she was 'back' enough to act correctly and understand what to do for prolonged periods of time (something that didn't happen before, she just snapped for brief periods whenever she was in front of imminent danger).</br>  <br>That's a little before the pictures I posted. I think they know after that point, but at that point, they were only suspect.</br>  <br>I dunno, that'd seem way too indirect for how this manga presents its plot points. Especially since after that scene Yuki keeps acting as if she's delusional and nobody says anything to it, which wouldn't make sense if they explicitly prompted her about not being delusional.<br><br>I think the 'you're alright now' does refer to the graduation stuff, or just some shit Rii made up cause she's insane</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it's improving but incredibly fragile. She may even be overcompensating. If something tragic happens, like to Rii, she would be back in happyland, probably permanently. <br><br><br>This is getting ridiculous. Shovel-chan is the alpha waifu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's sort of her heart knows what's going on, but her mind is protecting her from seeing it.<br>It 'opens the curtains' a bit for her to act when necessary and closes them again when safe and calm, but completely drops the act when faced with immediate danger.<br>So during the helicopter she was able to discern danger and knew she had to act, but the classroom was OH SHIT!</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't they have to walk 3 floors through smoke and zombies while nearly suffocating during heli thing? Also Yuuri blacked out too. That seems immediate enough. If she "closed off" again after that, then wouldn't she also close off after the classroom zombie (which she didn't, I think she's 100% normal now)<br><br><br>Not sure about that, since she already moved over that phase after Megu-nee died.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I will wait for deel translations.</br>  <br>That's one reason I liked Wild Zero so much. There were no monsters, just morons.</br>  <br>Yeah but zombie stories NEVER do this shit well, it always becomes a fucking slog. Personally I think if people want to write about small group politics in a tight situation, they don't need the whole zombie thing, and it especially disappoints if all the survivor in-fighting stuff is introduced AFTER a zombie type story has already been developing.<br><br>For this manga in particular, it'd be even more out of place than normal since we are dealing with a very small group of schoolgirls that are friends anyway and not a relatively large, heterogeneous group of disorganized strangers. I thought it was cool that it focused on their minds slipping and their psychology in general, but if that's gonna give place to turf fighting around the city with plans and treason and triple twists and other shit, then the manga would lose all its appeal.<br><br>I'm worried about what the author decides to do from now on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We don't have much really explicit evidence to go on, but we know that she's delusional at least to some degree, as a defense mechanism in response to trauma. We know she recognizes her own mentally confused state to some degree, at least some of the time, and is aware she is different from, and a possible burden on others. We know when faced with imminent danger, (the classroom,) she will act decisively and if needed, violently, but that it is traumatic for her (obvious from the screaming, facial expressions, common sense). We know she recognizes on some level that being cheerful is a way in which she can help her friends and support them. We know she recognizes their mental states as well, ("Kurumi and Rii-san seem sad and tired, and they argue alone at night sometimes") so maybe during the helicopter incident, despite not coming fully out of her delusional state, she sees that Rii-san is not handling things well and is able to come out of it enough to act, while still remaining cheerful for Rii's sake. She's still somewhat delusional, but improving and acting a little for the sake of Rii's mental state.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was pretty happy when it seemed like they were just going to fuck off from the university, but then again they'll probably die when they go to work, and it's too soon for that.<br><br>I think that the author is mostly going for the psychological angle, focusing more on how a few characters react to what happens to them than on the bad things happening to them. I don't think we'll get any stupidly long torture/rape bullshit. It'll be more like, bad thing happens because misunderstanding, they have to kill a human to get away, and everybody's mind is fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah this series really focuses on the main girls, everything else is peripheral.<br>I really can't see any good out of introducing two whole groups with their own politics, which could overshadow the mains.<br><br>I hope the author realises this, gives the new groups an interesting and thoughtful backstory, and then renders it moot by having them die in a night-time zombie raid after 'reliable' Yuki bluescreens while on watch.</br></br></br></br>  Is Kurumi in any danger or has she become an Übermensch instead?  Vivid or DDY?  <br> 'reliable' Yuki bluescreens while on watch. <br>It's time for others to go suffering mode. I'm sure something will happen regarding Shovel's situation and also Rii's craze</br></br>  <br>The virus is working as intended. The zombification was the unintended consequence. The vaccine only prolongs the Ubermensch mode before it starts breaking down the body.</br>  <br><br>I swear, this series is Did You Spot the Gorilla: Weeb Edition.</br></br>  <br>Should ppl just make huge fires to kill the zombies like insects attracted to fires?</br>  <br>If you could keep the fire going.</br>  <br>What if they react to heat, not light? The reason they no longer notice Kurumi is because her body is cold.</br>   'reliable' Yuki bluescreens while on watch. <br>You're thinking too low of this series. <br><br> Yuki is going to be the only one not completely fucked in the head when it's all over. She's already done her time, she will see her beloved friends through to the end.  </br></br></br>  I want to hug craycray and tell her everything is going to be daijoubu.  sasuga Lerche  <br>He was already previously infected, hence why he took a shot before leaving and tried to take another shot while in the helicopter but the shakes were just too strong.<br>How he previously got bitten is irrelevant.</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would everything suddenly be in ruins? It's not like a great number of years passed.</br>  <br>The school isn't really in this advanced state of ruin.<br>It's artistic and shit.</br></br>  <br>I love the effort they put on the garter-belt.</br>  <br> Holding hands </br>  <br>The building isn't actually that fucked up to that extent, but it's more pleasing to the eye than to have them covered in blood and gore.</br>  <br>The reactions to such an ending would be hilarious.</br>   Trying to decide what I will pick up this season <br> Heard there's zombis in this one <br> As the episode start and halfway through I thought I was fooled <br> Just another SoL <br> mfw that goddamn last scene <br>I have high hopes for this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Going with the flow, unable to say no even when taken to the bedroom. Sounds like a normal teenager.</br>  <br>Good. Now read the manga, or be prepared for spoilers.</br>  <br>I can fap to that.</br>  <br>I don't care about spoilers. I already hoping for anyone dying.</br>  <br>Mii-kun holding hands with Shovel while their fluffy hair touches?<br><br>Oh wait, the manga already did that.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a second. If shovel is last year, how does she have a senpai?</br>  <br>Unsolved mystery.</br>  <br>I want to nibble on those thighs.</br>  <br>...In relation to the club?<br>Can senpai be used that way?</br></br>  <br>Maybe the outbreak started when they are second year.</br>  I'm confused, what year is everyone in? At first I thought Yuki was the only highschooler since she has a different uniform but I don't actually know.  <br>She clearly killed him, so he was still attending to school.</br>  I will only read the manga after the anime is done. But I will like the spoilers (because that doesn't ruin the experience for me). If anyone is kind enough to give me the major spoilers, it will be appreciated.  <br>I don't think so. We know that Miki is their junior, but she introduced herself as from class 2B. It's unlikely that Miki would have considered herself going up a year despite everything going to hell, and besides, I believe Japanese students are reassigned classes when they go up a year so she wouldn't know if she would be in class 2A/B/C etc.<br><br>I think it might be a mangaka error. He might not have decided what year they were in until later, and decided on making him a senpai so he wouldn't have to give him a name. We'll see when the next episode airs, though. If she doesn't call him senpai then it probably means just that.</br></br></br>  All I want is to believe that human nature is fundamentally good. And that a miracle exists and everyone is going to be fine in the end.  <br>W-what?<br>Am I supposed to be seeing something here?</br></br>  <br>That's just the baseball club. Nothing to worry about!</br>  <br>Oh, you mean that.<br>I thought there was something wrong with the dog.</br></br>  <br>Not now, boner, survival first, repopulation after.</br>  <br>She was made to be sexualized.</br>  <br>I wonder how much Miki will regret throwing away that gun when the bike gang start to rape her. <br><br>Everything gonna be diejobu though, Shovel gonna eat them alive.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're just joking, but I've been seeing this a lot lately so I might as well say it. There hasn't even been a single thing hinting that Kurumi will crave flesh before turning. Neither the helicopter pilot nor the radio girl showed behaviour of craving living human flesh. And Megu-nee was able overcome her craving when she first turned into a zombie, it was only when she completely lost consciousness that she couldn't control it.</br>  <br> Megu-nee is an illusion of Yuki, real Megu-nee got bitten and is dead. <br> Shovel's crush (a boy) is dead, ended by Shovel herself. <br> Kei is dead. <br> Taromaru is dead. <br> Shovel's family is gone. <br> Shovel gets bitten, medicine doesn't fully work, will likely die. <br> Radio girl dies before they get to her. <br> Rii-nee's sister is likely dead. <br> Ruu-chan is an illusion of Rii-nee, a sister substitute. She is actually a teddy bear. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Mfw the studio would fuck up depressing episode. <br>I shouldn't put my hope this high.</br>  <br> she wouldn't know if she would be in class 2A/B/C etc. <br>When in doubt, ask Megu-nee.</br></br>  <br>unf unf</br>  <br>Don't forget that  the one who bit Kurumi was Megu-nee, and Rii almost kills Kurumi. And that a helicopter crashes while trying to save them, setting the school on fire, which leads to Yuki finally snapping out of her delusion, but only after they lost almost everything. </br>  <br>Also<br> Zombie apocalypse is planned by someone <br> Chopper-kun dies. <br> Zombies used to be people. </br></br></br></br>  <br>But she won't be pure any more.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks dudes. I didn't think someone will take the bother, thank you really much.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder when will we see another turned mammal.</br>  <br>Another major spoiler;  They are not fine. </br>  <br>Humans are mammals as well, anon.</br>  <br>Quads confirm, humans were mammals all along.</br>  <br>All we need now is a zombie apocalypse where only birds can turn.</br>  <br>Bats are mammals.<br>They already use echolocation so their turning into zombies does not handicap them in any way.<br>It's a real nightmare.</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much Birdemic.</br>  Having already knew the twist before going into episode 1 that was probably the most stressful shit I have ever watched.  <br> the most stressful shit I have ever watched <br>You should've been in the manga dumping threads and experience what is like having to wait a minute between images.

How fucked are you? Make sure to post how fucked you are on each one if you have more than one favorite.<br> everybody in my family would be terrified of rachnee <br> they'd probably get along better with cathyl, since she's a friendly girl from the good ol' south. they'd just want her to wear something without all the cleavage exposure of her normal outfit <br> They'd all love Zombina. She's a tomboy who loves guns and action movies. My dad would geek out about weapons and the military with her, my brothers would watch movies with her all night, and my mom would just be happy I have somebody in my life. At least if they could get past the whole undead thing. </br></br></br>  To those saying there is nothing to Miia's character beyond her lust for Kimihito, let's note that she has a particular obsession with becoming "girly" in a human sense, be it the design of her room, her desire to play a magical girl, or her fascination with fairy tale romances. <br><br>There's also her sexual mores, which seem downright prudish compared to the society she was raised in. Her mother even noted she was considered "shy" growing up.</br></br>  <br>Moe</br>  <br>My mother would literally die from seeing Rachne, but I'm sure my dad would have one of those "I know exactly what you do at night" faces on.</br>  <br>It's really Suu's harem, she's just having trouble securing her bottom bitch.</br>  <br>Mero is really sweet</br>  I love all the girls. None of them have done enough for me to hate them outright, and they all have their character strengths and flaws.<br><br>But I think we can all agree that Rachnee is most seductive girl,  with maybe Miia's mom in close second </br></br>  <br>She's always been girly. As a kid she was shown reading princess books.</br>  The stream's at 11:30 right?  <br>is someone gonna stream it?</br>  <br>Yes<br>I would be kind enough to post a link, but I dont want the stream taken down</br></br>  <br>Yes, but she clearly struggles with matching her girly desires with her passionate lamia nature. Hence she keeps trying.</br>  <br>Are we assuming this is the first time they've ever heard of/seen a monster girl or do they already know they exist? I think my family would be mostly cool with Miia but they would probably tease me about it because   I'm deathly afraid of snakes. </br>  <br>They know that monster girls exist, and maybe they've seen one or two in public with their host, but they've never really met one.</br>  <br><br>Where's the rest?</br></br>  <br> I love all the girls. None of them have done enough for me to hate them outright, and they all have their character strengths and flaws. <br>Agreed. For me the "worst" girl is merely just alright, I like them all to varying degrees.</br></br>  <br> bird people who just do whatever the fuck they want <br><br>Harpies best race.

I will fap 1 chapter in and blow my load, and lose all interest in the story. </br>  <br>It's not really hard to follow. It's a stupid story but his wife is so good you wanna read it and see what happens to her.</br>  <br>This isn't even reverse ntr everyone who tagged it should be banned. We areng meant to feel anything for the wife, and the co-worker never intended to steal him away</br>  <br>I feel bad for the guy, but he set himself up for this. <br>1 - he cheats on his wife and wife feels bad<br>2 - he tries to cheat on wife but cant and goes home to feel bad<br>3 - wifes stop fucking senpai, but MC just gives up the relationship<br><br>I just want to see some suffering<br> Mc snaps and tries to fight senpai but ends up looking pathetic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he fucking dug his own grave.

When will Haruka break anyway?</br>  I don't even understand this shit, the MC asks his wife to have sex with someone else? This has got to be satire.  <br>This is actually a thing. Search cuckold.</br>  <br>I believe this means she's pretty broken. Also, at the end of the chapter those were  divorce papers. </br>  <br>Don't even try to use reason or logic. Netorare is about the most retarded fetish that exists.</br>  God I love this artists style. His women are gorgeous.  <br>He's into NTR and cant achieve orgasm otherwise.<br>Now MC regrets it because he isnt in control anynore of the NTR and the wife is fucking Chad Thundercock from highschool.<br>The suprising thing is despite all that she wont let him come inside.<br>I wonder if a divorce will actually happen or they sort their shit out finally.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br> She wants Shu-chan to suffer. </br>  <br>I love NTR and all but I can't handle this much despair, even though it was self inflicted.</br>  <br> The suprising thing is despite all that she wont let him come inside. <br>Chad Thundercock? He does it in ch 16.</br></br>  <br>She basically ask the senpai for his phone so she could send the video of them fucking and sucking to the MC</br>  <br>Got to respect a man that dug his own grave and jumped in it.</br>  <br><br><br>I will eat my own hat if this beta ass nigga manages to man up</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know about it existing.</br>  <br>And then this gem happened.</br>  <br>It has 17 chapters of NTR.<br>And it will probably end with him being more NTR'd so</br></br>  <br><br>I'm diamonds right now.

I don't know how I feel about this." </br>  <br>She's hot</br>  <br> woman calling herself a MILF <br>That's not how it works, is it?</br></br>  <br> yfw he turns into goddam Guts after all this suffering </br>  <br>From cucking the husband or getting cucked?</br>  I just want one of them to completely go insane and kill the others. That shit would be icing on this cake.  <br><br><br>Cucking the husband plus I have a thing for older chicks</br></br></br>  yfw she starts going mad with power and becomes a dominatrix and cucks them both with a superior bull all the while clad in latex  I don't know what to feel when reading this.  <br>Don't even compare him to Guts. All his suffering was his own fault. He had a loving wife and he went to extreme lengths to corrupt her.</br>    <br>Pity, and something else I have yet to describe, but its kind of like that one /fit/ reaction image.</br>  I've wanted to read this for a while but i'll wait for it to end  <br>Mostly this one</br>  <br>As long as the story doesn't end in<br> Murder <br>or<br> MC's wife becomes High School friend's slave </br></br></br></br>  Anyone else fap to both NTR and Netori? Just depends on what mood I'm in  <br>Holy fuck, only In the land of the free.</br>  <br>I do it based on art and or how much I want to see a man or woman suffer</br>  I just wanted to fap I've been reading this since the first chapter got translated<br>And to this day I still just read it for the fap<br>The art is just so good and the scenes with mc's wife getting fucked by chad thundercock are extremely arousing</br></br>  <br>senpai's face, dude needs to get the fuck out before he gets caught in this abyss</br>  <br><br><br>Nah Swedens in on it too</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see how you can not fap to both, since Netori and NTR are two sides of the same coin. There's someone taking, and someone being taken.</br>  <br>I like both. <br><br>My favorite "genre" is Yandere tho, I like Yandere H more than anything. Not crazy Yandere like that one that opens her senpai and stuff. Lovely Yandere</br></br></br>  Why is Haruka so perfect /a/?  <br>I just want MC life to crash and burn pretty hard. Is senpai even dating anyone ?</br>  <br>I'm in it for the mind-broken sluts betraying their loved ones anyway so I don't care either way.</br>  <br>MC's wife<br><br> kek </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but you have those people who instantly self insert as the MC and hate it when he gets NTRd but like it if he is doing the NTR</br>  <br>I fap to neither. It just reaffirms my stand with women being sluts and all. That and I get a good laugh out of it.</br>  <br> Is senpai even dating anyone ? <br>I don't even think this nigga got a job. All he's doing is fucking Haruka 24/7</br></br>  <br>and he's doing a mighty fine job with it</br>  <br>He's Chad. Doesn't need a job. <br><br>Also does the MC have a small dick or something? Premature ejaculation stuff like that?<br><br>I want to read it but that is really boring, sluts going crazy 'cause "muh cooock"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He deserves it. He could have stop staring into the abyss a long time ago.</br>  Theres only hatred left in the heart of the wife. MC could stopped everything if he just said fuck it which the wife also hopped it would happen until she realized that the guy that got jealous just from a Training coach teaching her tennis doesnt ecist anymore.  <br>He only get's despair boners. His dick is as big as thundercock.</br>  <br>He cant get an orgasm until he gets NTR'd he ssked his wife to sleep with other man while watching.</br>  I see it ending like <br> MC and wife divorce <br> MC ends up with co worker  <br> wife ends up senpai but is always thinking about MC in sex and in just life </br></br></br>  <br>Should give him a bonus.</br>  <br><br><br>This. Rape, Mindbreak and corruption are my fetishes. Just so happens it gets featured in NTR a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate this because the pacing is slow, i heard theres another volume coming, so I have a right to be mad. The ntr now is weird, wife wants MC to suffer and Senpai is just there. Im about to wait a month or two before I dive into this pit. See you later anon<br><br> I want to see everyone suffer </br></br></br>  <br>Why the fuck are you even posting if you haven't read it? Fuck off to  with your Chad shit too.</br>  <br>The only dynamic left between them is NTR once thats gone everyone will crash when pulled back into reality.</br>  <br> another volume <br>It's not ending yet? Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>And imagine all those Swedes fighting and dying for their country. They must be rolling in their graves. Pretty much goes for any country but even more so for this one.</br>  <br> MC ends up with co worker <br>And the exact same thing happens. The cycle repeats itself until he kills himself.</br></br>   MC moves on and marries his coworker <br> Wife ends up with senpai but senpai becomes the new cuck and the cycle repeats </br>  <br> Less than 7.5" </br>  <br>of all the shit that happened i want wife to be happy at least, preferably with a nice family. without getting fucked by random guys. MC could have his dick cut off</br>    <br>No I don't think it will. This whole fetish of his is Haruka-fixated. He's only like this because he couldn't handle the trauma of his childhood friend getting a boyfriend, very contrary to his expectations. Co-worker will be a relatively clean slate where this stuff won't affect him, at least if he's able to rid himself of most of the baggage.</br>  <br>Most probable ending</br>  <br>Don't forget you can't have a GF either.</br>  <br>Too bad your dick is likely smaller than 7.5 inches.</br>  <br>He only has a fetish because his entire relationship with his wife involved trying to prevent other men from fucking her in high school/college, thus developing an inferiority complex.</br>  <br>How much is 7.5? <br><br>In cm</br></br></br>  This whole series, is really stupid and I felt nothing for it unlike some of the golden ones. The timeless classics that made the board collapse. I'm just following it cause I want to see how it ends. It's been 18 chapters of her cheating on him, and I want closure. <br><br>If she stays with him, cool, but I believe a broken marriage has more possibilities for open endings. Not to mention, it would be more memorable than a happy ending, pun intended.</br></br>  <br>A simple google conversion away.</br>  <br>19 cm</br>  <br>Time to go kill myself since I've disappointed the pussy pedestal.</br>  <br><br><br>Y-yeah thats whats stopping me</br></br></br>  <br><br>She gone man</br></br>  The wife still loves the guy, she's fucking mcStud for his sake.<br><br>Well, at least that's how it goes in her mind.<br>Remember when she was groped in a train? Her views on love were skewed by that moment.<br>She believes the hubby is her white knight in shining armor, he will save her if anything happens, but she is confused because it seemed that he gets off by her being fucked by others.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean "stupid"?</br>  <br> of all the shit that happened i want wife to be happy at least <br><br>Beta white knight, what the fuck are you doing?<br><br>The wife is the one keeping it going. She wants to see her husband burn and doesn't care who's fucking her. She was a victim at first, but she's completely turned evil. Shit nigga, the husband is now the victim, open your eyes. This is why you're eternally in the friend zone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what are they saying</br>  <br> Shit nigga, the husband is now the victim, <br>The tables aren't turning in any one person's favor, and there isn't a black and white, good guy bad guy dichotomy anymore. They're both victims, they're both perpetrators.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that like really idiotic? I mean I get that people DO have dicks that size but it's really uncommon. <br>Also 19 cm is really big.</br></br>  <br>The main idea so far is that she's pushing him to the point where he mans up and ends everything/beats up sempai. The part where it'll fucking go south is that all this cucking has killed his love/caring for her, and his coworker (who wants his dick and looks sort of like her) already knows. <br><br>So, when confronted with the divorce papers he's going to sign them and fuck off elsewhere, and eventually fuck the coworker. Because anything else at this point will end the fucking story in 2 chapters (her falling for the dick and really leaving him, or him manning up and ending everything), and would be a massive letdown in comparison.</br></br></br>  It seems every chapter is the same. There's never any progress. It's like reading Naruto.  Man this shit has drug on so long I'm not even fapping it to it anymore. I just want to see how it ends. Just like Emergence.  <br> What do you mean "stupid"? <br><br>It's bad. The husband is a dumbass, the wife is a dumbass and the story hasn't advanced since chapter 8, but only further devolved into a cuck fest for the sake of drama, which has long run its course. <br><br>It is squeezing the NTR angle, when the NTR happened long ago. It's the rule of 3, you can only do it so much before it becomes redundant, and we're long past that point.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to the world of size queens.</br>  <br>is anybody gonna post source or nah</br>  <br>doubt about the second option, he looks like he kinda care about Haruka</br>  <br>Not white knighting anon, the MC did this shit on him. She expected him to stop all this shit at a certain point but he never did. She was a devoted housewife who believed that by doing all those shit MC's problem would be solved. She has her faults as well but mainly MC is the one at fault for starting this whole mess. I want her to be happy so MC realizes just how much he fucked up. her happy face = MC sees her smiling face. MC suffers more. Of course I'd be fine with the both of them heading into a complete mess of a life</br>  <br> They're both victims, they're both perpetrators. <br><br>Except they're not. One of them, is suffering, the other is instigating. One of them has tried to get this to stop, the other is keeping it going. They're both idiots, neither of them is right, but one of them continues to be wrong.<br><br>You have been brain washed by the SJW, where did your balls go?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source has been posted multiple times, learn to fish nigga.</br>  <br> being this retarded </br>  Just wondering but how's Chad feel about all this?<br><br>Hope he starts jumping off the train when he realizes bitch is going full crazy</br></br>  <br>The story hasn't advanced because each chapter focuses more in explaining each of the characters, their motivations, etc.<br><br>The latest chapter explains thoroughly what goes on in the wife's mind, to her, hubby is shining prince that will sweep her off her feet should anything bad happen to her.<br><br>Now obviously that ain't happening because hubby is an indecisive cuck, but she's already made up her mind to degrade herself further until he does.<br><br>This series is more character driven than story driven.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I saw your wife cheating on you </br>  Is 18 out?  <br>He already realizes this, latest chapter page 17.<br><br>But he still wants the pussy.<br>Actually, dude seems to be the only salvageable part of the relationship.</br></br></br></br>  I feel bad everytime I read a new chapter.<br>I hope MC can just get a divorce and be happy.<br> I want his wife to suffer </br></br>  <br> The husband is a dumbass, the wife is a dumbass <br>You're just spouting a synonym of the word I asked you to clarify. Neither of them are logical robots that have the convenience of the reader's overview of the circumstances. They're also not going to be expected to be "not stupid" since that is the cause of the conflict, if not all conflicts ever.<br> the story hasn't advanced since chapter 8, but only further devolved into a cuck fest for the sake of drama <br>He isn't the only character in the story. Each time we've also seen Haruka be tested emotionally, and then the element of her previous, near perfect exbf was introduced. Have you been paying attention at all?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Senpai is not happy.<br>She will be alone in the end  maybe fucking random guys everyday, but will not be in love with anyone </br></br>  <br>I want an absolute disaster of an ending where no one ends up happy</br>  <br> I feel bad everytime I read a new chapter. <br> I hope MC can just get a divorce and be happy. <br> I want his wife to suffer <br><br>MC is mentally challenged. He likes to be cucked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ignoring the fact that all this happened because of him. <br>Just face it anon even if they get a divorce he'll never be happy sexually. aside from his fetish this whole mess is going to leave a major scar on him.</br></br>  <br> ignoring the fact that all this happened because of him. <br>I know it's his fault, but his wife is a slut now.<br>I want him to be happy, maybe with his co-worker, maybe with someone else, maybe alone, but not with his wife.</br></br></br>  <br>Neat. Now I kinda want to see how a proBull's life must feel especually since you're probably fucking crazies most of the time</br>  <br> One of them has tried to get this to stop, the other is keeping it going <br>They're both going on. They're both reluctant about continuing. They're both wrong for not completely stopping. There's nuance but these are the basics.<br> SJW <br>Get the fuck out of here.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hubby is shining prince that will sweep her off her feet should anything bad happen to her. <br><br>But we've known this, this isn't shakespear we're trying to decipher. There isn't any layered meanings and metaphors. You may think of it as "character driving plot" but I see it as stalling for time to squeeze out more chapters. All shitty media fall on this when they need filler or padding. Everyone in this work talk a lot, but is anything being done, is progress being made? Nope. Empty, meaning less words.<br><br><br> Now obviously that ain't happening because hubby is an indecisive cuck, <br><br>Anon, when the name of a porno mag has NTR in the title, that's a foregone conclusion. Not dissing you, but isn't that why we're here? Are you not entertained?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Despite the NTR this series is actually just standard MISUNDERSTANDING drama plot.<br><br>Neither characters can properly express their thoughts and emotion to the other, leading to suffering for both.</br></br>  I hope senpai can be happy with someone else, that bitch is crazy.  <br>i for one want the two of them to be miserable piles of shit</br>  <br>i guess it can if she's a narcissist</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128055746 <br>Read the thread. Sauce was already posted.</br>  I wonder how many people hate ntr but keep reading it because they like the story. And then after 20 chapters they'll realize they're now cucks.  <br>My purpose is to post sauce when requested. Nothing more.</br>  <br>I wish I never started reading this shit.<br>I can't enjoy the ride, reading it makes me sad but I can't stop anymore.</br></br>  <br>I request you kill yourself</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128055746 <br> Actually using a trip </br>  <br><br>4chains has a built in filter, it's as easy as copy pasta. Please use it liberally.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128055757 <br><br><br>Whoa there Charles Dickens I didn't ask for a novel</br></br></br>  <br> Everyone in this work talk a lot, but is anything being done, is progress being made? Nope. Empty, meaning less words. <br>What the hell are you on about? Did you even read the latest chapter? Look at what Haruka's state of mind is. Look at the reality MC is going to have to confront with that coworker. You aren't even reading the story, you're illiterate and just looking at the pictures.</br></br>  What the fuck is reverse NTR.  <br> netori </br>  <br>This. And the tits are nice.</br>  Maybe it'll end with MC's wife wanting MC back, but MC looks at her with dead eyes and leaves with a new and pure girl.  Are you an NTR fan when you fantasize of being the homewrecker? I want to be the cock jock of an unsatisfied woman. Does this just make me a bad person?<br><br>Is it so wrong to dream of being the faceless bald fat man?</br></br>  <br>  </br>  <br> Not inserting as the girl </br>  <br>I insert myself into the woman.<br><br>After years of internet feminist brainwashing, I get off on women being sexually liberal.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah. NTR fan just like to bask in all the suffering. It is for me anyway.</br>  I hate OP for posting this on /a/. I've been trying to forget this series because my mind will just speculate on what will happen for a long time.  <br>There's actually nothing more alpha than the experienced old man. Congratulations on your high testosterone levels.</br>  <br> Does this just make me a bad person? <br><br>Kinda, yeah<br><br>Seeing through the suffering of another human is one of the bigger parts of being a bad person. There aren't too many bigger parts to being a bad person. Its mainly about hurting others, enjoying it, or even if you don't enjoy it at times either still profiting on it without changing or not making up for it. Saying we feel bad in those situations is just lip service to ourselves "but I'm still good, right? Yeah clearly, I mean it felt bad".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Onii-sama will save them all</br>  <br> What the hell are you on about? <br><br>The narrative and plot in this is so lack luster, I read chapters in dumps because it was too monotonous to keep up with each one as it released. <br><br> Did you even read the latest chapter? Look at what Haruka's state of mind is. Look at the reality MC is going to have to confront with that coworker. <br><br>She has been broken since the NTR started. How fucking shocked are you that the cheating, cum dump wife is mind broken? I thought this was common place in NTR. <br><br> You aren't even reading the story, you're illiterate and just looking at the pictures. <br><br>The story is asinine. You're trying to find deeper meaning in your wanking material so you can act haughty online when another person calls your wanking material, wanking material. Chad Thundercock hasn't added anything to the plot, he might as well be a faceless old man. How well does a story come off, if you include a character for many chapters, that is devoid of purpose? <br><br>It's like I'm taking crazy pills. Do you believe this NTR story, is well written?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it depends on how much you know about the other party. If you're led to believe they're single when they're not, you're innocent. It's when you say things like "Am I bigger than your husband?" that you officially become a terrible human being.</br>  So I'm reading the first chapter of this, and knowing that the MC is the one that cheats first pisses me off. What a faggot, he has a perfect marriage and he purposely sends it down the shitter.  <br> She has been broken since the NTR started. <br>Wrong.<br>She broke after she was groped, hubby saved her, then got turned on by that, you could actually see her trying to make sense of it all and failing to do so by asking for Chad, and  reveals that she's actually still thinking of hubby all this time, all this shit was for HIS sake.<br><br> Chad Thundercock hasn't added anything to the plot, he might as well be a faceless old man. <br>But he has contributed greatly, before Chad, wifey didn't enjoy fucking random men, hubby didn't care much about wifey because they were just random men and he's taking her for granted thinking she'll still love him no matter what.<br>Thundercock changed the game, he made his intentions of taking her crystal clear, and hubby realizes that wifey wants the Chad, he realizes he could actually lose her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    people still raging over this <br>I read this to heal my soul from Hime Kishi Tame. Thats how tame this is.</br>  <br>He banged the kouhai ??<br><br>fuck yes, sasuga MC</br></br></br>  <br>Mah nigga, also femdom.</br>  <br> so lack luster <br>How? You might as well go back to saying nothing by calling it "stupid" again.<br> too monotonous to keep up with each one as it released. <br>I don't care if you're impatient, but try to keep your own faults separate from your opinion of the story.<br> She has been broken since the NTR started <br>Being broken isn't just a binary state. We've seen it progress and come to halts/recede during bouts of lucidity about what she's doing. How her character handles the circumstances isn't just simplifiable to "she's broken" and that's it.<br> You're trying to find deeper meaning in your wanking material so you can act haughty online <br>Lol you're delusional. I disagreed with there being nothing to the story. That doesn't mean I think it's the Bible or whatever. You're stuck in a clusterfuck of dichotomies. Just because someone doesn't completely agree with you, it doesn't mean they want your family dead.<br> Chad Thundercock hasn't added anything to the plot <br>He is MC's past trauma incarnate you buffoon. He's also the first guy Haruka has wanted since the NTR started. He also voiced to the MC that he wants Haruka for himself. You're so goddam ignorant it's unbelievable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>My boy. Just fapped to this diamond the other day<br><br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/814075/b34960<wbr>8117/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> knowing that the MC is the one that cheats first pisses me off. <br>What? No.<br><br> He banged the kouhai ?? <br>What? No.<br><br>What the hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wrong. <br><br>Pic from the very chapter, you are bringing up. She's broken, it happened before but this was the point of no return. The point where she wanted to hurt him. At this point she wanted Chad, not because she wants him, but because she knows her husband hates him. <br><br> all this shit was for HIS sake. <br><br>She's fucking other men for his sake. What a woman, it rends my heart know there are such devoted wives out there willing to take a dick for their husbands. She's a paragon of what wives should aspire to. <br><br> hubby realizes that wifey wants the Chad, he realizes he could actually lose her. <br><br>Chad is introduced at chapter 9 and we're at chapter 18. What you said is true, but my beef with it is that is hasn't advanced the plot in 9 chapters. Chad comes in, he wants his wife. I just summed up 9 chapters, and saved others the trouble. His main quality, being a point of contention for the husband, could be taken up by any male character with a big dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  what does NTR mean?  <br>She broke because she tried to make sense between her definition of love and her husband's love.<br>She thinks that he wants to be hurt, I know it's fucked up, that's the point, she can't make sense of it and this is her twisted way of making sense of it.<br><br>Chad also serves to give "This shit is fucked up" reactions, as seen in<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not To Return</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._T.<wbr>_Rama_Rao</wbr></br>  <br>Neo Tokyo rape</br>  <br><br> MC's past trauma incarnate  <br>Wait what? Isn't the Chad guy the same person the wife was in love with in Highschool and they kissed on the ferris wheel?</br></br></br>  <br> She thinks that he wants to be hurt, I know it's fucked up, that's the point, she can't make sense of it and this is her twisted way of making sense of it. <br><br>You're starting to sound like a woman to me, ease up on the estrogen injections. You summed up the plot with those lines, but that doesn't stop all of this from being extremely silly. It's NTR, but I can't help but raise an eyebrow and smirk. It is purely my opinion, but I just don't believe this is "good" ntr when compared to what came before. <br><br>Lastly, this line I'm quoting from you doesn't seem to be contentious in tone...... so we coo bro? No hard feelings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Chad <br>Dude, come on. Leave that shit on the other boards. But yes, Takakura is the same guy from back then.</br></br>  <br>they were reunited in a strange situation.</br>  <br>Nope. Ch 16 cemented his ass as Chad when they were in the tub. He's like 2 head taller than the other guy with rippling muscles and giant cock.</br>  Funnily enough the only one I see getting a happy ending is MC.<br>Also if you want to read good NTR read Seme Danjous stuff.</br>  <br>Explaining a character's motivations doesn't mean one shares the motivations or agrees with them. Why can't you mentally separate the two? That's the reason you seem to dislike the story too, because you lack that capability. Being condescending like you are isn't going to hide that.</br>   implying this is reverse ntr <br>Reverse ntr is when a girl steals a man away from another girl and is my ultimate fetish that no one panders to. I've only Ever seen one doujin like that and it was some nisekoi one where onodera mind breaks after watching raku and chitoge have sex so she rapes him later out of desperation.</br>  <br>I think I only read 4 and all were Yandere.</br>   mfw someone trying to make sense of NTR <br>http://www.thedailybeast.com/articl<wbr>es/2010/07/29/cuckolding-the-sex-fe<wbr>tish-for-intellectuals.html</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Explaining a character's motivations doesn't mean one shares the motivations or agrees with them <br><br>I've read all the chapters so that alone is evidence that I have tried to empathize with the setting. <br><br> Why can't you mentally separate the two? <br><br>Because the story is shit, and I can't get over how the story is shit. I can't enjoy it, but I still want to see it unfold.<br><br> That's the reason you seem to dislike the story too, because you lack that capability. Being condescending like you are isn't going to hide that. <br><br>If a work is good, you enjoy it. If its bad, you don't. Have you stopped to think, that maybe if it was better, I wouldn't be poking holes in it? Holes which are self inflicted?<br><br>Here I thought you were mah nigga, since you're the only one that keeps consistently replying to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thedailybeast </br>  <br>I know how it is friend, search pic related if you liked that nisekoi doujin.</br>  <br>What the fuck.</br>  why does this make me angry to the point im frothing in the mouth   just got done fapping to NTRPG2 <br> left with a very negative feeling <br><br>Christ it makes me angry how pathetic the main guy is in ntr shit, like it's more irritating than anything<br>Netoraserare is the ONLY cheating type of shit I like, and that's just because the author draws the best asses I've ever seen</br></br></br></br>  <br> story is shit <br>Why do you keep repeating this mistake? You keep using a contextually defined word like story, but leaving out the context, and describing it using words with vague-to-no meaning whatsoever about them. "It's shit" is the lowest form of pseudo-criticism, and if you keep using it I can only assume that you don't have anything substantial to say about your position, and therefore your position isn't a very good one.<br> I can't enjoy it, but I still want to see it unfold. <br>You're lying to yourself. Simple as that.<br> Have you stopped to think, that maybe if it was better, I wouldn't be poking holes in it <br>No, since I've seen tons of people "poke holes in"/nitpick good things just to be contrarian. Not saying that's what you're doing. I don't have a good grasp on what "better" subjectively is to you.<br>I also don't know how you can "poke holes" yet have those holes be "self inflicted". That's contradictory.<br> since you're the only one that keeps consistently replying to me. <br>There's more than me and you here, just saying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no one panders to <br>Nigga please, it's not that obscure, even a simple search on sadpanda gave like 3-4 pages worth. Also:<br>http://g.e-hentai.org/g/604335/9b87<wbr>63b72b/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> I don't have a good grasp on what "better" subjectively is to you. <br><br>An interesting story where each chapter advances the plot and allows the characters to define themselves through their actions. <br><br> I also don't know how you can "poke holes" yet have those holes be "self inflicted". That's contradictory. <br><br>That was just being being a rabblerouser, spicing up my language to make it more entertaining to consume. Not to pull my own horn, but I'm skilled at shit posting. My past works are displayed on the banners. Tee hee.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone read Chains of Lust?    Is it bad if I hope for everyone to have a destructive end to this?<br><br>I want the MC to lose everything.<br><br>I want beef mclargehuge to get mentally fucked up to the point where he needs to be institutionalized.<br><br>and I want the wife to become yandere, murder someone, and get arrested.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> chapter advances the plot and allows the characters to define themselves through their actions. <br>Both of these happen. The plot progresses through the characters, even if the characters aren't exactly uniform in their own development. And of course the characters are defined by their actions. Most of the time you've referred to them, it's been through naming them after an action they've taken.<br> but I'm skilled at shit posting <br>I don't particularly care if you are, but if you're hiding behind that facade because you can't competently back up your own opinion then you're a coward.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck I hate that Fakku faggot so much. Why did this go under my radar for so long?</br>   Ch.17 <br><br>MC should just kill himself already.</br></br>  <br>Because they are filled with idiots that can't stand NTR yet still read this. I doln't get it either.</br>  <br>I think the real question here is, can this girl get him hard?</br>  Based. I hope he does, MC's done nothing but cry and turn his wife into a monster.  <br>MC is beta as cuck.</br>  <br>Hisasi chose to release his works in english officially, why do you hate that? If you really like it stop being a faggot and support what the artist is doing with fakku</br>  <br>It'll be hard, and who knows if it's be worth it. Haruka and Shu are both obsessed with each other, regardless of what wicked form that obsession takes. Of course Haruka has a bangin bod worthy of a high test alpha stud like Takakura, but she's mentally worn and almost is in pieces, and not exactly in the attractive kind of way. He's really going to have to tread carefully, and it'll take more than dick to fix her since dick was basically the actual cause.</br>  Literally the worst MC of all time. Fucking cuck.  If you rage at the the MC that means it's a good NTR, right? Since it's what NTR is all about.  <br> a good NTR <br>If it gets you hard then it's good.</br></br>  MC deserves to lose his waifu.<br> Hey honey I can only get off while I watch you getting fucked by other men. <br>His waifu is either retarded or a slut.</br></br>  NTR threads are so fucking hilarious. <br><br>Most of the people in it are complaining about the NTR, clearly showing us that the fucking thread is filled with Vanillafags reading NTR and in denial about the fact that they love NTR the way a closet masochist enjoys pain.<br><br>If you were simply an NTR lover, you wouldn't even be complaining about this shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not even the artist choice it's just Fakku taking a monopoly on all the Wani stuffs and put it all behind a paywall.</br>  <br>I like it because I like seeing a woman give in to the primal urges of pleasure despite her reasonable self.<br><br>I don't like suffering or beta cuck MC.</br></br></br>  <br>This, but we'll have to wait until the ride is over before we can critically analyze the story. It looks like Wife wants MC to suffer, and it looks like he is about to snap; only time will tell.</br>  <br>You're an idiot. Fakku just brought bosshi out to anime expo the artists are 100% involved</br>  <br>Maybe, but some people may get bothered by there being a male main character as a vehicle for the story due to some mental inability forcing them to self insert. Thereafter, everything becomes absolutely personal for them and makes them hotheaded and frustrated when they perceive a threat or something otherwise unfavorable happening to them. That's not to say that self insertion should be prohibited to anyone or that it isn't a valid way to empathize with the characters, but the people that throw a fit while self inserting are the very definition of "doing it wrong". The mistake being made is they're mentally trying to fit the story into their own little reality instead of treating the story as it's own reality distinct from the reader's. Any inconsistencies between the two are met with hostility from being unable to cope. If that's not insecurity then I don't know what is. Mind you, I'm not saying that people who don't like or even dislike NTR are just unable to like NTR because of personal problems or something, but the subset of people who strongly find NTR vehemently despicable and who fancy spouting their favorite c-word like a well conditioned sheep/cultist are the ones that need to take the time to simply calm the fuck down.</br>  <br>What's even more hilarious is that vanillafags legitimately think NTRfags self insert like they do.</br>  <br>It's okay anon. the girl who loves you wouldnt care.<br>Unless its the size of your pinky. If so kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Which is why cheating is the best tag</br>  <br><br>This. The people who bitch about how much they hate NTR and how people who like NTR are mentally fucked up are actually the ones with issues.</br></br>  What's this story even about right now?  <br><br>Fuck off NTRfags. You're the most pleb out of plebs in the hentai community.</br></br>  <br>Wow its like anime attracts degenerates or something and thats why theres porn on an anime board.</br>  <br>NTR isn't that bad, but it's so uncreative and boring. Sometimes a good story pops up, but usually it's the artist catering to the easy demographic.<br><br>NTR = $$$</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny how you didn't quote the post that said basically the same thing but had more than two lines in it. Really says a lot about people who like to fan the flames.</br>  <br>This is why I don't leave the house</br>  <br>the mental gymnastics NTRfags do to justify a fetish... <br><br>I for 1 do not care what gets you horny.<br><br>And stop with the self insert bullshit. Netorare is a genre where the intent is to cause an emotion of deep jealousy or distress in the reader.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or great laughter. I'm pretty sure any loyal reader would end up becoming detached and just end up not really feeling anything except horny.</br>  <br>I don't think she's doing this to serve her husband's NTR fantasies, I think she's just done with him. That's why there's divorce papers at the end of the chapter.<br><br>BTW I can't believe I read this whole fucking thing. Fuck you guys.</br></br></br>  <br>You confuse "respect" for "mock".</br>  God I love the art , but my heart can't take it  <br>Of course not. How can you shitpost against a reasonable argument?</br>  Source?  <br>Boku no Picorasare.</br>  This manga makes me scared as fuck of unknowingly having this fetish. I'd probably just kill myself.  <br>Why would you be scared of something you love? Take responsibility, have a wank.</br>  <br>As long as you're not a self insert and can distinguish between reality and blatant fiction, you'll be fine</br>  <br>Its meh since no charters are likable in this</br>  <br> self insert <br><br>Netori=/=NTR</br></br></br>  <br> implying people don't auto-self insert as the MC and complain NTR is the worst fetish afterward because muh feels </br>  <br>People still self insert in NTR.</br>  <br>You don't self insert as the girl?</br>  <br>What I do is irrelevant. I don't self insert at all, I just enjoy the ride.</br>   letting the MC "get back" at his wife for the ntr <br><br>This is always the fucking worst. Never what I come to ntr for.</br></br>  <br>Yeah a chance for "revenge" is especially stupid in this considering Shu instigated the whole ordeal</br>    <br>Netori is for Alphas<br><br>NTR is for beta chuckfags <br><br>Muh self insert... sure ok, ok tell yourself that all you want fag.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anons, just read the whole thing, I did not know what to think, so I searched for another stuff to fap to, b-but I can not get an erection, is this normal?  <br>both are for faggots.<br>Mind break/corruption is for alphas. <br>netori or ntr are both about the other men and the women is just a tool .</br></br></br>  <br> ... <br><br>Stop.</br></br></br>  <br> Shu instigated the whole ordeal <br><br>The wife was always a slut. she was easily willing to fuck other men. and it's obvious she wasn't over her first boyfriend.</br></br></br>  <br>The point is that it's retarded to self insert into hentai in the first place</br>    <br> NTR is for beta chuckfags  <br> not self inserting as megacock alpha senpai <br>Are you a faggot?</br></br></br>  <br>Well mostly what we've been seeing is the wife both passively and aggressively trying to get back at MC for making her get taken by another man (ie the title of the work). It might be fun to watch them go back and forth about trying to one-up each other by fucking the other over. We haven't really seen MC actually retaliate against his wife for what she's going along with (she has basically taken the reigns and is running the show now), but the coworker might present an opportunity for that. <br><br>You can't reload a previous save if that's what you're asking.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get self-inserting in general. It's MC's story, not mine.</br>  <br> trying this hard to cover for Shu <br>Christ, you people truly are cucks.<br><br>All parties have a responsibility in the current situation but MC is the biggest offender. The idea was his from the beginning, even if the wife is guilty of going with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shu instigated the whole ordeal <br><br>The wife was always a slut. she was easily willing to fuck other men. and it's obvious she wasn't over her first boyfriend.</br></br></br>  <br>It's hilarious that their first unconscious thought is to self insert into the pathetic beta wanting to get his girl fucked by other guys. That probably ties in to why they lash out at people who don't have that problem.</br>  <br>Mindbreak/corruption is boring as fuck. Let's take something that resembles a character and turn it into mindless cock-hungry slut #24965, I'm sure that will be interesting.</br>  <br><br><br>The comment so nice, he posted it twice!</br></br></br>  <br>But NTR is the same thing just with a focus on other penises.</br>  <br>The H-anime of this looks awful<br><br>http://www.getchu.com/soft.phtml?id<wbr>=857429</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> It's hilarious that their first unconscious thought is to self insert into the pathetic beta wanting to get his girl fucked by other guys <br>They even go as far as defend them.</br></br>  Betafag trying this hard<br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>The cover is pretty sweet though.</br>  <br>Shit NTR gets a shit H-anime. color me surprised</br>  <br>I want out of Sweden.</br>  <br> more 'animation' <br><br>Trash, etc</br></br></br>  When is this riding going to end?  <br><br><br>Worse than the frogs?</br></br></br>  <br>She still loved her husband though. Even if Haruka was susceptible to the temptations of infidelity, as when she fantasized about the delivery guy (though only after Shu brought up the initial idea) and got wet as fuck with the first guy (that was mostly on her, but it's not like the aforementioned circumstances didn't influence that too), it's on Shu for creating the opportunity and coercing those circumstances on her. <br>Even looking at when she first, at great reluctance, decided to go along with Shu's idea of fucking that first guy, she confronted Shu expecting him to meet her challenge, but when he failed that a part of her spirit broke. She can only handle so much before she caves. The cut and dry is Shu has problems and Haruka can't deal with them. Whether one wishes to interpret it as Shu's problems just being too much for anyone to handle or as Haruka being one who isn't a very helpful person, whoever one finds more fault in comes down to opinion.</br></br>  <br>Never anon, is like Mr. Bones' Wild Ride.<br>The ride never ends.</br></br>  <br>Jesus christ what?<br>I'm not sure if it's me or the rest of the world, but something is fucking crazy.</br></br>  <br>When the relationship is ruined for good.</br>  <br>I'm not very into French politics but it's horrible.</br>  <br>I, what?<br>Why?</br></br>  <br>Is this a bait image?</br>  <br>This is the future anon, you cannot stop it.</br>  <br>Stop the planet, I want to get off.</br>    How come people are hating on Senpai calling him Chad? He's a much better person than MC.<br><br>How can anyone whatsoever self-insert as MC is beyond me.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Because he thinks he's hot shit and the wife doesn't give two shits about him and is only thinking about MC. His despair is delicious.</br></br></br>  <br>Blame /r9k/.</br>  <br> How can anyone whatsoever self-insert as MC is beyond me <br>I'm starting to understand why harem MC are such insipid faggots. Sounds like it is very needed for a good deal of the audience.</br></br>  Where to read ?  <br>I'd recommend a library.</br>  <br> http://g.e-hentai.org/g/604335/9b8<wbr>763b72b/</wbr> <br>How do you find this stuff on panda? Is there a double secret club I'm not aware of? Please help a fellow anon out.</br></br>  <br>he couldn't control it though, that's the only way he could ejaculate, and his parents were pressuring him into getting a kid while his sex life was near zero cuz of it.</br>  <br>male:netorare</br>  <br> Senpai calling him Chad? <br><br>He is tho... Big dick about 2-foot taller then MC, Ripped. AKA(meat dildo). <br><br>Chad is Chad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, his character is probably the greatest tragedy of this story so far. He is Mr. Perfect, but he's been burdened with the baggage of Shu and Haruka's fucked up relationship. Just look at  and  where he starts to become aware of what he's gotten himself into. That's not to mention that he had already lost Haruka once in the first place when they were in highschool, though even if that didn't really affect him that much it must have been a huge blow to him to see what kind of guy he had lost her to.</br>  <br>People looking for sanity in this story should have left long ago.<br><br>It's like they don't understand what this whole thing is about or try to accomplish.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, but I meant galleries you can't normally search for like the one linked. It doesn't show for me, expunged or otherwise.</br>  <br>You can't. Not even on Ex. Sometimes you get lucky on a google search and find an old version that hasn't been taken down. Such as link related.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/729693/7c8e8c<wbr>9a32/</wbr></br></br></br>  http://g.e-hentai.org/s/1e64e0ab59/<wbr>604335-19<br><br>This has 38 pages <br><br>And is 10x better then this NTR.<br><br>Cum buckets</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>And what is trying to accomplish?</br>  <br>I just read through this, didn't even get hard.<br>You're entitled to your opinion though.</br></br>  <br>Tell a story about a fucked up couple's slow self destruction and journey into despair.</br>  <br> http://exhentai.org/g/729693/7c8e8<wbr>c9a32/</wbr> <br>Aw, that's too bad, thanks a million anyways anon.</br></br>  <br>I could be wrong though. But some galleries such as the one I posted has<br><br>Visible: No (Deleted)<br>So there are still some galleries out there you can view. Don't take my word for it, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chad also doesn't give a shit about the girl and just wants to use her.<br><br>The guy in the manga though legitimately cares for the girl.</br></br></br>  <br> Chad also doesn't give a shit about the girl  <br>You're so wrong.</br></br>  I hope this ends with all of them dead.  <br>Gotcha. Thanks again.</br>  <br>Then why is Chad hated?</br>  <br>Because most faggots who read this have more in common with the BETA MC than the Alpha.</br>  <br>see</br>  <br>That's a loaded question.</br>  <br>No one will die.</br>  <br>More NTR doujins need to end with the cuck snapping and pulling a gruesome massacre on fucking everyone</br>  <br> Our university lecturers told us to <br>That's absolute bullsh-<br> They're French <br>Figures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Found the cuck.</br>  <br>Found the leddit user.</br>  <br> netori or ntr are both about the other men and the women is just a tool . <br>I had been thinking this while I was last reading it. I don't want to go full fujoshit with the undertones but the MC has some pretty homoerotic fixations. His basic desire is to bring other men into his sex life, via his wife. There was also that stuff about "the stench of another man", and when she fucked that one douchebag, MC's face was right up in their genitals kissing that shit, and there was a dick there. He's trying to derive sexual pleasure from other men vicariously through his wife. Maybe it can be viewed as him just wanting to see his wife be slutty, but I think there's evidence against that:: he wanted to see his wife be "bashful or appearing unwilling" when with other men, basically opposite of a slut; his fixation not on how good she felt, but on how good the other man made her feel (eg the train). That last bit, in my opinion, is the core of his fetish.<br>We also see him blushing like a schoolgirl all the fucking time as seen in  and elsewhere, so much so that it's a running joke here. It's either just a maelstrom of complicated emotions short-circuiting his face, or he's reacting to his repressed desire to be a woman poking its head out when it gets the chance. Trap end dark horse possibly confirmed.</br></br></br>  <br>You're putting more thought into the "story" than the fucking author.<br><br>Also, I can't imagine how STD ridden they both are.</br></br></br>   tfw only ever get semi from anything other than NTR <br> tfw can only actually cum from NTR <br><br>fug</br></br></br>  Is there even any reason to keep this shit going on for so long? Jesus Christ, just get done with it and write new NTR story already.   NTR is a nip government funded genre so that their young male population will stop being betas   I loved Ayamachi Hajimameshite but this new manga of his is garbage, and I usually like NTR stories.  In the new chapter<br><br> First love is getting emotionally ntr'd <br> Divorce paper?  <br>Who put them there tho? It's going to end as a three-way suicide.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wife will be the first to go. when she finds out he can fuck another women without the NTR shit.</br>  It's like you nigger didn't read Gatenkei.   NTR series <br> turns into some weird psycho bullshit where three people are probably going to commit suicide <br>chad didnt deserve this</br></br>  <br> successfully preventing the younger generation from populating </br>  <br>he has had many chances to eject, he deserves to see the ride to the end.</br>  Iwas thinking Senpai is enjoying this but it seems that he actually is starting to fucking realize that both of them are mentally ill.<br><br>He is just a normalfag who is in love with her.<br><br>She is some kind of twisted demon that both loves and hates her husband and wants him to stay while wants him to cry.<br><br>He is just....ayyy lmaoga Lv99.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chad's fault for tagging along for the ride.</br>  <br>I wonder if she really will snap the next chapter?</br>  ppl actually care about this NTR "story"...  <br>And the thing is, I don't think either one of them would have gone down this path had they been with anyone else. It's a perfect storm, like they were meant for each other.</br>  MC will fuck the coworker and realize the problem lied with his wife,not NTR.<br><br>He will come home and proclaim he is done and wants divorce.<br><br>Senpai will go "See?You are free now!" But this is only the beginning of the ride.<br><br>Wife will go full mental yandere.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Netorare is a genre where the intent is to cause an emotion of deep jealousy or distress in the reader <br>Says who?</br></br>  <br>This actually could've been a really good story IF it was more fleshed out and from the Chad's perspective.<br><br>Tried his best his whole life, he got his girlfriend stolen and en he got himself into abyss of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Netorare is a genre where the intent is to cause an emotion of deep jealousy or distress in the reader. A direct translation of the word results in the definition "having your lover taken from you" or "to have something taken from you while you sleep". This is often accomplished by having main protagonist's loved one seduced away from them, with or without their knowledge.<br><br>AKA Beta chuck shit</br></br></br>  <br>I know I could just read the manga but why did she married the MC? From skimming through some pages I though the senpai and Haruka were dating in high school?</br>  <br>MC was not always a beta chuck. he saved her more then 1 time. Plus the good old childhood friend stick</br>  <br> ppl <br> ... <br>This NTR "story" doesn't wanna have anything to do with you either, you fucking tool.</br></br></br>  <br>what are you ?! if not a ppl ? anon ? no... I don't play into that shit.</br>  <br> intent is to cause an emotion of deep jealousy or distress in the reader <br>Not necessarily. The only thing that's intended is for the girl to be taken by a guy that's not her current significant other. How the author wants the reader to maybe feel about the work is completely secondary to that.</br></br>  <br> Netorare is a genre where the intent is to cause an emotion of deep jealousy or distress in the reader. <br>then what's the authors intent, to bully the reader or is he equally masochistic?<br>Your making a universal claim that NTR must and has to be this. <br>You'll find that stories point of view and sentiment vary.</br></br></br></br>  Jesus Christ, this stupid thread.<br><br>You're all insufferable faggots.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for taking the time to reply in a thread you don't like, and letting us know about your opinion.</br>   Go into an NTR thread <br> No one brings up netori <br> Everyone inserts as the man cucking mc <br> No one brings up Netori <br> Everyone is a Literature major <br> Everyone beta for not agreeing NTR is good <br>I heard theres one more volume after this, is that true?</br></br></br></br></br></br>   no type 1/type 2 ntr with MC say fuck it, break up and move on with Life   Can that hack shikishiro finish it all already? We all know where this will end anyway. MC's gonna be a cuckold forever and Haruka will end up with senpai  <br>You are a dumbass if you think anyone self-inserts as the MC theres a clear line between self-inserting and pitying the MC.</br>  <br> pitying beta MC <br> pitying piece of shit </br></br>  <br>Yeah what an upstanding man he is fucking the wife of another man behind his back before he even knew about the ntr fetish.</br>  <br>I'm sure you're a 6'4 10/10 Harvard graduate who fucks a hundred bitches a day and doesn't let anybody screw with him, right?</br>  <br>The MC of Hime Kishi Tame wasnt beta at all and went to rescue his girl and still got his shit pushed in.</br>   NTR threads <br> always guarantee 500+ reply <br>Never change, /a/</br></br>  <br>Orcs mind control OP.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128067837 <br>Found the crossborder.</br>  Didnt his previous story end up with everyone coming separate ways ? <br><br> Also why no fucking translate on that </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I fap to doujins and I've never ever continued reading the story.<br><br>Most of the times I don't even read the pages.

It's actually worse like this.</br>  <br> we <br>who the fuck is "we"? Its just you bitching every fucking night about it nigger</br></br>  <br>They are back to the zero budget and the stick body drawing, for a photoshoot.<br>I wasn't expecting more, but saying I should be grateful for that is quite something.</br></br>  <br><br>Are you saying stick body isn't sexy as fuck?</br></br>  I'm not a huge fan of Rin but I can respect her thighs  <br>I'm saying they should put a minimal effort into drawing them, but apparently it will never happen to Dekoration.<br>I don't even know whether it is because Rika and Miria are lolis, or they overdesigned the clothes and can't draw the girls decently with them on.</br></br>  <br> the stick body drawing <br>The girl has pretty much the same body proportions as Chihaya, what did you expect?<br>Xebec's artistic license?</br></br></br>  <br>They put minimal effort in everything apart from episode 1, the end of 3 and arguably 8, you can't just say it was only Dekoration that got cut.</br>  <br>There are many better thighdols than Rin.</br>  <br>It only makes it funnier that Mika's bust size is only 80, which is pretty much below average in the clusterfuck that is CG.</br>  Gonna put a ring on that trailer trash  <br>At least the BDs seem to fix things.</br>  <br><br>Did somebody say thighs?</br></br>  <br>You know what I mean, and it's not her being flat, though no, her proportions aren't on Chihaya level.<br><br><br><br>They sure put a lot of effort into making Mika look sexy in her photoshoot, or drawing Miku's asses, or giving nice midriffs to Miku and Riina.<br>I don't think I will forgive this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sans-nekomimi Miku is so ridiculously attractive it's not even funny</br>  Which idol's body do you like best?  <br><br>None of the Cinderella Girls even come close, unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>Miku's body is real fine.<br><br><br>Looking at the episodes again I'm really confused by your standards, Mika's photoshoot scene in episode 2 fit the same level of quality throughout the entire episode which isn't impressive, and I can't say much about Miku and Riina since A-1 got their shit together in that episode only to lose it by episode 13.</br></br></br></br>  <br> her proportions aren't on Chihaya level. <br> Chihaya: 72/55/78 <br> Rika: 72/54/75 <br>Even Miria is curvier than the two of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This shit needs to fucking holy shit I'm so fucking mad<br>when did this shit start? 2? 3? years ago<br>fucking butt flaps man.<br>I'm fucking mad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Miku doesn't look as good as Maya in that uniform.</br></br>  <br>Miku is basically a less angry Maya</br>  <br>Rika has a 72 bust size for a much shorter body, and Chihaya has broader shoulders too.<br>Not the same proportions. But that's not what I'm saying either ways.</br></br>  <br>What's your CG favorite, then?</br>  <br><br>But she isn't as scary and doesn't have a cute as fuck sister.</br></br>  <br> butt flaps <br>are you fucking insane mate?</br></br>  <br><br>Look at that fucking picture and tell me it looks normal.</br></br>  <br> Maya k2 <br> Scary <br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because she is wearing slutty underwear that doesn't keep her ass in place.</br>  <br> doesn't have a cute as fuck sister. <br>You don't know that<br>She keeps her private life and her work life separate, nya<br><br>ENGLISH?!? cant?<br>how can you fucking</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>shit needs to stop*<br><br><br><br>can you see ass cheeks looking at a girl front on?<br>no you can't<br><br>this shit started like 2 or 3 years ago man.<br>I think I'm going insane, like I'm the only one that noticed</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anya is the cutest and sweetest!  <br><br>Preach it</br></br>  <br><br>Ok she isn't as scary when she's K2, but she is definitely cuter than Miku.</br></br>  <br>Anya's animal motif is a cat too, that chain was unnecessary.</br>  <br>Shes wearing a miniskirt, probably wearing slutty underwear that goes all the way up her crack of course her cheeks are gonna stick out.</br>   yurifags will defend this   <br>That's a wolf though<br><br>Was this done by the Saekano mangaka? It looks really similar for some reason</br></br></br>  Who is the most famous 346 idol in the CG universe?    <br>Yes it is.<br><br><br>Probably Kaede and her unit, considering 346 has merchandise of them everywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I fell in love with her after the first drama track.<br>Her drunken antics in cool jewelries only cemented her status as my number one.</br></br>  <br>that's a boat though</br>  <br>Where's my Ayane Sakura idol in im@s, Scamco?</br>  <br>346Pro is a hueg company, if anything I'd say Kaede, KWSM, Mayu, Miho, Mika, Akane, Koume, Sachiko and Airi seem to be the Flagship Idols, but there's many many more established (voiced, non-voiced cameo) idols other than the main 14 of the Cinderella Project girls.</br>  <br><br> boat <br><br>Are you also implying Naka-chang can't be an idol?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But that's canon. It happened in the anime.</br>  <br><br>Who should she voice?</br></br>    <br> Ayane Sakura <br>She's got too much under her name, they already have enough A-list VA with Kaede, Ranko and Anya</br></br>  <br>her and KWSM's stint in the Majiawas made me a H@gfag</br>  <br>How do you put Kaede VA in same level with Ranko and Anya, both of them and Ayane Sakura are still new</br>  <br> not posting the best couple <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br><br>Chihaya can't be gay. She's already my wife.</br></br>  <br><br>You both failed to post the best OTP.</br></br>  <br>Not saying it like they're on the same level, but Maaya Uchida and Sumire Uesaka are getting big really fast, and they already had a big lead ahead of the others bar Hayamin</br>  <br><br>They have literally nothing in common, though. The moon/ramen have nothing to do with wild animals.</br></br>  This should've been uploaded yesterday, but here you go.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!jRokGYoL!Jpsbn<wbr>tZXPy_Cob2VenLbNIai5TpY6gNP02hME19J<wbr>KRY</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Only a base, misguided fool would think these two aren't the best together.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with friendship.</br>  <br>B-but, Hibiki is better with Chihaya.</br>  How much do I have to pay Rin for her services?  <br>Thank you based Anon</br>  <br>With benefits.</br>  <br>Someone please dump.

Sure</br>  <br>Well the full version of saihyou is out if it makes you feel any better.<br><br><br>Best in a bad situation there, Uduki.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't particularly like Uzuki, but she's easily the best of those three because the other two are so immensely shitty.</br>  <br>Can't wait to destroy that smile etc etc.</br>  I don't want an Uzuki drama arc.<br><br>It'll be too sad. <br><br>What are potential scenarios?</br></br></br></br>  <br> hfw being called cute and sexy </br>  <br><br>Uzuki knows she has to go against Mika in idol/waifu battle, it is inevitable.</br></br>  Just a reminder that Makoto dated P twice<br><br>That is all</br></br>  <br>Makoto is a good girl.</br>  <br><br>It probably won't be that bad, at least she won't compete with 961</br></br>  How many Newtons?  <br>On another note, how many new tonnes did she gain since the first cour?</br>  <br> It probably won't be that bad <br>But this is worse. Kuroi is a cartoonish villain at best. And 961 is clearly portrayed as an "evil" and "enemy" corporation.<br><br>Meanwhile, this Stepmother that has been haunting the trailer is more or less implied to be an upper executive of 346. So if this "Stepmother" figure was to cause shit, it would be an internal conflict. And just imagine, Uzuki finally became a princess of the white castle, and now the queen of the castle is bullying her / asking her to fuck off. The trauma would be destroy her.<br><br>Fucking hell, the preview does not ease my worries. <br><br>- the arrival of the Stepmother is introduced as a stinger after the preview proper (a media technique almost exclusively used by villains)<br>- ominous silence with only the ticking clock<br>- the perpetually cheerful Chihiro sporting a worried face<br>- RAIN. FUCKING RAIN. Rain is the harbinger of doom and drama in im@s. And do you know what's worse? It's raining, AT NIGHT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Enough to make squeezing her more fun.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Threadly reminder that if you like Makoto you are, for all intents and purposes, a homosexual.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really see how this is only Uzuki drama it's foreshadowing and I don't really like it at all.<br><br>The anime was supposed to be about the Cinderella Project getting big, 14 girls who all want to become idols TOGETHER, and are then separated by episode 5 and given small amounts of development in favor of 7 episodes for Uzuki, Rin and Mio. Which all leads to a badly done and lackluster final performance where they just feel like a bunch of misfits tacked together under a single name compared to the Jibun Restart performance in the original anime. Hell the only friendships that were made outside of their units was Ranko with Anastasia and maybe with Minami too. The PV does indeed show some kind of drama shadow falling into the second cour, but I don't see how it won't involve the suffering of the entire project and just Mrs. Ganbarimasu.<br><br>Yes I'm fucking mad, they are all Cinderella, just because one fits the theme better doesn't mean they should get special treatment like the first time. Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody said that it's only Uzuki's drama. All the other girls will have their own issues to deal with and they'll get an episode for that. However the eponymous stepmother will probably have no hand with that. Given the setting it's bad to have one primary "villain" that will torment the others.<br><br>Kuroi was designated as the enemy and his wrath extended to the whole of 765. And admittedly, episodes he played in were actually the worst of the 2011 anime. (Hibiki and Takane episodes nvr4get)<br><br>It wouldn't make sense for an executive of 346 to annihilate one of their own major projects. She'd probably target one or two weak links in her efforts to "improve" it. And on the topic of weak links and bullying material, Uzuki is a prime target. There is also the matter of her being the main red (thus being contractually obligated to suffer alot) and the one befitting the classical cinderella archetype.<br><br>There is more than one kind of Cinderella Story nowadays. It's a thematic framing that has evolved over the years. Everybody is a Cinderella in their own ways, but for Uzuki's case, the classic way of telling it fits her best.<br><br><br> 7 episodes for Uzuki, Rin and Mio. <br><br>I'll give you episode 1, 3 and 6, but episode 2 and 4 were more or less for the project as a whole. Just because NG was the vehicle POV, doesn't mean it was about them. Episode 5 was also about the project but more on Miku's side. And episode 7 was primarily for Producer.<br><br> they just feel like a bunch of misfits tacked together under a single name  <br><br>Because they are. Unlike 765 who had plenty of time working together as idols even before Producer's arrival, the Cinderella Project is literally a bunch of people who don't know each other made to work as idols.<br><br>Jibun Restart is a celebration of the 765 girls finally reaching a breakthrough in their careers after working together for so long.<br><br>GOIN!! marks the first step and grand debut of the Cinderella Project as a united group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GOIN!! marks the first step and grand debut of the Cinderella Project as a united group. <br>You better stop comparing it to 765's performance, or I'll hit you.<br>This wasn't work together, they don't care about each other, they don't know each other, and this will evidently continue on the next cour.<br>So lifeless, so stiff, it's shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I was taking your seriously before but it looks like you are one of those purists who put 765 on a pedestal and immediately disregard anything else not 765 as absolute dysfunctional shit.<br><br>Clearly, you hate CG and any attempt to reason with you will fail. So for your own sake, just stop watching CG.</br></br></br>  <br>Most of 2 was about NG specifically Rin and Uzuki getting to know Mio, the other Project characters weren't even introduced until near the end where they get 1 line of their gimmick and it's back to NG being chosen for Mika's concert, 7 wasn't just about Producer too but also about Mio getting out of her funk and Rin getting over whatever the fuck she was sulking about. The others are really getting shafted here outside the lucky few.</br>  <br>Nah, I'm being reasonable. Cinderellas don't know each other and that's it, and they don't care about each other. They work in a cold giant company which doesn't invest in the girls.</br>  <br>This is why vehicle characters are always fucking shit, makes it even worse that they're the most boring of the lot.</br>  <br> but episode 2 and 4 were more or less for the project as a whole. Just because NG was the vehicle POV, doesn't mean it was about them. <br>Episode 2 kind of was, if it were about the Project then they would have been introduced far earlier than 12 minutes in, given more than a line each and would have spent more time showing more of their characters instead of Uzuki, Rin and Mio wasting time and fucking up a simple photoshoot.</br></br>  <br>You keep forgetting that the setting of both groups were drastically different. So your comparisons to 765 are misguided.<br><br>765 is an already established (but unpopular) agency who was already operating with its idols even before Producer's arrival. Naturally, they are already quite well acquainted with each other. And their Producer is an amiable (yet admittedly boring and unreliable) guy. So relationships in the group go rather smoothly.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Cinderella Project is a collection of whackjobs who don't know shit about each other. The foundations of this group are shaky at best and their distant Producer doesn't help at all. The whole first cour is about them warming up to each other.<br><br>Hell, the entire episode before the episode 13 performance is a training camp to grow their teamwork and feel for each other's tempos. And like anon <br> said, the GOIN!! performance is like their debut of finally accepting each other and being able to work as a group. <br><br>  friendships  <br>You act like 765 (in the anime) was depicted to be completely chummy with each other. More often than not, most of them stayed with their peer group.<br><br>In the first 13 episodes of 2011, have you seen Takane hang out with say, Yayoi or see Iori chum it up with Yukiho?<br><br>Naturally, working together for that long, it's assumed to be that they get along, but it's not like they have the time to explicitly depict the friendships with each other.<br><br>Even moreso for the Cinderella Project as they have only been together for a few months at best. Naturally, the first people they get accustomed with are the ones in their sub-units. Admittedly, the same closeness of 765 isn't to be expected yet due to the amount of time together. but it's stupid to assume that they aren't friends or they don't get along. There are plenty of incidental scenes showing them hanging out with each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Meanwhile, the Cinderella Project is a collection of whackjobs who don't know shit about each other. <br>That's my beef, we don't even know that for sure, they said a 3 episode introduction arc of the characters, but instead it's NG all the way through and leaves it to assumption that they were all acquainted with each other while NG was fucking around with the camera following them. The worst mistake was giving the anime vehicle characters.</br></br>  <br>Then I guess I'm a faggot.</br>  <br>gonna make that tomboy blush</br>  <br> they were all acquainted with each other <br><br>They're not.<br><br>Here is where knowledge of the mobage comes in. Most of the Project girls live in different parts of Japan. If you notice, upon starting idolhood, quite a few of them lived in a dorm provided by the agency. It's highly unlikely that were prior acquainted to each other before passing the Audition. Even for the Project idols who live in the Tokyo area (Kanako, Riina, Miria, Kirari and NG), it's still unlikely that they know each other.<br><br>Granted, upon passing the Cinderella Auditions, they might have been attending 346 ahead of time to get acquainted with fellow Audition passers. But this is probably just two or three weeks before NG's arrivals as the special snowflake passers. And that span of time isn't enough to classify the Project Girls as "well-acquainted".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All I ask is that the finale performance be a big group song with both the newbies and veterans.  <br>What if you're a girl and like Makoto?</br>  Soon.  <br><br>Sachiko doesn't have time for this.</br></br>  This is why I hate vehicular characters in stories full of many other potentially intricate characters, but we only learn about the select few vehicle ones. The anime did showcase too much of the NG characters, and that is a common concern for what may happen in the second cour. This, coupled with stupid shit about how the 2nd cour will put Uzuki in the limelight for drama purposes while leaving other characters in the shadows, really doesn't help make anyone else feel confident. It should at least be about the fourTEEN girls, not FOUR girls (NG+Mika), much less about only one.<br><br>So the next time you think to post that stupid copypasta about Uzuki doing an ultimate ganbarimasu to save the day, you better think about how you're pissing off everybody else who has a different taste in idol and is already upset over the 2nd cour's treatment of anyone that isn't NG. Fuck off with your stupid focusing on even just one character, and it's a fucking NG at that. Ganbarifuckyou.</br></br>  <br>I wanna squeeze her cheeks.</br>  <br>Holy shit anon.<br><br>Everybody is talking about Uzuki's arc because she is the Main Red. Whether you like it or not, she is THE heroine and primary representative of Cinderella Girls. Thus, she will accordingly get 2-3 episodes for her. <br><br>Did you fucking flip out when Haruka had her Drama arc in 2011 too? We had 2 episode of Haruka flipping out how 765 was losing its Danketsu and 1 entire episode of Haruka hallucinating and getting healing. That's a whole 3 episodes for Haruka's development. (Not to mention the idolmaster movie was basically HARUKA: The Movie)<br><br>And of course, it's not like it was all Haruka either. Haruka's arc showed the growth of the other idols. But the primary focus was still on her.<br><br>It would basically be the same for Uzuki. She would be the star of that arc, but its not like the other idols will fall to the backseat.<br><br>Besides, you got to learn to accept that an equal representation for an im@s anime that pleases all fans is just impossible. In 2011, alot of girls still got shafted in the most horrible of ways. Nobody likes talking about the Hibiki episode for example, and while amazingly fun, Azusa's episode didn't do much for her character other than establishing that she is an "ARA ARA, I'M SO DITZY" character. Of which most viewers probably already figured out by episode one. Asking for a perfect im@s anime is tantamount to asking for a perfect Touhou or Kancolle anime with equal representation: a goddamn pipe dream.<br><br>Certain characters will end up taking more spotlight. Deal with it.<br><br> I eagerly await the Million Live anime and watch you flip out as Mirai gets the spotlight rather than whoever your favorite ML is. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't compare 2011 Im@s's shafting to Cinderella Girls' "we don't care about half of the girls" crap.</br>  I want to kill her  <br> Blah blah Uzuki heroine <br>Fuck off.<br><br> Blah blah Haruka <br>People didn't like certain characters getting shafted in the 2011 anime either. Don't bring that up as an example to follow you fucking idiot.<br><br>You're just a biased Uzukifag.<br><br> equal representation for an im@s anime that pleases all fans is just impossible. <br>Again, stop using the 2011 anime as an example to follow. It's not. It is possible, it is just lazy and biased storytelling. All you have done so far is said "well, that's what the 2011 anime did!!!" and that's ignorant as fuck.<br><br>Also,<br> ML <br>Nobody cares. Go back to /@/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Again, you're being blinded by whatever stick you have up your ass. Both series are plenty guilty of alot of things. I honestly love both series, but I acknowledge their failings. But the basis of your hate is on some serious irrational bias.<br><br>Either way, there is no real reason to compare the two. It's a case of apples and oranges here. But whatever, assuming you are the same guy as the above posts with the same sentiments, there is obviously no convincing whatever irrational hatred you have. If you want to have the last word, feel free to reply to this post with a "Whatever you deluded CG fag! CG is shit and doesn't care about its characters! DURR" or something to that effect. If it makes you feel better. It's okay, I'll let you have it.<br><br>Meanwhile, if you want something else to asspain about, have this:<br><br>http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/1<wbr>4/the-idolmaster-re-arcade-announce<wbr>d-for-smartphone/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We're shoving the Main Reds in your face whether you like it or not. <br> Love, Scamco. </br></br>  <br>Sure sure, you flaming faggot.</br>  <br>CG cares about its characters, but only those who are not Chieri, Kanako, Anzu, Rika or Miria.<br>That's a fact. Im@s 2011 never gave that shit to anyone, not even Ritsuko or Hibiki or Yukiho.</br></br>  <br>Wow, what a cutie!</br>  <br> CG cares about its characters, but only those who are not nonmembers of NG <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> Fuck off. <br><br>Can't deal with the fact that the starring girls of their respective franchise are Haruka, Uzuki and Mirai?<br><br>That's okay. Scamco will keep forcing them in your face until you like them. <br><br><br> Ritsuko <br><br>Hey, QUALITY aside, Ritsuko's episode was one of the best of 2011.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CG only cares about Rin, Uzuki and Mio.<br>The rest is upto which fanbase has the bigger wallet</br></br>  <br>Candy Island episode was good too, but they are still stuck at "who is that girl again" after their episode.</br>  <br>No shit? That's what I have been expressing. I'm clearly protesting the bias. What are you going to point out next, water is wet?</br>  <br> CG only cares about Rin and Uzuki <br><br>FTFY<br><br>If they loved Mio so much, she would've been part of the Absolute Nine CD. Thankfully, they were in the right mind to put in a far superior girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because sukebanfags managed to team up for once to take down the evil quitter, so it was the fans' doing.</br>  <br><br>Takumi is so lewd</br></br>  The fuck is up with all the adult idols? They shouldn't be on the stage and jumping for fucks sake.  Daily reminder Kikuchi Makoto belongs to me.  <br>Oops forgot my name.</br>  <br><br>Literally who.<br><br>Filtered.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not if I filter you first.</br>  <br> http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/<wbr>14/the-idolmaster-re-arcade-announc<wbr>ed-for-smartphone/</wbr></wbr> <br><br>Son, that's a fake.<br><br><br> blah blah bias. <br><br>Whatever entry in an im@s franchise, there will always be a "main" idol that will star the flagship media forgoing. That's just how it is. It's not like they eat up every other media. There are plenty of 765 or CG manga/games that DOESN'T star Haruka or Uzuki. It's just that for a big project like an anime, the designated Leaders/Mascots will get priority spotlight. Thats just how shit rolls. You act like the Reds ruin anything they touch.<br><br>Touhou has a fuck huge cast with massively popular characters, and yet Reimu (and to a lesser extent, Marisa) always ends up taking the lead. Don't tell me you get mad as fuck at that too?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They can only rig so much, and Takumi got her place for ranking in an election which is determined by money, taking my last point into account</br>  <br>Actually, we didn't quite get much Uzuki for being a red leader.<br>I hope we'll be getting a bit more of her.</br></br>  <br>Most of Uzuki's screentime in the first cour was actually concentrated on episode 1. We see her making a side comment one or two times per episode but that's about it.<br><br>Then again, Haruka didn't really start making her presence more defined until the latter half of the 2011 anime either. <br><br>So we're about par for course here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is anyone bringing up Touhou here? Touhou != Idols. Am I in /jp/ or some shit?</br>  I really don't care who gets cour focus, I just want a stargazing episode with Anya, where Producer finally mans up and calls her by her nickname instead of just "Anastasia-san"  <br> Don't tell me you get mad as fuck at that too? <br>...What? I couldn't care less about 2hu. Fuck off.<br><br>You seem to fail to make the distinction that yes, I understand how things are, and what I want things to be like. The former is exactly why I'm flipping my shit, and that's exactly what I have been expressing this whole time.<br><br>Do you need a rocket scientist's help to figure things like that out?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mans up and calls her by her nickname <br>That would just be awkward and slightly out of character for TakeP. You as Producer on the other hand is a different story, but that's an in-game thing, we're talking about the anime here. If TakeP does something weird of him like when he tried to talk informally last time, I'm just gonna keep making this facial reaction.</br></br>  <br> http://www.siliconera.com/2015/07/<wbr>14/the-idolmaster-re-arcade-announc<wbr>ed-for-smartphone/</wbr></wbr> <br>http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/82<wbr>54829.html<br> LOL </br></wbr></br></br>  <br> that's exactly what I have been expressing this whole time. <br><br>And I've been reiterating the futility of whatever frustrations you have the whole time. Nothing wrong with being mad at things you don't like, but I'm just reiterating facts. The im@s leading characters are here to stay in the spotlight. Especially if it's something big like an anime.<br><br>What I'm focusing on here is you flipping out. You act like the presence of Reds ruin everything there in the franchise but that's hardly the case. There is still plenty of shit to do and enjoy in im@s, Reds aside. Plenty of official media that deals with the other characters. It's not like all CDs have Haruka or Uzuki in them.<br><br>Hell, I'm not even scratching the surface of the fan community.<br><br>Again at risk of using an analogy that you'll probably also dismiss as irrelevant; It's like you're getting mad at Mickey being the lead mascot of Disney, sure he fucking pops out alot whether you like it or not, but it's not like everything else Disney is dominated by Mickey's character.<br><br>You're letting one minor annoyance get the best of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the closest I'll ever see to TakeP bonding with Anya anyway, she had so much exposure but no focus that I'm starting to doubt if A-1 will bother with her anymore</br>  <br> It's like you're getting mad at Mickey being the lead mascot of Disney <br>There's a difference between being a franchise of a company called Idolm@ster and not Uzukim@ster or Redm@ster and then having a promotional recognizable mascot that just gets his own features that usually have his own name in the title. If we were talking about Disney releasing Disneym@ster and then having it be all about Mickey, this would be a different story, if I even gave a shit about Disney in the first place, but I don't.<br><br>This is Idolm@ster, not NGm@ster, Redm@ster, Uzukim@ster, or whathaveyou. And when it comes to promotional material like magazine covers and the like, sure, go ahead and put the postergirls on there, but when it's an anime series where we should be seeing more of the rest of them, it gets to be irritating when the ones others probably like are barely there. Granted, imagine those who don't even have a voiced idol feel, but NG shouldn't need to be shoved in there in the STORY when it's not necessary. Hell, instead of NG being in the audience of the CI episode, why couldn't Kirari be there at least for Anzu? That would have made more sense, even. Instead we get Mio trying to make some kind of dumb analysis which almost comes off as pointing out the obvious and Rin just kind of sitting there and Uzuki being ganbarimasu as usual.<br><br>I'm going to complain and protest no matter what until I see a change in results, and it will never subside just because someone tries to rationalize it as "that's just how it is, deal with it" and even the last part of that sentiment only serves to motivate me even more to complain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While I do agree NG whoring is the worst, Uzuki isn't as whored out as Rin, she has been put in pretty much every group album scamco can put her in and uses her for literally every event that goes on both ingame and out.</br>  <br>Wait, you're still talking about Uzuki?<br><br>Fuck. I'm talking about Reds and im@s mascots in general.<br><br>But for the record, Uzuki has been snubbed for most part in the first cour you know? Likewise, just with Haruka, she will get a dedicated arc for her.<br><br>Hope to see you madpost every thread from this week onwards then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, in all fairness, Uzuki did take a bit of a backseat in cour one, but I'm speaking in general that NO character should be spotlighted more than others, or at least if they are, there should be an epsilon of difference. I see that Uzuki saves the day copypasta and it just irritates me that that would probably be the attitude that A-1 actually has and it would totally make my idol, as well as other peoples' idols, just be girls only standing around saying things ike "Where's Uzuki?" and strip them of their personality otherwise or just leaving them to being simple one note characters.</br>  <br>For the record, I'm speaking about this shit below:<br><br> TakeP gets sent out by StepmotherP to menial jobs for other well established 346 idols while she manages the CG's <br> Rin gets TP hijacked, MioHondaTime gets Positive Passion'd <br> Dookie's Gambarimasu levels are dangerously low, goes into silent Despair(TM), main red drama event horizon established <br> Cakes and New Voices contact the remaining CG's wondering about sexymofo TakeP since they haven't seen him since he last supported them at a recent event (cue PreppyP, RockYouP, KimonoP, SportyP, BanchouP, HagswarmProtectionP, GlowstickRaveP, GroomP, etc collage) <br> the lost/runaway Cinderellas re-appear (faces not shown) and apologize to TakeP, also telling them about StepmotherP "brainwashing them" away from him because he was such a newbie back then <br> Chihiro calls him back into the office, tells him about the mising Gambarimonster and other recent StepmotherP shenanigans <br> Egao goes over 9000, Super EgaoJin God TakeP is born thanks to the remaining CG's and takes the glass slipper to Dookie to prep her for end of season live <br> Awakened Dookie saves the CG's concert in episode 24 with S(mile)ING </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I never liked it either, another drama ensues because of NG doing shit again, at least Chihaya's problem was linked to Takane to an extent.</br>  <br>You really are focusing too much on NG here and making every incidental appearance of them as a complaint.<br><br>In Ranko's episode, other than Mio's suggestion at the start of the episode, they were mostly background characters. It was Rin who gave TakeP the push, but it was Miku and Kanako who gave the right method to TakeP to get through to Ranko<br><br>NG being in CI's episode was strange so I'll give you that.<br><br>Dekoration's episode was mostly them and Mika. Mio was non-existent and Uzuki and Rin had one or two lines, but the same could be said for any other Non-Deko idol who happened to appear that episode.<br><br>And Asterisk episode was also mostly them, sure NG had one or two lines that episode but just like with the Deko episode, the same can be said for any of the other idols.<br><br>And the big training camp episode, it was focused on them as a whole, most of them getting more focus than NG.<br><br>I won't deny that NG is framed as the main group in the story, but you seem to have a filter in your eyes that make you furious everytime a NG girl appears on screen to the point that you rationalize as THEY ARE FORCING THEM TOO MUCH FUCK.<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128041742#p128068770">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I know I can't wait for second cour for my lovely living dead girl.  <br>Oh this.<br><br>This was a joke anon.

I really would have liked a severa one.<br><br>Hopefully we get an Elise one for Fates, she seems to be super popular and god is she cute.</br></br></br>  <br> My gf really likes her for some reason <br>Your 3DPD gf is a landwhale and Pochaco is an idealized fatty so she wants to believe her body looks like that instead of a lumpy mess. Right?</br></br>  <br> 15k <br>Maybe if she goes on amazon jp for lower like Tharja after release.</br></br>  <br>Stop typing like an retard.</br>  <br>Rip<br>In<br>Puke</br></br></br>    <br>Yeah the Alter one is just a bit bland and the tippy-toe pose is silly. FREEing captured a much nicer feeling with theirs.</br>  <br>They are really cute.

She looks really disgusting and man like in person.</br>  <br>sounds about right for a tranny</br>  <br> Her </br>  <br>The jaw kills it.</br>  <br>I don't know why Koto keeps making Cu-poche because they don't seem to sell very well.</br>   Cordelia, Poison and Yui are up for preorders at the same time <br>Why must you do this to my wallet?</br>  <br>I'm not going to preorder it but I'll buy it once it's released on Amazon since all the ones from that series has always eventually been released for under retail there. Her smile looks kind of weird at some angles though.</br>  <br>Cordelia is one year away. You have more than enough time to save some money.</br>  <br>Trying to hold off til after Wonfes. <br>I'm really hoping to see swordshit scales of more fluid CGs rather than their standard poses.</br></br>  <br>Cant wait for best idol</br>  <br>she's only 6,640Y I'll doubt she'll be lower than that.</br>  <br> Not a faggot <br> Has SAO <br> Not even Suguha <br>That's not how it works</br></br></br></br>  <br>In order to get this i would have to assign a proxy to go wonfes to buy it for me right? Can anyone suggest me one who does this reliably?</br>  <br> SAO <br> SnK <br> I'm not a fag guys </br></br></br>  <br>I will when I get home from work and then tonight I'll probably jerk off to a Poison x Chun-li doujin. Either the G-panda one or the Rebis one.</br>  <br> reliably <br>None. It'd cost an arm and a leg anyway, and it wouldn't be guaranteed since the white version is limited to 300 pieces.</br></br>  <br>Just cancelled an AmiAmi order for the first time. I now have nothing to look forward to, no preorderes at all.<br><br>Well, at least wonfes is just 'round the corner.</br></br></br>  <br>They nailed the tranny look.</br>  look at that stomach  <br>Preordered, if they announced a nendo, I'll preorder her too</br>  May be a weird question, but anything good to get off Amazon come the 15th?  Can someone please post the melted Sonico figure?  <br>It doesn't look that good anyway (And I'm a Selvaria's fan), don't waste your money.</br>    <br>it's on MFC, now fuck off.</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense in this situation</br>  <br><br>??<br><br>I have a friend who is obsessed with that trash and he would be greatly amused by it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just go to the /jp/ catalog</br>  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/yourblog/<br>Can't believe there's still retards who can't figure out .moe.</br></br>  <br>noodle suntan, no need to repost that here for the _th time</br>    <br><br><br>I have no fucking idea what you guys are talking about.

Fucking tired of seeing how you autists can derail a thread for 10-20 post when someone ask a question you don't feel like answering. Way more fucking annoying than just giving the answer right away and be over with it.</br></br>    <br>I have a few.</br>  <br>Can you fuck off now?</br>  <br><br>That's a man, isn't it?</br></br>  <br>I have the entire G4U set of iM@S, if that helps.</br>  <br>I bought Cammy, Chun Li, and Juri for $50, $53, and $60 and free 2day shipping since I've got a prime account. All the Bishoujo figures seems to be around there after a few weeks when they're released.</br>  <br>Nice attitude you have there, IDK why I even posted the link, I guess you anons were right about spoonfeeding.</br>  <br><br>Looks like Yayoi found a new soul to devour</br></br>  pls be at wonfes  <br> kyousougiga <br>My nigga</br></br>  <br>5,6K it's pretty close to 6,6K</br>    <br>No shit retard.</br>  <br>pls be in london</br>  <br>That's my GF, cute isn't she?</br>  <br>The Momohime figure looks kind of underwhelming.</br>  <br>Honestly you're not gonna convince me with a pretty close number.

Those are such halcyon days...</br>   go to anime expo <br> aniplex is selling akuma homura figma <br> not a huge buyfag/figure enthusiast so I didn't know it was extremely limited <br> buy satsuki nendoroid for a good price instead <br> find out akuma homura figma is pretty exclusive and goes for double the price online <br><br>just shoot me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's see your room</br>  <br>bait</br>    <br>Let's see Paul Allen's room.</br>  <br>Great story. It reminds me that I should open up the box that Akuma Homura came in so that I can see what she looks like in her box.</br>  <br>That hair still bugs me. Why didn't they use light bluish white instead of that ugly gray.</br>  <br><br>same<br><br><br><br>e-enjoy it anon</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>even blonde would look better</br>    Anyone else got a release date notification for Medicchu Kaga?  <br>I bet he doesn't have a single scale or even a Nendo. Disgusting.</br>  <br>You picked well.</br>  Amazon.com and JP suddenly stopped charging a deposit fee if you live in Mexico does this has anything to do with the fact that they opened an Amazon.com.mx some weeks ago? <br><br> inb4 google <br><br>Haven't found anything, and I know there's some anons here from Mexico.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Having seen and held one, it's a fair bit bigger than regular figmas. My Homura figma only goes up to his elbows or some shit.<br><br>So the higher price didn't exactly come out of nowhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminds me of the pic of the Asuka dubbed voice actress from nge</br>  <br>I crossed the border just yesterday, sorry can't help you bud</br>  <br> figmas </br>  <br>That looks fucking disgusting. Consider getting better taste anon.</br>  I don't want to read this abortion of a thread that was ruined from post 1. <br><br>Somebody tell me when it comes out.</br></br>  <br> B-Be safe anon </br>  <br> autism </br>  <br><br>T-Thanks anon<br><br>I feel better now after venting thanks buyfag friends.</br></br></br></br>  Is anybody else planning to scalp her when she comes in?  <br><br>Not only that, but licenses for game characters are not as cheap as anime ones.</br></br>  I've got a sale lined up where the fag wants to pay $250 for her. But I'm not sure I want to sell it. I mean look at those thighs. Where her legs always that meaty?   hating on pochaco   Those fucking quads. Has she been working out?  Can we please have two buyfag threads from now on? One of them can be for the landwhales to shitpost in, and the other can be the normal buyfag thread where we talk about figures that do not canonically have diabetes.  <br>The spores on her legs ruin it for me.</br>    <br>Get rekt faggot</br>  <br> tfw no chinbotsu fig </br>  <br>Why don't you go to Reddit so you can downvote everything you don't like?</br>  <br>All K-ON characters have meaty thighs. I'm not sure how you missed this. Azusa probably has the smallest though.</br>  <br> Baiting this hard </br>  <br><br>Camilla will probably get a figure first among the Fates cast.</br></br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck are you idiots doing? Stop giving her attention.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigga that gif is kawaii. btw MF fullamor Nagato when?</br>  <br>I hope somebody melts pochaco</br>  <br>They'll need an industrial oven for that one.</br>  <br>El chapo?</br>  who Ougi here?  <br>Good guitarists never skip leg day.</br>  <br>Go ahead and make the other one then.</br>    <br> filename <br><br>Is it really?</br></br></br>    I actually want her now.  Alright, so this one is for the anon who wanted a picture of my newly installed Ikea 6 dollar spice racks. I just threw some shit on it to give you an idea of how big they are and how they look with an average scale figure. <br>They are a good size, really cheap and don't require any brackets, which can get pricey. Just two screws in the wall and you're good to go. <br>The safety bar is pretty nice in theory, especially if you live in an earthquake zone and are paranoid about that stuff, but it does obscure too much of smaller figures to make it a display option for them. <br> But good thing is that you don't have to install the rack with the safety bar, it is optional. I don't think I would recommend it for figs.</br></br></br>  <br> not buying the superior loli version </br>  <br>Can't wait for yami! Is their a set of this?</br>  Why is she not on the GSC shop. I was gonna put her with Harvest Miku and Raiden.  <br>Rotate the rack 180 degrees and remove the bar. I think it'll look better by totally not looking like a spice rack</br>  <br>  april 2016 </br>  <br>Eternally waiting.</br>  <br> Superior <br> Nothing to do with how Yami is <br> She is around 4-5 years old yet thanks to the scale being 1/6 she's as tall as the other TLR scales taking away the loli part of her <br> Only 1-2k anime dollars less than the other TLR scales despise being way below them in almost every regard <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You mean a set of pictures?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Anybody know the release date for this? To my understanding, it's just "July." Obviously, it's the 14th now, so it's going to be the latter half of the month, but has an exact release date been published?</br></br></br>  <br>I like the edges to the shelf honestly. Earthquake zone and all.<br>If I didn't want to use it as a nendo rack I would be keeping the front bar too.</br></br>  <br>that looks kind of terrible. as a grill, shouldn't you be better at decorating?</br>  <br>use mfc</br>  <br>MFC just says "July." <br><br>Fag.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes ma'am!</br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  Why do fujos feel the need to post here? They already have reddit and mfc, why can't they just leave this place alone ;_;  <br>No, not "exactly." There are frequently people who post here with information about the exact days of release of figures, so it's not unreasonable to query the community here for information not available elsewhere. Stop being a faggot. If you don't know the answer, then ignore the post and let other people answer.</br>  <br>ignore and don't reply to them.</br>  <br>Precisely.</br>  PVC never.  <br>I like it.</br>  <br><br>You know they're not good yet you're still trying to convince yourself they were worth it. They weren't. Get something better or don't put figures on them.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off lobakc</br>  <br>Hooray~</br>   dat hip:waist ratio <br> dat gap </br>  I don't like summer.  <br> hip:waist ratio <br>What? Hip and waist are literally synonyms.</br></br>  <br>I agree. I think they look fine with plants and other average household curios, but plastic figures don't look quite right. Maybe if the shelves were painted, since the bare wood and the figures clash as is.<br><br>But of course it would have been better to have bought proper shelves in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>You know, they were six bucks. If I didn't like them I would just toss them, not live with buyers remorse after stapling them to my walls. I don't know how you interpreted it exactly. <br><br>They work well in my space.</br></br></br>  <br>Please tell me you're just pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>Fuck off jellorific<br><br> being friends with the spic and the other retards </br></br></br>  <br>Explain the difference, if you really think there is one.</br>  <br>Because they can't leave after being conditioned to the elitism here. I can barely crossboard anywhere because other boards type like retards.</br>  <br>Google it. Knowledge is power.</br>  <br>http://www.lmgtfy.com/?q=waist+hip+<wbr>ratio</wbr></br>  <br>Protip: hip is below the waist</br>  <br>No, no they aren't.</br>  <br> I'm undercover. </br>  <br>This and the MGS2 Raiden Nendo.</br>  Just saw she was delayed, I hope the yui and rin figmas are delayed from sep to jan so my wallet can rest  <br>That's disgusting. Not only her weird proportions but the colors, outfit and pose too.</br>  <br><br>what the fuck</br></br>  <br>Everything about this is terrible.</br>  <br><br><br>shit taste</br></br></br>  <br><br>There is obviously something wrong with you if you're easily pleased by such disgusting proportions.</br></br>  Is this manga any good?<br>I like the fact that she actually looks like a jap.</br>  <br> her weird proportions <br><br>That's what makes it hot.<br>Also confirmed for boring vanilla bait waifu trash lover.</br></br></br></br>  <br> my world view is so fucked up that I find a blonde haired obese nigger attractive </br>  <br>You'd probably like the anime Popipo</br>  <br><br>I thought it was pretty good. I liked that they actually played Street Fighter and not some Wacdonalds version.</br></br>   cordelia fig <br> "oh cool, i love fire emblem" <br> 168k </br></br>  <br><br> I love Fire Emblem <br><br>And you support Awakening?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Waifus and casual mode saved the series. Now we have the gay too.<br><br>Also </br></br></br>  <br>Go home gramps.</br>  <br><br><br> is that way you fucking waifu faggots</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'd fucking love a Kaiki scale.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that is a Lupin-themed, toy bus.</br>  <br>Are there really people existing in the world who look at this figure and say to themselves, "yeah, that looks good"??</br>  <br>I should also mention that I have the Snow Miku DD on preorder as well.<br>  Just hope that the people who owe me 1200USD pay up soon.  </br></br>  <br>I buy localized releases. I only have one Jap BD, and that's Only Yesterday.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Ah, but I didn't even post my film collection. That's all anime.</br>  <br>Pretty sure thats due to licensing. Metal Gear figs are usually done by Play Arts and those are normally expensive to begin with</br>  g-guys, what did I buy and how do I put on the stickers? It's a 'board' game right?    <br><br>No one in these threads condones buying localized.</br></br>  <br>Speak for yourself anon.</br>  <br>Well I do think I see a double chin</br>  <br>Man, I'd be annoyed by the fact I won't be able to pose them.</br>  <br>That's a little silly when it comes to DVD/BD releases though. Even if I knew moon, Japanese releases are horribly expensive. I've heard even Japanese people sometimes import localized releases. If it helps there are quite a few imported releases there,  from the UK .</br>  <br>That's just the echo chamber effect confusing you. It's always just two or three people bitching and starting an argument over it. Most people lurking don't give a shit.</br>  Hey mates, have some cash laying around and thought I may as well buy some figures, read through the guide, what would you say would be the best figures for Shinji, Rei and Asuka?  <br><br>People buy original japanese releases because they come with better extras, and it's a better way of supporting the creators. elevens don't buy localized that much because everything is so readily available online nowadays. Some localizations have english hardsubs to piss off reverse importers, so there's even less of a reason to do it.</br></br>  <br><br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>I buy those Blu-Rays, the packaging is beautiful, but just not worth the $70.</br>    <br>But what if I don't have a cat?</br>  <br> come with better extras <br>But at what price?<br> better way of supporting the creators <br>Can't say I care. <br><br><br>Yeah, I only did it because Only Yesterday is my favorite Ghibli film and I wasn't content with just having the UK DVD release. I doubt I'd do that for very many other movies, maybe Gauche the Cellist and Jarinko Chie (if it had subs).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Gotta show that girls can like boy stuff too!</br>  <br>A dog is fine too</br>  <br>Most people in Japan don't buy anime bluray. They just watch it on TV.<br><br>The average wage in Japan is not higher than the UK or US. Rental and second hand trading is still huge in Japan for a reason. Only a few otaku actually buy anime.<br><br>I have watched about 50 shows now. If I had to buy them all on DVD/bluray I would be homeless by now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It shouldn't be very difficult to find a stray. Just lure it in with a piece of meat.</br>  <br>Pose what?</br>    <br>Preferably not lewd, just want cool figures preferably in plugsuits. Thank you though!</br>  <br>But what if they're covered in fleas? Last thing I need in my life is another bout with scabies.</br>  <br> Can't say I care. <br><br>Why do you buy them then? It'd be cheaper to buy an external hard drive.</br></br></br>  <br>Ftfy</br>  <br>I like collecting DVD/BDs. I have film collection that's about the same size. I still torrent plenty of anime.</br>  <br>Then you aren't ideal.</br>  <br> But at what price? <br><br>A premium. That's what you get. <br><br> Can't say I care. <br><br>Then fuck off.

There's new characters that add diversity. There's a fair amount of action and high tension scenes. I don't see the issue.</br>  <br>I only read the official translation, so I'm not done yet. But I don't see a problem with animating another 4-5 books.</br>  <br>For starters a Pokémon gen 1-2 anime based on the games Yellow and Crystal. 25 episodes each generation. Full shown gym leader battles with backstory and side quests like SS Anne (with theme included), Safari Zone, Silph Co., Pokémon Mansion, Cerulean Cave and Pokémon Tower in Kanto. It would end with Red beating an adapted league, like in the Ashnime but with the E4, rivals (Blue and Green) and other strong trainers, getting Mewtwo and going to train to Mt. Silver.<br>Next season would start with Gold, Silver and Kris getting their pokémon, fighting the gym leaders and showing the common troubles one had while fighting (Rollout, Fury Cutter, Kingdra, etc). Along the journey they would meet Kanto gym leaders and rivals from Gen 1, who would forshadow the ultimate battle. As for character development Silver will become a good trainer and eventually would team up with Gold to battle Lance and Clair. At the end, after beating the league Gold goes to Mt. Silver and Battles Red. After a long battle they are with their last pokémon. They both use their strongest moves while saying how good/strong their opponent is and the screen slowly goes black. A battery error message appears and then a NEW GAME option. The anime ends here.</br></br>  I would redo Oreimo as the author completely intended (not so fast Nekofags) with the better ending  <br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou anime <br>Oh, fuck yeah. There was an OVA way back when, but what I wouldn't give to see a proper TV series of it...</br></br>  <br> Yuyushiki season 2 <br>And seasons 3, 4, and 5.

SnW ended fine as it is.</br></br>  <br>You forgot to watch the OVA.</br>  Anime set in WW1. Starts out pretty generic, even some moe in the form of MC's gf/sister before he gets sent off to the front. Then on the 4th episode, MC dies out of nowhere. Nothing dramatic or heroic either, just a random stray bullet to the head in the middle of the episode. <br>From there everything is designed to be a huge "fuck you" to the audience. One of the MC's friends becomes the new MC for a while, but he gets killed off soon enough too, and the focus changes to another pretty random guy. As the series progress it starts going full Eva, with characters losing their sanity and everything breaking down psychologically.<br>As the series progresses, make the artstyle as realistic and gritty as possible. No stylization for dramatic effect. Camera shots are long and static medium shots, music is kept to a bare minimum, and the constant sound of endless bombardment in the background. The audience should feel physically sick from watching the show.<br><br>Ending is the 3rd or 4th guy we follow around losing his arm in an explosion and getting discharged. He returns back to whatever bumfuck village in France he came from, suffering from shellshock and unable to adjust to civilian life. He ends up shooting himself in the bathroom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd hire A-1 to redo Archer vs Shirou and post-epilogue answer.</br>  <br>Jesus, dude, that's horrifying.<br><br> I'd totally watch it. </br></br></br>  A movie for this<br><br>http://mangafox.me/manga/koukoku_no<wbr>_shugosha/</wbr></br></br>  <br> Mc has a harem of teenagers and a loli he rapes on a night basis <br> drink all the alcohol <br> casually torture some random guys with your bros <br>man the japanese sure know how to live it up</br></br></br></br>  Weight lifter woman, tanned and swole as fuck. Anime will be sad and lots of feels towards the end.  <br>Even better would be the side changing every time the focus changes.</br>  <br>Maybe have the guy who killed the current MC become the new MC</br>  <br>Frozen tear drop</br>  <br>ket-ai</br>  Oyasumi Punpun  <br>My nigga. Is this manga really ended? Seems lot of stuff still unresolved.</br>  A Promise of Blood anime.<br><br>It's already anime enough to work</br></br>  <br>3rd season of Majutsu Index, although I wouldn't trust J.C to do it.<br>Maybe OVAs and specials for series that had an abrupt end, mostly slice of lifes and romances.<br>Primarily though, more original drama movies and anime like wolf children and madoka.<br><br>If possible I would also fund a business to translate more games, visual novels and eroges, since there are so many i'd like to play.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Despera, or maybe Doos Ecks.</br>  This, of course.  <br>Yeah unfortunately. I feel like they could have continued it for a while, there was a lot of stuff they could have touched on but didn't, like another offensive in summer if it happened, what the fuck those dragons do, some of the other ruling families. What I am hoping for is they make a part 2.<br>In the meantime I'm gonna read this, apparently people keep saying its good.<br>http://mangafox.me/manga/gunka_no_b<wbr>altzar/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yotsuba&amp; anime <br>It'll be shit and you know it.</br></br></br>  I'd consider the following:<br>Etotama</br>  Accel World s2  <br> PunPun <br>That wouldn't even work as an anime.</br></br>  <br>Despera is getting an anime though.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  I wouldn't waste money on japanimation if I were a millionaire, but if I were a billionaire, sure.<br><br>I would hire Urobuchi and let him make his personal dream project. Let him choose the studio, the director, the VAs, who'll make the OP, ED and the soundtrack, everything. Tell him the anime will be publicly available for free online so he won't need to bother about time slot, censoring or anything else. I'll just bankroll him to do whatever he wants to see what would he do.<br><br>I'm not a huge fanboy of his, I'm just curious what project he would made if he was completely free to do whatever the hell he wants, with no restrictions.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope it was because of low sales or popularity because of the theme.<br><br> Gunka no Baltzar <br>Yeah it's good if you like political strategy more than warfare.</br></br></br></br>  I would buy a small, rural Japanese village and populate it with 2D posters of the cast of Non Non Biyori.  <br>And it would be just as boring as the show.</br>  <br>Same reasons Catcher in the Rye wouldn't work as a live action film. And it's too long.</br>  <br>It was pretty much perfect right up until the ending thoough</br>  <br>You don't need to be a millionaire to fund that</br>  <br>A 100% manga faithful adaption of One Piece by Bones, Madhouse or really anyone that isn't Toei, and since One Piece is ultra popular I would make my money back pretty easily.<br><br>I would also relaunch the series in the west with some major marketing since 4kids ruined it the first time around, so everyone knows to give it a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>Bless your soul good sir</br>  <br>typo, 'it was not because'<br/></br>  <br>Yeah, I would just dump money at the door of every studio I liked and see what they came up with on their own. I would kill to see Trigger make a TV anime with a really good budget.</br>  <br><br> just dump money on creators <br>Terrible idea and rarely turns out okay.<br>Creativity thrives in restrictive environments.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You do know that as a whole, animation talent is price inelastic right? It'll just fuck up the entire market.</br>  <br>The people are more important than the money.</br>  <br>this is counter intuitive but also true</br>  <br>None. I would keep it all to my self and live out the NEET life.</br>  <br>And money can't help it? Seriously? I don't think so.</br>  The World Ends With You anime, for sure.  Did hinata deserve to win? <br><br>Rereading the series she became a little too obsessive about naruto. To the point where it was unhealthy as fuck.
