[ How good is Kimi ga Nozomu Eien? <br><br>Appearently called Rumbling Hearts for the official English release.</br></br>  Bump.  do you like melodrama? it has  ntr.  also the ova has chizuru from mub rub.  <br>Do you like rage? Then Kimi Nozo is the anime for you.</br>  What kind of MC cucks his comatose girlfriend for her best friend?  <br>Pretty damn good.</br>  <br><br>it will make you angry<br><br>it's good</br></br></br></br>  <br>The kind of MC who would have gotten laid without the accident. He had been clearly mentally expectant of sexual intercourse and thus couldn't handle the lack of it.</br>  <br>Best girl won.</br>  <br>It's a good adaptation of the VN, but lacks in certain areas and removes some character interactions that still have a presence. Too bad the anime dropped all of Takayuki's soliloquies. This is pretty bad as they gave far more depth to his character. Now you really have to think yourself what he is going through, which most people just don't do. <br>It would be good to approach it with an open mind and trying to relate most characters.<br><br><br>The kind who tries to move on with his life rather than stagnate in one moment in time, especially afterwards he is kicked out from her life by her own parents. Then everything just goes to shit after he is just getting a bit better.  Haruka was aware of Hayase's feelings and basically fucked her best friend because she just wanted to have some dick. She also realised Takayuki had feeling for Hayase early on, but continued to spin him around her finger. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>An MC who is traumatized, guilt-stricken and not written to appeal to otaku fantasies.</br>  One of the few shows to give me a real feeling of anxiety while watching  It's like a Telemundo soap opera, I loved it.  Oh, watch the first two episodes back to back. That's a must now that you don't have to wait a week between them.  <br>He gets counter-cucked, so it's all good.<br>Also, Mitsuki a slut.</br></br>  <br>Legends say that waifu wars were impressive when this shit aired.</br>  <br>I've never seen worse kind of faggotry. All the secondaries who never even touched the VN couldn't wrap their heads around why things were happening and why characters acted like flawed human beings. We are talking about socially awkward faggots like  that throw catchphrases around like it was the hottest shit around, so we should never expect them to take real life into notion.</br>  <br>Is the VN good? I heard it suffered from bad pacing.</br>  Mitsuki was one of the first girls I religiously saved images of  <br><br>Rumbling Hearts is a good title considering how rage-inducing the series can be.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure being a slut for revenge is a shitty thing to do no matter what the circumstances</br>  <br>The VN is excellent, âge's masterpiece by all means. Pacing issues are always subjective. There are bits that may seem mundane and long, but we are talking about true slice of life story, not that K-On kind of silly shit. Even with the mundane you get glimpses into the characters, their motivations and what carries them. Father Suzumiya has a much larger role in it and really works great balance to inexperienced Takayuki. Sadly his most important role was moved to Fumio, the red haired nurse, despite she being a complete slut. A nice slut, but a slut nonetheless.<br>The pacing issue can be said to apply to all of âge's mainline works. This is how the writing style is usually applied with characters actually pondering and waging issues. Muv-Luv Alternative had few of those info dumps in form of classes, but we are in assumptions that the reader takes the role of the main character, so the reader has access to the main character's experiences and inner life.<br>Takayuki's inner life is one of the main reasons people really need to read the VN, as it show how fucked he is after the accident to the point of freezing due to PTSD at multiple points.<br>The VN of course has more time to elaborate on the strong points of each character as well as how they are weak, and I see a lot of people missing how weak Hayase's psyche really is, despite it being on the platter even in the TV-series.<br><br><br>It's also the series' official international title, used in Hong Kong DVD release that came before Western ones.<br><br><br>Fumio is a slut, Hayase's literal complete mental breakdown doesn't amount to that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My nigga</br></br>  <br>Hey there  Kiminozo Guy. </br>  <br>Thanks for the in-depth post. I have Latest Edition installed so I'll finally get started on it.</br>  <br>Didn't the anime adapt one of the less than optimal endings?</br>  <br><br>Niggas have good taste<br><br><br> Tee hee hee too much whisky <br><br><br>Just keep away from Homura's routes until you've gone through all others and are properly drunk.<br><br><br>It adapted less than optimal route for  Hayase . It is possible to stand firm and tell  Haruka as things are when it comes to it, preventing Hayase's mental breakdown.  It takes some liberties with certain events and goes even to the extent to change how they go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Muv-Luv Thread?  <br>Reminder that Mitsuki is the worst.</br>  <br>The worst was really Shinji. It's pretty easy to have your way with a person with almost complete breakdown.<br>Or Haruka, depending if you want to see love stealing little faux-princess who acts like she is doing nothing wrong as a friend betraying act.</br></br>  I recall acquiring a sinking feeling in my gut as I watched it with the dull realisation that there was absolutely no positive way this could end for any of these people. All I could do to stay afloat was cling to the knowledge that as bad as things were for them, they had it a lot worse one universe over.  <br>It's really more Takayuki's fault than anything. If he wasn't trying to have his cake and eat it too, then maybe things would've ended better.</br>  This show is fucking horrible, like no joke people complain about forced drama in SOL series but this takes the cake, it relies entirely on the MC being a complete retard and the heroine being a complete sociopath. It attempts to be mature but winds up feeling like a 3rd rate porno plot.    <br>But he wasn't. He was guilt ridden to four different directions. He still had a standing PTSD due to the accident, the current situation with Haruka and whatever delusions he had with it, his guilt towards treating Hayase like shit and ignoring her pleads to notice her shattering mental health. Then you have Haruka's dad coming back and requesting him to help Haruka to get better, and then Akane just drops the fucking bomb about her own feelings, after which she just gets sick and Takayuki has to take care of her. Oh wait, that didn't happen in the series.<br>Everything around him just shatters, and he can't literally move on for three years. Then when he is finally making some progress, shit just goes wrong. Too much responsibility is stacked on him to the point he can't even handle his own emotions and acts on how things were, not how things are and that's why he can't be true to himself until, once again, it is forced on him. Only when shit hits the fan he manages to drop the responsibilities that are not his to deal with.<br><br>And nigger, I'll fight you about the end. After all, it all ends in  Haruka marrying some with Murakami as his last name and realizes her dream as a children's book author, Akane becomes the school swimming team captain, Homura doesn't peg sex-changed Takayuki all night, and Hayase and Takayuki live as a proper family and they all get together after some time to meet again as friends  on that hill.</br></br></br></br>  But White Album 2 does the whole flawed characters thing a lot better.    <br>And nothing of value was lost.</br>  <br>I just think it's funny how he was the one to get fucked for a change. I like to think it made life for Mitsuki and Haruka better.</br>  <br>Hayase never getting into swimming, Haruka having legs broken and both drafted into army to fight aliens that are constantly killing everybody you love and care for.<br>Dunno, their EXTRA life is pretty fucking comfy compared to that.<br> SFD has best route; no accidents and Hayase gets her man </br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't talking about extra thought. I'm strictly speaking of muv luv verse. They're better off not having to put up with Takayuki's shit on top of everything else there.</br>  <br>Didn't Hayase confide in Takeru that they were both pretty broken up about him and that they never really got over him even years later?</br>  <br>I think it was Munakata or Kazama who told him that.</br>  <br>Seeing Takayuki has no needless pressure put on him and no PTSD due to accident, he most likely is his jolly self with Shinji. Much like all other BETAverse versions, he would have his no-bullshit side and stronger constitution. He'd still like TSFs, he was pretty into Valgern-On. <br>We can't really say that they would have put up with his shit, when they are talking him in such a warm manner whenever he gets a passing mention. <br><br><br>Pretty much. BETAverse trio didn't manage to get that ever sorted out, and when Takayuki died everything was just there. They're friends, but both know they couldn't get him because of the other.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've got a rumbling ass, does that count?</br>  <br>My first anime NTR. Mitsuki sleeping with the guys best friend. WHAT.THE.FUCK.</br>  <br>I guess you missed the total nervous breakdown, alcohol, Shinji takinf advantage of her and how Takayuki was in hospital spending time with a girl from three years ago and basically telling her how she mattered jack shit.</br>  <br>If I had a wish, I'd wish that this could air today to see /a/ burn to the ground.<br><br>Jesus, imagine this airing in today's /a/. It'd be worse than Guilty Crown, Vaverape, Yahari, etc. This shitposting would make most other shows' threads look like proper discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Watch what you are wishing for, anon.</br>  <br>Did you see the threads for the first two episodes of Death Parade? It would be like that, only ten times worse.</br>  Mitsuki route is canon  <br>Oh please yes.</br>  Bakayuki is such a faggot.  Well, thanks, guys.I was really buttmad when Takayuki choose Mitsuki.I'm just a filthy secondary after all.  Mitsuki best girl.<br><br> the VN will never be translated </br></br>    <br>Watch it, then watch the randumb akane side story, then read the muv-luv trilogy and then watch the akane sidestory again.</br>  <br>You mean Akane Maniax? It's really great how well it connects KGNE and Muv-Luv. It's even more amazing that Extra starts with Takeru and Sumika wondering where the hell Gouda went.</br>  <br>Really loved her in the novel.</br>  <br>Yes, Akane Maniax, it's great context for the whole experience.</br>  <br>And it's the only anime featuring the Muv-Luv main cast.</br>  Here's a really bad rip-off of this that I wrote for a short paper.<br><br>https://www.dropbox.com/s/5vvde31f4<wbr>e6y4a3/Kimo%20ga%20Nozomu%20AP%20En<wbr>glish.docx?dl=0</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>This is funny since I ripped off Narcissu for my English final in high school</br>  <br>Post where?</br>  <br><br>White album 2 took it and did it a million times better.</br></br>  <br>Mitsuki did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>You have that backwards.</br>  <br>Will we ever get Day Zero VN ?<br>Well after MLA, I reach the conclusion that every single harem/romcom protagonist will automatically become better by dropping them in BETAverse.</br></br>    <br> Well after MLA, I reach the conclusion that every single harem/romcom protagonist will automatically become better by dropping them in BETAverse. <br>Well, two things can happen which really come out benefitially to us:<br>1)they get better<br>2)get turned into Soldier class</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Seriously fuck Takayuki, if he just moved on. Everyone would have been happier. I mean he knew her for like a week, and he ends up ruining his life over her.</br></br></br>    <br> And nothing of value was lost. <br>But that's wrong faggot, he fucking got Yui's father killed with his stupidity.</br></br>  <br> why did this picture reminded me of muv luv unlimited? </br>  <br>Because they died in Alternative.</br>  <br>fuck you faggot</br>  <br>http://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/620<wbr>20</wbr></br>    New anime, get fucking hyped!<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VeE<wbr>6xf5yFqw&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Love that song</br>  <br>You do realize that was posted as part of April Fools 2015, right?</br>  Haruka a shit  <br>what shinji did was a dick move but he wasn't taking advantage of her. she was planning on slutting it up with a bunch of random guys because she was mad at takayuki. in the end shinji saved her from a gangbang.</br>  Akane was the better sister,  Hayase is best   Damn, this KgNE thread reminds of that Onigiri (?)'s April Fool special filled with wrong subs and gay innuendo. Anyone have a copy of it?  That fucking ending when you make Hayase your sex slave. My dick. <br><br><br>I know, I was trying to ruse people.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope you followed all the symbolism that was going on. Nobody was doing anything right in that moment. Haruka was being fooled, her stealing the love of that was clearly about to bloom between Takayuki and Hayase and continuing to lie her about her core reasons and feelings, Takayuki was practically ignoring Hayase to the point of pic related, Shinji being an asshole and Hayase cracking down to itty bitty pieces. <br>Everybody is doing something wrong at that period in the story, and the heavy handed symbolism depicts this. <br>If you want to get to the core of it, Haruka should have encouraged Hayase to go forth with her feelings towards Takayuki rather than force her own wantings in there over Hayase. There's a reason Shinji says it always had to be Takayuki for Hayase and why he never could move forwards with his feelings.</br></br></br>  <br> planning on slutting it up with a bunch of random guys <br> saved [...] from a gangbang </br></br>  <br>I want to make Mitsuki my sex slave.<br><br>I'd love her more than Bakayuki, though that isn't saying much.</br></br></br>  I wish i could forget this show.      <br>MASTERPIECE.<br><br>It was the first anime in history that split the fanbase into 2 large raging groups coming at each other everyday.<br>There were even arguments coming from nipland, it was fucking glorious.<br><br>Present /a/'s shitpost storm is nothing compared to this shit back in the days.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't Bakayuki just evacuate?</br>  <br>Wait a second, what is this? Some kind of sci fi sequel to Kiminozo? Haruka and Mitsuki have their school time hairstyles though?</br>  <br> much country <br> He acted as a decoy for the other squads to flee. <br> He saved Sagiri </br></br></br>  <br> tfw i will never be able to experience shitstorms of this magnitude <br><br>And i like Kimi ga Nozomu Eien. I'd love to see people react to it unspoiled.</br></br></br>  <br>No way, why would age do that<br><br><br>Probably like True Tears, but worse</br></br></br></br>  <br>The game is way better.<br>That is all.</br></br>   tfw they play a brief snippet of Rumbling Hearts in MuvLuv EX when Yuuko rams Sumika into the sky with her car   /a/ just had to remind me of this Rage Inducing Anime.<br><br>That fucking slut Mitsuki. Everything would have been fine but the Best Friend had to sleep with Hayase and then Punch the Current Boyfriend ? Jesus Christ that was the worst. In all honesty. Not only did he sleep with her but he made it sound like he was on the right and to make matters worse he punched the one he NTR'd. I mean Fucking Hell seeing that faggots face makes me wanna punch my screen to oblivion.</br></br>    <br>If you count drunken cheating and regretting it forever ntr. Still gave me my first ever encounter with ntr feels and still makes me seethe. Fact it was with Takayukis best friend made it the worst.</br>  <br>If it's any consolation Shinji was probably also killed by American G-bombing of Yokohama Hive.</br>  <br>Seriously though, did they make more sequel to Kiminozo or something? Takayuki is now dead?</br>  <br>No way, that's just silly. KGNE is a done story</br>  <br>Oh, and Haruka became Alien's food. I'm not even joking.</br>  <br><br>you must be shitting me, way to ruin a perfectly decent slice of life drama.</br></br>  <br>Bakayuki dying is the best closure for the both of them</br>  <br>Not really.  It's an alternative universe <br><br><br>But that didn't close anything and left everything open and things were never handled. They were just left floating in the air.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DEAD PEOPLE CAN'T MARRY</br>  <br>People don't die, they get to shipped to Altered Fable.</br>  <br>Might as well be dead with everything on a standstill on there</br>  <br>Oh, so it's just Kimi ga nozomu Xenoglossia?</br>  <br><br>Still how would he fare in combat though ?<br>From the brief trailer, it seems while he wasn't Takeru-tier, he was at least pretty decent.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like an eternity they wished for.<br><br><br>Seeing how it is said he was pretty good at Valgern-On, I'd say he was most likely better than Hayase.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Decent enough to hold a line without one of these or an A-10</br>  <br>More like Kiminozu:Blue Gender, actually.</br>  <br> It's like an eternity they wished for. <br>Oh you</br></br>  <br>Better than Hayase ? I always thought Alt!Hayase would be stronger than Takeru due to her experience. Than again, this is Alt!Takayuki here, Extra!Mikoto is better than Takeru in Valgern-on but that doesn't mean her alternative self is stronger than Takeu, right ?</br>   Kimi ga Nozomu Eien <br> means something like "The Eternity You Desire" <br> EOPs desire a translation <br> it's still not translated a decade and half after the game was released <br> EOPs might have to   keep desiring it for eternity <br><br>It's like pottery,<br>it rhymes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takeru's main problem at Valgernon according to Mikoto EX is that he keeps falling into predictable patterns. <br><br>This is why you can win against Mikoto at Valgernon by picking the exact opposite of what Takeru aka STORM VANGUARD MOTHERFUCKER would do. Keep your distance instead of closing to melee, keep moving and wait for an opening instead of attacking immediately, strafe to evade instead of closing the distance or retreating. Don't be fooled by Takeru saying that Kaizer is an excellent CQC machine.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course experience amasses more skill, she wasn't killed in the line of duty after all. The series mentions games only in one passing point in the first episode, but the VN has few more spots where you can notice Takayuki's interest in games. Of course, later on the series you see him in the arcades racking up some points in a lightgun game. I'd say that comparatively speaking Takayuki was most likely a pretty damn good surface pilot to the point of being better than Hayase. Of course, in Alternative Hayase has racked more experience so there's that.<br>Sure, in Takeru's case he had the info from his home world, but I am making this argument based on Takayuki's basic interests that the two versions share at most basic level, just like the rest of the cast.</br></br>  <br><br>Before we follow this line of logic any further I'd like to point out that Meiya is an awful copilot when you have her as a partner in Extra so it's not like valgernon capabilities correspond directly to tsf pilot powerlevel.</br></br>  <br>Not directly, that's true enough. Takeru was a surface pilot god mostly due to Sumika forcing him to go through shitloads of stomach twisting roller coasters and him trying to beat Mikoto in Valgern-On. It's comparative only to a point.<br>However, we do see most of previous âge cast being pretty damn decent pilots, so I would assume Takayuki and Shinji followed the same suit.</br></br>  But who sucks dick better?<br><br>Mitsuki or Haruka?</br></br>  <br>Statistically sucked more dicks, a competitive streak, and better lung capacity</br>  <br>Anon, I like your style.</br>  <br>how deep is the ntr</br>  On the topic of pilot experience. When Takeru landed in Alternative universe on October 22 they hadn't even been in a simulator yet. But somehow by December 25th everyone in the squad was a radical ace who are like ten times better than normal army pilots with more combat experience. I'm sure XM3 helped a bit, but even so. Less than two months is barely enough time to get familiar with basic combat maneuvering, and it doesn't help that they switched to the Shiranui past the halfway point and had to familiarize themselves with a whole new machine with its own handling characteristics.  <br>Thank you anon. If only Takayuki is as appreciative as you</br>  <br>You don't even know half of it all, anon.</br>  <br><br>3DPD at it's finest</br></br>  I remember watching this before being tainted by /a/'s mentality. So Mitsuki fucking MC while Haruka was in a coma didn't strike me as a big deal, people have to move on and I didn't consider it cheating or anything. Now that I look back the anime was not that good.  <br>I just pushed it to their memories shifting from other experiences like the ero ones since they're 00 candidates</br>  <br> Now that I look back the anime was not that good. <br>because it wasn't good to begin with, this is the story of retards playing matchmaker and realizing they fucked up. Retard being traumatized for something he didn't do and ruining his entire life.<br><br>Autism the Anime</br></br></br></br>  Read Kanojo no Namida ga Yuki da Toshitara, it's pretty much the same story expect the genders are reversed and the focus is on the guy that just got out of a coma. I think it would give you some perspective before judging Mitsuki.  <br>but the coma guy wasn't retarded in fact they weren't retarded maybe cept for the girl</br>  <br>Remember Mitsuki and Takayuki were already gravitating towards each other at first, and Haruka deliberately preempted Mitsuki before it could go any further.</br>  <br>Anon, you're talking about a story that has the wimpy civ the MC is becoming a soldier in a month. It takes a minimum of three months to train a body that isn't used to the physical exertion needed for combat. Them becoming super pilots in another month is just the icing on the cake.</br>  <br><br><br>What this guy said. Essentially the pilots were all selected to be able to "choose" the perfect timelines possible, this went as far as in what situation they were born. Prime ministers daughter, The shogun's sister, etcetera. <br><br>Like the 00 unit, they all had the intrinsic ability to absorb relevant knowledge from alternate universes, but that process wasn't properly started until a rift appeared in space time, that is to say, when Takeru arrived.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>All these characters and new ones are from a later VN from Age. Specifically Muv Luv Alternative. From that it has spawned a rather large franchise.<br><br>The scenes in the pic is from this video which promotes spinoffs from MLA <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3eE<wbr>cBuYj4v8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You either like the short haired chick on the left or you can't stand her at all and hence can't take the show seriously at all. Basically just an NTR series, although a pretty good one.</br>  <br>I personally shat bricks when Akane popped up when I was playing MuvLuv Extra for the first time and it hit me that this was somehow connected to KGNE</br>  am I the only one who thought Haruka's legs in Alt was a huge fucking Chekhov's Gun?<br><br>like, ok, you go through all this shit of how she lost both legs, and was unable to pilot a TSF, BUT IT'S OK, because she still can continue being a human being right?<br>and Then comes her mission, she's the only one who can use the computer, and you know, you HAVE to know she's going to die, she just has to, it's way to fucking easy.<br><br>and here I am worrying my brains off, is her prosthetic leg going to crack when sliding down a ladder to the shafts, or is a Solider Class going to grab her from under the floor and pull off her legs, leading to a horrible scene where he claws and crawls her away from the creeping imminent death behind her.<br><br>and then nothing, she just gets slam jammed by a warrior class and that's the end of it.<br>What a fucking waste of a character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you count drunken cheating and regretting it forever ntr <br>Who doesn't?</br></br>  <br>People don't always die in hilariously ironic ways dude. Sometimes they just run into horrible space aliens and get murderized.</br>  <br>but LITERALLY what was the point of her having prosthetic legs(albeit, super advanced legs). it is never mentioned anywhere else, no one else is walking around with augmented limbs, for what purpose was this supposed to have?!?</br>  <br>WA2 has a similar premise and it didn't burn /a/ to the ground.</br>  <br>World building?</br>  <br>So everything in a story needs to have major significance to the plot to justify its existence according to you? Are you seriously so autistic that you would have a meltdown if a character decides to have a cup of coffee and there isn't an explanations why that character didn't decide to drink tea instead?</br>  <br>because none of the Main Girls slept with a Sunohara</br>  The real best girl should have won  <br>I think the notion of advanced prosthetic limbs is more than sufficient enough to garner some sort of deeper explanation from the writer.<br>I mean, surely with the existence of S00mika, there is a lot of interesting possibilities in the MLverse and I'd like theme explored</br></br>  <br>Only thing good about her is the character design.</br>  <br>Strikes me as a buttfuck girl.</br>  <br><br>Haven't seen these caps before, where are they from? Some new KimiNozo special?</br></br>  <br>You know it</br>  She also swallows, but that's pretty much prerequisite for buttfucking  <br> Sadly his most important role was moved to Fumio, the red haired nurse, despite she being a complete slut. A nice slut, but a slut nonetheless. <br>tell me more, Kimi ga nozomu is one of my favorite anime, same goes for the muvluv VN, too bad my a fucking EOP.</br></br>  <br>Hahaha, I had no idea and it was true.</br>  <br> that's pretty much prerequisite for buttfucking <br><br>Why?</br></br></br>  <br>Sucking dicks and swallowing is more intimate than penetration. If you suck dicks, your tonguing buttholes too</br>  Also did somebody say nurse?  <br> your tonguing buttholes too <br>What's up with my butthole now?</br></br>  <br>Noooope.</br>  <br> new <br>Old as shit special<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=i2T<wbr>1yCaD4nQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>Fumio's route is basically that she fucks Takayuki one night, and then the next day he is trying to get to her. She just says it was a one-night stand and that there was no feelings from her end. Then she starts wondering who she should fuck that night, and can't even name or count all the men she has fucked. Akane hears the conversation and is buttblasted like no other. She goes and tells this to everyone and the route ends there.<br>Fumio is a nice person, but she really is the only real slut in it. Her role where he gives the encouraging words to Takayuki was taken from Haruka's father, who is absolutely fucking fantastic character in the VN, admitting to his own faults while giving encouraging words to Takayuki.<br><br><br><br>Her additional ending in the later releases is better, but fuck that original bad end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh c'mon, she's a nice girl</br>  <br>She was made to be a slut, I mean look at her</br>  <br> Old as shit special <br>Oh man, I've seen this after all. It's just been way too long ago.<br><br>N-no. Stay away, vile demon.</br></br></br></br>  What happens in the green hair girl route?  I thought we were going to get a full adaptation of Muvluv  <br>I just want an anime of Extra.</br>  <br>Engineered to be a slut. A nice slut, but a slut nonetheless.

Nobody had this one figured out yet!<br><br>Aw shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Gouda was a hero âge needed.</br>  <br>What quality? Akane Maniax's style would have been fine with Extra</br>  FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK TAKAYUKI!  <br>You mean G-guy right? <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=SuS<wbr>pSUBM-W8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  The only thing I remember about this show is that despite the blue haired chick fucking the MCs best friend, I still blamed the MC for everything.  <br>I actually mean Tekkumen<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ehx<wbr>Nfk1u1-U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how may episodes Muvluv would have been. I bet if they had animated it along with Alternative it would go well with newer series</br></br>    <br><br>We all did, he was a chump who blamed himself for something he didn't do and failing to move on with his life.</br></br>  <br>I prefer Inside of Light.<br><br>But, Kamille being Ayu's white knight never fails to make me smile. Especially that AyuMayu trailer when he goes up against Domon/Tekkaman/Gouda.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2rE<wbr>MM9KlgCU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>They really got their worth from Ayu.<br>Now if they could just finish and release Kimi ga Nozomu Muv-Luv.</br></br>  Lay it down for, which Kimi would you fuck?<br><br>I haven't read the VN or seen the anime, but Mitsuki is down for some fucks judging by the CGs.</br></br>  As someone who thought MLA and ML's writing was mostly garbage, would anyone say that this is much better? I need something new to play, but if it has forced shit like ramming a million death flags down your throat then expecting you to care when characters die, I'm not gonna bother.  <br><br>Everyday</br></br>  <br>I wish they could just release something else finally. Where's Elfen Blaze?</br>  <br> âge VN <br> play <br>good joke anon</br></br></br>    I got so fucking mad watching this show. But for a melodrama, the show delivered. Pity that Japan hasn't made a show more drama-filled ever since.<br><br><br><br>Mitsuki is okay, but I'd only fuck her out of pity. Haruka is more attractive, anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pity that Japan hasn't made a show more drama-filled ever since. <br>WA2</br></br>  <br>I cant remember shit about it other than the aspect that they did an ova to please the other side and long hair girl always won.</br>  <br>Well Utawarerumono 2 got a release date so there might still be hope. ;_;</br>   tfw i always wanted to fuck these girls in MLA but i was stuck with fucking Sumika. <br>So is there an entire VN dedicated to them?

Nothing really explicit was shown.</br>  <br>Next Season and AyuMayu don't seem to be on Nyaa but the BD is. Going to torrent the shit out of it.</br>  <br>But the BD release on nyaa has subs.</br>  <br>ahhh. can you refresh my memory anon, before the coma did Shityuki sleep with Haruka ?</br>  <br>Nope, they never boned.</br>  <br>Nope. Haruka was completely pure.</br>  Now that I think about it Shinji NTR'd someone too. Didn't he have a girlfriend at the time?  <br>Yeah, he was dating another girl at the same time.</br>  <br>Takayuki? Yes. See </br>  <br><br>Thank you kind anons<br><br><br>yeah. he had a girlfriend NTR wasn't as bad but his confrontation with Takayuki was terrible he slept with his Girlfriend and he still talked like he was on the right, the faggot just rubbed me off the wrong way. Making it look like hey " i fucked your Girlfriend but your the one whose wrong ".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't bone. There was no penetration, and Haruka even apologises about not doing it with him</br>  <br>What was the whole eternity and space thing then? Hell, I think they even bone in the VN pre-timeskip.</br>  In light of recent events, lets have a husbando thread.<br>I'll start.</br>  <br>The best part about husbandos is that you can be more than just friends and its not gay at all.</br>  <br>He's just so comfy.</br>  <br>My husbando spends a lot of time away.</br>    ;_;        <br>Thank you anon  and you're husbando a cute. </br>  What would the wedding between you and your husbando be like?

Original 1-26, then the directors cut episodes then EoE? Then the new rebuild stuff? Help!!!!!!!  <br>I enjoy it, but it's a chore if I get out of the habit. Takes me weeks to get back in the rhythm.</br>  <br> Why do the nips have onomatopoeia for everything? <br><br>It's a mystery.<br>http://detail.chiebukuro.yahoo.co.j<wbr>p/qa/question_detail/q127992112</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Original 26, EoE, don't bother with the rest. Evanjell-o is shit, the only reason to watch the original series is because it's required watching for /a/</br>  <br>There is no required watching for /a/.<br>Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to take a chill pill.<br>The only requirement /a/ has is that you watch/read a few hundred titles. But no particular title is mandatory.</br></br></br>  <br>It's "required" in the sense that if you ever admit to not watching it people will bitch at you for the rest of the thread. It's just easier to watch it and get it out of the way.</br>  <br>Evangelion's basically required viewing in a literal sense, in that you almost can't browse /a/ effectively without at least knowledge of it. It's referenced too much.</br>  <br>It gets referenced all the time.</br>  <br> people will bitch at you for the rest of the thread <br>No, they won't - unless you're generally an ass or evidently a newfag or mouthing off in an NGE thread, obviously.<br><br><br><br>Not really.<br><br>I would recommend trying it, because I like it and think it's pretty good. But if you don't like it, drop it and just avoid NGE discussions. It's not difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do spoilers and spoiler scans work?<br><br>How do people get the newest chapters without themt being released in japan?</br></br>  <br>All the time.</br>  What's the difference between ai, koi and suki?  <br>By reference, do you mean "Rei-clone"?<br>That hardly requires you to watch NGE to understand. Sure, you may not know what kind of person Rei is, but the clones aren't proper Reis either, so there's no need to know the original.</br></br>  <br>Magazines get sent to shops in advance of their release and then some shop workers scan and upload these.</br>  <br>http://za-sh.com/difference-love-44<wbr>60.html<br>http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2134166<wbr>671986505801<br><br>好き is just like, either romantically or not.</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>Found it through tumblr spoilers, actually.<br><br>Question: Does Pixiv Expunged exist?</br></br></br>  Why are most anime fans so autistic? I was going to join my university's anime society thinking it would be nice to meet some people with the same interests as me.<br><br>Then I saw their fucking promotional video. Acting like anime characters isn't cute, it makes you look mentally disabled.</br></br>  <br>So, as someone who enjoys NGE, do you recommend the other stuff that the first anon said was shit? I'm on episode 16 and enjoying it thus far</br>  <br>Are you a landwhale?</br>  <br>Ahahaha same here anon, I thought it would be a place for me to make friends but I saw their facebook page and decided I'd rather be friendless. Thankfully 2nd semester I found my crew but holy cow they are fucking embarrassing. They are even throwing a make shift convention together next Spring which I may show up to with my friends shit faced so we can fuck around</br>  <br> Early 2000s had that shitty "not quite right" digital style as seen in pic related. Now digital animation is more clean and nice in HD. <br><br>It still looks like absolute shit.</br></br></br>  <br>The TV show + EoE is basically the way to go.<br>Don't touch the manga.<br>I haven't tried the compilation movies, but I'm not aware of them having any value beyond just summarizing the show.<br>Rebuild. Well, I'm not particularly fond of it, but if you wish to discuss NGE on /a/ you'd better know it. It's the biggest thing at the moment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They all have shit taste, too.</br>  Are there people you can get to buy shit for you at comiket?<br><br>I haven't found anyone so far</br></br>  So there's all these season of Fate/Stays, do I watch in release order?  <br>I haven't watched eva yet, nor a lot of required watching. I browse /a/ just fine and when I feel like getting to those shows I will.</br>  <br>Alright, thank you anon. I googled it, but its hard to get a solid opinion because most of the people saying what to watch are ravid fan boys. Currently working my way through the "classics" per say. Nice to get some helpful anons for once. Also side note, just finished the episode where Kaji shows Katsuragi Adam, and I feel like that was foreshadowed pretty heavily beforehand but maybe I just predicted it I'm not sure</br>  <br>Hardly.<br>And now that moot's gone you more than likely won't have to worry about not having a clue why a fucking bike horn has been playing for the past 5 hours one day.</br></br>  <br>I think you confuse ''people who make it really obvious they are into anime'' with ''people who are fans of anime''<br><br>Just like every hobby,the loons who annoy everyone give the medium a bad rep.</br></br></br>  Why do people praise the F/SN VN when it's mediocre at best in all three routes?  How furious do you get when someone insults you're waifu?  <br>I watched NGE only in 2010. Since I was a fucking newfag I did get into stupid shit on a regular basis, but it was never NGE related.</br>  <br>Cause it was their 1st or 2nd VN.</br>  <br>Do not watch any release by studio DEEN,they are terrible. Watch Fate/zero followed by Fate/stay <br>UBW 2014/2015 edition.<br><br>It is highly recommended that you read the VN first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why is Ping Pong the Animation giving me the feels?</br>  <br>It's shit but shounenshit fags love it.</br>  <br>Zero, then the UBW series that just ended.<br>Watch Prisma Illya whenever. Same with KnK.<br>Ignore the DEEN FSN from 2006, their UBW movie, and  Tsukihime. <br><br>If you're gonna read the VN, probably do that first, but there are hordes and hordes of secondaries, and we all get along just fine without reading it.</br></br></br></br></br>  how many of /a/ did actually watch boku no pico and how many did actually fap to it?  <br>Back in the day we often watched it together with other anons. It was fun, fapping in unison.</br>  <br>What is watashi's true name?</br>  <br><br>Is this a delicious cake, can't tell by thid picture?</br></br>  how many hours of anime until I turn ultra virgin and start decorating my room with anime merchandise?  I'm not seriously afraid of asking this but rather the few times I have asked this I never get proper answers.<br>why is NTR looked at so poorly?</br>  Oh<br>Why do you guys pretend you weren't all over Katawa Shoujo's dick in the time leading up to and the time following it's release?</br>  <br>Do you like getting cucked?</br>  <br>I've never had a girlfriend so it's not as if I could answer you sincerely.</br>  <br>I'm guessing because people think it relates too much to actual women.</br>  Why do we watch anime?  <br>escapism</br>  Why FSN franchise is so famous in /a/? Its so-so VN for me.  <br>Do you have a waifu?</br>  How do I understand those ranking lists where they show how much people have pre ordered current anime dvds blue-ray?  <br>Why can't we watch non-anime to escape?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>EOPs.</br>  <br>it's too realistic</br>  <br><br>anime and anything related to it is about escapism, a perfect world were average dudes are loved by hot chicks. NTR is kinda of a reminder of reality or what they fear it would happen. The buzzwords wish fulfillment and self-inserting don't exist for nothing m8.</br></br>  <br><br>A hole that gets filled by anime. Also i enjoy it and being on /a/ makes it a little bit more fun to watch.</br></br>  <br>Not all my h-doujins are about escapism. I'm not trying to escape into a world where octopuses and zombies are trying to rape everyone.</br>  <br>Oh for fuck's sake.<br><br>I can't explain it to you Anon, you will just have to use common sense.</br></br></br>  <br>Because.</br>  Why don't people lash out at "doujinS" with the same vigor they do at "animeS/mangaS"?  <br>I mean, I don't like war and stuff like that either, but it's enjoyable when it's fictional media, no? That's why I'm making this question, but escapism and wish fulfillment actually make sense as to why it's disliked.</br>  <br>So they don't trust their waifu enough and subsequently feel insecure around imagery of unfaithful women?</br>  <br>Probably because doujinshi feels more foreign/weeb-ish to say than just keeping the singular noun like you do with manga or anime.</br>  <br>Doujins is short for doujinshi.</br>  <br>On this note, why doesn't anyone lash out at "moe" being used instead of "moé"?</br>  <br>Ore</br>  Why is Love Live so popular? It's nothing special. The characters were mostly boring, some of them might as well not exist and the show wouldn't be any different. The drama at the end of season 1 was terrible. Second season had too many melodramatic and cringeworthy crying scenes, yet you can't get invested in those emotions because the characters were so boring and empty you can't feel anything for them. The songs are worse than your average generic j-pop. The CG looks creepy, Aikatsu handles that much better. Why is everyone jumping on this bandwagon?  How do I leverage my power level to get a girlfriend?  <br>Becasue americans don't like accents</br>  How the fuck do people get into idol shit? I consider it to be the lowest form of anime. The only time I tried watching one I cringed and questioned my manhood.  <br>Come on.</br>  <br>Because most keyboards don't have a key for that and most people don't know the alt code for it.</br>  <br>Chinese robots</br>  <br>The girls are cute<br><br><br>If a girl genuinely likes you maybe she wouldn't really care if watching anime is one of your hobbies, at most you would need to lower your time spend on it to spend time with her instead</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people still believe that doujin equals to ero-manga almost exclusively.</br>  What's wrong with being a "secondary"?<br><br>Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? Wouldn't it better to just wait for a live TL or actual release?</br></br>  <br>Depends what you're into. I hated IM@S but liked Love Live, and Locodol even more. If you watch it like any other I'm sure there will be at least one series that's enjoyable.</br>  <br>Oh somebody please. All the asterisks fry my brain.</br>  <br>  What's wrong with being a "secondary"? <br>Because people get jealous when they're shit manga/VN/LN isn't 'obscure' anymore.<br><br> Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? Wouldn't it better to just wait for a live TL or actual release? <br>Because they can either read Nipon to some degree, or can't wait for the release.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just pretend I do.</br>  <br>Because you don't like it yet.</br>  <br>Most likely to avoid being associated with both /v/ and the terrible KS fanbase.</br>  <br> What's wrong with being a "secondary"? <br><br>Cause secondaries usually know shit when the adaptation is bad. Although some "primaries" carrying in spoilers into the thread can make it real shit. Like Saekano recently, the threads were just all about what will happen in Vol. 7.<br><br><br> Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? Wouldn't it better to just wait for a live TL or actual release? <br><br>I dunno. Personally I know Japanese, so I give no fucks about translations.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate it when LNfags have the nerve to call animefags secondary when they're the ones who is secondary to the main topic of this board which is anime and manga.</br>  <br>is korean manga better than japanese ?</br>  <br>Why is this thread not deleted yet?</br>    <br>I'll just use an example from the archive.<br><br>***,*62位/***,126位 ★ (**2,479 pt) [*,*37予約] 2015/06/17 響け!ユーフォニアム 1 [Blu-ray] <br><br>62 is the current preorder ranking on Amazon (lower is better)<br>126 is the previous ranking<br>★ means Blu-ray (an empty star means DVD)<br>2,479 is "preorder points", an estimation of well it will sell based on Amazon preorder rankings (higher is better)<br>37 is the confirmed number of preorders from nico (this number is always low)<br>the rest is just the date of release and the title</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's wrong with being a "secondary"? <br><br>Secondaries generally find the series later and ask questions that all the primaries know the answer to. They're effectively newfags for that series.<br><br> Why do people read raws for stuff that has a dedicated TL group and stuff? <br>I assume you mean if they don't know Japanese (because otherwise it's obvious), in which case it's really just about getting what you can as soon as you can.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The exact same reason the other COUNTLESS amounts of threads like these were not deleted within the hour or so they were created.</br>  <br>On OS X it's option-e followed by the letter. On Linux it's composekey (whatever you set that up as) then ' then the letter.</br>  <br>Please don't spoon feed.</br>    <br>Wow, thank you.</br>  <br>And on Windows, which a majority of people use, it's some random fucking alt code.</br>  <br>The bigger question would be if you care about non-anime related things like espresso/espressi too.</br>  <br><br><br><br>éééééééééééééé<br>éééééééé</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Júst gèt yöürsêlf ä German keyboard.</br>  <br>áéíóúñ</br>  <br>It is /a/ related, you fuckwit</br>  <br>Not everyone lives in shitholes under the constant threat of being beheaded by narcos.</br>  Why do people feel the need to bring up the source material when i call their favorite anime shit? An example would be with UBW. Just because i play the vn doesn't mean the anime is going to suddenly be any better it'll still be shit.  <br>ěščřžýáíéóňďť<br><br><br>Czech Republic, faggot. I'm no fucking spic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br>Because moe is accurate.</br>  <br>Because they often claim that the original material is better than the adaptation.<br><br>Which if true in a lot of cases.</br></br></br>  Do people here actually think anime writing is any good? It's kind of hard to tell what's a ruse and what's real here sometimes.  <br>I don't see Light Novels up there, only Anime and Manga.</br>  <br>You mean plot or text?</br>  <br>I'll say vocal acting is good.</br>  <br>I'm sure others do but I dont but it doesn't mean I can't enjoy it</br>  <br>Pretty sure everyone here thinks the writing in one anime or another is good, otherwise they wouldn't watch it. Just don't expect anyone to ever admit it.</br>  <br>That's because moot is/was a secondary piece of shit.</br>  <br>No u</br>  <br>It depends on the show, obviously.<br>But yes, an anime can have good writing.</br></br>  <br>Why are LNfags so fucking arrogant?</br>  <br>I admit that I enjoy anime and that's all that matters to me. It interests me much more watching cute girls being cute than it does reading some wanker's whining about how cruel the world is and how everything is meaningless.</br>  <br>I don't see shitposting in title for /v/, yet that's all they do. So what's your point?</br>  <br>Cause they get to look down at secondary plebs like you.</br>  <br>Why are secondaries so ignorant?</br>  <br><br>But anon, you are the secondaries to this board. This is an anime and manga board, LN discussions are tolerated but not the norm. <br><br>Get back in your hole, scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br> get to look down on people <br> have to read light novels <br>that's inhumane</br></br></br>  <br>It's tolerated because it's related. How is it not? Half the shit that gets adapted these days come from ln</br>  <br>Because they read genre fiction for 14-year-olds.</br>  <br>Filthy /v/ crossboarder get the fuck outta here</br>  <br> LNs <br> good enough to grant status <br>what the fuck in the ever fucking fuck? LN is junk food literature</br></br></br>  <br>The main topic of this board is anime and manga so you will find loads of people who only enjoy anime, if you have a problem with those people then you can fuck right off since they belong on here a lot more than you.</br>  <br> shit <br>Correct, half of the shit out there does come from light novels</br></br>  <br> impying im a crossborder </br>  <br>It's no different than other television shows, theres a ton of shit but if you sift through it you can find some gems</br>  <br>If you aren't, why care so much about /v/?</br>  <br>boku</br>  <br>Are you seriously trying to imply that watching half assed cartoon advertisements for said books is better?<br><br>Come on, just admit you just don't like/know how to read. We all already know it.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't, I was using the retards for a point. Currently, you are the only showing any care about them, /v/-kun</br>  <br> Are you seriously trying to imply that watching half assed cartoon advertisements for said books is better? <br>Nowhere did I imply that. I just stated that LN readers feel superior because they read genre fiction for 14-year-olds. Which is true.</br></br>  <br>/v/ pls, who are you trying to fool?</br>  Do people really read LNs here?<br>All what I see in LN threads are "Muh summary" "Muh spoilers" but you guys actually read the books? And with that I mean, the japanese version, not some badly trasnlated shit at baka-tsuki.</br>  <br>It is superior to watching half assed, often unfinished, cartoon advertisements for said books though.</br>  /a/ would be a much better place if LNfags had their own containment board.  <br>They should feel superior.<br><br>Reading fiction made for 14 year olds is better than watching cartoons made for 14 years olds, which, most modern anime is</br></br></br>  Alright explain to me what the fuck a Series Composition person does and how does is it different from script/director.  <br>This is an anime board, if you hate anime so much then go away.</br>  <br>They choose the lighting in scenes, and the color palette, and all those other little details. <br>At least that's what someone said a few days ago in a Re-Kan thread.</br></br>  <br>Most are EOPs, and only the retarded feel superior about reading the source material, others tend not to care.</br>  <br>Nice reading comprehension. I never said I didn't like watching anime</br>  How can I quit?  What the fuck is this "BD" and where did the "6 billion" meme come from?  <br>BD = bluray disk</br>  I know if you have a new one every season then she's not your waifu, but what do you call the seasonal female character you fap to?  <br>You mocked people who watched anime(on an anime board mind you) and said LNfags were better, fuck off you snake.</br>  <br>Cheating</br>  <br>No this is<br>You are dumb for believing this<br>Series with someone who does Series Composition has them as the main writer who lays down the main plot<br><br>Honestly it's extremely cute</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh no.<br>Disregard that, I was wrong as fuck.<br><br>They actually do the narrative and sort out which episodes go where like when the beach episode should come and how the plot should progress.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't generalise, there are lots of digitally animated anime from the past decade that look great.</br>  <br>You should probably learn to differentiate between posters, that wasn't me you moron</br>  Does shojo romance exist in real life?<br><br>Does sex feel as good as vanilla doujins make it seem?</br></br>  <br>They choose how much content goes on each episode (You can blame them for shitty cliffhangers), who is writting it (If the series doesn't have already someone for the script) and what this anon said </br>  <br>A few autists make who flaunt their love of anime make normal people not want to be associated with them so they don't reveal their power levels. Retards ruin it for everyone.</br>  How do anime companies decide on OP/ED? What's the process behind it?  <br> Does sex feel as good as vanilla doujins make it seem? <br>Of course it doesn't. It's idealized sex.</br></br>  Just stopping by to say I like the idea of these threads.  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?  is definitely you otherwise you wouldn't have replied by referring to yourself in first person.<br><br>Just remember where you are at you dumb LNfag, an anime and manga board, they will always take precedence over your trash "literature".</br></br></br>  <br> Does shojo romance exist in real life? <br>I used shoujo tropes to get a gf irl years ago.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wz-<wbr>PtEJEaqY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I find it really tiring. Maybe I just need more exercise.</br>  <br>Dio.</br>  <br>Nice try anon-kun but you're wrong, otherwise prove it. I'm a filthy LNfag so you'll need to be detailed for me to understand</br>  <br>Ive acted like a dark and mysterious asshole for years, but it hasnt worked.</br>  <br>You need to be handsome to pull it off.</br>  <br>How am I wrong? The only reason certain LNs gets discussed on here is because they have an anime adaptation. Remember, this is an anime and manga board so save your holier than thou attitude somewhere else.<br><br>Secondary? My ass.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean arrogant creep.<br>I doubt many anons have the ability to pull of dark and mysterious. Also you have to be attractive.</br></br>  <br>Most of Denpa Teki didn't look that nice, if you ask me.<br><br>Either way, the animation department wasn't that important for that series.</br></br></br>  <br>Am I mustard ?</br>  <br/>  <br>I've been into similar anime situations like cockblocking, running from the girl you like and accidental falling on boobs, the outcome is usually dramatic instead of being funny, sadly.</br>  <br> That's a dirty kéyboard.</br>  <br>Your fingers are literally wiping the keys ALL THE TIME.<br>How do you let this happen?</br></br>  <br>Well what? the reverse applies too, nobody would give a tsundere the time of the day if she was fat and ugly.</br>  <br>Are you possibly mad anon? Are you mad because you are too illiterate to read a book and so you get upset when someone calls you out for being the secondary you are?</br>  <br>and now you're just throwing out insults, what's the matter? Can't handle the truth?</br>  <br>I read LNs and I cringe whenever I hear someone call them books.</br>  Why is streaming bad?  <br>gotta watch your cartoons in the highest quality so you can see all the QUALITY</br>  <br>Same reason streaming music is bad</br>  <br> disgusted keions <br>more like disgusting keions</br></br>  <br>Worse quality than downloads, less control over which sub group you get to use, streaming sites are usually filled with ads, you don't get to keep the files for offline or sharing with others</br>  Why can most of the questions here be answered with a single word, that word being autism?  <br>autism</br>  <br>6billion meme is from the climax of fate/zero</br>  <br>Na, stimulation wise I find masturbation more effective. However, when you got the right girl and flow it can be amazing.</br>  <br>What's wrong anon, can't handle the fact you have shit taste?<br><br><br>It's the difference between having a plate of actual shit and a plate of real nice food in front of you. Both have the same ease of access, but you take the shit anyway because its slightly 'easier' to get</br></br></br></br>  <br>I never distinguished quality beyond 128kbps, especially when I'm listening to a purely vinyl release, so why is streaming music bad?</br>  <br>I can have shit taste all I want, it doesn't make me any less wrong about anime and manga taking precedence over LNs on this board. LNfags are the secondaries, not animefags.</br>  Why are there people who would wait for a season to be over so they can start watching the anime from said season?  <br>I seriously can't hear the difference between streaming music and non streaming at all.<br>I feel like that's essentially the same as FLAC vs mp3</br></br>  Why are this board both anime and manga ? Why don't we have a manga board so we don't have to see shitty One Piece, Naruto or Jojo threads  <br>Mùgî seems to lïke it</br>  <br>They overlap too much.</br>  <br>You don't even seem to know what the term secondary means</br>  <br>Fuck having a manga board we just need a jojo containment board</br>  <br>/a/ in a nutshell</br>  <br>So they can marathon it.<br>Some people don't like waiting week after week.<br><br>I don't get how people do it with manga though. Waiting a week for 20 pages? That's insane. Especially when there are cliffhangers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer to marathon my series, or watch it in 3-4 episode chunks.</br>  <br>Manga threads are always dead.<br>/ag/ would be a better option, but /vg/ is pure cancer.</br></br>  <br> He préfèrs Moéshît threads to thé glorious Jôjô and OP ones </br>  <br>It is correct by the context of my post.</br>  <br>éééé ~</br>  <br>Because 萌え is rendered as "moe" in roumaji. There is no "accent" on the え in もえ, unless you are pronouncing it wrong.</br>  <br> jojo containment board <br> not waifu wars containment board </br></br>  <br>whý dó yóú týpé líké thát?</br>  <br><br>I think we can stop now.</br></br>  <br><br>These arent the answers I was hoping for</br></br>  <br>Jojo is much much worse.</br>  <br>What are your thoughts on /vg/? Only wondering, it sounds like a good idea in theory.</br>  <br> Read the manga <br> Loved it <br> Go to see if they are discussing it on /a/, since there was some thread before the anime starting airing <br> Is all memes, shitty shoehorned jokes and more memes. </br></br></br></br>  <br>KissAnime usually use good subs and you can stream the file directly by using the HTML5 player</br>  <br>Chicks dig guys with accents</br>  I don't understand how people can take waifuism seriously. They aren't actually real people. It's almost as dumb as falling in love with a rock. <br><br>I can understand collecting figures and shit as a hobby, but things like hug pillows creep me out. I personally shudder when I come across waifu threads and realize that all the sweet talk is really just a circlejerk between neckbeards.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget the rampant homosexuality</br>  <br> Not knowing the power of the foreign accent </br>  <br> I can understand collecting figures and shit as a hobby <br> explain it for me please? </br></br>  <br>No it isn't moron, you aren't using the term correctly. Explain to me how you are using it right<br><br><br>Generals are a bad idea, it just invites insane amount of circlejerking</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sort of. That's /mu/ for you where you're lucky to spot two albums you recognize in a whole fucking thread. On /a/ they work discreetly as recommendation threads, and I like them for that.</br>  <br>Have you ever walked into someone's house and seen art up on their wall and nice vases and little glass figurines?</br>  <br><br>There are varying degrees as to just how seriously people consider waifuism to be. Some people are more than capable of applying whatever ideal their waifu represents onto people in the real world, with some leeway given the differences between the two. Other people really do convince themselves that they would rather take a one-sided relationship with no chance of rejection so long as that relationship was never examined in a real world context. There's an entire spectrum of people and opinions between these two ends.</br></br>  <br>Generals = Criclejerks.<br>You can discuss the main topic, but that's because you can discuss ANYTHING in a general.</br></br>  <br>Anime and manga are the primary source of discussion on this board, every else is secondary and is only allowed if it is tied to a primary source.</br>  <br>legit waifu threads on /a/ are an abomination.<br><br>Dont let them dissuade you from falling in love</br></br></br>  <br> This, tumblr doesn't post in waifu threads.</br>  <br>Streaming is bad because creators don't get shit</br>  <br>The whole point of /mu/, if you can avoid the blatant shitposting, and Death Grips fans, is to recommend albukms to others.</br>  <br> They don't get anything unless you buy the Japanese BD/DVDs.</br>  Why are there so many fucking generals in /a/ and why the fuck aren't they being deleted? <br><br>2007 killed this place. Fuck everyone who came here after that point.<br><br><br> because creators don't get shit <br>They don't get shit from nyaa, bakabt, perfect dark, share, manga down sites, etc. either.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why does /a/ hate /v/?  Can you tell me how many of these you recognize? This is in no particular order or relevance to each other.<br> It's slowly coming this way!! <br> Why does she sit like that? <br> Filthy Mexican Half-Breeds inside me <br> Nyanpasu <br> Two years worth of semen <br> Who is this semen demon <br> Junko Junkie </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that really it though? figurines are just decoration?</br>  How do you cope with the emptiness you feel right after you finish a good anime/manga/VN/whatever?  <br>Because they are the same thing but with video games instead of /a/ related content. If there is something people hate nothing more it is a mirror.</br>  <br>Yeah, they're cute decorations.</br>  <br>The age difference</br>  <br>What about fictional characters in live-action shows? Would that creep you out less? And does it make a difference if the story is in a real world, or in a fantasy one (say Game of Thrones)?</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>I turn to my other hobbies</br>  <br>They're only a degree better than /b/ or /pol/, and probably at least 10 years younger than I am</br>  <br>then why did oreimo make a big deal out of it when Ayase asked Kirino about it?</br>  <br> 2007 killed this place <br>Stay mad 2007 fag<br><br><br> They don't get shit from download sites either. <br>Yeah but you don't support Americans<br>Paying for streaming is stupid</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sit outside in the hammock with a cold drink and reflect</br>  <br> 3 <br>I'm a fucking newfag, ain't I?</br></br>  <br>cancer everywhere. some gens are worse than reddit</br>  What are some good romance/drama anime?  <br> Paying for streaming is stupid <br>So there's nothing wrong with using Kissanime then?</br></br>  <br> Stay mad 2007 fag <br>Maybe touch up on that reading comprehension.</br></br>  <br>The best thing about watching a movie drunk is rewatching it drunk like its the first time.</br>  <br>Most people on /a/ have grown out of videogames outside of series they still play for nostalgia's sake, like when a new Tales game or Final Fantasy re-release gets announced.</br>  <br>Thank fucking god for alcohol.</br>  <br> Most people on /a/ have grown out of videogames <br>Most people on /v/ did too</br></br>  <br>I usually think about it for a while. If it was really good, it'll stay on my mind for a while.<br>I don't feel empty though.</br></br>  <br> outgrown video games  <br>Just like people outgrew Taiwanese slide shows and moved onto another hobby. The reasoning is the same.</br></br>  <br>How can you even understand and enjoy things like Steins;Gate, Lain or Monogataries while drunk ?</br>  <br> Most people on /a/ have grown out of videogames <br>Anime is just cheaper. It's completely free unlike video games. I might get back into them when the 3DS is finally hacked though.</br></br>  <br>How does one "grow out of" video games? They are more adult orientated that the content discussed on our boards.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say so, a few of those seem somewhat obscure, not really age, like mexican half-breeds for example.</br>  <br> Yeah but it's only downhill on 4chan if you leave /a/. There's nowhere to go but reality once you grow out of Chinese cartoons.</br>  <br>5</br>  <br>I'm surprised you actually gave something that made actual sense. However, at this point of time, you may as well consider LN apart of the primary content, since non-anime/manga ones are allowed and are more commonly showing up.<br><br><br>People on /v/ don't actually play video games, and are just there to shitpost</br></br></br></br>  <br>Feels good to be mature.</br>  <br>It's just toys really.</br>  <br><br> Out of every anime ever, is there good writing? <br><br>Yes anon, yes there is, if only by sod's law.<br><br>I understand what you mean though. There's a middle zone between what /a/ will call edgy, moeshit, and 'forced humor/drama' where good writing exists.<br><br>  Even naruto had it, the zabuza arc being proof  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people who hate loli come here? I don't mean people who dislike it, but the people who shitpost every single loli thread and get genuinely offended by it  <br>oddly, Lain and Monogatari are 2 of the few shows Ive actually watched sober.</br>  Why do people on /a/ act so seriously and lack self-awareness?  <br>Because you lap up the bait like a bunch of starving hyenas.</br>  What is up with the no complaining about moderation rule people defend to the death. After over a decade it still doesn't make any sense. We as users created this place from code stolen and hacked by m00t and Shii; if there is a problem with moderation they need to be fucking well told to correct it. <br><br><br>How are video games toys to grow out of if anime and manga are not?</br></br></br>  <br>Because some people think this board is friendly and full of correctness just because it's the anime board.</br>  <br> since non-anime/manga ones are allowed and are more commonly showing up. <br>They really shouldn't, it breaks the first rule of /a/.</br></br>  <br>The problem is they always have "Kissanime" word in their shows</br>  How can people choose characters as their waifus who are clearly in a relationship or deeply in (requited) love with a certain character? Prime example would be Nagisa (Clannad)  <br>People who do that can be described with the C word</br>  <br>don't mind the wrong image</br>  <br>Some people like the ideal and wish the character to be happy and feel loved. My waifu isn't in such a relationship with another character but I can understand where these people might come from. <br><br>Or maybe they just self insert like 腐女. <br><br><br>Fuck off memeshitter. You clearly don't understand what cuckoldry is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> anime is more amture than games <br><br><br> games are just toys <br><br>really? I wouldn't expect such basic fallacies from you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Repetition, paying hundreds of dollars for games, consoles &amp; online memberships, waiting years for certain releases only to be disappointed by a mediocre game or have your favorite series fall into obscurity and burn out<br><br>I have a box under my bed with at least seventy games in it and I haven't played them in years</br></br></br>  <br> paying hundreds of dollars for games <br>Just like we pay for our manga and anime, right?</br></br>  <br>If you are in a love with a character who is canonically in love then you definitely are a cuck<br><br>It's almost as pathetic as people who ship characters who clearly don't love each other</br></br></br>  <br><br>I ponder it often. It'll occupy my mind for a good amount of time, and I'll search up information on it. Any unanswered questions, soundtracks, music I enjoyed from it, etc. Helps me come to terms with it.</br></br>  <br>Because videogames are dead. You get only 1 or 2 good videogames a year if you don't count indieshit.</br>  <br>Look up what cuckoldry is.</br>  <br>What are you trying to say?</br>  <br>Go back to /v/ cuckspouter</br>  <br>You can pirate all the shit, you know<br>I have spent less than 200 dollars in total on games in my life</br></br>  <br>It's allowed for the same reason manga is apart of the board really. It's pretty much intertwined with anime, so it'd be silly not to. Rules change over time, they wouldn't of and shouldn't of been allowed in 2003, but you may as well allow them now</br>  <br>That you are stupid if you think most people on /v/ pay a cent for their video games. They get them the same way we get our anime and manga.</br>  <br>cuck is the new fag, get over it<br><br><br>it's a /tv/ meme</br></br></br></br>  When did it become acceptable to blurt out the word "cuck" here on /a/?  <br> cuck is the new fag <br>No it's not. Fuck off newscum.</br></br>  <br>blame narutards</br>  Why is /a/ so allergic to posting non-anime images but posting anime or other non-related images on other boards is accepted?  <br>Don't you think that someone that is already able to treat a fictional character as their relationship partner would also have the ability to ignore part of the source material? It seems like a small leap in comparison.</br>  <br>People don't lurk anymore. <br>Younger generations are even more self entitled and immature than we were, so they cannot comprehend what it is like to respect the culture of another ingroup, and thus they barge in with their sticky fat fingers and shit the place up without caring.<br><br><br> Why is /a/ so allergic to posting non-anime images  <br>This is a new thing. We didn't have a problem with it in the past. Blame the fags who can storming in during eternal September.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hardly, most of them probably get their shit through steam<br><br><br>Never</br></br></br></br>  <br> I emulate and download all my VNs/Japanese games but there's no satisfaction in playing videogames anymore. There are a couple good recent ones like Nier but they're just not as interesting compared to when the ps2 and ps1 were around.</br>  <br> Hardly <br>Keep telling yourself that.</br></br>  <br> Junko Junkie <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br> rules change over times <br>and the present rule states<br><br><br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. <br>Remember, anime, manga and LN are three different mediums, if a LN has nothing to do with anime or manga then it should not be allowed on here otherwise you would see more none anime and manga related things popping up. There needs to be a line drawn otherwise this board's identity would be completely lost.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tumblrinas love JoJo. And it's not even that bad really; could be worse.</br>  <br>It might be a /tv/ meme, but most people that say cuck now are /v/ and /r9k/ shitters</br>  <br> There needs to be a line drawn otherwise this board's identity would be completely lost. <br>We have a general dedicated to Japanese language learning and a general dedicated to buying figurines. Moot stopped caring about this place a long time ago.</br></br>  <br>I'd put /sp/ up there too, those guys are never behind in memespouting.</br>  <br> but posting anime or other non-related images on other boards is accepted? <br><br>Because most of the other boards contain more shitposting, and 4chan is a anime website</br></br></br>  <br>After you've watched the number of anime series required to post on /a/.  aka 10 </br>  <br>Do people on here even like western games? Almost all people I've seen here only play Japanese ones.</br>  <br>You should see how butthurt people on /tv/ get when you make anime threads there</br>  <br>It's mod approved so its allowed<br><br>And Moot stopped giving a shit years ago, so why would he bother to update the rules when he was here</br></br></br>  <br> aka 10 <br>I hoped you just missed typing 0 another time.</br></br>  <br>I don't know. Since there's a lot of people who watch anime and not so much who read manga, the anime adaptation did more harm than good, IMO. All those fucking idiot filling the JoJo threads in unbearable. And JoJofags are like Darksouls fags: they believe than everything is related, like how meny people believe that Dark Souls is everywhere, like the other day i was watching Holy Diver on Youtube and there was some fags who said that the video was literally Dark Souls. Fuck i'm pissed</br>  <br>A false positive.</br>  I always wanted to watch gundam, but I don't know where should I start<br>Should I just watch them on chronological order of release?</br>  <br>You shouldn't bother</br>  <br>Also a weekly and a weekend general dedicated to drawing, a general dedicated to exhentai, a general about voice actors, a general dedicated to yuru yuri/madoka which is nothing but tripfags and may-as-well-be tripfags posting the same shit over and over barely tangential to the source material.</br>  <br>more like 0<br>all you need is chinese cartoons in your life.</br></br>  <br>First of all, the cost of consoles<br>I know for a fact not even the Wii U can't run backups yet. I don't know about the PS4 and xbox one, but they're usually more on their ame than nintendo, so if the wiiu can't they most likely can't either.<br>Even if so, you can't play on multiplayer if your game is pirated most of the time.<br>And even if you go with the PC route and don't worry about multiplayer you still have to have a good computer with a good graphics card that you have to update everyone once in a while if you don't want to always be 3-4 years behind<br><br>Compared to anime/manga where I can get the full experience of it on a toaster for free, with the most minimum of fiddling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is drawing anime characters, reading doujinshi related to the industry, voice actors of anime, and Yuri Yuri and Madoka not anime and manga related?</br>  <br>Don't let the retarded fans ruin your own fun. But honestly, I never liked JoJo that much nor Dark Souls so I can't really empathize.</br>  <br> First of all, the cost of consoles <br>Emulate shit.<br><br> you still have to have a good computer with a good graphics card <br>Fuck you're stupid.<br><br> where I can get the full experience of it on a toaster <br>Ha, no. You are getting a shitty experience on a shit screen with terrible sound. <br><br><br>They are less related to anime and manga than light novels are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The harm was done the instant the anime was announced and hundreds of chuckleheads read the manga just so they could bitch at animefags for not reading the manga</br>  Pretty sure the whole '/a/ doesn't play Western games' is a myth.<br><br>A substantial portion of this board plays MOBAs, especially Dota. A quick search in the archives, and you'll see that /a/ actually talks way more about Western games than it should.</br></br>  <br> Compared to anime/manga where I can get the full experience of it on a toaster for free, with the most minimum of fiddling. <br> implying I don't have a 3000€+ home cinema to get the full experience  <br>I just can't enjoy anime on a tiny screen with headphones.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to ravage your innocent boipussi</br>  Why are self-described anime fans so autistic? No one who is really into music or film goes around acting like a fucking idiot. Not to mention, it seems like they have no understanding or idea of what constitutes good art. They're so wrapped up with their cartoons that they have zero perspective.<br><br>Why is anime writing so fucking atrocious?</br></br>  <br> MOBAs, especially Dota <br>Funny because /v/ hates these and they are discussed only on /vg/</br></br>  <br> Dota <br>But League is the game with the animu girls.</br></br>  <br> Some probably do the pvp online stuff but I can only think of three western games I have saved.<br> Eternal Darkness<br>Banjo-Kazooie<br>Metroid Prime<br/></br></br> </br></br>  What the fuck is 'chuuni' and why do I hear it almost as much as the word 'cuck'?  <br>I wouldn't know, the only time I go to /sp/ is for world cup and Olympics banter</br>  <br> How is drawing anime characters <br>We have a board for drawing.<br> reading doujinshi <br>No, PORN. Sad panda threads are porn threads. We already have boards for that.<br> voice actors of anime <br>3DPD belongs on /jp/. <br> Yuri Yuri and Madoka <br>They don't discuss the source material and ゆゆ threads are bumped just to be kept alive. It is a cirlcejerk using the source as an excuse. I'm not kidding; those two generals post the same things day in day out, as though it were computer automated using scripts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/v/ has a noticeably younger userbase</br>  <br><br>/pol/ is also partially to blame for this.</br></br>  <br>Google<br>http://www.urbandictionary.com/defi<wbr>ne.php?term=Chuunibyou</wbr></br></br>  <br>Now you're just being new.</br>  <br><br>At least those people aren't pompous like LNfags are.</br></br>  <br><br>It's weird, but I've always thought that anime fans usually have a lower socio-economic status than, say, patrons of music or cinema.<br><br>I think anime writing is shit because its audience only looks for cheap entertainment to pass the time. There is good writing here and there, but yea, anime is a lower-tier form of entertainment.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No it doesn't. You're delusional. <br><br><br>Fuck off secondary trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So pompous.</br>  Do preople here have stereotypical weeaboo music taste and listen to Animu OSTs, Jpop, Vocaloids and nightcore remixes on YouTube or do you listen to something else?<br><br><br>Anime is lower form of art</br></br></br>  <br><br> not knowing what chuuni is </br></br>  <br>You must be a newfag or just socially inept, which you would expect from /v/</br>  <br>Goddamn it.</br>  <br>I watched it on a stream back in like 2010 with /a/.

Do you not need a good graphic card? Are you fucking retarded? A brand new computer flat out couldn't run Sonic Generations back when it came out because the graphics card wasn't some high end Nvidia shit or something like that. However, I was able to watch seasonal anime on it just fine, long after too.<br><br> where I can get the full experience of it on a toaster <br>It doesn't slow down, and it doesn't affect the content. All you have to do is connect it to a TV, and there you have it. Nearly the same quality everyone else in Japan is watching at that moment. All on Intel integrated graphics. Of course this is assuming you're not watching streams or horriblesubs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I listen to 99% anime OSTs and vocaloid. Have a good number of songs with Japanese singers though (Jap opera is really nice to listen to for example). No nightcore because it sounds shit, and some classical/intrumental music but not much.</br>  <br> Animu OSTs, Jpop <br>Just these two. Nothing else.</br></br>  <br> all those fedoracore music genres </br>  <br>Fuck no animu OST is one of the worst</br>  <br>I can only speak for myself, but I do occasionally listen to OSTs and got about 400ish GB of Japanese music, but only a small portion of that is j-pop. I can't stand nightcore and I rarely listen to vocaloid, although I've come across some stuff I enjoy every now and then.</br>  <br>Because most people watch anime just for the entertainment aspect<br><br><br> pompous <br>You're acting like as if the majority of /a/ don't act like elitist pompous cunts on the board. You're just cherry picking here because you don't like LN, you stupid secondary faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I listen to mostly K-Pop. I'm sure that a lot of /a/ is into K-Pop as well... r-right? </br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br> nightcore remixes on YouTube <br>I never got that shit.<br> DEY SOUND LIKE BIG EYED ANIMAY GURLS XD <br>No they fucking don't. They just sound like fucking squirrels, and the music is just fucking sped up. There is nothing good about nightcore. It is possibly the worst music genre there is.<br>I'd rather listen to a 5 hour recording of farts, water dripping in a cave, and a guy scratching a black board. Fuck nightcore.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of /a/ are arrogant yes but they for the most part know their place, LNfags are a bunch of /lit/ rejects who thinks they are literary connoisseurs.</br>  <br> Point me to the ps4 emulators please <br>Point me to the PS3 emulators first, nigga.</br></br>  <br>because it is the greatest show of all time</br>  <br>K-Pop<br>You should go to /mu/, they have constant general and everyone except kpop fgas ahtes them</br></br>  <br> K-Pop <br>Yeah, no.</br></br>  <br> water dripping in a cave <br><br> Aube - Le Syndrome Aquatique (2008) [320] <br> ambient <br> musique concrete <br> recordings of things related to... water <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!MYdSwQSA!EsUkf<wbr>iBdcwQaEiDWqoSc150JtFc-GL6shVS35uqD<wbr>j8I<br><br><br>don't knock it till you try it</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> if you don't count indieshit <br>Why not count indie games?<br>Do you not count anime made by smaller studios (i.e Boku no Pico) in the general amount of good anime ever made?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I listen to what I enjoy hearing.

I will check it out. </br></br>  <br>You know what.<br>I'll take the  plunge .</br></br>  <br>Considering /a/ has unironic Naruto, KlK and SAO threads I think my estimate of 10 is more realistic.</br>  <br> Intel integrated graphics <br>You may as just well watch it on vlc<br><br><br> literary connoisseurs <br>Now you are just cherry picking. Besides the obvious illiterate retard, most people will agree with you that LNs are shit.

If anything, I see more people criticize him</br>  <br> sao16.5,better not. </br>  <br>I don't even think you need to watch the shows to discuss them.<br><br>Shows with little substance, like Hestia, are especially prone to this. Spamming memes like 'Hestia is Bestia' will get replies regardless whether you watched the show or not.<br><br>I remember when Oreimo was airing and I was shitposting about Kuroneko like any other. Haven't watched a single episode, ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't get why /a/ hates K-Pop, and yet is obsessed over stuff like LL and @. <br><br>K-Pop is basically real versions of those shows, but with much better choreography and quality music. Sure, both sides are full of creepy fans, but K-Pop can't be that bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I mean that's just being a shitposter then...</br>  <br>Haven't felt like that since ages. I used to just start a new series or rewatch the one the one that made me feel that way.</br>  Why does /a/ hate MAL so much?  <br>There are actual people who aren't interested in 3D children but 2D loli.<br>Seriously, 3D children are ugly as fuck (okay, they aren't ugly, but that can't be called beautiful either), how can people like them?</br></br>  Am I in the minority when I say after ~6 on and off years of watching seasonal shows, funposting, shitposting and more with /a/, that I still really enjoy the board with its 'culture' and still find anime fun and exciting to watch?  <br>Because 3D stars are ugly, while 2D idols are cute</br>  <br> quality music </br>  <br>Actually consoles are already 1-2 years behind PCs in terms of technology when they come out.</br>  <br>Only a very select few like idolshit. I'm sure those people like k-poop too.</br>  <br>What differentiates an anime plot from a "normal" plot?</br>  <br>the community</br>  If by any chance Yukino gets rejected, how well would she take it compared to Yui? Would she despair, or would she take it like a champ?

I'm running out of dimensions here.</br>  <br>It's a logical conclusion. Why would she want Yukino to face her feelings and make her life more difficult when she could just confess (actually confess, not the roundabout retard confessional Yui does every few episodes) and be on her way.</br>  <br>What;s with this OP?<br>Well, here.<br>Velocity of Yukino will be given by root(2gh).<br>=&gt;root(2x10x40)<br>Whatever will stop her should produce enough force to absorb the momentum of Yukino and to positive work against gravity to take her to Haruno.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If 8man told Yukino to jump off a bridge, would she do it?</br>  <br>8MAN DIDN'T FLIRT WITH HER</br>  LN and animefag here, am I the only one who didn't get the last 15minutes of the episode?<br><br>Literally what were they talking about?</br></br>  <br>No, why do you think that?<br><br>Also,<br><br> Yui's look of disappointment <br><br>That's also what I've got from her expression. She never thought that Yukinon would fell this low.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well she knows she can't win from the start. Even before the 8bowl, she just know she can't won again the two (in the president election), that's partly the reason she went confess to Hayama even though her feeling wasn't for him. She purposely avoids her feeling for 8man because she think it won't bear fruit.<br>Remember why she always complaining 8man is the sly one instead? It's because she can't help falling for 8man actions.<br><br>You can see that Iroha is a complex character.  No who am I kidding here, her behavior is so typical for a highschool girl, nothing deep at all. <br><br>Sometime you know by your heart that something probably never works, but can't stop striving for it.<br><br> Like we Irohafags wishing her to win, we know it is futile, but just can't help it. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forget "if they knows it would be very troublesome". So Iroha and 8man acknowledge that it would be bad if Yui and Yukino know about it, but still do it anyway.  NTR at its finest.  </br>  <br>Vaguely talking about winning 8manb owl, I think.

I think Yukino herself finally realize how shitty herself is, that is why she decided to come clean and finally to decide request something from both of them.</br></br>  <br>Unless he's watching Horrible. I don't think they bothered translating the display board.</br>  <br>because best girl never wins</br>  Any prediction of what is it going to be?  <br>You didn't get the translation, or just not getting it?<br><br>Penguins choose a mate for life, stay with them forever, yada yada.

Would be hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>wow, so mad. www</br>  <br> Yukino being a cunt for no reason at all just to be a cunt <br>God I wish she would be killed off in some painful manner.</br></br>  Are dubs not special anymore?  <br>Everyone calling Yukino gonna win because:<br>1) They factor Main Heroine's plot armor<br>2) The damsel in distress set up<br>3) This whole major arc is specifically about her and her family<br>4) Whether or not Japanese ready for non-#1 heroine winning<br>5)  They never consider 8man's character nor Yui's major events throughout S2  <br>6)  They didn't read the LN </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is 8man observant and understanding enough to what Yui just pulled? Will he finally recognize her efforts and true feelings?</br></br>  <br> They delayed the subs for this </br>   Yui didnt confess because she wants them to stay like they are. <br> Yukino didnt confess because shes autistic <br><br>Is this right?</br></br></br>  <br>Best possible end</br>  <br>+1</br>  <br>Check 8man reactions to Yukino. It is pretty obvious that he has something for her.</br>  <br>That 3p date was actually looks fun. I was unable to hide my grin  though it was painful seeing Yui sinking her own ship one hole at a time ;_; </br>  <br> www <br>www what? That's not even a proper url you fucking idiot.</br></br>  <br>Daughteruzoned?</br>  <br> 6)   They didn't read the LN <br><br>Reaction like what, anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>wwwwwwwwwww</br>  <br> mfw watching the episode as a Yuifag </br>  <br>Are you implying that Hachiman blushing and getting flustered when Yukino does something is anime-only?</br>  <br>it's called banter mate, and you obviously can't take it, stick with your moeblob</br>  <br>(笑)</br>  <br>8man has feelings for both girls, it's been thoroughly established so take your antagonism elsewhere.<br><br><br>I know brother, but the real battle has only just begun, so keep the faith.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't that bad for me. We've known Yukino was going to win for awhile now, but with this episode we see that Yui is unquestionably the best girl. 8man just didn't choose her.</br>    <br> Are we getting another season?!?!?</br>  <br>No<br><br>8man was blushing and getting flustered wasn't exclusive to Yukino only.<br><br><br>Calm down, m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Whether or not Japanese ready for non-#1 heroine winning <br><br>I don't get this. Surely Yuifags, Irohafags, and others outnumber the amount of Hachiyuki shippers. Yui and even Iroha aren't lagging that far behind Yukino in terms of popularity.</br></br></br>  what is this feeling? why do I want yui to win?  <br>Yui with Iroha's strong personality would have won this bowl before the end of S1.<br><br>Even Iroha would have already won this bowl if she wasn't cynically waiting to see if there's still chance with Hayato before going full in on the second best choice.</br></br></br>  Fuck Yukino and Yui.<br><br> YUI'S MOM A BEST</br></br>  <br>She's been showing strength, courage, determination, warmth and care throughout S2. And having plenty of major events in which at least 3 of them are 1:1 adaptation.<br><br> FEEL is a Yuifag </br></br></br>  <br>Yui is the most popular. Just look at all the yahallo threads and the full size figs that Yui get.<br>That kono sugoi or whatever has a very sample size in comparison. Only like 400+ votes.<br><br>Even some random poll has a bigger sample size.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Even Iroha would have already won this bowl if she wasn't cynically waiting to see if there's still chance with Hayato before going full in on the second best choice. <br><br>Iroha is on the assumption (not that wrong though) that there's something between 8man and the two girls in the Service club. Even right now there is high chance that she would be rejected (or got blocked by double YY before she can do anything)</br></br></br>  <br> take your antagonism elsewhere </br>  Is it me or does it seem like Yukino is in love with 8man?  <br> ?!?!? <br/></br>  <br>For a moment there I was about to ask why the same character got two places.<br><br>Good thing they actually have different hair colours.</br></br></br>  Is this why subs took so long?  <br> She has been in love with Hayama </br>  <br>yes</br>   Says he doesn't play fair <br> Does nothing but play fair and encourage Yukino to stop being an autismical cunt and step up her game <br>Yui is a goddamn angel.<br><br>I never really rooted for any girl in this show and was just in for 8man antics, but now I guess I'll have to settle my horse in the Yuifag ranch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what happened in the last episode of the anime?<br><br>I don't understand shit<br>What was Yui wanted to do that 8man was not OK with it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>8-man strikes again</br>  <br> threesome. 8man is known for have poor stamina. </br>  MOVE THE FUCK OVER BLONDY<br>WE GOT OURSELVES A NEW EDGE MASTER</br>  <br>She is the chosen one<br>Yui-ham</br></br>  <br>Hayama x Yui OTP</br>  <br> &gt;Yui didnt confess because she wants them to stay like they are. <br>she confess when she gave the cookies to him, or was that not a metaphor?</br></br>  <br>"Just fuck my shit up"</br>  <br>Confirmed: Yukino -&gt; 8man -&gt; Hayama -&gt; Yui -&gt;  cookies man </br>  <br>Yui did what she did to have 8man push Yukino into solving her own problems by herself.</br>  <br>You sure she's that clever?</br>  <br>Hayama only loves Yukino-chan</br>  <br>For stuff that deals with emotions, yes.</br>  <br>Not the person you're responding to but it's pretty obvious she was pressuring Yukino to MAKE A FUCKING MOVE.<br><br>The day before with getting her to give cookies and then making a bullshit proposal that ALMOST went through.</br></br></br>  <br>She might not be the brightest academically, but as a true normalfag she is quick to pick up stuff when it comes to human relationships.</br>  Season 3 inbound right?  <br>I believe</br>  <br>thanks for sharing this, assured me on what I was thinking the whole thing was about...</br>    as much of a yukinofag i am, i am grateful for yui's existence  Pic so fucking related. Hyoudou-sama also wants something genuine.  <br>this is going to be like WA all over again!</br>  <br>Must feel bad to like a girl who literally does nothing but be an autist and suffer from muh princess syndrome.</br>  <br>Setsuna plays dirty.<br>Yui is literally handicapping herself by bringing Yukino along.</br></br>  <br>The less butthurt that Yukino will be the more likely Yui gets to keep Yukino as a friend if she wins the 8bowl.</br>  <br>Who said Yui = Setsuna?</br>  <br>OVA around 2019.</br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  What happened in this episode? I dont get it<br><br>Do they both like 8man but dont want to do anything because they like their friendship?</br></br>  What is this face trying to convey  <br>You'd have to be an incredibly dense person to not notice that.</br>  <br>It looks kinda creepy. It's a fucked-up smile, I think?</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>She pissed herself</br>  So this is the reason why we couldn't get subs yesterday?<br>Fuck you, Commie.</br>  <br>"want some dick?"</br>  <br>She is smiling because she is supposed to. The fact the she is crying is because the thought of having a superficial relationship with both of them is painful and she really doesn't want that.<br><br>Is Orimoto going to show up again?</br></br></br>  wow, it's fucking nothing<br><br>how can my self-insert show be this underwhelming</br></br>   Yui requests the group stay together in a frozen state of 'friendship' otherwise she'll claim 8man like some sort of fucking succubus demon and destroy everything else <br><br>I got the greatest boner ever, she's fucking wicked man. Totally bonertastique.</br></br>    <br> he doesn't know how OVAs work </br>  <br> wow yuigahama-san will make all of my problems go away what an angel </br>  <br> she see's the 8inch </br>  Disregard daughter, acquire okaa-san  <br>She in verge of being a yandere.</br>  <br>I disagree with the fact she gave up on the 8 bowl. Read her diary.</br>  <br> Yukimom will never win the 8bowl </br>  What's Yui's solution?<br><br>What's 8man's request?<br><br>sorry, I'm dumb please spoonfeed</br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like it, she becomes downcast the second anyone even speaks to 8man.<br><br>This fake shit won't hold dude, no fuckin way. Not honmono at all.</br></br></br>  Why is Yukino so in love with 8man all of the sudden? A few episodes she told him to fuck off and showed no concern for him.  <br>Give her the dick.</br>  <br>8mans request is for everyone to stop suppressing their feelings and forcing themselves to act differently or some shit. Genuine.<br><br>Yui's solution is more of a bomb threat, if she doesn't get her ransom of a group friendship she's going to detonate  8mans dick into her womb. </br></br></br>  <br>She's an autist and doesn't know how to express her feelings.<br><br>She's like him since season 1, that why she said they couldn't be friends.</br></br></br>  Threadly reminder that Yui is into kink and that makes her best girl.  For someone who doesn't play fair Yui sure is doing all of Yukino's character developmment  <br>To everyone asking, please browse the thread. This is a good analysis.<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>Consider suicide.</br></br>   Hallo Alone <br> Yui ballade version <br> Those lyrics <br><br>FUCK YOU FEEL, FUCK YOU WATARI</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I disagree with is <br> b) Yui provides a bullshit conclusion to their issues in the hopes that Yukino speaks up and turns it down because it would be disingenuous <br><br>I think Yui was aware that Yukino, in her current state of mind, wouldn't be able to do that. I think she was expecting Hachiman to interfene. Other than that, yes, this is exactly it.</br></br></br></br>  how the fuck do people like this shit. it's nothing but fucking melodrama &gt;omg is so deep like a ferris wheel going around without getting anywhere  Don't know if anyone noticed this  So. Why did Gahama wait a year before thinking of doing cookies for the guy who saved her dog? Why did Yukino never turn up at the hospital to see Hikki?  <br>The opening was more entertaining than the entire season has been</br>  now its just up for best boy to take home the cup  <br>Yukino was shaking her head about not giving the cookies, because she felt that it wasn't appropriate to interrupt Yui's moment.</br>  This episode made me realise just how much I hate Yukino<br>Anyone should win but her</br>  <br>Wow aren't you a master detective.</br>  <br> watching shitty OP <br>Not like you have anything better to do.</br></br>  <br>This is 100% foreshadowing. Not kidding. It shows a lot about Yukino's state of mind.</br>  So, we have 3 possible endings.<br><br>The most likely and also worst ending is that Yukino will develop, solve her problems in her own way while getting help from 8man, and become genuine for 8man.<br><br>Less likely but a slightly better ending will be friendship ending. They become a genuine and happy friend group forever.<br><br>The least likely and by far the best would be an Iroha end, where Yui and Yukino stumble around and create drama while Iroha steadily claims 8man. Komachi never meets her until the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> where Yui and Yukino stumble around and create drama <br> best end <br><br>I'm not even YYfag, but you're fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br>   No Yurigahama end   So what were the moon runes in the other thread all about? All i see is something about iroha but no one ever says what it means.<br><br>Anyone give a rundown?</br></br>  <br>Both of them are basically keeping secret from double YY.</br>  <br>a u t i s m<br><br>Yui is too good for this show.</br></br></br>  <br> they don't know that 8man already got choco and cookies from Iroha. <br> they don't know that 8man is keeping it a secret because she asked <br><br>It'll be too late if things keep going like this.<br> they don't know he flirted with her <br> they don't know that he went full dere dere trying not to fall for her over the cookies </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would they do that? 8man should be genuine and tell them everytime he has interacted with a girl since he met them.</br>  <br> Irohafags being this delusional <br><br>It's just another one of her scenes where 8man just brushes her off. Anything you could have derived from that scene is pure shipping on your part.</br></br></br>  This is the face of a winner.  My heart aches for unknown reason right now  <br>8man doesn't need to tell them shit about what he does with other girls. <br>They're not his owners or parents.</br></br>  Why does Yukino dress like a delinquent from a shounen manga  Which volumes does S2 cover?  What is this face trying to convey?  <br>I am sure they would be very interested and it would improve their bond.</br>  Any thoughts about which will be Yukino's request? And where does this leave the "help me someday"? (8man hasn't helped her, right?)  <br> Yukino, I am disappoint </br>  <br>Ever considered making money out of your sharp instincts?</br>  <br> He's literally thinking something among the lines of "If I was my older self, I'd have already fallen for her act" <br> brushing her off <br><br>Oh, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Gahamama knows about the 8man, does Gahadad know too?<br><br><br>7-11</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dat shaking hand when giving 8man cookies <br><br>My heart shattered to pieces  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Gahadad is too busy checking dem Yuis</br>  <br>Did you see her feet shaking as well?</br>  <br>That's him saying the he's wisened up and this bitch aint gonna win.<br><br>Thanks for being supportive.</br></br></br>  <br>Rather it's something like if he was his older self, he'd already (be in love with/fallen for) her.<br>He's struggling really hard this volume.</br></br>  <br>What is THIS face trying to convey?</br>  Why is Hiratsuka in the reflection. Creepy  Is Yui secretly Jeff Seid on the internet?  <br>Weren't those Yukino's feet?</br>  <br>I'm still not sure whether 8man is fucking sure that yuigahama likes him, or some sort of mental gymnastics is running through his head on how no one could possibly like him that way.</br>  <br>Thanks~ That said, I can't count 5 arcs in this season...</br>  Yuis cookies are moist and sticky.  <br>Doesn't matter, just let them keep their shitty drama to themselves.</br>  <br>8man wants to stick it in the pooper</br>  <br> You said it was 8 cm, no 8 inches </br>  <br>Two people realizing that they both want something both of them can't have at the same time.</br>  I've never taken part of this stupid shipfag wars, i always liked more Yukino since is the typical anime girl that I like, specially in the first season...<br><br><br>but, fuck Yui has been so much better during the whole season. Yukino has literally done nothing, just the typical damsel in distress that does nothing and has no personality.<br><br>Really hope they make Yukino grow in the next season if she's gonna win, because right now I don't see any reason to.</br></br></br></br></br>  here's a thought......why doesn't everyone just fucking tell each other how they fucking feel like any normal teenagers would.....show fucking over  Guys I noticed something.  <br> ..... <br>Heh, nothing personell.</br></br>  <br>No, they must know how Iroha interacts with him in private. They must know how he once felt about Orimoto and how he has been talking to her recently.<br><br><br>And have a funny fish flavor to them.</br></br></br></br>  Do harem's like this exist irl? Having girls call you to go to an aquarium must be fun ;_;  <br>That's because she added whey for dem mad gains </br>  <br>Everyone did, why don't you join <br><br><br> like any normal teenagers would <br>I guess you can't wait for puberty to come?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8man is a man of reasons. Human's heart is simply not his forte, whether his or others'<br><br>Somehow, I got the gist that 8man knew what's up with the girls and himself but he wasn't very definite on what it was.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying Yukino will ever lose her dependency issue <br>And 8man will still choose her because of cliches.</br></br>  <br> Tobe's confession <br> stuco election <br> Christmas event <br> Marathon <br> St Valentin </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>And they're the delusional ones.</br>  <br> not being /8maninhighschool/ <br>laughingwhores.jpg</br></br>  Haruno is a Goddess and not the Devil.<br><br>Haruno motives are flawed and her words have ambiguity and/or questionable but it doesn't make Haruno the villian of Oregairu. There shouldn't exist any antagonism directed at Haruno; she believe her method is efficient.<br><br>So, what is the difference between Hachiman telling Yukino to solve her own problems and Haruno saying the same words? It seem to me you anons conveniently want to associate a character as the villian.<br><br>Every Oregairu character are cunts, not only Haruno.<br><br>Please treat Haruno kindly and do not dehumanize Haruno. She is still a human afterall.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I went with girls to an aquarium a few months ago.<br><br>The fish were much more interesting.<br><br>I pretty much don't contact them anymore because i don't give a fuck. My videogame backlog is already too huge for me to waste time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tobe's confession and (esp.) marathon were really short!</br>  Yukinon is such a fucking shit holy fuck<br>Why is she so god damn useless</br>  <br>I don't see anything wrong in the post you linked.</br>   gay marriage is a right <br> polyamorous relationships still shunned <br><br>The 3 of them will never be happy at this rate</br></br></br>  So both Yui and Yukino are in love with the same guy? Isn't that going to cause problems on the road ahead?  <br>Exactly.<br><br><br>Haruno is trying to force development on a bunch of high schoolers because she wasn't allowed any freedom when she was that age.<br><br>It's understandable, but still pathetic. If she wasn't a cunt in going about it, i wouldn't feel sad for her, but with her attitude, its clear she's desperate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  so at the end of the last episode, was yui talking about the fact that she and yukinon are both in love with hachiman and how they are gonna resolve it?<br><br>did i get this right i'm usually dense about this sort of stuff</br></br>  <br> Let's see </br>  <br> So both Yui and Yukino are in love with the same guy?  <br>Congratulations, you've figured out the mystery from the first episode of season 1.</br></br>  <br>8man won't choose any of them. 1 way straight to friendship route.</br>  Seriously, this was so painful to watch  <br> Gay marriage is a right <br> polyamorous relationships still shunned <br> The 3 of them will never be happy at this rate <br><br>THIS. Fuck the world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because throughout her childhood -&gt; her early teen years she's had no one to help her grow emotionally. It's almost like you didn't watch the show.</br>  <br>8man should slam his 8 into her. It would probably take all of the bite out of her.<br><br>Seriously though, Haruno probably has her own demons.<br><br><br>Neither Yui nor Yukino were in love with him. It took Yui up to EP 6 S2 to fall in love and Yukino only did in EP 10 S2<br><br><br>That is obvious, they are mistaken on what genuine actually is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think yukino just started liking him this season though.<br><br>1st season 8man was just solving problems and yui suffering.</br></br></br>  <br>Read the fucking thread!</br>  <br>women are jealous whores, polygamy would never work.</br>  <br>They can convert to Muslim.</br>  <br>Why do you need someone to help you grow emotionally? What does that even mean? Just because you didn't have any friends doesn't mean you have to rely on others for everything and not make any decision yourself</br>  Oh god, this was so fucking awful, holy shit. It was just like one of the old DBZ movies with a filler villain. Seriously, they didn't even need to make it Freezer, as they barely used his previous relationships with the other characters beyond "guy who wants revenge on Goku".<br><br>But wait, at least the old movies usually had some cool fights. Pretty much every fight scene in this one was uninspired and derivative. I lost count of how many times they did the old 'dash-in and punch to the gut' thing, and that's off the top of my head. It felt like every single fight choreography was just copypasted from scene of the tv series.</br></br>  <br>How about I just knock you flat on your ass you trool.</br>  <br>how the fuck are you even surprised when the first movie was garbage as well? <br><br> hurrr durr you must make 5 super saiyans hold hands to go super saiyan god <br> the 5th super saiyan is a fucking fetus <br><br>it's fucking tragic how poorly written this garbage is</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He would have kicked vegeta's shit in if he went ssj3 he just didn't because he didn't want to hurt vegeta's feelings.</br>  <br><br>KNOW YOUR FUCKING PLACE, TACO NIGGER.</br></br>  You should be able to solve this  That's just a bunch of mumbo jumbo  <br>Aren't you supposed to post things that are impossible to solve for this stupid meme?</br>  D-Dick.  <br> basic trigonometry <br> bunch of mumbo jumbo </br></br>  mfw Nube manga still not completely translated  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>How do I solve the small one?</br>  http://anichart.net/summer<br>Looks like it's backlog season</br>  Massive shit taste detected.<br><br>It's a good season already just between S2s and adaptations.</br></br>  <br><br> Non Non Biyori <br> Working!!! <br><br>What else do you want?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Backlog season was this season</br>   new season of SOMEWAN WAN WAN <br> new season of G-G-G-G-G-GATCHAMAAAAN <br> City Hunter OVA <br> Adventures of Burrito and Salad <br><br>Looks fine to me, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Non Non Biyori and Umaru are about the only things I know I'll watch. Maybe Gangsta.</br></br>  Is Akagami no Shirayukihime a Reimei no Arcana ripoff or is it the other way around? Either way, do you think it might not be shit?  <br>No, seriously, this season has both a lot of stuff that should actually be good(Drrr, Prisma Illya, Gakkou Gurashi, Gangsta, Gatchaman, God Eater, NNB, Working) as well as stuff that probably won't be good but is based on shit /a/ loves for some reason(Umaru-chan, JWWW, Prison School, Monster Musume) and a lot of stuff that can turn out either way. <br><br>If you think this is a bad season in any way or form you probably don't actually like anime.</br></br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>durarara is shit</br>  <br> tfw too many shows i cant watch at noon due to fasting month </br>   6 days <br> 6 volumes <br><br>Tonight, enemies turned ally; ally turned enemy.</br></br></br>  <br>Vol 1: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126090820 <br>Vol 2: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126134576 <br>Vol 3: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126170387 <br>Vol 4: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126210675 <br>Vol 5: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126301935 <br>Vol 6: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126350748 <br>Vol 7: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126350748 <br>Vol 8: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126398685 <br>Vol 8.5: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126439797 <br>Vol 9: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126451940  <br>Vol 10: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126479736  <br>Vol 11: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126492070  <br>Vol 12: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126580717  <br>Vol 13: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126625015  <br>Vol 14: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126669133 <br>Vol 15: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126716477 <br>Vol 16: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126751816  <br>Vol 17: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126782614 <br>Vol 18: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126815333 <br>Vol 19: <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126899624 <br>Vol 20: <br>Vol 21: <br>Vol 22: <br>Vol 23: <br>Vol 24: <br>Vol 25:  <br>Vol 26: <br>Vol 27: </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      I am reading it.        OP you are hero. Keep up good work.    <br> I've to say I was dissapointed that Ushio only used stone armor modidifed by scientists. I wanted some GATTAI between armors during last fight. </br>  <br><br>Nice to know. Hope you're enjoying it.<br><br><br>Thanks. Also, Hero is the name of the ed of the show. Just putting it out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yeah, honestly the armor didn't do shit. It's jsut a nice callback to the first enemy they fought.  </br></br>        <br> At least it didn't turn into enemies like Tora's armor/past wield users. It was also nice showing what would happen if Ushio managed to beat HnM while being drunk on rage and hate. HnM would just be reborn.<br>Somehow I get reminded of FFX from it, even though in spira it was repeated many times.</br> </br>  I am now worried how are they going to adapt all of these into 24 episodes.  <br> Net's shitting up again </br>  <br><br>39 eps supposedly. Let me look for my predictions</br></br>    <br> 39 episodes <br><br>Thank god.

I'm not saying we'll get one, just that the material is pretty perfect for it.<br><br> New character introduced who leaves after her arc <br> Somewhat a love interest <br> Has an agenda not related nor affects the main plot but has some degree of relation to it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>            <br> "oneechan has given me su much!" <br> picture of Mayuko's exerted face sweating profusely <br>kids have dirty minds.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually A Journey not Homeward is just one chapter but the point is that third cour probably won't cut any arcs compared to the first and second one considering it'd have 2 eps per volume,</br></br>        <br> that face <br>is Ushio slowly transforming into King Diamond?</br></br>  <br>There is no way no one noticed this.</br>  <br>*didn't notice</br>                                      <br>One of my favourite pages.</br>        <br><br>I can't believe this<br>but he helped aganist Hakumom, that makes zero sense</br></br></br>    <br><br>It's explained later. Sort of.</br></br>        <br>It gets explained later. You shouldn't expect an explaination about a single event that caused everything like in Hyou' story, though. It's more a matter of personality.</br>    <br><br>To be fair, it really comes out of left field.<br><br>Also, I can't remember but was it really Hakumen who turned the sect into stone or was it just them doing that to defend from HnM's bullshit or to ready themselves?</br></br></br></br>            <br>Jie Mei have a 2P color palette?<br>this means tht every ex-barrier maiden can join in co-op?</br></br>    <br><br>That's HnM. I guess?</br></br>      <br>Can't be otherwise, my d̶i̶c̶k̶ spear is resounding to her</br>    <br>S U P E R<br><br>L E G I T</br></br></br>  You can't trust those eyes man.<br>Also<br> Trusting some random ghost chick. </br></br>    <br> Is this the face of a liar? </br>  <br> mfw Kanahana could still voice HnM!Jie Mei <br>I guess it was a good casting choice after all.</br></br>        <br>So it looks like they knew the question to my earlier question all along.</br>  So they were developing brain barriers just at the right time HnM started to delete save files? that's a bit too convenient  <br>So my guess was right. Man, they could've given Ushio a heads up or something? <br><br>I mean, even a note like "Ushio, people will forget you. Stay strong. Pops" would've sufficed.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah. But hey, they're geniuses so I guess they'd notice or something.</br></br>    <br> To be fair, it really comes out of left field. <br><br>  Well, I think it wasn't planned from the beginning, but It's ok in this context: it's the story of an alienated genius who acted like a good member of the sect (or, even better, of the society) only because He didn't have a more satisfactory way of using his out of scale abilities , then Hakumen makes him realize how He's still unsatisfied (the wind). Personally, I like this kind of story of alienated genius, like Kazama's story in Ping Pong, and like some NisioIsion's characters.  <br><br>  I can't remember but was it really Hakumen who turned the sect into stone or was it just them doing that to defend from HnM's bullshit or to ready themselves? <br><br>  The latter. It's basically the same reason of the stone Azafuse.  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, will Hakumen no Mono after using the power of technology transform into  Hakumen no Stereo ?</br>    <br>He's trusting his daughter more than anything else, and a ghost being creepy isn't that stange.</br>  <br> They turned to stone themselves to protect their memories. </br>  <br>Middle page panel looks like a progressive rock album cover</br>  <br><br>Yeah it's surprisingly deep but if you've only read till this part, you'd be surprised. Wish they did show more signs.</br></br>    <br>Well, HnM has brainwashed minds since the first volumes, they had enough time to develop that.</br>          <br>  looks like a progressive rock album cover <br><br> I thought that about many pannels while reading this manga.</br></br></br>      <br><br> Don't worry guys, Science is here to save the day. </br></br>  <br>His daughter said Jie Mei is a beautiful ghost girl wearing chinese clothing but that's not enough to trust the faker without any proof or confirmation.<br>Still, he was in a tight spot with HnM revival just around the corner and all so it's kind of acceptable I guess.</br></br>    <br><br> Doesn't help that she visited the other generals as well. </br></br>        <br>Yep, HnM dished out quite a perfect plan to be honest.</br>      <br><br>Hell Yes, I was waiting for them.</br></br>    <br><br>Shame they'll probably be cut.</br></br>          How much do you love Shinobu, /a/?  <br>I don't</br>  I don't really care for this character since I dropped Bakeshit while it was airing and not interested in picking it back up again.   that feel when you will never travel the countryside doing odd jobs for local villages with a loli.
