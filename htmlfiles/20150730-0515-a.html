It's a specific fetish that represents something that all men want but can never have. No doubt there are many more examples of this and other desires such as male mother need.</br>  <br>Every girl in Fukou Da - The TV Series is comic relief.</br>  <br>Who the FUCK</br>  Is there any series where the tomboy actually wins?  <br>Nope.

What's not to love about them?</br>  <br>What is Shiki doing in the background?</br>  <br> buttmad flatfag trying to ruin yet another thread </br>  <br>Breasts are shit.</br>  <br>A tomboy's attractiveness is multilayered, each one is subtle but at the same time adds exponentially to their appeal.<br><br>The first layer of a tomboy's attraction is the Compassion that one shares with them. While girls are usually playing dressup a tomboy might play videogames or in the mud, through these similar experiences you feel that a tomboy is emotionally more enticing and promising than a normal girl whose entire existence is alien to the average /a/non. We naturally gravitate towards those who understand us best.<br><br>The second layer comes from the Contradiction. Even though a tomboy is masculine in her actions her visual appearance is feminine and this leads to an exotic nature which men naturally find attractive. The rarity of her behavior compounds with the basic nature of other women to make her stand out even more, like a jewel gleaming in a pile of dirt you can't help but notice and want it even more.<br><br>The third and most controversial layer of a tomboy's attractiveness is the Corruption. Men have the instinctual desire to control or at least influence their loved ones. While normally you'd express this in a regular woman through fetish clothing or asking her to take part in your hobby, a tomboy already appeals to your fetishes and most likely shares your hobbies. Because of this instead of asking them to debase themselves in a sexual manner, we ask them to debase themselves in a regal manner. Dressing up a tomboy and watching her embarrassed face as you tell her that she's cute is the supreme pinnacle of attractiveness. Watching them enjoy their own corruption is an even higher pleasure. In the end you're assured knowing that she'll always return to her normal self the next day.<br><br>Through these three layers we understand why tomboys are the supreme women. The three Cs that clarify their beauty which goes beyond the physical and enters the emotional and spiritual needs of mankind.<br><br>Compassion, Contradiction, and Corruption.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tomboys are the best.

Lewis. Particularly you will want the chapter on friendship (Philia). tl;dr version: it's very hard for men and women to become true friends because there are few common interests, which is the seed of true friendship; tomboys get you that (what is commonly referred to here as "being a bro), and a good-looking tomboy (which is independent of being a tomboy; see 3dpd) gets you both philia and eros, so it's the best of all worlds.</br>  <br><br><br>you gay m8?</br></br></br>  Tomboys in sundresses?  <br> C.S.

I've heard a number of people talk about Noa as being a first for them, I want to know what magical place they live where they got to watch Patlabor as a child.</br>  <br>Life is unfair.</br>  Threadly reminder that if you like tomboys you are, for all intents and purposes, a homosexual.  <br>But I don't like men.</br>  <br>If you want to shitpost go to a real closet homo thread like a trap thread or something.</br>  <br><br>Are trapfags really closeted? I mean besides the when I'm wearing a skirt I'm a girl" facetiousness it's pretty hard to argue that the fetish doesn't imply homosexuality.</br></br>  <br>I don't know some fags will defend it and say that primary because they're feminine that its not gay. Which is the argument shitposters use against tomboys, that just because tomboys are somewhat masculine that its somehow gay to like them.</br>  <br><br>There's no way people are serious when they make that defense. Even if they're serious when they say traps are completely feminine, it would take an intense kind of denial to overlook the fact that that they're deliberately seeking out the type of femininity that has a cock and balls.</br></br>  <br>I have some criticisms.<br>The second paragraph states that a tomboy stands out from other girls because they are different from them. This may be true, but given that every other girl is not a bitch princess who physically embodies the female archetype, and certainly is not dirt, the tomboy would appear more like a jewel in a pile of jewels - not particularly outstanding amongst the countless other appealing archetypes.<br>In the third paragraph it is said that a tomboy's masculine nature is appealing to men's instinctual desire to control or corrupt their loved ones. This sounds like some SJW shit, because it practically is; there is little to no evidence that any instinctive desire to corrupt exists, and even if it did, the idea that it would be especially appealing to corrupt something that already meets one's standards is equally baseless.<br>The emotional bond shared between a tomboy and her lover that is repeatedly touched upon in this post is also of questionably nature. Instinctively, a tomboy would be of appear contradictive, and - as made clear in the second paragraph - is indeed exotic. This contradiction can lead to a strong emotional bond, but its nature - that the woman appears like a man - must be considered. If on the surface - often the only thing judged by our primitive senses - the tomboy appears like a man, and the lover is sexually attracted to her (a necessary part of a relationship, of course), this would indicate that the lover's instincts are attracting him toward what appears to be a man, something almost exclusively characteristic of homosexuals.<br>Finally, the first paragraph says that the masculine character is familiar to the average /a/non. Seeing as the average /a/non is at least semi-hikki/NEET and often socially retarded, they would find it difficult to associate with a tomboy - that is, unless they do have social standards and do manly things - in other words, a normalfag.<br>Q.E.D. tomboys are for gay normalfags.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>questionable nature*</br>  <br>appear contradictive*<br>I thought I fucking proofread this shit.</br></br>  <br>Are you a bad enough dude to just fuck already?</br>  <br>Everybody wants their partner to reveal a side of themselves they don't show other people</br>  <br>Osaka, Japan.

He is the oldest member so it would make sense.  <br>But he almost let vengeance consume him, to the point he was willing to let innocents die or even kill innocents.</br>  Why cant miura release at least 50 pages per chapter? Hes doing things monthly and he has the story planned out right? 20 pages is too short.  <br><br>Does it really matters, man, like whatever</br></br>  Silat Hype.<br>The true hero comes to save the boy..!</br>  <br>Silat a bro</br>  <br>Until the end!</br>  <br>We don't know</br>  <br>Sorry to ask, but what is this from?</br>  Can someone explain to me how Ganishka is kill?<br><br>I read it twice and the manga doesn't really explain it at all. Griffith flew into the trees, and then suddenly Ganishka flaskback, then Skull Knight arrived, trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? then suddenly Vatican sprout out of the trees, fairlytale creatures came out and Griffith became the 2nd coming of Jesus?</br></br>  <br> trying to assasinate Griffith or Ganishka? <br><br>Neither.</br></br></br>  <br>Then what the fuck is he doing? I thought he's against the Godhand, why is he sprouting Vatican out of Ganishka?</br>  Is noname a virgin?  <br><br>Twice reborn and then cut with a sword that reaches deeper still, anon.<br><br>Skull Knight is bringing the God Hand closer to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck does "twice reborn" means?</br>  <br><br>You have been reading Berserk right?</br></br>  <br>It means he was reborn once as an apostle and again as Shiva.</br>  <br><br>Ok I get that Skullknight tried to strike Griffith with his Behelit sword, but Griffith went Aizen and "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka.<br><br>But then where did the Vatican city come from? What is the extent of Skullknight's Behelit sword power? Would Vatican city sprout up if Griffith just killed Ganishka straight up without Skullknight's Behelit sword strike? What happened to Skullknight afterward? Did he just "well I dun goofed" and leave? <br><br>I'm glad that it finally ended the worst, drawn out arc in Berserk, but there are several things that doesn't make sense</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "it was my plan all along" and redirect the tear in space into Ganishka's face, in which killed Ganishka. <br><br>No, Griffith is still dancing to Skullies tune here.</br></br></br>  Wait I don't understand. He got sad because Theresia hated him or because he fucked up her life? Between the weird character development of Gutts and the 0/10 literally worst translation i have ever read in my entire life it's getting kinda difficul to understand his character  <br>Falconia was the former capital of Midland that was buried beneath the earth which Griffith raised up using his god powers. <br>No idea.<br>Probably.<br>He fucked off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is Skullomania's end game? What is his tune?<br><br>He can warp space and teleport anywhere he want, why can't he just murder all apostles in their sleep? Maybe not Griffith per say, because it has been shown that Griffith is omnipotent but Zodd, the Hunter, Lancer, Crystal Dragons etc stood no chance against Skull'O. <br><br>Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand, then I can't see any way Miura can come up with an acceptable way of Guts beating Griffith. Guts need to at least get Ascension and become Godhand himself, because no amount of Berserker armor power ups would help him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also, if Griffith can avoid surprise attack from the one weapon in the series that can hurt a God Hand <br><br>It's not only Griffith, all the other God Hand can do the same kind of thing. Void does it during the Eclipse when Skully breaks in.<br><br>Skull Knight outright states that he's planning on creating a portal to the "vortex" and trap the God Hand there. Right now I think he might be waiting on Elf Island for Guts to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no reason why the dragonslayer wouldn't hurt the godhand if it hit them<br><br>Hitting them is the hard part, though</br></br></br>  PLEASE I NEED HELP WHERE THE FUCK CAN I GET THE DARKHORSE SCANS THIS SHIT IS KILLING ME  I don't understand how he managed to survive the heartbeats from the sea god <br>I really thought he at least would go blind after that</br>  Who or what is he?  <br>casca's son?</br>  <br><br>Wise magical negros apostle form</br></br>  <br>he's their son that griffith stole when he raped casca</br>  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  can someone tell me why did he raped casca? <br>was it really just him being butthurt that she loved guts and not him?</br>  <br>Femto is devoid of humanity and compassion as is typical of all apostles.<br><br>All what's left in him was his bitterness and hurt over what Guts did to him. So he decided to punish Guts in the cruelest ways imaginable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The reincarnated Soul of their son. It and Griffith (Femto) are connected. As long as one lives the other cannot die. To kill Griffith Guts will have to murder his only child.<br><br>The fetus demon thing that Casca gave birth to was used as the vessel to bring Femto into the physical world. However when Femto manifested and took control of the body he forced the thing's soul out. This is it's new form.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A qt</br></br>  <br>Narrative. <br>But yeah, I think he was being possessive in order to destroy Guts. Something that not much people seem to notice about the rape is how "caring" Femto was. He kissed, licked and stimulated the way you'd do someone you want to give pleasure as well.<br>And to have the girl you love enjoying herself in an despicable act despite being so fucked up was enough not only to break Guts, but to break Casca as well.<br>Femto just killed two birds with one stone</br></br></br></br>  <br>This was one of the nicest moments in the manga so far.</br>  <br>You sure about that big boy?</br>  <br>What are you implying?</br>  <br> farnese <br>I really hope she gets hatefucked by a hundred apostles when guts has to choose if he wants to become a god hand</br></br>  <br>Almost and did are different things, Anon-kun.</br>  <br> Guts will never be your dad </br>  <br>You can use google, you know?<br> Witch Hunter </br></br>  <br>LOL Casca had the brand of sacrifice so i'm pretty sure she was suffering a lot</br>  <br>The brand wasn't bleeding and her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels.</br>  <br> Well, Luca in particular is wiser than that, but Rickert doesn't know that. <br>I always thought she was a smartass.</br></br>  <br> her body did enjoy it. You just have to look at the manga panels. <br><br>You've been reading too much hentai anon. Arousal during rape is normal physical response. Doesn't mean she enjoyed it at all</br></br></br>  <br>she hasn't acted like she actually hates guts in like a hundred chapters, she just does retard comic relief stuff.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, probably silat and his outcast cloned friends are the only one who understand what griffith is.</br></br>  will rickert ever go through puberty?<br><br>where does he get his HRT prescription from?</br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>A bit of both, actually</br>  <br> her body <br>You're not reading enough</br></br>  So I'm re-reading after stopping when they initially got on the boat. I currently just finished the volume where Griffith is reborn. <br><br>This time however, I read the excluded chapter 83. <br><br>Is there any good, well thought out speculation on what "Fear God(ch.83)" wants with humanity? Griffith just asked for wings. I want some exposition. If it's a reflection of humanity, then what the is it doing projecting more fear on humanity. It leads me to think Guts is either a character that's being guided by some opposing force.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*shit I'm pretty drunk<br><br>disregard that "either"</br></br></br>  <br> that awful quality </br>  <br>Schierke wants the dick so hard is unreal. I wish Guts would pound that loli ass already.</br>   a retarded homosexual actually thought that Rickert was a girl and he probably thought that Griffith was a girl too   Best girl  <br>Ooohhh! Mr. Silatt and his Pillar Men has finally arrived. I wish they did this pose after saving the Femto Slapper.</br>  <br>Could Dio take any of those three on?</br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  <br>holy shit this <br> <br>it's blatant how bad the manga is now</br></br></br>  <br>I'd kill myself.</br>  <br>Silly anon, the boat ride never ends.</br>  who's Miura favorite idol and why?  <br>Even good people make mistakes, the fact we are saying "almost" and not "did" shows that he is strong enough to remember that he still has morals. If Guts was a mindless killer, like when he is in the Berserk armour, things would be very different.</br>  <br><br> mahou shoujo bersekah magica </br></br>  <br>For all we know they may still get hurt from being hit with weapons such as draonslayer. I mean why bother using that portal redirect thing or even fight back if they didn't have to worry. I think actually landing a blow is suppose to be the difficult part.</br>  <br>Chihaya, because "look at Casca".</br>  <br> I mean why bother using that portal redirect thing or even fight back if they didn't have to worry. I think actually landing a blow is suppose to be the difficult part. <br><br>Correct me if I'm wrong but they've only ever pulled that out for Skully.<br><br>Slan herself manifested in that troll den and took a dragonslayer through her troll-intestine torso, that might have just been a remote astral body thing similar to what the dread emps was pulling though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right the only time we have seen that is when Void and Femto redirected Skull Knights attack. <br>Yeah I'm not too sure how the whole ordeal with Slan worked out. I just want to see Guts kill a god hand and the others god hands reactions, shit would be cash.</br></br>  <br>i get the impression she literally has no soul</br>  <br> To kill Griffith Guts will have to murder his only child. <br>Oh, the suffering. This sounds like something Miura would do.</br></br>  So when guts got into the boat, miura told in an enterview that the stroy was about 60-65% complete.<br><br>how much has it advanced since then? 5%? 10%?</br></br>  <br>1%.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Shit this literally sounds 100% dead on</br>  <br><br>There's no real way to know who would win. DIO could probably avoid them indefinitely using The World, but there's nothing to guarantee that his Stand could actually hurt them in any meaningful capacity. <br><br>If both parties have to fight unaware of the others abilities, my money is on Pillar Men because DIO is arrogant as Hell and his underestimating of them would probably lead to his partial consumption into a panicked time stop only to find out he can't move away from them now that they've started to eat him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>God Hand = once every 216 years, besides there are already five of them (5 fingers in a hand...).<br><br>Not only that, but being a God Hand is not enough to kill one, Guts has to surpass them. <br>Guts will kill God himself, he will fucking trash him barehanded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is not a shonen, Guts will kill Griffith, if even that, and call it a millenium until Griffith is reborn to kill him for good.</br>  <br>How and why would Griffith come back to life ?</br>  <br>And why would Guts be still alive by then ?</br>  <br>It happened to Void. Because causality.</br>  <br>Can you remind me where it's explained ?</br>  <br>because Zodd is Gut's father</br>  <br>Yes he can stop time and The World is faster and stronger than any of them, they could absorb him but they would have to touch him to do that and they will never be able to.</br>  <br>In </br>  <br>His name is motherfacking Rickert m8</br>    <br>Wait, if Skull Knight killed Void how come he's still there ? <br>I'm missing something I think.</br></br>  I'm wondering why Guts goes so far for Casca.<br>If she was my girl, I would have left her already.</br>  <br>Because if she dies, Griffith becomes even more powerful.<br>At least that'd be my reasoning. Guts legitimately loves her, and also subconsciously keeps her as a wound Griffith inflicted.</br></br>  <br>It's missing that this is all theory and at no point is this ever said in the story we have no idea what the pasts of Skull or Void are.</br>  <br><br><br>If it were DIO vs Ultimate Kars, Kars takes it in a godstomp. Dio vs the Pillar Men, like the anon said, he would get arrogant and die.<br>also<br> The World is faster and stronger than any of them <br>Pillar Men have confirmed FTL reflexes. The World is most likely faster, but certainly not to a margin where it would make an ultimate defense against one, let alone all 3 of them. DIO is fucked no matter how you look at it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No shit he would lose to Ultimate Kars, and the question was take any of them on not all 3 at once, plus Part 2 characters are marginally weaker than Part 3 characters Joesph at any point in his life would instantly have died to DIO timestop or not, and he could beat the Pillar Men.</br>  <br>He can at best stalemate a single one. Pillar Men can literally only be killed with the Ripple. Or lava, i guess. Though i suspect Wammu would figure out his abilities pretty fast and proceed to fuck his shit up. He can think and move far faster the DIO, and is an incomparably better fighter (not to mention, you saw how DIO was scared when Jotaro moved in frozen time, it completely threw him off, now imagine how much would he shit himself if his enemy was an immortal aztec super-vampire that wants to eat him). Wammu would probably psyche him out as well.</br>  <br> I'm wondering why Guts goes so far for Casca. <br>She is the only person in his life he sincerely loved and who loved him back. You don't chuck away people you really love, even if they lose their sanity.</br></br>  <br>He shit himself because he thought he was the only one that could stop time and Jotaro got mega plot armor, they can be killed by more than ripple, ripple just serves to completely destroy their brains which is how to kill them, I'm pretty sure The World can destroy Wham's brain within 11 seconds.</br>  <br> Pillar Men have confirmed FTL reflexes <br>This matters so I need to ask, does Dio's the world even stop time and not just slow it down? As we see jojos skill can cancle out dios, which probably means that he has the same skill. Yet in part 5 or 6 (whichever is based in the jail) we see that the end boss some what cancled out jojo's ability. Yet the end boss's power was to speed up time. This makes me think he doesnt stop time but slow it down.</br></br>  <br>No it stops time Pucci the final villain of Part 6 can speed up time, no he didn't move in Jotaro's timestop, yes he lowered the duration of the timestop by speeding up time, I'm sure it's stop because Pucci himself speeds up at the same rate that time does so if he could lower the duration then he should also be able to move but he couldn't.</br>  <br>But jojo noticed that he moved his eye while still in the first time stop, not that his time stop ended prematurely.</br>  <br>And then he would regenerate. Straizo was blown up completely and he regenerated no problem, and he's a mere vampire. Not only can they only be killed with the ripple, it needs to be channeled through something, as direct contact is useless. DIO doesn't have the tools to kill Wammu.</br>   morons are talking about an objectively shitty series in a Berserk thread <br>I'd rather see you morons talk about Mihawk.</br>  <br>Listen, Satan, you faggot, Berserk is my favorite mango, but don't you dare talk shit about Jojo.<br> objectively shitty <br>The only objective here is that you're objectively a huge faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>It has to destroy the brain Straizo didn't get fucking disintegrated by some grenades he got badly injured, if his brain was destroyed then he would die.<br><br>The only time he moved at all during timestop was before he even had the power to speed up time and I'm assuming this is only because his stand was created using DIO's body and soul.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128708893 <br>you know, I've never read JJBA, but my taste tells me that it's shit</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128708893 <br> being this assblasted <br> acting like an oldfag <br> saying anything is shit while using reaction images from objective shit </br></br></br>  <br>Elf king</br>  <br>No, this seems too obvoious. It also doesn't explain why Casca would be so drawn towards the child.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128708893 <br><br>Don't mind Nagi, she tries to derail threads but it doesn't work.<br><br>Anyway, the only thing I want to see is Griffith when he realises the shit he did. Him falling to his knees and crying uncontrollably to Guts, making Guts feel a complicated feel</br></br></br></br>  <br>Young anime boys are quite girly looking.</br>  I thought Judeau was a girl  I wonder how these guys became superhuman.  <br>They're not superhumans.

Most likely during the full moon Griffith &amp; the baby switch places, and during the full moon he watches over his parents the same way he did back before Tower of Conviction. It's still Griffith as well though, and once the full moon is over he reverts back. That's why we see Zodd in pic related the first time we find the child: he's watching over Griffith to make sure nothing happens until daybreak.</br>  I get an RSS notification whenever somebody changes the name on Batoto to something iM@S related and I've chuckled nearly every time.  <br>That's a pretty big assumption m8, Zodd has been watching Guts for a long time and Casca is the one weakness Griffith really has so it makes sense for him to be watching.</br>  <br>She won't die prettily though, seeing how the last Band ended up.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-nT<wbr>NWk152xs</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>You're not alone OP</br></br></br>  <br> dexfags <br><br>Guts is a str monster though and he's managed well</br></br></br>  <br> implying he isn't an hybrid </br>  <br> Quality build </br>    Str 25<br>Dex 14<br>Con 18<br>Int 8<br>Wis 10<br>Cha 12</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good ol' 80's miura's drawing</br>  <br>Gex is full STR, but the lower his health goes the more buffs he receives across all stats.</br>  <br>Implying he isn't capped on all stats</br>  <br>Wait.

Dunno what that fag's talking about.</br>  <br>The Slappening restored my faith in Miura.</br>  <br>God knows how much time having to deal with chapters full of nothing and it still was worth it</br>  <br>'till next time!</br>    <br><br><br>If this was anyone else, I'd lean more towards it being the same person, but Miura is such a god-tier artist that the fact the noses don't quite match (based on the example panels) makes me think it isn't her.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't that just mean that Guts can swing it like that, he has just no need to. I mean, Guts is basically fighting like every hit is meant to be a sure kill, so no loose swings.</br>    <br><br>Maybe something to do with this.</br></br>  <br>Elegantly put<br>also checked</br></br>  <br>He killed Adonis during golden age arc. So he is not a saint.</br>  <br>That was actually an accident, and Guts definitely felt lots of guilt about it.</br>  <br> sacred gruond certainly makes for miracles <br> Rebith cerimony  <br><br>If the legend is attendable and the guy who invoked god's punishment was a Gaiserik's enemy then this is a hint on god's (Idea of Evil) true nature<br>we (I presume) always thought that Evil action are part of the flow of casuality and so, events like possession of red behelits, and rebirth cerimony were casual events with casual outcomes, and until now we had only had "bad" or "evil" outcomes, but still can be interpreted as part of casuality.<br><br>But this phrase change things: if rebirth cerimony was god's (Idea of Evil) will so that make god truly evil <br>Not more God=Chaos but God=Evil</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God is not Evil, it's the Idea of Evil. It represents everything that humans consider evil or harmful, so they can blame on it everything bad that happens to them. It's job is to give evilness itself a name and a face, so a saviour can appear and free humanity from harm and misery forever. At least that's how I interpret Berserk's meta-history.<br><br>Also, the Hand of God can't manipulate reality, or at least not beyond their limited capabilities. When they say that something was "bound to happen", they actually mean " the Idea of Evil wanted it this way, so we made it happened".</br></br></br>  <br>I just assumed that was Lord Mozgus's twisted religious interpretation of the eclipse ceremony.<br><br>I assumed that someone (void?) sacrificed the people of skellington 1000 years ago but Skelly survived and became the 1000 year old immortal berserk armored photo-guts.<br><br>Not sure I like the idea of Guts and Griffith being doomed to repeat another 1000 year cycle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Accident or not adonis is kill. I m not saying that Gut is a bad person, I m just saying that he is not 100 % goody good.</br>  <br>The count didn't sacrifice his daughter so we know that free will exists to an extent.</br>  <br>Ah, okay, alright.</br>  <br> The count didn't sacrifice his daughter <br>he should of<br>ungrateful bitch</br></br></br>  <br>Nor they were able to predict the Skull Knight actions during the Eclipse. And the God Hand stated that the Griffith's ascension had been planned and assisted. They are very proactive at making the "fate" happens.</br>  <br>Griffith, please. Go back to your garden.</br>  <br>Will we ever see her again?</br>  <br>imo the matter is much more complicated<br>It all depends on the reliability of that name.<br>the issue is: is the name "Idea of Evil" it's true name, what gives a hint about its essence, or just a name that it's an interpretation af its essence?</br></br></br>  <br>I hate her so much, I hope she'll die the cruelest of all deaths</br>  <br>Guts and Skull Knight are parts of the interstice<br>Law of casuality doesn't apply to them.<br>According to this Skull Knight thinks he and Guts can harm and kill God Hand but what happened inside reincarnated Ganishka doesn't prove it<br>it's fucking tricky</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I can FEEL that slap</br></br>  <br>when guts is an old man and his family is finally together we'll see him get either poisoned or stabbed through the chest from behind by her</br>  <br>I assumed the brand means that your fate is to die and go to the vortex of suffering, but what happens until then is is undetermined.</br>  <br>That brand is a clusterfuck of misteries<br>There was that page when SkullKnight said that Guts can keep struggling and killing apostles because of that brand hinting that brand gives him superhuman strenght because of "out of this wolrd" stuff<br>I'm searching hit<br>The bad is that all of speculation is based on that lazy faggot halfwords</br></br></br></br>    <br>Apostles are destined to die in the vortex of suffering, but so far Branded individuals just seem to be food for apostles that give them the power to be demons. Maybe the brand is the God Hand delivering some power to a human, then the human is eaten by the apostle and gains that little bit of power.<br>That can explain why branded people exist in both worlds</br></br>  <br>He should be pretty buff by now, being a blacksmith for several years at his age.<br>Only conclusion is that he doesn't eat enough</br></br>  <br>Is this Griffith lost and gone forever? ;-;</br>  <br>No, the brand only makes Guts (and Casca) also exist in the shadow world where phantoms and other weird beings appear, and attracts those beings towards the branded. It does not give Guts any super-special powers, except a pain in the neck (literally) whenever he's in the presence of a great evil.</br>  <br>Well right now, Griffith has lapped the two worlds together anyways, so hypothetically, anyone could kill Griffith. Though he'd just simply turn into Femto and go back living in the vortex level. But because Guts has the brand he can slap Godhands shit in the deepest level, not only in physical realm.</br>  <br>then why doesn't her?</br>  <br>Also, Guts has always been "other-leg-in-hell" as he was born from a dead mother. This was used in the start but I think Miura has completely forgotten about that.</br>  <br>Because <br> muh casca </br></br>  <br>How? He cut Slan in two and it didn't even faze her even with the Dragonslayer.</br>  <br>And then another tricky question, Griffith has been slapped by Rickert of his will or because he can now be touched?</br>  <br>His birth does not give him special powers either. It just means that he really should have been dead, but he managed to survive, by luck (being found at all), and by his own strength (crying out to show that he's actually alive), which is symbolic for Guts's entire life. He lives and nearly dies every day by hair's breadth. <br><br>Nothing more, nothing less.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't the actual Slan, but an embodient of her. If you truly want to kill a Godhand, you either have to do it in their realm or what ever that maze fuck was in the start.<br><br><br>I'd argue it was a bit of both. I think the slap surprised him but he didn't want to evade it. Maybe he still had some feelings for his friends.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing tricky about it. <br><br>Normally, Griffith/Femto cannot be touched at all, because of his superdimension-warping powers that allows him to negate any hit, and to make anything implode whenever he wants. Obviously, Rickert could slap Griffith/Femto because the demon lord wanted to shake Rickert's hand, and thus disabled his no-touch-no-go space warping. <br>It does show that Griffith/Femto could theoretically be hurt in such a moment if one took advantage of it, but the problem is that Griffith/Femto will really really rarely ever lower his space warp ability. And he's protected by a legion of the most dangerous monsters anyway.</br></br></br></br>  So the massacre of the original Band of the Hawk paved the way to a city with flushing toilets.<br><br>Magnificent.</br></br>  <br>Griffith clearly did what had to be done</br>  <br>This makes sense, even with the proof of when he hugged Casca<br>But, you know, is very unlikely</br></br>  <br>Even Guts can forgive this much</br>  Next chapter when?  <br>Rickert's bag looks really nice! Looks cool on a guy unlike the blacksword person I know who always carry a purse around with him.</br>  <br> Guts kills Griffith <br> Midlanders have to go back to shitting in holes in the ground and rotting in their own filth </br></br>  Why isn't Luca pregnant?<br>She's a prostitute and they don't have contraception.</br>  <br>celery</br>  <br><br>Maybe they use those condons made from a sheep's stomach or something</br></br>  <br>Y'know Griffith becomes more and more right everyday</br>  I like the new chapter, and I'm glad Berserk is back...but honest this was me when I saw it was still fucking Falconia.  <br>Literally anyone that read the story knows he's not goody-good</br>  <br>Dio fighting the Pillar Men and Joesph fighting the Pillar Men are completely different on a fundamental level<br>Fighting style, attitude, endurance, all of it is different</br></br>  <br>Jotaro can move in Time Stop because Time Stop is Star Platinum's power<br>DIO's power is The World, which lets him use all the powers of the JoJo bloodline, which includes Time Stop and Hermit Purple</br></br>  <br>Hit with the weight of a mountain when swinging</br>  <br>It's the disembodied soul of her and Gut's son that was tainted with the powers of Griffith, granting him special spirit power things by accident or something<br>The body of the child became Griffith, the soul escaped</br></br>  <br>That Dio theory had sense until part 4.<br>Josuke is a direct heir of joestar blood and a 1st step son of Joseph wich has a brambles stand, And doesnt have brambles, while Holly, at the same level in bloodline has it <br>Jotaro's time stop is an asspull, hands down <br>Time stop has mean to be only if it's Dio's power that makes him terrifying and invincible, the main point of part 3</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The story has to deal with this stuff - no matter how much you want them to get off the boat, this falconia stuff IS the plot at the moment and Falconia needs to be set up for later (I hope).<br><br><br><br>She's swallowed a load of Behelits and turned them into a reusuable condom, like Skullknight's behelit sword.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a label for anything people think is "bad"<br>It's not a "real" thing with a name, at least not yet<br>It's just a concept</br></br></br>  <br> Guts can now give Griffith a swirly </br>  <br> DIO dies before part 4 <br> b-but part 4 exists! <br>The stand and it's power didn't exist yet, DIO couldn't use a power that didn't fucking exist</br></br></br>  <br>But the pillar men dont have stands so they wont be able to see the worlds attacks.

Has that been dropped or he still a potential threat?</br>  <br>Its going to be like Shin Angyo Onshi.

Incentivizing others into action to undermine Griffith (i.e. Rickert, Silat, and his Tapasa.)</br></br>   It leads me to think Guts is either a character that's being guided by some opposing force <br><br>that's actually very interesting</br></br>  <br> who only joined the new Band to kill Griffith <br><br>Think back to the apostles that have tried to kill Griffith. You know, Wyald and the Emperor? You know how they only managed to further this cause by trying to kill him? Hell, remember how Skull Knight's one weapon to kill the Godhand was used in their ultimate plans?<br><br>I think after witnessing the birth of the life tree Rakshas wised the fuck up about that shit. Ain't no escape from Causality.</br></br></br></br></br>  Dark Horse scans when? Evil Genius is garbage. The dialogue sounded robotic as fuck, like something out of Google Translate.  <br><br>guts's mom seemed to love him very much tho</br></br>   morons are still talking about the objectively shitty series that's called JoJo's Bizarre Adventure in a Berserk thread   <br><br> really rarely ever lower his space warp ability <br> wanted to shake his hand and... thus disabled his space warping <br><br>Then maybe Casca is the key. Last Griffith saw of her, she was a drooling vegetable that was immediately drawn to him. He let her in very very close. Suppose the Elf King's magic can make her sane and she can use that against Griffith to her advantage if he let's her in close again thinking she's no threat.<br><br>Hell, it'd be very Miura-appropriate if the Elf King making her sane is wrapped up in some bullshit like "she'll become sane again at the right moment" or "it's her inner conflict driving her insane, trying to reconcile her self-percieved debt to Griffith against the weight of his actions. With Casca's backstory, part of her was probably WILLING to be sacrificed for Griffith like that, definitely more so than any other member of the band.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That'd actually be a neat way to make a powerful moment, since the community is really caught up in interpreting what's going to happen Casca and what her thoughts are about Griffith. The Elf King's magic just reveals or helps so much that she has to resolve her own inner battle to regain her sanity. And that happens the next time Griffith let's her in close. It'd be a very suspenseful moment wondering what the fuck she's going to do.</br></br>  <br><br> filename <br><br>hear appearance isn't nearly as bad as you guys make it to be</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i didn't really notice<br><br>to me it's still very detailed</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Like he makes a move to kiss her to torment Guts again, letting down his causality guard, and she reacts in that moment to stab through his eye into his brain and kill that form. That'd be so great and it'd parallel Guts losing his eye.   Then she'll get killed by Femto. </br></br>  <br><br>I've been re-reading everything post Golden Age (I've re-read everything before that several times already) and I still can't believe how long this asshole has been around without actually doing anything.<br><br>Love the monks though, those guys are awesome.</br></br></br></br>  <br>illustration might have to do with it.</br>  <br>Anon...</br>  <br><br>Jesus, part of her probably was willing to be sacrificed for Griffith, even in that grisly manner. She probably could have convinced herself that it was worth killing the whole band, because of the guilt she felt for failing him and letting him come to his ruined state. She could have accepted dying like all the rest.<br><br>But, instead of sacrificing her as an equal with her comrades, he singled her out for complete humiliation. Not even targeting her as the subject of his anger, but merely using her as an object to get back at Guts. Using her, his most loyal and loving lieutenant, without even a thought about it. That and the pain from the brand, that is enough to drive a girl insane with resolving an inner conflict.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>no fuck off</br></br>  <br><br>she probably got killed or raped</br></br>  Is the first panel in Berserk also going to be the last?<br><br>Will Guts be trapped in the void with the succubus?</br></br>  <br>It's not just the character designs that went to shit. He has no line weight anymore.</br>  <br><br>Spooky Hijnks: <br><br>Then Slan gives birth to him through the corpse of that woman hung on the tree.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Meant for<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>whatever</br></br>  <br>I really hopes she pops up again... and not to get raped out of the blue.</br>  <br><br>His character art has really suffered since Gigantomachia.

That's what bothers me most about the new artstyle.</br>  <br><br>anyone ever wonder how would guts's life be if the eclipse didn't happen?<br><br>would he be living a calm life with caska and his son?<br><br> papa guts and momma caska training their son </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Band of the Magical Negro.</br>  <br>He still looks damn girly.</br>  <br/>  <br>Is that an EVA behind them?</br>  <br>But isn't it Griffiths kid not Guts'? maybe i'm confused on the vessel part?</br>  we are still on the boat because we didn't pray to the boatgod  <br>It was Guts's and Caska's kid but it was tainted with Femto's "demonic seed" and thus became demonic or wutev. But still Guts's kid</br>  <br><br>Yes? I'm glad people are noticing.</br></br>  <br>kek'd</br>  What if casca regained her sanity at the moment gutts dies and becomes the hellhound?

The characters had little to no depth, and the supporting ones were just about useless. That said I did enjoy the eclipse and liked some of the alterations done with the skips. It's been a while so I can't exactly pinpoint.</br></br>  <br> tfw Miura will die before Berserk has been properly done in OVA format that imitates his old artstyle </br>  <br>I don't even care about an anime anymore. I just want him to finish the series without copping out.</br>  <br>Yeah...</br>  <br>I dont see why they cant do what they did with JoJo<br>They copied the unique artstyle so well<br> and those manga spliced OPs man holy fuck </br></br></br>  I saw Kentaro Miura at a grocery store in Chiba City yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.<br><br>He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”<br><br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br><br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br><br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Simply ebin anon</br>  <br> theresa how could you <br>yes how could she swear to kill the guy who used her as a human shield in order to torture and kill her father..</br></br>  <br>Of course he's wondering aloud how Theresia would actually go about slaying the murder machine/brick shithouse known as Guts.</br>  do you think skull knight spies on guts by hanging on the wall in dungeons as a skellington and not saying anything?  Do the nips seriously believe that women sexually enjoy rape?  <br><br>She's secretly Skull Knight's mother<br><br>Mamma Skellington.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hell, remember how Skull Knight's one weapon to kill the Godhand was used in their ultimate plans? <br><br>They were still going with Skull Knights plan for this.</br></br></br>  <br> They are gonna fuck like the old witch and the casualtyfag. <br><br>Do you think Skully screamed CASUALTY during climaxu with the witch?</br></br></br>  <br>Where did you get that implication?</br>  <br>involuntary orgasms are seldom but not unheard of, and japan's kinda weird about sex even when it's consensual</br>  <br>from manga/anime rape scenes having the woman display blush and other indications of amusement/pleasure instead of just suffering</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Compare the size of the intact horn with the size of the stump. Zod is practically a unicorn at this point.</br>  <br>Rape victim here. A woman's body will tell her yes, since there can be stimulation and a natural response to sex. But that doesn't mean the woman in question is enjoying having her body violated and I much rather would have had the guy off of me.<br><br> inb4 you deserved it/bitches and whores </br></br></br>  <br>I know a rape victim. From experience she told me that even though the chemical process (like you said , the body) is there , the feeling of enjoyment didn't happen. She said it was like having a meatgrinder masturbate your dick. Yes you will eventually maybe cum but there is absolutely nothing pleasant about it</br>  Does anyone actually think Miura knows what to do with Caska? Does anyone actually think he has planned the ending to this series?<br><br>I think he's stuck in a corner. There's no sensible way I or anyone else I've seen can think of for this story to end that doesn't turn the manga into campy shounen.</br></br>  <br>I would choose Pepe.</br>  it's impressive how shit berserk is now   Nina lived <br> Sonia is still alive </br>  <br> not working in a "till next time" </br>  <br>Yeah the ending is planned, that's for sure. <br>As for what will happen to Casca, of course he knows, but does it really matter ?</br></br>    <br>Yeah, I noticed it too. I still love the art though.</br>  <br>;_;<br> im surprised how well miura wrote their relationship, dont think any other love story has affected me in such a way </br></br>  <br>That detail tho<br>Every fucking strand of hair</br></br>  <br>It'll never happen</br>  <br>I think Miura has some affection with certains characters in terms of drawing.<br><br>For example, I can see how he really LOVES drawing Griffith and each drawings of this character is simply wonderful.

Even in Lost Children he was vomiting and in constant stress.</br>  <br>He vomited in Lost Children because he got poisoned by Rosine<br><br>Sonia doesn't have magic powers she's just a normal human with very heightened senses towards occurrences in the Astral Plane.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, just saying stress ages people. Moreso for Guts. He doesn't even look 22 anymore.</br>  <br>Since apostles can be reborn again I dont see why elves couldn't too.</br>  <br>Well Apostles are still physical beings, Puck and other elves are purely Astral Beings which can be touched and seen only because their existence is commonly recognized and that means anyone who does not outright refuse their existence can interact with their ethereal forms.</br>  <br>He is reset.</br>  <br>Will there be good god hand? Remember there are pair of hands</br>  <br>No, they're called the God Hand because they are the Hand of The Idea of Evil, they carry out it's will and influence on the world.</br>  <br>There must be idea of good too and guts become one of them</br>  <br> There must be idea of good too <br>Why do you think this?</br></br>  <br>There's no Idea of Good, or there is but it can't be as strong as the Idea of Evil, the Berserk world is comprised of 3 planes of existence The World of Ideas which is the basis of all existence, The Astral World the most powerful inhabitant of which is the Idea of Evil who was created by the collective consciousness of mankind, and resides in the Abyss of The Astral Plane or it's deepest parts, other Gods do exist as well but they are not as powerful as the Idea of Evil.</br>  <br>The Idea of Evil isn't even canon so all your whole post is bullshit speculation.</br>  <br>It is canon the chapter isn't decanonized just because it went out of print, it was removed because it revealed too much about the story so how could it possibly not exist? Plus even within the present chapters Void refers to the Man Made God which either way serves the same function that The Idea of Evil would even if it's origin were changed. It being the most powerful being of The Astral Plane is not speculated Flora states that other Gods do in fact exist but can not move through the consuming vortex of souls which we have already seen and she states beyond that is the Abyss which houses the being that controls the God Hand</br>  <br> gives away too much of the plot so it gets pulled <br> not canon <br>K.</br></br></br>  Next chapter when?  <br>Try using your eyes and you'll find out.</br>  Still mad Griffith fucking the Princess and fucking everything up.  <br>Yes. That Griffith grew up into a miserable twat that deemed killing all his companions so he could finally be "king" a worthy sacrifice.</br>    Reminder that Guts vs Wyald is the only Apostle fight where Guts didn't have his Dragonslayer or Berserk armor and still managed to win.  <br> what is the entire eclipse </br>  <br><br>That ain't winning, son.</br></br>  <br>He didn't "win" the eclipse but he killed numerous apostles by just being himself. Also he defeated the succubus apostle with only his dick and the arm cannon.</br>  Real life Guts  Dragonslayer &gt; Broadsword &gt; Abandoned sword &gt; Training sword   mfw waited all these years to read berserk don't know why <br> finnaly started reading 3 days ago <br> currently on volume 10 <br> mfw even if the translation is probably the worst i have read in my entire life this shit is 10/10 <br> dat armor porn <br> dat world exposition <br> dat setting <br><br>I'm experiencing something special /a/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> read on mangasee instead </br>  <br>read on mangasaurus or download from bakabt</br>  So is it known whatever became of the Kushan Empire or the Daka and Pisacha ? <br><br>Or that clan of Kushan assassins ? <br><br>I was interested in seeing more of them but they vanished and there is no word on the state of the war between Midland and the Kushan Empire (assuming its even still going).</br></br></br></br>  <br>https://bakabt. me/torrent/162057/berserk-scans<br>Here you go anon.

Do you know what the name of that chapter was? It was "Setting Sail". Guts has been on the boat for 8 years. <br><br>8 fucking years<br><br>f<br>u<br><br>c<br>k<br>i<br>n<br>g<br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128685603#p128758645">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Kushan were pretty much forced out of Midland but based on earlier context they had been conquering land for a while but with Ganishka dead I doubt that will continue, the Bakiraka follow Silat but they were more slaves than a clan or a main part of the Kushan forces.</br>  <br><br>So I take it the rest of the Kushan Empire is untouched then minus Griffith's stunt with the world transformation ?</br></br>   Naruto isn't allowed and is frowned upon <br> while this shit is perfectly fine <br>Why?<br>They're both literally the same thing with terrible cancerous fanbases and rampant redditfags and normalfags making threads about how amazing and original it is (Which it isn't)<br>Why isn't this shit banned again? It may not have an anime yet but when it does this board will be flooded with terrible and autistic threads bout it. Take care of the problem now before it gets worse. The fans are all from reddit anyway, they can just fuck off back to where they came from.<br>Mark my words. This series will be the next Naruto or SAO in terms of pure, unadulterated cancer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thread is barely 25 minutes old.<br>Only 1 in 10 anons bothers to actually report threads.<br>Give the mods some time.</br></br></br>    <br>We don't have time, dammit.</br>      So was he Hitler?<br><br>After  his death , all the world's problems were blamed on him and everyone sees him as the worst person to ever live. He wanted to liberate the Nips (Germans) from Britannia (NWO) and did everything in his power to do so. Hell, he even participated in a world war to achieve these ends.</br></br>   L dies   <br> faked his death to live in a foreign land with his waifu <br>Sounds about right. Also Hitler thread.</br></br>  Ya telling me germany losing WW2 was all but part of a plan in order to get rid of the rampant german nationalism and antidemocratic sentiment, so that germany could become the King of EU it currently is?  Knitler  <br>He's alive, nigger</br>  <br><br>How so?<br><br>Did he steal CC's code or something? That sword was all up in his heart's business.</br></br></br></br>  <br>While he did a shit load of bad things it was to drag the world out of a series of endless and pointless battles and into the future where war had no more meaning.</br>  <br>We've been over this. He took Charles' when he was choking him.</br>  <br>Well I just finished it for the first time a few weeks ago, all right, bud?<br><br>How do you steal codes? Touch their mark on their body? Does the person need Geass to do it? I thought only the person to whom you've given Geass can take your code.</br></br></br>  <br>just google it, it's not even worth copying and pasting anymore</br>  <br>Hitler thread it is.</br>  <br>Here<br>I'll be nice for once</br></br>  <br>Wouldn't that imply that Charles willingly transferred the Code to Lelouch?<br>Why would he transfer immortality to the one who ruined his plans and unmade him? It makes no sense</br></br>  <br><br>Oh shit, I didn't catch any of that but it fits. Thanks. Just changed my outlook on the series a bit.<br><br><br>Most people with immortality see it as a curse I presume. Literally cannot die unless someone with Geass gets it super powerful, then kills you. Or that's what I got out of it anyway.</br></br></br></br></br>  Dumping                                <br>And done.<br><br>Thanks Mega guy<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!CAlXEY7L!cooK<wbr>ERhviytsGX16p2iVMg</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> as powerful as Negi <br><br>Oh come on</br></br></br>  <br>Could just be "as powerful as his thunder form"</br>  <br>It can move as fast as he did anyway. And probably hit just as hard as Negi did in his thunder form.</br>  <br>They orobably have no idea how strong Negi was or even more, is.<br><br>I'm not wanking or anything but this kind of stuff happens all the time in manga, it's just hyping shit up</br></br></br>  <br>So, is the Negi NTR still going stronk in UQ Holder?<br>I dropped because of it. Had never seen an author NTR his own MC with another manga's MC. It's like he doesn't give a fuck about Negima.<br><br>Well the fact that Eva is a totally different character(in personality) makes me wonder if he just decided to blow Negima off</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kirië should win the Touta-Bowl.</br>  <br>At this point Eva can be considered 3 characters, Kitty (between 16 and 60 years old), Eva (600 years old) and Yukihime (700 years old), which makes sense considering how old is she, Akamatsu is following the idea that nobody will remain the same after such a long time. It doesn't help that Yukihime saw most of his friend die of old age, the two guys he liked defeated and controled by the Lifemaker and her first love turned into an amnesic little kid.</br>  <br>Regarding Yukihime: Mother or Wife?</br>  <br>Older sister.</br>  <br>I fucking love his monster designs.</br>  <br>We all do</br>  <br>Of course he is.<br><br>Negi? Who? Man we have a cool clone of negi now that NTRs him. Get on with the times</br></br></br>  <br>well in part you have to recall negi's strongpoint wasn't supposed to be his pure battle strength, he was just pretty strong as well as being really smart. there's probably tons of monsters and shit throughout eternity that are just as strong, if not stronger, than negi was. However negi is a stronger foe because negi is a genius rather than because negi is more pwoerful</br>  <br>Damn, it took 80 chapters but I'm finally starting to enjoy this series as something more than a sad Negima sequel.</br>  <br>Negi was never interested in Eva.</br>  <br>You marry her first so that she becomes your wife then you impregnate her and she becomes a mother.</br>  I wonder if it's like the thing Rakan fought.  <br>I wonder if Akamatsu makes notes about those little background comments and then develops a storyline about it that can be used somewhere in the future</br>  <br>that's actually an impressive callback.</br>  <br>good idea incompetent</br>  <br>Kirie is best girl, even though she knows that she is helping the competition, she is willing to still help Touta keep the promise. She is really a good girl.</br>  You know, as retarded savescumming is, I'm glad it's here for moments like this one.<br><br>In any other manga they would have just one chance and have to pull one massive asspull.<br><br>At least here even if we know there will be an asspull they will go through a gorillion loops at first to figure out which asspull works and which one does not.<br><br>Although, I wonder how the fuck Kuromaru managed to survive it when Tota and Kirie couldn't even notice it the first time and even when trying to camp him he skill was going to fuck them over sideways to next sunday.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyrie's blushing face is love here.</br>  <br>Kuromaru is an exorcist, he has a lot of skills that helps him fight spirits like this guy. Think of how Kurt was able to hit thunder form Negi back in Negima.</br>  <br>Touta is living the life!</br>  <br>perhaps you want to rephrase that</br>  <br>Pretty sure he noticed the spirit and was observing him, he only got in the range because he saw his friends and got insta-killed.</br>  <br> person who never met Negi saying how strong he was <br>So not only did they make Negi sterile, but now they are downpowering him/making fucking MOOKS his level of strength to prop up Touta as not a total shitlord</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't say she's the best girl, but she's definitely a good one. She isn't devoted to winning at any cost while trampling all over the feelings of her crush. She knows Touta care a lot about fulfilling his promise, and in fact it's one of the things she likes about him, so she'll help him fulfill it.<br><br>Of course, she's not going to stop trying to twist him arm to find out the full story, because she's not an idiot or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Kuro was more like running away from the spirit and then jumped to help Touta and Kyrie which got him insta-killed with them. <br><br><br>Yeah, I really liked that part, I feel it shows she cares about him and the things important to him. Plus I don't blame her for wanting to know, her chances to win the bowl ride on that info. <br><br>I like how in this arc, Kyrie has finally become one of Totua's true friend. I certainly feel she is closer to him than she was before this whole mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Running away from something with lightning speed? He still needed to find a way to take the book, it's unlikely that he gave up.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, you are right, reading it again, it looks like Kuro jumped out of hiding to save those two.</br></br>  <br>They got there a day earlier, meaning Kuro died/fought already their first run to the ruins.</br>  <br><br>High level spirit as strong as Negi, Rakan, and Fate during Negima (technically Negi &gt; both). Power creep is a bitch, but maybe they won't outright beat it.</br></br>  <br> Negi&gt; Rakan <br>Debatable, it's possible he was not even the strongest, considering his rival Fate lost to Eva.</br></br>  <br><br>That thing one-shotted Kirie, Touta, and Kuro twice, I hardly think that calling it as strong as Negi is downplaying Negi's strength.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not really debatable, Negi even hits as hard as Rakan does physically, has faster speed, and high speed regeneration.<br><br>Eva was the strongest character outside The Mage of the Beginning﻿ and possibly Nagi in Negima, so Fate drawing with a weaker version of her while noticeably being stronger than before doesn't say much.<br><br><br><br>As if they're impressive in the grand scheme of things at the moment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder that Kurt Godel managed to land a critical hit on Lightning Negi. Lightning Negi was not that powerful. Rakan only briefly had to get serious with him.<br><br>I'm sure Kuromaru can do the same trick Kurt pulled here.</br></br>  <br> hits as hard as Rakan does physically <br>No, Negi has regen but he is far less durable than Rakan, he managed to last that long against Rakan because he had Asuna's artifact and Rakan was not serious most fo the time.</br></br>  <br><br>Except Negi was much stronger at the end of Negima than he was during his fight against Rakan or Kurt, and ZnT is the ultimate Shinmeiryuu exorcist technique that Kuromaru probably doesn't know - did Setsuna know it? It bypasses magic shields, harms elementals, and should be able to directly target the soul. Tsukuyomi was able to cut up Fate.<br><br>Seeing how Kurt was also able to react to hundreds of Negi lightning clones at that point, you're underselling him. Takahata, Kurt's more or less equal, agreed Negi outstrips him by a very large degree at the end, anyway.<br><br><br><br>Nah, Fate says Negi punches just as hard as Rakan does during their last fight. Fate is well antiquated with Rakan's fists, and he was able to destroy the mandala esque barrier with one punch (he punched Negi countless times after the fact). <br><br>Did you actually read Negima after the Rakan fight?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the guy that Rakan references when he talks about why he can count Negi based on his lightning trails?</br>  <br>Zanmaken no Tachi is good, but he will have to hit him. That thing is lightning speed and can kill him in one hit.</br>  <br>It was a stylistic figure, referring to the feelings he puts in his punches anon, a shonen thing. Negi is faster and has regen, Rakan has more strength and durability.</br>  <br> ZnT is the ultimate Shinmeiryuu exorcist technique that Kuromaru probably doesn't know <br><br>He uses it in like ch 4 I think.</br></br></br>  <br> Except Negi was much stronger at the end of Negima than he was during his fight against Rakan or Kurt <br>Doesn't matter. Lightning is Lightning, and Lightning is vulnerable. Both Rakan and Kurt were able to get hits in. Kuromaru just has to get a hit in.<br><br>That's the point I was trying to make: It doesn't matter how powerful Negi was, or how powerful that lightning spirit is. We know it can be hurt. Like  says, all that's needed is to actually get the hit in.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And now he got hardass training by Dana, he's prolly the strongest of the group right now.</br>  <br><br>No, it was a direct comparison in strength. You're reaching tremendously. Negi took dozens of punches from Fate, who could one shot Quintum in one punch, and took on the Tearing Earth/Thousand Thunderbolts collision. Whether or not Rakan has more durability is up for debate. <br><br><br><br> That's the point I was trying to make: It doesn't matter how powerful Negi was, or how powerful that lightning spirit is. <br> Lightning Negi was not that powerful <br><br>Yeah, okay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> punches Fate <br> Fate blocks it easily <br>Okay.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you retarded and/or can't tell Negi and Fate apart?</br></br>  <br> No, it was a direct comparison in strength. <br>It was not, reread the manga or at least Fate vs Rakan. Tertium was confirmed to be the strongest Fate, and as the Fate of earth, he had more physical strength than the other clones. Rakan's physical strength and durability is one of his greatest strength, Negi is absolutely not as strong as him in that department. I don't know who has more strength between Negi and Fate but Jack is above both.</br></br>  <br> Anything wrong <br>Maybe Homura summoned them.</br></br>  <br><br> Ignores direct evidence and brings up irrelevant shit <br><br>Yeah, get over it. Fate and Negi are pretty much Rakan's equals in physical strength near the end of the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because you think it's irrelevant that you don't get this scene. And he says just now, do you believe his physical strength suddenly increased or what? You are just a Negi fanboy.</br>  <br>I thought that was the whole fucking point of a power up after mastering ME? goddamn anon learn to fucking read</br>  <br><br>RT2 Negi just started fighting Fate with his fists just then during the fight, you idiot. Fate makes a comment that Negi's punch is far stronger than Quintum's earlier as well, who he compared unfavorably to Rakan. <br><br>No matter how you cut it, Fate directly compared his strength to Rakan's. Rakan not being the absolute strongest is sad, but facts are facts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And for how long was he fighting Fate in ME?</br>  <br><br> &gt;I wonder if it's like the thing Rakan fought. <br> that's actually an impressive callback. <br>I wonder if they are a standard protection tool for interesting sites.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Kuro with them now? Is that how her power worked? I can't remember.</br>  <br> Kirië's blushing face is love here. <br>Indeed. I didn't notice that.</br></br>  <br>she was touching him, so he appeared at the save point too.<br><br>I think it would be best that maybe only kirie resets and let kuromaru and touta fight, as they die and recover over and over they¡'ll get used to the guy and beat it.</br></br></br>  <br>With how quickly that thing blew them out, I'd get the feeling it'd take both quite a long while to regenerate from that. And following their regeneration, it'd probably insta-gib them again in an endless cycle of death and reincarnation.</br>  <br><br>loved this moment.</br></br>  <br>This. The series was missing something from the beginning. I'm not sure, but whatever it was, it's starting to get it.</br>  <br> Adad in Akkadian and Ishkur in Sumerian and Hadad in Aramaic and &gt;Arabic language, are the names of the storm-god in the Akkadian, &gt;Assyrian and Babylonian </br>  <br> thunder spirt <br>THUNDER IS NOT LIGHTNING<br><br>NOT SO VERY FRIGHTENING</br></br></br></br>  <br>without lightning there is no Thunder.<br>which means he is also a lightning spirit.<br>Thats basic.</br></br></br>  <br>Touta will pull a Rakan.</br>  Touta will go Raiten Taisou by absorbing the next lightning blast with his magia erebea.  <br>Prove it motherfucker. Asuna says that Negi and the person he loves are alike and I can't think of anyone as similar mentally to Negi in Negima than her.</br>  <br>It could be Yue, you know. They're both brainiacs as far as Asuna's concerned.</br>  <br>That's true, but she loved Negi but the Epilogue rejects both her and Nodoka.</br>  <br><br>For all we know he didn't survive it and only saved them the second time because of a timing coincidence. Like the first time he was observing it for a while, maybe got his ass murdered a few times, then buggered off to rethink his strategy.</br></br>  <br>She need to win and i want her to win but she gonna get cucked</br>  <br>He needs to protect this smile</br>  <br>doesn´t matter if she realy dies.<br>Her second ability is reincarnation.</br></br>  <br><br>I am just here for Negi and wanting to kill myself the further on I go with UQ. I don't give a fuck who wins.</br></br>  <br>It doesn't fucking matter.<br><br>Listen: Power levels DO NOT FUCKING MATTER ANYMORE.<br><br>The enemy Touta's group is fighting can kill them in one hit, and Kuro can likely kill it in one hit.<br><br>So it doesn't matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is a exorcist of course he could kill a Spirit.<br>It´s his fucking job.<br>There is a differents between could kill and can kill.<br>every Shinmei-ryū swordsman could kill Negi with the right technique but almost no one can.So power levels do matter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Touta is too weak to do that, he will have to pull something with his friends to trick the spirit so either he or Kuro can do something.</br>  <br>Touta now has a lot of smiles he has to protect... sadly that means that the boy will fail to protect all of them.</br>  <br>Nah, Touta will beat this guy be rebouncing his attack with his new counter move.</br>  <br>Of course.But he could feel it in the air when he got attacked.</br>  <br>I think that was the static elec from the thunder blast coming to them. Or maybe Touta having good senses?</br>  <br>high level but not the highest yet its as strong as negi who was the strongest ...................................<wbr></wbr></br>  <br>  strongest <br>unlikely. And as strong is kinda vague. itý most likely Magia erebia Negi without his speels just good old punching.</br></br>  <br>I don't believe what inexperienced people say anon, it's called being gullible.</br>  <br><br><br> Is this the guy that Rakan references when he talks about why he can count Negi based on his lightning trails? <br>this was my first thought<br><br>and it seems like the dungeon is the "noctis labyrint dungeon" maybe touta will get another ME upgrade or some kind of artifact, hell maybe the spirit has become one of rakans friends<br><br>got i love these little references</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Negi can't be killed because he's fucking immortal you idiot Against any other entity, something like ZnT would be a kill.<br><br>Why the hell are you so peeved at the idea of there being an entity as powerful as Negi? As powerful as Negi doesn't mean as unkillable as Negi.<br><br>There is absolutely no reason to doubt, or even be upset, at the idea of there being a high level thunder spirit that's as powerful as Negi was. Negi's strength was his intelligence and immortality, not his raw power output.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It´s the ultimate Spirit of Lightning.<br>is now everything fine? The chapter before we got a Rakan reference and know this.coincident? i think not.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they are in the past, back in the day where Nagi and friends where active, so maybe Touta will meet Rakan if he keeps running around the place.</br>  <br> Maybe they are in the past <br><br> touta and friends die a few more times  <br> suddenly a young rakan is there and helps them kill the spirit <br> this is the fight that rakan was referring to during the negi fight </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a monster as powerful as Negi! <br>Would Akamatsu stop shitting on Negima already?<br>First Eva, now Negi, next what he's gonna do, tell us that Keitaro and Naru died?</br></br></br>  <br>But we knew of this guy from Negima, Rakan mentioned him when he fought Negi so it's just a callback. Get over yourself.<br><br><br>Yep, that would be a great twist, and I bet that Rakan and Touta would just get along like best bros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  It's like he doesn't give a fuck about Negima. <br>Bingo.<br> ell the fact that Eva is a totally different character(in personality) <br>Don't forget the looks, Adult Eva looks nowhere near her Negima princess-like self.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why the hell are you so peeved at the idea of there being an entity as powerful as Negi <br>I am not.I don´t care about Power Levels.<br>But Negi is a Demon that's why I thought a Swordsmanship which is specialized at slaying Demons<br>could kill him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Adult Eva looks nowhere near her Negima princess-like self. <br>because eva is immitating her own mother<br>do you even read the manga or are you only here to shitpost?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just ignore him, he is just being annoying.</br></br>  Negi being as strong as the ultimate spirit of lightning is fine. The strongest entities are likely spirits. People find it odd because Negi was the third/fourth strongest character in Negima and they're obviously going to beat it - we already have Dana clearly being stronger than Negi. <br><br>It's unlikely they're in the past and Rakan will show up, though.</br></br>  <br>Negi's not a demon. He's an immortal monster. So resilient, that the Mage of the Beginning desired him as a potential permanent host. If mere demons could attain such immortality, the Mage would've just gone for one of them. Negi is a true monster, on a level that surpasses even demons. At least in terms of immortality. Not power.<br><br><br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if it was the same "EVA'S HAIR IS CHANGED FOR NO REASON IT'S RUINED FOREVER" autist who shit up UQ threads for months and months on end when the manga first started.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does this negate what I said?<br>L2r and get the message right before posting.</br></br>  <br>I honestly don't think Touta and Co will directly beat the guy, they probably will find someway to sneak around the guy, or they will plan something to seal the guy up or buy time for Kuro to do an exorcism. They probably could have Touta do his counter thing, which probably could work. <br><br>So basically I expect the guys to get around this on a technicality, or for young Rakan to appear and help them.</br></br></br>  <br> autist who shit up UQ threads for months and months <br>  /a/ in charge of one person <br><br>There's a limit even with delusions, people legitimately complained about eva's shittier looks with good reason. I understand that it makes it easier for you to ignore if you just think it being "one person", but it's really not how it went.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nerve struck!<br>I get a thousand points!</br></br>  <br> I win! </br>  <br>You have been at this for more than two years. The rest who have complained moved on. You need to move on too if you don't like it.</br>  <br>Bet you said this to every single one of the many who complained.</br>  <br>Actually I haven't said anything to those who complained until now.<br>I let others complain about you. The only left complaining is you, and you need to go away already.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I do.<br><br>I mean, there's a demonstrated and proven reason for Eva's behavior and change of appearance, and yet you're still acting like a little bitch about it on an imageboard.<br>A fictional character has a hairstyle you don't like. The fuck you gonna do about it?</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Actually her face changed too. Why are you going on with this hairstyle thing no one brought up?</br>  <br>Jesus fucking christ dude, it's magic.<br>Jesus christ.<br>She does it to look more like her mother.<br>The fuck is your problem?<br>Holy shit dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's at least two   in this thread so your logic kinda falls apart</br>  <br>I really don't get why you insist explaining obvious things to me.<br> she looks fugly now <br> but that's because this this this this <br> okay but she still looks ba <br> and this and this and this! <br><br>I mean c'mon, it's not that hard to get the point of the critic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And it's not hard to get my point:<br>This fucker has been derailing threads about this since the day the fucking manga started.</br></br>  <br>Your point is unrelated, so who the fuck cares?<br>It's like telling a painter his works suck and he keeps coming on how his brush was old and his house crooky, either he's deflecting or just a pure autist.</br></br>  <br> because this this this this <br> and this and this and this! </br></br>  <br> Your point is unrelated, so who the fuck cares? <br>I care about perfectly good threads getting shit up by a guy who only comes to them so he can bitch about a fictional character not meeting his stringent personal fucking standards, you stupid little cunt.<br><br>Now fuck off, we're trying to discuss power levels.</br></br></br></br>  Like I said, if just ignore the guys, you won't make them change their minds by arguing so why bother.  <br> I'm not really sure how to defend my argument <br> I-I'll just call him bait and hopefully everything will be alright </br></br>  <br>Actually if you'd just accepted  and  opinions nothing would have been shat up.</br>  <br>His opinions are retarded so why he or anyone accept it?</br>  <br>See, now who's shitting up the thread?</br>  <br>freedom of speech!</br>  <br>You.</br>  <br>Thanks for proving my point.</br>  <br><br>stop</br></br>  Negi was never interested in Eva. You Negi self inverters are hilarious.  <br>Negi never saw Eva as a lover but more as a teacher and so did Eva.<br><br>Eva was only toying with him pre Mundus Magicus</br></br></br>  <br> and so did Eva. <br>Uuuhhmm...</br></br>  <br>The problem is that there is suddenly a lot of people that is stronger than Negi that shows up out of fucking nowhere. Two or three? Sure. Make it a whole species. That's where you fucked up.</br>  <br>This. Eva got demoted into Dana's mook underling. Negi is now inferior to some nameless monster. <br>Next turn they're gonna tell us that Rakan is inferior to the Drakan, "that super race of dragon-warriors" whose babies can hit harder than him because fuck negima's characters.</br></br>  <br>Anon, we already knew of these guys from Negima, that's why it's not an asspull and can you honestly expect Kuro and Co to be correct about powerlevels. They have been wrong most of the time so far, so don't take it too seriously.</br>  <br>We knew they existed, not that they nullified the main character's powerlevels. It's a big difference.</br>  <br>How do they nullify the main character's power levels, it's the ultimate spirit of thunder, it honestly doesn't surprise me that it is at a similar level to what Negi could do in his RT form.</br>  <br>Rakan is already equel to the strongest Dragon.<br>They are buddys.</br></br>  <br> Make it a whole species. That's where you fucked up. <br>There is no guarantee that nobles are all as strong as Dana. For all we know she might be among the strongest.</br></br>  <br>When some random monster guarding some shitty ruins in a side-quest is as strong as the Main Character it pretty much nullifies him.</br>  <br>And so what if that happen?</br>  <br>She was mostly teasing you know. Stop self inserting into Negi.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Shitting on the best and most beloved characters of the series isn't exactly a wise move anon.</br>  <br>Must be why Frieza was portrayed as strong as Guldo right? That totally doesn't ruin a character.</br>  <br><br>Dude, look... knowing Dana these ruins are probably some very important place in Mundus Magicus which is why that guy is guarding them, and having spirits as strong as Negi should not be surprising, specially since Rakan already compared the two. <br><br>Sometimes I feel that you guys just overreact to everything, and look for things to complain about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone being stronger than a character mean that said character is being shat on? I really don't understand your logic?</br>  <br>We don't even know if that spirit is on the same level as Negi.<br><br>Touta stated that Karen Da was as strong as fate, it only shows how much of a powergap there is that they can't assume the actual power of the stronger characters.<br><br>All we know is that the spirit is a very strong magic user, I wouldn't say it is stronger than Quintum.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It actually makes sense for the literal spirit-incarnation of lightning to be at least equal to a guy who gets a lightning form from just absorbing a few spells.<br><br>Not to mention that Negi's strength lies not in his raw stats, but his tactical and analytical genius that lets him use magic in unique ways. Negi would defeat the spirit, even if their raw stats are the same.</br></br></br>  <br>yes that totally doesn't ruin a character.</br>  <br>Try reading my posts and you'll get it. I didn't say "someone", I said "some random monster" which is different.</br>  <br> Make it a whole species. <br>well basically we got the averuncus series wich are all extremely powerfull and created by one guy</br></br>  <br>Of course they are looking for stuff to shitpost about. They have been at it for two fucking years. It's not like these threads are active enough either.</br>  <br>That random monster was mentioned in Negima by Rakan.</br>  <br>Said "random monster" is a literal incarnation of lighting, a very strong one at that and Rakan already said that he fought someone like that before, and even if he is only a random monster, again, so what? Powerlevel is really the defining trait of a character for you?</br>  <br/>  <br>You are making it look like you self inserted into Negi hard. Also It was hinted there were a bunch of strong stuff out there in the magicus mundus arc.</br>  <br/>  <br> knowing Dana <br>That's the problem here. She thinks that Touta can and his team can take on a creature that is said to be stronger than Negi. Why does Akamatsu keep shitting on Negima and jack off Touta and his dream team?</br></br>  <br>In a shounen fighting series nullifying the hero's status from "strongest" to "strong as some random monster" is a pretty big shit down.</br>  <br> stronger than Negi <br>was never said.</br></br>  <br> hat is said to be stronger than Negi. <br>Why do you keep acting like a idiot just to jack off Negi?</br></br>  <br>But there is no guarantee that it nullifies the powerlevels. The powergap between Touta/Co and even anyone on the Negima top tiers is so vast that to them everyone seems equally broken after a certain level.<br><br><br> She thinks that Touta can and his team can take on a creature <br>No she doesn't. We don't know what Dana thinks and even if we theorize, it's more likely that she sent them there so that they could reach a new level of mastery of their abilities and complete their goal without needing to defeat the lightning spirit in the first place..<br><br><br>He was never stated to be the strongest, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As powerful now means stronger than according to anon. <br>Plus Negi has something called smarts.</br></br>  <br><br> grammar nazis ignoring the point <br><br>Not even that dude, but please stop. It's obvious what kind of point he was trying to bring across.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she expects them to rough it out as inmortals and find some way to outsmart the thing. They don't have to kill the thing, they just have to get inside the ruins and get the books, and that's probably what Dana wants them to do. <br><br>Basically there is probably some trick to deal with this, and the guys need to find it.</br></br></br>  <br> random monster <br>It was said he was the strongest magician and for now that´s true.</br></br>  <br>The point is that you and the other guy are homosexuals for Negi.</br>  inb4 Touta is Jack Rakan.  <br>"strongest magician" what, that lighting spirit?<br>Source?</br></br>  <br>I think he was talking about Negi or nagi being the strongest magician. Well other than the life maker.<br>The lightning spirit is a monster not a magician.</br></br>  <br>I am talking about Negi.</br>  <br><br>Mage of the Beginning &gt; Dana &lt;=&gt; Other Noble Vampires &gt;&gt; Evangeline =&gt; Nagi (who knows?) =&gt; Negi = Lightning Spirit &gt; Fate &gt; Rakan &gt; Everyone else<br><br>You're exaggerating.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Okay, as strong as Negi. But my points still stand. Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? If they really manage to finish this without defeating the monster, I congratulate Akamatsu for not being a total hack.</br></br></br>  <br>Trips don't lie. People who complain about every little thing that pertains to Negi in Uq holder! confirmed for homosexual.</br>  <br>Which we thought to be super amazing and instead is just on the same level as some spirit, no matter how high in rank.<br>It's kinda the same fate that happened to Eva, being declassed from the stupidly-strong-Shinso-Vampire she was in Negima into a plaything of the "upper race" here.<br><br>Sucks man.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? <br>Because they literally have one guy that fighting style is made to deal with guys like that, they are all immortals and have infinite tries thanks to the save point? It's not exactly hard science.</br></br>  <br> Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? <br>Because she probably doesn't.<br> If they really manage to finish this without defeating the monster <br>You have to be brainless if you think it's not going in that direction.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dana &lt;=&gt; Other Noble Vampires &gt;&gt; Evangeline <br>I am not so sure about this.<br>Fate said he could beat her maybe the way she is know.<br>which means she is weaker than her sealed self.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They've said several times that something happened to Eva to weaken her after the event in Negima.</br>  <br> You have to be brainless if you think it's not going in that direction. <br>I'm gonna save this for future use.</br></br>  <br>Eva isn't at her best though either. She has weakened for whatever reason.</br>  <br>With the direction the series is going, Touta is going to use his finishing move and erase the spirit because IT'S MOTHERFUCKING TOUTA.</br>  <br> some spirit <br>Do you know what Ultimate Spirite of Lightning means?<br>and he has a Name Ishkur.</br></br></br>  <br> Why does Dana think that Touta and his team can take on a creature as strong as Negi? <br>Well that can try to kill it infinite times.<br>Touta has ME wich activates in critical situations.<br><br> If they really manage to finish this without defeating the monster, I congratulate Akamatsu for not being a total hack. <br>This is just like the dragon under the Library Iland, Negi never had to fight against it even tho he trained to fight it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Eva's weaker in UQ Holder, but I had her stronger state in mind. Dana can still clearly toy around with her regardless.</br></br>  <br>Such better times, such more lovable characters.<br>Sigh.</br></br>  <br> akamatsu actually thought making her an adult would be an improvement <br>at least he's trying to fix it by involving kitty<br>you simply can't beat this, ah, character design</br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Negi be equal to Fate, considering they fought to a standstill and Fate simply gave up because Negi convinced him that there is a better way?<br>It's also not knowing whether Rakan is weaker than Fate, since the only fight they had was basically negated because of Fate's Code of the Lifemaker.</br></br>  <br>Because that's when Akamatsu actually think before writing something. I remembered that people say that he was only really trying to make a shonen fighting manga. Now he gets his dream. Should have just made it a different series to be honest.</br>  <br>But even her stronger state is weaker than her real state.</br>  <br>Her design got shittier too, like, her body and face.</br>  <br><br>No, Fate outright states Negi is his superior in their fight. <br><br>Fate could keep up with RT2 Negi in speed, got stronger, and can now stalemate Eva (albeit weakened). Rakan doesn't have the feats to match.<br><br><br><br>The fight was cut short before it got fully serious, but wasn't Eva capable of going all out during her fight against Negi at the end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some sucky resolution buddy.<br>Here, allow me to fix it.</br></br>  The self insertion is strong in this thread.  <br>People can care about a manga's characters and consistency without self inserting anon.</br>  <br>Nobody said otherwise, this thread, however, is full of Negi self insert.</br>  <br>But there are no problems with consistency so far. People are just butthurt that the setting isn't sucking the dicks of their favorite characters.</br>  <br>How come? Didn't see anything like that so far.</br>  <br>Sounds like an excuse to justify some of the shitty turns this sequel took.</br>  <br>The Mage of the Beginning can't be too strong since he lost once against Nagi + Zect and later in Zects body against Nagi. He also lost against Negi and Asuna but that's probably because Magic Cancell being a god tier ability. Eva also said she killed him on her path of revenge.<br><br>Nagi = Eva(negima) = LifeMaker &gt; Dana =&gt; Eva(UQ with ME) &gt; Fate(UQ) &gt;= Zect(?) = Negi(ME) = Fate(negima) = Rakan = Eva(UQ) &gt; OtherAverruncus &gt; UltimateLightningSpirit &gt;&gt;&gt; Demon God (KyotoArc)<br><br>We don't know if Eva surpassed Dana and is now weaker than her because sealings and shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Asuna and the Master of the Gravekeeper's Palace are not on the list but notable strong characters</br>  <br><br>Are you forgetting Lifemaker easily paralyzing Eva and her shitting her pants in his presence? <br><br>Eva isn't stronger than Dana no matter what, this is clearly established by her reverence.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The Mage of the Beginning can't be too strong <br>Anon, you're ignoring a simple fact: The MoB's power is dependent on his host body. None of the bodies he had so far came close to his original one, which was so powerful he could overlay Mars with his magic to create an entire living world.<br><br>This is obvious when you consider that Eva killed him the right after becoming a vampire, despite not having any magic or familiarity with her new body yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Eva isn't stronger than Dana no matter what, this is clearly established by her reverence. <br>Not really. They haven't met in over two centuries, which is the time period in which Eva reached the peak of her power, so it's unknown whether Dana is stronger than her.</br></br>  Well, for all I see you guys discussing power level's and all that are quite stupid, also the ones that can't take that their character might be compared to something should try to focus on other stuff<br>I like power level's but it's best to think of them like variations, like Negi's power in said moment is a variation from 500 to 1000, been 500 his worst condition and 1000 his best. Also, there is something like advantage and all that, like Asuna, who could easily "defeat" Eva because her ability is REALY strong against images, but if she fought a knight, she would probably lose.<br>In Dana and Eva's case, since Eva learned everything from her it might be that Dana has an advantage because she knows what Eva is using and her quirks.</br></br>  <br><br>It's been established the extent of Eva's decline in UQ isn't completely drastic, yet Dana is easily going through her shields and fucking with her illusion spell without even trying. <br><br>Until further notice, and with all the info we currently have to go on, Eva is clearly inferior via general statements, character portrayal, and demonstrations of power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't go by that. Nagi beat her at the height of her power with fucking garlic soup even though she's immune to general vampire weaknesses.<br><br>She just can't fight seriously unless she's going for the kill.</br></br></br>  <br>That was a joke fight anon.</br>  <br> Eva got demoted into Dana's mook underling <br>We should note that Eva is said to be weaker than she used to be. She used Magia Erebea on Fate when she was easily handling the other Averuncus. Dana also has the advantage of having plenty of knowledge on Eva.</br></br>  <br> Rakan that low </br>  <br> She used Magia Erebea on Fate when she was easily handling the other Averuncus <br><br>Fate was much stronger than the others even during Negima, both him and Negima one shotted or simply raped the ones they encountered.<br><br><br><br>Rakan dick rider, please go. Everyone loves him, but it's excessive at times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> extent of Eva's decline in UQ isn't completely drastic <br>Looking at her fight with the other Averuncus clones &amp; then her UQ Holder fight with Fate, she's easily weaker.<br><br> Dana is easily going through her shields and fucking with her illusion spell without even trying <br>This is Dana, the one who trained her &amp; thus should know plenty about her. Dana easily has the information advantage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fate was much stronger than the others even during Negima <br>At minimum, Fate struggled against a fellow Averuncus. Fate won because of his superior physical stats. Eva played multiple ones like a flute.</br></br>  <br> she's easily weaker. <br><br>Obviously, but she's still capable of fighting on par with people like Fate, Negi, and Rakan. All three can beat the Averuncus series with one punch. <br><br>Dana styling on Eva was clearly meant to be a demonstration of superiority after Eva's declaration of the nobility's power, and is followed by Fate being awed. <br><br><br><br>One punch would end all of them. Imagine an actual spell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fanservice shot of the season, for me at least.<br>Innocent and lewd and loli.</br>  Sore ga frontbutt  She stole the slut crown from Ringo.

I'm pretty much right off of Tae Kim and just started よつばと！ and there's multiple spots I was confused at that just ended up being slang. Stuff like 怖い being written as こえ.

What's easy for Japanese kids is not necessarily what's easy for adult Japanese learners. I'm not sure it even makes sense to recommend people start off with Yotsuba, graded readers or an appropriate novel might be a better choice.  <br> 予襲 <br>"previous attack". Infer what it means with the meaning of the Kanji as it's a made up word.

Know it already?<br><br>終焉</br></br></br>  <br><br>It has been proven many times, but you do not acquire language through production. You acquire through input (reading / listening). The only reason a conversation might be a good thing is to listen to the responses, but it's no different than consuming media. That is how you get good at understanding a language.</br></br>  <br> I don't see how grinding vocab in kanji makes reading kana any harder, <br><br>It makes it harder because you're seeing the word in a form you're not used to seeing and it's more difficult to distinguish vocab from grammar. Japanese kids know a lot of vocab but not much kanji, that's why Yotsuba is easy for them. Adult learners usually know a lot of kanji but not that much vocab, pretty much the opposite of what shit written for kids assumes you know.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, thanks though. I guess I'll just read a chuuni vn to get new ones.</br>  <br> wah why won't DJT help me increase my kanji grid dick size <br>Holy shit quit acting like such a self-entitled manchild just because people wouldn't spoonfeed you rare words to learn out of context. Go read pretentious chuunishit or something if you really care that much about kanji count; at least then you'll actually be learning the words in context instead of mining a dictionary like a moron.</br></br>  <br> You acquire through input <br> I have been watching Japanese media since I was in Elementary school <br><br>Why am I not fluently speaking Japanese?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It has been proven many times <br>Citation kudasai.</br></br>  <br>You still know how the words supposed to be read. Read it aloud and you get it.</br>  <br>Because you was watching it with subs? Just hearing words isn't input, you have to listen to them.</br>  <br>Because you weren't listening to the Japanese, you were too busy thinking in English.<br><br><br>Look up Stephen Krashen, he has some talks in Youtube which he shows a bunch of studies that show kids who read acquire languages much faster.</br></br></br></br>  Nandeska watashi hontoni imouto magi magi sugoii soda desu gozaimasu wake ga nai. Kimochi shimo chansu dakke? B-bacca!!  <br>You do realize people don't talk with kanji right? You're going to have to learn to recognize words like that at some point. This is a classic problem that beginners have and it usually stems from a lack of listening practice. I'm sure in 2 years from now you'll be complaining about how your listening level is so shit compared to your reading.</br>  <br><br>Die job, piggy jiggy jig arimas.</br></br>  <br><br>Good Point. <br><br>How do I watch anime with Japanese subtitles?</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure in 2 years from now you'll be complaining about how your listening level is so shit compared to your reading. <br><br>I doubt it, I only care about being able to read and I'm sure a lot of people here are the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Except writing exists to represent speech so you can't really ignore speech if you want to understand writing.</br>  <br> I only care about being able to read <br>And that will be the extent of your care going into the far future too?</br></br>  <br>And that's why no-one understands Latin or Ancient Greek anymore, right?<br><br><br>Everything is already subbed, using study time to practice listening seems completely pointless to me.

They are translated into living languages as a means of comprehension. The "dead" Latin which is used by the Vatican, etc. is the perfect example of this: the spoken language has become lost and as a means to continue using it people have used rules and patterns of relative living languages in order for them to be functional.

You are always going to be limited by your listening ability.

In response to asking if you'd ever care about listening, you said that listening is pointless. Finally, you said you'll never have to learn to listen if your only goal is to read, which is by your admittance your only goal. You're the one that can't even keep up with what you say.</br>  <br> Scholars of dead languages don't read those languages as primary languages. <br><br>It doesn't matter, they still read them fluently, which is the only point of discussion here.

Enjoy.</br>  <br>ありがとう。thanks for taking me seriously and not giving a DJT blind praising answer.</br>  <br>That's the reading list, not the guide.</br>  <br>Yeah, that was cool. There's way too many commercials, though, is this normal for TV? They're making me fucking hungry.</br>  <br> There's way too many commercials, though, is this normal for TV? <br>I didn't watch the stream but yes, tv is awful.</br></br>  i'm a neet and i'm fucked  <br>The main site links one reading list and the guide links another one. The one linked by the guide appears to be an updated version but it still looks kind of messy.</br>  <br>Nobody told you to look at the reading list, we told you to read the guide.<br><br>But my legitimate suggestion remains </br></br></br>  <br>You have me mistaken. I was explaining why I thought the poster complaining about the guide was confused.</br>  <br>Deaf people vocalise. Signs are mapped to values the brain processes in the same way people process phonetics. Sign languages are also based on other languages, using movements to signal sound groups. <br><br>Even people who were born deaf still "sound" things out when reading. It's kind of hard to describe. Feel free to look it up. It's rather fascinating.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget to check the schedule.<br><br>And yeah, TV just has way too many fucking ads. I think this is one thing that's pretty much constant no matter where in the world you go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how do I look that up that sounds very interesting.</br>  <br>Reading is unrelated.<br>The signing bit was what mattered.<br>It's a form of communication, and yet, it's not based off of sound whatsoever.</br></br></br>  <br>what channel, so I can check the schedule?</br>  <br> Sign languages are also based on other languages, using movements to signal sound groups. <br>That actually isn't true, sign languages are developed by deaf people independently from regular ones, as they can't exactly hear the sounds to base their speech on.<br><br><br>The argument was about learning reading without speech.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's the schedule link on the page<br> I don't any anime on the schedule, what a shit channel </br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's not just one channel. The person streaming is in control.<br><br>Just click the button that says Scheduled Programs at the top to see what the streamer has lined up.</br></br></br>  <br>seriously what is this called so I can look it up?? there has to be a term for this, this is fascinating.</br>  <br>http://psych.nyu.edu/pelli/docs/azb<wbr>el2004intel.pdf</wbr></br>  <br>Worldstarhiphop posted a pretty good video recently of two deaf nignogs fighting, and signing in each others faces periodically whenever there was a break from the grappling.</br>  <br>Thanks!</br>  illaura dot blogspot dot com<br><br>a hamplanet is better at japanese than you faggots, what do?</br></br>  <br>No matter what obstacles Nature puts in their way, niggers will find a way to nig.</br>  I assume the majority of people here learned English as their native language. Is anyone here with a different mother tongue trying to learn Japanese? I have noticed that Japanese pronunciation is easier for Spanish speakers and I'm curious if the same thing applies to other Languages.<br><br>I imagine it might have very little effect on writing and reading though.</br></br>  <br> implying she understands japanese and isn't on mt. stupid <br> &gt;implying your bait isn't shit quality </br></br>  so what do you guys normally do a day?<br>i just read vns and anki really.</br>  <br>Shitpost here all day long</br>  <br>I'm not English native, but other than being able to pronounce らりるれろ without much problems there were no benefits.</br>  おにいちゃんたちのにほんごがよみたい  <br>oh you...</br>  <br>Anki 2/6k for ~400 reps, 1-2 chapters of manga, some grammar, and lots of shitposting.</br>  <br>I want her to be my personal piece of Japan.</br>  anybody here try time travellers, its not that hard but i don't really have time to look up words that aren't as familiar to me as the text is too fast and you're timed.<br><br>I got used to reading fast and now i can pretty much speed read now, even if i miss some stuff i get more or less what is going on.<br><br>So yeah its really useful</br></br></br></br>  <br>Should the particle が here be を instead or am I mistaken?</br>  <br>Bet you want to suck his dick too.</br>  萎縮  <br>Here's a form of writing that you'll never be able to speak.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SignW<wbr>riting</wbr></br></br>  <br>Both are acceptable. Once you conjugate a verb into the たい form it technically becomes an adjective, after all.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense. Thank you.</br>  <br> it's not based off of sound whatsoever <br>The point is that it uses a system of pseudo-phonetics which activate the same areas of the brain which spoken language activates. It is fundamentally different from a system of symbolism or concepts. When deaf people sign they are "speaking" similar to how non-deaf people do when speak to each other. <br><br>It is based on the same thing sound is based off: a system of movements representing a 'sound unit', not a concept. This parallels with reading in regards to Japanese in that when reading your brain is 'vocalizing' the words and the brain relates the sound units to meaning primarily and not word units as concepts to meaning. <br><br>In a means of representation:<br>[word] house → [vocalize] "house" → [meaning] object/action which we have ascribed to the sound via experience<br><br>[word] 家 → [vocalize] "いえ" → [meaning] object/action which we have ascribed to the sound via experience<br><br>In order to read fluently in Japanese you have to be able to read the sentence in 'sounds' to the related meaning. Many learners build up their reading ability by using English as a crutch, which is not a negative thing as it is useful, but what someone who claims to be able to read "fluently" yet has poor listening ability is ultimately using kanji and familiar word groups to filter them through English to meaning instead of Japanese sound to meaning. This is why as listening and speaking ability increases it increases the ability to be able to read without translating in your head. It is the difference between going from Japanese word to Japanese sound to Japanese concept and Japanese word to Japanese sound to English concept.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It is truly a homage to the successful process of natural selection pressure.</br>  everybody we came so far lets not lose, have short term, like something you can achieve by the end of this year. Have some goal in mind<br><br/></br>  <br>You're shifting goalposts. Just admit you're wrong.</br>  <br>このろりこんどもめ</br>  <br>That whole shitposting chain started when some guy had problems with yotsuba because he didn't vocalize kanji while learning vocab, that post is putting goalposts back from dead language bullshit.</br>  <br>It doesn't really matter how brain learns languages in this case, to be honest. Even some of the grammar wouldn't make sense if you don't vocalize kanji when reading, not to mention how the words aren't going to be always spelled the same way as they are in anki and dictionaries.<br><br>One plot point based on mispronunciation/mishearing of some word and our hero "fluent" in reading Japanese wouldn't understand shit.</br></br></br>  Is production an absolute necessity for learning Japanese? I'm pretty antisocial so I can't see myself conversing in Japanese much if not at all but I still want to be able to read and listen to the language, but a lot of places I look say that conversation is pretty vital, is this true?  中に出されるの喜び  <br>Production practice = grammar practice, it's easier to get grammar after you write some shit using it. Feel free to ignore speaking, though.</br>  <br>だいしゅきホールド</br>  <br>I'd say it's necessary if you want to say you know Japanese. You have to eventually develop an active vocabulary and practice all of that with your mouth.<br><br>Production in itself doesn't do anything to help your Japanese, though. You learn by input (reading and listening).</br></br></br>  <br> Production in itself doesn't do anything to help your Japanese, though. <br>Thanks for the laugh.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12874940 <br>www.vocaroo.com</br>  <br>meant for<br/></br>  こんな物で呼び出している矛盾に気がつこう  Anyone know what this illegible fucker is meant to be?  <br>高らかに　= loudky</br>  <br><br>Thanks, was looking for kanji resembling 真 since that's the closest I thought it resembled.</br></br>  <br>だいしゅきホールド：　leg wrap<br><br><br>真に似た漢字を探しているの？このなかにある？<br>直　算　具　員</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah aniki, meant I thought the one in  looked like it so I was searching for similar ones, but was completely wrong as it was just 高 as  said.</br></br>  スティーブに中に出されるの喜び  スティーブにレイプされたい<br>スティーブ大好き</br>  I'm starting to suspect that the review interval is wrong in anki.  スティーブ...奥におして...はやく...もうちょっといく...「わ<wbr>たくし」と言いながら奥におして、中にだして、はやく！ああもうだめだ！あ<wbr>ああああんんんん～～～！！！</wbr></wbr>  Do you know how to make anki not jump/scroll down to the answer page?<br><br>I'm doing the core2k/6k deck, and this only happens sometimes, but it'll jump below the white line.

How would you guys translate to English the phrase: Hissatsu (必殺)<br><br>Direct translation of it would be "Certain Kill" or "Death Blow" and if you know your Chinese Cartoons/Comics you know that characters love spouting this phrase before unleashing their super moves and shit.

So maintaining it as such seems redundant.<br><br>The usual pattern would be the character going:<br><br> Hissatsu: (Technique Name) <br><br>But translating it as "Certain Kill" or "Deathblow" sounds awkward. Maintaining the same connotation, I've come up with<br><br> Finishing Move: <br> Final Technique:  <br><br>As possible translations with the same connotation that the character intends to end things with this move. But on my personal autism that these end up being misnomers (with Hissatsus rarely being Hissatsus), a translation I'm floating towards would be<br><br> Ultimate Technique:  <br><br>Or something along those lines. Any thoughts on this? Or would it really be best to just go fuck it and maintain the translation as "Deathblow" or "Certain Kill"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's a terrible idea and very counter productive.<br><br>Language doesn't work like that, at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it's a meme.</br>  <br> That's a terrible idea and very counter productive. <br>What makes you say that?</br></br>  <br>It's not like if they're voicing technique names that it's supr srs bsns that the guy literally certainly kills the other.</br>  <br><br>Because words don't mean the exact same things between languages.<br><br>と is not "and" for instance.
