Maybe this will fix the weird high pitch noise I get sometimes when e.g. clothing rustling, some voices starting.</br></br></br>  <br> Kajou is actually a likable character who isn't a slut, nor a hypocrite, and has a very positive, healthy outlook on sex as more than just bumping uglies </br>  <br>no, you just hate actual fun</br>  <br>Is Gouriki a 45 year old in disguise?</br>  Not really.<br>Just meh.</br>  How does goriki not get expelled for his constant violent screaming outbursts<br>I'd be terrified to be in school with him</br>  <br>Nope, prison school is way more funnier than this shit. I like both of them though.</br>  No, it's good but Wakaba girl has better comedy  So Funi's double censor rip is the only choice for this show?  <br><br>Ah, ended up not fixing it.

Simply replacing words in a regular sentence with sex related terms and screaming sex related stuff at the top of your lungs isn't my idea of funny, in fact it's obnoxious and juvenile<br><br> I bet your humor must be so mature <br><br>No, sex humor can be funny if it's done correctly. I think this anime handles it poorly to the point it's exasperating and hard to watch.<br><br>I'm going to have to strongly disagree with you, OP but I'm rather surprised and a bit disappointed at the fact many will agree with you. As disappointing as this anime is I still can't drop it out of morbid curiosity though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh Shit, this is a comedy? Why is it so unfunny then?</br>  <br>because your a humorless cunt?</br>   penis penis vagina vagina <br> best comedy of the season <br>Looks like this season is fucked</br></br>  <br>man the fuck up and drop it if you don't like it faggot. no one is holding a gun to your head and making you watch it. don't be a bitch.</br>  <br>Because I don't laugh when you put dick and vagina in a sentence? God, it must be sad watching the same shit for 12 episodes and pretending joke is funny after 100'th time.</br>  <br> not having a hearty laugh while fapping <br>2sad4me</br></br>  <br>Oh wow you've changed my mind you so nailed down what it's all about just dick and vagina jokes......oh wait IT FUCKING isn't. I don't think you've watched it at all. Why don't you go fucking work for a shit site like ANN you sound like one of those pretentious "highbrow" twats.</br>  It's a bit early to tell, but with all the shitposting going on in these threads, this show is looking a strong contender for AOTS  Actually what makes me laugh is the behaviour of chertain character rather than the sex jokes themselves  <br>Fapping to what? Literally everything is censored.</br>  <br><br>Spewing curse words unnecessarily just like the anime, funny man. Besides I'm still interested in some scenes I've seen in LN and manga screen captures. I also hear there's drama from one poster but it may be just a rumor. I don't see this kind of series getting serious though.<br><br><br>Disagreeing =! shitposting. OP asked that to /a/ as collective if they agreed which means fans of the series and not. This isn't a circlejerk thread is it?<br><br><br>Laugh while fapping to someone yelling expletives? I don't find this sexually appealing but whatever floats your boat, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's basically all it has to offer when it comes to shit that hasn't been done may times in bad comedies, so yeah, it's all about terrible sex jokes. Besides, why do you sound so offended? Is Ayame you new waifu or something?</br>  This show reeks of your typical "liberal" idiocy of "either you have to be an ultra-conservative prude who keeps children laughably sexually oblivious because you think sexuality is dirty, or you have your culture revel in all kinds of perversions and pornography which also do jack shit to challenge the status quo of seeing sexuality as something dirty."<br><br>The anime's title claims that it plays in a world where dirty jokes don't exist. Clearly they do exist, because people register them, except for ignorant children (just like in our current real-life culture, except the age of ignorance is raised).<br><br>A world where dirty jokes actually don't exist would be a world where people don't associate sexuality with perversion in first place. The whole concept of a dirty joke is based on the premise that sexuality is dirty, and hence a joke referencing sexuality is a dirty joke. This is the very same backwards, conservative mindset against sexuality, with the sole difference that now it's not banned but paradoxically celebrated despite still being exercised in perverted (dirty) ways.<br><br>Ask yourself why real-life women and especially young women and girls tend to be less inclined to partake in sexual discussions and dirty jokes. It's because in our current conception of dirty sexuality, the dirtiness serves as a way of demeaning the female side in sexuality. Either a formerly "pure" woman is dirtied, or an already dirty slut's dirtiness is enjoyed. In either case the female side's dignity is sold off for the male side's pleasure.<br><br>Which is why it's also bullshit that the girls in this show would naturally/instinctively find the pictures they're shown to be attractive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Spewing curse words unnecessarily just like the anime <br>How much of a faggot can you be<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for proving my point even further. I'll leave you with this out of fear I may be responding to bait at this point, funny man.</br></br>  <br>This  post honestly sounds like it was written by an underage faggot trying to sound cool by using excessive insults, so get fucked.</br>  <br><br>which was the point I made and why his obvious posts aren't worth responding to anymore.</br></br>  <br>Why would you give a shit about that faggot, more so since it types like hes a MALtard. In-fact, why are you even giving the fuckwit the attention he wants? The anon I was replying to is a obvious crossborder, and should fuck off</br>  <br> hes <br> In-fact <br> no period <br>Let's calm down first.</br></br></br></br>  Op here. I just have to say I am severely disappointed about all this senseless drama and the even more alarming lack of lewd screen caps.  DUDE SEX LMAO<br>Yeah, comedy gold right here</br>   still no Hiryuu   <br>Yes you're right. <br><br>The correct answer is Chaos Dragon. It's shitty it's hilarious</br></br></br>    <br> those crotch shot scenes. <br>the ugly sleep deprived bags under her eyes<br>Why is this so fucking hot?</br></br></br>  <br> The sex jokes are something I would hear a grade school spew out. <br><br>You do realize that's exactly the point right? Or you're too much of a retarded faggot to notice?<br> That time comedy LN was 2deep4u </br></br></br></br>  <br>I would really love to satisfy her curiosity</br>  <br> You do realize that's exactly the point right <br>How does it change anything he said?<br>It's still boring cringe garbage</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128382566 <br>Oh hello, worst tripfag. It's no surprise that your taste a shit as always</br>  <br>Too bad you're the one with shit taste here this time</br>  <br>Yeah yeah your favorite anime is shit I know, I know</br>  <br>Yes!<br>Thanks our based god that gave Charlotte to people with wicked and mature sense of humor like us!</br></br>  <br>what a bitch.</br>  <br> strawmanning this hard </br>  <br>What does Chatlotte have to do with this?<br>You're getting desperate at defending this shit</br></br>  <br> &gt;o noes my poor bitch faggot eyes are hurt by the naughty words </br>   discuss pic related   <br>A guy like him wasnt going to last in the Marines for long.<br>But I bet he´s gonna keep his rank for raisins.</br></br>  <br><br>They cant fire him just like that. He will get some sanctions but they wont kick him out</br></br>  <br>Is there a chapter this week, or is everything on break?</br>  <br>His ultimatum is either get fired and take his entire marine regimen to become pirates/revolutionaries OR become Smoker 2.0. Either works for me</br>  <br>One Piece has no chapter this week. Not sure about the rest of JUMP.</br>  Dumping chapter 186.<br>Reminder that Usopp has a<br> meteor hammer <br>The only other character with a "meteor" named attack appear in this order<br>1. Meteor Hammer -  Usopp <br>2. Meteor Cannon - Garp<br>3. Meteor Volcano - Akainu <br>4. Meteor - Fujitora<br>They appear in the listed order.<br><br>On to chapter 186.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They look like a couple having a fight over the phone<br><br>Is Fuji the thoughtless, inattentive boyfriend?</br></br></br>   tfw waifuing Monet   Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!    <br>aw shit</br>    How come people are acting like Jinbe isn't already part of the crew? Luffy already invited him and Jinbe pretty much said he is joining when he meet Luffy again. <br><br>Unless something bad happen to Jinbe he is 100% bound to join the crew at some point.</br></br>  <br><br>Small price to pay for a Monet</br></br>  <br> Mr. JUSTICE getting BTFO <br>yes, more of this</br></br>      <br> Monet will never poop on your car </br>  <br> Unless something bad happen to Jinbe <br>Jinbe death confirmed</br></br>    <br> mfw </br>  Akainu and the 5 old farts are too far detached from reality, they don't even give a fuck when their own people are suffering under the sichibukai.  <br>Someone please appreciate Jean Bart, too. I don't even know why Law asked him to join.</br>  <br>Jinbe is too strong in water. He can command whales which is like a nerfed Poseidon and literally make knock up streams. If Akainu set sail in an armada Jinbe could beat him + his fleet solo. That is my only issue.<br/></br>    Does Zoro have autism    <br>No</br>  <br>yes<br>so does the rest of the crew except for robin and maybe Franky</br></br>      <br>Robin is probably the only member of the crew who is autistic since she can't express her emotions appropriately.</br>    <br>Wanna know how Akainu got his scars?</br>  I can't wait till Sakazuki dai enkais marijoa  <br>I don't remember<br>but it's probably by fighting aokiji</br></br>  <br> not how Fuji got his <br>Pleb<br/></br></br>    <br>Usopp Great Warrior of the Sea</br>  Issho-san a cute    <br>that's probably more to do with the lack of opportunity than an actual condition</br>  Is Aokiji Kuzan's brother  <br>How will the 7th warlord react after hearing about the system breaking up?</br>  <br> forgot cover page <br>Fin</br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> How will the 7th warlord react after hearing about the system breaking up? </br>  Everyone ready to see Kidd and his Pirate Alliance stomp Shanks and the rest of the Red-Haired Crew? I know I am!, Law and Luffy took out Doffy and are now going in for the kill on Kaido which means Kidd has equal game on Shank's head. <br><br>RIP 2 Yonkos, I wonder who's taking Big Mom's place though, I doubt she's even worth the effort, her fat ass will die before anyone can kill her.<br><br>I love Luffy's generation, WORST GENERATION FOR THE FUCKING WIN!</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who seriously think Derossa was HALF as good as Alabasta  <br><br> There will also be retards who'll respond to this post by going "No, it's even better" <br><br>Marineford Babies are the worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Usopp Usopp don't die, find a doctor! <br>It scares me that this gag has recurred in multiple arcs</br></br>  What music do you think will play when Luffy uses King Kong gun in the anime?    What if the reason Zoro hasn't had a difficult fight yet post time-skip is because of pic related, when usopp says that it would take two years for zoro to recover from his wounds inflicted by mihawk, meaning that pre-timeskip, zoro was never fighting at full capacity but now that two years has gone by he is fully recovered from his fight with mihawk  <br>agreed</br>   Kidfag <br><br>suppose it was only a matter of time, really</br></br>  <br>No, it's even better</br>  <br>If they can get Bonney involved and have her turn Shanks into a kidd or Old man then it'll be interesting. <br>Any indication Kidd working for BB?</br></br>  <br>he's saying it would take 2 years for Zoro to even move <br><br>clearly Zoro isnt normal</br></br></br>    <br>Does it automatically mean that when a Yonkou is defeated, whoever defeats them becomes the new Yonkou? Because there's three pirates in Kid's alliance and I think they're supposed to be "equals". <br><br>I'm thinking the whole system will be fucked up. Fujitora is seeking to abolish the Shichibukai. The Supernovas are trying to screw up the Yonkou. I look at this as the three powers being almost if not totally demolished. Like how Law was talking about gears in Punk Hazard.</br></br></br>  <br>overtaken<br>or gomu gomu bazooka</br></br>  <br>Bonney seems oddly adoring of Luffy<br><br>I doubt she'd help Kidtachi</br></br></br>  <br>He who kills the Yonko and takes his territory becomes the new Yonko. So you have to take control of their land and kill them or just take their land and power thus you're the new Yonko.</br>  <br>I was thinking the actual 18th century symposium that played during the defeat of crocodile "into the new world"<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qkC<wbr>a90YLiag</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The main issue with Dressrosa, the main difference, is that Luffy did not grow. He was already strong enough to win, his crew was already stronger than Doffy too. In Alabasta each member had to become stronger, Nami learned to control weather, Zoro to cut steel, Sanji fought a tranny martial artist.<br>Dressrosa didn't have a real sense of fear for the straw hats but Alabasta did.<br><br>It is impossible to do Alabasta twice for that reason, that is why Dressrosa is underwhelming. <br><br>Also the DF Awakening was underwhelming compared to the Alabasta reveal of DF imbued objects.<br><br>Also the way Oda set up Luffy learning Crocodile weakness to water was 10/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou.<br><br>I figure if there isn't immediately a replacement like Blackbeard to take Whitebeard, then the remaining yonkou just sort of take over the turf of the fallen one.<br>You'd generally think there's a replacement, but it's not like this system has been in place for very long. None of them had died before Whitebeard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know? Now that I think about it Luffy had trained the ENTIRE time on an island full of all sorts of beasts. <br>And guess what? He'll be facing off against Kaidou who will likely be all sorts of beasts. Bravo oda.</br></br>  <br>Is this your assumption or was this stated anywhere in the manga? This is an honest question, not meant to insult or anything.</br>  <br> Law brought Luffy to the island so he knows this too. <br>Bravo anon</br></br>  <br>Not him but it is shown rather than stated.<br>Blackbeard killed Whitebeard and now he's a Yonko.</br></br>  <br>goddamn croc was a weak shit during alabasta, losing to pre gear 2nd luffy. how the hell did he fight people like doffy, akainu, mihawk, jozu during marineford?? alabasta luffy who is supposedly&gt;crocodile could not do that.</br>  <br>because he was underestimating Luffy the entire time<br><br>He let Luffy chip damage him to zero</br></br></br>  <br>As I understood it, it was more like Whitebeard died and Blackbeard knew a lot about the seas and WB's territory because he was a former crewmate so he had an edge on the others entering the New World. <br><br>So you still have to take territories after defeating a Yonkou, yes? It just doesn't get passed on to you. Fishman Island was under Big Mom's protection when it was previously WB's.<br><br><br> I think that the yonkou thing doesn't specifically require four people. It's just called the yonkou because there are four. I don't see why there has to be some arbitrary number of them. They could easily just be the sankou or the gokou. <br><br>Good point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What would happen if Blackbeard grabbed Luffy while he was in gear 3? Would losing his rubberness with all the air in him cause his limb to explode? Would he be able to hold it together with haki?  <br>Luffy used haki unconsciously to win the final exchange, since he punched through Crocodiles cutting attack which sliced solid rock the previous time it was shown.<br>Same shit happened vs Arlong.<br><br>The Straw Hat helped Luffy win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>do you actually believe this?</br>  <br>Because Crocodile second in command Mrs Allsunday was a traitor</br>    <br>Power creep. <br>Don't think too much of it, it happens to every shounen over time.</br></br>    <br>Forgotpic</br>  http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>20/working-with-eiichiro-oda-an-int<wbr>erview-with-one-piece-editor-suguru<wbr>-sugita/<br><br> Well, now that we’re in the second half of the story, I think there will be more and more chapters that revolve around the main plot. The Four Emperors will also appear more in the story, so I think you’ll really enjoy what happens next! </br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  I'm pretty hype if Fujitora tries to follow his commands. Having both a Warlord and Admiral defeated would be some real shit assuming Luffy and Law can fight the following morning.  <br>Two knocked out novas versus a full health admiral. Yep, def gonna happen.</br>  <br>Fuji is just New World Aokiji<br><br>he'll follow them around lazily but otherwise isnt doing shit</br></br></br>  <br>its stated by territory, right after the war when the gorosei are talking i think. BB was in WBs crew for a long time and knew where all thin freshly unclaimed land would be and had crew that could solo cap an island each so it just happened to go to him</br>  <br>I am saddened when I see these threads and I have no recollection of reading some of these pages ;_;<br><br>Perhaps it's my due time for a re-read</br></br></br>  <br> 30% of the story left <br><br>w-what?? theres still so many unresovled things, I don't want it to end too soon :(</br></br></br>  <br>You can't remember a page from two weeks ago.</br>  <br>that page was literally 2 weeks ago chapter, are you sure you arent a speed reader with alzheimers?</br>  <br>30% ends at chapter 1100 or so.<br><br>It's as far from now as the start of the series from Luffy fighting Lucci.</br></br></br>  <br> the following morning. <br>I think this information alone allows us to deduce Fuji is letting them go.<br>If he wanted them he'd have the marines pick them off the ground as soon as the doffy fight was done.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda or one of his editors said OP was half way done back during the end of Skypeia. I'd take it with a grain of salt.<br><br>I'm just glad the Yonko are going to play a more active role now.</br></br></br>  <br>He is NOT going to come after Luffy/Law. He's saying he's fine with not coming back to Marine HQ.<br><br><br>Because Oda can't break muh monster trio, he's too strong and there are too many crewmembers wah wah wah.<br><br>Same shit you see in these threads all the time. They don't read the series, though so they couldn't know half the shit they spew.<br><br><br>Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one.<br><br><br>Neat. But to be around 70% of the story? Hmm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How come people are acting like Vivi isn't already part of the crew. <br>Jinbe could have joined and then went on a solo mission, instead he said "he, ill join later." which is a deathflag or at minimum "some shit will block him from joining" flag.</br></br>  <br>he's going to have some Big Mom conflict but he'll still join. <br><br>He and Luffy are blood-brothers afterall</br></br></br>  <br> brothers <br>Another proof he won't join/will die</br></br>  <br>How much do you think there's left of Berserk?</br>  <br><br><br>Oh shieet I somehow missed last week's WSJ release. Well another example is Kuzan/Aokiji's appearance post-timeskip</br></br></br>  <br> Nearly $25million a year <br><br>Holy crap</br></br></br>  <br>Caribou will tell<br> that man <br>That Shirahoshi is Poseidon.<br>That's where Jinbe, strongest fish man in the world (deathflag), will get blocked from ever joining.</br></br></br></br>  Would I be right in saying his reintroduction was ambiguous?<br><br>Capone working for Mam is a boring to me since we already have the yonkou underling dynamic with Drake/Kaidou.<br>I'd much prefer Capone to be striking out alone.<br><br>Why would he be after Ceasar though?<br>Ceasar probably has wares that can be traded on the black market.<br>I think it would be interesting to see Capone make a play for becoming the top Broker...might also suit his namesake since it's a black market vibe.<br>Does this sound like headcannon or a reasonable theory? I can never tell when it's my own.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>no idea, miura does what he wants. I just hope the announcement about monthly releases holds up, and we actually do get monthly chapters.</br>  <br>He was on Big Mom's fucking ship.</br>  <br>Sabo seems to be doing just fine though</br>  <br>law said to survive in the new world you either take out a yonko or join a yonko, and no supernova can take them out alone, so I think its fine if he's working for big mom, just makes him a less important character compared to say captain kid. drake is ambiguous, he might join luffy/law</br>  <br>Sabo has more deathflags than any other character in One Piece.<br><br>He even did and said the exact same things Ace did before he died almost word for word, and Zoro explicitly commented on this.</br></br></br>  <br>What if Caribou tells Kizaru?<br>Think about it, Kizaru killed the sun pirates. Kizaru is Proven 100% loyal to tenryubito, and the tenryubito are actively trying to acquire the ancient weapons as Proven at water 7<br>Jinbe vs Kizaru means no Jinbe cremate</br></br></br>  <br> He was on <br>near, He was NEAR Big Mom's ship</br></br>  <br><br>Which translation is this.<br>Seems decent.</br></br></br>  <br>that's assuming they actually parallel 100%<br><br>I doubt they do. It'd make no sense to replace Ace only to kill him off as well</br></br></br>  <br>He was on big mom's ship.

All the CP9 agents were close friends with their assassination target.<br><br>you are falsely telling me what I am arguing.

I'm not sure if you legitimately think you're saying something different, but that's what you're fucking typing dude.</br></br></br>  <br> just stating that she fits the mold in the same way CP9 did <br><br>you can replace Koala with literally any other name and nothing would change</br></br></br>  <br> an infiltrator in Dragons army wouldn't need a good back story. <br><br> koalatellingsaboitsgoodhedidntsave<wbr>ace.Png </wbr> <br>Anyway my argument is that Sabo has death flags, good derail by focusing on koala who I mentioned as hypothetical example.</br></br></br></br>  <br> who I mentioned as hypothetical example. <br><br>that's your own fault though. Your theory holds no water either way</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu Gomu no Autism!</br>  <br>No my logic explicitly excludes them because they are not close with Sabo in any way, having met him less than 24 hours ago in canon, whereas my logic requires they were close to Sabo for years and years like how kaku and friends stayed with iceberg for like a decade.</br>  <br>My god<br><br>Luffy is a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br>Its completely feasible as it mirrors CP9 being long time friends and subordinates of their assassination target.<br>You are arguing that it is unfeasible even though it was the water 7 saga</br></br>  <br>Except we know he is not.<br>You are either just being antagonistic or very dumb.<br>Luffy hasn't talked to Sabo before today in story since he was like 6 years old, so it violates the logic, as well.</br></br></br>  watch this retard be right, and koala turns out to be a cp0 agent.<br><br>post YFW</br></br>  <br> Except we know he is not. <br><br>That's why it's proof, because it was surprising when the CP9 agents were revealed, and it would be surprising if Luffy was revealed as a CP0 agent.</br></br></br>  <br> mirrors <br>prove that it's a mirror or even happening right now?<br><br>you have no clue IF CP0 is after Sabo in particular or someone we havent even seen yet<br><br>you're just assumin because they're in the general area that they must be linked when Dressrosa introduced something like 30 characters</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why Sabo? The CP0 were said to have been mobilized to take out Doffy. Shouldn't they be close to him then?<br>Plus, why do you think Oda will follow the same approach to CP0 as he did with CP9. Such blatant repetition just isn't his style. There's a better chance CP0 will be handled nothing like the 9 so all conjectures based on it are potentially a waste.</br></br>  <br> That's why it's proof, because it was surprising </br>  <br><br>She won't be she's the girl fisher tiger rescued. She'd never work for the CDs</br></br>  <br> being the is much of a troll <br>I just feel bad for you at this point.<br>The only CP9 agent who wasn't working for iceberg and also his good friend of many years was Spandam.</br></br></br>  <br>Its not proof, it is well reasoned speculation based on the known modes operandi of another in canon branch of the WG.<br>It could easily be wrong, but it is not "wild speculation," which was the initial criticism.</br></br>  <br>And Jyabura. And Fukuro. And Kumadori.<br><br>Does Nero count too, even though nobody remembers him?</br></br></br>  <br> CP0 is Koala and Hack <br> CP0 is all of Dragon's subordinates <br> Dragon is the CP0 boss <br> they're all conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary </br></br></br></br>  <br> Marinefordbabbies like Dressrosa? That's a new one. <br><br>Marfineford and Dressrosa were both just giant arcs about a bunch of new characters fighting each other with minimal character development for the Straw Hats. It makes sense they'd like Dressrosa.</br></br></br>   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=UK<wbr>8-wh-oLp4</wbr>  [ ] <br> tfw Roci's voice is manlier than Doffy's </br>  <br>So some agents weren't, this doesn't affect the veracity of my speculation though because the means of assassination primarily relied on the members who were friends with Iceberg.<br><br>It is a reasonable speculation I'm not sure why you are so aggressively attacking it with fallacy.</br></br></br>  <br> well reasoned <br><br>You seriously call something with no evidence whatsoever 'well-reasoned'.<br><br>Literally the only support for your argument is that it would resemble what happened in Water7. For fuck's sake, you don't even have any evidence that there's more than the three agents we already saw in CP0, that they've infiltrated the revolutionaries (who nobody knew was on the island), that Koala is one of them, why Koala would have stayed behind if she was one of them when they were explicitly stated in the last chapter to have completely left the island, etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it is well reasoned speculation <br> Koala might be CP0 <br> because she works with Sabo <br> who the CP0 were obviously around to apprehend <br> because of COURSE Sabo is being doublecrossed <br> because he's deathflagged <br> because he's Luffy's brother </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did I state that ALL of galley la were infiltrators?</br>  <br>Because it's not reasonable, it's insane. You have no proof, nothing other than 'parallels', without even any evidence to suggest that the series is following parallels, that the parallels apply in this instance, why they specifically apply to Koala instead of, say, Hack, or anything at all. There's absolutely nothing supporting a single thing you're saying, and the fact that you don't seem to grasp this. The fact that you repeatedly and consistently are getting details of the story wrong is also not helping.</br>  <br>There is substantial evidence that Oda heavily mirrored Alabasta in Dressrosa, though. And he set up a spy agency involvement for the next saga and also revealed Sabo as the #2 rev, had Sabo say the same shit as ace when he left Alabasta as well</br>  <br>my bad<br><br> CP0 is MOST of Dragon's subordinates(not all because then it wouldn't be a perfect mirror!) <br><br> they're MOSTLY conspiring against Sabo for working with Dragon's persona as a revolutionary(not all of them. Bunny Joe is cool) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora for next Strawhat</br>  <br> a correlation exists <br> therefore, a trend exists and will continue <br><br>You realize Ace was killed by Blackbeard and the Marine, right? And that CP9 had nothing to do with this? So by the 'muh parallels' logic CP0 should also have nothing to do with Sabo?</br></br></br></br>    <br>You keep putting words in my mouth.<br>I did not clack Dressrosa was a perfect mirror of Alabasta.<br>I did not claim that most of the revolutionary army are spies for WG.<br>I did not claim that "most" of São's underlings will betray him.<br><br>Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You keep putting words in my mouth. <br>YOU asked me to elaborate<br><br> Sabo departure was a rather perfect mirror though, stating what Ace did verbatim. <br><br>has nothing to do with CP0. Not a thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop replying to bait holy shit</br>  <br>You are still relying on straw man after straw man. You realize that Laffite was in talks with WG shown on panel at the shichibukai meeting before Ace was killed and that Teach was Ace's crew mate for years and years before he back stabbed his friend Thatch, right?</br>  <br>then fucking talk to me asshole i'm bored</br>  <br>how's the wife?</br>  <br>There's literally a watermark anon.</br>  <br><br>Was Fujitora always blind from birth or did he get blinded in both eyes by the [swordsman?] who gave him that scar?</br></br>  <br>It's likely we'll learn of Fujitoras past in Wano.</br>  <br>Seems stupid for Ceasar to be valuable in the black market.<br><br>All he has is his bounty or whatever Big Mom's willing to pay. Not everyone can give him an island and the chemicals for Cesar to make SMILES for them. Unless Oda really wants Big Mom and Kaido to fight, Ceasar is not that important and I don't believe Capone has any interest in him besides obeying someone else's orders.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you forget that he built a nuke BEFORE he had smiles or any real supplies? Dude is still the second smartest character introduced after vegapunk, even without a lab. Plus Big Mom and Kaido seem like the two people most likely to be able to actually give him the stuff he needs. Which isn't to say that Capone isn't working for Big Mom, he probably is.</br>  Was Doffy Tsuru's boytoy?  <br>Have they ever met or interacted at any point in the story?</br>  <br>I want speedreaders to leave</br>  <br>Wait, I forgot, they met once right after Croc was deposed.<br><br>Still a weird as shit pairing</br></br></br>  <br> animefags </br>    <br>She also pursued his crew during Law's flashback. Do you even read, anon?</br>  <br>Still not entirely correct, stop being a speedreader.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ, look at these panel layouts and posing. I completely forgot how awesome these were. What happened? All of New World feels so flat and simple compared to this...</br>  <br>This. That water weakness reveal. Such an epic fight. Such a page turner. AAAAHHH.</br>  <br>I forgot about that too, although in fairness to me they never were actually shown interacting.</br>  <br>I disagree, I'd say his crew treats him way more as a captain this arc. They always asked his permission to do things. Franky with the dwarves, Sanji with Big Mom.<br><br>Stop being a powerlevel fag that thinks character development = fighting skill.<br><br>The only true disappointing fight was Diamante, and maybe Burgess. Even Picas actions were on par with his character because in the chapter we learned about his voice, Doffy told him the battle would decide who would be king, that's why he targeted King Riki and challenged his ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is tsuru his aunt?</br>  Who else should i add to this?  Vizanon is MIA  <br> Kuma <br> Croc <br> abandoned <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>Kuma will never be explained.</br>  Does anyone else feel like Kaido is a good guy? Or at least a fallen good guy like one of those Raoh/Toguro scenarios?<br><br>I think him, Rogers, and Raleigh are like Sanji, Zoro, and Luffy. They've already shown Shanks can look like a devil to other pirates that don't know him.</br></br>  <br> Oda is still getting only 2-3 hours of sleep per night. <br>Oda goddammit, stop it. Wasn't the entire point of his last hiatus so he could get out of that habit?</br></br>  <br> kuma <br> crocodile <br> roger <br>roger is dead and still we get the flashbacks of him from rayleigh <br>croco has been shown a lot throughout the series and he is still a prominent character<br>kuma is the same</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about him needs an explanation?</br>  <br>You are kidding, right?</br>  <br>What's the Sanji abandoned plotline? <br><br>And how is Morgan still relevant? <br><br>Also what's abandoned about Kuma and Croc?<br><br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Surely all high tier pirates are devils to their enemies.</br>  <br>For being the wise man he is it surprises me that he's previously so unable to see the pure goodness in Luffy, despite his being a pirate.</br>  <br>Alvida.</br>  <br>The guy with speed and claws from ussop island</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>Is with Buggy</br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I get the feeling that all the yonko are chill and only have skirmishes for appearances <br><br>Hell Big Mom is probably really reasonable besides the people eating thing. Kaido may just be a big friendly gorilla who happens to like fisticuffs</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's because he's too strong in the water that he's waiting so long to let him join. If he just let someone as strong as Luffy join off the bat it'd break his Luffy fighting the main villian every arc since Jinbe could crush them.<br><br>As for Akainu I agree, him and Kinnemon are probably the only ones who could beat Akainu with their skills, Kinnemon being with firesealing. (Unless they say fuck it and just like Zoro damage him with Haki like they did with Marco)</br></br></br>  <br> And I don't even recognize the redhat mustache man or purple hair guy. <br> the first time we see what the grand line is all about is not worth remembering <br> the first time zoro shows his devotion to luffy is not worth remembering  <br> fucking roger is not worth remembering </br></br></br></br>  <br>Morgan not being relevant is the point.<br>Kuma's whole deal with the marines is never explained, along with his entire backstory.<br>I added crocodile as a bonus hilarious joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Kumas backstory will come during the revolutionary arc or the Vegapunk arc, be patient anon</br>  <br>To be honest, I kind of feel like Fujitora is going to join. If not now than later.<br><br>I only say that because if Aokij joined blackbeard, it's only fair that the rivaling crews both get an ex marine. <br><br>(I'm still hoping Hajrudin is next strawhat)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What we know:<br>Kuma is a warrior priest for the revolutionary army.<br>Kuma apparently made a trade accepting brain death and use as a WG Weapon as the cost.<br>Dragon allowed this.<br>Anon it just doesn't make sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haki was an asspull later in the series and you know it. He just kind of said "Okay, the seamonster Shanks intimidated and the listening ability on Sky Island is part of this new system I'm introducing. Everyone accept it because it was there all along"</br>  <br><br>It was obvious that something like haki had to exist. There's no way you can let logias run around unchecked like that and have people like shanks be remarkable without some type of ability.</br></br>  <br>It's ok because Oda is the king of asspulls.<br><br>Eg: This guys was invented to explain how the door higuma kicks off in the 1st chapter is repaired a few pages later. He is a carpenter who cannot let any building go unrepaired.</br></br></br>    Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world. The first is Benn Beckman. Kuro will return.    <br>That's Roger? I never watched the Anime. He looks nothing like he does in the manga.<br><br>Who is the purple haired faggot though? I want to say Don Krieg but I pictured him differently as well. Plus there's no reason for him to be relevant either.</br></br></br>  <br>CP0<br>Big Mom<br>Bartolomeo's BIG SUITCASE <br>Sabo<br>Koal's it'd be dangerous to luffy</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't tell Kuma that they'd be replacing his brain, he joined the shichibukai as a spy, agreed to become a weapon for reasons that aren't explicitly stated but easily guessable (get stronger/get more info, etc), and then had the deal altered to destroy his brain when he couldn't disobey</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4983818/<br>Which saga is the best?</br>  <br>What if he's a member of CP 1-8</br>  <br> my master plan <br> pretend to be a butler for years <br> to have a chance at some small town hick girl's money <br> instead of just killing her, forging a few documents and taking the money </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I figured as much. But it still seems lazy to introduce it so much later in the series.<br><br>Maybe he could have done a system where the fruit users had to take eachother out or something where they have to figure out clever ways to hurt the Logia like Luffy did with Crocodile.<br><br>Frankie beams Blackbeard and GG. Jinbei waterlogs Akainu. Kizamuro is beaten by mirrors or something. Fuck if I know. I didn't think it'd just turn to Dragonballz where strongest wins instead of figure out how to beat the opponents.<br><br>Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that intelligence list was created during east blue when there were like 30 characters. Vegapunk is likely the smartest man in the world. And Benn Beckman is more "wise" than "smart."</br>  <br> if they used bullshit made up on the spot and never mentioned again to win fights it would be jjjba <br><br>I'm sure you meant to say that.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they only wear the mask when they can be recognized by their target. They wore masks on Dressrosa, but Doffy talked to the leader after Marineford and he was unmasked, proving this.</br>  <br> Though I guess if they used cleverness and their powers to beat eachother, it'd just be Jojo's bizarre adventure. <br><br>You whine about asspulls, yet use Jojo as a comparison?</br></br></br>  <br>kuro Is the name</br>  <br>We don't have any clue if the guy Doffy talked to was related to CP0. They wore similar hats and that's about it.</br>  <br>Oda was an assistant on Kenshin so you'd have to be retarded to believe he didn't plan haki all along and foreshadow and even use it under varying names before he revealed it to the protagonist.</br>  <br>best movie right here</br>  <br> Haki was an asspull </br>  <br><br>Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better.</br></br>  <br> abondened plot <br> One Piece </br></br>  <br>Gears after 2 and Haki weren't introduced on the spot, and the author actually remembers that they exist and how they work, so yes, it's way better than JJBA. Awakening is too early to tell, but if it's never mentioned again then it will be tied with JJBA, which does the same goddamn thing more than once.</br>  <br>the explain the florian triangle monsters</br>  <br>According to a letter send from Miura to SK forums, we are at the 70% of the story.</br>  <br>Dressrosa was more about the plight and danger of the country itself, I feel.</br>  <br>this was a plot? when?</br>  <br>Ok. Please adopt a trip.<br>Doflamingo commanded Pacifista when he attempted to assassinate Moira for someone "higher up" than Sengoku.<br>Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed.<br>Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command.<br> Doffy carrying out assassination of Shichibukai for WG. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Awakening has already been mentioned a few times. Chopper awakened his fruit every time he goes monster mode.</br>  <br>since it was now</br>  <br>just drawn to make the background look eery</br>  <br> don't hear of haki until 500+ chapters in <br> everyone and there dog has it now <br> expects us to believe people like Shanks, Crocodile, Ace, Arlong, Buggy, any of the CP9, Garp, anyone in Alabasta, any of the marines like smoker, anyone on Sky Island despite already having Mantra, or anyone else for that matter used Haki other than possibly Shanks and the listening haki on Sky Island despite alot of them being in legendary groups like Roger's crew, Fisher Tiger's crew, white beard's crew <br><br>You're a fucking retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nothing is ever abandoned in OP, even the gaimon and sarfunkel gag took 600 chapters to be revealed</br>  <br>Introducing a huge threat and mystery and then ignoring it is abandoning a potential plot line.</br>  <br>That's nowhere near enough to say that they're the same person, because, again, the only connection between the two is 'similar hat'.</br>  Reminder that this is the reason why Doflamingo is deathly afraid of Tsuru.  <br>it was not an asspull simply because it was already introduced in Skypia</br>  <br> Because introducing gears and haki and awakening on the spot to make up for the fact Oda way overpowered something like Logia users is much better. <br><br>That you're stupidly comparing haki to DBZ is retarded enough, but you're compounding your stupidity by using the 'Jojo card' while assuming that OP and Jojo fanbases are so far removed, that someone wouldn't notice this, it does nothing but make you look like a complete faggot. <br><br>If you just want to man up now and admit that you were spouting bullshit and bating to cover up for the fact you didn't know what the fuck you're talking about, feel free to.<br><br>That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit). As for Awakenings, they were introduced during Impel Down, only with Doffy finally showing what a non-Zoan version looks like. As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then met hat guy who demanded to know why he failed. <br> Then on Dressrosa it is hat guy with a mask and CP0 has tricked Akainu at Doffy command. <br><br>If anything, this seems to indicate they're different people, because the first guy wants to know why Doffy didn't follow orders, while the second guy is following Doffy's orders.</br></br></br></br>  <br>potential means it never was a real plot line</br>  <br>It is if no one has it or knows it by name and now everyone has it and knows it by name including previous characters who didn't even reference or use it. If Shanks knocked out the bandits, then it wouldn't be an asspull.</br>  <br>Alabasta had a war between its own citizens orchestrated by Baroque Works.<br><br>The civil war occurred before Luffy defeated Crocodile. Don't you remember Vivi almost averted it but infiltrators in her royal army shot Koza?<br><br>It was much more dramatic and realistic than the birdcage and the fighting continued for a little even after Luffy made it rain by KOing Crocodile. Vivi screamed and screamed finally ending it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BB referred to haki by name in Jaya. He even said that he was surprised how small Luffy's bounty was when his haki was so powerful.</br>  <br>I was comparing the fact that they made people go from shit like Rubber man, Chopchop man, Slipman, etc as the main fighting style to WHO IS THE STRONGEST to dragonballz. You can't say it isn't. It's no different than when Yuyu hakashu got rid of psychic style fighting to just see who has the strongest powerlevels.</br>  <br>Morgan is done, he showed up in Coby's story and again in Django's. There's no reasonable way for him to be relevant again<br><br>Only character's Oda has ditched are Kuro and his cat underlings, all the Krieg pirates, Chessmarimo and Enel's priests. You could include Foxy but he's exactly the kind of gag villain Oda loves and I'm sure he'll find a way back. Everyone else has gotten some kind of callback or reference.</br></br></br>  <br> That said, Luffy's Gears were fleshed out enough that by the time Gear 4 was introduced it feels like a natural progression from what came from Luffy's imaginative way of using what's available to him (especially considering his devil fruit).

As a whole, it's not enough has been shown to fairly judge Oda's usage of 'Awakening', so calling it an asspull, at this point, is fucking stupid. <br><br>This.<br><br>Even Luffy 'solution' to G4's weakness of just pumping Gear 3rd into it screams like some shit Luffy would do, which what makes it fucking hilarious this is what finished Doffy off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously, but she's quite old so she's not likely to be a threat other than her fruit.</br>  <br>Is Nen an asspull because Kite didn't use it in chapter 1 to save Gon?</br>  <br>Jokes are boring if retold. Foxy won't come back</br>  <br>You realize that Gear 4 just turns Luffy into a giant rubber ball, right? How is that not rubberman powers?</br>  <br>Yea the thing is you are wrong they are "both" directly tied to Doffy and work in a high up WG position.<br>Which means it is pretty likely the same person in a canon where non navy hats are mostly unique and the main character literally is called by the hat he wears.</br></br>  <br>He used haki as "willpower" there. He was referring to Luffy just taking a beating from Bellamy and still believing in Skypeia.</br>  <br> she's not a threat if you take out what's threatening about her <br>are you okay anon</br></br>  <br>Because Zoro can ships and mountains in half.</br>  <br>Mihawk did that in chapter 40something</br>  <br>It is, but for other reasons.<br>I still somehow like it.</br></br>  <br>Not him but he also referred to it in Impel Down</br>  <br> it's an asspull if you disregard all the things that doesn't make it an asspull !!!!!!! </br>  <br>I figured the second mate of Krieg that Sanji fought would eventually make a name for himself and fight Sanji like they promised ;_;</br>  <br>That's the reason it got lost in translations, but the word "haki" IS used.</br>  <br> You can't say it isn't. <br>It isn't. It is still completely possible that a fruit user can beat a strong haki user. See Law vs Vergo. Luffy vs Doffy also was not decided by who had the strongest haki or anything like that. There are no powerlevels in One Piece, period.</br></br>  <br><br> asspull <br> introduced in the very first chapter <br><br>Yeah... about that....</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence why I said 500 plus chapters</br>  <br>nottothisoshittoagain.jpg</br>  <br>It was first explicitly mentioned and used when Shanks knocked everybody out on WB's crew in 434.</br>  <br><br>Seems pretty obvious to me that they're the same. Doffy "followed" orders, but he also didn't give a shit about the repercussions of not completing them or talking back. They followed his orders on Dressrosa because he's blackmailing them<br><br>Not to jump on you two in particular but I really hate this small subset of fans who refuse to believe anything until its stated literally in the manga. Sabo was alive, Kuzan was with Blackbeard, this guy is CP0, Capone is by all the evidence we have on Big Mom's ship. Why ignore the information given because "it might not be"?</br></br></br></br>  <br> See Law vs Vergo. <br><br>Law used haki to defeat Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm saying it's not proven to be true.</br>  <br>I'm sure if they introduce Stands next chapter, then within 50 chapters everyone has them and Oda tries to say he already did stands at one point and it's what makes Sanji's legs hot, you'd try to justify it as not an asspull.</br>  <br><br>We already know what makes Sanji's legs hot, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he get poisoned saving Sanji's life?<br><br>Plus I just don't see Krieg attempting to go through the Grand line after getting his ass kicked by Mihawk twice, then by Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Oda can find a way to make it internally consistent and not contradict anything in the story, then it's not an asspull. Do you think an asspull just means 'a new power is introduced'?</br>  <br>Okay. 434 chapters is when it actually comes into existence which is still a long fucking time and an asspull. My bad. It wasn't really explained until Shabondy though around 500 chapters in.</br>  <br> Lucky Roo fast steps so fast in the panels it is like he fucking teleported when he shoots bandit. <br>For years people speculate Roo as fastest in the world.<br>The first Haki shown was CoO, it is how Shanks found Luffy.<br>The second is CoC, when Shanks glares at a sea monster and it runs away. You should swim in central CA pacific and give a great white shark a "intimidating stare" if you think that was not haki.</br></br></br></br>  The fact Luffy mentioned that Garp could hurt him even though he's rubber multiple times was an indicator of CoA haki early on.  <br><br>No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it.</br></br>  <br>Just because something isn't explicitly introduced in chapter 1 doesn't make it an asspull. All haki does is take a bunch of pre-existing powers that weren't explained and give them one. That's not an asspull, it's not even a retcon,</br>  <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and purposefully hides his frontside <br> 120 chapters later <br> Oda draws a mysterious high ranking government official with a distinctive hat and shows his frontside <br> its somehow not the same guy <br>I appreciate a skeptic but c'mon. Unless there's another leading Cipher Pol agent with an identical hat its the same person</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard uses the phrase Haki back in Jaya, he said he knew Luffy's Haki was too great for a 30 million bounty, it was just translated normally back then.</br>  <br>no, he just sliced him inside his room</br>  <br> and an asspull <br>holy shit just fuck off already</br></br>  <br>That was typical anime bullshit. HE'S SO STRONG HE STARED DOWN A SEAKING!<br><br>That's another point that he turned it into Dragonballz basically.<br><br>Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking. But he couldn't use any Haki to beat it, just let it take his arm, didn't attempt to kill it, etc. Yet somehow Luffy at the beginning of the series when he sets off punches it in the face and knocks it out. <br><br>One Piece wasn't supposed to just turn into a muscle flexing contest where everyone is superman tier. It was supposed to be about powers and shit then it diverged.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How could Luffy damage a spring man who is Springs instead of Blades like Mr. 1?  <br><br>It's actually the opposite. He was shocked that with his current level that he was even worth 30m, much less 100m. It was in the aftermath of him knocking out bellamy</br></br>  Smoker is pretty much done for as a rival figure. He is currently far away from Luffy and arriving at Vegapunk's in a few days, that translates to hundreds of chapters, next time he'll show up will probably be when our main characters meet Vegapunk. By then Luffy will be even more magnitudes stronger than Smoker, worse Smoker is still healing his wounds, so he can't even hope of training.  <br> chapter 1 <br><br>yeah, chapter 10 maybe. Maybe after Arlong Park that'd be cool?<br><br>But 434 chapters... Come on now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The justification is what makes it not an asspull. If something new was introduced WITHOUT any justification, then it would be an asspull. Do you not have any idea what the terms you use mean?<br><br>An asspull is something a character, y'know, pulls out of their ass to win a fight. That sure as fuck doesn't apply to haki.</br></br></br>  <br> Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking. <br><br>Maybe because he wasn't a Yonkou back then? Shit, a year in OP can get you an assload of power. Look at where Luffy has gotten in 2.</br></br></br>  <br> Blackbeard didn't chase/attack Luffy till he BTFO a man made of springs with a punch <br>He chased Luffy so fast too, considering Luffy sprinted all the way back and they immediately set sail but were still almost overtaken</br></br>  <br> No. "A new power that tons of people have and all the strongest use that nobody really talked about until a 434" is an asspull. Doesn't matter how he tries to justify it. <br><br>This from the guy who seriously try to defend throwing around the term 'asspull' by using Jojo's Bizarre Adventure as in a series 'where there are no unexplained powers' and 'everyone fights cleverly, not unlike DBZ'.<br><br>Since you're not going to apologize and own up to the your own faggotry, I'm going to disregard your statements (which have been repeatedly refuted easily) as shit-posting.<br><br>To that end, calling something you're too daft to understand an asspull, does not an asspull make.<br><br>It just means you have really shitty reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are talking toys an asspull because they weren't introduced until 702? Even if haki had never been used once before in the series and Oda didn't retcon other stuff into being haki, it still wouldn't be an asspull just because it was introduced a while in.</br>  <br>Super strength has been a part of every strong character's power set since forever, was there any powerful guy that didn't have super strength?<br>Crocodile and Enel probably come closest.</br></br>  <br> Somehow Shanks, one of the four Yonko lost his arm to a seaking <br><br>Stop being a powerlevel faggot. It was either stop the seaking or save Luffy, there was no time for both.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember reading somewhere that Oda didn't want Shanks to lose an arm, one of his editors made him do it. I guess it gets a pass since it was so early on and Oda had no idea OP would get so big.<br><br>"Oda had no intention that Shanks lost his arm, but after an editor told him that the story was not interesting enough, Oda decided to cut his arm off. ONE PIECE Grand Countdown 2 (2010)"</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he somehow had swordfights with Mihawk before he lost his arm?</br>  <br>What makes Sanji's leg hot is similar to Okama Kenpo and Bon Kurei's spinning kicks<br><br>The difference between 400 or so chapters of haki appearing hear and there and your example is that the former has appeared in the first 400 chapters here and there and your example comes from your dumbass. Cherry picking is for idiots, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Devil Fruits were introduced.</br>  <br>Before anyone speculates that Mihawk and Shanks weren't big deals back then, Whitebeard remarked that their duels were legendary, so Shanks most definitely was strong as hell before he met Luffy.</br>  <br><br>Yeah it does seem strange that a Yonkou would be just chilling out in the East Blue and no one would comment on it.</br></br>  <br>That was a good call.</br>  Holy shit and I thought all those underaged retards who keep misusing the word "asspull" only crawl out of their shitholes on chapter release days  <br>And yet somehow a seaking that Luffy one punched chapter one took his arm.<br><br>Don't give me that he didn't have time or he bet it on the new generation shit either, we know it's just a fuckup on Oda's part.</br></br></br>  <br> we know <br>no, fuck off</br></br>  <br>This came out in 2000, and this light novel contained material Oda cut from Loguetown so that he could enter the Grand Line at chapter 100, so Haki would have popped up around 100.<br>"If you've ever read the light novel adaptation upon which Oda collaborated on, there was a scene where a fortune-teller who reads people's faces reveals to Luffy that he has the 'Sign of King's Ambition'. Lit. 覇王の相. This is interesting because in Japanese fortune-telling there is the Sign of the Emperor 帝王の相　and the palm-reading 覇王の手相 most commonly known as the 覇王線 or 'Line of King's Ambition' is specifically meant for palm-reading. This means the term was probably created uniquely for this scene."<br>http://apforums.net/showthread.php?<wbr>t=27758&amp;page=256&amp;p=3139755#post3139<wbr>755</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>They are shitposters but newfags keep replying to them</br>  <br> using insults because you can't make a valid argument <br><br>kek.</br></br></br>  <br>He didn't have time and had to choose between letting Luffy get eaten or sacrifice his arm to save Luffy.</br>   people legitimately mad about the seaking <br>It was the first chapter of a story that's evolved greatly in the past 18 years. Its not a big deal<br><br><br>Imagine if Garp wanted to check on Luffy during the year Shanks was there. The fucking shitshow that would be</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ye. That's not relevant though. We all know Oda was just referencing pirate king.</br>  Did Mihawk have the title of strongest swordsman before Shanks lost his arm, because he refuses to fight him anymore. For all Mihawk knows, Shanks could beat him.  <br><br>Shanks is most likely the most recent addition to the Yonkou before the timeskip.</br></br>  <br>well the word "retard" best describes faggots like you who misuse buzzwords and do not know what their true meaning</br>  <br><br>Since Garp repeatedly "cornered" the Roger pirates... Doesn't that mean Shanks/Garp are likely to have fought in the past?<br><br>Still, it would be fucking hilarious to see two of the strongest fighters dicking about in the East blue.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No you idiot. Have you ever considered the possibility that Higuma was legitimately strong with a low bounty like Blackbeard and ambushed Shanks in a bar full of bystanders, women and children?<br>Then Shanks negotiated his way outside and owed everyone except Higuma who escaped?<br><br>Shanks lost his arm because saving Luffy took all his concentration and he therefore could not defend his own arm.<br><br>Kenshin Himura (a red head swordsman with a scar on his face) falls on his ass when he lands a blow on Seijuro Hiko for the same reason.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuro is alive with an active bounty and is the second smartest man in the world.  <br> The first is Benn Beckman. <br>First of all, you mean "the east blue", not the world. Second, that sbs was only in reference to the characters who'd been introduced up to that point.</br></br></br>  <br>He had plenty of time. Reread the first chapter. Luffy was about to get eaten and he pulled him back. He could have easily cut it's head off in the way that guy cut the giant snakes head off on Sky Island's flashback. Or if he was actually as strong as Mihawk he could have thrown a slash like Mihawk did.<br><br>Besides, if Haki really existed back then why didn't he just arnament his arm up? :3</br></br></br>  <br>Mihawk refuse to fight Shanks because he lost his good arm, however Oda has stated Shanks didn't lose any power at all, but it would probably leave Mihawk a bad taste since muh swordman code.</br>  <br>"Fought" a cabin boy on Roger's ship? Garp probably just focused on the big shots, Roger, Rayleigh, and Gaban.</br>  <br> Besides, if Haki really existed back then why didn't he just arnament his arm up? <br><br>Yeah, no one has ever bitten through armament before.</br></br></br>  <br>Lol. Just no. Reread chapter one. All of Higuma's got rekt instantly. Higuma got eaten by the seaking and Shanks pulled Luffy back instead of trying to deliver an attack.</br>  <br> :3 </br>    <br>Still, does that mean Mihawk's title is meaningless, nobody ever mentions who won their famous duels, and he won't fight a cripple.<br>How can he claim to be the best if he refuses to fight one of the strongest swordsmen alive?</br></br>  <br> How can he claim to be the best <br><br>When has Mihawk ever called himself the strongest? It's a title given to him. Doesn't mean it's true, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop reaching for Straws, you know there was no time.</br>  <br>Luffy had time to punch it out first chapter after it's mouth was already out<br><br>Hell, even Zoro moved faster than a fishman, which are said to be faster than seakings in water. Are you telling me that Zoro is faster than Shanks and Mihawk at Fishman Island?</br></br></br>  <br>Check out the Jolly Roger mate, it's not Big Mam's, though it's not his either.</br>  While we're rehashing old arguments<br><br> Can buggy be cut by haki <br> is zoro the first mate <br> is kreig stronger than Jozu <br> is sabo still alive </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's entirely possible given the time differences.</br></br>  <br>Why didn't shanks use observation haki?</br>  <br>Dude Odd literally wrote<br> Do not underestimate Shanks <br>On the page before he loses his arm, so you are full retard if you underestimate Shanks.<br>Also Higuma is not confirmed dead. And how far Shanks had to travel in the one second of time it would have taken for that eel to eat Luffy is unknown except Shanks was on shore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm saying that during that split second, Shanks swam there and if he attacked the seaking first, Luffy still would have died.</br>  <br> Higuma spent the last 12 years inside the sea king <br> waiting <br> watching <br> planning </br></br></br></br>  <br>He did, not only that he used a speed hack to reach Luffy.</br>  <br><br>Who says he could? Based on observations, people don't typically use all the types of haki.</br></br>  <br>There's a Bible story like that.</br>  <br>Post the very next page. He pulled Luffy backwards before it got him.<br><br>Also he had two master shots on his team, his first mate and Usopp's father. Why couldn't they do anything?<br><br>inb4 HURR DURR EVERYONE WAS LOST<br>If they had observational haki it wouldn't be a problem</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because back then even a smoke bomb let the bandit get away from Shanks, observation haki wasn't on Odas mind back then.</br>   there are still people who believe that covering yourself in armament haki makes you invulnerable to sharp objects   <br><br>But who said they had observational haki? We don't even know if they have it in the story as is.</br></br>  <br>I believe the only reason none consider Mihawk still a runner up for the title is that Shanks is not known nor he consider himself a swordsman, and he probably isn't anyway, people like Shanks, Rayleigh, Kizaru or Fujitora, use a sword but have way more fighting skills and haki/df abilities, even Mihawk stated being the best swordsman is easygame compared to aiming for the PK.</br>  <br>Is the story over? Did I miss something?<br><br>Until the story ends. There is no more One Piece coming out in WSJ, you can not claim something is abandoned because you don't know. You're not the editor, or Oda.<br><br>You're fucking retarded.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's because they are retarded powerlevel faggots that think just because characters like Shanks is a Yonko, means he is also a god.</br>  <br>People that use mangapanda scans are worse</br>  <br>That not true.<br>Both Shanks AND Blackbeard demonstrated at Marineford that they could hide from CoO.<br>So it stands to reason that Higuma might be able to too if he's fast enough to throw smoke against people using practically Goku's instant transmission.<br><br>It does not show how Shanks loses his arm and Higuma not shown eaten and skilled enough to evade a Roger pirate who becomes a Yonko whole crew.<br><br>Dude had a sword though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a impossible, even if she is, Koala would betray CP0 for Sabo. Their ship is ready to part, set sail.<br><br>Props for that Risita's pic tho.<br> Cuñaooo </br></br></br></br>  <br> Hello autism my old friend</br>  So Im not sure if this is an even match up or not, as I suck at thinking about these things, but who do you guys think would win ?<br><br>current Guts vs Current zoro<br><br>current Guts vs Current Mihawk<br><br>guts has everything available to him, berserker armor, all his ammunition etc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> quads wasted on a cancerous character from series X vs character from series Y post </br>  <br>Hope so.</br>  Chapter 70 has Kinemon's head on the cover.<br><br>Also there is a boy named Sabo, though that might just be the bad translation I'm reading.</br></br>  <br> gears were out of nowhere <br>Were you one of the anions who skipped Skypeia?<br><br>Jet Dial (and all the others) inspired Luffy initial Gears attacks.<br><br> Jet Punch! <br>-Gedatsu<br> Jet Pistol out of nowhere </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking wish dials were actually used more.<br><br>They had some use during the Davy Back boat race, a little in Water 7/Enies Lobby, but they start appearing far less after that.

It's not too late for him to be redeemed. Unlike Hodi who is a pure racist, his actions were guided by justified anger toward racists who massacred innocent fishmen, so it means he has a big heart.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That movie was really dark for a One Piece movie, but I really enjoyed it nonetheless.

Just didnt feel like fighting him, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. He isn't going to fight a lost battle.</br>  <br>it's more like Dressrosa had its own wave of people coming in. Dressrosa babies will be the next Marineford babbies, but they're not necessarily the same people.</br>  <br>and THIS one? Was he just constipated when Kaido was mentioned?</br>  <br>No, he couldn't win so he was worried thinking about having to fight him. But not afraid.</br>  <br>By your logic we need to ask a more important question: why didn't Roger eat more veggies to keep his health up!

Not only he fought 1vs1 and mortally wounded Whitebeard just to be hit by a insland killer attack and come to keep fighting a few minutes after, but he actually cares of the image of the Marines so people can truly feel save, sleep at night with fearing that a pirate would raid their homes, a strong warlord taking over their country like Crocodile or Doflamingo did. <br><br>I hope he gets to kill at least one more Yonko.</br></br></br>  <br>Bilic pls go</br>  <br>Worried is different from being afraid.<br>I am worried for your future but I am not afraid. Fear is a stronger emotion and I don't care enough about you to be afraid for your future.<br><br><br>You are right, he should have made Tontottas fight Doflamingo until Luffy's strength came back.<br><br><br> He let the seaking take his arm to inspire Luffy <br>What kind of crazy reasoning is that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a hack.</br>  <br>yeah im not going to argue with you for half an hour because our definitions of fear are different<br><br>good night, anon</br></br></br>  <br>Wrong dipshit.<br>They could have exploited Doflamingo's weakness to the Sew-Sew fruit, its just pure irony they didnt even use you idiot.</br></br>  <br> What kind of crazy reasoning is that? <br>It's not in-universe reasoning. Sometimes you don't need that.</br></br>  <br>He knows that Luffy has a good heart, but also Roger had, and killed and entire kingdom army just because he didn't liked them. <br><br>Luffy allowed hundreds of dangerous pirates escape just to save his brother, and possibly he killed more than an innocent Marine in Marineford, just to come a few days little and laugh at them after the battle. <br><br>Even if he's just like a child, his actions being pure, he has done just too much evil, and others like Bartolomeo are following his example. Seriously, Bartolomeo is fucking mass-murder, do you want that kind of people to be inspired by Luffy?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doflamingo's weakness to the Sew-Sew fruit <br>?</br></br>  <br>How is that irony? You are not even making sense</br>  <br>What, do you hate Justice so much?<br><br>Filthy pirate scum.</br></br></br>  <br>wut?</br>  <br>It's okay if we have different definitions of fear, good night.<br><br><br>What are you even saying?<br><br><br>Justice is great, I agree.<br>But only when Justice isn't corrupted like with the World Government.<br><br>By the way, I should ask since you all seem talkative and friendly today, does anyone feel talking about Rebecca with me today?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rebecca can suck a fart out of my ass.</br>  <br>She won't.</br>  <br>He's not a logia, his body doesn't have odd weaknesses like Crocodile or Enel. Assuming they were physically stronger faster and a great fighter, a person without haki could theoretically take him down.</br>  <br><br><br>*sighs* Back when they introduced the http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Nui_<wbr>Nui_no_Mi in Dressrosa it was assumed that they were to use that fruit to fight against doflamingo's strings.<br><br>It's just fucking coincidence.....sewing needle ....string.....duh?<br><br>HOW?<br><br>Because the tontotta could easily use the sewing needle against doflamingo's string they could have used it to stop birdcage or prevented doflamingo from using God String</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> But only when Justice isn't corrupted like with the World Government. <br><br>Akainu is actually against most of WG decisions, but he still carries them as a good soldier. <br><br>And he's trying to make the marines better and more efficient. You can't expect him to make the world better in just two years, but he's the one who choose Fujitora after all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the tontotta could easily use the sewing needle against doflamingo's string they could have used it to stop birdcage or prevented doflamingo from using God String <br>how?</br></br>  <br>70% of the story? That's barely believable.</br>  <br>How does a doctor stitch a wound? With special string. How does a doctor stitch a wound? With a sewing needle.</br>  <br>Akainu seems to take extreme actions and somehow allow pirates like Shichibukais to hurt people instead of erasing this status, unlike Fujitora. But he also seems to believe in his justice, so maybe he is a good guy who happened not to think enough about what to do for other people and ended up hurting many innocent people that shouldn't have been hurt. I hope he will learn something from Fujitora.</br>  <br>what does that have to do with undoing bird cage, though? i really don't see the connection here. the two fruits seem to overlap more than they contrast imo</br>  <br> *sighs* <br>Holy cancer</br></br>  <br>That's right, we're closer to 60 than 70. I hope.</br>    <br>that's most likely the case. There's no way in fucking hell he would be able to wrap up everything that's left in a decent way if we're at 70% already. Vegapunk, Dragon, the four emperors, Raftel, the bigass war, Uranus, and these are only the very few things I came up with. Unless he wants it to bomb very very hard, we're nowhere near close 70%</br>  <br> joining when he meets Luffy again <br><br><br>b-but the thing is, they might not meet</br></br></br></br>  <br>  somehow allow pirates like Shichibukais to hurt people instead of erasing this status, unlike Fujitora.  <br><br>Have you read Marineford or the latest chapters? Fujitora couldn't and Akainu couldn't do it either, but both of them want the Shichibukai to disappear. <br><br><br><br><br>We're not going to see more than a Yonko fight, plus Blackbeard one. And I bet that one of them will have either Dragon or Vengapunk, maybe both (Kuma was in good terms with Vengapunk after all). <br><br>In 400 chapters he can do it, but only if he stops doing stupid filler like in this saga. I don't get why he need to put Viola in every chapter explaining what was going on, and showing us a few pages of people suffering each chapter. &lt;<br><br>All of that just to round chapter numbers and let a cliffhanger at the end of each episode. One Piece would be much better if we got 50 pages each month. It would be 10 less that we got now, and Oda wouldn't have that pacing problems.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In 400 chapters <br>I just don't think it's enough. I want adventure to go along with the plot, not just the plot.</br></br>  <br>if he really wraps it up in 400 chapters I'm going to be fucking mad even solely for all the time we've spent in Dressrosa<br><br>about the yonko fights, he already challenged Big Mom personally and Kaido somehow indirectly, the only I can see not fighting him is Shanks. But even then, Luffy stated he wants to take down all four of them. I expect him to face off with at least Kaido and Big Mom</br></br></br>  <br>I'm expecting Blackbeard to kill Shanks because the villain killing the mentor is like, demanded by law or something.</br>  Luffy will defeat all the people in 399 chapters and then just stretch all the way to the One Piece in one chapter.  <br><br>I am really expecting the Kaido arc being a massive Davy Back Fight. <br><br>Either that or whatever Yonko Luffy fights. Foxy said that was somehow popular between pirate crews to strength them. What better way to create an endless army that to fighting in a game where you don't lost any assets and barely damage your fleet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You make a good point, Satan.</br>  <br>Akainu doesn't like pirates, but he barely tries to stop Shichibukais. On the other hand, Fujitora personally stood up against a Shichibukai by letting Luffy beat Doflamingo even though as a Marine official, helping Doflamingo was his duty. It's indirectly because of him that Doflamingo was beaten. Before that, he even openly claimed that he wanted to erase the Shichibukai status.</br>  <br>that would be anticlimatic as shit. And against someone like Kaido? No way in hell, if that guys is as sanguinary as people make him out to be he will want to tear Luffy apart with his own hands. Could happen with Big Mom though, I'll give you that, but she gives me the impression of someone wanting to eat Luffy alive</br>  How do you guys feel knowing that you will keep reading One Piece for 15+ more years and that you will all be over 35 years old by then?  Consider the following: Luffy &amp; Law finally get to Zou, only to learn that Foxy has captured Bepo and some other important Heart Pirates in a game of DBF, and now the pirate alliance has to play that fucking game against him.  <br>I am already reading One Piece for 13 years now and I am almost 35 anyway</br>  <br>assuming I don't die first, I'm okay with that.</br>  <br>Like I'm part of something bigger than myself.</br>  <br>and then, just as they're about to win, this guy shows up. Three chapters of fighting the old bastard, then Oda goes on hiatus for two years</br>  <br>I would be glad if one piece continued that long</br>  <br>Just when Guts is finally getting off the boat, too. Oh dear.</br>  <br>Why not? It would be unexpected for most readers and fun. More enjoyable that having the SH running all over the place fight the same lieutenants. We would also get the Captain vs Captain fight, but instead of the same boring fights with the rest of the SH, we can get some Team vs Team fight for a game, races or some other fun and enjoyable shit. <br><br>It would give the adventure that we had been missing since Thriller Bark.</br></br></br>  <br>Robin and Nami are exceptionally hot in this one.</br>  <br>before that we'll be getting one or two chapters about Rickert and his anal rape, probably. Then finally, the boat ride ends</br>  http://kat.cr/blog/SushiKushi/post/<wbr>an-open-letter-to-nyaa-herkz/<br><br>ayy</br></br></wbr>  <br>  Whats up guys? <br><br>Fuck off scene fags.</br></br></br>  What the hell? Anime uploads are no longer allowed on nyaa???  <br>It's just one sub group, but still, that sucks.</br>   AnimeRG <br><br>And nothing of value was lost.</br></br>  literally who  <br>I've never even heard of those guys. That's how insignificant they are.</br>  <br>Damn that sucks. Any idea why?</br>  Is this why SubaHibi is delayed? herkz please.  It would be interesting to know the reason for the block though.<br><br>I doubt it's because of bad quality when shit like Hadena is allowed on Nyaa.</br></br>  Just the cartel protecting their territory.  <br>Hadena is allowed ironically because Hadena have a history of making people shit their lungs out with laughter.</br>  <br>Nyaa mafia.<br><br>Nothing new.</br></br></br>  Just your usual Nyaa cartel bullying.  <br>I don't give a fuck who uploads what and it doesn't matter if AnimeRG's subs are shit.

I refuse to accept that the most menacing being in the universe is a skinny purple cat. I really hope they will come with some cliche bullshit like he's just skinny because he is containing his power like freeza.  Maybe it's a good thing his lack of transformation would subvert expectation.  But Frieza's most powerful form was the least threatening looking  <br>All Dragon Ball villains look anything but threatening.</br>  <br>Freeza looked scary as fuck</br>  <br><br>Except Piccolo.</br></br>  <br>That's not scary looking<br>That's ayy lmao looking<br><br>The GROKE was scary<br>Frieza looked like a purple dude made out of glass</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bills <br> Villain </br></br>  <br><br>No. He was small and looked like a doll or something. The reason he was intimidating was because of all the hype that surrounded the character and because of his attitude.</br></br>  <br>And look at kid buu, kid is least threatening but he was most powerful</br>  <br>Eh, I'd say the big jolly Buu is less threatening looking than kid Buu<br>At least kid Buu has abs... not that that counts for anything considering he's basically made of gum</br></br>  <br> I refuse to accept that the most menacing being in the universe is a skinny purple cat. <br><br>Then I have good news for you. The most menacing being in the universe is actually a blue gay dude with a crazy hairdo.</br></br></br>  <br>Toriyama started the trope of small, scrawny guys being stronger and more intimidating than big, muscular oafs. He's likely to stick with it even if it's been about 20 years since DBZ. The problem is that fucking everybody copied him to the point where we can automatically assume that if an anime has a muscular character, he's a fucking jobber. <br><br>So yes, the most menacing being in the 7th universe is a skinny purple cat with Egyptian jewelry and MC Hammer pants.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Buuhan was the most powerful. Kid Buu was the most dangerous because he was pure evil and had zero restraint.</br></br>  <br>Whis isn't a bad guy like beerus, so he doesn't count.</br>  <br> I refuse to accept that the most menacing being in the universe is a skinny purple cat. <br>He's not.  Its Whis. </br></br>  <br>Wasn't Super buu(The one who absorbs gohan) the most powerful?</br>  <br><br>And that's why Broly will never be canon.</br></br>  <br><br>Whis turned Beerus into what he is today. Whis is pretty much responsible for everything Beerus does.</br></br>  <br>If you're in a position to stop a bad guy from doing bad things, and you choose not to, you're as bad as him</br>  <br>So the most powerful being in the universe is a metrosexual NEET who lives alone with his cat?</br>  Is Beerus the most realistic interpretation of how a humanoid cat would act?<br><br>They're all assholes but in a completely impersonal and kind of lovable way.</br></br>  <br><br>That's a God I can pray to.</br></br>  <br>Super Buu was actually the most powerful, Kid Buu just lacked any restraint and never stopped fighting.<br><br>SS3 Goku also wasn't as strong as Mystic Gohan or SS3 Gotenks, so if they had fought Kid Buu it would've been easier.</br></br></br>  <br> They're all assholes <br><br>I've had a lot of cats and all of them had distinct personalities. Some are really nice and attentive. Not every cat fits the asshole stereotype.</br></br></br>  I don't know if I'd even call Beerus a villain. Antagonist sure, but villain is pushing it.  <br> so if they had fought Kid Buu it would've been easier. <br><br>Really? None of them were able to destroy Buu's matter. Only the super genkidama was able to do that. Vegeta, Mystic Gohan and Gotenks were able to beat Buu and blow him up over and over again. But nothing they did actually defeated him.</br></br></br>  <br>This<br>I think the asshole cat meme stems from people who just have absolutely no idea how to take care of an animal and blame the animal instead of their own incompetence<br>Cats aren't assholes<br>Cats with shit owners are assholes</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Beerus from Super looks like a villain. Beerus from BoG does not.</br></br>  <br>The two are literally the same character</br>  So is the Super or movie version of BoG/RoF canon?  So if he is Beerus why do they call him Bills in super.  <br>Good point, I guess. They wouldn't have gotten as badly beaten up as Goku and Vegeta did in the end though.</br>  <br><br>In BoG, the destruction Beerus caused was meaningful and necessary for the balance of the universe. In Super, he is presented as an asshole who destroys innocent worlds for no reason when he feels like it.</br></br>  <br>Bad subs romanizing the Japanese wrong. His name is a pun on beer (and Whis is whiskey).</br>  <br>He uh... was shown doing that shit in BoG t-<br>THAT WAS THE FUCKING PLOT OF BOG YOU IDIOT</br></br>  <br> His name is a pun on beer ( <br><br>And on virus.</br></br></br>  <br> That's not scary looking <br> That's ayy lmao looking <br><br> ayy lmaos aren't incredibly scary </br></br></br></br>  <br>I took what Old Kai said to mean that he just doesn't give a shit (which we also saw in BoG). That doesn't mean BoG's balance explanation is suddenly wrong.</br>   I refuse to accept that the most menacing being in the universe is a skinny purple cat. <br>wow you're so serious</br>  <br>I don't know why people are getting so anal about Beerus destroying shit at whim, he is the other side of the coin he is a God of destruction, there is no pattern or order to chaos, it is chaos. <br><br><br>No, forget the subs and listen to the audio they call him Bills-Sama.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Originally Virus, but Toriyama's a goof and thought it was Beer, so now it's Beer and Whis<br>God knows what Whis was originally</br></br></br>  <br>What's fat Beerus's name and what drink is he?</br>  <br>I think Toriyama only named Whis because he thought Beerus was beer. There was no original pun for Whis.</br>  <br><br>According to the plot of BoG, Beerus' destruction was purposive. Even if he blew up the earth because he didn't get his pudding, it would've helped restoring the balance of the universe.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's my guess too, but I wonder what Whis' name was originally<br>Did he even exist originally?</br></br>  <br><br>Champa(gne)</br></br>  <br>IIRC His name is Champa The drink is champagne</br>  DB &gt; Super &gt; DBZ &gt;&gt;&gt; DBGT  <br>There is literally no difference between blowing up Earth for pudding and blowing up half that one planet for whatever it was (I forgot tbh). Both Super and BoG show Beerus as extremely petty and short-tempered.<br><br>You're taking what Old Kai said way too literally.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Fat Buu was way more menacing</br>  <br>I doubt it.<br><br>The original plan for Beerus, and why he was named Virus, was that he was a god of evil whose hate and darkness spread through people like a plague. I think he was going to be the reason the Saiyans were assholes.<br>Whis doesn't really fit into that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know why people are getting so anal about Beerus destroying shit at whim, he is the other side of the coin he is a God of destruction, there is no pattern or order to chaos, it is chaos.  <br><br>People were saying that in the first two episodes, but in the 3rd one we got a speech straight from the old Kai about how Beerus' destruction is meaningless. <br><br>In Super itself, they've said nothing about any cycle of creation and destruction.</br></br></br></br></br>  No-andriods cell is still the most intimidating DBZ villian  <br> There is literally no difference between blowing up Earth for pudding and blowing up half that one planet for whatever it was  <br><br>The former has a justification and the latter does not. In BoG, Beerus is just doing his job as a god who helps managing the universe. If it doesn't matter which species he exterminates, then why not pick the one that is rude while you're visiting? You're right that both versions of the character are petty and short-tempered. These characteristics don't make you automatically evil though. Killing billions of intelligent lifeforms for no good reason makes you clearly evil though.</br></br></br>  At least his tail isn't a disgusting stump  <br><br>I can agree with this. Not sure about Super yet though. Liked the first episode, hated the second, and loved the third</br></br>  <br>He had no good reason in BoG either. Pudding is not a good reason.<br><br>He clearly wasn't saying "I'm going to destroy Earth for the universal balance" back then either.</br></br></br>  <br>akari shot first<br><br> inb4 ayy lmao apologist </br></br></br>  <br>But we got a narration saying that the destruction was necessary and purposeful, while in Super we get the old Kai saying that it's all meaningless. That puts his actions in very different context.</br>  <br><br>He is intimidating because of what he does, not because of how he looks.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm a lot more afraid of Femwhis than of actual Whis. For some reason, she seems a lot more sinister to me.</br></br>  <br> small, scrawny guys being stronger and more intimidating than big, muscular oafs. <br>Hey.</br></br>  <br><br> I AM evil. Stop laughing! </br></br>  <br>It is the up pony-tail, only bitches wear up pony-tails.</br>  <br>Cell's first form is always going to be my favorite DBZ villain design.</br>  <br>Hello</br>  <br>First from Cell looks so great god damn</br>  <br>Super Buu was Buu at his most powerful and devious. Kid Buu wanted to destroy fucking everything but was technically the weaker form.</br>  <br><br>B-but Makoto is not a bitch ;__;</br></br>  <br>he's not canon?!</br>  <br><br>He reminds me of Bubble Man.</br></br>  <br>Big floppy penis head form was pretty threatening looking.</br>  <br><br>He is one of the few DBZ villains who would actually look good in live action.</br></br>  <br>who can also kick anyone's sorry ass in the DBZ universe (in his reality) including Beerus</br>  <br>He was messing up her title call. Evil ayyy lmao deserved it.</br>  <br>Are you so naive to think Beerus is a bad guy? He's the fucking god of destruction and that's his shtick. Sure he's a complete dick but that doesn't make him bad.</br>  <br><br>In Super, he seems bad. His title doesn't matter. If he just destroys worlds for no reason, he is evil. All the other gods actually do something important. So far, he doesn't and only have the title of a god. In BoG, he wasn't evil. In Super, he seems to be (maybe that changes later and they only make him seem evil now because he is the antagonist of the first arc).</br></br>  <br>Of course he isn't.  It's a little girl robot. </br>  <br>The Prawn from District 9 were kinda what I'd imagine Live Action Cell to look like. Except you know, not as friendly.</br>  <br>Destruction is needed so that new life can be created. Nothing evil about it.</br>  <br>but he blows up the entire planet, not just the life on it.</br>  <br>It's a lot more efficient<br>Are you calling him evil for blowing up a big rock?</br></br>  Nah beerus shouldn't have a second form. It'll just ruin the fact that a GOD had to change.  Gonna leave this here.  <br>What is this? Are these real? Couldn't they get sued for this?</br>   Cell is revived and adds some of Beerus to his genetic makeup <br> suddenly Cell God of Destruction </br>  <br>Who says gods even have genes</br>  <br> Abuse your child <br> Child turns out to be a dick <br> WOOOOW WHAT AN ASSHOLE KID I SHOULD HAVE BEAT HIM MORE <br><br> Take poor care of your cat <br> Cat becomes a dick <br> Wooooow cats are assholes fuck cats </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The Backyardigans (2004), a relatively old Nick Jr. show, came before Toriyama's designs. I do question if this design my Toriyama was intentional.<br><br>Whether legal action can be taken? Haven't there been designs based off other works before?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't Cell go SSJ or SSG?</br>  <br>AAAAH HAHA HAHAHA</br>  <br>In terms of threatening it'd be Super Buu &gt; Kid Buu &gt; Fat Buu &gt; Anorexic Black Buu<br><br>Super Buu is tall as fuck and ripped.<br><br>Kid Buu, for his size is pretty jacked too.<br><br>Fat Buu is Fat Buu<br><br>Anorexic Buu looks like a shit someone would take after eating a bunch of black licorice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anorexic Black Buu <br>It's Evil Buu you fucking pleb.</br></br>  Revival of F sub when?  <br>You niggers still haven't dub the movie? Why? That shit was released already everywhere.</br>  <br><br> Cell Return <br><br>This would mean the return of Norio Wakamoto<br>ALL OF MY YES<br><br> When Norio Wakamoto was practicing his voice for Cell, young kids would go outside his home and say "Come out Cell, fight us" so he come out yelling "who wants to be absorbed" in his Cell voice. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I understand what you're throwing down.<br>and I agree.</br></br>  he will be like that bug dude from toriko and take the rings off his arms and become swole as shit  <br>It's just fanart.</br>  <br> super genkidama <br>Female voice</br></br>  <br><br>whis - whiskey</br></br>  <br>His alternate form will be his alternate universe counterpart which is essentially a fat version of him</br>  <br>Read</br>    <br> Oh what a funny coincidence <br> Wait <br> Those are literally the same exact animals and color schemes <br><br>D-did Toriyama really rip off an American kids show?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a good question...</br>   super literally just retelling battle of gods story <br>For what purpose</br>  <br>You know, form 2 would look a loot better if he kept the same proportions and didn't just inexplicably bulk up then shrink again</br>  <br>It will retell Revival of F as well</br>  <br>No it wasn't. He bulked up at 100%.</br>  <br> Bigger <br> Then more efficient, but not as much. <br>Meh.</br></br></br>  <br>the purple one is a kangaroo or something, not a cat</br>  Watching Super and wow Jap King Kai has a weird voice<br><br>Nigga sounds like he's on Quaaludes all the time</br></br>  <br> God of Destruction <br> implying he won't dance to power up and have a berserk mode </br></br>  REady for Goku losing to Supes on Death Battle again?  Gay  <br>Why does anybody give a shit about death battle again? It's literally just two random dude's opinions.<br><br>It's like saying "Ready for Goku winning to Supes on Anonymous's post again?"</br></br></br>  <br><br>I found Beerus' second form. It works kinda like SSJ3 in that he just grows more hair.</br></br>  <br>Just like SSJ1.5 that doesn't count as a separate form</br>  Does Supreme Kai not care that Fat Buu has all his coworkers trapped inside him? When Vegito was absorbed he put a barrier that let him stay fused for a while inside Buu, so what I'm asking is can't they repeat the same thing to restore the fused Supreme Kai?<br><br>God, Elder Kai and Supreme Kai are incompetent shitheads.</br></br>  do we see more fat beerus next episode  <br>They should've let Goku win to force a trilogy.</br>  <br>There is really no scenario where Goku could win sadly.<br><br>I read that panel right too left out of habit. Blew my mind.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>I'm so confused. I'm watching Kai right now, only at the Frieza Saga. I've seen the movie with Beerus, but not Super. Why are there two Beerus's and Whis's?!</br>  <br>Super is a retelling of Revival of F and Battle of Gods.<br><br>Fat Beerus and Femwhis are from an alternate universe, and are going to be a major driving force in the series.</br></br></br>  Hopefully Beerus continues to be the bro he turned out to be in the movies and helps Goku in his own unique way to become stronger.  <br> All the other gods actually do something important <br>Like King Kai and his hobbies?</br></br>  <br>I want a fucking dub, screw subtitles. If I wanted to listen to an hour of Japanese screaming and gibberish, I'd go to PornHub.<br><br>I'd rather watch the film muted than listen to gibberish.</br></br></br>   People saying Beerus is the villian <br><br>He is literally doing his motherfucking job. He is supposed to be the chaos in the universe that causes destruction which can make room for new life.</br></br>  <br>whis is stronger<br>and much gayer looking</br></br>  <br>My head-cannon will not separate ki from magic. Goku shouldn't lose.</br>  You are all now aware that this officially exists  <br>Is Revival of F set after BoG? Also, has Revival of F been dubbed yet?! Pirate Bay has failed me.</br>  <br> And look at kid buu, kid is least threatening but he was most powerful <br><br>other way around<br><br>Kid buu was the weakest (SSJ3 Goku could take him while SSJ3 wasn't enough to take Fat Buu), but was the most threatening because the other forms had some restraint where as Kid buu would just go to any world, blow it up, regenerate, go to next world, repeat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>impress.<br>here's my trips</br></br>  Its a theme in Dragonball to have villains that are stronger then they look on the outside.<br><br> Master Roshi <br> Mercenary Tao's pink gi <br> Mr. Popo <br> Nappa, the larger of the Saiyans being weaker then Vegeta <br> Frieza's last form looking a lot less menacing then his third form ( Krillin even comments on this in the show ) <br> Majinn Buu </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>none of the movies he is in can happen in the dbz timeline</br></br>  <br>I feel like DBZ would've been better if it'd ended with Gohan fighting Kid Buu. Up until Vegito showed up, it really felt like they were handing the battle over to the new generation... and that was apparently the plan originally.</br>  <br>How could you hate Vegeta family fun time? It was fun and insightful on Vegeta</br>  obligatory post<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kgm<wbr>QRUr5lJQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> I refuse to accept that the most menacing being in the universe is a skinny purple cat.  <br>That's the joke.</br></br>  <br>My favorite character is Gohan, so of course I wanted him to be the one to best Buu and stay MC (a different anon)</br>  <br>I guess since they've been absorbed for so long they became completely assimilated into Buu. I wonder if they're dead.</br>  <br>I think they say that. I'm not sure. And I think they're dead... But now that i think about it. If they're dead... Then where the fuck are they? Are they not going to die until Buu dies?</br>  <br><br>So with Beerus, oolong, multiple anthropomorphic animals in the background. IS akira a furfag or what?</br></br>  <br> insightful on Vegeta <br><br>We got to see insight on how he hates people and only wants to train and become stronger than Goku. We sure did learn a lot there.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant as a family man. Lol. It honestly made me feel bad for Bulma and Trunks. <br><br>God I miss Future Trunks.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It fits the mode Akira Toriyama set perfectly. Despite how disgusting and overdone Cell's first two form are (double points if you consider that nasty as shit form Cell took to ride future Trunks' time-machine back to this timeline), his most intimidating form looks the least offensive and most human.</br></br>  <br>Yes, she is.</br>  <br> So yes, the most menacing being in the 7th universe is a skinny purple cat with Egyptian jewelry and MC Hammer pants. <br>Uh, no. It's a tall, skinny, blue guy with white hair and a staff in robes.</br></br>  <br>That's the most powerful being, but he doesn't really do anything menacing.</br>  <br>all the dbz villains were pathetic looking</br>  If Mystic Gohan is more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 Goku, if he went Super Saiyan 2 (which would make him 100 times stronger), shouldn't he have been able to easily defeat Kid Buu and maybe even hold his own against Beerus?  <br> cell <br> not the scariest damn thing on the first watch through <br>anon plz.</br></br></br>  Ironically, Dragon Quest series has better monsters and final bosses than DBZ  <br>I think at that point Goku was such an icon there would backlash in the fanbase and if that's not it Idk why they didn't just have Gohan beat Buu</br>  <br> scariest dbz villain <br> not Buu <br>I had actual nightmares about Buu as a child.</br></br></br>  <br> If Mystic Gohan is more powerful than Super Saiyan 3 Goku, if he went Super Saiyan 2 (which would make him 100 times stronger), shouldn't he have been able to easily defeat Kid Buu and maybe even hold his own against Beerus? <br><br>Gohan's 'Ultimate form' doesn't work like that. It's basically all his potential up to that point, being released, without the negative drawbacks of using Super Saiyan, Kaioken or any mutiplier.<br><br>Since it's all his potential, up to that point, there's not secondary form. Going 'Super Saiyan 2' does nothing, though Gohan could still use his Super Saiyan forms, if he want to, they just can't be stacked onto his Ultimate form. <br><br>The point is it would be pointless to use them compared to his Ultimate/Mystic form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posting shitty images from memebook and quiptter </br>  <br>He did use his Super Saiyan form in Resurrection F, I thought. Was still one-shot by Golden Frieza.</br>  <br> not getting the joke <br>get /out/ normie</br></br>  <br>Which was dumb. He went Super Saiyan in the early promos for BoG too, but that was just for the promos. He was knocked out by just chair Freeza.</br>    <br> He did use his Super Saiyan form in Resurrection F, I thought. Was still one-shot by Golden Frieza. <br><br>Yeah. But this that's after Gohan lost power again, since RoF takes place nearly 6 years after the battle with Kid Buu. Hell, Gohan didn't even know if he could turn Super Saiyan in that film.</br></br></br>  I'm finishing the manga because I barely remember the anime at all, do I need to watch/read something else to follow this?  <br>nah, i couldn't get over the fact buu looked and sounded like a fat retarded kirby when i was young.</br>  <br>I kinda wish he could get some special Super Saiyan form like how Goku and Vegeta can go Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan now that they've "beyond God." Ultimate Super Saiyan Gohan.</br>  <br><br>No, because his power isn't maximum.</br></br>  <br>nigga that ain't even the craziest shit Heroes has pulled<br><br>Majins<br><br>Majins everywhere</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck there's even Baby Janemba<br><br>there's even MAJIN Baby Janemba</br></br></br>  <br>there's Super motherfucking #17 after absorbing #16 and Cell</br>  <br>Oh no, I'm aware. SSJ3 Bardock is just the newest addition</br>  <br>Him and playable Kais</br>  <br>And hey, at least it gave us this</br>  <br>That update also gave Mira a Super Saiyan equivalent.<br><br>Literally Super Saiyan, as in Mira is using his Saiyan genes to go Super, since he's basically Cell but with a shitton more donors and DEMON MAGIC.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't he get more power from Super 13 than 16?</br>  <br>So how long until Gohan gets SSJ3 in Heroes  Future Gohan doesn't count </br>  <br>SOON<br><br>maybe</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I wouldn't be surprised if they give GT Gohan SSJ4<br><br>Still waiting on Super Saiyan Pan. Everybody knows its gonna happen eventually.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like they don't know what she'll look like. They did Note, who's basically teenage Pan.<br><br> Watch, they do something crazy and come up with like... Legendary Super Saiyan Pan or other such nonsense. </br></br></br>  <br>17 will never fuse with a person who listens to Country.</br>  is the movie out in torrents yet?  <br> It's sad but there's actually some newfags here that will believe that this picture is actually geniune and won't even think that's some deviantart works. </br>  <br>Heroes has fixed many of GT's mistakes.</br>  So, next Saiyan avatar power-up, will it be Super Saiyan God or SSJ4?  <br>Z's too.<br> "What's that? Disappointed that Goku and Vegeta never followed through with the Fusion Dance and fought Super Buu? WELL GUESS WHAT, FUCKERS, WE'RE TOSSING SUPER SAIYAN 2 ON TOP OF THAT!" </br></br>  <br>Fuck you cunt.</br>  <br>4, then God mode, since 4 is the weaker form.</br>  <br> This guy will have a second form like all other DBZ villains had, right? <br>Literally not a single chance.<br> I refuse to accept that the most menacing being in the universe is a skinny purple cat <br>That's exactly why Toriyama went with this kind of design.<br> I really hope they will come with some cliche bullshit like he's just skinny because he is containing his power like freeza <br>Your tears. They are gonna be delicious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it's not SSJ4&gt;SSG</br>  <br>Only SSJ2?</br>  <br>Nigga we got Super Saiyan ape Gogeta!</br>  <br>Canonically, God is stronger than Super Saiyan 3 Vegeto.<br><br>Base Vegeto is as strong as Super Saiyan 4 Goku, according to the GT guidebooks.<br><br>God form is stronger.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Frieza race should get golden form right?</br>  <br>And then, shit just gets silly overpowered.<br><br>Super Saiyan 4 Vegetto when?</br></br></br>  <br>Why won't they draw SSJ3 eyes correctly</br>  <br><br>Why is he so sexy? I think it's the gloves.</br></br>  <br>Probably after gold ape Vegetto<br><br>I'd ask what is next for new villain forms, but I don't think you can predict those. No one could have seen this coming .</br></br></br>  <br>Why does this just look like a more sinister Gohan with grey highlights?</br>  <br>Dragon Ball Online villains. Seriously.</br>  <br>He definitely looks cool. I certainly appreciate Heroes for finally giving this to us.<br><br>I can honestly see a SSJ4 GT Gotenks as a possibility.</br></br></br>  <br>AND GUESS WHO'S BACK, FUCKERS<br><br>KING PICCOLO HERE TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE BEST PICCOLO DAY EVER</br></br></br>  <br>I meant new forms for existing villains.</br>  <br>Fused with Piccolo or Kami?</br>  <br>Mira got "Super Saiyan" so who knows.</br>  <br>Spider Cell when</br>  <br>Maybe, probably.<br><br>Fuck, could end up fused with Kami, Piccolo Jr, Nail, Slug, and... I dunno, Dende and Cargo or something.</br></br></br>  <br>Cell fused with Lavos SOON</br>  <br><br>They should give Piccolo (Jr.) a new form/power up for absorbing King Piccolo</br></br>  <br> GT guidebooks <br>Those guys don't even explain Vegeta keeping Baby's power up and therefore being stronger than Majuub after he leaves his body or Baby Gohan as main host being stronger than the one Goku faced</br></br>  <br>Hey, you wanna bring GT into it, that's what it says. Vegeto is SSJ4 Goku tier in base form.<br><br>God form Goku is stronger than Vegeto, according to them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Laziness/ lack of creativity. Its easier to make an alien race if you just take random parts from animals and throw em together</br></br>  <br>Welp can't be helped they also said Vegeta never reached SSJ2 besides in Majin form can't blame but can't trust them ? Also were they the ones who said Janemba was the strongest movie character? As strong as Buuhan no less</br>  <br> Oolong <br> alien <br>nigga what</br></br></br>  <br>Point stands, official sources put God form above Super Saiyan 4.</br>  <br>Beerus comments in Xenoverse don't count right?</br>  <br> Frieza looked like a purple dude made out of glass <br>Freeze IS a purple dude made out of glass. He's silica based.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, how do you take Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta saying "Maybe I can fight Lord Beerus now!" ?<br><br>Because it didn't exactly imply he thought he could do it before.<br><br> You are now realizing that GT is the timeline where Beerus got his pudding. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>http://daikuwabara.deviantart.com/a<wbr>rt/Backyardigods-531939345<br><br>Gullible as fuck.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> <br>Beerus VS SS4 Goku:<br><br>B: "It's a bit different from your god form.

I bet the first volume kid goku stronger than that because he is immune to bullut.</br>    <br>Who has the best design</br>  So I watched first three episodes of Super and I enjoyed them wholeheartedly.

Do it for Lawrence.</br></br>  <br>adolescence can continue after that for some</br>  <br>Holo has been her official name ever since the author confirmed it to be Holo.<br><br>Horo is the name fansubs used back before the author confirmed her name to be Holo. I'd say the authors word carries more weight on this than some fansubber.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Looks like Koro to me.</br></br>  <br> responding seriously <br> giving credence to author's intent </br></br>  <br><br/></br>  in a heartbeat without second thought, it would be a genuinely great experience traveling the world with her  Just like 10 more hours until the Moon Fever, are you fags ready for rapist Miia, Horsepussy and Papi?<br><br>Also, still looking for japanese raws of ch35. <br><br>If you want to see the specials here are they:<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And if some fegets don't know where to watch the episode of tomorrow:<br>  douyutv.com/5275  </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First for Cerea</br>  Second for the awooo~ that will never be.

It was fine last thread. </br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, I see.</br></br>  Why does she have a navel if harpies come from eggs?  <br><br>When would they even introduce the wolf-girl partner, a one-shot or during a normal chapter?<br><br> I'd say "if only there was a way to bring this idea up to Crab", but he probably gets enough "suggestions" as it is. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Monster Girls</br>  <br> Why does she have a navel if harpies come from eggs? <br><br>What do you think chick embryos are connected to in the egg?</br></br></br>  <br><br> These fucking animeonlyfags <br><br>At least read the fucking manga you faggots, there is no wolf but a Kitsune.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dont know that much about egg birth, but I dont think that is correct</br></br>  <br>I have read the manga, anon. Did you read the last thread at all?</br>  <br> At least read the fucking manga you faggots, there is no wolf but a Kitsune. <br><br>See  and <br><br>This is also excluding Polt, who is a "wan-wan edition Kobold."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> wan wan <br><br>I keep seeing that and I still have no idea what that means.</br></br></br>  <br>That was explained long time ago.<br><br>Every girl on MonMusume world keeps the standard way of give birth, that means Miia-Papi-Mero lay eggs, Rachnee (I have no idea), Cerea just drop the shit out of her pussy. The only thing different here is about the girls can get pregnant from a normal human or someone from the same race.</br></br></br>  <br>chickens have belly buttons, why wouldn't Papi?</br>  <br>Why do Rachnera and Miia have a navels?</br>  <br><br>Wan-wan is the Japanese onomatopoeia for the sound a dog makes while barking, much like the English onomatopoeia for the same sound is "woof-woof."<br><br> Fun fact, the ancient Greeks believed toads went "Brekekeke Coax Coax," we learn this from surviving records of a play featuring toads. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't try to fool people fags, that's only from the start of Monmusume and doesn't mean you know about the manga. Also if yoy really knows about it you should post some pages of the last 3 chapters translated.</br></br>  <br>Are birds in the belly button circle? Well, get this: Inside a bird's egg there is a tiny cord that connects the developing embryo to the yolk sac. When the egg cracks open, the hatchling does in fact have a miniscule residual scar where the cord was. As the nestling grows up, the scar fades. It's pretty much invisible by the time the bird takes its first giant step from the nest.<br><br>So, yes, baby birds do have a belly button. But it's more like a temporary tattoo.</br></br></br>  Can someone post the Jurassic World spoilers, you know the one with anime dinos? Please.  <br> Also if you really knows about it you should post some pages of the last 3 chapters translated. <br><br> That doesn't actually prove anything, all I'd need to do is go on Mangahere and crop some pages.<br><br>Mero is a princess, Ninetei gets off on power, lizards are dumb and Yukio is a copyright infringement.</br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Spiders carry thousands of children insife of them until that all burst from the abdomen and ride the mother until they are large enough to devour her.

RIP.</br>  Monstergirl 24/7 threads back?  <br>Oh, she got ripped, alright.</br>  <br>Too soon.</br>  <br> I honestly found that whole scene kinda fucked up/a bit disturbing. Like all the other characters die kinda "Off screen", or they die in relatively "quick" scenes, but for whatever odd reason they decided to give her this really weird, gratuitous scene where the dinosaurs basically torture her and play with her for a whole two minutes before she died. Like you'd expect that for the villain, but instead they do it for this character who's not even there long enough for the audience to really learn anything about her. </br>  <br>Who ever came up with this line is the philosopher of our time.</br>  <br>I was laughing hysterically when she died. That was so fucking funny.</br>  <br><br>Mosasaur.</br></br>  <br><br>Mosasaurus, if memory serves.<br><br>I felt it kind of added realism to it when I was watching, didn't realise the shitstorm it generated online. Like "You're never 100% safe until you're off the island."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not long enough.</br>  <br>The dinos don't really torture her willingly, they just fight over her.</br>  <br>Right, I know it's just animals fighting over food, it was just kinda torturous looking, if that makes sense, like how she was tossed around like a ragdoll and whatnot, chewed on by various dinosaurs.</br>  Cerea and papi are so fucking annoying in the anime, holy fuck.<br><br>Smith actually is best girl.</br></br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.   <br> Cerea and papi are so fucking annoying in the anime, holy fuck. <br><br>Papi is best in design and animation but worst in voice.<br><br>I mean, the actress herself is good but "excitable little Japanese girl" is always grating.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean best?</br>  I just want Miia to insert me into herself and full body hug my close while kissing me and telling me that she loves me  <br>We've been back since anime was announced<br><br>Keep it mon musu related<br>No MGE</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's physically impossible<br>Miia has nonexistant DEEPthroat<br>she eats small meals and cooks eggs before she eats them<br>she's a Lamia not a fucking snake<br>Suu is VORE fetish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She is a snake!

Guys. Imagine this. A NEET Dragon girl who hordes figures and other character goods as her treasure pile. Sleeps in a veritable mountain of dakimakuras. It's such an obvious archetype, so why the fuck hasn't it been made yet.  <br><br> Go doggy on Papi, push her off so she stumbles three steps forward.  <br> "Hubby! We do honeymoon tonight?" <br> Repeat <br> See dermatologist in the morning for ointment. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's such an obvious archetype, so why the fuck hasn't it been made yet. <br><br>Because we haven't seen a dragon girl yet, but /tg/ has talked about that archetype for months, and still talking about it today.</br></br></br>  <br> It's such an obvious archetype <br>That's why.</br></br>  <br>Penis in Vagina there friend, I think you need some sleep.</br>  <br>Obvious doesn't always mean bad.</br>  <br>Ok, since no kind anon answered my small request, I shall ask again: Does anyone have the picture of Rachnee being harassed by about 8 or 9 little loli spider babies?</br>  MONSTAH  Hmm...

Kii colors  Best day of the week already? good.  <br>I wonder why Today Suu doesn't have the visible core of Proto-Suu. <br>Not to mention she had a much more defined face. <br><br>I think only Rachne and Cerea survived with limited to no changes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The visual looks nice.

Madhouse's anime quality seems dropped really hard since their staff moved to other studio like MAPPA (which founded by the ringleader of old madhouse, Maruyama Masao).<br><br>Probably the only competent staff left are Ishizuka Atsuko (too bad she got crap project like NGNL and Hanayamata), and Asaka Morio.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hanayamata and parasyte weren't bad<br><br>Chihayafuru s3 when</br></br>  <br> Then: Chihayafuru, Tatami Galaxy, Kaiji <br> Now: HotD, Chaos;Head <br>Just use the image, even it's better at baiting than you are.</br></br></br>  <br>MAPPA is the new Madhouse.

For starters, Trigun, Gungrave, Monster, Paprika, and Chobits are some of the worst anime in the industry.<br><br>Parasyte is objectively better than all of Madhouses older works, and HOTD was innovative, fresh and unique to have vampires in a industry full of MOESHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>The part when Ainz flies through the skies is pretty well done, even if they put in screen the character that isn't talking to save money.</br>  <br> MAPPA is the new Madhouse. <br> Zankyou no Terror - flop <br> Garo: The Animation - flop <br> Punchline - flop <br> Ushio to Tora - HxH animation teams - will flop <br>Seems pretty accurate.
