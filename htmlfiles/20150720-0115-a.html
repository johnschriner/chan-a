[  First episode airs. <br> Bunch of threads. Everythings good. <br> Second episode airs. Now everyones read the manga. <br> The threads become manga threads, filled with spoilers. <br><br>The fuck is up with this shit? It happens every season. The only thing I'm able to watch with /a/ are original anime, or anime based on some LN that nobody has read, and even then, faggots usually pull up illustrations from the last novels, for some god damn reason.<br><br>Isn't there something we can do about this shit? I really wanted to watch Gakkou Gurashi with /a/ but I keep getting the show spoiled by pages and discussions when I enter the threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just don't visit the fucking thread.<br>I watch this show and I'm not even visit the threads anyway.</br>  Sounds like you're a casual complaining about spoiling yourself by browsing a discussion thread full of not casuals. You could filter posts, if you knew how to, you filthy casual. But if you really need to filter posts so you won't be triggered, you should probably just stop being a casual, casual.  Who gives a fuck about you. We already have a thread so fuck you for shitting up the board.  <br>Manga generally is better than the shit adaptation.</br>  <br>How am I a casual for not reading ahead?</br>  The anime is barely following the manga anyway.<br><br>Just keep watching the shitty adaptation, the manga spoilers probably wont happen.</br></br>  <br>While I agree there's been some shitty adaptions, I actually often find manga rushed. 19 page chapters rarely manages to convey a good fleshed out story. Of course, sometimes it does, and the Anime drags it out, like with Denpa Kyoushi which I hated. This anime doesn't seem like that.<br><br>I actually preferred Episode 1 of the Anime to Chapter 1 of the Manga.</br></br></br>  <br> I actually preferred Episode 1 of the Anime to Chapter 1 of the Manga. <br><br>Based on the first chapter/episode alone I would agree but the changes are going to have lots of consequences for the rest of the series.</br></br></br>  <br>It means the story didn't grab you strongly enough that you have to know everything there is to know about it immediately.<br><br>So yeah, you're a fucking scrub if you start watching a show, like it enough to browse the threads, and DON'T immediately go and read everything released about it so far.<br><br> How new are you, anon? This has been happening literally forever. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't you read the manga? It's fun to watch the first episode of an anime blind, then catch up with the manga before the second episode airs</br>  <br> you have to know everything there is to know about it immediately <br>Wow, and you talk about scrubs? Read the source material if you want to, sure, but this is some fucking weak-willed shit to completely lack patience.</br></br>  <br>It isn't weak willed though, it's better because you can compare differences between the source material and the adaptation</br>  <br>This is an anime and manga board. People obviously want to discuss the latest chapter especially since it's been scanlated consistently. Just like how people don't spoiler twists in the first episode from the anime, people don't want to spoiler stuff from 20 chapters ago because you should've read it by now. <br><br>If you prefer to watch the anime only that's fine and all, but you shouldn't complain about people discussing manga on /a/. This shit has been scanlated so no excuses about not reading the manga. Just avoid the threads</br></br></br>  Why do you need to come to /a/ anyways? Just enjoy the anime and shut up  Go to AnimeSuki. They literally have rules preventing people from posting unmarked spoilers in the anime threads.  Then don't go to the threads? Or make your own anime only threads if you feel like you need to  The manga's better from what I've seen so far, anyway. The umaibo part was pretty good though.   Am I the only one <br>Uhh no, not really. If you want the anime only, then don't pay attention to the spoilers since it's an "adaptation". It may or may not follow the story.</br>  <br>This kills the discussion threads.</br>  <br>This. Plus, most people are good about not spoiling the anime before it starts airing. One episode is enough to decide whether you want to read the manga or not, so it works fine</br>  <br> am I the only one <br>Yes reddit, you're a special snowflake. The one special snowflake who can't be bothered to read a short manga unlike the rest of us.</br></br>  <br> reading <br>People still do this?</br></br>  <br> he doesn't read <br>Normalfags need not apply</br></br>  ITT: butthurt animeonly thinks /a/ is obligated to tailor discussions about shit he's too lazy to read  <br>It took me about 1 hour to read the manga. Stop complaining and get to it.</br>  <br>I like animation, why would I spoiler it by reading the source material?</br>  <br>Its actually a big reason why /a/ stopped being nearly as fun like 6+ years ago.<br>I haven't watched any of this yet, but this particular case isn't the best example since the manga had actually been quite popular around here at least the last time I was a regular on this board.</br></br>  <br>I'm the other way around, i hate when I read a good manga and then the anime comes out and all these newfags shit it up.<br>/manga/ when?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, we should stop discussing manga so the animeonly babies don't get spoiled. <br><br>Just go back to reddit you fucking retard.</br></br></br>  First off, the adaptation is already doing things differently, so spoilers are likely not too big a deal. Second, why /not/ read the manga? If you're into the show wouldn't the source material interest you as well?

If so, why did Hardy's apostle retreat during the dragon arc? <br>You know the drill, standard procedure in dealing with regenerativre immortals who are not indestructible.

It has a large standing army that needed to be kept occupied. There was a portal, scouts claim the citizens on the other side don't appear to be armed. The Empire went and did Empire things.<br><br>The Empire had no choice, they have so many soldiers that they can't support them via taxes alone. And they can't just disband them as then they become bandits or rebels. Once you have an army you basically have to keep sending them out until they shrink to a manageable size again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A mischievous god open the gate to nipland<br>NotRoman Empire being Empire and decided to invade<br>???<br>Profit</br></br></br></br>  <br> and how does technology do against magic guys <br>In Gate magic is quite powerful. But it is a scarce resource and under-developed. And non-divine beings have very limited magic power, thus it is not practical to use them in the army.</br></br>  <br>ah sounds kinda like how ancient Rome crumbled<br><br>so does technology do well<br><br>I guess they can't send planes or something through the gate or something?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They can send planes but anything reliant on GPS is fucked (since the sattelites aren't there)<br><br>So they mostly use old equipment (and still steamroll the not-Romans)</br></br></br></br>  <br>The empire must have been retarded to get into that situation.</br>  <br> so does technology do well <br> I guess they can't send planes or something through the gate or something? <br>Even Roman technology is superior to magic. It is mentioned that siege engines basically rendered offensive mages obsolete as you can mass produce them. Magic users are too scare and couldn't scale up easily.</br></br></br>  <br>They can, but only a few F-4 Phantoms because lolnobudget</br>  <br>You know the answer</br>  so is she actually a neko girl or are the ears just some kind of traditional head gear?  <br>We've only seen cobras for now. They don't seem to have an airfield yet. But even if they did, Japan doesn't have any serious bombers anyway</br>  <br> The empire must have been retarded to get into that situation. <br>You act like this is unusual? It's just how war used to work.</br></br>  Enjoy the free lap dance.  <br>You're telling me no nation has ever told their peasant levies to fuck off and go back to tilling the land before?</br>  <br> imblying </br>    <br> You're telling me no nation has ever told their peasant levies to fuck off and go back to tilling the land before? <br>Telling your TRAINED and ARMED peasants to fuck off?<br>Sure, that was tried many times.

Interesting post code too.</br>  Just finished the manga. Judging from everyone else's reaction and the uncanny resemblance of the two. She finally snapped, right?  yes  she's a bear, jim.  <br>I was about to post this. Where can I find the other chapters?</br>  Kei is daijobu  <br>I wonder if we can see here again. She was the girl they saw before leaving the school right?<br> money says that she is still alive </br></br>  It's all Yuki's fault! The little retard made her snap!  <br>The little retard is keeping them together. On a side note, I wonder how she would react to being raped with her retard vision.</br>  <br>An even deeper delusion, where she's happily married, and her husband gives her sweet love every night...<br>Damn, that sounds depressing.</br></br>  <br>Delicious.</br>  Why do people complain about shovel being used goods when there is a literal goddess around?  <br> crossdressing boy </br>  I know this is a cute girls doing cute things, but why are adults almost completely absent? You would think there would be one adult that isn't infected  <br>Fuck off. Blonde Yui is a miracle.</br>  <br>Other humans in general have been pretty rare.</br>  <br> STANDING! </br>  Is het Ayaya the ultimate Ayaya?  <br>Now THAT I can fap to.</br>  <br>Footjob doujin when?</br>  I want them to be transported to the KinMoza world Ruu and Megu-nee included. They don't have to be dykes. I just don't want them to suffer. ;_;  <br>Wish granted.<br><br> The zombies are transported with them. </br></br></br>  <br> ON THE EDGE </br>  <br><br>Dig through the archives. Someone translated them sometime in the last 2 weeks or so.</br></br>  <br>The Mosaics can handle it... right?<br>Oh fuck. They're all goners once they encounter a blonde zombie.</br></br>  <br> ON THE CRATER </br>  <br> YOU FUCKED IT UP </br>  <br>I don't want to see my daughteru become a zombie</br>  <br> I'm sorry! </br>  I'm hoping the anime sparks enough interest so that scanlators pick up the pace.  <br>It's pretty caught up</br>  <br>I started self inserting myself and it got out of hand. It got to the point I went on patrol and I got bit but didn't tell the girls. Then I knew my time was running out so I gave into my selfish desires and molested one of them in the late night but didn't have the heart or condoms to ejaculate inside for possible infection. After the deed, I slide the revolver with one bullet that I found to her and tell her my situation. In the end I accepted everything.</br>  <br>There are only 2 chapters (36 &amp; 37) which have shit scans</br>  <br>We're caught up to the most recent chapter, though the last two are translated from Korean. The guy that usually does the Japanese scanlations is on vacation until next month.</br>  <br>You're a bad person even in your fantasies.</br>  <br>I wanna nipple on those thighs.</br>   It's all Yuki's fault! The little retard made her snap! <br><br> I think Yuki saw the onset of a nervous breakdown coming from Yuuri and knew what would come next, so she set the bear down, knowing that Yuuri might go back in and bring it back. She slipped it back there when nobody but Kurumi would see it. Yuki, of all people, knows this insanity shit better than most. </br></br>  This better have a happy ending. The girls are just trying to get by in a zombie infested world and so much bad shit has happened to them.  ;_;   <br><br>where can I find 36 and 37? it's not up on the manga sites or listed on manga updates.</br></br>  On another note, where do you think the anime will go? Original anime end, or will they stop with the "graduation"?  <br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/gerMN<wbr>YWC/file.html</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, she left the bear there and prayed to it as a memorial to all the dead children. Rii was never supposed to adopt it.</br>  <br>Graduation. I don't know why people think it'll suddenly veer off into anime original territory. It's exceedingly obvious that the author still wants to go to the same place, but is just taking a slightly new route in the anime to get there.</br>  <br> she's probably already eaten a few studentes <br>Zombies are already there</br></br>  <br><br>thanks anon</br></br>  In this universe, a yuru and a mosaic are straight.    <br><br>I feel like it's a bit TOO obvious. Maybe it's a fake out.</br></br>  <br>she's too far gone now, man.</br>  <br>I really love the authors paneling work that's what it's called right?</br>  <br>That's the great thing about this series. They've pulled enough bait-and-switch crap that people are left wondering if the ruse is itself a ruse and if it's all part of some mega-meta ruse.</br>  <br>TOO LEWD<br><br><br>TOO FUCKING LEWD</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't see a bad end, so far the girls always avoided permanent problems and are generally ok (zombie Shovel being the exception). One might die but that's it.</br>  <br> Ruu "crying" at night. <br><br>That's just fucked up.</br></br></br>  I can't wait for episode 3. This series is good.<br><br>I even got my sister into it. She likes horror.</br></br>  <br> but that's it <br>One of them dying isn't small.</br></br>  <br>Well, it's smaller than 4 of them dying, rape dungeons, army experiment guinea pigs.</br>  <br> are generally ok <br>Rii is even more messed up than cathat.<br>Shovel is dying.<br>Miki is going to see her 2nd close friend dead soon.<br>I doubt cathat can survive another megunee type trauma when she see shovel turn into a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's ok, anon. Please don't cry. </br>  <br>The thing is, I want to see more things. The problem with zombie scenarios is that they mostly go for the "some die, some live" part with a huge hope for a brighter tomorrow. I want to see a scenario where the girls lose their humanity little by little and on several aspects without going full edge/rape dungeon. And so far, I am satisfied. To have them turned so subtly into mental and physical wrecks and live through it would be so damn satisfying.</br>  <br>Kurumi has pulled off miracles before, she can do it again.</br>  Manga Rii looks like Shenua sometimes.  <br>But those things aren't going to happen. Death would badly fuck them up. They are very close and still young remember. Especially if Yuki died</br>  <br>I feel like if one of them dies it's pretty much over.</br>  <br><br>Fuuuuuuuuck. No wonder bigtits was having some weird visions.<br><br>Betting for the teddybear getting damaged, so that they have to sew it and end with an (imaginary) frankenloli</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they can handle losing Rii. But right now Kurumi and Yuki are their most important members, I don't think either of them will die unless it's at the end.</br>  Was the "Mii-kun! Pantsu!!" scene from last episode in the manga too ?<br><br> we might be in for a fanservicey ride </br></br>  <br> Kurumi and Yuki <br>You do realize that only leaves Miki, right?<br><br>She has proven to be strong completely on her own and doesn't even need Yuki's mental support all that much</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like Miki is the most likely to survive out of the bunch, though.</br>  <br>Miki could survive on her own. Kurumi could physically, but mentally would be fucked up if Yuki died. Rii couldn't survive their deaths physically or mentally. Yuki couldn't survive physically, but would probably just put up more barriers mentally</br>  So the chances that the group meets a family member is null by now, uh?. I guess they want to keep a "lord of the flies" atmosphere with no meddling adults.  <br>She was already beginning to break before they got there. I honestly would've given her maybe a couple of weeks more, before offing herself.<br><br><br>Their parents are either shuffling around at their workplace everyday, and at their homes in the morning, or double dead from some passerby. There's always the thought that they were eaten alive, and that there's nothing left of them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no meddling adults <br>helicopter-kun probably wasn't a high schooler</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't count it out, but there's nothing gearing towards that development at this point, besides the visit to Kurumi's house.</br>   delusional happy-go-lucky <br> bashes head with a shovel <br><br>No idea who Miki and Rii could be.</br></br></br>  <br>Miki's problem was being in a closed small place. If she had a whole building she could cope, I think reading books is her form of barrier.</br>  Try two with resized image in live thread.  <br> helmet is seating <br>still, nice catch, anon.</br></br>  <br>Oh boy, now we got two</br>  <br> nice catch <br>How the fuck did you not notice that?</br></br>  <br>was rushing it, I guess. I just finished the whole thing this morning just so I could join the threads.</br>  <br>Anon, if you don't do it properly, people will just laugh at your mistakes. Now go back and properly read it.</br>  <br>I did promise to make it last thread. We'll see what gets saved then.<br><br><br>Damn it man you had me thinking I made a typo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I also read it really quickly and missed little details. I had no idea what "nibble" you guys were talking about and what do you know, Yuki was nibbling on Shovel's thigh.</br>  <br>Even when rushing, it's still pretty obvious. I also thought that the pilot was angered for some reason but the girls were just right there so it wasn't possible. And there was only one reason for him to crush a syringe. <br>People should use their brains.</br></br>  <br>Nibble!<br>I really hope this won't bite us in the future.<br>I can't stand the thought of zombie Yuki.</br></br></br>  Where do zombie outbreaks usually start at? Hospitals?  <br>Depends on the setting<br><br>If it's just a normal infection, hospitals(if it takes that long to turn, otherwise anywhere)<br>If it's some experiment, anywhere</br></br></br></br>  <br>Restaurants or hospitals, or secret labs. Usually a few infected, then it goes in the street, in a very crowded area. From this point onwards, it becomes pandemic.</br>  <br>I thought research labs were the typical starting points</br>   Every thread until it happens.   <br> Please take care or yourself <br> But I'm only taking a look <br><br>Kurumi-chan! Why didn't you stay true to your word?!</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is something mesmerizing in that smile and gaze.</br>  <br>Shovel is used goods?</br>  <br>She isn't. Anons always dramatize when a girl expresses affection or love towards a boy.</br>  <br>And she was so angry just a couple of pages before.</br>  <br>This and well mostly shitposting. All girls are good girls.<br><br>Well dunno about that dude Miki wearing a garter belt.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> Miki <br> boy <br>She makes my blood boil.</br></br></br>  <br>you're just gay.<br>go back to your trap anime.</br></br>   our own school life that no one can imitate <br>heh</br>  <br>What are Yuki and Kurumi looking at?</br>  <br> I think reading books is her form of barrier. <br><br>Reading the Stand from Steppen King while being in a zombie apocalypse, kek.<br><br>It would be cool if she kept rambling on her journal. It may be the only proof left from their existence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your dick.</br>  <br>Don't worry. She'll forget all about the bear and the fact that she was going crazy once she becomes addicted to cocks.</br>  <br> It would be cool if she kept rambling on her journal. It may be the only proof left from their existence. <br>Fuck. I can see this happening.</br></br>  <br>Can't this girl pose like a ordinary schoolgirl? Every picture of her screams "fuck me already!", like she hasn't feel a dick for months.</br>  <br>Is that meant to be a bad thing now?</br>    So why is everyone saying Yuki snapped out of the delusion?    <br>My favorite GG. She's so gorgeous and overflowing with sex appeal.</br>  <br>Did you skim through the manga too?</br>  <br> A bit<br/> I remember this part but I thought it was just another temporary lapse, brought on by her actually needing to do something.</br>  <br>She's literally not speaking about Megu-nee recently, except when Yuuri speaks about her. The roles are clearly reversed and Yuki is now playing along because she knows she must do it.</br>  <br>just sweeping it under the rug at this point</br>  <br>Even Miki is looking at her wrong.</br>  Watching Rii-san go insane is good for my dick  Nobody cared about her till she put on the hat  <br>In her case people cared for her more when she took off the hat.</br>  <br> Yuki is already old enough to smoke and play eroge </br>  <br>But if she hadn't put the hat on she wouldn't have been able to take it off</br>  I just realized how unsettling this manga can be. Imagine being a third party member unknowning of everything that has happened so far and entering the van in  . You will find a schoolgirl treating a teddybear as her little sister, another one cheerfully talking about field trips with her (ghost/dead) teacher, a former infected who won't let go of a shovel and finally someone who decided to play along to not break the group's idyllic dynamic.<br><br>And somehow, YOU are the crazy deluded one if you don't follow their little game of white lies. Or you will start thinking it is so.<br><br>Oh, and there's a zombie apocalyse. Merry fucking christmas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone fucking upload it to batoto jesus christ</br>  <br>Ruu wasn't there in that chapter yet, and the delusional one seems to be Yuuri.<br>Everything else seems normal.</br></br>    <br>I fucking love tomboys.</br>    <br>This just makes me want to dash in and pull it down just to watch her face changing from dazed confusion.</br>  <br>Theres one page where she's leaning and you can see the outline of her pussy</br>  <br>Tell me more.</br>  <br>Find it yourself m8</br>  <br>Was getting bit part of her plan?</br>  My favorite scene  <br> Didn't she get clawed? </br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>Bit.</br>  <br>You're lying to me.</br>  <br>Yes, she's training to become the zombie version of blade</br>  <br>Who cares, it's been used anyway.</br>  <br>Wait, you don't mean...<br><br>Ha ha, they're fucked. Shouldn't have thrown the Gensokyo gun.<br><br>;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gakkou's are pure, anon. Pure.</br>  <br>You can still make it in time. Go and help them before it's too late.</br>  <br>Guns are more trouble than they're worth. Throwing it away was a good decision.</br>  <br>Not Shovel</br>  <br>Does this cumslut look pure to you?</br>  <br>You know what they say, anon. When in Rome, do as the  Romans  do.</br>  <br>They would be useful if one of the girls is about to turn though</br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>But that was the reason Miki threw it away. She didn't want to encourage Kurumi's idea of zombie euthanasia and hope for the best.<br><br>daijobu daijobu daijobu</br></br></br>  <br>If she hadn't found the bear she'd probably be dead and/or bitten.</br>    <br>That's just her way of begging to have her mouth filled with cock</br>  <br>The dog too?</br>  <br>I actually thought she might've been bitten and just not told/shown the others, but if that was the case she'd have shown signs long before the end of chapter 37</br>  <br>That's a boy.</br>  <br>I'm sure dogs would enjoy having their mouths filled with cock. Until they bite it off and chew it into pieces anyhow</br>  <br>That only makes my dick harder.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure you'd fuck a zombie if you could, anon.</br>  Just finished the manga and..<br>1) Ruu-chan is alive or this is imagination Rii-san ?<br>2) I hope that Kurumi will be ok</br></br>  Miki is probably the only one that's going to make it out "okay" isn't she?   In addition to food and water, electricity is needed in our modern society. There are solar panels on the roof, two water mills connected to Wicked River, all of which are used to power the school. The Student Council sells the excess water and electricity for savings for the Conquering Dragon Festival, and the students learn naturally through their lives here how precious electricity is. <br>Why are they worried about not getting enough solar panel energy if they have water mills?<br><br>Of course. It would be pretty exciting when a single scratch could kill you</br></br></br>  <br>She will probably get a "You are the mosters, Miki" ending.</br>  Hopefully the half zombification means she doesn't age.  <br>Maintaining a mill is considerably harder. Though batteries have some shortish lifetime.</br>  <br>She gets bitten by Shovel in the end, so they can continue their relationship.</br>  <br>It's gonna be plot armor for her and the group. If they need something done and there's a horde of zombies? They'll just send Kurumi to walk by them. Of course the downfall is that she has to be extremely quiet since they still react to sound.</br>  <br>Why is it called Wicked River again? I thought there was a superstition against negative or evil names.</br>  <br>That gun would be pretty fucking useful to them right now.<br><br>Maybe the mills are down.</br></br></br>  <br> miki and shovel are the only survivors, half zombies and roaming around trying to find other people </br>  <br>They could just concentrate on maintaining one though, and it would still most likely generate more energy than the solar PV</br>  <br>With zombies crawling around? Where is the aforementioned mill in the first place? Leaving the school grounds is dangerous enough on foot.</br>  Why do all the human characters' names end in "i"?  <br>It's a mill for generating electricity, it most likely has fencing &amp; barbed wire</br>  <br>Because they are trying to keep their egos intact, therefore they must alway care their "I"'s in their mind.</br>  <br>But anon, Kurumi also ends in "i".</br>  <br> Yuki <br> Kurumi <br> Miki <br> Yuuri <br> Kei <br> Megumi <br>GOD DAMN IT.<br> Taromaru <br> Ruu </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And probably isolated which would make both entering and exiting there harder, also the must consider their resources, the school had easily accessible food.</br>  <br>Umaibo.<br><br>The fuck is an umaibo?</br></br></br>  <br>Ruu might be a nickname for Ruri or something else.  Doesn't make her any more real. </br>  <br>Mugi<br>Niggu</br></br>  This is literally the most depressing manga I've ever read and I've read The Road and The Mist. Especially when Rii snapped. She was supposed to be the onee-san for fuck's sake. Now she's the most broken.    <br>being in this thread is enough to make me feel the downs.</br>  <br>It's gap moe. You expect the nee-san archetype girl to be perfect and always dependable, but her imperfection makes her even cuter.</br>  Who are the fansubbers you know and what do you think about them?  <br>Beware of Daiz.</br>  <br>Does herkz even count as a fansubber or is he just a plain /b/ troll?</br>  <br><br>Triad?</br></br>  <br>Who is that?</br>  <br> new sheet <br> new <br><br>I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  This is a cruel, murderous, 500 year old blood lusting vampire.

You CAN learn Japanese!</br></br></br>    I just read for two hours and now im listening to stuff.<br>Is there anything else I should do? I already finished reps and all of daily routine.</br>  <br>Start actually learning Japanese.</br>  Is being White a disadvantage in Japan?<br>I assume it's like the west where all the cultural enrichment is mostly contained in the big cities.<br>But I don't like big cities.</br></br>  Guys I'm obsessed with meeting a woman old enough to be my mom and becoming a ひも. <br><br><br>Disadvantaged in what? If you're looking to meet pretty young women it's a huge advantage. If you're trying to find an apartment or start a business you might be at a disadvantage.</br></br></br>  Someone posted this in the previous thread. Does anyone know where it's from?  <br>Yes. The Japanese are incredibly racist, and they purposefully ostracize anyone whom they believe may be a foreigner. Being white in Japan is to be oppressed, and the Japanese are oppressors.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br>  For those of you that learned Japanese for a manga/LN/VN/anime, did you immediately jump into it after finishing Tae Kim and Core2k or did you start with other materials until you felt you could read fluidly?  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/view/bizq3<wbr>79k4oeig2d/fora.pdf<br><br>Here you go my freund.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>ありがとうございました!</br>  <br>Started reading Yotsuba and playing Wizardry Summoner with 500 words into 2k, before finishing tae kim, didn't have much problems with them. <br>Problems with the language, I mean, Wizardry is hard as fuck to beat.<br><br>I don't see how it's even possible to become able to read fluidly without spending some time reading first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this how it feels to be a nigger going to Europe?</br>  <br>I haven't finished reading Tae Kim and I'm only about 700 cards into my anki deck yet I'm slowly reading an  otome game . Reading at this low level can become time-consuming for sure. There's plenty of vocab I don't know but I think the real frustrating part is my lack of grammar knowledge. I don't believe in waiting to read though. Even if it's only a little bit of reading a day, seeing kanji and vocab outside of anki does better for my memory than spending an additional hour with it.</br>  みんな、突然だけど<br>うんこが出たんだぞ</br>  <br>乙</br>  <br>How many lines are you reading a day?</br>  <br>This is what we call true shitto posutingu</br>  What does エッチそうだと噂されている mean when talking about a person?  Is it a good idea to learn Japanese in university? Anyone of you guys have a Japanese class?  <br><br>The prevailing opinion is that they go far too slow</br></br>  <br> From what I'm hearing, he seems like a perverted individual </br>  <br>Learning in class usually goes at the same pace the stupidest/laziest person can go, so unless the stupidest student is you it's a bad idea.</br>  <br>I was looking at some of the modules in a University near me and what they teach in a full semester you could learn much quicker by yourself. Advantage is having a wide variety of people to practice with and lots of feedback though.</br>  <br>What people have already said plus the fact that first semester Japanese classes are full of insufferable weeaboos.</br>  <br> what they teach in a full semester you could learn much quicker by yourself <br> quicker by yourself <br>That is, if you're motivated enough.<br><br>You can learn all you want by yourself, but you need to means of retaining what is self-taught.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to add to this question<br><br>I've been studying for a year and once I get my two year would majoring in Japanese be a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>It's inconsistent, but usually between 50 and 200 lines. I space them throughout the day because otherwise it quickly becomes mentally exhausting.</br>  <br>What are you talking about?<br>How are the means to retain something that was self taught different than the means to retain something taught in class?</br></br>  Holy fuck VNR is a piece of shit. Why can't ITH hook light games?  <br> 200 lines <br>That's nothing. Do you look up every unfamiliar word or something? Consider reading manga with furigana until you know enough kanji to read VNs without constantly looking shit up, improves reading without putting much strain on you.</br></br>  <br>Is majoring in drama a good idea?</br>  <br>Its a good way to start off or for getting some practice with speaking/writing. If you need language credits or electives then it might be a good idea since its time you can dedicate to learning Japanese instead of some other thing. The pace will mostly depend on how many class hours there are in a week.</br>  <br>Not him, but is reading something  super interesting with furigana like To Love-Ru  as a first manga a good idea? Or are there any simple manga that don't have much slang/abbreviations?</br>  <br>Every manga has slang/abbreviations but there really aren't that many of them and they are pretty intuitive if you know your Tae Kim.</br>  <br>It isn't even the kanji. There are probably two per line on average that I don't recognize. When I don't recognize them, image recognition can pull them up in a second. What I struggle with wrapping my head around is grammar. <br><br>Thanks, though. I will take your advice and read some manga for the next few days and see if that suits me better.</br></br></br>  <br>Good idea for what? <br>If you expect your major to impress 3DPD girls, make your parents proud and make you rich then nope.<br><br><br>Most shonen jump manga is pretty simple, but people recommend よつばと！as a first for a reason.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What I struggle with wrapping my head around is grammar.  <br>Are you struggling with understanding the meaning of sentences? Or just understanding why X structure was used and other more detailed things?<br><br>Because if it's the latter, you should really just loosen up and focus on reading more. Nothing good will come from spending hours trying to figure out why the moe girl sticks なのよねです at the end of every sentences.</br></br></br></br>  is there any hope for people who read 3 lines a day?  <br>No.</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br>It's a little of both. I said earlier that I haven't finished reading Tae Kim and I know that's a big part of why I struggle with grammar. However, I don't feel like I'm doing enough if I don't read a little. I don't think I'll reap any real benefits by speed-reading Tae Kim and I already know what my anki limits are, so after I've met my daily goals for those I feel like I should be doing something else.</br>  <br>The university near me teaches Genki practically throughout the whole Japanese course.</br>  <br>You can try to hope that reincarnation exists and you'll be reborn as a Japanese girl in your next life. But even then you'll have to read more than 3 lines a day as a Japanese girl.</br>  N5 - beginner<br>N4 - intermediate<br>N3 - advanced, but not quite fluent<br>N2 - fluent<br>N1 - beyond fluent</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only hope is that you stop being someone who reads 3 lines a day.</br>  Where do I go download raws for manga that aren't in the CoR?<br>I assume there isn't any big site that hosts everything like we have for translations</br>  <br>how many should i read then?</br>  <br><br>Uh... N1 is more like "almost fluent." So your whole chart is fucked up.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>I've passed N1 years ago, learned a lot since then, and I don't consider myself anywhere near fluent.</br></br>  <br>Even anime have more than 200 lines</br>  Are there situations where the imperfective forms of verbs are used like nouns?  <br>That's because you learned autistically and didn't talk to anyone. Normal people are fluent by the time they reach N2</br>  <br><br>Nyaa? http://raw-zip.com/? http://raw.senmanga.com/? Just google whatever you're looking for and see what you can find.</br></br>  <br>so should i just read 200 lines per day?</br>  <br><br>Just stop. Even the JLPT considers N1 "near fluent."</br></br>  <br> Even the JLPT considers N1 "near fluent." <br>Just making stuff up now, eh?</br></br>  <br>I guess if you could actually speak at N1 level you could consider yourself somewhat fluent. Of course just passing the test means nothing.<br>N2 is a joke though.</br></br>  <br>Did that guy post that here?<br>What a dumbass.</br></br>  <br><br>How's the weather on Mt. Stupid? <br><br>Must be nice this time of year. Although the weather's always nice when you're 2 months into learning Japanese, since it's always summer at that point.<br><br><br><br>No, sadly. But a guy from /djt/ who frequents /m/ was kind enough to post it here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  only 6.5 of us will actually learn Japanese  <br>Good. Last thing i would want is japanese getting mainstream.</br>  how do i stop worrying about everything in a sentence and feel it?    <br><br>Actually learn Japanese instead of just learning vocab on anki.</br></br>    <br>why?<br><br><br>but i only learned all grammar though</br></br></br></br>  <br>Try doing more Anki then. That's probably the best way to get better at reading.</br>  <br>Don't bother to understand everything.</br>  Question, does 私が彼女じゃダメ mean "Aren't I your girlfriend?" or "I can't be your girlfriend?" or "You don't want me as your girlfriend?"  <br>You shouldn't count the fucking lines in the first place. <br>If you can't enjoy reading things in Japanese there's no hope for you.</br></br>  <br>You responded to me saying the same thing in the beginning of the thread.<br><br>Why are you spreading misinfo?</br></br></br>  <br>Japanese is a very mainstream and easy language, how do you think there are so many translators we have pretty much every anime available in English via fansub?</br>  <br>they're all half Japanese</br>  <br><br>I don't know what you're talking about.

He's fluent in his native tongue.<br><br>Consider an immigrant who runs a cash register and goes to the bar with friends after work, and is able to handle day-to-day conversations no problem, but has a lot of trouble with movies. He's fluent, too.<br><br>Fluency isn't the point where you're on par with an educated adult. It's the point where you can express yourself in a conversation freely and coherently. This means that if you don't know the word, you can still describe the concept, or understand the concept when it's described to you.<br><br>6K words is probably just about the breaking point, assuming that they're the right 6K.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes. What most people refer to as "fluency" is actually called "proficiency".</br>  <br>Get lazy. Looking shit up is such a pain I never do it, unless I see an unfamiliar kanji.</br>  <br> That poster gave you very good advice, how about you listen to it? <br>Not him but how? This  is so vague that it's no different than shitposting, it's not an advice or at least a good one.</br></br>  Can someone spoon feed me and hold my hand? maybe wipe my ass too?  <br><br> maybe wipe my ass too? <br><br>only if you're a girl</br></br></br></br>   below 50% retention on learning cards <br>Help.</br>  <br>Side note: People generally don't say "an advice", though it's valid in some dialects.

I tried to watch something, but it was regionlocked. How do I get around it?  <br>Did you got rused into "learning kanji from vocab", too?</br>  <br><br>The "r" is the same throughout all English peoples. What are you even on about, ESL?</br></br>  <br>I didn't mean that only americans pronounce that way. Just that UK and its colonies are very irrelevant.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>This guide is a god-send. <br><br>It clarifies what Tae Kim skips in simple terms without having you search for years through imabi or the DoJG</br></br></br>  <br> There's only one sound we don't make and that's ふ <br>I always felt like ふ was pretty much the same as the ph in sphere, at least for me.</br></br>  <br> The "r" is the same throughout all English peoples. <br>Nope. Scots are anglo as well and use flaps and trills in addition to the approximant. There's also variation in which approximant it is (retroflex vs alveolar vs postalveolar).</br></br>  <br><br>They speak that way because of their Scottish accent. If you've ever heard Scottish Gaelic, you'd know they roll their Rs.<br><br>Also, fuck your bullshit. You know damn well Rs are the same in Australia as they are in New Hampshire, you're just being a retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically speaking, we don't make し, ち, and じ either. Linguistically, they are a different type of sh, ch, j than English's.</br>  <br> You know damn well Rs are the same in Australia as they are in New Hampshire, you're just being a retard. <br>The new hampshire accent doesn't labialize, so no, they're not the same.</br></br>  <br>I never said to outright skip things, just don't waste time looking things up. Infer parts you didn't get from context.</br>  <br>but what if youre wrong? and you miss out on something really important/cool?</br>  Guys, what does もっと知識を身につけていずれは... mean?  <br>You need to fail in order to learn.</br>  <br> but what if youre wrong? <br>Then you're wrong. Happens all the time and doesn't matter much.<br> and you miss out on something really important/cool? <br>That is very unlikely, especially with manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what kind of shitty advice is that? I need to not understand to understand? im just reinforcing bad habits</br>  <br>He just said to learn from your mistakes.</br>  <br> im just reinforcing bad habits <br>Yeah, just like when you were a kid and never understood what people were saying, right?<br><br>(no)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea it is really useful.</br>  <br><br> the "this is how kids learn" bullshit <br><br>So, five years to be on par with a five year old, and 12-15 years to reach an adolescent's ability with the language? Sounds great.<br><br>Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. Piggy piggy ohio arimas.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you are that good like the imabi guy why would you feel intimidated at all?</br>  <br> Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. Piggy piggy ohio arimas. <br><br>Then you're not going to get any bad habits that a kid doesn't get either.<br><br>Matter of fact is that looking up everything you don't understand is going to waste time. It's more effective to continue and only acquire the things you barely understand (as opposed to not understand at all). There's no harm in studying grammar separately, but looking up things you don't understand while you're reading cuts into your reading time, and consuming things that you barely understand is how language learning works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh wait, your mind isn't as malleable as a kid's anymore. <br>Yeah, it's even better because kids are dumb, lack experience and can't read.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh my, piggy jiggy jig.</br></br>  <br>Actually, language is acquired by consuming things that you pretty much understand. There can only be a few missing parts; otherwise, you can't infer anything, and it might as well be gibberish, so if there's too little content for you to be able to infer, then you've got to be looking things up.</br>  <br><br>What the other anon said.<br><br>In your native tongue, you've been building up massive amounts of knowledge and intuition since you came out of the womb. That's why you don't need a dictionary for those ten words in the novel that you don't recognize. You know enough about the language already to fully understand from context.<br><br>Hell, even in your own language, if you're entering something completely unfamiliar (for example, a scientific study in a field that you know nothing about), you might need a dictionary open if you don't want the author's writings to be half gibberish.<br><br>Until you've gained this knowledge base that enables intuition in the language for Japanese, it's stupid to not look up each and every word that you don't know.<br><br>Thankfully, we have plenty of tools that make looking up Japanese words pretty easy. Text hookers, rikai, kanjitomo, etc. And failing that, we still have traditional dictionaries and means to draw the kanji or search by radical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Droidfags do you use the hiragana numpad or the QWERTY keyboard?  <br> In your native tongue, you've been building up massive amounts of knowledge and intuition since you came out of the womb. <br>That intuition doesn't just vanish when you read something in another language, though, and you can use most of it to figure things out. Of course with Japanese things are a bit harder and you have to know your kanji, but once you know them you need a dictionary even less since they give you even more hints about the meaning of the word. <br>If you just look up every unfamiliar word you encounter you wouldn't get much reading, and forget most of the words you looked up right away.</br></br></br>  I was doing RTK, and I got to 説, which Heisig marked as "explanation". But the anki deck I'm using shows 釈 as "explanation. I checked and 釈 does mean explanation, and 説 means opinon/theoryrumor. Heisig calls 釈 "interpretation" later in the book. <br>Should study the definitions as they are in RTK or should I change something?</br>  <br>That's why you should drop Heisig earlier on.</br>    <br> stories are worthless shit <br> only teaches you the meaning, not even how to fucking read the kanji <br> and the meanings are wrong <br> mfw people actually went through the entirety of this book <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should study the definitions as they are in RTK or should I change something? <br>The goal is learning the idea behind the kanji, not the english word that represents that idea.<br>It's easier to tie meanings to readings, though, shame RTK doesn't do that,</br></br></br>    <br> definitions <br> in RTK <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>But meanings don't tie to readings, radicals do.</br>  <br> But meanings don't tie to readings <br>Who said that? In my head I can tie whatever the fuck I want.</br></br>  <br>Explanation can be a valid idea/meaning associated with 説. See 説明</br>  <br><br>Look up some of the words they are in to get a feel for them. 解説 and 解釈 might be good since they share a Kanji. 説明 and 演説 are also key words. That said if you don't know those Kanji/words this gets a hell of a lot harder, which I don't really have a solution for. It's hellish at the start.<br><br>The closest to explain I can think of for 釈 is 釈明. Much like "explain how this works" and "explain your conduct", they're different kinds of "explain".<br><br>Sorry if I get anything wrong/seem like I'm just dumping shit on you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's unnatural as helll but if it helps you remember the kanji, be my guest.</br>  <br><br>Sure, it does transfer to some degree. You don't lose all human communication skills. That's probably around half of why you learn so much quicker as an adult.<br><br>However, a large piece of this intuition comes from a deep understanding of the grammar and knowing all of the nuances of each of the other words around the unknown word. When you first begin studying a new language, the language will be in a haze.<br><br> Huh? That doesn't match what I was expecting at all. <br> What is this even supposed to be? <br> Did I just understand that right? <br> Is this a slurring of a word that I don't know? <br> Is this some kind of weird phrase? <br><br>Your knowledge of human communication gets the cogs turning, but it's not enough to compensate for a poor base in the hard skills (such as vocabulary) of the language. This haze continues to exist for a long time.<br><br>Looking up the words makes it exponentially quicker to grasp vocabulary. The sooner you get your vocabulary up to snuff, the sooner you can make it easier to access, and subsequently, the sooner you can remove this haze in more cases than not. This goes double if you're at a point where looking things up would slow you down significantly.<br><br>Also, you mentioned kids learning the language earlier. Do you honestly not remember the days of "What's a 'radio mast', dad?", "What's an 'ICU'?", "What's a 'manhole'?" Also, have you never seen kids ask such questions? Kids are also always looking to greater sources of knowledge to explain the language to them. Actually, this behavior doesn't even completely stop as adults, as in the example of science studies that I mentioned before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 釈明 <br>"justify", "vindicate", "elucidate"</br></br>  <br><br> 釈明 <br>"(an) explanation", "(an) apology (わび)", (a) vindication (弁明)"<br><br>Well, yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  I understand the conversation but I'm having trouble figuring out what the 帰ろっか、てくー、and ないっけー　are doing in this panel.

Do people really believe it takes even 3000 hours to reach N1, let alone, 8000?

Kanji are equivalent to those parts.<br><br>But it's not worth learning what 20 different bound stems mean every day, especially because they mean slightly different things depending on context and have different semantic properties.<br><br>So, when you see a word that's made of one kanji, you memorize the word.

If you see 英国国教会, you don't memorize 英国国教会, you memorize "英国 = britain" "国 = country" "教会 = church" "英国＋国＋教会 = &lt;britain&gt; &lt;national&gt; &lt;church&gt;"</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>The US government uses intensive combination-teaching-method teaching programs in the context of those values.</br>  <br>Are there any cases where kanji are used purely for their phonetic value, or where one unanalyzable word is written with multiple kanji?</br>  <br>At first I read this as<br> intensive combat-teaching-methods <br>which might be really effective.</br></br></br>  <br>  According to the US government reaching fluency (which is more than N1, obviously) in Japanese requires about 2400 hours of study <br><br>No, it is not more than N1. Despite the original post being a troll, this post  is correct. Most people who go to Japan are fluent long before they are N1, often before they are N2.

A good reader knows his particles, will have a decent amount of active vocabulary, and will be able to recall his relatively impressive library of passive vocabulary with a bit of patience.

I've been attempting to learn Japanese but have ran into a bit of a stickler. I'm running through the 6k but it seems that I'm starting to get everything confused with other things and some things just aren't sticking. Because of this, I tried to begin reading but found it almost impossible to progress at all. Has anyone ran into this block? Do I just tread through it and hope I brute force them into memory (possibly lowering my words per day (I only do 20))? Any alternatives as a break to anki besides reading? Or should I go through reading even though it seems like it's too early?  <br>pretty normal I think.<br>If you're mixing up kanji though you could try learning how to write them, which would force you to notice finer details that separate similar kanji from each other</br></br>  <br>Consider learning the radicals, there are only like 200 of em' and it makes it pretty easy to put kanji together.<br><br>Also as for reading, it will always be tough in the beginning since even if you know the words/grammar you will probably be looking every time up to double make sure and getting disappointed when you don't recognize a word you've done a 100 times on anki.<br><br>You'll get over looking up every little thing or getting stressed on every single grammar point and more importantly you will probably recognize 95% of the words/grammar that you can probably just infer and if not it is not a big deal to look up one word.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>have you started on learning grammar? When I get stuck on flashcards I find it helps to take a break and focus on something different. Also learning the radicals and writing things out helps a lot.</br>  日本人にプライドは無い、製作能力と予算を大量に消費するレースに参加する<wbr>度胸など無い、あと他人のネタをパックって逃げるだけのバカなら日本にも掃<wbr>いて捨てるほどいる、寄付とパクリの区別は日本人が一番解かってないんだ、<wbr>パクリや盗みは未成年者にさせるから有罪にできない</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br><br>Thanks, I actually haven't been writing them; I will start with the radicals I suppose!

Unless you're into that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not really. That's why I've put it off until now because I don't feel there would ever be a time I'd write anything. That's a bridge I'd like to cross after at least being comfortable with comprehension, speaking, and reading.

People need to make sure they're not anxious, just at worst bored.</br>  <br>Does anybody know how many unique kanji are in the Core10k deck? I've been able to find the spreadsheet for the Core6k deck but the data used for the Core10k deck is behind a permission wall. <br><br>If anyone has the 10k deck would you mind exporting the deck to plain text and uploading it somewhere? The data is all I'm after. Not able to download the anki deck in the core- stuck on mobile connection/credit.</br></br></br>  <br>There's also graduate-level schools, for example Law schools. I know a Chinese major who went on to get a JD</br>  <br> this entire sentence <br>内容が意味不なのはともかく、句読点のつけ方がひどい。</br></br>  <br> 意味不 <br>Did you mean 無意味？</br></br>  <br>A slang for 意味不明</br>  <br>Slang or mistake?</br>  <br>Go look up by yourself<br>https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E6%84%<wbr>8F%E5%91%B3%E4%B8%8D</wbr></br></br>  <br>I'm asking if you meant that or added it after the fact, not whether if people use this abbreviation colloquially.</br>  <br>But the whole point of RTK is to reduce the amount of grinding and repetition. Seems strange to grind or repeat it. Maybe it just doesn't work for you, or maybe you're not doing it right, but either way, RTK doesn't provide enough benefit to warrant studying it three times. Just imo.</br>  <br>I used 意味不 intentionally to mean 意味不明.</br>  <br>You could try not doing RTK and just grinding Kanji with a jouyou deck.<br><br>I dropped RTK after 5 months and 800 Kanji, then I made the same progress in a bit more than two months just by grinding Kanji without any mnemonics. I'd give it a try if I were you.</br></br></br>  <br>If you say so.</br>  This is a sentence from the dojg with their translation under it.<br><br>英語を教えてあげたかわりに日本語を教えてもらった<br>I taught him Japanese, so (to make up for it) he taught me English<br><br>Isn't this backwards?

They should crank it up and make N6 and N7 so the really gifted Japanese learners don't get bored.</br></br>  <br>Alright thanks, I was checking the other examples and noticed whoever did it mixed up the positions of 英語 and 日本語. This was the first mistake I've noticed so far besides various spelling/typing errors in the dojg pdf.</br>  <br>I see, your interpretations is correct, just so you know.</br>  <br>N1 is the most difficult one you know...</br>  <br>Everything up to around the first 150 odd pages of the Intermediate section of that pdf has been checked for errors. If you find any errors within this checked region you should post them on the feedback section of the DJT website or something, otherwise they probably won't be noticed by corkun.<br><br>The other thread he said he was going to start working on fixing the rest of it after reaching a point in a kanji deck he is apparently working on.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure it seems that way when you're just beginning</br>  <br>What are you talking about?</br>  <br>Stop shitposting.</br>      some people can't even learn how to look things up or double check stuff how will they ever learn Japanese  Kino is staying in your town for three days and asks you for a tour. What do you show her  and how do you win her heart ?  <br>I show her what little to show there is in my backwater town like the gas station. Probably take her on a walk/hike along one of the trails in the area.<br> Fail because I'm bad at that shit. I'd offer to go with her but I don't own a bike and she won't ride double and I'm not great at survival skills. Cry forever. </br></br>  I'd steal her bike.  <br>I'd show her little there is to see at the town I'm stationed at. We could explore this place together, acting as her tour guide. Try to help her spend time, then confess on the final day to get my feelings off my chest.  I'd get rejected, but at least she knows how I feel about her. </br>  <br>I'd focus on feeding her up and confess to her on the second night so we could spend the third day fucking or parting amiably (more likely).</br>  <br>The answer is always the same.<br> DRUG AND RAPE </br></br>  <br>   DRUG AND RAPE <br>That could probably work, but the minute she wakes up/comes out of it, she's gonna murder you. Can't break an indomitable will as her's either, at least without attempting to do so for a long, long period of time; even then that's a big "if."<br><br>Would it really be worth it to put your dick in Kino's undersized, tight butt at the cost of having it get sliced off right before you cum?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously I would restrain her and apply   magical aphrodisiac   or just   blackmail her using Hermes close death body </br>  <br>I live in a verdy nice town in France, with great architecture and delicious food. There'd be plenty for us to see. She travels around the world, learning about the story of every place she visits, so she would probably be interesting in what a history nerd like me could tell her. <br><br>The hard part would be winning her heart. My best guess would be something involving warm hugs, and climbing on top of the cathedral, and romantically enjoying the view. Maybe having her stay at my place, offer her to share my bed in a non-sexual way, and then try to make things take a precisely sexual way. <br><br>But having Kino leave after only three days would be hard. <br><br>Isn't the quiet life of virgin better than having such a cute tomboy leave you, while knwoing you'll never see her again ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Display some sort of acute psychological/philosophical problem, that she observes for a few days, and then gives me some sort of new view on before she leaves.<br><br>I sell her some food and bullets, and never see her again. <br><br>I'd also show her the retarded tramp that dresses in a ballerina outfit that lives at the bus station.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Isn't the quiet life of virgin better than having such a cute tomboy leave you, while knwoing you'll never see her again ? <br><br>Better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all.</br></br></br>  <br>A crazy bastard once said when asked to marry,<br> For a young man, not yet; for an old man, not at all. <br>Of course, this is the same bastard that basically told Alexander the Great to fuck off.<br> you will never sit around a campfire in the middle of a warm summer night with Kino saying not a word, letting the silence between the two of you speak volumes for the deep amount of love you have for one another </br></br></br></br>  <br>For all the good of knowing the saying, many won't act because their heart or nerves tell them otherwise. I think I would just try and have no strings attached sex with Kino using protection.</br>  Kino is a girl!  <br>I'd totally be down with a one-night stand with Kino. It'd hurt to see her leave and never come back, but it's better to have her be free than to have her trapped in a place she did not want to be in.</br>  How did she become so lewd?

It's pretty crazy. At least one of them has to have a ton of QUALITY or something.<br>I just wonder how their workers are doing. I know Japanese animation is known for terrible working conditions, but 7 shows at once? Jesus man that's practically slave labor.</br></br>  <br>They seem more competent to me than Diomedea</br>  <br>Trying to watch this only because of the director.</br>  <br>They're not all standard magical academy harems.

Thanks for confirming you haven't read it though and is just out to shitpost.</br>  <br>I don't think that's what he meant.<br>I think he means that that shit doesn't get received well in Japan because 'muh pure waifu'.<br>So it's probably going to flop.</br></br></br>  <br>I believe SAO sold.</br>  <br> That already kiss and hold hands frequently and have already agreed to get married. <br><br>The problem is you make it sound like this is something new and different, which is not.</br></br></br>  WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED?  <br>Guy playing his strong suits, huh?</br>  <br>This makes me extremely angry because it will change YOUR favourite manga into K-On levels of moeshit as well.
