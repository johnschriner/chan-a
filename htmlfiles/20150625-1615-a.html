[ Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  The 80's were a different time  Because Araki likes to spice things up every now and a gain   Because your gender prejudice is too strong.      But Part 5 was serialized between '95 and '99.   Forget looking like girls, almost everyone has that same fucking face and build.  Fuck Araki, he sold his drawing talent in exchange for eternal youth.    I think he means the chronology   Early part 5 is arguably the worst art   really the biggest art change happened in Part 4    But mid part 4 was arguably the best    It's set in the 2000s    The worst is fucking 6. I cant believe this isn't general consensus.     There is literally no one in that image that I don't want to fuck in the vagina, wtf?!    To be fair that's entirely possible - he'd been trying to go with a female main protagonist since part 2 but his editors kept cockblocking him so he went "fuck it!" and just made them all reverse traps.  That and part 5 marked the point when he seemed to go more towards fashion models as body shape inspiration.            well, late 4 and early 5.     How is Bruno even standing like this? Are his feet glued to the ground?       But mid part 4 was arguably the best  that doesn't mean that the art didn't change.     I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  I want to ravage Narancia's boy pussy   I dunno.     Heyzeus's legs help him     I don't think the early 4 panel is representative.    Narcinia is best girl    Late 6 looks like shit, especially Jolyne that looks like a tranny.    The other thread got deleted it seems and there was some decent discussion in it too. Just don't name threads "edition" or "general" anymore, hopefully that will take the heat off.       sounds like the work of a moderator's stand     Are mods really deleting JoJo generals? Fucking finally.   A crack down on generals would severely increase the quality of the board.       What is 「GRAVITY」? Green baby don't hurt me     I thought they were purging them because there are usually multiple up at a time.   While the threads were fun there's nothing to talk about until JJL chapters/EoH trailer/general announcements of a Jojo nature. If jojofags really need a thread at the most have one weekly.  Why didn't Kira just use Sheer Heart Attack in the mansion instead on relying on slow ass air bubbles?   The one holding the knife is actually a girl... right?    A new chapter did just come out and we've actually had some unusually in-depth discussion about it over the last few days despite not even having a text translation yet. I understand why they'd want to get rid of generals but I think it's a real shame it happens just when all the cancer DIO's World brought in is finally clearing up.   That're some manly girls.   /ag/ when?    Nope    Because Araki just forgot.    Apparently the /a/ sings Jojo is going to be starting soon, someone said last thread that Jebus was going to pick it up. We should just stick to those threads.     Never.     Late part 7 is my favourite.    /r/ing an edit with them in the Gangstars' outfits and/or faces.    Early Part 3 was the best.     Because he knew they were aware of how it worked and he can only use one type of bomb at the time.     But Josuke couldn't do anything against it anyway,only Koichi could.   Araki got tired of drawing manly homos so he switched to twink homos.    He could divert it long enough to punch barrage Kira to death if he set something on fire.     Josuke could just punch it and it'd go back to Kira as his hand.    Early and Mid Part 7 was awesome, Araki started to suffer from his sameface syndrome around Late Part 7 and he has never stopped since then.    If he used Crazy Diamond's healing ability, it would go back to his left hand. Also, then he wouldn't be able to do anything offensively in that time period.    Actually at this point there's more variety than there was during either late 7 or the scratch nose era.   can anyone give me name of a music that is played during almost entire the world part from anime?   Darkness of the world i think.    Araki went through a David Bowie phase while writing part 5.     Araki had just learned to draw different faces around mid part 4 only to revert back to his sameface style in the next volume   Truly sad.  I think he hasn't found an equilibrium yet.        He got sick of people comparing his characters and artwork to Hokuto no Ken so instead of manly characters he went the opposite route and made them FABULOUS instead.    i love you     It's more like he didn't have to imitate HnK and buff 80's action stars once they went out of fashion and he became established enough to do his own thing when part 3 ended.     Didn't he lose it with his left hand?    It might just be my fetish for white hair talking, but I don't blame the Japs for liking Fugo as much as they do just because of his design.    I guess that worked out for him because that's what people prefer for him now, I mean fuck look at all the shit he's done since adapting that style.   NEWS ALERT-Actual Discussion approaching  http://jjlscans.tumblr.com/post/122<wbr>355928463/jojolion-44-delay   This month’s chapter is taking awhile because the store is slow to stock this issue and our Day 1 contact is hard to get in touch with this week.    Expect the chapter sometime really soon    Edited for brevity.       </wbr>     Fuck you.    No fuck you leatherman!    I liked the muscle bound style before part 4. Then everyone including Jotaro and Polnareff turned into fruit boys. There's manly fabulous and then there's faggot fabulous.    Both are acceptable as long as the source material is enjoyable. Like LotGH for example. Full of fruit boys, but still a great piece of work.     Early part 1 will always be objectively the worst.      it took me a while but damn.  J♂J♂     How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        I need the pastebin guys    I totally agree with you, Mid Part 4 is beautiful.     calling Jotaro JoJo     In terms of story and characters the first 3 parts were the best, series went to shit after he was forced to make it more mainstream     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     DIO's♂DARK♂FANTASY    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     Jotaro could move for 2 seconds within DIO's time stop   DIO can stop time for 9 seconds (as High DIO)   Jotaro stops time at the 9 second mark   DIO can move for two more seconds (now 11 seconds)   DIO can't move anymore         The youngest JoJo is the relevant JoJo     Implying   tfw Araki will never ever make women as beautiful as in Phantom Blood.      DIO seemingly crushed Jotaro to death before the 11 second mark    Because Araki is a massive faglord, but a cool faglord.    Those are 12 year olds.    I know. It's ridiculous but you just have to go with it. Araki is known for drawing things happening and then having a character say it didn't happen.  Wheel of Fortune burning Jotaro for example and then just saying it was his coat.       not colouring the painting on the wall  lazy colour job      Implying  He started excelling with females at part 4     I love how Araki used to draw women, even before Jojo. Gorgeous Irene is really  gorgeous.     The anatomy's kind of crap but the faces are truly gorgeous. So expressive.      So since they found it necessary to notify us this time I'm assuming we might not even get it this month.  Shit happens and all that and I do appreciate that we get scanlations at all, but I just really want to discuss Karera and Josefumi with you guys.      Looks like early part 1.     Fugo is not blonde  Welp.     Nobody here know enough japanese to translate it?    Yeah, Gorgeous Irene is really wild.    They said to expect it really soon, I don't think that there's anything strange about them giving us an explanation for being a few days late.    It is.    I like it, looks original. I do like Part 8 art a lot but, the sameface is kind of annoying sometimes.     Can someone explain what they're even wearing?    Clothes.    Now here's Gorgeous Irene with the Steel Ball Run art style.    I fucking hate it, how did Araki lose the ability to draw expressions on people's faces?.  Look at this Gyro from mid Part 7       He started diversifying after Paper Moon King, I think it's a telltale sign that he became aware of it.      Now look at this one from Late Part 7, that expression on his face it's terrible, it doesn't look sexy, or intimidating, nothing.     I'll give you late 7 and very early 8 but here's plenty of expression now. Our main character this time is the kind of guy who doesn't show his emotions much to the people who normally surround him, but look at the others around him.      He looks like Iggy before having a human face   Oh God. People really shouldn't be trying this early to guess the designs.  How long do we have to wait an announcement of Part 4 anime?  Like a month ago someone told me to do the phonetically matched lyrics for Jonathan's Ballad. So, uh, here it is I guess.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RwN<wbr>jSwZD8e8</wbr>  [ ]     Awful.    Jojolion Volume 10. We first saw the Iggy promo on a flyer from the Volume.    Please don't use Casca as a reaction image, it'll make me feel bad for fapping to her getting raped.  I wish she enjoyed it as much as I did.    Gyro SAS announced.   I'm pretty curious to see how he'd draw him now. Karera gets a lot of really good panels in this month's chapter and her thick eyebrows reminded me of her a bit.    That's pretty nice, i love the song and Jonathan.    Damn, that's fucking nice, It makes me really appreciate Johnathan.    As dorky as it is to say, I understand why the guy yesterday said Jonathan was his favorite Jojo now.    Jonathan has always been my favorite Jojo     tfw we'll never get an OVA/HFTF The World    This should have played when Jotaro kill DIO.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yqt<wbr>JqKgemw4</wbr>  [ ]     Making the video was such a treat for myself as well because Jonathan is also my favorite JoJo.     No Diego SAS   No Shadow DIO SAS   You'll never have 5 different Dio SAS figures        Jonathan is the kindest and most gentle JoJo in the entire series. He's Kenshiro if he wasn't so stoic.    Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?   I would let Diego fuck my ass<br/>     Where is the Pucci SAS, and the Whitesnake     Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?  That's like an anon if they breathe air.      no diego  it hurts.    At some point he played so much with the clothes that forgot the faces.   They did say they were doing more villain part 5 SAS then they'll move on to 7. Have hope anon.      Can't unsee young Dio      Italian civilian clothing To blend in     YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DIO? NO, IT WAS I, IRINE.     No, this is Dio.     Purest Jojo didn't deserve that fate   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DMj<wbr>hY98bf-g</wbr>  [ ]  I love DIO's adventures as a nun under a bridge in Japan.    Ｓｉｍｐｌｅ Ｓｕｂｊｅｃｔｓ Ｓｗｉｎｄｌｅｄ Ｓｗｉｆｔｌｙ ｆｏｒ Ｓｈｅｋｅｌｓ...  ...「ｓ4ｓ」     You lost. Now leave.    Far more HnK than JJBA.    This is the only good JJBA AMV I've ever seen in my life, and i'm not crying.    I wasn't trying, that was just the best image I have of [s4s]-tan    And to think I was just going to but the lyrics on a black screen to avoid being grouped in with the AMV crowd.    Araki can just recreate the late part 3/mid part 4 look can't he. If so, why doesn't he do that whenever he redraws characters from old parts. Jonathan looks like a downie in all the recent drawings. The Kenshiro look suited him.   J♂J♂'s Bizzare L♂cker R♂♂m    Because he can't recreate them.    what is the fastest stand? besides Made in Heaven of course   I heard he could. He said that in the J♂j♂nium volumes. He prefers the faggot statue of david sameface art.    possibly silver chariot without armor     Mind to post a link?   Weather Report when?      SUTAR PURACHIMA    Possibly. Even with armor, it matched Star Platinum in speed.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1XT<wbr>gcfwi_L8</wbr>  [ ] Did Kakyoin and Dio engage in homosex in Egypt, other than the fisting?     Fall♂off♂your♂horse    Now I want to reread/rewatch Phantom Blood. People seem to forget about how interesting it is because of the other parts, myself included.    they look the fucking same    DIO was his first friend.    He doesn't care how any old character looks after their part has ended and they'll never appear in the manga again. Check this out, it's from part 4's time.   He also doesn't care much for Jonathan. Back when he made his top 10 he was the only Jojo not on it.      Ah. Right there. Right there was the start of the downward spiral into sameface and scratched n♂ses.      Dio knew Kakyoin better than any of his other "friends" did       Still no C-moon.   ;-;   Spiral staircase.      No, that was always the way it was with old characters. Part 3 style Ikuro and Part 3 style young Joseph were just Jotaros, and Joseph and Jonathan looked the same a lot of the time to begin with.    what was that stand that moved through electricity? that may be the fasted     No C-Moon   No MiH      You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan. I'd say it was part 3 that it became difficult to tell between the faces. Especially between Kekyoin and J♂tar♂.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-B<wbr>Bt29m0I8</wbr>  [ ]   Kakyoin had a longer mouth and thinner eyebrows. He also didn't had a more colder facial expression rather than that eternally pissed look that Jotaro always had.    they specifically state that it's useless against josuke     You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan  You couldn't even tell between Dio and Caesar     It doesn't really fit.   Can Yotsuba beat Jotaro?   Yes.   Well, now that the season is over I'm gonna probably start reading part 7, but I'd still like something to watch. Do you fellas have any recommendations for some fun, silly shonen like JoJo?   hokuto no ken    Between the different girls? Araki has never had much variety between female faces but I'd say he's doing quite a bit better than usual in that regard this time around. Hato is particularly distinct, but I wouldn't mistake Yasuho, Karera, or Daiya for each other either.    ya ya ya    They've never looked like women. Abandon your meme    Is there any way to download the Heritage for the Future OST (without using a Youtube downloader)?     Isn't it in the pastebin?    The OST? i don't think so.    Holy shit you're right Cheers, dude     You shouldn't ask for recommendations on /a/ but what the hell, Read Devilman, you've always got to read Devilman.  That or Berserk, but you've probably already read Berserk, who hasn't? Once both are done, try reading Parasyte, emphasis on "reading". If you're more into comedy, watch Detroit Metal City, or GTO. Both are ridiculous yet enjoyable shows.   Some other great stuff to consider. Grapper Baki Golgo 13  Cromartie High Getter Robo VIOLENCE HERO Riki-Oh.  MD Geist is overblown and fucking ridiculous but you might like it or you might hate it. Inferno Cop. Legend of koizumi is short but sweet. It's about three Ovas long.   If you’d rather read more manga try, Keiji of the Flowers at the Other Side of the Clouds. It was written by the original author of Fist of the North Star. Also Kyou Kara Ore Wa is a good manga. Its a comedy but the characters are manly as fuck. Its like Cromartie High but better.  Bonus: If you’re a sadist, pick up Wolfsmund.  This list should be enough until you learn to pick up the spoon.                         YUKAKO LOOKS LIKE A STEPPED ON BABY    Not him but thanks, i've seen most of the stuff on your list but I could never find more like it and google fails me.    Araki wanted to be a fashion designer, for Gucci. He started JoJo after they refused to employ him. http://www.style.com/slideshows/fas<wbr>hion-shows/spring-2016-menswear/man<wbr>/collection/7</wbr></wbr>        You could, Di♂ is much more fabulous than Caesar    Why don't they have nipples?    Please no, i don't want the thread to be deleted again.   Anyone else think Josuke was being a dick to Yasuho? He just ran off with the other bitch   ability to load songs from your hard drive into ASB during battle   DIO vs Kakyoin   El Cairo   Noriaki Kakyoin's Theme       This is impressively edited   has anyone put the HFTF WRYYY over the anime scene?   The thread is going to be fine.     Why does everyone look like girls in part 5   You're telling me they're not?      i don't see how giving every female a manface is excelling m8     meme   Resorting to buzzwords when you can't defend your point      Nah, I'm sure Yotsuba's stand would be [MONEY FOR NOTHING] in the form of pic related    Hanged Man, nothing else came close to the speed of light.    I'm sorry I don't want to waste more time in making them wear the clothes, but I tried.   What's a good cosplay for a 6'2" lanky Puerto Rican   No, but I did this, much better than the anime wryyy  https://dl.bucket.pw/xhzdoo.mp4     Will part 2 get a print jojonium release in English? Everything I read only talks about it being released in digital..   That the lanky gentlemen in flourescent clothing, with their obvious male features, do not look like women? I didn't think I needed to explain that to anyone who's dick isn't confused.  b-but my ultra funneh meme OP!  Who knew how cancerous this could be        with their obvious male features  My sides     as far as i know   another vento chapter is done. kinda funny that abbachio is driven by the desire to let giorno be right.   Least he's in Eyes of Heaven  The only SBR character announced so far      :to not let giorno be right   So who's the best translation group for Part 4 of JoJo?    Part 5   araki goes full fabulous gay from then on        much better than the anime wryyy  fucking seriously why did the Anime WRYYYY suck so bad?     Currently reading Part 8. So, Gappy likes pressure on top of him while he sleeps because he's used to being under all the dirt while he was buried, right?   I think the anime would have looked a lot better if they kept the Part 2 style.     Part 2 style was only maintainable because they barely animated it       JOJOLION CHAPTER 8 WHEN??   Excluding early part 7, his art really went to shit starting at late part 4 and onward.    Nope. Silver Chariot managed to cut it when it was moving.     He does a shorter version of that very same cry when he does the rush in this screencap.     I think he's full of shit    black jojo    That's a big dick.    4u    This is very nice but i'm pretty sure that isn't really a very good translation, and there are better ones.  it doesn't even translate shinshi as gentleman on a Jonathan song     Parts 1-3: Stone Mask and Dio trilogy Parts 4-6: Arrow and Heaven trilogy Parts 7-9: New Universe trilogy  It's ok to end it here Araki.      anyone else find it freaky that the green baby is based off of a Toyol?    implying there won't be 27 parts    Do people still think Araki has that big of a sameface problem anymore? All the males in part 8 now look very different from one another. Even the females are better now     Parts 4-6: Arrow and Heaven trilogy   trilogy   4 parts  wat         Can you count?    Part 4, 5 and 6. That's 3.  You can count right? A Trilogy is a story told in 3 parts.      It's time to go to bed, anon.                  Please.....      This would be nice as fuck in 1920 * 1080     anon... if only    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zF1<wbr>-RCBuHwQ</wbr>  [ ]  What do you think of the New Style?              So if this was drawn by Araki then it means that he can draw the old parts right?    he also does one when hes muda-ing the Road roller which i consider to be Very fucking good              Fantastic. Well done.          How did he jumped that fountain?     To the guy that's posting JoJo art, mind if you focus on stuff Araki did when he wrote Parts 1, 2, and 3?   How about a version without that awful cover in which Jolyne looks like a man.  I'd probably change the Josuke pic so Koichi doesn't appear on it but I'm too lazy.      I'm impressed considering Japan's boner for Dio.    Remember when Josuke healed it so it would go back and he could track Kira an arc before that?   OTP   Did you forget Lisa Lisa?    Wasn't that just because he cut off his hand? If it wasn't the case then josuke should be able to force all stands back to the user.    pop pop pop the poppers      Imagine all the hatesex after defeating Valetine.     What's your favorite overlooked stand design? Mine is Scan     post best boy   The Hand   Waiting on Part 4 anime for best OTP ever.   literally who    Fuck you I like that cover.     What impresses me about this photo is that someone made a Figma-scale bathroom set.     That's a nice fucking filename.    I hate midgets. I wish Yukako was paired with Josuke. Hell, anyone would be better than fucking Koichi     anyone would be better than fucking Koichi  what about now?     Never played FFX. What's happening here?    Only by putting his blade where he predicted it was going to move preemptively. Do you remember how the fight went down or what?     Gorgeous Irene and Baoh will never be acknowledged again    Irene won't be in eyes of heaven       Apparently(don't quote me on this) there's a random bug that can happen during boss battles in the game that causes your party to face backwards,and doing certain attacks while that's happening will cause your character to run away and never look back.    How's this, anon?    I remember Araki saying that he's really embarressed when he looks back at Gorgeous Irene.Something about not knowing how to write female main characters back then.    Silver Chariot still needed the precision and speed to even hit it since it travels at the speed of light.      Fuck you nigger I'll slit your throat and feed your disgusting guts to a pack of hungry dogs.    Something along the lines of him being embarrassed about his immature view of women at the time and that it was before he was married. He was 25 at the time though.     part 7/part 8 artsyle on the pillar men   part 6 artstyle on joseph      Pretty sure both the foreground and background are early 7   Hey, the newest JoJolion chapter was translated. No scans yet tho https://twitter.com/Kewl0210/status<wbr>/613899087516147712</wbr>   I never visit Jojo threads. I'll make an exception now to say the following:  That roodo rollar. Based Koyasu and based David. It was great. Too bad no Part 4 adaptation.        JoJos look the same.    ACDC/Esidisi looks great on that.    i'm not sure when he drew that, but he recently stated that he can draw in his old style but chooses to not as they've grown in his eyes    Fuck yeah.    Looks good!    I'm going to kill Araki if he gives Jonathan Ceasar's headband again.     That weird but kinda hot Lisa Lisa   lol at Iggy   Part V cast on a bullet train is pretty cool.        I love the Frankenstein-esque look of Early Part 4. Pissed off Josuke looked like a bad motherfucker.      karera isn't the enemy  oh shit she might survive       What does SAS stand for?      But... I did. In order to make the lyrics match phonetically I had to stretch out most sentences and swap the order of them appearing. Thus "A gentlemanly glow" being swapped with "Kindness; He did show".    Her stand power seems pretty shit.   I can only make his 'hair' grow in places he touched himself. I missed out on getting paid... My range is only up to to 80 meters, so even if I grow hair on their bald heads, once I move away from them, it all just falls out so they get mad and ask for their money back and stuff.         Narancia looks top built and Lisa Lisa looks 18 rather than 25.    That's actually pretty hilarious    Worse than Yukako's Love Deluxe.    Jesus Narancia is a fucking caveman.

Requesting Yamato laying on top of Takeo from Oremonogatari like pic related. Nothing lewd obviously.   Crow was an alright dude for being Not!Jounouchi, but his fucking deck, though.    Pokemon Special a best.    And yet Game Freak has not once thought to animate it. Why is that?      Game Freak   in charge of anime      Gamefreak and Nintendo have always been companies that seem to hate and love money simultaneously. It's a strange world.    Okay, that was in fact a dumb thing to assume, but my point is, whoever's in charge of making the anime must know by now that if they reboot it and put on Pokemon Special, they'll make a mint off of it. So why not?   Rough lewds Anything lewd and being done roughly    Tamamo reference.   I would appreciate anything of Kurumi.

Anyone else hoping Jugo finishes Fagg B this week?   anyone else notice how jugos scale looks like the medallion thing bazz tossed him?      bump    we will never see Mom of Murder again    fuck you ;_;   I'm more interested in this Sternritter bsckstory than Fagg B.    tfw Captain Mom will never give me an order I don't want to follow.    I do it anyways for fear of being split in half.   Kill me.        Her dead body hasn't been shown. She's still alive.    dont make me hope ;_;   Was last chapter supposed to give the vibe that Jugo was a femboi who got raped by his uncle, meaning he was happy when Ywach killed him?   i certainly got a creepy vibe from it.   Also Rapemode Unohana flashback when?       Well, it looks like Sternritters were empowered based on (and maybe due to) their deficiencies/complexes/fears/trauma<wbr>s, so such story seems likely.  You know, Yhwach filling holes in their souls.  </wbr>   Unohanabump   final bump   So 631 marks the end of vol69. 632 will kick off vol.70. Any guesses on the cover of 68?  Also raws made it around yesterday morning, wasn't a thread and didn't think it was worth making one for, but here's the overview for it. I can't remember if there were any lines that were especially vague yet important and would need retranslating from mangastream's usual trainwreck.     i hope it isnt fagg b on the cover    Oh and 68's chapters will be 612. DIRTY 613. The Ordinary Peace 614. KILL THE KING 615. All is Lost 616. ミミハギ様 (Mimihagi-sama) 617. Return of the God 618. The Dark Arm 619. The Betrayer 620. Where Do You Stand 621. THE DARK CURTAIN                Any guesses on the cover of 68?   Almost certainly Jushiro Ukitake. Not much happened in those ten chapters except for Yhwach killing the Soul King and Jushiro sacrificing himself to Mimihagi-sama.   No, he's more likely to be on the cover for volume 69 or possibly 70.           I'm thinking maybe Mimihagi or Ukitake, but both are so minor in the whole scheme of what's going on. The only other thing I could think is Yhwach yet again, or maybe the soul king. I'm thinking the vol will be named either Kill the King or All is Lost. Maybe if we're lucky uryuu and the betrayer but i doubt it. It'd be funny if Kubo did Return of the God with Aizen though.     ah then im guessing itll be Aizen on the cover. Even though id like an Ukitake cover for once.    Honestly I think it's still too early for another Aizen cover, but it could happen.    i think a mimihagi ukitake cover would be best. i just fear we're going to get another aizen.    and that'll leave 69's chapters to be 622. The Agony 623. Against the Judgement 624. THE FANG 625. LIVING JAGUAR 626. THE HOLY NEWBORN 627. The Creation 628. New World Orders 629. Gate of the Sun 630. The Twinned Twilight 631. friend  But I think we all know that given Kubo's interest in Bazz-B, he'll take that cover; Unless his little spotlight actually lasts 5 or more chapters and takes up the bulk of vol 70. I really hope it doesn't take that long though.                i hope these rebel quincy get offed. id like to see an actual war for this final fight. one on one battles to the death. none of that 'enemies become friends' BS. id like the gotei to stop fuckin about too. they havent thus far shown a killer edge   no not THAT kind of edge . I want to see them slay their enemy brutally.     no not THAT kind of edge   I want to see them slay their enemy brutally   It's almost like you missed the point entirely.       what if it's Against the Judgement and the cover is  NaNaNa ?    like? i think theyre going to have to channel the old murderous gotei if they want to win this time. the lessons we learned from yhwach beating up yama is that if your blade becomes dull it doesnt cut shit.    Old murderous Gotei was the problem to begin with.  Yamamoto died to ignite a new fire in the new Gotei. Their swords have never been sharper.      how can they be the problem when yamas death is what made the new goteis swords sharper? in their swords becoming sharper theyre becoming like the old gotei - realising theyre in a deathfight with worlds in the balance.    First Genocide leads to current problems   The only way out of this clusterfuck is the total annihilation of the current Quincy occupancy.  There are OTHER quincy out there who have fragmented from the ones in High Heaven, who don't give a shit about Ywach and are living their lives independent of Soul Society. If Ywach got murdered, they wouldn't bat an eye.  Old Gotei 13 started it. New Gotei 13 have to stop it, using old Gotei 13 ways.         But why should they brutalize enemies who've already surrendered and have offered to help them defeat Yhwach?     There are OTHER quincy out there who have fragmented from the ones in High Heaven, who don't give a shit about Ywach and are living their lives independent of Soul Society. If Ywach got murdered, they wouldn't bat an eye.   [citation needed]       Ishida's father. Ichigo.      this <br/>       who don't give a shit about Ywach  Yeah, no.  Still wrong, please keep ignoring hundreds of chapters of story development.        Unohana died for literally no reason   I'll never stop being mad        The quincy who have agreed to help defeat Ywach don't count as part of the current occupancy. Yeah, they contributed to killing of several gotei members, captains and lieutenants included; but it's not like the Gotei 13 captains and lts were exempt from the sins of their progenitors. Genocide is genocide, and in a world where you live and die by the edge of a sword. Forgiveness is hard to come by.  Bazz B and co, if they survive will basically fuck off to nowhere land; they will be fine--because of Ichigo. Attacking them, after Ywach is defeated would end up creating an enemy out of him as well, because the implication of that is if you're Quincy you're an enemy. And in order to prevent that from happening, said co will be let go.       more back story for characters no one cares about please   So by genocide what you actually mean is deicide; kill the false god and his five most loyal soldiers.  All the rest are nobodies who were just following orders.        yeah, no   Stop cherry picking you faggot. The final sentence is absolutely paramount: "If Ywach got murdered, they wouldn't bat an eye."  Ywach is directly responsible for the death of Ishida's mother. Ywach is also directly responsible for the death of Ichigo's mother. Whether Ishida knows the truth of his mother's dead is not of consequence, because his motivations for joining Ywach's army are bluntly obvious.  That said, the two people most relevant to that context are Ryuuken and Ichigo. One has remained neutral in the shinigami/quincy war, because he believes that he would rather be a doctor who helps people. Ichigo on the other hand is straight out to murder the fucker for all the carnage and bullshit he's causing. He also killed people with whom, he was close with.            One has remained neutral in the shinigami/quincy war, because he believes that he would rather be a doctor who helps people.  Unconfirmed.   Stop cherry picking  Stop posting incorrect information.          Unconfirmed   Ryuuken literally told Ishida that not only is HE the last Quincy who holds the Quincy cross passed on by the previous successor, but that he has no interest in Shinigami affairs.  Ywach's rampage is a shinigami affair. It doesn't get any more explicit than that. If Ryuuken gave a shit, he'd show up and assist, considering that he's actually way more OP than than Ishida.          Ywach's rampage is a shinigami affair.  Yeah total destruction of the parallel worlds is totally not a problem. There's zero chance he'll show up with Isshin to take revenge for his own family who died due to Auschwalen, right?      If the combined might of the Gotei 13 can't solve this fucking problem, one more body isn't going to do anything you retard.      Who is Urahara Kisuke?      He's already part of the reactionary force you moron.     Still better then western women ie she hasn't ballooned     Completely missing the point  One person who made all the difference against Aizen. You don't know shit about Bleach, please stop posting.         u miss le point   unconfirmed   ur rong   ur wrong   no wrong    at least add something to the debate faggot.              I'm sorry, "debate"? You continued to post incorrect information and baseless assumptions, I was merely correcting you.    kill yourself autism-kun    No need to start shitposting hombre.      u miss le point   unconfirmed   ur rong   ur wrong   no wrong    is not shitposting?          Give me your dream fights from the whole of Bleach or any other matchups you think would be cool   oh and add reasons why like i just didnt  Unohana vs Gigi - blood  Shunsui vs Shinji - mindfuxhax  Ukitake vs Starrk - projectiles everywhere  yama vs ichibe - hell vs darkness  mayuri vs urahara - ultimate science battle  nakk le vaar vs hisagi - because theyd both do their best not to fight at all  as nodt vs zaraki - because what the hell does zaraki fear apart from shitty fights?  power quincy vs yumichika - fight (with) da powah  fagg b vs grimmjow - because theyre the same character  ukitake vs liltotto - because he would send her nomming ability back at her and she would end up eating herself  byakuya vs haschwalth - because theyre father and son  isshin vs bazz b - fire vs fire  oetsu vs zaraki - sharpest sword in existence vs sword whose ability is to cut everything  zaraki vs snipernegro - because they have the same ability.  gin vs snipenegro - ultimate range battle  zommari vs pepe - rabu battle  barragan vs kirinji - faster than the speed of death?  nianzol the Wind vs Ukitake - ultimate keep-away  quilge vs tousen - confinement battle  loyd the yourself vs royd the yourself - lolol                                              I was correcting you, as in trying to be helpful? Misinformation hurts the whole community. Imagine how many idiots still think Jugram is Byakuya's brother?     brother  wrong. wrong. wrong. do you even Bleach? fuck off.     Of course it's wrong, that was my point? Are you literally that dense?     shown impaled   "Damn, I'm dying"   "DON'T DIEEEE!!!"   "She's dead. I've inherited her everything"  The denial is strong in some /a/nons.       Looks like every single sternritter power so far is actually a curse. It's pretty much confirmed, now that we've found out bazz's family and house were burned down.   Reminder that Rukia is a goddess and the best girl of all time.   More like their powers are shaped by whatever's inside their hearts. As Nodt: "I'm scared!", gets Fear. Bazz-B: "Fucker burned my village down, I'll take revenge!", gets Heat. Now I wonder what kind of desire gives you a power like Question or X-Axis.       given the way Question's powers seemed to be implied to work it'd make sense if Berenice had been a paranoid skeptic. No ideas for X-axis though.     unohana vs gigi  gigi wins by default due to opponent's absence  shunsui vs sinji  fun  ukitake vs starrk  already happened  yama vs ichibe  yama would just bow  mayuri vs urahara  urahara wins  nakk le var vs hisagi  kek  as nodt vs zaraki  would just be another round of bullshit like tosen's bankai failure and as nodt would see zarkai as the real monster and his own power would corrupt him  pq vs yumichika  ....  bazz vs grimmjow  DESSGARRON  ukitake vs lilitto   default win for lilitto due to absent opponent  byakuya vs hschwalth  flower bickering   isshin vs bazz  he pulls bullshit father bankai  oetsu vs zaraki  sword that can cut everything including a sharp sword. imagination cuts materialistic things  zaraki vs snipen  sheet  gin vs snipen  identity crisis due to realizing a white ex-captain's sword will always be longer than his own  zommari vs pepe  pepe gets meme'd out and dies  barragan vs kirinji  they both die to death   nianzol vs ukitake  default win for nianzol due to absence of opponent  quilge vs tousen  tousen loses by default for being a dead,blind man  loyd vs royd  ...  hmm I would like to see Neliel vs Halibel- best out of 3  aizen vs soul king- batle of the gods  ichigo vs orihime- this needs to happen  ishida vs toshiro- short range fight  shiba clan leader vs rangiku- battle for a soul  zangetsu/hichigo vs ywach -look-alikes  robo quincy vs shawlong -if they aren't the same person                                                           he was an uncoordinated person who was always fucked with     "I wish I wasn't born with this lame Y-Axis!"  That's how it happened.      hip fire  kek    bump for bankai  Bumped with perfection.   I think the flashback will last for a while.    yeah i also think...maybe 4-5 chapters if short...10-12 if moderate and 20-25 if long   60 if he makes it into a swing back the pendulum side arc, showing what happened in the war 1000 years back leading all the way to aizens experiments.       Yhwach filling holes  l-lewd     All my yes for the last option. I've bee waiting for this flashback since the Yamamoto fight. I want to see the old Gotei. I want to see Aizen backstory. I want to see Urahara backstory ;_;   Hi, new captain here   Is that Mayuri or Yama in their younger years?   I doubt we'll see her this week.    I want to see Aizen backstory.   mfw this     What will happen when they finally meet?   Good morning Son.jpeg    This is the worst feeling    Aizen's voice   Kurosaki Ichigo   You've matured splendidly,    *molest*         I'm hoping for a looooong flashback.    Their powers are what they lack the most. It's almost like YH filled the missing parts of their soul/heart. When you think about it it's like giving the hollow his heart back    i said this and was shit on in a recent thread. make your mind up /a/ jesus.    Why would they? It's a pretty logical conclusion when you think about it. I wasnt in that thread btw    Yhwach pls. You're not decieving anyone   To those of you who missed it.  Hope is not yet lost. Last week I contacted a TV Tokyo producer and asked him about a Bleach sequel. He says he hasn't heard any news, but the chances are pretty good since Bleach is their highest rated TV show.     Show us the conversation. I dont believe you....dont lift my hopes man ;_;    Well it's a twitter conversation and it's nothing special, really. It only tells us that the TV station that aired it is eager to air it again and that you shouldn't believe faggots who say it was cancelled due to bad ratings.     no one cares   Ywach's most loyal subordinate and a major plot drive  Go read pretty cure.      Here    Stop lying Lon. TV Tokyo producer and Studio Pierrot producer are two different things. Nothing depends on the first one    Studio Pierrot and TV Tokyo are both eager to make another season of Bleach. Bleach is one of if not the highest earning anime Studio Pierrot has ever made. Pierrot have called themselves blessed to have been able to adapt successful anime like Bleach and Naruto in recent years.

Kubo is drawing a short story? Like the doujin for Unmasked?      1 The decision ultimately lies with Shueisha, so this should come as no surprise to you, anon. You can see in the screencap that I posted that there is more than enough incentive to continue airing Bleach, at least for TV Tokyo 2 Look at sales, compare them to Naruto sales and look at this http://www.viz.com/node/1005119   The BLEACH animated series (rated TV-14) has topped the ratings on Cartoon Network’s Adult Swim, sold over 1.8 million DVDs and consistently ranked among Hulu’s most watched shows, This success has further spawned an array of related video games (over 820,000 sold), apparel, action figures, trading cards and other merchandise.   3 Is from a documentary where they visit SP HQ, in that same interview the leader and founder of SP states that SP was named after french clowns and that they've been truly blessed to be able to make successfull anime like Bleach and Naruto. I think it's from 2012 after the anime of Bleach ended.  That's not a doujin, doujinshi are self published works.            This interview https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mKq<wbr>-EnHL56o</wbr>  [ ]      Anyone else hoping Jugo finishes Fagg B this week?  Yes  I can't believe we're going to be subjected to the backstories of these cunting Sternritters.          Bleach is their highest rated TV show  I call bullshit because of all the crying about filler. I didn't mind most of the filler, and still enjoy the show for it's characters. I just don't see it being revived or even discussed until after the manga concludes.     The Bleach staff frequently say that they get lots of messages from fans asking when the anime is coming back. Face it, those who make a fuzz and bitch and moan are the minority. They always are.    That video you posted was from 2010 right after the filler story with the zanpakutos. It was very popular then. But you cant win an argument with outdated info.    time to go follow LoN    Well then there's    Daily reminder that if Unohana were still alive, she would have one shot, Ywach by now, and we could all go home.  That's why she had to be written out.     Yeah. No.      So then it is most likely they would bring the anime back when the manga is close to being concluded? Otherwise the only other reason for it being canceled is anime is just to damn expensive to produce nowadays.    Still, there is nothing certain. We don't know.   Where is the anon with the raw scans? I only managed to save this   The results of the latest character popularity poll will be posted too    Look at the bottom tweets, that's a different thread and Ben replied to the same post creating a subthread.    Also he said "maybe so" in reply to my post claiming that it had declined. Info I took from hearsay and rumors posted here and on bleachasylum, his info dates to one year ago.   TOMORROW O M O R R O W          What is the size of the paper Kubo uses to draw? Such fine lines ...    oh please, this is nothing, some of us still wait for ulquiorra to return    What reason do you have to believe that he'll return? Kubo explicitly said he's dead. Why?   B azz-b with the letter H H aschwalth with the letter B  like in B leac H  it's like pottery        I don't have any reason. I just can't help it. it kinda helps that kubo is an untrustworthy hack.     Balance the Love Exploding in an Almighty and Compulsory Heat?   Am I cool now? Am I a 4th level yet?      Kubo stahp    notice how jugo is shit with arrows   because hes a shinigami     Yhwach's sword has a name. Is he a shinigami too?    he was. why else would kubo reveal that his sword has a fucking name? its a zanpakuto   I need more Kurotsuchi and Kenpachi shenanigans   they make a pretty formidable team    How is he the father of the quincies then? Why is he fighting the shinigami?    Clearly   Yoruichi a best   ichibe called him a human. hes the reios son. reio had a tryst with a human female. note how the RG were not so much guarding as waiting on reio. hikifunes food, kirinjis cleanliness, ichibes teachings and oetsus self defence. it seems yhwach got too big for his boots and created a race of his own and that pissed off the shinigami. then they had to imprison reio. remember we saw him waking up. and then the next we see he is in pieces and encased in crystal. also hikifune said that the reiatsu cage she created was the biggest she had created for some time. they imprisoned reio. and back to the yhwach thing - he was fucking up the balance they had created through reios imprisonment so he had to go. yama couldnt kill him though. he fucked him up but only to the extent that yhwh was in a ba(b)by form. yama has shown (with wonderweiss) that he couldnt kill a child. this shows hes capable of massacring enemies but not children      wat    Unohana's breast milk (bottled)   Yoruichi's sweaty leotard   Rukia's pajama top   You can only have one. Choose wisely.       Pajama top.    n-nobody is going to debate my assertions?    If Mayuri is up there, where are Rose and Kensei?    (bottled)  Well I guess if you said you could have it right from the source it would've been a no brainer decision.      She's dead ;_;    Orihime's panties after a wet dream about Kurosaki-kun    Why there's a thread about a shounen garbage in my board? What are mods doing?    Your bait is weak old man    and your virginity stronk    ;_; no     Orihimes translated theme song  Don't go away  Don’t go away If you love her, don’t go away Daddy, if you love her, tell her That she is the woman of your life, life, life  Daddy, don’t go away We don’t want to live without you Don’t go away at the end of the night  Night, you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief He has left without me  All three of us won’t go to the cinema anymore  Night, you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief He has left without me  Daddy, if you thought a little of me  Where are you going when you go away from here I can’t live without you With the woman of your life, life, life Daddy don’t screw up When we love, we don’t leave We don’t leave at the end of the night  Night, you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief He has left without me  You’ll never bring me in the USA  Night, you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief He has left without me  Daddy, I ensure you, stop leading me on  Night, you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief He has left without me  Daddy, I am sure you’ll come back one day  Night, night you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief Daddy, I ensure you stop leading me on Night, you frighten me Night, you do not finish Like a thief He has left without me  Daddy, I am sure you’ll come back one day                                                                      Who's her daddy?    in the pilot chapter he took the place of her brother. and killed her ass.    How can you have followed Bleach for this long and still have hope for anything? We're all just along for Kubo's wild ride.    Oh yeah, the pilot. Will Ichigo confess like in the pilot?    the only one with feelings was orihime. and oh its you. kill yourself.    No, because 1) it's not possible, since we're moving into a Blood War flashback arc and 2) we're FINALLY moving into a Blood War flashback arc.     Cool, they were best pals and now they have to kill each other.  I dont think Jugram cared that Juha burned down his home because of his creepy uncle.       Why so defencive?    Not him, I don't think that it counts as "defensive" when someone spouts objectively wrong things and gets called out on it.  In any case, NOOOO FIGHTING     Spoilers when? I miss the wednesday releases. Also when will Bleach get another CP?  Will the ichiruki and ichihime shippers finllay go and kill themselves when ichitatsu happens?   That is not how you spell AizenxIchigo, anon    OTP right here    You and me anon. We have seen the light    Pajama top obviously.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E3C<wbr>yPYSwnTc</wbr>  [ ]   Turncoat quincies pls don't die pls    I like bazz-b, I want him around. He should forget about Hashbrown and hook up with Renji    pretty nice. i think it's not complete yet. please expand on yhwach's motives and RG motives.   Man, this thread is slow.   KUBOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    It'll probably be The Balancer, rather than The Balance. Ya know, so long as we're being super autistic about this.    Then Hash is a shinigami. They were referred as balancers in the past. Hash cant use bow, has a sword and balances....something.     Nigga, night you frighten me   Nigga, you do not finish   Like a thief   Daddy, I ensure you stop leading me on   Nigga, you frighten me   Nigga, you do not finish   Like a thief   He has left without me             Bazz-B was an old-school magic hunter (early-quincy)   Haschwalth was a balancer (early-shinigami)      Both races have the same origin. And are oposites. What about humans and hollows?    Arrancar is the missing link    Yhwach fills empty hearts and souls. Hollows have lost their hearts. Hollows are poison to quincy. The question s why    Hollows haven't lost their hearts., have they? I thought their hearts became their masks?   shit i just realized the last color page we got was 617 and that was just the cover. Before that it was 607, also just the cover. Then 601, 587, 576 , 573, 564. One every 10 chapters or so on average, but all just single page chapter covers.  547 was the last time we really had a real proper color spread. I know things haven't been ideal for Bleach in terms of popularity as of late but Kubo's color spreads used to be one of his big saving graces. Why take them away?     534, 527, 523, 511... all single page  505 had the double of bankai Yamamoto but it wasn't super flashy      495 before that was single, but 494 had the big gotei spread    okay so 487 was before that and that was a two pager, but still nothing particularly flashy in the way Kubo used to do it.    prior to that was a single on 483, and before that was the spread in the 5 page color open to the entire arc in 480.    weird that Driscoll was in there with Juugram and Bazz-B as one of Kubo's early sternritter designs yet he got off'd so fast.    I thought Ichigo had some feelings for Orihime in the pilot? Or was it the sort of awkward attraction with no feelings behind it like in the main series?   Double that order.       Hollows lose their hearts, and their masks are formed to hide their instinct  Taking the form of a monster to hide from the fact that humans are the true monsters  ...shit, this is deep, how didn't I realize this before. Kubo~        I wonder if those two are still alive, Kubo sure did spend a long time on them for some weird reason.   I want to smell Soi Fon's armpits.   It was a good way to lull the reader into the desired mood.  I want to see them again though, preferably alive.      I want Soi Fon to smell my armpits.    man, the cleaners are shit. I can actually see detail here    That's gross. Get out.     Don't blame the cleaners, blame the fact that it's a speedscan group. Their objective will always be to get the chapter out as soon as possible. Also the quality of paper they use in magazine scans for WSJ is garbage. Tankoubon scans are way easier to work with.    Wow seriously? I'm trying my best.  Rude.          and hark the boredom mighty roars        life isn't worth living     well she and Gigi were with Bazz-B when he arrived at the palace so they should be near by. The fight might not get to a point where they need to bail Bazz-B out this week but it can't be far away.     shit, missed one     Has Kubo seriously only done three colors with any of the Sternritter that aren't Yhwach?     fuck I think this should be right finally    fuuuck    Yeah, 480 just had the chins 495 was Yhwach 505 had a color page (not the chapter cover) of The O getting his face melted off, but that was just a close up of a smoking skull, not even a skeleton in uniform 547 had the big pile of profile heads 576 was Gremmy 581 is missing from   but it had color mugshots of ZTG&amp;P  How did Kubo manage to avoid a Quilge color page? Or As Nodt? Or Mask de Masculine? Those fights went on for nearly whole volumes by themselves.              this was a stupid convoluted process    So what was this supposed to be? Before it was revealed that Askin has the retarded arbitrary power based on lethal dosing, people assumed this was some sort of portal and "D" would stand for "The Door", but fuck if I know now.    That Nelliel pic and the post below had me randomly come up with a lazy, but crazy idea that she was a part of Yhwach's army 1000yrs ago. I mean she has a European as fuck sounding name and seems to have more emotion than other Arrancars; so it's almost like her hollowed heart was closed/filled by something.     Same thing happened with Bambietta, the first invasion she was cutting people from a distance, and when she murder fucked that guy in between she cut through multiple walls leaving a perfect square hole, then in the second invasion it was turned into blowing shit up.     Indeed. Backstories are craved for the whole gang.      Go to your local library. They may have manga in proper quality.     and there was that time before PePe was named that he was referred to as the "watcher" or "overseer" and had a staff with an eyeball.     the first invasion she was cutting people from a distance  She had a sword tho.     i wonder if that'll happen with hashbrown and his B    yhwach would see it as his birthright. and reio would agree. thus they imprisoned reio and tried to kill yhwh      i say jugo is a shinigami and i get flamed to hell. make up yo mind /a/     Why does Ichigo's hair look like he just fucked his shit up?    Precure Thread    Pirika Pirilala Popolina Peperuto! Post the prettiest Cure!  And thus like a phoenix the Precure Thread is reborn.

Kind of shitty, but still way better than the official design.    They are all boys, and the Pink is now Red. Aside from that, nothing.     riririririiriiriririri miarae got a flat chest   flat chests are all welcome here in /pc/.  It's justice, after all.       1-hour drawing incoming.  Today's theme is about one of those two girls in Futari Wa, the cute, cute, cute Kubota Shiho.

Human form fairies should get their own official Cure forms.    Posting /b/ and /v/ tier 3D shit is not magic.  Post precure in /pc/ or fuck off.     Davi is perfection!  It's been more than 10 years and Honoka is still the only Jewish precure.   Will there ever be another?      Davi will never be your mom     Rikka.     Davi will never be your dirty baby sitter.     Iona.       They do look blueish.       Now we need racist designations for all the other colors.     Davi will never be your owner      You will never make MakoP into a mother     Never mellow around a Yellow.    Wait, Haruka isn't Jewish?    Friends.     You will never meet MakoP's mother     She eats too much. She has poor grades. Has no ambition, but somehow everyone follows her.  Nozomi is American.   She enjoys tea and horseback riding. She's never satisfied with anything. She wants to lead everyone until she meets Nozomi.  Karen is English.   Always angry. Too much heat. Scared of ghosts, but not spiders. Has no job skills.  Rin is Australian.   Dunno about the Yellow or Green.                    I always imagined Akane to be Australian, despite her obvious Kansai accent. I'm not sure why.    Pent up sexual frustration and a nice ass.    I think you picked the wrong series for this exercise. They're mostly bland and poorly fleshed-out characters.    Well, she does love gorillas, so there's that. I don't know how that factors into her being remotely Australian but there you go.      obvious Kansai accent  In my head, Kansai is nip Texas. This is probably due to Abenobashi. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M_t<wbr>MD5bTbLM</wbr>  [ ]    Pent up sexual frustration and a nice ass.  Agreed. Now match that to a racist stereotype, please.    bland and poorly fleshed-out  That's not incompatible with racism.               Osaka is nip texas   Reminder that Alice is a /k/ommando.   Haruharu is clearly Irish.      Huh. Maybe I got Osaka and Kansai confused.   F5 indeed.           Stop making me want to watch Doki    Osaka is the largest city in the Kansai region.    Are you still on that? Seriously let it go. Hide the post, hell report it, just don't go picking fights that derail the thread.     Ah! So they're the same. Thanks.     The Bad End Kingdom are now Phantoms   The Cures are all Gates who subdued their Phantoms   Candy is now the daughter of Emperor Pierott    The Bad End Precures never existed   We Kamen Wizard Precure now         And Mayo    The Yes5's being shallow is totally compatible with racism, but the bland part is a dealbreaker. It's hard to say anything truly interesting about Urara, for instance, because she's not really very descript past her ambition.  Aside from having no friends.      Yeah, stop. No one should want to watch Doki, that's just inhumane.    Not exactly the same, but when you talk about someone speaking Kansai dialect it's more likely that you're referring to the Osaka version than, say, the Kyoto version.      Sorta. Kansai is generally reserved for designating the geographic region or an accent, but you wouldn't really say someone "is Kansai" or "comes from Kansai", they'd be more likely to say what city they're from (at the limit, maybe which prefecture).      Urara also eats like crazy. She's very hard-working and focused which is why she had no friends.  I think she had another character trait, too, but it's been years and I can't remember.   Like you have a Southern accent, but you're from Virginia, not Southernia.         Though I suppose people say they're "from the South".         Minami's joined hands take the shape of an armpit.    I might have a problem .         Has volume 2 stuff been posted?   What is Minamean hiding behind her back?      Minami is so beautiful, I could just stare at her all day.          Where would i find vol 1?       those child bearing hips     The entire thing? Not a clue.     those heir-bearing hips     Them Hime hips    WHAT A FAT BUTT.      Damn clowns.    Clowns are scary.          Iona has a pretty big butt.   What will the next Precure's theme be?  I'm tired of GoPri already.      Unlovely's dress looks like another lily design.   Cannibalism.       Why is she so lovely?    But she's Unlovely.    Emergency services. Firefighters, police officers and EMTs.

People are scrambling to torrent sites to get everything they want before the eternal winter known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement sets in.    insignificant    Source?    One of the Doki magazines.    Bothersome.   I want to pose a  dumb  question.  Say through some unexplainable circumstance, you were asked to become a Cure member. Some perks would include getting a cool tuxedo for an outfit, and getting to use an element of your choice. Any one you want.  But if you do decide to join, be aware that your transformation sequence is girly as hell. The costume is not, but expect a transformation not too different from Star Driver. Also, you can only fall in love with the Pink Cure. All the others are off limits.  Even the Yellow one.   Would you do it?          Can the costume be girly as well?    Can the Pink Cure be Mana and am I allowed to mercilessly break her heart? Then hyeah.     Wanting to BE the magical girl  Oh, why not?      transformation   Star Driver  You had me at Apprivoise.     I know we're dead and you're just trying to foster conversation, but I'm getting tired of these fanfiction-tier posts.   I would do it of course, but I'm not sure how any of the pinks would react.   I think you completely misread the question.       Am I replacing a current member? Because if so let me join Heartcatch and replace Itsuki. If not let me join Yes! 5 and steal Nozomi from Coco or Suite and steal Hibiki from Kanade.   I'm looking to watch a precure series with a friend. I've already seen Yes 5, Dokidoki, Heartcatch, and Futari. Which of the others would work best to watch with along with someone else?     I always thought Smile was a fun one. It was the first one I watched, anyway.  But, if all else fails, show him Heartcatch first.        Pretty  much any. Maybe Fresh? Eas is a nice discussion point since  she'll be your first reformed villain Cure.    I want a Precure seasn where the OP and ED  is sung by JAM Project.    Smile for flashy animation and braindead SoL, Fresh for shower scenes and QUALITY.    Maybe in 10 years when the little girl market has dried up and Toei's forced to pander to otaku or let Precure die.    She badly needs to get those chest tumors removed.    Anyone know where I can buy this shit? I see a barcode and Toei's official merchandise seal on it but none of the regular sites have it.    You mean Yayoi's wet dream?    What's wrong with a girly transformation?  And some pinks are better than others, but they're rarely the worst pick of the bunch.  So yes!        What did you like so far, and what did you like about them?    What's wrong with chest tumors?    Don't worry the 15°anniversary series will be a remake of Futari Wa with all the episode being animated with movie budget and two openings from Jam Project. And most important of all  Honoka will be shown being an adorable pair with Kariya.     Disgusting and bad for their health.     Alice   wearing blue       Heartcatch would be the easiest way to get someone into the franchise, but I personally think Fresh is the best one to watch with a friend, since it's hilarious.      Ginga bishounen  Sold. Instantly.  But I'm a girl, can I still have the tuxedo and woo the pink into a /u/ end?      Fresh is the best option, I watched 2/3 of it with my brother (he normally sees Precure as something girly), and it was the best thing we have seen together. It was a hilarious ride, the QUALITY only makes ot better when seeing it with someone else.   What were your thoughts on this album?  Their latest album was pretty good why did people hate it?   Pharrel was attached to the project so it got super popular among normies. Therefore we are supposed to hate it without question or pause.

Takeo was violated!  Is it hamsterbanana time?  You should use spoilers for NSFW content.   No you shouldn't. That's explicitly against the rules.    Yes you should. That's explicitly follows the rules.      Spoilered pornography or other "not safe for work" content is NOT allowed on the work safe boards.       I like how Suna was scared when Takeo came in his room asking for a favour. You could really hear it in his voice.  so did everyone drop this?   Yamato was too much of a slut.    Nope it's just there are more people with shit taste watching shows like hibike   Oh baby its time  I haven't seen the episode but allow me to get   kyaaaaaaa   kyaaaaaaaaaa   SUKIDA   for 20 minutes   no plot or characters in sight   Suna sighs because he hates being here          Takeo's dad would be a handsome man if it weren't for his all black eyes. He looks frightening.   Incoming doujin were he cucks his son    Anon please. Takedad wants his women with some meat on her bones. Also I'm sure his wife could beat the shit out of him if he tried    the people on /a/ are way too mature for shows like this    No but most people are going to let it finish then marathon it. It's a good show but it just kinda drags at some parts   Suna is really giving me more and more gay vibes.   mfw this season    You marathon romcoms or else they aren't as good    I'm watching but I rarely drop by on the threads.    with the others, waiting to marathon it   Yamato's mannerisms were so damn cute this episode   I wish I could marathon it, but I can't help but watch it now. It's too damn good      Man I really like this anime. In most romances it is some normal, nice guy, with above average grades dating a pure girl who would never imagine doing sexual things.  In Ore Monogatari, though, the protagonist is not some decent student but a really tough jock who gets all the women to like him. He doesn't go for nice girls but prefers to fuck sluts who want to hold hands with him and do things to him when he sleeps.     When is the new girl going to appear and NTR that slut Yamada    implying they won't both cuck their son for Yamato     Holy quads batman      No <br/>    So Tekeomom wishes some grandsons?   MFW All doujins featuring Tekeo dad NTRing his son.    No even practicing on Suna?     Suna-kun, I have to practice getting a blowjob!    Why the fuck is the handsome as fuck dad with someone like her?    Love is stupid that or she is really good in the sack ugly girls give the best head    Chapter 14 translation when?   She started off as a young, petite, pretty thing like Yamato.  Then she gave birth to a human mountain. That does things to the body. Things that aren't always pleasant.      Real life/reality sucks. That's why we watch anime.  Faggot.      His voice is really weird for some reason.     She was a wrestler before she got married, man. Takeo's dad probably just viewed anything less as not enough of a challenge. I mean think about it, would it be much of a rodeo if people had to ride cows instead of bulls?     Same reason why Yamato is with Takeo.     What the fuck is this food?   Salisbury steak or rissoles with pineapple and a salad.       It just works      thought this post was a bit too early to make that assessment   thought people would start flooding in   "m-maybe there's another thread?"   there isn't   people actually dropped this         More for us.   Has Yamato's voice gotten less annoying?   Nope. I still have diabetes   I love Takeo's parents.   It's not the type of show where there'll always be a lot of discussion.      People don't deserve this show, it's too cute!   This is the only romance anime that i actually can relate to.   I'm still watching, but I usually end up too happy to visit /a/ afterwards I was just here for webms  No need for negativity after all that heart-melting goodness       Are you also a slut then? pft, I bet you'd want to  make a good impression on his parents before announcing your engagement  too, you lustful maneater     I really don't like anime romance because its always the same boring cliche stuff but this show really breaks every cliche. 9/10 show so far and everyone can watch it and have a good time.       this show really breaks every cliche   That's a good and a bad thing though, like when  the anime catches up to the end of the manga where it subverts their happiness with Yamato ending up in the hospital and dying from the same heart condition that took Suna's dad.   ;_;         All moon mothers want grandkids.   The lack of hamsterbanana in this thread is disturbing.   Episode 13 - Sunakawa's birthday and Yamato being jealous Episode 14 - Ai and Oda part 1 Episode 15 - Ai and Oda part 2  And the chapter you're talking about is somewhere in volume 5, while episode 14 is the start of volume 4.       So, was this the season finale or are we getting more episodes after this one?    that fucking QUALITY      There going to be 26 episodes.    You have to be suicidal to do that.     It's confirmed 24 episodes, might be a week off next week      Neat. Thanks.     It's two cours, supposedly 26 episodes. Scanlations only go up to the first couple chapters of volume 4 (the latter of which was only actually typeset a couple months ago using an old translation posted here back in August). And this was included with the newest scanlated chapter, meaning it's a bit later after , especially since this is somewhere in volume 5.  Chapters are supposedly contained stories, so the first three episodes where Takeo and Yamato meet and get together is one chapter/story, and the most recent scanlated one is the 13th chapter.       might be a week off next week  No break next week; business as usual; no delay either: http://www.ntv.co.jp/program/detail<wbr>/21841686.html</wbr>     Chapter 1 - Takeo and Yamato (episodes 1-3) Chapter 2 - Ai Sunakawa (episodes 5-6) Chapter 3 - Yamato's friends and the fire (episode 4) Chapter 4 - Judo competition (episode 7) Chapter 5 - Yamato's birthday and Sunakawa's dad's surgery Part 1 (episode 8) Chapter 6 - Yamato's birthday and Sunakawa's dad's surgery Part 2 (episode 9) Chapter 7 - Hiking and lost in the woods (episode 10) Chapter 8 - Going to the beach (episode 11) Chapter 9 - Sunakawa's birthday and Yamato's jealousy (episode 13) Chapter 10 - Studying (episode 12) Chapter 11 - Ai and Oda (episodes 14-15) Chapter 12 - Sports tournament? (episode 16?) Chapter 13 - Athletic meet, Swedish relay, and Mariya (episode 17?) Chapter 14 -   I'm not sure about chapter 6 onward. It sounds like it's part of chapter 5 honestly, but I'm going by what Batoto says. If Batoto's wrong, it means chapter 13 will happen in episode 18 or 19.  There's also the chapter where Yamato is in some baking competition or class or something, and one of the chefs falls for her, and there's all the KISSU chapter, and I have no idea when that happens in terms of story placement, but I think it would make sense to have it in the last episode.   Aah, thank you.                        24 episodes   This better not go full Kimi on me, I am not putting up with 24 episodes of "Oh I hope this person who obviously likes me likes me" bullshit      I think it's kinda cute now, though I think I've just gotten used to it by now.    Try 3. The only thing you're gonna be waiting on is the KISSU (which does eventually happen going by manga raws), because Takeo and Yamato get cockblocked every time they're about to try it.    It's not like that. Also, try Horimiya. It's a manga, but it's not full of misunderstandings.     That Slut!    Is that actually what she said?    Is so fuck, type 2 inbound        Thank you for censoring the niggerlips. This pleases me.   gotta love how suna just noped the fuck out of the way of that incoming shot.    Nope. This series is so uplifting that I need to watch it every wednesday so I don't become an hero.    Please be trolling. PLEASE.    Seriously? After all the NTR and homo shitposting you're still worried about crap like that? How many thousands of times do you guys have to hear it said? This isn't that kind of show.      I got everything I wanted from the first three episodes. The rest of the episodes just seemed like extra credit to me.    two weeks for the exams.   zero motivation to study.   this episode comes out.     reminded there I have no qt girlfriend to study with       Still on the grind anon? Is it   summer quarter   already?    yep, still on the grinder. Spring semester officially ends this Monday then exam season till the 24th.     Chapter 9 - Sunakawa's birthday and Yamato's jealousy (episode 13)   Fucking finally. The three of them always hang out, yet there is next to no conflict or relationship between Suna and Yamato.  Either make them bros or have them catfight to see who wins the takeo bowl, but for the love of god stop making them so neutral of each other.       I dont understand the problem, Two Takeo's plus two Yamato's would be great, it opens up so many options, orgies, swapping, One couple stays at home having mad sex while the other goes to school and they swap daily. if one Yamato gets incapacitated from her sexual duties you always have a backup.    It was a girl's college  Ok, I chuckled.    How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        <br/>    Coz dio never experienced thus like jotaro Jotaro was more experienced moving when others stopped time It was the first time for lord dio no sama      oh, thanks    It is explained in the fight itself. There is a reason why Jotaro used his time stop right after Dio's ninth second ended. Think about it.     DIO stops time   ROADAROLLADA   Jotaro manages to oraora himself out   ZA WARUDO hits its limit   STAHPLATNUM doesn't    DIO's left side heals slower than his right   DIO's left leg was recently knocked clean off   both knees just broken   JOTARO PUNCH to left knee   How do people not understand this shit. as far as asspulls go, this one at least makes sense.                DIO's left side heals slower than his right   DIO's left leg was recently knocked clean off   both knees just broken   JOTARO PUNCH to left knee   How do people not understand this shit. as far as asspulls go, this one at least makes sense.   I thought dio absorbing josephs blood finally made him complete since we know longer see the scar, without it, you just explained everything but with it , its just odd.        That final fight was bullshit the idea that two people have the same stand implies that they have an identical soul It would have been better if after absorbing Josephs blood Dio realized DahWurldoh had negative side effects that weren't apparent before. Jotaro picks up on this and renders DahWulrdoh useless, playing into the trope that when you understand the enemy stand you win This is why Jotaro is undefeated, you can understand his stand but still cant defend against it because it's brute force Then after everyone gets the fight they wanted to see, Star Platnum vs full OP vampire Dio Seriously, Dio never once used his laser eyes, tentacles or ice powers he had in Act I Would have been way better to see a classic Man vs Monster slug fest           More like, how did Dio heal Vanilla Ice when he chopped his own head off?      We don't see Jotaro escape but we do see blood beneath the machine use to crush him     more like, how vanilla ice needed to die again before he became a vampire and when he gt his own head chopped off and dio gave him his blood.    The undead shouldn't have stands in the first place A stand is a manifestation of soul or whatever and vampires/zombies are very lacking in that department      I dont know about dio but ice already had his stand . has it ever been said in any medium that vampires lose their soul?    He had Star Platinum bring him some tomatoes. Remember D'arby?    Why didn't DIO notice him escape since he wasn't frozen in time when Jotaro escaped?    Too busy muda muda and gloating, using up his two seconds in Jotaro's time stop   what I want to know is what the hell can you do in 2 secs? apparently jotaro can do alot.   I'm pretty sure in Phantom Blood they kinda talk about that when they introduce zombies    Pretty sure Jotaro was crushed before 9 seconds so he should have still been frozen   The 2 seconds later were for nothing       classic Man vs Monster slug fest  We already had that in part 1, how about some variety? You autists and your double standards are silly. "Monster of the week is shit, but I want every part to be exactly like part1/part2.     Dio brought people who had been dead for decades back to life.   Will part 2 get a print jojonium release in English? Everything I read only talks about it being released in digital    This is true    This is also true. I just assumed it was the work of his stand.         according to an extra little book araki wrote, vampirism is an early attempt at producing a stand. Vampires attain unique stand like abilities known as modes. Each vampire has their own unique ability much like a stand. The pillar men have the most obvious, but Dio had his unique ice ability, wired beck had his spike ability, etc.  The side effect of gaining these psuedo stands was becoming undead.   So i think its safe to say that vampires and zombies are capable of possessing a stand, since their abilities are rooted in stands to begin with.          Vanilla Ice is probably the best example.     Dont the ripple final objective was a full fledge stand?  I mean like being Spin counterpart, and Johnny getting Act 4 and Gyro Ballbreaker? Pls don't kill me because i thought of something     Reminder that the only people Dio killed were  Danny Joestar   a couple of chavs   George Joestar I   Dire   Jonathan Joestar   Noriaki Kakyoin   So just about as much as Kira. Kars and his Diavolo killed dozens more and Pucci literally killed the entire Part 6 cast save Emporio. Dio is one of the cleaner characters.           Didn't he treat a bunch of women like blood/sex cattle?    Dio have killed countless of people that aren't relevant to the story aswell.     an entire town doesn't count   citizens of egypt don't count   the piles of dead women in his mansion don't count   Yeah no.        Yeah, that was mentioned in the same book. The ripple, the spin, and the stone mask were all methods to achieving a stand.  The only ones that worked were the arrow, the spin and the corpse.  Interestingly enough, all of Dio's sons were born with stands, so maybe it wasnt entirely ineffective at stand creation.            who is the senator?   who are the bystander dio had senator order to runover?   who is the woman dio convinced to eat her own baby in part 1?   who are the people he first use the stone mask on and discovered vampire?       So who's the best scan group for JoJo Part 4? Are The Invisible Trio any good?  so /a/, what is the weakness of time stop bullshit and how to counter it?   Another time stop bullshit.    so no counter?    IIMA MADE NI TABE PAN~    shouldn't moving in time stop have spent his time stop ability? he was clearly punching while time was stopped, he reached his limit and then before the duration of dio's time stop was up he stopped time.    MiH counters The World.    how about no time manipulation stand?    Maybe Cream.    GER     wait until Vanilla comes out of cream   stop time   kill him       yeah, stroheim maybe.    Shooting a projectile that is spinning infinitely or deleting/speeding up time bullshit.    Sheer Heart Attack   It has no weaknesses     Well guys it's time to catch up with the JOHJs (who are getting #BTFO)  Crab man survived the fall from the chink spacecraft but was forced to mold(?) at impact and now is all soft and shit.  top 4 in the M.A.R.S ranking are now reunited and are butt-devastating johjs, with the help of traitorous octopus man.    To be honest the remnants of the Russian squad did help to push the johj, scorpion girl was based and mole man didn't take shit from no one. also Narwhal girl is practically on the shrimp's dick.  Now without his ''globes'' Keiji gains 5X speed.      And now its confirmed, no sea animal can withstand the Shrimps Dick.   Can't resist the power of crustaceans.   lets try this again despite coolest janitor  Raws when?    Reminder to keep sending feedback reports to 4chan.org/feedback until the bullshit stops. There are two One Piece anticipation threads currently active.  HE WAS THE COOLEST MOD   Taijutsu user  How can a jobber become Hokage?   Seems like Boruto is inside Susanno when he uses the Rasengan in the trailer.   <br/>    Actually there's 3 now, Good job coolest mod    Mein OP-Fuher, my I ask a question. Why hasn't Kishimoto killed off Sakura-chan yet?   XTH FOR KIBA   Because it's not enough    He is.   If Sakura 2.0 becomes Hokage then the village is doomed.      Which parents gave birth to the ugliest kid?   inb4 choji  Chou is going to be the sexiest loli ever when she unlocks butterfly mode so you'd be wrong.      A thinner retarded nigger is still a retarded nigger.    Tsunade was Hokage for all of 4 years.    Sasuke will be worried by Sakura and Salad will smile watching them on the next chapter The ride is over but it was beautiful while it last     Inojin used to look like a hideous pale corpse until SP turned him into best girl.   Narutard Ass Status: Obliterated  Thank god we still have some sensible mods here on this board.     No one cares about feedback by newfags from reddit and tumblr.    Then you better be sure not to give any feedback then.   Reminder that no matter how hard Kishi tries, Sakura will not come out of this looking anything less than pathetic.   surrogate scenario   this woman has enabled me to conceive a child with the man I love, for whom she also had feelings herself   I better make it all hush-hush and cover her face with mine, that is clearly the right thing to do    actual cuckoldry   s-sure I will care for the child you made with someone you'd rather fuck than I   but you will drop by and spend time with me- I mean us, right?    MISUNDERSTANDINGS   I will act like a violent bitch when presented with entirely basic questions   I remain unable to take a photo of my family and have not seen my husband in 12 years, I am sure he will be back from buying Ninja Cigarettes any day now   nonetheless I will break our family home to shreds                 Anyone who doesn't answer Ino and Sai is straight up lying to you.    What if Salad was a clone?   see<br/>       Don't need to give feedback because I don't have complaints over Narutards getting shut down.  Please continue crying, however.      Because the last thing we need is another Uchiha fucking shit running around with a Mangedgeyo Sharingan.     What's with the paranoia? I'd like to see some proof that people from reddit or tumblr are posting on 4chan.       implying Sasuke isn't just worried that if Sakura dies, he'll have to take care of his kid himself.      Hey, you're the one posting in a thread you don't like. I think you're the one upset.    Wow, this is probably one of the manga designs that was heavily improved by the anime character designer.    See      Uchiha   Normal Powerlevel   Wants to become Hokage  THE COOLEST GIRL      fuck off  Damn Kishi why do you make Hima sad?   stay mad, pleb   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Rock Lee Jr confirmed  At at full hype now!     Unlike you, I'm not the one crying all the time in the archive so your burthurt exceeds mine both in this thread and in the archive.   People stop replying to obvious bait. He's upset because his favorit ship got ruined.    post-moot faggot calling somebody else a newfag     TOO LATE   Papa Shin is dead. Then again it was Rai machine translating it, so take it with a grain of salt.     What if Salad was a clone?   Only the best genes are allowed to be cloned.        mods   But no has gotten one banned. Why the fuck do we have so many newfags right now? Is it because of the reddit invasion on /r9k/, /tv/, and /pol/ that it leaked to even here? Summer?         Shin father is dead...    I translated some text and it says he's dead.       Sai and Ino's son. A gentle shinobi who can attend to his surroundings with a cool presence.     Say that to the SSfags. Most probably they'll get what they want, Sakura will be the biological mother and Sasuke will show he cares even if he didn't show it for 12 years. The dream is over    Search 'fuck off' in the archives and see how many results you pull up that are in Naruto threads. Face it, you're butthurt. And you're still here, in a thread you don't like.   What about the anime  DID THE FUCKING ANIME REACHED GUY WREKING MADARA'S SHIT YET?  How many fucking fillers are they releasing,  do they seriously want so many fillers that the anime will also end at episode 700?  fuck that            Literal Paranoia     Because Bort hates cake.   I was wrong about Shin absorbing the life force of another sin  There seems to be tree type of Shin clones:  - The nromal - The fat - The skinny         To be fair, she'll go blind long before she becomes an actual threat with the mangekgeyo sharingan.   There's not way Sarada would take on the 5 Great Nations, especially since they're all allies (to a certain degree) now. That's like one lonely little mass murderer taking on The US National Defense.      tfw ramen lady is already married   whos the lucky man /a/?   Where are the frogs   All I see are deleted Naruto threads and burthurt Narutards like yourself.  Keep crying.      No, your dream is over.  Our dream just can't end by now.     Now do this.     Summer?  This is the answer. The fact that the shit posters multiplied on summer is not a coincidence..      watching naruto    how mad did the narutofags have gone      Shin pls    Is okay, i don't mind the crazy janny. Is amusing how much effort you put posting in a thread you hate.     He's upset because his favorit ship got ruined  Which is?     I want her to have my children. I want her to be my woman. Her uchiha pussy is rare, there's literally no other like it in the world. I want her so badly.    I am not watching it you doofus  I quit watching  I just wanted to know if they did reach to that point  seriously because it was the only good part          Who is moot?    Also Bort would slap her shit before she even has a chance to start a REVOLUTION.     Sakura will be the biological mother   It's literally impossible at this point unless Kishi goes into maximum over-hackery.   Sasuke will show he cares even if he didn't show it for 12 years   You mean Sasuke cares enough about his child's babysitter enough to not want her to die? How romantic.          Black kid   Trying to find her daddy  Lol Fat fuck. Ain;t nobawdy yo daddy.      You'll have to wait until July 2nd. SP is still jerking off Coolest Guy with their filler.    The thing is, anon, that Boruto is the one who wants to start a "revolution" and Sarada is the one who wants to become Hokage.     It's literally impossible at this point unless Kishi goes into maximum over-hackery.   unless Kishi goes into maximum over-hackery.  dude      Sorry, but you are not a safe space for all genders and orientations to discuss Naruto.   <br/>    As the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura, she has already awakened her Sharingan. She has admiration for* Naruto.  *This verb can also mean "long for," "yearn after," or "be attracted by." Make of that what you will.      trusting the word of an SJW cuckold     Hypothetically speaking, what would happen if Sarada gets her hands on some of Naruto and Sasuke's DNA?    Oh, but it does increase.  Interesting.       If even now, the only evidence that Sarada is Sakura's biological daughter that one can appeal to is that Kishi has somehow has become or will become worse of a writer than he ever has been, then you don't really have any evidence, you just have a hunch.     ah, deliciously ambiguous moonspeak       muh moot boogeyman    m-moots selling us out guys    moot hates pedos THAT MEANS HES AN SJW    fuck off fag           kek  Bitch gonna lose her eyes if she ain't careful.     Frenchies where?   Nice, did you learn how to use those two words in a sentence today?      The frogs are gone. Dumbasses got themselves caught.    Doesn't really work that way since even Madara took more than a lifetime to mutate his Sharingan to a Rinnegan.     Wait what, how?       The trap and the Uchiha are the only ones the nips care to take a picture of   They are so predictable        not [muffled REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE in the distance].webm     how new r u?     you just have a hunch.  That exactly what it is, a hunch that tells me that kishi will play safe and the whole ordeal was a missunderstanding, etc. Shit, at this point I think its more plaussible that the whole matter will be dropped entirely, never to be brought up again, rather than have Sarada beign an experiment or Karin's daughter      There's also a Sunflower but it's of much shittier quality.    Reposting because you guys don't seem to grasp the hype of Gai the Third. Notice his much trendier bowl cut that's shorter on the back and who knows what secrets lie within that turtle neck.    Frankly, it wouldn't be worse than turning Itachi into a saint      Good sir, are you implying our Sarada would be smart enough to actually...HYPOTHETICALLY, get some of Jesus 1 and 2's DNA? That's impossible for 2, no 5 reasons.  1) Sarada's hatred isn't that deep. It's nowhere near sasuke's when he found out his big bro killed the fuckin clan. All his family etc. Hell Sarada's hatred is on Garra's level, she'll most likely just attack the village forcefully before getting owned, killed, talk-no-jutsu'd or all three.  2) Sarada is 12  3) Sarada doesn't have the Akatsuki backing her up and no she cannot "recreate" it cause no one would follow her ass.  4) Sasuke is a God  5) Boruto would fuck her in the ass long dick style if she misbehaves.              Who did Lee mate with?  TenTen?      Himself.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127141704   :(   lol   no tumblr they said       That appears to be a close up of the bigger picture   Chocolate goddess ain't in this movie?   Guy's leg bone budded off after he kicked Madara and 12 years later that kid appeared.    Honestly I'd rather him not be another Guy clone.     Boruto would fuck her in the ass long dick style if she misbehaves.   implying he won't do that anyway       implying   gais reproduce asexually     WHAT is that face    What if it's a zoom out of a smaller picture?    Then he would be weak!!    She's in the poster and she has a character design.  Though she might get a bit shafted given how she got to have more screentime in the gaiden than even Bort.      No.    He opened the 9th gate and a kid popped out of his wiener.   So what happens to Salad and the rest after Bort and Sauce go on their cross-dimensional road trip to save Nurudu?  Because as much as I'm enjoying Bort's shenanigans so far I wouldn't like to see best girl get totally shafted. Even if she just tags along to act as a medic would be better than nothing.      That exactly what it is, a hunch that tells me that kishi will play safe and the whole ordeal was a missunderstanding, etc.   But why would he play it safe? Why would he go through all this trouble just to pull out at the last minute? I understand he's not the best shonen writer, but I doubt he's that bad unless he just wasn't conscious of what he was doing this whole time.    Shit, at this point I think its more plaussible that the whole matter will be dropped entirely, never to be brought up again, rather than have Sarada beign an experiment or Karin's daughter   I wouldn't mind that actually.  But I don't think Sasuke being concerned for Sakura's well being is anything for SS to get worked up so much about. This is supposed to be the NEW and redeemed Sasuke. When Sakura shows up with a baby bump in another flashback or shares a kiss with Sasuke, then we can fret about it all being a ruse, but it still seems like Kishi is following through, just he's trying not make Sasuke look like a complete nig.               I'm glad they finally show her smiling in one of the promotional materials rather than pulling the "Sasuke face"   So should I ask the question?   It would be fair since he got shafted in Gaiden     Tron?      Jacket on   Jacket off       she was smiling in the first trailer.      I'm glad too.  Sarada is definitely a "deadpan-ish" kind of character in standard mode, but she also has a wide range of expressions That Kishi showed already.        But why would he play it safe?  Money. Karin being the mother could affect the sales of the upcoming Boruto movie. SS is huge on Japan and even 2ch is worried about the recent chapters.   Why would he go through all this trouble just to pull out at the last minute?  Forced drama to get attention for his shitty manga. What else can Gaiden offer? Akatsuki again? Uchihas ruining everything again? Sharigan for everyone?         But why would he play it safe? Why would he go through all this trouble just to pull out at the last minute? I understand he's not the best shonen writer, but I doubt he's that bad unless he just wasn't conscious of what he was doing this whole time.  Because Sarada learned her lesson. That's it. Note how when she found out the results of the test, neither sauce nor sakura where there to explain, only naruto, who TNJ her into loving her "real" mother. At this point theres no need to explain anything related to the DNA test and all that, Sarada arc for the Gaiden is pretty much completed     Mob   SPOILERS FUCKING WHEN? P O I L E R S  F U C K I N G  W H E N ?                        This is so fucking wrong, the question is: "What's Moot?" newfag.    First one's Sage of the six path, second is Nine-tails chakra mode    Is that really Salad's voice? Jesus christ    Tron Lines patern are still different.  It's just a case of Studio Pierrot not caring.      I wish Kishi had the guts and go for Karin being the mother.  I mean, he finished the main story. He can do what he wants now.  Or at least have Sarada being a test tube baby with Karin ans Sasuke DNA, Sakura would still "win" because the implications of Sasuke cheating Sakura would be invalid and Sakura would still be the actual mother figure to Salad, despite not being the biological mother.  That way everyone would be happy.          So basically Sauce before being mindraped into oblivion, but with just a tinge of edge thanks to her dad being a deadbeat shit?  Oh well. Thanks to Nurudu she's finally got some decent role models.      I can never tell when he's using six paths chakra mode     No, but Fire Guy is in the newest opening theme so he's coming soon     Second One has Naruto with the mixed Sage/Jinchuuriki eyes, either only right pic is Six Paths or both are and Studio Pierrot fucked up.    Or jacket on, off affects the lines.   So after this is over will there be a series with old man naruto and an adult boruto?   Mixed Eyes is a good indicator now since Goudoudamas have yet reappear.     Salad gets her Gaiden   it's filled with nothing but her suffering and tears   her father tries to kill her before he tries to hug her   she punts a toy Juubi and punches the ground kinda hard   ends with her daddy issues sorta resolved and Sauce smiles at her   might still be some cum and eggs Orochimaru smashed together in his basement of horrors   She definitely got the shit end of the stick.            If anything the whole thing with Itachi probably gives some precedent that tells us Kishi might just make Sarada belong to Karin. It could just be a matter of waiting for someone to reveal the motive and circumstances through some flashback. But that's just the way I feel about it.     Because Sarada learned her lesson.   But if you back out of making Karin Sarada's mom then Sarada never needed to learn that lesson to begin with.   Note how when she found out the results of the test, neither sauce nor sakura where there to explain, only naruto, who TNJ her into loving her "real" mother.   The only reason she was forced to learn that lesson was because Sakura was "revealed" to not be her biological mom. If she is her biological mom, then it doesn't make any difference whether she learned it or not and so putting her through the entire ordeal means nothing in the end.               It never did before, it won't now.  Naruto projected the Jacket out of nothing the first time he used it.  At least pay attention to the thing you are consuming.          This is why Sage Mode was Nurudu's only good transformation. Thank God his son doesn't have any of this neon wannabe SSJ garbage.       he doesn't think fem Sauce is adorable  nigga     Look for the tomoe things.    Basically Sauce?  She doesn't have an elder brother complex and his father despite beimg shit, he regarded Sasuke and was proud of him.  And unlike Sasuke, Sarada has a friend.  When this gaiden started, Sarada was even questioning what a ninja even though the academy graduation was very near (now she wants to be hokage, apparently). Sasuke already used to had a goal to become as good ninja as his brother, even when he was years younger than her.  She's only Sasuke in looks and genetics.            He could already combine sage mode and and nine tails mode before he obtained six paths     Impying Boruto couldn't pull one out of his ass if Kishimoto wishes.   Remember that Minato somehow learned to cloak himself while dead, and that kind cloak has nothing to with being a Jinchuuriki, otherwise all others like would have something similar, only Naruto's looked like that due his lineage.  In restrospect Minato should have never be able to pull it off, yet he did, while being dead.       Dubs general?   It's too late for dubs.     Naruhina was so pure that 774 now does Non-H vanilla    mfw reading those       Naruto projected the Jacket out of nothing the first time he used it.   Wrong. Right has his Hokage mantle and his jacket closed. Left doesn't have the mantle at all and has the jacket open. Idiot.     Where are the spoilers   Naruto's first version of the cloak, before befriending Kurama, also had the Tomoe.    he had half the kyubi inside of him      He's only got a little bit of Kurama chakra so hopefully that means no candy-coated deluxe super duper glow-in-the-dark transformation.  I'd be open to him learning Dragon or Toad Sage in the future, though.     I've always wondered why Sasuke/Naruto have never bothered learning how to open the Chakra Gates. It can clearly be learned and it's not an in-built ability - Lee, Kakashi, Gai, and Gai's dad (meaning Lee's son is Gai^4, by the way) were all able to do it.  Yes, they're already ridiculously strong, but I have a feeling that even Sasuke or Naruto would just explode if hit by a Ninth Gate-level Gai. At the very least, imagine a Fourth Gate Nine Tails Chakra Sage Mode Naruto.     All while Boruto gets  Be a ninja prodigy   Have a mother who understand your feelings   Have a father who's always there for you and gives you fist bumps   Train by Naruto rival   Gets a character arc about his family seeing how his father is a good dad   Gets to go fight moon people with the 5 kages and his master  Best Life ever           nice trips    Look man, nothing would make me more happy than Kishi making Sarada Karin's bio child, believe me, those fuckers are gloating and bragging like crazy. But I dont think it will. And you and I are going to have to deal with it, unfortunately. Its like when your favorite team losses: you put up with your friends jokes for a week or two, and then nobody cares     Yea totally XD    Because its difficult, for starters.  Also it's only good if you're doing nothing but taijutsu. Both Sasuke and Naruto incorporated ninjutsu in their fighting styles from the beginning, so it really wouldn't have benefited them THAT much.      Because Naruto is better at ninjutsu and Sasuke at ninjutsu and genjutsu.      Always there for you  Well...dunno about that. More than Sasuke was for Sarada, certainly, since that was 0%, but isn't Boruto pissed in the movie because his dad is rarely home?      Dont give Kishi anymore silly ideas.     So? I got a shirt that says "Believe It" I don't wear it but I have it.    Chakra mode is exclusively Kurama only among all the jinchuriki and Yin Kurama cooperated with Minato because Yang Kurama already folded to Naruto. That and Minato's already dead     It has nothing to do with the Kurama, the Tron Lines are from Asura.  Hence the impossibility for Minato     You fuckres ready for the most contrived MISUNDERSTANDING ever?    Kakashi   Where did he open a gate?      90% certain it is surrogate scenario    I know it's difficult. But that doesn't mean it couldn't be done, especially considering how batshit crazy Sasuke and Naruto are with their training.  They both use ninjutsu, sure, but they both also use, if not specific taijutsu techniques, punching, kicking, grappling etc.  It'd be broken as fuck, but hilarious for a short while.        Just like Dai and Gai before him, once Lee achieved maximum youth he budded a new bowlcut which grew into his disciple to continue the line.    Since he's been the Hokage he is busy but, he was always with his family all the time during when he was growing up and even now he try his best to still do.

Chakra mode is exclusively Kurama only     When he was doing that one-handed mountain climbing training. He slips, and it shows his opening the first Gate to surge up and grab the next handhold.    ? Are you accusing me of something?     oh, I get it now, sorry I guess is just kishi's laziness     I'm sure he'll bring back a souvenir. Maybe even let Salad touch his father's jacket sometimes maybe.   sarada   The time it would have taken would have been unrealistic. Lee and Might Guy are special cases.  Also anyone else using the gates would have stolen Lee and Guy's thunder HARD. That's the main reason. What if everyone started using Rasengan?      Hopefully not.   I forget - did Sasuke lose his Orochimaru Curse Seal, or does he still have it and just never use it?   Yeah, it was never clear how Asura did it. But, so far, Bijuudama has only been revealed to be a Jin-only thing so it's reasonable to think he was a Jinchuuriki. Of course, not Kyuubi's since Naruto is said to be the first to be friends with him.   Apparently one of the Shin jr's is big and fat.   His clones are always there for him though    It's useless since Susanoo gives him all the same abilities and much, much more.      Unrealistic  There was 12-odd years between the end of Shippuuden and Gaiden. Somewhere during that time they could've worked it out, especially since Kakashi, Lee or Gai could've tutored them.  Anyway, I know it won't happen. Just sayin' it'd be cool for a single fight.      Can someone with good Paint skills put glasses on this?   Oh, you're talking about post-Kaguya?  They're already Jesus-levels, dude. How many powers do they need?      Did I said that Sakura was injured with two knives of Shin father?   Well, at least Pink jobbed like a bitch and got hurt.     All of them, if they're not minmaxing harder than Kabuto they're not doing it right.    I don't think they ever implied it was a Jinchuuriki form. It just showing that Asura had a form that looked similar to Naruto/Kurama during his fight with Sasuke.    As many as Kishimoto can stuff into them before he gets bored of drawing. Whenever Naruto comes up against something he can't beat, Kishimoto throws a dart at a list of the words 'Tails', 'Chakra', 'Sage', 'Path' and 'Mode' and uses whatever he hits as the next power up. Whenever Sasuke comes up against something he can't beat, Kishimoto just adds a new level of Dojutsu power.     Yeah, it was never clear how Asura did it.  Seems clear enough to me. Asura is the son of a god, he trained hard and unlocked his birthright, Naruto's bond with Kurama only unlocked his powers from Asura's ancestry.      What if everyone started using Rasengan?   Jiraiya   Minato   Kakashi that one time        Was anyone expecting anything else.   Has the new trailer been subbed yet?     My wife is not that weak   You thought I was talking about Sakura?   Yeah... sorry  And then the Sauce was polygamous        Yes but the translation is shitty.    Your forgot Konohamaru.  Technically there's also all of the original Rookies when Naruto infused them with his own chakra to defeat Obito.      Well techically everyone can use Sharingan if they have original Uchiha eyeballs, available eye sockets and a surgeon.     dies   dies and comes back but then dies again   only does it that one time   Not to mention the regular boring Rasengan isn't that special. The Eight Gates are Lee and Guy's signature technique.  A better way to put it would have been, "What if everyone started using Rasenshuriken?"           &gt;ends with her daddy issues sorta resolved and Sauce smiles at her   This is going to be so shit along with her being a ok with her dad fucking of to train Burrito and not her along with Bolt getting the headband.  But hey what can you expect from an autistic mangaka?        I understand that there's still a good possibility that Kishi will back out of it. But I want to believe that he has a little more credibility than that. At least in other cases, he's shown that he doesn't just ruse for the sake of the ruse, such as when Tobi was "Madara" and then wasn't but Madara was still behind things in some fashion.  I know the tumblrites will praise it so long as they get what they want just as they praised trash like Legend of Korra. I don't care if Sasuke and Sakura are married or if Sasuke likes Sakura more than Karin, I just want a well written plot and I can't see it happening any other way at this point than making Sarada Karin's daughter and there's no logical means by which Kishi could say Sarada is Sakura's daughter.       Or even not eye sockets if you wanna dick around with Shin's genetics.    To be fair that is Asura himself     &gt;&gt;ends with her daddy issues sorta resolved and Sauce smiles at her   Sees him smile and feels nothing   It's too late   The damage is done   Time to crush the Leaf        Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions): https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true  Previous Thread: https://archive.moe/a/thread/127083<wbr>562/</wbr>   </wbr></wbr>   なせば大抵なんとかなる！  You're likely to succeed if you try!   As long as you never give up and you keep trying, you'll make it no matter what. Don't let that smug bitch Dekinai-chan be right about you! You CAN learn Japanese!      What cant I learn?   Study hard every day!     Is this whole explanation supposed to be satire? Because all it did is convince me the person writing it thinks he is a Smart Person and can do no wrong. I'd heard of the eoten bullshit but this is the first time I've seen this pastebin.   What does ちやんと mean? I see it all the time but I can't find it in the dictionary.   ちゃんと.    Haven't been following these threads closely. Why is Yuuna posted so much?       国語  She's studying it, why aren't you?       It's just a new meme. Doubt it'll last long, though. At least it's more motivating than some of the other DJT memes though, so who knows.    T-thanks...   I know i shouldn't learn kanji like this but i can't grasp an understanding of 丁.   チョウ, テイ, チン, トウ, チ, ひのと  street, ward, town, counter for guns, tools, leaves or cakes of something, even number, 4th calendar sign  i don't fucking know        It's just got a lot of meanings. You'll learn them as you come across them. Without context it's pointless to try to think of every possible context it could appear in.    Anyone up to work on fixing the typos in the grammar guide of the website or are we going to wait for corくん to slowly fix it up while everyone uses it in the meantime?    I've downloaded the docx and had a look. Google ruins the style formatting which makes it easy to mass alter sections and it keeps freezing up when trying to do any online edits. Would anyone be interested in adding corrections as comments in a plain google spreadsheet? I've sent an email to corくん with a link to the document so he/she/they can see corrections as they are posted. No email response but it was only a few hours ago. Having that DoJG reference fixed up and realized would be a useful page/document/pdf for every Japanese language learner. Haven't found any errors in the first 30 pages. I can probably work through a couple of concepts a day. There are about 600 total with one person looking through one every day or two a few people could work through it in a couple of months without much effort. If corくん doesn't respond at all we can/someone can/I can add the corrections to the local copy and have that uploaded on the djt website offline grammar link with whatever file sharing site.

Sporadic reminder that once you get going and take the basics from /djt/ you should stop coming here, as the ever present toxic atmosphere that infest this thread could be detrimental to your japanese learning!  Today I learned the words さまさま and てわけど from watching Hibike Euphonium  I've been to the /int/ japanese thread and it's full of Britain-fags pretending they're better than everyone else because they have bad teeth and can travel the entire length of their shitty country by foot in a single day.   I think I'll stick right here in the ultimate-shit-tier Japanese-learning thread on 4chins.  That is all, /blog.      What's the feeling of sentences that end with が? I usually see it with interjections or insults. For example, what's the difference between バカ vs バカが?   Top row second from the right means hole.   So, since it's summer and I'm more NEET than ever because I just dropped my job, I thought I'll go for something different. Gonna start doing 100 words each day on anki+crams before bed. If I end up finishing core2k in about 100 days from now then you cunts can stop arguing about how cramming is bad. Used to do 40-60 a day, retention rate is 75% - 80%.  Gonna have some fun frying my brains here you meme loving fucks.       I'll look forward to it. How will we know it's you?  PS. I'm on your side. I do around 60-90 words a day.       I'll do 100 cards a day   I'll finish 2,000 in 100 days  There are more important things for you to be learning right now.      You should probably use that extra time to look for another job, you lousy bum.    This is me, I think I'll really need a therapist after this shite. Good luck to all you anons here as well.     Gonna start doing 100 words each day   If I end up finishing core2k in about 100 days       It's almost like you need to see a card more than once to memorize it.     I don't understand what the problem is, there are 6000 cards in the pack, if I do 100 every day that will be 60 days which is two months or so. But if I finish the pack on the 60th day then not all cards are in a mature state, that doesn't mean to complete. Well, technically it does, but if I don't know all that shit then it's not done, so I think 100 days is just right.     Godspeed anon. May you return to us in one piece.    Ok I was reading the guide, and I know a bit. And I was wondering how to properly use Anki.    I know a bit of japanese. To be precise I am totally comfortable with the kanas and I know more or less over 200 kanji (kinda). Which isn't much.  But i feel I am stuck now that I know the simple writing and super common words. What should I do?         What should I do?  Follow this http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?id=5322</wbr>     thanks!    ケック   Do you ever lovingly look back at hiragana charts, thinking about how much progress and happy memories you've made?    shitty meme post   DJT in a nutshell.

You are going to try and learn all the 2000 main kanji in just 3 months?    I read Yotsubato ~3 months ago and after that started doing core6k. Haven't read anything since but it feels good when I read random manga pages posted here and can actually read them without furigana  I learnt kana like  4 years  ago so I don't have any kana charts left       download the core 2k/6k deck   read tae kim to understand how the language works   finish it   start reading native material   use DOJG for grammar   Or you could do shit like RTK and waste your time.           I guess it's a long shot to say that but I'll do my best nonetheless. I'm not an expert with that moonrune shit but if I write them down every day it might work out.     I used to do 100 cards. It wasn't that hard but anki sessions were longer though.   Every Japanese teacher (native Japanese) that I have met owns an electronic dictionary. At times they will need to check theirs for terms that they are unsure about.  So even a native Japanese teacher carries an electronic dictionary, don't you think we as 4chan students who are seriously studying Japanese have more reasons to own one?     Imagine most people here already have local dictionary apps on their phones to begin with    For people with android tablets/phones, JED is a great dictionary, it can figure out verbs if you type them in already inflected and it picks up romaji as well if you can't be arsed to type the whole thing.     I know i shouldn't learn kanji like this  There's your answer.  retentive-kun posted a lot of spreadsheet errors with the text "NOT OCRED".

Various versions of Core 6k, DoJG-deck, etc. Avoid 2-step if you don't know what it means. http://forum.koohii.com/viewtopic.p<wbr>hp?id=12704 - Nayr's Core5000 vocabulary deck. https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/ja<wbr>panese - Plethora of Anki decks, but recently purged of copyrighted material.</wbr> </wbr>  </wbr></wbr></wbr>     本 Can also mean origin, so it becomes origin of the sun, or land of the rising sun as Japan sometimes is called.    FAQ:  1) Does this thread belong on /a/? YES. The thread's justification is to turn people into scanlators and fansubbers. It's mod-approved.  2) How do I learn Japanese? / How do I type in Japanese? Read the guide.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1ynwmcFwy0ccT70cVRp-G97fYlcf-GYZ86T<wbr>62SvQMDdY/pub?embedded=true#h.3j2qq<wbr>m3  3) I have a question. That's not a question.  4) The Thread 404'd early. https://archive.moe/a/search/text/D<wbr>JT/results/thread/  5a) Imabi or Tae Kim? Please don't incite flamewars. If both are in the guide, there's not enough argument to prefer one to the other. Pick one and stick with it, or not. This goes for ALL "X or Y?" questions.  5b) How long does it take to learn Japanese? Several years. A few if you merely want to read manga. Twenty plus if you're aiming for post-fluencey.  5c) How do I find reading materials? Read the OP.  5c2) How do I find LEGAL, FREE reading materials? http://www.aozora.gr.jp/  5e) How do I choose which Kanji reading to use? Should I learn On-Yomi and Kun-Yomi of Kanji? This is an intermediate question. Both are useful. You don't need to understand how readings work, or even distinguish between them, until you can read with nothing but a dictionary. You shouldn't stress yourself out learning readings until you already understand them.  5d) How many words do natives know? Stop asking useless questions. This goes for all useless questions. LEARN JAPANESE.  6) What do I do now that I've read the FAQ and my question wasn't answered? Read the guide. https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1ynwmcFwy0ccT70cVRp-G97fYlcf-GYZ86T<wbr>62SvQMDdY/pub?embedded=true#h.1ci93<wbr>xb</wbr></wbr></wbr>                      </wbr>      </wbr></wbr></wbr>           But when 本 is origin, it's pronounced "もと"     日 = Sun   日 = Day   日日 != Sunday  It's a dumb language        <br/>     Yes, yes I can!     <br/>      If you take the like 400 means of every kaji in combination with compound kanji that means you have like 160000 different meanings from a single compound kanji, this is ridiculous.     Sure, but the meaning of the sign isn't limited to the pronunciation that way, 本物 (ほんもの) means genuine or real thing, not book thing   I think dekina-chan is undoubtedly best girl. She doesnt feed me any bullshit, shes just there to motivate.     This is why the "just learn vocab" mentality exists      it's also why teaching kanji in order of simplicity is batshit insane.   おちんちん大好きと言ったって何と思ったか   Come back when you can actually write a sentence correctly.   Can I recommend the Nihongo no Mori channel to be added to the guide?  https://www.youtube.com/user/freeja<wbr>paneselessons3  They have some English videos for N5/N4 so it's easier to get into now.   I wish somebody was there in my first year to slap me in the face for trying out Kanjidamage     </wbr>    Rikai firefox addon for android should be added to the guide too.  https://github.com/ispedals/Rikacha<wbr>n-Android/releases</wbr>    も - Mo' hook.  I've been going at Core2k/6k for almost 2 months now, but I haven't bothered looking into radicals. Should I worry about that?  When I look up 無 for example it says radical 火, but I don't really know how that works or how it helps me.
