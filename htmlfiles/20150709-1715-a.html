[ /a/, what is the most disturbing thing you've ever read/seen in a hentai?  <br/>  <br>this series</br>  <br>Not the one you posted.</br>  <br> loli on /h/ </br>  the one about Junko Furuta  Though I've probably stumbled upon worse things as the years have worn on, I think this is what broke whatever semblance of personhood I had left upon entering here.  <br> disturbing <br>Decapitation ceremony.<br>Nothing's really hit me like that before.</br></br></br>  this image seriously triggers me upon seeing it in the catalog  <br> Tags: defloration, guro <br>A little redundant now, don't you think?</br></br>  <br>I've never seen anything disturbing, because I know to avoid that shit.</br>  This one where this guy provides this assisted suicide service and this girl asks if he can make it so that she gets shot in the head, but stays conscious so that she can play with her brains as they fall out.  The shock didn't really hit me until a few days later. Fuck Quzilax.<br>Happy lolis are best lolis</br>  every time i think i read something deeply disturbing i find that months or even years later someone manages to top it with something even more horrifying. <br><br>but what disturbed me the most wasnt anything new i read. it was when i would come across it some time later and be able to fap to the very thing i once read that was once so horrible. <br><br>this is porn after all. one gets tired of vanilla, then you get tired of NTR. you go through all the fetishes at some point, coming across great artist or stories, given its all porn. but at some point you get tired of it all, since most of it is pretty much the same shit regurgitated over and over. <br><br>thats when you read shit that horrified you and you now find it erotic in an exciting new way. <br><br>like lately, i sometimes like to watch the first OP of future diary just to watch the part with yunos feet drenched in blood. it has become strangely erotic. the bare naked foor draped in blood. <br><br>no porn will ever be truly horrifying as the depth of people who continue to push those boundaries seeking to be even more shocking and erotic than whatever is the current champion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "I'M CUMMING FROM MY BROTHER'S DECAPITATED HEAD!" <br>I had a little chuckle there.</br></br>  <br>yeah it's easy to avoid the fetishes that would lead you to that shit, but sometimes you get curious.<br><br>as for me when I first came to 4chan I was greeted with the holes manga. Taught me all I needed to know about 4chan.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  Holes, so many holes, they feel so good to fill.  Your mother.  <br/>  <br><br>Care to explain anon?</br></br>  <br>I know this idea gets pushed around a lot, but you have to realize that not everyone seeks more and more fucked up shit. You have to admit you're just as fucked up. I mean I just go deeper and deeper into the world of dicks. I look at you sad saps with a healthy amount of pity, and not just because you're so wretched, but because you tell yourselves comfortable little lies about how everyone else engages in this pursuit of depravity.</br>  <br>Probably that one bara hentai where the guy has a rat go into his anus.<br><br>It was posted here when it was announced it was going to get an animation.</br></br></br>  I make sure to avoid the disturbing stuff.  <br>This is actually sad because you know it's real.</br>  <br>Holes manga? Is that the one where the chick gets a bunch of puss-filled holes on her ass in the train and then masturbates with them? I read half of that, now that I think about it. I guess that's my answer to OP's question.</br>  <br>For the love of god I need some source on this.</br>  <br> I mean I just go deeper and deeper into the world of dicks. <br>Is this not admiting to the same search for stronger stimulation that you're banging on against?</br></br>  <br>funny thing<br><br>years before I read that I had nightmares about my dead grandpa having large gaping holes throughout his body for some reason. Needless to say I wasn't amused when reading it.</br></br></br>  <br>Apparently it's a common dream, the holes thing.</br>  THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!<wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr>!!</wbr></wbr>  Cement girl  <br>Applicant for Death I think.</br>  <br>probably for the best<br><br>because the worst part of looking at disturbing stuff is not getting disgusted by it<br><br>its getting aroused by it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Applicant for Death is one of my favorites, but by my current standards it's quite tame.</br></br>  <br>I would reject the notion that guro is depraved in someway. Guro pursues a far more complex level of ecstasy than standard hentai. The mix of the pain of extravagant, visceral death coupled with sensual, thrilling eroticism gives the ecstasy an immediacy and finality which goes far beyond the basic levels of sexual ecstasy which is supplemented often with a betrayal of taboos of pedophilia and incest or whatever else in hentai.</br>  <br><br>The fear of holes is called trypophobia. It's quite common.</br></br>  <br>Thanks kinda anon!</br>  <br>Have to ask what your current standards are then.</br>  <br>What about apathy? because I get that a lot.</br>  <br>It's based on this and doesn't really hold back on showing the worst of it.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murde<wbr>r_of_Junko_Furuta</wbr></br></br>  <br>nah apathy is ok</br>  <br>I have to admit that I've seen a bit of the fucked up stuff, but it usually goes so far that it becomes silly.</br>  <br>I thought it was heartwarming.<br><br><br>Quite fucked up. Anything featuring gore and insect infestation (centipedes) is crossing the line.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This</br></br>  <br>I hate humans sometimes.</br>  <br>Fuck i remember this. It haunts me to this day.</br>    How come some of his hair is white ?  <br>Why the sad face faggot<br><br>IT IS  HAPPENING </br></br></br>  <br>Berserk armor aged him. too much strain. drained his lifeforce.</br>  HOPE thread.  how long as it been since we got on this boat  <br>No sad faces anymore, babe. Be happy!</br>  Griffith being crowned when?  Hi! I'm Asuka Langley Soryu! Charmed Huh!?  Tits or GTFO.  <br>You're telling me.</br>  <br>You wouldn't ask me to do something like that would you? I'm only 14 after all.</br>  <br>That's not a very Asuka-esque response, imposter.</br>  <br>Tell me about yourself! Why do you wear the headset!</br>  <br>Maybe I'm just in the mood is all. Stupid SHINJI doesn't kiss good and Kaji is always out and about. I just wish I had SOMEONE, ANYONE to talk to you know</br>  <br>Am I seriously at this point in my life where I'm going to pretend you're Asuka?</br>  <br>Not really</br>  <br>FUCK YOU</br>  <br>Oh you mean these? They're part of my suit of course! How else would I sync perfectly with my Eva. They itch a little bit but I don't like being apart from my Eva, so I keep them on to feel a bit more attached. Hope that makes sense!</br>  <br>I thought you wore the headset always to show you were skilled and able to pilot an eva</br>  <br>I do it for that reason too! It's like when any girl puts on makeup, they do it for their own self esteem and to show off! Haven't you guys ever talked to girls about that before?</br>  <br> Haven't you guys ever talked to girls about that before? <br>Look, you know where you are, right?</br></br>   German woman <br>Why should I be charmed? You're all either into scat or fucking dogs.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Begone, female Lilin. I am trying to woo your roommate.</br>  <br>Fuck off lemming-kun</br>  <br>Well, Stupid Shinji is taking a bath right now, I always see him on this website so I thought I would see what kind of people he talks to.</br>  <br>Take a wild guess.</br>  since when have RP threads been allowed?  <br>Post pictures of naked Shinji<br>I want to rape him while he struggles helplessly.</br></br>  <br>Are you saying I'm NOT the main character? Stupid Shinji and that DOLL certainly aren't interesting enough to be any main character.</br>  <br>The only one I'll be fucking is Shinji-kun.</br>  <br>You can have him. He is a terrible kisser and won't even be honest with his feelings for that doll freak. I need an older man anyway, would any of you happen to know someone like that?</br>  <br>Well, it is summer.</br>  <br>I recommend myself, personally.</br>   you will never rape Asuka   <br>Go to bed, Asuka.</br>  <br>ooh forward! Are you a man? I want someone like Kaji, older and incredibly intellectual and sexy! Someone who knows more than ANYBODY else and isn't afraid to let everyone else know! Not some scrawny apologetic nerd like Shinji!</br>  <br>Everytime</br>  <br> Are you a man? <br>So I'm told.</br></br>  <br>I will if you come with me Kaji</br>  <br>Damn right you never will, fuck off.</br>  <br>What would we do together??</br>  Why are ginger girls so ugly?  <br>Whatever we wanted to. Being specific ruins the fun, don't you think?</br>  Sooo, why are you a menstruating nazi bitch?  <br> You wouldn't ask me to do something like that would you? I'm only 14 after all. <br>Liar, you're only 13.</br></br>  <br>You think IM ugly? Yeah Right!<br><br><br><br>You wanna play Sega Genesis games with me? My school friend has a console and I like to play on it all the time!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's German. <br>There's a reason Germans started two world wars.</br></br>  <br>If we removed the headset, would you die?</br>   2011+4 <br> avatarfagging </br>  <br>Oh but you're not ginger. YOU'RE FUCKING ORANGEHEAD.</br>  Don't mind me, just stealing Asuka's Eva. Carry on.  <br>Sure, I'd play.</br>  <br>Well you aren't going to find out!</br>  <br>Asuka what do you think you are doing?</br>   this thread   <br>IM talking to my new online friends Rei! Something clearly YOU wouldn't know about because you don't HAVE any friends!</br>  <br>She's just embarrassing herself on the internet.</br>  <br> He is a terrible kisser and won't even be honest with his feelings for that doll freak. <br><br>W-what feelings? I don't know what you're talking about...</br></br></br>  <br><br>They've started again.</br></br>  <br> Well you aren't going to find out! <br>It's a meme, dear. They're very popular with the young people.</br></br>  <br>Who needs friends. I just want to do my job.<br><br><br>As usual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You guys are MEAN! I never thought someone like Stupid Shinji would hang around people with attitudes like this<br><br><br>Shinji you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about! Misato and I both know your little crush and it's so painful to watch you fumble around it. Just tell her already!</br></br></br></br>  Best asuka  <br>How dare you imply Shinji loves anyone other than me, you filthy lilin girl.</br>  <br>You're blocking my light.</br>  <br>Where do you think he learned to jerk off over your body?<br><br> He posted it all over /b/ as he did it.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Shinji is canon gay for Kaworu and no amount of waifufagging will change that  Fuck, are we seriously doing this?  <br>Daily reminder you should stop posting this because Kaworu is as straight as a ruler and doesn't feel that way about Shinji</br>  <br>I want to know what a wild, perverted sexual orgy between Rei, Yin and Yuki Nagato looks like.</br>  <br>We're just really good friends, that's all...<br><br>Oh, and you're a pretty lousy kisser too!<br><br><br>K-Kaworu-kun...</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>uh huh</br></br>  <br>I didnt think you were too bad Shinji</br>  <br>UGH you are SO INFURIATING! You only say that because you have no friends of your own, of course other than Shinji's Father. What a joke, being friends with your commanding officer HA! He's ugly too!</br>  <br>I only live to take orders, and he is the commander so I will listen and do my job.</br>  <br> posting non-canon things <br><br>Step it up</br></br></br>  <br><br>kaworu is a better kisser</br></br>  <br>Too bad you can't do your job AND be popular like me! What a waste</br>  <br>Who was the one who couldn't sync with her Eva again? Oh yeah, you. Popularity is something I don't need but it looks like on here they favor me over you.</br>  <br> I only live to take orders, and he is the commander so I will listen and do my job. <br>And you have no feelings for him whatsoever. <br>By the way, who do those glasses you stole, belong to?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>are people unironically roleplaying?<br>is this what /a/ is like?</br></br></br></br>  <br> are people unironically roleplaying? <br> is this what /a/ is like? <br>This is the funnest eva thread in a while.</br></br></br>  <br>Who the fuck are you and what have you done with the real Asuka</br>  <br>I know you are just as insecure as I am!

Such a freak.</br>  Boy, I sure do love reading manga and Light Novels. Sometimes Tokyo-3 can go weeks without an angel attack, so you have to find a way to get through the slow days at work.<br><br>Time to browse my favorite imagebo- What the heck is this?</br></br>  Daily reminder that all evangelion waifus are shit besides Misato and Maya  What does Asuka think about BBC?  <br>I'm a better pilot than you, Asuka.</br>  No white parent would give their child a ching chong name.  <br> Time to browse my favorite imagebo- What the heck is this? <br>What's Maya really like?</br></br>    <br>Where the fuck is my laundry?

The flagship of the fleet is the Aegis class Destroyer Ibuki. However on their way a girl with wings transported their fleet to another world. A fantasy world of Swords and Magic. Kuze's platoon was sent out scouting to see where they were. His platoon found and landed in the capitol of the United Kingdom. Kuze's platoon attempted to withdraw when there was an attack by the Firuborugu Empire on the capitol. However when children were in danger they protected them. The Empire regards them as reinforcements for the Kingdom!<br>On land and sea the power of the JDSF in the arena of warfare explodes!

Monsters and troops poured out of the portal, turning the shopping district into a bloody inferno. <br> The Armed Forces of the Russian Federation immediately took action and pushed the fantasy creatures back to the "Gate". To facilitate negotiations and prepare for future fights, the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation dispatched the Third Reconnaissance Team to the "Special Region" at the other side of the Gate. <br><br> Ivan Ivanovich Yezhov, a Russian Army officer as well as a 33-year-old mafia boevik, was appointed as the leader of the Team. Amid attacks from enemy troops the team visited a variety of places and learnt a lot about the local culture and geography. <br><br> Thanks to their efforts, although with some difficulties they were able to find use for the locals. They even had a cute elf, a sorceress and a demigoddess in their circle of new shestyorka. On the other hand, the major powers outside the Gate such as the United States, China and the EU were extremely interested in the abundant resources available in the Special Region. They began to exert pressure over Russia. <br><br> A suddenly appearing portal to an unknown world - to the major powers it may be no less than a considerable asset for overturning the international order. But to our protagonists it is an invaluable opportunity to broaden the consumer base, recruiting base, and ultimately the power of the mafia and themselves. <br><br>I think everything would be better this way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Putin claims there are no Russian troops in the Special Region.  <br> A passenger plane that crashed near the Gate site is said to have been destroyed by the inhabitants of the Special Region using magic, though the Gate is thoroughly controlled by Russian mlitary <br> The imperial government pleads the international community for help against russian invasion. <br> The russian television broadcasters as well as far left and far right politicians all over the world proclaim that the Imperials are actually fascists and eat children, though international investigation shows that basically Empire is a human version of Equestria. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Past thread<br><br>People should know how manga<br>and anime visual design works <br>when you see this<br><br>and this<br><br><br>(Cuteness + beautifullness + optionally sexy) is more important than inconvenient realism.<br>Drawing manga is like calculate the limit x-&gt;0 avoiding the indeterminate (divide by zero shits).<br><br>That is how this shit's visual design works.<br>If you complain about it so gb2 .</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When you've been reading the manga for so long, you get really used to it. The anime style is just jarring. I'll still enjoy it though.</br>  <br>Most of the Anime designs are obviously redesigns to be easier to draw for lazy animators, moreso than they are for style.<br><br>Notice only the characters with complex outfits got the redesign, outside of the 'we can't be bothered to do camo'</br></br></br>    <br> implying they wouldn't rape the elf, kill the sorceress and find a way to imprison Rory and study her for science </br>  <br>Almost. But I thought that was Dio for a second.</br>  <br>Me too dude. Found it in a russian Gate community</br>  ok guys i might have missed it but what happened to the pistol Pina was going to bring back from japan?  <br>Confiscated when they where going back through the Gate</br>  <br>It's a Chekhov's pistol I guess.</br>    <br>They took it from her at the Gate's border control.</br>  <br>requesting a drawfag to draw tuka lelei and rory in tracksuits squatting on a street corner with some gopniks</br>  <br><br><br>figures, that makes sense<br><br>Also, about Noriko, they said she was kidnapped by the empire during the invasion, but her parents were in ginza handing around missing posters... also during the invasion? Or did she run away from home before the gate opened or something?<br><br>Again I may be just dense or read through that part too quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they captured her before the opening of the gate, seems like they had a test run before.</br>  <br>I was talking about both anime and manga.<br>Pic related.<br>I hate to see SO MUCH TIME that logic being applied against anime and manga.<br><br>Fuck the inconvenient realism over the character visual design.<br><br>Also,<br>Both GATE design are ok for me.<br>I actually loved the Goombah's new design in anime GATE.<br>She looks like Futami Ami/Mami.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So they got through somehow in an as-of-yet unexplained way, before the gate opened.<br>And IIRC, rory mentioned that it was the god of the underworld that created the gate?</br></br>  <br>I agree.<br><br>Besides the blatant cherry picking I'll just complain about Kuribayashi if her new character design takes away from her fierce personality.<br>Same goes for Rory.<br>Right now I'm fine with it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which one of these girls is the one that gets gangraped by the army?</br>  I want to fuck a rabbit  <br>The Japanese one in Rome.</br>  <br>Before there is a full gate there is a small hole between the worlds.

She proves far too strong in bed for the men, sucks them all dry, and gains intel from them instead by threatening to hump them till they're dry of juice. <br><br><br><br>   After this scene, Furuta walks in and sees her naked, just fucked countless men who are all down and out. She screams and goes nuts, that her true love saw just her dirty she is and cries. (Furuta is too nice a guy for it to matter, but she's still a girl) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you reading up on spoilers for a show with just one episode? You guys are the worst.</br>  <br> his country's female soldiers don't moonlight as idoru <br>Must be hard living in Yemen.</br></br>  <br>Because most of us have been reading the manga for a long time and have been waiting on LN translations.</br>  <br>You should be waiting. Always waiting.</br>  <br>Waiting is boring.<br>Actually Gate is one of a few series where I'm not afraid of spoilers. I watch it for the sheer joy of witnessing it's events unfold. It doesn't matter If I know what happens next. It's not Another or Higurashi.</br></br>  <br>Don't you wish that evil on me!</br>  <br>I don't like his Mohawk hair either.</br>  <br><br>My main issue is I don't feel like he did anything heroic in episode 1. He was just sort of there and he was giving out random orders but it doesn't seem too different from what the chain of command would have said anyways.<br><br>He doesn't seem to have much personality yet. I am mildly interested in this for the girls, but I think the plot is going to be stupid and it will just be an inconclusive "adventure harem" that goes on forever without any romantic resolution, until everyone loses interest and the author is forced to finish it.<br><br>Nothing special.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because  it is not </br>  <br> My main issue is I don't feel like he did anything heroic in episode 1. <br>This so much. I didn't get what the big deal was. <br><br>Unless it's one of those things where the authorities created some "heroes" to trot on stage and give medals to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's contrary to your expectations. The author wrote this for himself and a few likeminded individuals. And he finished it. And then it got traction and numerous adaptations.</br>  <br>Ami?</br>  <br>What about her?</br>  <br>No matter how many times I see this, I'm still mad.</br>  <br> He doesn't seem to have much personality yet <br>I don't think he ever will have. At least in the manga, his personality is limited to being a lazy otaku.</br></br>  <br>Quite a relatable character isn't he?</br>  <br> his personality is limited </br>  <br>Daily reminder that she didn't get the man she loved and ended up as a JAV actress.</br>  <br>He didn't really do anything in the manga either. He just helped order troops around.</br>  <br>Oh, yeah, I forgot. There is being a retard.</br>  <br>Doesn't wear a toga in the manga either, though it does look a little more Roman than here. Late Roman though.<br><br>I'll be that guy and say this scene probably should have been handled differently. It's supposed to be kind of horrible but all these frames just give me the most raging of hardons.</br></br></br>  <br>Initiating rally of panicked citizens and gaining permission to rescue the refugees at the imperial palace are pretty extraordinary feats of fearlessness and steady decision making in extreme conditions.</br>  <br>This is true.</br>  I hate when they unnecessarily make an otaku the main character of a show  <br>Unfortunately, japan loves it.</br>  <br>Better than a teenager</br>  <br>At least he's somewhat believable and not a Gary stu</br>  Killing Roman soldiers (White pigs) and monsters (chinks and gooks) best day of my life :D  <br>He's got that "lazy doofus who becomes awesome in combat" thing going for him.</br>  <br> who becomes awesome at running away. <br>ftfy.<br>its his only specialty.</br></br></br>  <br>No monster girls no buy.</br>  <br><br>I can't wait for her to fucking destroy those palace guards.</br></br>  What is going on with MC mother? They skipped the visit in the manga.  <br>She's mentally ill.</br>  <br>He's an off duty JSDF that helped the local authorities handle an incomprehensible situation. He did save that one cops life (who was doing well until he froze up when the soldier rushed him) and then was the one to initiate the evacuation plan to get everyone inside the palace, even though it wasn't his place to do so. Then stayed with the completely unprepared first responders while waiting for the real force to show up and helped coach them in how to contribute to the counterattack better than they were managing on their own.<br><br>It wasn't heroic in some idiotic one man stand against all odds, he just applied his military training like any good soldier should have. That's the point. He lucked into the role of a hero just by doing what was right and within his means. Meanwhile what's his name was at the same event, saw the same shit going down, and just kind of said "fuck it I have doujins to buy" then kept it to himself out of embarrassment.</br></br></br>  <br> unnecessarily <br>It's the author's self insert character, you want something different write your own story.</br></br>  <br><br>Piña and drills are sexier in the manga. I loved that.</br></br>  <br>What's going on here?</br>  <br> Unless it's one of those things where the authorities created some "heroes" to trot on stage and give medals to. <br>I am pretty sure the story made that pretty blatant. The government needed someone to generate positive PR and had to find someone to give a medal to, and since they want the JSDF to look good because they are breaking their own rules to attack the Gate, they picked the JSDF member.</br></br>  <br>She killed the father in self defence, but went coocoo afterwards</br>  <br>interspecies erotica</br>  <br> I don't feel like he did anything heroic in episode 1 <br>He convinced the police in charge to stop redirecting people away and get them behind the Imperial Palace's reinforced doors. <br>Though without him the Emperor might have ordered it himself anyway because Emperor gonna Emperor.</br></br></br>  Bunny girls are for ________.  <br> wives</br>  <br>never forget</br>  <br>marriage</br>  <br>As long as she still fucks shit up, I'm on board.</br>  <br>Also the manga made it clear that Itami was going to stay an unknown person of no importance until the Gate incident promoted him. And that he is an unusual character who didn't want to be a hero. But that's usually the most interesting situation to put a character into; Itami does things differently because he isn't like the other guys.<br><br>And it is amusing to find out Itami is actually a personal friend of the Minister of Defence, who knew him since Itami was a teenager and the Minister a young politician who lost his first election.</br></br></br>  <br>Beyond mad</br>  <br>Aex enslaving</br>  <br>I don't she looks way too dirty.</br>  <br><br>In the narrative, did ever he identify himself as military during the incident, or did they think he was just a loud civilian? Or do they want us to assume he did?</br></br>  <br>He showed his military Id to them, something they didn't do in the anime</br>  <br> He showed his military Id to them, something they didn't do in the anime <br>Yeah, it seems the anime made the mistake of trying to make his status as JSDF officer a surprise. Bad idea.</br></br>  <br>In the anime they cut it out but it's clear he told the police who he was.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I forgot that.</br>  anyone here drawing the girls?  <br>Not you.</br>  <br>I've been experimenting with new line-art technique today doing a Delilah fanart.

Generic medieval court attire and a cape. What are the Dark Elves going to be wearing?</br>  <br>Only the most moe idol outfits.</br>  <br>...wait, how the fuck did they transport a frigate across land? I'd be easier to just build one!</br>  <br> tfw no matter how hard you try you'll never be as badass as your grandpa was </br>  <br><br>Come to think of it, they'd need to build a modern shipyard anyway to service it. This is an insanely large undertaking.</br></br>  <br>provide for your loved ones<br><br>be alpha<br><br>being a badass is a situational thing  but I wish I was </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's supposed to be a strong short stack of a woman you fucking designer. All I see is a fucking idol. <br>And the other girl is supposed to be a tall cute beauty. Again, just an idol. <br><br>ffffffffff</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's cute, I'll love seeing her wrecking shit.</br>  <br>You like to pretend she was this beefy tank in the manga but most of the time she was shown how she was described, as a short cute girl with a big rack. Her anime look isn't any more off model than everyone else in this.<br><br><br>This is cherry picking from a scene meant to make her seem more intimidating than she is at first glance, because that's her personality - not her appearance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>*cool beauty</br>    <br>She at least LOOKs like a soldier in the manga.</br>  <br>Here's everyone together to compare.</br>  <br>fuck, the inner gear queer in me is raging if they don't even get the hybrid assault shirt and the chest rigs right in the anime. <br><br>Also how many people remember that Itami was actually married?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll give you that, but they softened everyone for the anime.</br>  Inconsistent much.  Meanwhile the jolly green giant got totally fucking gypped.   <br>I think there is a difference between "Cute short girl with big breasts in the military" and "Cute short girl with big breasts who belongs in a high school anime"</br>  <br>It'll really come down to her personality. If they fuck that up, it's over. A couple of spunky screengrabs from the op are nothing to go by.</br>  <br>Because how she acted defined her character, not her appearance from one cell or another. We just need to give the anime time to let that happen.</br>  <br>I'm gonna miss our feisty titty monster.</br>  <br>She look pretty lively here  and in the OP, it also look like she's jumping and she definitely has two nice knockers.</br>  <br>Yeah I'm not in love with her anime design but it her general 'look' was often the least consistent of any of the characters to begin with in the various earlier iterations so I'll probably live with it. Though I think I'd prefer closer to pic related.</br>  kind of rather read story about ship gate than this gate  <br>Guys<br><br>GUYS!<br><br>What if the anime takes away Delilah's big fat rabbit tats?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>then we riot</br>  <br>Piña Colada now actually looks 16 years old so maybe Delilah will stay the same?</br>  <br>Who let this high school girl into our army?</br>    <br> His platoon found and landed in the capitol of the United Kingdom. <br>wait what</br></br>  <br>More Zipang when?</br>  Mermaids when?  <br>I think part of a character in a visual medium like this is in their presentation. I could believe the type of character from the Shino in the manga because she looks the part even with her proportions  her height that is <br>But anime Shino looks like some middle school anime character and it's not fitting in with the previous iterations of the character. Nor her supposed role as squad powerhouse. All of the women in this series suffer from this weird "anime" remodeling and it's unnecessary unless you're trying to bait otaku.</br></br>  <br> how the fuck did they transport a frigate across land </br>  <br>Actually you do it by parts and ensemble it at the other side</br>  <br>*assemble</br>  I read the manga but I still don't understand who are those guys using Fate codenames and why Itami also uses a codename. And looks like Itami is shit given they call him Avenger.  <br><br> who becomes awesome in combat <br><br>Clearly, you haven't read up to the part of the manga where it's revealed he has Ranger and Spec Ops certifications.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah that</br>  <br> Which one of these girls is the one that gets gangraped by the army? <br><br> - bunny girl<br> - harpy girl<br> - jap girl</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And all the times some subordinate questions a tactic and he briefly reveals how deeply he's thought of the situation at hand is actually pretty competent, just fucking lazy since he's only really there to support his hobby  and his fujoshi ex wife that he'll probably end up with after all this is over </br>  <br>She's never met an honest and gentle human male before (since pretty much only human male she's known are all rapists and killers), and started to fall for Furuta.</br>  <br> that surprise box <br>There's plenty of top quality other-world women he can pollinate, and who aren't broken fujoshi. (Miss Mexico is a functioning fujoshi, by contrast.)</br></br>  Would you a Bozes?  <br>Furuta is one of those "what the fuck are you doing in military?" kind of guy</br>  <br>After or before giving birth to a child? Fresh or milf?</br>  <br>and his answer would be "I ask myself the same question"</br>  <br>They didn't do a good job in the anime, but he basically guided the civilians to the palace. (Ginza to the palace bridge is a 3 mile run)<br>He also took charge of giving out commands to the police fortifying the palace gate. <br><br>The anime just did a shitty job with a lot of depictions in the first episode. Lack of casualties, lack of explanation, of what he did or how Japan handled the political side of the aftermath, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br> pacifist <br> let's train him to shoot! <br><br> incapable of lying <br> let's send him in as a spy! <br><br>JSDF plz</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not until after season 1 ends. <br>They're the first focus after season 1.</br></br>  <br> mfw even the muscular male d elfs wear moe idol outfits </br>  <br> There's plenty of top quality other-world women he can pollinate <br>But he won't because he's a loser like that.</br></br>  <br>It seems to be working out for them in Gate so who are we to judge?</br>  <br><br>If I were him, I'd be all over Kuribayashi. Short, stacked, soldier chicks are hot.</br></br>  <br>Understandable though, if we did all that we wouldn't be into the gate until the 3rd ep which is not what this series promised.</br>  <br>And she really wants to shag a ranger. Too bad she doesn't dig his vibe at all. She'd be a great choice.</br>  <br>T-Thanks...</br>  <br>They managed to explain it better in like three pages of manga. The first episode just had some questionable direction.</br>  Does the manga have better fight/massacre scenes? <br><br>Because Ep1 was left a lot to be desired.</br></br>  <br>Three pages can be fifteen minutes.</br>  <br>The manga has a lot of action and gore. You will not be disappointed in that regard.</br>  <br>cool.<br><br>Not sure why they neutered the action so hard in the show. What's the point of showing bullet holes through people if there's no blood. And why bother cutting away at so many points. Fucking kills a potentially good scene.</br></br></br>  <br>It could also have been thirty seconds done slightly differently.</br>  <br>If it's going to happen (questionable), it'll be on the BDs.</br>  I just had a horrible thought. What if thy weren't done with Rori, and instead of just changing her look to be more anime palatable they also turned her into some generic tsundere?  <br>My worst fear is it turns into a generic harem and everything is solved through the power of boner</br>  <br>That vision does not point to good things.</br>  <br>I don't think so. The intro was pretty lengthy in the novels.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she can whip him into shape.  She probably fucks with the force of a steam locomotive with no brakes. </br></br>  <br>Yes. And the manga did it just fine in a shorter span.</br>  <br>Like I said man, different media.</br>  <br>So you really think that even just a few minor changes to the first episode wouldn't have made it more clear? Like letting him answer the cop when they asked who he was, or two seconds of him directing the crowd toward the castle?</br>  <br>I get you and I also don't agree with the stupid surprise reveal the anime was going for.<br><br>But besides that the anime did well since the first half was establishing Itami's character during the invasion and the second half was all about justifying the JSDF's entrance to the gate.<br><br>It's fine for what it is stop bitching man. Yeah there's niggles but they did just fine.<br><br>The manga can be faulted as well. It didn't cover that the invasion took 7 days or that Itami explained the move to the Imperial Palace in full detail after a good look at the empire army's weapons.<br><br>But no one's bitching.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This. I'm just gonna enjoy the ride and watch the /k/ and /pol/ folks funpost at each other. Gonna be comfy as fuck. Someone hand me a frilly umbrella drink.</br></br>  <br> well, 2d dark elves are usually like this <br>Should change that to "japanese dark elves"<br>No one else does this shit</br></br></br>  <br>Elves aren't dark in western media anyway.<br>They're either Irish or bleached as fuck</br></br>  <br>Don't tell that to the Drows.</br>  <br><br>Might you be expecting a  Pina Colada ?</br></br>  <br>western media aren't nerds</br>  <br>He's really missing out on this.</br>  <br>Kuribayashi is best girl</br>  <br>/tg/ says you're wrong.</br>   These guys again. <br><br>Being the senior NCO is suffering.</br></br>  <br>It's like Gate meets Zipang.</br>    <br>too bad zipang will never get translated, the anime had such a shit ending</br>  THAT conversation was hilarious.    <br>There's always portage</br>   Show has 2 ED's   <br> ED has 2 drummers </br>  what's the biggest mindfuck plot twist you've ever experienced /a/?  <br> pick unrelated </br>   There was an skeleton inside MC all the time   <br><br>Wait, was this all just a teppu crossover? I dropped titans early on.</br></br>      <br>When I realized your mother was sexually attracted to me.</br>  <br><br>too bad she's still utterly useless even after she recovers.</br></br>  The entire manga.  <br>Not anything in SnK. That's for sure</br>  <br>is this supposed to be devola and popola?</br>  <br>that shit was obvious as hell</br>  <br>Let me guess... you could foresee Bert and Reiner?</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>There's a Hotline Miami manga?</br>  <br>Yeah, it is. Not really /a/ related but it through me for a fucking loop that's for sure.</br>   the walls are made of titans!!!!!!!   <br> Super exaggerated Muay Thai stance. </br>  <br>Those arms couldn't protect her face that's for sure.</br>  Nothing ever twisted a plot so hard like the Beheading Baboon did.  <br>Highest bar of tweest in any media</br>  <br>That was disappointing. I was hoping she would jump up to the best or second best assassin in the class and have a revised personality but in the end nothing changed.</br>  <br>It's for muh elbowing and muh thaiclinch.</br>  <br>I wasn't impressed with the game. I played through all four endings, and I just don't get why people like it.<br><br>Kaine's backstory is fine, but was clearly thrown in because it took no effort and just muddled the rules about shades. The backstory added to the four bosses was advertised to me as being really deep, but ended up just being silly. The additional endings weren't different as much as the game made you reply the last third of the game four times in order to see the actual, full ending.<br><br>I read through the whole supplementary material and it just wasn't as thought out as I expected. Like, there's no real twist,  shadowlord is real Nier and the Nier you play as is a body intended to be inhabited by him in the future.  That's not a huge twist, and it's made worse that all the magic and shit is never justified by technology or anything.<br><br>Like, I understand the shit about the pacts and how that allowed for magic to be used and all of this, but it never feels like the world could honestly be a continuation of our own. It just felt flat, much like many of the design choices in the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That VN made me cry like a little girl and threw me for loops years ago.</br>  <br>even Dragon Ball z had bigger twists than this shit</br>  Probably this.    he came from the future    <br>you're right OP<br><br>I couldn't have predicted how boring AoT would be<br><br>zzzz</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It blew my brains out so much. <br>I was literally was rolling flat on the floor  crying  and hugging my laptop</br></br>  <br>Once it was revealed titans could be humans it was pretty obvious the colossal and armored titans were shifters. Them being two previously very minor characters no one gave a shit about before doesn't make suddenly make it a "mindfuck plot twist"</br>  <br>that was pretty freaky, forgot about that.</br>  <br>If you're not familiar with Drakengard canon, then you may not get as much out of it. That being said I disagree with a lot of your points anyways and some things are just a matter of opinion.</br>  <br>OP here that post was not me</br>  <br>Reiner was super obvious and Bert made sense once you realized all the titan shifters constantly hung out together</br>  <br>That killed me, quit anime for nearly an hour</br>  <br>is this really worth playing? I know everybody gushes over it<br><br>are any of the other  translated  games in the series any good?</br></br></br>  Tobi was actually Obito.  <br> Highest bar of tweest in any media <br><br>That's not  Zero   Escape   Three </br></br></br>  /thread  <br>Yes, it starts out as slice of life but then it fucks your mind like no other.<br><br>Remember11 has perfect pace but  there's no ending <br>I didn't like Never7.<br><br>You might want to try the Zero Escape series first  the last game of the trilogy was just announced recently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Punchline</br>  <br>That was storytimed a short while ago wasn't it? I remember occasionally checking it and every single panel was mindfuck after mindfuck.</br>  mind = blown  <br>This recently.<br><br>I still need to find out the true ending.</br></br></br>  Naruto had sharingan all along.<br><br>This means the main romance is actually incest; took me aback.</br></br>  Homura was  _____a huge nerd_____   Everything about SZS's ending  <br><br><br><br><br>these are all just regular plot twists, there's no mindfuckery in any of these.<br><br><br>is the only actual mindfuck in this thread (that I recognize) since it completely shakes up the entire show that came before, shatters the expectation of the viewer and opens the show up to the nonsensical shit that happens in the rest of the show.<br><br>Punchline might be close but at the end of the day it all makes sense once they explain things, whereas Flamenco is literally god fucking with the protagonist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've played through both ZE and really liked them. I knew he wrote those but I just never got around to it, I will know though. Very excited about ZE3.<br><br>In the same vein,   was written by him too, right? I started the first two episodes but I've heard it gets pretty insane, I guess it's time to finish that too.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>No son, that's called an "Asspull."</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're not just shitposting, feel free to explain yourself.</br>  <br>Punchline isn't Uchikoshi's best, cramming a 60 hours game into 12 episodes felt too bare boned and the real ending is actually in the game version.</br>  Incestuous relationship with her sister.<br>The plot is really twisted now.</br>  <br>the game was developed after the series right?<br><br>had he written the game and it was just picked up for a series or something?</br></br></br>  I really didn't expect the  purest love .  I've pretty much watched most pleb tear stuff. How do I get started with the good stuff? I enjoy most genres but action is my favorite. What does /a/ suggested or is there another website with a list ?  <br> he written the game and it was just picked up for a series <br><br>Yes. The producers apparently decided to make an anime in the middle of the game's development.</br></br></br>  <br>The greatest twist I've ever seen that's for sure.<br><br>Clearly you don't understand what an asspull is.</br></br></br>  <br>Off topic, I just want an excuse to post this again:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Z1I<wbr>VT3a3AAc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> fake subs <br>I am tired of seeing this posted, and people taking these as Miyazaki's words.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QRM<wbr>HrlxJRxc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>At least post the correct twist.</br>  <br> tfw you were being rused 99% of the time </br>  Most stupid? Yes.  <br>Hotline Miami: Alien DLC looks sick</br>  <br>Because it's earth that literally acquired magic only when a dragon and a dark god fell through a transdimensional portal over Tokyo.

One day we'll have YYS S2. I'm sure of it  The best day of the week.   Kinema Citrus does Gochiusa S2 instead of Yuyushiki S2 <br>It's ogre, guys.

It's the leadoff to a retarded argument without any substance. Nobody's stopping you from discussing the show or even criticizing it, but if you want to, be specific with complaints.</br>  <br>EHH? NANDATTE?</br>  Where were you when Yuzu killed God ?  <br>We all killed God.</br>  <br>Fine. It was boring. Fucking boring. The pacing was slow as molasses, none of the jokes were funny and it seemed obvious to me that they were running out of ideas with the massive increase of yuri undertones that weren't even there at the start of the show. The characters couldn't be any less original, with pink "I'm so genki but actually smart!", blue "I'm always dozy" and "secretly a rich person with a castle near the beach for the dedicated episode" and finally yellow "I'm so tsun tsun but I actually love you guys awuuu". Not even going to mention the side characters that are about as flat as their relevance in the show.<br><br>In the end all this show did for me was teach me about paki ice cream.</br></br></br>  <br>You obviously went in with non-SoL expectations. Should've just stuck with your SAO and DBZ then, chap.</br>    <br>I don't really dispute any of that (aside from it being boring, which is a completely subjective assertion based on personal preferences). I watched it and liked it for the atmosphere, which, personally, I enjoyed quite a lot. I didn't really go in expecting super original characters or fantastic humor, since SoL shows in general usually don't have much of either.</br>  <br>Hey, I was expecting some entertainment value, the same other SoLs I've watched before had. I didn't mention "comfyness" or whatever because it's totally subjective (just like enjoying Naruto is subjective mind you) and in the end it's just an excuse like saying Mirai Nikki was good because it was "fun".</br>  <br>The problem is that "entertainment value" is too broad and subjective. You having a different value system has no bearing on the quality of Yuyushiki whatsoever. If you couldn't find anything enjoyable about quirky high school girls interacting then that's your problem, not the show's.</br>  <br> The pacing was slow as molasses <br>It's SoL what were you expecting?<br>The pacing was appropriate.<br> yuri undertones that weren't even there at the start of the show <br>Now I'm convinced you didn't really pay attention, it's there from the start.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I didn't mention "comfyness" or whatever because it's totally subjective <br>Atmosphere is kind of quantifiable, though, and is usually fairly related to asserted "comfyness". Some shows like ARIA are widely considered great-tier because they do atmosphere really, really well. I'd say that Yuyushiki isn't quite at the same level of execution of atmosphere, but it's still pretty well done.</br></br>  <br>What other SoL anime did you like? I suspect that Yuyushiki is a bit more polarizing than the rest of the genre.</br>  <br>S1 Keion, Yuru Yuri, Nichijou, GTO if that counts, Haruhi.</br>  <br>Those lean more on comedy than sol.</br>  <br>That's probably it then. I gave Hidamari sketch a try too and was bored for the three episodes I watched. But I can still see why people like it; no clue for YYY.</br>  <br>I'm almost positive Gakkou Gurashi will be more your thing.</br>  <br><br><br>It's probably worth making the distinction between sol and iyashikei, despite their overlap. Too easy to end up talking about slightly different things.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah nigga, what?<br>What a surprise.</br></br></br></br>  What you drinking tonight /yys/?  <br>having some nice kombucha in p-town.</br>  <br>Water.

Yuzu and Yukari just like messing with Yui and she likes hanging out with them. <br>Yuzu asks to kiss Yui in the first episode.<br>Yukari doesn't have a beach house.</br></br></br>  <br>it's cool that you didn't like it or whatever but i don't think we needed a rant about the things you don't like in SoL.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphi<wbr>sm_(religion)<br><br>Orphism is an ancient Greek religion that carries ascetic practices and "worships" Dionysus, Persephone, and the poet Orpheus, three figures that all went to Hades and returned.<br>Orphists believe that human souls all contain a factor of Dionysus, as he was eaten by the Titans, and humans were born of the aftermath of Zeus destroying the Titans.<br>They also believe that people are "reincarnated" in a way  that I don't understand  until they are released from the "grievous circle" and have communion with the gods.<br><br>Neat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I like that, that human souls are somehow inherently related to gods and demigods, and that we're not completely profane.</br>  <br>I'd go to Hades and back for Okaasan!</br>  <br>Remember to not look back.</br>  Who rewatch here?  <br>Me last week.</br>  <br>Man, the first episode is the worst compared to how fun the rest is.</br>  <br>I enjoyed every episode, though I have rewatched for about 5 times.</br>    <br>Yuyus are always better with glasses.</br>  Fumi!  <br>Some knock off chinese vodka</br>  <br>Tooheys New again brah.</br>    <br>Thats lewd</br>  what did /a/ think of this?  That's a horrible resolution, try again.  I'm watching it right now, I'm at episode 15.<br><br>I like it. Kaori is a cutie and the characters are all good, but god damn the amount backstory and flashbacks while the guys are playing are fucking annoying. There are other ways to show the backstory and I'd rather listen to the fucking music.<br><br>Also, picture for ants. Stop fucking up, OP.</br></br></br></br>  More like you die in April  Kaori dies  Pretty good, better than the manga since you actually get to hear the music.  <br>Pretty much everyone here agrees it's bad, and I don't agree with them. It's not terrible or bad, it's just average or mediocre.<br><br>See, leaving the whole "it's popular so we don't like it" meme aside. It's poorly written, characters are boring and they keep them floating with melodrama.<br>The plot is normal I guess but instead of focusing on music they keep focusing on the cheap melodrama. Focusing on music a bit would be better<br> oh she's dying! <br>'k I don't care, her character has no personality aside from being sick. <br><br>Seriously it's like i'm watching a soap opera trying to force "feels" out of me every second.<br><br>Also the end<br> I always liked you but I lied I liked your friend 'cause I was dying teheee~ <br>How retarded is that? It's like the author wanted them to be a couple somehow so he/she just put that in there so that people would cry and say <br> Oh they would have been a couple!  <br> She was always in love with him but didn't tell him for his sake! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking HELL MAN!!!!</br>  <br>People on /a/ have shit taste. This show is at least a 8/10.</br>  <br>Why? Because it tries to force feelings out of people with cliches? How that makes it a fucking 8?</br>  <br>I agree with this post, mostly, except that I don't think Shigatsu is a bad anime, it's quite decent most of the time, when it's not trying to force melodrama and is mostly about a guy overcoming his trauma through music. That's why the second part of it is so awful. He already overcame the trauma with his mother so obviousdly the writers had to milk this shit and started to force muh sad stories. Also I fucking hated the childhood friend girl, can't even remember her name. And the end was godawful. But the entire thing on average was okay, good first part with great conclusion, awful second part. <br>Awful girls too, except the other girl that played piano. She was fine.</br></br>  <br>Its funny how the manga is kinda ugly, but the anime uses the designs almost exactly and everything turned out beautifully.<br><br>I cried like a bitch</br></br></br>  AOTY. It was really fun to watch even though it was cliche'd as hell  <br> so obviousdly the writers had to milk this shit <br><br>They could have milked it way harder if they really wanted. It's a short series. I was actually hoping for more to do with the rivals.<br><br>It also didn't pull the almost impossible miracle out of its ass for a happy ending, which is a change from the norm</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Spoiler you dirty nigger, why did I even come into this fucking thread?</br>  still mad  I usually like these types of stories but this one was not good.<br><br>Characters being middle schoolers completely kills any real sense of drama especially given the seriousness of some of the issues. A kid with serious PTSD should not be pushed into facing his trauma by his fucking friends. The whole first half just felt really stupid because of this. It's one thing to have the usual friends helping MC get better cliche but it's a whole another issue when the MC is facing some serious psychological issues and the anime just glosses it over as something you get over because muh kaori. <br><br>The characters aside from MC's childhood friend were also really not that well fleshed out. It wasn't a bad anime but it could've been so much better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>so, better or worse than Nodame Cantabile?</br>  <br>it was meh</br>  <br>Shigatsu didn't have to go to France to make me care about it. It's objectively better.</br>  It falls somewhere in the middle of how much /a/ hates it and how much other places love it.  <br> It also didn't pull the almost impossible miracle out of its ass for a happy ending <br>It did the complete opposite, it forced  Kaori to die  so that Kousei (MC) could finally "grow", because for some reason, as stated by his aunt, he needed to lose someone else to evolve, which didn't make any sense.</br></br>  <br>They were third year middle schoolers in japan, so about highschool freshmen here. It was about right with the retardation of freshmen, but with the retardation of being Japanese on top of it.<br><br>Also japan's stance in general on mental health issues</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck no. Nodame is miles ahead of this in quality.</br>  It's okay.<br><br>I generally liked MC and his development, but Kaori just seemed like a plot device and her death flags were evident since episode 2 or someshit. Though some of the comedy did crack a smile, it felt very awkward and frequently broke pace of the show.<br><br>I also was driven insance by the soliloquies each character would have during the piano performances. It felt unnecessary and didn't let the show speak for itself. Melodrama being melodrama I guess. Last episode was nice though.</br></br></br></br>  anything to watch after seeing it?  <br> QUALITY </br>  OP1 was the best thing about it and all of last year  I hated the MC  <br> Though some of the comedy did crack a smile <br><br>This was really bad. Some of the comedy was just very ill-timed. The general transition between comedy and drama was off for the majority of the anime.</br></br></br>  The flesh of the walrus is succulent and sweet, but it's cruelty knows no bounds.  <br>You mean ED 1, now that's the fucking shit right there.</br>  <br>Did you read the rest of that sentence before posting?</br>  <br>I did. I was agreeing with you. I just forgot to include the rest of it in greentext.</br>  <br>Keep watching the last episode until you become numb to feelings.</br>  <br> AOTY <br> cliche'd as hell <br>pick one only.</br></br></br>  <br> being this easy to please. </br>  <br>Determining the quality of animation is always compared to other shows during its time dumbass. Of course shigatsu would be more visually appealing, It was just out a 2 seasons ago. No anime's quality can withstand the test of time.</br>  <br>Even back then, it looked like shit.</br>  the show was mediocre melodrama but the first OP was GOAT<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=IeJ<wbr>TNN8_jLI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Whoops, lost track of how old that thread was.<br><br>Kancolle Play Manga: Kankan Biyori<br>Chapter 27<br>The Admiral and Arare's Memories<br><br>Page 21<br>Panel 1<br>TTK: Arare...<br>SFX: Waves<br><br>Panel 2<br>Nenohi: NENOHI ATTACK!!<br>SFX: Whack<br>TTK: Woah!?
