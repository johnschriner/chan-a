Just my imagination~.” <br> “Katou?” <br><br>Is she in love with Tomoya?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She herself said she wasn't in love with him in volume 7.  Or so Tomoya thinks. </br>  <br><br>But /a/ told me that she was evasive and a liar and that she really is jealous of Eriri.</br></br>  <br>Of course she loves him, silly anon.</br>  <br>Now this is scary</br>  <br>Really most of those things said about her are just assumptions or different interpretations, but she isn't really a liar. It's undeniable that she likes Tomoya and has affection for him. However she seems more concerned about her broken relationship with Eriri, so her jealousy and possible romantic feelings probably have less weight.</br>  <br> However she seems more concerned about her broken relationship with Eriri <br><br>What if she completely botches making up with Eriri and Tomoya is the only one left to comfort her? That might happen next volume.</br></br></br>  <br>Is she really wearing just a shirt? What happened to her pants?</br>  <br><br>She's probably at least wearing panties. She stayed the night.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I would be able to sleep that night</br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised, making up with Eriri isn't easy. I guess it would finally be the trigger for her romantic feelings to start flowing.</br>  <br><br>She sleeps in his bed regularly. He probably goes to sleep with her scent still on it.</br></br>  <br>When Utaha said in the epilogue about everyone must understand Eriri, I don't know why but it sounds that they are (Utaha and Eriri) getting cocky for me.</br>  <br>Tomoya is a lucky bastard.

She doesn't like being seen naked.</br></br>  <br>Because she's pure.</br>  <br>That explains why we barely saw any fanservice of her.</br>  <br><br>That's good.

She doesn't need shameless fanservice to grab the fans' attention.</br>  <br><br>Name a way in which Megumi is not pure.</br></br>  <br>But what caused that scene was Tomoya's rant about her cousin.

The everyday lives of the nine super-powered siblings of the royal family are monitored by more than 200 surveillance cameras and broadcast nationwide. The people of the nation who are watching the broadcast will have the ability to elect the next monarch. Akane is the third-oldest sister who can manipulate gravity. She is shy and desperately does not want to be caught on camera.  Seems that maybe me and OP will watch the stream since anyone being silent about this show.<br><br>Oh well.</br></br>  <br>Was watching the Laplace stream, besides there's still an hour to go and that sabage show in 30.</br>  <br>Yeah, I was pretty excited for this show, I'm sort of confused as to why nobody else is. Unless &gt;Laplace. <br><br>Also, is it just me or is CC down?</br></br></br>   HanaKana as the lead <br>Oh well, I did watch and enjoy Saekano despite Matsuoka.<br><br>I'm good to go.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I checked the archive and found that CC is dead. RIP</br>  Akane is the cutest, Scarlet Bloom too<br><br><br>CC has been dead for a while unless he came back without me noticing. Neetball is the new. <br><br>As to why people aren't interested, no idea honestly. It's a kirara series so I expected a few more maybe, though it only has something like 3 chapters translated so maybe that's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shuu and Satou are best OTP. Kanade's a cutie too.  <br>Maybe because subs are not ready for new season</br>  <br>Shouldn't stop people usually, there's plenty of things being discussed that still only have funi for subs.<br><br>Some group might pick it up after it's aired too. No idea who though.</br></br></br>  <br>Funi hasn't even released any of their new simulcasts this season.</br>  Don't worry anon, I'm in for this  <br>And stuff is still being talked about? There's plenty of people on /a/ who watch the livestreams. I'm watching it right now.</br>  Manga is finally scanlated. First 3 chapters are out since yesterday  <br> I'm watching it right now. <br>I thought it didn't start until like 20 more minutes</br></br>  So wait which stream should I be watching? Sorry I haven't watched a livestream for a while so no idea where I should be looking.  <br><br>People can't really talk much about the shows without subs, don't you notice how /a/ is slow as fuck, new season /a/ is usually fast</br></br>  <br>Who picked it up?</br>  <br>Some survival game show is on, it's alright. This is on after.<br><br><br>People still talk about the source and just random shit. This is strangely slower than a lot of other stuff. Faster than some things though.<br><br><br>Neetball</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I see channel offline at Neetball is that right? Or do I have to sign up or something.</br>  <br> Neetball <br>I've been on neetball for like an hour now and it still says channel is offline.<br><br>Is this just a problem on my end?</br></br></br></br>   can't into Nip <br>Guess I'll wait for subs.<br> Funi <br>Kill me.</br></br></br>  <br>Discusting!</br>  <br><br>Connectcast is messed up or something, follow the vaughnlive link below</br></br>  Here we go.

CGI Cameras, oh baby    Tail Red S2        I would vote for her   Hayamin as background character           seven thousand incest doujin<br><br>or none at all</br></br>  <br>Manage to get a screen of all the posters?</br>  <br><br><br>These images are hi-res. What are you streaming from? It can't be netball, that's like 240p.</br></br></br>      Didn't expect so much QUALITY during the 1st fucking episode.   IMS <br>How long until this show completely falls apart?</br>    GOD HAND  <br>Not really a background character, she got a name and even appears in OP</br>    Is this yuri?      <br>Gay as fuck</br>    Smooth Haruka, smooth <br><br><br>Thanks</br></br></br>  JAPANESE TRUCK TAKES MANY DIFFERENT FORMS    <br>Yay!</br>  I vote for Shu.  Why doesn't Akane just wear pants?    <br>Pants aren't kawaii</br>    Man, this show looks retarded already.  why is misaki such a slut?    <br>Has to appeal in some way because she's got nothing else. All her clones are excellent in specific ways and she's just average in every way.</br>  That was actually better than the manga    <br>She can split herself into a load of copies<br>Imagine the possibilities</br></br>  <br>The girls are cute, which is enough for me. But the QUALITY and plot is retarded, I agree</br>    Is the monarchy and power gimmick really needed. It feels like this could stand on its own if it was just a SoL.  end card  <br>Yeah it did a good job of introducing the powers. You don't learn some of them in the manga for a while if I'm remembering right. Next episode is Satou, excellent.<br><br>End illustration by Harikamo too, guess kirara might be trying to push their manga.</br></br></br>  <br>If it wasn't the for the King competition and their superpowers what would the story be? Just a slice of life about a huge family?</br>    <br> QUALITY <br>Looked fine to me honestly, unless you're that autistic over CG cameras.</br></br>  <br>such lewd body</br>  <br>What's the problem with that? It's not like we've had a fuckhuge family SoL before.<br><br>Though don't get me wrong, I don't really mind it that much. I just personally would have preferred if it didn't have it is all. Still good fun.</br></br></br>  I feel like the monarchy is unneeded, that as a large family with powers it would work. The monarchy is retarded. They have all this money, yet come home to a small home instead of a mansion, and have family dinners where the mom cooks. Its like masturbation material for the "average Japanese family", as if that's the best way to live.  <br>Akane is my favourite, but oh god Misaki is so hot<br><br><br>Camera's looked fine honestly, they even blended in fairly well which is strange for CGI. Drones looked a bit dodgy when she first created them. Not something that ruins the episode though.</br></br></br></br>   AOTS   OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3ue<br>ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wd3x0</wbr></br></wbr>  this is probably shit but I love the character designs. How are they so good?  <br>Same guy who did twintails. <br>I don't think it's that shit, but I did import the manga a while back so I'm a little biased maybe.</br></br>  Is somebody saving us from Funi?  <br>Why the fuck do would you need all that space anyway? And family dinners are GOAT fuck you.</br>  <br>No one.

Okusama ga Seitokaicho?</br>  *teleports behind you*  So who has the best superpower?  <br>yes</br>  <br>Akane or Aoi.

Did they do some yuri?  <br>Less fighting and less obnoxious characters.</br>  <br>There's some QUALITY, but its IMS, so that's to be expected. I don't remember if there's any Yuri.

Anything in particular?</br>  <br>Oh god that's even better.  I probably should have caught that earlier as chuuni HanaKana was mentioned in this thread. </br>  S-subs where?  <br>They had practice with the author's style through the Twintails anime. The shots they have of Akane are much lewder here than they were in the manga.</br>  <br>Heh, I don't have problem with monarchy and superpowers in this anime. If you want to watch anime with family, just watch something like Sazae-san, Chibi Maruko-chan, Shinchan, Atashinchi, or Kyouran Kazoku Nikki.</br>  <br>Don't just assume things out of your ass, idiot.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Highschool Spanish, don't fail me now!</br>  <br> not vaguely understanding Japanese, learned through associating sounds with words, enough in order to have a basic understanding of what's going on the scene, then using visuals to further your understanding </br>  <br>http://animeflv.net/ver/joukamachi-<wbr>no-dandelion-1.html<br><br><br> not speaking spanish, english and vaguely understanding japanese </br></br></br></wbr></br>  I'm shocked this hasn't been done earlier.  <br> not learning 6 different languages in order to consume Japanese media at the soonest moment. (Those languages being Chinese, Korean, Spanish, Japanese, French and Russian) </br>  <br>b-but you only need japanese then<br> korean, french, russian <br>Do they have a big sub community?</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but sometimes they get raws and translations faster than our communities. Russians love to put stuff online illegally, also.</br>  <br>I'm quite upset that I didn't even think of it.</br>  <br>Pretty sure they would. Spent a year abroad in Korea and one of my roommates was a korean weaboo. Watched his shows same week they aired and the officially translated LN business there was exploding with series. I think they get their books like a month or two after the release of the original in japan.</br>  Best girl coming next week.  <br>Why was I under the impression that her hair was pink all this time?</br>  <br>Same here. That said, why does this anime studio always fuck with the source material?</br>  Is this incest?  <br>Are you incest?</br>  When will HS come out? Or Do we have to wait for some groups pick it up?  subs wheeeeeeeeeeeeeere  <br><br>Thank Funi for this.</br></br>  I'm not a raw watcher but how yuri is this? I know there's a guy but he doesn't seem relevant from the promo so I have high hopes since the girls are 2qt and iirc this is published in Kirara.  <br>hardly yuri except some cute sister bondings</br>  <br>Wrong, she wants to fuck her brother.  Also fuck off spicshit. </br>  <br>Think we will see that animated?</br>  <br>There's no yuri but lots of incest.</br>  If Haruka can calculate the chance of anything, wouldn't he already know who will be king?  <br> inb4 the TWEEST is that he was final boss all along </br>  So the shota wants to fuck the loli, there's some pinkhaired twincest and the MC has a thing for her brother too?  Picked the fuck up   Did Haruka calculate the chance of grabbing Akane's ass?   not expecting incest in a royalty  <br><br>Royalty are notoriously known for inbreeding so this shit isn't a big deal anyway.</br></br>  <br>why doesn't she wear spats</br>  <br>Only sluts wear spats.</br>  <br>sluts don't wear (no) panties?</br>  How come the teleportation dude is the least popular? What did he do?  <br>Make muh dick bigger</br>  <br>Calculations depends on present state of affairs. You'll see some fun keikakuing around it during his focus episode.</br>  <br>He doesn't care.<br><br> As long his waifu votes for him. </br></br></br>  bump if I can  Did Shuu always have a fucked up leg? Never noticed it in the manga. I wonder if it'll pop up in volume 3, or maybe it ties in with what Kanade seems to be indebted to him for.  Subs when?  <br>The anime stuff they've done so far is a better opener than the manga is. So long as they don't meddle later on now that introductions are done it should be alright.<br><br><br> If I say we should work together I have 100% chance to grab her ass <br> 計画通り </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of the 3 translated chapters out right now, I don't think it was ever brought up. Is the second half content of episode even the same as in the manga? Because I don't remember any teddy-bear competition.</br>  <br>No they've changed a bit to introduce them all I guess. Orders changed a bit too if we're seeing Satou next chapter. <br><br>Can't remember anything about Shuu's leg either. I remember something about Kanade and Shuu in there but I can't remember what it was, probably just Kanade liking Shuu. I'll have a proper look later.</br></br></br>  Just read this thread from beginning, why yurifags think this will be yuri? Are they retarded?  <br>Don't worry, we're being blessed with Satou next week.<br><br>Has that chapter been translated yet? Think it's a bit far into vol1</br></br></br>    <br>They always are.</br>  <br>Nothing, but that's why really. Teru and Shiori get votes for being cute.</br>  Subs when?  <br>Pretty sure it will be a few days at the least.</br>  <br>Spanish subs are out  I don't know I'm some percent Spanish and I think I got the general vibe on what is going on </br>      This show sucked fat donkey dick.  <br>Aren't Spanish subs usually horrendous anyway?</br>  <br>Yeah</br>   spic subs before english subs <br>Get your shit together fansubbers.</br>  <br>They've been out before English quite a few times in the past, the problem is they're usually really bad.</br>  fansubbing is DEAD  <br>Good.</br>  <br>It has been for a while. <br><br>Heil Funi + Crunchyroll!</br></br></br>  <br>Fansubbing was a mistake<br>-Koda</br></br>  <br>The boys look cuter than the grils.</br>  brb learning spanish  <br>Misaki is pretty hot</br>  <br>Eagerly waiting for Hana though Kanade can be pretty adorable too.</br>  <br>Imagine having all her copies except the one that goes for Haruka</br>  Bump for subs.  <br>Double bump for subs</br>  bump for justice   licence too many shows just to beat the competition <br> delays everywhere because the slaves they employ aren't used to the workload <br> awful quality subs because who the fuck needs QC, the retards who pay for this shit won't even notice </br></br>  I just want my twincest dammit  <br>At least if they do this they'll die soon.</br>  bampu  How much QUALITY was there?<br><br>Does it live up to the manga?</br></br>  <br>there was a fair amount <br>not terribly noticeable, though</br></br>  So I got my hands on the chapters after volume 2. Looks like Shuu having an injured leg does tie in with Kanade. Needless to say, Shuu is a 15/10 onii-chan. And Kanade getting jelly over Hana is cute as fuck.  <br>Any yuri in it?</br>  <br>yuri yuri yuri yuri yuri yuri <br>that's everything anyone wants to know about this fucking show. <br>that and &gt;where are subs</br></br></br>  <br> tfw people actually believe they're helping the anime industry by subscribing to funi <br>Kill me now.</br></br>  <br>Can you post some examples of QUALITY? I didn't see any. Except I wish they hadn't used that shot of them flying towards the castle in the OP, that looks shit.<br><br><br>Got some scans? If you fancy dumping go ahead but I'll get the third volume anyway when it's out soon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear to God, where do you fags come from?</br>  <br>They never stop asking, do they<br><br><br>I attach a picture of some quality. Enjoy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just generic shitposters posting "is this yuri?" in every thread because they know /a/ hates yuri.</br>  <br>Well excuuuuse me, I saw the promo art and saw lots of girls in it, it's also published in Kirara so I wanted to be sure</br>  <br>Have some more. If you think the faces are well-done for a first episode, then god help you.</br>  <br>It's happening in a lot of threads lately it seems.</br>  <br> it's also published in Kirara <br>Kirara publishes a bunch of series that have straight romance and/or don't focus on yuri. This means nothing.</br></br>  <br><br>I think you're being a bit overzealous with the QUALITY calling. They're absolutely tiny on the screen. Like the kind of people who pause at inbetweens and go "QUALITY"</br></br>  <br>When there's not much on the screen, it's hard to miss. Sure, the main characters look fine, but I like to actually look at what I'm watching.

Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.

Well damn, it'll probably be a few months then.<br><br>I get the impression that there's around 3 or 4 people who care about the series a lot but that's not enough to sustain threads. Maybe the new manga release in a few weeks will revive them if scans emerge, but considering how the lack of available online scans impeded much of a following for the manga, I'm not expecting much. That might be a good thing though, looking at some of the popular manga threads. The one bright side is that shitposting might have died down by the time episode 12 airs, once people are wrapped up in the new seasonal dramas. I miss how comfy the threads were for the first half of the anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>May I ask where?</br>  <br> How does this work? <br><br>The woman died of childbirth, that's the only explanation and she's a time traveler, whether we'll know how or why is something I hope gets explained in the novel.</br></br></br>  <br>Ebay.

I know a lot of the crew is moving on to Noragami after this, so would they switch to a new one to get it out sooner instead of waiting for them to finish that production? I'd rather wait instead.</br></br>  <br>It's all up in the air imo. Not enough information to tell.<br>I don't see why Matsumoto would not take up S2 seeing as it's definitely upped her career.</br></br>  <br><br>I understand your concerns, many sequels tend to flop a bit on quality due to the higher ups wanting to milk the popularity while its hot and have them released on the following year, it's okay if the season second season was already planned before the first season has aired but in Kekkai Sensen's case I highly doubt it. That being said, I'm fine with a new crew as long as Matsumoto is still directing it.</br></br>  <br>It's mostly that people with artistic vision tend to gravitate towards original work once they get the leverage to do so. Also the fact that in that Kugimiya interview, I think I recall her mentioning that Matsumoto had approached her about voicing a character in Kekkai while they were still working on Kyousougiga, so she might be in the habit of planning projects ahead of time which she wouldn't want to back out of. Even if she cares a lot about the series, she may want to move on to express her own ideas instead of someone else's. Not that I wouldn't be super excited for her new work regardless.</br>  <br> hour-long <br>Neat.</br></br>  I haven't been able to work on volume 10 lately, but I'll try to get chapter 3 out tomorrow. It may be missing more sound effects than I intended since I don't have enough time to draw them with the amount of pages left, but I'll try to include more in the final zip. Also, if the correcter anon with a copy of the volume is in the thread, I have a translation question (big spoiler)  How would you phrase "君,僕に取り憑かれ給え"? I have it right now as "I would like to take control of your body" but I'm not sure if that sounds kind of awkward or not. Should I try to fit the ghost angle in?   <br>Would definitely listen to Starphase and KK do a radio show and talk about love and give love advice to listeners.</br>  <br>The way Chain Possible ended makes me doubt Starphase is qualified to be handing out any type of romantic advice.</br>  <br>That's exactly what will make for a hilarious show.</br>  <br><br>Chain would still watch it diligently to see if she can get any hints on getting into his heart.</br></br>  <br> Steven trying to sort out lovelorn callers' romance problems <br> His solution is always "walk her home gently" <br> the rest of the show is KK smacking him around the studio <br>I'd never miss a week.<br><br><br>Spoiler:  "Give up and let me possess you" would work, I think. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt any exist. Radio shows are pretty hard to translate; they're quite fast-paced and include a lot of different people talking over each other, especially Kekkai Sensen's.</br>  <br>KK and Steven are in their 30s? Somehow I thought they were older.<br><br> Do you think his meaning would be clear if I changed it to that? Here's the page for reference. The preceding lines on the previous page were "Let's proceed to the next level. I've decided,". Also, are Leo's lines in the bottom part accurate? I can't make them out in the spoiler pic. Sorry for bothering you with this stuff in the thread, I swear I'll make an email soon so we can be more coordinated about this, I've just been preoccupied lately. </br></br></br>  <br>Compared with the Japanese those pages are both 100% accurate; good job.  I don't think he's really making a request of Leo, but anything similar like "I've decided I'm going to possess you" etc. would work. The kanji 憑 connotes possession, as in by a spirit or demon, so I'd make sure to mention that. Also, don't sweat it; we can back-and-forth in threads just as easily as by mail. <br><br>I hadn't got a chance to post them yet but now that you're here.
