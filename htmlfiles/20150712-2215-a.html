Due to her poor health at the time very frail. So i guess she was your typical nerd. Wonder where her parents were. But i guess the lack of a family caused her to attach herself to madoka even more. Moemura definitely a qt tho.</br>  <br> good? <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br>Sounds about right.<br><br>I'm really not much for braids or pigtails, but damned if Moemura isn't cute as a button.</br></br></br>  <br>I see homura as someone who would read a lot of books, and also clumsy</br>  <br> there. <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  I want to take homu on a study date  <br> post pic from episode 10 <br> first episode </br></br>  <br>What would you be studying with her?</br>  Ameridoka S2 when?  <br>Human reproduction rituals.</br>  <br>Sometime after half life 3 gets released</br>  <br>Physics,and philosophy.

She's the best wingman ever</br>  <br>They could've done a lot more if it wasn't for her.</br>  <br>Ayano cuntblocked herself that time. If she had been quiet she would have done whatever she wanted to Kyouko AND have a video of it</br>  <br><br>Maybe their butts hurt</br></br>  <br>That's not how the meme works</br>    <br>Read the manga! Nearly everyone with everyone is a valid pairing at some small moment or another.</br>    <br>What from?</br>  <br>Point me to a chapter where Saku and Yui could be shipped and I would be inclined to believe you</br>  <br><br> You just have to believe hard enough. Manga or anime. <br><br> 2015 <br> not shipping Green Hair-chan and Brown Hair Blue Eyes-chan <br><br>The fuck are you people even watching?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the passionate gaze on the other brown hair-chan you'd have to be straight to not ship them</br>  Why is cock so great?  <br><br>You have a great eye for a passionate lover, Anon. <br><br>Come now, /yryr/. Even this hallway is full of potential OTPs. Hell, the blue-haired girl on the right in this picture could end up with Ayano. She looks like Kyouko with blue hair and no hair bow. <br><br>Believe. BELIEVE.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oooh, my long lost sister! </br>  <br>Who says they stopped after Chitose filmed them?</br>  <br>By the way, are the called intermissions because they are not at school? I can't really look through them to make sure but I just now made the connection.</br>  <br>Purple-chan and not-yui look like they're holding hands too! These girls are too lewd</br>  <br>Did Kyouko lose her bow again?</br>  <br>Unfortunately, no. Volume 9 has a bunch of intermission chapters that take place at school. I don't even know if there's a connection.<br><br><br>Seems like she hit her head as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That fucking chapter. Himawari will have a very hard life</br>  <br><br>Short Green Hair-chan and Brown Hair, Brown Eyes-san may be doing so, as well. They can't help it, Anon. They're young and full of raging hormones.</br></br>  <br>The naming confuses me. Although volume 10.5 I sort of get, with the sisters and all.</br>  <br>Twintails-chan and blonde-chan also look like they get along pretty well too!</br>    <br><br>Holy fuck you girls weren't kidding. I definitely wasn't ready for that. Thank you!</br></br>    <br>Thumbnail made me think there's a censorship bar over Akari's forehead.</br>  <br>Subconsciously censoring Akari. <br>You're horrible anon-chan.</br></br>  <br>I can hear the MOU in my head. I do hope it's just in my head and not an actual Akari trying to break through the filter my mind set up without my approval.</br>    <br> not acknowledging Akari's presence all around us <br>How does it feel being such a massive het?</br></br>  <br>I want to see it, Anon. I want to believe. I want to become a lesbian.</br>  Goodnight anons.  <br>IT'S ONLY 3AM!</br>  <br><br>Pleasant dreams. Anon-chan. May your dreams be filled with cute lesbian harems.</br></br>  <br>You don't need to tell me that you filthy het. You just need to want it from the bottom of your heart and eventually it will become true. <br><br>You may be a disgusting het now but I'm sure someday we will be able to stand together as gay sisters</br></br></br>  <br>But I was training for this in the Hibike Euphonium camp</br>  <br>S3 never ;_;</br>  <br>Stop this meme.</br>  <br>You sicken me! <br><br>  didn't watch it. Is it any good?  </br></br></br>  Is there any need for fansubbing (besides for BD's) when Crunchyroll, Funimation and HorribleSubs exist? It seems like it's pretty pointless and obsolete now  <br>FUCK Funimation.</br>  For the series that fall through the cracks.<br><br>Also, the subs and encodes from Crunchyroll/Funimation leave a lot to be desired.</br></br>  Funimation is kind of lukewarm to me, I don't always think they do such an amazing job.<br>Their dubs are mediocre as shit and brings to mind shitty Western cartoons for children (not that dubbed anime is typically any good).<br><br>And CR fucking blocks some content in some countries so they can all go and fuck themselves with a splintered broom.</br></br></br>  B-But, muh karaoke.  <br>They should call themselves encoders, because that's the biggest merit of what they do these days. With HS you also get the shitty quality of the CR and funi streams in addition to their subs. Now if only the "fansubbers" could just take CR or funi scripts, edit them where it's necessary (and not where they please) and slap them onto properly encoded raws, all that within hours of a simulcast release, we'd be living in an ideal world.</br>  Why would you only want those options? <br>It's basically a monopoly at this point.</br>  How do I encode like Commie?  I hope Funi fucking dies one of these days.<br><br>Either that or they hire somebody who knows how to encode softsubs and actually typeset.</br></br>  <br>Because Funi is terrible all-around, both have shitty encodes, and I'd always prefer to have more options so I can choose the best one. Plus, CR is an abomination, and fansubs aren't.</br>  <br>I know right<br>Who needs fansubbers for shows Funi picked up, they're perfect</br></br>  <br>I agree. Do people actually listen to Anime Karaoke or do fools just love trying to sign this in English and off-pitch?</br>  <br>It's all about pretty typesetting.<br><br>Also fansubs tend to word things better than legal streams when they don't overlocalize.</br></br></br>  They don't always sub everything in the season.  <br><br>CR's subs are overall better than what the remaining fansub groups can offer 99% of the time. Funi is just shit. The encodes of both are awful.</br></br>  <br>You would have to kill a lot of people since Funi is not one entity but a large group of faggots.</br>  <br> funimation </br>  <br>Crunchyroll is shit, faggot. Check 'em.</br>  <br>Translated songs, including OPs and EDs are the primary reason. For this season, Symphogear should be watched with fansubs, but on almost anything else it doesn't make enough of a difference to wait.</br>  Funi's video is actually pretty good these days. I can imagine it being the best source in a lot of cases, if it wasn't hardsubbed. At least the ouput range can be fixed.<br><br>If only they had consistently decent subs. A lot of the time it reads like it was written by an ESL person who doesn't understand Japanese either.</br></br>  I'm sort of okay with Crunchy at this point. <br><br>But fuck Funimation. Their releases are shit quality with terrible hardsubs and usually have other problems. Just look at their Overlord ep.1</br></br>  Why would you limit your options to three shitty ones?  <br>Checked and confirmed.</br>  <br><br>Check what, Anon?</br></br>  Also, censoring. If I'm not mistaken, there was censoring in GATE as well, for the flags.  <br>I can stomach CR, which is why I am a proponent of CR edits that correct mistakes and add in OP/ED tl.<br><br>Funi is just absolute trash and it is an abomination that decent shows are actually subject to be released as such.</br></br></br>  <br>Check'd.</br>  <br>Summer hits strong</br>  Funi and Crunchy don't pick everything up though.<br><br><br>Like who would have done Sidonia if Daiz and his buddies weren't around.</br></br></br>  <br>I truly hope they die all together on their way to some anime event.</br>  <br><br>lol...I know what you mean. It's so hot where I live.</br></br>  <br>It's about the type of translation you're aiming for too. Contrary to popular belief there is no one correct way to translate anything. Personally, I find very strictly literal translations are more useful in an academic sense and I think a lot of the "bad" subs people see are often just these. Guesswork subs are awful though and make me want to hurt people.</br>  <br> Crunchyroll and Funimation sub everything <br> they do a decent job at it <br>Get a load of this newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get the censor thing at all. Do they actually think it's funny?</br>  <br>Checked and doubles confirm it.</br>  <br>Checked.</br>  <br> that guy checking those digits below his own </br>  <br>  lol... <br><br>My little anon cannot be this retarded holy shit. Get the fuck out of /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>Go ask in the Symphogear thread.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=20P<wbr>waJYcnuk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>Don't bite the bait you nigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I've compared subs for shows both Funi and CR have, I've found the opposite to be true, i.e., Funi has better subs than CR.</br>  <br><br>Gomen (lmao)...Did I do something wrong? I'm new here, so I'm still getting learning the rules.</br></br>  <br>He's not even baiting the hook now</br>  <br>He's going all out.</br>  <br>/a/ is so biased against these 3 it's hilarious.<br><br>I would never pay for seasonal content but to shit on HS by extension is just petty and stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Because of crunchyroll I am now blind.</br>  <br>You didn't do anything wrong, that guy is just an asshole trying to derail the thread.</br>  <br>For Shimoneta or in general?<br><br>For Shimoneta, presumably to allow it to be shown to a larger demographic. Though it's not very graphic to begin with.<br><br>For GATE, probably not to offend anyone. Somehow.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I came here to "bait", if that's what you mean...^_~</br></br>    Why can't funi typeset?<br/>  <br> cherrypicking <br>I can think over way more egregious examples of fuckery done by fansubbers over the years and so can you (unless you're a newfag and chances are high). Don't be a child.</br></br>  <br><br>The other guy sure is the one trying to derail the thread.<br><br><br>Works every time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing that bothers me is the fake transparency.</br>  <br>I wish the BD groups actually did a decent job.<br><br>Some of series like Yozakura, Nanana and Kawaishou have short OVAs included on the BD but none of the BD groups included these short OVAs on their release.</br></br></br>  How does it feel knowing that "summer" is actually a bunch of retards falseflagging across the board?<br><br>I'd rather have rec threads galore than these fucking epic trolls.</br></br>  <br>CR confirmed for garbage at least this thread isn't 100% useless.</br>  <br>Why would they pick up a show like shimoneta if they want a larger demographic?</br>  <br>Lmao, +1 your post I just wish we had a like button too so I could like your post XDD. Why don't we have one yet?</br>  <br> a bunch of retards falseflagging across the board <br><br>This happens all year round, actually.</br></br></br>  127967730<br>Wait, are the censors not in the raws?</br>  I just want legit subs for Rokka no Yuusha. Maybe someone will pick it up later, right?    <br/>  <br>Along with a few other scenes.</br>  <br>Are OVAs maybe "included" in the sense that, when they're released, they are shipped to you? Could be an issue with getting a newer disk from a source or something maybe.</br>  Does crunchyshit look like dogshit because it's streaming, or is it because they just don't care about the quality?  <br>Is there something wrong with the like button XD?</br>  <br>He means specials that come on the disk. Most of the time the BD groups just ignore them completely.</br>  <br> 1080p <br>That aside, I'm convinced HS is causing the visual downgrade somehow. I leach off a friend's account for seasonal shit and it's not like this. I've even been going to the HS release to compare.</br></br>  <br>Moreso they just don't care. Streaming isn't just a meme and most streams are indeedquite shitty, but CRs streams are good to great honestly. It's just that they don't bother to do anything to fix things up and just do the bare minimum because they have no legit competition. They literally eat money and shit subs.</br>  <br>Post some comparisons.</br>  <br>What would they gain by doing that?</br>  Remember a time when popular shows had 5+ different groups subbing them simultaneously, and we would be arguing over which were the best? Now we're lucking if a moderately popular show gets even one group. I miss those days.  <br>That's what you get for shitting on gg glorious subs.</br>  <br>Fucking THIS. Fuck Cruncyshit and it's shitty subs.</br>  <br>It can only get worse.</br>  <br>I'll do one scene.<br><br>What timestamp does that GATE screenshot happen?<br><br><br>I wasn't implying they do it on purpose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, for this episode I went to the source and watched it on the CR website. It looks exactly the same there.<br><br>I tend to download in 1080 for HS because I'm never sure which ones are hardsubbed, and upscaled subtitles bother me much more than the rest of the picture, for whatever reason.</br></br></br>  I miss it. Anime subs aren't what they used to be. As CR and funi only get the shows that are economically viable, more and more will fall through the cracks.  <br>I liked gg and I miss them.</br>  Yes, who will sub my little girl shows otherwise  <br> gg will never return to save us  <br>They were the memesubs we deserved, but not the ones we needed</br></br>  <br>Doesn't CR try to get everything they can, whether it's financially viable or not?</br>  <br>I'm watching the episode now and it's only noticeable if you pause (for me anyway). This is usually where I'm called a pleb but it doesn't bother me. I start harping over quality when it's time to hoard shows on my HDD.</br>  <br><br>Fansubbing is nowhere what it was back in 2009. They might as well call themselves "encoders" instead since all they do is just make subs look pretty, and if horriblesubs video is bad, they'll just rip it off air from Japanese TV.<br><br>As for horriblesubs... Crunchyroll sometimes fuck up their videos real bad it becomes unwatchable Proof? Watch Non non biyori season 1 and Terraformars and see all that nasty color banding in dark scenes. I guess the only exception to CR's bad video quality is Hibike Euphonium and Non Non Biyori season 2 (so far)</br></br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? We still have the awesome CoalGirls!</br>  <br>I miss those fa[gg]ots.</br>  Yes. Anybody who has watched Funi's 'work' on Shinometa should see why we need fansubbers.  <br>No, I don't miss those days at all. Back then, we're lucky if 70% of the series gets subbed within a week before the next week airs, with the remaining not getting subs for ages. Now, we're guaranteed at least 80 or maybe 90% of the shows will be subbed within a day. Fuck the so-called good old days.</br>  <br>Watch the opening scene again. If you don't see something seriously wrong with it you might need your eyes checked.</br>  <br> Watch Non non biyori season 1 <br> nasty color banding in dark scenes <br><br>God help us.</br></br></br></br>  <br> unwatchable <br>Unless "sometimes" means "almost never" then you're exaggerating pretty hard.</br></br>  Why does funi try so hard to live?<br> funimation'snourin.jpg </br>  We took fansubbers for granted and this is what we got for it.<br>Maybe we should kill ourselves.</br>  <br> Does crunchyshit look like dogshit because it's streaming, or is it because they just don't care about the quality? <br><br>It's a crapshoot, <br><br>but odds are you get more shitty banding from them.<br><br>The only CR not affected by banding is Hibike Euphonium and Yurikuma. I tried hard to look for banding and it's just not there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess if you're the type of person content with low-quality garbage and shit typesetting then everything is great for you, but I'm still waiting for fucking episode 4 of yamada-kun.</br>   not every show gets subbed, still <br> Funi rips are AWFUL, HS are only marginally better, but typesetting is terrible in both and the original streams aren't anything to write home about <br> some rips are censored when there is an uncensored alternative that airs <br> some shows are delayed and subs available well after the show airs every week <br><br><br>There is still room for fansubs, but not in the same way there was 5-10 years ago. I personally think it's a little sad when a show only gets rips, and the amount of these seems to be increasing slowly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Season 1 should have BD releases out by now. I think FFF was working on it, so it might take a while to get through it.</br>  <br>Funimation subs are completely horrible and localized to hell and back and horriblesubs just rips funi and crunchy anyway.<br><br>Crunchysubs are alright I guess.<br>to be honest I'm not enjoying how the new subgroups are starting to localize the script a lot and most of them dropped honorifics as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br> As CR and funi only get the shows that are economically viable, more and more will fall through the cracks. <br><br>wat<br><br>Funi literally stole most of the shows this summer!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are way more shows getting subbed in a timely fashion than there ever were before CR.</br>  <br>Yeah, exaggerating out of your ass doesn't make something true.<br><br>Also people argued over typesetting even back then. Stop acting like that's something exclusive to CR and Funi.</br></br></br>  How has pirating not killed funi yet?  <br>It does, that's correct. No OVA though, at least I don't think so.<br><br>That image was just an example of the atrocious banding issues that were present during the airing of the first season. Those were bad times.</br></br></br>  <br>There's only FFF's HDTV rip on BBT<br>Is there no group that has completed BDs?</br></br>  What are some scenes in anime that give you chickenskin?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hoo<wbr>R5iqIueg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> chickenskin <br>At first I thought a dumb nip failed again in Engrish. Even for a nip, that sounds weird.</br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/NKDIVq8UMLM?t=311  [ ]<br><br>you know, back when it was good</br></br>  So simple, yet so fucking brilliant.  <br>The final moment in 2nd season of Twelve Kingdoms, when Yoko claims the throne and gives out her Royal Orders. <br><br>Fuck, that scene is immortal.</br></br></br>  <br>It's about half half to be honest.<br><br>  "Goose skin" is used in German (Gänsehaut), Swedish (gåshud), Danish and Norwegian (gåsehud), Icelandic (gæsahúð), Greek (χήνειο δέρμα), Italian (pelle d'oca), Russian (гусиная кожа), Ukrainian (гусяча шкіра), Polish (gęsia skórka), Czech (husí kůže), Slovak (husia koža), Slovene (kurja polt), Latvian (zosāda) and Hungarian (libabőr). <br><br> It should be noted that in other languages, however, the "goose" may be replaced by other kinds of poultry. For instance, "hen" is used in Spanish (piel de gallina), Portuguese (pele de galinha), Romanian (piele de găină), French (chair de poule) and Catalan (pell de gallina). "Chicken" is used in Dutch (kippenvel), Chinese (雞皮疙瘩, lit. lumps on chicken skin), Finnish (kananliha), Estonian (kananahk), Afrikaans (hoendervleis) and Korean (닭살, daksal). In Hindi/Urdu it is called rongtey khade ho jaana. The equivalent Japanese term, 鳥肌, torihada, translates literally as "bird skin". In Arabic it is called kash'arirah, while in Hebrew it is called "duck skin" (עור ברווז). </br></br></br></br></br>  My waifu, no touch.<br><br>Also, volume 9 chapter 1 spoilers.</br></br>  Volume 9 summary/spoilers<br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw we'll never see volume 9 Kingdom   massacre  animated.<br><br>Why even live?</br></br></br>  <br>Buy the BDs</br>  <br> we will never see   clementine juicing  uncensored in any media <br>pls</br></br>  I'll be happy if this can become split cour.  <br>Isn't the hug in volume 3?</br>  <br>Keyword is the uncensored glory it deserves. With Clementines innards hanging from her mouth/in her mouth.</br>  <br>Yeah, probably not, I don't think it even goes into that much detail in the LN. The BDs might give the scene a little more detail, but don't get your hopes up.</br>  <br><br>Considering how graphicly it was described we probably will get a pan away or something</br></br>  <br>I would be contend to even get a complete expression of terror on her face and blood curling with the spine snap.</br>  <br>It goes into detail. How Ainz has to use a spell to clean himself because of her vomit and shit.</br>  <br>why spoilers when volume 5,6,7 and 8 aren't translated yet?</br>  <br>Anon, do you understand the meaning of spoilers?</br>  <br>So that we can harden our bones from the sheer grace of Papa Bones' splendor.</br>    <br>oh man Papa Bones is ready to rip some major shit.</br>  600 years ago: 6 Great Gods<br>500 years ago: 8 Kings<br>200 years ago: 13 Heroes (at least one of them)<br>200 years ago?: Minotaur, Goblin King<br><br>Anymore players?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can I get a summary of what happened to make this moment?  I take it the empire got uppity, ainz slapped their shit and now they're scrabbling to apologise, whilst also plotting to band up and attack nazarick? When did Nazarick openly establish itself as a power? Was this because of the lizard incident, or did ainz do some other big shit? </br>  <br>You know what really worries me. It's  the fact that Ainz might have just been sleeping for 600+ years, while the Guardians are just sitting there, waiting for him to wake up </br>  Would anyone put Ainz in the "hero" category just because he's not going around provoking people? Like I'm looking at this nigga who's disappointed because he thought Ainz was going to be more "evil" than he apparently is.  <br>Here<br/></br>  <br>Has he read to the current volume or just the translated parts?<br><br><br>How would that even work?</br></br></br></br>  <br> How would that even work? <br>How did he even get to the next world? I don't fucking know.</br></br>  <br><br>he must be mad he isn't retard evil or something</br></br>  <br>Nah, they would have told him something like "Our Momonga-sama has finally awaken from his slumber" and then asked him how his sleep was.<br><br>That, and they also remember times when they were in Yggdrasil getting raided.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure one of the human nations would have noticed the odd ruins during those 600 years.</br>  <br>That's a bit too New Gate-y for me though.</br>  <br>Okay cool, so it is just Nazarick entering the world stage.</br>  <br>Nigga tried to spy on Ainz but Ainz already spied on him. You don't bullshit with the bullshitter</br>  <br>I don't think so, an example would be Mare and Aura, both of which would qualify as a lifespan human race, I think it's state that both are less than 600 years old.</br>  <br>At the beginning they mention that the area outside the tomb has obviously changed so that definitely shouldn't be the case. On top of that someone would have found the tomb by then since it was previously not hidden.</br>  <br>He's a villain, but he isn't evil. If that makes sense.</br>  <br>Just the thought of them sitting there waiting for their next order for hundreds of years breaks my heart</br>  <br>no one will buy the BDs and this will never get a season 2<br><br>its a shame, but as usual the nips have shit taste and likely will not even be interested in this show in the slightest</br></br></br>  <br>A story about an evil Lich would be interesting. I'm talking about a story in the vein of Maou no Hajimekata. But an overly paranoid and pragmatic Overlord with a penchant for doing any and everything for the sake of hi children is just as good.</br>  <br>He's never been "evil," he's just amoral towards things that are not part of Nazarick.</br>  <br>So then you buy them.</br>  Vol 4 kinda ends on a dead note doesn't it? Just him closing his eyes  <br><br>He's like one of those stupid sympathetic JRPG/shonen villains but not stupid<br><br>'I KILLED 1000s OF PEOPLE JUST TO MEET MY FRIENDS AGAIN' etc etc</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I dont know man. He condones torture and orders genocide to get better minions. Hes fairly evil.</br></br>  <br>Makes sense. He's definitely not doing anything for the sake of others outside his family and isn't it stipulated somewhere that heroes must do good things? Oh right. He can be considered a "hero" to the denizens of Nazarick.</br>  <br>The popularity ranking of the summer shows has Overlord in the same ranking as Mononga when in was in Yggdrasil, middle upper.</br>  <br>Yeah, the sympathetic villain. That's who he is, probably because we're getting the story from his pov.</br>  <br>He's only paranoid, and getting as much info about the new world so he can better protect his guild. He does get a bit more evil as the volumes progress, but I wouldn't necessarily call his intentions in the first four volumes evil, more like paranoid and a bit misguided.</br>  <br> Hes fairly evil. <br><br>He is only using criminals and scumbags. I rather call him egoistical.</br></br></br>  <br>He reconciles it with the fact that he's just torturing "bad" people and he doesn't particularly see any race other than humans (part of his remaining human self) and those of Nazarick as sentient beings.<br><br>The unfortunate thing is that he just doesn't think that far when it comes to his morality, his ability to sympathize is actually being affected by his form as a lich, he notes this in the beginning. Post-Shaltear Ainz would probably have never interfered in the battle at Carne Village.</br></br></br>  <br>Stalker pts also aren't as bad as they could be. So there's hope. Just not a lot of it.</br>  Best girl and mai waifu.  <br>Please, Demiurge only uses the finest humans.</br>  <br>So far Ainz has  Killed 4 adventurers, ordered undead to kill adventurers for credit, tortured people for information, sent his people to capture or kill those who wouldn't be missed for knowledge and experiments, killed hundreds of lizardmen just for combat experience, and subjugated said lizardmen.<br><br>I mean sure he does a good deed here, has a code of honour, and dotes on his "children", but his alignment -500 feels pretty damn accurate most of the time.</br></br> </br>  <br> Post-Shaltear Ainz would probably have never interfered in the battle at Carne Village. <br><br>Yes he would have, he only first intervened because Sebas was getting jittery. If there's anything he wants from his children, is for them to speak their mind. Seeing Sebas wanting to protect something of his own accord would've have still swayed him.</br></br></br>  <br>I see your Naberal, I raise you one Shalltear.</br>  <br>those faces, oh lord.</br>  <br>A raise usually requires something of a higher value.</br>  <br><br>He planed to wipe out five entire tribes of lizardmen who never did anything for better mooks. Thats pretty evil no matter how you cut it.<br><br>He kills that adventure dude without a second thought and he was just a bit of an asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine then. I'll raise you one Solution Epsilon.</br>  <br><br>Rotten goods needs no apply.</br></br>  <br>Why did you post an image of a chair?</br>  <br>  During his speech about making Ainz Ooal Gown an eternal legend, all the minions will have Hellsing villain smiles. </br>  <br><br><br><br> Sebas  &gt; α &gt; ζ &gt; ε &gt; β &gt; Δ &gt; Γ</br></br></br></br>  Episodes titles<br><br>Episode 2: Floor Guardians<br>Episode 3: Battle of Carne Village<br>Episode 4: Ruler of Death<br>Episode 5: The Two Adventurers <br><br>So will people drop this by episode 3?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  <br>No. Looks fine to me.</br>  <br>Not confirmed but I'm pretty sure that most of the real big end of the world demon lords were players or bosses that got transported over.<br><br>Also one thing I'm wondering about the future of the series<br><br>Chapter 1 it mentions the Fireworks the GM's were doing as a final sendoff and ainz not bothering going. Now everyone that gets transported seems to be with whoevers around them.<br><br>So what're the odds the big human race capital and all the players watching the fireworks together there get transported in?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're only going up to Volume 3. I don't know if this is good or not. I've seen what happens to rushed series, but I still want more of Papa Bones and his adventures.</br>  <br>So it's 4+4+4+1 then, no lizardmen. As it should be, vol 4 is a horrible place to stop. Extra episode might be a beach episode or the drama cd.</br>    <br> beach episode <br> UMI-DA </br></br>  <br>But werewolves are the only correct number one in a heteromorphic guild.</br>  <br>A wolf is still a filthy mammal.<br><br>Try an insect, at least.</br></br></br>  <br>If I recall, the sea in the New World somehow doesn't have any salt in it.</br>  <br>I bet one of the greed kings wanted something to drink and world item'd the ocean</br>  yore waifu is slut! Slut!  <br>What an asshole haha</br>  <br>Does an ant mantis count?</br>  So does anyone know if there's a folder with all the illustrations and character sheets and nothing else?  what could happen if someone said that ainz was actually a human..  <br>Death.</br>  <br>I know some illustrations are in the Mega download, not sure which though.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>i dont really think it matters<br><br>i mean his skeleton is vaguely humanoid so i dont see why no one would consider the possiblity that he was one before lichdom</br></br></br></br>  <br>ur waifu a shit</br>  <br> Those faces. <br>   Sebas at the end gave a 'I'm too old for this shit.' look. </br></br>  <br>I thought we were talking cute battle maids<br><br>And you can't say Cocytus without saying cute<br><br>So why not</br></br></br></br></br>  Did we ever get a full list of who created who in the guild?<br><br>Off the top of my head I only remember<br><br>Ainz: Pandora's Actor<br>Tabula: Albedo<br>Whitebrim: Aura and Mare<br>Perorochino: Shalltear</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ainz is Chaotic Neutral  <br>The wiki has a lot of the creators listed<br>http://overlordmaruyama.wikia.com/w<wbr>iki/Overlord_Wiki</wbr></br></br>  <br> chaotic neutral <br> has never done anything chaotic <br> everything good he's done was part of a greater evil plan and uses evil means to complete noble goals <br><br>  I know this is bait some guy posts every once in a while but I must respond  </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Lawful Evil?</br>  <br>There was one of the guildies that left to be a mangaka or something that designed the Pleiades. Don't recall the name though. Touch Me made Sebas, and I believe Tabula also made Albedo's sisters.</br>  <br>He's got a code he lives by, but still does questionable or sometimes outright evil things. Sounds accurate to me.</br>  <br>Not everything. He saved Carne village because that little girl reminded him of when he was saved from gankers by Touch Me back in the early days of Yggdrasil.</br>  <br>He'd be willing to help the less fortunate if one of his children asks for mercy, can't be any of the evils if he's willing to do good.</br>  So can you revive from dying of old age in the new world?<br><br>Zasaerasr(whatever the lizard dudes name was) got rezzed and only lost 1 level...so you would think most players would still be around</br></br>  <br>Did you not read last week's stuff at the end of Volume 4?<br><br>Ainz goes out of his way to say that regular resurrection won't do anything about life span. Though he does think to himself that it might be possible if you used something like "Wish Upon a Star" to extend a person's life span.</br></br></br>  <br> Die from old age <br> Rez <br> Die 30 seconds later </br></br></br>  Ainz-sama, please turn me into a skeleton so I can server you.  <br>Why is it everyone always notes the Lich form affecting him but rarely the -500 on the morality scale? Just look at all the NPCs, it doesn't matter what the fuck your race is, it still affects you. We don't even know if Albedo's slutty nature would have remained if her settings were bland and left up to her racial levels.<br><br>Until we see a character who was made by their creator to be the exact opposite of themselves in personality it's rather hard to pin it down on which factor affects the person's mentality the most. And that's probably not gonna happen given the pattern in this story.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Even while doing something "good", he does so to further his own agenda. "Good" also always seems relative in his case. Think Kreya from KotOR II.</br>  <br>So volume 2 or 3 will be rushed.</br>  <br>But it's not like his agendas are actually evil. <br>His agendas is primarily to protect his guild's NPCs.<br><br>Lawful Neutral would honestly fit him better. Doing whatever good or evil in order to further his own goals.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's also the possibility that the 6 Gods, 8 Kings, 13 Heroes, etc etc were transported before the server shut down as well. Considering how they only come once every 100 years, and the game lasted 10 years, all it takes is one stupid magical update along the way like an expansion pack or content patch and bam you just got databased. It could just be certain people (probably WC item owners) being transported at specific intervals. This theory would work best if say, the expansion pack released in the 4th-5th year which would trigger the 6 gods assuming they are the 1st to arrive in the new world. 1 year in yggdrasil = 100 years in new world being the formula.<br><br>Personally if we're going by 'making sense' my theory would be Ainz and everyone is just an AI copy and everything is in a contained experiment for R&amp;Ding Yggdrasil 2. But even that is way too crazy given how their VRMMOs didn't even have facial expressions. Then again, having a VRMMO and citing facial expressions as a problem already sounds retarded given our current technology.</br></br></br>  <br> a character who was made by their creator to be the exact opposite of themselves in personality <br>Huh? Hasn't it already happened with Mare? He pretends to be very timid and scared of violence, but all of the humans he's run into have realized that it's all a ruse.</br></br>  <br>I'm not quite convinced it's a ruse. I think he's just deadly serious about following orders.</br>  <br> But it's not like his agendas are actually evil. <br>Torture, casual murder and genocide are all considered evil.</br></br>  I know people say the story shouldn't have started out with the MMORPG setting but after rereading the novels, I think I disagree.<br><br>Unless there were other ways to introduce those game items in a way that it would have had an equally profound effect on the New World, I still think Yggdrasil was a pretty good setting.<br><br>If Momonga or other people were just transported from the real world a la 12 Kingdoms or even Zero no Tsukaima, what are the odds that they'd have weapons with mad power like the World Class items?</br></br></br></br>  <br>now you're just nitpicking</br>  <br>No that isn't what I meant at all. Sorry I know I worded it poorly.<br><br>What I mean is let's take Sebas or Demiurge for example. We know Sebas is not only 300 in good, but he also is affected by Touch Me who was a protector of the weak. Same with Ulbert who was a chuuni for evil and Demiurge who is 500 into evil.<br><br>Now, what would happen if these two NPCs were swapped? Sebas was created by Ulbert, but has 300 in good, and Demiurge has 500 in evil, but was created by Touch Me?<br><br>Get what I'm saying? So far all characters hold traces of their creator's personalities, which also at the same time lines up with their alignment and even race at times. As far as we know there's no exception to this.<br><br>Perhaps Spinel might be the one npc Tabula made that isn't gap moe, but who knows?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How so?</br>  <br>And they are all with a few exceptions truly evil. That only makes him noble, not good.</br>  <br>I don't know</br>  <br>But he kinda does nothing but evil things like that. Could you name another three good actions to balance out these pretty obvious cases of immoral activities?</br>  <br>Not to mention Yggdrasil had many amazing fleshed out concepts that made the game look fun, even if obviously imbalanced as fuck and wouldn't be very epic for the majority of casuals as it would for AOG. Still, my favorite aspect has to be EXP being a resource. Fuck this max level / end game being the only thing that matters and everything has to be balanced around level 100s fighting each other.</br>  <br>So I am actually not nit picking at all?</br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>So papa bones is in fact evil?</br>  <br>Those aren't agendas, agendas are goals. He doesn't do genocide for genocide's sake. He's still quite evil, but his actual goals aren't that bad.</br>  <br>It's possible.</br>  <br> He saves the village <br> He saves the dryad and lets her join Nazarick <br> He allows Toile to join Nazarick <br><br>Well, obviously he's done a lot more evil than good, but here you go!<br><br>And if you claim the 1st one doesn't count because of Sebas, then all good deeds can count as the same due to it ultimately being self-satisfaction, even if it's ultimately for other's benefit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. There are a lot concepts taken from DnD and MMOs.</br>  <br>Having good goals doesn't make your actions less evil. His goal isnt even good, just that Nazarick's name gets out.</br>  <br>I didn't know shit about DnD, so I decided to try DDO. I can definitely see the similarities now.</br>  <br>Indeed. But I also think it's a lot better that it's not Yggdrasil that became reality but reality that became aspects of Yggdrasil.</br>  <br> We don't even know if Albedo's slutty nature would have remained if her settings were bland and left up to her racial levels. <br>odds are that they would have seeing as she's literally a sex demon( succubus)</br></br>    <br> sex demon( succubus) <br>She's a gorilla, anon. Embrace it.</br></br>  <br>She's the best.</br>  <br>Who says a succubus cant look like a gorilla?</br>  <br>Man, this is going to be quite the episode for secondaires.</br>  <br>Oh for sure, but I was just pointing out how if a game company were to create something close to Yggdrasil, even without the VR it would probably gather quite a lot of interest. Unlike say, shieldbro, wordmaster, SAO, etc etc you name it Yggdrasil has so many clever ass ideas rolled into one even if you don't think it would last a long time, one would be hard pressed not to try it out no?<br><br>It just screams 'fun', at least for me. Then again I'm one of those that would play EVE if it wasn't so spreadsheet simulator all the damn time so my 2 cents don't count.</br></br></br>  <br> See Albedo's Yamato Nadeshiko actions in episode 1 <br> Write her off as a bland character <br> See her "I'm the legal wife" personality in front of the other guardians. <br> Proclaim her best girl of the show. </br></br></br></br>  <br>you say that like Gorrilla and Succubus are mutually exclusive. If Solution Epsilon ca be both a Shoggoth and Ubbo-Sathla then anything is possible</br>  <br>Once you get past the swords and "magic" age, warfare is about stats.</br>  <br>Yggdrasil does have a lot of pretty fun ideas but I can't help but think everyone would rather choose a heteromorphic avatar rather than the humans and pretty soon the game would be a bunch of non-human characters pking each other.</br>  <br>Where did the gorilla thing come from anyway?</br>  <br> If Solution Epsilon ca be both a Shoggoth and Ubbo-Sathla <br>What vol was this in? I thought she was just a life eating slime</br></br>  <br>In the interlude after Ainz first meet all of them on the 6th floor, where they start arguing with each other and throwing insults for First Wife status.</br>  <br>Yeah and that's boring. Do you understand why modern warfare fiction doesn't give much attention to stories about people nuking each other all day?<br><br><br>Actually aside from specific builds like Touch-Me's banned build, Demi-humans were the meta since they took the best of both worlds, having good racials while not taking away too many job levels. Heteromorphic races were overall, the most weak in terms of meta. Plus Heteromorphic was the only race to have no penalties when you kill them in PK so for pve fags it's a huge bonus to be human or demi-human.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that it?</br>  <br>it's from her Stat sheet at the end of Vol 5</br>  <br>They're 76~ish. Or, at least Aura is.</br>  With the bitch setting gone Arbedo got changed to become a virgin<br>In volume 8 she couldn't ride her familiar (that she was able to before) because it doesn't allow a "pure" rider on it</br>  <br>huh. that's a neat little touch if true. And stop spoiling shit.</br>  <br>That's it. It's because Albedo threw out "Starfish mouth" at Shalltear and we find out why after vol 3.</br>  <br>Humans and demi-humans could obtain more job classes to choose from, while heteromorphic players were restricted by their racials. There was also less PvP penalties for killing heteromorphic players. Human and demi-human races also tended to be much prettier, which is a huge advantage in regards to player population for any MMO game.</br>  <br> In vol 9, Nazarick falls. </br>  <br> losing abilities in combat because you're no longer a slut <br><br>That's pretty amusing.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the correlation between that single line and giving her back her hymen.</br>  <br>Tell me about your relationship with your mother.</br>  <br>Huge lie.</br>  <br>Don't listen to this fag <br><br> Herohero is killed in real life and reincarnates into a slime, meets a dragon and becomes buddies with him. Then he eats him and begins his conquest in the new world. Oh and he becomes a shota later. </br></br></br>  Look, all I'm saying is make sure everything past the current Tld chapter is spoilered for the rest of us. Please?  <br> implying such a thing is even possible </br>  <br> He already forgot world savior is in the new world <br><br>There's no game mechanics to protect your shitty tomb from being one shot.</br></br></br>  <br>The 7 headed dragon could surely do it.</br>  <br>That shit just screams succubus</br>  <br> world savior is in the new world <br>There's no proof.</br></br>  <br> the branch of tonelico <br> a mere goblin wiped out several dragons in one swing <br><br>How much harder do you want it spelled out for you?</br></br></br></br>  To all of you faggots that read the translations, Skythewood put out the prologue and chapter 1 of Vol.5 today.  <br>But it's fun to speculate and wonder how thing got to that point, spoilers make it more fun in my opinion.</br>  <br>What, we now have fans of the human kingdom and empire?<br>Thanks, anime</br></br>  <br> Bullshit, but I believe it. </br>  <br>Yup, read that like 12 hours ago.</br>  <br> Ainz-sama, it seems that to regain my combat abilities to serve you to the best of my abilities, you will have to deflower me. </br>  <br>He wouldn't buy it.</br>  <br>He'd probably just summon Pandora's Actor and tell it to get to work.</br>  <br>Wouldn't be so sure about that though. Remember that before all this stuff when he was fondling her breasts, she asks him if he's gonna take her first time right then and there.<br><br>If she no longer has certain abilities, he'd feel responsible because he'd know that it's because of the change in her programming that she lost those abilities.</br></br></br>  <br>There's 37 chapters out right now, and the release rate is around 1-2 chapters a day.</br>  <br>Your waifu got groped anon.</br>  <br>you mean a week.</br>  currently reading vol 2. Why is it so boring?  Is it Tuesday yet? <br>I'm dying here...</br>   Denpa+CoffeeFlux not even out yet <br><br>Dang, I had hope.</br></br>  <br>maybe K-On is more to your liking.</br>  <br>The guardians seem to treat their time spent guarding the tomb as their actual past, and on top of that the game didn't allow 18+ actions. I get the feeling that anything done in Yggdrasil is as car as their experiences go.</br>  <br>We've had at least 1 chapter a day this whole week, so no.</br>  <br> refusing to accept litterature you like has flaws </br>  <br>Still though, if anon is right, and she can no longer ride her familiar, it's because of the change.<br><br>Changing "Slut" to "Devoted waifu" is a pretty fucking change.</br></br></br>  <br> state something subjective <br> present no argument after <br> antagonizing posters with lel ur taste is shit :^) <br>ayyy</br></br></br></br>  <br>maybe I'm misunderstanding something. Today is the only day in the week we've gotten a chapter. And we won't get another one till next Saturday. How is that one chapter a day?</br>  <br>I think you should follow the conversation instead of posting right after you find something you think is wrong.</br>  <br>he is just the bone of his bait. why bother</br>  <br>Don't bully me</br>  <br> Denpa+CoffeeFlux not even out yet <br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>Sorry, but you killed my joke real hard.  I was just claiming another LN was related to Overlord because the protagonist becomes a slime like HeroHero and both MCs are overworked slaves of society. Amusingly enough it's almost the exact opposite of Overlord and is ridiculously comfy despite MC being just as paranoid as Ainz while he's way overpowered. </br>  I hope that the second episode has a better atmosphere to it. <br><br>For whatever reason, I found it to be lackluster in the first.</br></br>  <br><br>Does a skeleton slowpoke exist? Because we could surely use one.</br></br>  <br>Oh shit, neat-o.</br>  <br><br>Nope, All supreme beings have an special aura that all floor guardians can sense. PA turning into Ainz wouldn't fool Albedo.</br></br>    <br>wow. we actually had one.</br>  <br>Technically Ainz is a slowpoke because of based Demiurge.</br>  <br><br>Thank you kind skeletanon.</br></br>  <br> He didn't wait until next thread to respond <br><br>Thanks for fucking ruining it.</br></br></br>  <br>Things should start moving with Ainz stepping his leadership and acting the part of a lich overlord next time.</br>  <br>Praise the fucking lord.</br>  Friendly reminder that every one posting is these threads is a  little girl  's skeleton.   <br>He's definitely a solid NE.</br>  <br>That's what Ainz believes, as he doesn't possess any spells to increase someone's lifespan. He does not know how it works for him or for any of his minions.<br><br>You should know by now that Ainz isn't infallible and his knowledge is rather limited. That's why he always tries to err on the safe side.</br></br></br>   BS11 airs on Thursdays so all releases will be at least 2 days late   <br>Oh ho, that's an interesting hypothesis OP, but can he beat Lord Ainz Ooal Gown? And I'm not talking about his Dark Hero Momon persona, the one hailed as the savior of humanity. No, I'm not talking about Momonga, the one cherished as the last Supreme Being. Hell, I'm not talking about Mobonga, the literally autistic item hoarder whom every female wants a bone of either. I'm talking about the guild master and Overlord Ainz Ooal Gown with the secret Eclipse class (which is capable of the ultimate death spell capable of overcoming all resistances and immunities, The Goal of All Life is Death), his original class as a spellcaster (which grant him every D&amp;D spell imaginable like Black Hole, Call Greater Thunder, Flight, Grasp Heart, Lightning Dragon, Obsidian Sword, Reality Slash, Time Stop, True Darkness, Wall of Skeletons, Cry of the Banshee, and Shark Cyclone) and his specialized lich classes, allowing him to summon legions of Death Knights along with legendary ones like Overlord Wiseman and Grim Reaper Thanatos, armed to the teeth with divine level items and the Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown (capable of instantly summoning other high level monsters), inheritor of the Treasury, his old guild mates’ ultra-high tier armor and weapons, and the World-class items within it, each possessing the power to affect the world entirely, the spell Perfect Warrior (which allows him to use arms normally beyond his scope), complete control of every inhabitant of Nazarick, his eight loyal Guardians, seven combat maids and a butler serving him, each capable of engulfing the world in darkness single-handedly if he so desired.<br><br><br>I forgot I had this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reality is hurt.</br>  <br>Reminder that a skeleton isn't inside of us, we are inside of a skeleton.</br>  <br>so does that make insects reverse skeletons?</br>  Why she is so perfect?  <br>Insects don't need their brain to survive so no. Insects are just regular skeletons.</br>  <br><br>But she still remains pure.</br></br>  <br><br> This reminds me of a short story I read as a kid about a girl could only see people and animal's bones since she was born. Like she had X-Ray vision or something. And then they somehow fix that but she doesn't recognize the people around her as her family because she remembers her family being skellingtons.<br> It spooked the shit out of me back then.</br></br></br>   &gt;yfw The throne room's world class item make copies of the guild members when activated   <br>ask tabula<br><br>he programmed her after all</br></br></br>  <br>it's kinda funny how massive Albedo's plots are when her backstory is small compared to her actual backstory which is huge, also the fact that she not important plot related.</br>  <br> The skeleton looks at the mirror <br> Is freaked out by the pulsating bag of flesh and pus inside it <br>Who REALLY has the right to be more freaked out?</br></br></br>  <br>He's an Anti-hero.<br>But really it depends on whose perspective you look at it from. Various people he's helped or saved would call him a hero, inversely his victims consider him a monster.<br>Power aside the actions of him and his organisation are no worse than any typical country (Except that most countries don't have the magic to revive people after accidentally torturing them to death, but they'd probably do it if they could).<br><br><br>Like Accelerator, he'd do anything to protect Nazarick residents but he won't go out of his to harm those who don't threaten them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>We are gonna need some sauce on that story anon.</br></br>  <br>That would be depressing, even for Ainz.</br>  <br> No mention of The Legendary Forest King. <br>I'm disappointed in you.</br></br>  <br> King <br><br>No anon, I'm disappointed in you.</br></br></br>  <br> King <br> Anon..I </br></br>  <br>Can't blame her, hamsters aren't known for being smart.</br>   Supreme One not capitalized <br><br>Wow, might as well go back to funi</br></br>  <br>The true last defense.</br>  <br>He went out of his way to  commit lizardmen genocide just to teach Cocytus a lesson and get corpses. Killing that many people for such a minor reason is in no way something any quarterway decent person would do. </br>   &gt;AoG and Divine class item in OP's Shalltear fight <br><br>I hope they change this.</br></br>  <br>Saving a village just because one of his children looked unpleased at the atrocities that were being committed to helpless victims is not something someone evil would either do, as it wouldn't aid him in anyway.</br>  <br><br>Hey, dont look at me, either gave herself that silly name or some locals who were awed by her mere presence.</br></br>  How often do the Overlord LN volumes come out? Twice a year?  <br> the growth of your most treasured children that are at the same time your greatest assets is minor <br><br>By your logic, it's completely normal for someone to rise from a lowly private to supreme commander not having ever killed someone in his life directly or indirectly. After all, you just gotta train him through moar simulations!</br></br></br>  <br>Once every 4 month</br>   That ED <br>Best ED of the season. Based So Bin.</br>  <br>Do studios usually let artists just make shit like that for anime? I feel So-bin is an exception.</br>  <br>It saves Madhouse money.</br>  Currently on volume 2<br><br> mfw when the Swords of Darkness   members get dead. <br> NOOOO, God no. I liked them.  God, Clemetine's a bitch.  Man, I hate this feeling of being taken off guard. Spoil me. Do other characters like the Swords die as well? Enri? Enfrea? Gazef? </br></br></br>  <br>I'll just say, don't get attached to anyone.</br>  <br>I hope they keep saving money. I wouldn't mind if it was just a 30 min slideshow of Based So Bin's art depicting everything.</br>  <br><br>side characters have a very low survival rate</br></br>  <br>I'll let you down easy, anon.<br><br> Enri becomes a militant commander in her village because of the goblins allowing her to learn the skills of a leader. Enfrea is steadily doing research for Ainz. Gazef's fine. </br></br></br>  <br>Anyone not in papa bone's camp are pretty much all red-shirts.</br>  <br><br>Someone should have warned me.<br><br><br>Oh, thank fucking Christ. I can breathe now. Its not a "for now" situation, r-right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just wait for vol 7</br>  <br> Swords of Darkness <br>I'm glad  they're dead. They brought Aniz-sama sadness. <br><br><br> Aniz will break one day. I wonder how he and the tomb will handle that then. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gazef is kill, anon </br>  <br> short story i read as a kid <br><br>yeah good luck with that</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll concede that having dependable leadership isn't a minor concern, but that doesn't mean you visiting your neighoring kingdom and slaughtering them isn't an evil thing to do. Would you find it acceptable if some asshole killed half your nation and pillaged your corpses on the off chance that someone might be able to put up a fight against his forces?</br>  <br><br>Gazef is   a soldier of the kingdom <br>Ainz   massacres their army <br><br>what do you think happened to him, anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  I love this poster.  <br>That's a lie. Quick. T-tell me you're lying.</br>  <br>I'm lying.</br>  <br/>    <br>We've only got spoilers of chapter 1 of volume 9 so far, don't we?<br><br>It's not as if the LN has followed the WN completely. After all, some characters who lived in the WN ended up dying in the LN instead.</br></br></br>  <br> After all, some characters who lived in the WN ended up dying in the LN instead. <br> Whoops, got my wires crossed here. Never mind, seems like Gazef is dead after all. </br></br>  <br>Swords of Darkness still lives on, happily in the WN world  ;_; </br>  <br>In the WN,  Gazef survived and Reaven died . In the LN,  Gazef died and Reaven survived. </br>  <br>Albedo arguing with Hero about why Ainz is the best ruler while Maou and Ainz discuss technology and leadership over their respective evil lairs. I want to see this.</br>  <br>Papa bones is so moe</br>  <br>More like she's yelling at Maou for even talking to Ainz.</br>  <br>It's alright anon, I chuckled.</br>  <br> My waifu, no touch. <br><br>too bad, that's not how it works, you cuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I was only pointing out that it was definitely not a minor thing, not everyone replying to you is one person anon.</br>  <br>You've got a point, she looks pretty excited about whatever she's talking to Ainz about.</br>  <br>Who is this artist? It's not Maoyuu's Akira is it? Cause Maou and Hero look way different. Actually if anything Albedo looks like Akira's style the most.</br>  <br>BASED<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His first name really should be Based So-bin from now on.</br>  <br> Not So-Based </br>  <br> implying Rubedo doesn't solo </br>  <br>Yeah Maou discussing  potatoes  with Ainz and Albedo flipping her shit at her tits while Yuusha calms her down</br>    <br><br>This would be interesting if only to see Nazarick's denizens beating living crap out of maouyuu's characters.</br></br>  <br>I dunno man. The Hero is retarded strong.</br>  <br>It's as if he's got the strength of a  world savior. </br>  Anyone got the mega link for the updated chapters? I didn't grab it when I should have.  <br>Should've posted in this thread earlier.</br>  <br>Yes, go back to the last thread and get it.</br>  <br>don't wanna. Too much work. Feed me.</br>  <br><br>Well yeah, but I just don't see him strong enough to pose a threat to any floor guardian.<br><br><br><br>alright here you go:  _______________*unzips dick*____________________ </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need an adult</br>  <br>Hero's magic can blow up entire mountains easily. I think he'd give them a good run for their money.</br>  <br><br>But can he stand against a sexually deprived Albedo who's bursting with jealousy because his Supreme One is talking with another bitch?</br></br>  <br>If that's the case, he can probably beat Shalltear, who is the strongest guardian.<br><br>He still gets wrecked by Ainz' instadeath spell and any WC weapon however.</br></br></br>  <br> JRPG hero vs JRPG villains underlings <br><br><br>it can only end one way, anon</br></br></br></br>  i hope the LN will adopt the WN part where Papa Bones tried to generate flesh or the part where he did an undead orchestra to a country..  <br> standing here </br>  <br>Shalltear is only the strongest Floor guardian if you discount PA or Albedo's WC wand/scepter</br>  <br>I wouldn't be so sure anon...</br>  <br>Who is this semen demon?</br>  <br>Wrong. The guardians can interchange WCs at any time, so judging them based on it is not a good criteria. Also, PA is not a floor guardian and neither is Sebas.</br>  <br>Of course not, the more Ainz she's deprived of the greater her succubus power grows.</br>  <br>Lou Zhenhua</br>  <br> or the part where he did an undead orchestra to a country. <br><br>How much money do I need throw at the screen to see this animated?</br></br></br>  <br>Why did he do this?</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>Eh. Victim's around, though.</br>  <br>PA guards the Treasury and is thus a Guardian( just not a floor guardian), also the 4th Floor Guardian is Stronger than Shalltear as well( though it's too stupid to leverage it's greater stats in a fight).</br>  <br>He is an Area Guardian and yes, if he copies Touch Me, he might be able to win against her. Also, Hero would wreck Gargantua, especially because it can not use WC items, so there was no point mentioning it</br>  <br>Also, if you really felt like getting nitpicky about strong NPCs, mention Rubedo or the Area Guardian of the Cherry Blossom whatever instead.</br>  Best volume so far?<br><br>3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4</br></br>  <br>pretty much.</br>  <br>I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed volume 3. I hear volumes 6 and 9 are just as good.</br>  <br>Good. looking forward to them.</br>  <br>i liked them all basically but that looks about right</br>  <br>Volume 4 is probably the worst, although its not bad by any means. Volume 5 is a buildup volume as well, so it is not like it will be too great either (besides the sheer value of seeing Sebas BTFO'ing everyone).</br>  <br>I can agree with this.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>So we're pretty much saving the best for last. <br><br>Good, good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8 is the best. <br><br> Guardian Side stories. </br></br></br>  <br>It's true hero is the most broken character in his own series. But he technically has no-one even remotely strong to fight, so we don't really know his limits. So yeah, it's kind of hard to say.</br>  <br>No, 9  Kingdom massacre. Gazef's death </br>  <br><br>is maouyuu getting a new anime or something?</br></br>  <br>Not that I know of. Would be neat though. Are they from the same studio?</br>  <br>I wish the original anime was made using this art style from the manga instead of the LN.</br>  <br>They should have done it in the manga art style. Far more comfy, and fits Hero's personality more.</br>  <br> Might <br>Judging by how  Ainz in Touch Me's armor was facetanking her for a solid few minutes with almost no damage  I think 80% Touch Me could crush her pretty easily.</br></br>  Nice to see that Overlord is really popular in China.  <br> &gt;Ainz not lowering himself to be Jircniv subordinate/ally <br>Based LN</br></br>  <br>What are you basing that on?<br>What makes it nice? Is it that they get official translations, thus some of their money is actually getting to the author?</br></br>  <br>The real irony is China bans skeletons and all that shit, as shown when World of Warcraft's Wrath of the Lich King expansion had to undergo a complete overhaul because too many skeletons were in it. Forsaken and Scourge have always had to be changed in WoW as well so that their bones don't show.<br><br>Then again, obviously most of China's generation that reads Japanese LNs sure as hell aren't the same faggots that plague it's government.</br></br></br>  I wonder how long it will take for Sebas to rebel?  <br>As soon as Touch Me shows up.</br>  <br>That's probably why they like it. The forbidden nature of skellies makes them more attractive.</br>  <br>You don't think it'll be sooner? It's only a matter of time until he gets sick of Nazarick's generic villainy and stands up for some fleshbags.</br>  <br>I wish.<br><br>I'm merely basing it off one of the more popular  streaming  websites. Based on premier views, it's the 9th most popular show so far (got some 800K views).<br><br>Then again, there's shit like Game of Laplace and Chaos Dragon which turned out to be complete garbage, so you can expect Overlord to only go up from here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touch Me's character is already retired <br> Made an alt and got transported <br> Ages like a normal human <br> Meets Sebas <br> Both look exactly alike </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OLD MAN FIGHT OLD MAN FIGHT OLD MAN FIGHT</br>  <br> Old lady suddenly crosses the street <br> SPEEDING CARRIAGE GOING 10KMPH ON A COLLISION COURSE </br></br>  <br>I don't know why people keep posting. Zesshi has shown that strong humans don't age. I doubt any player of any race ages.</br>  <br>You're using Bilibili right?<br><br>Do you know how the fuck I'm supposed to watch videos here?

So he would first age when he's a lowbie, then slow down as he gets higher and higher.

Information was sacred and you wouldn't usually share it even with your guild. You could sell good builds or where to found some objects, and even after 12 years most of that info was still a secret. <br><br>Also, given how rare they were, World Items are a pretty fun mechanic. It was a miracle that a guild was able to store that many of them, although they had the two best melee and magic players. <br><br><br>There are only one or three items that could do that (Ouroboros and World Savior are the only ones that can wipe the entire guild), and the Tomb had remained defended over 12 years, three or four of that there was only Ainz guarding 11 WoG items plus a lot of other stuff of the two former best players. If it could have been done that easily, the owners of such items would already have. <br><br>Also, world savior needs a lot of protection until it raises to be really strong, and its owner would have been wiped even before he/she gets close to Nazarick. Right now they have the best intelligence network thanks to having the most powerful spy magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As 'Anime' is a Japanese loanword, it is both singular and plural.

But that ruins sensitivity and cuts bloodflow. So what do you do?</br>  <br>That's bad for you. Apparently some poop can leak out your dick if you're not careful</br>  <br><br>Onahole.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Basically this. I think its called pressure masturbation.<br><br>Basically, lie down on your stomach, preferably grabbing an object like a pillow for support, and move your lower body/pelvis up and down, rubbing it against the object.  If you were a girl, you could use the corner of table-kun. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think my dick got bent downwards because I've been doing this for a long time.

No jerking, just pinching.<br><br>I have never been able to get off normally, but it's this or squeezing my balls with the same stretching process.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, you don't want to do that kind of masturbation. It effects your bloodflow in dangerous ways.

I can understand every now and then to change things up, but once you finish it all goes to hell.</br>  <br>rather deal with HS shitty typesetting than wait for their delayed episodes</br>  <br>I get the pinching and ball stuff, but is there anything wrong with the stretching bit? It seems perfectly natural but I never hear anybody talking about it.  If I ever do have sex I'll never have to worry about blowing early. Absolutely cannot cum unless I will it. </br>  <br>Aren't there people who get their kicks by masturbating in places where they more likely to be found? Think of it like that. The risk just increases the amount the total amount of sexual pleasure.</br>  <br>Don't do this kind of masturbation. It'll negatively impact your sex life in different ways.</br>  <br>Yeah, no the risks of this is less masturbating in a public place and more grabbing a random little girl and rubbing it between her thighs.</br>  <br>being found =/= breaking your dick</br>   this thread <br>man, and I though I was the weirdo for using dildos to masturbate</br>  Enough about boys, where do girls do it?  <br>They can do it?</br>  <br>Do you understand my pain? I've been trying for the past thirty minutes but I can't do it. I've done it my way, the way I learned by myself, for so long I don't know how to do it with my hands. Nothing I try is working. Is this the choice I have to bear for the rest of my life: either never masturbate again or destroy what I hold dear completely?</br>  <br> What? <br><br>I cannot fall asleep any other way.</br></br></br>  <br>I think girls have to rub the area and it feels good</br>  <br>Tables</br>  <br> On the toilet before I take a shower/shit <br>I'm with you.</br></br>  <br>So the safest masturbation is by hand, isn't it? I have not actually tried to fap by hand.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's the safest. If you are having difficulties converting use some lotion or something.</br>  <br>I had a fracture myself. But thankfully it wasn't severe enough to impact erection.<br><br>I can hardly jack it without being too violent. Can't do it on a toilet or shower because I would damage the room. Can only hump.

If you're properly aroused it shouldn't take a lot of jerking it to cum. Watch some porn that has your favorite fetishes and just get a natural boner then jerk it. If you can't cum within 3-5 minutes, something is really wrong with your dick/libido/mind.</br>  <br>Enjoy your shit subs and cancer.</br>  <br>I wasn't that impressed with their translation and script last time.</br>  <br> Masturbating in the shower <br>How do people do this? Its just uncomfortable, standing and masturbating, but you also have the conflicting sensation of the water hitting either your stomach or back which is more distracting rather than relaxing when you're trying to get a load off. And plus, everything is wet with water, which is a pretty shit masturbatory lubricant when it comes down to it. Honestly its more comfortable to be sitting down or lying down rather then standing and beating it in the shower.<br><br>Plus, isn't the point of showering to be clean? Why dirty yourself in the process and clean all the gross cum-water mix off your cock, balls, and taint instead of cleaning and then taking a shower?</br></br></br></br>  <br> gross cum-water mix off your cock, balls, and taint <br>The cum should spurt out, not dribble onto your balls. Fap less.</br></br>  <br> standing <br>You've got it all wrong</br></br>  <br> 時間帯 translated as "Where" </br>  <br>In bed before sleeping masterrace.  Who wants to join me? </br>   KARA DA NO SHIN KARA ICCHAIMASU <br> S-O-X! S-O-X! S-O-X! S-O-X! S-O-X! <br>Why is the ED so fucking catchy?</br></br>  I can't fap in the shower. Standing up kills my boner.  <br> clean all the gross cum-water mix off your cock, balls, and taint instead of cleaning and then taking a shower? <br>You aren't shower fapping correctly if you're getting it all over yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>I actually learned how to masturbate with this method. In fact it was the only way to fap from about 10 til I turned about 21-22 where I was finally able to fap properly using my hands. I have been doing with my hands ever since.<br><br>Its a lot messier because you get cum all over your stomach and bed. Which can then stain the bed through the sheets. Plus you need a bed to fap which is a whole different logistic. And from what other anons in this thread said it may cause bloodflow problems. I did not know this but luckily my guy has been doing fine and it has been nearly a decade since I quit so I hope I dodged the bullet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>aren't you just humping your pillow?</br>  <br>My nigga, the comfiest way to jerk it.<br><br><br>In what way?<br><br><br>How would that even cause penile fracture? You don't bang your dick on the bed with extreme force, you hardly ever move. Maybe if your weight is 200 kg it's dangerous, but otherwise I don't see how it's any more dangerous than using your hand. <br>I've been masturbating like that for 19 years now and yet to see any negative effects. Is there a source to your claims or it's something your mom said to you to keep you from jerking off?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Phone in one hand, penis in other while lying in bed <br> tfw not even an option </br>  <br>Shower of course.</br>  <br>I just back my ass up as far as I can when i'm about to cum then lean forward a little bit in order to aim my dick at the inside of the toilet bowl kinda like in my diagram I made</br>  <br>Whether it can cause penile fracture depends on a lot of things your total weight, like you mentioned, penile bent, position, firmness of the mattress, etc. Doesn't necessarily mean it will. All I know is that since I switched to using hands, my sensitivity has definitely increased.</br>  <br>That's ridiculous. Fapping releases chemicals that help you sleep, reduce stress, and relax headaches. It's like a wonderful cureall. Thanks to fapping in bed, I haven't been sick for over a decade now.</br>   fapping with your hand  <br> in 2015 <br><br>fucking why</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is what I do. Handfags are missing out.</br></br>  <br>It also cures nasal congestion.</br>  <br>It's thanks to fapping in bed that I cured my homosexuality and met my waifu. Everyone should do it.<br><br> These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA </br></br></br>  <br>I still live with my parents and don't need them finding onaholes</br>  <br>I can't bend my back forward enough.</br>  <br>Shower.</br>  <br>On top of running washing machines</br>  <br>I'm the same way with the legs, thought I was the only one.</br>  <br> diagram </br>  <br> and relax headaches. <br><br>It makes it worse for me.<br><br> I might be somewhat M, but I find joy/ challenge in fapping while feeling pain </br></br></br></br></br>   masturbating <br>I seriously hope none of you do this unironically.</br>  <br> not masturbating gently </br>  <br>The only people who say they don't masturbate are junior high school students who think it's embarrassing</br>  <br>I have trouble keeping it up does that count as not doing it?</br>  <br>You can't honestly be serious. Red that post again.</br>  <br> I'm the only one that can only masturbate in front of a computer? I just can't get it up anywhere else, and even if for some reason I do I can't finish the job till I come back home and sit in front of the pc, one time I travel to the jungle for 1 week, couldn't fap all that week, first thing I did when I came back home was fap for 8 hours straight. </br>   fapping in the morning  <br>The fuck? Why would you want to waste it all so early? <br>I usually just have short sessions of edging to keep me nice and horny all day long and release it before going to sleep</br></br>  <br>Hell, I even kiss him on the head</br>  <br>I try not to fap unless I absolutely can't control it anymore which is usually once every 2 weeks or so. I used to fap everyday and felt like shit. Wasting an hour or so jerking it just to get like 5 seconds of pleasure. Shit's unproductive. I didn't want to be weak minded and reliant on that shit because up to a certain point, fapping is all mind over matter, so I decided to become my own boss and train myself to not fap. Fapping twice a month is pretty good progress for me.</br>  <br>Alternatively you can try laying on your back with some doujins that make you diamonds. By flexing the base of the shaft in intervals you're able to build up and cum without any sort of actual stimulus on the dick itself. It's hard and multiple times I've given up and finished with a quick jerk but it's produced some of the longest orgasms I've ever had.  Almost prostate orgasm tier. </br>  <br>Look at all that money you wasted. You're really no different than a normalfag buying a CR subscription and streaming when you can torrent for free by using your hands.</br>  <br>I don't know? Maybe the morning wood is too much for some people?</br>  <br> Like causing penile fracture <br>This scares me and I think about it every time I crank it.</br></br>  <br>I wish I had that much self control<br><br>I'm too much of a slut for that.</br></br></br>  <br>that's not how it works.</br>  <br>It really can't be helped anon. We're all weak minded people, and we're sexual beings by nature. We get urges and have to release them. The key is not becoming a fap addict. Balance is power.</br>  <br>yes, also SSR meds fuck up my pace and number of erections</br>   this entire thread is filled with guys talking about when and how they beat their meat. <br><br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  <br> morning shower <br>That's like the only time I won't do it.<br>Masturbating in the shower fucking sucks.</br></br></br>  i can't believe no one brought up the #1 reason to not jerk off in the shower<br><br> cooked/congealed semen sticking to everything and everywhere that doesn't rinse off so it's a ticking timebomb </br></br>   morning shower <br>To what purpose? Do you people sleep in filthy beds or something?</br>  <br>I don't get why it's so popular. Hot water makes all viscous and shit and it's impossible to get off your hands, floor, dick</br>  <br>bed head, sleep sweat if it's too warm</br>  <br>You sweat in your sleep anon.</br>  Anyone else invent various poses for masturbating.<br><br>Most recently I've made a pose which I like to call the delinquent where I raise my leg and place my foot on the wall like I'm threatening someone.</br></br>  <br><br>Man, I thought I was the only one. Also, I'm 90% sure that the "it damages your dick" thing only applies to the metod where you lie facedown in bed and hump. I've been doing this for years and everything's fine down there aside from a slight lean, although I'm still a virgin so I don't know if I'd have problems with sex or not.</br></br>  <br> prostate orgasm  <br>Literally how? Be detailed.</br></br>  Doesn't semen get stuck in the shower drainage?  <br>Seems harder to finish in the shower</br>    <br>did you watch the episode? the internet porn was delete</br>   in the shower that popular <br>But it's doing it while standing is awkward. Why not do it sitting on the toilet or counter and releasing right into the tissue in your other hand/onto the bath towel if neither hand is free?</br>  <br>not him but you take hot showers and see how it gels up, right? it'll clump up along with the hair and form an unholy ball of stuff. i have... extracted this concoction from my drain a few times in the past before i decided to put a mesh filter on the drain that i can just clean out once a week or two.<br><br>(the clog was quite unholy)</br></br></br>  <br>Personally speaking it just helps me wake up, I'm not a morning person in the least.<br><br>And that said yeah, like other anons fapping in the shower never made much sense to me. Like I get how actual shower sex is appealing, but fapping alone in there leaves you stranded without anything to look at.</br></br></br>  Why is the percentage so high for shower and so low compared to every other option? 85% is a really huge number. Do japs dont have any other options? Personally i do it when i feel like it, usually before sleeping,  sometimes at/after work in the bathroom <br><br>When it says shower do they just mean the place or when they are actually showering? I can understand grabing my tablet into the shower sitting down and fap into the showersdrainage. However i think fapping while actually showering is pretty weird, you cant use material (books, tablet, computer) and standing up while fapping is not that comforable. <br>What am i missing, almost seems like woman were part of this statistic aswell and maybe they prefer the shower much more</br></br></br>  <br>You just refuse to acknowledge anything that does not fit into your own narrow set of preconceptions. If you'd take some time to think about it though, you'd realize that I'm not saying anything too strange.<br><br>For example imagine that you have two meals, one from some shitty fast food restaurant, and one from the best restaurant in town. However, the good meal has been left sitting in the refrigerator for a day or two and then reheated in the microwave. As a result, the quality of both meals is relatively similar. But eating the reheated meal, you can at least think about the quality it once had, while the fast-food meal, while fresh, you know could never have tasted better than what you have in your hands. As a result, even if the reheated meal tastes worse, it in fact will make you happier.<br><br>Let's extend the analogy a bit further, and now assume you have ordered meals from every restaurant in town, and then kept them in the refrigerator for a day or two, and then reheated them all. Whether the original food was good or bad, they now taste more or less the same, as shitty leftover food. But because of this, you, as a consumer, have no way of knowing if the leftovers came from the best restaurant in town, or from a more mediocre place. You could say that you would be inclined to believe that their source was much more impressive than it most likely actually was.<br><br>Even if the food tastes bad, well that is only natural, because you are only eating reheated leftovers. But you know that if you ate it in the restaurant it would have been delicious, and so happily finish off the meal under the assumption that you have just eaten something of quality.<br><br>There is nothing more sad than knowing that what you have is the best you will ever have, and still finding it to be lacking. I will take an inferior version that allows me to preserve my dreams any day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>get into fetal position, move hips while 'prostate massager' is inserted, you will feel it.<br><br>technically you get off because your head is rubbing part of your hips but it's about as close as I got to prostate-only ejaculation.</br></br></br>  Doing it in the shower is quite comfy.<br><br>it's all lubed up and you can go all out without hurting yourself.</br></br>  <br>Unless your shower is fucking tiny or you're a fatass, you can just sit down.</br>  <br> No one in Japan actually sets time apart specifically for masturbating to porn <br><br>Nips further proving they have shit taste</br></br></br>  <br> Needing lube <br>dick cheese is all I need</br></br>   hurr I can't fap standing up <br> hurr I can't fap sitting down <br> hurr I can't fap laying down <br> hurr I can't fap in the shower with the water hitting me boo hoo <br> hurr I can't fap without lube <br> hurr I can't fap by using my hands because that's too mainstream and I'm a special snowflake <br> hurr I can't fap without an onahole <br> hurr I can't fap without a computer <br> hurr I can only fap in this one specific (retarded) way because I don't want to put forth any effort/my libido is fucked/I have autism <br><br>It must suck only being capable of fapping one way. Good job limiting yourselves, faggots. I can fap anywhere anytime without any material (as long as the chance of getting caught/being suspicious is relatively low). But get this:<br> lay on your stomach and fap guys! Best fap ever XD <br>No thank you, I don't want to literally squish my penis and balls under my own weight while fapping and I'm a skinnyfag for fuck's sake; can't imagine how unpleasant it would be if you were fat. I also don't want to leave stains on my mattress that I sleep on every night.<br><br>Tl;dr you're all doing it wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck is this even bad for you? Am I misunderstanding the position you're describing?</br>  <br>I'm uncut too but precum is not enough sometime, while with water and soap it's perfect.<br><br>And place your dick under the shower stream for extra pleasure/stimulus.<br>A good way to clean it and pleasuring yourself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this.<br>Have you ever invented a new way to masturbate, /a/?<br> Personally, I created a few home made onaholes. </br></br></br>  <br> there was a thread a month ago where everyone said they thought they were the only one <br>It can't damage your dick though that's a myth, unless you're actually crushing and bending it in doing so, though if that were the case you'd have to be a massive masochist to still keep up your libido.</br></br>  <br>change where to when and tell me, in this situation, what difference it makes in the meaning conveyed.  none </br>  <br>i wish boys could get off by just pointing a showerhead at their crotch :x</br>  <br>right, guess it's time to stop fapping in the shower.</br>  <br> :x <br><br>Anyway, girls are a lot messier when it comes to that.<br>That alone make up for not getting off to a stream of water</br></br></br></br>  <br>I used to do this when i first started cumming<br><br>11 till 13 i think<br><br>did it again recently. A bit messy nowadays, but the orgasm feels great</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>materials used?</br>  <br> who says men cant use shower heads to wank? </br>  <br>Never heard about the baking soda acetyl combo?<br>It blasts out clogs like nothing else.</br></br>     not wanking using only your thighs <br>Dont even need to unzip my pants</br>  <br>well, no one, but you'll have to write down a secret manual for posterity if you know how</br>  <br>ironic masturbation?</br>  Anyone managed to cum only with the power of though ? <br>I recall doing it once when younger.</br>  <br>Try it from a greater height. With a moderate force of water stream stimulating the tip you can achieve orgasm in 30-40 minutes. Costs a fuckton of water and you get used to it really fast though but do it once in a month and feels refreshing.</br>  <br> Why is the percentage so high for shower and so low compared to every other option? <br>I'd imagine it's something like<br> Well, my pants are off, might as well. </br></br></br>  <br> That style <br>Now that is some shiggy diggy shit right there</br></br>  <br> handless technique. <br><br>I came in my pants while editing h-manga more than once, hands on keyboard. That counts?</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry micropenis-kun but my erection can't fit in my pants.</br>  <br>It's been a while, but I used a toilet paper roll as the body, extended it by sticking another one around it and locking it on the other side with a shower gel head or something like that. Filled it inside with toilet paper and shower gel. Also, duct tape to make things hold.</br>  <br>you mean you never did? Just set it to a strong pressure setting and hold it at the bottom of your penis gland, if it feels tingly its the right spot, takes forever but eventually it will lead to a very strong and messy orgasm (youll get jizz glued to every body-hair in the vicinity and that shit sticks very hard when it came in contact with water).</br>  <br> Aim the shower head at your head, find an angle that works for you. I use the tug method to work the shaft, you can try different methods. When you're about to cum aim the shower head against your hole. You'll become weak /a/non, you'll become very weak </br>  <br>It goes down to your ankles?<br>The whole point is you point it down your pants leg mate</br></br>  <br>do you just point it right on the tip? like right on the urethra? (wouldn't that hurt, if not then, then afterwards because of the pressure forcing water in or hot water drying out the mucous membrane)</br>  <br>shower gel is a horrible lubricant though, shit burns like hell afterwards.</br>  <br>Nah, that shit chafes.</br>  <br>yeah makes sense, still that applies to the bathroom at work and before going to bed aswell. Especially the bed choice is pretty popular around here (for me aswell)</br>  <br>A bit lower and on the underside. You can easily find the spot if you try.<br> No I won't make a picture how to do it. </br></br>   jacking off in the shower <br>SHIGGY</br>  <br>9000 hours in MS paint,</br>  I can't mastubate standing up, and doing it sitting down takes like ~2 hours. Usually gives more intense orgasms though, although that may be for different factors than just me sitting down. <br>I have no clue how people manage to do it in the shower, shit just doesn't work AT ALL.<br><br>Anyone else like this?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Try applying pressure below your balls.</br>  <br>Have you read the thread? Almost everyone seems to have some malfunction.</br>  <br> morning shower <br>But Japan bathes at night.<br><br>JAPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just... sit down in the shower.</br>  <br>Just remember to check for spiders before using.</br>  <br>Shower in the morning to wash off night sweat, bath at night to wash off day dirt.</br>  The things I'd teach her.<br><br>She deserve dozen of doujins and  one with emotionless sex </br></br>  <br>Why would they sweat at night? Don't they have AC?</br>  <br>I feel like an idiot when doing that, and my penis doesn't like feeling like an idiot.<br><br><br>I can. It took a long time but I can. I used to spend 24 minutes just leaning against my shower wall tugging at my flaccid penis and then I had to give up in case my family got suspicious as to why i was taking that long of a shower.<br><br>After numerous failed attempts as a teenager I eventually taught myself, and even though it has been like 6 years, I can still do it.<br><br>I actually blew a load in the shower earlier today</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone have AC.</br>  i want all these new techniques, but even with deadgrip i take like 10 minutes to orgasm. and for some reasons my boners are not that strong or lasting.<br><br>i havent masturbated in like 5 days and i feel only slightly horny sometimes, and my boners still dont appear randomly, only when i brush against it or actually hold it or slightly jerk it a little does the erection begin.<br><br>i just want constant random diamont boners and cum from brushing against my pants</br></br></br></br>  I sure love anime and manga  <br>Even if you have AC you will still sweat in your sleep.</br>  When fapping in the bed, nude or clothed?

But that shit won't fly if you're a man and you exercise daily. Even if deodorant can mask your armpit odor and the rest of the smell mostly goes away from letting the sweat dry, you'll still have a bunch of salt all over your body from the dried sweat.<br><br>Besides, I shower twice a day sometimes, depending on when I work out, and my skin looks perfectly healthy.</br></br></br>  <br>i enjoy the feeling of just skeeting right over the bowl and onto the floor<br><br>especially at hotels</br></br></br>    <br><br>cum has a nice smell.<br><br>but i clean my sheets every week, also people overestimate how much it will smell, as in it will barely if not at all</br></br></br></br>  <br> exercise daily </br>  <br><br> not exercising daily for your waifu </br></br>   Not whacking off and then rolling onto your back like a roley-poley and cumming on your face/mouth    0.5 did it at school. <br>What in the fuck Japan.</br>  <br>Now I need some material including this.</br>  <br> not exercising daily to admire your own swole body </br>  <br><br>i actually came during class like 5-10 times in my life.<br><br>i said in a corner at the back, and there where not a lot of people on the backseats at the time. i put my hand in my pants and started jerking very quietly, i came while looking at thighs. nobody ever knew.<br><br>HELL I FUCKING MASTURBATED TO GIRLS IN A BUBBLE BATH. i had to stop every time the bubbles went away and continue when they came again. only 1 time though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2YK<wbr>gqjK6dRY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>What the fuck are those halfassed push up ?</br>  <br> HELL I FUCKING MASTURBATED TO GIRLS IN A BUBBLE BATH <br>You were in the bath with them?</br></br>  <br>You're my hero anon.</br>  I really hope the threads stay like this the whole season.  <br>yes, i was looking at them sometimes. i dont think they ever knew.<br><br>i also masturbated in train toilets a lot and like 5-10 times in trains (as in public areas. when i was alone)</br></br></br>  <br>I remember I used to fap to shit on the TV, obviously non-pornographic shit, while family were in the same room. And the only thing blocking them from seeing me was my legs sat up in front of me.</br>  <br>Sort of tangential, but when I was in kindergarten I had to take a monster shit, and it was taking me so long that the teacher sent another kid to check on me (it was probably the worst kid she could have chosen too, because he wasn't a really well behaved kid) and that kid proceeded to poke his head over the stall barrier so he could bug me until I was finished taking my monster shit.<br><br>I never used a public restroom after that until long days spent on a college campus forced me to. I also avoided eating breakfast and lunch during middle and high school to facilitate this toilet-free lifestyle, which probably stunted my growth.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>man these techniques look hella complicated?!<br><br>you sure that they work as-advertised?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   this thread <br>Every day I wake up and thank moot  who?  for allowing me to share a website with you people</br>  <br>Good ol' fapping with hand and lotion is classic</br>   standing up <br>How? I cant do this without loosing strength in my legs. Everytime I release when standing up my knees buckle and I fall on them. The shower flooring is tiled too so it hurts when I dont catch myself</br>  I fapped on an airplane toilet. I bet you fuckers never done that  <br>While it's in flight? How does it feel knowing that air stewardess were walking around outside that small toilet?</br>  <br> Everytime I release when standing up my knees buckle and I fall on them <br>I never matched this level of orgasm and I always stand when fapping.<br><br>I feel like I'm not using my dick at its full potential.</br></br></br></br>  I know some anons said it is difficult to masturbate while standing up, but is this a common thing?<br><br>I can still do it but it definitely takes longer and just feels less intense. I can't tense my legs up or anything like I can while sitting or laying down</br></br>  <br><br>I've done it once. It was okay, too cramped.</br></br>  The best way to masturbate  <br>i fapped to stuff like tits in yu-gi-oh and other anime before i exploded when i started taping late night softcore porn, still want to re find some of those movies : &lt;</br>  <br>Does not bother me because I'm too fixated on imaginating the sex with waifu</br>  <br><br>I just remembered i used to share a room with my little brother when i was 15 and i'd wait for him to fall asleep and then jack it with the laptop.<br><br>The thing is that the screen light meant from where he slept he had a clear well lit view of me jerking off and my facial expression when i blew my load</br></br></br></br>  <br> discovering HBO and Cinemax aired nude girls at night </br>  <br><br>I do that every time I'm on a long flight bitch. I must have fapped in the Mile High club about 20 times now.</br></br>  <br>I think it's mostly mental. Imagine yourself having a really powerful orgasm just as it starts to happen. It helps if you put in some good thrusts with your pelvis instead of just moving your hand. Your knees probably won't buckle, but you might find your back loosening up so that you bend forward a little. Pretty sure that's actually a kind of reflex but I forget its name.</br>  <br> (SOX調べ) <br>This</br></br>  <br> Not masturbating on school toilet </br>  <br><br><br>Ah I thought I was the only one.

Gregory was always canon.</br></br>  <br>He wasn't in the manga is what anon is referring to.</br>  <br>I think he's saying he wasn't in the manga but Gregory is so unimportant to anything it doesn't matter.

Early in Dragon Ball he says to Puar he's only scared of girls his age, and he's scared of Bulma, therefore they are the same age. Yamcha is 38, same as Bulma. MAYBE he's a year or two older at the most.</br>  <br>He probably does, but wouldn't show it because pride.</br>  Spanish dub when?  <br>hes not kicking the shit out of someone, so him smiling is totally out of character</br>  <br>Bulma isn't 38 though</br>  i just saw a raw pop up on nyaa  Watching Vegeta being such a dick right now on  toonami  is fun compared to how he is now on Super.  <br>She is 38 in BoG. That's her canon age. Toriyama says so. You suck it.</br>  omg I loved this episode I already watched the episode with subs in spanish and it was a 10/10 episode  <br><br>are you even vaguely familiar with Vegeta's character at all</br></br>  Where's our speedsubber from episode one.<br><br>Come on fucker we need you.</br></br>  <br> Needing someone who doesn't even have a basic grasp on the English or Japanese language to sub an episode </br>  <br>https://twitter.com/ElSpark15/statu<wbr>s/620065504955203584<br><br> English coming soon.

REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE<wbr>EEEEE</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, she's definitely older based on her age at the start of Dragon Ball vs how much time has passed. Either the writers just made something up and assumed that there wasn't a "right" answer and that no one would fact check them, or Bulma is lying in-universe (if this were the case I feel like they probably would have followed it up with some sort of joke though)</br></br>  <br>Not like this, like this.</br>  <br>She did lie, I thought it was fairly obvious from how the scene played out. She's about 42 actually.</br>  <br>Bulma was obviously lying about her age. She should be 45ish during Battle of Gods based on the manga.</br>  Anyone making a Vegeta Then Vegeta Now picture?

Watching DBZ on  Toonami  and Goku is reading Krillin's mind.<br><br>I Toryiama forgot about that.</br></br>  <br>www.kanzenshuu.com/production/toriy<wbr>ama/</wbr></br>  <br>she really is amazing</br>  <br>Did you ever read the novel journey to the west?? Toriyama was inspired by it. And he based character on that. But the only thing similar between both is character setting like there is one monkey, a girl,a desert bandit and they are on a journey to find an object and to pay tribute he added kintoun and PowerPole other than that there is no similarity. the personality of char are tottaly different. so stop saying it journey to the west. After all the novel have characters derived from ancient Indian deities. Heck the whole chinese culture is nothing but derived from ancient india.</br>  But...will we see Frieza's ultimate form?  When are they going to fight?<br>I want to see some DBZ with modern animation.<br><br> inb4 movies <br><br>Fuck them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The animation so far doesn't impress me at all. Id hate to see a fight.</br>  English subs anyone..? need to watch it... :|  <br>Look the name of the fruits.<br>That's a nice touch.</br></br>  <br><br>they didn't get wished back to life after Buu killed them because animals do not have souls</br></br>  <br><br>this is great and subtle</br></br>  <br>RoF had one.<br><br>BoG had one too actually.</br></br></br>  <br><br>theres only one girl who could steal his heart more<br><br>pls make it happen toricucka</br></br></br></br>  <br> Now it’s impossible to separate Goku from Nozawa-san. <br><br>Haha bullshit senile old man. Sean is the true Goku, not granny japan.</br></br></br>  man.. is anyone gonna sub this quick..? last time... there was a guy who did.... :|  <br> Prince Vegeta, I'm Capsule Corp <br> Perhaps he was wondering why Papa would punch a man before knocking him out of a ring. <br> IF I SHAVE THAT MUSTACHE OFF WILL YOU DIE? </br></br></br>  SUBBED EPISODE WHERE?  <br>Learn japanese or spanish.</br>  The best part of being BR is that subs are already out in Portuguese.  <br>The best part of knowing Japanese is that I dont need to wait for subs.</br>  <br>Spanish subs are out since four hours ago.</br>  <br>Translate for me while I watch it.</br>  <br>I will translate exactly 1 sentence for you. Give me a time frame.</br>  Subbing isn't dead -- if you know Spanish.  Still in love with the opening theme. I hope they keep it for the whole series.  go..rets..go...dynamic..rets..go<br>jesus could they have picked a more boring theme, the man sounds like he's asleep.</br>  <br>I feel like they are appealing to the nostalgia with that OP, I mean the ED is even more nostalgic.</br>   mfw i wish vegeta was my dad   <br>i dont get it</br>  <br>The last one spoken in the episode.</br>  <br> The last one spoken in the episode. <br><br>Let's see....<br>That would be では which means "Well then."<br><br>You're welcome.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks much, anon</br>  <br>what a dick</br>  <br>Hey, I translated exactly what he asked for.</br>  <br>Yeah but Cha la head cha la didn't sound boring he had umph in his voice. I get the same kinda tempo or old style music whatever you want to call it is similar, but the vocals are kinda draining.</br>  <br>I know the fruit on the left is what dodoria was named after but not sure about the right</br>  <br>yea, toriyama wants to make them look young now</br>  <br><br>it's a pomelo<br><br>hint: its Japanese name is zabon</br></br></br></br>  where are fansub groups like FFF, commie now..? still waiting for subs .. :|  <br>Hes not autistic like other edgefags.<br><br>He probably only has tsun and dere in him now.</br></br></br>  please caption /a/  <br>DragonTeam are doing it</br>  <br>Please go and stay go.</br>  The guy Beerus battled looked fucking cool in his transformed state (the yellow guy who turned into a minotaur like demon), Toriyama has still got it /a/  <br>I was wondering the same thing. I always thought he was a manlet compared to her.</br>  <br>How much do you wanna bet Toriyama had nothing to do with his design?</br>    <br>nothing because that's what he does for a living besides working on Dragon Ball.<br><br>He's the monster designer for Dragon Quest.<br><br>Designing cool monsters like that is his specialty.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's making the character drafts, so he had a hand in his design.</br>  <br><br>the time</br></br>  <br>Clock so nips know what time it is.</br>  <br>they are off to train ^_^</br>  <br><br>ayy did this in 5 seconds im to tired to think of something clever</br></br>  <br>Trunks is the Prince of the Prince of Saiyans. As young as he is, I dont think hed entertained by that train.</br>  <br><br>why is it in a screenshot?</br></br>  <br>Because the broadcast has the time permanently in it, therefore the raw ripped from the broadcast has it.</br>  <br>I like.</br>  Dragon Team subs when?  <br><br>why isn't Vegeta calling himself the king of saiyans since his dad died</br></br>  <br>There was never a coronation</br>  <br><br>ohhh well thats nice</br></br>  <br>Well who's gonna stop him from crowning himself king?</br>  Anyone notice this thread is just a notch friendlier than average /a/? Answering newfriend questions and such, no arguing about DB/DBZ/DBGT, etc. Feels nice, man.  <br>King of fucking who</br>  <br>Zarbons ghost</br>  <br>you've gone and did it now</br>  Hey, with all this Sol we could maybe get some attention to the humans? Like, the bros who have been around for decades and all that  <br><br>THE KING OF ALL SAIYANS!</br></br>  <br> himself <br> his brother that he ignores the existence of <br> the pleb that can kick his ass <br> their mutt sons <br><br>He knows there's no fucking point</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> no my feet hurt </br></br>  <br><br>his inferiority complex</br></br>  God dammit, this is what I always wanted. Based Toriyama and Toei.  <br> implying some american voice actor is anywhere near better than japanese voice actor <br>This is why we can't have nice things, americunts.</br></br>  <br> implying Goku should sound he is on helium </br>  There was a copy of the episode subbed by this time already last week, what are you lazy cunts doing?  <br>learn spanish<br>already like 7 subs out there</br></br>  Waiting for BR subs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Bu7<wbr>muZaoTUQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>I meant dubs</br></br>  <br> they were out 1 hour ago </br>  <br> There was a copy of the episode subbed by this time already last week, what are you lazy cunts doing? <br>There wasn't. It was a couple of hours later than this.</br></br>  <br>This one is from Portugal.<br>BR dub is actually good.</br></br>  <br>Portuguese dubs are terrible on purpose.<br><br>Kenshin dubs are equally as amusing.</br></br></br>  <br>my fucking sides.<br><br>i'm so sorry you have to deal with this</br></br></br>  <br>Not as bad as https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Upy<wbr>2SEnP9MU</wbr>  [ ] or https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bo3<wbr>7377GB5M</wbr>  [ ]</br>  So is there any chance the Supreme Kai of Time to appear in Super?  <br>100 episodes is plenty of time to insert as many what if characters as they please, given that they have many universes to work with.</br>  <br>I want the female Buu's to show up too.</br>  THIS MOTHERFUCKER IS CANNON NOW<br><br>WTF!!!</br></br>  Subs fucking when  <br>I am going to say this every episode until Toriyama remembers them.</br>    <br> WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO </br>  ok so I want to get into Dragon Ball now that there's a new series showing but<br><br>I have no idea where to start<br><br>I know most of the plot of DBZ from when my brother was like 15-16 and obsessed with it and I've watched all of the Saiyan saga but that's it<br><br>should I start with the original series (Kid Goku and scantily clad Chi-Chi and shit)? Kai's better than the FUNimation dub, yeah? Any place I could watch the series online?<br><br>cheers /a/nons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>Watch Dragon Ball, all of it<br>Then watch DBZ and skip shitty filer<br>Don't watch Kai, they censored fights and shit</br></br></br>  <br>oh god</br>  <br>Read the manga.</br>  <br>I actually recently bought the entire manga, and read it in a span of about two weeks.<br><br>Read the manga.<br><br>(and then get confused when Super references filler characters like Miss Pizza and Caroni show up in the first episode and you have to check the dragonball wikia to figure out who they are)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga.<br><br>Since you already watched the Saiyan arc, start reading Dragon Ball Minus and then Jaco the Galaxy Patrolman.<br><br>Then the whole DB manga from the beggining.<br><br>You can optionally watch the first series with Kid Goku. It has some fillers, but are not that bad.<br><br>Avoid GT by all costs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you don't want to bother with filler, watch Dragonball Kai.<br><br>It condences 290+ episodes into about 150 or so.</br></br></br>  <br>Better or worse?</br>  <br> it was me , DIO </br>  <br>That guy was in the majin buu arc opening too for years, he's definitely canon</br>  <br><br>I don't think red is a good shade for vegeta's lips, I'm thinking more of a purple, maybe even a green?</br></br>  <br>he looks like gt vegeta minus facial hair which should be canon and he should turn super saiyan with that shit</br>  Are you telling me that there are now a series about the going blue hair shit ? is this real life ?<br><br>why is there a tornado of shitty sequels/remakes lately ?</br></br>  http://thevideos.tv/dl<br><br>English subs out.</br></br>  <br>Malaysian subs are GOAT.</br>  <br>Click the CC in the player btw.</br>  Cheers for the replies, anons. Gonna watch the OG Dragon Ball, then Kai, and then read the manga if I have time.<br><br>Are there any fillers from the main dub worth watching? The movies are canon, yeah? Also, any place where I can stream the series?</br></br>  <br>None of the movies are canon. (they can be fun, though)<br><br>We thought Battle of Gods and Revival of F were canon, but now Super is going to be redoing those stories.</br></br></br>  <br> complaining about blue hair of all things <br>So it wasn't stupid when he magically dyed his hair blonde? Or do you hate super saiyans in general? I would hate to think you're a hypocrite.</br></br>  <br>http://thevideos.tv/5a33cvd2tsrz.ht<wbr>ml</wbr></br>  <br>Should I replace Bulma's face with Gohan's or Doc's?</br>  <br>This is legit.</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>10876<br><br>Torrents out.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Nah SS was cool cause it was original, it hadnt been done before. Blue hair is just lazy and dumb.</br>  <br>finally</br>  <br> Gonna watch the OG Dragon Ball, then Kai <br>You'll get bored to tears.<br> Are there any fillers from the main dub worth watching? <br>Goku's Ordeal is pretty great.<br> The movies are canon, yeah? <br>No.<br> Also, any place where I can stream the series? <br>KissAnime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might have a point but literally (literally) anything they could have down as a new power-up would get criticized anyway, so why not do something relatively inoffensive that doesn't shake the character designs up too badly like SS4 from GT? I really think it is damned if they do, damned if they don't when it comes to the new power-ups.<br><br>I think nostalgia blinders hit hard for Dragon Ball. If Super Saiyan 3 had come out today everybody would treat it like an awful jumping the shark moment.</br></br></br>  Beerus is in his own hyperbolic time chamber?  Is Whis the god of time?  <br>Should I watch this or wait for Dragon Team?<br><br><br>Yeah they couldn't win either way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>it was already stupid to an extend, and that's exactly WHY it needed to be done only once.<br><br>don't go arguing with people when you don't even know what your argument is gonna be about.</br></br></br>  <br><br>no, this is patrick</br></br>  <br>These subs weren't very good last week so I wouldn't hold my breath. They were okay in the fact you can understand what's going on or at least have a general idea, but they are pretty shitty. <br><br>It's up to you, watch shitty speedsubs quickly or wait a bit for a quality translation.  Or do both </br></br></br>  <br><br>I hated that motherfucker so much.</br></br>  <br>Ss was not stupid it was one of its kind ssj3 and ssgss.</br>  <br>What font?</br>  <br>Well there's this in Resurrection of F</br>  hunter x hunter is waaaay better than this shit<br><br>too bad the fanbase is 100% homosexual</br></br>  Are they going to reanimate Battle of Gods and Revival of 'F' or transplant the existing animation into DB S?  <br>I believe Bulma's party is taking place on a ship this time, so probably reanimate.</br>  <br>yes, that's why I said to some extent. there was just no explanation why they turned golden. that's all. Other than that it was pretty fucking original.<br><br>I mean, can you imagine, toriyama dropping that bomb on all the fans so long in the manga. must have been one hell of a shock. but no explanation.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow, they still exist.<br><br>I'm glad.</br></br></br>  i thought this episode would end with bra's conception  <br>They will have sexy times after bulma's birthday with all of that "muh waifu rage" and "I felt loved!" I guess</br>   Kaiō and Co. Tremble at Beerus’ Awakening! <br>The Elder Kaiōshin has sensed that God of Destruction Beerus has awakened after 39 years of slumber. He fears that it will be bad news if Goku learns of this and challenges him to a fight. He contacts the Northern Kaiō, and tells him to keep Beerus’ existence a secret, but…?!<br><br> Kuririn This Week <br>Hurry to Bulma’s Birthday Party!<br>Kuririn and family head by car to Bulma’s birthday party on a luxurious passenger ship! But they get stuck in a traffic jam…?!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's not correct, there isn't a girl it's a non violent scholar, a pig Demi God and a water buffalo Demi God and monkey king. There was no badit, the white horse in journey to the west was a water dragon price. Goku and bulma and oolong were based off that, dessert bandit was actually the water buffalo in the desert. They journeyed to the west to thunder clap mountain to retrieve the sutras of enlightenment for man kind. Power pole is in journey to the west as the rod of power and kiton were the monkey kings shoes. Journey to the west was from China to India.</br></br>  <br> Krillin's episode </br>  <br><br>Depending on how long it takes to Bulma's Party episode, the one who's going to end up being already conceived is Pan.<br><br>But... dammit, they had Pan when they were both 22, if they don't make some timeskip before Bulma's birthday, does that mean they'll probably end up conceiving Pan out of wedlock?<br><br>In any case, Bra should have at least be conceived sometime around RoF arc (if they end up having one in Super).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm the Prince of all cabooses</br>  <br>the driving episode was the greatest filler episode of all time</br>  <br> Final Arc of Super <br> They use the new Dragon Balls to wish back those who died on planet Vegeta by the hands of Frieza <br> Brings all the saiyans back to Earth <br> They make them a new planet right next to New Namek <br> Final Arc mk II: New Namek Saga, replete with Super Ginyu Recoome, Super Ginyu Guldo, Super Ginyu Burter, Super Ginyu Ginyu, and Super Ginyu Jeice. </br></br></br></br></br>  krillin time!  <br>Ya there is no official explanation even though there are explanation about oozaru and saiyans biology and stuff I guess tori himself is clueless and instead of pulling an explanation out of his ass he never really explained thinking that if the explanation is lame then all of its magic will disappear. And I guess one can come to conclusion that since their aura and ki changes to golden that somehow affects their hairs and eyebrows.</br>  <br> that kid <br><br>jesus christ, don't tell me that's his lovechild with android waifu, definitely inherited more of the not-so-bald-anymore fuck than qt3.18</br></br></br>  <br>She is like 2 years old</br>  <br><br>she has his nose</br></br>  <br> implying that isn't the perfect age for most pedophiles on /a/ </br>  <br> DB SoL with Bardock, Gine, Raditz, Nappa, and King Vegeta interacting with the regular cast <br> awkward shenanigans between all the characters that killed each other, like Vegeta and Nappa or Tenshinhan and Nappa or Yamcha and that one Saibaman <br> King Vegeta being proud that his son actually became a Super Saiyan, and then getting pissed when he finds out Goku did it first <br> Bardock meeting his extended family <br> Raditz getting pissed at jobbing to literal children who can go SSJ when he can't <br> Piccolo having a bad feeling about all of it <br><br>I want this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It sucks that Super is basically just a recap of the movies so for the first year of Dragon Ball Super will just be BoG and Revival of F. That leaves only about 50 episodes of 'new' stuff.  <br> Where is maron's nose???</br>  Why again Vegeta calls himself Prince of all saiyans if he's technically the king?  <br>You can't be a king of nothing.</br>  <br>Goku, his sons and Vegeta's brother are still alive.</br>  Where did this Beerus guy come from? Wasn't Freezer supposed to be the most powerful guy in the universe before Goku became a Super Saiyan?  <br>Well I will love that if they retcons the whole events of bog and especially rof and then redo it in a different manner it will be fun.</br>  Has anyone made a webm or at least a gif of Vegeta giving 0 fucks?  <br>Retroactively changing things. Vegeta never mentions Beerus ever till now because LOL KIDS MANGA PLOT</br>  <br><br>I have it. I'll upload it when I can</br></br>  <br> Krillin episode meaning 18 episode <br> Gohan in Gi outfit <br><br>Please deliver.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i rather watch a a db with most focus SoL with some fights mixed into it.</br>  <br>Did you even watched the movie???? Bcoz vegeta was not the one who mentioned him and why the hell am I telling you anything you are probably a troll.</br>  <br>That would be ideal for me too, that would be the other nice thing about bringing back all the relevant saiyans, more characters with the potential to do something other than job, Bardock in particular. I just think that bringing back planet Vegeta or something along those lines would be a great starter to anything SoL related, even if it wasn't 100% SoL.</br>  Who's the best sub group for this anyway?<br>I was waiting for Funi to announce a possible broadcast dub for this but it's so obvious they can't because Toei wanna be cunts about the rights for it.</br>  <br>The official explanation is that Toriyama got tired of coloring in Goku's hair so he came up with a way to make it light colored</br>  <br>you're asking for half the episode</br>  <br><br> two 1 1/2 hour movies will expand over 40+ episodes <br><br>anon-kun, why are you such a math baka?</br></br></br></br>  no matter how long super is gonna be they will somehow wrap it up before the last two chapter of db and I am 100% sure they are going to do that.  <br>And here we have a Vegeta outside his natural habitat.  He's adapting surprisingly well. </br>  Next Saturday I'm just going to record the episode for you guys and put it online  why the fuck was vegeta training at 150 times gravity when he did 500 times before he went ssj. same with the buu saga he is training with trunks and both are in ssj and only 150g  <br>he was getting soft. Nothing to challenge him anymore, he admitted Goku was better than him, he's not training with Goku to push him to be better. <br><br>the frustration about not being able to train and having to fuck off and do it was him getting his head back into the game and finally getting back to training properly.</br></br></br>  <br>No. Actually I read that interview it was torishima who said that when he asked toriyama about hair colour but I guess tori was joking bcoz</br>  <br> Bulma ACTUALLY love that piece of shit <br> Vegeta actually is tsun-tsun for here <br>How? How did it happen? I don't understand.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Yamcha.</br>  <br>DragonTeam and Unison. I didn't watch DragonTeam's last week but from what I understand they are the best. I only mention Unison because it's all we had for Kai and they were fine.</br>  <br>Bcoz if you go by toriyama's previous interview he said that he wanted to show the change in goku' power that's why he did that</br>  <br>Toriyama just throw pairings for shit and giggles  but mostly to have saiyan kids </br>  <br>I already explained it in another thread. Not going to do it again.</br>   Trunks acting like a happy little rich kid <br><br>I hope this time around Trunks and Goten appreciate training and fighting more than Gohan. Certainly not Vegeta or Goku tier obsessed but enough that becoming Gotenks would allow them to keep up.</br></br>  <br>isnt it going to be the one man goku show again?</br>  <br> Gregory <br>who's that?</br></br>  <br>I don't think Gotenks should be too far off them at this point. Probably not later because of the Godly Ki stuff and that but the boost you seem to get from fusion is pretty incredible in itself, Gotenks probably could have beaten Buu if he didn't fuck around so much.<br><br> Seriously, every big fight someone just fucks around until things get too serious. </br></br></br>  <br>you had your chance Yamcha now fuck off</br>  Why does the music suck so much dick?   no barefoot Bulma <br><br>I'm sad.</br></br>  Phantasy Star Online 2 TV anime announced, coming 2016  http://phantasystar.sega.jp/psporta<wbr>l/pso15anniversary/animation/</wbr>  <br>And the English version is never coming. Damn Sega.</br>  <br> this will receive an official translation while the game doesn't </br>  Now if only they'd release the game in English. Actually, no, fuck that. That ship has sailed.  Posting best grill to celebrate this  <br> Best girl <br>That will never show, because its going to be original story, right?</br></br>  <br><br><br>At this point most of the people already hope it doesn't come out in the west, since they are already playing it on their servers with a pretty good fan-translated english patch. <br><br>If it really did come out, everyone in the west would be IP blocked (happened to the SEA version).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It did. In SEA.</br>  It's gonna be absolute shit.<br><br>No anime based from a game has ever been good.</br></br>  <br>If they put at least as much effort as they did in Episode 2, it might be okay.</br>  <br>SEA player here, the "translations" are shit.<br>The game is also bullshit now, SH has 30% more damage than in JP for whatever reason.<br>Some of the costumes have crazy ass augs like 100% rare drop and can only be bought through scratch completion(which is illegal in Japan).<br><br>Everything is expensive, AC hairstyle prices are reaching 150mill a pop.</br></br></br></br></br>  Best girl that will wear that in the anime.  <br>It just means they won't follow the matterboard story, but what kind of story the anime will have is up in the air.</br>   Any anon still playing the game?   <br>Never wear that*</br>   game adaptation <br><br>NOTHING COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG</br></br>  <br>This couldn't be more wrong congratz on being the faggiest.</br>  I never asked for this   tfw its SoL   <br>Nah, it's gonna be as chuuni as blazblue.</br>  I want Lisa to step on me  Taking bets on just how bad this is gonna be.

The translation was awful and changed up a lot of terminology that's been a standard in the series. On top of that, they started with PSO2 vanilla when Japan was already well into Episode 2.<br><br>By vanilla PSO2, I mean before ANY updates were made, including being able to have more than one character per ship without paying and no Braver class.</br></br></br>  <br>If only.<br><br>We still haven't gotten an SoL anime about MMORPG players. Shit would be glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>SEA is on Episode 2 now.<br>The names are weird though, Quna is Kuhna.<br>Funny Traitor costume is changed to Jolly Turncoat which leads to confusion as the costume related weapon is still named Traitor Linear.<br>Border Break is changed to Beyond Boundaries.<br><br>Though players are still in a steady decline.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SoL anime about MMORPG players <br>Oh god I want this so much.</br></br>  <br> Most of the characters are well adjusted people. <br> One of the characters is a neet who basically plays the game 24/7 <br> He's the main source of drama in the anime <br> The anime is an attempt to un-NEET viewers <br> Funded by the government </br></br></br></br></br>   implying it won't be yet another generic "wow I'm stuck in the game" anime   <br>Japan's on Episode 3. Has been since August last year. That means SEA is still a year behind. So it's painfully obvious why they'd switch back over to the Japanese servers.

You better be grateful that she sacrifices herself for your sins.</br>  <br><br> Terrible heroine and terrible romance? <br><br>Not sure is serious Anon.<br><br>Sakura and Shirous relationship is the deepest one in the VN even if she only showed a full appearance in the last route. Their relationship is the most mature and realistic one because it shows the tragic part of being in love. Shirou has to go tru so many troubles to save the person he loves even if he is hurt many times in the process, and Sakura showed how devoted she was to him from the very beggining of the novel, you just get the bigger picture in HF.Sakura and Shirou's relationship was well stablished during the cooking/house scenes that you probably skipped, because lolshonenboy, and it was cemented in Rain.<br><br>You are right on saying it was terrible romance tho, since what it was shown in HF was Love not Romance. In Fate we had a truly forced relationship between Shirou and Saber that basically came out of nowhere, plus it wasn't even close to realistic with Saber being a Heroic Spirit and Shirou a human. In UBW the true protagonist of the route is Archer, and Rin only has her time to shine in the fighting scenes, it was only in the Ufo adaptation that got a puch in the romantic side of her relationship with Shirou. Then in HF,what you see is Love where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it.<br><br>"I really did separate romance" and love with the heroines.<br>Romance is something where a couple blindly pursue each other's ideals. "Love," on the other hand, is something where two people accept each other, including the painful reality that comes with it. There are no ideals to be found there. It's just about coming to terms with reality. They don't even have time to dream... but you can't just keep pushing harsh realities over the hopes and dreams of young people.'' - Nasu<br><br>Also even Nasu ships Shirou with Sakura.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In anime version of her route she is the one who rapes Shinji, right?</br>  <br><br>Lol, she was going to die either way. #homunculusbody.</br></br>  Hey.

No on in that family is happy.</br></br></br>  <br> The prototypical Mary Sue is an original female character in a fanfic who obviously serves as an idealized version of the author mainly for the purpose of Wish Fulfillment. She's exotically beautiful, often having an unusual hair or eye color, and has a similarly cool and exotic name. She's exceptionally talented in an implausibly wide variety of areas, and may possess skills that are rare or nonexistent in the canon setting. She also lacks any realistic, or at least story-relevant, character flaws — either that or her "flaws" are obviously meant to be endearing.  <br> She has an unusual and dramatic Back Story. The canon protagonists are all overwhelmed with admiration for her beauty, wit, courage and other virtues, and are quick to adopt her as one of their True Companions, even characters who are usually antisocial and untrusting; if any character doesn't love her, that character gets an extremely unsympathetic portrayal. </br></br>  <br> She also lacks any realistic, or at least story-relevant, character flaws — either that or her "flaws" are obviously meant to be endearing. <br>So, Iroha.<br><br>Because sure as hell Yukino didn't endear anyone but the white knights</br></br></br></br>  DATO?!  <br>Eruerufu isn't a doll.</br>  You know we're probably going to get a flashback of Hibiki being abused by her dad sometime.  <br>Boys can't use symphogear.</br>  <br>That's the finale for the Symphogear movie.<br><br>The dolls not getting befriended would make them more interesting.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The dolls will be the final boss, like the Nephilim in S2.</br></br>   http://rule34.paheal.net/wiki/Note<wbr>s</wbr> <br> http://booru.org/tos <br><br>B-b-but my beautiful lolis!
