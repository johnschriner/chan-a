Supposedly something big going down today.  Im looking forward to this shit.<br><br>Autistic /u/ bait girl a shit.</br></br>  Iris best girl  Orange a best.  It's started, usual place.  Tell me when the shota is back  <br>Fuck you</br>  You know this show isn't have bad if you imagine that this character has autism.  <br><br>Lain?</br></br>  <br>why autism; PTSD is self-evident.</br>   have   <br>He could of fixed that. Or you can just fuck have.</br>  <br>Dude, the girl is suffering from a mental breakdown and has enclosed herself in this delusion of a normal school life as she cannot handle reality. But she seems pretty stupid but innocent stupid. The world isn't suited for people like her...it's just too sad to watch.</br>  she's just pretending to be retarded  <br>She's been pretending to be retarded since the school burned down. She genuinely lost her shit for months prior to that though.</br>  i still find it really hard to believe no one from the track team was fast enough to get away, they werent even swarmed  <br>And how exactly does that help?</br>  <br>Maybe some got away, they just, you know, ran away from school for some reason? Maybe the zombies were super athletic?</br>  <br>  Maybe the zombies were super athletic? <br>That's actually a possible zombie scenario - for a short time the infected have superhuman strength/speed that can tear their own muscles and break bones, which (also rot) makes them slow shambling type.</br></br>  You do realize she's a but confirmed for it right? Like this last episode basically showed that she was off even before the zombie outbreak.  <br> imagine <br>She was a bullied friendless weirdo who was failing her classes. The zombie apocalypse is the best thing that has ever happened to her.</br></br>  <br> imagine <br><br>Even though she does have delusions because of PTSD, she definitely has autism.</br></br></br>  <br> story talks about complicated psychological disorders <br> too stupid to look up which one it might be <br> lolololol muh autism </br></br></br>  <br> have bad </br>  <br> have bad <br>You know this thread isn't half bad if you imagine OP has autism.</br></br>  <br>Autists are disgusting and should be killed.<br>They are gross, shitty things without soul and no emotions.<br>Therefore she can't be autistic.<br>Fuck autists. Slaughter them all.</br></br></br></br>  I thought she was schizophrenic  <br>It's the endless question with anything zombie related, how could they blind-side everyone during the outbreak.<br><br>In this particular case, a single zombie making its way in a locker room full of unsuspecting students is enough to get them all.<br>There weren't that many people on the tracks, mostly zombies, so it might just be the injured runaways we see getting finished off.<br><br>Also the number 1 trope about zombie movies being that nobody knows shit about zombies, they could get bitten by the injured people they were carrying., or while trying to fight them back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boy the first episode really took its time playing with the mascarade that everything's fine.<br>The manga keeps it short and sweet so we actually get a surprise, but this was drawn out to hell with the dog bullshit.<br><br>Also I don't know how I feel about Lesbian being here from day 1.<br>Did they think it'd be too boring with a group of only 4  hue  people?<br>Is this just a lazy way to not have to draw the mall segment and keep it in school as much as possible?<br><br>Still pretty nice</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was so they don't introduce a new main character mid-season.<br><br>They're going to flashback to the mall thing instead. Her friend is in the OP and everything.</br></br></br>  <br>For a filthy secondary who went in knowing nothing about the series, the first ep was pretty good for me.<br>I thought it was a really boring show that I was going to drop until the last few minutes, then I was "wait what"</br></br>  <br>you're implying people didn't just manage to leave the school<br><br>also it's implied first wave zombie virus was able to spread through other means</br></br></br>  <br> Anon why don't you watch this SoL, you like cute girls doing cute things right? </br>  <br>Even if you could escape from school, you're still surrounded by zombies all around in the town/city/country. You're fucked either way. Once you take away our social organization and our infrastructure, humans are literally naked monkeys.</br>  It's been a while since I haven't been spooked by an anime, in this last episode I thought that  we would see Megu-nee getting horribly chewed up right away, so I was anticipating the scene in horror   <br>At least the dog chasing scene provided us with hints that something is not 'right', so it's actually not pointless.<br>Well, I admit that the scene is a bit dragged out, but I have no problem with it.</br></br>  <br>If the anime keeps its rythm, we should get camping next episode,  then after that they'll start dropping heavy hints about Megu-nee </br>  <br>The sheer amount of different hints is actually kind of impressive.<br><br>It's also kind of hilarious though how many of them can be dismissed as "because it's moe anime"</br></br></br>   why didn't xyz <br>It's fucking zombies. You will always have to suspend your disbelief because they were never a good concept to start with.</br>  <br>But we've seen that zombies are pretty lethargic from the get go. See when Megu-nee watches that video on her phone the undead folk are moving pretty slowly.<br><br>It is beyond me how they got rekt like that. A fucking Ayaya runs around with a shovel killing zombies, surely police or jsdf could do something about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Only "virus infected" zombies aren't a good concept. The really real undead ones are.</br>  Just read a bit of the manga<br> Holy fuck, the dog was fake too? </br>  <br>He's alive in the anime. For now.</br>  <br>No, it's real.</br>  <br>But the dog is  dead  no?</br>  <br>It's dead in the manga but not in the anime. We'll see how it goes.</br>  <br>We got camping this episode, though. Next episode will be about Kei apparently</br>  <br>Nope, he's in a flashback right after Lesbian joins the school-life club.<br> He's already bitten when they find him, so he doesn't stick around long. Megu-nee uses him to study the transformation. <br>He'll probably go down the same road.<br><br>It's hardly a spoiler since such is the fate of dogs in anything zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>School Slice of Life nowadays stands for Taking the Lives of Schoolgirls One Slice at a Time. Those tags make me prepare for the worst.</br>  <br>Really? Most dogs I've seen just fucks off off screen once shit hits the fan, and conveniently have zombies ignore animals.<br><br> At the same time I can't even remember the names of those movies, so they had to have been terrible. </br></br></br>  Why is Kurumi being scared so damn boner inducing?  <br>Perhaps they just think there's something wrong and get too close trying to help before its too late.</br>  <br>Senpai please.</br>  <br>RAAAAAAAAAAAAPE</br>  If zombies end up going where they remember/count as important, wouldn't a secret hideout be ideal?  <br>She's boner inducing either way.</br>  <br>I, for one, am happy that good fanart of her finally arrives.</br>  <br>I love this face.<br><br>The face of absolute  confusion .</br></br></br>  <br>You know, speaking of the outbreak this episode, just how long is the incubation period supposed to be? People were turning right away here, but Kurumi held out all night until Miki got back.</br>  <br>Seems to be different for different people.</br>  <br>Sensei and that one guy at the mall held out pretty long, maybe it happens based on how much blood they lost?</br>  Shovel is the best action hero.  Why is Yuki so shit? She ruined the whole episode.  Enough with the fucking GG generals  <br>Well, Megu-nee was surrounded by zombies and likely bitten more than once, same with most other people during the inital outbreak, at least I assume, considering how nobody knew what was really going on.</br>  <br>might be different for each person<br>nastier wounds might accelerate the process<br> People were turning right away here <br>you don't know about that</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The more cute you are the more time it takes.</br></br>  <br>So Kurumi is immune after all?</br>  <br>This is my favorite so far.<br><br><br>Quiet, Yuki is a good girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi's senpai turned within minutes.</br>  <br>I want to rape Kurumi!<br><br>And I want to be raped by her.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you take in the time it takes to get in the building and climb all the way up the stairs?</br>  So, do we know yet if Shovel has become Alice from Resident Evil?  <br>If you stick your dick into a zombie, will you become a zombie as well?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  So after reading the manga.  It's pretty clear that Kurumi's going to die. The only questions are when and where.   Too bad about the censor.  <br><br>Yeah, the guy in the mall lasted maybe half a day between the initial bite and then turning in his sleep.</br></br>  <br> Sudoku in order to prevent the others from having to kill her. </br>  <br>What about watching her get raped?<br><br>http://nijie.info/view.php?id=98357<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Then why didn't she turn immediately?</br>  <br>Not entirely. She gets the Dreaded Japanese Cold instead of turning.</br>  <br>Obviously because you have shit taste.</br>  <br>I'm never going to understand people who think that all currently unresolved problems in a story will just continue indefinitely and never be solved.</br>  <br>It's using typical zombie tropes and ignoring biology. The infection takes about 12 hours to kill you and bring you back as a zed, but if you die during the incubation period for any reason you also immediately come back as a zombie.</br>  <br>Careful not cutting yourself with all this edge</br>  <br>Future Dead Characters.jpg</br>  <br>Senpai didn't die.</br>  <br>Why do zeds want to kill people anyway?</br>  <br>So all she needs now is some chicken soup and good night's rest?</br>  How are the Gurashis ranked in terms of popularity?  <br>Especially since it's not uncommon in a story like this that the person in the clearly most vulnerable position will actually come out fine.</br>  <br>It wasn't actually that long, Lesbian went down there as soon as she came back and didn't take very long.<br> The night was tensed because we didn't know if it worked. <br>Being apparently virus based, it's bound by physiology.<br>If it's a small wound that's immediately treated, it'll take a while to kick in, whereas it'll act much faster one someone with multiple or deep bites. Or dead with no immune system to fight.<br><br>On that note, it seems there is a period after the virus takes over where they are still alive and can recover or do stuff through sheer will,  like when Megu-nee went down to the basement. <br>It's also possibly the period where they are the most agile and dangerous.<br><br>Guys remember anime watchers are lurking so spoiler your shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he did. He died of his wounds and immediately turned. Or do you expect me to believe that the infection killed him in less than 20 mins?</br>  <br> I'm hungry but <br> I'M HUNGRY BUT </br></br>  <br>In Japan?<br>Yuki &gt;&gt; Kurumi &gt;&gt; Miki &gt; Rii &gt; Megu-nee</br></br>  <br>Given that's what the scene showed, yes.</br>  <br>Japan shit taste confirmed yet again</br>  <br>Source?<br>Didn't think so</br></br>  <br>Fucking hyped for this scene <br><br> I LOVE YOU. WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR? </br></br></br>  <br>The virus wants to spread.</br>  <br> Not using Slice off Life <br> missed opportunity </br></br>  <br>So many zombie rape doujins</br>  <br>Then why don't you find your own sources, asshole? I guarantee you'll get the same results. But of course you won't you lazy fuck.</br>  <br>He was unresponsive until he turned so he was probably dead.</br>  <br>I dun fucked up. Sorry.</br>  <br>Fanart is overwhelmingly of Yuki and Kurumi</br>  <br>my god thats worse than the zombie virus</br>    <br>There didn't seem to be too much blood loss, unless he stained half the school red while they were getting to the roof.</br>   playing video games in the middle of a zombie apocalypse <br><br>Living the dream</br></br>  <br>Where the scans at?</br>  <br>Have the uni girls eaten and/or raped them yet?</br>  Why is Mii-kun there from the start?  <br>Now this is what I've been waiting for.</br>   mfw reading about megu nee <br> mfw how kind she is <br> mfw all the predicament <br><br>i need a vodka</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only at fighting games, it seems.</br>   I should have expected a incompetent helicopter pilot, these fucks ALWAYS have to appear in anything zombie related.   <br>I dont know, i'm just following a random nip's twitter account. He usually uploads pics that we'll never see scanned.<br><br>Pic related</br></br></br>  <br>when are they gonna start killing humans</br>  <br> remote strapped to controller <br>She a badass progamer</br></br>  <br> Actually he did the right thing given his situation. </br>  <br>   I should have expected an infected helicopter pilot <br><br>There you go</br></br></br>  can someone tell me wtf that helicopter pilot was doing.  <br>Them getting all friendly with the uni girls isn't a good sign. Something's going to go down soon enough for them with those uni girls.</br>  <br>That's a default control scheme for Splatoon.</br>  <br>Someone post that picture explaining the helicopter part for blind people</br>  I'd share my hard tack with them.  <br>The implication was that he was infected and that the infection requires regular injections to keep controlled instead of just being cured with one shot</br>  <br>Crashing, evidently.</br>  <br> He lost/was losing control of his body due to the virus. </br>  <br>That Mi-kun though<br> why are all my senpais such bakas </br></br>  <br><br> He's still incompetent because he should've stayed his ass on land if he was infected. </br></br>    <br>Crashing the helicopter with no survivors.</br>  <br> With no survivors. </br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Good enough for me.<br>pls share</br></br>  <br>I bet that's exactly what the author want's you to think while nothing ever happens and they keep doing SoL antics with the occasional shit going down.</br>  <br>Someone get this cathead out of here</br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br> Maybe Randall CO. was sending infected pilots out to prevent healthy pilots from getting infected, maybe he was the only pilot available and they had no choice, maybe he was trying to keep the fact he was infected secret and had to keep doing his job in the meantime <br><br>There's a ton of possible explainations if you think just a little bit</br></br></br>  <br>Does it show any indication of what they're actually playing? It'd be amazing if they were actually playing Splatoon.</br>  I don't mind fanservice at all, but that was just ridiculous. Why didn't she show up straight in her pantsu.  <br>You're a squid<br>Now you're a dead</br></br>  <br>They're called bloomers</br>  <br>Your first two explanations just end up marking multiple people as such. <br><br>And your last explanation just makes him seem even more retarded assuming he has a clear understanding as to what's going on.</br></br></br>  <br>That'd be nice, but for how long do you think they could stay at uni then? They did stay at the school for a good while, but they had to eventually move out. The uni girls and the guys, who were chasing them before, could be a good enough reason to progress the plot further and make them quickly "graduate" uni.</br>  <br>If you're fine for 2 weeks until you need another dose of serum, there's not really that much of a risk sending infected people out. There was only a problem because he relapsed then and there.</br>  <br>Aren't those bloomers<br><br><br>We don't know how the "cure" works.<br>If Shovel's foreshadowing is to be believed, we might be dealing with a Zombrex situation.<br>In that case, the pilot could have run out of doses and tried to get back home or not realize he was at his limit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>worst*</br>  <br>The mangaka does play splatoon so it could be a direct reference</br>  <br>Words of wisdom.</br>  <br>The uni girls have been introduced pretty ominously, shit is going to go down one way or the other.<br>They may be cannon fodder so we can have our quota of death without hurting the core roster, or they could be planning something sinister like using the girls.</br></br>  <br> I love you why why wont you open the door <br> No this isnt what i should be doing im hungry but.. <br><br> I wonder if i'll ever see them again. <br><br>im not ready for the anime to reach this scene....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What dastardly things is she planning now</br>  <br><br><br>We aren't in the 80s, nobody would wear such short panties nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>How dare they rank Rii in anything but last place.</br>  <br>They're going to formally introduce the concept of half-zombies.</br>  <br>Why is there such a distance between Yuki/Kurumi and Miki?</br>  <br>And yet 90% of anime still have them.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Y'know, because it's an university here, there are various kinds of guys here." </br>  <br>I still dont understand why there's no copilot.<br><br>plothole?</br></br></br>  <br>Or further evidence that they're severely low on manpower.</br>  <br>Kurumi and especially Yuki were the poster girls for the anime. They had people cosplaying the two girls at events and whatnot. They've also had the most screentime and development in the anime, and in my opinion, are the most interesting characters both personality and design-wise. But yeah, Kurumi has double the amount of fanart as Miki does on Pixiv.</br>  <br>He just wanted the naked lolis all to himself.</br>  reading the manga was a mistake<br>now im depresed<br>i just want cute girls doing cute things with megu nee ;_;</br></br>  which girl is gonna score the first non zombie kill  <br> Megu-nee already did. </br>  <br>i just wish there were more chapters out</br>  <br>I was gonna say Kurumi but maybe Rii is going to do it and it'll take her over the edge from broken to shattered.</br>    <br>wouldnt mind if Yuki is first to cap a motherfucker</br>  <br> Sweat drop on his helmet </br>  Imagine if pilot-kun was fapping when that unfortunate relapse happened  <br>"What the hell did I just fap to?"</br>  <br>Holy shit it all makes sense now. The chopper went out of control because he was fapping to the thought of a naked lli paradise.</br>    <br> wouldnt mind <br>I want this to happen.</br></br>  <br> Sees clothed high school girls instead of the naked loli paradise he was promised <br> Gets so mad he crushes the message, his medicine and crashes his helicopter in a kamikaze move </br></br>  <br><br>Any girl is likely to kill someone at this point.</br></br>  <br>Turns out she picked up the gun Miki threw away and has been keeping it ever since</br>  <br>picked up the gun that mi-kun threw away<br>caps those no good delinquents</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how it would turn out now that she's not delusional. Would she break down like the time with the zombie? Maybe she can keep her feelings at bay until they get to safety before it dawns on her what she really did. And maybe she'll completely break and revert to an extreme delusional state where she smiles and waves at her friends in the club while still covered in his fresh warm blood.</br></br>  <br>We were wrong the whole time. Someone should edit that image for blind people to reflect this new profound knowledge.</br>  P O S T <br>P T H E<br>O T R A W S<br>S H A<br>T E W <br> S</br></br></br></br></br>  Kurumi please my boner  <br><br>helmet dudes kills one of the crew. Yuki becomes full edge and start maniacally laughing as she executes them</br></br>  <br>I want her to bite me with that fang.</br>  <br>After the rooftop scene establishing it as unacceptable, I doubt any of the main cast will.</br>  <br> Post pthe otraws sha tew s <br>Poor Anon has run out of serum ;_;7</br></br>  <br>they talkin bout the manga dude its obviously gonna happen soon</br>  I actually like her character but I wish she would wake up and smell the cheese already, It would be better seeing her cope with what's actually going on instead of this rainbow land she's placed herself in.  <br>She has short moments of clarity and PTSD fits, be patient.<br>They are becoming more and more frequent</br></br>    <br>I'm pretty clearly also talking about the manga given that the scene with the gun is months away in the anime, and also stop writing like a retard.</br>  <br>And all that goes out the window when one of your best friends is about to be killed.</br>  <br>That was probably just one of her bullies</br>  <br>Oi, lelouch, Fuck off</br>  <br>Fuck I can't believe I just noticed her hat fell off when she snapped out of it.</br>  <br>There are different strains of the virus. I'm guessing the outbreak at school was an airborne strain since people turned way to quickly and shut went down with minutes. People immune to the airborne virus then got turn through bites which have a different incubation period. Though if Senpai was bitten, then I'll accept that it could be different for different people.</br>  <br>does her hat always fall off when she flips her shit?</br>  <br/>  <br>Yuuri is best girl.</br>    <br>Her fucking hat is the source of delusions.</br>  <br>Someone is going to draw Rii's hair getting fucked one day.</br>    <br>I don't think I could bear to see that</br>  <br>The one time she was wearing it was in a dream.</br>  <br>I must be delusional from sleepiness because I laughed at this stupid thing for 15 seconds straight.</br>  <br>Yes please, hair fetish is a great thing.</br>  <br>tis but a ruse</br>  <br>Not enough hair fetish doujins have hair brushing scenes</br>  <br>looks like shes a mad hatter.

Given the current pace of 12 chapters a year, we'd have enough material in less than two years.</br>  <br>Man I remember the threads back then<br> NO YUKI YOU DUMB SLUT </br></br>    <br>Are those really their eyes or is it a bullshit purikura filter</br>  <br> makeup </br>  It's disturbing to see how Kurumi loves her "Senpai".<br><br>She shall never have such attachment for me who is a disgusting nerd, and far from jocks like "Senpai".<br>Actually, nobody on the earth will love me like that, being lovesick and talking about that with her sensei.<br>I can never be a "Senpai", who is loved by a cute kouhai like Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just buy a shovel and keep it in your bed.<br><br>Your imagination is all you need.</br></br></br>    <br>Make yourself the jock she'd want you to be, poor nerd.

I'm going to make her an Olympic medalist.</br>  <br>SHOVEL JUSTICE.</br>  <br>I don't think she would be interested in that.</br>    <br>What do you mean? It's the most effective way for her to stay in shape. Plus the extra flexibility will give her better handling of the shovel.</br>  <br>It'd be useless since she's gonna go  rigid  soon.</br>  Reminder Megu let all her students be eaten right behind the door.  <br>Well that explains why only 4 people survived.</br>  <br>I bet Megu was the one who bit Senpai and turned him into a zombie too.<br><br>i'm glad she's dead.</br></br></br>  <br>She did the right thing. I still wonder who the other girl was though.</br>  <br> right thing <br>Depends, if they were all running there cornered then I say she didn't do the best choice, if they had zombies mixed in then maybe it was.</br></br>  <br> I'm just pretending to have PTSD </br>  <br> Left to Right </br>  <br>Chances are at least one of them were infected. So it's either save three girls now or be responsible for the death of a dozen people later.</br>  <br>There's a movie that has a scene like that. I think it's called contracted</br>  <br>Otaku are dumb. They don't want to be the little girl, they want to fuck the little girl.</br>  <br>As long as she isn't  frigid .</br>    <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The students were pobably getting assaulted by the zombies, opening the door may have let infected people or zombies get on the roof, leaving the Gurashis trapped.<br>Megu-nee did what she could, and that's saving those three girls and herself. If the principal wasn't a fucking selfish, incompetent idiot, then he would have started evacuating the teachers and pupils to the shelter and everything would have been fine.<br>Scratch that, even the fucking shelter was only designed for 15 people. They were all fucked from the start, Megu-nee did nothing wrong.</br></br></br>    <br>Shelter was obviously just for the staff but the principle was a pussy and went there alone it seemed. Then hung himself out of guilt.</br>  <br>Where is she putting that shovel?</br>  <br>You know these threads isn't have bad if you imagine that these OPs have autism.</br>  <br>Not you again. Are you so sad that there are not Shirobako threads at the moment?</br>  What if Yuki was a zambooble the whole time?    I think I'll pick this up, seems kind of Higurashi-like.  <br> Ruu is the only one who's real </br>  <br>It wasn't the whole time. She got bitten when she accidentally went home.<br><br>She ate all her friends because she loved them so much.</br></br></br>  <br>It really isn't, aside from the contrast cute things / horror which is hardly rare<br>You still should</br></br>  <br>They can't all be imaginary.</br>  <br>I can't look her the same since she didn't brush her teeth in the first ep. I'm convinced that I can smell her.</br>  <br>They might become "imaginary" eventually in anime-original end.</br>  <br>I knew this zombie apocalypse slice of life was missing something!</br>    <br>You forgot that the gate is already broken down.<br>Wonder what the reason for them going to the mall was in the anime? I mean, the school store still has supplies.</br></br>  <br>Rii's voice in that moment was so perfect.</br>  Post more dog.  So how the fuck do some dumb slow-ass corpses cause an apocalypse?  <br>The same way they do in every apocalypse. Somehow.</br>  <br> the school store still has supplies <br><br>Don't they only eat udon and hardtacks because they run out of everything else?</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder about that too. Also, will Megu-nee go with them? <br><br>If she doesn't, how will they cover her not driving the car without revealing she's already dead?</br></br></br>  <br>Panic, lack of medical preparation, hiding bites, and people usually grouping together in enclosed areas.</br>  <br>1) they aren't always slow<br>2) surprise effect<br>3) high density of population in japan<br>4) zombies following their pre-death travelling patterns, rather than staying in one place</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the zombies that cause it, it's the humans that react to them. They see some dead fucker in the street and panic the fuck out until they crash into a gas station. You also have the paranoid fucks that think some people are infected when they really aren't. Also, the government quarantines and cleansings will often target protagonists, so that's bad too. Overreactive government leaders are tempted to nuke the shit out of a country as well, only to find out that the disease has spread throughout the world.</br>  <br>Zombie only has to scratch you to win. You have to bash it's head in to win. <br><br>The difference in effort required gives them the edge.</br></br></br>    Can't wait til some sort of anti-hero appears and fucks the shit out of Kurumi in the most terrible way.  <br>What Raws? Arent we up to date?</br>  <br> wii u in the zombie apocalypse <br>Subtle.</br></br>  <br>New chapter today (or yesterday, whenever)</br>  Place your bets:<br>Is Mika evil?<br>I say no.</br></br>  <br>Brilliance at work.</br>  <br>That's why you run from the motherfucker and let the guys with the guns get him.</br>  <br>What if Owari no Seraph is happening in the same world as Gakkou Gurashi?</br>  Is this Kurumi's favorite video game?  <br>Which one's Mika?</br>  <br> not knowing Idolmaster <br>Out, scrub.</br></br>    <br>I'm talking about the uni girl.</br>  <br>This makes me wonder, would any of them play Rebuild given the chance?</br>  <br>The military would need time to actually deploy all over the country and take the necessary mesures, enough times for zombies to turn a few malls and train stations into undead nests.<br>That said, it's like mecha. A successful zombie apocalypse is extremely unrealistic even if you have zombies that can run, the virus would need to be extremely volatile for it to work (wich is how Gakko Gurashi's virus works actually, the virus was extremely volatile then mutated to become "bite only"). It's a genre that relies heavily on suspension of disbelief and rule of cool.</br></br>  <br>Which uni girl?</br>  Can a mangafag confirm a suspicion I'm having?  Megu-nee is dead, isn't she?   <br>No, she isn't.<br> I'M SO HUNGRY SO WHY WON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR </br></br>  <br>No.<br> ...maybe. </br></br>  <br>Last cut of the episode show where she is  as a zombie .</br>  <br>He's a /k/ guy.</br>  <br><br> fgsfds </br></br>  <br>How can you not tell which one I mean when I call her Mika?<br>You DO know who Mika is, right?</br></br>  <br><br>What are you talking about?<br>In the manga she's perfectly fine  being a zombie </br></br></br>  <br> Zombies can write? </br>  WAKE UP MEGU-NEE  Maybe I am late but I think this makes the idea of an airborne disease the only possible one. Track-and-field run a lot, sweat a lot, and breathe a lot, I exclude water transmitted because she would have noticed that.<br>She didn't get the zombie virus because she wasn't running and doing cardio increases her lung capacity and efficiency. Maybe it's all bullshit though.</br>    <br>I am looking forward to that day.</br>  <br>I don't. I even went back and reread chapter 37. No one calls anyone Mika. We haven't gotten their names yet.</br>  <br> Nope, that's actually a mistake of the anime. She was only writing in the staff room, they found her diary with the secret manual.<br>She turned just before getting to the shelter, and her will was transmitted to her zombie self, wich kept on going and is now roaming inside.</br> </br>  <br>Anon, The track team were infected first, because they have club activities next to the entrance, where zombies can wander in. <br>Nothing airborne about it.</br></br>  <br>It's a nickname, you tard.</br>  <br>Yes.<br><br> Or perhaps... </br></br></br>  <br>Track team should easily outrun a zombie, so I don't think that's the reason. Plus she didn't see the cause, just the results.</br>  <br>I thought that might be the case, so I went to look in the archives, but they're down right now.</br>  Do I go with DDS or Vivid?  <br>Why would anyone run away from an injured, staggering, fellow club member? This isn't America where you can get sued for administering first aid.<br>The same reason Shovel dragged her senpai to the roof, people don't run away from someone in distress, they try to help.</br></br>  <br> Track team <br>I guess their luck ran out</br></br>  <br>Nah man, the cuts to black and the muting while keeping the shovel scrapes was the best part of the episode.</br>    <br>Fuck you, Carlos</br>  <br> Why would anyone run away from an injured, staggering, fellow club member <br>Because they are trying to eat me alive.</br></br>  <br>It becomes the touching story of a group of children helping out a autistic child survive the zombie apocalypse.</br>   all these people who haven't read the manga and don't know that Yuki is the most sanest one  <br><br>Is there anyway for all secondaries to kill themselves?</br></br>    IMO I like how Megu-nee and the dog are alive in this version as vs the manga, makes it so us mangalords have something new to look forward to  <br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/134661<br>Vivid has the meme-master fnord doing "translation". Basically avoid that unless you love commie-style meme-subs.<br>Get HS or DDY.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Ignore them. They're just zombieposters.</br>  <br>In all Gakkou Gurashi threads in the past 7 days, the word "Mika" turns up only once, and the way they talked about a "punished Mika" I'm pretty sure they misspelled Miki.</br>  <br>Did they come at you with a knife and fork? Perhaps it was a pair of chopsticks?<br>How can you tell what they wanted when they can barely grunt?</br></br>  <br>The dog is dead?!</br>  <br>You're literally retarded and incapable of understanding a simple reference. Do you really not know about Idolmaster? At all?<br>The Uni girl looks like Mika from Cinderella Girls.<br>That's the joke, you fucking normalfaggot zombietard.</br></br></br>  <br>Um, anon...  I think Megu-nee's just as dead in this version as in the original. </br>  <br>In the manga Yuki finds him and they realize that he's been bit so Megu-Nee has to kill him but she can't so she just let's it run away, but then it comes back as a zombie</br>  <br>The dog looks fine to me.</br>  <br><br>Gotcha thanks.</br></br>  <br>Ah, see I don't play Idolmaster, so I didn't know about it. So you're talking about the one in the middle in that case.</br>  <br>Idolm@ster is shit, and idolfags are the worst type of cancer in the whole industry.

Also, the range of chapters that they publish can and often does include chapters that the artist originally published with other magazines.
