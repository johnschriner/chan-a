This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

I ignored this thread for a bit because shitposting.</br></br>  <br>Names in the credits were for the $300 tier backers. Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting. This is hilarious.</br>  <br>Yeah. It was a backer listed in the credits.</br>  <br>BASED<br><br>10/10</br></br></br>  <br> We Gurren Lagann now <br><br>I'm okay with this</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't realize she had long hair.

I hope LWA3 makes them canon.  <br>When they make another Kickstarter.<br><br>Would you guys back it all over again? I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception. It actually stands for God.<br><br>Source: I'm a gangster.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't ship them, but I do like seeing them being friendly.<br><br>LWA2 gave me just enough of that to prevent a riot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko x Sucy &gt; Akko x Diana<br>Look into your heart, you know it to be true</br></br>  <br>Not like I've got a better way to spend a hundred bucks right now. (cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

Waited so long that I had pretty much forgot about it.</br></br></br>   Sticky <br><br>More Amanda now please</br></br>  HORRIBLESUBS SAVING THE DAY   not saving it for halloween   <br> Also I didn't even know the second ep had come out. <br>there were threads about it for weeks how did you not notice?</br></br>  I honesty thought the fat girl was going to go apeshit when people steal her snacks.  <br><br>Neat. At least that solves the font issue.</br></br>  <br>It makes me happy that this faggot typed all this inane bullshit out and didn't even get a reply. Hope he killed himself.</br>    WE STICKY NOW  Which tiers are the various witches in?  <br>Can't wait for the fanart of catsuit Amanda.</br>  Can we all agree that this was as delightful, if not even more, than the original?<br><br>Can we put the cynicism aside for this one?</br></br>  HORRIBLESUBS!!!  <br>Perfection</br>  <br>I love how they didn't make the characters stereotypical in all respects. A sharing fat girl who is cute, the cocky tomboyish girl who isn't a bitch, and the short helpful mechanic.</br>  <br> I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb <br>thats kind of the point for her</br></br>  <br> Two left feet </br>  <br>All S tier<br>Fat-chan is in A tier.</br></br>  <br>YABBA DABBA DOO</br>  <br>Gurl's thicker than a bowl of oatmeal.</br>   Donated but didn't see my name in credits <br> Scanned through multiple times just to make sure I didn't miss it <br><br>Oh....o-okay.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127565290   <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127566678 <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar.

Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris). The orchestral score was performed by the Russian State Symphony Cinema Orchestra. Pretty neat.   Vimeo <br> an hour long <br> only 550mb  <br><br>Fuck this, I'll torrent it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything with 5 a's?</br>  <br>Torrent is a rip from vimeo, though.</br>  <br><br>Even 24min could if they throw money at it.<br><br>Look at Wizard Barristers; I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. But that first episode was money. Everything else sucked, but if you pretend like everything else doesn't exist, it's not a bad anime.<br><br> just keep throwing money at something and you get this: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=avf<wbr>28NLksxE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   01 <br> A Hour long <br><br>So onward we getting the usual 20 mins now</br></br></br>  Anyone planning on buying the BD when it comes out?   thumb-sucking like a baby <br>Just make a full TV series already.</br>  <br>Okay.<br><br>Got a spare 1.5 million US dollars lying around?</br></br></br>  /av/ please<br>make it real</br>  <br>THANK YOU! It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure.

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/?

He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different.

You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it.

It's easy to spot stuff that's ripping off 90s Glen Keane-core Disney (John K calls it "Cal Arts style") and LWA is not even fucking close.<br><br>It's not like they even attempted and failed, the two styles are worlds apart.</br></br></br></br>  <br> LWA The Chalice of Flames <br>Akko is mistakenly entered into an inter-school witches tournament and must battle other witches to the death.</br></br>  <br>that fucking kamina smile</br>  <br>Busterbeam stop.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about? LWA2 had an upskirt butt shot with NO panies. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;7570485 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just puffy clothes.</br>  <br>Did you forget about me?</br>  claimed  <br>Brad Bird will save western hand-drawn animation, I hope.</br>  I never watched the first one and I think KLK is mediocre.<br><br>Should I try it just for the lolis?</br></br>  <br> and "furry" is not a sexual orientation. </br>  <br>Westaboos<br><br><br>Probably</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can watch cute girls do cute things for hours. Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it.

When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy.

You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing.

Let me guess, you're one of the backers left in denial.<br><br>So you payed these retards 800 grand for a generic 30 minute sci-fi OVA, it's been a year with nothing but updates that say absolutely nothing but "w-we're working on it seriously guys!!", and not only that, one year after it's been funded the studios have split and half the staff replaced, so who knows where the fuck that money is or when that shitty OVA is coming. The production went to shit and you got played like a violin, congratulations.</br></br></br>  Absolutely inspired direction, every scene just flows so well and is so visually engrossing  <br>that's a shaft show, isn't it?</br>  <br>This<br>Who was the director? This whole thing was just incredibly well done.</br></br>  <br>Her character could have been replaced with a boulder, but she was cute, at least.</br>  <br><br>it was good. but also kinda clichee-laden. I wouldn't call it inspired. Just good execution of old recipes.</br></br>  <br>How the fuck did that shit raise 800 grand? At least with LWA2, people already liked LWA and saw that there was a competent staff behind it.</br>  It was kinda meh. Oh well, considering the budget they did alright.  <br>LWA is You Yoshinari's pet project, though obviously lots of people are responsible for the final result.</br>  <br>Mostly Hideo Kojima shilling for them (he was my boy before but he ain't my boy no more) and also they pandered to MAL and reddit fucking hard. They unironically spread the #keepanimealive hashtag.</br>  <br>you can take the most tired cliches ever and make them interesting/fun if you're talented enough, which this guy clearly is</br>  <br>Because they advertised it with some stupid "SAVE ANIME" shit, and all the people that don't watch anime ate it up.</br>  <br> You Yoshinari <br>Well that certainly explains it.</br></br>  Has this not been posted yet?  Had better animation than literally everything I've watched all year.  <br>Calm the fuck down, Diana.</br>  <br>The fuck does Kojima know about making anime? Fucking casuals.</br>  <br>there was a pony in LWA1 too. Although it was maggot-infested.</br>  <br>Just remember that we always have an Inferno Cop x LWA anime to look forward to.</br>  It was okay I guess.  fat-chan stole one of akko's hair  HAPPY TIME KEIKAKU  i want to sniff little witch butt.<br><br>and fuck whoever already posted the two pics i wanted to post.</br></br>  <br>heh pony</br>  <br>I'm not a even a backer. you sound more like a backer than I</br>  <br> people actually seeding </br>  <br>Remember back when people could put ponies in the rooms of little girls to show that they were into stereotypical little girl things?</br>  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clito<wbr>cybe_nuda</wbr></br></br>  <br>Under the Dog was taking advantage of the whole "Anime is trash and cookie cutter" angle and some people went "Muh mature storytelling" and gave it dosh, but it was originally not going to make it's funding goal, but then a bunch of youtubers and bloggers decided to cram the kickstarter down our throats, and then a bunch of sheep donated to make the goal.</br>  <br>And what is she gonna do with it?</br>  <br> depending on a flaky connection for streamin <br>My stream was 10/10 with no interrupts or buffering.</br></br>  <br>Pls respond</br>  <br>Butt sniffing is easily my favorite fetish.

They would have that unmistakable sweaty, musky butt smell; but each rear would have its own unique characteristic that makes them all worth sniffing.</br>  <br>That's because they already have Precure (for the bigfriends) and Kamen Rider (for lonely housewives).

The animation for LWA2 isn't going to break and there is no gameplay or any user input involved. We're just viewers that know the general art direction.

But yeah, she did nothing. </br>  <br>she handed out candy. And if they ever do LWA3 hope to see her doin something really important</br>  <br>But she threw candy to make the parade bystanders happy!</br>  <br>Ursula is actually the little sister of Diana's mom and a "disgrace to the family. The Cavendish family is the most reputable family in the old guard of witches but they have a very "witches-are-superior-to-muggles" ideology and believe witches should be feared. Ursula disagreed and ran away from home. Diana really loved her aunt and went to every event. The guy with Diana in the intro scene of LWA is her butler. One day Shiny Chariot's show stopped without warning because something happened that killed the Shiny Rod's power. The third movie will be parent's visit day and it will deal with this backstory.</br>  <br>i want to believe!</br>  <br>A common mexican name.</br>  If I'm a backer, where can I watch this without torrenting?<br><br>Haven't gotten any emails nor am I seeing anything on the Kickstarter site.</br></br>  <br>ok premise if they had a tv show</br>  Holy shit Akko almost made this unbearable to watch.

When you watch the first episode it becomes clear that the dresses are not designed that way.</br>  <br>It's not. You can actually see her bare butt in the episode if you happen to pause it at just the right moment.</br>  <br>Exactly when?</br>  <br>Sensory overload. <br>The wand represents my penis.</br></br>  I just naturally assumed that their school uniforms have some sort of censorship enchantment on them to prevent upskirts and panty shots  <br>A Little Witch Academia without "The Void" it's simply not Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>33:55<br><br>It's near the start of the parade, when Akko is dancing with the brooms.</br></br></br>  <br>That image is fanart.</br>      <br>Literally everyone leaves to go jerk off to Akko's ass. <br><br>Wasn't it from the trigger art book?</br></br></br>  Will Akko ever find out Ursula-sensei is her beloved Shiny Chariot?  Will they have sex?   <br>Akko is a lewd girl that likes to flaunt her booty around.</br>  <br>I bet the third movie will be about Shiny Chariot's backstory and Akko and Diana will finally see eye-to-eye in something.</br>  does anyone have a pic of the scene where Amanda does the broom dance and you can can briefly see her ass? Also, I hope this is popular enough to get made into a series    Was there color turn arounds for all the characters?<br>I need references badly.</br>  Is it me or is Diana kinda obsessed with Akko?  <br>if you look carefully, it becomes obvious that she is wearing panties</br>  <br>its you</br>  <br>Excuse the quality face.</br>  We need a TV series of this so we have more material to scour for loli witch asses.  Is Diana still voiced by the girl who voices Rias Gremory?  Best fucking $110 I ever spent. Thank you based Trigger.  Oh God, I'm super-duper excited and really want to watch it right now, but I'm dead tired.  So this isn't the BDs?    <br>is you</br>  if they are not going to do another kickstarter will they at least sell merch so I can throw money at them that way?  <br>ESPURR!<br>She reminds me of an Espurr. God, it's been bugging me since I watched it.</br></br>    <br>never ceases to amuse me</br>  <br>Yes, Yoko Hikasa.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would really love some LWA merch. I already bought the LWA1 BD off of Trigger's store, but it's not enough.</br>      Nendroid Petite LWA pack with Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Amanda, Constanze and secret Yasumineka.  <br>BEST</br>    <br>I want it!</br>      <br>Thanks nigga.</br>  <br>I want it. I want GSC to make some LWA nendos.</br>      Akko was kind of bitchy in part 2 but it's okay to have a bad day sometimes. <br>I still love you, girl.</br>    <br> that iMac on the left </br>  <br>That does make sense, as much as I don't like petites.<br><br>Gimme a Sucy scale with mushroom base.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't that bad. She got a little grating when she was being selfish about the whole parade, but she's a teenage girl and she's passionate. It happens.</br>  i want to have a ride on sensei's shiny chariot  <br>I still think they could have toned her down a bit</br>  <br>This. In the first half, it seemed almost out of character (compared to the first installment).</br>  The last moments of the episode just screamed Ooshima Michiru's work, so I wasn't surprised when I saw her name on the credits. Based Michiru, making the best soundtracks ever since SnW.   tfw I almost backed the kickstarter but an anon convinced me not to, because the business model was bad for the animation industry or something <br><br>Why was I so stupid</br></br>  <br>the one that did that folk music?</br>  <br>I wasn't able to back it because I had no money at the time. I would have gladly thrown dosh at the kickstarter for all the cool stuff if I had been able to.<br><br>Guess I'll just wait for the BD to be put up for sale.</br></br></br>  <br>Why was it stupid?<br>You got it for free.</br></br>  <br> folk music <br>What? All I know from Ooshima are these big orchestral stuff like you hear in Sora no Woto or LWA.</br></br>  <br>so what percentage of that outfit is life fibers</br>  The cutest witch.  I'm watching Enchanted parade right now. This stuff is Studio Ghibli tier in terms of story telling and near studio Ghibli tier in terms of animation.  <br>I want her to teach me how to dance.</br>  <br>So it's a convoluted mess that looks pretty?</br>  So, if they do a Kickstarter for Little Witch Academia 3, would you donate?<br><br>Assuming similar stretch goals and reward tiers, how much would you donate next time compared to what you donated this time?</br></br>  <br>She did apologize.</br>  <br>I would donate about $50</br>  <br>that fucking gif</br>  <br>I wouldn't go so far in terms of story telling, but I love the art style and it's very refreshing. Characters are also very varied and powerful. I was pleasantly surprised with everything in general. Would donate again for sure.</br>  I want her to tie me down with magic while she   insults my dick and then proceeds to rape me   Was it worth the money you put in?  <br>now that i have some money i will donate!!</br>  <br>Exceeded my expectations. <br>they should have focused on doing a series out of that instead of doing kill la kill imo. This has great potential to become a great series. A shame.</br></br>  I didn't know about this till today, the sticky made me curious and well, it was pretty good, even being that short the story and his little world envelops you, you really care for the characters even when you barely know them, I had a really good time. Is there going to be a full series about it? I would like to see that, all this have lots of potential for more.<br> Sucy best girl! </br>  <br><br><br>I was half reminded of Flash Dance with her routine and was expecting a bucket of water to be dumped on her at the end.</br></br></br>  <br>My nigro.<br>Sucy and Amanda, best girls by far.</br></br>  <br><br>My brothers!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br>I know that Luna means moon in latin, but what is Lana supposed to mean?

Do all artists have shit taste?</br>  <br>This is why trigger is one of my favorite.<br><br>They go off-model all of the time, and aren't afraid to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd donate at least $50.</br>  <br><br> That old ass witch going wands akimbo </br></br>  <br>Stuck up bitches are a turn-off for me personally. Speaking as an artist. </br>  <br>I have faith about they'll make a full serie of this.<br>It was said two or three days ago that Trigger anounced a new anime original, maybe it's LWA.<br>Even if they don't make it we'll still have the Inferno Cop X LWA.</br></br></br>  <br>Lana is wool in italian and spanish, but I doubt it has any relation to it.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127607030 <br> not wanting Sucy's upside-down isosceles triangle body </br>  <br>Same here bro. I didn't know about this series until today either and i was completely drawn in.</br>  <br>Probably enough to get my name in the credits.</br>  <br> Yoshinari will never do a spinoff for his favorite LWA, Diana <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>I'm surprised there were people that haven't seen this yet.</br>  <br>That would be the best news in years. It has enough elements to become a very rich series with lots of stories. It could become an improved version of Shitty Potter.</br>  <br>good post<br><br><br>i commend</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Mah niggas</br></br></br>  Trigger said that they're working on 3 original things; the next original TV series (some sort of serious-looking show that has Persona-like character designs) a shorter thing for USPTime and another original that is farther on. Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 but for now fixes and retakes for the BD and theatrical release.  My personal ranking:<br><br>Sucy = Amanda &gt; Diana &gt; Akko &gt; the rest</br></br>  <br>It was everything I wanted, but even better than I expected it. Well worth it. Looking forward to the BD and the tons of extras I get with it even more now.</br>  <br>Amanda stole my heart, but that's not particularly dangerous.</br>  <br>She would be part of the main story in a third sequel; this movie set-up the seeds for her and Akko finally teaming up.</br>    <br>I'd rather draw Sucy  or lotte </br>  WIPs.<br>http://i.imgur.com/A7q6j16.png<br>http://i.imgur.com/AjoNZv3.png<br><br>Maybe do more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yoshinari said he wants to do LWA3 <br>Really? I thought he wasn't too jazzed about LWA. IIRC he wanted to do a psychological drama thing.</br></br>  <br>He said it's still not the perfect LWA for him.</br>  <br> lewds of the LWAs <br>For what purpose</br></br>    <br>Doing God's work. Needs more Amanda and overall broom action.</br>  <br><br>Well, if LWA 3 is the Parent's Day it could have all the drama he'd want.</br></br>  <br> More Constance please. </br>  <br>Will /a/ save anime again with LWA3?</br>  <br>Funded in 3 hours or less this time.</br>  <br>Would be funny if the anime industry's western-like studios caught up with Kickstarter's possibilities by watching LWA and started competing for attention with great projects.

Trigger's track record isn't bad (KLK was a massive hit, Inou Battle was lukewarm, Ninja Slayer is a meme show on Niconico) but LWA is under most elevens' radar, so they'll have to depend on the West again if they decide to do more.</br></br>  <br>I think she  grew up .</br>  Anyone else like how Sucy is drawn without arms until she uses them for something  <br>Oh shit, you're right.</br>  <br>I really appreciate you namefagging, it's much easier to hit the button every time.<br><br><br>She matured.

The studio focused on other projects on the side.</br>  <br><br>It was way less because they were working on KLK and other animation projects for most of that time.</br></br>  <br>Not that kind of "quality"</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/BX1H948USbI?t=16  [ ]<br><br>there are also items that cause meteor showers, elemental explosions, cause floods, and in general cause natural-disaster levels of damage. atelier may be comfy but it knows when to step it up.</br></br></br>  <br>LWA is a love-letter kind of project that they can only afford to do to the side while the horridly panderish stuff like kill la kill and their other lesser products are done by word of mouth.<br><br>Watch the documentary for LWA1.<br>LWA is a project that they actually wanted to do and not one that they needed to do for the sake of having company-welfare. They had newbies work on it even.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Please, this god please.</br></br>  <br>You mean her one butler. Pause again.</br>  So /a/'s mods are Triggerfags?  Just finished watching the AotY. What a superb piece of work, and by TRIGGER no less...<br><br>I smiled, I almost cried, I was so engrossed in this OVA. <br><br>Stuff like this is why I watch anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>LWA is to Trigger as RSFWoH was to Gainax. <br><br>An all out in house production to showcase their technical abilities.</br></br></br>   know LWA3 won't be happening for at least another two years <br> already getting hype for it anyway <br>Fuck.</br></br>  <br>what's it referencing</br>  <br>KLK might have seemed panderish but knowing Imaishi it was definitely heartfelt. It wasn't intended to make lots of money and they had plenty of risks associated with it.</br>  <br> lwa sequel is out <br>well fuck</br></br>  <br>who did klk pander to ?</br>   project manager <br>Confirmed for anti-NEET anime</br>  <br>More like Daicon IV.<br>Honneamise was a theatrical movie. It was a flop of a movie, but it was still more of a commercial product than the showcase of raw talent that the Daicon shorts were.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck calls honneamaise as RSFWoH?</br>  <br>you wouldnt have given a shit about klk unless it had layers and layers of anime tiddy and all that pandering shit.<br><br>If they deployed the story in another handwriting that didnt involve some girl's ass or tits being on screen for 40% of any episode then you wouldnt have given a shit about it.</br></br></br>  <br>SJWs, normalfags, casuals, any buzzword that /a/ doesn't like this week.</br>  <br> Getting hype for show that wont come out for years. <br>It hurts just thinking about it.</br></br>  <br> GSC is the first logo we see <br> I hope you like figma </br></br>  <br>Newfags who think they need to abbreviate its full title.<br>Or NWTTNTAIFT.</br></br>  The music was too loud and too many scenes didn't have music at all. Felt kind of weird.  <br>Honestly, my opinion is that your style doesn't suite this show much at all. your anatomy is far too thick and muscly which is nothing like the film itself.</br>  <br>Royal space force sounds dumb<br>and i can't spell honeymayonnaise.</br></br>  <br>  Squid and shrimp on pizza <br>Why can't we get that at regular pizza places in the US?</br></br>  <br> too loud <br><br>Fuck meant "too low".</br></br></br>  <br>I liked KLK because it was a crazy, over-the-top parody of battle shonen with a vibrant cast of fun characters. I liked the anime breasts, but I liked them because they were comedic and made the experience even more ridiculous.</br>  Does anyone have the Inferno Cop/LWA crossover episode they showed?  KORE HA KUSO-ANIME DESU  <br>The sound itself was a little too loud.</br>  <br>Because it's disgusting.</br>  <br>Because there are many American faggots who would die if there's anything other than pepperoni on their Pizza. Hell, the best pizza I've ever had was in Normandy, had a ton of shit like potatoes and onions on it, but I haven't seen anywhere in America that would serve something like that. All we have here are the disgusting Chicago deep dish garbage.</br>  So as someone who didn't throw his shekels at the kickstarter, where can I get the blu rays of 1 and 2?  but where can i watch it  <br><br>I get a gut feeling that was whatever Imaishi wanted to do.</br></br>  <br>squid and shrimp are expensive</br>  <br>The annoying part is that even the non-chain pizza places in the US have pretty much the exact same menu as the chains. On the plus side, the chains are actually starting to branch out a bit. Pizza Hutt will put a balsamic vinegar reduction on your pizza now if you want and they even do white sauces.</br>  <br><br>Make her a mother bear-like character. Which she kind of already is.</br></br>  The whole thing was magical and I couldn't get the smile off my face the whole day. Worth every cent and I eagerly await more.  <br>The upside is that if you want to go out, you can find a decent wood fired place in pretty much any decent sized town, and they're likely to have decent specials on top of better options in general <br><br>So much of this acting like Murikka has shit food is just an ignorance of the options you have available</br></br></br>  <br> I eagerly await more <br>When asked about whether there would be a third LWA, the director said he hoped so. So nothing in the works yet.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I actually really like Papa Johns, I just wish that some more actual restaurants would branch out more with their pizzas. Even places that let you choose your own toppings don't have anything that you wouldn't find at any ordinary place.</br>  <br><br>not<br> you're gonna carry that luggage </br></br></br>  <br>my nigga that was the shit<br>as in it was shit</br></br>  <br>there's a will</br>  <br>First episode can still be bought from Trigger's online store: http://trigger-global.ecq.sc/lwa-bl<wbr>uray01.html<br><br>Second episode will probably be there as well when it is available.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A will without kikestarter money is useless. I doubt the sponsors would be willing to give them the money to do another 50 minute OVA either.</br>  <br> The music was too loud and too many scenes didn't have music at all. Felt kind of weird. <br>They haven't finished production yet, that might be why</br></br>  <br><br>inb4 Jeff Goldblum image</br></br>  <br>All we have here are the disgusting Chicago deep dish garbag. Found your problem.<br><br>not to say I don't appreciate non-traditional pizza (goat cheese and artichoke is some 10/10 shit). But I think pep pizza is pretty damn good as it is.</br></br></br>  This was so good.<br><br>There were a few cool references thrown in, too. <br><br>I hope Trigger makes this their next project after Ninja Slayer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. Futafags need to be wiped out.</br>  <br>Will have to buy that when I get a bit more shekels.

They also worked on KLK and Sushio said in an interview that they weren't very good when they started, though a few of them did vastly improve. It depends on who's helming the project and how they drive the team. Yoshinari and Sushio are about the only artists at Trigger who can draw consistently well at a fast pace.</br></br>  Do the impossible.<br><br><br>I also liked the spirit bomb at the end.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Spats, thighs, intense blushing.</br></br>  <br> the spirit bomb <br>You meant the genki dama?</br></br>  <br><br>Well shit I didn't know that.

Akko is supposed to be a mediocre student after all.</br>  <br>I'm sure it was intentional, considering things like the note Lotte was reading was in flawless English. Akko also spelled Lotte's name "Rotte".</br>  <br>It seemed like the headmaster didn't give more than a cursory shit about that sham of a "parade" and just dumped it on them as a halfhearted punishment for being failures.</br>  Anyone else notice how early Lotte started working on the Shiny Chariot hat? You can see it in the corner.<br><br>It looks done in this image, but she still showed up late.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the parade is a pretty shitty gig and nobody would volunteer for that shit.

Nakajima had begun writing the story at least five years before they seriously began considering the project.</br>  <br><br> Akko is always in her mushroom experiments <br><br>Akko confirmed as beloved to Sucy as Mushrooms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would be nice that they made it like FLCL, just 6 episodes sound like perfect.</br>  Yoshinari's shape language gives me boners.  <br><br> There will never be a doujin about Sucy hooking the girls on drugs to make them do whatever she wants </br></br>  <br><br>Ditto</br></br>  I''m fine with even just more manga.  Did any anon at Anime Expo meet Isuna Hasekura? What was he like?  <br><br>Was there more than that one shot chapter on mangafox?</br></br>  I wanna fuck that milf  <br>That's a nice cake.</br>  <br>I want to see more of her with the Shiny Chariot eyes. I think they actually go even better with the black/blue hair than the red hair.</br>  <br><br> infinite shit <br> not Korean Desk Car <br><br>Anon, get on my level.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does this thread get stickied and 3000 replies?<br><br>Has the Triggerfag cancer already spread this much? Are the mods really this autistic?</br></br>  <br>Lurk more.</br>  <br>Because it's the best.<br>If you don't like it you can go to Reddit, since it's more your style. I hear they're barely talking about it over there.</br></br>  <br>Go away, newfag. Stop crying like a little bitch that there are lots of people who enjoy what you dislike.</br>   <br>It sure is interesting going back in time and seeing some of this stickies. It's strange that they only count from 2012 forward when I am pretty sure Eksopl's original archive dates almost as much back as the /a/jp/ split. Shame we can't' see again things like the modcat sticky in 2009 or the CODE GEASS insanity of 2008.<br><br>The funniest thing is that when moot left he said that his decision was a year or two in the making, and exactly that much time earlier there was a surge in moot shitposting on /a/. Can't help but think that at the time he was trying to re-bond with /a/ and find reasons to keep on trucking, and we offered him none of it.</br></br></br>  <br> or the CODE GEASS insanity of 2008. <br>My biggest regret is not being on /a/ in 2008 for that. I've heard stories, but it just isn't the same.</br></br>  As soon as I can I need to watch this...<br><br><br>Liked this enough I saved it,then fiddled with it to make a wallpaper,and I'll share it:</br></br></br>  <br>Reddit love Trigger and Kill la Kill.<br><br><br>It's not just that I dislike it, Trigger generally produces garbage, which in turn, attracts hordes of idiots (like yourself) to /a/.</br></br></br></br>  Will we ever get doujins of Amanda?  ive never heard of this anime before, what about it warrants over 3,000 replies?  <br>I hope so.</br>  <br><br>I want my dick between her thighs now.</br></br>  <br> Trigger generally produces garbage <br>I wish what Trigger produced was garbage.<br>Anime as a whole would be amazing then.</br></br></br>  <br>Its a really fun and memorable watch you should check it out.</br>  this was good and i liked it <br><br>thanks for reading my opinion /a/ have a nice day</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should watch it and see for yourself, retard.</br>  <br>Here is your reply.</br>  Why is this garbage stickied  <br>It's like when Disney was good.</br>  I put in a few bucks, I suppose I may as well watch it.  <br> triggerfags this delusional <br>Having all their anime abide by "the rule of cool" trope, and being incapable of doing anything else just proves they're shit.</br></br>  <br>subscribed</br>  <br>To make retards angry.</br>  <br>I know a place in Boston that does just that. It's fantastic.</br>  <br>To piss you off.</br>  <br>So you haven't even watched this.<br>I hope this is stickied for another week.</br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>It's because the mods are triggerfags, and this summer's reddit horde has arrived for another season of crazy, wild trigger shenanigans!</br>  <br>If he were holding a wrench, Orange Star CO.</br>  <br>I don't think the time you wasted on /a/ is brag-worthy, but if you weren't here for Code Geass you haven't experienced true /a/.<br><br>It's a shame that it's basically impossible now for a show to unite the entire board under a single banner, even if you do have enough people interested in a single topic to dominate the board, like in the KLK ending, there will also be enough contrarians to make sure half the board is threads complaining about it. <br><br>Unless, of course, we go in a spam-happy mode like the one we engaged back when Haruhi S2 was announced, but that's also a long shot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Haruhi S2 <br><br>Oh man now I wish I had been on /a/ when KYON-KUN DENWA was happening, it must have been a riot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Get off my board nerds</br></br>  <br>And now we're here.</br>    <br>CG didn't really unite the board either. There were people who disliked the show, myself included, but it was a time when the board was much smaller, there were no catalogue, people didn't have a mentality of keeping it to one thread nor were the concept of "generals" even a thing back then, and threads didn't live for very long. As a result, the people who liked CG spammed their threads on all pages, just like what happened with TTGL.</br>  <br>Not him, but<br><br>Alas, the cancer /v/ and /r9k/ spilled onto the rest of the board has done its work.<br><br>People are just too obsessed with upkeeping the "mood" of 4chan up, they confuse the old elitism and absurdity with being a retard on purpose as a "joke" or projecting on the attitude of others.<br><br>I think Guilty Crown was close. Where the MC turned into Mag-"Fuck Hitler, I can do his job better"-neto for all of two episodes, but it wasn't nearly the storm CG was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a commendable sketch analysis.</br>  So many indignant tightwads hating Trigger these days. <br><br>I would hate to be that much of a faggot.</br></br>  <br>So, this is the "after" shot?</br>  <br>The suffering was real.  I ended up droppign it on the second episode of Endless 8 and never finished. Been enjoying Yuki-chan, though. </br>  <br>Don't let the shitposters make you loose your way anon.</br>  <br>B-butt, that's Lotte =(</br>  <br>Probably newfags who weren't even on /a/ when the original LWA aired as a part of the animation training project, long before KLK was even a thing.</br>  <br>There were colored versions of this!?!</br>  <br>It's on Vimeo?</br>  <br>  <br><br>Might as well post a small update.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice point.</br>  <br>More Sucy Akko please. Your work is great.</br>  <br> just like what happened with TTGL. <br><br>Not even remotely the same and you know that yourself. <br><br>TTGL /a/ made modern /v/ look like when Deathnote and Higurashi were /a/'s darlings, and the ex-Big Three could be posted with no irony. <br><br>CONSTANT CONTRARINESS, SAGEBOMB EVERYTHING WE DON'T LIKE, CUTE THINGS ARE SHIT EXCEPT NIA!<br><br>Lucky Star's main segment was bad, but the specific discussions about what was good about it were the only things I liked in the board at that time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just filing it under all the other shows without a S2/3/4</br>  <br>  ;_;  </br>  <br>unf</br>  <br>It's odd, even when intentional, since LOOK was spelled correctly. So not exactly a Japanese romanji error?</br>  <br><br>do you have a  tumblr  or somewhere you put your shit?</br></br>  <br>Sorry but no. It was exactly the same thing. The fans of both shows spammed threads for the sheer fun of seeing the pages flooded with threads. It was great fun if you were a fan of either show, but very obnoxious if you weren't. I'm guessing that as a fan of CG, you were probably blind to the other side of it all. After the second season of CG, in late 08 and throughout most of 09, meta threads were very popular, possibly triggered by increasing amounts of spammers, downtimes, and the like, people talked at length about whether or not the board was becoming irreversibly shit or not. And in those threads, you saw lots of people voicing unfavourable opinion about what happened to the board culture in the wake of very popular shows like CG or TTGL.</br>  <br> http://kyderdraw.tumblr.com </br>  <br>You can still find some stuff by searching.<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/974381<wbr>4<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/139597<wbr>27/#13959755<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/139599<wbr>93/#13960457<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/139708<wbr>59/#13970993<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/273207<wbr>82<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/312365<wbr>41</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  neat  Akko is a fucking cunt.<br><br>Needed more Sucy.</br></br>  I hope they release that LWA x Inferno Cop crossover soon.  why is this stickied  Man that was a great ride, I want another movie!  <br>All girls are best girls.<br>However Sucy owns Akko. <br>Therefore she also owns Akkos cunt.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did Inferno Witch take Lotte's glasses?</br>  <br>Because it is, bitch nigga.</br>  <br>Because over 3000 replies.<br>Thta shows you it was a good idea.</br></br>  <br><br>Akko has the best ass.

What is it? It's driving me nuts.  <br><br><br>Height alone isn't a good measure of age. Diana and Amanda are the tallest characters.<br>My 12yo cousin is almost as tall as I am (5'11")<br><br>And the characters aren't Japanese. You used a girl named AMANDA O'NEILL as an example, idiot.

Wow. Well good pick on Trigger's part.</br>  <br>As creepy as it sounds, maybe you should actually try looking and seeing what a 14 year old girl actually looks like because your perception seems a bit skewed.</br>  <br>Mind=blown. Now explain the DEEP in To Love Ru.

If you were Sayaka before episode 7, would you know that Kamijo might ended up with Hitomi if you cured him?  <br>I was thinking about Hitomi and Kamijou reasoning : Kamijou wants a better girl, Hitomi, being a perfect girl she is want a non-crippled Kamijou.<br>Sayaka was the only girl available to Kamijou but by curing him, now other better girls are available to her.

Actually, this is actually where the three ep rule can apply to the most.</br>  <br>Looks like a gear to me. I thought asshole is usually drawn as *. In either case, people in that society would never figure that out.</br>  Bitches and whores, man.  <br>Well, duh. The main theme is fighting censorship, and why censoring everything that SOMEONE may find offensive is wrong. It seems to me the point of the lewdness isn't to appeal to the lowest common denominator. If that were the case, we'd have had at least one panty shot and cleavage closeup. No, this show is about fighting censorship, so censoring everything that is normally censored is THE POINT. Anyone who says "lowbrow" about this show misses the point, I think. It's more hilarious than lewd.</br>  <br><br>That's the joke.<br>I don't see what's wrong with it.<br>It's meta, m8.</br></br></br></br>  what are the chances the audio will be uncensored in the BDs?  <br><br> it's intentional <br><br>It's not a joke or meta, or at least not an intentional one. It's japans real life censorship laws not letting the show say those things out loud.<br><br>The only "joke" here is the irony that the show in unable to follow it's own lesson. And that wasn't written in by the author or the studio that made it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> An insult to all things lewd and comedic <br><br>Even Seitokai Yakuindomo?</br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/smzqakytba.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>Man, Tumblr must be going full Shut It Down mode right now.</br>  <br>Why didn't they just tazer her?</br>  <br>Hurting a woman is illegal. Did you even pay attention to that scene or the one immediately before it?</br>  <br>Gate thread is that way.</br>  Why is she so terrible at math? everbody knows females have  seven   <br> Why is she so terrible at math? <br>You already said she's a female.</br></br>  <br>It needs to be slowed down just for the sections where she laughs.</br>  <br>It is so obvious that is in the entire Ending.</br>  <br>I don't think showing examples of ridiculous censorship within the show itself is not following its own lesson. If you screamed, "Help, I'm being oppressed!" and nothing was actually happening to you, you'd look like a prick.</br>  <br>No, touching or removing her clothing is illegal, pretty sure they have the power to tazer people they deemed lewd.</br>  <br>I think she stated any act on their part that may cause the towel to fall off, or even move just enough, would make them criminals as well. That's how retarded the fictional laws are.</br>  <br>She's purer than she lets on.<br>See <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>He gets tied up way too much</br>  <br>purity is no excuse for stupidity. she still cant count.</br>  <br>this is about modern japan as it is today right?</br>  <br>A hyperbole but yes.</br>  <br>Alright bro, so lets look at what you're saying.<br><br>It's a known fact (or at least it is as long as you've watched a reasonable amount of anime) that lots of words are censored by japanese law. <br><br>But you're saying this show somehow had a choice to not be restrained by the same laws as every other anime, but decided to instead willing censor itself in the exact same as the laws anyways, despite it's entire theme being about not having censorship.<br><br>And this makes sense to you?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not to turn this into /pol/, but one political party likes to push for abstinence and to remove sexual education. The other isn't much better in tolerating speech that might hurt feelings, though. I don't think free speech is a thing particular to a political party, but openness about sexual desires is a more liberal thing.</br></br>  Matsuki Miyu will always make my dick rock hard. She should get more roles.  <br>not quite. Japan still allows pornmags and porn in general. but soon...</br>  <br> ahhh, you think lewdness is your ally <br> You merely adopted the lewd, I was born lewd </br></br>  <br>thought they were getting rid of porn mags being sold at corner stores?</br>  <br>It's 2020 Olympic games Japan.</br>   OHOHOHOHOHO   <br>you realize they literally have zero choice about obeying censorship LAWS right? those things we all have to abide by whether we like them or not? all the more serious for a commercial product that can easily just not be shown or sold anywhere if it doesn't follow those laws?</br>  <br>like I said, soon.<br><br>First they come to the corner stores, within a decade all porn stores shall be closed, doujinshi circles will be forced underground or face serious criminal charges. exhentai will be starved out of its materials.</br></br></br>  <br>I think they write in jokes that have to be censored on purpose, for the sake of having more dialogue censored. I think they take a little pride playing with the censors, and that's not a new thing in anime at all.</br>  <br>Women are going around making money off of exploiting innocent men via extremely biased laws. It's clearly a liberal paradise.</br>  <br>I don't understand.</br>  <br>exhentai is shit these days anyways. its all spanish translations, danmachi and kantai stuff. nothing interesting gets scanned anymore.</br>  <br>The one that's censoring the show with stickers is actually Funimation. The japanese broadcast didn't have them</br>  <br>Which part?</br>  <br>can "subbers" not be lazy fucks and actually translate this show then?</br>  <br>The entire rest of the world has moved on to internet porn, if anything forcing japan to get with the times should be good for them.</br>  <br>I'll be watching it uncensored in my native language then, Even if it means waiting a few more hours.</br>  <br>Why the fuck am I watching HorribleSubs. Who should I watch with then?</br>  <br>Is this bait? The raw was censored.</br>  <br><br><br>You guys could just use this<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>08010 + the raws http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07836</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>   an entire generation deciding that their kids won't breed and their race will die off within a generation <br> allowing yourself to be collared <br> not just taking the fucking collar off <br>The premise of this anime is too stupid for words.</br></br></br>  <br>So she's an hypocrite bitch? She wants everyone else to be ignorant of sex while she gets all the fun?</br>  <br>Funi added even more stickers. They censored the handjob movement she does with her hand when she unmasks herself, for example</br>  <br>You'd be amazed what an all-powerful government and decades of brainwashing can do to a society.</br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>708010</wbr> <br>Is this going to be a contstant thing where as this person just releasing the .ass?</br></br>  <br>And added one over the word Sex in the chalkboard</br>  I want to teach her about cucumbers.  <br> show about lewd words <br> .ass </br></br>  <br>Read the novel, the council as a whole is lpretty much like that.</br>  <br>I assume it's not that they don't breed, they just don't tell them how it works until the very last second.</br>  <br>Good thing the premise isn't important in a comedy show.</br>  not a bad season for lewd anime so far  <br>What do we do now that fansubbing is officially dead?</br>  <br>Best first episode of what I've seen<br><br> JC Staff is doing this and Prison School <br>Lewd</br></br></br></br>  <br>But wouldn't Japan then become the laughing stock of the world because people don't even know what sex is?</br>  Does CR just not pick up whatever Funi picks up?  <br>I'm going to actually watch this to verify that the sticker censorship is non-existent, but I'll prematurely say thank you. You do good work.</br>  <br>no one cares as long as they keep producing electronics and cars</br>  <br>Imagine a stereotypical teenage American couple going to Japan and doing lewd things in public.</br>  <br>It has dirty jokes written in to it because that's the point of the show. I highly doubt they're doing things just to get them censored to try making the show a martyr for it's own cause.</br>  So I just watched a censored episode? <br>Why is Funi so shit? I mean, CR is shit too, but Funi is even more terrible, fuck you too Daiz, this is your fucking fault.</br>  <br>This webm is a fine example for the people that won't believe me</br>  <br>I don't visit CR much, but I'll assume they're going legit now and if they don't have the simulcast license, they won't air it. That's kind of how a license works. One company gets the rights to distribute.</br>  <br>It would be the same thing with the flies, except with two manatees. No one would understand what's happening without lewd voice overs</br>  <br>Shouldn't CR try to avoid that to stay in business?</br>  <br>this too.<br>I don't remember if Funi added censorship for any of the others</br></br>  <br> censoring the word sex <br>Why would they do that? The person in charge of that decision HAD to see the irony, right?</br></br>  <br>They wouldn't care because in their eyes, the people laughing at them (the world) are just indecent, uneducated idiots who aren't as enlightened as them.</br>  <br><br>I think it was a joke from Funi anon</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, what the fuck?</br></br>  <br> This is something people actually believe <br>Never change, internet. oh my god</br></br>  <br>Alot of people who fansub or like fansubs have nasty things to say about CrunchyRoll monetizing. They were, in the beginning, no different from the other animu stream sites. They'd take fansubb'd stuff and host it. They got big, started charging money for 720p streams, bought rights to simulcast, and turned right around and started screaming "Stop fansubbing, you're taking all our money!". So, these days, yes. They will avoid infringing on a lisence.</br>  <br>Why isn't there a muxed version of this? Fuck Funi.</br>  <br> funi has a sense of humor <br>I don't think thats true</br></br>  <br>Well, their jokes suck major cock.</br>  Worst thing is, funi picked up Gangsta and Prison School too, so brace yourselves for more funi censorship. I'm expecting that scene where some guy fucks the whore of Gansta in episode 1 to be censored in Funi even though it wasn't in the Underwater release  <br>I meant, shouldn't CR try to avoid Funi getting everything for themselves?</br>  <br>Except lewd lolis<br> inb4 Prisma Illya won't have the guts to show anything </br></br>  <br> unironically being a woman </br>  <br>the teasing and not showing anything in Illya is why the show is so great though</br>  <br>That's just the bidding war. I have no idea what their localization operation looks like. They may only have a capacity for x amount of shows per season. They may not have the capital. Who knows.</br>  <br>Careful anon, I might sue</br>  <br>Nah, I prefer the manga where they actually show something.<br>You know, I'm not a pro-censorship man.</br></br>  <br>Thank you for the reminder.</br>  <br>whatever man, you're the one who started talking about the show anyways, not me</br>  <br>You have no power here succubus.</br>  <br>And actually they breed, they just prevent unnecessary sexual stimulation.<br>If you cut off the 2D, some people will revert to 3DPD due to lack of choice and make babies.<br><br>And what  said.<br>Using political correctness and "good morals" as weapons/cover to enforce your power is something actually happening.</br></br></br></br></br>   literally genderbent hentai kamen <br> AOTS <br>Not even the concept of the show is original</br></br>  <br>Senketsu Subs has been doing this at least the past year. I set my torrent client to just download the .ass file and a raw. Leopard-raws is usually better quality than Ohys, but frequently Ohys puts out quality raws, so it's not a universal rule.</br>  <br><br>Wait.... what the FUCK?</br></br>  <br>Whatever indeed.<br>It's just that anime is more dry regarding sexualized lolis than american series.</br></br>  <br>Read the conversation, funi added a couple of censorship stickers</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>I suggest reading 1984 or other actual distopian literature, there are plenty of ways to make people breed without pleasure or sex being a part of it.</br>  <br>No concept of any story is original any more.</br>  <br> fiction is real <br>They tried that shit in Soviet Russia.

I tried watching a few mins of this but just can't stand the Funi censor shit.  <br>Shouldn't they be with their husband?<br>I mean she's pregnant.</br></br>  <br> it wasn't enough for Funimation to ruin this show with their terrible meta-humor, let's get even worse trolls on the case as well <br>Fuck no!</br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>This is the rare case that MC was the one who has experience compared to sub characters.</br>  <br>They were linked earlier in the thread.</br>  <br>Fair enough, but seriously, for high school students to be this far separated from the truth of reproduction. I imagine artificial insemination is probably the main method in this hilarious dystopia.</br>  <br>What the hell are you talking about. How did anything I say imply i'm in favor of communism. Does explaining the difference between real life soviet russia and the futuristic japan of this shows setting would make massive censorship more conceivable in the shows setting somehow mean i'm a communist?<br><br>Get over your paranoia and learn to read before you go around thinking you look cool for insulting people over your own misunderstandings.</br></br></br>  <br> implying that wouldn't be perfect for a show like this </br>  <br>Meme anime of the season, that's for sure.</br>  <br>If you are implying the 'two mothers' to be a couple, why would they both go get pregnant at the same time?</br>  <br>If you don't fully denounce communism in all its forms, even fictitious, then you are one of them.</br>  <br>You don't go there to give birth. You go there for medical exams. The husband doesn't need to be present for the doctor to check if the pregnancy is going along fine.</br>  <br>Honestly, as long as they ripped the uncensored raws and translated the puns correctly, at least with some translator's notes, I could live with it.</br>  <br>If a show is funny, I want to laugh at the actual humor that the writers intended. I don't want to laugh AT the show in a half-understanding way, taking at face value the "translations" that are shown to me by people I don't trust to translate correctly. I have never been OK with this "trollsubs for shitty shows is OK" attitude.</br>  <br> I'll just play my retardation of as a joke that will let me pretend I'm not just an idiot. </br>  <br>"You hang up, no you hang up" syndrome maybe ?<br>I may just be overthinking it.</br></br>  <br>Come on, these kind of jokes actually justify over-localization</br>  <br>The fact that you felt the need to explain, in detail, why you think communism might work in fiction and why that makes it realistic, in:  says a lot about your character, namely that you are a sympathizer.</br>  <br>Aren't there still censorship stickers right before they do the fly show, when the two are on the track field?</br>  <br> explaining how a system theoretically COULD rise to and maintain power automatically means you think that system SHOULD rise to and be in power <br><br>You're quite the stupid one aren't you.<br>If you keep replying at this point it's going to be blatantly obvious you're just mad over looking stupid and trying to damage control. For your own good I suggest you just give up now.</br></br></br></br>  So this show is about how public morality and lack of proper education is turning people into brainless mess, rapists and young parents?  <br>Is this some kind of 4th of July themed troll? It ended a few hours ago my time...</br>  this one is going to be a challenge for the TL with all the wordplay, too bad based Vale isn't with us any more.  <br>The fact is that it can't and shouldn't. That's all you need to know, commie shit.</br>  <br>It's about thought crime. Something that is on the rise in America and other Western countries.</br>  <br>I warned you and you still did it. How sad.</br>  <br>No<br>Rokka no Yuusha and Ushio to Tora are better so far</br></br>  <br> I warned you <br>You're so wise. You made an off-color remark about communism and you foresaw that you would be told to fuck off. How much do I have to study to be as smart as you?</br></br>  <br> either of those <br> being in the top 10 anime of the season <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree that those are good, but you have to get out of your ass and watch Gatchaman Crowds S2 too, so far the strongest candidate for AOTS</br>  <br>Are there any hetero "relationships" either shown or implied, wondering if i should start reading the manga</br>  <br>(you)</br>  I'm confused as hell.<br>Is this show going to be about dirty Japanese puns for 12 eps? And they even *beep* out the obscene words. It's just so ironic this show has to beep censor itself. I don't think that will be enjoyable in the long run.<br><br>They would have infinite ecchi potential if they made pure girls do lewd things without them even knowing, because they're too pure to understand.</br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha, this horrible try to be funny. Ebin mate :^)</br>  <br> because they're too pure to understand. <br>That was basically the point of the fly movie scene.</br></br>  <br> Gatchaman Crowds <br>The first season was shit.</br></br>  <br>This. Some of the characters were cute and had erotic designs, but the show was cringe-tier garbage. Why the fuck do we need another season of it? It was a chore for me to finish the first season.</br>  <br>Behind the left knee.</br>  <br>That was a joke, not fanservice. If they had any ecchi, surely they would have shown it.</br>  <br>I'll give you a hint: in breast augmentation surgery, they insert the silicone bag THROUGH the nipple.</br>  <br>But women have 2 boobs. That would make 5.</br>  <br>But there's two nipples, leading onto 5.</br>  <br>He's talking about the scene where they show the flies fucking while she dubs over it to the school and everyone gets aroused but doesn't understand why.</br>  <br>The pooper doesn't count.</br>  <br>It's the urethra, silly. You can't use it properly to fuck, but it's a "mouth"</br>  <br>Only a needledick Jap would think that the urethra was a fuckhole.</br>  <br>I'm lost as you are.</br>  <br>many keks</br>  <br>You just gotta stretch it a bit first.</br>  <br>This has to be fake</br>  Hentai has taught me that women can be fucked through their...<br> mouth (1) <br> ears (2) <br> eye sockets (2) <br> nasal cavity (1) <br> nipples (2) <br> armpits (2) <br> that space in between their thighs (1) <br> in between their tits (1) <br> vagina (1) <br> urethra (1) <br> anus (1) <br> belly button (1) <br> hands (2) <br> feet (2) <br> hair (many) <br> random holes in their body (many) <br><br>Count them up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because it's not supposed to be fuckhole, doesn't mean there aren't people that 'use'' it, just like anal.</br>  <br> &gt;nasal cavity (1) <br>Can't you fit a tiny nip dick in either of the 2 nostrils?</br></br>  <br>The key is to simply remove the nose and fuck the cavity.</br>  <br>Why are you so obsessed with japanese penises anon.</br>  <br>You realise they're the same subs right? It's just so it's not on a hardsubbed and censored video.</br>  <br>Because I am a young japanese girl, blossoming into adulthood and just now learning about these kinds of things.</br>  <br>Aren't we all.</br>  <br>Hey, this post is you, right?<br>Are you a penis otaku, m8?</br></br>  <br>It was the sticker over her hand that Funi added. It was a couple times too, I think. Middle finger and HJ gestures.</br>  <br>Ummm<br>Ummm<br>Um</br></br></br>  <br>Think you're missing what this anon's trying to explain. The jokes themselves are dirty, and can't be said in the totalitarian society of the show, and the meta-joke is that the jokes can't be shown on TV in our own society. So the more dirty jokes they make and have to bleep out, the more poignant the meta-joke is. If it's not funny it's because it had to be spelled out to you in this thread dumbass.</br>  <br> Think you're missing what this anon's trying to explain <br>I know exactly what he was saying and you don't need to explain. I'm saying I don't think thats true.</br></br>  Why didn't they just record themselves fucking and play that instead.  <br><br>It's called horseshoe theory, anon.<br><br>If you actually scrutinize their actions and find the core of what they're trying to push, the far left and far right really aren't all that different from each other. In many instances, the biggest difference present between their policies is who gets to be the upstanding good guy who represents everything that's right with the world and need to be protected at all costs and who gets to be the evil boogieman who's an enemy to the aforementioned hero. Of course, neither side is self-aware or intelligent enough to realize that the crazies that they hate so much are a mirror of themselves in many ways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Point is the subs are still poor for anyone who wants better subs, considering Funi translated several things incorrectly/changed them from what was being said.</br>  <br>So you think all those wacky censorship sound effects were unintentional? They were forced on the show? Did they also make them include the dings, the squelches, the and the farts? Because usually they just bleep that shit out. Maybe they just decided to get creative for some reason.</br>  <br>Do you think they have a choice about censoring the words or not?<br><br>Because they don't. The government would literally not let it on the air if they didn't do something to censor those certain words. They use wacky sound effects as censors instead of a simple beep because its a wacky show and the law doesn't go so deep as to specify exactly what you can use for censors. <br><br>Trying to make the most out of what the law lets you do does not automatically mean you're actually making a meticulous meta joke about the law itself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the beauty of adaptation</br>     276 replies <br>Don't tell me that /a/ is actually liking this piece of shit? I couldn't even finish the first ten minutes.</br>  Who else is subbing this without those censor stickers. I don't even give if a shit if it's Commie.  <br>You have shit taste, then.</br>  <br>You could just do this </br>  <br> liking fisher price's tm your son's first lewd show </br>  <br> he doesn't agree with me over something neither of us can factually prove / I can't argue any more <br> lel I'll say it's bait <br><br><br>The bait meme sure is cancerous. I mean it's not like discussions were always super amazing in the past but at the very least you didn't have to expect literally EVERY argument to eventually boil down to one person saying "there's absolutely no way somebody could ever think differently about anything from me. clearly they are just pretending to think something I don't think for the sake of tricking me into responding"<br><br>If anything "bait" images have all become bait themselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, there are two penis otaku, it seems.</br>  <br>What? Say that again with fewer buzzwords. I couldn't understand any content from your post.</br>  It certainly might be after NNB, JC Staff are slowly starting to adapt some good shit now.<br><br>Shokugeki and this.<br><br>I loved the first episode, One of the best so far.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not liking fun things <br>I wasn't going to give this show a chance, but I'm glad I did.</br></br>  <br>This is the shingeki no kyojin of lewd anime</br>  <br>Keep trying.</br>  <br>Not as bad as basketball.</br>  I can already see the doujins from this.  <br>If I pull that off will she die?</br>  <br>No but you'd get arrested for touching a woman.</br>  <br>No but you'll get charged for public exposure.</br>  This world is so fucked  This fucking scene  <br>Why does she only throw erotic images of women?<br><br>Why none of men to get the women aroused too?</br></br></br>  <br>maybe she throw them too but the general audiece for this shit prefer to see pictures of naked girls</br>  <br>Douijinshi of sensei learning the secret of pregnancy through genetic modified giant bugs dicking never</br>  This guy is literally /a/.  postan dubbles    <br> like you ilk </br>  <br><br>yeah this is some top-tier /b/ shit</br></br>  <br><br>Kill yourself, pathetic faggot.</br></br>  Pretty good start overall and the story is pretty good at least on the LN. what do you think /a/.<br><br>Also <br> FREMY THE ONLY BEST GIRL <br> RABBIT CAN SUCK DICKS AND GTFO </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty fun<br><br> When should we see the girl in pic related? </br></br></br>  <br>Next episode for sure</br>  After watched the OP&amp;ED, i know why this show have 2 OP and 3 ED  <br>Next episode.</br>  <br>How many episodes is going to have this show? because the LN is actually on volume 5 so they can go and rush until that volume (cuz cliffhanger at the end) or they can just stay with 12 episodes and 3 volumes adapted.</br>  <br> Rabbit girl isn't actually a Rabbit girl <br><br><br>Lame</br></br></br></br>   art and animation looks beautiful as fuck <br> music sounds mellifluous <br> compelling story <br> yet nobody cares about it <br>This must be Pleiades of this season.</br></br></br></br>  The OP is quite nice.  Shit anime, how can there be conflict when the MC is the strongest man in the world?  So everyone's going to die right? The scene in the ending showed "strongest man in the world" half starved to death and looking defeated. I hope he abandons his comrades and watches them all get slaughtered as he flees.  <br>I think full 3 vols would be a nice stop.<br><br><br>Really? I think they gonna change after some character left and join.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HAVE YOU EVER READ ONEPUNCH?!</br>  <br>12 episodes. Some say that they will adapt only 2 volumes would be pretty cool if that's true.<br><br>Volume 2 would be better.</br></br></br>   THIS  <br> IS  <br> SPARTA!!! </br></br>  <br>He says strongest but he's a trickster. It grinds my autism.</br>  AOTS  it's set on 1400ish M√©xico  <br>Had the stupid LN thing where two characters that both have the same knowledge exposit to each other for no reason other than the audience doesn't have information, but other than that, it was good. A very nice pilot. Hope the quality keeps up.</br>  <br>You know what, if you follow Passione's twitter account right now, you're even in first 20 to follow them.<br><br>https://twitter.com/office_passione<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>How would a mediocre shounen be AOTS?</br>  <br>I love the Aztec setting. It's pretty rare to see fantasy anime having a non-european world. Definitely the setting itself is a breath of fresh air, we will have to see rest of the show to see if it ends up being good. Had a good start though</br>  I had a lot of fun watching this ep. I like the MC. The combination of cocksure and complete dick dirty fighter is enjoyable. I like the setting, the art and music were OK.<br><br>This is the sort of show could go horribly, horribly wrong, but I'll keep watching for now.</br></br>  <br>The strongest is a trickster, simple as that.</br>  Question for those who read the LN, does the story get serious/dark in the future? I don't like suffering or edgy stuff.  <br>They are expanding very slowly.</br>  <br>Look for the previous thread if you want big ass spoilers.</br>  <br>I know the feeling. There's a ton of terrible LN adaptations out there that start off promising with great pilots, and then the budget just goes to shit. Not to mention I think the longer an LN goes on, the worse it gets. The medium as a whole seems to have a problem of being needlessly drawn out. The planning ends after like one volume, then they start to wear the premise thin with bullshit.<br><br>Fingers crossed. I think I'll like the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Shhhhhhhhut up, Anon. It's too early to say that.</br>  Cant wait for Black Rabbit.   reading vol. 1 <br> finally find out   who the fake is <br> "Ok, now the plot can finally continue!" <br> read the epilogue <br> mfw <br><br>Are they fucking serious?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How the fuck did Passione go from Rail Wars to this? Holy shit what an improvement.  <br>Better director</br>  <br>those rabbit hips are so unf</br>  <br> The scene in the ending showed "strongest man in the world" half starved to death and looking defeated. <br>Have you seen the episode? That's when he was young and went to his master.</br></br>  <br><br><br>The second episode ends a little bit after goldov shows up. 80% chance it'll just be two volumes or at the very most 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Black guy looks like an asshole.<br><br>Let me guess, is he MC's rival in getting some rabbit's pussy?</br></br></br>  <br> but he's a trickster <br>Hisoka wants to have a word with you.</br></br>  <br>He's not an asshole.<br> rival in getting some rabbit's pussy <br>Adlet isn't interested.</br></br></br>  <br>He's her knight.</br>  LNfag here. Chamo is best girl post.  <br> token loli <br> not even fanservice <br> best anything </br></br></br>  <br>yeah he's more intrested in Remy than Nash</br>  <br> Adlet isn't interested. <br>B-but those hips goddamn. <br>It's asking to be destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to put my penis inside the rabbit girl.</br>  <br>Only thing that irked me, is that his little fire to the face trick in the fight didn't blind the old guy or burned his face.</br>  <br>LNfag here, Chamo is an annoying cunt.</br>  <br>  muh kill <br>  muh pet <br>  muh angry <br>worse charecter ever</br></br></br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/xgdqswbuva.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  So is the LN to this actually good or is it just generic shitty LN tier shit?  <br>Depends on your tastes. It's not harem for starters, more like mystery.</br>  <br> fagboy protag fighting and edgy bullshit <br>What do you think?</br></br>  The designs and animation aren't that great but I liked the setting.  <br>Wow, you serious?</br>  <br><br>The only thing that grinds my autism is that the story is supposedly in an Aztec/Maya setting, yet there are no human sacrifices.</br></br>  <br>It's fantasy/mystery. I'm personally not one who likes mystery but hey, if it's your cup of tea. Had to drop it because I couldn't stomach the characters.</br>  <br>Now, I am not a fag, but the MC's gradient hair tingles my dick.<br>Honestly, gradient hair in general does. We need more of it.</br></br>  <br>It's like people don't even think Chamo is adorable as fuck.</br>  <br>You mean to tell me there's no romance between the two?</br>  <br>Not really. Next thing you know and she's trying to stab Adlet.</br>  <br>None at all.</br>  <br>I am incredibly inclined to agree 100%<br><br>Mora a cunt<br>Nash a literal beastiality slut<br>Molonia a shit<br>Fremy is love though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She loves dogs.</br>  <br>What's the point of a token loli? She's never going to be anything more than that</br>  <br><br>Dropped like it's hot.</br></br>  <br>She's the required team-fight specialist in terms of combat.<br>She's the naiive yet OP character to be turned against the rest as necessary when it comes to spotting the 7th.<br>She can the strong point or the weak link of the party as the plot requires, as in vol 3 or 4.</br></br></br>  <br>None.</br>  <br>Rabbit only has tits. I always associated her with light blue rather than yellow for some reason.</br>  <br>So, a token loli.</br>    <br>Brute strength gets you fucking nowhere here, the kyouma bosses are all clever bastards that will fuck you up if you're dumb.</br>  <br>Well I mean after Rail Wars, expectations of the studio must not be great.</br>  <br>The wild ride never ends.</br>  <br>Truly we never would have guessed by the iconic Aztec-like architecture and apparel.</br>  <br>Shame. she has the best design out of the girls. <br>I almost thought I finally found a main girl who's also the best girl.</br></br>  <br>On the subject of Rail Wars, how well did the show do sales wise?</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Heh.</br>  Best girl<br><br>Old thread <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127612855 </br></br>  <br>Why is Piccolo stalking Gohan and Videl?</br>  subs fucking when  Just got home.

So guys, do you like the DBS's soundtrack?<br> In my opinion it's bullshit </br>  <br>Chichi becomes perfection<br><br>That form was so damn lewd back when I was around 5</br></br></br>  <br>if you knew chinese you could watch anime you know<br><br><br>i bet you don't even speak chinese</br></br></br></br>  <br>are you fucking stupid</br>  <br>Because Funimation are assholes</br>  Damn that was a shitty opening. I don't think I'm nostalgiafagging when I say that it doesn't compare to any opening from previous series. Hell, GT's opening might be my favorite and I hate GT.  <br>this made me fucking laugh, thanks anon<br><br>anyone wanna do a sonic edit of this?</br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong,and also a faggot.</br>  <br>No, yes.</br>  <br>Guaranteed subs for tomorrow at the latest, this is DB we're talking about. Barely anyone gave a shit for 2014 Kai and it still got subs quickly</br>  <br>4 subs, anon.</br>  <br> that was a shitty opening <br>That's what everyone always says in the first chapter.</br></br>  <br><br>god damn it murrica, get your shit together.</br></br>  That was a cute episode, I wonder if in this season Goku will open a Mexican Restaurant.  Am I alone in thinking that some of the best episodes throughout the Dragon Ball franchise were the random one off episodes that had nothing to do with the main story?<br><br>I really liked the early DBZ episode where little Gohan runs away from Piccolo's training and encounters the homeless kids who are trying to avoid government agents trying to take them to a home.<br><br>Or the episode where Goku and Piccolo learn to drive.<br><br>Even in Dragonball GT, the best episodes were the first arc where they're looking for the dragonballs throughout the universe, before the Baby bullshit kicks in.<br><br>Personally, I don't mind if there's a lot of filler thrown in everywhere. As someone who grew up with these characters, seeing the random episodes with the characters out of their element is fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Remember when random anime no one picked up would get anon speedsubs without anyone asking for them?<br>Hell, even stuff picked up got them.</br>  <br>My wish is that Dragonball Super is going to be 75% slice of life fun, 25% badass fights.</br>  <br>Everything is shit compared to Bruce Faulconer's stuff.</br>  The spanish subs are unsurprisingly shitty, in case you wondered.  <br>I like the early Buu episodes where Gohan goes to highschool and is a superhero, up to the tournament before they leave.</br>  <br>I remember back in 2005 when Eureka Seven came out, I often had to wait weeks at a time for a subbed episode to come out.<br><br>It didn't help that the original airing of the show had a clock in the corner that was really annoying. There was a group called Nanashi Subs that did a good job of removing the clock, but they were also the slowest subbers around. They didn't finish subbing E7 until a few months after it ended.<br><br>I'm sure this is all surprising for newer anime fans, especially given how Eureka Seven is a fairly well known show nowadays.</br></br></br></br></br>  where the fuck do the spanish sub groups post their shit  <br>People got too spoiled with HorribleSubs ripping CR, Funi and other streams.</br>  <br>One of the few times I enjoy knowing Spanish. <br><br>Usually it only helps in understanding Telenovelas, which are complete bullshit besides the hot women.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't.<br>They edit an annoying logo into it and post it in their stream sites with the shittiest encoding</br></br>  <br><br> Goku and Goten having fun <br> Mystic Gohan <br> golden SSJ forms <br><br>I like it better than the recent movies already.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why isn't Funi simulcasting this show?  <br>Because they are assholes.<br>I hope CR picks it up for non-english speaking countries. They do that with One Piece here. At least that way I could watch a decent spanish translation.</br></br>  <br>Dub</br>  I hope this series guarantees us more DBZ doujins.  <br>Who really enjoys ATB?</br>  <br>Because Sabat and co. are lazy assholes who will get around to it when they feel like it</br>  Videl voice is making my dick to go even further beyond  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DJc<wbr>uDgVYjgI</wbr>  [ ]<br>BEST OPENING</br>  <br>They're an incompetent company. They never released the OVAs and specials either. This is the same company that makes such shit subs Anno won't let them release 3.33 because of it.</br>  <br>Seriously, even I've resorted almost exclusively to Horriblesubs the past few years. <br><br>I kind of miss the old days of subber wars. There used to be a group called Shinsen-subs that everyone hated, but they used to be quick and subbed a lot of stuff, so everyone begrudgingly downloaded their stuff. It was a running gag to complain about them while continuing to watch with their subtitles.</br></br></br>  <br>I do. <br>Turn based RPGs&gt;"Action" RPGs.<br>The combat in ARPGs is shallow as fuck most of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YgH<wbr>NtzxO0y8</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>FFX was best Turn based combat<br>X-2 was best ATB</br></br>  Milk is best girl!  So Goku was a farmer he have to get money he have to have a job  <br> implying the Murican voice is any better </br>  <br> more like buushit </br>  <br>I remember when a show called Kurokami came out in 2009. It had a simulcast dub for some reason. I remember thinking back then that the days of simulcast subs and even dubs were right around the corner (and maybe even shows reanimated for English dubs; a key reason why dubs don't compare to subs is that the show isn't animated for different languages).<br><br>The simulcast subs part came true, which is enough for me. I still wish foreign companies had more influence on the original Japanese producers, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably just for food, seeing as Mr. Satan gave him a briefcase full of money I doubt he's in bad shape financially.</br>  <br>because their stoopid</br>  <br>Not just the Murican voice. Every dubbed version of DB in every other language is better than the original. FACT.</br>  Is it or is Hercule voiced by Sugita?  Funimation really shit the bed by not securing this for simulcast. Dragon Ball is the only reason they even exist, the streaming service had one fucking job if/when a new DB ever came to exist. Way to go Funi  <br>They don't treat DBZ like anime because half of the DBZ audience is intolerant towards the japanese version.<br><br>They'll probably just put a dub out after a while.</br></br></br>  <br>They're probably setting up a deal with some kids channel to air the dub, and I wouldn't be surprised if part of the deal is that they can't release subs until after the dubbed version is aired.</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't blame them. Keeping Nozawa on to voice Goku after he grew up might have been Toriyama's wish ‚Äì<br><br>But Toriyama is a fucking idiot.</br></br></br></br>  Is there anywhere that I can read the Jaco the Galactic Patrolman manga? Can't seem to find all chapters in one place anywhere.  <br><br><br>I am now realizing Toriyama's plan for this series is to simply remake GT following the remakes of BoG and RoF.</br></br></br>   you will never suck on Trunks' boy penis   <br>Best girl no more</br>  <br>It was a somewhat common thing in anime at the time. High schoolers and even older male characters had the voices of little kids. <br><br>Thankfully the trend died down after the turn of the century.</br></br></br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#!kxoTFKoa!TGLTd<wbr>qCrMTYKXaFzr96Kw-5ZWQIkzBvE1iaydokh<wbr>ybg</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is 6 months after the buu saga, GT was 10 years after<br><br>Unfortunately I'm pretty sure this means GT is canon</br></br></br>  <br>Vegeta is a man of his word, that's all</br>  <br>I used to hate the japanese version same as you, but then I just knuckled down and watched it. <br>Not only was I surprised at liking it, I actually enjoyed it more than when I watched it in english, and it was solely down to the consistency.<br><br>Having said that, these are all opinions and you know damn well Funimation won't leave this alone for long. A dub will be done before you know it, and it's not like 2001 anymore, these dubs are actually really damn good now. BoG's english dub is far superior to the japanese version, so I'm hoping they do the same here with Super.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Goten and Trunks will never have cute gay sex with each other </br>  <br>Trunks has a gf you faggot.</br>  <br> Krillen is 5ft <br> Vegeta is 5'5 </br></br>  <br>Why do people hate Baby?</br>  <br>Because he can't cut his hair.</br>  <br>Don't be a fag,/ss/ is where it's at.</br>  <br>Exactly what I was looking for, thanks /a/non.</br>  <br><br>Not really? Maybe a little? I think it's just most noticeable with Nozawa because she did typically voice little boys, but once boys became teens or men, no, that shit didn't really happen, and if it did, not with something like Nozawa's voice.</br></br>  guys, srsly pls post link to a subbed version<br>even spanish is good</br>  Where the flying fuck are the subs.

It's not even worth wasting your breath on anymore. We have much better and more important Dragon Ball shit to talk about now.  <br>Because it would mark a return of awesome Gohan. Gohan is no longer allowed to be awesome.</br>  <br> Goku's deserved first tournament win. <br>you mean thte fight where roshi had to not only fight off goku but monkey form goku and blow up the moon? Roshi deserved that first win all the way.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I remember the same kind of situation with Hadena, like 4 ot 5 years ago.</br>  <br>If GT is ignored, then first female super saiyan in the anime?<br><br>Or do we have to wait til Pan shows up somewhere?</br></br></br>  <br>Why is planet busting so easy in Dragon Ball?<br>Roshi's max power level ever is just shy of 300 IIRC,and he can blow up the moon.That's fucking crazy.</br></br>   No epic fights like in Z <br> No Faulconer score <br> Main enemy is a fucking purple cat who isn't even serious <br><br>Super confirmed for utter shit</br></br></br></br>  <br>if any female goes SSJ first you know its going to be from Goku's family because toriyama and MUH POPULAR CHARACTERS.<br><br>though toriyama did say in some interview a few years ago that bra was actually very strong so if we get that far then maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>You're trying too hard.</br>  <br> taking DB seriously </br>  <br> Goku has Super Saiyan 3 <br> Gohan has all his potential unlocked and Super Saiyan is useless for him <br> Vegeta looks exactly the fucking same <br> Gotenks just skips it <br><br>Not to mention that Goku and Vegeta both achieved it off-screen through training alone, while only Gohan ever made it really cool and made it apparent that it was a new transformation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's your reply</br>    <br> No epic fights like in Z <br> Main enemy is a fucking purple cat who isn't even serious </br></br>  <br> Main enemy is a fucking purple cat who isn't even serious <br>That part was correct though.</br></br>  <br><br>Delete these,please.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This is sort of a problem with the series, though. DBZ gets forgiven for being DBZ, but a good shounen series starts off small and unassuming and slowly grows to its full potential, which makes the super powers at the end more impactful. <br><br>I've always thought Gurren Lagann to be a good example of the proper way of doing this. Kill la Kill's attempt at imitating it failed by powering up the characters too fast.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about you delete your shitpost first, summerfag.</br>  <br> Falconer  <br><br>Amerifag</br></br></br>  <br> I've always thought Gurren Lagann to be a good example of the proper way of doing this <br><br>And you're an idiot to do so.<br><br> Kill la Kill's attempt at imitating it <br><br>Further illustrating my point</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No,I'm telling you to delete them because all they're doing is feeding the guy who's obviously shitposting.<br><br>This can go too.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Toriyama's intention with the power levels stuff was to show how you can't rely on them at all (Vegeta even pointed it out). So why do people still take them seriously?</br>  <br>Yup Gohan really is the only one to pull off Super Saiyan 2. which is sad to think because its pretty much pointless now.<br><br>loving SSJ2 is hard...</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want to change the best anime tsundere?</br>  <br><br>Only because characters can hide them. It was still established early on that characters are capable of blowing up planets, which makes it weird when they somehow aren't blowing up solar systems now that they're thousands of times stronger.</br></br>  <br>You're an idiot for trying to get a point across with name-calling.</br>  <br>Why do Americans have such a shit taste?</br>  <br>Stop.</br>  <br>All the burgers do things to their sensories.</br>  <br>as if there was ever any doubt</br>  <br>All the planets are filled with dynamite</br>  <br>the game has dual audio, You can switch to Japanese. I know I did.</br>   Goten is a midget at his DBSuper age <br>we saw goku change in height slightly throughout DB (huge jump at the end of DB) wonder why Goten isn't?</br>  <br>Because Goku is also a midget at Goten's age?</br>  <br>He stopped training and became a scholar, like his mama always wanted him to be. I don't understand why so many people have a problem with this. The whole point of Gohan was how different he was from Goku. He wasn't some selfish battle crazy nutjob who was in it for the thrill , he was a kid constantly thrown into life or death situations to protect his family and friends. This is a huge plot point at the end of the Cell arc, when Piccolo is chewing Goku out for throwing his son into the battle and not realizing how his son really felt about things.</br>  <br>Goku barely changed in height, also it's only 6 months after buu saga.<br>They said that at the start.</br></br>  <br>I have no problems with Gohan being study/family first kind of guy, but the whole he forgets to go Super saiyan and he's just thrown into battle just to get his shit kicked in to show off some villains strength.<br><br>that is shit that shouldn't happen. take him out of the show or leave him out of the fights.</br></br></br>  <br>goku changed slightly in height. (but i think it was more to do with Toriyamas art style than anything else.) but BOG took place 4 years after Buu and Goten looked exactly the same. hell he looked even shorter.</br>  <br>That's probably mostly art style.<br>If I remember correctly, goku didnt grow until he was like 15+<br>And yeah i'm pretty sure it was an artstyle thing</br></br></br>  <br>Baaro is the group most likely to do it. It seems most sub groups are apprehensive about doing it, in part because of potential licensing by Funimation and their streaming service, and also because of anime elitism. This is all just speculation, but the attitude I see coming from a lot of those groups' communities is very DB-negative. It's a little disheartening, the lack of interest on the part of the subbing community, but it's probably in part to blame on the popularity of the series and how ignorant and annoying it's community can be sometimes.</br>  <br>I'll be honest, I was really surprised that during Anime Expo, Funimation didn't announce a simulcast, closely followed by a simuldub of Dragon Ball Super.<br>It seemed like a foregone conclusion seem to have been putting time and $$$ into their streaming service and getting an exclusive on the new Dragon Ball series for their service would've been a great thing for them to get.<br>Their big announcement at AX turned out to be that they're on the production committee for some show that nobody cares about based on a manga that no one has heard of.<br><br>Probably is Toei being dicks over the license, trying to squeeze more money out of Funimation.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This group is doing it:<br>http://the-moonlighters.ml/<br>When they released their preview they said:<br> From the same team who brought you Baaro's releases of Dragon Ball Kai, and with the help of a lot of additional staff, we're taking on Dragon Ball Super, starting with this ... <br>So basically it's Baaro plus a lot of other people</br></br></br></br></br>   this guy turns into this <br><br/></br>  <br>Is that a grown up Akane from Dr.Slump?</br>  <br>I don't think having a higher power level would always mean being stronger, that's why they aren't reliable. Think about Gohan during the Namek arc and how despite being weaker than Vegeta he could inflict more damage whenever he was angry.</br>  OP is sweet <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fkb<wbr>xNypK6ds</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  So judging from what Toriyama said in  does this mean the inhabitants of universe 6 are just going to randoms that somehow have god level strength?  <br>Why do a lot of enemies have pruple ki again? <br>For japs purple means death or they are afraid of it or something if I remember right.</br></br>  <br> left to right </br>  <br>I'm not a fan of Sumitomo's work for 2014 Kai, and his work for Super, while not quite as bad, hasn't been great. The only part I enjoyed was that arrangement of cha la that played in the episode. The biggest problem is that there just isn't any sense of identity in his work. Kikuchi's Dragon Ball/Z score was filled with repeating motives, the opening song was was woven into the score of the series, the characters had leitmotifs, their own little theme music that played. It was all part of the series identity. The same can even be said for the Faulconer score, it had it's own sense of identity with the show, and repeating themes for each character.<br><br>But the new stuff? None of it fits together at all, it just sounds like a series of unrelated throwaway compositions that Sumitomo had loaded into his computer.<br><br>I enjoyed the new opening a lot more than I thought I would initially, but I can't help but think of how much better it would sound with Kageyama singing it. That sense of identity within the show will certainly be missed.</br></br></br></br></br>  reminder that hercule is a turk  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sKr<wbr>61lco1O0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>He does look pretty eastern european.</br>  <br> hercule </br>  <br>It's not Funi's fault entirely, I'm sure they want to. They're hungrily promoting everything DBZ that they can, it's their biggest property.

Shame about everything else.</br>  <br>lol where is this from ? :)<br>i know its DB whats the comics name is there a ehentai link ?</br></br>  <br> This is a huge plot point at the end of the Cell arc, when Piccolo is chewing Goku out for throwing his son into the battle and not realizing how his son really felt about things. <br><br>While it's true that this is a huge plot-point for Gohan, it's retarded how people still use that particular scene to prove that Piccolo knows Gohan better than Goku, when the reality is that Piccolo is only that openly emotional about Gohan's because this is Piccolo after fusing with Kami, so he's both wiser and understanding and literally able to read Gohan's mind to know what he's thinking.<br><br>Piccolo, prior to this, was completely content with having Gohan train with him and Goku for those three years before the Androids knowing full well how dangerous dealing with Dr. Gero would be.<br><br>Also, though Goku was stupid for sending Gohan out there to fight Cell, without explaining his intentions, he was absolutely right in relying on Gohan's hidden powers, because not only did Gohan's own power had eclipsed Goku's, even before the Room of Spirit and Time training was complete, Gohan himself was being naive in thinking he could reason with Cell, if not flat-out refusing to fight, despite previously losing his shit over Semi-Perfect Cell nearly killing Piccolo and Tenshinhan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Any news on this?</br>  <br>This. It sickens me that everytime we have something new, faggots have to go "so does this kill GT? GT isn't canon no more! GT is so bad amirite guys do i fit in yet?"<br><br>Let that goddamned show die already, there are new and exciting things happening and all you have to say is GEETEE hurr xD?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe in Murikka Burgerland it's a meme.<br>Have some shitty fanart.</br></br>  <br>moon lighters probably will</br>  <br>No. I mean you can get what's going on with them, but there's typos, grammatical errors, untranslated lines, and pretty sure some mistranslations are bound to happen. <br>Not so long ago these same sites released ep 00 of Gatcha Crowds S2 and while the character clearly said, in engrish, "PLAY THE GAME", they wrote it as, "CREATE GAME". So trusting their translation is not recommended, either wait or rewatch it when there are proper subs</br></br>  I feel like buying a VCR and VHS tapes, taking yellow subbed versions of the Dragon Ball Super episodes, cropping them into 4:3 mode and recording them onto the tapes. Then I'll make custom covers/packages and sell them to poor people. I'll make sure to badmouth certain shops/sellers in the ending karaokes too.  <br>see </br>  <br> A magic dragon will never turn you into a cute tanned shota </br>  <br>I'd buy that...</br>  best movie villain coming through  <br> download? </br>  <br>Yeah, took only 10 minutes to download it from JKanime.

He's set for life, even without doing anything new Dragon Ball made money for 20 years.<br><br>The real truth is, Toei was going ahead with a revival whether Toriyama was on board or not. Seeing what happened with DB Evolution and how Fox ignored his reaching out to them, it awoke his sense of pride in his work and he had to take control when Toei approached him with a new script. And then he realized that now that he didn't have to do everything himself, he was having a lot of fun working on the new stuff. It reflects in his work too, you can really tell that Toriyama is just doing whatever the fuck he wants for fun. I'm sorry you're not getting anymore Broly anon, I liked him too. He overstayed his welcome by like 2 and half movies though, and he wasn't even an actual character.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm releasing them on a pastebin for now if you give me a sec, I can go find the link for it</br>  <br>I change my mind, I'm so gonna enjoy these threads if retards like you come every week.</br>  <br>Here<br>http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx</br></br>  <br>I like the composition of the OP.

It's from the YrYr Music Collection torrent, an album called Yuruyuri no Uta Album Aikawarazu.<br><br>It's bizarre, it has the regular character songs except the entire cast (or at least the entire amusement club) is singing them. There's a rendition of Koi no Bakkin Buckingham - sung by Kyouko, I think - that devolves into laughter by the second half. Chinatsu also sings Himawari's song while Kyouko screams "CHINACHUUUU" in the background repeatedly. I feel like I'm listening to the lost cosmonaut recordings or something.</br></br>    <br>Tell me, why does she ehehe at the donuts?</br>  <br>No body cared who she was until she ehehe'd at the donuts.</br>     Check Bakkin <br> No new chapter. <br>Fuck off OP.</br></br>  <br>Did you assume the guise of shitposter in order to save the thread from page 9? You are a heroic man.</br>  Unless we start talking bout Yuru's.  <br>but ayano,  if you pee on yourself i'd be okay with it </br>  <br>Here, let me help!</br>  <br>I think someone wanted that in the last thread and no one delivered.</br>    <br>I can't translate most of that but that part is basically the Amusement Club going to karaoke and singing other character's songs, and mini-dramas in between. There's also some other songs.</br>  <br>It literally says "Akari/Yui/Chinatsu version", written in hiragana for extra moe. I think track 5 says "protagonist change" though.<br><br>And track 1 is best song.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Thanks, makes sense now. The info in the media player informs me that Yui sings Bakkin Buckingham (fuck knows how I heard Kyouko), and her laughing all the way through it might be my absolute favourite thing in the whole music collection.</br></br>  <br><br>Thank you for double-checking for me, chum.

This person genuinely like Sakurako scenes, however <br> &gt;implying i've had sex </br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't choose between Ayano and Chinatsu. Not a great list, though, especially for Himawari fans.</br>  <br>Waah! What are we going to do on the bed, Anon-san?</br>  <br>Here's my possibly-more-accurate one:<br> Akari <br>You have protective instincts and feelings which compel you to pick Akari as your favourite just so she's not left out.<br><br> Kyouko <br>You're lonely in real life, you wish you could be like Kyouko but your social anxiety stops you. You try to be Kyouko-like online sometimes, and it usually ends up with everyone calling you a faggot.<br><br> Yui <br>You see yourself in the cool, level-headed Yui. Chances are you're actually neither cool or level-headed.<br><br> Chinatsu <br>You are fascinated by her autism and wish to know the secrets of her mind. You might also be autistic yourself.<br><br> Ayano <br>Same as Kyouko fans, except you have a more realistic view of yourself and thus relate to Ayano's neverending sadness.<br><br> Chitose <br>You laughed a lot at Season 1 Episode 12 and made her your favourite regardless of whatever happens next.<br><br> Himawari <br>Your personality is similar to Sakurako's.<br><br> Sakurako <br>Your personality is similar to Himawari's.<br><br> Chizuru <br>You're an outsider or something. More realistically, you chose Chizuru just to be contrarian.<br><br> Rise/Nana <br>Again, you're probably choosing them to be contrarian. If not, then, you like explosions or something I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  old and busted<br>meet the new cuteness</br>  <br> Ayano </br>  <br> Chinatsu <br>Perfectly true.</br></br>  <br>tfw ayano is accurate. <br>my ideal person is a mixture of ayano and oreki from hyouka</br></br>  <br>Most relatable character ever written.</br>  <br>WELL YEAH THATS THE WHOLE POINT AND WHY KYOKO IS IN LOVE WITH HER</br>  <br> You're lonely in real life, you wish you could be like Kyouko but your social anxiety stops you. You try to be Kyouko-like online sometimes, and it usually ends up with everyone calling you a faggot. <br>Please stop. It hurts.</br></br>  <br> You're an outsider or something. More realistically, you chose Chizuru just to be contrarian. <br>What I find bizarre is that you're perfectly capable of writing accurate and sensible ones for the other characters and you decide to show how little tact you have on Chizuru. I really wonder why you do this.</br></br>  <br> you're lonely in real life <br>yes<br> the rest <br>no</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Chizuru, but I think anyone who picks her as their favourite over the main cast is probably being contrarian, given that she's got about 0.05 seconds of screentime and appears in about 4 manga panels.<br><br>If you want a proper one, here you go:<br> Chizuru <br>You feel like you're distant from everyone else, looking on with confusion. You feel like you're alone in the world. You might have something in common with Chinatsu fans, but you're more level-headed and calm than them. As an aside, you also like accusing attractive, intelligent and successful alpha males of being tactless when it comes to Chizuru.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> attractive, intelligent and successful <br>Are you perhaps also nihilistic?</br></br>  <br>And with a wicked sense of humour.</br>   page 10 <br>Thread saved by pajama-clad heroes</br>  <br> tfw I started the ehehe meme.

But it uses the deconstruction of genre tropes to criticize Japanese culture itself more broadly. Nagoya, in Japanese media, is the rural countryside. Typical stories set there are either this idealized pastoral kind of thing, masking a kind of creepy reactionary yearning for the past, or mean-spirited comedy at the expense of the rural poor and uneducated. So, basically, in this first episode, they introduce elements of both types of countryside story, and then quickly undermine them to illuminate things the creators want to change about Japanese culture in general.</br>  <br>52+18+20=....?</br>  <br>Nagoya? But they are in Nagaoka...</br>  Oh look, another anime about gender issues. The number of shows that are worth watching if you're not gay decreases by each season. When will this trend finally stop? Will there ever be another anime for people who are not sexually confused?  Straight people are scum.  There is nothing about gender issues in this anime. Get the /pol/ out of your brain, it's making you retarded.  Surprisingly, anime is made for multiple audiences. Not every anime in every season is made for you. Get over it. <br><br>This is like saying "when will the chick flick trend end?" as a guy. It's not a trend. It's aimed at a different audience.</br></br>  <br>i see you've already been brainwashed by the media</br>  <br>I see you're trying too hard to be edgy, but nice trips though.</br>  Oh look, another shitposter who has been here for not longer than two years. The number of threads that are worth reading if you don't want to read blogshit decreases by each season. When will this trend stop? Will there ever be another thread for people who are not butthurt faggots?  <br>the boy in op pic is actually a girl. the anime is about a girl who acts, dresses and refers to herself as a boy. do your research first next time before you post, duh.</br>   WAAAAH WHY AM I NOT BEING PANDERED TO I DON'T UNDERSTAND CAPITALISM <br>Literally tumblr logic.</br>  <br> SJW referring to others as edgy  <br>lol, forgot to tip your hat</br></br>  <br>If you think fedoras are associated with SJWs, you have a serious problem.</br>  <br>it's an anime for gay teenagers who have not fully come to term with their gayness yet. they can self-insert as a girl who is literally a boy.</br>  <br>first sexuality, now you're even confused about fedoras? do SJWs even try anymore these days?</br>  <br>the gay mc is a SJW himself, you might enjoy this anime</br>  <br> Will there ever be another anime for people who are not sexually confused? <br>OP pic is a girl though, why would i sexually confused</br></br>  <br> draw a boy <br> call it a girl </br></br>  <br>This shoujou shit had more action then any of the other shows.<br>I'm hooked.</br></br>  <br>it's a shounen anime</br>  <br> refers to herself as a boy <br>Except that's wrong, you fucking retard.</br></br>  <br> implying reverse-traps aren't a popular fetish </br>   KISS KISS SHOOT A GUN   <br>have you even watched the episode?</br>  <br>Have you?</br>  <br>yes, very popular. on tumblr and /lgbt/.</br>  <br>have you?</br>  <br>Yes. Have you?</br>  <br>yes, that's why i'm puzzled by your comment :s.</br>  <br>I guess you must have brain problems, then.</br>  <br>why? once again your logic makes no sense</br>  Your complain sounds like there are anime with trap MCs every season.<br>Trend? Holy fucking shit, I'll never know this trend if you don't say it, OP.</br>  <br>Stop pretending to be retarded. No one's buying it.</br>  <br>It's a fucking reverse trap anime you retard. "Gender issues" nothing.</br>  <br>you talk about retardation and brain problems all the time? why not discuss this anime instead? did you even watch it?</br>  I thought we would be getting another Ouran.<br><br>Not the case, unfortunately.</br></br>  <br>You appear to have short term memory issues.

Fuck off back to /v/ you dumb shit.  <br>Yeah, better be 100% female/male instead of 50%</br>  <br>A deep metaphor about how flat chests are justice and pure?</br>  <br>  Will there ever be another anime for people who are not sexually confused? <br>I sure hope not. I really like having shows tailor made for people who can only be attracted to 2D middle schoolers.</br></br>  <br>Flat is justice!</br>  <br>Well, the only thing I've decided to do is to give it the 3 episodes rule of /a/</br>  <br>3 episode rule doesn't always have to be followed.

I still can't believe she single handily got the tryhards to quit.</br>  Anyone else watched this yet? I found the first episode pretty fun.  Fuck you, chinese bun!  Aight OP and ED are pretty catchy. <br><br>I feel like I shouldn't like the ED but still.</br></br>  <br>What's with japs and their hatred towards China?</br>  It's like if you took the hair of a troll doll and glued it garfield's scalp.
