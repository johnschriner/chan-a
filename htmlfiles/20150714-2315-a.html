[ How come Bazett is so strong? Even though she's just a normal human, she easily defeat all the girls, and seems stronger than even Berzerker from s1.<br><br>Can any Heroic Spirit even win against her? She seems really overpowered, even Rider's strongest attack, Bellerophon, was no good against her.</br></br>  <br>Against 5th war Kotomine, yeah. But against prime Kotomine Nasu said he'd beat her in a fight.</br>  <br>Prime Kotomine was only a thing during the fight against Kiritsugu. That's basically the peak of his whole life.</br>  It's also that the girls aren't as experienced fighters. Magical Girl Kiritsugu would probably have made the match up more fair.  <br>I hope you get better Hisui!</br>    Hestia on the front page.  <br>Hestia sucks<br>Danmachi sucks<br>You're all cancer</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Danmachi is pandering garbage for tasteless idiots.</br>  <br>  GOOD LN's </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OhW<wbr>8APyGlFo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>SHE HAS NO STYLE <br><br>SHE HAS NO GRACE<br><br>THIS KONG HAS A FUNNY FACE</br></br></br></br></br>  So LNfags, is this bitch really a traitor? Spoil me, how did she betrayed the group?<br><br>Also I'm really digging Adlet's fighting style. Action/fantasy anime needs more Trickster.</br></br>  <br> Western style writing. <br><br>That's not the problem, you fucking moron. I read LN's myself, but don't pretend that they aren't shit. They are written in a incredibly simple manner, as they are made for teens.<br><br>They are literally a babys first novel in writing quality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So you read shit for teens?</br>  <br>Because that's the only thing Tgurneu did to him, the rest was all himself.</br>  <br>No, a babby's first would be goddamn comics and manga. Even if it has pretty pictures, it still counts as literature despite its low rung in the ladder. LN's are above that because it ain't all visual and you still have to use your imagination to imagine the details.</br>  <br>/lit/ likes quite a lot of japanese books, none of them LNs, and none of them books with "western style" writing.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/2sIKYlxDxwE  [ ]<br><br>AOTY 2015</br></br>        <br>Don't you fucking dare.</br>  <br><br><br><br>C'mon, Chen.

If it comes to it, I will totally spare 15 bucks a week for reliable scans. Having the TL is important to me.</br>  Blah  Wait for me to pass JLPT2 this December (Hopefully. I'm too scared to shoot for JLPT1 on the first try) Then we can contact Shueisha on what it will cost to license Boku Girl for web serialization ala CR?
