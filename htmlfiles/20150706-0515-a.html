He becomes a  servant  later in life and even takes down a Servant on his own.  Tohno can beat him in a fight, but it would probably end in them both self destructing.<br><br>Ryougi could probably also beat him in a fight, as even though she isn't as athletic as Nanaya, she doesn't seem to suffer the drawbaacks of Tohno's Mystic Eyes.<br> <br>Physically, Soujuurou is far stronger due to his being in tune with nature.</br></br></br></br>    <br> become a Servant, wreck everything and everyone material. <br> Lose to Ryougi Shiki anyway </br></br>  Can any other character beat gilgamesh?<br><br>If they can't and Shirou could. Then it means Shirou is the strongest.</br></br>  <br>How would you guys rank the protagonists from each series if they're at their full potential?<br>That would mean we're talking about Archer, Void Ryougi, Satsujinki, Hermit Soujuurou.</br></br>  Not even close. Soujuurou takes down a True Ancestor. Shirou got nothing on him.  <br>Gil is small time. Ryougi can fight Archetype Earth, the strongest being on the planet.</br>  <br>Ryougi is small time as well, Void on the other hand is mid to high tier that could be top tier if it wasn't for the whole human body thing.</br>  <br>Not really. Even with Alaya boost she can't do shit to AE</br>  <br>He's not a True Ancestor though...</br>  <br>If you think Gil is the strongest character, then you need to check out other shit in the Nasuverse.<br><br>Because there are plenty of people stronger than Gil.</br></br></br>  <br>Ryougi was a Counter Guardian in that confrontation and yet she was still hopelessly weak when compare to AE.</br>  <br> SHITrou <br> best anyhting </br></br>  <br>Ryougi's probably on par with a human Saber and Arc, if anything.<br><br>Her swordplay is equal to Taigas.</br></br></br>  <br>He is stated to be comparable to them in nature.</br>  <br>there's stronger people in FATE. They explicitly state that Heroic Spirits are memories, and not as strong as that person was in life.</br>  <br> Implying Taiga is equal to Saber and Arc </br>  <br>Nasu keep rising powerlevels everytime he write something so probably remake Shiki will be the strongest.</br>  <br> Implying Taiga isn't stronger. </br>  <br>Q: How proficient is Shiki’s swordplay?<br><br>Nasu: About the same as that legendary swordswoman of Fuyuki.<br>Takeuchi: Wow, Shiki is amazing! …Or rather, isn’t it Fujimura that’s amazing!?<br>Nasu: Of course, Shiki prefers knives over swords. But, setting aside likes and dislikes, if she was willing to lose the knife obsession and seriously show her full power as a swordswoman… well… it’d be enough to give a 200-year-old warrior monk pause.</br></br></br></br></br>  meh, shiki is the strongest because he has the strongest waifu  <br>He will be the  cutest  , that's for sure.</br>  <br> Implying <br><br> Melty is canon. </br></br></br>  <br>Comparable in nature, that's it. That doesn't make him a True Ancestor. He's still considered a phantasm creature.</br>  <br>How did the Tohno Gland get to Aoko if she swore off men?</br>  <br>Lesbians don't exist in the Nasuverse, only bisexuals. Rin is proof.</br>  <br>it's obvious then that tohno isn't a man</br>  <br>"plenty" lol stop this bullshit Gil is completely overpowered, he wasn't even summoned at full power because the grail couldn't manage it. It is even said that he could wreck Arcueid since she's strong against individual that use their own power but Gil uses weapons.</br>  <br> Ever doubting Tohno Gland </br>  <br>I'd like to see Gil take out ORT.</br>  Holy fuck how many people spoiled themselves Mahoyo there ? Or maybe there is just many people understanding japanese but I don't think so.  <br>Ryougi Shiki's such a generic anime character.</br>  <br>you're taking it too far now, it's like star wars expanded universe it starts to be bullshit at this point, it might be canon but still there is too much things like that in nasuverse.</br>   Implying he isn't the best protagonist <br>Self-inserts need not apply.</br>  <br>Can someone translate more All Around Type Moon chapters?</br>  <br>weren't all of them the same?  ;^) </br>  <br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/5969-ALL-AROUND-TYPE-MOON-YAR<wbr>IO</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Gil beats Arc due to compatibility. It's the same thing you see in fights like Shirou vs Gil or Shiki vs Nero, the stronger person loses to a weaker opponent because the weak guy had the perfect counter.

I didn't fully grasp her abilities but it seems incredibly strong to me.    <br>Alice is straight as an arrow, though.</br>  <br>AE can beat him easily, as for MEoDP, depends who's the user</br>  <br>If the Tsukihime remake has a route for Noel, then maybe one day there will be a Fate/remake with Taiga.<br><br> HAHAHAHAHAHA </br></br></br>  <br>how can AE take him out easily ?</br>  <br>Gil only beats Arc due to compatibility. Arc is still far stronger since she can fight people like BB and Kiara on even ground while Gil needs a massive powerup and getting serious just to stand a chance.</br>  Alice is very funny in "everything about ploys"    <br>How strong is Forte supposed to be? I remember reading on the Beast Lair forums that she's comparable to Aoko.</br>  <br>Would AE and Void Shiki get along if they met each other?</br>  <br>  BB and Kiara  <br><br>So those are another sitty characters written from nowhere.

Can moon drop and has stronger attacks. Can cause destruction on a planetary scale with less than a finger flick.</br>  <br><br>Can Aoko do something ?</br></br>  <br>she has a reality marble that can literally do anything, the ability to regenerate from nothing in seconds, and none of Arc's standard issues that would limit those powers in any way shape or form. What is Gil going to do? He can't immobilize her, he can't seal her, and he can't destroy the concept of her existence. He can temporarily deactivate her reality marble, but again, she has no limit on how many times she can use it.</br>  <br> BB <br> Shitty <br><br>Shut your damn mouth, EOP scum.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gil can destroy the entire planet.<br><br>But surprisingly enough, he's probably too heroic to do such a stupid thing, even if his ego is pushed.</br></br></br>  <br>No. She is Gaia itself and also Arc's Crimson Moon side.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Gil still has a chance on Mars I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br> actual magic that can perform impossibilities. <br>If she's creative with it, sure. 2nd magic was able to kill AE's basis after all under the right circumstances.

Nothing ever states this anywhere.</br></br>  <br>If by prime you mean Archer then yes, if just max power Shirou then nope<br> What Nasu said: <br> With this time's battle, since we're working off the assumption that Shirou "has trained/is operating himself to the max", people might think that this might end up being a good fight, but m'lady Bazett's a trained professional specializing in anti-magus battles. Technique, experience, and battle power. Against someone like her whose superior in all those regards, even with a "Broken Phantasm", Shirou's disadvantages are still not going to change. And you see. She's ruthless. </br></br></br>  <br>There's no source of that though, the only thing the contract has confirmed to provide is prana.</br>  <br>One word: fragarach<br>all of Shirou's swords are kinda considered trump cards</br></br>  <br>Even with contract he has shit stats. His main strength is flexibility of his ability and tactical mastery.</br>  <br>Shiki vs. Shirou<br>"If powers are at max and we ignore the point of self-destruction caused from overflow then Shiki will win.

Of course he beats Tohno.</br>  What feats does future Shirou have anyways? I thought all he had was participating in future wars, and a certain incident with a DAA (Van Fem?).  <br> What feats does future Shirou have anyways? <br>Archer.</br></br>  <br>That's just a mouth-to-mouth mana transfer, right? Or does Alice betray her husbando for the She-Beast from the East? Also, Alice is a cunt for not putting her nakama ahead of Touko.</br>  <br>Ubw shirou will never become stronger than Archet.

I mean if Shirou is destined to become Archer in the future, wouldn't his chances be much higher.</br>  <br>Shiki has potential to become one of the strongest DAA if Arc drink his blood, but what does it have to do with this discussion?</br>  <br>Both fate and ubw(somewhat) have already been confirmed to CG, 1 on the VN the other on ubwtv</br>  <br>Do you have any citation for that?</br>  <br>He's full of shit. It was stated in an interview that Shirou's chances of becoming Archer in all routes is extremely low, and there is no route that changes that percent.</br>  <br>That's why I'm kind of thrown off right now. People keep on saying that future Shirou is Archer, yet Nasu says Shirou has low chances of becoming Archer in any of the routes.</br>  <br>thats right , shirou killed gil , couse he had the UBW , the perfect counter against him<br><br>Gil would kill AE with Ea and enuma elish , the perfect counter , something that "tear earth and heaven apart" against the Archetype earth , well its like fire against wood :I</br></br></br>  Why do people think Heaven's Feel True End Shirou sucks? In the epilogue, Rin goes on about how Shirou will be able to use his reality marble eventually and that the three of them are an unbeatable team of Magi.<br><br>I don't think his puppet body is gimped at all.</br></br>  <br>he is entirely reliant on other people.<br><br>Doesn't come close to UBW shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>Even Excalibur can partially nullify Ea, it has no chance against power billions of times more than that. Even Ea can be overpowered by superior firepower, it's stated in Ea's status screen.</br>  Shiki can kill servants<br><br>just saying</br></br>  Also there's probably other Saber servants that out rank him.  <br>Ryougi and Tohno can get rid of all of his projections, Ryougi can probably kill his reality marble.<br><br>Aoko would blow him the fuck out.</br></br></br>  <br>Bazett is the strongest Nasu Protagonist. <br><br>She combines the Get-Fucked punching style of Soujuurou, the lineage hax like Shiki and becomes the Servant FRAGA which as we all know Capsule Servant is just a parallel universe via Kaleidoscope.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't become Archer but Archer is the strength he will attain with training.</br>  <br>That makes nos sense. Modern humans can't reach Heroic Spirit level, even with training.</br>  <br>Apparently he did, he is not a normal modern human.</br>  <br>We know that prime Shirou&lt;Bazett so no, he won't reach Archer level without Alaya pact</br>  <br>Nasu wanks Gil a lot, so he would be easily take out a random creature that never appears in his works.</br>  <br> he won't reach Archer level without Alaya pact <br>Please stop spouting bullshit that was never said. FSN hinted many times Saber included that he could reach Archer level with training. I am tired of this dumb ass head canon.</br></br>  <br> prime <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>Either Shiki would rip his ass apart. Nasu himself said that the best he could do against Tohno would be force him to get brain hemorrhaging from breaking so many projections. He'd be screwed against Ryougi. She's even better with her eyes, KO's something similar to a deity if I remember right, and isn't anemic.</br>  Important facts about Dragon Ball Super<br><br>-It will start out with its own thing and then It's doing Battle of Gods and Revival of F as arcs and then doing something involving Universe 6<br>-The manga is monthly, not drawn by Toriyama and strictly for promotion of the show. Don't use it as reference<br>-There is no plot past this that we can guess. Anything you hear about it is fake and gay<br>-Current subs kinda suck in terms of timing and typesetting. Wait for Moonlighters. Or just watch Raw, its not that hard to get<br>-Videl is love, Videl is life</br></br></br></br></br></br>   reusing the whole movies <br> toei <br>Why am i not surprised<br>DBZfags will defend this</br></br></br>   Or just watch Raw, its not that hard to get <br><br>Wow you are a faggot</br></br>  <br>True DBZ fags hate pre BoG movies tho</br>  Are they fighting in the first ep or I can skip it ?   opening song not HERO by Flow <br>Fucking dropped<br><br> jk the op is pretty good </br></br></br>  <br>Have you ever considered that what you say out loud might make you look like a faggot to other people?</br>  <br>Skip if you only want fighting. Only real "fight" is Trunks punches a big snake.</br>  <br>There's a fight, I'm sure it'll satisfy your needs</br>  Why does Goku need a tractor when he could just pull pretty much anything by hand with little to no effort?  <br>It is pretty good.</br>  First episode was a dissapointment and somehow everyone got like 10 years younger  <br>tsundere Videl was great<br> turn her into deredere shit <br>flirtatious 18 was great<br> turn her into tsundere waifu <br>pure Chichi was great<br> turn her into horrible soccer mom <br>Bravo Toriyama and Toei</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Soccer mom spotted hashtag happening</br>  <br>Each universe has it's own God of Destruction?<br><br>Sweet. I hope there's a Hindu universe and Goku fights Shiva</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what the fuck did they do to Videl, man.<br><br>And her new design is shit, best design is the first one she had before cutting her hair.</br></br></br>  Remember when Videl was a cool martial artist? Remember when she was a human on a show with walking planet crushers and managed to be relevant for a while? Remember when she had some personality and wasn't just some waifu bullshit?<br><br>I miss those days.</br></br>  <br>Except Satan's fucking dog. How come he's suddenly grown up?</br>  God, fuck this new Videl. They completely ruined her character. And Gohan.  <br>ChiChi</br>  <br>Women in Dragonball just get shit on. At least Bulma was somewhat the same when she got knocked up.</br>  <br>Videl was never really relevant. I mean she goes 0 to wanting Gohan in like 4 chapters.</br>  <br>don't you know that once a woman settles down, she becomes a useless passive object that exists that shits out babies and takes care of them? what, are they supposed to be proactive and go on adventures like the guys? that's crazy talk!<br><br>I think 18 got hit the worst by this. She's actually a superior fighter to her husband, yet Krillin still gets treated as the real fighter out of the two. She never does shit when she could do so much.</br></br></br>  Fine, I'll get best Videl elsewhere.  <br>As much as I'd like to see 18 do more, I do equally like seeing her always holding Maron's hand or holding her. It's the cutest shit ever.</br>  <br> managed to be relevant for a while? <br>Literally never</br></br>  How is it all these years people still complain about girls not getting enough screentime in shounen.<br><br>I mean yeah it stinks, but consider the demographic</br></br>  <br>well, there is still Bulma<br>she didn't really turn all deredere with Vegeta and probably keeps building stuff/runing Capsule Corp</br></br>  <br><br> true DBZ fans <br>More like those who only saw BoG like BoG and nothing else.<br><br>Revival of F is the biggest reused fillershit.<br>BoG was complete ass, the jokes were too fucking much, too much stupidity, not enough fighting, goten and trunks are still kids but they shouldn't be, etc.<br><br><br>then we have Super, the next monstrosity.<br>reusing the movies is absolutely unforgivable. Forgetting animalfolk from towns are also that.<br><br>However, one can only hope it will get better over time, as the first episode was complete shit, except a few parts with Videl - Gohan excluded of course.<br><br>Chi-chi is a bitch, Gohan is a pansy, and now Goten's getting turned into a pansy too.<br><br><br>I'm with Piccolo on this one, absolutely disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God, 18. Such a cool character who gets shafted so hard.<br><br>Just give the gal someone to fight, seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>At least the first 2:25 minutes were good.<br>The OP is nice.<br><br>Everything else was shit, from drawings, to animation, to story, to that roundfaced Videl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  getting kneecapped in the face means being relevant <br>but I agree. Videl should be a policewoman with a tomboy attitude or something and have some personality.<br>c18 is a fucking robot so she had no personality to begin with</br></br></br>  <br>she just came in too late<br>considering how fast she learnt to fly, she could have been a beast if she existed in early DB<br>(still don't get how she was able to fly, but not to do kikoha)</br></br></br>  <br> BoG was complete ass, the jokes were too fucking much, too much stupidity, not enough fighting, <br>You've completely highlighted the things people loved about it and why it was good</br></br>  <br>Alright, she never fought anyone besides fucking Huge McDuder during the tournament, but she was a cool character at least. Plus it was cool having a human character get some spotlight again.</br>  <br> Krillin still gets treated as the real fighter out of the two <br><br>Not really, Krillin vowed to protect the Earth when he trained with Kami, so yeah, he will pretty much be dragged to all fights.<br><br>18 only cares about her family and money, she doesn't really care about Earth at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  God this was bad. There were fucking no fights. IT was all just sitting around doing nothing with a few shit jokes thrown in. What has happened to DBZ? This isn't the DBZ I knew, this is an abomination. Videl has turned fucking useless, Gohan is still a btich, and now what... VEGETA GOING ON A HOLIDAY?? Fuck this. I'm out. DBZ is officially dead.  <br>How to spot a faggot in 1 post</br>  Shes hiding her power level.  <br>Anon, that doesn't make her relevant. It makes her a character you like<br><br><br>Obvious faggot post detected (It's not even DBZ you idiot)</br></br></br></br>  <br> i have not seen Dragon ball in my life <br> i have no seen BoG/RoF either <br> i am a huge faggot </br></br></br>  <br>stfu faggot</br>  <br>Now I get what it reminded me of!</br>  <br> the only normal human woman in the entire world who can fly and use Ki <br> turns to a dere dere housewife <br><br>this should be a crime.</br></br></br></br>  Gohan is a fucking pedo.  <br>well, humans still have a skill cap that doesn't allow them to be relevant for long<br><br><br>jesus christ I didn't remember Videl to be that bad</br></br></br></br>  <br>Good fucking get the fuck out, we don't need 90s cartoon network niggers ruining DB any further</br>  I guarantee anybody who didn't like this probably hasn't read the whole manga.<br><br>Well if the show keeps being fun like this, the more these fags will get weeded out</br></br>  <br> Those huge moe eyes <br><br>God, what has Dragon Ball become. I miss old videl.</br></br></br>  Why aren't Goten and Trunks older ? Why only Videl and Gohan look older ?  <br>I have read the manga and it was about fighting, cool shit, destroying aliens, it's the most epic manga i've read. but this just shits all over it.</br>  <br>It's only 6 months after buu holy fuck pay attention</br>  <br>Hahahahha</br>  <br>so when in 10 years the movies will be completely forgotten, young people will ask "who's Beerus and why does he appear out of thin air in Dragon Ball Super? I didn't see him in DBZ"</br>  <br>Probably <br> Mfw No one here has ever read the original DB scanlations from Daily Dragon Ball Chapters back in the 90s, or even knows who Eric P. is </br></br>  <br>I didn't like it because it didn't have enough poop and penis jokes</br>  <br> Why aren't Goten and Trunks older <br>It's only 6 months after Boo<br><br><br> Only reading Z <br> Using epic unironically </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You skipped half of it then.</br>  <br>I should have done a webm of the scene, it was pathetic also on the animation standpoint.<br>Videl literally slided toward Gohan, like if they slided a still image over the background.<br>New levels of cheap.</br></br></br>  <br>And the animation you see is better than most of what Toei actually do.</br>  <br><br>That's what bugs me. Why do Videl and Gohan look like at least 3 years older</br></br>  <br>Yeah, i guess you're right. Still, her tough attitude and interactions with Gohan were fun. I don't see why that had to change.<br><br>Marriage in the Dragonball universe is the death knell to female characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Of fucking course, DBZ ended long ago.<br>This isn't the same, you shitlord.</br></br>  <br>It also happens in real life.</br>  <br>Videl only changed her hair. Gohan looks exactly as he did during those filler episodes at the end of the Boo arc</br>  <br><br>I read dragon ball as well faggots and what happened in that? UMM fighting! The only bit that wasnt was the beginning and big surprise it was the WORST bit.</br></br>  GOHAN IS THE STRONGEST IN THE UNIVERSE BUT HE DOESNT DO SHIT<br><br>FUCK YOU TORIYAMA</br></br>  <br>18 doesn't bother me so much because it's faithful to her character. Like  said, she only cares about her family and money. She's not the type to train and fight.<br><br>Chichi and Videl are more annoying because they grew up with the martial arts, and then it's like they suddenly lost their passion.</br></br></br>  <br>No, you're wrong.</br>  <br>Never had a puppy before?</br>  <br>It is Toei though. <br><br><br> and what happened in that?  <br>Lots of comedy and chill moments with fighting</br></br></br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4832907   tfw 18 is strong as fuck but wont do shit because toriyama forgets everyone who isnt goku or vegeta   <br>Heh.</br>  <br>  <br> Series called DBZ Super <br> Not DBZ <br><br>Okay guys.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She tried to fight Beerus<br><br>Didn't work</br></br></br>  <br> Being this autistic <br> Not knowing that different shows can have different themes <br> Basing your opinion of a new show on one episode <br>Wait and watch more faggot. <br><br><br>No contest.

Fight me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's pretty outclassed among the Z fighters by now because of the power creep.

I know, i'll never be clean.<br>I watched all the movies.<br><br><br> implying the horrid Vegeta dances joke was anything but forced. <br> BUU WANTS ALLL THE PUDDING <br>Yeah, how about no. Forced jokes are not jokes. I'm guessing you guys don't have any sense of real humor.<br><br><br>Young people will probably ask why Goku is powering up for half the length of the new series ;^)<br><br><br> fun <br>I want DB levels of fun, not forced japshit levels of fun. There's a difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Alright, you niggers have convinced me. First the 03 FMA and now GT. I have to see if it really is as bad as you guys say.  18 is strong on human terms but I'd say she's pretty outclassed by all the main fighters. She can't even get stronger because she's a cyborg  <br><br>Pretty sure she's stronger than trunks and goten. Sure, gotenks could beat her but IIRC they can only go regular SSJ when seperate.</br></br>  At least this time the humans have some spot in the intro, maybe this will be their time to shine :^)<br><br><br>You have never watched dragon ball right?</br></br></br>  <br>Trying this hard.</br>  <br>Not yet :^)</br>  Only reason this episode sucked is because we didnt get the best couples (Vegeta/Bulma &amp; Krillin/18).  <br> Super Android 18 </br>  <br>Where the fuck do you see the Z you cuck?</br>  <br>But I feel like that's the whole point of everything. I feel like the people who make demographics are under the impression that boys just will tune out if a girl starts kicking some ass. I don't really think they care. They just wanna see some asses be kicked.</br>  <br> Trunks, Goten <br>Nope. One on one she should outclass them. <br> Piccollo <br>are you fucking serious?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Doing revival of F and Battle of Gods as Arcs <br>All of my WHY?</br></br>  <br>If you value your soul, you steer clear of anything GT, DBO, or otherwise related.<br><br>If you are deranged enough to handle the depths of madness and shit these have reached, go ahead and watch them .The trainwreck is going to be hilarous.</br></br></br>  IN JAPAN IT WAS CALLED DRAGON BALL KAI<br><br>IN THE STATES IT WAS CALLED DRAGON BALL Z KAI <br><br>IN JAPAN IT'S CALLED DRAGON BALL SUPER<br><br>WHEN IT GETS LOCALISED IT WILL PROBABLY BE CALLED DRAGON BALL Z SUPER</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what? japanese anime are full of shit plots with women unrealistically wielding huge weapons and be war machine when in reality the strongest woman wouldn't overpower the most pathetic manlet NEET due to muscles distribution<br><br>If they made this choice it's because too many fighters in the Z group would be unrealistic and boring. So they started scrapping the women, the humans, Piccolo, even Gohan</br></br></br>  <br> Not the DBZ I knew. <br>Why do faggot like you do not know how to read a simple acronym such as DBS? Also nostalgiafag like you should really btfo.</br></br>  <br> I watched everything Dragonball, dragonball z or GT related <br>But not read.<br><br>The manga has a completely different feeling from the anime. One that is purely Toriyama just like the movies and Super.<br><br>Also poop and ecchi jokes are also Japanese humor</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>It's official name will be DBZ Super and there's nothing you can do about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey Konata, wanna do some training?<br>Sure thing!<br><br>Lucky star SUPER.<br><br>This is what DBZ has been reduced to.<br>At least Satan's decency has been shown... even if he's still the same gloryloving faggot as before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> DBZ Super <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag<wbr>on_Ball_Super</wbr> <br> http://myanimelist.net/anime/30694<wbr>/Dragon_Ball_Super</wbr> <br><br><br><br>They were good movies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know this  is whats gonna happen.</br>  <br>Is the DBO stuff really that bad? I was planning on trying to play when the new thingy came out.</br>  <br>You know what the show needs? A female-only martial arts tournament. Chi-chi, Videl, and 18 competing against the strongest female fighters in the world and kicking their asses, with a final showdown of Videl vs 18.<br><br>but that'll never happen.</br></br></br>  <br> They were good movies. <br>but you do not need to recover material that were fine to okay movies and stretch the content out over 12 episodes</br></br>  <br>Still trying this hard.</br>  <br><br>Piccolo managed to get the upper hand against 17 after he fused with kami. It'd be close but I think piccolo could beat 18.</br></br>  <br>Are you sure it wasn't lots of bulma's ass and tits. I'm pretty sure Dragonball was lots of Bulma's ass and tits.</br>  <br>Because amerifags get hard ons from DBZ and have no clue what the original DB was like.</br>  <br>I am fine with lighthearted stupidity.<br>I am not fine with overly forced japshit jokes.<br><br>I cringed at the Buu appearance during Satan's interview. How hasn't he been revealed as the massive tool he is yet? How? WHY?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Funi rereleases Dragon Ball as Dragon Ball Z: The Beginning </br>  <br>You are aware Vegeta is next week right?<br><br>Probably Krillin after if I had to guess<br><br><br>I don't see how Funimation's is relevant here. They aren't writing the show</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not used to that shit anymore.<br>Nowadays I just watch OVA and 1 cour anime, that usually have better standards.<br><br><br>I've red it up to all the Namek saga.<br>The good stuff, where fights had time for comedic moments, where they were op, but not as much.<br>Kid Goku is still the best part of the manga thought.<br><br>This one was plain shit both in the technical department (ok, TOEI, no big surprise) and pacing and story felt so off.<br><br>Goten and Trunks having trouble with a snake? Come the fuck on, just fly higer that he can reach and that's all.<br>Even kid Goku wouldn't had any problem with that kind of thing, and we know that Trunks and Goten are supposed to be many time more powerful.<br>Please, at least stay consistent with your powerlevels.<br>The whole Satan/Goku speech was awkward as fuck.<br>Kiki being bribed so easily was also out of character.<br>Sure, she wants a better future for her kids, and money helps, but she as also always wanted Goku to be there.<br><br>You're not getting out of it with "you don't like the SoL stuff that was in DB, you DBZ kiddie".<br>This episode was utterly shit and failing at the SoL part as well.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mecha Giant Raditz. Assfaced Namekians. Humans can go supersaiyan.<br><br>should i go on?</br></br></br>  <br>Bullshit. He used to plow entire fields with his bare goddamn hands in seconds. His power level wasn't even close to over 9000 back then. At this stage he should be able to do it damn near instantly. The tractor is slowing him down.</br>  <br>You're not seriously comparing over the running joke with Satan now?<br><br>I think you seriously want Dragon Ball to be something it isn't</br></br></br>  <br>Humans going Super Saiyan is kinda iffy but it's whatever super magic Dragon Ball MMO shit so I can give that a pass. The other two intrigue me though, Assfaced Namekians?</br>  <br>But they won't be gay and just call it "Super Dragon Ball"</br>  <br>I think her and Piccolo are about equal. Piccolo went blow to blow with 17 while trying his hardest and at best they were tied in strength.</br>  <br>Father son bonding time</br>  <br> caring about localized version instead of acknowledging the original <br>ameridubfags are truly insufferable</br></br>  <br>and you are a faggot.<br>please consider killing yourself.</br></br>  <br>What if he was getting paid by the hour</br>  <br>I'm almost certain there was a doujin similar to this.<br><br>Of course it wasn't a martial arts tournament exactly...</br></br></br>  <br> running joke with Satan <br><br>I'd rather have the running joke of Launch, animal folk, Vegetto, and all the other shit that senile old fuck forgot.</br></br></br>  <br>With added scenes of vegeta as a kid.</br>  <br>ChiChi wants him to know what a hard days work is. Also he gets to slack off if he goes slow</br>  <br>I can't remember if it was said or not, but I think 18 can get stronger. She can still build strength since her power is simply extremely enhanced, not purely artificial.</br>  Why did toriyama turn chichi from a cute waifu for goku to a permanently angry mega bitch?  <br>Piccolo used the time chamber tho. Even if it didn't matter they admitted he was stronger, so by extension he was stronger than 18.</br>  <br>Toriyama stated 18 was stronger than 17, because 17 had a design flaw that didn't let him use his full power. Unless Piccollo's got massive powerups by meditating, 18 is likely still stronger.</br>  <br>Oh right. If he's plowing the field all day, he doesn't have to spend time with his kids. Now it all makes sense.<br><br>Then he needs to renegotiate his salary. They paid extra for him and Krillin in Dragon Ball. He should be charging extra for doing the job so fast.<br><br>And training to save the world doesn't count as a hard days work because she's a bitch?</br></br></br></br></br>   Wanting fights <br> Not appreciating cute designs <br><br>I hate you people so much</br></br></br>  <br> they add in scenes of Gero <br> they add in scenes of Frieza <br> they add in scenes of Beerus and Whis <br> &gt;they add in scenes of Broly </br></br></br></br>  <br>She was laughing off Vegeta blasts in early Cell saga.<br>She peed her pants when Trunks tried to blast her in the tournament.<br>I think the kids are stronger than her. That's retarded, but everything related to Trunks and Goten is retarded.</br></br></br>  The most depressing thing about this Piccolo powerlevel discussion is the realisation that he hasn't had a powerup since the beginning of the cell saga.  <br>to tell a realistic real world issue where unemployed husband is an utter piece of shit.</br>  <br>apparently her Bjs are still good</br>  <br>Yeah but to be fair, Goku doesn't really care. Dude is clearly just spacing out while he works. Because after a while the ceaseless tedium that is farming catches up with you.</br>  <br><br>Videl was always waifu bait for Gohan, she was never very relevant and after getting nearly beat to death by Spopovitch she realized her place<br>she has been tamed by Gohan, who is living out his dream of being a scholar</br></br></br>  <br>Piccolo was 17's equal after he fused with God. Then he trained in the time room.</br>  <br>Piccolo train in the time chamber unless 18 been training too the doc has her beat</br>  <br>The design flaw is also known as a Penis</br>  <br>He doesn't like Chichi that much</br>  <br>I've said this in a few other threads, but I just want a Bulma/chi-chi adventure. <br>Bulma's got something she needs, and chi-chi's the only one available to be the "muscle".<br>Adventure/Hilarity ensues.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched the raw and Toei quality is there but of course with a budget it isn't as noticeable.</br></br>  <br>Remember that incredibly brief period where Piccolo was the strongest?<br><br>At least he's the best babysitter<br><br><br> but I just want a Bulma/chi-chi adventure. <br>I'm pretty sure there was a filler like that in Z</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is literally nothing in the universe that Bulma would need Chi-Chi's help to get. Bulma is obscenely rich and basically has free access to the Dragon Balls whenever she wants.</br>  <br>Revival of F has Picollo back in his prime, fighting and kicking some ass again</br>  Gohan is a faggot.  <br><br>I like Videl a lot but that's because I find her cute. Videl was never really relevant or anything. She was a pure tsundere who was around to trigger Gohan after getting beaten up and give him a future waifu<br><br> And Gohan <br>Look let's let the guy live his life for himself for once?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And training to save the world doesn't count as a hard days work because she's a bitch? <br>Not if it doesn't pay the bills and it's something Goku enjoys doing. As soon as it got Goku some money Chi-chi was fine with Goku going off to train.<br>It'd be like if Goku practiced football all the time, made no money doing it and just did it because he wants to be the best.</br></br></br>   goku's japanese voice   The most powerful people in the dragon ball universe are the scientists.<br><br>If Gero had lived for a few more years he probably could have created an android capable of beating up Whis.</br></br>  <br> Beating some mooks of Frieza's <br> back in his prime </br></br>  <br> Goku becomes SSJ as child <br> him and Krillen fuse to beat Piccolo <br> Bardock appears </br></br></br>  <br> Remember that incredibly brief period where 16 was the strongest? </br>  <br> Goku's Japanese voice <br>Nostalgic as fuck. Truly talented woman she is<br><br><br> where 16 was the strongest? <br>When was that ever the case?

The problem is that you cannot prove yourself against someone who is much weaker than yourself. They are in a lose-lose situation. If you are strong and fighting the weak, then if you kill your opponent then you are a scoundrel... if you let him kill you, then you are an idiot. So here is a dilemma which others have suffered before us, and for which as far as I can see there is simply no escape. Now the Israeli army has not by any means been the worst of the lot. It has not done what for instance the Americans did in Vietnam... it did not use napalm, it did not kill millions of people. So everything is relative, but by definition, to return to what I said earlier, if you are strong and you are fighting the weak, then anything you do is criminal."<br><br>-some jew</br></br>  <br>Meh having unlimited access to American military technology helps.</br>  <br> unlimited </br>  <br>Google is your friend fellow American, don't stay delusional to where our tax money goes.</br>  <br>I really hope someone pays to do one of those with Rory.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127614082 <br>Kill yourself, shitstain.</br>  <br>Nagi is a pathetic cunt, you shouldn't be surprised.</br>  <br>The amount of self-hatred here makes me physically ill.

People have been saying this is the worst first episode of the season. I didn't think it was bad, just incredibly boring.  GATE is a gateway anime of the worst kind. It's a bad series, a clusterfuck of story and characterization that isn't very well done by any aspect, but which attempts to compensate for its weaknesses by adding in excessive shipping faggotry and DARKNESS. The normal anon can see this as the shit it is, and may enjoy it, hate it or be indifferent to it, but all the while recognizing that the series itself, regardless of their opinion, is plain bad.<br>However, these very aspects that try to smear over the shit of its core make it a breeding ground for aspie, unsociable underageb&amp; faggots who engage in every kind of faggotry both online and in the real world. The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry and everything about the GATE world fuels their escapist fantasies, while the pity-party character backgrounds, emphasis on revenge, and overall preachiness of the series make it fit just right with the mary-sueish drives of your average preteen and his sense of unwarranted self-importance towards the world. Exactly the kind of shit that makes little kiddies and underageb&amp; retards eat this shit right the fuck up.<br>GATE is basically THE series to attract the most hated anime fanbase known to /a/, which is why, regardless of individual opinions, it is the responsibility of every anon to troll the fuck out of this show and everyone who likes it, and ensure that no GATE threads ever encourage the newfriends to show their faces here.</br></br>  <br> The superpowered characters all trying their hardest to look cool, the jutsus, peculiar, colorful clothes, the whole ninja faggotry <br><br>C'mon son, get creative.</br></br></br>  Reminder that all this crap is just because people can't take Japan being a hero in their own story. <br>Here is a list of shitposts you should be wary about:<br> article 9 <br> war crimes <br> security treaty <br> jingoism <br> greater east asia co-prosperity sphere <br> world war 2, ww2 <br> rape of nanking <br> manchuria <br> american soldiers are the best <br> nationalistic <br> nippon steel folded x amount of times <br> nippon stronk <br> masturbatory power fantasy <br> JSDF wank <br>When encountered, report and hide.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And aside from frogeaters nobody wants to translate nuclear Yamato.  <br> giving Japan the atomic bomb <br>Great, I guess they just ensured the destruction of Japan because in a full-on nuclear exchange the US can produce more bombs faster than Japan can.</br></br>  I haven't read the manga, does it follow the army platoon around or does the MC break off at some point and go alone?

There's a lot of rape in this series. The manga has a tendency to have rape happen in a constant attempt at mood whiplash. </br>  <br>You can get a FN FAL for cheaper than $3000.</br>   anime about Jap soldiers <br> they're treated as more than just target practice <br>lol</br></br>  <br>but that's a gun. not a grenade</br>  <br><br>Its not so much advertisement as it is an indication of the way Nationalism is being drummed up in Japan. They're starting to lose population but realistically that doesn't matter too far so long as they stabilize it within the next 10-20 years.<br><br>They've one of the most technologically advanced nations, a corner-stone economic power with a military while very good, is still held back by WW2 sanctions/treaty. If you take a look at japanese politics (which you don't because you're a fucking weeb who masturbates to animu) you'd see the trend of japan trying to get back to its pre-war military power status as it drums up the island disputes with Russia and China and the fact nationalist parties are on the rise despite being relatively new.<br><br>Culture is a road-map to regional politics, kantai is another symptom of this as a reminder of japans glory days by using loli cum sluts to remind stupid weebs (like you) Japan was a renowned military power.<br><br>TL;DR: Its not a recruitment tool, its a result of cultural change right down at the weeaboo level (or i guess otaku since we're talking japs here)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I saw they avoided this issue in the show actually. The Prime Minister acknowledges the land beyond the gate as being a part of japan due to them being connected and is a "special region" so both by Japanese law and the US obligations they have, JSDF can do whatever the fuck they want since they basically just declared literally everything beyond the gate japan and since the JSDF is technically a police force as opposed to a military force, its deployment is basically just sending cops out on patrol beat. <br><br>I'm surprised this show has actually caught onto the narrow ways the JSDF is basically fucking awful and until it gets independence they basically can't do shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was my favorite character, fucking dropped.</br>  <br>Oh shit, we got a political analyst here boys.<br><br>Having some down time from your work at the think tank?</br></br></br>  <br>Hello Chinese friend.<br><br>Getting invaded on an ongoing basis generally stirs up interests in military matters.</br></br></br>  <br> Political analyst <br><br>I study Political Theory and International Relations because i decided i don't want to actually work after university and fuck around with an Arts Degree so i can be unemployed to masturbate to Animu girls forever.<br><br>So no, i'm not at all a Political Analyst at all, just another faggot posting on a board about 2D chinese cartoons who happens to know a subject.<br><br>I'm sure you know some stuff too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Put another way, the legal restrictions on the SDF's use prevented them from being dragged into conflicts that had nothing to do with them, this is part of why they are wary of easing off to allow them to fight alongside the US more, because they don't want to be pulled into e.g. another Iraq war.</br>  <br> Political Theory and International Relations <br>What are the job prospects? You know apart from being an analyst in a news agency, becoming a politician or doing something for the UN? Or teaching(bleh)?</br></br>  <br>Nah, pacing was great. It set up the main character, gave some hints on possible side characters and really amps the anticipation for the next episode. It's actually refreshing precisely because there's no instant gratification.</br>  <br>And Japan is pissy as fuck about it, because they don't want to be part of anyone else's shit, especially America.</br>  <br><br>Plenty of government work outside of Politician, infact you're probably more likely to get a job in government that isn't a politician since its your job to tell them what the deal is and hope that they actually pay attention (so basically teacher)<br><br>Theres alot of job's with Embassies in either your own countries foreign consulates or other countries consulates within your own that require Advisers. Most people who don't go into what ive listed go into either the jobs you've listed or into intelligence agencies as analysts.<br><br>Me though...this is actually pretty embarrassing as while i listed "unemployment" i plan to do literally what the MC in GATE! and simply use my degree to get a officer commission in the airforce/navy (my country is a hack when it comes to military recruiting and will give a commission to literally anybody with a university degree) and get a job pushing papers to support my hobby.<br><br>I just picked Political Theory because ive always been good at it and wanted something to be lazy in uni.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They sorta do, its more like they want people to be apart of their shit and become a regional power again. They basically are, they just need to shake off those laws that make them American's cum bucket.</br></br>  Apparently, foreign releases remove the flag  <br>So China can become their daddy? The moment a war starts Japan goes down in fire.</br>  <br>But the Japanese don't think so, and they do have a point. Japan is a maritime power. China is a continental power, and not so good at projecting force out to sea, though that is changing.</br>  <br>Are you Singaporean by any chance? Sounds like our armed forces.</br>  <br><br> War <br><br>Why would any first rate power ever fight a war? Seriously, a war between any of the top 40 economies hasn't happened since WW2 and globalization has effectively made it that if one did occur, both sides would lose in the long term either way.<br><br>No, Japan is making a play for regional powerhouse and is using Chinas aggressive expansion into the south china sea as a rallying point with the Four Asian Tigers (besides hong kong obviously) as the most powerful economy and largest manpower base. This, in turn, is attracting the attention of lesser powers in the area which lack the ability to stand up to China like japan can and is increasing economic ties with these countries and setting Japan up very nicely.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it is a symbol of racism and hatred to billions of people in Asia...</br>  <br><br> removing the flag <br><br>I know it was 70 years ago, but the Japanese Rising Sun Flag is a symbol of imperialism, jingoism, genocide, and war crimes. IT SHOULD BE TAKEN DOWN, IT TRIGGERS ME!!! TRIIIIIIIIGGGGGGERRRRRRRSSSS!!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>In SEA at least, The Rising Sun is a favorite decal for car.</br>  Why are you even surprised? Walmart, Amazon and Warner all removed products with Confederate flags.<br><br>Apparently even seeing a confederate flag turns you into a racist monster who shoots black churches.</br></br>  <br><br>Nah not Singaporean, but much respect for you guys. Could have ended up another shitty east asian country but you ended up turning yourself into the only example of a City State in the modern world which isn't just a joke/forgotten by politics.</br></br>   not wanting two bird girls kawing loudly as they ride you <br><br>Cmon guys step it up</br></br>  <br>Old people should die, it's a pretty sick looking flag.<br><br>It's like the second stage evolution of the Japanese flag. Having a wartime flag and a peacetime flag sounds pretty neat.</br></br></br>  <br> The amount of self-hatred here makes me physically ill. I prefer modern tech getting BTFO. <br><br>You realize we live in the modern era and not the middle ages or some fantasy medieval setting right?</br></br></br>  Dear Kami-sama, thank you for allowing an anime with an elf girl in jeans to be made.<br><br>Amen desu.</br></br>  <br> Gooks </br>  <br>Will this actually happen?! That would be fan-fucking-tastic.</br>  <br>I give my bow to the rising sun<br>Japan is senpai of Asia!</br></br>  <br><br> Self hatred <br><br>lolwat</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they took one look at the recent resurgence of anti-Confederate battle standard sentiment and were afraid</br>  <br>Yes it does dun worry bro</br>  <br>You are just jelly because the army of your country is an army full of murderers.</br>  Is it even possible for a gaijin to join JSDF? I want to jog for grorious nippon on a daily basis.  <br><br> billions <br><br>Oh come on, i bet you half the population of China hasn't even heard of WW2 that place is backwater as fuck</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you this is epic and you know it  <br><br>Dude, just join whatever countries military your in.</br></br>  <br> That elf butt in jeans <br>Would marry.  I don't care if she's used goods. I'll take a woman with experience any day over a fish-in-bed virgin. </br></br>  <br>It is really time to just fucking burn the west before it starts influencing the rest of the world too much with this bullshit.</br>  <br>Let's be honest, the soldiers of yesteryear are gone now and what you have a shell of what is called a soldier. The soldiers of today lack things that make a soldier like bravery, honor, dignity, and self respect. Soldiers today are welfare queens that haven't defended a single legitimate threat, soldiers of today are busy playing WoW while being out in the field, they develop nonsense like PTSD like rly? I mean, what did you expect signing up as a soldier? Were you not expecting to kill people or something. Was this not what you were trained for.</br>  <br>Yeah, sure.<br><br>They can't even stand the thought of Koreans in their country. They certainly don't want a white pigu.</br></br></br>  <br> epic </br>  <br> hasn't even heard of WW2 <br>While I agree that most of China is a prime example of backwater, I'm sure that the party has WW2 in the basic school curriculum, if only to foster a continued anti Japanese sentiment amongst future generations.</br></br>  <br>No city-state has survived more than a century with the possible exception of Venice. That said, our armed forces just commissions any Tom, Dick or Harry who signs on if they have a university degree and they end up doing office work in fatigues much of the time. The real champs are the NCOs.<br><br> mfw I am a clerk so I can't shoot shit <br> mfw this show makes it mildly tempting for me to request a medical upgrade for combat duty </br></br></br></br>  <br>When Japan and China clashed with each other after Mongol Empire, the Chinese dynasties are changed. This is a historic truth.<br>Ming&gt;Qing&gt;ROC,and the next will be CPC.</br></br>  <br>well my dear nigger i never saw fucking Phantom Weasel blowing the fuck out of dragons and you know what i'm a plane and dragons autist</br>  <br>While I agree with you on the state of the current soldier, you have to have bought into propaganda pretty hard to think that your average conscript of days gone gave any shit about being brave and defending his country.</br>  <br>It's the West, what do you expect? The very idea of being proud of your history is seen as just another vicious form of racism. Self hate is increasingly becoming the norm here and it's starting to spread.</br>  <br>I won't argue the welfare queen part, but <br> They lack bravery, honor, dignity, and self respect <br>News flash, people back in the twenties and forties weren't magically better people. My grandfather told me about 2 of his friends who balled like babies when they were forced to sign up for the draft. They sure as hell didn't have any of what you're claiming older soldiers did.</br></br></br>  How the fuck can you be a veteran in the JSDF?  <br>It has been over 100 years now since WWII it's time for people to get over it. It's a fucking flag. It's part of your history. It's not something to be ashamed of but to teach.<br><br>You don't see the US going ape shit over the southern flag do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll pass, I don't want to die.</br>  <br>Deployed overseas.</br>  <br> You don't see the US going ape shit over the southern flag do you? <br><br>What are you talking about?

That's where all the single Christmas cakes and cute onee-sans are working as non-uniformed support personnel.<br><br>/blogshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not really, Japan was a military powerhouse throughout most of its history and was even renowned for industrializing fast enough in order to meet the west on equal terms, took a large land empire within a 30 year period after deciding to end its isolation, defeated a major Western power in 1905 and then proved the flaws and weaknesses within western navies during its initial pacific blitz in '41.<br><br>Even today, the Japanese Military is a technological powerhouse and boasts some of the most advanced technology and independent industries which see's it cranking out Cruisers and arming other asian nations and even developing its own next generation stealth fighter.<br><br>Japan was an international military power longer than the United states was before WW2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Laura <br>This Laura?</br></br>  <br>So has the animu continued the trend of slowly removing the author's rabid nationalism?</br>  <br> mfw this show makes it mildly tempting for me to request a medical upgrade for combat duty <br>And go fighting where exactly?</br></br>  <br>subterranean?</br>  <br>Continued?</br>  <br>Hopefully.</br>  <br><br> Such idiocy. Japanese or any country's interests lies in pitting potential competitors against each other. Not in getting involved in a conflict directly. <br> Such idiociy <br> Proceeds to say exactly what i just said <br><br>Oh /a/, never change.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Who know's, anon, maybe a magical gate with Demi-god loli's will open in singapore.</br></br>  <br>Those are kai phantoms, its performance and capabilities are above that of the phantoms your grandaddy used to get shot down over vietnam</br>  <br>Well continued as in the trend from web novel, to light novel, to manga to animu, each of the previous steps have toned down a lot of what the author had to say on the matter.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Is it basically going to be Starship Troopers once it becomes a movie?</br>  <br>Well, all things considered the author was an ex-JSDF so he was biased as hell.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Singapore?<br><br>I'm from 42 SAR. Where did you get posted to?</br></br></br>  <br>Quite possibly, though to be honest if it turns out as enjoyable as starship troopers I wouldn't really mind.</br>  <br>The capabilities of the Kai Phantom aren't as superior to that as the regular Phantom as the Japs would have you believe.<br><br><br>Yeah, and even as a non-American, his distaste for America really messed with the immersion at times.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess, but the point was it's unrecognizable compared to the book and what the original author was trying to say.</br>  <br>Tell your Commando friend that some anonymous Commando from a country without conscription that told you he is my nigga.</br>  <br>When he write this novel, Bush is president.</br>  <br>I believe you instead then, you must have been in charge of the upgrade or at least one of the engineers working on it, sure thing buddy</br>  <br><br>D-doushio, /a/non. I have friends there, I think.<br>1 SIG BN. Classified all-regular unit. Only NSFs are clerks, storemen and the troopers. None of us know what the fuck is going on in camp (and hence the Official Secrets Act isn't relevant here)   That also means I'm stayout and therefore have much more time to shitpost on /a/ because regulars. </br></br></br>  <br> 3 months out in the bush <br> hundreds dead friend and foe <br> it's a war of attrition now <br> almost out of supplies, everyone's a skeleton now <br> you can barely remember what you're even fighting for <br> attack and counterattack of desperate soldiers, boys most of them <br> they just want to go home <br> it's time again <br> out of ammo, take on the enemy in desperate hand-to-hand combat <br> barely survive, you watch his eyes go blank, this hell the last thing he sees <br> rifle through his pockets in the vain hope of food <br> open his wallet <br> he has a picture of Laura <br> weep </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Unrelated question, how long does it take to walk around your border? How about from one edge of the country to the other?<br><br>I'm interested in how you guys deal with such limited space given my city alone is like 4.8 times the size of Singapore.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The stats and specs are freely available online, buddy. See for yourself.<br><br><br>And?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If they hate Japan so much why are they watching anime?</br>  <br>Because they think Funimation makes anime.</br>  Who Love Goddess here?  <br><br><br><br>Recently, Shinzo Abe declared that JSDF would have new guidelines/roles, allowing them to "assist" US forces around the world. Course he did this without confirming with the Diet, and now theres a lot of political backlash going on, cause apparently Abe loves the US security. Which he should because China is currently going on the offensive and upgrading its military/securing fudning through AIIB for who knows what.<br><br>Source: I live in Japan and can read the newspaper. <br><br><br>They were, but only in a supportive role, wern't even issued weapons I think.<br><br>Overall, Japan has been getting a little military friendly lately. Had a commercial on TV a while back on how JSDF pilots were protecting Japan from Russian bombers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No no I believe you, Its possible you even flew both so you know they arent different at all, thanks for the heads up, you opened my eyes, I wont fall for the japs bullshit ever again, thanks dude</br>  <br><br>Sorry, already  ORDed <br><br><br>I've no idea on walking distance but<br> I'm interested in how you guys deal with such limited space <br>We have tons of HDBs, aka commie blocks and public transport to make up for the lack of space</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Source: I live in Japan and can read the newspaper. <br>I bet you teach English for JET or something.<br><br>Why fuck can't you guys your students to speak decent English?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, the combat-fit recruits do a 28-klick march along our coastline to our city centre for the parade marking the end of basic. The ballpark figure is 11 hours, and that's with the field pack, load-bearing vest and rifle. We are an island with only maritime borders, so I'd use our total coastline length as the figure, which is about 110 klicks, IIRC. Assuming no heavy loads, probably 2.5 days without sleep and standard rest periods (15 minutes every 3 klicks for route marches in the army).</br></br>  <br>It wouldn't be as fun to watch anime with proper English now would it?</br>  <br>You might think an economic powerhouse is real but that is not. <br>For a real country, economy and military are just different sides of the same coin and becoming a military powerhouse of Asia implies:<br>1) having to fight the problem child.<br>2) getting stamped by US afterwards.<br><br>Japan's real goal is avoiding the whole problem and risks because becoming a powerhouse is inevitable and even if it did not happen, there is no great loss in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the size of the country that bothers me, it's the heat.<br><br> visit Singapore for the first time <br> Walk out of airport terminal into actual Singapore weather <br> Yikes, I stepped into some jet exhaust, it's hot <br> Walk further along <br> Still hot <br> mfw I realize this is actually the weather here <br> mfw I'm greek and I know about 40C in summer, but this is somehow much worse <br> mfw I realize 100% humidity on an island that is normally a jungle <br> Stay in airconditioned hotel room <br> Travel in airconditioned car <br> Walk around in airconditioned shopping malls <br><br>How the fuck do you people go through life like that? I'd see people just sitting around in houses with open windows. Do you have coolant in your blood or something, wtf.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> JSDF pilots were protecting Japan from Russian bombers </br>  <br> I'm greek <br>Shouldn't you be voting in a denbts referendum today?</br></br>  <br>What place in the world actually teaches their students well enough that they are at least decent at it?<br>Here in Portugal, kids are now taught English as early as third grade instead of fifth because most graduates didn't know shit about English after having it as a main course for 7 years.<br>Learning a language actually requires people to want to do that and to want to carry it through.<br>Most students just see it as a chore and the only time they are actually exposed to it is during classes.<br> Doesn't really help that after 6th grade your ass must also start learning French or German here. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Inferiority complex.<br>Especially Chink and Gook.</br></br>  ITT: a bunch of weeb NEETs think they understand world politics.  <br>Already did. Now to watch the country sink into its usual pit of retardation and fail.</br>  <br>Better genetics.<br>Better country.<br>No debt.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What the fuck are you even talking about? You seem to be under the impression that politics are some kind of video game where you have to built up your economy to get an awesome military to force everybody around you below oyu and if you can't you aren't a real power.<br><br>Everything i mentioned about the Asian tigers and the smaller powers moving into japan's sphere is what is already currently happening. Japans military, while incapable of aggressive posturing, is still entirely capable and with its long list of regional allies as well as the US its more than capable of being a regional player.<br><br>My central point is that popular opinion in the country is turning towards nationalism and gaining an independent military. Not for the sake of fucking invading China or whatever the hell you think im implying, just for the sake of independence and Political goals being set by the current leading parties in japan. <br><br>Seriously, stop playing CIV5 and then applying those lessons to actual Geo-politics when you don't even understand half of what im saying simple -is- and not speculation, which is what you're presuming.<br><br>Go back to jacking off to 2D girls, i know i am.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can fix debt.<br>You can't fix the weather.</br></br>  <br>What are they going to do once they find TYRANNY in the Empire's/Elven/Monstergirl etc. territory?<br>Who will they bring FREEDOM to next?<br><br>Of course the obvious target to FREE the shit out of would be the empire.<br>But do you think they will give the Mermaids DEMOCRACY first because oil rigs?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> taught English as early as third grade <br>I suppose this is what happens when your language has some strength on the global stage or you are insulated like Japan and China. In my country schools are mainly focused towards English as the language of instruction, granted that is a small majority of the middle and upper class who send their kids to private schools. <br><br>Public schooling is horrifying and is literally only for the dirt poor(of whom there is a majority).</br></br></br></br>  <br>All the best politics and philosophers spent most of their time doing absolutely nothing productive and just talked about whatever while also discussing the merits in fucking pussy or "boypussy".<br>What I'm saying is that there are no other better people to discuss these things than /a/nons.</br></br>  <br>There's a pun with adapt and a debt to be had here somewhere</br>  <br>Its much more comfy from late October till early February. The monsoon season cools shit down to the mid 20s with wind chill.<br><br> school holidays in December as a kid <br> fucking heavy rain <br> sleep in until 11 <br> wake up, get a sandwich and watch anime all day </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think of it as acclimatization to the environment since young.</br>  <br>Likewise, I enjoy off topic threads like this on /a/. They somehow manage to be relatively civil and productive in terms of having a civilized discussion.</br>  <br>Also besides black FREEDOM what other resources does japan give a fuck about.<br>They basically gave MC a billion dollar diamond while allowing him to shrug off half a months pay and work(a vacation)-do they even give a fuck?</br></br>  <br> PTSD <br>You do realize people have had this for centuries but hasn't become a known issue except for the past couple of decades. Stop being a stupid fag.</br></br>  <br>Gate is a double fantasy because they would never ever be allowed to go through the gate. They'd be allowed to defend against attacks from the gate as a self defense force, but going through it? Fuck no.</br>  Were you able to defend at such a gate?  <br> american education </br>  <br> You can fix debt. <br>No YOU can't.</br></br>  I get deployed to five star hotels so I don't have to do any of that shit.  <br>It's the humidity that gets you usually. Temperatures are usually around 30C, but the relative humidity is quite high.</br>  <br>I love this page, I hope it was written in complete ignorant earnest.</br>  <br> I suppose this is what happens when your language has some strength on the global stage or you are insulated like Japan and China. <br>What? <br>Anyway, It won't still fix the issue though.<br>I mean, you need to immerse yourself in the language your actually trying to learn and just learning a few things for one or two hours and then going back to Portuguese everywhere you won't learn shit, then theres also the part that 7th grade makes you not only learn English but also French or German, that's three languages you are juggling throughout the school year; English, the second language of your choice and your own.<br>Fuck, school didn't even teach me English.<br>I grew up exposed to English everywhere. Video Games, undubbed Cartoon Network... Good times, by the point I was in fifth grade I was pulling top grades without effort.<br>Now everything, even cartoons I used to watch are poorly dubbed. Video Games too. The only thing Portugal actually gives a fuck about doing an actual 10/10 dub of is Disney movies.<br>In the end, if you want to learn a language you have to actually need to learn it on your own and leave the school work as a little supplement for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All the good things of the premise are lost in the moment they start to dump special snowflakes.<br><br>If you create a setting where do you consider orcs just big monstruos peole and dragons giants lizards and therefore they can be killed easly thats fine, is an interesting premise with a credible approach.<br><br>But if in that same setting you put a female soldier beating 6 guards her alone or demiGod wrecking several elite units on her own, then it totally kills the approach.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 127631604 <br><br>I dont teach English but I do go to a lot of schools here.<br><br>Japanese kids are taught from a very early age to learn English, and most of them dont see the benifit of it/dont plan to use it, so they do well enough to get good test scores and think nothing of it later in life. The japanese kids that do study english and take it seriously are never truly proficient at it, still having heavy accents and what not. The only good English speakers I know of are the ones that actually went to America/western countries.<br><br>Had one guy that went ot america with no English knowledge, came back to Japan 6 months later and could have understandable conversations in English. <br><br>That being said, they are trying very hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Really? That's stupid.</br>  New chapter translation fucking where??  <br>I would help genocide any number of species to get in on this.</br>  <br>Slovak Guy is working on it apparently</br>  <br><br>Its viewed the same way western countries view the Nazi flag.</br></br>  <br>I never had experience with prejudice against Japanese growing up in America so I honestly never noticed. Everyone was always just concerned with the swastika when it came to such things. That and the confederate flag which is causing a fuss recently.<br><br>I feel like I've seen that flag before and no one's batted an eye.</br></br></br>  how the fuck am I supposed to relate to a 30 something year old divorced man? dropped.  <br> Being this new </br>  <br>Only the Koreans view it like the "nazi flag", gook. <br>Not even the Chinese have a problem with it, Jesus. <br><br><br>Don't listen to him, there's only one nation that's making a fuss out of it, and they're practically irrelevant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are assuming US will always be benevolent.<br>A Japanese never thinks that way. That is why Japan is building things themselves, satellite communication systems, GPS, Raders and all software around them even paying license fee meant twice the cost;researches goes into stealth, counter stealth, ballistic missile technologies and beyond. <br>It's not like she thinks she can fight against US or without US support, but getting ready for the worst is any nation's instinct that survived WWII. And in this light, Chinese aggression is not a useful leverage nor being a powerhouse in Asia desirable. What is desirable is to be inconspicuous, stable and having sufficient deterrence to military and other forms of incursions.<br>Economy and all is for the shake of national security and a crazy neighbor is pretty much the wost nightmare.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The US will remain benevolent to Japan as long as they are needed as a strong ally in the Asia Pacific region against the PRC and DPRK.</br>  <br><br>Nazi flag isnt a big deal in Asian countries either. Hell, its a Buddhist symbol after all. Not uncommon to find find japanese cosplayers in Nazi uniforms at anime conventions here in Japan. <br><br><br><br>I dont believe you understand the enmity between the two nations. There were riots a few years back when Chinese people burned down japanese businesses and torched Japanese cars. The JSDF fleet sails into Victoria Harbor, they fly with thier flags down. <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-<wbr>Japanese_sentiment_in_China<br><br>Its been growing worse lately.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fluffy bunny crotches</br>  NEW CHAPTER NEVER  <br>like, 5 days ago</br>  <br><br> infantry <br>I'm pretty sure Itami is Special Forces</br></br></br>  Shame. she has the best design out of the CVs.
