[ It's out<br><br>http://imperialscans.com/read/tokyo<wbr>-ghoul-re/34-great-shape/1<br><br>I feel like the washuu convo started weird.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  How do you feel /a/ that the only time Murika is mentioned is by a fatty ex-NEET?  That pic is a beast wallpaper for my phone  Fura another forever first-class. Why does anyone involved with Autisma is forever stuck in first-class?<br> Haise will be forever stuck in first-class because Haise will be kill. </br>  Can anyone photoshop in yahallo when haise says it to the guy?<br><br>Or tell me what the font is so I can do it msyelf</br></br>  Fat NEET confirmed to play CS:GO  Did anyone understand the washuu conversation?  <br><br>I'm already pissed off that this dungheap of a country is mentioned at all.</br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit anymore. You can fuck off with theses dumblr threads. Stop having them.</br>    <br>so close anon. so close.</br>  <br>The only thing I got out of it is that glasses washuu wants to become supreme leader but Marude doesn't want him too because he uses soldiers like pawns.</br>  This chapter seems okay thanks to it focusing on Shirazu.<br>Shirazu really needs to be the MC instead of "D-don't call me Kaneki" or the other waste of panels.<br>Now he has his own sexy tulpa.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but the whole beginning was kinda weird.</br>  Hori Chie is best girl. Everyone one else can just quit.  <br>Shirazu is the only Q worth caring about.</br>  <br>If only he would cut that fucking long strand of hair in his bangs.</br>  <br>It seems like Marude and other investigators feel like Washuu has a lot of great talents but they use mobs like pawns so they should be separated from the CCG power, it is like having someone other than Washuu being bureau director. Matsuri on the other thinks that his grandpa is too useless dealing with Aogiri, which doesn't make sense according to the context which should be Marude himself here.</br>  <br>So Imperial screwed up the translation again.</br>  <br>Matsuri sure loves to kill all the jobbers.<br>Now if only he can get kill everyone but Shirazu I will make an altar.</br></br>  <br>Maybe yes maybe no since I'm waiting for the raw.<br>If IS doesn't screw up, then the logical explanation can be this:<br> Matsuri is blaming his own grandpa for his incompetence -&gt; He wants to demote him and become the new bureau director -&gt; Marude is against this because there will be another Washuu who treats people like stepping stones.  <br><br>However, they did screw up Hirako's convo. Kuramoto was saying Hirako has some matters at Human resources/Personnel place, not "personal matters". "Personnel" is very different from "personal"</br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else notice Ihei eyeing Haise here? If she was in Arima's squad meaning that she was also at Auction together with Squad 0 to witness Haise being "lovely-dovey" with Hinami. <br><br><br>Oh shit I quoted myself instead, the reply should be to this guy: </br></br></br>  <br>In this manga you can't trust cutie girls.</br>  <br><br>Props to Ishida for turning shitty pathetic coward Takizawa and turning him into this piece of art.</br></br>  <br>I didnt proofread that. My bad. Some fem!kaneki to compensate.</br>  <br><br> It seems like Marude and other investigators feel like Washuu has a lot of great talents but they use mobs like pawns so they should be separated from the CCG power <br><br>This must be the reason why some investigator are stuck at 1st class.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His suffering is like a masterpiece, also points to Ishida for not made him into a shitty edgelord but the Pineapple hunter. <br>I need to know about him.</br></br>  <br><br>Fuck off fujoshits</br></br>  <br> fujoshits <br>Since when enjoying the suffering is being a fujoshit?</br></br>  <br>Better<br><br>Eto a perfect</br></br></br>  What if next time we see Hirako, CCG is investigating his corpse in Aokigahara forest?  <br>Then Landwhale, same shit. Fuck off</br>  <br> same shit <br>Look at the archives and point me where we consider enjoying Pineapple's suffering as being a landwhale.<br>Landwhales are crying because muh poor innocent baby.</br></br></br>  Accordint to his chapter there are more Rosewalds, also Hori said to homo prince's fanboy that he must give up his family. Is this IS being shitty again?  <br>I feel like the scans coming out this fast is a reason why the translations feel weird.</br>  Have you had your breakfast, /a/?  <br>I sure did.</br>  Why do I always end up falling for side characters and literally-whos?  How do I make Erina go boing?<br>Alternatively, how do I win Alice?</br>  <br>Seriously, how can Hisako goes from zero to perfection? I never gave a shit about Hisako until the stagiare period.</br>  <br> absolute bro <br> incredibly professional <br> computer glasses <br> best smiles <br> can kill turtles without blinking an eye </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm so fucking tired of eggs.<br>Have you ever tried ordering breakfast without eggs? They are in fucking everything. Eggs, hashbrowns/toast, sausage, good luck getting anything else. All fast food restaurant breakfasts are a remix of a godamn egg mcmuffin. I wanted to die before eating another egg in my life.<br><br>But then this episode happened. And I want to try each and every one. except soumas </br></br></br></br>  White meat or dark meat?  <br>Both</br>  <br>Both needs to be brutally fucked.</br>  <br> except soumas <br> You're the reason he almost failed. </br></br>  <br>Both are cutie pies, but Nikumi hits all the right marks for me.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127257651 <br/>  <br>I want them to kiss</br>  <br>I bet most of what you had weren't real eggs but runny egg mixes from cartons.</br>  <br>thiiiiiiiiis</br>  <br>Had Eggs Benedict before and it was the best thing I ate in a buffet line for sure.</br>  <br>We need to go lewder</br>  what's wrong with his omelets?<br><br>why don't people eat them?</br></br>  <br>What happens to souffles?</br>    <br>oh my god</br>  <br> watching FFFuckup subs <br>Anon I'm disappointed</br></br>  <br> Hisako shine at curry dish round. <br><br>Those who failed to notice that are just plebs.</br></br></br>  <br> how do I win Alice? <br><br>You have to be a poorfag like Ryou or Akira.</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, the &gt; is unintentional.</br>  So I always wait for saturdays to watch shokugeki because I'm a pleb<br><br>Did anyone make webm's of Marui's antics?</br></br>  <br>His souffles look like shit.</br>  <br>No shit.</br>  <br>No shit.</br>  <br>No shit</br>  How far will the anime run up to?  <br>Probably up to the introduction of curry or the Asura vs Souma breakfast showdown with 1 or 2 episodes dedicated to side chapters and ln content</br>  <br>Wow, when he said that he wanted to serve souffles, I thought he already considered the fact that souffles will deflate in like...10 seconds after serving and I was wondering what kind of trick he had planned in keeping them inflated.<br><br>But it turns out, he didn't think of any of that shit and that's why he's failing.<br><br>That's probably the most amateur-ish mistake ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was going until chapter 46, but with the pacing now I really don't know.</br>  <br>This is surprisingly common in this series. Souma fails here because he doesn't know how a buffet works, some chapters later  Alice will fail because she doesn't understand the point of a bento .<br><br>I thought the school was supposed to teach you those obvious things.</br></br></br>  <br>Alice is a Ruskie. Soma is a transfer student.</br>  Is Hayama the luckiest guy? <br><br> Constantly has christmas cakes falling over themselves to get to him <br> Devotes himself to a qt cake that looks young as hell <br> Makes damn good curry </br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the obvious things are something they teach in middle school.<br><br> Alice has no excuse tho </br></br></br>  <br>Does he really fail tho? Or is there some sort of asspull magic that let's him convert this rotten souffle shit into something tasty?</br>  <br>But she still went through the middle school, didn't she? That's 3 years in a japanese cooking school, how the fuck does she not learn what a bento is supposed to be?</br>  <br>Alice is Scandi.</br>  <br>Nope, those souffles are dead.</br>  <br>Don't forget:<br><br> best girl makes her way to work with him. </br></br></br>  <br>He just makes something else and gets all girls mad wet with his sweet skills</br>  <br> He drop the souffle and starts doing something else </br>  <br>No Solar Gauntlet shenanigans then? <br><br><br><br>Aha! Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Erina is the luckiest<br><br><br> born with god's tongue <br> filthy rich <br> talented at cooking <br> doesn't have to do much work to rise into one of the most influential cooks <br> free access to Souma's cock because she is the main heroine </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice has a great excuse<br><br>  She grew up in Europe and people don't serve bentos in europe so she just approached it as a japanese dish in a box  </br></br></br>   reading Fairy Tail with food   <br>Megumi has much of chance as her getting Souma's cock, fyi. And she's the other heroine, too, lest we forget.</br>  <br>She knows what a bento is. She doesn't know the nori bento Souma makes because it's cheap food for plebs and she's a rich girl who was spoonfed sugar up her ass all her life. <br>She fails because of what she prepared as her bento.</br></br>  <br>Megoomy is anything but Souma's potential lover.</br>  <br>It's a fucking lunchbox / picnic basket. Surely yuros would have a similar concept.</br>  <br>Don't forget who she has as an aide</br>  <br> using horrible subs when there are other options <br><br>Nice shit eating.</br></br></br>  <br> reading One Piece with food <br><br><br>Fixed!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Me in charge of not fucking up cropping  <br><br>Good job, me</br></br></br>  English chapter when?  <br>No one in modern western areas uses a lunchbox or thinks of bento as a picnic box.</br>  <br>RMT probably tomorrow.</br>  <br>The idea might be hard for you to conceptualize but there is a huge difference between a box full of food and drinks designed to be laid out on a cloth and individual boxes with meals inside each of them where the box acts as plate/bowls</br>  Man I'm hyped for next episode. Such a great moment coming.<br><br>Also necessary threadly reminder about best girl.</br></br>  <br> christfag <br> best girl <br><br><br>Awesome body figure, but nah. She's just a German version of Hinako in terms of personality</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger, it would be 2 PM when you wrote this.</br></br>  <br> shit eating <br>It takes a faggot who watches FFFuckup CR edited subs shitsubs to know what shit eating is.</br></br>  <br> implying its 2pm everywhere <br> implying people always wake up when the sun rises <br> implying people don't consume late breakfast </br></br></br>  <br>pancakes<br>waffles<br>french toast<br>fruit bowls<br>cereal<br><br>Come on, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the chink better</br>  <br>Even an edit is better than the full Crunchy package.</br>  <br>But she's French.<br><br>Pancake, waffles and french toast are all made using eggs though, no?</br></br></br>  Literally just had some homemade egg's benedict.  <br>Besides french toast, people don't look at food and think of their ingredients.<br>Or are you saying you think as well of the eggs used on the cakes you eat?</br></br>  <br> implications </br>  <br> Even an edit is better <br>FFFuckup doesn't even know how to properly edit or translate.</br></br>  <br>I was considering putting "other than ihop", but thought souma fans might be less autistic than the rest of /a/.</br>  <br>It's swanky hotel food, anon.<br><br>I've had fruit bowls and pancakes and cereal and whatnot in swanky hotel breakfasts.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really, but the anon was talking about how there's little breakfast without using eggs, so I was thinking of the of the ingredients for that. <br><br>On that note, German breakfast is usually an assortment of bread/buns with cured meats, cheese, jams and such, although you would normally also have some boiled eggs on the side.</br></br></br>  Do we ever learn more about her? She seems to be best girl.  <br>She's into bestiality.</br>  <br>You see her 'cook' (the finished dish rather) during Autumn election, but aside from that not very much. Smoke and even Marui got a bit more background during Autumn election and Stagiare recently.</br>  <br> cheese and meat for breakfast every day <br><br>How can I live in this pleb north american nation</br></br></br>  <br>Souma actually has some severe gaps in his knowledge. Also he gets a lot more help from the people around him than people realize.</br>  <br>I find it hard to have a normal german breakfast as a single man in a small apartment.<br>I can at max have like salami and putenburst, frishkäse, something like gouda, and the bread is the standard steinofenbrot. Even with so little it feels like the kitchen gets overrun for making so little.<br><br>So I just make american breakfast, eggs, bacon, some side, and done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, we only do this on Sundays and only if the whole family is there. During the week I just have bread with cheese and cucumber/tomato or ham because I don't have the time in the morning before leaving for university. Let alone, the food will just spoil if you're single.</br>  <br>Also I forgot to add, while I was 'interning' (Bundesfreiwilligendienst) in a big clinic, we had the same "hotel-style" German breakfast every morning + taking leftovers for dinner. Food heaven for 6 months, though the work was shite.</br>  <br>Let's be real for a minute.<br>Do someone have the recipe of this?</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p1m<wbr>GDiEbni4</wbr>  [ ]</br>    Is the food in this anime really that easy to cook? It's starting to make me feel guilty about regularly having shit like pop tarts, chef boyardee, and frozen buffalo chicken strips. I'd be a lot less guilty if they're making it look a lot easier than it really is, though.  <br>If you could cook you could have it too. It's your fault, not the country's.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, only problem is that I started lifting  thanks /fit/  and the normal german breakfast doesn't meet macros anyway, so I kinda dropped it completely besides the rare off days.<br>But damn, that's a sweet perk in a shitty job. In my praktikum we just had shitty pot coffee and hard, dry, sweet bread.</br></br></br>  <br>Some of it, yeah.<br><br>It's not hard to chop some onions and wrap them around a steak, for example.<br><br>Megumi's riceballs? Hella easy.<br><br>Dishes with special sauces might be harder but Souma's shit is mostly designed to be cheap, easy-to-make diner food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cooking nice food can be fast and easy. <br>You can start with simple but tasty dishes made in single pots and medium heat.<br>Or if you have slow cooking pots those are nice too, kinda the same.<br><br>I usually just cook quickly with a pot, throw things in it, season them, let them cook and that's it.<br>From chicken and bell peppers, to soups, chilli, etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   wanting to re-read some specific part. <br> end up reading all the way. <br><br>Why is so addicting?</br></br></br>  <br>To add to this, cooking is also really fun, especially if done for more people than just yourself. It CAN also be cheaper and healthier, since you know what goes in it compared to pre-cooked stuff.</br>  <br> no experience in cooking before <br> get encouraged by one of these threads to make some of souma's food <br> try out the transforming furikake gohan <br> shit took me over 5 hours and several retries to get it right <br> underwhelming as fuck, would rather have a nice comfy cup of instant ramen <br><br>don't listen to these assclowns, they only say it's "easy" and "fast" and "cheap" because they underestimate how much harder it is to start off from no skill or experience to speak of. as for "tasty", you'd be better off learning something that's regional to you instead of SnS's twists on japanese things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This always happens to me, I don't even know how many times I've read this manga.</br>  <br>It's just easy on the eyes. Panel arrangement, based Tosh art and the pacing isn't even that bad, election just sucked while it was coming out.</br>  <br> raw cheese <br> prepared meat <br> buns <br><br> cook </br></br></br></br></br>  I have a good feeling about Valentine's Day.  <br> literally two guys kissing <br>How is this allowed again?</br></br>  <br>Keep in mind that in line with the other pics, these two are foodgasming.</br>  <br>Are you living under a rock? America just made gay marriage legal everywhere, it's now cool to be a faggot. That day will go down in history like when the slaves got freed or when women could vote.</br>  <br>Valentins's arc can't come soon enough.</br>  <br> transforming furikake gohan <br> easy <br>Come on, that shit was really obviously difficult. You had to make your own gelatin from scratch, how the fuck did you expect to be able to learn/make that in one sitting without experience?</br></br></br>  <br>doing this tomorrow. but whats the seasoning he puts in the water?</br>  <br>I want to see the girls making chocolate.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with fooling around and sharing the sensation of a delicious dish with your bro. What a couple of jokers.</br>  D-do you think we can get elites cameos and not shadows when they animate this?  <br> Meat making bacon chocolate </br>  No but I made a pretty good beef in black pepper sauce with EFR for tea  <br>You mean for the poached eggs? Pretty sure it's salt, because else the eggs would be pretty plain and then vinegar so the poaching works.</br>  <br>I'm almost sure they will do it in the anime just like they did in the opening ceremony with Alice, Ryou, Akira, Nao and Houjou.</br>  We all have taken for granted that Souma will be an elite 10 by the beginning of their next year, but I think we're all forgetting one important thing - Erina will have a massive problem with this.<br>Do you think she will finally take an active role in preventing his ascent? Or coach someone to beat him to the seat? How will she react?</br>  <br>The only problem I see with that scene is committing to voice actors.</br>  <br> In a bowl <br> With rice </br></br>  <br> I wanted Ryou's VA for Yugi ;_; </br>  <br>She's going to need to coach a lot of "someone"s to make Souma miss, because 5 spots will open up and there are only a small handful of worthy opponents close to Souma's level: Hayama, Alice, Ryou, and MAYBE hishoko or takumi, but having all of them do better than Souma will be almost impossible. Her only chance at keeping Souma out is to make him fail, not to make enough other cooks surpass him.</br>  <br>I think the only problem would be if he took a higher seat. By next year she'll be higher anyway. If he somehow got a higher seat, she'd probably just challenge him to take it, since Souma won't say no to a challenge.<br><br>Other than that, I have some doubts that she'd do anything. While she won't admit it, after the election she's recognized his ability. And I'm not just saying that because Tsukuda said her opinion has changed. I mean, she flat out told Megumi that she should have more confidence because she was good enough to make it into the top 8 and that deserves recognition. Souma made it to the finals.</br></br></br>  <br> Erina will have a massive problem with this <br>I don't think so, not anymore<br>She knows he's good even if she doesn't like to admit it, and he has the Hisako Seal of Approval</br></br></br>  <br>epic</br>  <br>Isshiki will be first seat, so he can pretty much tell Erina to fuck off if she tries some asspull to keep him out.<br><br>And I don't see Erina as the coaching-type. Just look at her latest interactions with Megumi: she only recognizes people she thinks are good. Help someone unworthy to make the E10 only to keep Souma away doesn't fit.</br></br></br>  <br>Isshiki first seat would be so based. Polar storm coming up big again and nips like their senpai-kouhai dynamics.</br>  <br> Erina's face when she realizes she's acknowledged someone that would have otherwise been scum in her eyes if not for Souma coaching her <br>I'm really looking forward to this, almost as much as Isshiki getting serious, Hishoko becoming relevant, Takumi being something other than comic relief, or Erina discovering about Jouichirou.</br></br>  <br>She hasn't warmed up to him that much. That encouragement for Megumi was quickly followed up by telling her to not mention Souma. Plus she regretted giving him so much detail about Chinese cuisine.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps she doesn't see him as a pleb anymore, but part of her character is to be Soumas rival. Contesting his appointment is a prime opportunity to start the rivalry in earnest.<br>Unless Tsukuda wants to skip the rivalry part.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> end of the 2nd year <br> Isshiki graduating as 1st seat <br> looks at Souma <br> "alright you faggot you better bring that first seat back home" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Good question. They introduce shitload of characters who become important on Autumn Election. Guess they skipp the homecoming chapters and just go right there.</br>  <br> Erina will have a massive problem with this <br>Are you a Megumifag in disguise?<br>Haven't you seen how she's slowly 'accepting' Souma, after what he had achieved in the Elections?<br>Hell, I don't even need to support my argument with Tsukuda's words, since its already there for all to see.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think so, I think both of them being in the E10 and fighting for the higher seats makes for a much more interesting rivalry than Erina just being a bitch and trying to keep him out for no reason.<br><br>Remember, Erina will be at least 5th by next year, and Souma should be 8th at best.</br></br></br>  <br> Isshiki, Shinomiya and his dad <br> The pressure </br></br>  <br> She hasn't warmed up to him that much <br>I didn't say she warmed up to him. I said that while she won't admit it, she's recognized his skill. By recognizing someone who performed worse as being good, she's done that by default.<br><br>Let's be clear here, Erina won't say someone's cooking is good to make them feel better. If she says it, she means it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was Shinomiya PSD?<br>I don't remember it mentioned, but since he was a poorfag, I suppose so?</br></br>  <br>From flashbacks he seems to have an apartment, so I don't think so.</br>  <br>Not really. The closest thing we have are packed lunch but it's basically just a full course lunch packed in mobile vesels.</br>  <br> skipping the karaage arc which, aside from being excellent in its own right, is the basis for triggering eizan's fixation on souma that leads to mimasaka targeting takumi and souma on eizan's behalf <br>shit nigga you retarded?</br></br>  <br> They get Yugi's VA for Yugi </br>  <br> part of her character is to be Soumas rival <br>He'll be clueless at first about how the Elites system works (getting massive funds and facilities and privileges) and Isshiki will instruct Erina to show him the ropes<br><br> Okay Nakiri-kun, you're in charge of walking Souma-kun through what it means to be an Elite <br> W-W-WHY askdflblkasdj <br> Cool, thanks Nakiri <br> BETSUNI <br><br>By the way the captcha is showing me bugs now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That actually would make sense as european idea of packed lunch is exactly the reason why Alice failed.<br>It's just the same dish you'd serve on a plate only placed in mobile container.</br></br></br>  <br> By the way the captcha is showing me bugs now <br>did you miss the news post? I'm back to typing in mailbox numbers again, no more fucking picture association.</br></br>  <br>They will do till 46/47 porbably, for that time Houjou, Nao and Akira had all made an appearence.<br>That would mean why they didn't foreshadow Giganigga</br></br>  <br>They aren't skipping it anyway. We've known it will be in the anime for weeks thanks to them tweeting about the karaage.</br>  <br>Her problem is that she would have served the exact same dish if asked to do a sushi dish.<br>Her grandfather commented on this, she didn't serve a bento, just food in a bento box.</br></br>  <br>He won prize money from a lot of contests. He probably had enough money to rent an apartment.</br>  <br>Was he winning money since middle school?<br>Actually, is the PSD even open for middle school students?</br></br>  <br>Megumi.</br>  <br>Tootsuki isn't that heartless to poorfags. They should have a bursary scheme or something to help them tide over their school fees &amp; miscellaneous stuff.</br>  I fucking hate poached eggs they taste like rubber  <br>Yes, Jun was in middle school when she was accepted.</br>  <br>Yeah, as long as you can pass Fumio's test, you're in.</br>  <br>Eat another type of egg then.</br>  <br>Jun was 74th generation student while Joichiro was 69th. So, yes for middle schoolers.</br>  What do you think the promise is between Yugi &amp; Eishi?  <br>I'm pretty sure every PSD besides Souma were in the dorm during middle school. They have their own shit so well figured out there is no way they just moved in.</br>  <br>ching chong ping pong</br>  <br> &gt;no experience in cooking before <br> &gt;get encouraged by one of these threads to make some of souma's food <br> &gt;try out the transforming furikake gohan <br>That's one of the hardest things in the anime, like hell you'd be able to do it with zero experience. You want easy? Chaliapin Steak Don (~10 dollars<br>), Gotcha Roast Pork (~9 dollars), or his Kaki no Tane fish (as little as six dollars)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's setup to be one of Soumas main rivals, and despite her initial promise of dealing with him, she has yet to act on it personally. Even if she has changed enough to forgo her promise, there's still a rivalry to develop. There's going to be a confrontation eventually, and a seat contest is a good battleground.</br>  <br>Yugi asks Eishi if he's still keeping/honoring his promise.</br>  <br><br>Eating raw eggs = salmonela<br><br>Also. Why do people call blondy a love interest? She just is annoyed with him. <br><br>Tadakoro is the only chance. Not even precooking classmate has one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we've moved past that stage whereby she wants him expelled. Subconsciously, she's perhaps 'waiting' for him to catch up to her, so that they could initiate their inevitable Shokugeki. Its still too early, but Souma's making such huge strides, it may happen before their 3rd year.</br>  <br> animeonlyfag </br>  Can't wait to see Souma getting saved by the cute loli.  <br> not wanting Rindou-nee to pop by to say hi &amp; give him tips to take down the manlet </br>  <br>I think he's talking about other cute loli.</br>  The semi-finals that couldn't be  ;_;   <br>Yes, in the anime.</br>  Kanon is the best little girl in SnS  <br>I'd rather see Alice in there, instead of that Italian jobber.</br>  <br>Will she appear in the festival?</br>  Wait, so you're telling me Dojima was carrying around an egg in his suit just he could show it to the students? And even if the egg was already in that podium, why is he showing them an egg? <br><br>These are culinary academy students. They probably already know what an egg looks like. Godamnit, Dojima.</br></br>  <br>Momo &gt; every fucking loli in SnS</br>  <br> inb4 Alice is female Takumi. </br>  I had a summer vegetable terrine for breakfast since the gelatin was setting overnight.  <br> Questioning Dojima  <br><br>Anon stop</br></br></br>  <br>Silly anon, it was an egg that fell from a nest and miraculously didn't break, he put it in his pocket and only used it as a prop for convenience's sake. He's going to take that egg home and warm it in his bed until it hatches and the next time we see him he will have a blue bird on his shoulder<br><br><br> not enjoying the dudefest </br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically, she is, since she jobbed pretty hard to Souma. In retrospect, I'd rather Souma face someone else, not her.</br>  <br>Probably the same one as Souma and Yugi. If he outsells Eishi he'll get a shokugeki.<br>It'll part of why Yugi will be so pissed off at Souma afterwards because Souma'll be stealing the customers he could be using to win over Eishi.</br></br>  Man, I can keep reading the Shinomiya Stagiaire arc and I just don't get tired of it.<br><br>Such a short arc, but it was fucking great.</br></br>  <br>I don't think its fair to term her that. She's arguably the top 4 cooks in her year, aside from Erina. I think the author handled her poorly. Her getting a 95 score, &amp; with her reputation, only to bow out so early due to her not fully comprehending the Bento theme, seems a bit weird &amp; illogical.</br>  <br>I really admire his ambitiousness if that's the case, but he may be biting off more than he can chew.</br>  <br>Alicefag please, it was perfectly reasonable for her glorified sushi boat to lose to Souma who made a groundbreaking bento dish.</br>  <br><br>It's not weird she didn't fully realize the theme. She's a rich girl who has shown little understanding of the plebeian world.</br></br>  <br>A dish that makes the colder Nakiri cry.</br>  <br><br>Thanks guys. Doing this as soon as possible.</br></br>  Were these two  playing videogames  all night long?  <br>because of best semen demon<br><br>S hinomiya </br></br></br>  <br>Every girl is female Takumi.</br>  <br>Yeah, Alice pretty much jobbed harder than Takumi. Jobbing to Giganigga is pretty likely if you don't prepare to face him. Alice fucked up. Takumi did not.</br>  <br><br>I don't think Erina would've made that mistake, had she been in Alice's shoes.</br></br>  <br>Alice is not relevant, sorry.</br>  <br>fuck meant for </br>  <br><br>This. Also  molecular gastronomy is a silly gimmick </br></br>  <br>Alice did not job. Alice lost. Takumi jobbed because the reason he lost was to show how strong and hard to beat Giganigga was. Alice had her own reasons for losing.<br>Jobbing =/= Losing</br></br>  <br>How many points would Erina get in preliminaries if she participated?</br>  <br>That's why he is best girl.</br>  <br>100, she's perfect in every way or some shit, I just know she'll do anything you want her to for some shoujo manga</br>  <br><br>All of them. All the points.</br></br>  <br>99, with the annoying cunt of a sister, because she's almost perfect.</br>  <br>I have to wonder. If Souma won the autumn election, would we still take Akira or Ryou seriously? Evidentaly no one takes Meat, Mimasaka or Alice seriously because they lost. Akira and Ryou couldve been just as displaced.</br>  <br>   playing videogames <br>Honestly, they seem like the kind of guys to be uninterested in  videogames. </br></br>  <br>Yeah, they played Cooking Mama</br>    <br>Curry twin would've Akirafagged her Erina score.<br>99 in the good block, 100 in the bad block.</br></br>  <br>Why not? The fandom is still taking the 'losers' seriously, so I don't think it'll make much of a difference. Besides, the margin between all 3 were incredibly slim, separated by Hayama's speciality.<br><br>In retrospect, I'd rather Souma losing, since he wouldn't have had the 'incentive' to break out of his Pop's shadow, &amp; we would probably never see what we saw at Shino's.</br></br></br>  <br> I remember Souma complaining that you can't bring game consoles into Hell Camp </br>  <br> I don't think Erina would've made that mistake, had she been in Alice's shoes. <br><br>obviously not, since she was just lecturing Souma about the proud tradition of bento before the match.</br></br></br>  <br> Takumi not being a morning person. <br><br>Muh heart.</br></br></br>  <br> It seemed more like a general observation but fair enough, I had forgotten about that. </br>  <br>Trip dubs confirm many games of Cooking Mama were played.</br>   Isami will beat Souma in Shokugeki to get Mezzaluna back to Takumi and at the same time becoming a man Takumi can support   <br>Isami probably has to dress and feed him every morning.</br>   Reading the manga <br> Thin as fuck Isami out of nowhere <br><br>If only I could lose weight that fast, maybe I'd go outside or something</br></br></br>  <br>It's summer fatigue. He gets fat again after the Election.</br>  <br>I want to button his bottom button, if you know what I mean.</br>  Now that I think about it, I actually made chocolate souffles for my birthday a couple of years ago.  The present was having sous chefs do all the prep work and cleanup.  While they did deflate very quickly, the richness and texture of the resulting flourless cake a few days later was lovely. Why didn't Souma take advantage of that?<br><br> I also made vanilla crème anglaise and a butterscotch sauce to drizzle over the souffles. Delicious. </br></br>  <br>Souma winning would be on par with gary-stu MCs. <br>I think it's best for him to have lost, it gave him a more worldly perspective, knowing he has competition from people his age, coming from similar or harsh situations, now he has rivals and peers in takumi, akira and ryou.<br>It's great, will definitely make for great Top 10 dynamics and banter.<br><br><br>The first kg are lost fairly fast, the problem is breaking into the &lt;20% body fat and staying there consistently.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I believe the other point implied in <br>is that they are both non-threats to Souma, despite their hopes.</br></br>  <br>Because in a buffet people just look at tons of food and choose the one that looks better.</br>  <br>Takumi is a non-threat to Souma.<br>Alice is a non-threat to Erina.</br></br>  <br>  Not taking a little bit of everything <br>Do you even all-you-can-eat?</br></br>  <br>That's a super neat present. I got something similar but not as involved when I was a teenager.</br>  <br> imagining Takumi stressing out over a shokugeki, drawing   MAN  on his hand and eating it<br> then Souma comes up and claps his hands together <br>I was not ready for this yaoi moment</br></br></br>  <br>It's like poetry.</br>  <br><br>No, because I'm not an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>That's why you only take a little bit. Or, if you have a multi-day stay, you try a few different things each day if there are enough to divide the sampling up like that.</br>  <br>I agree that Souma losing was best. A shounen MC winning his first tournament is rare, plus he needs some credible rivals for the first seat when Soumas in 3rd year and the senpais have left.</br>  <br>They should become threats for each other.</br>  <br>The problem many people had with that was Curry's 'specialty' which gave him the edge to win.</br>  <br>  Erina has super tongue <br>  Nikumi has super lips <br>  Hayami has super nose <br>What's the problem?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's completely fine, it's standard for antagonists to have an upper hand at first, the completely normal human MC then trains/learns or whatever and overcomes his problems, winning over his rivals in the end.<br><br>Plus, it makes it more believable, these people have had more training than souma, remember that his father taught him nothing, but these guys have experience + training + "special abilities". If Souma had won, I'd have thought that the manga was going to end soon and they were rushing it.</br></br></br>  <br>Erina and Nikumi are hot bitches with big tits, while Hayama is shitskin bishonen, See the difference?</br>  is Dojima a Grappler Baki character?  <br><br>I thought I was reading Attack on Titan for a second there.</br></br>  <br>It's all Tosh art, I don't see a need to differentiate.</br>  <br>Alice is a threat to Souma, she just didn't fully encompass the challenge. If she had actually made a bento she would have had a good chance to blow him the fuck out.</br>  <br><br>You guys weren't here for that shitstorm? Many felt the speciality reason was BS, &amp; argued Souma's creativity to be along the same lines as well. Then the 'power of love' trope was also brought up. Its was just a clusteruck of mess of semantics &amp; reasonings.</br></br>  <br> the 'power of love' trope was also brought up <br>Shoehorned in at the last second, no less.</br></br>  <br>Not really BTFO. She's around the same level as Ryou, &amp; Souma's around the same level as him, so I think it'll be very close.</br>  <br>but anon  we are all gay for shokugeki boys </br>  Be still, my throbbing dick.  <br>Hayama is really good looking so I'm not sure what point he was trying to make there</br>  <br>Maybe he has Utena PTSD?</br>  <br>Now that I think about it, given that the sense of smell is a significant factor in one's ability to taste things, does Erina have a really good sense of smell too or did the author just ignore that fact about taste?</br>  <br>I'm not.</br>  <br>not really. "For Jun" happens again and again throughout the elections. Along with comments like "If you smile at me that way, then I have no choice but to win"<br><br>Hayama is super blatant.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>Well, in my opinion people overreacted. Everyone had been shown to have a specialty, and besides his creativity they explicitly explained his shortcomings in the chapter. <br>The power of love was also there from the start. <br>The whole set up was there, but people were caught in pacing of souma winning strike against odds, like the giganigga one.</br></br></br>  <br> Having sleepovers with kids. </br>  <br> can't believe that one fucktard fell asleep during sex <br> and the other just kept the smug face throughout </br></br>  <br> three most popular SnS boys <br>They know what sells, huh.

I finally stopped lurking them around when the new Momohime was announced. Have there been any big announcements? </br></br>  <br>...Director?<br><br>And this chapter reminded me of something:<br>Tootsuki is also academy of tea ceremony. Tea ceremony shit when?</br></br></br></br>  <br> bikini figure <br>Call me when she gets a more interesting one.</br></br>  <br>While exercise helps a lot, simply eating less has far more of an impact in eliminating fatties.<br>Exercise is more for the transition from skinnyfat to fit.</br></br>  <br> Director. <br><br>wat.</br></br></br>  <br>Believe me, it's very necessary, especially for fatties. Not for skinnier people. And I mean just walking/running, not weights. You should put most of your focus on dieting, yes, but you NEED to exercise, even if it's in very small amounts like I said. You can do it with just dieting and see results, but the process is far faster when you incorporate exercise.</br>  <br>Read manga today, not even once, etc.</br>  I want to forcefully take away loli's plushie.  <br> Calories out &gt; calories in <br>Yeah, thanks for the clarification, that's what I meant.<br><br><br>This too, man. It's more your diet than anything else. Exercise definitely helps though.<br><br>But while you should be healthy and balance out macros, it's not teeeechnically necessary.

Quite literally speaking, you could get skinny and even get big and muscular living off of only Mcdonalds. But if you plan to actually be healthy, and/or cut a lot of fat while looking NOT like a sack on shit/flab or whatever, then it is necessary. But if the only goal for the time being is to cut all the fat first, then by all means, I would encourage eating like shit. It's more important to lose the fat first and look like a skinny sack of flab, which I've seen happen, than to fuck your body up trying to do it perfectly and end up looking like a bear.</br></br>  <br>Are they interesting?</br>    I want them to make a Italian Megumi sandwich.  <br>And that night Isami penetrated Megumi's not-wife-worthy pussy.</br>  <br> That slight but very apparent weld </br>  <br><br>I want an Erina action figure with working mandibles and specialty hair toss action.</br></br>   not even Souma thinks Alice-Kurokiba-Hayama is going to work <br>I hope the shop crushes under their weight.</br>  <br>I fucking hate eggs.

Thing is though, in an objective since, it's easier and you have more potential to get a really good looking body when you're skinny flat. It's closer to a clean slate. Bearmode is just hard as fuck to make work, and even when you do, it probably won't have as much potential.</br>   Cutting for a month <br> Cheat day today <br> tfw no dark skinned qt3.14 to feed me delicious protein to allow me to maintain my gains <br><br>Feels bad man</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'll bet Indian will be some kind of curry. <br><br>And I just read the Wikipedia article for Danish cuisine. That guy's going to be a total pushover. I didn't think there was a country with worse food than Britain.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice, wish we would see more of him not to mention Erina's parents.</br>  <br> Yes, he doesn't cook anything different, he just does it as a show. </br>  <br>Oh right.<br><br>Well one of Shino's employees seem like she's chink, so if she counts.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This would make Nikumi gush.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LYd<wbr>gR0VS774</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> not yamato nadeshiko </br>  <br>no<br><br>go away kebab</br></br></br>  <br>But Ryou doesn't look white, he has the same color as most others</br>  <br> that guy's going to be a total pushover <br> Should we tell him? </br></br>  <br>nut butter</br>   There are people ITT complaining about eggs in their breakfast <br><br> There are people ITT that eat breakfast at all <br><br> There are people ITT that eat more than one meal per day <br><br>Wow disgusting. Why aren't you like me and make only 1 meal. You only need to clean your pan once per day, I don't even use a dish, that would be 2 things to wash.<br><br>How can you live with yourself, eating t-twice or more in a day?<br><br> I wish I was joking. Other than my single meal I drink around 6 to 8 big cups of tea per day. nothing else.  I get really hungry at night but by then it's only 3-4hours until I go to sleep so I can stand it <br> I also cook a big meal on a pot that'll last me the whole week. I eat the same thing every day for that entire week <br> help </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Houjou more like Kanojo amirite</br>  <br><br>That's not kebab.</br></br>  <br> That guy's going to be a total pushover <br>Oh boy, you're in for a treat<br><br>  I didn't think there was a country with worse food than Britain <br>Oi fuck you, m8</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His father burned out his tastebuds at a young age</br>  <br>And none of the characters look Japanese</br>  <br> Italian jobber <br><br>That was a fucking good pun.</br></br></br>  <br>I was about to say Rindou but it turns out she has bright red hair</br>  <br>animu doesn't tend to do that. They could do it if they remain shadowed, but that anon suggested cameos of the actual elite 10. If they did that, they'd cast them for real.</br>  <br>Tea? Not water?<br><br>Also don't you wake up hungry? Wouldn't your only meal be breakfast?</br></br></br>  <br>There's a panel in the flashback where Alice decides to go to Denmark where he talks to her. You can only see part of his face though.</br>  <br>have that shit made by a knowledgable spic and mix it with rice<br><br>your farts are gonna be fucking toxic but it's worth it</br></br></br>  <br>Is she trying to distract all the guys in the kitchen?</br>  This has always bothered me but does Souma say something different at the end of matches between the anime and manga? I was so excited to hear "It wasn't much" but it hasn't happened yet.  <br>If they have lines they'd still have to cast them, unless they decide to change the scene.</br>  <br>I know, I want to see Senzaemon's kids in full.</br>  <br>You can't be this retarded. Hint: He has said it a lot of times.</br>  <br>"It wasn't much" is "Osomatsu". See </br>  <br>They have lines, you can see them on the page that was linked.</br>  <br>They should have saved the dress for the tournament, it's not like we can't tell who she is without it.</br>  <br> prioritizing weight over health <br>Anon, are you a girl? Or you have mental issues?</br></br>  <br>Are you poor, lazy or both? Are you constantly losing weight? Are you a ghost? You know there are other ways to satisfy your hunger while still saving money?</br>  Why is Shinomiya the best?  <br>Is this caramel and ice cream on top of fries?</br>  let's guess the 10 seats nationality  <br>Knowing what I deal in, I'd probably be good at pastries or salads. Swapping certain ingredients for olive oil or balsamic vinegar, giving me a large variety of sweet flavors and different textures.</br>  <br>In other words, you want an Erina barbie doll.</br>  <br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a Poutine, one of the staple Canadian vendor foods.</br>  <br>Neither. The point was if you're fat and desperate to lose weight, you hack. Ultimately you are healthier when skinny, so it's better to GET skinny and THEN worry about health after that. Mind you, that was only for the desperate who knew they couldn't lose weight any other way because they lack discipline or whatever. And no, me personally, I am not like that. This was my advice for fatties with the aforementioned problems. I cut work if it was hurting my health so thanks for you're concern but I'm doing okay.</br>  <br>Fucking kek'd.</br>  <br><br>So it is translated differently. Which is the correct translation? Or is it one of those "can mean two things depending of context"?</br></br>  <br>I want one for chopping vegetables.</br>  <br>Crunchyroll/Sentai translators haven't picked up on what's going on and seem to have translated it differently every time he says it.</br>  <br>I wake up at 12-1pm, make my coffee(mostly water topped with a bit of milk because milk is bothersome to buy and bring home, this way it lasts longer)<br><br>With the hot liquid in me I don't feel hungry, then I make the first 0,5L tea cup and get more hot water inside my stomag, making me feel full. I do my shit and around 5 to 6pm I eat my daily meal<br><br>After that I only drink more tea.<br><br>At around midnight to 1am I start getting hungry but I know I'll be in bed at around 4am to 6am so It's ok.<br><br>Rinse and repeat. the life of a recent uni graduate.<br>I remember when I started uni I'd buy those 2,5€ to 3€ pre-made microwavable meals. Now that I think back that's a lot of money. 5 to 6€ every day on food.<br><br>Nowadays I spend 10-12€ on ingredients for the big pot o'stuff which lasts 4 to 5 days, so it's much less money.<br><br>Then I'm a moron and whenever classmates come visit me we go to a nearby sushi restaurant which sets me back 8,5€<br><br><br>I have a slim face but I'm a bit overweight (girl thighs and some tummy). I'm not rich but I can afford more food. I'm mostly lazy and my body got used to the routine. Whenever I go visit my mom I'm really not used eating dinner, I'm simply not hungry by that time and find it weird<br><br>I'm not losing weight either. And please tell me how to satisfy my hunter while saving money, I'm serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some anon explained a while ago:<br><br> Actually, to be more precise, There is no correct translation of that term in English. <br> It's a Japanese tradition that doesn't even exist in the west.  <br> There are proper acknowledgements to having a meal. Like a greeting. <br> The served will say "Itadakimasu" = basically thank you for the meal, I will have them now. <br> Once they are finished eating, they say "Gochisou sama" = basically I have finished the meal, thank you <br> To which the server replies "Osomatsu sama" = You're welcome but no big deal, it wasn't much but it's the least I could do. <br> The closest equivalent would be "you're welcome" <br><br> As pointed out before, お粗末 (osomatsu) has the traditional Japanese humility and "it wasn't much" is as close as we get in English - in fact, it's a literal translation that happens to sound fine. "Happy to serve" doesn't sound as modest and the Japanese equivalent would be closer to 毎度あり. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I have a slim face but I'm a bit overweight (girl thighs and some tummy <br>That is most likely because of your dietary habits. Also I'm sorry but if that's your budget, I can't help. All I can tell you is that bananas fill you up quite well and they are cheap as fuck. So are pretzels. Canned beans and pita bread work too.</br></br>  <br>Get one.<br>I've found myself by mistake making a set of herbs that were supposed to be finely chopped a paste, because I enjoyed using the thing so much. It's very therapeutic</br></br>  <br>y-yes</br>  <br> Cleaning pans <br>Lmao look at this meido. I eat two meals a day and wash two cups and two utensils for it. Breakfast I drink two large glasses of breakfast smoothie and for lunch I make two PB&amp;Js on a paper towel so I can toss it into the waste bin next to my chair when I finish watching my show.</br></br>  <br>so he just got a Japanese name when he was "adopted" like Hayama?<br><br> his name was actually Ulf Surtursson, and Hayama's was something like Arjun Harishchandra </br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if it's not a shortening of Nakiri-san -&gt; Nattsan so as to make a wordplay on 'Summer' (natsu) though. Since it's written in katakana and not kanji+hiragana.</br>  <br> pita bread <br>Is very expensive compared to other breads<br><br>I'm a very good cook though, so I often make my own to accompany the big pot o'stuff<br><br>I very rarely snack, but I guess fruit is a cheap way to do so<br><br><br> and wash two cups and two utensils for it <br>Keh, and you think you're superior. Cleaning the blender must be a chore<br><br>You also wash your cups<br><br>Do you have any idea how long I've left my tea cup unwashed? The boiling water kills any bacteria anyway and the residual tea flavor only adds to it. It has layers of tea gunk.

Id watch sarada with dadruto tho  New trailer out?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Qyo<wbr>nn5Vbg7s</wbr>  [ ]<br>And apparently it's getting an Australian release so chances of a camrip are high.</br></br>  <br>I like him. He's a kid, and kids are assholes. Nurudu was always too naive and moralistic for my taste. It's refreshing that his kid is just kind of a douche.</br>  <br> youre an even bigger loser than naruto <br> s..sorry.. </br></br>     Gaiden is about Sarada being gay for Naruto <br> Movie is about Boruto being gay for Sasuke <br><br>Pottery</br></br></br>  My hype went down after last chapter. When are they finally gonna talk about if Karin is the mom.  <br> even has 2 whiskers <br>Boruto confirmed Naburo ripoff</br></br>  <br> S...sorry... </br>  <br> When are they finally gonna talk about if Karin is the mom <br>Next week, you fucking autist. It's the last chapter.</br></br>  <br>What? When was that decided?</br>  <br> Sarada being gay for Naruto <br> female being attracted to a male is gay </br></br>  <br>Obviously he meant she would go gay on his behalf - like she was going gay as a gift to Naruto or something.</br>  <br> Obviously <br> or something <br>Obviously he fucked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously</br>   Boruto is the combination of Naruto and Sasuke <br> Sarada is the combination of Sasuke and Sakura <br><br>And I always thought that Kishi's boner for Sasuke was an exaggeration</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you suck dicks you fucking breeder</br>  <br>Does that mean Sarada is both useless and edgy.</br>  <br>It was announced in this week's jump.<br>The preview even says that the chapter will have Salad graduating the academy, so either we'll have a few pages of MISUNDERSTANDINGS to clarify that Pink is the mom, or they'll answer it in the movie/never.</br></br>  <br><br>This.</br></br>  Freedom descending to Earth and kick everyone ass Best gundam moment ever  <br> Bold doesn't give a fuck about hokage rivalry  <br> Sarada btfo. </br></br>  <br>Why? Now she's running unopposed.</br>  <br><br>Not gonna happen. It's already confirmed that Bolt is a genius and in the trailers we see him do rasengan AND chidori. He's like a combination of Sauce and Naruto.</br></br>  <br>She tried to be but Daruto put an end to that post haste</br>  <br><br><br>I assumed her motivation to become Bolt's rival was because Sauce decided to train him rather than his own daughter. Would've made sense if Salad wanted to prove herself. Oh well, guess she just suddenly wants to be hokage although she didn't even care about being a ninja in the gaiden.</br></br></br>  <br>Show proof I never saw any of what you're talking about</br>  <br><br>So now she's just useless?</br></br>  I hope there will be a timeskip at the end of the movie. I want to see Salad as a young adult.  <br> so either we'll have a few pages of MISUNDERSTANDINGS to clarify that Pink is the mom, or they'll answer it in the movie/never. <br><br>Maybe they'll never say it, because they've already said it with the DNA test and Kishi is wondering why the fans want more exposition and doesn't even know about the retarded explanations for how Sakura is the mom.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Salad says she's going to be Hokage in the trailer <br> Burrito's reply is basically bitch did I say I wanted to be Hokage now shut your damn whore mouth </br></br></br></br>  <br>And it still only took one conversation with zero limbs lost in what was the last straw in Sarada's worst day of her life. Not to mention that she ended up loving mommy more than ever.<br><br>Her edge is nothing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Too early to tell. It worries me that she gets so little focus in the trailers. Yet, she is treated as the second most important character merchandise-wise. It would also be weird if she didn't have a big role in the movie despite the fact that the gaiden (which also promoted the movie) was exclusively about her.</br></br>  <br>After some hidden talk no jutsu and hard work yeah <br><br>I'd believe it</br></br></br>  <br>Has there been an useless sharingan user before?</br>  <br> Boruto isn't making cicada noises <br><br>0/10<br>You tried <br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/fSWDEXZdSoA  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nurudu pls go</br>    <br> implying this makes any sense <br>But Salad Has Two Mommies.</br></br>  <br><br>Has there been a useful female before? <br><br>It's 50/50 at this point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I assume most of them are fucking useless since they pretty much got massacred by one dude.</br>  <br> SaradaXKarinXSakura <br><br>The doujinchi artists need to hurry up.

I would rather be raised by Sakura and her identical twin than to be related to the edgelord at all.

You know Salad's fucked if he starts having Itachi flashbacks while training the little shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> who actually wants to see this kid getting anything that he wants? <br>That was basically the first show, with Naruto on his son's place. He got everything he wanted at the end, except for one little thing.<br> Not a shipperfag but if Kishi was a decent writer, this could be a good idea, the hero save the world but doesn't get the girl. No retcons allowed, just moving on like a functional human being </br></br></br>  Why is this series still going.  <br> implying Sakura was ever considered a major prize for him anyway <br>He valued Sauce's boipussy far more than he ever did Pink Shit's rancid cooch.</br></br>  <br>He did move on. He moved onto Hinata.</br>  The identity of Salad's mom really matter?<br>The girls are just glorified egg donors for Kishi's OTP</br>  <br> He valued Sauce's boipussy <br>He friendzone Sasuke harder than Hashirama did to Madara.</br></br>  <br>The Last did a poor job showing it. At least Kishi has the excuse of being an autist who happen to be a closeted homosexual. What's the writers's excuse?</br>  <br>That image is literally painful to look at. And I don't even like Naruto.</br>  <br>So how is Sasuke able to do jutsu without being able to do hand signs since he only has one arm?</br>  <br>And now nurutu and the sauce have a happy family together. Pinkshit is happy on her delusions and Kishi already forgot Hinata and her mini-me</br>  <br>Not anymore.

The only other sharingan user with Uchiha blood is Sarada. Do you think it has ever crossed his mind to breed with her once she gets older?  <br>He meant rebuild its honor.</br>  <br>The manga already showed him moving on.</br>  <br>that reminds me the Enver Pasha's last will<br>iirc last will was when he got killed he wanted his brother to marry with his wife and take care of his children<br><br>and his brother really did that heh</br></br></br></br>  What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny?

If the publishers think an anime increased the sales of manga, VNs, or merchandise, even if the anime itself sold badly, they will consider it a success.<br><br>Etotama was just a commercial disaster.</br></br></br></br>  Now my ears can rest in peace and heal from Nya's voice.  <br> Etotama was just a commercial disaster. <br>Exactly.

Mei-tan's devotion for Takeru goes a little too far and spooks the shit out of the Takeru-house residents </br>   that second left, top-most <br> ;_; </br>  <br>I just realized after posting, that was made by Nya-tan's VA.<br>She must have had fun voicing her</br></br>  <br>Where's this located?</br>  <br><br><br>Remember that Sol/Lull is basically concentrated niceness. Positive human emotions.<br><br>Takeru, being modern anime harem lead, is constructed at the subatomic level of nothing but 'nice guy' particles. He's a Superhadron Collider of Niceness energy./</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Harem <br>The only one that truly shows an interest in Takeru's reproductive organs is the Sheep and he tries to kick her out of his house in the manga</br></br>  <br><br>Every time I watch anime like this I always see the VAs having loads of fun to the point of crying when the show was over.<br><br>It's really sad, but heartwarming to know they had just as much fun voicing the anime as I did watching it.<br><br>for GJ-bu, Megumi's VA cried on her radio show because the anime was done ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br>   CG dance music video with all the characters in the last BD <br> Piyotan doesn't stop and go "wuhh" after three steps <br>IMMERSION RUINED<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5UK<wbr>fMF9vYjI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Hey, I just found the short episodes other than the 1st one.<br><br>http://www.youtube.com/playlist?lis<wbr>t=PLD5tew_NN2lHZ6GmqINYWunRaCOlXDAf<wbr>p</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> when VA's really had fun being part of an anime because it was probably their first time receiving such a significant role that isn't background character voices and they don't want their happiness to end. <br><br> When VAs want a S2 because then they'll be off searching for another anime to voice for and it'll be god knows how long until they land another spot like that. <br><br>For all intensive purposes, I guess it's a doggy dog world out there</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Cock spends most of her day sleeping in a fucking tree <br><br>You'll never look up and find a cock sleeping in a tree ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> episode 4 <br> 00:25 </br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Sheep is a closet yandere </br></br></br>  <br> then you realize Mei-tan have Takeru's house key without him even knowing <br>She's gonna rape him one of these days.</br></br>  <br><br>Mei-tan you're scaring me.</br></br>  <br>There's more than one kind of harem. A bevy of beautiful girls all living in around and with a single hapless guy. Even if most arent romantically interested, they interact with him in friendly ways, so to me it is still what I consider a Harem... I usually think of it as a viewer harem show.. or like a supporting cast harem?</br>  <br>Holy shit. <br><br>Mei-tan pls go and stay go</br></br></br>  <br>Mei-tan is lovely. How do I get a yandere sheep to obsess over me?</br>  <br><br>Mei-tan confirmed for sleeper best girl<br><br>Why the writers made a fucking episode about Takeru's cold and not this is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Sheep is scary.</br></br>  <br>Because they needed to provide a reason why an Eto-shin fell in love with a mortal, unless you want a slutty Sheep who falls in love at first sight with someone just because he looks good.<br><br>Also &gt;pic related</br></br></br>  <br><br> Mei-Tan <br> A healing specialist who delivers every possible therapeutic treatment. <br><br>I didn't realize death was a part of the treatment</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ass.</br>  <br>this took longer than it normally does<br>are you tired or something</br></br>  <br>Death cures everything.</br>  <br>You fuckers told me I was retarded for even suggesting that she could be a closet yandere.<br><br>Fuck every last one of you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Laid-back, easy-going, and soothing personality. <br><br>I'll never trust again</br></br></br></br>  I couldn't handle the lack of anime so I started watching the niconico talk show.<br><br>Jesus Christ, does Nya-tan's VA have sugar water flowing through her veins?</br></br>  <br>Who stole Uma-tan's nose?</br>   Finish show <br> Take nap <br> OP stuck in my head <br>It can't be helped.<br><br>This OP (and show in general) really grew on me.

I'm pretty sure that was stuck in my head as I was trying to get to sleep.<br><br>They're both great though. Fucking earworms  S2 never ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Wait, each VA sung the entire ED for an episode? I distinctly heard different voices as the camera panned across the cute sleeping divine messengers.</br>  <br>Got a link?</br>  <br> Are there full versions? </br>    man rat is kind of gay for cat<br>whats up with that</br>  <br>Thank you /a/, you glorious wizard.<br><br>That makes me wonder, are there more screenshots of that discussion/thread?</br></br></br>  <br>Search on YT for 干支ーク</br>  Where is muh blue moment cgi dance?    <br>I feel like that line of thinking always ends up with idiots running in circles while screaming "haremshit" or "fujoshit" at the top of their lungs every time there is an unbalanced cast of characters.</br>  <br>What discussion? That was just one post in a normal thread.<br><br>But there's this right underneath that post.</br></br></br>  It's a shame this did so poorly.<br>I guess the idea was that with a cast of 13 waifus the show couldn't possibly do poorly, but it did anyway.</br>  <br>Stop making everything sadder, the BD sales alone is bad enough.<br><br>I wonder why they're so afraid of Mei-tan just because she have the key. It's not like she couldn't just climb the wall and enter through the backyard's door.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you know that hole in his house that connects the two realms together.</br>  Is that the character designer who did Monogatari?<br><br>And why does the 3D look so amazing?</br></br>  <br> Stop making everything sadder <br>Think about all the effort put into making the CG models, and animating them.<br><br>Now think about how all these data are going to be stashed into some storage, never to be used again, and eventually deleted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or that. Seriously, Takeru's house is not that hard to break into.<br><br>Well fuck you too. I just got over this thinking that they're a big company with plenty of successful business before, don't bring me down again.</br></br></br>    Monkey and Dog are best boys.  <br>This.</br>  <br>Easily.

You unlock every Eto-shin to play as in new game plus runs, and no two Eto-shins have the same playing style.

Who is going to replace Mo-tan in the twelve eto-shin? Who was the person in black coat? And in general we got to see too little of all the Etos, second season when?<br> &gt;inb4 60 years ;_; </br></br>  <br>Will ever see actual scans of pic related girls?<br><br>Because most of them are stretched.</br></br></br>  <br> what is going to happen to Takeru and Sheep? <br>HE DOESN'T KNOW</br></br>  <br>Oh hell, I meant wild boars, thought pygmy is just a nickname for them.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_<wbr>boar<br>Anyways, I think wild boars are cuter (while they're still young) and are now fine thanks to them escaping and repopulating all around Europe.<br>Really, these little guys escaped from every damn place.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>If that thing tried to rape you, you would be d'awwing and squeeing for days.</br>  <br>If they were horny lolis they would be.</br>  <br>Boars are fine, but pigs that grow to be no bigger than housecats are going extinct, which is a shame.</br>  <br> Who was the person in black coat? </br>  <br>Well, it's a shame for them, but around 40 species are going near to extinct every year.</br>  <br>This guy got a nice argument, get rekt.</br>  <br><br>Iruka-tan or, wait, what noise does dolphin make?</br></br>  <br>Monkey, Dog, and Boar are best.</br>  <br><br>It's not rape if you want it.</br></br>  <br>Is there a cuter animal that boar?<br><br>boar is best</br></br></br>  <br>Posting babies is cheating.</br>  Death<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bKh<wbr>_13zOGFc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Rat just becomes good  <br> More potential for her character <br> Show ends <br> Season 2 never <br>Kill me now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe, but Uri-tan is a boarling too.</br>  I want to make my zodiac feel less lonely.  <br><br>I'm gonna grow up to be an unstoppable 800 pound engine of death</br></br>  <br> I'm gonna grow up to be an unstoppable 800 pound engine of desdes <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he was talking about Tiger there fella</br>  <br> SBR came from Sanrio <br>Ah, that explains it.</br></br>  <br>That face does not look trustworthy at all. As expected of a rapist specie.<br><br>I want to see Uri-tan communicate with a bunch of baby boars, it would adorable.</br></br></br>  <br>The things I want to see Uri.tan doing wouldn't be adorables.</br>  <br>the one who did tiger isn't even trying yet it's the best looking one.</br>  <br>We never even got to see any of the Etos conversing with their animals, I want to see Nya-tan talking with that cat popping up in a few episodes. Hell, I want to see ANY of them do that.<br><br> Maybe not Rat (though that can be replaced with hamsters) or Snake though. Or Dragon. </br></br></br>  <br>Would it be a crime?</br>  <br>Satan, stop asking questions you know the answers to</br>  <br>Satan, please.</br>  <br>Aye, seeing Uri-tan going Uri Uri Uri or Inu-tan going Wan Wan Wan would be the cutest. Nya-tan already say Nya so much that it wouldn't be any different than normal.<br><br>Just asking, I want to commit a crime on a messenger of god aswell.</br></br></br>  <br><br>what does tiger say? Gao? Is that more lions? Does that apply to other large jungle cats? Japanese onomatopoeia are absurd sometimes</br></br>  <br>Did she just nonchalantly insert a "DAISUKI" in the middle of a sentence?</br>  <br>My thumbs, her ass cheeks.<br>My tongoue, her anus.<br>Her feces, my throat.</br></br></br>  <br><br>did you not?</br></br>  <br> Inu-tan going Wan Wan <br>Didn't dogs go 'Inu Inu'?</br></br>  <br>No, she just said daisuki na more quietly.</br>  <br>Taiga make that noise that so yeah, It's probably Gao.<br><br>Inu-tan stop, you're doing it wrong. Wan wan are more adorable.</br></br></br>  dess dess~     everyone talking about the Mei-tan short <br>Personally I want to know what Shaa and Chuu were talking about and whether all the service shots had something to do with that</br>    <br>Man, mootykins has a H-doujin rod in there</br>  <br><br><br>Goddamn i love cock</br></br></br>  <br><br>yum</br></br>  <br>Best Etotama. Would be husband of to support her and our offspring.</br>  I want a game.  <br> Etotama version of No More Heroes <br>My dick.<br><br>Also, for whatever reason, the last couple of episodes of Etotama reminded me of Asura's Wrath. Probably because<br> Buddhism </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me to check the website.<br><br>Sure enough:</br></br></br>      <br> Nya tan likes to be picked uped unlike the other two that is midly annoyed. <br><br>Why is Nyatan such a slut.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mei-tan is so best jesus fucking christ</br></br>  <br><br>She'll probably the one to take Takeru's virginity, unless Snake slithers in first.</br></br>  <br>She's a Soll/Lull slut.<br><br>She would do anything to suck the magic out of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Am I the only one bothered how the Etotama's only gueard Japan? Aren't they a chinese concept?</br>  <br><br>The japanese took over the concept from China, but these are specifically japanese.

They did damn well considering the circumstances.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They did damn well considering the circumstances. <br><br>I wouldn't call 'literally worse sales than Kill Me Baby' a job well done.</br></br></br>  <br>Did SB69 have shit sales? That's probably of less concern than it should be considering the show also has the mobage to rake in money.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Etotama you idiot, read  again</br>    <br> Rabbit has only one leg </br>  <br>This actually reminds me of the time when me and my father found the remains of a dead wild boar behind my house. Apparently some guy caught one and butchered it the day before. He only left the head and some entrails. I can still smell the remains on my dog to this day.</br>  <br>Oh yes</br>  <br>That's what you get, for playing with sharks.</br>  Uri-tan is best cute  <br> Uri-tan is best cute <br><br>Why doesn’t anyone her horns?</br></br></br>  <br>Those are supposed to be tusks though.</br>  <br>There are clearly two there, just close together.</br>  Can you remember the whole name of the Tenchou Cup?  Dog and Monkey can be kawaii. They needed their own episode(s)  <br>So much love in just a few seconds.</br>  <br>golden part is a horn</br>  <br>you mean her ears, right?</br>  Anyone have a link to the Etotama music video that was posted a few weeks back, with all the characters dancing in Pretty Mode?  <br>This? </br>  <br>Ah, that's it. Wanted to listen to Uri-tan sing, she's good.</br>  <br>Might want to check out the Character Song Vol 2 then, Uri-tan's song is undoubtedly the best best in it</br>  <br>Ni ce music? <br><br> Because Etotama also had them </br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon, but nothing will ever beat drunk Shima-tan's ED.</br>   Cat takes Ox's place as an Etoshin (temp) to protect Ox's region until Ox fully recovers. <br><br>I guess that Nya-tan got what she wanted somehow</br></br>  Or she could have saved all the trouble and just gone to  Vietnam you idiotic mangaka   <br>Poor Usa-tan.</br>  <br><br>That's the face of someone who wants Nya-tan to fucking leave his home for christ's sake Jesus fuck</br></br>  <br>But Dora-tan's song is best on that album.</br>  <br>Also, either each Eto-shin's character song or an original insert song sung by the respective Eto-shin plays during every boss fight.<br> One of the levels close to the endgame would have you play as Mo-tan fighting Chu-tan, then Chu-tan's health is at 0.1%, her EDGE takes over and spikes it up to 1000%. That's when you take over and you mercilessly destroy Mo-tan. </br></br>  <br>I'm sure she'll manage.</br>  <br><br>muh dick</br></br>  I ended up really liking tiger.  <br>I ended up loving my zodiac, monkey.</br>  <br><br>I'm really fond of Dragon.</br></br>  <br>She is gggrreeat.</br>  <br>Monkey is my zodiac too but she and dog deserved another proper episode.</br>  <br>I don't hate dog.</br>  <br> another <br>You mean at least one.<br>They had great designs (though Monkey being adult woman height really surprised me) and should have made a funny episode if they focused on them.</br></br></br>  <br>Her thighs were not muscled enough. I want her to crack walnuts with them.</br>  <br>Man, I love Inu-tan. I just wish the anime shared my love for her. Yeah, Yeah, everyone loves Cock and Tiger, we get it; but the two cuties didn't deserve to get shafted entirely.</br>  <br>I'd give Kii-tan a good shafting.</br>  <br>I guess the problem lies with too few episodes and too many important characters that just scream for a bit of development.<br><br>I wouldn't mind a season 2.</br></br></br>  <br> I want to fond  le  the Dragon.<br><br>Fixed that for you.</br></br></br>  <br>She would scold you relentlessly. Perish the thought.</br>  I WANT TO DO  romantic  AND  consensual  THINGS TO SHIMA-TAN.  This still would have been better as several cours of shorts.  <br>Nah, a full length series is better than a bunch of shorts.</br>  <br>I want to see her growl like a tiger.</br>  <br>It was probably that they didn't have anything (personality/power wise) to offer to the plot, being slapstick characters (the baka trio). <br><br>Des des was the exposition character while Tiger was the intimidating master you had to overcome, so they spoke regularly.</br></br></br>  Explain to Piyo-tan why Etotama deserves a second season.    <br>Fun things are fun.</br>  <br>We sure do need those fixed for the next season</br>  <br>The girls are super cute.</br>  <br><br>Piyo-tan will get an actual episode dedicated to her that's not shogi</br></br>  <br>That could make a good desktop background.</br>  <br> Snake doesn't even care </br>  Who will mostly get the very first r18 doujin?  <br>Piyo has already doujin incoming.</br>  <br>After Piyo, Shima or Uma, Mo only if she's milked.</br>  <br>the only question i have is<br>will there be horsedick</br></br>  <br>Rat. Just maybe.</br>  <br>They should all be able to magically give themselves animal-cocks.</br>  <br> des des cork screw pork screw </br>  <br>Don't forget shit loads of seminal fluids and then they harden up.</br>  <br>Cocks have absolutely tiny cocks.<br>It might be a stretch to even call them cocks.<br><br>Still, I would play with Piyo-tans little nub cock.</br></br></br></br>  <br>niggers niggers niggers niggers niggers</br>  <br>pfft that krusty cuntflakes girl is 9.8/10<br>rapist cow is best</br></br>  Reminder. <br/>  <br>Reminder - https://<span>youtu.be/SR_lWAZTdyc  [ ]</br>  <br>Cute.<br>Also, look at these healthy thighs and hips. <br><br>Are you telling me you wouldn't a Sheep?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inu-tan kawaii</br>  <br><br>I want S2 to be more SOL-centered so we can see more interaction with the girls, but I do like the sexy CG action bits....</br></br>  <br><br>I want to live, thanks</br></br>  I want to do the annually shearing for Mei-tan  <br>To be honest, if she's really a Yandere she would be the very first Yandere I ever liked. <br><br>And I don't even like Yandere shit. <br><br>Maybe is just a joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there is a special place in every anons heart for the character they love despite usually hating their character type.</br>  <br>It really isn't.<br>Just look at the opening even on her frame and how her face is like with the syringe equipped.</br></br>   Some people thought this was a good loli design <br><br>I don't understand</br></br>  <br>Too bad they're ultimately wasted by A-1 normalfags.</br>  I am saving too many pictures of Kate and my loli folder is getting way too lewd.  <br>is the novel anywhere online yet,<br>last i checked noone has uploaded it yet.</br></br>  <br>They did loli SoL before they did any Typemoon stuff.</br>  <br> before <br>That would explain it.</br></br>  ITT: Good shows that everybody seems to have forgotten  Wolf's Rain  <br>One of the few shows I deleted after finishing instead of archiving. Felt absolutely zero desire to ever watch it again after seeing it once.</br>    <br>Hey fuck you man.  I forgive you. </br>  <br>You should of saved at least the last episode. The part where pink hair girl with that green hair guy being pulled together by that animal was the most hnng thing i've seen in anime. I still go back to it sometimes just so i can put a huge smile on my face.</br>    i wanted to forget... but now I remember everything vividly. man Toonami really took away my childhood with FLCL and Eureka 7  <br> everybody seems to have forgotten <br> Eureka7 </br></br>  <br>funny thing, this show probably has the most realistic approach to relationships. Through the eyes of the MC, we saw how the crew and ultimately the girl grew into this family bond.<br><br>The last half of the show is stretched too far IMO but otherwise it was a satisfying ending.</br></br></br>  <br>The movie and sequel soured a lot of people.</br>    <br>I still haven't watched AO. I read so many bad things that I'm scared to ruin my memories</br>   Everybody forgot the fansub fiasco surrounding E7   <br>What happened? I wasn't around at the time</br>  <br>It's actually kind of amazing.<br>Not only is it a bad sequel, but it actually makes the first series worse by establishing that  Renton and Eureka's first child dies and any more children they have can never live in their world.  Way to turn the original ending into a total fucking downer, Bones!<br><br>So yeah, don't watch it. Actually, don't read that spoiler either. You're better off that way.<br><br><br>I never forgot.<br>They sat on those fucking scripts for months.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ray and Charles were the only good things about that show.  wasn't bad too I suppose, but holy fuck was toughing out the show not worth it.</br>  <br>   <br> Seven guesses and no one has realized it's Eureka <br>I was going to make this thread myself if you hadn't beaten me to it.<br><br><br>It was mediocre at best, outside of the GOAT OST.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Probably one of my favorite shows but that might be because I'm half BR and I love brown girls and girls with sass.  <br> tfw Manglobe is kill </br>  Detective Conan, Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V(actually a really flippin' good season, I don't care for the ones before it.), Hyperdimension Neptunia, Hentai Prince and the Stony Cat.<br><br>These are a few I don't hear people mention anymore that are great.</br></br>  KIMI DA YO  <br> Arc-V <br>That ended?<br><br>The Nep anime was never really a big thing outside of the pre-existing fanbase.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Conan <br>I guess that's because is one of that never ending shonen. But still, you are right I almost never see Conan here.<br><br> YuGiOh <br>Aren't threads of the new season still going? Idk if they talk of the past season but they could do it.<br><br> Nepu <br><br><br> Henneko <br>I think was fun with /a/ but alone that show was mediocre.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_bi<wbr>TwsOOhKk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>maybe i was the only one who liked this show?</br></br>  Kannagi  <br> maybe i was the only one who liked this show? <br>you have to be a new fag not to like this show</br></br>  <br>s2 was too god</br>  <br>but that wasnt even the last episode.</br>  <br>I dunno that I felt that show flew under the radar even as it aired. It was alright though.</br>  <br><br>Oh please, if only I could forget watching that garbage.</br></br>  <br>Why did you watch a 50 episodes series if you didn't like it?</br>  <br>The same reason why he's here anon.<br>He lost his reason to live to he tortures himself with shit shows.</br></br>  Whenever anyone discusses Yuasa's works, no one ever mentions Kemonozume.  <br>but it was a good show :(</br>  <br>You are an idiot. The original ending was that she had to separate herself into 7 parts and scatter them IE she has to die. <br><br><br>Get with the program.</br></br></br></br>    <br>What the fuck are you on about</br>  <br>For some but for others it is horse shit anon.<br>There are those who would want vanilla ice cream but hate mint and those who like mint but hate vanilla. The faster you learn that you have vastly different taste the better time spent watching shows that you enjoy.</br></br>  <br>That's probably because the story didn't hit home like the rest of his stuff does. <br><br>I didn't think the story was really all that great, but it is the single greatest showcase of deranged animation I've ever seen.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably my least favorite Yuasa show. I still enjoyed it, but that show was a mess.</br>  <br>This will always have a place in my heart. God OST, best girls.</br>  <br>Nah man, worst Yuasa was by far Kick-Heart.</br>  <br> God OST <br>Good that someone reminded this</br></br>  <br>Arc-V ended? I thought that was the most recent series. Pendulum formats seem like they have a couple years left.</br>  Ping pong      No one talks about Chinese Electric Batman anymore.  <br>Too edgy for today standards</br>  <br>That ED is god tier shit</br>  <br>Shame, too. I love Chinese Electric Batman.</br>  <br>But the edginess is totally justified. It doesn't come out of nowhere for shock value and to make characters "seem" cool.</br>    <br>Probably because the show was kinda a trainwreck.<br><br>I still don't know what the mess of the 5 ending episodes were all about.</br></br></br>  <br>Good. It's mediocre and deserves to be forgotten.</br>  <br> implying i havnt watched eureka 7 four times in the last 2 years </br>  havent seen much onizuka  <br>I wish I could find more of the manga</br>  <br>Liked the manga more honestly. I couldn't finish the anime</br>  Pls guys.  One of my favourite anime from last year.  <br> You should of <br>How the FUCK do people keep making this mistake?</br></br>  nice subtle rec thread    <br><br>Did you miss the weeks of hype and near-daily threads because of that fucking cat that still won't go away?</br></br>      <br><br>These were shit.</br></br>    <br>I'm always surprised that there isn't more talk about this show. I guess since it was short and there's not a ton more to say about it.</br>    <br>Welcome to summer. Where there are even more shitty rec threads than normal</br>    <br>This is probably the least awful rec thread I've seen in ages, to be fair.</br>    <br>It's still a rec thread that doesn't belong on /a/</br>    <br>Then delete it</br>  <br>Greatly enjoyed the manga. Waiting for the next chapters. I'd really love another season of it.</br>      <br>My little brother loved this show. But he also thinks Brotherhood is better than 03.</br>  <br>Ever so slightly impossible seeing as I'm not OP</br>  <br>Then you should listen to his opinion.</br>    <br>I never see it talked about.</br>  How could they forget the comfy classic.  <br>Re-Watched lately, still hilarious.<br><br>It'd be nice if there was an /a/nime club for streaming these old shows... not at ridiculous american times too.</br></br></br>  <br>best romantic comedy in my eyes <br>but the ending <br>why do best girl(eri) never win ??</br></br></br>  <br>totally awesome ost<br>10710</br></br>  <br>i liked the show <br>but fuck man he should be in prison that perv</br></br>  <br>Tried to watch it a few times, I get about ten seconds into the OP and then see robots on flying surf boards</br>    <br> the kids never forgetti <br> katana to throat never forgetti </br></br>  <br>that ending of the first episode <br>hit me like a train</br></br>  <br> It's actually airing on Toonami, so you might see a popularity boost. </br>  <br>Because PIE</br>  <br>I'll never forget.</br>  <br>IT'S ART TIME</br>  <br>this is eternally backlogged for me. don't plan on watching it in the next year either</br>  <br>oh god<br><br>just scrolling down the page and seeing this made me a little depress.</br></br></br>  When was the last time you ate Chicken Casserole, /a/?  <br>Naw</br>  <br><br><br><br> tfw already nostalgic for these </br></br></br></br>  <br>I see Kurenai in every one of these threads. Can we somehow officially crown it "The Show Everyone Remembers But Everyone Thinks No One Else Remembers?"</br>  <br>It dropped the ball after several episodes, so it's understandable. The potential was great though.</br>  <br>She's so cute. New OVA at some point  but S2 never </br>  <br> streaming </br>  <br>Definitely one of my all-time favorites.</br>  <br> The cat is still there <br><br> my_sides.jpg </br></br></br>        <br>the only good shonen</br>  <br>and thats about it.</br>  <br>HARRRRRRRRYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY YOU BASTARDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD</br>  <br>  good show </br>  <br>It is legit Murrican grammar.</br>  <br>KILL CASHEWS<br><br>DEVOUR CASHEWS</br></br></br>    Kamichu. Windy Tales.  <br>Was about to say GunGrave. Then this came up. Now im fucking sad. GGWP.</br>  <br>We had a thread yesterday you fag.</br>  <br>Probably because it was so hyped up and well received when it was airing, and it completely disappeared afterward. Not even in any essentials or recommendations, nothing. It was loved but all of a sudden it dropped off the face of the planet. It's really weird.</br>  <br>tried to watch this recently but the humor was pretty outputting for me<br>i like the main girl and  the tranny  but the other characters were one-gag annoyances</br></br>  <br> already <br>Michiko to Hatchin was eight years ago, that's fair nostalgia game if you're in your twenties.</br></br>  <br>o, have another one<br>5 shows you can pick from. have a good one.</br></br>  <br>seriously one of the best comedies in my opinion<br>the first season is a bit rough maybe but boy does it get good</br></br>  <br><br>What do you mean? People are STILL talking about Firefly</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, that's the stuff. Too bad next to nobody cared about this show back when it premiered.</br>  <br>Still in my backlog. I liked Rokka no Yuusha, written by the same guy, so I figure this might be worth getting into.</br>  ITT: A lot of people who have no idea what forgotten means.  <br>I watched that series of episodes 2 weeks ago and haven't touched it after they died. So much more interesting than anyone else in the show.</br>  <br><br><br>You have beautiful tastes in Korean Cartoons.</br></br></br>  <br>Even worse, half of them don't know what "good" means</br>  <br>Fuck the movie, the manga and Eureka AO.<br><br>Why make complementary material that only shits on the purpose of the original series?</br></br></br>  <br> being a streamfag <br>Go back to reddit</br></br>  <br><br><br>What do you think the anime community on /a/ can do to stop people from streaming cartoons?<br><br>I don't think telling them to go back to Reddit and using greentext is enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing I can think of is updating pic related. While it still has some good arguments, admittedly some of them no longer apply. Maybe add something talking about how resolution=/=quality and streaming sites have shit tier bitrates</br>  <br>It takes 10 hours to stream a 2gb file where I live, so fuck off.</br>  <br> stream <br><br>I meant torrent</br></br></br>  <br>You're either using torrents with no seeds or you have shit DL speed. If the first, that's easily fixable. If the second, streaming would be just as gimped as downloading episodes. So your argument is shit either way</br>  <br>Shit DL speed. <br><br> streaming would be just as gimped as downloading episodes.  <br><br>Jesus christ your dense. Shit quality == faster stream. Sucks but it's the only way I can enjoy my chinese transexual cartoons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't you download them before time? Besides airing show you can just store a lot of shows in a hard disk, doesn't matter if takes 2weeks to donwload it, you'd watch it a year later anyway</br>  I gave up to start these threads long ago.  the sequel and movie do not exist  You try making a Bakuman thread and it dies with five replies at best.  <br>streaming prevents you from being FBI'd</br>  <br> tfw the only thing that will be remembered of this anime is the porn flash that Zone made.  <br>  I still fap to it.  </br></br>    <br>Such a good show, I miss it</br>  <br>This was a good show. The dinosaur episode was the best.</br>  <br>KYASHANG</br>  <br>It's not at the same level, but I did really enjoy it.</br>   tfw no in depth plot discussion   What was the name of this anime which OP was like:<br><br>"[spanish guitar intensifies] SONANDARO, SONANDARO, SONANDARO"<br><br>It was somethin about a village and people with super powers using giant pokemon to fight each other. It was 13 episodes, cute blue haired loli.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamisama Dolls. I really enjoyed it, as well.</br>    <br><br/></br>  <br>Funnily enough, that was the first show I ever watched. The shota rape turned me off anime for a while.</br>  <br>The first 13 eps were shit, but the rest was pretty damn good. Shame AO ruined the original series' reputation.</br>  <br>That show is horrible, gave one of the most negative anime experiences ever.</br>  <br>it happens on occasion. That said the mystery has faded as we got more info from the director</br>  <br>Disappointing to read. I was hoping that it would be better than the first movie or that god awful Blood-C.</br>  <br>So do DDLs. Or common sense.</br>  <br><br>Despite how absolute shit this anime was, it sure gave rise to 2 of the greatest OP, especially the 3rd one.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gaw<wbr>xOIDk1NQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ojk<wbr>vQzWBpsA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Papillon best shounen-villain-turned-friend.</br>  <br><br>OP you have shit taste.

More too the point, which Stands do the Same things?</br>  <br>Good thing it's a unicorn</br>  Im reading part 7 and I have to say that I love the fact that despite how Pocoloco is consistently at the head of the pack, he's just some dumb nigger literally listening to the voices in his head  <br>I thought he still had that piece of spine? That, or the corpse awakened his potential. Did the President have a stand before collecting the corpse?</br>  <br>His stand is luck based, if you hadn't noticed. It's actually the first appearance of a stand in SBR.</br>  <br>40% of the time, Pocoloco's stand works all the time.</br>  Robert E. O. Speedwagon continued with his various enterprises and helped to further science and medicine. In 1952, he died of a heart attack at age 89. He remained single.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oIl<wbr>iLtU3PTE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  So which Jojo Artbooks should I purchase?  <br> here lies speedweed <br> he never scored </br></br>  <br>Valentine took all of them. There are Stands in Part 7 that don't originate from Corpse parts if I remember right. I don't think In A Silent Way or Tomb of the Boom came from Sandman or the Boomboom Family having a Corpse piece, so maybe enough exposure to either pieces or Devil Palms enable the use of Stands without them.</br>  <br> Killer Queen <br> The Spin in general <br> Bohemian Rhapsody can probably do something similar <br> Diver Down <br> No idea <br> Yellow Temperance? <br> No idea <br> Atum? <br> Atum as well? <br> Rockmen? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why no other part did this?<br><br>Feels less complete.</br></br></br>  <br> and "I win" <br> loses against diego </br></br>  So I've been reading the manga because I finally thought that I should see what all the fuss is about.<br><br>I've started part 5. <br><br>My question is, does the plot ever get better than "let's fight a bunch of one-time stands, learn every infinitesimal detail about how they work, and then never see them again (because we killed or otherwise incapacitated the user so they're no longer relevant)"? I liked parts 1 and 2 a lot, but starting at part 3 and the introduction of Stands I started to feel this way. <br><br> Also, I'd just like to say that while I enjoyed him, I feel like Dio's popularity is way overblown compared to his actual screentime, especially Part 3 Dio. The last part/final fight of Part 3 was very anticlimactic.  <br><br>I think I might watch the anime, maybe seeing things animated and in color would make me more hype about things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Missing ones were Spice Girl and the Pillarmen.<br>Oh and mind read could be Hermit Purple as well</br></br>  So if Dio decides to masturbate, does he end up jerking off or does he end up giving Johnathan a handjob?  <br>If you can't get used to the one-off stands, you probably won't enjoy the rest of the series.</br>  <br>its just jonathan jerking off with dio watching</br>  Post your favorite pose  <br>It's not so much the fact that they're one-off stands, really, so much as the fact that the comic spends so much time going into detail about the exact way their powers work. Literally pages and multile chapters dedicated to it. Hell, half the time the user is the one monologuing that shit directly to whoever they're fighting.<br><br>It's really like that the rest of the comic? Maybe I should quit, I dunno. The Italian gangster stuff in Part 5 has been sort of interesting so far, I'll probably at least finish off Part 5 I guess.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes, it's more or less the same flair.<br>Stand fights are more or less puzzle fights. They each have their own rules that need to be explained as their powers become more and more abstract. Part 6 has a lot of abstract stands.</br></br>  <br>It's a fighting manga. The whole point is to create situations that the protagonists struggle to resolve by brain and brawn. In a lot of ways Jojo is entirely responsible for the modern shonen "overcome all odds with my friends" genre. I can see why it'd become dull, the writing has never really been it's strong suit. I like it for the art.</br>  <br>part 5 also has an ass translation for a majority of it (thankfully the pace of the re-translation is picking up). Like, if duwang was bad because the translators didn't have the best grasp on english, the old part 5 translation is bad because the translators don't have the best grasp on japanese</br>    <br>It's been 100 years, the body is DIO's now.</br>  <br>The art is definitely part of what keeps me reading. The art in Part 4 started to get a bit more "generic" in my opinion, and I suddenly realized in part 5 that no one can do anything without posing like they're on a fashion magazine cover, but it's still beautiful to look at (weird hair and clothing aside). <br><br><br>Part 4 was absolute hell for me to get through because of that. Even besides the Duwang shit, I recognized two absolutely unnecessary references to Homestuck in the translation that made me pissed because if you throw in shit like that, how am I supposed to be able to trust your translation at all?<br><br><br>The fact that that body can produce a Joestar would indicate otherwise to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the fuck?</br>  ITT: We post JoJo songs<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e0q<wbr>3lby5bDQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Wait, what were the homestuck references?

All of it!"<br><br>And then, when the alien guy was introduced, Okuyasu was trying to think of the word for crop circles and called them "lawn rings." They were pretty close together too, and that's what made me sure of it.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VvM<wbr>FhYMVawk</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>PB had no damn characters left that weren't in future parts.<br>SC had the same problem, Jotaro, Joseph, and Pol are all in future parts.</br></br>  <br>They had a different translator near the end, so that's why that happened so close to each other.</br>  <br>Well, then its your fault for reading homestuck then.

Save the celebration for after we get out of here!<br><br>Joseph: All right hang on tight</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My sides hurt.</br>  I want to clean the space between Karera's toes with my tongue  <br> Earlier <br><br>I "applied" last month, I didn't actually help them out this month though.</br></br></br>  <br>Why did Karera think Gappy is Josefumi when they dont share any physical traits?</br>  <br><br>I mean context.</br></br>  <br>Kira is also a Joestar, that's a well known fact, his star is just hidden in this picture<br><br>Josuke is the fusion of two Joestars</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she's Okuyasu's counterpart.</br>  <br>What did you apply for? <br><br>She loves him<br><br>Incest shit right there</br></br></br></br></br>  So I assume these guys are Gappy's next foes  <br>1: They do<br>2: She appears to be the yukako to josefumi's koichi (tho she also appears to be a bit more mellow) so she's obsessed enough with him to pick up on things sooner than other people</br></br>  <br>How is it incest?</br>   tfw we finally have a JoJo   AU Sticky Fingers?  I need your help to find a song<br>Years ago someone posted a song, it had a pretty old time and classy style, that was all about a man who killed a girl and kept her hand to himself because it was pretty, the lyrics had a part like "I wish the rest of you was here too" I don't know.<br><br>JoJo readers went mad about how much Kira had in common with this song. Please, if you know the song, giveme the name.</br></br></br>  <br>Josuke has kept four balls with him all the times he remember.</br>  <br>Cleaning and/or typesetting. You probably were able to all 3 but I assume you did translations, right?</br>  <br> They do <br>like what?</br></br>    I want to gabo gabo Karera.  <br>I've done translation, cleaning and QC in other groups before, but they didn't need any help in translation and I'm currently not interested in doing cleaning so I'm QC (and resident punmaster) there.</br>  <br>No, unless those two cops have stands</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vAV<wbr>xW5uoQe8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I still think this song really was Araki's inspiration for Kira</br></br></br></br>  <br>similar appearance (plus kira and josefumi appear to be related, explaining why a fusion between the two could be easily mistaken for one or the other)</br>  Fuck, I hate JoJolion. Every chapter opens several more questions.    <br>they dont look alike at all</br>  <br>Really piss me off.</br>  Sinve Araki moved to Ultra, JoJo became more sexual than ever.  <br>I wonder how lewd part 4 would ave gotten with Yukako if it was in Ultra<br>Or part 5 with Trish</br></br>  Whoa, these two football guys have quite a unique power I haven't seen before in JoJo. As for Karera, her power won't protect her from these guys unless she has more abilities we haven't seen yet.  What does karera's stand do exactly? I didnt understand it.<br><br>Also no more jo2uke or gappy. Now its Josefumi time</br></br>  <br>And less gory and violent.</br>  <br>I hope all four fight together.<br>I loved that part 5 had all those tag battles.</br></br>  Man Eyes of Heaven is such a fucking bummer<br>I mean the fact that it'll only be ok at best just makes me wish they were putting the effort into making a sequel to ASB that plays like HttF</br>  <br><br>And let's not forget part 6 with the gang of prison sluts</br></br>  <br>Something is telling Yukako would have hug Koichi really her against her breast or Okuyasu watching some girls teets.</br>  <br>really, to me it looked like a mix of nut king call and that stand that switches items in the user's hands from one of the novels, unless I was looking at it wrong.</br>  <br>Show some respect! I liked Miraschon and Gwess.</br>  <br>That pirate joke actually made me laugh, shit.</br>  <br> Less gory and violent <br> Pucci's death <br> Wekapipo's death </br></br></br>  If the kanji for Josefumis last name is the same as Jotaros then why did they spell it differently? Just trying to be more correct or what?<br><br><br>QC? You mean typesetting or what?<br><br><br>Well at least it doesn't look as trash as it did in the first demo. I know what you mean though, real jojo fighting game when</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One guy can switch body parts with another by touching. The other can teleport other objects and materialize them from his hand. Both are rock related.<br><br>These are very dangerous people.</br></br></br>  Wow can't believe I didn't notice that white sailor outfit is just a reference to Jotaru "Autism" Kujo's aquaman fantasies.<br><br>Man I'm slow as a motherfucker</br></br>  Kira doesn't look anything like Kira.  So Gappy's other half is called Jose?  <br>Part 6 was in Weekly Shounen Jump. I'll give you Wekapipo's death though, even if it's just kind of more gruesome that Shigechi's death.</br>  <br>Tripfag pls we all read it 3 days ago </br>  <br>Josef</br>  <br>QC as in quality check, it's like an advanced type of proofreading where you "proofread" every step of the process, the cleaning/redrawing, the typesetting, the translation, the entire result, and then at the end pronounce the work ready for release (though every scanlation group allocates QC work differently in my experience, some require the QC to actually go and fix every mistakes he finds himself, others just want you to tell them what you find wrong and they'll fix it themselves, etc). It requires extensive knowledge of all steps involved in scanlation and you have to be available a lot for discussions with the staff etc, but I like doing it because I'm a nitpicker that likes telling people how they did things wrong. But if there's still typos and shit in the end release, it's my responsibility so that's that.<br><br>I know, but it's still more satisfying to read it on nicely cleaned and typeset pages instead of dirty raws with a script on hand. And judging from the reactions, many people avoided reading it that way and instead waited for the full release.</br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br> Wekapipo <br> Shigechi <br>damn feelings</br></br></br>   Jojo parts described in one sentence: <br><br>part 1: downtown abby with vampire, sunlight kungfu, and the titanic<br><br>part 2: ancient homosexual aztec vampire gods get trolled by british human bugs bunny<br><br>part 3: A jap, his gramps, a muslim, a metrosexual, and a frenchman all hunt down a british vampire banana man on the other side of the world<br><br>part 4: a quiet town has a fetish murderer, manga artist, and a couple of characters up to no good, while a gang of school kids hustle niggas left and right.<br><br>part 5: a group of gay fashionistas seek to find their pink hyena leader to save his daughter<br><br>part 6: women go to prison with a 10 year old boy while a gay black catholic priest ends the entire universe for his deceased gay lover<br><br>part 7: Paraplegic and an aspiring Italian comic race across america to find the corpse of jesus christ and kill the president while dinosaurs wait for them at every turn<br><br>part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As part of the JJCA crew that does Part 5, QC is kind of split between me, the typesetter and part-cleaner, and another person who proofreads and does the rest of the cleaning. It's kind of hard to check for translation errors when you don't know a lick of Japanese and have to check the raws for proper punctuation, sentence length, and names being said.</br>  How will "grow hair where you touch after I touch you" beat "teleport things that I touch elsewhere?"  <br>It's actually a reference to doppio's sailor fantasies</br>  Post images that would really confuse people who don't read JoJo.      <br><br>That's why it's best for QC to also have at least cleaning/typesetting knowledge and translation skills. It's much easier to work with a small group of staff where everyone has one or two jobs than a big group where the work is split up awkwardly. Sometimes those kinds of groups can't be avoided of course, but it's still favorable to avoid them as much as possible.</br></br>  <br>Took me until I read part 8 to get this (obviously) but I would see it in threads and have no clue what it meant</br>  <br>Fuck me, how did I miss that?<br><br><br>Alright then. I noticed there are two cleaners so I might go for typesetting though I know the guy is picky about typesetting. idk. I should probably redownload skype.</br></br></br></br>  <br> What does karera's stand do exactly? I didnt understand it. <br>It's pretty straightforward.<br>It makes a person's hair grow in the spot she makes the person touch. She can't make it grow herself and the hair disappears when she's not in the area.<br>A pretty shit stand even worse than love deluxe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah.. SBR was pretty damn violent. Some of the deaths were really gruesome, like leaving the Boom Boom brothers to bleed out in the desert and Diego becoming half the man he used to be.</br>  <br>saved</br>  This chapter was too lewd for me.  <br> part 1: downtown abby <br> downtown abby <br> downtown </br></br></br>  Karera and her stand are fucking disgusting.  <br>I don't find the typesetting hurdles to be higher in HWMN than in other good groups? And we already have a typesetter anyway, but recruitment is kewls job so I guess you should talk it out with him.</br>  <br>Damn it, she's kind of cute in a trashy way.</br>  <br> How will "grow hair where you touch after I touch you" beat "teleport things that I touch elsewhere?" <br>So Autumn Leaves ver. 2 vs downgraded Love Deluxe</br></br>  <br>Maybe if they came out at a reasonable pace it wouldn't be so bad. We basically got one large plot development and now we have to wait another fucking month to figure out who the new pillarmen are.</br>  <br><br>Dat Spaghettimind</br></br>  <br> brb about to edit Karera sucking Gappys dick  i'm gonna color him black too <br><br><br>She's geniune "white" trash<br><br><br>Kewls the guy I emailed and stuff about it, he told me himself that he's really picky with it and tries to replicate the japanese fonts to english fonts.</br></br></br></br></br></br> </br>    <br>Yeah, but the fonts are already picked for this series so you just have to use the ones we allocated for it.</br>  <br>wtf happened with my spoilers? I only meant to put it on the first reply</br>  <br>It's only me, NearZero, and Daxing Dan that's working on Part 5 at the moment. Checking for translation accuracy's a bitch when Daxing Dan isn't available all the time.  And you know how people here love to complain about the old scans. <br><br><br>Still won't beat Part 6 in those departments though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're disgusting.</br>  <br>It's pretty sad to think about her reaction when she will find out that her loved Josefumi is dead</br>  Give me some good panels for black Gappy from the new chapter, I can't decide which to use.  <br>After he moved to ultra, Araki become so lewd.</br>  <br>Actual sex scene when?</br>  <br>There isn't much holding him back now</br>  <br>He's got a great character that is mangled by the scans because he doesn't have quirks blatant enough to make it through the shit translation.</br>  <br>Is that where he's holding the fruit?<br>Which reminds me, where is Tsurugi? Didn't he want to take Josuke to see the fruit that's at the stadium but Karera whored up and now he's mia</br></br>  <br>You say that like you want to hire me  I'm available </br>  <br> It's pretty sad to think about her reaction when she will find out that her loved Josefumi is dead. <br>Just wait until she found her loved Josefumi has a good double pair now.</br></br>    <br><br>I want a sex scene like the Casca and Guts in Berserk.<br><br><br>I have your Skype so I'll contact you from there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who took the photo?</br>  Yasuho rape when  <br>Isn't disassembling and reassembling things literally just Crazy Diamond?</br>    <br>Now i want to eat a rock.</br>  <br>Diego is so lewd.</br>  I still can't like Josuke, almost 50 chapters and I can't like him. Is he really going to be the worst jojo?  <br> part 8: Araki just shows us all his fetishes. <br><br>Why is part 8 so lewd?</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's a selfie, that was in her old phone too.</br>  <br>I cracked up when he spit one of those at Valkyrie later after that, because I read with Koyasu's voice.</br>  HERES A TASTE OF THA REMEDY  <br> part 7 anime <br> koyasu voices diego, and it's recognizably his voice, but has a different delivery <br> alternate diego with the world is the same ham that we know and love </br></br></br>  I really want Araki to make a hughe, big, like enormous and fat stand. Would be so lewd but JJL deserves all the lewdness that Araki can draw.  <br>Oh look, it's this faggot again. It's like every newcomer to the series is reincarnated from the last.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lRl<wbr>9Av95Uck</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>My favorite song and album from the JoJo namesakes</br></br></br>  <br>He's such an asshole to Yasuho as of late.

Joseph had more than one kid, unlike pre-SBR Joseph. If Josefumi is a JoJo, and a Kujo, then it stands to reason that he's a JoJo from his mother's side. The star birthmark holds up to to prove it too. <br><br>It's interesting that Josuke's face is a lot closer to Josefumi's than it is to Kira's. But there has to be something important about Josefumi's eyes.</br></br></br>  <br>Man I fucking wish I had fancomics for you to translate but I'm not on my computer.</br>  <br>Yep, that's Dio alright.</br>  WHY DOES JOSEFUMI HAVE A FUCKING BIRTHMARLK  <br>He's my favorite JoJo along with Giorno.</br>  <br> along with Giorno <br><br>Well then, that's just plain bad taste</br></br></br>  the name  <br>if you say it like that, doesn't it sound rather bizarre?</br>  <br>Because he's a JoJo. Damn son.</br>  <br>When Joseph was revived, he indeed was possessed, but not by DIO, but by Bo Derek and Al Yankovic, who share his body in a way much like Doppio and Diavolo but without the physical changes.<br>The baby in JoJolion is actually Avdol who ran into Alessi; Cream sends people to the SBRverse.<br>Alessi's ax is partially made out of Santana.

He's a cousin. Araki set up that scene with the Joestar family tree for a reason.</br></br>  <br>Listen man, if you don't like classy mafia bosses with no sense of mercy I can't fucking help you.</br>  Why didn't Fugo go with the rest of the group? Why was he the only one who was afraid when he had the best power out of all of them at that point?  <br>But it's Josef<br><br><br>The Joestar tree is up on the wiki, check that.</br></br></br></br>  Isn't it funny that they're the opposite when push comes to shove?<br><br>Diavolo is a complete nutjob most of the time, clinically paranoid while DIO puts on this cool and charismatic facade that attracts people to him.<br><br>But when Diavolo fights he don't fuck around, so if we exclude Giorno, every person who has faced him died. He killed them, he didn't play around but instead was straight to the point. Diavolo seems very calm during his fights, analyzing while DIO, goes full ham and starts going crazy, making these faces and hammy speeches.<br><br>I feel like DIO's the more appealing, functional and charismatic leader, while Diavolo is the far more unstable yet competent leader</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Diavolo = italian for devil<br><br>Dio = spanish for God<br><br>woooooooooooooow</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please fuck off Kevin</br>  <br> best power out of all of them <br>That's exactly it. Araki made him too strong with too formulaic of a power, so he was written out. He was planned to be a mole for the boss and betray them, as well.</br></br>  <br>I don't think he's an asshole I think he's just social awkward. Like he doesn't understand that yasuho likes him, he clearly didn't understand getting a boner like that was weird, and he probably doesn't understand that leaving yasuho to talk to karera will make her feel bad.<br><br>He's pretty much "adorkable" I guess</br></br></br>  <br>Probably just a coincidence, but I found a sketch from part 4 of Josuke wearing a shirt similar to Josefumi's.</br>  <br> fart joke <br>Are you 12?</br></br>  <br>Jeremy, i'm pretty sure you had inside info that it'd be coming out today, fuck off</br>  <br>The original user of the Wall Eyes.</br>  <br>DIO loses all the time because he's an arrogant fuck who underestimates literally everyone that isn't him, and plays around too much. Diavolo only lost because Giorno pulled the biggest plot device out of his ass in all of JoJo.<br><br>I just wish Diavolo had more characterization.</br></br></br>  <br>Gappy is beyond socially awkward. He barely has any understanding of how society works to begin with. Dude had no problem walking around naked with his quads swinging for all of Morioh to see.</br>  <br>God damn, pretty cool.</br>  <br><br>He's probably Kira's uncle<br><br>You how Joseph is</br></br></br></br>  Just so you know Joseph, Kira's grandfather, has 3 other siblings who could've had children who could've had kids that live in Morioh  <br>Dio is also italian for God</br>  <br>Do you really think he's the Anon who made that?</br>  <br>you act like he made that image</br>  <br> I just wish Diavolo had more characterization. <br><br>I wish this for all villains, Kira was the only interesting one so far, but Vallentine came close.</br></br></br>  You think light novel Kars would be able to do a JoJo version of Crisis on infinite earths?  <br>It's possible but I'd be surprised if Araki went with that. Not many people hang out with their second/third cousins. Joseph had more than just Holly too. Josefumi could easily be Kira's cousin. <br><br>I can imagine that SBR Joseph would be double pissed if two of his daughters had yellow fever.</br></br></br>  Who did Joseph fight in the AU BT? Did Ceaser still exist but with a different name?<br><br>Did nothing happen between Part 7 and 8?</br></br>  <br><br>They still posted it, which means they saved an image with a fart joke.</br></br>  <br>story arcs like the cat who loved kira and him trying to become kosaku, really helped his character. I don't know why araki doesn't give the villains time to shine like that instead hiding them in the back until the final battle.</br>  is gappy the weirdest fuck of the jostar family?  <br> Did Caesar still exist? <br><br> Yes. </br></br></br>  <br>God in spanish is Dios.</br>  <br>He's more like Will counterpart</br>  <br>he got a nautical stand</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure a guy who knows that cleaning your feet with drinking water and eating crusty leftovers is not normal is well-functioning.</br>  <br>I really want the new translation to tackle him, because I've seen anons talk about how Diavolo's rash actions come from his insecurities regarding his power, and hw Doppio's kind of a way for him to get praise and distance himself from his fights unless absolutely necessary. if that stuff is true, it'd make him a lot more interesting.</br>  <br>He's a mix of both</br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>You have a very low bar for 'well-functioning'</br>  <br> Joseph never had a Ceaser <br> Still hung out with that crazy mofo Stroheim <br> WW2 never happened and they're still in their rocking chairs by Part 8 </br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with that image?</br>  <br>He also thought that Kira's jars of fingernail clippings were weird. Maybe he'll think that hairstyles aren't all that important too.</br>  <br>Stroheim counterpart was defeated in SBR</br>  Doffy Nico for your heart!  Anyone else want God Usopp's bounty to go up by an unprecedented amount? Maybe from $30 million to $300 million? It might happening when hundreds of former pirates and other ne'er-do-wells leave Dressorsa spreading word of how Usopp broke the Hobby curse and how they revere him as a messiah.<br><br>Not to mention having Usopp's bounty the 2nd highest in the crew is like poetry.</br></br>  <br>Usopp is the best crewmember, so yes</br>  <br>He lost so quickly it's unreasonable or should I say unbelievable. When I was reading the chapter there was no sense of "OMFG!" it was just an "eh? Oh Doffy's lost oh well" I'm not even hype for the future arcs after this bullshit. This really is a poor man's alabasta arc.<br><br>I wish Oda stopped dickriding the chapters. had he just fused the final chapters together it wouldn't have been so bad. Oda's losing his fucking edge.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, 100m is the most likely. I think Usopp might be getting Luffy's previous bounties. Completely baseless, yea, but hey.</br>  Aokiji was haki stabbed by Shirohige, Akainu was haki sliced by Marco and Vista, Crocodile was (haki?) decapitated by Doflamingo.<br>How come they survived that? Can haki users with logia powers block haki attacks or something?</br>  <br>They changed shape so the attack didn't hit them. Crocodile was clearly not Haki decapitated. Aokiji literally does this like the next page after he gets stabbed.</br>  What powers will kaido have?<br><br>I'm betting on one of the following<br><br> Typhon Mystical Zoan <br> Hydra Mystical Zoan <br> Sabre tooth tiger Zoan <br> Blood Logia </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A plain ol' Lion Zoan. King of the Beasts, motherfucker. Enies Lobby 2.0 with Chopper Rescue Plot incoming.</br>  <br>Quickly? Lmfao.<br><br>I was honestly getting bored with this prolonged arc. A one on one fight should in my opinion not take several weeks.<br><br>Not that realism and manga go hand in hand, but a one on one fight where both opponents are like fucking gods and it just never ends are really boring.<br><br>I think the reason series like Naruto and Bleach always turn to shit in the end is just that. The ridiculous power ups they always get. Shit becomes really boring when that last drop of realism gets thrown out the window.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then why don't they do that all the time when they get injured? Aokiji lost a leg for fuck's sake.<br><br>If they can just change shape to evade the haki attack, then what's the point of haki attacks? They were brought up especially so that a normal human being could defeat logia users.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because they can't ? They fought for 10 fucking days, dude. Both of them were heavily injured. You think Aokiji is going to be on tip top shape on Day 9th when Akainu was throwing a fucking Magma rock at him ? Hell no. The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel''</br>  <br>God Mystical Zoan. Or devil.<br><br>Probably not, it will be some generic albeit strong animal. But I want Oda to go all out here.</br></br></br>  <br> The point of Haki is not literally ''can hit Logia I guess lel'' <br>That was literally what it was brought up for in the first place though. And anyway, the fact remains that a haki user can hit logia users, and that rule simply did not seem to apply when Aokiji got stabbed.</br></br>  If Doflamingo could make clones of himself, why didn't he get more outlandish and just copied himself exactly to the detail? Why not go full Bayonetta and create some weird string beasts?  <br>Because Aokiji didn't get hit. It's that simple. The attack simply didn't hit him. You could say he just dodged. It's not that hard to understand. And iirc, CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia.</br>  Does anyone know what kind of island Zou is? Sounds like it would be related to wano/Kano  <br>Haki showed up in the literal first chapter.</br>  <br>Probably because it would be very weird. And Doffy could probably only make some Flamingo's which would have made Luffy lose his shit.</br>  <br>Hmm, in that case I find it weird that Aokiji looked so shocked when being stabbed.<br>Also, Rayleigh could stop Kizaru with a strike of his sword, wouldn't Kizaru possibly be able to dodge it the same way?<br>Then again he did not get hurt by that. Also, Marco sent him flying with a kick, so Kizaru probably just isn't that good at dodging things? Or does not care because he is Kizaru.<br><br> CoA was first used to hit Luffy, a paramecia. <br>Same difference. It circumvented a devil fruit power to hit the user.<br><br><br>But it was not adressed by name and described expositionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People speculate that it is the Korea to Kano's Japan.</br>  <br>King of Beasts fruit.</br>  <br>Big Dick 90inch Mystical Zoan, I'm calling it right now.</br>  <br>Remember when people thought Akainu had blood logia? good times</br>  <br>LMFAO</br>  <br>Black person zoan. Luffy will have to play basketball against him for the title of Yonko. When Kaido reveals his awakened zoan he turns into Shaqaido o'Neal and is like 20 feet tall. To keep up, Luffy will perform a full body gear 3, and also get back his afro power from the Foxy boxing fight.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1Pl<wbr>wOe6WKz4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Aokiji just looks serious. Not shocked whatsoever. Kizaru is a lazy shit and you know it. And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. And Rayleigh kept up with a fucking Light dude. That could be also a clue. <br><br>And it still hits Devil Fruit users. You just have to not be a scrub.

It just seems like a minor inconsistency to me, but I can write it off as "haki raises your chances against logia types" rather than seeing as like "haki always beats logia".<br><br> And there's nothing to say Kizaru has the same mastery over his fruit that Aokiji and Akainu has. <br>Well, he's been a marine for the same amount of time and was known as a "monster" back then aswell. So I just jumped to that conclusion.<br><br>Also, I find it kinda sad that we probably won't ever have a marine as strong as the red-yellow-blue admirals with Shengoku on top. Fujitora apparently is much weaker than the other admirals (though obviously he has still time to prove himself) and I don't have really high hopes for green bull (will he maybe be a zoan user? we don't really have any zoan marines other than The Buddha).<br>It feels like Luffy will never defeat the marines at the zenit of their power, even if he beats Akainu at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do you best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>We don't even know if they both had fruits back then. And if we're going by the movie info, Zephyr says that Kizaru relies on his fruit too much so we can assume that he is a cocky prick that won't think about dodging that much. And Rokugyu and Fujitora has been called ''Monsters'' too.</br>  <br>But Fujitora seems so much weaker than the previous admirals. It would seem unreasonable that the marines could simply replace their strongest forces that were intact for the decades without a drop in power - though obviously possible.</br>  <br>Ayy</br>  Damn, I keep forgetting how few logia users there actually are. Seems like so many more because Smoker was introduced early, but many that seem to be logias from memory are just logiaesk paramecias, like Mr. 3, Jozu or Magellan.<br>It feels like thee are more characters that have conqueror's haki than logia powers (though that obviously is not true.)</br>  <br>An actual high bounty's capabilities horrified Usopp. He's not there yet.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=egJ<wbr>_tcZC0Ek</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>I wouldn't bet against Oda just yet, we've seen the extend of the Marines but not of the World Government. <br><br>We know for sure a new generation of Pacifista is coming, no clue what Vegapunk is up to, CP0 has been on the sidelines.

Still one of my favorite characters</br>  <br>kizaru is known to rely too much on his df power; atleast it was mentioned directly in war z whether you want to take that as canon or not</br>  <br>its a weird logia since he cant do that, alternately it makes his body weaker; so its easier just to think of it as a paramecia (unless he can turn into darkness in complete darkness like say under a cloak</br>  Coby has conquerors as well, He showed it at the end of marineford    <br>Ace used it at Grey Terminal yah, lets get real Roger definitely had it. Lets get it out of the way btw, YES only 1 in a million people have CoC, yea that rare. There where over 10 million people in Alabasta alone, that's 10 users right there. Why wouldn''t people with the ability be attracted to the big show in the New World?<br><br><br>Oh God my dream the Mizu Mizu. I want a villan to have a subordinate have it. He's a great fighter we think doesn't have a fruit because he's ashamed of it. It can only be used once, he soaks a fruit user and for that split second someone else gets a free hit on them and the Mizu user immediately is foam at the mouth mode.</br></br></br></br>  <br>they may not know they have it</br>  <br>mind telling us exactly when he showed it?</br>  Would be covered in Snow or Ice cause a DF user to lose their power?  <br>Nope, only ocean water counts, I think?</br>  <br> Nope, only ocean water counts, I think? <br><br> O: First of all, let's discuss the problem of Devil Fruit users bathing themselves. People who have eaten a Devil Fruit are "hated" by the sea, and cannot swim. The "sea" here can refer to anything from rivers, pools and baths to any kind of standing water. On a worldwide level, they are all the "sea." When these people enter the water, not only can they not use their powers, they have trouble moving their bodies at all. They might be able to struggle a bit, but it wouldn't do much good. That's if their entire bodies are submerged in the "sea." With less than half the body or just the limbs, it gets easier. Also, rain and dripping water have no effect at all. Therefore, hip baths or showers are the most common choice. Now, in Crocodile's case, "water" is the weakness of his very powers, so his abilities are robbed even in the shower. But it's not like there are enemies around when you take a shower, so I'd bet he would take them even with his powers being blocked. Don't you think? ---And to answer your final question, about myself bathing. As it happens, I do bathe. Twice! In a year! </br></br></br>  <br>You could easily rape crocodile while he's taking a shower</br>  <br>So let me get this straight. So if you want your kid to be strong, determined, and successful, all you have to do is make his middle initial D? Why isn't everyone a D then?</br>  <br>it is not the name, it is the bloodline</br>  <br>Because not everyone believes in that superstition.</br>  &lt;- who knew?  <br>If I ever have a kid his middle name will be D</br>  <br> opmemes.com </br>  <br> Shotamingo has an adorable girl voice <br><br>Nice<br>Now why couldn't they do that with Law?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou is Kaku with his awakened Giraffe Zoan, which turns him into a Kirin. <br><br>On a more serious note, I'm expecting one of the following<br><br> Mystical/Ancient Zoan <br> Godzilla Zoan <br> Lion Zoan <br> Something that seems dumb like a Flea Zoan or a Tardigrade Zoan that is actually retardedly powerful <br> Paramecia that lets him summon animals rather than become them <br> Something that lets him turn into any animal and mix and match them (Something like Ultimate Kars) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Griffin Zoan</br>  <br>You're not serious right? Fucking edgelord kids</br>  <br> Fujitora <br> Weak <br><br>Yeah the only person who actually hurt Sabo and made post timeskip Zoro struggle sure is weak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kino and momos countries are tied with kaido, they dislike dragons hmmm disliking a creature that's suppose to be extinct I wonder what kaido could be</br>  <br>You don't know how aokiji lost his leg could have been way before his fight with akainu</br>  <br> a Kirin zoan <br><br>now I want that to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Garp, dragon, whitebeard, ace, buggy</br>  <br>he has observation, not conquerors</br>  <br>He seems weak compared to the crazy op other admirals.<br><br><br> &gt;Something that seems dumb like a Flea Zoan or a Tardigrade Zoan that is actually retardedly powerful <br>Too goofy for a yonko, sadly. Hopefully he has a flee commander or something. Any insect, really.

Better than ever. <br><br><br>???</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm one of those people who thinks he wasn't trying, both with the meteor and pushing the birdcage because otherwise his bet on Luffy wouldn't work for his plan.</br>  Kaido will have a Dragon mythical zoan. The whole thing with Wano and Kinemon's reaction imply it.  <br>Really you're arguing Garp has never been shown using conquers haki <br><br>did you even read dressrosa when garp it on chinjao<br><br>did you skip marineford where ivankov stated dragon had it <br><br>Why are you even in this thread</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What will happen now?<br><br>Will they go after Sanji and the rest and fight Big Mom? Or Kaido will appear first?</br></br>  <br>Nah bruh he has that mythical/ancient Godzilla zoan, and Law and Luffy are gonna need Dino Drake to take him down</br>  <br>he said that after timeskip.<br>refering to how much he has grown those past 2 years</br></br>  <br>Garp doesn't have conquerors you sperglord, the proper translation wasn't "So he inherited it", it was "So he has it". Which could practically mean anything. Against CHinjao it was only Conquerors haki.</br>  <br>5 more chapters of Rebecca crying all over Luffy's face, shots of every part of Doflamingo except his face and Gatz mouthing off about wieners.</br>  <br>You're 110% retarded</br>  <br>haha really?<br><br>Man Luffy looks younger to me Post TS so I guess that reference went right by me</br></br></br>  <br>Troll confirmed</br>  <br>...you mean Armament but you said Conquerors</br>  <br>How does he look younger? Nothing about him changed.</br>  <br><br>My meant against Chinjao it was armament, am in a hurry to go out.</br></br>  <br>I swear his eyes got bigger or something. His proportions definitely changed though. He's softer-looking since the skip</br>  <br>Chinjao and Garp had a fucking clash of conquers haki you speed reading normie</br>  <br>No they fucking didn't, show me the page. We've seen armament haki clashes look the same with sparks everywhere as well.</br>  <br>What? Did you even read the first half of the series? Luffy looked goofy as fuck up until Water 7. After time skip his upper body looks a little wider, too.</br>  <br><br>First they need to find out who is giving them a ride to wherever they're going because they sure as shit arent getting there on the Sunny</br></br>  <br>that's what im sayng you dip<br><br>he doesnt look the same as he did for the TS. He's younger looking</br></br></br>    <br>is Law's arm on backwards?</br>  <br>Fujitora seems to have gotten his fruit recently going by his words, maybe he'll get stronger.</br>  <br>What the fuck are you saying? Widening of the upper body makes a guy look older. Oda even gave size changes in an SBS and Luffy grew like 5 inches or something. I don't see how you can think he looks younger</br>  A episode worth watching next week  <br>The current group is Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Robin, Franky, Law, Kin'emon, and Kanjuro, can Luffy fit two 9 feet giants on his back.</br>  <br>I already said his eyes are bigger. It's his face that looks younger not his body</br>  <br>Luffy only grew two centimeters, that's like one inch.</br>  <br>Aw Yeh<br><br>It's about damn time<br><br>though the.. makeup looks off? Why are all the lines so thin?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And he can already pull meteors down from space? That would be impressive.</br>  <br>Corazon looks off in those shots, I can't describe it, maybe the shape of his chin is wrong?</br>  <br>His lips aren't as lush</br>  <br><br>It's a shame because he looked nice when one of the show's animation directors drew him for fun on twitter.<br><br>Hope Toei gets their shit together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe no one is putting your dumb ass in place <br><br>http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piece<wbr>/716/19</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Damn shame</br></br></br>  It was just like yesterday when people actually thought kyros killed doffy  <br>he was mistaken in the type, dont be so quick to judge im sure youve done the same</br>  <br>good luck getting his hook out of your asshole</br>  <br> http://www.mangapanda.com/one-piec<wbr>e/716/19</wbr> <br> mangapanda <br> confirmed for casual <br>that doesnt look like garp to me you dumbass</br></br></br></br>  <br>Implying that's a bad thing</br>  Cora-san  ;_;   <br>fucking christ<br><br>just once.

Dish is up to artist.<br><br>Any other works are very much appreciated.</br></br>  <br>Minor side character.

I'd like to request Etna playing beach volleyball, using a prinny as the ball  kicking or punching it across the field. <br>Otherwise anything cute would be greatly appreciated!</br>  <br>http://sharkweekcountdown.com/<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lV8<wbr>i-pSVMaQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  ok fifth threads the charm right?<br>ill be requesting the usual Template character insert<br>Requesting Diego Brando as the guy on the right (with facial cracks and mouth tearing with bandaid/patch over the mouth tear) and the end of the "dick" not being a human face but a velociraptor head instead (with DIO pattern on the side of the ..."shaft")<br> that felt weird to type out <br>thanks and remember to take it easy guys.<br><br> y'know i cant help but feel like having a huge reference worsens your chance of getting a delivery </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does any have a really easy request?

At one point I thought she was just a girl I fancied, that it was a different girl who had my heart. I one day realized I had it backwards, that my feelings for my waifu were true love, I'd just been afraid to face it because of her popularity. But at last I'm happy - seeing her face in the mornings really makes me feel refreshed, even when I slept poorly.<br><br>I don't know how many years it's been, but but at least five since I realized the truth.</br></br></br>  <br> How about shaven completely bald for summer? <br> I'd request it myself but the ostracism would be unbearable and I'd never get drawn for again. </br></br>  Requesting Sawyer with a teddybear or stuffed animal of some sort:<br><br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1673276<br>http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=1842966<br><br><a href="http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/a/1435278216465.j<wbr>pg</wbr></a></br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I already did.</br>  <br>holy SHIT<br>absolutely stunning.<br>would you ever do a husbando or do you stick with waifu?</br></br></br>  <br>Your post made me vomit.</br>  <br>IT'S PEANUT BUTTAH JELLY TIME!!</br>  <br><br>Anon please, request your own waifu not mine!</br></br>  Requesting a drawing of Len and white len doing a fusion pose,<br>Or Len wearing frilly gothlolita like clothing.<br><br>Any drawing of her would be fine too.</br></br></br>  Requesting summer Yuuko.<br>Sundress, ice cream, or whatever, as long as it's reminiscent of summer.<br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br>Can I request something from you latenight?</br>  <br>I'm extremely jealous of you.</br>  <br> s-spear-kun? </br>  <br>adorable</br>  <br>tohka riding sandalphone on a swimming pool<br><br>no need to thank me anon</br></br></br>  <br> I'm jealous how good he cooks my lunchbox... </br>  <br>oh shit nigga</br>  <br>what is ddt, anon-kun?<br>can i draw her performing cpr on a tiger?</br></br>  I'd like to request something adorable of this beautiful young lady.

Thanks poem anon.<br><br>Reposting my request from the previous thread.<br><br>I'd like to make a request for Makise Kurisu. Any theme you're interested in drawing would be fine with me whether it's comfy, cute, lewd, etc. If you could find a way to incorporate either a lab coat or Dr. Pepper, I'd be very happy.<br><br>Thanks again for taking time out of your day for this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  REMOVE LUVIA  <br>finnish girls are disgusting...i got stuck in helsinki for 2 days and nearly every woman i saw was either fat or ugly, but usually both<br><br>it's no wonder why the men are constantly drunk, they have to fuck those beasts</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that Mooncell copies of Heroic Spirits are exactly the same as the ones in the Throne right? Yet Archer in Extra is aware of the events that occur in F/SN despite his "younger" self being hopelessly unaware. Only confirmed difference is that Mooncell Archer is not bound to the Counterforce which is why he's less of a jackass.</br>  <br>cuckold brittistani?</br>  <br>Neither of those things make it okay to hit on someone else's boyfriend, much less in front of them. I'll have to agree that it's because of  slut </br>  <br>Mooncell updates heroic spirits info based on shit that's happened on Earth.<br><br>The fifth war happened on Earth, it was recorded, info was updated on Archer. You're arguing that all servants retain information based on previous summonings, which is wrong.<br><br>Cu also remembered Archer from the fifth war in Extra, he's not a guardian.</br></br></br></br></br>  No dubs for you  <br>Being vulnerable doesn't make her any less competent.<br>Back then she used to be far more involved in the requests and had more input on the solutions.<br>After volume 6 she became almost a background character, since other than drama, she hardly did anything relevant.</br></br></br>  <br> When all the threads over the past days are lamenting Yukino's character 'development'  <br>These anons are slow to see the light. Ever since the stuco arc, we have known about Yukino problem. We already had a glimpse of how fucked up she is when she ran out of the club room to the roof top.<br>She has been terrible for like 6volumes straight. These people has been slow on the uptake and put Yukino on a pedestal like 8man.</br></br></br>  <br> These anons are slow to see the light. <br> The majority of posters who include both secondaries and people who've read the LN <br><br>Sure, anon. Sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes I have. 8man had a "If I was my older self I would fall for her" moment which means if anything, she's officially crossed the starting line.<br><br>Meanwhile Yukino, Yui, and 8man are struggling through building real relationships with each other while addressing the elephant in the room of their love triangle. Iroha's only shot is if the series continues past volume 12 and Watari turns it back into a Slice of Life story.</br></br></br>  <br> Mutual disarmament. <br>I thought it was surrender. As in, not even propose, just accept things as they happen (i.e. Yui gets 8man and Yukino remains a friend).<br><br>Mutual disarmament wouldn't make sense, since Yui said she was being unfair, and in a mutual disarmament, both of them lose and there's no unfairness in that.</br></br></br></br>   [orz] SHOW BY ROCK!! 12 [B2D7044C].mkv   <br>She's only a thousand years old.</br>    <br> There is something weird about ShuZo today. </br>  <br> Crow was a girl all along </br>  <br>I would listen to these songs dubbed in any language.</br>      Make a contract with me, and become a magical band girl!  <br>Is she pointing a gun at me? what the fuck is that?</br>  <br>Who doesn't recognize this scene?<br>Even if you haven't seen the show.</br></br>  <br>It's a musket</br>  Tsukihime remake news in Type-Moon Ace in a few days  <br> edgy teenagers are like very rare </br>  <br>BEST<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>People keep saying this shit<br><br>He's a self insert because he has that standard sort of "Slacker with no hobbies or interests, no thoughts that are odd or his own, just does what the game tells him to, listless and personality might depend on the route is very average or normal high school student most of the time who is a basic mold" type VN character. Even Nasu says they designed him after that standard sort of KEY protagonist like the guy in AIR, or maybe it was Rewrite? That sort of mold is the standard self insert type, who's not meant to be hard for the reader to identify with, rather than being his own character.<br><br>He sometimes goes into berserker mode, which is pretty normal for self insert characters as the people inserting go "Woah, I'm so cool, I did that" when the MC does something cool. Like Takeru from Muv Luv, that guy from that KEY game(most of them), that guy from Da Capo. That boring sort of observational, smarmy, slacker, but meddles with people type.<br><br>Naruto goes into a berserker mode just like Shiki, people don't go "Woah, you understand how a gay rabit fox child thinks, who wants to kill people? You're demented!". Being a rabid Berserker isn't who he really is, that's just a facet that's basically something else entirely that doesn't factor into his personality, something that triggers randomly but doesn't mean much beyond "Woah MC" and then he reverts back. That guy from Bleach faggot also had a Berserk mode where he put on some mask, people didn't go "You see this guy as someone easy to insert into when he's wild and sword? You're crazy!", because berserk mode is mostly just a tack on sort of deal that isn't really their personality, nor is it a choice. He's not a super killer outside of being trained, he hates killing, he's mostly just a normal slacker guy who sometimes goes berserk, like Naruto.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shielder <br>Is that a new class?
