[ Is Vampire Hunter D worth getting into?  <br><br>The manga is really good and stays faithful to the novels.

There are a lot of wasted scenes. Akane and her friend never acknowledge the death of the other girl; Akane and sensei scene is so dull, it made me cringe, there are better ways of planning that conversation without being so "let's inform the spectators about S1 and muh Kogami".<br>Also, that Engrish sounds so uncanny, I bet the translator device should sound like that.</br>  <br>Double dubs always says the truth</br>  Attack on Titan is just a Mecha anime in disguise isn't it  You figured it out, you can go home now.  <br>It's a Muv-Luv rip-off, slowpoke-kun</br>  The author is a MuvLuv fanboy and the manga takes a lot of inspiration from it.  <br>Yes</br>  <br>The only Asian I will let cum inside me</br>   Aimer 3rdアルバム「DAWN」 <br> 09. LAST STARDUST (TVアニメ「Fate／stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]」第20話挿入歌) <br><br>IT IS FINALLY HERE</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br> Has a chance of going NBR route <br> Wishes to be blood related instead. </br></br>  Episode 20 alone carried the whole adaptation. Insert songs make everything 10 times better.  <br>Best episodes of the anime: 0, 20, 24, and 25.</br>  <br>agree, honorable mention to the episode in season 1 showing how broken shirou is.</br>  New chapter is out. It's shit  <br>My point is that the early guts build up was how much his hatred for the demons was huge, then he shags one just for the chance of killing her? That's like saying he would shag the godhand girl just to kill her too if he had a chance.</br>  <br>I'm not sure, I don't remember it ever being stated.</br>  <br><br>didn't he almost fuck her anyway? i'm pretty sure she was gonna rape him somehow<br><br>man the part where she gets and orgasm from him literally blowing up her insides gave me a huge boner</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Truly this Hell will never end.</br></br>  <br>I wonder what troll guts smell like</br>  when will Yuya and Yuzu meet again?

Yuuya will bring the EGAO.</br>  <br>Yuya can't egao for shit</br>  <br>Doujins when?<br>Doujins where?</br></br>  Crow is going to replace the best girl, going to say it now because those gucking faggots at Konami want to shill more fucking blackwings  So after all these years, how do you think they are doing?  Man, there will never be an uncensored anime like this on jap late nite tv anymore. <br><br>Things there sure has gone to shit after year 2010.</br></br>  <br>Probably living in a Scandinavian suburb. Sora got a kid, and Haru most likely could not find a job to support the three of them, considering he's not even 18 and he probably can't even properly speak the language of whatever country they're living in. Chances are they're stuck in a foster home or something, at least until Haru is a legal adult, and even then I'm not sure since incest is kind of a no-no over there just like everywhere else.<br><br>Basically, their lives are probably pretty depressing.</br></br></br>  <br>I blame Abe and that Tokyo mayor.</br>  <br>Seeing as they both drowned, I'm guessing not very well.</br>  In Haruka Na Sora, they are married and Sora is pregnant. So i would have to guess they are pretty happy</blockquote>]
