Hiryuu and the Shoukaku-class were quite well-built, and the latter did come to mount what radar the IJN had.</br></br></br></br>  If I started playing this game in 2013 I'd be so ahead.  Remember when twisted Nagato was popular here?  <br> You can't really hold that against them <br>Yes I can. You pick a fight with the US and don't even have radar on your ships? A comedy for the ages.<br><br> Some of the carriers were alright <br>Turkey and her sister and zuiho and her sister were the only ones who could compare to the Essex class.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is way too old for that.</br>  <br>She's still young and spry!</br>  <br>Younger than Kongou.</br>    <br> Yes I can. You pick a fight with the US and don't even have radar on your ships?  <br>Most of the ships you're discussing were designed well before any navy had figured out practical radar usage on ships.<br><br> Turkey and her sister and zuiho and her sister were the only ones who could compare to the Essex class. <br>USN carriers were shit because the only ones that could compare to the Essex class were Essex and Midway. It's a silly comparison because the Essex Class is 3 years newer than the Shoukaku-class and 4 years newer than Yorktown. <br><br>There's also nothing special about Zuihou designwise, her continued survival was more due to luck than due to any particularly good design. Her sister ship was lost way earlier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> not making one of them the luckiest shipgirl in the fleet </br>  <br>Stalker pls<br><br>Runts like her in the animal kingdom are usually the first to die in infancy</br></br></br>  <br> humans <br> part of the animal kingdom <br>We let people with down syndrome reproduce for the sole purpose of spiting mother nature and the animal kingdom.</br></br></br>  <br> navy had figured out practical radar usage on ships. <br>Hardly an excuse.<br> our boxer lost because he was blind! <br><br><br> USN carriers were shit  <br>History begs to differ... Damage control and hangar capacity comes to mind.<br><br> Her sister ship was lost way earlier. <br>Well yeah, but they were really the only good light carriers the ijn had.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they are. <br>http://anthro.palomar.edu/animal/ta<wbr>ble_humans.htm<br> Kingdom: Animalia </br></wbr></br></br>  <br> Not knowing about developments that hadn't happened yet and keeping them in mind is somehow not an excuse <br> The Royal Navy was shit in the Napoleonic Wars because they didn't build aircraft carriers! <br><br> History begs to differ... Damage control and hangar capacity comes to mind. <br>Still shittier than Essex class (apart from Midway-class, which wasn't really even in the war), which apparently is your metric for deciding whether a carrier is well-designed.<br><br> Well yeah, but they were really the only good light carriers the ijn had. <br>If they weren't well designed they weren't well designed, and IJN light carriers in general weren't great.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> IJN light carriers in general weren't great <br>Niggar are you agreeing with me by arguing with me.<br><br><br>And I think an entire country should be able to understand that if the bad guys have something cool. They should have that same cool thing too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even so, humans don't follow the rules the rest of the animal kingdom goes by. Humans deliberately keep alive genetically flawed individuals and alter the environmental factors that would normally drive natural selection to favor themselves. And if humans want runts to survive (and it apparently does) the rest of the Animal Kingdom can go fuck itself.</br>  <br><br>Did you want to put on your fedora hat that badly?</br></br>  <br> Niggar are you agreeing with me by arguing with me. <br>I never argued that all the IJN ships were good, but that your methodology is flawed in determining what is a good design or not. A good design is a ship that can fulfill its role and make the best use of resources and technology that was available to the nation developing it at the time of its design. A man born in the 1940s shouldn't be deemed inferior because he is incapable of using a personal computer developed when he is 50. <br><br> And I think an entire country should be able to understand that if the bad guys have something cool. They should have that same cool thing too. <br>Even if they did, a nation cannot magically undo the past to revise its past ships to include technology they didn't have at the time. Nor can they magically come up with the resources or knowledge they previously lacked.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who doesn't?</br>  <br> I-I don't have a logical response! <br> I know, I'll just call him a fedora tipper, that'll show him! <br>Brilliant response.</br></br></br>  <br> Even if they did, a nation cannot magically undo the past to revise its past ships to include technology they didn't have at the time. Nor can they magically come up with the resources or knowledge they previously lacked <br>Truth, but they can learn from their mistakes. I can name plenty of ships built after1944 that lacked not only good fire conrol but also waterproofing, damage control and flame proofing. Taiho comes to mind...</br></br>  <br>Why the "they"?</br>  <br>I agree with you on that, I'm just saying that some IJN ships were well designed based on what they had available at the time they were made.</br>  <br>I'm not the guy you're arguing with fatfuck.

It felt like it fit in to the atmosphere at the time, and it didn't feel like it was merely forced into the anime. It's as if there's more to look forward to after this episode, as if   it's teasing for Haruhi S3 </br></br></br></br>  HARUHI S3 ANNOUNCED AT END OF EPISODE?!  No subs yet?  <br>Watch it raw like you're going in dry</br>   To be continued... <br><br>HARUHI S3 CONFIRMED</br></br>  <br>I can't wait for season   2 of Yuki-chan </br>  <br>Sorry, I'm busy watching the  dub. </br>  <br> dub <br>anon pls</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, but I just can't say no to Crispin Freeman.</br>  <br> I've only watched Haruhi with dub until this.   Crispin Freeman is a great Kyon. </br>  <br>If I'll ever watch the spinoff dub I guess it'll be for Freeman.</br>   Itsumo no Fuukei Kara Hajimaru Monogarari starts to play after the festival <br> endless eight kyon-denwa in the beginning and end of the episode <br> that melancholic Haruhi at the festival <br> the series is not over <br> mfw <br>FUCK THEY'RE PLAYING WITH MY HEART.<br>This last episode really made me want S3 now. And for the OVA to come out.<br>Series may have started out poorly, but it sure did end fucking right. Great comeback Satelight; looking forward to that Endless Eight OVA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  this shit is still going on? for what purpose?  <br>for haruhi s3</br>  <br>S3? But theres only 1 season and a movie</br>  <br> Itsumo no Fuukei Kara Hajimaru Monogarari starts to play after the festival <br>You better not be lying. Hurry up HS.</br></br>  What will be OVA about?  <br>TAAAAAAAAAAAKIIIIIIIIIIIIII</br>  That's a very quiet end... will Haruhi disappear forever now?  S3 for the 10th anniversary of the anime<br><br>If it still doesn't happen then, I'll finally give up hope for good</br></br>  This shit's been reduced to a meme for me. I won't ever look at Yuki Nagato again without thinking of TAAHKEY  <br>If we get some new pachinko, you can be sure things won't be quiet around here.</br>  What the fuck is Funi doing  This is the last chance I have to post a reminder in a Yuki-chan thread that this exists.<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>43687</wbr></br></br>  <br>neat</br>  This show was fucking awful.<br>I only suffered through it to tell people how bad it was.<br>Also what the fuck is Funi doing, I want to end this torment as soon as possible.<br>Oh, and never download [qsub].<br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>643687</wbr> <br>What kind of mega autism is this?</br></br>  The new dub episode is up at least.  WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, WHERE IS THE EPISODE?!  <br>I got to the beginning of episode 14 and just stopped. I couldn't handle it anymore. It wasn't worth it</br>  <br><br>What an absolute joke.</br></br>  <br> Sasaki is going to be animated <br>Yes, please.</br></br>  <br>Hell, I stopped at the first two episodes of the amnesia arc, but I'm willing to get back on that horse just for her.</br>   the fan service episode finally gets dubbed   Kyon-kun, denwa~  <br>they even got the same voices for the butler and the maid from the original series,</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128234339 <br>It's not on nyaa either. Hell, it's not even on Funimation yet. What the hell is going on? I don't pay for their streaming service just so I can watch it at the same time poorfags do.</br>  <br>It's a spin off, not a fanfiction.</br>  <br> But theres only 1 season and a movie <br>The fuck you smoking?</br></br>  <br><br> 2 broadcast seasons <br><br> 1 chronological season </br></br></br></br>  Just two more weeks and we get to hear Ruff's robot-Nagato voice again. I can't wait!  I ended up watching this series without seeing the original Haruhi version or the movie until 2 weeks ago.<br><br>I have to say I ended up hating Haruhi in her own series. Spoiled cunt.</br></br>  i thought they ended this after season 1. The endless eight sucked. Thats what made the show shit. Haurhi should have remembered she was god and ruined everything.  Where the fuck are muh subs?!  <br>subs  never </br>  <br>How could we allow Horrible Subs to do this to us?</br>  <br><br> I have to say I ended up hating Haruhi in her own series. Spoiled cunt. <br><br>A lot of people did, myself included. I never felt she was MC though, she's like a prop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not Horrible Subs (at least I don't think it is) it's Funimation. They haven't posted the new episode yet either. <br><br>If there's a problem, then that's okay as long as they say that they're working on it, but so far I don't know anything.</br></br></br>  Just watched raw. I liked this episode, and my favorite moment was when Itsumo no Fuukei started playing.<br>Still waiting subs, still waiting S3, but it was a fun ride.</br>  <br> she's like a prop <br>That's more generous than me. I considered her the villain.</br></br>  <br>Definitely not HorribleSubs' fault, they just yank whatever is on crunchyroll, so it's whoever makes those subs who is to blame for this delay.<br><br>And last week's delay</br></br></br>  <br> It's one of my favorites from spring. </br>  <br><br><br>I  like  Haruhi</br></br></br>  SUBS WHEREEEEE  <br><br>Yeah, the episode wasn't even up on Funimation's site the last I checked, so HS can't deliver because they don't have it.</br></br>  <br>yeah, but they're getting this show from Funi.<br>Funi hasn't posted it yet, therefore HS doesn't have it yet.</br></br>  <br>T H I S<br>H I S <br>I S<br>S</br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part is that even if funimation releases the episode, it will take some time for horriblesubs to rip it because it has to be done manually.</br>  Well I guess I'll check back tomorrow then.  <br>I  love  Haruhi.</br>  <br>Asakura might not be best girl (pic related) but surely she is best waifu</br>  <br><br><br>ITT people who haven't read the LNs and likely watched the original in broadcast order.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's me alright. I don't hate Haruhi, but she's not my favorite character in the original series (that I watched in broadcast order).</br>  What's with no sub this late?  <br>a lot of Asakura and Tsuruya appearance that make me keep watching this show</br>  <br>I know of someone that has read them and dislikes her quite a bit. <br>That doesn't stop me from gushing over her whenever we talk about the series.</br></br>  <br><br>Sir I may not agree with your choice but I sure as hell respect it.</br></br>  Fuck this, I wanted to finish this shit today and pretend it never existed.   1080p out <br>It's time.</br>  ITS OUT  <br>KITAAAAAAAAA<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K6y<wbr>4EPDtuRc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  That firework scene had me really confused in the RAW. Glad subs finally showed up though. I really enjoyed how this ended.  KYON-KUN DENWA  <br>Why does she sit like that?</br>  <br>May as well wait for Lemon. They normally finish in like an hour or two anyways.</br>  <br>maybe her butt hurts</br>  <br>FROM WHAT?!</br>    nyoron~  webm requests?  EH, NANDATTE?  <br>The first scene with the fireworks if you wouldn't mind. I've been too lazy to make them myself.</br>  So the other Yuki comes back for just a moment just to hear his confession, it's alittle weird but I'm okay with this.  <br>It's a bit more like she was still there, in some aspect, and he was talking though yuki-chan to the other yuki for just a moment.</br>  So what's the OVA gunna be? Place your bets.  mfw  Haruhi lost   SOON  had no idea was last episode; watch l8r  <br>DENWA</br>  <br>rendering now</br>  NANIKA OKASHII  <br>KYON-KUN DENWA</br>   Bouken desho desho   Shit show. Glad it's over.  <br>Thanks for letting us know :^)</br>    <br>Thanks.</br>     Alien yuki won <br>That was a good final episode.</br>  <br> watching a show you hate until the very end <br>Wow, how much free time do you have, anon?</br></br>  Finally. We can end this shit now. Together. All of us. Love and unity, we will rid ourselves at last of this horrendous monster.  <br><br><br>It was a good show. I wish it were longer.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>You are all aware there's an OVA coming in October, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Can I get a source?</br>  <br>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/da<wbr>ily-briefs/2015-03-27/the-disappear<wbr>ance-of-nagato-yuki-chan-original-v<wbr>ideo-anime-bundled-with-manga/.8643<wbr>6</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Alien yuki still best</br>  <br>Holy shit this episode was amazing, that ending! wow.<br><br>MORE!</br></br></br>  What did they do to Asakura?  <br> 704x421 <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>Made her Yuki's mother.</br>  oh damn   not one, but two denwas <br> open for S2 <br><br>Good series, S3fag tears were delicious to the end.</br></br></br>  Episode opens with "Kyon-kun denwa."<br><br>Ends with Endless 8 denwa. This episode made the show worth watch.<br><br> I still hated it though, this Yuki is trash. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyon likes alien yuki more anyways</br>  <br>Nah, he just said that he could learn to love her.</br>  <br>Looks like Kyon-kun's gonna be eating Takii on Sunday.</br>   Suddenly Itsumo no Fuukei starts playing <br>Damn, that took me back. I teared up a little.</br>  I wanted to feel the pain of endless 8 again, and only today do i learn this is the last episode. Never before have i been so disappointed.   that Itsumo no fuukei all of sudden <br>My heart wasn't ready.</br>  So now that it's over, how do you rate it?  <br> these last couple chapters <br><br>Oh my sweet jesus, my heart can't take this before bed.</br></br></br>  <br>8/10</br>  <br>7/10.</br>  <br>9/10</br>  <br>8/0</br>  <br>7/10</br>  <br>3.5/10</br>  <br>The adaption was absolutely fantastic.<br>I'm still unsure if I'm sold on the story itself, however.</br></br>  <br>7/10</br>  <br>5/10<br>It had it's ups and downs. Sometimes it annoyed me, sometimes I got a good laugh and the Disappearance arc was great. But the annoyances really just weighed it down on me as a not bad but not good show either. I'll watch the OVA but I doubt I'll rewatch the series again.</br></br>  <br>6/10</br>  <br> Disappearance arc was great. <br>That's not how you spell confusing nonsense.</br></br>  <br>How was it confusing?</br>  Man, watching this made me really nostalgic.  <br>All I know is that I probably wouldn't recommend it.</br>  <br>She becomes a Nagato that is not really Nagato but is still Nagato just because a car brushed past her.</br>  <br>You don't sound confused at all, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened.<br>It may be bullshit but it's not confusing.</br></br>  <br>7/10<br><br>I want my emotional, moeblobby, funnyface making meganekko Yuki. I wish she had her actual own show with cool alien Yuki as the inner monlog.</br></br></br>  <br>+More Asakura<br>+More Tsuruya<br>-TAHKI</br></br></br>  So just getting this straight, kyon confessed to other Yuki and not TAAKI, right?<br>Also did other Yuki take control during that scene or did normal yuki just pull a "Eh, nandatte?"?</br>  <br>Fireworks too loud. <br>Can't hear Kyon.<br>Other Yuki is dead.</br></br></br>  <br> October <br><br>Fuck you, I'll be dead by then.</br></br></br>  <br>6/10<br>and I'm a yukifag<br>and haruhi is one of my favorite anime ever</br></br></br>  <br>Why does she sit like that?</br>   sasaki and kuyou voiced in the OVA <br>I WANT TO BELIEVE.</br>  <br>2/10 Boring and shameless using Haruhi to attract some readers.</br>  <br><br>3/10 only redeemable scenes were with Haruhi around</br></br>  <br>MUCH FUCKING IMMINENT</br>  To the dubfags, what's the best place to watch it? Funi is blocked outside of the US  <br>Serves you right.  1/10. Your bait is not good enough. </br>  <br>It's not fan fiction because the author of Haruhi literally worked with the mangaka to write the content in the manga, you fucking retards. <br><br>His name is on the goddamn cover. A work of fan fiction wouldn't be officially affiliated with and created with the help of the writer of the light novel series the manga is based off. <br><br>I swear /a/ is nothing but braindead EOP teenagers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> [citation needed] </br>  I WANT HARUHI S3 NOW  <br>there is a very very slim chance for an s3 if a new novel appears<br><br>even then it will probably be the last novel in the series and there are still 7 novels that the anime did not cover, not including the unreleased one</br></br></br>  so how bad/good was this exactly?  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br>Tanigawa ran out of ideas, i don' think there will be a new novel.<br>I'm surprised that in all these years no one has tried to kickstart and S3.</br></br>  He could've kept going<br><br>he just didn't want to upset the delicate balance between yuki and haruhi<br><br>mikuru could graduate and nobody would really care that they lost the pet moeblob.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ran out of ideas <br>How? Just look at all the shit he did in the end of vol 11, he can't run out of ideas after that.</br></br>  <br>It really fits the "One chapter ends and another one will begin" Theme.<br><br>Allowing you to reminisce on what happened and look forward to what will happen next.<br><br>This theme embodies it so much.  I miss Haruhi. I miss Yuki. I miss Asahina and even Koizomi too!   Season 3 when?! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why doesn't he releases a new novel?</br>  <br>Kadokawa would be a fool not to animate them all.<br><br>If Tanigawa someohow creates the perfect Last novel to close the Haruhi Suzumiya Universe then we can be sure that Kadokawa will hire Kyo Ani again to create the last and final season along with a movie that will create a surge of collectible mania and memorabilia buying from all the fans to round up the story that was and is one of the greatest coming of age story about a young girl and her thirst for adventure/mystery and the supernatural.</br></br></br>  Did Yuki just get NTR'd by herself?<br>And you really got me there, Satellight. I fell hard for that Endless 8.</br>  <br>Because he's a lazy ass who killed his own franchise.</br>  <br>Really funny how Ms. Asahina slapped aside Tsuruya.<br>Quite a nice bit of comedy going in here.</br></br>  <br>So what happened here was "Stoic" Nagato "possessed" Tahkkey for the few seconds that Kyon confessed right?<br><br>It felt like a nice touch. Was it similar to the manga? If not, I approve of the anime version much more.</br></br></br>  <br>No fucking. Only cuddling under sheets while hand holding right?</br>  <br>6/10 for the first few "SOL" episodes with Tahkii.<br>8/10 for the final few episodes.<br><br>Averaging out to 7/10.<br><br>The mixing of the mundane and the mysterious returns on that last half and made it worthwhile similar to the original. Makes you think what you would do if you had a relative that had a personality shift as well. Good stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really wish they kept the Nagato that wasn't retarded, it was more fun watching bookworm Nagato and Kyon interact. They should've melded the personalities together.  3rd inning eh?  <br>what it mean</br>  <br>what it mean?</br>  S2 when?<br> HOPEFULLY NEVER </br>  <br>what it mean??</br>  Nagato is worst girl.  <br>*Haruhi<br><br>What a strange brainfart.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll fight you if you mean Alien Nagato.  Bitch. </br>  <br><br><br><br>Probably the episode number in the Endless Eight Series.</br></br></br></br>  my otosan work in kyoani and season 3 is making  <br>Don't mess with my heart bastard. It's already broken in twine.</br>  <br> engrish <br>Sure, tell him that he is a shitty faggot.</br></br>  <br>I know you're lying but I want it to be true</br>      <br>That was too cute.</br>  <br>Thanks, this is great</br>  this whole show felt way too forced, more so even than a side route in a VN<br>it's obvious kyon x haruhi is OTP and asakura just gets in the way and shoves nagato down kyon's throat</br>  Waiting for Comiket.  <br>The OTP kinda works here since the tension of the supernatural giving Kyon the time of his life is not present.<br><br>Normally Kyon is a quiet nice guy that wants to live a peaceful life. And Nagato gives that in spades.<br><br>Kyon should've grown out of his wanting of the supernatural wafter he graduated from Junior High. And there are no confirmation of those supernatural things in high school for him in this universe.</br></br></br></br></br>  So S3 announcement mid-August?<br><br>I'm gonna miss Yuki-chan's Asakura, only thing the show did right</br></br>  <br> Normally Kyon is a quiet nice guy that wants to live a peaceful life. <br>Kyon absolutely doesn't want that. Oh sure, that's what he'll end up doing if nobody forces him to do anything else, but he will always enjoy an exciting and stressful life more than he will a relaxed and peaceful one. That's how he's wired.</br></br>  anyone have that picture of Kyon giving Nagato back her I Choo Choo Choose You card?  Didn't the director say there would be a surprise? Better deliver with the OVA.  The next two dub episodes are going to be fantastic.  Hearing Ruff's Robot-Nagato voice again will make life worth living until then.   Some dude started translating the manga again <br>Praise the lord and pass the ammunition!</br>  <br>Damnit I want to make sweet love to her so much</br>  <br> AND SWING INTO POSITION, <br> CAN'T AFFORD TO BE A POLITICIAN! </br></br>  Good, now that it's finally over, I can go reread the novels to rinse this shit from my mind.  <br>Not yet. Endless Eight OVA is left.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think I'll pass, thanks.</br>  <br>He just wants her to meet his sister.</br>  <br>Time for some lewd.</br>  Mikuru is now meganekko too.  So did yuki win?  <br>/lit/ Yuki won in this last episode and /v/ Yuki just won in the last scan.</br>  <br>I just want it to be done by KyoAni. Not any other studio. I want Ishihara directing the final season. I know we're not getting it but I prefer no sequel than any Haruhi not by Ishihara.</br>   that ending <br> 16 episodes of generic awkward misunderstandings and romantic tension for it to just go with the friends forever stick to the status quo bullshit </br>  <br>Is this your first anime?</br>  <br>Is the manga for this still going or is it done now?</br>  <br>still going</br>  <br>Just because it was obviously coming doesn't make it any less bullshit.</br>  <br>Thanks for spoiling that, I was about to pick this back up.</br>  <br>8 Volumes (Ongoing)<br>Vol 7 chapter 54 was the last translated chapter.</br></br>    Official soundtrack release when?  <br>That one whistle track is the best. Does anyone know the name of it?</br>  <br>I need the new version of this track, it was so good<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dbo<wbr>jb_C95cU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>New Unofficial Mega Mix for Yuki-chan when?</br>  I dropped the show after episode 10 was brilliant and felt like it was part of the original series, but then episode 11 was back to being boring as fuck in every aspect.<br><br>The one thing I probably liked most overall was the usage and remixes of the old OST. Shit was nostalgic and great.</br></br>   Haruhi asks Ryoko to put her hair up <br> It's done offscreen <br><br>I want KyoAni back.</br></br></br>  Will the OVA have Sasaki? This is very important.  <br>I wish.<br><br>I can but only wish.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope so too, I want to hear her voice.<br><br> And Kuyou as well. </br></br></br>   Kyon doesn't buy the mask for Yuki <br><br>They fucked up the perfect opportunity.</br></br>  <br>No.<br><br> NO! </br></br></br>  <br>He can go either way that's the thing. What a conundrum. He both wants to be at peace and excited.</br>  <br>I really want it, the melancholic tracks were amazing.</br>  <br>There are 5 possibilities: <br><br> OVA about summer homework <br>The summer festival is contained in exactly one manga chapter. The following chapter is about summer homework- Sasaki shows up on the final page of this chapter. <br>Considering that the summer festival chapter became an entire episode it's not impossible that the homework chapter could be an entire episode as well.<br>Whether or not Sasaki shows up in an OVA about homework is likely dependent on whether or not a second season has been greenlit; Sasaki is the lead-in to the next story arc.<br><br> Cultural Festival (Only option that guarantees Sasaki) <br>The Sasaki plot involves the cultural festival, which lasts for 10 chapters. I doubt they'll try to cover 10 chapters in a single episode (The 16 episodes covered 37 chapters). I also doubt they'd leave an OVA without a complete storyline, however.<br><br> Skip cultural festival <br>If they do skip the cultural festival, then the OVA will take place during December. It would be a little odd to end during summer break and continue during December. They'd also be skipping an important event between Yuki and Kyon.<br><br> Adapt cultural festival without Sasaki <br>This could probably fit into a single episode and they would still be able to cover the major events between Yuki and Kyon.<br>It would skip Yuki's jealousy towards Sasaki, but that's not entirely necessary for her development.<br><br> Anime-original episode <br>This one could also feature Sasaki, but I doubt the studio would risk taking such liberties on the character, considering that this series has such die-hard fans and she hasn't been animated.<br><br>That being said, the OVA comes out in October and the Sasaki stuff happens in October, so that may be an incentive to make the OVA about the cultural festival.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think 1 and 5 are by far the most likely to happen, and that depresses me, because it means that there's still a possibility of no Sasaki.</br>  <br>7/10 the worst score imaginable.</br>  <br>The OVA might also just be a montage of the summer events, with endless 8 bait.<br>That would be both hilarious and depressing.</br></br>  I want those 7 fucking hours of my life back  <br>Highly unlikely, she's not going to get her anime debut outside the main series unless it's to announce another season of the main series.<br><br>By a different studio.

Does this mean Tahkii slowly becomes more and more like stoic Yuki and more confident in her actions?</br>  <br>Oops forgot to spoiler</br>  who is this turkey terrorizer?  <br><br>I am, but I'm 10 episodes behind now.</br></br>  <br>Not more stoic but more confident, comfortable, and fun, at least around Kyon.<br><br/></br></br>  TAAKI a shit, best yuki should take over the body.  ASASUKA BEST GIRL  <br><br>The author seems to be mixing them both to a happy medium. Too bad it's a little bit too late. He already destroyed the hopes of quite a lot of the fanbase since the start.<br><br>I won't be surprised though if the Editor is at fault here. Since we know Puyo can write stoic Yuki character perfectly due to the Haruhi-chan series. And the Dissapearance Yuki-chan arc.<br><br>Should've slapped his Editor and say that Stoic Main Leads are amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Kyon would put in any effort to get close to a stoic girl. Only if Haruhi went to their school and forced them together, but if Haruhi was there she would be with Kyon instead.</br>  <br>The Dissapearance Yuki-chan arc is a good base point on how a Stoic character can attract Kyon.<br><br>Mystery and Intrigue.</br></br></br>  Why does she sit like that?  <br>Maybe her butt has recuperated.</br>  <br>From what?</br>    <br>I guess denwa is a meme in Japan too?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>This sequence seems familiar yet quite different.<br><br><br><br>Some japanese people broke their figurines and tore their LNs in protest of the Endless 8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you know, anon?<br><br>Although Japan is roughly a decade behind America culturally--<br><br>In terms of memes, Japan is ahead of America.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should study the Japanese meme market before I make my next investment</br>   changes from yukata to school uniform <br>WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?</br>    <br>You're dense, anon.</br>  <br>If they don't do that it would be difficult to understand that the Yuki in uniform is the other Yuki, not taaki.</br>  <br>BREEDING MATERIAL RIGHT THERE</br>  The characters and interactions in this are its saving grace.  <br>Maybe her butt has recuperated.</br>  <br>From what?</br>  I bet Haruhi wouldn't be so genki after a good hard fucking.  <br>Kyon wasn't speaking to yukata-Yuki; he wanted the other Yuki to hear his feelings.</br>  <br>DDL on mega or bust</br>  Why does she sit like that?  <br>But would she actually write a 13th novel? Unlike a certain someone?</br>  <br> implying Haruhi isn't writing the series about herself from another dimension </br>  <br><br>And she did take over for that few precious seconds. As evidenced by Tahkii not knowing what the fuck Kyon just said even though it can be heard thru the fireworks.</br></br>  <br>No, the fireworks were only silent for the viewers.<br>The other Yuki is dead and gone.</br></br>  If Puyo seriously tried and had the experience he has now, I think his art style could replicate the LN if not atleast the anime/manga of the main series.<br> Pic related is his recent twitter work</br>  <br>Itou pls.</br>  <br>Not necessarily, there's really nothing in the market suggesting Haruhi would be worth doing. It's just been too long. This Yuki-chan anime didn't sell well nor did it boost the manga. It's not because the nips are boycotting the show, it's because no one cares that much about Haruhi. Granted this is a spinoff, but still part of the Haruhi franchise. The best indicator would be to release a new novel and see how many buy it.</br>  <br>How the duck do you explain the change in uniform though?<br><br>That was blatantly shown. Uniform Yuki possessing Yukata Yuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Itou can return to drawing eroge:<br>http://i.imgur.com/QesB0I5.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/BLFFfI8.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/9zKOIbb.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/jAsdAEu.jpg<br>http://i.imgur.com/ZErL3Pf.jpg</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, you keep telling that to your self.</br>  <br>That should rather you.<br>Or simply learn what fanfiction is.</br></br>  <br>If Yuki's clothes spontaneously changed I think Kyon would be a little freaked out. There's nothing supernatural in this world.<br>The uniform was showing the viewers which Yuki Kyon wanted to share his feelings with.</br></br>  <br>Is it just me or did a very significant portion of this episode seem vaguely familiar?</br>  <br>I think it's just a problem on your end buddy</br>  <br>It showed that Alien Yuki took over for those few seconds.<br><br>It's not supernatural. Only multiple Personality Disorder tier.</br></br></br>   that suffering Haruhi   <br>Maybe her but recuperated</br>  <br> Fan fiction or fanfiction (also abbreviated to fan fic, fanfic or fic) is fiction about characters or settings from an original work of fiction, created by fans of that work rather than by its creator. It is a popular form of fan labor, particularly since the advent of the internet. <br><br>Sounds pretty fanfiction to me.</br></br></br>  <br>She deserved better.</br>  <br>fanfiction it is</br>  This Haruhi never showed any interest in Kyon what are you talking about?  <br>The term fan fiction in contemporary usage is used to refer to fiction written by fans for non-profit, purely as entertainment for themselves and other fans.<br>The person who wrote this was a professional working under commission. This is as much fan fiction as, say, A Memory of Light is fan fiction.</br></br>  <br>There were a few hints every now and then.</br>  <br>Dude, you can argue all you want but it is fanfiction.</br>  <br> My convenient definition of fanfiction is right, not the actual definition by dictionaries and wikipedia. </br>  <br>That wasn't a hint, that was nothing.</br>  <br>You're pretty dense anon.</br>  <br>It cannot be fan fiction by the very definition from Wikipedia posted in  since the author of it, Puyo, is not a fan but instead a professional who worked on the franchise even before his spinoff was greenlight.</br>  <br>He is not the author.<br><br>Fanfiction it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I missed the fucking Yuki's uniform change and even I spotted that. There was also the episode after Taakii came back, Haruhi talking with Kyon, remembering her first meeting with him, being kinda quiet.</br>  <br>There are numerous examples of novels that have gotten sequels by people who are not the original authors, and no one considers those mere fan fiction.<br>Your usage of the term fan fiction is not compatible with the general usage of the term.<br>Even the Wikipedia (since we already accepted Wikipedia as a legitimate source for the term fan fiction) article for Yuki-chan calls it a spin-off and not fan fiction: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_D<wbr>isappearance_of_Nagato_Yuki-chan</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>is this bait or are you actually not understanding this</br>  <br><br>Just stop. It is fanfiction.</br></br>    It doesn't matter if we call it fanfiction or not, the bottom line is that Yuki-chan is shit.  <br> was a good final episode. <br><br>Great final episode. Truth is out, Kyon x Yuki is canon.</br></br></br>  <br> Blue is actually orange because I say so </br>  <br>Wait a moment, let me edit the Wikipedia article.</br>   August 10 rebroadcast of Yuki-chan anime on AT-X <br><br>Is this a sign that something is coming? Why are they rebroadcasting it again so soon?</br></br>  I loved the ending. Yuki x Kyon is now canon. 8/10.<br><br>Several James Bond books were not written by Ian Fleming and aren't considered fanfiction...therefore, think what you want, but it's not fanfiction.</br></br>  <br>It's not fucking fanfiction you retard. It is a legitimate AU canon. The fact that it's being published through a recognized manga publishing company and has the approval of the author of the original work instead of being written online like a shitty web comic makes it official.</br>  Man fuck this. Just finish the goddamn books Tanigawa. He could probably wrap it all up in one more novel  <br>I liked it. 7.5/10</br>  <br>If Puyo seriously tried, he could replicate the writing of the LN. Tanigawa should just hand over the reins to him.</br>  <br>Haruhi saved it, 7.8/10</br>  <br>She has her main show. But seeing her so defeated by not fulfilling her childhood crush looks heart breaking.<br><br>Drowning herself in mindless entertainment at the moment with Asakura and Koizumi.  Which might lead to her discovering something </br></br></br>  <br>Are you sure it's a rebroadcast? Isn't that supposed to be the OVA?</br>  <br> Haruhi <br> not Asakura </br></br>  <br>Well the whole supporting cast then. The episodes purely about nagato were the dullest.</br>  <br>Except for the Disappearance Yuki-chan Arc right? That Nagato can save the whole ship from sinking too.</br>  <br>OVA is being bundled with the manga, not going to be broadcast.</br>  <br>He just wants to  walk her home gently </br>  <br>She was the cutest, though.</br>  <br>So Haruhi S2-esque surprised mix up with the rebroadcast?<br><br>It has to be Kyo Ani though... so unless they suddenly have a hidden schedule I won't be too thrilled.</br></br></br>  <br>From official anime website:<br><br>7月18日<br><br>8月10日（月）よりAT-XにてTVアニメ「長門有希ちゃんの消失」の再<wbr>放送が決まりました！<br><br><br>Google:<br>July 18 <br><br>August 10 from (Monday) at the AT-X was decided to re-broadcast of TV anime "Nagato Yuki-chan disappearance of"!</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Different Anon here but she didn't even come off as cute to me and I'm victim to loving anything moe. She came off as uncomfortably awkward most of the time, especially when interrupting the others fun in the earlier episodes.</br>  <br>It depends on how good the official release is. If it's all mixed up like the main series soundtrack was then I may be temped to do my own mix again and share it.

Overall its an alright series, Asakura a best.  <br><br> Releasing the two goldfishes and letting go <br><br>muh symbolism<br><br>Would still give her a hug.

No need to split hairs.</br>  <br>Basically the same, but that was not the song which played in the anime, that is why i pointed out the difference. Also because some other anons posted the same comment on this thread.</br>  Wait what, it's stopping at 16 episodes? Fuck.<br><br>I thought I had more time to enjoy this.</br></br>  HAHAHAHAHA Puyo ending Nagato in 3 more volumes<br><br>haruhi franchise is pretty much dead now</br></br>  <br>I still haven't watch the episode yet. Is the manga even worth reading?</br>  for something you beat a carpet with, that price is absurd.  <br>It is an infomercial.</br>  <br>I'm that anon from like a day ago, thanks!</br>      <br>6/10, very forgettable.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? By what he says in his twitter feed, he's going on with this until Volume 17. Have fun with S3 of Yuki-chan anon.</br>  <br>She really comes across as a retarded child in this spin-off. <br><br>Also Kyon's jap voice is creepy.</br></br></br>  <br>I would really be okay with that. I tend to enjoy anything Haruhi related like a scrub. Two more seasons of Yuki focus and best version of Ryoko? Hell yeah.</br>  <br>He might aswell go full shoujo, I want full pages of Yuki's overreacting face in extreme close-up.</br>  Haruhi and Kyon think almost exactly alike, and even this episode shows that they do. Seeing Haruhi BTFO is horrible; why does taaki moeblob win? Why can't we bring justice to this with S3?<br><br>Also, how big of a difference is the BD quality of this show to that of the TV series that had just finished? I'd rewatch the series just for Satelight BD quality.</br></br>  <br>Takki moeblob didn't win. Ayylien Nagato-lite won. Sort of. And we all know Haruhi is going to win in the main series. Why should she win in a spin-off that's literally about Yuki?</br>  <br>Because anything Yuki needs to die</br>  <br>Anon delivers. Thanks anon.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It was a good ride gentlemen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>8/10<br><br>More of characters and less monster of the week.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about? Haruhi is no monster.</br>  <br>Ah. Yes, I meant "less monster of the week" when compared to the original.</br>  Is 20 million yen a lot in nipland?<br>Because under some calculations, thats how much the BD made in the first week.<br>Also, is 7000 yen a bd box normal there?</br></br>  <br> Is 20 million yen a lot in nipland? <br>its more than you make in 10 years.</br></br>  <br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!yMswnBKR!uf3R<wbr>MywPzy1OX5nvkAx4fw<br><br>Here is the OST from the first BD volume if you want it. <br>Comes with drama track too.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>7000 is somewhat normal. Remember, BD releases are usually geared toward collectors.<br>Most Japanese anime Blu-Ray releases are pitched as Limited Collectors Editions with rather nice packaging, full-colour booklets, on-disc and pack-in extras, and sometimes various "first pressing", store-exclusive, or other mail-in bonus goods to try to entice people to collect. But, at the end of the day, I think most people who buy Japanese anime Blu-Rays do so because they want to support the show with their wallet. Since most late-night anime (like Yuki-chan) does not make its money back during its airing, it's the merchandise sales (like the expensive Blu-Rays) that allow the anime production committees to hopefully break even on production costs. It's really the evolution of the old OVA market, except they air the shows on TV as an advertising strategy.</br></br>  <br>Anon why do you have like 2 episodes worth of time within 2 separate tracks in there?</br>  <br>The aforementioned Radio and Drama tracks.</br>  <br>2nd Vol OST when? :^)<br>  Also great job anon.

And Haruhi-chan will fit the role, especially with the Sasaki reveal during the Yuki OVA so this is great timing for the haruhichan anime to reveal her as well and then   haruhi S3 </br></br></br>  <br>I'm betting that the Yuki-chan OVA will be a co-production between Satelight and KyoAni. As soon as it's ovee, Haruhi will then be returned to KyoAni hand and then they will do Haruhi-chan S2 and then Haruhi Main Series S3.<br><br>If KyoAni can do Amagi OVA out of the blue, so can Haruhi. New Haruhi will start off as Snowy Mountain Syndrome, since it's both important as an isolated entity and a bridge between future plot. Remember, Amagi was Kadokawa-KyoAni and so is Haruhu, so this is a good possibility.</br></br></br>  <br>Snowy Mountain Syndrome is good as an OVA too since   there'll be an onsen scene at that mansion for hot bods and lewd Mikuru :^) </br>  <br>End of this month with vol 2's release. <br>I'll rip and upload it when it comes in the mail.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Wish I could be this optimistic after pachinko</br></br></br>  <br>Never forget<br>  haruhi.com will come back up out of no where, and on it will be a video of a girl in Yuki cosplay with Minori Chihara's voice saying "She has returned" with instructions to find the remaining 70 frames.

I know that voice. Can't say I hate it but I expected it to be somewhat higher</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doffy still flapped his mouth but before he did Homing went to the local market and started babling about his life and how he was a new friendly neighbor who came from Mariejois.<br>Sounds like something he would do to be honest.</br></br>  <br> Doffy apologists <br>I'm not surprised</br></br>  Why is he so based?  <br> Can't say I hate it but I expected it to be somewhat higher <br> Not wanting the most manly voice ever so his dojikko routine is even more bizarre </br></br>  <br> 70 years old grandpa  <br>Seriously ? I wasn't put off by Ace's voice at all.<br>I don't think Corazon's voice is that offputting either but it'll take some getting used to. I did picture him with a higher, more nasal voice.</br></br></br>  <br>well he looks like a fucking clown I expected him to sound like one<br><br>not that I mind it. Jeez his voice is deeper than Doffy's</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people who don't want to be seen always wear the most suspicious looking hood ever ?</br>  <br>Cause he listens to what others say and thinks rationally. I'm all for his Blind Justice system. It seems so fucking fair.<br><br>He reminds me of Madara.</br></br></br>  <br> I wasn't put off by Ace's voice at all. <br>I think the endless cuts to him grunting "MMFJJDHDHDJJDGGRRRHHJ" in MF were the tipping point for me<br><br>Anyone still have that image by the way?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 70 year old grandpa voicing Ace. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kK3<wbr>LgCudlgY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>He's by far my favourite admiral, including Aokiji, especially stuff like arguing with Akainu</br>  <br> and thinks rationally. <br><br>bringing meteors down on yourself isnt the most rational thing.

Whatever the kind of fights he'll get into from now on it'll never be as intense as his revenge against Doffy.

His casting reminds me of older anime.</br></br>  <br>I got this off 4chan, so im still not a tumblr retard</br>  <br>Doffy's animu voice bothers me because his laugh is different from the mango</br>  <br><br>Hehe he's right now that I pay attention to it.<br>Look at the top right of your pic. It's watermarked. Moreover I'm pretty sure tumblr's gif limit used to be 500KB.</br></br></br>  <br>refer to what I said here<br/></br>  <br> I got this off 4chan <br>yes, from a tumblr user<br><br>the lesson here being, you cant exactly call someone out for using tumblr images when you dont know what they look like yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>1 of 2 rebutting you.</br>  <br>no it's not. Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example.</br>  <br> i'm not a tumblr retard, I'm just ignorant <br>Whatever makes you sleep better at night.</br></br>  <br>2 of 2</br>  <br>ok, I was just making shitty excuses, but my point stands tumblr is a shithole</br>  <br> tumblr is a shithole <br>while that's true, so is 4chan. Non-imagedump boards specifically<br><br>it's kind of a pot/kettle thing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off bitch.<br><br>Anyone care to give me the one piece 703 sub link?</br></br></br>  Anyone else notice that Oda sometimes seems more interested in the world than the characters these days? Since the timeskip it feels like there's been an up kick in flashbacks related to things like the history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, and fights going to members of the supporting cast that would've gone to a Straw Hat in any other arc.<br><br>There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions. I'm not sure I like this.</br></br>  <br>No, now fuck off.<br>If you can't find it by yourself, then you have nothing to do here.</br></br>  <br>I like the focus, but I also dislike that there's no focus on the straw hats. It's an exchange of sorts, the good overrides the bad, but I still wish we get more of the crew next arc.</br>  <br> Doffy doesn't really have a unique laugh, "fufufu" is just a common laugh onomatopoeia. Robin's is the same for example. <br>Do it's not you uncultured swine. Doffy's laugh is ffuffuffu, it has the sokuon while the generic onomatopoeia doesn't.</br></br>  <br>*No<br>Can't type tonight</br></br>  <br>https://www.google.co.uk/</br>  <br> .co.uk </br>  <br> since the time skip <br>Did the anime skip flashbacks, side stories, history and politics of the various islands and the pasts of side characters, because the manga has constantly had them pre skip too.</br></br>  <br> There were times in the current arc where I actually felt like the Straw Hats weren't the protagonists but just one of several equally important factions <br>That's exactly what they were though, it wasn't an impression. Law was, technically, the protagonist of this arc. He was the one who underwent the most conflict, he was the one who suffered the most, he was the one who got everything into motion because he was the one with the objective to kill Doffy and the motivation to do so in the first place. <br>Luffy by comparison ? He got his lunch from Rebecca. He was a side character. A side character who saved Law's ass and finished Doffy for good, but a side character none the less.</br></br></br>  <br> What are they even planning to do once they catch up <br>cant ever happen, they always go 1 chapter = 1 episode format. and sometimes, half a chapter to compensate for the oda breaks.</br></br>  <br>I said they seem to have increased, not that they weren't there. Skypiea in particular had a lot of that.</br>  <br>Yes it is, and i'm the faggot that posted that link</br>  <br>Yea I'm saying you're wrong though. There were more flashbacks per volume in the early story than the later.<br>Back then there was also more side story focus, though that's harder to count.</br></br>  <br>I'm going to miss him so much</br>  <br>why dont they just do a long filler arc ala bleach?<br><br>theres plenty of cover stories, even epecially important ones like jimbei's</br></br></br>  <br>Cover stories aren't THAT important though, after the characters reappear we get all the info necessary, in the end it's something to have fun weekly. Except for maybe the strawhat training ones before the timeskip.</br>  <br>Flamingo babies cute as fuck</br>  A previous iteration of this thread made me realize Hody was stronger than Lucci. I'm still kind of floored by that.  <br> Hody was stronger than Lucci <br>My brain refuses to accept this for some reason.</br></br>  Why Doffy's mom lost her blush in poverty?<br><br>Post Doffy mom.</br></br>  <br>My brain did for a while too, but the argument was since the pills supposedly double your power each time, Hody would have to be weaker than an ordinary civilian Fishman at base for his super form to be above Lucci.</br>  <br><br><br>He may have been stronger than PTS Lucci, but remember the guy isn't dead. Also, Doriki isn't really a good way to measure Lucci's strength, it only measured his physical strength as a human, no DF or Rokushiki power ups.</br></br></br>  <br> toei removed the scene where he was shirtless and bandaging himself up <br><br>Too lewd or do they just hate everything good</br></br></br>  <br>Not even in your dreams</br>  <br>Yeah, post-TS Lucci will certainly be stronger.<br><br>It just made me realize I'd been VASTLY underselling the timeskip gains.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>how could this have even possibly been in question<br><br>do you actually read this manga? in what world could lucci take anything that luffy threw against hody? lucci got rekt by a fucking jet gattling - no armament included</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was never in question that Hody was definitely tankier, but my thought was that since Lucci is faster and has a greater variety of techniques, he could pull a difficult win.</br>  <br><br> that since Lucci is faster <br><br>and where are you getting this from?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy defeated hody with his first attack jet stamp but he took steroids and recovered</br>  <br>its just hard to comprehend because of the different level of threat that each posed to luffy.<br><br>lucci was basically his equal at the time they were fighting and hody just got rekt. timeskip lucci would also likely wreck hody if his growth was anywhere near luffys</br></br></br>  <br>Lucci has Soru. Hody's just a big tank, but I'll admit he can throw water-bullets pretty well.</br>  Wait a sec...where is corazon post time skip?  <br><br>they arent talking about timeskip lucci - they are clearly talking about pre ts lucci<br><br>and it is fucking retarded to think that lucci would be anywhere near crackhead mode hody<br><br><br><br>the fight continued, stop talking about hodys strength as if it ended there - it does not matter how he got that strength - we are just talking about said strength compared to lucci<br><br>crackhead mode hody put up a fight against a timeskip luffy who trained with the first mate of gold roger - and tanked a good amount of his attacks AND broke his armament haki (which luffy admitted he needed to work on)<br><br>lucci fought a pre ts luffy and got out speeded by gear 2nd and out lasted<br><br>there is no comparison <br><br> b-but ts lucci... <br><br>no, that is not part of what those 2 idiots said</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What will happen to Bellamy?    <br>bones.</br>  <br>hopefully he'll make up with luffy and they'll go their seperate ways. but it kinda looks like he'll become the next nakama</br>  <br>Huh?<br><br>Post-timeskip, where is Donqixote Rocinante ?</br></br></br>  the episode showed one of doffy's eyes when he woke up<br><br>it was red</br></br>  Another weird fight I think about sometimes: post-TS Brook vs. pre-TS Jabra, the Tekkai expert. Could Brook break Tekkai? He did defeat a dragon whose skin was so tough that it ran face-first into a thick steel wall so hard the metal cracked, after all.  <br> a </br>  Threadly reminder that Sanji will die in a fascinating way.  <br> Throat cut by Anita Sarkeesian. </br>    <br>Marineford did something to Oda. The character interactions between the crew were fucking amazing in Sabaody, but in FI and PH they were pretty underwhelming. The part where they were going doing to FI was fun though.</br>  <br><br>wut u have to remember about brook is that his 'age' precedes rogers - hes literally the oldest pirate there is barring any other crazy df ability wank<br><br>he should have been able to shit on plenty of people way back then just because of his age factor in one piece power scaling <br><br>the issue is that he got turned into a sissyboy by moria and ryuuma abuse</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He was still powerful but not as powerful as when he attacked Shanks.</br></br>  <br>he's older than anyone sure, but he's basically fodder that aged. his one piece old age boost turned him from fodder into decent strength<br><br><br>plus one piece doesnt actually have an age boost, young WB would shit all over the marines but old whitebeard couldn't, maybe its the sickness though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the body swapping shenanigans in Punk Hazard were fun.</br>   Dressrosa arc for 2 years <br> rocinante not seen the entire time <br>lmao oda you are a pos.<br>You could have atleast done rocinante,law and luffy vs doflamingo</br></br></br>  <br>he wasnt going all out against shanks. unless you think shanks has surpassed roger</br>   Law's flashback <br> one of the only opportunities where filler could work <br> Doffy and fucking Bellamy get more original scenes <br> they suddenly switch back to 1 chapter per episode pacing right as the flashback starts <br> it feels like it's going by even faster after fucking months of 10-12 pages per episode <br><br>Normally I can laugh at how bad Toei is but I'm genuinely sad now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You...you truly don't know</br>  <br>theyre making bellamy stand more so that when he joins the crew its more believeable. they got inside knowledge from oda that hes joining so they spend more time on him<br><br>oh god i felt dirty writing that I hope it doesnt happen</br></br></br>  <br>By that point in time Whitebeard was already weaker than his prime</br>  <br>he's obviously baiting  i hope </br>  <br>If this isn't bait, you're almost as retarded as the Rebecca fag<br>  almost  </br></br>  <br>Even though I agree, he was still strong enough that it's absurd that three all out attacks to Blackbeard didn't even phase him beyond crying whereas Akainu had to flee.</br>  <br>Hody couldn't keep up with g2 luffy either, and he didn't tank any of luffys hits he took steroids that would make anyone even fodder recover instantly. Lucci put up a fight and nearly won hody got his ass kicked all over noah</br>  <br>i mean, this is basically how their first meeting is gonna go</br>  <br>And still the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br>I'm an anime fag, but idc if u spoil it, why isnt he in the final fight?</br>  <br>Forgot pic.<br>Aces Fire Spears are very similar to a magma fist, anyone vulnerable to internal organ incineration should at minimum be defeated if directly hit by that unless they have a special first aid like Doffy. Just Crocodiles hook KOd Luffy.</br></br>    <br>hes dead, its already been said anyways. he is the younger brother that doffy kills.</br>  <br> theyre making bellamy stand more so that when he joins the crew its more believeable. <br>How dare you make me read that with my own two eyes</br></br>  Posting this I found through a previous thread<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cir<wbr>LmTzDldk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>The reason this was possible is Brooke is a casual swordsman and a master musician.</br>  <br> young WB would shit all over the marines <br><br>Garp, Sengoku and Zephyr (all three) could defeat prime WB.</br></br></br>  <br>Uh, no, Prime WB = Roger.</br>  <br>He was murdered in cold blood by Doflamingo for being a Marine informant.</br>  <br>You don't think 3 marine admirals could defeat Roger?</br>  <br>Oh, all at the same time, you mean? Not sure then.<br><br>Though 72-year-old, face-melted WB destroyed one Admiral.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but no they could not. Roger volunteered to be executed, don't forget.<br>At the end of One Piece Luffy might say about Smoker, "he cornered me many times" but all readers will know Luffy became overwhelmingly stronger as the story progressed.</br></br>  So /a/, post what your face would look like if, at the end of the series, another pirate crew beat the Straw Hats to the One Piece.    There are people that think Zoro can take Fujitora.    <br>I used to dislike the most recent One Piece op. It's grown on me and now I actually listen to it fully instead of skipping it.</br>  <br> MFW I realize some of those people are probably on this board </br>  <br>its hard to reason with the *insert character* fags. Just like that guy in the earlier thread who insisted kid would murder shanks. They don't listen when you tell them why theyre wrong</br>  <br>I'm honestly amazed at all the wank that came out of Zoro pushing Fujitora back a few feet.</br>  <br>me too, i'm kind of hoping Fujitora wrecks Zoro's shit at some point just to laugh</br>  <br>since fuji's a swordsman does that mean that mihawk is above admiral level?<br><br>since shanks is a swordsman does that mean he's stronger than a yonko</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>How would Fujitora defeat Zoro?<br>With gravity? Zoro broke out easier than Shichibukai Law.<br>With swordsmanship?<br>There are people on this board who believe Fujitora would defeat Mihawk trained Zoro in swordsmanship?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora openly admitted he was dangerous.<br>Fuji may also be a junior admiral in some capacity, and not as strong as Kizaru or Akainu, since his appointment was urgent.</br></br>  <br> 128287090 <br>just because he trained with him doesnt mean he reached his level of skill</br></br>  <br>Mihawk is, IMO, the best "only" swordsman.<br><br>Fuji and Shanks have other powers as well.</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks and Mihawk only dueled back when Shanks was a rookie or mid-level.<br><br>Shanks gave up any hope of being best swordsman when he lost his arm.</br></br></br>  <br> Survive the very same attack Fujitora used against fodder <br> Would totally trash an admiral guys believe me <br><br>Some people, some people.</br></br></br></br>  What ever happened to that chef guy? Wasn't there like a cook or something?  I'm of the opinion that Magellan is likely above all the Warlords, since corralling them should they go rogue is probably in his job description.  <br> hyperbole the post <br>I didn't say Zoro would easily defeat Fujitora, I asked how Fuji would beat him. Your answer so far is "but he's a admiral" and it is shit.</br></br>    <br>that can't be true, magellan and shiryu were said to be equals, and shiryu is a swordsman, meaning mihawk is stronger than him.</br>  <br> calling it Blind Justice because he is blind </br>  <br>Gravity, swordsmanship, haki, etc. Admirals are complete fighters, if Fujitora couldn't fill the shoes of the likes of Kuzan and Akainu, they might as well just promote any random VA, anyone who can read the flow of the story know it's too early for Zoro to be on the same stage as an Admiral, if you want real factual evidence you're in the wrong place discussing the wrong subject.</br>  <br> hyperbole the post <br>If you're going to meme then do it correctly. You claim Zoro can take Fuji but your only reasoning is "because I say so" and it's shit.</br></br>  <br> Law <br> Fodder <br>Don't you remember how Law had to wait till Fujitora was distracted, to use his op as fuck DF to escape?<br>Zoro felt the gravity and made Fujitora release it by attacking him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> read the flow of the story <br>It is 3 months to revery. Zoro trained under Mihawk for a longer period of time than his entire journey and all his fights on Luffys crew.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Fujitora the first person to make Zoro bleed since the timeskip?</br>  <br>I'd lol if Mihawk's only been the best since Shiliew was locked up.</br>  <br>I believe he was referring to when Fujitora made a giant hole in the restaurant.</br>  <br>But Law didn't want to go head to head with an admiral. His goal was Doffy and the factory and shit. <br>If he fights and admiral, which he probably wouldn't win regardless, he'd be trying to go up against Doffy. And he'd lose for sure.</br></br>  <br>Magellan was explicitly stated to be stronger than Shiliew (how do you think he beat him and locked him up in the first place?)</br>  <br>I'm not sure how that attack was weaker than what was used on Law, seeing as the hole is a representation of the force of gravity used.<br>I'm also not understanding how Zoro easily countering it proves Fuji would defeat him.</br></br>  <br><br>Well, Magellan wouldn't be the one to capture the warlords. The warlords will be restrained with Sea Stone anyways.<br><br>Mihawk is the only person I'd say Magellan would have a tough time against otherwise, but if he's ever captured he wouldn't have his swords with him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ZoroSmiling.png </br>  <br> pretending there are lower levels in one piece </br>  <br> Zoro trained under Mihawk <br><br>So? He's not Mihawk yet, and probably not even close (Blame DB and it's shonen logic of real fighting &gt; training) Vista got the seal of approval of Mihawk and even then he was hopeless against Akainu, Kizaru was having the upper hand against the Dark King with only swordsmanship, that speak tons on Fujitora who's main weapon seems to be a sword, and even then he still have gravity. Sure as hell Zoro is no easy feat for anyone after TS, but on the grand scheme of things there are still both, stronger people and stronger swordsmen.</br></br></br>  <br>I think he'd have a very tough time against Mihawk and Kuma, but defeat all the rest handily. Probably easily in the case of Moriah, who was the weakest.</br>  <br> that guy in the earlier thread who insisted kid would murder shanks <br><br>im positive that guy didnt give a shit about whether or not Kid could kill Shanks<br><br>Some people really do come here just to have someone to argue with</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The french guy? He left when he found himself a Suger Momma</br>  <br>She dumped him for Usopp though.</br>  <br> thinking I mean Violet </br>  <br><br><br>This is no DBZ, Shiryu presented the same treat as Magellan, but their fighting style is completely different, Magellan just needed to fill a room with poison for him to defeat Shiryu, and his ultimate poison made the use of swords quite useless too.</br></br></br>  <br>Zoro "easily" broke though the same attack Fujitora used on some shitter pirates in a restaurant. I'm not seeing how Zoro can match up to him yet. You bring up Law was just shitty reading skills since he isn't fodder.</br>  <br>Funny enough, Moria would have the upper hand against Magellan compared to Mihawk, I don't see how poison could affect Doppelman, while Mihawk touching Magellan would still infect the sword and then Mihawk body.</br>  <br>presumeably armament haki can counter magellans poison otherwise he literally has to touch you to win<br><br>still not as op as sugar's touch to win</br></br></br>  <br>Did you read the start of Zoro's training? He defeated Human drills which had copied Mihawk's sword style. Mihawk assumed he had lost.<br>Fuji is based but he will still have to fight Zoro if he follows orders.<br><br>It is stated by Mihawk's that he ALWAYS imbues his blades with haki.<br>This means that at Baraty, Mihawk only won because Zoro did not have haki, resulting in 2 of his 3 swords being broken. The human drills were a army of Mihawk level swordsman sans haki, it is why he accepted Zoro as his disciple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moriah is a hard character to quantify, really. He's explicitly the weakest Warlord (may or may not be counting Crocodile at that point, though), but he's mastered his Fruit to a degree not even many much stronger characters have.</br>  <br> shitty reading skills <br>Who has challenged Zoro as a swordsman post skip?<br>He immediately but Fujitora on the defensive.<br>Zoro is stronger than Law.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The human drills were a army of Mihawk level swordsman sans haki <br><br>don't do this to you anon</br></br></br>  <br>If that was the case than there'd easily have been plenty of jailbreaks from ID, moreover you'd think the escapees like Jinbe and Croco-boy wouldn't even need to run from Magellan and just 1-hit him.<br><br>Has Oda ever confirmed if BnH means you don't make contact? Like if Luffy grabbed Akainu's magma fist, would he still feel the heat?</br></br></br>  so why did crocodile save ace and luffy (from akainu)?<br><br>was it cause he was getting back into the pirate spirit of "fuck the marines" or was he grateful to luffy for getting him his groove back<br><br>Do you think oda has plans for croc considering he showed up in the newspaper cora was reading? oda stated he was a big time rookie and had the same dream as luffy when he was younger, but then the defeat to WB crushed him. <br><br>He presumeably got a strength boost at marineford (fighting doffy, akainu, jozu, mihawk, alabasta luffy could not do that) because he got his "ambition" back. SInce he follows his dream again he is stronger</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The monkey imitating Mihawk was only in the anime, anyway.</br>  <br>Oh, Alabasta Croc was definitely way stronger than Alabasta Luffy.<br><br>Luffy attacked his weak point for massive damage.</br></br></br>  <br>I kinda hope but it would still be a stretch of what CoC truly is, an armor, and even in full armor you still have a human body beneath, Law stated there's simply no way to protect your body from the inside, so Magellan poison might as well be still a treat to Haki users.</br>  <br>Does anyone else feel like there's going to be tension within the SH crew? I really feel like Zoro has put in zero to no effort in every major fight thus far (while Luffy's gone balls to the wall) only for this to be a major point in the future. Regardless of what power-up Luffy is always hiding, it still stands that Luffy has gotten much more injured and collapsed after each fight (like Hody and Doffy), while Zoro is clearly fine each time. <br>Can we really expect to go for the entire latter half of One Piece without having any drama between the Straw Hats, like the whole deal with Usopp, Robin, even Nami way early on? And I'm not talking about potential future crew, I mean current crew (despite the whole "train for my captain!!" timeskip resolve).</br></br>  <br> Zoro is stronger than Law <br><br>pls stop</br></br></br>    <br> moving the goalpost from "real fighting." Look how Rayleigh trained Luffy. King Kong Punch in Gear 4 was needed to defeat the animals on the island he trained on. It was strong enough to KO Doffy. </br>  <br>Are you implying Zoro's ALREADY beaten Mihawk?<br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAAAA!</br></br></br>    <br>One Piece Episode 702 - Nothing Happens</br>  <br>Just let him be, he believe anyone with sword is automatically below Zoro, I don't blame him thou, this is Oda's fault for spoon feeding Zoro since the TS.</br>  <br>I actually consider Pica a pretty difficult fight. Zoro had to ask for help, not once but twice.</br>  <br>one piece timeskip in a nutshell</br>  <br>I think any dissention will be coming from the new members. Which is maybe why Oda is introducing them at all<br><br>I doubt anyone current will have Usopp level issues at this point. Robin's already done, Franky has never had issues to begin with and Brook has already given himself to Luffy.<br><br>I can't imagine anyone earlier having something to get worked up over. With new member, we get the chance for clashes. Zoro with Kin'emon for obvious reasons, Jinbe with Nami(and therefore Sanji), Momonosuke with Luffy because D vs. 'celestial dragon' lol</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>now don't kid yourself, you may be a hardcore zorofag but you are right about some things, pica was an easy fight, the only "hard" part was transportation</br>  <br>Do you just make shit up to argue? I implied that Mihawk was capable of training Zoro up to fight an Admiral in 2 years if Zoro was capable of cutting steel 2 months into his pirate journey with only memories of a sensei.<br>Zoro won't lose a sword fight against anyone but Mihawk or above.</br></br>  <br>Chopper and Robin still haven't had their "Xth Person" chapters yet, just to note.<br><br>I speculate Chopper will get an offer from Kaido's crew as a powerful Zoan, and Robin will consider becoming a full-time Revolutionary.</br></br></br>  <br> therefore with sanji  <br><br>fucking whiteknight</br></br></br>  <br>he wont lose, WHEN HE ACTUALLY FIGHTS THEM<br><br>right now zoro would lose to fuji in an all out fight, which is why they wont have an all out fight, skirmishes at best.</br></br></br>  <br>Not the same guy.<br><br>I actually find Zoro quite boring, but I enjoyed his fight with Pica.<br><br>Monet fight sucked though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are just assuming would lose abased on a title "Admiral" and despite evidence that Zoro started the fight on equal footing.<br>vs Mr.1 zoro started "this guy is literally drilling my chest and can't be cut"</br></br>  <br>If you edit a toilet under Zoro it look like he taking a shit.</br>  <br>I'd always seen Oda to carve a marble statue and polish it over the years, not someone who'd put Zoro on pedestal and with a stainless steel plaque titled "Badass". <br>In fact, ever since Sanji's thing with Vergo and the difference between Luffy and Zoro's exertion and damage each battle, the space between the monster trio really feels like it's been rearranged and broadened. Makes me sad if this is just Fairy Tail levels of "muh husbando so cool" fanservice as opposed to foreshadowing or something.</br></br>  <br>I see what you did there</br>  <br>The Straw Hats do seem to be the crew with the smallest gap between the Captain and the next best guy.</br>  <br>It has been several years since the skip.</br>  Post some "oh shit" moments.  Doffy father isn't really a bad guy but he sure is naive.  <br>I was going to say that Luffy didn't lose a fight once until Croc, then I realized it's been longer since the timeskip started to now than the beginning of the manga to when Luffy first fought crocodile.</br>    <br>i think it's less Zoro getting special treatment and more Sanji becoming the butt monkey<br><br>that combined with way too many new characters being introduced, some of which may or may not be joining, is messing with the classic dynamic<br><br>Jinbe joining makes them a Monster Quad. Kin'emon gives Zoro someone new and more equal(sword vs sword) to fight with. Bellamy might be an interesting plaything for Sanji. It doesnt help that Sanji hasnt been seen for two years so Zoro gets more screentime so its hard to tell what's going to happen or really how their strengths are going to settle<br><br>Hell Sanji hasnt had a fair fight yet. He's either way stronger or being put up against Doffy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I also think it's entirely possible Franky's closer to Sanji than Sanji is to Zoro.    <br>every translation I see of this page is different. I have to wonder what weirdass wording Kuzan used<br><br> Pardon me, Buddy <br> Sorry Bro <br> Excuse me, Young Man </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's also incorrect.<br>Luffy lost to Buggy at Logue Town.<br>He was incapacitated by Arlong but rescued by Sanji as well.</br></br></br>  Was I the only guy that noticed Pandaman?<br><br>You guys even watch this shit?</br></br>    <br>oh shit, why was Gladius watching Luffy?</br>  <br>you think Sanji fell that far behind? They seemed on equal footing when they had their reunion fight on Sabaody</br>  <br>I think the first one sounds most appropriate, personally. The third could be viable but too formal maybe.</br>  <br>Sanji could at best tie Vergo, but Zoro defeated Pica, who was equal in rank. Maybe slightly weaker.</br>  <br>I wonder what roiding Lucci would be like</br>  <br>How strong even was Vergo though? All of his fights before Law OP's him were shit<br><br>I mean taking out Smoker isnt really a measure and all before that he fought fodder. Perhaps Vergo would have wrecked Zoro but we'll never know</br></br></br>  <br>Hina looks and awful lot like Bonney<br><br>Is it just the hair plus sameface?</br></br></br>  <br>Vergo and the other Seats were IMO even with a typical Vice Admiral.</br>    <br>Vergo WAS a vice admiral.</br>  <br> top hat <br> bow staff <br>Nice</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for drawing the arrow sherlock</br>   Mr. Prince <br> Not a prince. </br>  LAW IS A "D."JUST LIKE LUFFY AND BLACKBEARD  <br> Law's sister was a D. too <br> yet she died crying like a little girl </br></br>  <br> Doflamingo getting beat up by Pandaman <br><br>Truly the worst childhood.</br></br></br>  <br>Welcome to forever ago?</br>  <br>I dont think that applies to children</br>  <br> implying she won't pull a Sabo </br>  <br>Do you only watch the anime?

What am I forgetting?</br>  <br>sorry, I thought you were saying sabo was at marineford with dragon</br>  <br> marineford <br><br>you fuckers are scaring me tonight<br><br>where the hell did you get Marineford from?

I didn't see that you guys were talking about luffys in logue town</br>  <br>Hard to enjoy the manga if you don't actually read it.</br>  <br> pretty difficult fight <br>wtf were you reading, if pica would have stopped moving around for one goddamn second zoro would have one shotted him like he eventually did anyways</br></br>  <br>zoro was aroused by kuina when they were younger, at least he was embarassed by her breasts. hes kuinasexual, only able to get it up for her.</br>  <br> Do more stuff like this in the future. </br>  <br> zoro was aroused by kuina when they were younger, <br><br>He was like 6 years old. Zoro only gets it up for swords and booze</br></br></br>  god damn look how boss these 2 look, with mr1 lightning crocs cigar.<br><br>I want to see crocodile again in the new world</br></br>  Will Luffy's hair turn red when he goes to gear 4?  <br>Enel on the moon was pretty important. Wapol's was also to a lesser extent, because wapometal was referenced in the story.</br>  <br>What if the rhinobros are actually guys who took Smile?</br>  <br>i think by this point zoro knows how to measure power levels and doesnt underestimate ppl like he did the first time he fought mihawk, hes learned his lesson again after running into aokiji, he wouldnt have attacked fuji if he thought he didnt stand a chance</br>  <br>I never noticed Daz's hand. Guess I should have<br><br>Poor Daz is so underrated</br></br></br>  <br>Has it ever changed color?</br>  <br>hippos<br><br>you mean hippos<br><br> I think it's perhaps time for you to get some rest </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think he underestimated Mihawk? I don't think he ever had that problem.</br>  <br>sabo</br>  <br> I'm a mach 20 speedreader so I don't pay attention to the detail sometimes. <br>But how did you miss that? It was a pretty big deal, unless you literally just look at the pictures and move on. Corazon had a whole conversation with Law about the Ds and gods afterwards.</br></br>  <br>the very first time they fought? mihawk says it himself, he couldnt tell the difference between their levels, hes capable of that now</br>  <br>I think that was anime only. zoro's flashback was literally like a page long in the manga and didn't have all that fluff.</br>    <br>Different guy here who reread the Zoro flashback yesterday. It's like four pages in Chapter Five.</br>  <br> these are the kind of people posting in these threads </br>  <br><br> there are probably more than one person like this on this thread  <br> most of them are talking about shit they don't even understand or never heard of </br></br></br>  <br>oh, my bad. i just remember it being pretty short. did it have the zoro-being-aroused-by-breasts scene?</br>  <br>someone calls himself a speedreader<br> getting baited this hard and not even knowing </br></br>  <br>So, are the monkeys Zoro fought on Mihawks island stronger than Lucci?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Hehe.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They're not canon.</br>  <br>We've.had.</br>  <br>I'd give Oda too much credit if he actually planned it THAT far ahead. <br>Nobody's that crazy.</br></br>  <br> thinking he couldn't stop a few meteors </br>  <br>Was Alvida the first boss of the series or was the Hand-Axe Taicho Morgan guy?</br>  <br>Oda planned him little before marineford, so that's just a coincidence</br>  <br>Morgan was during Zoro. <br>Alvida was during Coby.<br><br>Coby came first.<br>Anime starts out differently than manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the problem is that he didnt<br><br>going 'oh yeah, the strings...' wasn't exactly a shining example of his rationality</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed - but even if they were, does it matter? That non-cannon Mihawk Humandrill is essentially one of the beasts Luffy needed to learn Haki, and elephant gun no less, to defeat. There are dumb animals in the human world who were inherently stronger than pre-timeskip Lucci.<br><br>Even if that turns out to be Sabo in the plaza, the only explanation I could ever accept is if Oda was rereading his work, noticed the design and thought it'd be interesting enough for Sabo's design. Is there any source that shows the longest amount of time that Oda as planned ahead (not something like "One Piece since chapter 1 to end of series", more like "Tontatta and Noland" kind of stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>anime started with Coby as well.</br>  <br>Yes, but that doesn't change that the anime started differently.</br>  <br>Are you the same faggot who thinks information relayed through dialogue isn't true and only info explicitly confirmed by Oda is canon?</br>  <br>Why the fuck do you /a/ fags post in this thread for if do not know anything about the manga</br>  <br>Rayleigh was foreshadowed fairly early on, though.</br>  <br>Uh?

I hope that faggot dies.</br>  <br>Zoro's scoping the choice ass m8</br>  <br>I see. Okay, sounds somewhat plausible. Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>In swordsmanship and Strength I'd say Zoro would win. Fuji used a gravity devil fruit to push him down in an off guard attack when Zoro was attacking Doffy. It's implied we don't know who is stronger.<br><br>I'm kind of thinking they may be on the same level, and that Fuji may very well join the crew as the counterpart of Aokiji joining Blackbeard.

I feel like I've been waiting forever.  <br>Zoro's swords are much more powerful than Anubis so he could probably break it easily.<br>That is, if he didn't fuck around. If Anubis was smart and didn't seem threatening so it could memorize his moves, it could be a tough fight.<br>But it's still perfectly beatable.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don´t remember daz bones looking like a ball with legs</br></br>  Why exactly did Roger give himself up? Why not live the rest of your live in peace with your mates?  <br>Wasn't he dying already? He probably wanted to give the next generation something to strive for or some bullshit</br>  <br>Yeah, that's what was implied. But why not do it any other way than just surrendering to the marines? He could've just made an announcement about One Piece. You know, being the pirate king and all that.</br>  <br>Yeah, he wanted to give inspiration to a new age, and so make someone find the one piece.

I seem to remember panels always showing him with a mug in the left hand.</br>  <br>I wonder what in the hell Akainu is fighting that has him all fucked up.</br>  <br> Garp <br>I expected nothing less</br></br>  Is he the most retarded character in One piece ?  <br>Well the fact that he has his sword on his right side does indicate that he is left handed too, so yeah he did lose his slashing arm.</br>  <br> saying that yet posting his cute smile before he died <br>You have no heart anon. But yeah, he was naive. Can't blame him though, since he was sheltered for most of his life.</br></br>  Gin has been dead for several years in-story.  <br><br> no one cares </br></br>  <br><br>heart = pure<br>intentions = good<br>execution = absolutely horrible and clueless</br></br></br></br>  <br>  BB crying <br>I never realized I wanted his flashback this badly, but I guess I'll have to wait until end game</br></br>  <br><br>The problem with oda is that most of his flashbacks are fucking boring, because it's always insert characters like princesses, dwarves, and warriors that nobody gives 2 fucks about.<br><br> tfw no kuzan vs sakazuki battle showcase <br><br>He could've spent at least ONE PAGE showcasing some moves</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his wife is dead because he was dumb <br> his 2 sons have been abused every days . <br> his family eat garbage every day for survive. <br> Without doffy haoshoku haki , his entire family would be exterminate. <br>He really deserve his execution.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Drake as a kid inconsistent with his background, seeing how we now know he was the son of a pirate and he didn't join the Marines until he escaped the Birdcage at 19?</br>  <br>here's your reply :)</br>  <br>He will show the battle, anon. He has to</br>  <br>his father was a marine before he became pirate, same as drake. <br><br>he followed exactly in his fathers footsteps, his father apparenty was really nice as a marine then became a bitch one he defected.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm talking about the execution of his ideas...</br></br>  <br>His father was a marine before he became a pirate, speedreader.</br>  <br>clearly he has someone else in mind</br>  <br>what the dong is up with Kizaru reading science books</br>  My favorite scene lasted less than one second and the books lost their pretentious names but at least it looks good.  <br>I'm pretty curious about why he doesn't have a crew. Did he have one before? <br><br>I adore Perona, Zoro and Mihawk together. It's like Mihawk suddenly became a dad and then his oldest son went away to surpass him. <br><br>Perona went back to Thriller Bark, right? According to a cover story? I wanted her to stay with Mihawk. Like a cute daughter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, missed it because it was in the SBS. That's pretty big info he released there.<br><br><br>lol speedreader because of not going out my way to check the SBS for the off-chance something important is revealed in it, okay buddy</br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad someone else likes this scene, too! Doffy looks so eager to teach his little prodigy. Or is it just me who thinks that?<br><br>I wonder what Doffy taught him though? Scheming 101?</br></br></br>  <br>All of them were innocent kids once.</br>  <br>Aww Magellan <br><br>light m8</br></br></br>  <br> lol speedreader because of not going out my way to check the SBS for the off-chance something important is revealed in it, okay buddy <br>Confirmed speedreader, it was mentioned in the manga. Kill yourself, and stop blaming me for having an attention span.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, where then, cancer boy?</br>  <br>Pic related.</br>   check SBS on a whim <br> find out Crocodile is 46 <br> he fought Whitebeard after becoming a Shichibukai <br>Neat.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah aparently he had the same kinda journey as luffy, then got rekt by WB and lost his ambition, ala moria. maybe moria will get his groove back just like croc did</br>  I wish someone would ask about trebol's fruit in an SBS so we could get the official word on if its parmecia or not, and what was up with ussop cutting him  <br>Zoro also appeared to slice one of the Meowban brothers in half; probably the same sort of trick.</br>  This weeks animu was so ockteasing, it hurts.<br>They animatd Doffy's dream sequencce fairly decently, than the rest of the episode is literally a slideshow. Last week's episode got my hopes up and it looks like recently they're experimenting with some intresting things, but it turns out the show still suffers from the usual problems. Toei is back to making shit.</br>  <br>Wait so Crocodile and Moriah are ghosts of their former selves?</br>  <br>Of course. Crocodile looks like he's back to his former self though.</br>  <br><br>rekt</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2nk<wbr>o6o_EZ2o</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>Yeah, that's my bad. That's on me cancer boy. Y'all have a good night.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakazuki? Nah man. Sakazuki destroyed Whitebeard, literally.</br>  Will they ever be important again bros?  <br>I wouldn't say Sakazuki destroyed Whitebeard jut as I wouldn't state the contrary. I thing WB was having it, but regardless both of them hit each other pretty fucking hard</br>  <br>yes, they probably couldn't even use haki from being so buttblasted</br>  <br>just* think*<br><br> forgive me, I just woke up </br></br></br>  <br> fuji had trouble with sabo who had just eaten a df, zoro stands a reasonable chance against him <br>No he didn't. It was explicitly stated that he was holding back against Sabo and was just using their "fight" as an excuse for why he wasn't pursuing the likes of Doflamingo. Even then, he came out perfectly fine while Sabo was bruised and battered up.</br></br>  <br>Help me Doctor.

No, this is.  New material from the exhibition.  fuck off  So hey, I don't read the manga and didn't pay much attention to the threads, but I'm still curious - whatever happened with the NTR in the end? Whose kid was Salad? Did Sakura ever fuck Sasuke?  <br> Sarada is and always be Sasuka and Sakura's daughter <br> She was born in Karin's hideout, where she keep something, I don't know <br> Suigetsu used something wrong that make it looks like she was Karin's daughter <br> tfw misunderstanding <br> Karin also give Sarada the glasses <br> she is friend with Sakura and want Sasuke to be happy so that's why she helped them </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So it was all a misunderstanding? Bummer.</br>  <br>What a shame.<br><br>It would've been much more interesting if Sakura was infertile or something.</br></br></br>  <br>New trailer when</br>  <br>What about Metal Lee's one?<br>And we need TL Anon for this one</br></br>   sakurafags got so blasted by sacuckera that they got kishi's manga canned and retconned salad being karin's daughteru and sasgay not giving a shit   <br>I get that feeling too, i mean WSJ let him getaway with NH but this time it seems they forced him to change the ending</br>  <br>Yeah basically Karin help deliver salada and the item used to test who her mother was, was actually salada umbilical cord. So it was just kishi and his forced, unneeded drama.</br>  karin is the cuck  <br>We're talking about the man who made TNJ a thing and had obito become the coolest at the end, so he pulling this and having Sakura really be the mother is exactly the thing kishi does. Kishi isn't the type to do something crazy he pretty much keeps it nice and safe.</br>  <br> Kishi isn't the type to do something crazy he pretty much keeps it nice and safe. <br><br>Yea this above all. That's why I'm butthurt at BoltxHimawari never ever being a thing. I hope Salad fucks off to inojinn or someone else too.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah<br>kishi is a hack</br></br>  <br>What does WallStreetJournal have to do with Naruto?</br>  <br>Kishi wont dare to do that</br>  <br>he meant Weekly Shonen Jump anon</br>  <br> Naruto is a genetical meatgrinder <br><br>christ, minatos genes are like a bucket of paint</br></br></br>   Still no HD (JAP) The last movie   <br>3 days left for jap BDs<br>howewer US release will be on october</br></br>  <br>She moved on from him without ever having a relationship, got herself a respectable STEM job and is probably fucking Suigetsu on the side.</br>  <br>Metal Lee's mother is pointed with a ????<br><br>Which reinforces that it's not TenTen.</br></br></br>  <br>Wrong.<br><br>Karin surprisingly ended up maturing and moving on from Sauce romantically.</br></br></br>  <br>Her face in the end implied that she still had feelings for him.</br>  <br>Not being a slave to your emotions is about as adult as you can be.</br>  <br><br>While saying "She wants Sasuke to be happy" and continuing with her life along with her freak colleagues.</br></br>  <br>In the novel tenten said she wasn't going to get married or have kids so you can cut that idea out</br>  <br>Naw himawarai too good for bolt bitch ass and so is salada, he needs someone like chocho. Hopefully my dream comes true and metal Lee is a lolicon and gets himawarai</br>  <br>Yeah I know the most crazy thing kishi did was kill off neji and he did that shit for no reason</br>  <br><br>Reminder that Kishi is still a Rookie in the eyes of all mangakas and the industry<br> Also, has Oda made other manga before OP? </br></br></br>  <br>Moving on does not imply killing your feelings forever and ever. It just means that you realize some things are not meant to be and people are better off without each other sometimes.</br>  <br> and is probably fucking Suigetsu on the side <br>Atop her desk, of course.</br></br>  <br> dat shirt and tie <br>There's no full art of adult Karin is there because damn</br></br>  <br>Have you ever heard the phrase "if you love something, let it go?"<br><br>She wants the edgy faggot to be happy. If that's being "married" to Pink Shit, then so be it. And really, considering what their relationship is, I'd say she dodged a bullet.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's /fa/ as fuck, hair aside.<br><br><br>It's a shame the decent clothing Sakura had was in the Last</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ボルトの可愛い妹 <br>Incest route, make it happen Kishi.</br></br>  <br>She still looks the same, Skrillex cut notwithstanding.</br>  <br><br>Everytime</br></br>  <br>Salad's been outed as the childhood friend in that family tree so she's out of the running.</br>  <br>Being the frustrated housewife of the village, I bet she's hyper jealous of all the attention hinata's tatas gets from the teenage ninja boys.</br>  <br>And he even said he regretted that.</br>  <br>And sibling incest is plausible?</br>  <br>I don't think Sakura gives a shit about teenage boys or anyone who isn't Sasuke in that way.<br><br>And Hinata is her good friend, she even helped her hook up with her annoying little brother Nardo.</br></br></br>  <br> Kishi had Sakura chase after Sausage while 9 months pregnant <br> if not for Karin she and/or her daughter might have died <br> with Karin's help she probably gave birth in some damp, dark underground facility smelling of mold, with Orochimaru's weird experiments that would make Lovecraft upset arranged neatly on the shelves <br>I am truly unsure whether that's worse than being cuckolded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Salad doesn't like Boruto. She'll probably fall for Mizuki.</br>  <br>Doubt it. I think he is on par with Oda now.<br>OP just drags too much.</br></br>  <br>The viz translation said they were traveling together</br>  <br>No, I'm pretty sure SS was his intention all along, you just want to believe otherwise.</br>  <br> Nurutu and Hinata are the parents of Burutu and Himawari <br><br>Holy shit no fucking way!</br></br></br>  <br> Travelling when you're 9 monthes pregnant. <br>This isn't better. Every other female has the decency and intelligence to stay in the village when pregnant. <br>The thing is I don't think kishi even meant to make sakura look as bad as she did, he's just that shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It was. He said that two of the members of Team Seven will become a couple eventually, those were Sasuke and Sakura. This was years ago.</br>  <br> Mizuki <br>Isn't he both dead and a tiger? <br><br><br>Why do you think she's concealed her powerlevel? The boys have just hit puberty, and it'd be mean of her to tease them like that.<br><br>Hell, why do you think Himawari's so bundled up all the time now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that really is the case then it's because he has only made one.</br>  <br>I mean the bishounen dude who is a member of their team.</br>  <br>Well, is not like everyone in Japan have read the ending right?</br>  <br> implying he won't be getting a taste of chocolate </br>  <br>Naruto wouldn't have become Hokage if it weren't for him.</br>  <br> all the attention hinata's tatas gets from the teenage ninja boys. <br>Does she? Other than Toneri no one really showed interest in Hinata throughout the entire manga.</br></br>  <br>Did he really?</br>  <br>What an awful filler. Evil guy transformation is a tiger? bullshit</br>  <br>Nobody gave a fuck about Hinata in the entire manga if that's your point. <br><br>She appears like 11 chapters out of 700</br></br></br>  <br> Mizuki talks some faggot kid everyone hates into stealing a scroll and tries to kill him <br> life in prison <br> Orochimaru and Kabuto get off scot free <br> Obito is considered the Coolest Guy and the inspiration for Dadruto's new look </br></br></br></br>  <br>He did not.</br>  <br>Titties, anon. It's all about the titties.</br>  <br>That honestly just makes it worst. He intended it to happen despite ignoring it for over a decade in real time and by making Sakura insignificant to Sasuke until literally the last chapter? That is not a good thing.</br>  <br>If only his tony the tiger-mode was more useful to the war effort.</br>  <br> Hell, why do you think Himawari's so bundled up all the time now? <br>Cause it is cute.</br></br>  <br>It's like he doesn't give a shit about romance other than the SN homolust</br>  <br>Toneri, Minato, and Obito are the only male characters who tried the hardest to get the girl so they count for more.</br>  <br>I hope Kishi gives Hima more than 2 minutes of movie.</br>  <br>She appears in 456 pages over the course of 124 chapters out of 710.</br>  This anime has alerted me to the truly dire state of the anime industry. In a market saturated with waifu-bait and moepandering garbage, It's rare to<br> come across a title which doesn't reek of banal archetypes and generic settings. Ever since the finale of Bleach I've been searching for a show to<br> fill the void and re-immerse me in world filled with unique characters and relentless yet well thought out plot containing deep philosophical <br>themes. I have come here to tell you that this anime is not my savior that i have been searching for. You see, I used to spend all my<br> days as a NEET watching anime, it was a truly splendid lifestyle until one day i returned to my village after visiting Comiket to find that my <br>entire family had been murdered by muslims. Ever since that day I cursed myself for being a tasteless weeaboo, if i'd practised sport instead<br> of wasting my life I might have been able to fight off the muslim invaders. Im warning you all before its too late, anime is worthless. Stop <br>watching it. You might think that its impossible, that it wont happen to you but honestly I thought the same, I would have never have anticipated <br>the tragedy which befell my family because of my avid weaboo antics. It could happen to you too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh I see worse relationships then SS all the time in real life.</br>  <br>Kishi says he is embarrassed to write romance. Maybe he shouldn't have bothered in the first place.</br>  <br>The most hilarious thing is that he looks at the bond Sausage and Nardo have and says to himself 'yep, that's a perfectly feasible, normal friendship with a dash of manga rivalry'.<br>He is so fucking out of touch with humanity that he cant conceive of how fucking gay he makes some characters without so much as meaning to. Look at Sakura and Ino for much of the same.</br></br>  <br>Pic related is the list of characters Kishi currently gives a fuck about.</br>  <br>Apparently she's prominent enough in the movie to catch Junko's eye, so that's something. Also it would hardly be worth mentioning that Bort's sweet to his babby sister if she wasn't going to play a part.</br>  <br>Think it was supposed to be the result a curse seal formula based on Orochimaru's experiments. He ends up turning into a prune when it doesn't work out.</br>  Goddamn I hate borutos hair, looks like a fucking peeled banana  Get the fuck out, narutards.  <br>I'm not gonna get my hopes up until seeing the thing. It could all simply be bullshit, much the same way they got everyone interested in Road to Ninja's funky Mirror Universe characters and then proceeded to blueball the whole fucking audience.</br>  <br>What's that?<br>Never heard of that site.</br></br>  <br>It's kinda grown on me. It is a good mix of kid Naruto's haystack hair and Hinata's smoother hair in locks, is shaped a bit like a leaf and has nine points to reference Kurama. It also comes with an ahoge that his sister makes an effort to imitate.<br>That's some effort that went into the design.</br></br>  <br>The Last was much better than RtN and Blood Prison. If Boruto the movie is going in the same line then i don't think it'd be that bad. Only thing i fear is Himawari getting sidelined.</br>  All the information about boroto says that he loves his sister and is very protective off her so I wonder what happens that makes him smash her birthday cake.  <br>Can't do a manga for 16 years and be called a rookie. He is a seasoned vet in mangaka terms because he completed a manga era defining title even if the manga went to complete shit from Shippuden on storywise.<br><br>He is on Toriyama level now in terms of power within Shueisha. He can make another mango and basically call the shots.</br></br></br>  <br>Autism.</br>  <br>Naruto being late/absent will probably make Himawari sad which will piss off Boruto; that's my guess.</br>  <br>Chances are it's not going to be something he does on purpose.<br>Apparently we also have pics of Naruto lighting the candles on the cake, so presumably he's there or the beginning of the birthday party, is called away for something urgent, Bolt gets pissed and throws a fit, culminating in the cake getting smashed. Bonus points for Naruto getting back right after, just when Himawari starts crying.</br></br>  <br><br>According to some few new screenshots, what happened is that Naruto apparently was at the party, but went out of the room for a minute/got a important call in the middle of the celebration and Boruto flipped his shit.</br></br>  DA FUCK MAN?!?<br><br>WHO'S METAL LEE'S MOTHER???</br></br>  <br>It is a leaf.</br>  <br> Neji </br>  Trivia time!<br><br>When was the first time Nartuo swallowed another man's seed? And who was it?</br></br>  <br>ten ten of course. Metal lee is definitely gunna be a badass and not an idiot like gai and lee.</br>  <br><br>Unknown background person a.k.a = ?????<br><br>Not kidding.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lee is a Pokemon. He just found an egg some day.  And a Ditto still sore. </br>  <br>Yamatos so he could track him. Why do I remember this.</br>  <br>I love bananas.</br>  <br>Read the fucking thread, it's not TenTen.<br><br>Though, Metal Lee's semblance (of course, if you take away the stupid "youth" uniform and his clone predecessors' haircut) is not of a doofus.</br></br></br>  <br>nice lah</br>  <br>just the face he mad in the shot in the trailer made him look cool and a badass</br>  <br>He didn't appreciate his father's candle arrangement.<br><br>Anyway, with how much emphasis they're putting on that scene in the trailers (and how we all took the b8 hook, line and sinker) I doubt things are going to be exactly as they're portrayed.</br></br></br>  <br> Chances are it's not going to be something he does on purpose <br>Hinata doesn't look angry, more concerned for her son than anything else. If he straight-up punted the cake like people thought she'd probably chew him out at least a little.</br></br>  By the way, who was Sai thinking about (in an erotic fashion) when he made Inojin with Ino? Naruto or Saskay?  <br> When was the first time Nartuo swallowed another man's seed? <br>nardo's swallowed a lot of things from a lot of men, so it's hard to tell.</br></br>  What if  Sakura  is metal'd mom?  <br>I told them that waterboy wasn't qualified for anything but they told me he was working in a secret base for years, as if that qualified him for anything.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that cute boy's results were accurate, he just used her umbilical cord which was covered in Curryn's finger Prince so it look'd like Curry did it.</br>  <br>Sharkboy did everything right. How is he supposed to know Karin received a creepy, unusual gift from pinkshit.</br>  <br>it could have been an accident, him lashing out because naruto left, he seems to look down and then up to hinata in the trailer</br>  <br>What if Lee was a reverse trap all along (bisexual and with shit taste since there's attraction towards Sakura)?</br>  uhm..why do you guys keep hating on Sakura??<br><br>Sakura x Sasuke won the best ship of the decade award!!</br></br>  <br>Because looting somebody's personal belongings assuming you know what they are is always the right idea.</br>  <br> Salad, you have a 100% genetical match with Karin <br> Congratulations, you're a clone! </br></br>  Sakura &gt;&gt; [the rest] &gt; shit &gt; Hinata<br><br>prove me wrong</br></br>  <br><br>ummm no one's falling for your weak b8 ;O</br></br>  <br> What if Lee was a reverse trap all along <br>Then who is the father? Is it  guy-sensei ?</br></br>  reminder than nh is so pure a gore artist is making vanilla sex of it http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51485225</wbr>  <br>no you are 100% right, mamma sakura is way better than mama hinata</br>  <br>Haven't you ever been pissed off and accidentally broke something? It's not like he destroyed it to be a dick to Himawari. He was angry and took it out on the cake because Naruto is not there.</br>  <br>uhm...it's not bait?<br><br>http://video.wikia.com/wiki/File:20<wbr>15_Couples_Bracket_Winner</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Why though? She's literally perfection.</br>  <br>I wouldn't expect much if she didn't make the poster, the trailer or even a cameo or mention in the gaiden.</br>  <br>i didnt know thats what happened, is this just speculation?</br>  <br> Common practice in Japan to keep your umbilical cord in a wooden box. <br> Sharkboy finds wooden box with umbilical cord in Karin's desk. <br>Everyone would assume that it's Karin's.</br></br></br>  <br>BOw down to the queen!</br>  <br>Also it was painfully obvious that Naruto was going to end up with Sakura but they forced him to change it.</br>  <br>I only think Boruto destroyed it because we saw that screenshot of Naruto lighting the candles but couldn't stick around for the party which pissed him off.</br>  <br>I love you chatte</br>  <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</br>  <br> Also it was painfully obvious that Naruto was going to end up with Sakura <br>So were you reading one of those Philippine knock off manga?</br></br>  <br>sakura stans are so strange</br>  <br>when is gonna get released?</br>  <br> wanting Naruto to be in a relationship where his wife is constantly thinking about another dude. </br>  <br>No, it'd be okay cause they're always thinking of the same dude.<br><br>It'd be a marriage based on the love of another person.</br></br></br>  <br> liking NTR <br>End yourself.</br></br>  I'm 90% it's just this faggot trying to derail the thread.<br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/12783<wbr>5148/#127845171</wbr> </br>  <br>even ss fags want naruto to be a beta that is forever stuck on their self insert</br>  <br>What else do you want to discuss?</br>  <br>Don't fall for it, anon.</br>  <br>What? Sayd who?</br>  <br>Cassidy go away.</br>  <br>Well it is clear that Bolt has some butthurt about Naruto not being able to be there every single minute of the day, Kishi projecting his own worries is the whole point of the film.<br>Clearly the birthday scene is going to play some role in setting that tension up, just the precise way of doing it is still in question.</br></br>  <br>No no I want to read what they have to say to defend this shit<br><br>I want to laugh</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like nurdo needs a bit more muscle</br>  Metal Lee hype  <br>You can just look in the archive then.</br>  <br>hype</br>  <br>He's probably just going to be an exact copy of Gai.<br>Not that I mind, but it would be fun if he was secretly a genius at genjutsu and felt pressured to do the whole green spandex routine.</br></br>  <br>He should have been paired into Bolt and Saradas squad tbh. Instead they have to make a new character that no one cares about.</br>  <br>Is that Tenten's son?</br>  <br> Not caring about Orochimaru's spawn. </br>  <br>Definitely Naruto.<br><br>He fell in love with him the first time he saw him.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope.<br><br>Lee's</br></br></br>  <br>kill yourself ntr lover faggot</br>  <br>That has already been accounted for.</br>  <br>If only that was canon. Imagining all the butthurt.</br>  <br> no byakugan <br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br>  <br>Bitch didn't even keep her virginity for Naruto.<br><br>Sakura kept hers thru so many trials and tribulations for Sasuke.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is this a Reddit meme?</br></br>  <br> Bitch didn't even keep her virginity for Naruto. <br>wat<br>From the rest of your post I get that you are still trying to derail the thread, but wat</br></br></br>  I just realized that they are forming a heart in this picture.  <br>Sakura is a fictional character. Kishi could easily make her move on from her crush on Sasuke, except if you're one of those hardcore purityfags that believe if a girl loved someone else before MC, she's used goods</br>  <br>I dunno, I definitely want to know more about the mysterious guy with stretching powers that tries to keep Bort and Salad from killing/fucking each other than about an exact copy of Lee.</br>  <br>She lost it to that guy in the movie. If you don't count random rage rape by Neji, that is.</br>  <br>It wouldn't be farfetched to think that Bolt and Himawari may get the Tenseigan. After all, The Last is canon and i don't think Kishi would have made that story of the Sage's brother just for nothing.</br>  <br>Not really, they just want him away from their precious OTP. In fact, most NH female shippers are actually SSfags</br>  <br><br><br><br>The strawberries in the cake formed a Mugen Tsukiyomi Sharingan when the candles were lit so Hinata destroyed it herself after recognizing the pattern.<br><br> captchas are cake and jitensha </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I've seen that picture done multiple times with different characters on Deviantart. It must be some type of meme.</br></br>  <br>hes not a copy of lee though. He seems more serious unlike lee and guy. And how on earth would bolt and salad want to kill eachother when its been shown already that they have a friendly relationship.</br>  <br>If Kishi cared about the tenseigan he would have introduced it in the manga.<br><br>Besides, you need like a thousand byakugans to use it. It's clear that it's a power that was just meant to be a one movie only thing.</br></br></br>  <br>The Sage's brother thing was just to give Hinata a super special bloodline. Kishi is autistic for that</br>  <br><br>The butt-hurt in this one is so strong it isn't even fun.</br></br>  <br>Rock Lee name is weird but kinda cool I guess but who the fucks thinks Metal Lee sounds good</br>  <br>Gotta wonder how you are even supposed to meld the byakugans together.<br>Also, with the sharingan the eyehax itself is just chakra. With the Byakugans they seem to be more real physical eyes, enough to be sealed or to somehow form a huge monster out of them.<br>Kishi is inconsistent as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>It sounds good to me. Metal Lee sounds like the evolution of Rock Lee. Also who the fucks call himself Might Guy?</br>  <br>That has to be the worst thing i've ever seen</br>  <br>Worse than Naruto?</br>  <br>Did you miss the part where you need to literally transplant the eyes your brother to unlock the EMS?</br>  <br>Yiff in hell, furfag.</br>  <br>nah they like him as a third wheel that loves ss more than his own family<br><br><br> most NH female shippers are actually SSfags <br>a lot of ss stans shipped nh to get naruto out of the way, but that doesn't mean majority of girls that ship it do it because of ss</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The sage's brother was a last minute asspull in order to make Hinata "special" for the upcoming romance movie so she could get kidnapped.<br><br>But since Kishi is such a hack he didn't bother giving Hamura any unique powers, nor even a power-up to Hinata.</br></br></br>  <br>No, but Kishi shat on that to allow Coolest Guy to sharingan himself back from the afterlife by sending his chakra to Kakashi and giving him dual MS and Susanoo so he can do something I already forgot.<br>As I said, inconsistent as fuck.</br></br>  <br>I also don't understand what the fuck Kishi did there. Honestly, if it weren't because Hinata won the bowl i wouldn't care for this bullshit manga.</br>  <br>Shipfaggotry is really a stupid reason to care about this manga.</br>  <br>Name a better reason.</br>  <br>It's weird that I got to a point where I was actually looking forward to reading the Gaiden and got some real enjoyment out of it.<br>Before the few weeks leading up to the ending of the manga and the Last leaks, best girl winning and all, I just read Naruto because I have done so for ages, at the end of each chapter going 'welp, that was shit'.<br>Shit as the manga, especially the war and the last fights were, it did have a surprisingly less-bad-than-expected end, though.</br></br></br>   MS's power was literally rewriting reality <br>Why did Kishi feel the need to power-creep the sharingan so much? It could literally do everything in the war arc.</br>  <br>To be fair, Pain was telling what was essentially Madara's version of the story, which was actually Black Zetsu's version of the story that he edited Hamura out of.</br>  Guys, what if Metal Lee's mom is  Hanabi ?  <br>Coolest Guy, Sasuke, Itachi, Madara and Kakashi all have sharingans. Those all would probably make Kishi's list of top ten favorite characters. <br><br>Of course he's going to give them whatever power-up comes up out his ass.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hinata winning was pretty much its only redeeming quality and I'm not even a shipperfag.</br></br>  <br> No it's teneten</br>  <br>You'd think she'd deserve better than to be a question mark in the next gen family tree. But then again that was pretty much what she was during all of part 2.</br>  <br>Impossible , that would go against Keikaku grandpa.</br>  Why did they not tell us who Kakashi ended up with though?<br><br>And Tsunade's cute assistant? How about her x Yamato?</br></br>  <br>Kakashi x Fat Anko</br>  <br>He ended up with Guy.</br>  <br>Then why do you only need the rinnegan and the tailed beasts to revive Kaguya.<br><br>Why did only Naruto and Sasuke get ninja god power-ups?<br><br>Why during the entire story we hear about the Sage of Six Paths, his sons, his ninjutsu, his tools, his OP sword, his tailed beasts but never about his brother?<br><br>Why was there never a Hyuuga that came close to the level of power Hashirama/Madara, Naruto/Sasuke had?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't they R&amp;R?</br>  <br>The rinnegan seems to have come from the fruit considering the aliens in the movie don't seem to have it.</br>  <br>He was a wizard.</br>  <br>No he wasn't. Normies don't get to call themselves wizards.</br>  <br>Nope.<br><br>She's happily single.</br></br></br>  <br> aliens in the movie don't seem to have it. <br>On their hands they do.</br></br>  <br>There's no such thing as a woman past her 20s who's happily single. Go back to Tumblr.</br>  <br>Hinata is a boring character for a female reader and she isn't after the guy they want to fuck. NH isn't very appealing to female readers, it's a guy thing</br>  <br>I would say 30's is the point of no return.</br>  <br>A stable relationship with a woman who isn't self-damaging is a guy thing? I guess that's why girls can project themselves on Sakura. Broke follow broken.</br>  <br>Why does this even have to be said?<br><br>I mean Hinata is literally a boring stereotypical Waifubait character. She has all the shitty, misogynistic traits associated with the traditionally "perfect wife" (aka Yamato Nadeshiko or something like that in Japanese).<br><br>She has no personality, she never says no to Naruto, she has unrealistically big tits, and is pretty much nothing but a satellite character to Naruto. She exists only to be his fucktoy. I mean she literally loved him unquestionably from the start even though it makes 0 sense at all (she should have been in love with Sasuke, just like everyone else).<br><br>But since 4chan is a 90% male website, naturally they like Hinata more and they try to come up with some 'rational' explanation why Hinata is a better character - she isn't - and this is evident by the fact that the only way her waifufags can pretend she's the best is by trashtalking Sakura.<br><br>Sakura is the actual deepest female character of the series and her and Sasuke's relationship is actually realistic and not some retarded male power fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally just what I said above demonstrated in this post. Male brain in a nutshell.</br>  <br>dammit, i feel like i just got rhetorically rekt</br>  <br>If you want a real woman why would you read chinese cartoons? You don't make sense</br>  <br>Most desperate 'counter-argument' of the year. I can't even even</br>  <br> NH isn't very appealing to female readers <br><br>where are people getting this shit? there are plenty of nh female fans</br></br></br>  <br>The claim of Hinata being unlikable for the female reader is completely unsupported by anon's post. By all means you can try and make a big statement like that, but good luck proving it. At best you'll make a tumblr blogpost like  about why you have that opinion, presuming that you speak for half the human beings on this planet and their tastes.<br><br>Also, that anon's mother sucks off goats in Albania for the viewing pleasure of fat, old and balding men.</br></br></br>  <br> short hair MILFnata </br>  <br>But there are plenty of female readers who like Hinata and NH(they are the majority producing the NH fanart and fanfics)</br>  <br> there are plenty of nh female fans <br>Again, they're just "supporting" it because it helps Sakura x Sasuke.</br></br>  <br><br>I know it's hard to believe, but there are female fans that are not complete cunts</br></br>  <br> Short hair <br>It is shit</br></br>  <br>I also don't understand why misoginy is bad. Are you female per chance?</br>  <br>Are we talking about MILF Sakura? Because I agree. MILF Hinata is fucking boring.</br>  <br>no, not really, you can see which ones were the ones that only cares about ss by seeing how they whined about the last being nh centric<br><br>there were plenty of female fans that loved it and dig the ship over ss or don't care about ss at all</br></br></br>  <br>She has a point. NH is cancer &amp; a male power fantasy.</br>  <br><br><br> &gt;/Tumblr/ </br></br></br>  <br>sakura fag pls</br>  <br>Lee pls.</br>  <br><br>So I can attempt to murder and a woman and she will fall for me? All right thanks for the advice, anon!</br></br>  <br>I am not a "sakura f*g" just because I see NH for what it really is</br>  <br>His mom could be practically any female character that appeared for a few panels, like how Kiba got that catgirl.<br>Hell, Kishi has brought in filler characters before like one of the seven swordsmen, so any of the filler cast that he'd like could be brought in to be his wife, should the need arise.</br></br>  <br>fedora wearing nice guy detected</br>  <br>I have a theory that it wasn't actually Kaguya herself, but a facsimile created by the Shinju using it and Black Zetsu's memories of her. Black Zetsu was a hybrid of Kaguya and the Shinju's will. <br><br>My theory goes a little deeper than that, though.<br>With the Byakugan, Hamura could see his mother's chakra being overtaken by the Shinju's, so he snuck in an additional seal within Hagoromo's jutsu that separated Kaguya from the Shinju upon sealing.<br>However, the Shinju stole most of her chakra, so she reformed as a small, white rabbit. Over the years, she hid away, recovering as much chakra as she could. Eventually, she was able to assume a human form again, after several centuries. She then lived on in disguise, fearful that if Black Zetsu found her, it would try to absorb her.<br>Eventually, she resigned to a policy of non-interference, and settled in a small village, nestled away in a nigh-impenetrable bamboo forest, and became a bamboo crafter. She has a spy network consisting of rabbits (one of which was the very rabbit that Naruto almost hit with a shuriken during the mission to the Wave) to keep her abreast on the happenings of the world, but she never gets involved in anything.<br><br>Until Momoshiki and Kinshiki show up, that is.<br><br>Hey, I can hope for the chance of BoruKagu /ss/, can't I?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just some guy trying to derail the thread, as  pointed out.</br>  <br>Is this bait? A copypasta? Or are you serious, anon? Because if you are, I have a whole rebuttal ready for you.

See where you went wrong at was you actually attack her weak points and then tried to make it seem like Sakura didn't suffer from the same issue just much much much much worst.<br><br>Fucking what was Sakura main goal this whole fucking series? It was to get sasuke literally she had no other goals really besides that. And in her eyes sasuke could do no wrong and if he did do wrong it was alright because since she loved him so much she could over look it, now that's what you call making no sense at all. And don't try to down play the shit he did like; trying to kill her twice,trying to kill naruto who was honestly her closest friend mutiple times, fucking kakashi, Karin, all the Kages, killed danzo, tried to kidnap killer B, killed innocent soliders, wanted to destroy the village, and don't forget how badly he has shit talked her and how hard he has rejected throughout the series and I mean he did this up until the end of the last fight. So don't say in anyway that their relationship makes sense, if anything they have one if not the worst pairing not in just the series but in jump mangas period.<br><br>And how can you call Sakura the deepest female in the series what led you to believe that? she was like the rest of the female who was cock thirsty 90% of the time just with her biggest difference being that she's a main character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Certainly am looking forward to the Guy-Madara fight, as it looks it will be far better than what the anime or manga portrayed it as.</br>  <br>One of the few games I'm actually looking forward to.</br>  <br>Sakura is a realistic female character and everyone in this thread knows it deep down, you just don't want to admit it.</br>   /ayy/ now likes Naruto <br><br>what the fuck happened?</br></br>  <br> so im gonna bully his penis to death </br>  <br>Oh yeah. I can't wait to play as MILF Rabbit Goddess. Messing with dimensions is going to kick so much ass.</br>  <br>Shingeki no Kyojin Generals are allowed on /a/, why should a Naruto thread not be allowed as well?</br>  <br>yeah<br>Boruto+Hanabi+Kaguya combo<br>All aboard to incest /ss/ train!</br></br></br>  <br>Tenner says you won't be able to do any of that shit outside the Ultimate or maybe, maybe her Awakening.</br>  <br>What goals does Hinata have?<br>Becoming stronger was as useless as Sakura becoming Tsunade's apprentice. Hinata is a housewife without any connection to the Hyuga clan or any life outside the house while Sakura is supposed to work at the hospital or something according to some novel not written by Kishi but we only see her as Sasuke's maid. Both are lipservice</br></br>  <br>Kishi must do something right, taking in consideration how many women can relate to Sakura. The "queen" nickname isn't used by male fans</br>  <br>so its slap-o silly then?</br>  <br>Wonder if they'll do a Minato-Naruto-Boruto combo.<br>They really ought to.<br> Also it's confirmed no Himawari in the game, right? It makes me sad, she is fucking adorable and some earlier games had academy-age Konohamaru as playable with a goofy as fuck fighting style. </br></br></br>  Interviewer: “Who is your favourite character in Naruto?”<br><br> Taniguchi: “It’s Hinata.” <br><br> Kishimoto: “Eh, you like big-breasted girls?” (laugh) <br><br> Taniguchi: “It’s not that.” (laugh) “I like the fact that at the beginning she was a weakling, but due to Naruto’s influence she steadily became strong.” <br><br> Kishimoto: “That’s because Hinata doesn’t stand at the main character’s side like normal heroines*… she’s the type that watches him from the shadows.” <br><br> Interviewer: “I thought the heroine was Sakura?” <br><br> Kishimoto: “That’s right. But Sakura is addicted to Sasuke.” (laugh) “The reason why Hinata came to like Naruto is clear, but I’ve deliberately avoided writing down the reason why Sakura came to like Sasuke.” (laugh) “That’s because somehow, I had the feeling that it would conversely end up sounding contrived.” <br><br>(source)<br><br>BWAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA ok I hate this mofo but this made me laugh, at least he admits that Sakura is criminally insane and that Hinata has nothing but her big boobs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WHAT HAPPENED TO HER BOOBS?!?</br>  <br>Sasuke is a realistic male character and everyone in this thread knows it deep down, you just don't want to admit it.</br>  <br>A lot girls I know hate her.</br>  <br>What would her moveset be anyways? She doesn't have byakugan so she can learn shit from Hinata.</br>  <br>She is very good at concealing her powerlevel.</br>  <br> f*g <br>this is obviously bait</br></br>  <br>I don't think most people go derp with DARKNESS or be asexual.</br>  <br>man no himawari in the game but hell, new chars like we got Hanabi, muh Rin, and even Hiashi as Cameo<br>but yeah they should include Himawari + other part 3 kids as DLCs in future</br></br>  <br>I'm female and like NH since part 1 naruto but i'm not sasusaku fags nor sakurafags</br>  <br> Hinata has nothing but her big boobs. <br>He doesn't say that, though.</br></br>  <br>source? Im going to spread this like wildfire</br>  <br>YES.<br><br>It'll still be fun, even if it's limited time-wise.</br></br></br>  <br>most people don't get their entire family killed by their beloved brother</br>  <br> f*g <br>Tumblr get out.</br></br>  <br>Just like many males hate the harem lead. This kind of character has all the characteristic the audience hate about themselves and few or none redeeming qualities but they can be used as self-inserts precisely for be so pathetic. It seems people have a negative image about themselves</br>  <br>A thread not long after her reveal speculated her as a summoner, with her endgame ability being calling forth the tailed beasts who help her out because fuck's sake just look at her, she too damn adorable.</br>  <br>But you don't know any girls. You only know guys like these  who pretend to be female to help their point.</br>  <br>It's sad. Fighting games have to choose between two routes in their playstyles: Make every character similar but the playstyle is boring... or make every character different and unique but the roster becomes horrible imbalanced.<br><br>Smash Bros and Injustice: Gods Among Us got it... pretty damn close but even in those games there are some character tiers.<br><br><br>SYDNEY<br>Y<br>D<br>N<br>E<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok but did I say Hinata had goals like that's? But to uplift Sakura who was in the same position as her you can't do that. And ok she is a house wife what's wrong with that? Sakura apparently has no life outside of her job (that she supposedly has)and being a single mother. Unless you can prove me wrong other wise hell none of her friends even knew she was pregnant and you can tell me they didn't have phones or some form to talk</br>  <br>No I actually go outside.</br>  <br>You know that claim just makes it even easier to disregard your argument, since anybody else could say the same thing about you</br>  <br>its shame CC2 that dropped what-if ultimate jutsu combos for canon ultimate combos<br>oh well maybe they do that in future...</br></br>  <br>But Hinata is a better character. She has development, an actual backstory and a complete character arc, unlike Sakura.</br>  Im confused I stopped reading naruto a while ago arent they still fighting in that god damn fucking war? When did they do a new time jump?  <br>Yeah you're right because every girl builds their life around a man who rejects them for 10+ years and chases after him for 20+ years. That's realistic</br>  <br>How far back did you stop reading, anon?</br>  Next Hokage Boruto or Himawari?  <br>Stop falling for obvious bait, anon.</br>  <br>Hinata doesn't seem to have a life either. In the other hand, she never showed a true goal beyond marrying nurutu so I guess it's a happy ending for her.</br>  <br>Sealed by Hokage's order after becoming Kurama's summer home. She would destroy a country if they were allowed to escape.</br>  <br>Boruto doesn't want to be hokage and Himawari likely won't be raised to even be a ninja.</br>  <br>i stopped reading the manga during the land of tea escort mission</br>  <br>umm mask nigga was about to turn the moon into an eye naruto and nigga nigga are fighting the other beasts I just kinda gave up since it felt like this fight was going to last forever</br>  <br>Burrito said he does not want his old man's job. Himawari a possibility, otherwise we're rolling with Sarada (Tobirama's last resort activates and terminates the village) or ChouChou (turns the shiny new metropolis into Detroit).</br>  <br> land of tea <br>What?</br></br>  <br>The fuck man, I'm not pretending</br>  <br>Hokages alternate Yin/Yang. <br>Hashirama: Yang<br>Tobirama: Yin<br>Hiruzen: Yang<br>Minato: Yin<br>Tsunade: Yang<br>Kakashi: Yin<br>Naruto: Yang<br>Sarada: Yin</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen worse in real life. At least Sakura has a miserable life while she'd get a fairy tale end on a female-aimed magazine</br>  <br>Sarada already made it her lifelong dream. Boruto hates hokages.</br>  <br>Ok yeah you're right her character was literally made for naruto and she doesn't seem to have a life I agree, but it's sad that kishi wasted his heroine spot for Sakura when she's literally in the same position as side line characters while the other two MC are actually doing something(well sasuke just found a way to be a dead beat)</br>  <br>This is worse than narusakus's parallelism. At least Kishi loves pottery</br>  <br> Minato <br> Yin <br>Wut.<br><br><br>That's sort of close to the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw Konohamaru will never get to be Hokage like he wanted and his student will </br>  <br>How the fuck is Hiruzen Yang?</br>  <br><br><br>Sarada is a disgusting Uchiha</br></br></br>  <br>She wanted to change herself and become strong and she did.</br>  <br>oh shit so naruto ended? did one piece end too? I cant even remember where I stopped in that one</br>  <br>Because Danzo is yang.</br>  <br>She's not disgusting. I fap to her using her itty bitty loli titties trying to sexually satisfy Naruto.</br>  <br>Minato is Yin, Kushina is Yang. Naruto takes after his mother personality-wise and his father looks-wise. Kushina describes Minato as flaky and feminine - Yin traits.<br><br><br>Hiruzen was like Naruto and Hashirama when he was young. Danzo was his Yin rival.</br></br></br></br>  <br> naruto ended? <br>Yes. The point you stopped reading at is a few fights from the end.<br> did One Piece end too? <br>Haha.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So what? She is still getting the job.</br>  <br>Yeah, and Sakura wanted to be useful and she did because she punched Kaguya. What a wonderful character!</br>  <br>Yin/Yang is canon though.</br>  <br>Oh no I've seen worst too, but for a fictional character you can't really get more of a shit relationship then that , definitely in jump manga. And yeah her life is pretty shit now but still if that was a normal relationship it wouldn't had worked out.</br>  <br> oh shit so naruto ended? <br>Last November. Best girl won. We're waiting on a film about her and Naruto's son.<br> did one piece end too? <br>Not within our lifetimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura didn't really care about being useful so much as she cared about not being 100% useless. Her ambition was Sasuke. That's it.</br>  <br>The entire manga is built around pottery</br>  <br>Anyone who calls Hinata best girl is a permavirgin misogynerd.</br>  <br>How the fuck is Neji yang?</br>  <br>OK then, smart guy, who's your best girl in this series?</br>  <br>I don't know. I think actually it's a functional relationship because both get what they want. Sasuke has a maid that never say no and Sakura can pretend she's having a wonderful marriage with the most popular guy on Konoha and being the envy of all the women of the village, despite her life is terrible.</br>  <br>Masculine and strong-willed vs. Hinata's quiet femininity.</br>  <br>Nah. You're just an idiot.</br>  <br>Sakura is the most realistic female character.<br><br>However, feminist characters like Ino and Tenten are also OK.</br></br></br>  <br>By that all logic nearly all males in the series are yangs.</br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night, shitposter-kun.</br>  <br>Obvious NHfag.</br>  <br> Sakura is the most realistic female character <br>That's not what I asked you. I asked you who you thought was best girl, not who you thought was most realistic.<br> Ino <br>Bitch during part 1 and barely got any proper characterisation in part 2. Even Chouji got more.<br> Tenten <br>She's quite good, I agree, but she got nowhere near the screentime Hinata did. She was barely in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, most are. In Taoism, Yang is the male aspect.</br>  <br> Hinata <br> Screentime </br></br>  <br>But Neji is in the yin spot in that picture.</br>  <br>Yes, when compared to most other girls in the series.</br>  <br>Realistic as in always going back to the guy that tries to kill her multiple times. Sounds accurate actually.</br>  <br> puts image where Neji is in the yin spot <br><br>epic simply epic</br></br></br>  <br>That's because he's the bad guy. He's still opposite Hinata there.</br>  <br>Naruto was a sausage fest</br>  <br> misogynistic <br> unrealistically big tits <br> (she should have been in love with Sasuke, just like everyone else). <br> Sakura is the actual deepest female character of the series <br>b8 m8</br></br></br></br></br>   Ying/Yang discussion <br>I seriously doubt Kishi ever thought about it. He just follow the editor's orders and jerk-off with narusasu porn</br>  <br> Calls Hinatafags misogynistic <br> Claims Sakura is a realistic woman <br>Excuse me what?</br></br></br>  <br>There is literally nothing wrong with wanting to be a housewife, sharing a comfortable life with the person you love isn't a distasteful thing.</br>  <br>It's quite astounding to see how many people seem to humour his bullshit in hopes of getting a good laugh at him.</br>  The Twelve Guardian Ninjas was the best Naruto arc, prove me wrong.  <br>He definitely did. Yin/Yang is present throughout Naruto in numerous aspects.</br>  <br> There is literally nothing wrong with wanting to be a housewife <br>Said by a male neckbeard.</br></br>  <br>Nice fanfiction.</br>  <br>True and while all of the other ninja are fucking like rabbits Sakura gets to go on a 12 year long abstinence run. So I'm sure she's as dry as a nun and as for sasuke honestly he was never interested in girls until God knows when so I would say he has blue balls but honestly he probably doesn't</br>  <br>Go away tumblr.</br>  <br>Sasuke is gay for Naruto. Really, that make more sense than any bullshit excuse Kishi can give.</br>  <br>There's also literally nothing wrong with wanting to be a househusband either, why would you want to tell other people that their dreams can only be dreams?</br>  <br> The Nine-Tails is split into Yin and Yang halves <br> Naruto and Sasuke have Six Paths Yang and Six Paths Yin powers  <br> There is literally a nature type called Yin/Yang Release <br> Fanfiction <br>More like reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's more of a cultural baseline thing that gets involved whenever some mythology or symbolism needs to be created, in the same vein as Western artists often turn to Greek and Roman classics or Christian imagery.<br>I too very much doubt that Kishi gave that one thing that much thought when he obviously wrote himself into a corner with the main fucking villain.<br>The analysis of  is nonetheless applicable, but Kishi does not get any credit for it.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Nice non sequitur.</br>  <br>More like a really bad fanfiction, because none of those this happened or exist.</br>  <br>Every single one of those happened. Are you stupid?</br>  <br>Yeah honestly sasuke was one of those characters if he showed back up to the village with a BF or admitted he had always like naruto and that's why he always treated him that way. I doubt anybody really would of been surprised and if they were it would of been from the shock of calling all those years</br>  <br>Reminder that this is canon.</br>    <br>Sausage having any sort of sex drive or sexuality, even something as pointless and mentally ill as homosexuality is just plain wrong and well outside of the actual character.</br>  <br><br>How many heart attacks do you think Kishi suffered while making this?</br></br>  <br>Hmm yeah I thought he was Asexual for the longest but then I started to get hints of gay vibes from him</br>  Hinata has been the best girl since this moment.  <br> both are Yangs <br><br>makes argument fuckign pointless</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke is Yin, you fucking idiot.</br>    ITT: closet fags that need to read Seraph of the End  <br>Except Japs understand Yin-Yang and Buddhism.</br>  What is the optimal speed for watching Naruto: Shippuden? I'm currently watching it at 1.8 speed and it's still slow as fuck.  <br>The same could be said about Naruto. Remember when Ino showed his gay memories to the entire ninja alliance?</br>  <br>don't watch it, read the manga</br>  <br>Don't. Just read the manga and watch the episodes with the big fights.</br>  <br>What the actual fuck is up with those filters</br>  HAVE THEY ANIMATED GUY V MADARA YET??????  <br>Well it is mangapanda.</br>  <br>Began to. He just went full gates.</br>  <br>It's smudge filtering on top of Mangapanda, which is already smudge filtering the chapter. It's fucking gross.</br>  <br>but the manga doesn't have the whole story!!</br>  <br> but the manga doesn't have the whole fillers <br>Correct.</br></br>  <br>Sai is 100% straight. He said Ino is beautiful!</br>  I bet that's the way she likes it, that slut.  <br>Because he was saying the opposite of how he actually feels, since he learned with Sakura that saying how he feels ends up bad.</br>  <br><br>Sakura's face looks kind of weird there.<br><br>Almost like she's shocked someone's love for sasuke is far greater than hers.</br></br></br></br>  Fuck why is hinata so beautiful<br><br> tfw you will never ever breed her </br></br>  <br>She is ugly to me, because I care about women's personality too not just looks like you pigs. And Hinata's personality is ugly as fuck since she's a patriarchy's ideal wife and not a feminist.</br>  <br>Sakura is the patriarchy's ideal wife. Takes abuse, doesn't complain, and raises the kid while the man goes out and does man's work.</br>  <br> I care about women's personality too not just looks <br><br>Get a load of this loser</br></br></br>  <br>nope<br><br>what Sasuke does to Sakura is nowhere as abusive as what Naruto does every day to Hinata</br></br></br>  <br>This is the weakest bait I've ever seen</br>  <br>m8 he was saying the opposite of what he thought.</br>  <br>ask any female reader (i.e. on Tumblr) and she will confirm it<br><br>Naruto and Hinata just feels wrong<br><br>we'd much rather be any other girl in the series than Hinata because seh suffers so much</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you keep replying to him, then?<br>He's pretending to be a tumblr feminist sakurafag, for fuck's sake.</br></br>  <br> kishi being a feminist  <br>Well nigga if you're looking for a strong independent female you have the wrong series. And nigga what's wrong with how Hinata acts i could see if she married sasuke and acted like Sakura but naruto doesn't have much to complain about, besides how busy he is but she would be a bitch to complain about a requirements for his job</br></br>  <br> what Naruto does every day to Hinata  <br>Sex, you mean? 'Cause yeah, Sasuke's definitely not doing that to Sakura.</br></br>  <br>so that confirms that he is basically homosexual then</br>  <br>That was actually my first post in the thread</br>  <br>Pretty much. Hinata is more of an ideal that doesn't really exist.</br>  <br> Sex, you mean? <br>among other things, yes<br><br>i am pretty sure that most of the time when they have sex it's basically rape (whether Hinata thinks it is rape or not is irrelevant)</br></br></br></br>  <br>He still fucked her and had a kid at some point so he can only be but so gay.</br>  <br>What do you get out of pretending like this? Honestly, what do you find so fun about this?</br>  <br>Fair enough. I still don't know why people are replying to the guy though.<br>I mean if he was not so obvious it could be funny, but the whole bit needs some work.</br></br>  <br>all he needed to do was thinking that that filthy female hole of hers is naruto's boypusy</br>  <br>Ino probably mind-switched them and fucked Sai in his body.</br>  Is tumblr trying to troll?  <br>ok for fucking real, Naruto is in his mid 30s and has kids and shit, the manga can for fucks sake</br>  <br>My guess is a regular shitposter bored of calling dubs pretending to be a sakurafag at first in  and now spicing it up with feminism and tumblr shit.</br>  <br><br>He unintentionally implies it.<br><br>Taniguchi had to actually explain his reason for liking her and naturally ends up describing her development.<br><br>Then Kishi tries to save it and pulls the "from the shadows" bullshit and proceed to shit on Sakura even more.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ, you people read way too much into translated interviews</br>  <br> He unintentionally implies it. <br><br>Nah. Kishi was joking around, hence the (laughs). He does that often in interviews.</br></br></br>  <br> taking Kishi seriously during interviews especially when he laughs. <br>You are a sad man.</br></br>  <br>Female reader here. Nah you're wrong. Hinata is olev.</br>  <br> ask any female reader (i.e. on Tumblr) and she will confirm it <br><br>Wrong faggot.<br><br>Hinata is ok.<br><br>Sakura is a shit.<br><br>Simply as that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Female reader here. <br><br>You gotta prove it. Timestamp with hands</br></br></br>  <br> Ino will never switch minds and fuck you with your own body </br>  <br>LONDON<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck off, Kira</br>  <br>You're wrong.<br><br>Most women actually don't like Sakura because of her shallowness. And they certainly don't prefer her with Naruto either.</br></br></br>  Wait, how old is everybody in this movie? I'm assuming that Naruto is at least in his early 30s.<br><br>Also Himawari a qt</br></br>  Best Daughteru.  <br>It's funny you point this out, because most female readers don't like Sakura exactly because she chose Sasuke over Ino.<br><br>The Sakurafags over at tumblr are believe it or not a very vocal minority.</br></br></br>  <br><br>He laughed about the Sakura's reasons to like Sasuke, but /a/ took him seriously. Double standards much?</br></br>  <br>He called her an addict too, and said that he never did it because it was too contrived.</br>  <br> Himawari <br> relevant <br><br>She's Hinata Jr. It means she'll be just be shipping fodder and stay "in the shadows."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Early 30s it is.<br>Himawari is best girl of her generation.</br></br>  <br>While (laughing). So either Hinata's an irrelevant pair of tits whose job is always to be in the kitchen/shadows.<br><br>Or he's joking about both. Don't nitpick.  Both are shit. </br></br></br>  Post your face when you realised you will never, ever impregnate Hinata.   Shika's kid is literally just Shika 2.0 <br><br>Oh come on Kishi.</br></br>  <br> It's nitpicking to point out what a person is actually saying. But not nitpicking to focus solely on the fact that he laughed, which would have been because of the question. <br><br>Yeah no, sorry but I'm signing up to your delusions. Point is Kishimoto plainly stated that he gave Hinata a clear reason to like Naruto, but didn't bother with Sakura because it was too contrived.<br><br>Also Sakura is so much better, that Kishimoto didn't even bother to include her family, or give her her own dreams or goals outside of wanting to fuck Sasuke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Hinata bit was at the expense of the guy saying he likes her, kinda embarrassing him. It's simple banter. Had he for some messed up reason said he liked Sakura he'd have been asked whether he's an ass-man or have a thing for girls with pink hair.<br><br>Sakura being an addict is similarly a joke, albeit at the character's expense, while the contrived bit is at his own, essentially. He basically admits he dropped the ball hard with her, in a joking manner.<br><br>I don't take him seriously most of the time, and he is infamously shit at interviews. Yet at the same time this freaked those truly sick people who actually like Sakura out big time, which is always funny.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. Shikamaru was his father's 2.0 and his son is 3.0</br>  <br>What's hilarious is 2ch's response to it.</br>  <br>?</br>  <br>Those jackets on hinata and imawari are so cute god damn.</br>  <br>It's a tumblr link so I don't know if I should post but it some of the comments are eye opening. <br><br>Apparently Sasuke's popularity has been declining in recent years. Apparently SS isn't quite as popular as we thought it was.</br></br></br>  <br>It is impossible to surpass the power of Kakashi and Iruka in Japan.</br>  <br>just post it, who the fuck cares about your reputation, it's anonymous.</br>  <br>okay<br>http://fourangers.tumblr.com/post/1<wbr>24447399034/soooooo-after-the-relea<wbr>se-of-that-infamous</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>On the one hand that's nice to hear, late or not.<br>On the other I'd hesitate to gauge popular opinion based on 2ch. <br>Didn't NS shipperfags try to push something based on a Nardo hate thread originating from years ago to try and make it seem like Japan hates the Last in spite of it being the biggest, most profitable Naruto film?</br></br></br>  <br>No, that was Western tumblrinas. The Japanese NS shippers just gave up.</br>  <br>Then who is popular? Because there aren't really any other relevant characters anymore other than the SN foursmome</br>  <br>Naruto believe it or not, even the Nips are annoyed with Sasuke and his "darkness".<br><br>They don't seem to like team 7 too much. SS isn't all that popular as it once seemed. The most popular het pairing seems to be NH. Apparently even the Nips thought that Sasuke was better off with Karin.</br></br></br>  <br> Accidentally calls Hinata the heroine <br>Lyl.</br></br>  <br>Slip of the tongue.</br>  <br>He likens her to other heroines. Nardo as a manga does not really have a female lead or proper, main heroine.</br>  3 more days until the Last is released on DVD. how long until a good rip comes from it?  <br>He likened her to other heroines in other stories. Then the interviewer implied that he just called Hinata the heroine.</br>  <br>According to a translator the word that Kishimoto actually uses to describe Sakura is really derogatory. The manner he said it was akin to a drug addiction.</br>  <br>Then what was Naruto's relationship with Sasuke in part 2 supposed to be? A normal BFFship?</br>  <br>Yep, gotta remember unlike Sakura, Naruto actually has a reason to obsessed with Sasuke.<br><br>He doesn't really have many people who care about him, and Sasuke did attempt to sacrifice himself to save Naruto twice. And we know from Sasuke's thoughts that he does think highly of him.<br><br>Sakura he just treats like shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  So, did TenTen ever end up with anyone, or are her weapons her true love?  <br>Not that we know of. She's a bored weapons proprietor and occasional exam supervisor.</br>  <br> and Sasuke did attempt to sacrifice himself to save Naruto twice <br><br>He did try to do that for Sakura at some point as well, though I don't think she knows about that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop lying.</br></br>  You think Naruto and Hinata ever thought about breaking up for a while? Every couple will go through some hard times, no matter how in love they might seem.  <br> You think Naruto and Hinata ever thought about breaking up for a while? <br>No.</br></br>  <br>So what should have happened with Sasuke? The obvious answer would be for him to end up alone but Kishi needs him to reproduce so he can get his Uchiha waifu and he needs her to live in Konoha so she can do some pottery with Bort.</br>  <br>Yes, every day</br>  <br>Fuck no.<br>Shin Sekai Yori did this and it was and still is creepy.</br></br>    if i haven't read naruto since right before the time skip should i still catch up? can i? i don't think it's even available to read online, i'm not gonna go buy the fucking books.  <br>Everything is available online.</br>  <br> i don't think it's even available to read online </br>  <br>Seconding this. How long do I have to wait for a good quality rip of The Last?</br>  <br>Nah.<br><br>He seems like a straight up cocky asshole. He is probably smart and lazy like his dad but he seems more assertive than preShippuden Shikamaru.</br></br></br>  <br>But Himawari will grow up to be a massive slut.</br>  <br>What makes you think so?</br>  ROCK LEE DIGIVOLVE TO..<br>METAL LEE!</br>  <br>Laughable.</br>   every next gen parents in Konoha gave birth to one child <br> only Hinata gives birth to two. <br><br>What a slut</br></br></br>  Will Aunty Hanabi and Grandpa Hiashi be in Himawari's birthday party to witness Burrito destroying his Imouto cake?<br><br> it'll probably never happen ;_;  </br></br>  <br>Probably not since Hinata is not a real person, just a submissive male power fantasy / sex toy.</br>  <br>Kishi just said both Naruto and Sasuke were lunatics and that he didn't portray their relationship in a way people could sympathize with. He still wanks their brotherly bond a lot and said it was important to him because he has a brother of his own. Make of that what you will.<br>He just doesn't seem to take Sakura seriously at all. Although his writing does portray her as an addict, so if that was his intention all along then mission accomplished.</br></br>  <br>Sasuke buying time for Naruto and Sakura to get away while Sakura is unconscious is not a good reason for her to be obsessed with him.</br>  why do i fucking hate this series but fucking love it at the same time  <br>To be fair she pretty much never once does anything for a good reason, so it is in character.</br>  <br>Same here. I hate how shitty the writing and the story is most of the time but I love the shipping!!</br>  <br><br>Yeah he takes after his mam I reckon.</br></br>  <br>Naruto goes "fishing" with Sasuke.</br>  <br> Clearly the birthday scene is going to play some role in setting that tension up, just the precise way of doing it is still in question <br>He'll probably end up destroying it on accident.</br></br>  Post anything JJBA!    Jojo's is life  <br>How about the pastebin you faggot.</br>  Gay Priest is here now.  I drew Soft and Wet. Would anyone care to see?    <br> There's already a thread up.

I call this one "Emerald Splash"  <br>MORE LIKE  BELONGS  IN THE  TRASH !</br>  <br>Isn't that a picture of   High Elephant Green  </br>  <br>Character interactions get much better, and the main cast gets significantly bigger, as well as many more villians and Hamon is traded for Stands which gives much more space for power exploration, as well as good fights, Polnareff who is a top tier JoBro and a second JoJo for the first time, so basically, it stacks up very well</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why was there a lack of panels of Hotpants in her nun outfit?</br>  Anyone know the name of the track that typically plays in David's Part 3 during scenes where Kakyoin thinks he's winning?

Well, the part is moved to the main storyline. Near 30% of the movies is about Precure Carnival, where each series presents their theme during the carnival exhibition. And what do we have as an ending? Yep, You guess it right, Morning Musume's AMV.

Noice.   girls undressing girls <br><br>Why is this allowed.</br></br>  Kirara, plz   Towa wears low socks <br><br>This pleases me.</br></br>  They added Mochizuki into the OP.  <br>Towa doesn't know how to dress herself, she always had servants do it.</br>  I miss Ranko.  <br>So Shut always dressed her?</br>  <br>No, those clothes were always made of magic.</br>  What kind of adjective is "Angely"?  Let's the cringe being.    GOKIGENYOU   TOWACCHI KITAAA  TOWACCHI  TOWACCHI IT IS.  TOWACCHI   towacchi     Towacchi   Tovarish    SMILE SMILE   chi chi chi   Smile reference in Precure?<br><br> Also, is there less animation than usual. </br></br>  <br>Kirara episode usually are.</br>  TWCC KNPK  twch<br>knpk</br>  The hate is building up.  twch crng<br><br>so much cringe this ep</br></br>  W-Wow, that's some popularity.   Towacchi   Just kill them already, Yui. End it.  TOVVAHKIIN<br><br>FUS RO DAH</br></br>  It just works out for princesses    Time to slut her up.  Holy shit that face looked ok. I'm surprised.  muh dick  Looking really good there, even despite the makeup.<br><br>Towa is ugly.</br></br>    Towachhi lives with Kirara.   Kirara tore her scarf then it cut to Towa's hair in the same spot.  This is pretty nice having both Kirara deal with extra work and taking care of Towa, whereas Towa is getting used to making her new identity and learning everything for the first time. Perfect split-focus.  Can the yellow not overwork like the pink?  L-Lock is kinda handsome in this form  Great, the stream got fixed but I fucking lagged out of the last minute.    gaaay  Doujinshi when?  They are too cute together.  <br>He does though</br>   Lock got big <br> Why? <br>Because you're all too lewd.</br></br>  Who has a ticklish back?  GROUP HENSHINS ARE DEAD<br>DEAD</br>  <br>And something of value was lost.</br>    Red dildos are in season this year.  So they've started collecting despair now? Not just going around screwing with humans for unclear reasons?  <br>They're doing it temporarily to refuel Dyspear.</br>  Wombo Combo  <br>Since last episode when This Pear told them to collect despair.</br>    Goddamn, these cuts look really great. I can't wait for high quality, both the last shot and Towa's flashback.   ara ara    ara ara     I love Precure.    <br><br>I want Kirara to hug me.</br></br>  <br><br><br>I couldn't do anything about it, that program is in chinese. Who knew that you had to right click to force 16:9.<br>Also the volume is wonky, yeah.</br></br></br></br>  New OP/ED next episode, right? We're finally halfway through.  The violin is stupid.

And the remaining two generals are still useless.</br></br>  <br>Woah woah woah. Woah. You cannot talk shit about Cures! It is NOT ALLOWED.  Unless it's Rin, because she's my least favorite. </br>  <br>Maybe it was the channel now that you switched to FujiTV it doesn't look like it had massive amounts of bloom.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>I wonder if we'll get to see any of Haruharu's old classmates?<br><br>It be nice to have that kind of before and after moment of them talking to her.</br></br></br>  This season is trying really hard to balance everyone out.<br><br>I'm still worried that they'll fail at some point, but I'm glad they've put in the effort.</br></br>  <br>What part didn't you like or would have wanted to see? It had lack of common sense Towa, Towacchi nickname and Kirara covering for her, conflict between the two of them, Towa's resolution to adapt to her new world (speaking of which Mochizuki's pretty accepting herself to just give Towa a last name), more of Kirara's actual job and showing that she's working hard for her dream, including the difficulty that comes with it, a coherent episode theme of learning to smile that both Kirara and Towa had to learn together, handsome Lock and conflict between him and Shut, and at the very end Towa acting haughty now that she's learned to dress herself, showing that she didn't lose all of her personality.</br>  I missed that scene with Kirara and Towacci in the forest, I guess I'll have to wait for the raw to watch it.  <br>The problem is in TV Asahi itself.</br>    So Towa does know math?    Are they airing the Battle of the Gods movie? I thought this was DBZ Super?  <br>She had a good teacher.</br>  <br>DBZ super is just the two latest movies stretched into a 50 episode series with a fuckload of filler to fill the gaps.</br>      Pretty much no new info.<br><br> Starting today it's summer break! <br> Everyone in the dorm is going back to his or her home.  <br> Minami, Kirara and Yui will go to stay at Haruka's place! <br> And of course, Towa too!! <br><br> When they arrive, they help with the confectionery store, Haruka's family business. <br> After that, they eat nagashisoumen, enter the hot springs, and enjoy the summer thoroughly! <br><br> For Towa, it's her first summer break. <br> Also, it's both Towa's and Minami's first stay at someone else's place. <br> Everything about Haruka's family is a first. <br><br> When they get tired, it's time for a little break on the tatami... *cute idling sounds*. <br> Not without hesitation, Towa and Minami also take a nap with them... <br><br> However, Towa is restless as she has a frightening dream. <br><br>Official summary from http://asahi.co.jp/precure/princess<wbr>/story/ .

Please remember this is unconfirmed. Believe at your own risk.<br><br> The new ED was revealed for the first time. (For TV it'll be from August on). I forgot the title but it felt even more like a musical. However, there were a lot of high notes, and it's possibly too difficult for children to sing. <br> Skipping a lot of things, the final part* is a precure ondo. The Precures and the three musketeers of Disdark danced together holding fans with the "festival" kanji written on them. Seeing that, everyone laughed.  <br> What I thought was incredible, was the part in which Flora and Scarlet played the festival taiko which was built on a gradually raised wooden scaffold. <br> I thought I would really like to see that turned into 3DCG on TV. <br> ↑Quoting someone who went to see the show. <br> The ondo is not the ED, don't worry. <br> We get to see the current 3 Cures ED for a while still. <br><br>*of the show</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone have that gif of Reika on Mt Fuji with her dress flapping and you can see her panties?  <br>I'm guessing we won't get a new Op and ED until episode 28/29 then. That way Towa can bond with every girl and cement her place as their friend before she gets added to the OP and ED.</br>  kutca kutca kutca    What are they doing?  <br><br>What is she doing?

Is it as good as the blue stuff?  <br>Never thought I'd live long enough to see this.<br>Shouldn't be Honoka instead of Yayoi though?</br></br>  why do people say Mana takes over the fucking show compared to other series? I saw the Smile movie recently and its plot is basically "everyone fucking loves Miyuki". And the last third of HaCha revolves around Megumi. Fuck, the Doki finale arc is more about Regina, Makoto, and Aguri than it is Mana. The only time she "takes over the show" is in the five minute time span it takes Parthenon mode to beat up Proto-Jikochuu.  <br>  And the last third of HaCha revolves around Megumi.  <br>People are upset about this too.<br> The only time she "takes over the show" is in the five minute time span it takes Parthenon mode to beat up Proto-Jikochuu. <br>And, you know, the entire rest of the show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that I completely agree, but DokiDoki is the "Everyone loves Mana and Mana is right about literally everything, including when all of her friends disagree" show.</br>  <br>I don't know how to feel about this</br>  <br>Sniffing a girl's sweat should only ever be used for love, not hate.</br>  <br><br>Mana didn't even fucking get an episode focus for her upgrade attack. I fail to see how she "took over" the rest.</br></br>  <br>Basically, any episode that was a "main story" episode could also be considered a "Mana episode" to an above average extent compared to other pinks.<br><br>From there it's all exaggerations and echo chamber nonsense.</br></br></br>  <br> defeats all the monsters <br> is portrayed as always right <br> the show focused mostly on her and her relationship with Regina/desperation to save Regina <br> etc <br>Just admit that you're wrong and that Mana took over the show.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> defeats all the monsters <br>no more than any other pink. and yanno, in penultimate episode she fucking comes up short and needs Makoto to bail her out.<br> is portrayed as always right <br>You act like Precure is always full of a lot of conflict between active team members and them debating and arguing over how to do things. Outside of the first series, a small portion of Max Heart, and like a single cour of Suite, that's not really a big part of the franchise.<br> the show focused mostly on her and her relationship with Regina/desperation to save Regina <br>Regina is awol for at least a fourth of it, and the final push has EVERYONE interacting significantly with Regina, and the final bunch of episodes is as much about her connection to Aguri as it is about her friendship with Mana.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    fuck<br> This late already <br/></br>  <br>Are you implying that the entire time Regina was in a coma Mana wasn't spending every other line talking about her? Because she did.</br>  <br><br>There are multiple episodes where she's not even mentioned at all.</br></br>  Yes Mana was a screentime hog.<br>No, she wasn't any worse in that regard than Nagisa.</br>  <br>What I wouldn't give to sniff a Cure</br>            Finally, I have found it, I have!<br>My very own sun...</br>      There will be new Precure Figuarts at WonFes.  On a scale of suite to hapcha, how het is gopri?  <br>/u/ on suicide watch/10</br>  <br>So far it's pretty Fresh. It'll depend on how important Kanata is to Haruka.</br>  <br>How so?</br>  How much does Kirara charge for creampies?  <br>How much is a box of donuts?</br>  <br>This particular fluid druid only charges a mere 8.65 per creampie, with a double creampie special at 14.50.</br>  Did the new stage movie get put up on nyaa?  <br>All cures are obviously craving for dicks. Haruharu wants the royal staff, Minimin and Towacchi want the oniisamas, Kirara just wants all dicks.<br><br>The only character witha a hint of /u/ is Yui but she is about as relevant as Tina at this point.</br></br></br>  <br>you're scale is broken</br>  <br>Sorry. I mean doki to hacha</br>  <br>$100,000 per hole. The high quality girls charge a lot.</br>  <br> high quality </br>  <br>Hacha figuarts please, they're the only season past season that doesn't even have prize figurines.</br>    Have you played Etrian 2 Untold demo, /pc/? It got Ditzy Princesses and all!  <br>One of the cutest Precouples, seriously.<br><br> At least Kirara hasn't been pushed off to the side yet <br>Yea, that is surprising to say the least. Very pleasing, but still an odd feeling.<br><br> /u/ on suicide watch/10 <br>Is it bad this saying still amuses me?<br><br>I'd rank it around (())<br> Fresh level. I'd say Y5PC actually ranks lower than many realize for how strong the AquaXMilky overtones were. It balances things out somewhat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Am I the only really not enjoying GoPri?

Villains are boring except for Close (RIP), and I haven't liked the Towa parts much so far. I'm a bit interested to see what will come of Kanata/Dyspear though.</br>  <br> liking Haruka </br>    <br><br>So /pc/ where are those MILF gopri doujins we were promised?</br></br>  <br><br>Great. Everytime I see this, I remember the Hime cute noises compilation. Did it sink together with pomf?</br></br>  <br> Did it sink together with pomf? <br>Pomf actually archived most of their files somewhere IIRC. I had it, but then my other PC fried. <br><br>She is a good girl with dreams and the courage to pursue them.</br></br></br></br>  I want to hear kutsukutskutsu.  <br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/l8<wbr>j135tqajh7r/Cute_Hime_Noises</wbr></br>  Just finished the manga. Judging from everyone else's reaction and the uncanny resemblance of the two. She finally snapped, right?  yes  she's a bear, jim.  <br>I was about to post this. Where can I find the other chapters?</br>  Kei is daijobu  <br>I wonder if we can see here again. She was the girl they saw before leaving the school right?<br> money says that she is still alive </br></br>  It's all Yuki's fault! The little retard made her snap!  <br>The little retard is keeping them together. On a side note, I wonder how she would react to being raped with her retard vision.</br>  <br>An even deeper delusion, where she's happily married, and her husband gives her sweet love every night...<br>Damn, that sounds depressing.</br></br>  <br>Delicious.</br>  Why do people complain about shovel being used goods when there is a literal goddess around?  <br> crossdressing boy </br>  I know this is a cute girls doing cute things, but why are adults almost completely absent? You would think there would be one adult that isn't infected  <br>Fuck off. Blonde Yui is a miracle.</br>  <br>Other humans in general have been pretty rare.</br>  <br> STANDING! </br>  Is het Ayaya the ultimate Ayaya?  <br>Now THAT I can fap to.</br>  <br>Footjob doujin when?</br>  I want them to be transported to the KinMoza world Ruu and Megu-nee included. They don't have to be dykes. I just don't want them to suffer. ;_;  <br>Wish granted.<br><br> The zombies are transported with them. </br></br></br>  <br> ON THE EDGE </br>  <br><br>Dig through the archives. Someone translated them sometime in the last 2 weeks or so.</br></br>  <br>The Mosaics can handle it... right?<br>Oh fuck. They're all goners once they encounter a blonde zombie.</br></br>  <br> ON THE CRATER </br>  <br> YOU FUCKED IT UP </br>  <br>I don't want to see my daughteru become a zombie</br>  <br> I'm sorry! </br>  I'm hoping the anime sparks enough interest so that scanlators pick up the pace.  <br>It's pretty caught up</br>  <br>I started self inserting myself and it got out of hand. It got to the point I went on patrol and I got bit but didn't tell the girls. Then I knew my time was running out so I gave into my selfish desires and molested one of them in the late night but didn't have the heart or condoms to ejaculate inside for possible infection. After the deed, I slide the revolver with one bullet that I found to her and tell her my situation. In the end I accepted everything.</br>  <br>There are only 2 chapters (36 &amp; 37) which have shit scans</br>  <br>We're caught up to the most recent chapter, though the last two are translated from Korean. The guy that usually does the Japanese scanlations is on vacation until next month.</br>  <br>You're a bad person even in your fantasies.</br>  <br>I wanna nipple on those thighs.</br>   It's all Yuki's fault! The little retard made her snap! <br><br> I think Yuki saw the onset of a nervous breakdown coming from Yuuri and knew what would come next, so she set the bear down, knowing that Yuuri might go back in and bring it back. She slipped it back there when nobody but Kurumi would see it. Yuki, of all people, knows this insanity shit better than most. </br></br>  This better have a happy ending. The girls are just trying to get by in a zombie infested world and so much bad shit has happened to them.  ;_;   <br><br>where can I find 36 and 37? it's not up on the manga sites or listed on manga updates.</br></br>  On another note, where do you think the anime will go? Original anime end, or will they stop with the "graduation"?  <br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/6asgq<wbr>jUM/file.html<br>http://www24.zippyshare.com/v/gerMN<wbr>YWC/file.html</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, she left the bear there and prayed to it as a memorial to all the dead children. Rii was never supposed to adopt it.</br>  <br>Graduation. I don't know why people think it'll suddenly veer off into anime original territory. It's exceedingly obvious that the author still wants to go to the same place, but is just taking a slightly new route in the anime to get there.</br>  <br> she's probably already eaten a few studentes <br>Zombies are already there</br></br>  <br><br>thanks anon</br></br>  In this universe, a yuru and a mosaic are straight.    <br><br>I feel like it's a bit TOO obvious. Maybe it's a fake out.</br></br>  <br>she's too far gone now, man.</br>  <br>I really love the authors paneling work that's what it's called right?</br>  <br>That's the great thing about this series. They've pulled enough bait-and-switch crap that people are left wondering if the ruse is itself a ruse and if it's all part of some mega-meta ruse.</br>  <br>TOO LEWD<br><br><br>TOO FUCKING LEWD</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't see a bad end, so far the girls always avoided permanent problems and are generally ok (zombie Shovel being the exception). One might die but that's it.</br>  <br> Ruu "crying" at night. <br><br>That's just fucked up.</br></br></br>  I can't wait for episode 3. This series is good.<br><br>I even got my sister into it. She likes horror.</br></br>  <br> but that's it <br>One of them dying isn't small.</br></br>  <br>Well, it's smaller than 4 of them dying, rape dungeons, army experiment guinea pigs.</br>  <br> are generally ok <br>Rii is even more messed up than cathat.<br>Shovel is dying.<br>Miki is going to see her 2nd close friend dead soon.<br>I doubt cathat can survive another megunee type trauma when she see shovel turn into a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's ok, anon. Please don't cry. </br>  <br>The thing is, I want to see more things. The problem with zombie scenarios is that they mostly go for the "some die, some live" part with a huge hope for a brighter tomorrow. I want to see a scenario where the girls lose their humanity little by little and on several aspects without going full edge/rape dungeon. And so far, I am satisfied. To have them turned so subtly into mental and physical wrecks and live through it would be so damn satisfying.</br>  <br>Kurumi has pulled off miracles before, she can do it again.</br>  Manga Rii looks like Shenua sometimes.  <br>But those things aren't going to happen. Death would badly fuck them up. They are very close and still young remember. Especially if Yuki died</br>  <br>I feel like if one of them dies it's pretty much over.</br>  <br><br>Fuuuuuuuuck. No wonder bigtits was having some weird visions.<br><br>Betting for the teddybear getting damaged, so that they have to sew it and end with an (imaginary) frankenloli</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they can handle losing Rii. But right now Kurumi and Yuki are their most important members, I don't think either of them will die unless it's at the end.</br>  Was the "Mii-kun! Pantsu!!" scene from last episode in the manga too ?<br><br> we might be in for a fanservicey ride </br></br>  <br> Kurumi and Yuki <br>You do realize that only leaves Miki, right?<br><br>She has proven to be strong completely on her own and doesn't even need Yuki's mental support all that much</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like Miki is the most likely to survive out of the bunch, though.</br>  <br>Miki could survive on her own. Kurumi could physically, but mentally would be fucked up if Yuki died. Rii couldn't survive their deaths physically or mentally. Yuki couldn't survive physically, but would probably just put up more barriers mentally</br>  So the chances that the group meets a family member is null by now, uh?. I guess they want to keep a "lord of the flies" atmosphere with no meddling adults.  <br>She was already beginning to break before they got there.
