Great Leadership there! <br>Three full Legions of the VASSAL STATE's forces.<br><br>You missed the point entirely. The Empire lost half its army and is vulnerable from rebellion, so before the word gets out he ordered the vassal kings to attack the JSDF and get themselves killed, so the potential future rebel forces get weeded out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he should have done some scouting before entering the Gate? Nah. Scouting is useless anyway.<br><br><br> so before the word gets out he ordered the vassal kings to attack the JSDF <br>Well that works too. A more valid reason.

What are you implying?</br>  Were kill numbers higher in manga or am i misremembering things?  <br> Maybe he should have done some scouting before entering the Gate? <br><br>Well, they did actually. They even took some Japanese slaves.<br><br>Didn't prevent them from being retarded though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These vassals seemed pretty eager to fight for the Empire. Seems like he just killed loyal subordinates for no good reason.</br>  <br>Do not doubt the emperor's tactical genius, fuckhead.</br>  <br>Most of the men there were driven by glory, and nothing else.<br><br>If they felt there were be more glory in overthrowing the Empire, they would not have hesitated in changing sides.<br><br>It also serves the secondary benefit of turning the land around the Capital into a chaotic mess, with rebels, mercenaries, and bandits adding to the scorched earth policy, buying time to shore the Capital up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Manga also said around 120k died by that point.</br>  <br>Even streaming is no excuse for that low quality with all the HD streams out there nowadays.</br>  Where are those webms brahs  I want to taste elf pussy.  I like this Itami version more than the manga version.<br>He looks here more like a competent soldier that doesn't show it on the first look, something that the manga failed to show.</br>   the Japanese <br> building friendly rapport with underdeveloped foreign villages in a war <br><br>hahha...HAHAHAHA</br></br></br>  So this is the power of Japan's military...<br><br>whoa..</br></br>  Why is the length of the day, the month, and the year for some reason the same in the Gate world as it is on Earth?   you need to be 2000 years ahead in warfare <br> and the enemy are mindless morons who can't learn <br> and you need to film it like they deserve it <br> and you have to look like a hero yourself <br> and all enemy women will jump on your dick for it <br>Just how big is Japan's inferiority complex?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.  One of the other kingdom/empires attacks the weakened empire later.  </br>  <br> pink  <br><br>nice</br></br></br>  So when do the volunteer "comfort women" come in?  The show is the equivalent of filming yourself beating up a bunch of preschoolers and uploading it to youtube.  <br>They wanted glory and plunder. That's why feudal lords go to war in the first place, who they're fighting for and why they're fighting doesn't matter as long as they think they'll win and there will be glory and plunder involved.</br>  <br> Doesnt Zorzel throw a coup then gets killed by bunny queen? Who becomes emperor after? </br>  <br>So big, not even two nukes could cover it.</br>  Fucking retard OP.    <br>It is, and I'm enjoying every second of it.</br>  <br>I think by the end of the story / gaidens  Pina looks to be heir apparent. She likes Itami though so we might end up with Itami as Emperor, may Rory help all their souls if that happens.  </br>  <br>Now that would be a video I'd like to see.</br>    <br>why is not asuka so shit?</br>  <br> he and bunny queen both kill each other </br>  <br> blocking bullets with a wood shield </br>  <br>They were against a mere 10,000 men, they don't want to be humiliated and they want the gate back before it gets worse.</br>  <br>Why is Tuka drawing her bow like a Japanese (arrow on the outside, string drawn well past the cheekbone and almost to the level of the ear, thumb draw), she's not fucking japaneeese<br><br>Not like Big Boss here</br></br></br>  <br>What about the other brother?</br>  <br>What is this, anyways?</br>  <br>Not a history major, but I believe that's bronze anon. Depending on how thick it is, it might stop one.</br>  <br>noooooooo [Spoiler]I hoped that they managed to free her[/Spoiler]</br>  <br>I'm not sure been a while since I read the spoilers. <br><br><br>Don't take the novel covers seriously, at that point Tuka should have her hi-tech bow she got in Japan but all the covers show her with that weird as fuck wood one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> [Spoiler] <br>ayyy</br></br>    <br> people don't know how to press control+s </br>  <br>my fail...</br>  <br>HAHA thats the first thing I noticed as well. gothic loli and she is wearing pink.</br>   US doesn't want to enter the gate despite knowing it's a potential for territory reasons <br>Why is the writing so awfully biased?</br>  <br>in-universe reason is because US is too busy dealing with mudslimes to commit troops to the gate<br>Although it's quite surprising they haven't sent at least an american liason there, not like japan could do anything to stop them</br></br>  <br>Because CHINA is evil. America is just stupid (In this manga universe).</br>  <br>In Gate World the middle east conflict is a lot more wide spread and violent so US is tied up there with their forces. They are supplying Japan though and even the Japanese diplomats know that they're going to have to let the US come in to the gate eventually. This shit is covered in like the first few chapters of the manga.</br>  <br> the first thing the local military does is attack the civilians of the other side <br> after losing the offensive, the feudal lords are dumb enough to let themselves get slaughtered on the kings commands without raising an eyebrow <br>ayy</br></br></br>   Axis Forces: 130,000 dead   <br> Those 20 POWs <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br>  <br> First Legend of Galactic Heroes <br> Then Log Horizon <br> Now this. <br><br>Can someone explain to me how AD Vision's anime version of Mutineer's Moon stalled out when it appears Japan has the exact same sci-fi sensibilities as Baen Books?<br><br>At this point all we're missing is "Aliens invade, but humans are natural-born killing machines."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally know nothing about the country or world beyond the gate. <br><br>AND YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE?!? WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE, HOW THEIR POLITICS WORK, ETC ETC?!?<br><br>Now im not saying you have to make friends with them, thats just MC's way of doing things, in the manga his recon team out of the 6 that were sent out is the only one that actually makes friends with locals initially. But to knock down the idea of learning more about the nations villages and state of the world is just silly anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than the square steak</br>  <br>The villages don't really give a shit about Imperial politics.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need sauce.</br>  <br> Streaming <br><br>Holy fuck why would you do this to your eyes?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to bury my ass in her face.</br>  <br>How did big boss lose? Where's your dogs at?</br>  <br> I wonder if all those lost troops lead to problems later on? Like a lack of Defense to further external Threats. <br>Yep, and internal threats as well.</br></br>  <br>it is not wrong, it's just unrealistic to think that the all Japanese army are so pure and peaceful against an enemy that killed 150 civilians. Some hothead there is everywhere, but in this manga all nips are champions of justice.</br>  <br> bronze <br> stopping a bullet <br><br>5.56 (M193) flies through modern hardened steel body armor (level III) plates at close range.<br><br>Bronze is a lot softer than steel, which is a lot softer than hardened high carbon steel. If you were using bronze, you'd have to rely solely on thicknesss to hope to stop a bullet, making a shield that size impossible to even lift without heavy machinery<br><br>Even a steel shield that size rated for rifle centerfire cartridges would be impossibly heavy, there's a reason modern ballistic shields are made of ceramics and Kevlar, and even those are fucking heavy<br><br>so yeah, bullshit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon please</br>  <br>Damn, Rory looks fucking retarded with those "cat ears".</br>   Gate opens in Poland  <br> Crudely assembled military forces doing somehow well only GROM guys doing great, lots of guys are Witcher fanboys.  <br> Lots of vodka smuggled everyday beyond gate <br> Politicians are even more at each other throats and prevent any big progress to be made <br> Rusians are told to GTFO and end USA gets all access and take over operations there but need to move more stuff into Poland (so there is something we gains by this) <br> This cause more political shitstorm <br> Most and often first word from out world learned by people beyond Gate is 'kurwa' </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I found the answer in under 40 seconds.<br>I believe in you, you can do it!</br></br>  <br>If I angle my shield perfectly, I can deflect bullets.</br>  <br>Yes this is the power of a modern nation with a.......sorta developed modern military..... vs a roman empire like army<br><br>What did you expect? this is guns and tanks vs swords and shields. we have come a long way since we fought with sword and shield. Even back when firearms were first introduced into warfare and they needed 4 min to reload the damn things they still kicked the asses of everyone who didnt have them. Look at Oda Nobunaga who took over most of japan using firearms.</br></br></br>  <br>During the Cold War, US military doctrine stipulated that America should have the capability to fight "two and a half" wars at once, in anticipation of having to fight WW3 both in Europe and the Pacific just like WW2.<br><br>Nowadays it's supposed to be "fight two wars at once and decisively win one of them".<br><br>Even if America was busy with fighting ISIS on the ground, they have more than enough resources left over to support an intervention in Japan if they really wanted to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>soon my anon, soon. and they are monster girls too</br>  <br> So the Empire sent at least THREE FULL LEGIONS to their death? Great Leadership there! <br>He ends up pretty clever actually.<br><br> Uses the potential rebels of smaller nations to be slaughtered. <br> Later begins to see his daughter's competency and the true danger of the JSDF. <br> Sees his first son steadily become more idiotic, and begins priming him to take the fall by declaring him to be the successor. <br> Diablo the second son sees this and tries to form his own faction. <br> Both sons' rebellions fail and Pina is left as the only heir. <br><br>And he survives it all, IIRC. Diablo saw his scheme, and tried to take over the Empire after Zorzal's defeat and turn on the JSDF (IIRC, with Chinese assistance), only for it to fall through.<br><br>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em. And set your daughter up with one of 'em with influence; preferably the one that also has a demi-goddess on his side.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You also forget the part where polish women whore themselves to orks and pigmen.</br>  <br> polish_alpha.webm <br>you know the one</br></br>  <br>if I pull the trigger once more, I can empty the rest of my magazine<br><br>then load another<br><br>better yet, switch to a belt fed machine gun or a minigun</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> his second son name was Diablo <br> What the fuck was he thinking?</br></br>  <br>JAPERICA, FUCK YEAH!</br>  <br>I said bullets, anon.

People like to call the US an imperial power but the fact is that the American people hate imperialism. Americans don't have the willpower to fight imperial wars which is why vietnam was so unpopular. The best deal the US could get is cheap trades on the resources coming from the GATE.

Plus it would be an extremely unpopular move back home.<br><br> People don't know what's happening the other side <br>They will eventually, unless you plan on never allowing the soldiers sent there back home.

I have to go out for dinner tonight, hopefully the Chinese scans come out when I come back.  <br>They kinda overdid it with the heads.Poor Noumus.</br>  <br>Does Hands's quirk work on Noumos?</br>  <br>since the sternritter villan group which is basically the nazi regime stereotype.<br><br>fucking lamest shit ever. really spells out how bad bleach really is. <br>it just got away with the arrancars because badass death metal demon creatures n shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whats facepalms quirk?</br></br>  <br>nigga they showed it twice</br>  Wheres my boy at Horikoshi?  <br>In general ed.</br>  <br><br>His power is crushing knives with his bare hands?</br></br>  <br>Did you just skip the USJ arc?</br>  <br> wait all day yesterday <br> go to bed early cause fuck it it will be up by then <br> still no scans </br></br></br>  <br>its decaying,but since he was worrying about a certain hand,he may have other quirks maybe with other hands</br>  <br> Go to bed late yesterday; hoped I'd get the scans <br> "Fuck let's sleep it'll be up by tomorrow, i'll read it before work" <br> still no scans <br>I'm so hyped for this chapter and this whole arc</br></br></br></br>  Shit it's been red on ishuhui for 8 hours now...  <br><br><br>Is this what suffering feels like?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was explained by Naomasa Tsukauchi (cop guy, All Might's friend). Shigaraki's quirk is disintegration, he can completely destroy whatever he holds with his own hands (the special U.A. gate that kept out the press, Aizawa's elbow, Stain's knife) <br><br>He protected that hand because he called it 'father' before. That hand means a lot to him. It doesn't have a special quirk of its own: a dead hand can't have a quirk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been following Berserk and HxH for years now, I suffered already but I'm not imune to it yet.</br>  <br>So thats why he's a villain in the same vein of Bakugou, poor motherfuckers cant masturbate.</br>  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>251</wbr>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>Finally.</br></br>  <br>THE 5 MINUTES ARE OVER<br><br>FINALLY</br></br></br>  <br> IIDA LIVES YES.  </br>  <br>Good, man.</br>  <br>Is it too late at night to summon Translatorfag?</br>  <br>We don't know that anon. The hands on his face + the hands all over his body might still hold quirks, we still haven't been informed.<br><br>If the author really does intend to make Facepalm the anti thesis to Deku, then it wouldn't be strange for him to somehow have multiple quirks (in the form of hands).</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Iida's saying some epic shit.<br>What do you think GT and Deku are talking about in the beginning ?</br></br>  <br>Deko has no Quirk<br>Hands has many quriks.<br>its the opposite</br></br></br>  <br/>  Begin the SUMMONING!  <br><br>SPIRAL STAIRCASE</br></br>  <br>To me those hands seem more like an unwillingness to let things go than anything else. <br><br>The way they are positioned on his body gives me this sensation as well. If you look clearly, you can see that they're all positioned in a way that would restrain a person (around his neck, under his arms like how you would lift a toddler, on his arms etc.) <br><br>If they still contain their quirks and they would work in the way you said, it'll need a lot of explanation. To me personally it sounds like nonsense, but we can only wait and see. (Besides, if he had to use multiple quirks at the same time, I reckon he'd become brainless just like Noumu, the body can't take that many quirks and still function perfectly)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Premum vos Translator</br>  <br>People were really expecting him to die ?</br>  <br><br>Maybe to use the quirks he literally has to swap hands?</br></br>  <br><br>Well he will still probably turn to villain, violent vigilante or get crippled, since Deku said that one line in hindsight.</br></br>  <br>The one on his face is the one whose quirk he's using.</br>  <br>He will probably lead to the death of someone else, get expulsed and then go vigilante I think.</br>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>thank you</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127868652 <br>No need to be rude, it was obvious he was going to live even with the pic above, maybe the guys was just excited or something.</br>  <br> replying to shitposters </br>  <br>I forgot what website I was on for a moment sorry.</br>  <br>Looks like Deku is going to fight some Noumu Rip offs. HYPE</br>  Why doesn't anyone realize that Iida will get seriously injured to the point of probably not being a hero anymore but then being helped by gadget girl and her gadgets.  <br>Robocop?</br>  <br>ABRAKA DABRA</br>  <br>For Iida It´s a better route than the Noumu one</br>  <br> It wasn't a single ennemy <br> It was a hero-killer prototype <br> Next arc will be full of Noumu 2.0,3.0 and so on </br></br></br>  <br>Shit got real, really fucking fast.</br>  <br>The series got shittier ever since Aizen became the villain and the fascist Japanese afterlife officers became the heroes</br>  Why does Gran Torino dress like 8-bit Megaman?  <br>BACK IN MY DAY SUPERHEROES HAD STYLE</br>  <br>Translatorfag here.

You're going to see action on the big stage kid, so get excited! <br> &gt;We're taking the Shinkansen straight to Shinjuku then? <br> &gt;You bet <br> &gt;In other words, <br> &gt;cutting through Hosu district <br> &gt;(I'm worried about Tenya) <br> &gt;Better give him a text </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek, not sure if intended.</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;(I'm worried about Tenya) <br> &gt;&gt;Better give him a text <br>what a bro.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sorry guys, Deku is supposed to say Iida in that last page, as per Japanese social customs <br><br> &gt;Meanwhile, at Hosu District <br> &gt;Another day on the patrol,  <br> &gt;Sorry if it's the same-old same-old.  <br> &gt;No... <br> &gt;This is exactly what I want <br> &gt;So um... <br> &gt;Pardon me if I'm blunt... <br> &gt;You're after the Hero-Killer aren't you? <br> &gt;Well... <br> &gt;I really can't think of any other reason you'd come to our agency <br> &gt;Just so you know, I'm glad to have you here, but uh... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Deku might meet stain huh?

WHERE ARE THEY IN THIS CHAPTER AUTHOR-SAN  <br>Those pictures were from the oumagadoki zoo epilogue. Read the thread.</br>  <br>The fuck are you talking bout? That was in epilogue in author's other work.</br>  <br>Those were from a special chapter, already translated by FA: http://bato.to/read/_/330702/oumaga<wbr>doki-zoo_v5_ch38_by_fallen-angels</wbr></br>  <br>This B-list hero dude is pretty moe<br><br> &gt;You really shouldn't carry personal matters into the job <br> &gt;We heroes have no legal authority to arrest or convict criminals. <br> &gt;While we're permitted to use our quirks in assisting law-enforcement, <br> &gt;Personal retributions <br> &gt;Would be just as criminal in the eyes of the law.  <br> &gt;Don't take it the wrong way, I'm not saying that Hero-Killer ain't a bad guy... <br> &gt;You just look like a very earnest person, so I don't want you to do anything rash <br> &gt;I'm not trying to lecture or anything <br> &gt;Thank you for your advice <br> &gt;But then... <br> &gt;How...!? <br> &gt;How can I let this go?? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;Personal retributions <br> &gt;&gt;Would be just as criminal in the eyes of the law. <br>oh no ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Iida you dense motherfucker.</br>  <br><br> &gt;Elsewhere, Hosu District <br> &gt;Ah, Hosu District <br> &gt;Grander than I expected... <br> &gt;More sacrifices must be made... <br> &gt;To cleanse this city! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is he being such a bitch? <br>It's not like his brother is dead.</br></br>  <br>It's really amazing how the artstyle for major villains is different.</br>  <br><br>The 90's!<br><br>THE 90'S!</br></br></br></br>  <br>he just wants  to be a proper hero </br>  <br><br> &gt;Is this the "unfinished business" you spoke of? <br> &gt;You lot do catch on quick <br> &gt;Yeah yeah, give us another sarcastic quip why don't you? <br> &gt;Only those who accomplish extraordinary things are fit to be called "heroes"! <br> &gt;But oh so many materialists have now come to pervert this word! <br> &gt;Until this world realises its own foolishness, <br> &gt;I'll never stop my labour! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blah blah blah Family Honor, Blah blah blah Yamato-damashii, blah blah blah</br>  <br>What? Is Stain like Villain Batman or something? <br> This city needs a Villain </br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;But then... <br> &gt;&gt;How...!? <br> &gt;&gt;How can I let this go?? <br>fucking hell u stupid fuck, this is like the rescue park arc all over again</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess he just hates seeing the concept of heroes becoming a mere job.</br></br>  <br><br> &gt;What an eloquent wordsmith of a violent psychopath <br> &gt;That idiot is so mighty epic I can cry <br> &gt;No ordinary idiot can achieve what he did... <br> &gt;? <br> &gt;The fact is, every city he terrorized experienced a visible drop in crimes <br> &gt;One talking head even proclaimed him equivalent to a hero, adding a storming popular controversy to his resume <br> &gt;I get it! Keep the heroes on their toes by eliminating them slacks on the doles.  <br> &gt;A killer who both destroys and refines heroes?  <br> &gt;Very twisted! <br> &gt;I can't stand that guy, boy does he piss me off... <br> &gt;Blackmist, release the Noumous!  <br> &gt;.... <br> &gt;He's not gonna cut me and just walk away <br> &gt;Destruction? I'll take him on!  <br> &gt;We'll have make this a race </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact is, every city he terrorized experienced a visible drop in crimes <br><br>Why would that even happen?</br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;Get ready to be upstaged, big shot! </br></br>  <br> Despair_but_also_a_boner.png </br>  <br> rekt 4 incompetent heroes <br> replace with more competent heroes <br> ???? <br> profit </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The dialogue seems to imply that the remaining heroes are of a higher quality, but thinking about it it's more likely that the villains are just shitting themselves in fear because there's a guy outside who has no problem with murdering them.</br></br>  I'm hoping that the hand he has in his face is just a decoration/part of his villian costume, and that when he takes it off, he gets an extra power.  <br>The heroes step up their game in response to the attacks, also maybe some criminals piss their pants and lay low.</br>  <br>Most likely it's like a cop getting killed. The other cops work overtime to show that shit like that isn't acceptable.</br>  <br>It's his father's.</br>  <br><br>What are they supposed to do when they run out of heroes? If there is an effect, why would it be so local? Surely if Stain has an effect, it should be in the general hero population, not in just one place.<br><br>Bah, I hate it when a story justifies some evil dumb plan with a hand-wave like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Release the Noumous <br>Oh boy here we go</br></br></br>  <br>when heroes get rekt by Stain, the living ones decide that it's best to become crazy good at fighting or something in order to survive. like, when Stain's in the area heroes are more on guard and smarter so they don't die, and this inadvertently causes them to become better heroes in general.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127872316 <br>No picture?</br>  <br><br>oops, my bad<br><br> &gt;It'll be nightfall by the time we arrive, will that be alright? <br> &gt;The later the better! <br> &gt;More crimes happen at night, more exhilarating for us <br> &gt;I'm not sure if I agree with the second part... <br> &gt;Taking out your cellphones already! Pah! You kids these days! <br> &gt;Still no response... <br> &gt;...He's always the type of person that replies within 3 minutes  <br> &gt;[Ladies and gentleman, we're about to apply the emergency breaks, please hold on to your seats!] </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;Who the hell is this....!? <br> &gt;A hero?! <br> &gt;AHHHHHHHHHH!! </br></br></br></br>  <br>He only kills 4 heroes per zone, as we saw in the tournament there are lots of heroes and each year there are a lot more coming from academies.<br><br>I short of understand why crimes would drop after Stain visits, he defeats useless heroes that do nothing so the rest knows they should be more wary and get stronger/work harder, also they wouldnt send weak heroes to that zone after what Stain did, so i guess those districts gets more stronger with better capable heroes.<br><br>Also Stain said he has no problem killing villains, so even if we dont know how many did he killed im sure he killed a lot and some villains would be scared to do some shit after he has been near them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;!!? <br> &gt;EEEYYYAAAAHHH! <br> &gt;Noumou?! <br> &gt;SIT TIGHT KID! <br> &gt;Huh? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  It seems like crime would drop because all the hero 'wannabes' would stop fighting crime, while the serious ones would step their game up. The students went against villains on their little field trip and came out better because of it, I'm sure a life and death situation does wonders  <br> ABAJ <br> ABAJ <br> ABAJ <br> ABAJ </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;Gran Torino! <br> &gt;GRAN TORINO!! <br> &gt;!! <br> &gt;What's going on!? <br> &gt;Wait..! This is Hosu District! <br> &gt;Iida! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks like Noumus have a thing for smashing heroes heads in the ground</br>  <br><br><br>every fucking time</br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;What's happening all of a sudden...!? <br> &gt;We gotta go help, Tenya, let's roll! <br> &gt;.... </br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Stain is an anti-hero?</br>  <br>also pretty traumatic, that face Tsuyu and Grapes made?</br>  <br>He's a psychopath with a creed he kills in the name of</br>  <br>More like a villain that isnt that bad, killing innocent heroes doesnt make you an anti-hero, but he has some "noble" purpose to it</br>  <br>Aquaman is gonna die saving Iida ass, right?</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;But oh so many materialists have now come to pervert this word! <br>Uraraka better watch out.</br></br>  <br>No, more like report his ass.</br>  <br><br> &gt;What fool is causing that ruckus...? <br> &gt;I'll see to you as well, but first... <br> &gt;I'll complete... <br> &gt;My duty here... <br> &gt;Can't....move..!! <br> &gt;...Curse you villain! <br> &gt;If you fancy yourself a hero.. <br> &gt;You ought to choose your last words wiser... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;A child in a costume... <br> &gt;Who are you? <br> &gt;Urrghh! </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, claiming you have a purpose doesn't make you less bad, serial killers often have a pattern in their victims.</br>  <br>If you think about it, I kind of like how the world is set up now. Sure Uraraka's intention of getting money for her parents is noble, but it distorts what a hero is and just turns the title into a regular job.</br>  <br>That's what I thought</br>  <br>Stain must have been a hero at some point. Seems he really values the core of being a hero.</br>  <br><br> &gt;Leave! This is no place for children <br> &gt;A blood red scarf, and clad in blades <br> &gt;You're the Hero-Killer they call Stain, aren't you?! <br> &gt;! <br> &gt;How I have hunted you! <br> &gt;And now here you are!  <br> &gt;I am....! <br> &gt;Here for grudge? <br> &gt;Watch yourself, <br> &gt;If needed be, I will target children. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True but her reasoning is one of the least selfish reasons to become a hero. A duty to protect others is the core to becoming a great hero, and that resolve will drive uraraka into becoming a great hero. But remember that she is going to a aiding in rescue and not technically fighting.</br>  <br>See, Stain is a good guy,  r-right? </br>  <br>  bloodthirsty killer who "doesn't kill kids" <br><br>whatever helps you sleep</br></br></br>  <br>She's in the front line for now, man. And if Stain get a word of her intentions, and willing to, she might get in danger. Again. Just like my boy Ida here.</br>  <br>Yeah she is, but there are other people who are just in it for the fame. It reminds of Tiger and Bunny a bit</br>  <br>I'm more worried about Mt. Lady.</br>  <br>  Stain starts cutting down Lady like Ichigo wanted to do to the Menos </br>  <br><br> &gt;So... <br> &gt;Looking for a worthy target, are you? <br> &gt;Listen up! <br> &gt;Villain!  <br> &gt;I am the brother, <br> &gt;Of the hero you've attacked!  <br> &gt;The brother of the best and worthiest hero!  <br> &gt;Here to stop you in his stead! <br> &gt;(Will you take up my mantle?) <br> &gt;And you'll remember this name for the rest of your life! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking Iida, really.</br>  <br><br> &gt;INGENIUM!  <br> &gt;IS THE HERO THAT WILL DEFEAT YOU!  <br> &gt;Is it now? <br> &gt;Then die! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;What an eloquent wordsmith of a violent psychopath <br>I love your wording</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the translation.</br>  <br>That shit here is HYPE as fuck.<br><br>But also, IDA, THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.

Iida knows that Deku isn't someone to underestimate.</br>  <br>Huge Hands Hans</br>  <br>The world needs necessary evils like Stain to do the dirty work that others won't dare touch.</br>  <br>He's the villain that Hosu deserves, but not the one it needs right now.</br>  <br> INGENIUM <br><br>Do it, Iida, kill him.<br><br>And I don't see why people are saying Stains murders lowering crime don't make sense, it's just because heroes will work harder and not be so lazy around their district if someone is killed on their watch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pls no ;_;<br><br><br>You got a point. But still this is more of "muh famiry honor" issue than simple pride</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It seems that Horikoshi actually gives some thought to the villains' motives. Though I want to see if Handsfree has something more going on for him other than "I hate All Might because he is poplar".</br></br>  <br>Probably Shigaraki's family tree always clashing with Mights.</br>  <br>He's a manchild. Think of him as /v/ personified</br>  So basically the guy who killed lida's brother is an anti-hero like Lunatic, from Tiger and Bunny.<br><br>Stain is the hero they deserve, but not the one that they need.</br></br>  <br>Of course he will, but you can't reveal all the cards on your would-be major villain so early.</br>  <br><br>Deku is going to be tied up dealing with the Noumus. He wont know Iida has confronted Stain until Stain arrives and tells him himself. That's when Deku is going to lose his shit and get Torino killed because he has to bail his ass out.</br></br>   he is called a villian <br> 'go away i dont hurt kids' <br><br>he probably had a tragic past or was bullied by other heroes due to his looks<br><br>FeelsBadMan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His power made no sense.<br><br>It was fire that was stronger than Fire Emblems and an unusual blue green colour that he could also shoot using his special crossbow, okay, but he was also strong enough to tank hits from hundred power, and he was somehow able to phase through physical surfaces with his fire without burning through them. What?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He doesn't kill just for the sake of killing, he could be an ex-hero that started doing what he felt is right or just a criminal with standards.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, BnHA in a nutshell is essentially Tiger and Bunny, meets One Punch Man, meets Sky High.</br>  <br>tsuyu seems really popular with western artists.</br>  <br>He probably was a hero before. Probably was a huge moralfag ala Shirou.</br>   Hero turned "villain" because he hates the current state of heroes who become heroes for fame and glory <br> Removes weak heroes and they get replaced by stronger, more fitting heroes <br> Said heroes clean up the streets, resulting in less crimes all around <br> Soon weak willed people won't become heroes just for recognition, while true heroes with proper virtues will still become heroes <br>STAIN DID NOTHING WRONG.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think that Ingenium was particularly weak.</br>  <br><br>The sheer amount of lines Horikoshi draws for a weekly series is astonishing.<br>Like sure he probably has assistants doing backgrounds but damn.</br></br></br>  <br>Bad Luck Ingenium or he's really a dick of a hero.</br>  <br>I'd argue he's the best artist in Jump right now, which helps him out a lot.</br>  <br>Him and shokugeki no soma artist</br>  <br>Something along the logic of applying a violent judicator to separate the wheat from the chaff. <br><br>And as another anon pointed out, Stain also targets criminals.</br></br></br>  <br><br>They probably pretty even, though I'd say Horikoshi has better character designs.</br></br>  <br>how long until his quality drops?<br>i mean, weekly realises can fuck you up.</br></br>  <br>It can only get better as it becomes more popular.</br>  <br>Well TOSH did draw doujins way back so I'd say he has plenty of experience</br>  <br>i like your optimism anon.</br>  <br>I hope it's just his power that make him look like that, like All-might.</br>  <br>Yeah, yeah. Hopefully he gets an assistant that's good in backgrounds.</br>  <br><br>Goddamn this guy, I don't know who has the biggest pair of balls in this series, Ida or Deku.</br></br>  <br> No Grape <br>His hair is literally made of balls</br></br>  <br><br>Even Uraka has big balls in the right scenario.<br>All we need is a scene where Grapes mans the fuck up.</br></br></br>  Where's drawfag-sama when you need him?  I wonder if these guys will pair up to take one of these Noumu's down.  <br> going full Aye and Bee <br>Fuck yea</br></br>  <br>Well he has six assistants.</br>  <br> 1 hardens, the other uses him as weapon. <br>Make it happens Horikoshi</br></br>    <br>Is Hiroyuki a she or a he? Anyway, I already like him/her.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875041 <br>Shes Momo, Hiroyuki is the assistant's name</br>  <br>That's one healthy nee-san</br>  <br><br>You're totally right, attempted murdering and actual crippling is no reason to be mad.</br></br>  <br>More like a well-intentioned extremist in a way. <br>He still kills innocent people with no remorse and I'm pretty sure he hasn't targeted anyone that's worse than him amongst the villains, if he attacks those guys at all.<br><br>Can't exactly call him an anti-villain, since those are more for antagonists that have noble or moral qualities.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what is her pixiv tag?</br>  <br> but what the fuck is wrong with Denki's skin? <br><br>He tans easily?</br></br></br>   http://www.theouthousers.com/index<wbr>.php/news/131964-first-two-marvel-m<wbr>anga-artist-variant-covers-revealed<wbr>.html</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br>So yeah Mangakas are making alternate Marvel covers. I wonder who Horikoshi will draw</br>  I don't recall now, does he cripple or kill the heroes?  <br>Both</br>  <br>Hori is a HUGE Spiderman fag.</br>  <br>What, like Dexter?<br><br>Also, not bloodthirsty or chaotic doesn't mean not a murderous psychopath.<br><br>That being said, I still enjoy is edgy 90s villain style.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> http://www.theouthousers.com/index<wbr>.php/news/131964-first-two-marvel-m<wbr>anga-artist-variant-covers-revealed<wbr>.html</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br>The are hiring nips because they are cheap and do a better job, don't get ideas this is an America company we talking about.</br></br>  <br>Murata already did that one, not that it's a bad thing considering how good Murata's art is.</br>  Stain (the new villian) confirmed to be 'CHAOTIC GOOD'?  <br>Nihei will do X-Men</br>  <br>Thanks for the dump and translation as always anon.</br>  <br>More like Chaotic Neutral at best.<br><br>A lot of messed up people believe themselves to be 'in the right', so I suppose he has good goals in his own opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>Seems more of a chaotic neutral to me. He only wants strong-willed people on both sides : strong willed villains against strong willed heroes. To me, he is seeking a balance by only removing the extra weigth on one side of the scale.</br>  <br> light neutral evil <br>topkeks</br></br>  <br><br>If Stain can put them out of commission, then clearly they're weak.<br><br> This guy's a bit crazy if you hadn't noticed. </br></br></br></br>  Is stain back story going to be a extra, or just a 1 page flash back? I wish for the latter.  <br>There you are! One classy lady, in her hero outfit, because heroes deserve other heroes. Show off your drawfagging skills here too, that'd be cool.<br><br><br>I am here, but I think the -sama suffix may be a bit too much. Dont you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>"Sensei can give people quirks" im willing to bet Facepalm was quirkless before meeting him</br>  <br>Iida will become one of them.</br>  <br><br>So soft and motherly</br></br>  <br>Gotta love how anti-Edge this series is.</br>  He has the ability to steal, store, and implant quirks. He goes around stealing quirks to implant them into people.<br><br> Deku had a quirk in the past but it was stolen from him while it was still developing, leaving everyone to assume he was quirkless.  <br><br> This is total bullshit and probably won't be true. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There you are! I'm the KoF fag that is always asking you to draw BnHA characters in their clothing. Could you please, draw Momo's face in this Leona picture here? <br><br>Thanks for all the great stuff you blessed me with so far, and sorry for the trouble.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well of course, since it's already been said in the first chapter that Deku as an extra joint on his little toe (or rather, "normal" people have one fewer), which is a sign that the mutation related to quirks isn't present.</br>  <br><br>dude don't kid yourself like 80% of the doujins are going to be Midoriya and Bakugou/Todoroki.<br><br>BnHA rules but the fujo is really strong with this series.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're welcome for all the other art. It's a small effort, I'm having fun with the requests<br><br>So you just want me to change her facial features? Should I change her hair color too while I'm at it?</br></br></br>  Aquaman dies, Gran torino dies, Iida goes to jail or cant be a hero anymore, deku's strengthening has begun.  <br><br>mind-kun being pudgy makes him all the more terrifying</br></br>  <br><br>oops, meant to write hand-kun</br></br>  <br> mfw the doctor was the thief the whole time. </br>  <br><br>Yes, I think Leona's body type and clothing don't need any changes, just swapping her head with Momo's would be good.<br><br>The hair color change would be nice as well, since Momo is a raven haired bjin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> So let's go beat up some villains <br><br>Damn now that's what I call hands on experience</br></br></br>  <br>IT'S HAPPENING</br>  <br>Oh my god smartphones actually serve their purpose</br>  <br> Deku's avatar is All Might <br>so moe</br></br>  You think Stain will have a flashback to explain his motives, and then survive for a next time, or he's just going to be defeated on the spot?  <br> &gt;&gt;Taking out your cellphones already! Pah! You kids these days! <br><br>I love this grumpy old man.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to say I'm disappointed at the lack of invisible girl, but I can't really prove she isn't there</br>  <br>Light and Ryuk's places should be switched.</br>  <br><br>Even if he came in time he would get fucked up.<br><br>I mean we really have two options.<br><br>1.Iida gets fucked up to the point where he has to stop being a hero <br>2. Iida's hero instructor gets fucked up in his place and he turns even more edgy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, so Tsuyu has normal feet after all.</br>  <br>Neutral or lawful evil.<br><br>Also D&amp;D alignments are fucking retarded and you should kill yourself for bringing them up.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or:<br><br>3. Iida kills Stain or otherwise violates the law, losing his ability to ever be a licensed hero.<br><br>or<br><br>4. Iida gets captured by Shigaraki in co. and gets noumu'd</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You think Stain will have a flashback to explain his motives, and then survive for a next time, or he's just going to be defeated on the spot? <br>He's going to win, duh.</br></br>  <br><br>Are we even reading the same mango?</br></br>  <br>It took a little longer because I had to go out, but here she is, anon. I hope it's what you expected</br>  <br>Why is Gran Torino so damn cool? I love this little guy.</br>  <br> implying Iida has any chance at all at winning. </br>  <br>He gives no fucks.</br>  <br>Damn, that guy survived getting punched through a moving train.</br>  <br>Damn this manga moves fast</br>  <br>All the "If only I knew about it sooner" "If only I pushed the question harder" Foreshadowing by Deku on the last chapters implies this. Shit is going down. Lasting consequences.</br>  <br><br>People were surprised the tournament in the Sports Festival arc was so short<br><br> Horikoshi says it ended up over twice as long as he thought it should be <br><br>We're moving really fucking quick here. I guess the breakneck pacing is because the whole manga is supposed to be focused on Midoriya's school years (3 years, tops) and I doubt he wants to do any significant timeskips.<br><br>Everything in the manga so far has occurred in about ~1, 1 1/2 months since he started school.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the first chapter he says it's his tale of becoming the top hero, so there has to be some time after he finishes school to show him rising to the top of heroism.</br>  <br>STAIN?</br>  Please let iida get his confidence destroyed  <br> Horikoshi says it ended up over twice as long as he thought it should be <br>That still boggles my mind. What could possibly be left out?</br></br>  So, they will release different noumu in other places so the other kids have to fight them as well right?  <br>No?</br>  <br><br>Not the requesting anon, but that's a nice edit.</br></br>  <br>Oda's the best artist in jump.<br>Though his art hasn't been at it's best lately.</br></br>  <br>nothing's more frightening than unironical Odatards.</br>  <br>Them momos<br><br>I just love how every girl looks so plump and healthy</br></br></br>  <br>Let's not do this in this thread, ok?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, Souma's artist is pretty fucking good. Amazing he went from doing hentai doujins to a fucking cook manga.</br></br>  <br>Make a point against my statement.</br>  <br>Stop.</br>  <br>Yeah, chara design is shit.<br> Girls are melons on a stick </br></br>  <br>Maybe, blackmist can teleport you know.</br>  <br>Assistants.</br>   "Some dude beat up my brother that has been a hero for years." <br> "I better go and defeat that guy even though i have barely any experience!" </br>  <br>i want him to get rekt so hard, get someone else killed so that maybe he'll properly suffer for the rest of his life. no one should be this stupid in horikoshi's universe.</br>  <br>Everyone has assistants.<br>You can do better than that.</br></br>  <br><br>I guess it's supposed to underscore how much Iida worshiped his brother but it does kinda make him look like a retard- even if he doesn't think he can win.<br><br>I mean, I'd just take up my brother's name, put Stain on my shitlist, and git gud so I could beat him. Stain goes after heroes anyway, so if you just work he's bound to show up some day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The character designs are made to look that way because they are based off of Western cartoons.<br><br>Oda's actual art style looks very different from the one he uses for One Piece characters.</br></br></br>  <br>thank you anon!</br>  FA sure is taking forever.  <br>this is like saying togashi showed his great skills in drawing in the final chapter of greed island arc and posting the picture of the turkey</br>  Does anyone else get the feeling this whole thing will be blown over with no lasting effects? Iida will get away scot free and nobody will have any lasting injuries. <br>The heavy handed foreshadowing just reminds me too much of Deku's monologue in the USJ arc where he talks about how unprepared they were to face Noumu.</br>  <br>at much he's going to get the hero name of his brother forever tainted<br>don't understimate SJ</br></br>  <br>Looks like shit</br>  So Gran Torino is based of Clint Eastwood right?  <br><br>The hair needs editing as well, but nice work with the face</br></br>  <br>ahh yes, that was an oversight. Let's do this.</br>  The heroes from the chapter 48 are going to defend the city, calling it.  <br>Aren't they in completely different districts though?</br>  Oda fans let's unite to shit talk about another great series for no reason <br><br> quirks are similar to devil fruit in their uniqueness  <br>  both has great character design(well oda been kinda close to same facing the females ) <br> the villians are great in both  <br> both MC are great(even if deku is OP)  <br> and as for emotions well BnHA is kinda lacking in making me feel anything besides excited and oda flashback skills are top notch so it's kinda hard to compare(if oda did todo flashback, todo mother would be died and endeavor is somehow at fault) </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;and as for emotions well BnHA is kinda lacking in making me feel anything besides excited <br>50 chapter, it's only the beginning. Did you feel nothing at Todo backstory ?<br>Deku isn't OP though. He will be, but right now he's small time compared to Baku and Todo.<br>I also find the concept of the quirks much more interesting than the devil fruit, cause it's a thing that everyone has, and that everyone can tamper with.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Oda fans let's unite <br>not your personal army faggot</br></br>  <br>Better question is - who is the strongest OP character MHA universe can defeat? I guess they can beat Nami and Usopp, but Brook is already too fast to anyone in MHA verse.</br>  Be honest anons, do you think that the art of BnHA is good?<br>I usually see people praising it, but before reading opinions I thought that the art was only ok myself. The best thing that I can say about it is that it looks unique without looking bad, so, not generic.<br><br>A issue that I have with it is how the characters doesn't seems to properly represent their stature. Bakugou for example is 172cm tall, he's about the same size of Luffy, taller than Naruto, but still looks rather childish.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks again, Drawfag-san</br></br>  <br> Be honest anons, do you think that the art of BnHA is good? <br>Yes, as another artist I find BnHA's art very good.</br></br>  <br>I just fixed it up, no problem.</br>  <br>I find it very good and refreshing. I don't know much about art, but I like the way he draws his panels a lot. I can't compare it to the art of Berserk or the artstyle of Blame!, but to me its one of the best out there right now.<br><br>I think the tall aspect has to do with how they represent the character in stills and motion, how they move around etc. <br>  Bakugou for example is 172cm tall, he's about the same size of Luffy, taller than Naruto, but still looks rather childish. <br><br>The childish part is about how the author draws them. They are still first year high school students afterall. I haven't read OP and Naruto, but from some pics I saw around I don't see much of a difference, but that's up to you because you read them</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Much appreciated, God bless you.</br></br>  <br> but still looks rather childish. <br><br>He's a teenager, what did you expect? Chad from Bleach? a teenager so buff and tall that looks more like a mid 20's Mexican pistolero.</br></br></br>  <br> A issue that I have with it is how the characters doesn't seems to properly represent their stature. <br>Reminder that Shouji is only 6'1</br></br>  <br>Shigaraki looks terrible here, holy shit.</br>  <br>Thank you! I enjoy doing these things, so it's really no problem.</br>  <br>I love the art and the way his different styles clash, it's like mixing a horror and child's manga together.<br><br>And the issue with heights is in quite a few manga.</br></br></br>  What if Shigaraki was an All Might fanboy before? Or as a kid he accidentally gave All Might that injury and All Might did something to him, which would be the reason for his hate towards him.  It seems that the Jump NEXT! #3 have a BnHA special chapter.<br>Is this related to the beach page?</br>  <br>So what city is that in real Japan?</br>   &gt; 127890569 <br>Geez, I wonder, why you think so?</br>  is there a "do it for her" version of Mt.lady?  <br>That beach page was the chapter, it was like midnight's interview thing and Mt Lady's company chapters.</br>  Does anyone actually have an example of a mangaka lowering his art quality as his manga goes on?  <br>Hunter x Hunter</br>  <br>inb4: Togashi?</br>  <br><br>Here's the template if you want to try doing it</br></br>  <br>on it.</br>  <br>Rurouni Kenshin by Nobuhiro Watsuki</br>  <br>I did it for her, anon.</br>  <br><br>That colored one is grinding my gears, swap it for another black and white, please.</br></br>  <br> tfw I can not into photoshop <br>fucking layers man</br></br>  POST OP/ED WHISHLIST<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XrS<wbr>r8CU51GM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I need to make one of these for Mei.</br>  <br> tfw Tiger &amp; Bunny is over </br>  <br>You're right, I felt that way too.</br>  <br><br>Much better now</br></br>  Come home<br>See this<br>What do?</br></br>  <br> Loli succubus needs a goof fucking. <br> a goof fucking. </br></br>  <br>Take banana, eat it.

It's impossible to filter out furshit since they never use consistent tags.</br></br>  <br>Complete with shit typesetting!</br>  Western shit sucks ass because they upload 1-2 pages a fucking year and then just quit. They can't seem to, you know, make a full fucking doujin like nips do every year.<br><br>God western porn fucking SUCKS</br></br>  <br>The doujinshi paradigm exists because it's commercially viable. The western market (besides furry) isn't.</br>  <br>Just check Doujin, Manga, Artist and Game CG and you're set.</br>  <br>Many artists draw doujinshi for fun, not for profit.</br>    <br><br>Western porn just absolutely sucks<br><br>Drawn western porn is basically non-existent horribly, horribly awful on the levels of sonic the hedgehog porn because the porn "market" in the west is mostly limited to 3DPD porn in the shittiest porn video hosts you can think of.<br><br>Japan somehow mastered the art of making actually good drawn porn and most do it for fun or as a hobby while some people can make some money off it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet the average doujinshi as a whole is leagues better than the average american cartoon porn</br>  <br><br>porn games too, the west has none except some unfinished patreon garbage, while japan has a whole industry for it</br></br>  <br> avg <br><br>That's because their is more doujin made than western. Have you been to comiket, there is a lot of shit that doesn't get uploaded.</br></br></br>  <br>True but profit aside just making some money to recoup the time/money invested is also better.</br>  Is there a way to search whilst ignoring certain tags? Like say I want to look for Loli, but don't want any rape or dilf's is there a way to find only doujins/manga without those tags but retaining the loli tag?  <br>And its literally garbage.<br><br>Porn games in the west are usually unfinished trash with god awful art that either consist of someone doing it for "fun" or someone trying to suck money out of people with a patreon/kickstarter or a blog and a "PLEASE DONATE" button or a product that will never be finished or forever stuck in the development phase.<br><br>Its the same for VNs, all the visual novels the west has made trying to imitate japan belong in the trash and are usually just parody shit because its the easiest thing to do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You put a - sign in front of the tag you don't want</br>  <br>Wow, I feel stupid.</br>  <br> don't want any rape or dilf <br>But then how do I self insert.</br></br>   I liked the one about the dude sexually corrupting his femnazi little sister. Japan ain't gonna write a story like that.    cartoons <br> has 5x to 10x the budget of an average anime <br> -all- animation outsourced to koreans or canadian flash farms <br> no interesting or special animation cuts <br> no hand painted backgrounds <br> no class act soundtracks <br> no real plot, lasting character development, directing, or choreography <br><br>Get it together, western developers<br><br><br>Are you new to the internet<br><br><br>Doujins are for self inserting as the girl, stupid<br><br><br>Because feminazis don't exist in japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are many fetishes out there anon. Panda just tries to cater to as many as possible.</br>  <br>The Spongebob Squarepants movie was pretty good</br>  some shit they have on there is legit pretty rare like the benson books, I tried buying those shit on ebay since there are no more online rips and the price is crazy   mfw I find a Korean    not fapping to both east and west   <br>Gravity Falls is alright.</br>  <br> Shit tier west gets a free ride and spammed <br> artists like akabur or John persons gets expunged <br>fuck western shit</br></br></br>   go on pixiv <br> see hundreds of artists put out dozens of short hentai manga and sequences <br> western pornfag puts something out <br> DONATE PLS DONATE DONATE PATREON DONATE DONATE <br> takes 3 years to finish one sequence <br><br>The west should just abandon colouring, it's holding them back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was Steven Universe purposely left out?<br><br><br>When does it start back? The 14th? <br>I thought it always aired on a Monday though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not bad and at least Disney does do some of their own animation for some of the more important sequences, but they're nothing special. <br><br>I just think it's funny that they always have WAY more budget but don't actually look it, even if they have more frames. Evangelion was made for 60,000 an episode, while a handdrawn cartoon of the same length would cost 1 million.<br><br><br><br>Expect endless repeated hiatuses every 2 episodes and everybody is left confused and wonders if it's cancelled or not, another irritating thing about western cartoons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The west should just abandon colouring, it's holding them back. <br>I sort of agree but colouring doesn't seem to hold the koreans back that much tbh</br></br>  I know this isn't a proper sadpanda thread, but since it's related I'm posting it here anyway as I don't know when I'll be around for an actual thread.<br><br>[Hamao] Let's Do Something Nice!

Evangelion was made for 60,000 an episode, while a handdrawn cartoon of the same length would cost 1 million.<br>Living wage yo. It's nice when animators don't gotta live at the office and subside exclusively on packaged ramen.</br></br></br>  <br> eroe's delinquent genderbending doujin/sequence on pixiv that he did for free was better drawn, more developed, longer, and sexier than anything the west has ever put out for the fetish in 20 years <br><br>Fuck you ugly 3D poser shit that I apparently need to pay for</br></br></br>  <br><br>The west has no animators to pay in the first place. And having way more resources to work with and support artists with sounds like a bad excuse for having worse quality in certain areas. <br><br>And think about this, if anime paid their animators way better and had 1 million dollar budgets for every episode, do you think anime would start to look like and be written like western cartoons? Even really cheap gag anime shorts have basic television (not theater) directing, better storyboarding, and even some interesting animation cuts too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Am I an idiot for not knowing why this isn't on Sadpanda?</br>  <br>Why are you correlating increased budget with western style cartoon aesthetics and writing? That's got everything to do with culture and very little to do with money.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>This better be some good shit for added trouble I'm going through to get to it.</br>  <br>It's the same as all the other gift chapters. The only good one has been Love and Juice Beat, since it wasn't just pure vanilla crap.<br>And I would've had more links but the multiuploader shit itself so you just have to settle. Maybe someone will upload it to nyaa promptly for once.</br></br>  <br><br>So paying animators less/more as  said shouldn't be the only reason why a cheap anime is done better in many ways compared to a way more expensive cartoon, which usually also have way more time to work on the episodes too<br><br>I hear that "We pay our animators more" line all the time, but it doesn't answer for everything, just like with this porn stuff</br></br></br></br>  <br>if Greek drawn porn from BC can be considerd art then by Moot, so can japanese drawn porn  and non H </br>  It's depressing how much the west sucks at animation/comics/hentai, etc.  Western is shit, but most doujin artists are lazy band-wagoners. <br><br> I didn't watch a second of this series but it's popular so here's rape doujin #582 <br>It's even worse when they're actually decent at drawing.</br></br></br>  <br>Sucks to not have a rape fetish I guess.</br>  I'm curious why Japan has such a large pool of artists, professional and amateur. Artists even move from America to Japan to become professionals. How did this happen?  <br>Escapist, childish culture. Being a mangaka or illustrator is for Japan what basketball or hip hop is for niggers.</br>  <br>What would you propose as the ideal culture then, oh mighty and wise one?</br>   tag on western for a second <br> NIGGER DICK <br> NIGGER DICK <br> NIGGER DICK <br> SIMPSONS <br> NIGGER DICK <br> FURRY <br> SIMPSONS CUCKOLD WITH NIGGER DICKS <br>seriously?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>people like cowboys</br>  <br> mangas <br>You heard it from a manga artist.</br></br>    <br> actually really like the thick-lined, cartoony style of western animation <br> western tag is all garbage <br>suffering</br></br></br>  <br>The furry component is a lot higher than that on panda.</br>   father/daughter incest doujin <br> so few compares to other pairing  <br> most of them are abuse, rape or has a "twist" dark ending <br>Just why?</br></br></br>  <br>Double standards, my friend.</br>  <br><br>ironically the ex-Disney artist has some of the better western porn out there<br>shame he's not trying anymore</br></br></br>  <br> space before question mark <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>I thought the distance thing was good, but then I'm just a fan of his art.

The hype has died down, mostly everyone has watched it and said what they had to say.<br><br><br>Why would you ever assume anyone, especially him, is serious about anything?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure there was a point to that stupid question but I don't see it.</br>  <br> This is an ongoing anime with plenty to discuss <br><br>The most of those threads sticks about shovel and her condition, so it's more like a thread for the next chapters than episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm curious what's going on, but episode 1 wasn't too good for me. You gotta make the episode interesting even with and without the twist, otherwise folks won't stick around to the twist.</br>  <br> KEI <br><br>Who's that again?</br></br></br>  Is it the 18th of this month or next that we get chapters translated?  <br>Next</br>  <br>And we have a month till the next few chapters at the very least. The manga is more interesting than the current first episode anyhow. <br>As  said the hype is dying down so this'll probably be the last thread.</br></br>  <br>It's at times like this that I wish raw websites were reliable.<br>If only we had Japanese raws, I'm sure many people here could and would translate them.</br></br>  <br><br>Miki's friend that left. Miki left a note for her when they left the school.</br></br>  <br>Mii-kun's friend.</br>  <br>I always thought it was that they didn't perceive each other as food. And that they didn't have enough awareness to think of each other as competitors.</br>  <br>it would cause a shitstorrm and every anon would talk about it.<br><br>Generals are inevitable for really popular shows. I was just giving an example. People would try to speculah it like they did with Madoka. Good times...<br><br>So what? Maybe you are a newfag and how much fun /a/ had just by speculah-ing it?<br>Summer is here.<br><br> &gt;Why would you ever assume anyone, especially him, is serious about anything? <br>Who are you to assume what I'm supposed to be serious about or what? Fuck off retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>     9:41 into episode, can't get over how cute the characters act and everything is so adorable, then I see stuff here about plane crashes a piolets. <br> wtf happens to this peaceful little show?? I'm now very intrigued.<br> continues watching now </br></br>  <br> and how much fun /a/ had just by speculah-ing it? <br>and don't know how much fun /a/ had just by speculah-ing it? *</br></br>  <br> &gt;Why would you ever assume anyone, especially him, is serious about anything? <br>I was serious about your'e mom but she cheated on me ;_;</br></br>  <br>Soon anon.. Soon.<br>Be sure to pick up the manga</br></br>  <br>Finish the episode rather than telling us your random thoughts.</br>  <br>Not really.<br><br>Evangelion somehow never gets generals just constant threads really often. <br>Monogatari also gets random occasional threads, in between seasons when nothing is airing and there isn't an announcement but not a general. <br>These are some of the most popular anime on /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>   gomin instead of gomen <br> roja~r instead of yokai <br>How much more moe can this get?</br></br>  <br> yokai </br>  <br>Monogatari novels are untranslated.<br>Eva gets new movie bundled with Kizumonogatari and Half Life 3<br>Gakkou Gurashi will get frequents update with the ongoing manga, so that's different.</br></br></br>  I hope this gets at least one figma, either for Yuki or Shovel.  <br>Anon I was here during Madoka times and we had constant generals.<br>Actually what I mean is that we were talking about it pretty much 7/24.<br>Eva is old as fuck and Monogatari is not anime original as well.<br>The point is that if there is enough material for people to speculate about then they will.<br>And I feel like if this was an anime original then people would talk about it and try to find clues and the like.<br>Madoka, Sora no woto, yuyuyu etc. got some good discussion about them because they were original.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The hype is dying down so this'll probably be the last thread. <br><br>Until the next episode will be aired, then we get another +25 threads about a bitten girl. I just don't see "plenty to discuss", instead of the same procedure ever and ever.</br></br></br>  <br><br> YuYuYu  <br> Good discussion <br><br>I was there. Most of the discussion was shitposting between Sufferingfags and Healingfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same. Nowadays, all I see is mostly lesbianism.</br>  <br> i was here during madoka times </br>  <br>Don't underestimate the hype now.<br>We were having some good fun when /a/ was still good and some anons managed to crack the Madoka runes.<br><br>nice butthurt there m8. why don't you go back to reddit? or check your PMs on MAL?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Evangelion somehow never gets generals <br>3.0 got literally over 1000 generals</br></br>  <br>And generals are horrible cancer.<br>I'm just saying that when madoka aired it was a different time and we probably won't get 'generals'</br></br>  <br>Healingfag here, can confirm that's what YuYuYu threads consisted of.<br><br><br>3.0 general were the darkest moment in Eva's history on 4chan.</br></br></br></br>  What the fuck is wrong with her?  <br>That only happens when an idiot who has recently watched it without reading the extra material starts sperging about muh asspull ending.</br>  <br>And every single last one was an abomination.</br>  <br><br>You must've somehow missed all the speculation going on every week and even (specially) after it ended, not to mention how every new material gets immediately TL'd creating more discussion. Did a mahou shoujo eat your teacher and gave you PTSD?<br><br>But yeah, unfortunately it's only circlejerking yurifags now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just watch the episode until the end and you'll understand.</br>  <br>I did see those, and a flood of speculah certainly flooded when the Sange mechanic was revealed.</br>  <br>The only good dog is a dead dog.  Sorry if you love dogs, I can't help it because I was attacked by a German Shepherd when I was little. Now I classify dogs into two groups: one kick kill, and others. </br>  <br><br>It was certainly present, but most of the discussion that spawned from the translations was healingfags in increasingly desperate denials, and sufferingfags shitposting. We would generally have an immediate thread where speculah and shitposting were equal, and then the shitposting went into overdrive in the next couple until the next episode.<br><br>That said, once the disabilities were revealed to be permenant, it calmed down a bit. Though evey 4 posts was still either "&gt;healingfags btfo" or "I want to touch Togo's Togos."</br></br></br></br>  <br>We'd still get constant threads that want to talk about it though.<br>I was just giving generals as an example, pls stop.<br><br><br>Okay guys I understand. We probably won't get good discussion from this new-/a/ even if we were to given another anime of madoka level.<br>Okay.<br> inb4 madoka was shit as well <br>It wasn't the best shit ever yeah but still let me had great deal of fun in 2011.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> new-/a/ <br>/a/ is pretty much the same as it was when madoka aired just with less generals, less spam and less tripfags.</br></br>  <br>Anon, if you have to read the novels to explain the ending, it's not a very good ending.</br>  <br> just with less generals, less spam and less tripfags. <br>you make it look like it's better now when it's clearly not.<br>/a/ (and 4chan itself) has gained speed in rotting these last years and even its founder, moot, decided to drop it.</br></br></br>  I'll need to marathon the rest of the chapters before going into these threads.  <br>/a/ is clearly better than it was around the time madoka was airing.</br>  Just caught up to the manga...

Like, it's hard to kill off a main character in all the art and shit with the anime adaption just starting. But maybe I'm just grasping at straws. </br></br>  <br><br> I don't think she will. She will remain a carrier of the virus though. I don't think that the sob story's going to come from her. </br></br>  <br> I want to touch Togo's Togos <br>We still want to</br></br>  <br> she's carrying a gun just to be ready for it </br>  <br> quitted  <br> fkin <br> neo <br>Did you come straight from Gaia?<br><br> because he was the scapegoat of self-called oldfags <br>Don't just make things up.

I can't remember everything anymore. guess I'll read the manga a again.<br><br>though the story would benefit from it, I think</br></br></br></br>  Am I the only one who finds the character design stupid?<br><br>Not the characters itself, but the clothes. They have too much detail to pass of as school uniforms and it looks like mangaka tried to make them unique but just put too much stuff. Like, how many different fucking hats and gloves and other accessories can one character have without looking retarded?</br></br>  <br>Shovel dies July 9th next year, not a coincidence.</br>  <br>It's appropriate for Yuki to look retarded.</br>  Anyone know where I can find the raws for the manga? I'm having some difficulty finding them.  <br>Only chink and gook, which poison do you prefer?</br>  Just woke up. Did that one anon ever translate 36?   Two cute girls playing on the blood stain floor. <br>T-that's cute.</br>  Do we know what exactly it was that messed up Yuki yet?  <br>Megu-nee helped her regress.</br>  <br>there was no point of defending a site that went to utter shit so he just dropped it.<br><br>4chan literally had its peak between 2008-2011.<br>you are just a nostalgia-hater faggot.<br>Thanks to the f/a/ggot guys like you that moot dropped this place.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zombies aren't cannibals</br>  <br>Every living being first concern is to perpetuate its species.

I got bored halfway through then decided to jump a good part. I totally didn't expect the ending tho. The PTSD is strong with this one.  <br>I resized it my self, idiot.

I think there's a turning stage in which you're still alive and with some degree of control over yourself but already being taking over by zombie urges, before you finally die, become mindless and begin to rot.<br> It's probably the stage Kurumi was in when they gave her the serum. </br></br>  I want more fanart!  <br>I'd lead them to victory with muh military training, devising strategies of survival and defeating all the zombies as well as the evil umbrella corporation who is behind this outbreak.<br><br>Then, these girls will reward me with sex, since I'm a white knight and already has a whole wall of tallies full with ladies who have rewarded me with sex for saving them on the internet.<br><br> actually, I'd just try to keep low and wait for halp </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.<br><br> If she had gotten to the basement, she would've been able to cure herself and wouldn't doom Kurumi. </br></br></br>  <br><br> this anime <br> not edgy shit <br><br>please</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you'd have to be a complete retard to think that was just boring moeshit</br>  <br>She wasn't full transformed at that time.</br>  <br>I quit going on /a/ regularly for a few months because of my obsession with one of the other boards and honestly /a/ seems to be in better shape than I left it.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I think the medicine just postponed the "transformation" right?</br>  <br>Kill the girls, fuck the zombies.</br>  <br><br>It's just a bit cold this time of the year, nothing to worry about.</br></br>  <br>Kobayashi, plz</br>    What was the endcard?  <br> zombie outbreak <br> girl has a strong PTSD <br> "WATCH OUT PEOPLE IT'S EDGY" <br><br>I didn't even like the episode that much but you really need to stop using this buzzword, faggot</br></br></br></br></br>  WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU  <br><br>WATCH OUT PEOPLE IT'S DRAMA DEEPSHIT WITH SO UNIQUE ZOMBIES AND TRAUMATIZED LITTLE GIRLS<br><br>better??</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's handled well and makes a lot of sense in the context of the situations they're put in. I don't see the problem with that.<br><br>People seem to forget that "edgy" isn't a universally bad thing and that it depends entirely on execution.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything in the movie industry already got used to oblivion.<br>Give us an unused alternative to zombies.</br></br>  <br>At this point edgy is used for everything that's mildly depressing or if changes too fast of tone.</br>  <br>There are many 80's and 90's OVAs that are a lot more violent, gory and depressing but you don't hear anyone complaining about those being edgy because they're "classics".</br>  <br>Or your average shitposter haven't watched them.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? "edgy" is badly connoted no matter in what context you say it. It's a fucking meme to say that you use to shittalk anything that gets a little too "dark" for your virgin brain to handle, or to berate anormalous destructive behaviour for someone.<br><br>/a/ and 4chan is using that word left and right and they would even use it to shittalk about freaking horror movies, because they are too virgin to handle it.<br><br>tl;dr: this word needs to die, buried and forgotten.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Feels like a rock off of the shoulders.</br>  <br>Not just here, in Japan is pretty used too, I remember an anime of last year that mentioned how people would call a show being "Edgy" just for a minimal change of tone.</br>  Whether or not the show turns out to be edgy shit, this first episode basically had nothing going for it other than the SHOCKING TWIST at the end<br><br>Twenty minutes of a generic moe slice-of-life followed by "haha fooled you you thought you were watching one show but you were actually watching a completely different show" doesn't actually tell me anything about the show I'm supposed to be watching</br></br>  <br><br> shits on "edgy" for being a buzzword <br><br> uses virgin like it means fucking anything </br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga<br> Kurumi turns into a zombie </br></br>  <br>She is the transfer student.</br>   New anime first episode released <br> Some people like it, others don't. <br> It's popular, so threads gets renewed, and people talk about not making it a general cause generals sucks <br> 40 posts about the anime/manga <br> 200 meta posts discussing shitposting <br>sasuga /a/</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop being a filthy secondary.</br>  <br>Yeah, Sabagebu.</br>  <br>It gets you to watch the second episode. If the second episode is good enough, you'll watch the third, then fourth, and so on. It's how the manga got people hooked, and if the anime is any bit as good as the manga, then it'll succeed.</br>  A large group of only school girls in a zombie apocalypse is just begging to get raped. Seriously, where's the muscle?  oh man shitpost is inevitable <br>this is why i don't want this series to be popular, especially in /a/</br>  <br>They were hints all over the place that things were wrong, next time try to pay attention to what you watch please.</br>  <br>They don't need muscle they have shovel.</br>  <br> Taroumaru <br>I've got bad news for you, anon</br></br>  <br>It's going to remain the same, just with less Yuki-vision.</br>  <br>Virgin meant here "innocent", unless you're too retarded to make a simple connection. "Edgy" has lost most of its "meaning", it would be much more meaningful if you were to say that it was "badly executed" and people might actually take your critic seriously instead of greentexting your comment into oblivion.<br> happens to be a valid and understandable critic without buzzword.</br></br>  <br>They were hints anon, you should have seen it, but yeah, it was pretty similar to the first chapter of the manga in that sense, and that's a good thing.</br>  <br><br>got ourselves a best-taste intellectual patrician right here folks<br><br>didn't you just love the mature themes of psycho pass that feel ripped from the headlines<br><br>why isn't all anime so smart and groundbreaking</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh fuck off</br>  <br><br>Not above anon but yeah, the "friend repeatedly entering classrooms with ongoing lessons" really ticked me off at first and I began to think something was wrong. Too bad the episode got too boring and I decided to skip a good part of it, I would have gotten the full effect if I hadn't.</br></br>  <br> discussion is about whether a word is a meme or not <br> tries to shittalk me about my tastes and maturity <br><br>I feel like I missed a part of the discussion somehow but, hey, it's ok anon, I'm gonna help you out with your PTSD too &lt;3</br></br></br></br>  Eighteen year old.  <br>That sucks, you miss a lot of subtle hints if you do. Like a grave on the rooftop in a zoomed-out shot.</br>  <br>They were subtle things really, like glasses broken or the faces the girls did when Yuki said something.</br>  <br>That's not cute at all. Yuki's a frank, lewd, stinky adult girl now.</br>  <br>I do have to agree with you. If the author just didn't try to get creative, then the SoL moments along with the twist would have perfectly fitted in the first half of the episode. I'm starting to doubt if leaving him in charge of the SC was a good idea.</br>  <br>that one wasn't that hard though</br>  <br><br>*ryoukai <br>I'm retarded, this is not monogatari. Sorry</br></br></br>  <br>Cuddle them all</br>  <br>Fuck, I completely missed that shot. And here I thought I had seen everything.</br>   Shovel is going to die and there is nothing you can do to save her     <br>I thought they were just good Christians.</br>  Is anyone else going to rewatch the first episode just to spot all the clues?  <br>Rii is sexy as fuck and her constant mental breakdowns only make my dick harder.</br>    <br>Already did</br>  <br>She'll be fine !</br>  <br>Yeah, I kinda understood of how it was supposed to roll from there on.<br><br><br>Please, no.  ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but the whining about asspulls when she doesn't will probably make us wish she had.</br>  <br> ON the third episode they show that Megu-nee and the dog were dead all along </br>  <br>What a lewd body.</br>  <br>The dog isn't dead yet in the anime. He interacted with the other characters.</br>  <br><br>A lot of the hints were only really that obvious in retrospect though. The only thing that seemed really weird out of context was the writing on the blackboard, everything else could just be written off as "weird anime quirks"<br><br>I already knew there was something wrong even though I didn't know the exact nature of the twist, so it's not like I was expecting nothing but cute SoL shenanigans. Just saying that any judgement of the show's quality based off of the first episode is basically impossible when the episode entirely revolved around the twist at the end</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't give her a sister but can give her a daughter indeed.</br>  <br>YES FINALLY I CAN BE USEFUL</br>  <br>The wall of schooldesk should've been a pretty big hint.</br>  <br>That's why the 3-episode rule exists. Most shows can't be accurately judged on a single episode, and this show even more so.</br>  <br>When does it die? I just remember seeing the dog in like 2 panels and then they mention it was their dog.</br>  <br>Only when Yuki was there.</br>  <br>Godspeed Kim.</br>  <br> Can't give her a sister <br>Yuki sorta did.</br></br>    <br>It died when Megu-nee was still alive.</br>  <br>Get to work gook-san</br>  <br>Megu-nee killed it cause it was a zombie</br>  <br>Thing is, nobody interacts with Megu-nee besides Yuki, but the other characters reacted when it jumped onto the desk, or when it ran behind shovel she reacted faster than Yuki.</br>  Lerche really id well with the whole bait and switch thing, especially the opening. That reveal at the end was masterfully done.<br>Also, they changed the key visual after the first episode aired. Genius.</br>  <br>Actually it's because the retarded summerfags who keep saying "edgy" have never watched anime older than 2005 at the most (that may be an overly generous estimate)</br>  Someone who has HS post a screencap of the other text, the water mark is on top of them  <br>Everything about this post is shameful.</br>    <br><br>The animation of that little skip she does when exiting the classroom right after this looks awkward.</br></br>  <br>Actually, aren't those zombies down there?<br><br><br><br>Wow thanks</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are just feeling nostalgia or something.<br>Nowadays we constantly have fate, yahari threads, even though there is not really something to talk about and most anons here only to shitpost.<br>Go check the catalog and you will see.</br></br></br>  <br>They sure are.</br>  <br>Now I regret helping you, if you're this much of an idiot.</br>  <br>No, I was just pointing out that he found the cross but not the zombies</br>  <br>I'm very sure it isnt nostalgia.</br>  <br>Well, I already read the manga so I paid attention to things that weren't as obvious to me. Can't believe I missed the cross in the other cut though.</br>  Would you?  <br>No, she died for her own sins.</br>  <br>Well I'm not going to argue about what you might be feeling right now nor I have any good reason to get you convinced that /a/ is worse now.<br>If you think /a/ is better right now then it is okay, I'm happy for you.</br></br>  Kurumi is a cutie.<br><br>Rii is hot.<br><br>The other two are... there.</br></br></br></br>  thread theme<br><br>https://ifyoureanangelyouwillsuffoc<wbr>ateonearth.bandcamp.com/track/im-yo<wbr>ur-ghost</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>You forgot someone!</br>  Currently reading chapter 1.

Disappointed because I prepared for hilarity and all I got was sadness towards cute girls who just couldn't make to a show where they could have lived peacefully. I may actually grow to appreciate SoL from now on.</br>  <br> Like I save them many times and there is a scene where I'm training my body and Rii comes inside  mirins  my body and thanks me for everything. Then I say to her that there is no need to thank me and I will save them no matter what, also she can depend on me as much as she wants.<br>Then she will blush and say a meek yes.<br>As for Kurumi, I will save her when she was in pinch and will be there when she has a breakdown</br></br> <br><br>A male contender for me to self-insert into when?</br></br></br>  <br> Mahou Shoujo of the End <br>Err sorry what are you referring to here?</br></br>  <br> Yuki <br> the load <br>She's the Atlas.</br></br></br>  <br>You tell me, mate.</br>  <br>Oh god Mahou Shoujo of the End was hilariously bad.</br>    <br>A manga which doesn't feel it got love from its own author, and only is a cashgrab to ride on the waves of grimderp magical girls that Madoka has stirred.</br>  <br>Too scared. Yuki's a hero.</br>  <br><br>Yuki Takeya is a Hero!</br></br>      <br>I need Miki.</br>  So, do you guys think the manga is going to get to the point in which we will not be able to differentiate between what's real and what is not?   &gt;If we don't hurry up, Megu-nee will-<br> Huh? If we don't hurry up... and what? </br> <br><br>Oh damn, this was actually pretty well done.</br></br>  <br>I hope so. Speculation is one of the best things a series can have.</br>  <br>Protip: the three sluts aren't real.</br>  <br>The zombies aren't real and Yuki is the only sane one</br>  God damnit I wanted to self-insert as the pilot.  <br>this is what I want, even though it would destroy my mental health as well</br>  <br>Self-insert as the shovel.</br>  <br>Watch Perfect Blue.</br>  <br>Everything is daijobu.</br>  <br>that's a good idea, she basically sleeps with that thing</br>  <br>Would you be happy if the anime ( written by the mangaka) took an original take on the existing chapters of the manga and did a Perfect Blue with the anime?</br>  <br>she probably masturbates with it</br>  You wouldn't date a zombie.  I don't think Yuki's delusions are completely gone. They're probably starting to fall apart, though.  You best get used to seeing tears here.  Ruri will defeat Jack  <br>Yusei will give Yuya Junk Kuriboh or Waifu Magician</br>  do you think Dennis will get a Shun rematch in the tournament? <br><br>do you think when Dennis finally reveals himself he'll do it with a surprise fusion summon, or will it be some average reveal?</br></br>  <br>IZZAT YUZU (RIN)'S RIDING DUEL UNIFORM?</br>   And then, appearing before Yuya, is a teenage boy with a card in his hand. <br>Who is this mysterious boy?</br>  <br>Sora.

Shinji in disguise to not catch the council's attention since he's throwing his future away during his match? A totally new character unspoiled by the OP like the council?</br>  <br><br>I don't think pedophile rapists are great villains</br></br>  <br> causing damage <br><br>holy shit the ptsd is real, he hasn't done anything yet and you don't know if he'll beat Gon</br></br></br>  <br>There are only dimensional counterparts for Yuya's and Ruri's though.</br>  <br>Why would they talk about a literally 5-10 second cameo</br>  <br>its gonna be when shit hits the fan, shun will see Dennis talking to a group of fusion users &amp; Yuri (who's hidden under a hood) but will be too far to hear what they're talking about, afew episode later due to whats going on Shun will then confront Dennis about t\what he seen and...then shit gets real.</br>  <br><br> yfw it's just one of Shinji's and Crow's buddies </br></br>  <br> Gon beats him <br> They shill SHS instead of Blackwings  <br><br><br>Because cameos don't sell cards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would it be Yuri, may I ask?</br>  <br><br>I enjoy Crow for all the salt he causes.<br>Hope he wins every single duel he stars in</br></br></br>  <br> implying it was ever stated that he raped her <br> implying he was a pedophile <br><br>Divine isn't the best YGO villain but he's not the worst <br><br> none of them are the worst </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he was teleported too.</br>  <br>It's already proven that he can travel in between dimensions at will.</br>  <br> wanting more supermemey memurais from the biggest meme character arc-v has to offer  <br><br>i hope crow wrecks him</br></br></br>  <br>Watching and waiting for him to bite the dust is also the reason I keep at it.</br>  <br>I never got why Astral didn't numeron code Tron back to normal. Does he look forward to outliving his own kids?</br>  <br>In my opinion, the character that would make the most sense is an AU Yusei with his face covered so it will leave a sense of ambiguity. They won't talk about it because <br><br>1. It's a small appearance for a minute at most and he most likely wont appear again<br><br>and<br><br>2. It would ruin the surprise<br><br>Yusei was the only one who could satisfy Jack and he can help Yuya by giving him a card that is guaranteed to satisfy him and re-ignite him from whatever emo phase he's in<br><br>No I don't think it's Yuri because that would otherwise make no sense</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can I use Chimeritech Fortress Dragon against Infinity?  <br>Memes destroy all<br>Crow is a dead man walking</br></br>  <br>If it's not Yusei it's some random new Synchro character</br>  <br>we'll see come august pal</br>  <br> implying he was a pedophile <br>She was like, 16/17. No court would have convicted him</br></br>  <br>If they had a thing for maintaining surprises there wouldn't be any weekly leaks.<br>In fact I think this show, nay most shows, would be much better if we never knew what was coming.</br></br>  <br> It's Seto <br> He just shows up with a Blue Eyes, rips it in half, and walks away </br></br>  <br> weekly leaks <br>It's called episode summaries. You know, for the TV guides on your television?</br></br>  <br>It's October where I live</br>  <br> &gt;from the biggest meme character arc-v has to offer <br>That's Shun. Unless you mean literally biggest. Besides I'll take SHS over more Blackwings any day.</br></br>  <br>   none of them are the worst <br>How about this?</br></br>  <br>But that'd make this universes Yusei look like a lazy cock who cant be bothered to do anything else. And it'd make no sense in the context of Arc V itself, all the other returning elements have been introduced in a way that you dont have to know anything about 5Ds. This'd be some random nobody showing up and giving Yuya a card that solves everything, as opposed to Yuya giving him his smile back with his own strength</br>  <br>How is Shun a meme character? I can understand Gon somewhat because he's a bit of an exaggerated inside joke but even still<br>/tv/ pls go</br></br>  <br>By now they'll have realised that everyone has already bought Blackwings and there's no need to sell anymore.<br><br><br>Ora kid was based</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope it's a deck-specific pendulum tuner for no fucking reason at all.</br>  <br> Besides I'll take SHS over more Blackwings any day <br>Most of the SHSs Gon has shilled in show have been fucking garbage for the last good few duels (the last decent one was the monster stealing tuner). At least Raikiri is pretty cool</br></br>  <br> But that'd make this universes Yusei look like a lazy cock who cant be bothered to do anything else. <br>You could say the same about Yugi who did the exact same thing to Judai and left Judai to be the one to handle all the shit going down at Duel Academy even though he was secretly there the whole time</br></br>  <br>I've asked myself the same thing.</br>  <br> Ora kid was based <br> actually liking one of the worst characters in YGO history </br></br>  <br> le no spells or traps such skill <br> le steadfast dueling <br> le manly bro </br></br></br>  What went wrong?  <br>And Shun's even worse.</br>  <br>He wasnt there. He was off in his own corner of the world doing his own thing, he probably didnt even know about most of the shit that went down. Not like Yusei sitting back and doing nothing as his former friend falls into despair and his city gets fucked up</br>  <br>Except GX was a direct spinoff/sequel to DM, and really did happen in the same universe. Onwards have been entirely different series.<br>Furthermore everybody knew who Yugi was at the time. The cameo made sense.</br></br>  <br> He wasnt there. He was off in his own corner of the world doing his own thing, he probably didnt even know about most of the shit that went down <br>Different anon, did you even watch the last two episodes of GX?</br></br>  <br>Shit taste. I bet you think Shiberu isn't based too. And I am deadly serious.<br><br><br>Dumb frogposter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I meant main villains<br><br>I know Divine wasn't really a main villain but I still classify him as such compared to them since he's more serious than those three. I mean he actually had plans for world domination and affected the plot for reasons other than just being a shithead</br></br></br>  <br> genuinely compelling backstory and equally interesting character relationships <br>Not the guy you're responding to, but how is Shun a bad character in any way?  It sounds like you're one of those anons who's butthurt at his W/L record </br></br>  <br>1. Played card games like it was handegg<br>2. RANK MONSTERS ARE LEVEL 0!?</br></br>  <br>His parents didn't want to raise him</br>  <br>Um, yeah he did know what went down. The reason why he dueled Judai in the first place was because he was going to help Judai find his tanoshii after losing it during all the shit that happened.</br>  <br>Shun has more depth as a character than any other in any series prior.<br>It's even better that they're putting that depth to use.</br></br>  <br>I was just shitposting out of annoyance at Crow overreactions <br><br>I don't really mind either of them</br></br></br>  <br>The new Tuner he used against Dennis and even the LV4 he used in the Secruity duel are decent but Gon needs more Synchros and high level Tuners.<br>Also Raikiri is meh. Doesn't count itself for its effect.</br></br>  <br>I don't know about any series but definitely more than any other Arc-V character<br><br>He's definitely developing slowly which makes it feel a lot more realistic</br></br></br>  <br>Goddamnit man, you're not supposed to admit it! Never drop your shitposting facade, /s4s/ would be ashamed.</br>  Anybody wanna duel?<br><br>YGOPro US server<br><br>Name is Jutte Fighter<br><br>Password: BENNIS</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How do you compete with THIS, Yuya?  <br>With this</br>  <br>he's probably already banged Yuzu</br>  <br>Have you seen Yuuya in his jumpsuit? <br>He's slowly going from the cutest thing ever to the hottest</br></br>  <br> tfw ENER-D hasn't been mentioned yet </br>  <br> fought against Jack before him <br> the Yuzu he has wants to fuck Yuya and not him <br> will be nom nom by the end of the arc <br>He's so fucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She won't let him comment on her titties, what makes you think she'd let him enter the nether?</br>  <br><br><br> Shun has more depth as a character than any other in any series prior. <br>How? All of his depth has been out there since the first Sora Shun duel<br> Stoic violent guy who values his NAKAMA above all <br>Nothing wrong with it, but even with all his screentime they could be doing more</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting on the moment when you all are BTFO when Yugo isn't "nom nom"</br>  What are some good archfiend decks?  <br>Nope, Yuzu is too crude and strong to accept his advances.</br>  <br> Yuya <br> not inheriting CWSD <br> not creating a pendulum synchro </br></br></br>  <br>Yes, which is why I'm hoping with tongue hanging out they exploit the hell out of him. This is the first Yugioh character in a long time where I actively care about what happens to them. I want him to find the sister, I want him to save the city, I want him to make it out alive. Which only makes it more painful because I also know that none of those thongs will happen.</br>  <br>It's the biggest meme   for you  </br>  <br> All of his depth has been out there since the first Sora Shun duel <br>He's slowly developing into treating the people of Standard as true comrades. Regardless the true intrigue of Shun comes with the potential from his backstory. They've given us a genuine reason to care about his fate, more than pretty much any YGO character I can think of  except maybe Yuuya himself </br></br>  <br> thongs </br>  <br>I don't really care about him finding his sister that badly, but I think that's just because I need to rewatch earlier episodes of Arc-V <br><br>I'm looking forward to the progress he makes with his new comrades though</br></br></br>    <br>Not really. He tried to protect Serena even though he knew she was from the Fusion Dimension and he's been accepting the Lancers as his real comrades. This is obvious from how they all fought to protect him against the Obelisk Force, and how him and Gongenzaka are like the strongest Tag Team</br>  <br> Which only makes it more painful because I also know that none of those thongs will happen <br>Do you honestly think Arc V wont end with him reunited with Ruri and Yuto with all the residents of XYZ land uncarded? Have you ever seen a Yugioh series before?</br></br>  <br> they've given us a genuine reason to care about his fate <br><br>that being?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm the complete opposite. I want him to get beaten, humiliated and never see his sister again. It will be so delicious.<br>I think I'm becoming like Sora but whatever.</br></br>  What went wrong?  <br> Shit girl </br>  <br>Judai being gay and kinda already married to Yubel.</br>  <br> and kinda already married to Yubel <br>Reminder that Yubels and Judais entire duel was a reference the Jewish marriage ceremonies</br></br>  <br>She wasn't Judai's osananajimi, and in Yugioh that's already losing</br>  <br>Why is she cryin?</br>  <br>She slapped him when he was trying to get the job done<br><br>Instant turn off</br></br></br>  <br> muh yuya <br> my eyes aren't the only part of my body leaking </br></br>  <br>Thinkgen of Yuya.</br>  How do I into steadfast dueling?  <br>Because Yuya is alive and came to save her<br><br>I'd be throwing my panties too</br></br></br>  <br>Eyeliner much Yugo?</br>  <br>Run the SHS bosses, no magic/traps, and make sure to willingly give up your own screen time to other characters when possible.</br>  I haven't been this hyped in more than 20 episodes.

ARC-V FOR WOMEN - 1621<br><br>Since early June when I last checked, everyone has gained support except Yusho.<br>The rankings remain mostly the same except Selena jumped up 4 ranks (she was behind Yugo at the time). Also Dennis has leapfrogged Reira but still can't compete against Ayu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Holy shit Deskbots are fucking broken.  <br> Sawatari behind fucking Yuto now <br><br>literally wtf</br></br></br>  <br> 榊 洋子 - Sakaki Yoko - 16 <br>Im surprised a Rinko style MILF is so low</br></br>  Yuzu's biker suit will make climb higher if it's cute or lewd enough,  <br> one of the 3 best boys is higher than Sawatari <br>Whoa stop the presses</br></br>  <br> Yuto best anything <br>he's gone, he wasn't anything special when he was alive either</br></br>  <br>Despite not having screentime for weeks if not months by now, he still gained 80 images since last month when he was at 484.</br>  <br>Still ahead of Reiji</br>  <br>that's pretty surprising  tbh </br>  <br>Not really. The more silly situations that a character can be put in and the prettier they are the more likely they are to get fanart.</br>  <br>You take that back, Neo New</br>   No shirtless Yuuya yet <br> No hair down Shun <br>You can't let the Ruris, perfect as they may be, get all the love Ebina</br></br>  <br>make me</br>    <br>Dennis doesn't like the look in eye of Yuri there.</br>  <br>The type of people who watch YGO are not the types who like older women,anon.</br>  <br> bruno <br>recently finished 5Ds<br><br>that antimony/bruno duel was pretty intense, and the last scene was actually powerful</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri is literally rape: the character so I don't blame him</br>  <br>This mainly. Also most YGO fanart is done by fujoshi so pretty boys and young girls get it all. Milfs don't get much.</br>  <br>I stopped minding the fujoshi pandering for a while</br>  <br>A balanced diet is important</br>  <br>The type of people who watch YGO ARE older women. That's why there are popular fujoshit tags especially for each series.<br><br><br><br>Has the honor of having of the greatest Summoning Chants in the entire franchise:<br> Limiter Removal, Level Max! <br> Regulator Open, All Clear! <br> Infinite Power, Break Time and Space to Open Unknown World! <br> Go! <br> Delta Accel! <br> Come On! <br> Tech Genus Halberd Cannon! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that image <br>Oh my</br></br>  <br> mfw level MAX </br>  <br> Delta Accel! </br>  <br> The type of people who watch YGO ARE older women <br>Its cute to imagine some bored housewife watching Yugioh and chanting along at home</br></br>  <br>I highly doubt that's all she'd be doing</br>  <br> Still waiting on the moment when you all are BTFO when Yugo isn't "nom nom" <br>You my nigga, the best negro I've ever known.</br></br>  <br>Because she realized Yuya still alive,  while she already sullied by banana. </br>  <br> tfw i don't remember this scene at all <br> tfw terrible memory <br> tfw i feel like i have to rewatch everything all the time <br><br>someone here just card me already</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Her husband wonders why she seems so much randier lately and keeps getting him to wear his red scarf </br>  <br>YAMEROOOO</br>  <br> Its cute to imagine some bored housewife watching Yugioh and chanting along at home <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ow_<wbr>jqc-0eAY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  How do I avoid brickhanding?  <br>How did you not remember REVOLUTION AIR RAIDO and "OH YES!"</br>  <br>How could I support carding someone  so cute </br>  <br>was there an oh yes when sawatari showed up there?</br>  <br> Implying the boy won't give Yuya a TUNA MONSTAH so that Yuya can summon Odd-Eyes' synchro upgrade </br>  Will we get a moment like this again when Yuya duels Jack?  <br>If you aren't plaing Advanced, put this guy in.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for the scene where Berserker Yuya unleashes OERD, resulting in the destruction of the entire track as its chin homes-in on Jack.</br>  <br>It was so cute when Yuya and Yuzu were trying to work together, but then they split up and stuff happened.</br>  <br>What episode was this? The pic is breaking my heart.</br>  <br> Tfw Yuya is trapped in Syncro dimension with no pajama </br>  <br>It's Yuya's edge mode coming out when the Knight of duels got carded.</br>  <br>Reminder that Yuya had his clothes changed in the next scene and Yuzu didn't leave the room :^)</br>  <br>He was wearing underwear<br><br>At most, she got a peek at those glorious athletic gains</br></br></br>  <br>No, that was a different shot. It's from 38 when Yuya was telling Futoshi that he'll have another chance at next year's MCS, but then remembered what Sora said about 'real' duels and no 2nd chances.</br>  <br><br> the mysterious boy shows Yuya his mother or father in a card ("our invasion of Standard is already complete" <br> cue ZA BEASTO modo <br>I could see it, since everyone will be uncarded by the series' end anyway.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No no, it's the episode where Yuya woke up after Yuto died. He was trying to cheer up Futoshi by saying he'll have a second chance and then a memory of Sora saying there are no second chances. If you screw up the first time, you're done.</br></br>  <br>That'd be a way too high escalation when the Lancers are still in the tourney to prove themselves to the Synchro council.</br>  <br>That's very unlikely as there is no mention of Yuya going batshit in the next three episodes</br>  How hard will the tomato be destroyed in 2 days? The audience booing the fuck out of him? He won't be able to see the other lancers and the synchro friends from his position? He won't notice Yuzu was there ?  <br>I don't see it being as crushing as a defeat as it was when Reiji beat him. More like a 'time to rethink some things' kind of defeat.</br>  <br>Oh, you're right, now that I think about it. My bad.</br>  <br>Jack says he'll win in 3 turns and everyone will cheer but when Yuya lasts a fourth turn, everyone wil be BTFO and fall for his LADIES AND GENTLEMAN shtick until Jack finishes him off</br>  <br>this seems accurate</br>  <br>Nusu-10 is pretty good though</br>  Question is, will they let Yuya use Action Cards for Riding Action Duels?<br><br>If you look at the Friendship Cup stadium, the tracks are literally fucking everywhere</br></br>  <br>The Lancers' duel disks aren't compatible with the ones they use with the D-Wheels I don't think</br>  <br>I doubt it, he can duel without those pretty fucking efficiently anyway.</br>  <br>Why the fuck are you running 3 of anything that isn't 003 and 002</br>  <br>Real question is, will they actually use Speed Spells?</br>  YAMEROOOOO  What music would the Yuus listen to?  <br>Yuya - Jpop<br>Yuto - CRAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIN<br>Yugo - Techno or some shit<br>Yuri - Classical music or orchestral metal</br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course not. Those don't exist in this universe.</br>  <br>You can't shill Speed Spells</br>  <br> Tfw they never made nerfed normal magic versions of the big speed spells <br> No Angel Baton or ZE END OF STORM </br></br>  <br>Yuya- Pop<br>Yuto- Post Rock<br>Yugo- Trance<br>Yuri- Terrorcore</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't shill Action Cards either</br>  <br>Action cards exist to prevent needing to shill worthless cards.</br>  Well guys, apparently Yuya can change the course of the weather by overlaying with an eggplant  <br>This is correct, except Yuri probably listens to dark ambient more often than terrorcore.</br>  <br>The real question is, who are the Ruris favorite musician?</br>  <br> Worthless cards exist to prevent needing to shill worthless cards </br>  <br>I like to think the magic shockwave from their first overlay was fucking with the solid vision system.</br>  <br>They aren't real cards, so no one will ever print them.</br>  SHILL THIS<br>SHILL THAT<br>IT'S ALWAYS SHILLING WITH YOU PEOPLE<br>YOU NEVER REALLY LOVED ME DID YOU</br></br></br>  <br>Well Serena probably listens to Nirvana and just goes around mosh pitting people.</br>  Why was he so mad? That he taunted the tomato and ended up getting BTFO?  <br>He was just extremely tsun for him</br>  <br>Considering her deck and outfit theme, i'm surprised we've never seen any indication Yuzu is into music<br><br><br> Implying you cant shill worthless cards <br>They released Half Unbreak</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>RURIIIIII!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and (Stomach Punch!)</br></br>  <br> Yuya is sulking on a park bench <br> camera looks at him from a distance <br> suddenly a brown boot with an orange gem on the side steps in front of the camera <br> person walks up to Yuya <br> Yuya notices him, looks up <br> we only see a close-up of the other guy's mouth, "saying" a few words (without actual audio) <br> hands Yuya Junkuriboh <br> walks away <br> Yuya is still surprised, looks at the card, looks back up again, smiles and heads back into the stadium <br><br>And then, at the end of the show, they meet again and have a duel against each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gets totally trashed by Jack again  <br> hey remember that time you gave me a useless card <br> violence </br></br></br>  should I catch up on the other yugioh series or just say fuck it and start arc v?  <br>By that logic every Yugioh character with a recurring motivation is a meme</br>  <br> They released Half Unbreak <br>Now imagine if it hadn't been Yuma's staple but an action card, they could have released something that wasn't an utter waste of space and ink.</br></br>  <br>In Shun's case, they became memes.</br>  <br>Catch up to Arc-V, then watch all the other shows in between new Arc-V episodes.</br>  <br>watch arc-v and whenever you catch up spend time in between subs releasing on binging the other shows to get more fun references.</br>   Tfw your cardfu will never return and be usable in the modern TCG   Have you kept your childhood partner close to you?  <br>Yuya will never leave his key persons side again after all this shit</br>  <br>I think Yuya's inevitable tuner will be another Deus Ex Machina pendulum magician that turns pendulums into tuners</br>  Jim and Asuka look cute together  <br>Those come in couples though, and magicians already have one tuner with its couple.</br>  <br> and magicians already have one tuner with its couple <br>They're really unlikely to bother shilling the already released Pendulum Magician stuff in the anime though</br></br>  Why does someone so cute have to suffer so much? ;_;  <br>Yeah, but noble dragon is anime material, lets Yuya get out level 7s like clear wing with odd eyes.</br>  <br>It hurts each time I think about it</br>  <br>It'd work yeah, but why would they use a card from a structure deck they already sold instead of making a new one to shill?</br>  <br>He could simply get a synchro pendulum that requires a pendulum tuner+synchro monster, level 7.</br>  <br>In Tag Force Special, Eita plays 2 decks.<br>One is a rock stall deck using Sphinx and Ordeal of a Traveler, the other is Reversal Quiz OTK.<br>Both refelect his Quiz obsession and both are annoying, so TFSP really captured the spirit of the character</br></br></br>  <br>Because anime magicians are kind of worthless due to the retarded restrictions they give them later on, barring antithesis magician.<br>I love antithesis magician and its incredibly simple monster effect so much.</br></br>  <br>More like this.</br>  <br> lets Yuya get out level 7s like clear wing with odd eyes <br>Yuya never used Odd Eyes to get out Dark Rebellion, its more likely he'll get a 3 with a different effect and only bring Odd Eyes into it when he makes his Odd Eyes/Clear wing syncro monster<br><br><br>Meiru using Shaddoll Nekroz was great</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I need a Yuuya in my life</br>  <br>It's the Kensho curse. Calling it now: Yuya will end this series in a cross-dimensional jail cell, forever separated from his key person.</br>  <br> forever separated from his key person. <br>He gets a Sawatari to be fuckbuddies with?</br></br>  <br> Meiru using Shaddoll Nekroz was great <br>Now that her cards have been released, future videogames will use those cards instead</br></br>  <br>I take comfort that whatever ending that Arc-V comes up with can't be nearly as bad or infuriating as how Aldnoah ended up.</br>  <br>Pff. Sawatari? No, instead he'll get  selfcest end. </br>  <br> infuriating <br>It's only infuriating if you cared about it or its characters.<br>The only thing I raged at was asshime, what an awful, awful character. Aside from that, I laughed a lot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuri is part of the Yuya package.<br>I really want their duel to end with EGAO Yuya creepily getting close to him to absorb him while he cries in fear.</br></br>  <br>SAY GOODBYE TO EXODIA</br>    <br>BAZAKA SOUL?</br>  <br>He honestly seems like the one Yuya clone that would be opposed to it, considering his implied hate for anyone with his face.<br> I wonder if that's implying he hates himself too </br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Sawatori would be better as a girl  So, I've been stuck on 5Ds right after Placido got rekt, but I kinda don't have motivation to finish the series. Is it still interesting?  <br>Nah</br>  <br> aki <br> bra <br>Everyone knows women in Yu-Gi-Oh don't wear bras or any underwear fir that matter.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>You just know Fem Sawatari would have massive honkers she's extremely proud of</br>  <br>There are good moments coming up especially the Taiyo duel and Arc Cradle.</br>       You see, in the mid-1800s (when Egypt-mania really took off in the Western world), white people who marveled at these giant ancient constructs applied their strongest racist science and assumed the Egyptians were pasty Aryan Europeans, specifically because only white people could have the technical ability to build the pyramids. Others theorized that they were black, due to the fact that Egypt is, you know, in Africa. <br>At least we know they play card game with stone tablet</br>    Konami. Master of template   tfw we'll never get a YGO protagonist who uses IgKnights or Burning Abyss to ignite the masses burning souls in glorious battle da   Who's the most kissable Yugioh character?  <br> This is hotter if you assume they're still boys and Sawatari just got Papa to buy him some hair extensions </br>  <br>MONSTA CAURDO!!!</br>  <br>Fujoshit please leave</br>  <br>did he do something specific in that scene to warrant that or was yugi paying him back for exodia<br><br>i never got that far</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I just have versatile taste that's all!<br><br>That was Yugi paying him back for everything</br></br></br>  I wish half unbreak was actually a useful card because it has such a cool name<br><br>HALFU UNBREAKU</br></br>  <br><br>Do it for Aporia</br></br>  <br> Burning Abyss <br> fun to watch </br></br>  <br>you misspelled bruno</br>  <br><br>I wish Yuya's deck wasn't so Odd Eyes focused.<br><br>I still propose the idea that Yuya shoild temporarily lose Odd Eyes and evolutions and play pure entermates. Though he's been doing great in Synchro arc so far. Too bad it'll be just a matter of time before hurr durr rebellion otk every game again</br></br></br></br>  <br> Dartshipping <br>At least it's not sparrowshipping</br></br>  <br>Reposting Chinese antics<br>http://ygorganization.com/ocg-06222<wbr>015-ocg-japan-and-china-decklists/</wbr></br></br>  RURI NO TAN  <br>HANASE<br><br>But anon he's just inviting tomato to a sleepover</br></br></br>  <br>Is this the creepiest card in his deck?</br>  <br> Dartshipping <br> Sparrowshipping <br>I want Tumblr to fuck off forever.</br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Oh man, I wasn't even paying attention and got distracted by the mustache.</br>  <br> not wanting a protagonist that sends evil duelists into the burning depths of hell </br>  <br>A part of it is that he only has 3 &gt;2000 ATK monsters in his main deck, one of which is better off used as a scale. I don't think they do such a bad job of rotating the bosses he does have. Anime DRXD is so easy to OTK with in most situations, and pushed aside Odd-Eyes in relevance for most of the battle royale, but it hasn't been seen at all so far during Synchro.</br>  <br><br><br>http://arcvshippings.tumblr.com/mas<wbr>ter%20list<br>Why did I bother looking this up?<br> Ribbonshipping || Eita x Mieru <br> CandyAppleshipping || Sora x Mieru <br> Divineshipping || Magician of Astromancy x Magician of Chronomancy </br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Oh man, they're really going for this Yuya Yuzu tragedy thing, huh?</br>  <br>Why even put that much time into categorizing it<br>Just say Character + Character ffs</br></br>  <br> Eita x Mieru <br>The fuck?

This is indisputable.</br></br>  <br> That belly <br>Fuck I should really get to reading Majikoi, its just sitting there on my hard rive, waiting to be read.</br></br>    <br>12 is less than 31 is less than infinite (but currently in the thousands)<br><br>you are OBJECTIVELY wrong, the most sensible way is month/day/year</br></br></br>  <br>You should. It's one of the few VNs where I liked both the sex scenes and the rest of it.</br>  <br>Dont sexualise Wanko. She is too pure.</br>  <br>tbh the h-scenes were too long and obnoxious for me, they went on forever with each one cumming like a dozen times or some shit.<br><br>the banter with friends and classmates and chilling in the base was maximum comfy though, actually made me feel like I had friends</br></br></br>  <br>Canonically she is one of the best looking girls. She has a fuckload of admirers and even managed to get under Hideo's skin so much that he will remain a virgin forever because he will never get her.</br>  <br> tbh the h-scenes were too long and obnoxious for me, they went on forever with each one cumming like a dozen times or some shit. <br>Sounds like every eroge ever.</br></br>  <br>And then she wrecks her back two-fold.<br><br>Haou-faggots always seem to forget this.</br></br></br>  <br>What if you want to wanko to Wanko?</br>  RE<br>MIN<br>DER</br></br>  <br>Some nerd on /vn/ said this image isn't from the VN. Is this true?</br>  <br>It sure does. I'd still say that Majikoi's h-scenes were decidedly above-average, or at least more in line with my tastes than most.</br>  <br>Sounds like all eroge H-scenes ever.<br><br>However, Majikoi's are fully voiced by A-List VAs and have pretty great art so as far as H-scenes go they are top fucking percentage.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even need to anon, she just naturally is that way without trying to be.</br>  <br>Quite.</br>  <br>Amerifats being Amerifats.</br>  <br> Haou endured literally every other character worth fighting in Majikoi in the meantime and actually beat them, including haxmode tsubame, ageha, shakadou, and tatsuko <br><br> Haou has one-shot-rekt both Lu and Tesshin before, something Momoyo has never been able to match </br></br></br>  <br>Momo has never been in a situation where she has wanted or needed to wreck Lu and Tesshin at once.<br><br>And Momo still completely rekt Seisou. Go home, Seisofag.</br></br></br>  What do when you love Kazuko so much you just can't help it, but you're waifu (who doesn't have anything to do with majikoi) is just as perfect?  <br><br>It's true.</br></br>  <br>Sucks.</br>  <br> "completely" rekt <br>taking pride in defeating a 1% haou after haou was singlehandedly responsible for taking at least 50% (probably more) off of momoyo in one hit? you're delusional, son. pack up and leave buddy before you get rekt even harder than momoyo did.</br></br>  <br>It cant be helped in this case, anon.<br><br>Minatosoft created one of the cutest characters in existance with Wanko.</br></br></br>  <br> this salty Seisofag <br><br>Seisofag go home. Your A edition is over and it sucked hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of majikoi innuendos in the kitchen, this exists.</br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> from one experienced meatsleeve to another </br>  <br>I didn't really like how they flanderized the whole "wanko is the weakest" thing in both her route and the fan disks</br>  <br>She isnt the weakest. In single melee combat, that is supposed to be Miyako.<br><br>Anyways, she doesnt need to be strong to be awesome.</br></br></br>  <br> no momoyo after+ route in any of the As <br>people are sick of momoyo's mary sue shit</br></br>  <br>None of the original heroines got an after route in A, you dumb cunt.</br>  <br> Momoyo <br> Mary sue <br><br>Is all that saltiness fucking up your intelligence? Also, none of the original 5 heroines got an After + in A.<br><br>They got theirs in S.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And still, Miyako's route isn't 90% about repeating over and over how she sucks at everything and how she should just kill herself.<br>Miyako had some romantic scenes too, and lots of sex. What did Wanko have? One sex scene, and the 20 lines-long scene in the bath.</br></br>  <br>Miyako rekts Wanko hand-to-hand though because Wanko  has no natural fighting talent, unlike practically every other girl . Wanko's only saving grace is her demonic obsession with training her naginata skills, she literally can't do any other kind of fighting.<br><br>Now if we were talking about pure athletic ability, like speed and stamina, then yeah Wanko has a gift there.</br></br></br>  <br> implying momoyo isn't the ARCHETYPICAL DEFINITION of a mary sue <br>holy shit are you fucking blind or just willfully retarded?</br></br>  <br> this anon <br> in charge of not knowing what a Mary Sue is <br> in charge of not looking like a stupid cunt <br><br>Overpowered =/= Mary Sue, shit for brains</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Miyako beats Wanko even hand to hand, despite her just being an archer, anon. She does it to prove a point to her so that she understands that her dream isn't going to be realised before it hurts her even more down the long run. You have to be cruel to be kind sometimes, but yeah, Wanko is that weak, sadly.</br></br>  <br>Tfw best girl is on the left</br>  <br>Careful there with the colossal inferiority complex there, Miyakofag. I wasnt saying anything negative about her.<br><br>Also<br> Miyako's scene <br> Romantic <br>Nothing about her route was romantic. It was carnal wish fulfilment which turned into melancholic and melodramatic bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I haven't played her route yet, but aside from her dark-side she really looks perfect. Well, I guess her academic skills are nothing astounding though.<br><br><br> areful there with the colossal inferiority complex there, Miyakofag. I wasnt saying anything negative about her. <br>No, you don't get it. I like Kazuko more than I do Miyako. I was just mad at Miyako having way more scenes than Wanko.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  but yeah, Wanko is that weak, sadly. <br> held the line in the Kawakami war for a good period of time near singlehandedly <br><br>She isnt weak. She is just in the company of monsters. And Lu makes the point that she started training too late in life to make a life out of it. Had she been indoctrinated in it like Momo or Chris, her growth would have been different.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Quite a bit of Miyako's route is about how she sucks, or about how her attitude to people and life sucks. Besides, Wanko's route isn't about her sucking at everything, it's about unrealistic ambitions and getting over them without giving up the dream behind those ambitions, that is, the dream of being able to help and support Momoyo.</br>  <br> I haven't played her route <br> thinks this gives him room to comment <br><br>Momo is lazy, narcisistic, poor at academics and constantly scrounging off Yamato for money and attention.That and she is extremely cold to anyone outside of the Kazama family.<br><br>She isnt perfect in any way, shape or form.<br><br>Again, being overpowered doesnt make you a mary sue</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I haven't played her route yet, but aside from her dark-side she really looks perfect. Well, I guess her academic skills are nothing astounding though. <br>Her darker side is a pretty glaring flaw, and anyways, there's basically one thing she's good at. She's really, really good at that thing, but being good at one thing isn't enough to make a character Mary Sue.</br></br>   Rei has a personality   <br> It puts people off even if they genuinely like the character <br><br>You don't seem put off if you're still coming into eva threads and keeping up with eva related things.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, I think it got angry at the anon posting Rei x Gendo porn in the other thread.</br>  <br>How predictable.</br>  <br><br>I'm not everybody.</br></br>  <br>Post all your replies to him with Gendo/Rei porn next time.</br>  Are you ready for Smith? jesus Lerche is doing a really good job here and the censorships is almost nonexistant.<br><br>Manga:<br> 8 days until chapter 35  <br>Since secondaries are going rampage again spamming thread without even knowing what are they watching, lets have a better thread.</br></br></br></br>  So Suu and Papi have probably had sex right?  <br> rachnera <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EEP<wbr>TRC2OP4w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> I was disappointed it wasn't a hentai from the first chapter of the manga, because the originals were downright pornographic at times. </br>  <br>Suu is truly best</br>  <br><br><br>Like, not even gonna lie. Someone posted a webm of the MC giving Miaa an orgasm by stroking her tail and I was like "Sweet, a well animated monster girl hentai series!" and then I watched the first ep and was bummed.</br></br></br>  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br> 100+ years old <br> still looking relatively youthful and able to fight hordes of vampires with his students and easily dispatch them <br> can heal people using his ripple <br> can see the future of people using his ripple <br><br>Were all subsequent ripple users shit because they were selfish and didn't maintain their training into old age? Also did Tonpetty have a stand? Because the healing other via touch (not like how zeppli unlocked the ripple in johnathan and his ripple healed him) and future reading seems completely out of line with the Ripple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the lullaby his mother used to sing him to sleep before she died.</br>  So why are retards calling Jo2uke Josefumi? Jo2uke/Gappy is his own person, we have no indication that his personality is exactly the same as Josefumis so it makes no sense to call him that. People don't refer to him as fucking Kira  Last night I dreamed Part 4 anime was announced.  <br>That's one fucking weird lullaby, no wonder Dario drinks so much</br>  <br>Narancia was going to die on those baers in that same time span, Diavolo just erased everything in between and he appeared dead all of a sudden. It's a scare tactic.</br>  New material for the movie: Hinata and Himawari's sketches.  <br>She's at least 16. That's perfectly fine.</br>  <br>Then why the fuck are you in a thread discussing the movie about Bolt?</br>  <br>I don't know man, a 30-year old dating his 16-year old cousin doesn't usually fly</br>  <br>Just how she's starting to seem like Sakura is enough to make her lose points(shivers) we already have to deal with pink shit who's just a clone of tsunade, only difference being their looks. But if salada became the third copy I would never read kishi work again</br>  <br>Hmmmm yeah I guess you can say that kishi doesn't seem the type to do age gaps</br>  where do you think you're going?  Dunno, you tell me  <br>I need more context here, what's my motivation? And a little backstory would be nice.</br>    Bitch what's wrong with yo leg  <br>Out of my way bitches, I have to get to 4th period.</br></blockquote>]
