[ Does anyone read KissXSis? Or am I the only one?  I do but &gt;Vortex  <br>You might aswell just read a doujin on fakku instead, the manga doesnt stand out amongst others in terms of fanservice but the OVA series is one of the best in that department. Unless of course you're reading it for the plot, in which case i would call you a fucking retard and insist that you stop lying to yourself</br>  <br>fuck off newfag</br>  Dropped that shit as soon as they forced the sensei.  <br>Sporty Sis &gt; Lewd Sis &gt; Miss &gt; Piss &gt; Miss's sis</br>  only for the sensei  <br>Lewd Sis &gt; Sporty Sis &gt; Miss's sis &gt; Miss &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Piss</br>  pee chan is best girl  <br> fakku </br>  The more they put in piss and sensei the worse the manga gets. I would event take a fucking loli chapter right now and the loli is the worst character  I look at the pictures`  <br>Yes, but only with my hand firmly grasping my dick</br>  <br>It's shit because sensei never had a chance of winning from the start. He's going to fuck his sisters and that's it. What a ripoff.</br>  <br>I do.<br><br>I don't know how they managed to turn my incest fetish into an older woman/teacher fetish but if they think I like piss, they're mistaken.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sporty and Lewd are the same sis, the other sis is nerdy sis</br></br>  <br>Has he had sex yet?</br>  <br>I will never understand why they ducked the foot fuck</br>  <br>No, but his sisters have given him handjobs (and possibly blowjobs while he slept)</br>  <br>Haven't touched it in years but that has more to do with the TL being fuck-slow. Could actually start again, so yeah, thanks for reminding me, anon.</br>  <br>Tw&gt; Loli &gt; Sensei &gt;&gt;&gt; Piss</br>  <br> Tw <br>Twins*</br></br>  <br>only for mikuni brother (;</br>  <br>dad &gt; lewd sis &gt; piss &gt; miss &gt;sporty sis &gt;miss sis</br>  <br>Piss&gt;miss&gt;sporty sis=lewd sis&gt;miss sis.</br>  <br>I did. I really fucking hate Piss and the teacher.</br>  Best admiral version  thats not a pic of no fucks given Kizaru.  <br>I was talking about adult!Law. I don't think he touched him as a kid, though that would've been good too. PTSD!Law sounds pretty good. Let that slut suffer.<br><br>Not gay, and well. I'm a masochist so Doffy is perfect to me.<br><br>That would be acceptable.</br></br></br></br></br>   Why would Kuzan join BB???? <br><br>Consider Blackbeard from an in world perspective rather than an omniscient reader perspective.<br><br>Kuzan is disgruntled with WG, hell, even Akainu is.<br><br>Blackbeard wants to destroy it, he doesn't kill unless he has no other way, he's got the same gift of recruiting strong people as Luffy.<br><br>He recruited Kuzan, it is Oda's way of telling us no Luffy won't automatically have stronger ally than Luffy.<br><br>Remember Hao from Shaman King? That guy who won the final fight despite being the antagonist?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't he just quit the marines this chapter?</br>  Do we know what Kaido looks like yet?  <br>Essentially</br>  IKUZE SHINING RUNNING FOREVER  <br>Nothing about Doflamingo is pure</br>  What does intercrural with her feel like?  <br><br>The chapter gace me the impression that his men were still loyal to him though, and that he still had the job of capturing pirates so the king hid the pirates in his castle.</br></br>  <br>he's a  big guy </br>  I was certain Kidd, Basil and Apoo were after Big Mom. Now I have no idea how their quest is supposed to tie with Strawhats, Shanks seems so far away from everything that is happening.<br><br>Speaking of Yonkos, I'm surprised Kuzan is with the Blackbeards, although I'm not certain if he is part of the crew or just has agreements with them. Blackbeard might have hidden depths, that was always hinted anyway.</br></br>  <br>Have you not experienced soap on your dick? it's not the greatest<br><br>Alvida is the one you want<br><br> perpetual slipperiness </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we saw an outline<br><br>he's a gigantic slug</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he's pure cuteness.</br>  <br>I didn't understand like this. It was more that Akainu shouted "don't come home until you get shit done". By "shit done" he means wrecking Luffy, Law and possibly Doflamingo.</br>  <br>probably in his zoan form.</br>  Which yonkou would you team up with/aim to take down if you were a pirate<br><br>I think mom is the best choice to try and take down.<br><br>Surely when shit hits the fan and she starts cannibalizing her crew it will be easy to cause discord.</br></br></br></br>  <br>shes a hambeast lol</br>  Could this be Kaido given the latest chapter?  <br>You wouldn't feel anything with Alvida.</br>  <br>His brotherly love is pure. Well, it  was .</br>  Everyone remember to do your best too appreciate Penguin today!<br><br>And Shachi is pure.</br></br>  <br>Most likely.</br>  <br>Exactly, and Fujitora doesn't wish to come back so he won't do any of that shit.</br>  <br>I have two cavities</br>  <br><br>He's  pure shit </br></br>  <br><br><br>Fuck off tumblrtards.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not certain about that. Fujitora may despise the system, but it's exactly because it is condencendent with pirates.</br>  <br><br><br> &gt;&gt;/anywhere but here/ </br></br></br>  <br>Shachi pleases old men for money.</br>  <br>Fuck you that made me laugh way too hard, I probably woke someone up.</br>  why does this medium attract so many deviants and retards in general<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>all of you have autism<br>get help</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, I won't deny.<br>But he's also pure love.</br></br>  <br>Totoro</br>  <br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br>    <br>I'm sorry, anon. Hopefully they are small.<br><br><br>Please don't be rude to Shachi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hao had won before the fighting even started</br>  <br>I want to rub Blackbeard's hairy ass.</br>  Luffy and Kidd confirmed for being the craziest persons in One Piece since they both attack 2 Yonko at the same time.  I want fujoshits to go away  <br>Fuck forgot the pic</br>  <br>Cancerous hambeasts are cancerous, what's new.</br>  <br>I want you to go away</br>  <br> Not gay <br>I'm sorry to be the one to have to break this to you, anon...</br></br>   g/a/ys want to suck Doflamingo's dick <br> tr/a/nnies want to fuck Doflamingo's dick <br><br>WHERE DID YOU ALL EVEN COME FROM<br>The homo radar literally sky rocketed today what the fuck?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame SnK.

Make your own post and stop stealing my posts like a fucking nigger who saw a stray bike.<br><br><br> This is me</br></br></br></br>  Would the marines under Fujitora be allowed to come back to base or are they essentially exiled with Fujitora as well?<br><br>Would be sad that their careers are ruined by a faggot like Fujitora who spent less time in the Marines than they did.</br></br>  <br> Now I have no idea how their quest is supposed to tie with Strawhats <br><br> Kidd and crew kill Shanks <br> Luffy gets pissed <br> ??? <br> PROFIT </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fujos have always been a part of /a/.</br></br>  <br> up against that shichibukai bastard <br> eyes light up <br>Kaido clearly interested because he thinks they're talking about Doffy</br></br></br>  <br>What is a "Fujo" ?</br>  <br>This is what newfag hambeasts actually believe.<br><br>Fujoshits were never welcomed on /a/.</br></br></br>  <br>They've definitely been much worse bad in the past couple of months. Posting shit from tumblr without even the decency to try to hide it.</br>  <br>Don't act like they just appeared out of nowhere when the truth is you just never go to the OP thread regularly.</br>  <br><br>Contrary to popular belief there's girls on here, just sayin.</br></br>  <br>Neither were autists, but here you are.</br>  Can someone explain to me how the fuck one piece generals are attracting fujoshits here what happen some fujo anime ended or what?  reminder yellow monkey is the strongest admrial  This thread no this whole board used to be about manime.<br><br>Now that moe shit is mainstream all of the gaylords and fat cunts started flocking here.<br><br>/a/ is officially kill?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Back to your pod, landwhale.</br>  <br> fujoshits were never welcomed on /a/ <br>That depends what thread we're talking about.<br>Not like it matters whether they're welcome or not, because they're already here.</br></br></br>  <br>This arc included a massive amount of focus on the #1 fujo character from his very first appearance, Law, as well as other characters that were either also already very popular with fujoshits or became very popular very fast (Doffy, Corazon, Sabo, etc)</br>  <br><br>Why does Luffy want to attack Kaidou anyway? The entire plan was to provoke Kaidou to take down Doflamingo, not attack him, right?</br></br>  <br>Legbeards aren't girls.</br>  <br>is that your definition of fun?</br>  <br>The shounen genre is actually quite popular among us. Lots of cute characters, so there are plenty of ships to choose from. There's something for everyone. <br><br>Kizaru a piece of shit. I've never understood why people like him.</br></br></br>  <br>SnK destroyed all the fujoshits' LGBT fantasies so they fled with their tumblr fanfics to One Piece.</br>  <br>trap, trans, fag you guys don't know what to call yourselves anymore but don't take the title of girl if you can't make babies</br>  <br>Law. He's like a walking fujobait.</br>  <br>Just because you whack off your wang doesn't make you a girl, Bill.</br>  <br>They're all you'll ever get though. NEETs don't deserve any better.</br>  <br> 1337 <br><br>The chosen one has spoken.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's somekind of huge creature working for Kaido. It has tentacles, and those tentacles are so huge, its sucktion cups were what we saw sucking Capone's ship up in the air. Capone is now working for Kaido and his job is to capture Caesar so that Kaido can keep getting those SMILEs. That creature is bigger than Kraken so it might be even different species. Rogue Sea king, artificial creature or other mythical beast maybe?</br></br>  <br> Lots of cute characters, so there are plenty of ships to choose from. <br>So then the same reason the rest of /a/ watches PreCure.</br></br>  <br>Hey, don't talk shit about my legs, they're always smooth as fuck.</br>  <br>People like him because he's a piece of shit that looks like he stars in JAVs in his spare time.</br>  <br>How can he just quit when he was drafted?</br>  <br> SnK destroyed all the fujoshits' LGBT fantasies <br>How so?</br></br>  <br>It did ? How ?<br>Hell I remember last month chapter included ErwinLevi fujobait.</br></br>  <br>Capone is working for Big Mom.</br>  I am so fucking hyped for Vegapunk.  <br> but don't take the title of girl if you can't make babies <br>And yet some guys wonder why they can't ever put their dick in anything but a hoover and their dog's anus.</br></br>  <br>By mutiny.<br><br>Like he just did this chapter.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but I can</br>  Will Green Bull also be a huge moralfag? Maybe Akainu should do a psychology test instead of hiring them for their height and fighting power.  <br>At least we still have a dick.</br>  <br><br> can't deal with any marines at all until he catches lawhat <br> never chases them <br> never has to do marine stuff ever again, can't be redrafted or forgiven </br></br></br></br>  <br>This is by far the best Law pic out there.</br>  <br>Oda copped out on Smoker.<br><br>Smoker didn't even get any new stitches on his face despite Dofla just making new and new bloody scars all over his face.<br><br>It's bullshit when he gets bandages on his body instead when Dofla attacked his face more than his body.<br><br>Guess Oda can't have a disfigured Smoker in his kiddy manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When Freud said girls wanted a dick, he was referring to the priviledge that goes with it. Not the actual thing.<br>Also technically they do have one. It's called a clit.</br></br>  MPC Logo thread   Windows   <br>I just found out about Baka mplayer<br><br>Is it better than MPC-hc?

Its a petty much confirmed fact that Miku is going to be more rock and cooler then Niwaka. Natsuki gets a kick out of watching Riina squirm but it will be good to see her guiding little niwaka into the right direction in regards to rock</br></br>  <br>Even if TakeP is several times better just for the fact that he seems to have a decent backstory and development, but I still like AkaP.<br><br>It's funny how they're trying to salvage him by giving him more prominence in the new Nomakes for the 765 re-airing, but it's not as if anyone is actually translating those.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The PV had an unknown voice (Presumably Natsuki) saying "That partner of yours is pretty cool huh?"<br><br>That might be Natsuki talking to Riina whereas she refers to Miku as the "Cool One".<br><br>By Natsuki's standards, anybody who is passionate about their goals and confident in who they are is totally rocking. And Miku and her passion for her Cat Persona fits that bill.<br><br>Really, Natsuki refers to anybody BUT Riina as cool and rocking. <br><br><br> but it's not as if anyone is actually translating those. <br><br>Well, I can give a brief rundown of the first NoMake+ The circumstances of AkaP's recruitment were as follows:<br><br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wb<wbr>xbQ86iDGA&amp;feature=youtu.be</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>- 765 is falling on hard times and really need more help<br>- Takagi is wishing for a Ray of Hope, someone suddenly knocks on the office door<br>- It's the goddamn delivery man<br>- Takagi is disappointed, but another person enters. An AkaP with spaghetti spilling everywhere enters<br>- Takagi laughs maniacally. He decides on AkaP as the "chosen one"<br>- Takagi gives a weird ass interview<br>- AkaP reveals that he wanted to to be someone who cheers people up and gives hope. Most notably, he found great interest and admiration of people in the entertainment industry. But he was ultimately a talentless hack when it comes to creative work, be it singing, dancing or writing.<br>- He still wanted to work in the industry that cheers people up and gives hope though, so he just reckoned that he should work as staff at a talent agency. So that at the very least, he can help someone become what he aspired to be.<br>- After realizing he gave such a sappy story, AkaP spilled spaghetti everywhere again and as he packed up his things in embarassment, he asked Takagi to forget everything he said<br>- Takagi said fuck that, you're now the Producer for this Agency.<br><br>And with some additional hiccups and pressuring from Takagi, AkaP became the Producer for 765.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I hope we get a scene with Natsuki with her hair down.

Though it seems I remembered correctly that she sleeps on a park bench. So my question still stands.</br>  <br>According to her Phenogram route she atleast has a tent to sleep in.</br>  <br><br>This, Kurisu being stinky only makes me like her more.</br></br>  <br>Shit, I swear I saw a beautiful girl on youtube who had the same hairstyle and beautiful eyes. Looked exactly like her. Gotta find it again somehow.</br>  <br>If you find it, post it so I can be disappointed again</br>  <br>It's pretty much impossible. It was a video response to a certain video, but video responses are dead because Google doesn't like people connecting with each other. I finished watching Steins Gate just recently and remembered that I saw a girl many years ago, who looked almost exactly like that. Especially the hairstyle and the greenish-blue eyes.</br>  <br>I'm not into gay shit</br>  <br>I decided to give it another quick read, and I realized that the first time I read it I had no idea who 4°C was. Now the cameos are pretty funny, seeing him suffer</br>  <br>What the baka did you just fucking say about me, you little baka?

But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn hentai. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  Hey, remember that time when Kurisu was anything less than perfect?<br><br>Yeah, me neither.</br></br>  Do you think Okabe had the Reading Steiner ability because for the universe to have Time Travel they had to have someone to observe its changes across world lines; otherwise the nature of time travel would be utterly pointless if there were no one to actually observe its existence<br><br>This is riding on the whole thing about things only existing once they are observed</br></br>  <br>Everyone has reading steiner to some degree, okabe was just lucky enough to have it strongly.</br>  <br><br>If only the anime didn't make it out to be some deus ex machina for other people to get reading steiner, the VN made it seem like less of an asspull</br></br>  <br>I cant remember the anime too clearly apart from butchering moeka/braun but how did they asspull it? I mean with faris and luka I thought it flowed pretty naturally it is something everyone has it a bit</br>  <br>Not him, but anon may have been referring to how they handled it in the OVA</br>  <br>The movie was bad too.</br>  <br>dat drunk kurisu, tho</br>  <br>I remember, anon. Although I never actually got around to watching the movie.</br>  <br>Wish the movie was about funny romantic antics instead of bad writing.</br>  <br>I still love the idea of a Kurisu-centric drunk escapade comedy in the vein of The Hangover -- but with time travel and suffering</br>  <br>I still love the idea of okabe retelling his adventures while kurizu sits there blushing and tsundereing hearing all of it.</br>  <br>I just want something with a deredere Kurisu<br>Is that too much to ask?</br></br>  <br> they try to sabotage SERN together <br> kurisu is so deredere okabe doesnt know what to do anymore </br></br>  <br><br> dere kurisu <br> okabe spilling his spaghetti <br><br>would watch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So when we say the Upa mask girl is non-canon, does she actually contradict any established canon or is it just Word of God?</br>  <br>Different events for the same worldline, divergence.</br>  <br>What different events? Only one world line is depicted, in chronological order from Suzuha's perspective, until Okabe undoes his d-mail at the end.</br>  Is the movie that bad?  <br><br>it's not terrible, but they could have done a lot more with it than they did. <br><br>I mean all it is is a reverse roles movie where kurisu is the hero and okibe is the damsel in distress. <br><br>It was kind of a cop-out so they could make kurisu a little more dere, but meh.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it canon?<br>I remember reading that it's canon to the VN.</br></br>  <br> kurisu will never confess that she loves you even though you are a stupid chuuni blockhead. </br>  <br><br>Oh yeah it's definitely canon, since Kurisu is the one that gave him his first kiss as a teen, but still, it just felt lacking. <br><br>It was a sweet movie that made my heart warm but still, nothing substancial</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> still haven't watched that or the tamako market movie <br><br>What the fuck is wrong with me? I haven't stopped watching anime, but these movies just don't have the pull.

One episode?</br></br></br>  I wouldn't really compare this to Madoka. Madoka had hints that it was going to be darker from the very beginning and Mami's death just solidified that. This series just did a full 180 on the tone in the span of a couple of seconds, in the first episode no less.  <br> I didn't even consider that she wasn't dead for good.  <br><br><br>I'm reading it for the other characters.<br>It kind of feels like having a family member go insane and not being able to do anything about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Guys I want to buy a shovel just in case, can you guys recommend me one that will do the job?  <br> standard SOL with characters who seem slightly more on edge than usual <br> final episode <br> lol main bitch crazy, it's was a zombie apocalypse all along <br><br>Is this even possible to pull off without it coming off as an edgey ass pull?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Zombie flicks are great. <br>Zombieshit is fucking terrible.

Which is why she's running around with the perma-100-yard-stare.</br>  <br>The point of putting the characters in a dark place is the catharsis when they come out. There have been countless points where the story could have become dark, but instead the focal point has always been in the aversion. It's not about being dark or "suffering", it's about being on the knife-edge between the threat being too real and the audience disengaging from caring about the characters properly, and it being too obviously false and not providing the appropriate mood whiplash at the end. We've had six volumes of it doing everything short of actually killing anyone in order to convince us that anyone could be killed.</br>   "Hardtacks tastes like 'survival'" <br><br>damn, clues all over the place.</br></br>   end of school day <br> have the beginning of an after school club meeting <br> realise that you left your bag <br> return to the classroom to fetch it <br>Why were all her friends still there, what did she think they were there for?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon is not talking about that, though.</br>  <br> The point of putting the characters in a dark place is the catharsis when they come out <br>That's not really how zombie works anon...</br></br>  <br>Not really. They're commonly associated with military rations and camping food. Even if the story hadn't taken a zombie-turn, that line still would've made sense.</br>  It's times like these that I really wish anime and manga had there own separate boards. These threads used to actually be great with actual discussion, now we get nothing but shit posting. I hate being that anon but it seriously sucks.i  <br>Bitch be bonkers.<br>That's the room with those people. That's what she thinks.</br></br>  <br>Out of curiosity, how common do y'all think the first episode wake up feet shot is in anime?</br>  <br>Lesbian sex of course.</br>  <br>Hanging out after class rather than going straight home as go-home clubs do it.</br>  <br>It's how this story has worked, multiple times. Again: not a western movie.</br>  When do they kill the dog?    <br>When they run out of food.</br>  <br>Thanks anon, just what I came here to complain about.</br>  <br>Dog is another delusion. They already ate it long ago.</br>  <br>You literally need to ignore and report anyone shitposting. This includes people baiting with 'elitist mangafags' or trying to start shit between fanbases. <br><br> I hope it improves after a few episodes. The first epsisode threads are often horrible, even if the first 2 of this had alright threads during CReep. </br></br></br>  <br>Manga board would be dead bar 3 or 4 big manga generals. So is no point having it. <br>If you don't want to be spoiled read the manga yourself or just don't visit threads as it has always been a risk that you would be spoiled in any thread about an adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Why is the comic so much better than the shitfest series?</br>  <br>Again, the charm-point and "unique-factor" of series is western zombies.<br>We're just going to sit and wait who is right on this one, anon.</br></br>  <br> Manga board would be dead <br>Why is this a problem again?</br></br>  The idea that the zombies still retain some of their humanity even when turned is a really horrifying concept to me.  I'm glad at least Miki's getting the love she deserves now.  <br>Yeah I know was just hoping it would be different for this show. Like you said tho anon itll probably die down by episode 3 or 4.<br> <br>Where did I say anything about being spoiled? I've read up to chapter 35 and I clearly said the manga threads used to be great. Now that the anime has aired the threads will be shit until the end of the show. Which sucks as previous threads were great.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they can actually show violence instead of dumb people killing themselves by doing dumb stuff for the millionth time. Best examples are Issue 100 and Issue 144.</br>  <br>At least this thread isn't as bad as the last one. They can get better, right?</br>  <br>That guy clearly had read the manga, why do you want to force people to read the manga at every chance you have?</br>  <br>Why make a new board if it isn't going to be used?</br>  <br>This picture is literally the only reason I picked up this series again.</br>  <br>I can see why.</br>  somebody wake this bitch up. shes useless.  I wish Mii-kun kept the eyepatch. <br><br><br> I was really sad when Megu-nee resisted her zombie urges and went to the basement.  <br> And when Mii-kun thought that Kei came back to the school. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I could live in a zombie apocalypse together with her instead of being forced to work by my parents.</br>  <br>It obviously will be used considering all the babies whining in this thread.</br>  Reading through the manga again and noticed the walking dead poster in   the radio girls hideout ;_;   pretty neat   highschool full of adult male students and teachers <br> none of them live </br>  <br>I don't really remember the issues, I just buy the compendiums. Actually with walking dead happened bit same as here, I really enjoyed the comic but then the tv-series sort of destroyed the franchise</br>  <br>she looks like an 80s action movie female lead</br>  <br><br><br>Being a cute girl automatically gives you a +50% survival rate</br></br></br>  <br>Looks kinda chuuni.</br>  <br>They died protecting the cute girls.</br>  <br>The only good aspect of this show is Rick and his ruthlessness. The next good scenes will be Rick killing the Wolves, the crew meeting up with Jesus and Carl shooting up Camp Negan.</br>  <br> 144 <br>being 2 issues behind now I wish I didn't read this, oh well</br></br>  <br>The charm point is the characters. It's a fucking Kirara series, dude. The zombies provide a way to explore those characters, but it's not "about" them, and it definitely doesn't take its tone from any kind of Western movie that I can think of.<br><br>And we hardly need to wait to know that in every single arc thus far, the story has done its best to put the characters in a dark as place as possible, then avert it to provide a strong emotional finale. Without that aversion, it wouldn't be able to provide that emotional whiplash that's served as the core to its storytelling throughout.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, as fat neckbeard you'd be the first one to die so you really have no place in either universe!</br>  <br>They made the logical choice of evacuating to less crowded places than a school.</br>   entire first episode derailed by a fucking dog that only showed up alive for one panel in the manga and died in the next <br> make mii show up in the first episode, making her backstory only able to be told in flashbacks which the anime probably won't even bother to cover <br> S2 never <br>FEEL MY RAGE</br></br></br>  <br>How about being a cute boy?</br>  <br> Walking Dead tv-series poster <br>Mangaka confirmed for pleb</br></br>  <br> &gt;entire first episode derailed by a fucking dog that only showed up alive for one panel in the manga and died in the next <br>You fags are relentless</br></br>  <br>I really like the comic Carl, eyepatch gives a special touch. Completely opposite from the tv-series.</br>  <br>The manga isn't really that popular. They're probably using the anime simply for advertisement.</br>  <br>Insta death</br>  <br>Indeed, I actually really that part of the story.<br> Also it hinted that Yuki's psychosis isn't completely debilitating.  </br></br>   mfw I almost watched this piece of shit <br>Good luck with your shit show, retards.</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>Trust the mangaka, he's working in the anime</br>  <br>How about a cute  reverse trap </br>  <br>It's like the author of the manga wants to fuck this up.</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336<br> You're welcome. </br></br>  <br>Everyone expected some deaths after reading issue 143, but that issue was really horrifying. I seriously didn't expect them to top the  50000-100000 big horde  but Kirkman knows how to create even more shock , namely by killing 12 fucking people, among them are Ezekiel, pregnant Rosita, Olivia and even a child(he's black though, so no real loss. <br><br>I'm smart enough for university and know how to handle a melee weapon. Besides, I am so cowardly that no zombie could ever reach me.<br><br>He won't keep the eyepatch   because some crazy 16yo slut took his virginity while telling him how sexy his eyehole was. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing wrong with those changes.</br>  <br>Already went there actually, when I click on the chapters all I get is an empty page.<br><br>Maybe god doesn't want me to read it.</br></br></br>  <br>Kirara also had Madoka spinoffs, your point?</br>  <br>I think he's looking for 38, Anon.</br>  <br>It's fucking true.<br><br> They're probably using the anime simply for advertisement. <br>Which is fucking stupid because that never works out well. If they even attempted a faithful adaption there could be hopes for a S2, and merch could flow.<br><br>I wish I could, but as it stands, I can't. Just wait till they end it on a cliffhanger with the helicopter in the distance and a fade to black.<br><br>God knows why.<br><br>You're wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  fuck, I already love this show and now everyone here says it's shit. Why does /a/ have such awful fucking taste  <br> glenn isn't dead in the show when he should've died in season 3 <br>What the everloving fuck did they do with him? His survival has to have some change to the story.</br></br>  <br> Smart enough for university <br>I swear I have this conversation every time we talk about zombie apocalypse. Neckbeards harbor fantasies about apocalypse because "then I could be free and use my survival skills and superior intelligence", even though survival on zombie apocalypse is highly dependent on physical condition and luck. The fact you are "smart" and in university does jack shit, the muscular jockeys you hated back in high school would be the ones to survive, dominating the gene pool even in your brave new world. I see you read walking dead but that doesn't really prepare you for anything.</br></br>  <br>Madoka was both an established series and impossibly popular. That kind of series can run pretty much anywhere. Gakkou Gurashi is neither.<br><br>Madoka also never tried to be character-driven, or to have SoL-like storytelling and characters.</br></br></br>  <br>I remember they've done that in GuP.</br>  <br>Okay faggot, what is wrong with having Miki from the beginning?</br>  <br>The word "everyone" is a dangerous poison. Just like using the name of a board to refer to a few people on it.</br>  <br> We will never get a SoL Madoka spinoff <br>Now I'm sad.</br></br>  <br>So you are just going to discard Madoka being in the magazine "because it was popular"? Besides Madoka was entirely character driven. I'm not necessarily saying the characters were good, but every conflict in the series was character driven.</br>  <br>Didn't you read his post or are you that stupid?</br>  <br> now everyone here says it's shit <br>No, there are people saying that there are parts that are different from the manga and ruin further development. It's not that it's shit, it's that it clashes with the original story.</br></br>  <br>Recently saw in Hidamari. I guess it has its roots</br>  Hey guys, can you catch zombiness through bodily fluids? Like fucking a half-zombie girl for example?  <br>Finding her was an entertaining part of the manga. Now it won't happen because she is already there.</br>  <br>Why is everyone on /a/ an overweight black teacher named Tony?</br>  <br> which is fucking stupid <br>So you believe you are entitled to voice your opinion against people that are actually calculating profits and trained for their job? I agree, I want a faithful adaption, but its all about money.</br></br>  <br>Impossible, nothing can become another Madoka-tier.<br>The state of those threads is the result of different trolls and shitposter trends mixing over the span of nearly 3 years, coupled with a movie that pissed half of the fandom off. It's also the main playground of one of the most autistic posters in recent history, which led to the current stockholm syndrome tripfag worshipping that is rampant in them.<br><br><br>Can you actually read korean or will you just look at the pretty pictures?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why would you do that?</br>  <br>He still needs to impregnate Maggie. After that, he's fair game.<br><br>My intelligence just estimates my boundaries and tells me what I should and shouldn't do. For example, fighting more than 2 zombies at once isn't a smart idea. Fighting against of provoking other people isn't a good idea either. Buying lots of supplies before-hand should be a given. Besides, early human history tells us that it's not the guy who fights against tigers all day is the one who spreads his genes but the coward who hides or uses traps instead of actively hunting. <br>Moreover, I actually have some knowledge in survival (from some shitty books, but it's still better than nothing) and a shitty luck that keeps me alive and lucky, just unhappy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can fap to those toenails.</br>  <br>I can read it.<br><br>Got it to work by disabling adblock, guess it was messing with the website somehow.</br></br></br>  <br>mustard gas pls</br>  <br>Depends. Realisticly, the zombie would have to drink water to keep it's bodily fluids from drying out.</br>  Taking bets now, how will the anime end? I'll screencap responses so we can all laugh at each other when it airs.  <br> I see no shovel <br>It's right there in the bottom left of the picture.</br></br>  <br>She'd still kill you if you try.</br>  <br>I'm still confused<br> Did the radio girl killed herself or she got infected and turned? </br></br>  <br>I recall Aria doing this. Nothing else comes to mind.</br>  Here's your new thread.<br><br>By the way, vol.11 chapter 1 is finished for those of us here who want to discuss the plot.</br></br>  I want to kill this fucking cunt.<br><br>  Should've linked it, OP.<br><br><br/></br></br> </br></br>  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/#p<wbr>art-3</wbr></wbr>  <br>Sure.<br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/</wbr></br></br>  I think Yukino might like 8man, can someone reassure me of this?  <br>too soon, anon.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!   Yui's face when she wins the 8bowl   <br>How can one girl be so cute?</br>  Does Yukino realize she is in love or she still at the stage where she feels love and doesn't know how to describe it? <br><br>Also, not trolling here, has Iroha ever been shown to care about 8man?</br></br>  <br> Also, not trolling here, has Iroha ever been shown to care about 8man? <br>Vol 10.5 chapter 3, when she convinces him to take a photo with Yukino and Yui in order to create good memories</br></br>  <br>No one in the service club has experienced genuine love before. They're all at a loss for what's going on and how to proceed.<br><br>Yukino has a request though, so maybe that'll be their answer.</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder what would her request entail...</br>  <br>I can clearly see 8man will take a step forward while having a monologue that his move might be a mistake and throwing everything in. And Yui will reject 8man's confession. Because, there is a reason why she never attempt to after the fireworks festival.  And that's where Yukino will step in. </br>  I haven't watched S2 yet, but did 8man and Yukino ever finish their "competition" that Sensei set up for them at the start of the series?  <br>It finishes at the end of the school year.</br>  <br>In S1? So it ended already? I just must have missed it then.</br>    <br>School year hasn't finished yet</br>  Are these generals the second coming of them katwa shoujo ones?<br>Will these go on btb even after vol 12 is released  by Yen Press? </br>  <br>Are these actual spoilers or is an anons opinion?</br>  Does anyone have a link to all the pdfs? I remember someone posted a MEGA link but it's gone now.... :(  Why does Hikki always stare at Yui's yuis?<br>That's so gross</br>  So, let me get this: double YY are willing to go for a threesome relationship with 8man while he just want 1 girl because "muh genuine"? He's not only a huge fag at this point, but also a huge jerk.  <br>And you're an idiot</br>  <br>because they are proper Yuis, unlike Yukinoshita's.</br>  <br>Shut up, Yui. Everybody knows it rouses you to orgasm level being watched by him while also shit talking him down.</br>  <br>He's a heterosexual teenage boy.</br>  Who won the 8inchbowl?  <br>What the hell were you watching all this time?</br>    Yukino's Yukinos are justice  <br>Bet my ass she totally gets off on that when she's home alone at night.</br>  How good is this succubus in bed?  <br>50%</br>  <br>Would Yukino even let 8man go to her house alone? What if Haruno catches them alone while she's out shopping?</br>  <br>It depends whether or not you are able to give her something genuine.</br>  <br>It depends if you can handle extreme cowgirl rides</br>  <br> implying she's not a virgin who's just waiting for her own genuine </br>    <br>Speaking of which, do you think sensei is a virgin?</br>  <br>No, she lived together with a man</br>  <br>Read the novel already, secondary scum.</br>  <br>The novels indicated she lived with someone before, but took some of her stuff away. Living together goes with sex right?</br>  <br><br>Not just a man, a gigolo.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much all of chapter 2 in volume 10.5, it's notable since even though Iroha was the one who dragged him out, all she wanted to do was the things he personally thought were fun. In other words she was making it so that the date was centered around him enjoying himself rather than just him trying to pander to her. <br><br>Then there's the whole giving him chocolate in private stuff. She's surprisingly considerate since she knew he get's uncomfortable when the other two girls see that kind of shit. <br><br><br>Anon opinions, you can tell from the last sentence alone. <br><br><br> Hmm, that’s funny, the chest that’s puffing out looks a lot smaller… Is the perspective off or something? In any case, I’ll go ahead and request that be fixed for the Blu-Rays! <br><br>Because they change size every now and then so he get's extremely confused. <br><br> Though he was actually staring at Iroha's chest in this case. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sensei had boyfriend(s), but never managed to get them to commit.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Holy fuck, I thought some people were just baiting when they said I don't understand x or y scene but after reading some of these comments I now know that they have poor reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe she just realizes YY as competition and she doesn't want to explicitly show it or better yet; not get yandere'd on</br>  <br><br> gigolo <br><br>Would you let Sensei be your sugar momma?</br></br></br></br>  <br> gigolo <br>That was just Frog's bullshit. He was even worse than Spyro.</br></br>  <br> “Oh, I can take the picture for you.” <br> “Iroha-chan, you should take a picture with us, too.” <br> “Yes, by all means, we can afterwards…! But first, let’s take one of everyone in the Service Club.” <br> Isshiki firmly refused with a smile and stretched her hand out to Yuigahama. She might’ve been acting considerate in her own way. Realizing her intentions, Yuigahama handed over the camera. <br> ... <br> There were several flashes of light in conjunction with the sound of the snapping shutter. Ahh, I definitely made a funny face… It definitely had to look like those coming-of-age pictures… <br> As I sat there feeling dejected, Isshiki approached me and handed back my smartphone. <br> “Here you go, senpai… It’s a good picture,” Isshiki said, wearing a slightly mature smile. <br> I didn’t bother trying to ask what she meant since I was sure she meant exactly what she said. <br><br>This made me become Irohafag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not with that glorious body</br>  <br>No, they just don't know that a japanese school year goes from april to march. Yukino is 5 months younger than 8man, and just 3 months older than Iroha. Yui is 2 months older than 8man.</br>  <br> “You don’t need to be concerned for him.” <br> Isshiki was then interrupted by Yukinoshita. She smoothly lifted her hair and wore a composed smile while Isshiki’s mouth hung open in contrast. <br> “Huh…? Don’t tell me, Yukinoshita-senpai, you’re going to—“ <br><br>Well she definitely has her suspicions about it I'll give you that. Smart way of doing it too since YY get's really hostile when anybody outside the club gets involved.</br></br></br></br></br>  Hayato is Hachiman's best friend<br>Prove me wrong</br>  Drink water  <br> Yuigahama tapped her hands. “Oh, but hey, Hikki seems like he’d be compatible with an older girl, for sure…! I think, definitely.” <br> She squeezed her fist, putting a lot of strength into it. But I certainly didn’t have that obsession, yes. <br> “…That’s not really applicable here. If we’re talking about a year gap, it’s not that big of a difference.” <br><br>Being Yui is suffering</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably not at the moment, but will be in the end.</br>  <br> A socially akward loner is able to get three top tier girls interested in him <br>How can some people call this realistic is beyond me.<br> inb4 I was 8man in highschool <br>Yeah, right.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Ebina's dream come true.</br>  <br>He's socially awkward but he's actually moderately good looking,  aside from his eyes which are Yukino's fetish. </br>  <br>You don't read it for its adherence to common social situations. You read it for the exaggerated interactions and decent monologues, and then try to guess the direction the story will take.<br><br>That, and  shipping wars </br></br></br>  <br>Yukino and Yui are betamax prime</br>  <br>So if Iroha was born a month earlier she would've been in the same year as them? Damn</br>  <br> Implying looks alone will get you anywhere as a guy unless you look like a God <br>And even then it won't be that easy.</br></br>  <br>TL this new Irohasu~, please.</br>  <br>Poor Yui</br>  <br>Why does /a/ hate him?<br><br>I WISH popular guys in highschool had been as nice as this guy.<br><br>I hate him, but I find it hard to truly hate him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>how can any anime girl not get wet from this.</br>  <br>Alpha and beta doesn't apply to females.</br>  <br>because <br>1) He had a past with Yukino, Yukinofags hate him<br>2) Iroha confessed to him, Irohafags hate him<br>3) Yuifags don't exist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> “You don’t need to be concerned for him.” <br>What a colossal bitch. She cockblocks other girls while she doesn't have any guts to act herself. Worst girl right there.</br></br>  <br>She was just bringing up his whole loner schtick before he did.</br>  <br><br> “I guess there’s no helping you. In that case…” <br> “You don’t need to be concerned for him.” <br>Isshiki was then interrupted by Yukinoshita. &gt;She smoothly lifted her hair and wore a composed smile while Isshiki’s mouth hung open in contrast.<br> “Huh…? Don’t tell me, Yukinoshita-senpai, you’re going to—“ <br> Yukinoshita didn’t let her finish speaking and softly chuckled. “Because Hikigaya-kun doesn’t have any friends he could compete with.” <br><br>It looked more like a dickmove to cocblock Iroha who was going to say she was going to give him giri chocos</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking censor that shit, anon<br>It makes my  heart  go  doki-doki </br></br>  <br>Yukino is also an autistic loner and Yui is a nice girl<br><br>I don't even know what the fuck Iroha's deal is though</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe that's the reason.<br><br>Y-yuifag reporting.</br></br></br>  <br> 9man is Eggman </br>  Is bareback genuine?  <br>one of the girls developed a silly crush after he saved her dog and later on the story her feelings became deeper (she also has low self-esteem).<br><br>Another one of the girls is a clusterfuck of a mess. Before 8man and Yui, she didn't have anyone she could call "close to her" and at the moment she has no mind/will of her own. She is experiencing all these emotions for the 1st time and 8man is there for her.<br><br>The last girl was moved after she learned that her senpai, which she only thought of him as cold and somewhat jaded, wanted something genuine. It resonated with her because of how superficial she was and hence she got interested in him after that speech.<br><br>Last but not least, he is a sexy beast.<br><br>I'm not trying to justify how fictional this is, however, to call inconceivable is a little too much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 9man <br>Someone stop Hikigaya before he becomes 10man</br></br>  <br>8/8 would suck Hikki's MAX Coffee smelling dick</br>  Overly sweet coffee is absolutely disgusting.<br><br>It's much better to drink a cup of tea or coffee with little sugar in it.</br></br>  <br> she has no mind/will of her own <br>She has identity issues but I wouldn't go that far, or are you saying her feelings for 8man aren't genuine because then you're going into denialfag territory</br></br>  <br>I like sweet things<br>Maybe the bitterness of life got to you so you gave up on sweet things anon, don't be such a depressive autist</br></br>  <br>To assert that, she would have to separate her dependency issues and her feelings towards him, being careful not to mix the two.<br><br>Some progress has already been done in the memorandum, but I wonder if she's truly aware of what that entails.</br></br></br>  <br>It's still very up for debate how much of ehr feelings are "genuine" and how much of it is just dependency. It's still difficult to tell how strong her feelings even are, whether she's super in love with him or it's just a small crush that she's blowing way out of proportion because she's a sperg</br>  <br>I am not depressed in the slightest. I generally have my drinks with little to no sugar in them, for them being overly sweet ruins the taste in your mouth and you end up as more thirsty that before.</br>  <br>I too like my sweets, but seriously, bitter coffee is better.</br>  <br> Yukino is also an autistic loner <br>And also the school's beauty. It's really not the same thing at all.</br></br>  How will 8man be able to resist final form genuine Yukino? She's going to be moe and ice queen at the same time so she basically wins if that happens.  <br>Is that when the flirty banter turns into outright flirting? As a Yukinofag I'm hyped <br><br>Watch the other shitters who jumped ship jump back on when she does this, happens every time a girl goes through a tough time</br></br></br>  The MC of the last show you watched replaces 8man.<br><br>How does it change?</br></br>  <br>The last show I watched was the last episode of S2. Now what?</br>  <br>Keima's amazing knowledge of anime tropes will have them wet in seconds</br>  <br>Araragi Koyomi in Yahari? What is he gonna save? Yukino from her autism? <br><br>Premise doesn't change that much I suppose.</br></br></br>  <br>Haruno did say something like “You can’t call it something genuine… Those were your words, right?” Reference to when he talked to her over the phone regarding his crush on Orimoto as him forcing his desires onto her. If we actually believe Haruno, then possibly her feelings aren't genuine and just a crush like 8man did to Orimoto. Looks like she witnessed this before. That's not to say Haruno is right, but who knows, she might be.</br>  <br>S2's 8man replaces S1's 8man.</br>  <br> Gintoki in Yahari <br><br>Oh boy</br></br></br>  <br>And ends up with Chihiro ha </br>  <br>8man ignores the girls then reads manga all day</br>  <br>Well she called all 3 of them out during the chocolate making event for not being genuine as well and none of them were genuine at that point<br><br>anyways, i dont give a shit about what Haruno says because we all know Watari is going to make everyone "genuine" by the time the series wraps up. It just a matter of what genuine is for each character</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she could have cut the trio some slack and let them experience mediocrity for once in their lives. The quest to GENUINE could have resumed after the event, making for a pleasant memory for the future.</br>  <br>Nothing happens, just like S2 last episode.</br>  <br> MindBlown.indd </br>  How am I supposed to swallow all that drama during S1's finale when the next two episodes leaves Hachiman like if nothing happened? Also, what was with Yukino's reaction to during S1? She was ok with the things that happened, but that was definitely not the case when S2 happened and 8man confessed to Ebina. How much in between am I missing?  <br>You're missing all his monologues and a few parts that were skipped or brutally summarized. Also some other parts were done differently.<br><br>Point is, his fake confession to Ebina is a turning point because he ends up forcing status quo in Hayama's group, causing NON GENUINE relationships between them. In the LN he goes over and over this as the same thing actually happens to the club until GENUINE, only to happen again during after Christmas.<br><br>In all of this Yukino is mad because he always paints himself as the enemy and takes all the blame to solve problems, while she can't do shit. She basically was afraid things could go out of hand for 8man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the first time she ever saw him in action, that's also the time when Hachiman lied to keep Hayato's superficial relationship with his friends which Yukino or rather both of them hated, in contrast to when he verbally fucked Sagami just because he was telling the truth.</br>  Any koreanbro around for translating these?<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=38903010<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51327903</wbr></br></wbr></br>  What if Hayama and Yukinoshita actually liked eachother and/or were "a couple" (as much as kindergarteners could be), but they were forced to split because of Yukino being bullied?<br><br>It would explain their unusual animosity at a rumor about them (old wounds), as well set a direct connection between Hayama's Yukino-related guilt and his refusal to be romantic with anyone. It would give Yukino a trauma that would explain her pathological fear of acting on her desires, while also explaining why Haruno is so personally interested in Yukino's romantic feelings.<br><br>It would also serve as a pretty good setup for Miura since she's good enough at intimidation that she could probably handle the heat, unless her gap moe side gets in the way of that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino is a huge bitch. Next news at 11.<br> Just look at Yui's reaction, THAT was an actual worried reaction, not that shit she pulled. 8man only reacted that way because he's Yukino's bitch, and he felt guilty simply because she was angry with him, while he didn't even really know what he should felt guilty about. A lot of men are that much of a bitch with their wives/girlfriends. It's so damn unsightly. </br></br>  <br>He actually realized he fucked up right after the confession, when Yui grabbed his hand and realized he was lying to himself and to all things he (and Yukinoshita) believed in.</br>  <br> Hibiki in Yahari <br>Kung-fu Yukino might be interesting to see, I suppose.</br></br>  <br>It wouldn't explain the part where Haruno said "Yukino-chan didn't get chosen again"</br>  <br>Probably someone approached her in the past with the intention of being a genuine friend to her, but ended up getting jealous and leaving her.<br><br>Don't know if she was referring to Hayama or not there.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh</br>  Is it just me or did Haruno do a complete 180 in between seasons<br><br>It seems like at some point she went from being the mischievous and teasing, but still secretly caring older sister in S1, to actually just being a cunt in S2</br></br>  <br>That wouldn't explain her early hatred of Hayama</br>  <br>Nah, he felt bad only because of what sensei said in volume 6. All the other abstract shit is just pure conjecture on some fans's part, you'd have to ask Watari for a proper and complete answer. Just like with the 80% of this series.</br>  <br>Right now there's a 99% chance that their past is linked by an arranged marriage.<br><br>It would be cool if they surprised us otherwise tbh.</br></br></br>  <br> Right now there's a 99% chance that their past is linked by an arranged marriage. <br>You have to be retarded to believe this</br></br>  <br> 99% chance that their past is linked by an arranged marriage <br>Just how idiotic are you?</br></br>  <br> 99% chance <br> their past is linked by an arranged marriage <br>This is sarcastic right? Right?</br></br></br>  <br>Miho from GuP</br>  <br>Fucking this. Some people shouldn't be so full of themselves when they express their THEORIES and CONJECTURES about this series, and should just stick to  biasely  translating the LNs.</br>  <br>Without context the first one makes literally no fucking sense at all</br>  <br>World Conquest.</br>  <br> 99% chance <br> arranged marriage </br></br>  please dump your yaharu comocs  for the love of all that is GENUINE please translate even greentext is acceptable  <br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br>  <br>That was translated already</br>  <br>IP count increased faggot</br>  <br>where</br>  then please give link  <br><br><br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br></br></br>  If 8man puts his hair in Yukino's hair does that count as sex?  <br>No that's only if  the ahoge tangle. </br>  <br><br>samefag</br></br>  1  <br><br><br><br><br><br>samefag</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God I love that pic so much, I'd make it my phone wallpaper if it had a darker background.</br>  <br>2</br>  Posting best doujin  <br>This is the third time I've had to correct you.<br>Please pay more attention.</br></br>  <br>I disagree, the other one is better</br>  <br>Then you simply have objectively shit taste anon.</br>  <br>Thank you for spoilering that gross thing this time at least</br>  <br>That's your subjective opinion<br>and it's wrong</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if it's going to change at all</br>        <br><br><br><br>Is that supposed to be Rumi on 8man's shoulders? Then what's the 'take responsibility about'?<br><br>If it's not Rumi but 8man/Yukino's child, why is she calling him "Hachiman" instead of "dad"?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ahoge means it's daughter<br>Take responsibility: you know what it means</br></br>  <br><br>Is she like Bart Simpson? Calls her dad by his first name?</br></br>  <br>Translations, please.<br>I need that Iroha in my life.</br></br>  <br>She's a rebel who doesn't commit to society's rules, that's expected from 8man and Yukino's daughter</br>  <br>Just enough to rustle Japanese social norms of not calling your otosan otosan.</br>  <br>either he is on a date with rumi rumi and yukinon,or his daughter has no respect for fulltime househusband dad.</br>  <br>I like to think she just wants to be like her mother</br>  <br>That daughter is utter garbage since calling your parents by their name is extremely disrespectful in Japan</br>  <br>He name is Akino 3rd Yukinoshita daughter</br>  <br><br> Senpai, you call me sly all the time, but lately you're the one being sly, aren't you? <br> Huh? How? <br> Whenever I'm troubled you come to help, even if I didn't ask anything. What will the other girls think? <br> It's obvious that they'll be on alert. <br> So, what happens if you keep helping me? <br> Something scary would be requested. Also, you're getting too close. <br> Hmm. So you're helping me for an ulterior motive then. <br> Absolutely not! It's just an older brother passive skill! You're too close! Too close! <br> My japanese is actually pretty weak, so I might be completely off the mark. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I was drinking.<br><br> Senpai, you're always calling people sly, but recently you're the one being sly. <br> Huh? Why is that? <br><br> Senpai, what do you think of the person of opposite sex, coming to help when you're in trouble even though you didn't ask? <br> I'd be cautious of him, obviously. <br><br> Then, what if I helped you? <br>Iroha-chan's up<br> I'd be afraid of repayment <br> Also, you're close <br><br> Oh~ Then, does this mean that you have an ulterior motive for helping me? <br>Further up<br> No, no! It's just my automatic brother skill!! Close, close, close, close!!! <br><br><br><br>Don't sexualize Irohasu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The implication being that Yukino can't even generate an original daughter so she copy pasted a loli she met before.</br>  <br>That's completely wrong you git.</br>  Fuck all this drama, the only thing that Yui has to do to win the 8bowl is ask him out on a beach date (just the two of them) for their "someday date" (and no, that bullshit 3p date didn't count)  If 8man wants a peaceful solution to the love triangle why doesn't he confess to both of them separately and have sex with them separately? All he has to do is make sure they don't find out to continue it and if he gets caught he can always say it wasn't a serious relationship anyways. There, two girl friends and no drama.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aQ3<wbr>Xs86Io00</wbr>  [ ]</br>  If Yahari was written in Yukino's point of view what would be some notable changes?  <br>not genuine</br>  <br><br>Judging by her memorandum her every monologue will be utterly incomprehensible.</br></br>  <br>There would be no bad end. Nice boat is prevented by him blowing them off once they find out.<br><br><br>If he genuinely wants both and both of them are happy then why not?</br></br></br></br>  <br>  Haruno is written as a more malevolent character. <br> Washboard angst. <br> Hikkigaya-kun rants and praises. <br> Washboard angst. <br> Hayama bitching. <br> Washboard angst. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he would be lying to both, then lying again to save his ass<br>Threesome ending is terrible and you should feel ashamed for wanting it.</br></br>  is it a good idea to start reading the LN?  Iroha confirmed flat.<br><br>Feels good man.</br></br>  <br> Yui and Iroha are flat <br> Yui, Sensei and Saki are huge <br> The only girls who are average aren't even trying to get on the 8bowl <br>why</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want a threesome end. A threesome end would imply the girls know about the other one and are fine with it. I want dual secret GFs end. <br><br> Because he would be lying to both <br>Just because he is with one and the other it isn't lying by not telling them<br><br> then lying again to save his ass <br>It isn't lying, he will realize that the situation isn't salvageable so he'll go on his way rather than trying to cause them pain by attempting to revive something dead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a lot anon. Would you mind if I changed a few words to make it sound more natural?<br>I remember you're russian.</br></br>  <br>Isn't the average cup size in Japan like a B cup?
