[ Isn't it amazing? The best scene from Nichijou is also anime original. KyoAni truly knows how to put that extra bit of effort to make their adaptations truly unique and inspiring, you can literally feel how much they love their craft. Can other studios even compare? The answer is obviously not.<br><br>https://madokami.com/aqo99x.webm</br></br>  Thanks OP, it was nice watching that again.  Repeat after me<br>T Y B K A</br>  Is she the only Nichijou we're allowed to sexualize?  <br>NO<br>O<br>Don't sexualize any Nichijou.</br></br></br>  <br>T Y B K A</br>  How much do you think Kadokawa had to pay for the rights of the FIFA anthem in this scene?<br><br>https://madokami.com/ijpnw5.webm</br></br>  <br>She's literally made for sex though.</br>  All I want in life is a Karasu and Sakamoto figurines  <br>Feels bitter sweet that the manga had to end but it got a hell of an adaptation. That scene was pure warmth.</br>  https://madokami.com/3j7u8c.webm<br><br>https://madokami.com/9ld1p7.webm</br></br>  <br>Manga already ended? Saw the announcement but I thought it was going to go for at least another volume.</br>  Do you also do this to your pets, /a/?  <br>I love these scenes so much</br>  <br> abusing a cat </br>  <br>I do sometimes, but I'm not /a/, so don't take it against /a/.</br>  <br> best scene <br><br>Oh, please, it was a really corny "awww" moment. <br><br>I know standards aren't exactly high around here, but come on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The whole second season of NNB had several anime only parts, which fitted in perfectly and overall were even superior to the source material.</br>  https://u.pomf.io/jatbal.webm<br><br>Post more Nichi webms</br></br>  <br>The whole NNBR was a downgrade comparing to S1.<br>7/10 wouldn't watch again.</br></br>  <br> More Candy Store <br> More Konomi <br> More dank meme girl memes <br> Toned down lesbianism of Hotarun <br> More Iyashikei and more melancholic moments <br> Nattsun being even more best girl than she already was <br>Your taste is shit, m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off cancer.</br>  <br>Nichishit was a mistake and don't fits KyoAni style. OP is not allowed in KyoAni threads anymore.</br>  <br>Another example of a really really great adaptation. Definitely augmented the source material and the source material was already really great. Illya too now that I think about it. Studio's surprising me lately.</br>  <br>What's wrong can't handle all the arguments?</br>  <br>I think the best scene from nichijou was the cards part in the episode 17, the lack of dialogue made it very interesting. The same happened with the last episode of YrYr and it was really good too.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zIG<wbr>CK8rYCVg</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Not by the tail, but fuck yes.</br>  <br>Damn I thought the same. These scenes with no verbal dialogue are really good.<br> <br>I completely lost it when Mai started playing with the cat over the cards.</br></br></br>  <br>First this  was not me.<br><br><br> &gt;More Candy Store <br>More doesn't mean better, the little time she had in S1 was way better than the time she has in Repeat.<br> &gt;More Konomi <br>Who?<br> &gt;More dank meme girl memes <br>This is the only good thing about Repeat<br> &gt;Toned down lesbianism of Hotarun <br>I don't fucking care if a character is straight or gay<br> &gt;More Iyashikei and more melancholic moments <br>For me notting tops episode 4 S1<br> &gt;Nattsun being even more best girl than she already was <br> Nattsun <br> Best anything </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unironically arguing with a crossboarder newshit </br>  <br> More doesn't mean better, the little time she had in S1 was way better than the time she has in Repeat. <br>The Bike training and visiting ill Renge was easily on pair with everything from S1.<br><br> Who? <br>OK, I see your problem now, you didn't watch the show.<br><br> I don't fucking care if a character is straight or gay <br>It was pretty obnoxious, though, and made her character more unbelievable and one dimensional.<br><br> Nattsun <br> Best anything <br>She saved Renges innocence. She also clearly has the most developed social skills out of everyone and knows exactly how far she can go with teasing others and playing around and takes responsibility when it's necessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The two seasons were essentially identical in direction, production, writing, vibe, etc.<br>Protip: "S1 &gt; S2" is a common shitposting propaganda narrative on /a/ amongst moe-haters who have never watched NNB.</br></br>  <br> &gt;Who? <br> OK, I see your problem now, you didn't watch the show. <br>I mean, literally WHO, no that I don't know who she is.<br><br><br> amongst moe-haters <br>I'm not, if anything I watch only SoL, and I felt like Repeat wasn't as great as S1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  why is this now a Non Non Biyori thread? don't you have a thread already?  <br>Y'know, as I go through the manga volumes it becomes really clear how great a job Kyoani did with the adaptation.</br>  <br>I thought it was a mediocre scene.</br>  <br>Thank you KyoAni</br>  <br>You have no heart.</br>  <br>It was cheesy and stood out from the rest of the show.</br>  Unfunny shit with forced animation.  You know I fucking hate slice of life with a passion, and the only one I ever really enjoyed with Welcome to the NHK, but Nichijou was really good overall. <br><br>Shame Japan went  NUUUUUCLEAAAAR </br></br>  <br>You are dead inside.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;134047576 <br>Ironic shitposting is still shitposting, it only encourages what it tries to make fun of.</br>  Why is this common knowledge among anime girls?  <br> "S1 &gt; S2" is a common shitposting propaganda narrative on /a/ amongst moe-haters who have never watched NNB. <br><br>Why would they compare the seasons then? Season 2 had a lot of good parts, but it was also annoying how they overplayed renge's reaction to everything and went for far more "wacky" humor the second season. For every dagashi/renge bike episode there were 2 or 3 fairly filler episodes.<br><br>LOL.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I am, it's a result of knowing what life is and that means I have a deep empathic ability which means you have no point.</br>  <br> Welcome to the NHK <br> Slice of Life <br>Just because the show takes place during a period of a person's life that doesn't make it SoL you know. NHK is driven primarily by plot and character development, it doesn't really fit the bill.</br></br></br>  <br> Amazing <br>Yes<br> Best scene from Nichijou <br>Thats debatable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's saddening.</br>  <br>Who doesn't know about this?</br>  <br><br>This though.<br><br><br>When was the last time you smiled anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shut up you faggot, you know goddamn well if you left your basement and went out on the street, and did that sign to someone they would think you were autistic, and not know what that is.</br>  <br>Life is.<br><br>I smile every day, what does that have to do with being happy?</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't it be allowed due to parody?</br>  <br>People smile when they are happy.</br>  <br>Old boy was a good movie</br>  <br>Get a load of Depressing Dan over here.</br>  <br>So what you're saying is that a slice of life, by definition, has no character development or plot? I thought that was just the worst kinds of slice of life.</br>  <br>No, that's not what I said at all. Please learn to read and to think.</br>  <br>You're right, what I do is laugh.<br><br>Let's stop with this shitty blog.<br><br>It's fucking amazing.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What I think he's saying is that a slice of life doesn't really have such a linear plot with a singular idea of conflict, a clear cut "end", etc.. Similar to how people think Haibane Renmei is SOL when it's not.</br>  <br>Im glad your not one of those shits that liked the horrible remake<br><br>I wish I could get into korean cinema</br></br></br>  Welcome to the NHK is a drama, not a Slice of Life.  <br>I like to pretend it doesn't exist.<br><br>Watch Memories of a Murder or one of the only two good vampire movie of the last years, Thirst (with the other one being Let the Right one In).</br></br></br>  <br>Ill look into them, thanks<br>probably going to be impossible to find a place to watch them</br></br>  IF IT DOESN'T HAVE CUTE GIRLS, I DON'T LIKE IT  <br>Best scenes.</br>  Some guy did a content aware scaling of the OPs from Lain and Haibane Renmei. Could a kind Anon do the same for the Nichijou OP? I feel like it would yield very interesting results.  <br>I'm not an expert, I only know Joon Ho Bong and Park Chan Wook. But they are great.</br>  <br>You can't say that without providing a link for at least one of them, anon.</br>  <br> KyoAni truly knows how to put that extra bit of effort to make their adaptations truly unique and inspiring <br>Shitty Chunbyo sequel tends to disagree.</br></br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/zdpuwxbyfc.web<wbr>m<br><br>My apologies, how could I be so stupid</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>what does that mean?</br>  <br>Impressive.<br>I would do it if I had a script to scale all the images.<br>Let me look a little into it.</br></br></br>  <br>And here's HR<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/jltichpozp.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>So content aware is basically just scaling up important things?</br>  I'm scared to rewatch Nichijou because it'll make me long for happier times.  <br>Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.<br>Now to find a way to batch this shit without having no idea how to batch shit in photoshop.</br></br>  <br>I did this back when deep dreaming was a thing.<br><br>https://a.pomf.cat/gavteu.webm</br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually watching it for my first time now. Great series, but I feel the same way about Cardcaptor Sakura.</br>  This is a KyoAni show?<br><br>It doesn't look like one. . .</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry you fell for the "all KyoAni shows are the same" shitposting.</br>  <br>Got it.<br>Now to download Nichijou again and rip the OP into images.</br></br>  <br>I dunno if we're thinking the same here but this might make it a little easier<br><br> download OP in .mp4 or something else and convert to .mp4 <br> in photoshop <br> file -&gt; import -&gt; video frames to layers <br><br>It'll still be time consuming but it's easier than taking individual screenshots.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I did the action based in opening and closing individual files, so that wouldn't work.<br>My plan is to extract all the frames with some program. Even  VLC  does it.</br></br>  <br>if you do the video import it includes the frames as animations as well if I recall correctly</br>  <br>Don't worry, I got it.<br>Can anyone experienced in audio editing deform the OP for me?</br></br>    <br>Potentially, but I don't know what would be appropriate/in sync.</br>  <br>Just reduce the audio quality and put some twists here and there just like the examples in this thread.</br>  <br>not him but here<br>https://madokami.com/9ah52r.mp3</br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll see what I can do</br>  <br><br><br>Does this produce better results than waifu2x?</br></br></br>  <br>That's going a little too far.<br><br><br>Does that really looks like a good result to you?<br>The purposes of content-aware scalling and waifu2x are completely different, though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Does that really looks like a good result to you? <br>I didn't realize that's what content aware scaling was.

It would make more sense.</br>  <br> Why is it impossible that nobody ended up asking her for a lewd favor? <br>It's not impossible, it's just stretching logic too much. It's way, way more likely for her to have ended up as a fucktoy for the boys in her class. Especially in a porn game where that shit happens all the time.<br><br>And the only reason that didn't happen is because she's a main girl and you have to appeal to the waifu faggots.<br><br><br>Yes. A girl who has to agree to everything you ask of her is great. You could base an entire hentai series on that concept and it was wasted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't say it's way more likely like you said. Could it feasibly happen? Yeah.
