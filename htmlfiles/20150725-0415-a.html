A whole episode of the various 346 idols doing silly shit or getting caught up in a crazy job is not outside the realm of possibility.

Would you cry anon?  I don't get it, did Mishirojou just force Kaede to retire and have a final concert?  <br>I would sniff my hand.</br>  <br> budget <br>their animators are virtually slaves</br></br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>z51h6</wbr>  <br> That's the same hand that shook Kaede's/Dookie's <br><br>I would as well</br></br></br>  <br>You understood japanese?</br>  <br>Kaede's wisdom and resolve would have been wasted if there wasn't anyone around to witness it. I really don't think it was an issue in this particular case.</br>  Akane getting frustrated was cute as fuck.  <br>mfw caketime</br>  Stepmother is unfortunately turning out to be a really one-dimensionally evil villain. <br>I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. <br>Just disappointed.</br></br>   D-doushiyou, why didn't my plan work? <br> I even called her a queen <br> I really thought putting all my chips into the most popular would work <br><br>Another week. Another failure<br>Ganbatte Moshiroujou!<br><br><br>She was offered to be queen but Kede turned her down apparently. Maybe.

We must protect her smile!</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br><br>What makes you think that</br></br>  <br>I dunnow. I'm thinking of all her as someone awkwardly bad at things. Sort of like a more stoic Reina-sama<br><br>She's not really doing that bad shit like what Kuroi pulls anyways.<br><br><br>forgot pic</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Their new costumes are cute as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br> Kaede episode <br> solo concert with Koi Kaze <br> Maple leaf shaped fans for the fans <br>at least they got this right<br><br> img captcha: cake </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Futaba thread?  <br>Sometimes I forget Sanae got her voice from the anime. Given all of her appearances, she seems like such a step above the rest of the characters who were the same.</br>  <br>They both went to the school of Egao. Dooky too will have an episode where she trains there with guest star curly deko-chan</br>  <br> She's not really doing that bad shit like what Kuroi pulls anyways. <br>Was he behind Harukas attempted murder?</br></br>  <br>The leaves help empahsize the wind and all. Sorta like what Tengu do.<br><br>That's really well thought out, honestly.</br></br></br>  I was honestly expecting this episode to go full drama but they handled things much better than expected.<br><br>For one thing, it seems that the restructuring isn't forced disbanding. All the umbrella projects are gone, but the currently functioning units will stay as they are (for the time being at least.) This may suck for newbies like Nao or Karen with their planned CD debuts being cancelled, but the currently running units have no problems at least for now.<br><br>Bit by bit, things within the company will change and the general opinion is that the Staff and Idols don't like it. And when Kaede was offered the premiere role, she rejected it as she liked her current status of being close to the fans. This episode was a declaration of war against Mishiro, that while she certainly does control 346, the lifeblood (i.e. the idols and staff) won't blindly let themselves be controlled.<br><br>The Cinderella Project girls cleaning up and prettying up the makeshift office was a nice Cinderella-esque touch too.<br><br>Unfortunately, this just means that Mishiro has learned that 346 won't bend to her will that easily. So she'll probably go full Wicked Stepmother soon. So throw your darts now on who she will attempt to destroy.<br><br>tl;dr <br><br>Plot Forwarding episode, Kaede is best cake and Mishiro will bring out the big suffering hammers soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I dunnow. I'm thinking of all her as someone awkwardly bad at things. Sort of like a more stoic Reina-sama <br>Probably. But so far she hasn't shown anything supporting that. Just say unreasonable things that anyone with a heart could easily counter. I wouldn't be surprised if along the way the idols have to tell her why friendship is important.</br></br>  <br>http://may.2chan.net/b/res/34608263<wbr>9.htm<br> You should be able to do this for yourself now. </br></wbr></br>  <br> maximizing profits and share price <br> minimizing costs and redundant overhead <br> giving the (in universe) fans what they want <br><br>MishirOujo is the ProducerGeneral we need, but don't deserve<br> needs more EGAO tho </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck.<br><br>Uzuki is gonna get destroyed isn't she? Not even Haruka triggered suffering flags this quick.</br></br>  <br>Leaving any of the idols besides Azusa alone int the foggy mountains would have a good chance of making sure they either never come back or die.</br>  <br> that sad Smile(ING) BGM arrange this ep </br>  <br>To be fair, she worked in goddamn New York.

Or is it Doris now?</br>  Why are they even featuring the other girls in the OP and such?<br>It´s clear they only care for NG.</br>  <br>Housewife Laika is best CP unit</br>  <br><br> Coming home to LL  <br><br>Minami looks really cute there too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> minimizing costs and redundant overhead <br>exactly what 346 needs. Their operation are too wasteful, In house spas included. <br>No idea about the state of financials of the company but this sort of profligate behavior can't be good in the long run. Cleaning house would be good before committing to new projects.</br></br></br>  <br>Man, I really felt that this episode.<br>Everyone is really feeling like non characters besides NG and maybe * at this point.<br><br>And that scene at the end where they all gave one-liners, as if just to remind us what their quirks all are again was pathetic.</br></br></br></br>  Daisuki is Up  <br>We still love you Verty.

Really? It's like you didn't even read the fucking fairy tale your basing your analogy on.

Stop being whitewashed by Disney.<br><br>Being a princess meant that she was a heir for a monarchy. This isn't necessarily the case.

Slaughter them all.</br></br></br></br>  I thought she was schizophrenic  <br>It's the endless question with anything zombie related, how could they blind-side everyone during the outbreak.<br><br>In this particular case, a single zombie making its way in a locker room full of unsuspecting students is enough to get them all.<br>There weren't that many people on the tracks, mostly zombies, so it might just be the injured runaways we see getting finished off.<br><br>Also the number 1 trope about zombie movies being that nobody knows shit about zombies, they could get bitten by the injured people they were carrying., or while trying to fight them back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boy the first episode really took its time playing with the mascarade that everything's fine.<br>The manga keeps it short and sweet so we actually get a surprise, but this was drawn out to hell with the dog bullshit.<br><br>Also I don't know how I feel about Lesbian being here from day 1.<br>Did they think it'd be too boring with a group of only 4  hue  people?<br>Is this just a lazy way to not have to draw the mall segment and keep it in school as much as possible?<br><br>Still pretty nice</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was so they don't introduce a new main character mid-season.<br><br>They're going to flashback to the mall thing instead. Her friend is in the OP and everything.</br></br></br>  <br>For a filthy secondary who went in knowing nothing about the series, the first ep was pretty good for me.<br>I thought it was a really boring show that I was going to drop until the last few minutes, then I was "wait what"</br></br>  <br>you're implying people didn't just manage to leave the school<br><br>also it's implied first wave zombie virus was able to spread through other means</br></br></br>  <br> Anon why don't you watch this SoL, you like cute girls doing cute things right? </br>  <br>Even if you could escape from school, you're still surrounded by zombies all around in the town/city/country. You're fucked either way. Once you take away our social organization and our infrastructure, humans are literally naked monkeys.</br>  It's been a while since I haven't been spooked by an anime, in this last episode I thought that  we would see Megu-nee getting horribly chewed up right away, so I was anticipating the scene in horror   <br>At least the dog chasing scene provided us with hints that something is not 'right', so it's actually not pointless.<br>Well, I admit that the scene is a bit dragged out, but I have no problem with it.</br></br>  <br>If the anime keeps its rythm, we should get camping next episode,  then after that they'll start dropping heavy hints about Megu-nee </br>  <br>The sheer amount of different hints is actually kind of impressive.<br><br>It's also kind of hilarious though how many of them can be dismissed as "because it's moe anime"</br></br></br>   why didn't xyz <br>It's fucking zombies. You will always have to suspend your disbelief because they were never a good concept to start with.</br>  <br>But we've seen that zombies are pretty lethargic from the get go. See when Megu-nee watches that video on her phone the undead folk are moving pretty slowly.<br><br>It is beyond me how they got rekt like that. A fucking Ayaya runs around with a shovel killing zombies, surely police or jsdf could do something about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Only "virus infected" zombies aren't a good concept. The really real undead ones are.</br>  Just read a bit of the manga<br> Holy fuck, the dog was fake too? </br>  <br>He's alive in the anime. For now.</br>  <br>No, it's real.</br>  <br>But the dog is  dead  no?</br>  <br>It's dead in the manga but not in the anime. We'll see how it goes.</br>  <br>We got camping this episode, though. Next episode will be about Kei apparently</br>  <br>Nope, he's in a flashback right after Lesbian joins the school-life club.<br> He's already bitten when they find him, so he doesn't stick around long. Megu-nee uses him to study the transformation. <br>He'll probably go down the same road.<br><br>It's hardly a spoiler since such is the fate of dogs in anything zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>School Slice of Life nowadays stands for Taking the Lives of Schoolgirls One Slice at a Time. Those tags make me prepare for the worst.</br>  <br>Really? Most dogs I've seen just fucks off off screen once shit hits the fan, and conveniently have zombies ignore animals.<br><br> At the same time I can't even remember the names of those movies, so they had to have been terrible. </br></br></br>  Why is Kurumi being scared so damn boner inducing?  <br>Perhaps they just think there's something wrong and get too close trying to help before its too late.</br>  <br>Senpai please.</br>  <br>RAAAAAAAAAAAAPE</br>  If zombies end up going where they remember/count as important, wouldn't a secret hideout be ideal?  <br>She's boner inducing either way.</br>  <br>I, for one, am happy that good fanart of her finally arrives.</br>  <br>I love this face.<br><br>The face of absolute  confusion .</br></br></br>  <br>You know, speaking of the outbreak this episode, just how long is the incubation period supposed to be? People were turning right away here, but Kurumi held out all night until Miki got back.</br>  <br>Seems to be different for different people.</br>  <br>Sensei and that one guy at the mall held out pretty long, maybe it happens based on how much blood they lost?</br>  Shovel is the best action hero.  Why is Yuki so shit? She ruined the whole episode.  Enough with the fucking GG generals  <br>Well, Megu-nee was surrounded by zombies and likely bitten more than once, same with most other people during the inital outbreak, at least I assume, considering how nobody knew what was really going on.</br>  <br>might be different for each person<br>nastier wounds might accelerate the process<br> People were turning right away here <br>you don't know about that</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The more cute you are the more time it takes.</br></br>  <br>So Kurumi is immune after all?</br>  <br>This is my favorite so far.<br><br><br>Quiet, Yuki is a good girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi's senpai turned within minutes.</br>  <br>I want to rape Kurumi!<br><br>And I want to be raped by her.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you take in the time it takes to get in the building and climb all the way up the stairs?</br>  So, do we know yet if Shovel has become Alice from Resident Evil?  <br>If you stick your dick into a zombie, will you become a zombie as well?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  So after reading the manga.  It's pretty clear that Kurumi's going to die. The only questions are when and where.   Too bad about the censor.  <br><br>Yeah, the guy in the mall lasted maybe half a day between the initial bite and then turning in his sleep.</br></br>  <br> Sudoku in order to prevent the others from having to kill her. </br>  <br>What about watching her get raped?<br><br>http://nijie.info/view.php?id=98357<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Then why didn't she turn immediately?</br>  <br>Not entirely. She gets the Dreaded Japanese Cold instead of turning.</br>  <br>Obviously because you have shit taste.</br>  <br>I'm never going to understand people who think that all currently unresolved problems in a story will just continue indefinitely and never be solved.</br>  <br>It's using typical zombie tropes and ignoring biology. The infection takes about 12 hours to kill you and bring you back as a zed, but if you die during the incubation period for any reason you also immediately come back as a zombie.</br>  <br>Careful not cutting yourself with all this edge</br>  <br>Future Dead Characters.jpg</br>  <br>Senpai didn't die.</br>  <br>Why do zeds want to kill people anyway?</br>  <br>So all she needs now is some chicken soup and good night's rest?</br>  How are the Gurashis ranked in terms of popularity?  <br>Especially since it's not uncommon in a story like this that the person in the clearly most vulnerable position will actually come out fine.</br>  <br>It wasn't actually that long, Lesbian went down there as soon as she came back and didn't take very long.<br> The night was tensed because we didn't know if it worked. <br>Being apparently virus based, it's bound by physiology.<br>If it's a small wound that's immediately treated, it'll take a while to kick in, whereas it'll act much faster one someone with multiple or deep bites. Or dead with no immune system to fight.<br><br>On that note, it seems there is a period after the virus takes over where they are still alive and can recover or do stuff through sheer will,  like when Megu-nee went down to the basement. <br>It's also possibly the period where they are the most agile and dangerous.<br><br>Guys remember anime watchers are lurking so spoiler your shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he did. He died of his wounds and immediately turned. Or do you expect me to believe that the infection killed him in less than 20 mins?</br>  <br> I'm hungry but <br> I'M HUNGRY BUT </br></br>  <br>In Japan?<br>Yuki &gt;&gt; Kurumi &gt;&gt; Miki &gt; Rii &gt; Megu-nee</br></br>  <br>Given that's what the scene showed, yes.</br>  <br>Japan shit taste confirmed yet again</br>  <br>Source?<br>Didn't think so</br></br>  <br>Fucking hyped for this scene <br><br> I LOVE YOU. WHY DON'T YOU OPEN THE DOOR? </br></br></br>  <br>The virus wants to spread.</br>  <br> Not using Slice off Life <br> missed opportunity </br></br>  <br>So many zombie rape doujins</br>  <br>Then why don't you find your own sources, asshole? I guarantee you'll get the same results. But of course you won't you lazy fuck.</br>  <br>He was unresponsive until he turned so he was probably dead.</br>  <br>I dun fucked up. Sorry.</br>  <br>Fanart is overwhelmingly of Yuki and Kurumi</br>  <br>my god thats worse than the zombie virus</br>    <br>There didn't seem to be too much blood loss, unless he stained half the school red while they were getting to the roof.</br>   playing video games in the middle of a zombie apocalypse <br><br>Living the dream</br></br>  <br>Where the scans at?</br>  <br>Have the uni girls eaten and/or raped them yet?</br>  Why is Mii-kun there from the start?  <br>Now this is what I've been waiting for.</br>   mfw reading about megu nee <br> mfw how kind she is <br> mfw all the predicament <br><br>i need a vodka</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only at fighting games, it seems.</br>   I should have expected a incompetent helicopter pilot, these fucks ALWAYS have to appear in anything zombie related.   <br>I dont know, i'm just following a random nip's twitter account. He usually uploads pics that we'll never see scanned.<br><br>Pic related</br></br></br>  <br>when are they gonna start killing humans</br>  <br> remote strapped to controller <br>She a badass progamer</br></br>  <br> Actually he did the right thing given his situation. </br>  <br>   I should have expected an infected helicopter pilot <br><br>There you go</br></br></br>  can someone tell me wtf that helicopter pilot was doing.  <br>Them getting all friendly with the uni girls isn't a good sign. Something's going to go down soon enough for them with those uni girls.</br>  <br>That's a default control scheme for Splatoon.</br>  <br>Someone post that picture explaining the helicopter part for blind people</br>  I'd share my hard tack with them.  <br>The implication was that he was infected and that the infection requires regular injections to keep controlled instead of just being cured with one shot</br>  <br>Crashing, evidently.</br>  <br> He lost/was losing control of his body due to the virus. </br>  <br>That Mi-kun though<br> why are all my senpais such bakas </br></br>  <br><br> He's still incompetent because he should've stayed his ass on land if he was infected. </br></br>    <br>Crashing the helicopter with no survivors.</br>  <br> With no survivors. </br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Good enough for me.<br>pls share</br></br>  <br>I bet that's exactly what the author want's you to think while nothing ever happens and they keep doing SoL antics with the occasional shit going down.</br>  <br>Someone get this cathead out of here</br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br> Maybe Randall CO. was sending infected pilots out to prevent healthy pilots from getting infected, maybe he was the only pilot available and they had no choice, maybe he was trying to keep the fact he was infected secret and had to keep doing his job in the meantime <br><br>There's a ton of possible explainations if you think just a little bit</br></br></br>  <br>Does it show any indication of what they're actually playing? It'd be amazing if they were actually playing Splatoon.</br>  I don't mind fanservice at all, but that was just ridiculous. Why didn't she show up straight in her pantsu.  <br>You're a squid<br>Now you're a dead</br></br>  <br>They're called bloomers</br>  <br>Your first two explanations just end up marking multiple people as such. <br><br>And your last explanation just makes him seem even more retarded assuming he has a clear understanding as to what's going on.</br></br></br>  <br>That'd be nice, but for how long do you think they could stay at uni then? They did stay at the school for a good while, but they had to eventually move out. The uni girls and the guys, who were chasing them before, could be a good enough reason to progress the plot further and make them quickly "graduate" uni.</br>  <br>If you're fine for 2 weeks until you need another dose of serum, there's not really that much of a risk sending infected people out. There was only a problem because he relapsed then and there.</br>  <br>Aren't those bloomers<br><br><br>We don't know how the "cure" works.<br>If Shovel's foreshadowing is to be believed, we might be dealing with a Zombrex situation.<br>In that case, the pilot could have run out of doses and tried to get back home or not realize he was at his limit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>worst*</br>  <br>The mangaka does play splatoon so it could be a direct reference</br>  <br>Words of wisdom.</br>  <br>The uni girls have been introduced pretty ominously, shit is going to go down one way or the other.<br>They may be cannon fodder so we can have our quota of death without hurting the core roster, or they could be planning something sinister like using the girls.</br></br>  <br> I love you why why wont you open the door <br> No this isnt what i should be doing im hungry but.. <br><br> I wonder if i'll ever see them again. <br><br>im not ready for the anime to reach this scene....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What dastardly things is she planning now</br>  <br><br><br>We aren't in the 80s, nobody would wear such short panties nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>How dare they rank Rii in anything but last place.</br>  <br>They're going to formally introduce the concept of half-zombies.</br>  <br>Why is there such a distance between Yuki/Kurumi and Miki?</br>  <br>And yet 90% of anime still have them.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Y'know, because it's an university here, there are various kinds of guys here." </br>  <br>I still dont understand why there's no copilot.<br><br>plothole?</br></br></br>  <br>Or further evidence that they're severely low on manpower.</br>  <br>Kurumi and especially Yuki were the poster girls for the anime. They had people cosplaying the two girls at events and whatnot. They've also had the most screentime and development in the anime, and in my opinion, are the most interesting characters both personality and design-wise. But yeah, Kurumi has double the amount of fanart as Miki does on Pixiv.</br>  <br>He just wanted the naked lolis all to himself.</br>  reading the manga was a mistake<br>now im depresed<br>i just want cute girls doing cute things with megu nee ;_;</br></br>  which girl is gonna score the first non zombie kill  <br> Megu-nee already did. </br>  <br>i just wish there were more chapters out</br>  <br>I was gonna say Kurumi but maybe Rii is going to do it and it'll take her over the edge from broken to shattered.</br>    <br>wouldnt mind if Yuki is first to cap a motherfucker</br>  <br> Sweat drop on his helmet </br>  Imagine if pilot-kun was fapping when that unfortunate relapse happened  <br>"What the hell did I just fap to?"</br>  <br>Holy shit it all makes sense now. The chopper went out of control because he was fapping to the thought of a naked lli paradise.</br>    <br> wouldnt mind <br>I want this to happen.</br></br>  <br> Sees clothed high school girls instead of the naked loli paradise he was promised <br> Gets so mad he crushes the message, his medicine and crashes his helicopter in a kamikaze move </br></br>  <br><br>Any girl is likely to kill someone at this point.</br></br>  <br>Turns out she picked up the gun Miki threw away and has been keeping it ever since</br>  <br>picked up the gun that mi-kun threw away<br>caps those no good delinquents</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how it would turn out now that she's not delusional. Would she break down like the time with the zombie? Maybe she can keep her feelings at bay until they get to safety before it dawns on her what she really did. And maybe she'll completely break and revert to an extreme delusional state where she smiles and waves at her friends in the club while still covered in his fresh warm blood.</br></br>  <br>We were wrong the whole time. Someone should edit that image for blind people to reflect this new profound knowledge.</br>  P O S T <br>P T H E<br>O T R A W S<br>S H A<br>T E W <br> S</br></br></br></br></br>  Kurumi please my boner  <br><br>helmet dudes kills one of the crew. Yuki becomes full edge and start maniacally laughing as she executes them</br></br>  <br>I want her to bite me with that fang.</br>  <br>After the rooftop scene establishing it as unacceptable, I doubt any of the main cast will.</br>  <br> Post pthe otraws sha tew s <br>Poor Anon has run out of serum ;_;7</br></br>  <br>they talkin bout the manga dude its obviously gonna happen soon</br>  I actually like her character but I wish she would wake up and smell the cheese already, It would be better seeing her cope with what's actually going on instead of this rainbow land she's placed herself in.  <br>She has short moments of clarity and PTSD fits, be patient.<br>They are becoming more and more frequent</br></br>    <br>I'm pretty clearly also talking about the manga given that the scene with the gun is months away in the anime, and also stop writing like a retard.</br>  <br>And all that goes out the window when one of your best friends is about to be killed.</br>  <br>That was probably just one of her bullies</br>  <br>Oi, lelouch, Fuck off</br>  <br>Fuck I can't believe I just noticed her hat fell off when she snapped out of it.</br>  <br>There are different strains of the virus. I'm guessing the outbreak at school was an airborne strain since people turned way to quickly and shut went down with minutes. People immune to the airborne virus then got turn through bites which have a different incubation period. Though if Senpai was bitten, then I'll accept that it could be different for different people.</br>  <br>does her hat always fall off when she flips her shit?</br>  <br/>  <br>Yuuri is best girl.</br>    <br>Her fucking hat is the source of delusions.</br>  <br>Someone is going to draw Rii's hair getting fucked one day.</br>    <br>I don't think I could bear to see that</br>  <br>The one time she was wearing it was in a dream.</br>  <br>I must be delusional from sleepiness because I laughed at this stupid thing for 15 seconds straight.</br>  <br>Yes please, hair fetish is a great thing.</br>  <br>tis but a ruse</br>  <br>Not enough hair fetish doujins have hair brushing scenes</br>  <br>looks like shes a mad hatter. To much mercury on her hat</br>  <br>So beautiful</br>  <br/>  Everything will not be fine isn't it?  <br>everything will be diejoubu</br>   The anime will end right before the road trip <br> S2 never </br>  Is there something Yuki doesn't love?  <br> die <br>oh god</br></br>  <br>Bullies and facial hair.</br>  <br>Losing Shovel.</br>  <br>A season 2 would need another 30 chapters or so to adapt. Given the current pace of 12 chapters a year, we'd have enough material in less than two years.</br>  <br>Man I remember the threads back then<br> NO YUKI YOU DUMB SLUT </br></br>    <br>Are those really their eyes or is it a bullshit purikura filter</br>  <br> makeup </br>  It's disturbing to see how Kurumi loves her "Senpai".<br><br>She shall never have such attachment for me who is a disgusting nerd, and far from jocks like "Senpai".<br>Actually, nobody on the earth will love me like that, being lovesick and talking about that with her sensei.<br>I can never be a "Senpai", who is loved by a cute kouhai like Kurumi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just buy a shovel and keep it in your bed.<br><br>Your imagination is all you need.</br></br></br>    <br>Make yourself the jock she'd want you to be, poor nerd. Getting in shape isn't that hard, you just need a little dedication.</br>  <br>Well she's dead/dying anyway</br>  <br>SHOVEL AYAYA IS FINE<br>SHE WON'T DIE</br></br>  <br>Maybe you can identify with her instead, who likes attractive people she'll never have?</br>  <br>10/10</br>   Doujin of Kurumi getting gang raped by zombies never <br> Zombies' cum infected Kurumi made her futa </br>      <br>I want to practice with her all night long.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Aren't they just running shorts?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Practice what?</br>  <br>Gymnastics. I'm going to make her an Olympic medalist.</br>  <br>SHOVEL JUSTICE.</br>  <br>I don't think she would be interested in that.</br>    <br>What do you mean? It's the most effective way for her to stay in shape. Plus the extra flexibility will give her better handling of the shovel.</br>  <br>It'd be useless since she's gonna go  rigid  soon.</br>  Reminder Megu let all her students be eaten right behind the door.  <br>Well that explains why only 4 people survived.</br>  <br>I bet Megu was the one who bit Senpai and turned him into a zombie too.<br><br>i'm glad she's dead.</br></br></br>  <br>She did the right thing. I still wonder who the other girl was though.</br>  <br> right thing <br>Depends, if they were all running there cornered then I say she didn't do the best choice, if they had zombies mixed in then maybe it was.</br></br>  <br> I'm just pretending to have PTSD </br>  <br> Left to Right </br>  <br>Chances are at least one of them were infected. So it's either save three girls now or be responsible for the death of a dozen people later.</br>  <br>There's a movie that has a scene like that. I think it's called contracted</br>  <br>Otaku are dumb. They don't want to be the little girl, they want to fuck the little girl.</br>  <br>As long as she isn't  frigid .</br>    <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The students were pobably getting assaulted by the zombies, opening the door may have let infected people or zombies get on the roof, leaving the Gurashis trapped.<br>Megu-nee did what she could, and that's saving those three girls and herself. If the principal wasn't a fucking selfish, incompetent idiot, then he would have started evacuating the teachers and pupils to the shelter and everything would have been fine.<br>Scratch that, even the fucking shelter was only designed for 15 people. They were all fucked from the start, Megu-nee did nothing wrong.</br></br></br>    <br>Shelter was obviously just for the staff but the principle was a pussy and went there alone it seemed. Then hung himself out of guilt.</br>  <br>Where is she putting that shovel?</br>  <br>You know these threads isn't have bad if you imagine that these OPs have autism.</br>  <br>Not you again. Are you so sad that there are not Shirobako threads at the moment?</br>  What if Yuki was a zambooble the whole time?    I think I'll pick this up, seems kind of Higurashi-like.  <br> Ruu is the only one who's real </br>  <br>It wasn't the whole time. She got bitten when she accidentally went home.<br><br>She ate all her friends because she loved them so much.</br></br></br>  <br>It really isn't, aside from the contrast cute things / horror which is hardly rare<br>You still should</br></br>  <br>They can't all be imaginary.</br>  <br>I can't look her the same since she didn't brush her teeth in the first ep. I'm convinced that I can smell her.</br>  <br>They might become "imaginary" eventually in anime-original end.</br>  <br>I knew this zombie apocalypse slice of life was missing something!</br>    <br>You forgot that the gate is already broken down.<br>Wonder what the reason for them going to the mall was in the anime? I mean, the school store still has supplies.</br></br>  <br>Rii's voice in that moment was so perfect.</br>  Post more dog.  So how the fuck do some dumb slow-ass corpses cause an apocalypse?  <br>The same way they do in every apocalypse. Somehow.</br>  <br> the school store still has supplies <br><br>Don't they only eat udon and hardtacks because they run out of everything else?</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder about that too. Also, will Megu-nee go with them? <br><br>If she doesn't, how will they cover her not driving the car without revealing she's already dead?</br></br></br>  <br>Panic, lack of medical preparation, hiding bites, and people usually grouping together in enclosed areas.</br>  <br>1) they aren't always slow<br>2) surprise effect<br>3) high density of population in japan<br>4) zombies following their pre-death travelling patterns, rather than staying in one place</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the zombies that cause it, it's the humans that react to them. They see some dead fucker in the street and panic the fuck out until they crash into a gas station. You also have the paranoid fucks that think some people are infected when they really aren't. Also, the government quarantines and cleansings will often target protagonists, so that's bad too. Overreactive government leaders are tempted to nuke the shit out of a country as well, only to find out that the disease has spread throughout the world.</br>  Left or right?  Right gives better anal.<br><br>It's asanee right?</br></br>  That fugly orange/yellow vertical stripes.  <br>Neither.</br>  Necrophilia is my thing, so both.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128513679   <br>animeonlyfag<br>Leone doesn't die in the manga, yet.</br></br>  <br>Both are garbage Akame and her sister are the only decent girls in the series.</br>  <br>both are dead so it doesn't really matter.<br>I'd choose left because you can put you dick down her throat.</br></br>  <br>The not dead one.</br>  <br>Right because best body</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Jesus fuck no Kurome is an annoying little nuisance that I wanted dead since the moment I saw her.

The first 10 seconds?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Never touched this anime. Feels good.  <br>It also made me cringe</br>  <br>The first half of S1 was  fun . Anything beyond that is not even enough bad to be laughable.</br>  <br>I cant wait for Alicization.<br><br>2016 cant come fast enough.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I though I was going to watch a generic yet entertaining fantasy tale about Kirito improving his abilities, forming a party, slaying all kinds of players and monsters and becoming a hero. I got nothing like that.</br>  <br>Chills no but it was decent, as well as the first half of S1. Overall the series is still utter shit.</br>  <br><br>Both of these.</br></br>  <br>Hell no<br>It's just generic shounen to be honest</br></br>  First episode was pretty good, but i kept getting worse until this happened.  It got shit the moment they introduced Asuna and the focus shifted from generic adventure &amp; battle to one of the most heavy handed wish fulfillment romances in all of anime.  The first episode was really well done. It was like watching a movie.<br>The second was good.<br><br>Everything after was really really bad. I don't get really get why everyone says season 1 was good. I gave up on this shit at the middle of episode 4 after struggling to get through episode 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes but that was also back when I used  streaming  so my past opinion is invalid.</br>  13 hours of my life I'm never getting back. Nothing will convince me to watch S2.  <br>Only way I was able to tolerate this shit was by grinding in an MMO while watching it on another monitor.</br>  <br>The last arc has Kirito sidelined and focuses on Asuna and a new girl.<br>Coincidentally it was the only time SAO could actually be called "good".</br></br>  <br> focuses on Asuna <br> good <br>Yeah, nice try</br></br></br>  <br>It was actually worse than the second half of the first season.<br>The excalibur arc was the only good arc that SAO had.</br></br>  <br> even replying to bait <br>He won.</br></br>  I felt it was average since the concept of being trapped in a MMO isn't exactly new. Were people blown away because they didn't watch .Hack or something?  <br>She is also 80% less Kirito dere and not a damsel in distress, which makes her a lot more tolerable. Though, what made the arc enjoyable was Yuuki.</br>  Is it true that SAO and  Accel World  are on the same timeline or is that just speculation?  <br>running like a retard with a knife sure gives me a thrill...</br>  <br>I couldn't shake off that feeling of the directors just throwing in Norse mythology without a care just to seem cool. Of course, Kirito being the special guy in the entire world who gets Excalibur didn't help either.<br>I'd say GGO was easily the worst. All that hamfisted PTSD drama and a third of the arc spent in a cave was just unbearable. It felt so drawn out. At least Sinon was cute.</br></br>  <br>I figured it would be .hack for newfags. I was so wrong when I actually came around to watching that.</br>  <br>Yes, doesn't make it any less shit though</br>  <br>I remember when I first saw this first episode and the opening,thinking Asuna would be Kirito's equal in character development and partnership fighting, What a got was pure garbage to me and apparently gold for others. This world is very mysterious.</br>  Not particularly. The boss fights were better. <br><br>If the sidestory/romance shit was quarantined off in very obvious filler episodes with the dungeon exploration/bosses being the focal point SAO may have been closer to a 6/10 instead of a 3.<br><br>But then again Gary Stu would just murder everything and it would be boringly predictable. Any way you try to turn SAO it becomes worse, even by cherry-picking the first episode as "good."</br></br></br></br>  I'm fairly certain a lot of people considered SAO to have a really strong first episode back when that particular season had just begun.<br><br>So yeah, it had potential. But we all know now that the show went downhill and fell apart after that.</br></br>  <br> LUMBERJACK HYPE </br>  I enjoyed Sword Arts Online unironically.

Supports you in your fights. Encourages you to better yourself. Explains her intentions when they aren't understood. Doesn't try to take your thunder when she thinks you can handle something, even though not helping means she suffers more.

You're late.</br>  Rachnees Swimsuit - Cereas Swim Suit - Suus Suut  So what is Octopussy's secret intentions, /a/?  So Suu is getting smarter as time goes on, right? How long until shes the smartest person in the house?  <br>Either Mero's childhood friend. A while back Mero told her about her tragedy fantasies and now she's here to help her fulfill it or something<br><br>Most likely though just something similar to Miia, Scylla needs Mero for lewds/something else and she dislikes humans not just males.</br></br></br>  <br>What else? To get Darling for herself.</br>  Holy jesus Rachnera confirmed for best girl. <br> Even though she's always been that. </br>  <br>I am very ready for the best girl</br>  <br>Said no one ever.</br>  <br>I did, so silence fool.</br>  <br>I bet all her outfits are homemade.</br>  <br>I did.</br>  based<br><br>crab<br><br>man</br></br></br></br>  <br> best girl <br> but I'm disgusted by spiders </br></br>  who else is fucking hype for HAND PUSSY  <br> that cute expression of happiness when Darling asks her to catch more stingrays <br>It's nice to see her show real affection once in awhile.</br></br>  Reminder:<br><br>Dead = Bird &gt; Slime &gt; Snek &gt; Fish &gt; Spidey = Horse</br></br>  <br> disgusted <br><br>Why? Most people say afraid. They're not very disgusting. They're adorable or lovely most of the time, incredibly clean, and very very helpful to us as a species.</br></br></br>  <br>I know that feel, I'm the same way but with Miia/snakes</br>  <br>Agreed! Rachnee showing happiness and affection like that was just lovely! I want my own spiderwife, damnit!</br>  <br>Disgusted? No.<br>Afraid? Kinda agree there<br>But anon, just think about that sexy body and her  qt personality  and you'll ignore the spider parts pretty quickly.</br></br></br>    Best part of the chapter was Darling getting excited about helping with the cooking. I don't remember ever seeing him enjoying himself that much before. It really felt like we saw more personality from him than we have before.  <br><br>She's my current favorite. I'm gonna keep an eye out for the mermaid, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Rachnera a cute!<br><br>Cute!!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh we know anon.</br>  <br>Because... I do, I guess? The spiders where I live are not in any way dangerous, the worst they can do is build webs at face height, there's very little to be afraid of. On the other hand I find the way they move to be creepy, the way they look to be creepy, the way they eat to be creepy, and so on. Pretty disgusting.</br>  So... is Octopussy going to be a Bond-type villain or will this be some kind of Little Mermaid/Disney story where Mero is offered to grow legs?<br><br>I don't know, I'm just hoping there's going to be something about this kidnapping that gives Mero some char. development.</br></br>  <br>TOp Kek</br>  <br>Im leaning towards what some people have said that it'll end up being someone Mero knows trying to give her some tragedy that she loves so much. Her being offered legs would be interesting though, I could see her agreeing to it so she doesn't have to stay at home, only to have Darling save her and give a speech about being yourself.</br>  Daily dose.  <br>I want to stare at Rachnee's eyes until she blushes and yell at me to stop.</br>  <br>Don't we all?</br>  <br><br>hopefully something similar to this</br></br>  <br>That reminds me, none of the girls have ever actually made darling cum, right? I'm surprised he's held back considering the situations he's always in.</br>  You will never fuck a lamia while she tickles your prostate with her tail. You will never feel her long wet tongue wrap around your pusling cock. You will never orgasm while being strangled around the neck. You will never thrust into her tail; it coiled into a scaly onahole. You will never suck on a lamia's tail while fucking her throat, holding her head by her ears; her tongue wrapped around your balls. You will never press your member between a lamia's tits along with her tail, frotting and titfucking them both. You will never cuddle with her in the sunlight, warming her cold body with your own.  Poor murderfish got cheated out of a double kill by Suu arbitrarily running out.  <br>I want to look into her eyes until they start shining like small rubies.</br>  <br> Mero causes Suu's death <br> Darling and other girls forever pissed at her <br> She's forced to live at home <br>I wonder if that would be too much tragedy for her fetish.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would've been a double, Rachnee can't survive submersion either.</br>  Ramsey-Darling was fun  <br> 19372▶ <br> Reminder: <br> Dead = Bird &gt; Slime &gt; Snek &gt; Fish &gt; Spidey = Horse <br>Never has someone's opinion ever been so, so wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Never has someone's opinion ever been so, so right. <br><br>Fixed for accuracy</br></br></br>  <br>I wish the girls would have noticed how much happier he was right then compared to when they drag him into shenanigans. They don't really ever let him do things he wants to do.</br>  <br>New chapters out?</br>  <br>top grammer</br>  <br>Kill me please.</br>  <br>http://monmusu.prettyanonymo.us/</br>  <br> You will never make her smile <br><br>I can't keep going.</br></br></br>  <br>Sweet!</br>  <br> DuLALAhan </br>  <br> that deadpan <br> dem eyes <br> dat blush <br> that body <br><br>Best girl. Rest of them can go home</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you just want a human, why not Smith?</br>  <br> too many legs <br> TOO MANY LEGS </br></br>  <br>Figures that the most human looking would be best girl in a monster series..</br>  <br>Humans cant unattach their heads for lewd purposes, anon.</br>  <br> Ai Kakuma as Lala <br>That makes it even better.</br></br>  <br>You fuck the regular vagina to get human babies, but if you want spider babies you have to fuck the spider-cooch</br>  <br>Nope. All the girls seem to want vaginal sex from Darling before anything else. Though considering the gifts most of them have... they could do things for him no normal human woman could do.</br>  <br>Well, her blue skin is very shocking, she's the only one who impressed me most when her colors were showed</br>  <br>Spiders have their anus at the end of their lower abdomen, while their vagina is where rachne's human one would be. So she would have 1. Lower abdomen has a bunch of other organs.</br>  <br>She is beautiful.<br><br>And I must say that I am looking forward to the voice of Sento saying silly chuuni stuff.</br></br></br>  <br> cum inside her spinneret <br> she now makes webs made of cum </br></br>  <br>And then there was that shitty page with the<br> Meer <br>wanted poster</br></br></br>  <br><br>A very good point well made. <br><br> forcing her to eat a load out of her own vagoo </br></br></br></br>  <br>I tough she had normal skin color.<br>also black eyes are the shit</br></br>  <br>Black and yellow. God-fucking-tier eyes</br>  <br> kill <br> not rape <br>Fix it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where is she while the rest are at the mermaid hotel?</br></br>  <br>Furiously masturbating in Darling's room</br>  <br>Black scleras are a sign of perfection, Case and point: Lala, some of the girls in TG, That one chick from BnHA.</br>  just so you know, best girls ride the limo.  <br> not forcing her to shoot a load into her own vagoo. </br>  <br>Found this jevel recently.</br>  <br>Wha? Im confused.</br>  <br>Doing chuuni dullahan stuff</br>  <br>She has a dettachable head anon, not a removable penis</br>  <br>Think over how that would work.</br>  <br>With what would she shoot a load in her vagoo? Does she just like buy, a nerf gun or something.</br>  <br> voice of Sento saying silly chuuni stuff <br> not moaning voice of her </br></br>  So adorable.  <br>Have to admit that I'm liking a lot of the anime faces. Reminds me of when I first got into the early chapters.</br>  <br>I'm surprised that none of them have thought of that. He's so sexually repressed he'd probably fall in love with whichever girl finally relieved him first.</br>    <br>I think Lala is one of the cutest girls but her lack of character just makes her less appealing compared to the other girls.</br>  <br> not posting the others </br>  <br>Exactly what Smith is waiting for. Succubus that she is.</br>  <br>The bottom left panel made me laugh, that was one of my first thoughts when ch 34 came out.</br>  <br>The dryad, damn that's going to be fun.. When the blu-rays come out </br>  <br>Fuck all the body holes while the head watches from the shelf?</br>    Will O go after Darling's D?  <br> Draco is a blonde <br><br>...Huh. I totally didn't see that coming. Green scales neither.<br><br> Lilith doesn't have blue skin <br><br>I so expected that, but cute sexy brown is good too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Ill never get tired of the snake's fucking face down there.</br></br>  <br>I could totally see it.

Usually with Shikai the sword changes in appearance but some don't. And with Bankai the sword could change again or not all all, the user could get a costume change or not, and the power is sometimes the same as the Shikai but may be different but keeping the same concept (I.E Making ice to making more and stronger ice, having a small 2HK weapon to a massive 1HK missile, or freezing opponents to controlling temperature and freezing yourself to absolute zero and being able to move.) They also get a newish name (Zangetsu - Tesna Zangetsu, Sode no Shirayuki - Hakka no Togame, Ryujin Jakka - Zanka no Tachi) but naming Mirokumaru for Bankai isn't necessary.<br><br>Examples of Shikai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=km4<wbr>R8J_CqoU</wbr>  [ ] Senna's is at 8:30<br>Examples of Bankai https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4IU<wbr>khdqLeso</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>But anything else is welcomed. <br><br> If the drawfriend who said that he'd draw her on a Ferris wheel in the sunset and woudl deliver in a couple of months is here, has it been dropped? Or is it still in the works? Is it possible to see a wip of any kind? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128515631 <br>you need to take a step back, re evaluate your priorities and your life if free drawings on a shitty imageboard make you so mad. If drawfags don't do my request then that's cool; maybe next time eh? Not worth losing my cool over.</br>  Requesting my Wanko wearing your waifus clothing, anything else is appreciated.  <br>We worked on it during the week and it's not your specific request so feel free to rerequest.<br>Collages don't count anyway.</br></br>  <br>Now I know what I must  intend to draw  this weekend.</br>  <br> 4ft demon in a 4ft giant water balloon </br>  Good morning everyone, hope you all are well. Requesting my dear sweet Gwendoyln please, her smiling face would be enough for me but if you want something specific, I wouldn't mind seeing her sitting comfy in Alice's big red chair and reading or dusting off the Valkyrie book. <br><br>Just remember to take it easy and relax. Let's all have a good weekend.</br></br>  <br> Collages don't count anyway. <br> a collage consisting entirely of images of one character <br><br>Nice.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Tooru with happy look.  I -really- want to ask for my waifu, but she's a  game character  too, how many people would explode if I did so?  <br>go ahead and do it, only autists give a shit</br>  Please report and ignore people trying to derail the thread.  <br>Screw it, thanks for the encouragement.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128515938 <br>Why not pull an Ishida and be nice? Also I'm sure enough your request is supposed to be in the general thread.</br>  <br>Look around. There are a lot of /v/ here. Though I believe this is what /v/ drawthreads were for, literally no one gives a fuck. Just request.</br>  <br>It's probably just one really fat anon who spends all his time to write all the rage postings, don't worry about him.</br>  Requesting Shion wearing glasses and frilly lingerie<br>Anything cute of her is fine <br>Thanks in advance</br></br>  <br>Reminder that this won't stop you from getting a delivery and you're an idiot if you think otherwise</br>  Requesting Aichi lazily playing a 3DS on a couch in casual clothing. If you have any ideas of your own that is fine too.<br><br>Also thanks to the drawfag who colored that Aichi doodle last weekened, I didn't notice it until recently. It looks great!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516117 <br>Fuck off, cunt.</br>  mai waifu with her bangs brushed behind her headband rather than in front  <br> Gets this at the beginning of the thread <br> It's Friday <br> Can re-request <br> Meanwhile we will all bare witness to tons of waifu's not being drawn </br></br></br></br>  Requesting Ciel in a winter attire bundled up with scarf with arms stretched out asking for a hug with a soft smile.<br><br>Thanks for your time and effort should you decide to take my request!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516227 <br>Because its a DRAWTHREAD</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516227 <br>Obviously the intent is to make people angry. And obviously you know this because you're one of them, just trying to make it seem like you've succeeded. This is too obvious though, so no one actually cares.</br>  <br>This is the waifu thread and I think I messed up the post. I wanted to say "please don't treat her poorly".</br>  Requesting my beloved Goddess Satsuki Kiryuuin cosplaying your favorite Dragonball character, my sincere gratitude in advance.  Could someone draw Nemu for me? Anything would be fine but please don't treat her poorly.  <br>Ciel is a qt.<br>What do you think of her remake design?<br> The difference in bangs changes everything. </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128516227 <br>You know I find it hilarious how you preach about not derailing the threads when you shit them up yourself you hypocrite</br>  <br>As if anyone could rerequest after something like this!<br>Thank you very much, Choco, the turtleneck sweater looks really nice on her! Looks very comfortable!<br>And thank you, kuso, for drawing her three times!? They are all very lovely! Ranging from cute, to cute lewd and silly cute. I love all of them!<br>The next image, I don't seem to know who drew this, but regardless, I greatly appreciate it, she looks great with that devious expression on her face!  It does seem you forgot her wings and tail, though <br>Thank you for drawing her as well, Coupon, she looks very calm and serene, I love it!<br>I absolutely adore the outfit swap, the legs, the spear and the see-through shirt on yours, 34, it looks amazing. Thank you so much!<br>Thank you for drawing her again, Hakase! Her looking embarrassed like that with that love letter in her mouth gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling on the inside.<br>The one you drew looks very lovely too, Coati! It makes me happy to see her happy, I just wish I could read what she's saying I'll be studying korean start of next year,  I'll find out at some point  thank you very much!<br>The chibi Etna you drew looks very cute, ora, all sleepy~ thank you!<br><br>I can't thank all of you enough for drawing her for me, but I hope my words of appreciation will convey at least in some form how grateful I am.<br>Once again, thank you!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is indeed.<br><br>I'm more fond of the original, but her remake looks nice. Her original hairstyle is amazing to me and I love it, but a lot of people don't feel that way.   I just want to curl the hair that frames the sides of her face with my finger  </br></br></br>  I'd greatly appreciate somebody working on something for my waifu, Ramlethal.<br> I'm genuinely sorry for not being terribly /a/ related, but she is my waifu, and these threads are reliable! <br><br>If possible I'd like something cute, with her discovering a new food, valentines, a birthday, or swimming - just something she's experiencing for the first time (as she's not very knowledgeable about the world or its contents).<br><br>The further to the right of the reference image you get is more of the stuff I'm looking for/interested in.<br><br>Thank you for reading my request, I hope somebody is interested.<br>Good luck other people too!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting RJ please!  <br>Yeah, I do think her new design is quite nice on it's own, although it's quite different. This may just be my personal experience, but Ciel seems pretty underrated to me, since as far as Type Moon goes most people focus on Fate, then they mainly focus on Arc when it's relating to Tsukihime.</br>  <br>Go ahead and request your waifu, I am sure no one will mind and drawfriends like variety to choose from.</br>  Requesting Alisa please, either her GE1 or GE2 outfit would be fine.  Requesting Risty relaxing after a fight, preferably with armor damage http://imgur.com/a/d2I7V<br><br>Or just her in casual summer clothes or in a swimsuit.</br></br>  Good morning, waifubros and drawfriends. Hope we're all set for a nice laid back and relaxing weekend! I'm just going to list a few ideas I've got for this weekend's requesting and hope someone will be interested:<br><br>- Doremi in a cute bunny costume<br>- Doremi in a sexy bunny costume (probably best to do and older Doremi here)<br>- Doremi in her pjs, sleeping cozilly while dreaming about steak<br>- Doremi dressed like Cure Dream (http://www.pixiv.net/search.php?s_<wbr>mode=s_tag&amp;word=キュアドリーム) and looking like she's about to kick your ass<br><br>Anything at all would be greatly appreciated though. Thanks for your consideration and lets all remember to take it easy.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    Requesting Stocking.<br>Clothes refs: http://i.imgur.com/eV2rl.jpg<br>Summer, beach, and pool related activities welcome.</br></br>  Requesting C.C. cosplaying as Tama  <br>Very cute! Etna enjoys eating sweets, seeing her enjoy ice cream makes me really happy!<br>Thank you very much, anon.<br> I do have to mention you forgot her wings, however </br></br></br>  <br>Do you have more of that nurse outfit?</br>  <br> Megumi Sakura </br>  Requesting my wonderful waifu, Mimi.<br><br>Possibly relaxing with a cold drink on a chaise lounge or similar furniture, but anything cute would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>She'll share her vodka with you if you draw her!<br><br>As always, take it easy, and I hope everyone has an amazing weekend.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No, I only got this version. Why are you asking?</br>  <br>Thank you for adding the wings!  and the tail <br>Thank you once again, anon!<br> Haha, and don't think I didn't notice the ice cream </br></br></br>  <br>Sorry, I just really thought it was cute and hadn't seen it before.</br>  <br>That's cute! I like your coloring. Nice work drawfriend.</br>  Requesting anything with Tiffania.  Requesting Mazaki Anzu attempting or posing (does not need to be any of the ones pictured) on an aerial hoop.<br>Outfit up to artist.<br><br>Any other works are appreciated.</br></br></br>  Requesting PoV of some kind of date with Azusa such as eating at a restaurant, walking in a park or at some kind of event/festival like Tanabata.<br><br>Or anything cute is excellent.<br>Thank you in advance!</br></br></br>  Requesting my dear Ion. Having fun under the rain would be nice, thank you!  Requesting Kochou Yoshida switching outfits with another waifu.  <br>Requesting Kukaku Shiba dressed as Frank Sinatra singing into an old 50's microphone.<br>Or anything is fine.<br>Thanks and have a nice weekend!</br></br></br>  Also, the husbandos are done! I'm posting the ones I had left in pairs as usual. <br><br>Elias and Kagura first.</br></br>  Requesting Mimi Tasogare from Duel Masters dressed as Sheena Fujibayashi from Tales of Symphonia or Milla Maxwell from Tales of Xilia, please!<br><br>Alternatively, requesting Mimi doing something related to her job as a News Reporter, please! <br><br>Thanks if you pick this up!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Super pretty artwork! Lovely! Wonderful! Draw my waifu!</br>  Mikoshiba and Alex Almer.  Afternoon everyone, hope it's going well. <br><br>Requesting Mako as a cute and sleepy magical girl. I'll leave the rest up to the artist's imagination.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>These are just colors of a huge delivery 34 did like a month ago, but thanks!<br><br>Mochizou and Handa next.</br></br></br>  <br>Nice Elias  can't say the same for the other one though. </br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please. If the artist wants something specific they can have her legs on a desk while she's sitting or have her tied up in a glass cylinder like in Batman Forever.  <br>It's the coloring that's wowing me, anon. Great great great work.</br>  Aizen and Gawain to finish.  <br>That's a lot of husbandos colored. Thank you for all the hard work! <br>I feel really happy to see them all colored too, there needs to be more love for husbandos around here.</br></br>  Requesting anything with Sailor Iron Mouse, please!  And full picture. Full size at the booru, tag your husbandos! I'll try to arrange them all in some more fun way later.<br><br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=49154<br><br>Thank you to 34 for drawing these, as well as all the deliveries every weekend and thanks to all the anons that like them!

Here's a big list of request ideas:<br><br>-Reading a comicbook<br><br>-Making a superhero costume or fitting a hero costume around a mannequin<br><br>-Looking for her toolbox either in her room or in a workshop<br><br>-This one is probably really hard, but I want a picture that makes it look like she's inside the monitor, fixing the insides behind a shattered part of the background.

Weird., Everything else looks so lovely though, especially digging the patches of light shining through leaves.</br>  Requesting Kneesocks, anything goes.<br><br>A different hairstyle might be interesting, artist's choice.</br></br>  Requesting a cute Tomoko  <br>So cute.</br>  <br>Its okay, you did great! Thank you for drawing her and it was great to watch her get drawn! And don't worry about the errors, just remember them for your next delivery and work on them!<br>Good luck on your next delivery and enjoy your week!</br></br>  <br> ugly hat <br><br>Why does no one like hats anymore?</br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  Requesting Ebina doing something cute.<br>Please and thanks!</br>  <br>Thank you so much for drawing her, Boa!  My bait was successful!  I really like your hatching style and Erza looks so beautiful and elegant here in Saber's clothes. I will cherish this picture for ever. Thank you again, and have a wonderful rest of the weekend!</br>  <br>No problem, anon  I was going to draw her anyway </br>  <br>Draw waifus as food. Like you did with Esdeath.</br>  Requesting Eureka in a dress similar to the one featured on the right.(Long, elegant design near the rim). Maybe looking off a cliff into the ocean, but that isnt needed!<br><br>Additional Refs: http://imgur.com/a/jK9yw<br><br>Thanks for your consideration.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Draw her again, if you would kindly.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128519788 <br><br><br> Only new IP on the non deleted request <br>hmmmm.</br></br></br></br>  <br> waifus as food <br><br>Now it will give me nightmares.</br></br></br>   boa replies to every thanks but yours  <br><br><br>;_;</br></br></br>  <br>It's just a chibi so rerequest if you feel like it.</br>    <br> cutehat <br><br>Now I have hope my waifu's hat would be more well received.</br></br></br>  <br> Not the Netherworld lava beach <br>Get creative, guys.</br></br>  Anything of Chihaya please, not terribly picky.  <br>That was a very confusing request<br><br><br>Never say this to me again<br><br><br>Don't worry anon, I know when I get thanks and when I don't. Still, it's not like my replies are all that much beyond "don't mention it"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Animated delivery <br> rerequest </br></br>  Requesting Chronoire please, I usually get mega cute deliveries so something more faithful to her original style or outfit would be cool, since she's kinda kickass. Like, she eats other witches for meals. But definitely including her tiny  hat  please! I don't think many people realize how tiny she is, so her getting on a stool to reach something or anything making fun of her size would be cool. Like not being tall enough for a roller coaster! As always, anything cute is fine and much appreciated, thanks!  Requesting Akame anything is fine!  <br> That was a very confusing request <br>I think what he wanted was as Esdeath version of those Dennis the Menace ice cream pops.</br></br>  <br> How're those paper waifus coming along? </br>    I get that you drawfags hate the people that complained about that huge collage, but I don't get why you can't realize that those were shitposters. Just be the bigger man and stop giving in to these shitposters. You're only making non shitposters hate you more, ultimately wrecking these threads more than they are.  <br>Pretty good, I'm going away for the weekend today but plan on delivering before then.</br>  <br>Thank you again for the chibi, you didn't had to link me tho, how misleading</br>  Requesting Tsuruya please. Perhaps as a magical girl or idol.<br><br>Anything else is fine. Take it easy!</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Oh my god, thank you so much, Kusugu, this looks amazing! She's so cute, and the swimsuit is adorable too! I absolutely love it!</br>  Requesting Fuuka wearing a Bavarian dirndl. Thanks in advance.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirnd<wbr>l</wbr></br></br>  Requesting anything cute of Honoka.<br><br>For specifics, requesting Honoka eating a bagel and wearing glasses.<br><br>Have a great weekend.</br></br></br></br>  Smile, anon. Love you're waifu with all you're heart and she will be drawn this weekend!  <br>I don't like your implications, nigger</br>  <br>I could have worded it better, but basically the "circle" shouldn't poke the bear just because they can. They're making even more people hate them (which causes more shitposting) just because they can't get over trolls that did something over a month ago. It makes them honestly look like children when they get hurt by trolls on an anonymous board.</br>  <br>I know, but that took a while to figure out<br><br><br>what</br></br></br></br>  <br>I spent the whole week reading her manga and watching her anime over and over. You better not be lying.</br>  <br><br>Not talking about you Boa.</br></br>  <br>A ditzy Boa is cute, too.</br>  <br>I don't remember people complaining about that huge collage. I just remember a lot of people being confused about whether they should request after that or not. Nobody but the mods even know who is who around here anyway though, so it's unlikely there's any sort of revenge or whatever happening for whatever trolling apparently happened.</br>  <br>The worse the shitposting gets the worse the circleposting gets the worse the shitposting gets<br><br>We may have to shut it down for a month or two at some point.</br></br></br>  <br>The "revenge" some drawfags are enacting are the things like "rerequest it's part of a collage and it's not what you asked for!". Except they're not hurting the shitposters, they're hurting everyone else. <br><br>Drawfags have an identity in these boards whereas the shitposters can be completely anonymous, so it's up to them to be the more mature ones and just leave shit alone. Although it doesn't hurt me personally, they could have easily just given Etnafag the deliveries in the stream. If they try to cause shit like that, their posts should be deleted just like the mods do to the ones complaining about circles.</br></br></br>  Requesting Oora in the typical scene where rose pedals are leading to the bed to seduce the anon.  Except she is happily asleep since she dosed off before she could   Requesting some cute Yuki please de gozaru~  lewd is okay   <br>I think that would be best. Just to let everyone cool down a bit.</br>  Requesting Taiga, please.<br>Anything would be appreciated.</br>  Requesting Len drawn in mitsudomoe style art if possible.<br><br>gelbooru.com/index.php?page=post&amp;s=<wbr>list&amp;tags=mitsudomoe+official_art<br><br>Anything cute would be fine too.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I finished that sharkbro colouring, though in the end I didn't have time and went the lazy route. Hope she gets drawn, anon!</br>  <br><br>Ah, I see.<br> <br>I don't really know enough about the circle to point any fingers or anything, but I think the basic rule of thumb should be to avoid starting any shit to the best of your knowledge and ability. Even if someone comes up to you and tries to provoke you, your best bet is just to fold and stop the wheel of hate before it even gets rolling.<br><br>I know I'm not a perfect example of that but I think it still holds up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OR here, thank you for drawing and treating her kindly.</br>  Requesting long haired Hitagi sitting under a tree, or anything that you're be motivated to draw of her.  Requesting Millia Rage please. It would be greatly appreciated.  <br>I completely agree with you Boa. That's why you're my favorite drawfag around here.</br>  <br>Thanks.<br>its pretty nice, the colours are good.<br>some edges are a bit pixely though, but thats fine.</br></br></br>  <br>See I agree with you too. I also agree with the mentality that if people cant follow the established theme it shouldn't exist. The general was getting along just fine when you were drawing waifus or other anime girls as bunnies</br>  <br>Have a nice weekend</br>  <br>Lewd! Nicely done Yokura!</br>  <br>My dick.</br>  <br>Holy cute and lewd! Thank you so much~ I hope you have a wonderful rest of your weekend~</br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br> flat waifu <br> draw her with nice, juicy melons <br>You're alright.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Cute as fuck everyone! Nicely done!</br></br></br>  Requesting Hakodate Omiko trying to deal with the Summer heat, or dressed as a pirate.  Cheering everyone on!<br>She'll get drawn, Anon, and it'll be beautiful. <br>It's gonna be a good weekend.<br><br> I'll be sitting this one out, due to receiving nice deliveries last week </br></br></br></br>  <br>Draw more big tits, yo.</br>  <br>Why do you feel the need to let people know you aren't requesting? Just curious since this seems like a popular thing people are doing recently.</br>  <br>If you're going to fuck off for the week, there's no need to announce it, much less avatarfag about it</br>  Requesting Kagura laying/sitting up in a bed, please!<br><br>As always, anything you feel like drawing,  even somewhat lewd,  would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>Please and thank you!</br></br></br></br>  Everyone here is always so salty. Very depressing.  <br>because this is the circle jerk thread</br>  <br>Aw, they look lovely! Thank you so much for including him, I had fun with you guys as well.<br><br> <br>I just wanted to thank you for coloring all of them; your colors are so soft and beautiful.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop please. Just ignore the "circle" deliveries.</br>  <br><br>I'm not the anon you're quoting but you guys need to take it easy.</br></br>  <br>Take what easy? I'm asking a simple question...</br>  Requesting Misao hugging a big teddy bear.<br><br>Keep it cute, no lewd and have fun, thank you.<br><br>Have a nice weekend.</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Inaba please.<br><br>Anything cute or  cute/lewd  would be awesome! Thanks in advance!</br></br>  <br>To be fair the only reason people say they aren't requesting is hoping that someone will take sympathy on them and draw something.</br>  open-chest_sweater  <br>Thanks hei, she's super cute. The time you spent shading really shows!</br>  Requesting Pyrrha Alexandra in Yomi's clothes please~<br><br>Extra reference:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/484135/0d5f83<wbr>c941/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br>goddamn, yokura, that's very hot.<br>very nicely done</br></br>  <br>Great work as always.</br>  Good Day.<br>Requesting Amelia running around in the kitchen with an anxious look on her face.<br>But anything ,especially where she's pressured, is fine really.<br>Thank you in advance.</br></br></br>  You wouldnt sexualize a Chinese Neptune right?  <br> going to threads you don't like in the first place <br>How boring is your life?</br></br>  <br>Uni has ass hair!</br>  <br>And lots of cum in her tummy</br>  I want to put my penis inside big nep    Reminder that Shirabe is cute too.  <br>The only other shows I'm even watching are Dragon Ball Super and Shimoneta. DBS hasn't really gone anywhere yet but at the very least it's Dragon Ball with actually modern animation and art quality. Shimoneta is pretty funny if you don't mind some juvenile humor, but it is, unfortunately, probably not going anywhere since it's a one-cour based on an ongoing LN.</br>  <br> Incidentally is there anybody who doesn't think Symphogear is the best thing airing this season? <br>It is the most fun and the one I enjoy the most, but I wouldn't call it AOTS because it isn't actually good in terms of writing.</br></br>  <br>Yes.
