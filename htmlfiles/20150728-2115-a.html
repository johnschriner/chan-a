That's like 4 episodes of anime.</br></br></br>    <br>this. it's way too much unless you're trying to prepare for a marathon.</br>  <br> 4 episodes in 2 hours <br><br>Make it only one, maybe two, for me.</br></br></br>  <br> Umaru doesn't watch anime, she's a /v/-tard. <br><br>She especifically said in the first episode she wanted to watch her sunday morning cartoons.</br></br></br>  New Himouto! Umaru-chan S out<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/BaWFUGhPsIM  [ ]</br></br>  <br> talks about missing Morning/Evening Anime in the show. <br> a whole chapter in the manga about her watching anime. </br></br>  <br><br><br>Hey, you do you, but if you want stay away from being an obese neckbeard, you should do runs regularly. I'm only recommending for an average man's workout to stay not-fat. You probably know your body well enough to balance your own diet and exercise, but I would recommend doing 1.5-2 hours per day (not all in one go). Maybe take a break from the anime and the computer screen to digest the episode while you run. Get to reflect and think while you exercise. <br>Also remember your pushups. those are easy to remember. Just do it before every meal. three sets of six. so do 6 pushups, wait 15 seconds, do 6 more, wait 15 seconds, and then do another 6, then eat.</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw watching this entire thing </br>    <br>The nose bridges are similar in structure if not downright the same.

I do situps every day though.</br>  <br>  cardio + push-up only routine <br>Enjoy your muscle dysbalances and early-onset back pain.</br></br>  <br>you're lucky. I gained at least 5 kilos since the beginning of the year without noticing and I do occasional exercise (I go swimming sometimes).</br>  <br>I gained the same than you but I think it's only from beer.</br>  <br>I really don't think you can gain 5 kilos just because of the beer, unless you drink everyday unhealthy amounts of it.</br>  I want /fit/ to leave  <br><br>It happens. Either you've been blessed with the metabolism of the gods for all eternity, or it just hasn't turned off. I know a couple guys who burns more calories from sitting, then other guys who spend all day hiking and running.<br><br><br>pretty much, but it does wear you out a bit, giving you better sleep at the end of the day, which is the most important part of being healthy.<br><br><br>We're not building muscle. it's just to stay in a relatively medium figure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b6-2P8R<wbr>gT0A</wbr>  [ ]<br>The intro is so cute, it makes me feel pleasant feelings</br>  <br>your shit taste</br>  <br>The VA is doing a really good job singing here and with the character alltogether</br>   Literally Japanese Garfield   <br>Look at that plump ass. 10/10 would ravage.</br>  <br>Or... y'know.. just find a sport that you enjoy, maybe you'll even make some friends while you're at it</br>  <br>Best OP this season by a mile.<br><br>It's catchy as hell, captures outside Umaru and hamster Umaru well, and the VA's voice is cute.</br></br></br>  <br> Or... y'know.. just find a sport that you enjoy, maybe you'll even make some friends while you're at it <br>Yeah, but I only enjoy camping.

I actually thought it was going to be good because people like you said it was. But now, I believe. I believe in /a/'s taste.</br></br>  <br>How can you even have sex with her?</br>  <br>nothing wrong here</br>  <br>What do you mean? Her chibi form is totally fuckable.</br>  <br> who is the artist <br/></br>  How does she puberty?  <br><br>She'll have to Umaru~n back to normal first</br></br>  <br>No. This anime is awesome.</br>  <br>Dunno. It's pretty funny though.</br>  <br><br>Not enough Ebina</br></br>   tfw living the umaru life   <br>Not enough Kanou x Onii-chan with indoor Umaru walking in on them fucking like hamsters  on her bed .</br>  <br>Too much unkomaru</br>  <br>The source material.</br>  <br>Japs sure do like being cucked, judging from their porn.</br>    Would you a 3DPD Umaru~n?  <br>I'd play video games with her.</br>  <br>I'd Umaru~n her if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Umaru is unko-chan</br>  <br>wrong voice casting</br>  <br>why are japs so autistic about puns, they'll put statues with dicks and big balls everywhere, and shit on their head for the sake of puns</br>  is there a bamboo shoot equivalent that is sold here in the US? I want to try that potato chip + bamboo shoot (cracker + chocolate dip?)  <br>Anon, cheese tara is not really cheese.</br>  <br>That cola is too small.</br>  <br>It's 1 liter. Fite me.</br>  <br>It's just cookie with chocolate. There's not actual bamboo shoot involved.</br>  <br><br>The mushrooms are better anyway</br></br>  <br> mfw looking up what cheese tara is just now <br> strips of processed fish and milk products meant mimic the qualities of genuine cheese <br>Jesus fucking christ why?</br></br></br>  I wish slacking off and being a worthless sack of shit playing video games really did make you this happy.  <br>I'd  make her go outside .</br>  <br>It's not like she's a depressed neet, she performs her life duties and then spends her free time with having fun. In reality this isn't a hikkineet pandering show, it shows that you can have fun slacking off once you're done with your duties and have a happy life. Look at Umaru, she could be anxious and obsessed with her peers and with school but instead she just doesn't give a shit, pays attention during class, studies before exams as a result does well and just thinks about video games and snacks.</br>  <br>I need the sauce of that.</br>  So anons, who preordered the hoodie?  <br>I was thinking of getting one, but I'm a man and i'm not sure how a hamster shawl would look on a male.</br>  <br>who cares, noone else will see you, I wouldn't buy one because hell whats the fucking point but if all you're worried about is what people might think, then noone will think anything</br>  <br>I want one but I am poor as fuck right now and don't know how much it costs</br>  <br>Looks like they're about 5000. I kind of want one too.</br>  <br>What's interesting is this is more or less the exact same message of Evangelion. 90s NEETs didn't have it so badly they actually needed to withdraw from the world. They can find some way to participate in a minimal way, or even if they're lucky in a real and satifying way, and still enjoy their hobbies and not have their identity subsumed into the monoculture, or whatever. I guess it's not surprising exactly that the same message has to be repeated again and again to each new generation of otaku though.</br>  <br>Nice blog where's the titter button I want to follow your every update.<br>:^)</br></br>  <br>Absolutely nothing.</br>  <br>Can someone shoop out her arm so she looks like a cute little blob?</br>  <br>;^)</br>  <br>You claim to filter yet you reply.<br>Nice going champ.</br></br>  <br> Kyoani mousepad <br>superb taste, anon</br></br>  <br> No octopus sucker snack <br> No hamster hood <br><br>1/10 that photo is shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you aren't just jello of my white lolita cookies </br>  <br>And it's drawn by a nip woman.</br>  <br>Do japs measure in liters?<br><br>It was my understanding that americans did everything assbackwards <br>This is coming from an american too</br></br></br></br>  <br>That has to be at least $100 in junk food.</br>  <br>Well it's really easy to get sick of the world and just hide away with things you like.

IN MAI COMEDY ANIMU!!!</br>  <br> metro system </br>  <br>it's called liter here, and in a lot of places, no it's not, 1l of clean water is 1 kg but 1l of anything with different density is different, liter is a volume system you dumbass, and more than anything it just supposed to express volume of liquids as opposed to volume of anything including gas and solid things</br>  <br> [kdfss]  <br><br>Literally who?</br></br></br>  <br>Better than horrible, that's who.</br>  Ebina smells like shit  <br> implying liter is an incorrect spelling <br> metro system <br>Typical bonglander.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. I don't expect you to understand. You're a dumb Yankee, after all. That doesn't mean you can't be taught to regurgitate bullshit, though. How many times have you been made to spit out the names of all 50 US states, I wonder?<br><br>Here's a fun fact for you. 1m cubed = 1000L of water.</br></br></br>  <br> the oppai mousepad <br>im only now noticing it in here.</br></br>  <br>This is a troll right? You're taught the difference between weight and volume in your country, right?</br>  <br>not even american though, you're just talking straight bullshit<br> of water <br>yeah, that's the point, ever heard of density? just saying but I've spent a lot of my time in chemistry/biology labs and if I measured every liquid as if it was 1l/1kg then I would've been kicked out on the first day<br>you know, drink are mostly made of water so it's more or less the same as in kgs but from a proper scientific pov 1l is not necessarily 1kg</br></br></br></br>  <br>Vitamin D deficiency ;^)<br><br><br>I was in a locker room once and some guys were joking around weighing themselves before and after peeing.<br><br>They said, "lol I don't know how much water weighs" and I gave them a dirty look. They probably thought it was about their piss game, but really it was about their piss ignorance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1m really does equal 1000L. That equals 1000kg, which equals 1 ton. Do you understand density and volume, Mr. Cowboy?</br>  <br>Especially since she's only had like 4-5 minor roles before this.</br>  <br>moe anime moe problems</br>  <br>1m3 does, only with water, again density gb2schoolpls</br>  <br> 1m really does equal 1000L </br>  <br>I don't think the difference in density between water and piss is really great enough to matter in this context.</br>  I want to bully Umaru.  <br>probably, I didn't say anything about your piss contest though, but in labs I have to measure dense ethanol, sulfuric acid, acetic acid etc. and those aren't the same density as water, which he seems to not understand</br>  <br>Ebina, simply Ebina.</br>  when you nut but she still going  <br>Yeah holy bet she thinks people are giving her rapestares when they're just staring at her fugly jewnose.

I can just do pushups while watching tele and it only takes a couple of minutes also I'd have to take a shower, get clean clothes and shit if I go out, way too much hassle.</br>  <br>I used to run a hour each day, but i've gotten real lazy and it's gotten real hot. I hate running so much.</br>  Bill Murray dub when?  <br>Yeh running is torture, I love swimming but then again it's so much fucking hassle. I just want to stay inside all day and shower maybe once a week.</br>  I can't tell if it's cute or kinda sad. If anything I want to get her out more.  <br>Her shitty brother enabled her bad lifestyle and now she's a drain on society and on himself in general.</br>  Why does the guy coddle her so much? He should just let her live in her own filth and make her own meals. She can obviously do it since she's a Mary Sue and perfect in every way.  <br>What drain, she's performing perfectly well and is living in a one room apartment with her brother. Compared to Ebina whose parents are renting her an apartment and still performs as shit she's an example citizen. Most likely when she's finished school she's gonna be an asset to society, being a normie who doesn't amount to shit is not better than being a nerd who performs well.</br>  <br>You fool! The curse is already affecting you</br>  <br>Because he loves his precious imouto.</br>  <br>ayyy</br>  <br>5000 yen + shipping and you don't have to pay until like mid October when it comes out.<br><br><br>It's not like you will go out in it.</br></br></br></br>  Old thread died: <br><br>So which version do we DL for anon-kun's subs, and did he do it for the SP/uncut version? is the 720p containing banding like the 1080p version did?<br><br>Pls response.<br><br>Links:<br>[1080p] http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>16434<br><br>[720p] http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>16416<br><br>raws here:<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>12806<br><br>subs here:<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/t<wbr>r5xmrgekrer2f4/%5BAnonSubs%5D_Psych<wbr>o_Pass_THE_MOVIE_Subtitles_v1.ass</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  THE DEAD SHOULD STAY DEAD  Why couldn't the second season be good like the movie?<br><br>What went wrong.<br><br>Even Mika as a smug Sibyl dog was done better.</br></br></br></br>  So is there going to be more PP?  someone pls respond, do the links in the OP have the entire uncut version and are the subs made for that...<br><br><br>next summer</br></br></br>  <br> ... <br>STOP</br></br>  <br>Because Araki a shit</br>  <br>what</br>  <br>yeah but did shougo use 8 dominators?</br>  downloading the 1080p w/ subs  The scoring for the movie really bugged me.<br><br> let's see how many times we can play the first few notes of the main theme on different instruments <br> let's do fucking bigass trailer music and choral numbers because why the fuck not <br><br>I did like the way they pulled out the old themes in the final act, when the gang was all back in action together.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ghost Shogo was right, here's Akane going off to shape nations and Kogami's chasing after a literally who Nigger</br>  Needed more Tacticool Akane  <br>Speaking of kogami, he took the beatdown of his life this movie eh?</br>  <br> What went wrong <br>No best boy writing</br></br>  <br>Because no Urobuchi.</br>  <br> good like the movie <br><br>The movie was painfully monkey-see, monkey-do.<br><br> gotta have a villain with a literate philosophy <br> gotta talk about how the hunters become the hunted <br> gotta talk some shit about how great sibyl is, for our moral greyness quota <br> gotta have one guy who's immune to psycho-pass readings.  <br> fuck it, let's have   AN ENTIRE MILITARY THAT'S IMMUNE <br> gotta have akane talk sense to the system <br><br>It's like they put together a checklist of things the first season did, and just tried to go down it mechanistically.<br><br>The visual styling was there (and with a movie budget), the sound design was there (oh man, dat dominator voice), but it felt like a well-painted shell without the crunchy core season 1 had. And frankly, how crunchy season 1's core really was is debatable, so anything less than it is pretty soft.<br><br>The idea of Kogami turning into a cheap copy of Makishima is the most entertaining thing in the movie, and the moments where he's obviously trying to say something badass are pretty funny.<br><br>But fuck, this series needs to end. It's already rotted out whatever core it once had, and what's left is worse writing masquerading in a costume that looks like the original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> The idea of Kogami turning into a cheap copy of Makishima is the most entertaining thing in the movie, and the moments where he's obviously trying to say something badass are pretty funny. <br><br>But the movie makes it clear that Kogami isn't Shogo. Kogami gets wrekt all throughout the movie, and Ghost Shogo appears to call him a useless faggot.<br><br>Movie seems like an obvious set-up for season 3. Kogami needs to stop playing at war and actually go all in on his ideals against Sybil Enabler.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The army wasn't immune, they just cheated the readings since sybil left ahole in the code to permit them to do so.<br>The real shit is really that NOT one character was immune to the readings.<br>Like i have to believe that the colonel that killed people with absolutely no reaction or the black mercenary aren't psychopaths and have their stress levels raise when they kill, of course.</br></br></br>  So why the fuck did Kogami go after the black mercenary dude at the end?<br><br>Literally what did that accomplish?</br></br>  HOLY FUCK<br>Was Akane's friend always this god damn sexy?</br>  <br>They gave her a bit of an upgrade.</br>  <br>he god mad<br>even dead shougo mocked him</br></br>  Absolutely nothing.<br>It was not even a test of his own strength since they had to take him two vs one.<br>Also, he was exactly what he should've been looking for, someone like Shogo, a free man following only his instincts that could pose a threat to Sybil system, the one that took away their friend to protect the hyper oatz+ collection of psychopatic brains.<br>No one even care that Sybil fucking killed their friends anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Any link for just the audio file?</br>  <br>I was expecting full nips, but seeing Akane's side-akanes was pretty good.</br>  <br>It accomplished nothing. Kogami just did it because it was the only thing he could do.<br><br>And even then Gino had to bail him out.</br></br></br>   Kamiya Hiroshi's engrish <br>Sexy.</br>  My husbando may have jobbed majorly in the movie but it was fun seeing him CQC those Metal Gear villains  Reposting worst characters in the movie.  <br>They were characters? <br><br>Only the leader guy had any characterization. Even then, they're pretty generic merc stereotypes.</br></br></br>  <br>This has good filename potential.</br>  <br>I think it was motivation to keep going. The scene before finding that mercenary was Shogo saying he has no motivation unless he's chasing prey.</br>   Kougami getting rekt so hard by ghost Makishima he starts shooting at nothing   <br> rekt by Akane in the CQC struggle <br> rekt by Spooky Boogie Shogo <br> rekt by a nigger <br> rekt by Gino <br>This whole movie was just Kougami getting rekt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Poor guy got his ass handed to him by everyone. All he did was take out a couple drones.</br></br>  <br>He had a pretty bitching cult, though. Probably fucked 10/10 ladyboys all day erry day</br>  <br>Pretty much Kurtz from Heart of Darkness up in there</br>  <br>Nowhere near ruthless enough to be Kurtz.</br>  Speaking of makishima, anyone has a full list of his books?  <br>More a Kilgore than a Kurtz</br>  <br>I figured that was more Akane's role, seeing as she was still employed by the company Kurtz/Kougami defected from.</br>  I'm glad saiga got time to shine, wish they would use him more.  The pillbugs were neat in the "20-25 years from now, these will be real" sort of way.  <br> Akane <br> Kilgore <br>She's Willard/Marlow if anything. I don't see how you'd say she's a Kilgore.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah shit, I'm getting my characters mixed up. It's been awhile since I've watched Apocalypse Now</br>  I was searching for <br>and ended up<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comm<wbr>ents/3eno9r/psycho_pass_movie_has_n<wbr>ow_been_fansubbed/</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>talk about censorship eh</br>  So who was technology? Was it the mercs or some orginization that hasnt been identified yet.  <br> that mod's MAL <br><br>I'm not sure what I was expecting.</br></br></br>  <br> psycho-pass 2: 10/10 <br> psycho-pass: 7/10 <br><br>I don't even</br></br></br></br>  Nice movie. Also: Kougami seeing ghost Shougo. He must be a psycho.<br><br>Go on, Sybil System! Export yourself. :3</br></br>  <br>Second season had more action.</br>  <br>Holy fuck, no kidding.<br><br>Having never really spent any time there, I always kind of suspected all the reddit hate around here was just a meme. But holy shit, they really are full retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Its the look into the abyss effect anon, both are pretty much the same now</br>  One thing I liked about this movie was that it helped justify how the Sibyl system could have come to be. If the world is as fucked up everywhere as people say, people would definitely be more open to allowing such a big brother world if it meant any (appearance of) peace.<br><br>I still would love to see more worldbuilding about the system being established.</br></br>  Dumb question. Anyone else having issues with opening this file? All I'm getting is the audio track when I try to play it in MPC. I can still open all my other chinese cartoons just fine, though.  <br>Yeah, kinda figured some shit went down because of the korean hacker from S1, but if everywhere in the world besides japan went to the shitter, might as well call in big brother.</br>  <br>Try to reset your codec settings if you're using CCCP.</br>  <br>Update your codec</br>  <br>There is a question, however, of just how fucked up the rest of the world is, or if it is even fucked up that much at all. It's possible that it's all or in part propaganda by the Sibyl system itself, in order to justify its own existence.</br>  <br>Thanks, friend.</br>  <br>Kogami said he didn't find a safe place to rest, so we can assume at lest asia/oceania went kaput</br>  <br>Yeah, I totally can see parts of the world being (relatively) fine but Sibyl tells everyone it's them or Mad Max.<br><br>It was also cool to see some military hardware in this universe. I was always wondering how cool the military stuff must be if the Health and Safety people had stuff like Dominators.</br></br></br>  <br>The amount of detail they went into justifying Sibyl in another country along with how that system works in a new environment is pretty good without digging too deep and looking for plot holes.<br><br>Although I'm not convinced that one room full of brains is enough to judge the psycho pass for Japan ALONG with other countries. That korean in the first season even mentions how that the capabilities of Sibyl are impossible with super computers. Brains are silly, but I can easily suspend my disbelief for it because I can't think of a better explanation for Sibyl. <br><br>I hope Sibyl is still collecting brains.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First only the audio track would load,<br>Then only the video would load.<br>Then I stopped being a massive faggot and purges/updated my codecs.<br>Then it was very pretty.</br></br></br></br>  <br> watch as s3 will be akane fusing with sibyil </br>  <br>I just hope that she becomes some kind of political figure for Sibyl.</br>  That Vietnamese was unexpectedly decent, thought I didn't recognise it at first. Probably the accent.  Man, the story was so fucking bad<br><br>S1 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; S2 &gt; this shit</br></br>  my god thought people were over exaggerating the engrish in this <br> onri smarr fwis here <br>why didnt they just hire actual english speakers</br></br>  <br> why didnt they just hire actual english speakers <br><br>Because the average Japanese viewer probably wouldn't notice. It's like when you watch a hollywood movie and the middle eastern terrorists or russian mob or whatever are speaking. It could be utter shit but most viewers don't know.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good point</br>  <br>I think they do notice that it isn't good but don't realize to what extent. The fact is that they simply don't care because english isn't their language. I'd rather them not speak english at all because it's grating to the ears.<br><br>All things aside I was pleasantly surprised by that movie. Only if the second season could have been that good. This seems more like a natural continuation of the events that unfolded in Season 1 and the second season had a shit movie tier plot. WTF happened?</br></br></br>  <br>I like your writing style. You sound like a professional critic. <br>You should write reviews professionally, or maybe have a blog or something.</br></br>  I thought it was alright, they could've shortened this shit by about an hour or so, and substituted it for better animation. But I liked how they kept with the same style. It was a 6.5 or 7/10 in my book.  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>16518<br><br>Should I grab this one. Its larger so it has to be better.</br></br></wbr>   75% of the film is spent listening to extremely cringy Engrish <br>At least the action scenes were okay</br>  <br> Urobuchi: Kougami’s innate nature is that of a hound dog. He will definitely chase after the ball when it’s thrown.  <br><br> Fukami: He’s the type to be happy when encountering bad people because he just loves justice that much and is a workaholic. Even if he never says it aloud, he must really be happy to have met Makishima. It’s like…there finally existed an enemy that was on par with him. </br></br></br>  <br>Because in the movie they're Japanese/Asians who speaks English to understand each other ?<br>It totally makes sense.</br></br>  <br> I still would love to see more worldbuilding about the system being established. <br><br>They released an LN recently about the origin of sibyl and young detective Masaoka.</br></br></br>  I only watch Psycho Pass because I want Akane and Kougami to have sex. Is that a bad thing?  <br> Kougami seeing ghost Shougo. He must be a psycho. <br><br>I don't think hallucinations mean shit in terms of insanity in Psycho Pass universe.<br><br>Akane purposely burned cigarets so she could hallucinate Kougami in S2 and her psycho pass was completely clear.</br></br></br></br></br>  I loved Kamiyan  <br>anyone knows what mandatory happiness is about ? considering of importing it</br>  <br><br> But if you don't keep your eyes open, this could turn into a MASAKA </br></br>  <br>Well duh. It's symbolic in that everyone but him has been moving on with their lives. They all got good while he has just been stagnant, waiting for something to interest him again. A hound dog is utterly useless without a prey to hunt.</br>  The one undeniably good thing coming from the movie is the confirmation of Makishima being dead, so contrarians will shut up.  <br>But why does it matter if it's grating to your ears? This is a movie that was released in Japan. It was never meant for the English viewers.</br>  <br>JUST FUCK ALREADY</br>  <br>Yes, because Akane deserves someone better than Kougami now. She needs to acquire a harem made up of psychopaths of both genders of her own and then reject them all since she's a workaholic and she needs to arrest them.</br>  So they left the country into the hands of guys with poison collars? What the fuck?  <br>nah they left the country into the hands of a fucking military which defeated the old government and now the leader which is a psychopath is in charge of it as a dictator all being said doubt you can even call that a country place was a mess</br>  <br>It's Africa tier.</br>  rips cute girl   back to the status quo again <br><br>I don't know what I expected</br></br>  <br>man Ling Tosite Sigure again huh? can't I say I really like them but guess they became a staple of the series already <br>wish Nothing's Carved in Stone come back for S3 though</br></br>  <br> Not this shit again <br>Just because Sybil is still alive and functioning does not mean nothing has happened. All the fancy action scenes are just a red herring, the real battle is one about ideals between Akane and Sybil, which Akane won.</br></br>  Do I need to watch the 2. season to watch the movie, or is there no connection?   Blond girl dies  <br>as expected from him <br>''no waifus allowed''</br></br>   you will never defile and beat Kogami   <br>Season 2 isn't really needed.<br><br>Captcha related</br></br></br>  <br>She's a psychopathu, not your waifu. Looks like someone needs to report themselves to the nearest Inspector.</br>  <br>Got back to your cage mika <br>  ;_;  </br></br>  <br>Great, thanks!</br>  <br><br> Set during the first 10 episodes or so in an island. <br> The story unfolds from POV of 2 original characters <br> A lot of choices and lots of endings <br> Can use the kinect and smartglass, it syncs with an iphone/tablet app to display information and I think to make calls <br> Plenty of fanservice <br> Written by Kimura Kou, one of the scenario writers of Forest. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   post-credits <br> election results showing an overwhelming majority supporting Han/Sybil <br> implications of more war <br><br>Ko really did get rekt.<br>Urobutcher loves bullying Ko.<br><br><br>The leader was a Sybil drone, you deaf shit. Shambala was a de-facto district of Japan from the start.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Akane won <br>Sybil won, by an overwhelming electoral landslide.</br></br>  <br>Some third world country is starting to implement the sybil system and it seems kogami is in the country helping the anti government forces fight back. Akane finds him and decides to go deal with him.<br><br>Thats the basic plot.</br></br></br>  <br>He's talking about the Xbone game not the movie.</br>   BD 1920x280 <br> 1.74 GiB <br> 2 channels <br>This is horrible quality.</br></br></br>  <br>wow that wasn't that bad <br>pretty good in my opinion <br>8/10 but since it was better than s2 well that deserves some praise so 9/10</br></br></br>  <br>No they didn't. The point wasn't the electoral vote but getting them to have one in the first place. They, the people that supposedly know what's best for humanity, admitted they were wrong and followed the advice of a mere human. They had decided to let humanity decide for themselves instead deciding for them. It is a complete 180 from all their previous dealings in Japan.</br>   that Gino and Akane scene  <br> Gino literally telling her to stop dreaming about Ko  <br>Gino x Akane right ? I can't be the only one thinking this ?</br></br>  <br>It's going to be Akane x Sybil and you know it. The entire thing has been setup so the two exists in a symbiosis relationship. It's going to be like Gatchaman all over again.</br>  Bad subs. Still better than nothing though.  <br><br>I know man, even for a film that's about 2 hours average that quality is terrible. Needs to be 8GB at least or its just a waste watching it.</br></br>  <br>Gino wishes.</br>   retards failing to understand explicitly spelled-out elements like how the soldiers evaded the scanners or why Kogami chased him <br> being too stupid to understand fucking Psycho Pass <br><br>You know, seeing this sort of thing just makes me suspect that it's actually much smarter than people give it credit for. Either that or you all have brain damage.</br></br></br>  <br> 5 mins in <br> all this engrish <br>Good fuck of lordy fucks<br>What were they thinking?</br></br></br></br>  <br>gino is more likely to get with sho</br>  <br>Exactly<br><br>It's a faux philosophical anime, and it's somehow too deep for most of these dumbfucks.</br></br></br>  I still don't understand why Lethal mode has to "Explode" assailants.  <br>Sybil began life as a pizza delivery service.</br>  <br>There is no kill like overkill.</br>  <br>I think most people look down on anime, so when a show tries they immediately dismiss it as retarded.</br>  <br><br>From a societal perspective it can be used to instill fear in people with a normal hue, making them more obedient.<br><br>From the authors perspective, it highlights the blind trust the detectives give the Sibyl system. This in turn contrasts with the moment when the main character finds out the truth behind the Sibyl, which consists of a collection of asymptomatic people with the ability to judge anyone to die a gruesome death.<br><br>And also because it's fucking cool.<br><br> RISARU ERIMINE-TA <br><br> *SPLAT* </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  100 hours in paint later  <br>I just got to that part</br>  <br>Because it's lethal mode, not potentially survivable mode. If you're going to kill someone, do it in a way where they can't possibly survive it.</br>  <br><br> tfw you will never get beaten up by Akane </br></br>  <br>Damn I should have renamed it to "CAUSE I FEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEL"</br>  <br>[Ohys-Raws] fits for the subs</br>  <br>since when her boobs that big?</br>  <br>Angle maybe, also likely she's not wearing a bra during training, and her breats don't stand out too much during work either in her uniform.</br>   Kirito not mentioned at all in this movie <br>top fucking kek</br>  <br>Plus we've seen her naked in the showers and her breasts are still small</br>  Why am I getting random laggs while watching this? Like the cpu usage suddenly spikes to 80%+ with all players I' ve tried.  Ironically the 2 years outdated vlc player is the most stable.   <br>Because it's very efficient. I bet they thought of having the body leftovers reused for something for a true utilitarian society but decided it was too cruel.</br>  <br>It's on your end.<br>check is you're up to date</br></br>  <br>Fuck, thanks.</br>  <br>I've had the same, did it happen during the OP?</br>  I like how when Mika starts talkin shit at the end Akane just looks at her and is like "k" and just goes on with her job.  <br>Those cucks literally ripped off Loopers poster</br>    <br> Looper created the double exposure effect. <br><br>Anon, please.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a very common visual style, Anon</br>  <br>gotta stay true to its roots right</br>  <br>Yeah, as expecting akane talking about him with kogami<br>Guess uro didn't like 8 dominator man</br></br>  Movie felt kind of pointless. Kogami didn't really do anything besides kill a man who explicitly didn't matter, and the evil military was going to get wrekt eventually. Akane got Sybil to get the mandate of the people, but what does that really matter when the end result is the same as what was going to happen normally?  <br><br>But its got people with guns doing a worried look</br></br>  <br>are you this naive?</br>  <br>Don't know but I'm not complaining.</br>  <br> but what does that really matter when the end result is the same as what was going to happen normally? <br>Akane was just trying to be   cybil about it  </br></br>  <br>The movie was written before S2. Ubukata got the script of the movie and from that he wrote S2.<br>Not sure why noitaminA decided to do both at once.<br><br><br>I expected to dislike the movie, I read all the spoilers too, but the lack of a conclusive ending doesn't matter if you can enjoy the content of the movie. <br>They could always switch it around, but for now Sibyl is what the people want and it will continue winning.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akane is on Team Sybil, Anon.<br><br>When the revolution starts to take it down, she'll be the final boss.</br></br></br>  I really hope they don't forget the part about the terrorist group attacking japan.  <br> The visual styling was there (and with a movie budget) <br>sometimes I wasn't so sure about that, when I look at this background</br></br>  <br>In S3*</br>  <br>S2 was to introduce Mika, another person who found out about Sybil. She was to be another contrast/foil to Akane. Kougami seesk to destroy the Sybil System, Mika works under Sybil while Akane is in between and works with Sybil.</br>   Kougami seesk to destroy the Sybil System <br>No he doesn't.</br>   the gun starts infodumping shit <br>wtf</br>  <br>The thing with Akane and Kougami is that they pretty much agree on everything except for what to do about it.</br>  <br>Anon, all the parallels made between him and Makishima wasn't just for show. He needs a prey and it's quite clear from the final minute of the movie, he intends to make Sybil that prey.</br>  Why did everyone keep shooting at the drones and whatnot with their rifles throughout the movie when it was clear that they weren't penetrating?  <br>They were probably hoping it hits one of its vulnerable spots like its sensors or something. A soft kill is more than enough given the situation.</br>  <br>Poor direction.<br><br>Honestly, I really liked the movie but the direction for the battles were shit.<br><br>It's the typical nonsense of people standing in line in an open field firing at drones that don't take any damage. There are plenty of thick stone walls to get behind.<br><br>They also apparently received training and advisory to take down bots.<br><br>In the same vein, attacks are all frontal with shonen style dodging and the cliche "running with arms behind your back" nonsense.<br><br>Gino, I believe is his name, rushed an opponent to disarm him, in an open field, just so he could shoot him. He could have done that from a distance.<br><br><br>It's style over substance.<br><br>That said I finally got what I wanted out of this movie, acknowledging the outside world exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When did Akane get a fucking penthouse?   Sybil was a classical utilitarianist the entire time <br>That bastard.<br><br>No, she'd flip the moment they present her with a legitimate alternative. She'd try and be diplomatic about it though.<br><br>She's the most experienced surviving inspector they have, I'd imagine it pays well.</br></br></br></br></br>  And a nice pair of cushions to boot.  Did anyone else really like the soundtrack for the movie? I was really loving it.  Is Sibyl lying about Mika's psycho pass/hue? I find it hard to believe that she isn't a latent criminal yet.  <br>Mika did nothing wrong, maybe if Akane wasn't a shit to work with she'd be friendlier. Even Div3 disliked Akane</br>  <br>Apparently Yayoi is good at table tennis  :3 </br>    <br>They completely broke her, though. We're talking old man dick in an NTR doujin levels of broken.</br>  <br>Knowing the Illuminati on a brain to face basis probably gets you tons of perks</br>    I wonder if his boipussy is still virginal.  i bet charmain han has rektd ittttt    <br>Akane is actually the king of 1v1s. <br><br>1v1'd Shogo IRL and won<br><br>1v1'd Tougane IRL and won<br><br>1v1'd Kogami IRL and won<br><br>Granted, she won by being a dirty dirty cheater, but she still won.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember that someone broke into her house in S2? I guess she didn't want to stay there</br>  L-elf Sama was right!<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/119427<wbr>301/#119427824</wbr></br></br>  <br>Nah she has great instinct, and knew how to act so Sybil wouldn't leave her at the mercy of Dracula</br>  <br> That filename </br>  <br> I'm the best <br> Simply... the best </br></br>  <br>Anon, her final scene in S2 was practically ripped from 1984. She got fucked.</br>  So does she even want to bring him back?  <br> Akane got Sybil to get the mandate of the people, but what does that really matter when the end result is the same as what was going to happen normally? <br>People want to be subjected to a higher power in order to be protected. They're wiling to take away their freedoms for the illusion of peace, that's the message. And it also matters because it helps to define Akane's character, she is not against Sibyl per se, she is against forcing philosophies on society.</br></br>  This movie wraps tidily all the bigs problems with Psycho Pass.<br>Is a really interesting premise ruined by a lack of ability of the writers: Uroshit and NoName don't know how to write for a living, don't know how to make a complex character, don't know how to take advantage of an amazing world.<br>So, we got a lot of bits of scattered ideas here and there through some weak free association of words: insert books, authors, cultural legacies, and you have people discussing deep topics but completely ignoring the film (anime), while they believe that the film (anime) has more complexity than what it already possesses.<br>Then you have an almost 115 minutes movie, and we spent 90 minutes on a setting that doesn't wrap itself at the end; during the last part the characters have to explain again the premise.<br>The way they decide how to deliver information is another problem.They are obsessed with remind us that Akane is the only one character. Instead of making the Enforcers talk about how Shamballa works: what would Gino or Yayoi say about living with the necklace? Why won't they make the rest of the characters discuss about politics, instead of making sensei delivers the info as a Wikipedia page? I want a two hours movie with Akane discussing with her team about these topics while they drink.<br>Also, Kougami looked more like an A-Team dude than a hard boiled detective.<br><br>tl, dr: I want to suck Gino to end of the world.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Read it closer and stop being a weeaboo. He's not saying it should matter to them. <br>He's just saying the Engrish is grating to listen to for him (as it is to some other English speakers) and stating a preference. The fact that most Japanese don't care doesn't change our perspective or personal preferences.</br></br>  <br>Best character, I loved her big personality.</br>     dat tech porn <br> mfw I want to buy MW3 right now <br>I need more drones.<br> ending <br>I don't want IT'S AMERICA FAULT in S3</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't want IT'S AMERICA FAULT in S3 <br>Huh? How does the ending have anything to do with America?</br></br>  <br>Her presence was felt.</br>  <br> implying this isn't AW with the walking tank <br><br>Oh yea,<br>I wonder do they have HYPER OATS in the Ward</br></br></br></br>  I couldn't be the only one who wanted Akane and Kogami to fight, right?<br><br>That brief scuffle of theirs was hype</br></br>  <br>He walked through an illusion. Am I missing something?</br>  If s3 happens, I'd like if they let Akane take a backseat this time. I think that continuing this one-man show would get seriously stale. Other characters don't even feel necessary, if only for making Akane look better in comparision.  <br>I'm still waiting for them to have angry sex</br>  <br>The fight ends in the sex, which progresses from angry hatesex to tender loving.</br>  <br>The side characters get LNs. Even the gook hacker gets one with Kagari. The anime has always been more about akane and Kougami. I'm not sure if they're willing to change that dynamic.</br>  <br>The only reason I watch the show is because of Akane and I'm pretty sure many people would lose interest if someone else took focus (can you imagine Shimotsuki as MC?)</br>  <br>It will take some god-tier writing to make Mika likable again. If they're going to create a whole cour focusing on one character, it would be Kogami, probably before he became an enforcer.</br>  <br> this will never happen <br>Fuck you urobuchi</br></br>  <br>I'm more than okay with this.</br>   the fucking Engrish <br>jesus christ this is worse than zankyou no terror</br>  <br>Oooh, that would be some delicious irony, given what she said about the SEAUn situation.</br>   babies first dystopia <br>At least the production values are pretty good.</br>  Funi's bringing the movie to western theaters in 2016.

Nobody in Japan has xbone <br>Now I'm even more confused</br></br></br></br>  <br> working out and showering with Kougami <br>GOTY<br>Reminder that you can import the English Hong Kong version since Xbone is region-free.</br></br></br>  <br>First season ≥ movie &gt; shit &gt; second season<br>The movie lacked most of the detective elements that helped define psycho pass.</br></br>  <br>Phil Spencer threw money at Urobutcher. That's how it happened.</br>  <br>Nothing can save the xbone in Japan, nothing. Not even idols fighting Pokemon in Gundams.</br>  <br>Yeah, but I think that's probably just a timed exclusive<br>Nothing, I mean nothing can save xbone in japan. It's over. sony and nintendo has won in nippon.</br></br>  <br>It's increasingly common to have America or one of their ABC agencies to be the final boss in anime, especially if the setting is based on Earth. But I doubt Urobuchi would actually do that since I think he's somewhat of a westaboo.</br>  <br><br><br>I updated MPC, madVR, and XySubFilter, still doesn't work, can't open this file</br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty ded anon<br>http://www.afterdawn.com/news/artic<wbr>le.cfm/2015/07/26/the-japanese-just<wbr>-do-not-want-the-xbox-one</wbr></wbr></br></br>  Not bad after the failure that was Season 1.  <br>Mages/5pb have always deployed their VNs on the xbox. But I guess P-P is pretty popular. <br>Xbone sales are dismal in Japan, it only managed to sell like 58k so far. <br>P-P is 8th when it comes to Xbone game sales in Japan.<br>The box office gross puts the movie in the top 10 for late-night anime.<br>There are also plenty of side material, like LNs(9) and manga(3).<br><br>Don't know about merch sales.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  As someone who loved season 1, should I even bother with season two and/or the movie, or pretend they don't exist?  <br>I haven't watched second season but the movie was okay.</br>  <br><br>The movie is just as good as S1 and S2.<br>You shouldn't watch it if you're a drone</br></br></br>  <br>Movie was great, I really enjoyed it. <br>S2 is meh. Some good ideas, but the execution is not there.</br></br>  <br> S2 is meh <br>That's an understatement, it was a complete mess.</br></br>  <br><br>So was S1. Prefering it over S2 makes you a hypocritical fanboy.</br></br>  <br><br>Even if you're so open about your brain damage, it doesn't make me want to believe you.</br></br>  <br>This movie was so underwhelming, like s2 in movie form. I mean Akane and Kogami meet and fucking NOTHING happened. She gave him some fucking smokes, instead of telling him how much she missed him.</br>  This Engrish is really starting to grate now.  So i watched the first season 2 years ago and I was planning on watching the 2nd season when BDs came out. but now i don't think i will. Should i watch the movie? do you need to have watched S2?  <br>Forgot image, this guy sounds like he's had a stroke.</br>  so where is the movie placed chronologically?<br>Is it after or before the second season?</br>  <br>Daemon Spade</br>  <br>Don't bully Joseph, he tried his best.</br>  <br>After.</br>  <br>Forgot picture.</br>  <br>do you need to watch S2 to understand it?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>No, not really. Just if you want more about the enforcers.</br>  <br>OH NOOOO<br>OH MY GAH<br>OH SHIT<br>SON OF A BITCH</br></br></br></br>  <br>All that training of shouting oh my god obviously didn't pay off.</br>   mfw when this kicked in the finale <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QGh<wbr>UfhQ-_PI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  I can't fucking handle this Engrish. What a huge fucking mistake they made.  So who sent those faggots in the beginning of the movie to Japan? Nicholas Wong?  <br>They never found out</br>  <br>Unshou Ishizuka has a storied tradition of gratuitous Engrish.</br>  <br>Best baseball episode ever.</br>  <br><br>Probably Sibyl was somehow responsible.<br>Remember Mika at the end said they just needed an excuse to send Akane away.</br></br></br>  I fucking hope that we will get a season 3 in which Akane can finally jump on Kougami and tear off his clothes. That girl has to be way too fired up to be able to contain herself anymore.  <br> Mfw akane and Shinya finally get a moment of peace alone <br> about to head to the bedroom to finally fuck <br> Mika interrupts them <br>Blue balls for all eternity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They pizza her and proceed.</br>  http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>16893<br>Yet another version is out.</br></wbr>  <br>Blimey 10gigs</br>  <br>More like they knew Akane would eventually figure out it was related to SEAun and would've requested to go there, actually figure everything out and ruin their plans. They cut her off by showing her a picture of Kougami so she would be distracted from their actual target, Chairman Han. They were probably improvising after the terrorist attack.</br>    start watching the anonsubs torrent <br><br>  the subtitles don't match what they;re saying in engrish <br><br>not sure if trollsub</br></br></br></br>  <br>engrish =/= english<br>It's a translation so it makes sense to an english-speaking viewer.</br></br>  <br>he had to adapt son</br>  <br> mika <br> getting pizza'd <br>You get the point though, right? Urobuchi is bound and determined to keep them from getting laid. The audience's tears keep him youthful and full of vigor.<br>Although it would be interesting to see how them fucking would affect the story, especially if they got caught. Sex scandal of the fucking century, it would be like Mika got Christmas early.</br></br></br></br>   Mika is still insufferable after all that's happened   <br>Don't worry, she will get a good beating in s3</br>  Someone should just tell butcher on twitter to have Kogami and Akane fuck in S3.  <br><br>the English in the movie actually seems okay as far as the script is concerned<br><br>of course the pronunciation is lol</br></br></br></br>  <br>The speech at the beginning was from a Proust translation I found online, because, while I could identify the passage that was being quoted, I could only make out bits and pieces of what was being said in the dialogue.<br><br>I did something similar with Rutaganda's Franz Fanon quote, but finding the actual passage he was quoting helped me to piece together his Engrish. No such luck for that quote at the beginning of the movie, though.</br></br></br>  Will this finally motivate you faggots to start scanning the last 4+ years' worth of doujins?  <br>Boobs was great shut up</br>  <br>If anything she became even more insufferable. That speech on the helipad was grade A bitch talk.</br>  <br>The Proust thing was odd   but English is not my first language, so I can be wrong  </br>  <br>I dunno, I think Zankyou no Terror made me immune to all but the worst Engrish. <br><br><br>Well, the big gun might come as a surprise to you and you'll be wondering why Akane's fellow Inspector is such a bitch, but other than that - No.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've encoutnered a lot worse. I usually hate Engrish, but there was something endearing about the Engrish in this movie. That and the fact that the movie didn't use translators as a crutch nor pretend that Japanese could ever be a global language. <br><br><br>It was meh, but it's not as bad as /a/ makes it out to be. On an episode by episode basis it's fairly shit alright, but as a cohesive whole it's actually a decent watch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As good as S2 maybe, but S1 stands tall above both its sequel and the movie.<br><br><br> Nothing, I mean nothing can save xbone in japan. It's over. sony and nintendo has won in nippon. <br>What makes things worse is that the Xbone squandered the respectable fanbase that the 360 had built up in Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  What the fuck was the point of that mercenary? <br><br>I get that he was a glorified jobber and they wanted to reference shougou's character archetype. But WHY did they give him a gratutious postcolonial agenda just to get his shit kicked in in the end? Do 11s hate franz fanon? Do they just not realize how stupid and racist it makes the whole subplot seem? Are they still asspained about the political and ideological failure of the Japanese new left in the 1970s? <br><br>I get the feeling that this film was never meant to be seen by foreigners.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forget that Steins;Gate was originally released on the Xbox 360 of all things. Money talks.<br><br><br>I advise you to binge rewatch season 2. It works much better like that than watching it as it aired did.</br></br></br></br>  Which are the best subs as of right now?  <br> worse than zankyou no terror <br>No it's not. I have yet to encounter engrish worse than that abomination. <br><br><br>I should probably read the LNs in that case.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only reason I watch the show is because of Akane <br>Really? Like she's grand and all, but watching the show just for her?<br><br><br>Mika is a lost cause - the sacrificial lamb for the grand finale. Not that anybody will care. She belongs to Sibyl now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gook hacker <br><br>Do you mean the blonde haired dyke or someone else?</br></br></br>  <br> mfw I want to buy MW3 right now <br>MW3 had a fun campaign by modern COD standards.<br><br><br>The show was really spelling it out for us, just in case the retards at the back thought he was actually alive.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Honestly, I really liked the movie but the direction for the battles were shit. <br>Yeah, I didn't really feel the hype during the action scenes. Like, it looked nice, but the direction was shit and the music didn't help.<br><br><br>Recently.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well they certainly became irrelevant fast in the movie,<br><br><br>Yeah, even the movie seems ashamed of S2 (even though it was probably on par with it all things considered). <br><br>They referenced their big auld gun though. They're not letting us forget about that macguffin any time soon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Anon subs were the only ones available?<br><br><br>But Akane is pure.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yeah, even the movie seems ashamed of S2 <br><br>As mediocre as it was, S2 is still part of PP canon. It had the same director as the movie and Butcher/Fukami provided a scenario for the season.</br></br></br>    <br>Well nobody's denying that, but S2 brought very little to the table in terms of overall canon.</br>  <br>They get to expand on his backstory more apparently.</br>  How much sexual tension really is there between Kougami and Akane?  <br>Are you seriously trying to defend the logic of half-baked 80s-esque battle scenes? All the mooks were basically storm troopers ready to be cut down by whatever because that's the easiest to animate and it follows in the vein of older action films.<br><br>That scene that unecessarily cut between the chopper drone and each shot of it blowing apart its victims was rubbish. It was clear all four people getting mowed down was to occur in the same cut, but it was padded out in like 6 cuts which ruined the flow and didn't make sense in a real situation.</br></br></br>  <br>She respects Kogami too much to just hamstring him and take him home.</br>  <br>She should just take what she wants</br>  <br>But why didn't they do the sex?</br>  <br>Maybe they don't want to have sex.</br>  <br>it would cloud her hue</br>    <br> Butcher/Fukami provided a scenario for the season. <br><br>No, Ubukata wrote S2. <br><br><br> Mika is a lost cause - the sacrificial lamb for the grand finale. Not that anybody will care. She belongs to Sibyl now. <br><br>I think she can be a great character if used well, the concept behind her character is interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  In Psycho Pass universe, the more you read the stronger you are.  <br>A good example for children.</br>  <br>Books are for nerds</br>  <br>Yeah he wrote it, but Butcher was still responsible for the general outline of the season. It was the same as A/Z. He just gives a barebones outline and the Boku no Pico guy just wrote what he thought would fit that outline.</br>  <br>That's a proper size for a 1080p release of a movie.</br>  Have you ever been to a Japanese bookstore? The books referenced in the show have Psycho-Pass advertisement sleeves.  <br>Its the .flac that gave the size tho</br>  <br>Sasuga, Urobutcher</br>  <br>Every time it plays, you know it will be great.<br><br>I love the OST<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-cn<wbr>ly0dodeI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WDF<wbr>MBtmkmHI</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0-j<wbr>uGBuyY0A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>If it encourage people to read I find it great.</br>  <br>Shougo literally spelled it out for you.</br>  The movie makes me want to see a S3.  <br>That's a good thing<br>fuck stem nerds and their dicksucking shits</br></br>  <br>It accomplished nothing, but Kogami needed to feel like he was doing something.<br><br>He'll probably go after Sybil eventually just because he can.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> s1 had beethoven <br> s2 had nessum dorma <br>i bet my left nut we getting mozart next</br></br></br>  Did anyone upload the SP features portion? I really want to see the location scouting documentary.  <br>Maybe some Rachmaninoff ?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M_V<wbr>CbnqbwwA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>It will happen. I wouldn't be surprised if there's an announcement before 2015 is over given how PP keeps printing money and seems to be a stable source of sales for NoitaminA.</br>  <br>I don't remember any of these being referenced. Difference Engine doesn't seem to have anything to do with Psycho Pass but maybe they included it since it's also by Gibson and Neuromancer has some connection to Psycho Pass.</br>  <br>I kinda feel happy if some people pick these books after watching PP. At least tries to encourage reading, and not only the manga or the LN.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q0z<wbr>08OpmEPc</wbr>  [ ]<br>And pic.<br>Anyone ?</br></br>  <br>It's almost as though they were animated by the same production company!</br>  <br>So much this, anything to make people read makes me heart feel good.</br>  <br>Every character pointing a dominator in shogo's direction is beyond cheesy. It's really really awful.</br>  <br>Dominators don't work on him anyway.<br>It's like pointing a watergun.</br></br>  <br>Heh, I find it kinda funny. It's like, "Read these books and become enlightened! Then the system cannot judge you no matter how hard it tries!"</br>  <br>The is symbolism if you look who is with black and who is with white background.</br>  <br>I'm just complaining about the aesthetic. It's a really awful design choice.</br>  <br>Not really. If he did the outline, he would be given the series composition credit. He wasn't. The chief director for S1 and the movie and Butcher were given credit as "supervisor". Which means almost nothing given how Ubukata is Butcher's favorite writer and he would have agreed to anything. <br><br>For A.Z that's just Aoki bullshiting. Uro is credited as creator and with writing 3 episodes, which means he only came up with the setting and wrote the first 3 episodes, whatever draft butcher came up with was changed. Otherwise he would be credited with Series composition.</br></br></br>  Wait he was actually called Chairman Chuwan Han?  <br>Did they just paste photos like that as backgrounds ?</br>  <br>Also, that's a sexy lamp.</br>  The movie accomplished nothing, but the transitions between Inspector Tsunemori and Akane ga Kill were quite enjoyable  <br>I think they're just included because Urobuchi is a big Gibson fan, he mentioned that in an interview for the Kikokugai remake.<br>I bet if he got to do that steampunk series that he wanted, it would be heavily influenced by The difference engine.</br></br>  <br>According to this Butcher was Story Planner and Scenario director.<br><br>http://otakumode.com/news/53a9284cb<wbr>34924a633000129/Tow-Ubukata-Joins-S<wbr>taff-of-Psycho-Pass-2-as-Series-Com<wbr>poser-Gen-Urobuchi-Continues-as-Sto<wbr>ry-Planner-and-Scenario-Director</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Considering how vastly different the background material for A/Z was compared to the actual show, it was clear Uro's contribution to the anime was minimal at best.</br>  <br>Would you say that you love lamp?</br>  <br>Why he needs two fedora ?</br>  <br>That doesn't make a lot of sense. If Ubukata is credited as series composer, and Urobuchi is credited as scenario director, how does he fit exactly? sounds like the same position to me.<br><br>Butcher and S1 chief director were only credited as "planning supervisor". I think they just made a mistake.</br></br></br>  <br>Can I watch the movie without seeing the second season?</br>  <br>yes</br>  Akane looks too much like the chick from prison school now that I've actually read it... I really feel like she should be a Dominatrix right now   Akane and Kougami finally meets <br> They spent the night at the same room, but different beds <br> mfw Akane stood up and walked up to something <br> I thought she's going to go over to Kougami's bed and start it <br> mfw she walked down the stairs <br> Kougami's face when <br><br>The sexual tension between these two is rising. If S3 doesn't at least feature a sex scene between these two I'm going to get blue balls.<br><br>Also, Mika got an upgrade from a rank B bitch to rank A bitch. I wonder if S3 is going to involve her getting her brains splattered by Kougami when she badmouths Akane.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe she'll put down kogami, like she did with  her grandma </br>  What the fuck happened to the plot point of Kamui making people artificially clear in S2?  Someone quick make an updated chart for the movie, those great.  Wait is it just me or is Togane alive and well?  <br>kamui got his group judgment and darkman killed him afterwards</br>  <br>I was referring to the method.</br>  Holy shit who thought it was a good idea to have the movie be 40% terribre engrish?  <br>no, both togane got killed at the end of s2</br>  <br>He's a good talker anon, beyond that its either drugs or straight up magic</br>  <br>Reference, anon? I forgot this scene in S2.</br>  <br>I could have sworn that was him in the first confrontation</br>  <br>Holy shit who thought it was a good idea to get a trip?</br>  <br>Don't bully tripfriends.</br>  What?<br><br>when did she get busty?<br><br>what the hell?</br></br></br></br>  <br>no bra plus close up+angle</br>   no moe   <br>She is a big girl.</br>  <br>I want Kogami to fuck Mika at full force. while Akane watches.</br>  <br>Update CCCP<br><br>I managed to get it to play but it lags the fuck out. I don't have this problem with anything else. Does this have a very high bitrate or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you still use codecs in 2015 when Lav filter is integrated ?</br>  Well this really wasn't that great. I don't think I'll take a single thing away from this movie.  <br>Gino and Big Tits were great.</br>  <br> From a societal perspective it can be used to instill fear in people with a normal hue, making them more obedient. <br>Seriously, those MP dudes at the end fucking shit themselves when they watched their boss explode. Shit works like a charm.</br></br>   Army personnel wares collars <br>That seems problematic</br>  <br>So they can't make a coup against their own leader.</br>  <br>Or fight... <br><br>they should have been killed by the collars while firing on the terrorist</br></br></br>  <br>Did you not watch the whole movie?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>Did you skip the part where they falsified their psycho pass.?</br>  <br>What  said.<br><br>Almost all of them had really high criminal co-coefficients. They was tricking the system by making it so Sybil didn't read people marked as "friend" in their friend-or-foe ID system. <br><br>Now, the real question is, did Sybil really know what was up, or was Mika just deluded and convinced herself that Sybil MUST have known and it was all part of its plan to go along with it so they could kill them all at once all along.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean season 2 right?</br>  <br>Sybil knew, it was all part of the keikaku.<br><br>It needed a local force to establish Its extension and ensured full control by using a chairman double + collars in case of revolt/insubordination.</br></br></br>  <br>a little bit of both</br>  So Kougami will die at the hand of Akane right? They've been foreshadowing it since s1    <br> If S3 doesn't at least feature a sex scene between these two I'm going to get blue balls. <br><br>  Implying Akame isn't a robot </br></br></br>  <br>Robots need love too.</br>  <br><br>Akame won't be able to love once she becomes the replacement for Sybil</br></br>  <br> Great  taste.</br>  Help I'm retarded. The video keeps breaking up and lagging at the beginning and I don't know how to fix  <br>Either update your codecs or stop trying to play things encoded with x265 on your toaster.</br>  So the plot of the movie was<br> Sybil thinks it would be fun to overthrow a government and test Sybil  <br> Sybil knows Akane will be a pain in the ass so they send her out  <br> Sybil decides okay fuck it we're exposed time to real things in <br> Sybil agrees to Democracy because Akane is annoying  <br> Mika continues to be a cunt </br></br></br></br></br>   people spelling it Sybil   <br> &gt;Sybil agrees to Democracy because Akane is annoying <br>"agrees" to "democracy"</br></br>  Were the backgrounds of Psychopass always this awful?  Was an ok popcorn movie but still I'm disappointed, wasn't terrible but just mediocre for Psycho-Pass (S1 was pretty good for TV anime anyway). Lots of unnecessary talking heads. Obviously English was awful. Seemed more fanservice than a legitimate sequel, similar to the Madokes movie, I guess that's Urobushit for you.  I'm going to watch this now, I'll be back in an hour and half.  <br> Sybil agrees to Democracy because Akane is annoying <br><br>Did you see the after credits?</br></br></br>  <br> Takes place in Korea -&gt; India <br> They talk English <br><br>que?</br></br></br></br>  <br>This<br>Though the army thing wasn't obligatory criminal asymptomatism, it was obligatory group of people cheating the system.<br><br><br>Wasn't it a random mix of Asian shit? I think I saw some Thai writing and they have Chinese names.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He has the popular support I see nothing wrong with it</br>  <br>someone shop Levar Burton on this nigga. Psycho Pass is already pretty much Reading Rainbow the anime.</br>  <br>It was a mix of mostly SEA and non-Japanese East Asian countries, and geographically wasn't remotely close to Korea. Why would they not speak English when most of them couldn't speak to each other in their native tongues?</br>  <br><br>I swear she will become a brain at the end</br></br>  <br>Cambodia/ASEAN</br>  <br>It's like you didn't even watch the film.</br>  <br><br>Why do people hate Mika again? Everything she has said was right and the people who are right should always be listened to and taken seriously.</br></br>  <br>He had 40%, depending on how many people ran that my be a lot, but that isn't a majority.<br>More over the people voting voting for him aren't going to get him, any former ideals or values he formerly had are now, "1)We implement the Sybil system, 2)We Hypah Oats, 3)...., 4) this place becomes just like Japan"</br></br>  <br>People always have hate her</br>  <br>But I like her anon. In fact, I made her my one and only true waifu.</br>  <br>I questioned my sexuality before today. But now I am undeniably gay.</br>  <br>He turned me into blue balls.</br>  Anyone getting a feeling reminiscent of GitS from the first ten minutes of this movie?  Psycho-Pass the Movie is better than Ghost in the Shell!  Based  <br>How accurate is that? I laughed when it came up.</br>  <br>Of course she knows it was all part of the plan. She's Sibyls bitch and does their work now.<br><br>This is pretty much the only thing I was surprised to be retained from season 2.  Still love her <br><br>Now i'm left wondering why Kogami was smiling. Is he overjoyed at having to fight the Sibyl System retaking control? Or is he going to take that shota under his wing and teach him the glorious honor of terrorism?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Once Sibyl takes over the world it will be transformed into a new being by the Divine Order <br> Sibyl is Star God Polaris <br> Makisihima is revived as her alien henchman. </br></br></br>  I couldn't recognize his voice from engrish   they use indon name <br> tfw they actually latent criminal <br>i cringed hard at this scene</br></br>  <br>If only darkie red misted this fucking cunt with his robot arm.</br>  <br> All these latent criminals as a group working together <br> Sibyl can judge groups now. <br>Shame season 2 botched that idea pretty badly.</br></br></br>  This will probably be a case where you'll have to default to the dub because of some stupid fucking decision.  <br>Kind of wish that they incorporated an ounce of American writing in there and had Kogami plow her. "Blondie go take care of nihonjin over there."</br>  <br>Kogami's only into women and Makishima.<br><br>The guy whose death set him on the hunt for his favorite prey was just a bromance thing.</br></br></br>  T-tachikoma? Is that you?  <br>She needs to be around for season 3  where it's revealed she's criminally asymptomatic and uses her newfound role as Kaisei to lord over Akane even more. </br>  <br>Not anymore. Can't let the robots have sentience or they might start thinking the Sibyl system is fucked up.</br>   Movie where the Dub will probably be better than the Sub <br><br>Never thought I'd see the day</br></br>  Why did the whole movie make Kougami look like a faggot?  <br> holding his own against cybernetically enhances black ops agents <br> Is more or less leading a revolution <br> Sniping bitches <br> Waifu still so thirsty she went to war zone for him <br> Even when his revolution fails in an election that might have been rigged he keep fighting against the Sybil system <br><br>Nah he was a faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nice meme.  <br>He's a hound. He hunts in order to get off on killing his prey.</br>  <br>You know he was getting his jollies watching that kid train to be a loyal terrorist one day.<br><br>Starting his own pack.</br></br></br>  <br>You miss the point of Kougami's character.<br><br>This movie completely destroyed Kougami's character in S1 and just made him some one-faceted rambo faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>It's survival of the fittest. He's just decided to put his nature to good use to help others.<br><br>Even Makishima questioned what he would do when he no longer had prey to hunt and look what happens. He goes for the fight against Sibyl and becomes obsessed with killing an unimportant black man.</br></br></br>  <br>Psycho Pass was never a good written anime. I want to see Psycho Pass Gundam where they take over the world with the sibil system now.</br>   all this Shogo wanking <br> no mention of Kamui at all <br><br>Kamui was a better villain than Shogo but gen is too butthurt to acknowledge him</br></br></br>  Was this supposed to be a baptism or something?  <br>Chinglish might actually be believable as a global language in this setting since they say japan is the only state that doesn't look like somalia in the world.</br>  <br>"look how much booze we get bro"<br><br>Or it was a pissbottle.</br></br></br>  <br>It is probably some sort of initiation ritual, the other bounty hunter seemed very upset as soon as it was tossed to the big black man like he knew what that meant was coming.</br>  <br>We got Mika being a haughty bitch and doing Sibyls dirty work.<br><br>Clearly Gen knows who the real villain of season 2 is. She even got away with aiding in Akanes grandmothers murder.</br></br></br>  <br>Makishima is edgy but the other guy just cried for his mommy or something</br>   democracy <br> good <br><br>Is Sybil retarded or is Gen just an idiot?</br></br></br>  <br> 8dominator vs HYPER OATS <br><br>are you a commie</br></br></br>  <br>No that was one of Sibyls enforcer lapdogs who wanted to fuck his mommy and she was one of the brains.<br><br>Him and mummy died, but he realized MIka will be an even greater minion than himself.<br><br><br>Frankensteins monster had a personality disorder from so many people inside him and pushed Akane out of the way so only he would become pizza and smiled towards her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  what did i miss in the second season  <br>Killing off all the wacky new enforcers, leaving the most boring 2 alive.</br>  <br>When has gen ever handle "mature concepts" in great depth? it's cheap fiction<br><br><br>-the girl being a bitch<br>-brains can't judge other brains<br>-all is clam all is bright</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8dominator?</br>  Is it good ?  <br>Frankensteins Monster<br>Akane planning her operation to become Kogami<br>Villain with mommy issues. Enforcer<br>Kaisei is based on the villain with mommy issues mommy, and is also her brain.<br>Mika is a huge bitch. Helps villain with mommy issues. Thinks Akane is inferior. Lives in denial of all the terrible shit she does so she can flaunt how superior she is.<br>Sibyl being able to judge groups and melting some of their own brains to evolve.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the running joke with kamui<br>his plan required 8 dominators so he could find the system</br></br>  <br>This.<br>It's "Sibyl" people. Get it right.</br></br>  How many more psycho pass animations do you think they'll do?   Mika still left unpushined   Did Yayoi have a single line this entire movie  Who here got dirty thoughts when Mika was being smug on screen  <br>Nothing more, this shit is finished.</br>  <br>Mika would be the best girl if it wasn't for her shit attitude.</br>        <br>Oh THIS guy.<br><br>He was hilarious, like a bond villain.</br></br></br>  <br><br>To be fair, it may just be one of those idealist admissions that while there aren't any better solutions, the fact remains that denying human choice is some fundamental problem that shouldn't be tolerated.</br></br>  <br>This. <br>Makishima was just a pretentious hipster that could only name drop and quote other people instead of embracing actual free thought or coming up with his own ideas. <br><br>Kamui, at least at the beginning of S2, was the better villain by far. It was too bad they ruined him with bad writing and by putting him in such a shit season.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of HYPER OATS<br>How do they work?</br></br>  <br>Yeah but Kamui didn't have Makishimartial Arts, also he didn't personally challenge Akane as much really. Kamui was least direct and antagonist to the main protagonists.</br>  <br><br>How was Kamui better?<br><br><br><br>Well, I'd imagine it'd be similar to the way corn has been turned into a number of artificial substitutes in a wide variety of foods. With enough experimentation on different crops, it'd be possible to eventually develop a broad application crop that can fulfill any number of roles.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have kinda mixed feelings about the film. It was definitely less retarded than the second season, but on the other hand, it didn't feel very meaningful either. It was clearly an Akane-Kougami movie, so I guess it's understandable that the rest of the cast was ignored, but even the lead duo didn't get any development. Neither really questions the other's views, much less their own. <br> googami ur like makishimapan now <br> lel okay <br> come home <br> no <br> then don't <br><br>It's just blatantly saying they're going to milk this with more sequels, so can't do anything drastic now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want real robot psycho pass</br>  I dont understand...I downloaded the 1080 version and is not working...what should I do...pls help  <br> ...x2 </br>  <br>I thought it was making good progress towards an actual Akane vs Kogami scenario. Seems like the final dilemma will be Akane, who believes Sibyl can be reformed into a decent government vs Kogami who would rather abolish it altogether and create something new.</br>  Hey they don't forget this dominator.  <br> hyped up to be satan incarnate with the highest criminal coefficient ever recorded, and working up a sinister plan behind the scenes <br><br> just turns out to be a momma's boy with a gratuitous puppy-killing scene <br><br>Why did the writers do this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's straight from mgs</br>  <br>see<br><br>It's more like the more you quote and namedrop stuff that you've read, the stronger you are.</br></br></br>  can this fucking file work like a normal file where you just download it and thats it? Fucking nerds you have to over complicate everything, thats why you will never have a girlfriend.  <br><br> That's straight from season 2 <br><br>FTFY.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamui was never really against Akane. His goal was to change society in some way that he felt would make it better. Sibyl killing some of its brains was enough for him.<br><br><br>We got to see Mika go back to being a full time bitch, SIbyl manipulating their way to world domination, and Kogami getting his own shota.<br><br>Everything worked out all things considered.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> download [720p] torrent from nyaa <br> download subs torrent <br> run torrents <br> open mkv video in mpc-hc media player <br> file-&gt;load subs <br> ???? <br> profit <br><br>Also, does anyone know where I can find the OST for the movie? Doesn't seem like it's up on nyaa.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He really wanted to fuck his momma. The idea of Sibyl taking her away from him caused him to slit her throat. She made him emotionally dependent on her to the point it ruined the attempts to artificially grow and raise new brains.</br>  <br><br>Don't forget his genius masterplan that he spent the whole series devicing.<br><br> Analyze a person's every move, pretend to be their friend and stealthily recording their hue for a year to figure out how to make them mad <br> I know! I'll murder someone they love! Damn I'm so smart, it's not like any random street punk could've come up with that! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It nearly worked too if it wasn't for that meddling walking transplant!</br>  <br>Well Akane is special since she can control herself better than most people.</br>  <br>But even her had to get kamui'ed before edgy mommy boy almost killed her</br>  <br>Yeah but wouldn't he have a clue just from reading her files, or hell his past years of experience driving Inspectors insane?<br><br> Hmm what's this on her file, her Psycho-pass went up when she re-experienced the memory of her friend's death, I wonder... </br></br></br>  Why wasn't Dracula the main villain?  <br>"I want to fuck mommies brains out!"<br>"Momma must stay pure so I'll make everyone else black!"<br>"I love my mommy!"</br></br></br>  <br>Vampires aren't fun anymore.</br>  does anyone have a gif/webm of that merc catching his beer?  Holy shit, could this movie being any more boring?  <br><br>He observed her for a long time and saw no change whatsoever in her psycho pass, no matter what kind of awful shit happened. And then he seriously expected that after the small townful of people that were brutally murdered over the course of the second season, killing her granny would somehow make her lose her shit for good.<br><br>What did he do to all those other inspectors?<br>Show them his crayon set?<br> God, all the other pens but the black are unused!? You sick fucker! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone know where to find the OST for the movie?  <br>And it still nearly worked.</br>  <br><br>No it didn't. There's no indication that her hue was clouded even for a moment. Akane can process her grief better than the masses depending on the system.</br></br>  <br>  <br>0/10</br></br>  Does this take place before or after season 2?  So i guess doujishi is fucked, thanks TPP<br>http://mainichi.jp/select/news/2015<wbr>0728k0000m020060000c.html</wbr></br>  Can't read nip m8 <br><br>What is this about?</br></br>  I can't read nip. Did some cocksucking, out of touch baby boomer fuck it up for everyone AGAIN?  <br> all these moonrunes <br>can't do it /a/non</br></br>  <br>Were you honestly expecting this thread to go anywhere with moonrunes in OP?</br>  <br>You can always expect murricans to fuck everything up for everybody else.</br>  <br> The Counsel for Negotiations is supposed to "negotiate". Anyone can blindly swallow demands, even a kid. I predict that they'll add "some degree of elasticity" to the treaty's text. If they can't even do that, Japan may as well be America's dog. <br>That's the basic gist.</br></br>  Fucking Kojima.  This doesn't sound good. What exactly is happening?  What has happened, OP?  How many more days do we have before TPP is in action?  <br><br>It's over. It means no more sadpanda or anime for you.</br></br>  From what I understand, this is in response to the TPP finalizing the copyright protection period as "70 years after the author's death", and non-Antragsdelikt. The latter means that anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. I think. Policy terms aren't my forte.  Is this yet another situation where we all freak out and act like it's the end of the world when nothing is going to change?  <br>If TPP passes the state anime industry will be the least of our concerns</br>  <br>Yup. Any shithead can shut down doujinshi makers, torrent, scanlator etc sites. All it takes is one asshole in any of the signatory states.</br>  HOARD EVERYTHING YOU CAN QUICK  <br>This one is a lot, lot more scary than any of the last ones. You should prepare for the worst.<br><br><br> anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author <br>Yes, that's the scariest part of the TPP.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> may as well <br>I've got some bad news for Japan.</br></br>  I can't wait for WWIII to free us from all these stupid laws that keep getting passed.  <br>Up till now, Japan's copyright policies were "50 years after the author's death" and formal complaints filed by the author. We'll just have to hope Japan doesn't have many goody two-shoes.</br>  <br> Yes, that's the scariest part of the TPP. <br>In my opinion the scariest part is the bit where they discard democracy and hand over all power to the economy, but oh well. Maybe I'm insane.</br></br>  <br> Doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author. <br>That's stupid. Literally any person to agree to this is stupid.</br></br>  Without hentai we'll have to fuck eachother while wearing cute girly clothes.  Is there any way I can go kick the prime minister in his taint or something to get my country to not sign TPP?  Anon, you think you can just waltz in here and drop moon in our lap after being told we can't learn nip for years?  Thats fine. More reason for me to book a flight to Gensokyo.  Feels good to be in anti-american country.  This is what happens when you let companies run governments.  <br>There wont be any good guys in WW3, anon.</br>  <br>Be sure to take as many people with you as you can.</br>  <br>The scariest part for me, NZer, is that we are trading away our amazing health care (guaranteed to lose) for a chance at maybe increase some of our agricultural exports. <br>Because our fucken milk prices are stupid enough. We are already paying more than you faggots overseas are paying for our milk. Why the fuck do you want it cheaper. what homos</br></br>  <br><br> There won't be a third world war <br>ftfy</br></br></br>  <br>So?<br>That's not the point.<br>A world war will break the economy and therefore shake up the world order and allow us to create something new.<br>Looking for good guys in a war is just asking to be lied to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have done that a long time ago since it's been around forever and things kept getting leaked. We've known it was going to be bad for a while now.</br>  <br> implying the companies wouldn't be the ones controlling everything during WWIII </br>  <br> overpopulating Gensokyo <br>That really doesn't sound like a good idea.</br></br>  <br>Your health care is not all you are going to lose when you allow companies dictate laws.</br>   yfw nips start emigrating just so they can draw/own porn of their waifus <br><br>Not even sure how to feel about this. Do they even remember what the pink looks like?</br></br>  <br>To where, this shit covers the majority of the world.</br>  <br>Well I only heard kinda recently because I don't really pay attention to the world beyond my immediacy. Is there anything I can do in this late hour?</br>  <br>America will make sure that the rest joins the deal too.</br>  <br>Don't the authors or copyright holders just have to come out to say they don't give a shit about doujins to prevent them from being shut down?</br>   政府はクールジャパン戦略で、アニメやキャラクターなどの著作権ビジネス<wbr>の海外展開強化を打ち出しており、著作権保護で後押しする形だ</wbr> <br> As part of their "Cool Japan" strategy, the government wants to spread anime overseas and back them up with copyright protection <br> Cool Japan </br></br>  <br>No. They don't get asked.</br>  <br>Buy emergency rations.<br>Lots of porn, food and heavy weaponry.<br><br><br>That doesn't matter at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Getting uncensored Japanese porn, or Western stuff is pretty damn easy for them.</br>  <br>TPP doesn't allow them to do that, in fact it forces them to shut you down whether they want to or not.</br>  <br>But Japan isn't our dog<br>She's our waifu who started out as an extreme tsundere then we found out everyone around her hated her so we hooked up with her while pissing everyone else off at asian high school but we didn't care because she was and still is waifu<br>but then south korea was being bullied and needed help<br>kind of fucked up when helping viet-chan</br></br></br></br>  <br>First thing that happens in a hypothetical world war is the economy goes down in shambles because international trade is dead.<br>The only kind of world war that the companies would like is rich vs poor, and that war has already started.</br></br>  <br> government is bombarded by angry letters from mangaka and anime studios who are mad they lost the free advertisement </br>  <br>Stop making America into a generic harem MC,  lest America-kun gets copyrighted as well </br>  <br>This whole thing, TPP and all of its predecessors, have always been about companies trying to squeeze as much profit from anyone as they can.</br>  <br>Doesn't TPP abolish the japanese porn censorship? It's against free trade, uncensored porn is freely available elsewhere and thus japs can't prohibit it from being distributed in Japan.</br>  What happened to the good old days when if a company starts doing what we didn't like we could just boycott them?  <br><br>So only Putin-chan can save us now?</br></br>  is there a reason why they do the whole anyone can bitch about copy-right even if the author doesnt give 2 shits about  <br>Well as America can be pretty stupid, we should do what stupid harem protags do and go with their gut instinct<br>Having a lot of guns solved a lot of our problems in the past, so maybe if we give nippon guns we can still get the chinese cartoons</br></br>  <br>I live in Aus, so I can do at least one of those things and not be disappointed/arrested.</br>  <br>Either him or that faggot China.</br>  <br> anyone can report a copyright violation, it doesn't have to be a formal complaint by the author <br>I'm going to abuse this shit at every opportunity. Ohhhh man.</br></br>  <br>The TPP is going to fuck China.<br><br>Anyone who does not support it wants Chinese dick.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't a company, it's the entire first world.</br>  <br>USA is the mastermind of this shit and it's against the law in USA to boycott Israeli products. Boycotts are against free market goy.</br>  <br>Putin will never make anime real<br>He banned dank memes, loli putin will be kill</br></br>  <br>Putin can't even pay his military. The only thing that Putin is going to be doing is, watch China take away the majority of Russian land</br>  <br>Yeah sure, I'm okay with fucking chinks if it means I don't have a bumbling retard in charge of an Orwellian regime in my country. Plus I like chinese food.</br>  <br>No it's a group of companies who got together with more companies who then decided that they would make more money this way.</br>  <br>Introduce a police-state-like environment where by keeping everyone in fear of each other you are able to freely control their will.<br>I'm reminded of the Contraband round of Liar Game for some reason.</br></br>  <br> we found out everyone around her hated her <br>Everyone likes her now except China and Korea, though.<br><br><br> implying Natalia won't convince him otherwise </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Download the stuff you enjoy. And hey, look at it this way, at least now your backlog is your very large collection of emergency rations. Just make sure to download it.</br>  <br>Bring it on, we'll just go back to xdcc.</br>  <br>On it. This is not going to fun when I run out.</br>  <br><br>Try boycotting the companies that are behind 99% of the items in the store.<br>The most realistic way to achieve that would be to become a farmer and eat your own produce, make clothes from your own produce, and never use the internet again.</br></br></br>  <br>It's going to fuck everyone. That's like saying a giant meteor headed towards Earth is going to fuck China and we should support it.</br>  <br>Under Chinks and co you will live in an Orwellian regime.<br><br>We need the TPP to divert the world economy away from China, isolate them and watch them crash and burn just like the Soviet Union.</br></br></br>  There are a lot of original doujinshi that get made, you know. All this will do is bring comiket to its knees because most people relied on fanworks. The people that made originals will survive..  <br>That's because of the sexual healing though<br>America gave Japan the reconstruction D and cured her shitty tsundere personality<br>But then Israel-chan with her shitty futa loli with balls started fucking America in the ass with her giant cock and corrupted America, now Japan needs to save America</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, Obongo.</br>  <br>I wish. Natalia-chan banzai!</br>  <br> We need the TPP </br>  <br> So i guess doujishi is fucked <br><br>Not really, the fun of this ecosystem is that you can't mess with it without fucking it for good.<br><br>So yeah, it's approved but no one will do shit because if they do they'll lose huge profits.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why does everything have to go to shit during my generation, couldn't those faggots wait till I was dead to do this shit.  <br> Aunt Jemima is behind the me-unable-to-fap-to-Chinese-porn plot <br>I KNEW THAT BITCH WAS UP TO NO GOOD</br></br>  <br>Baby Boomers are gonna give one last good wrinkly fuck before retirement</br>  Fucking hell.

Beginning in 2008, additional countries joined for a broader agreement: Australia, Canada, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, the United States, and Vietnam, bringing the total number of participating countries to twelve. <br> Other countries and regions interested in TPP membership include Taiwan,[21] the Philippines,[22] Laos,[23] Colombia,[24] Thailand,[25] and Indonesia.[26] According to law professor Edmund Sim, many of these potential countries would have to change their protectionist trade policies in order to join the TPP.[27] Other potential future members include Cambodia,[28] Bangladesh[29] and India.[30] <br><br>So I'm assuming that in order for people to do the whole "hey, I'm gonna snitch on all your shit even if you don't care" deal, they'll have to be under the TPP's jurisdiction to do so. That seems to be one light of hope.

I'll be here fapping to incest doujins in 2020 or whatever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But by threatening people they wont make any meaningful amount of money.</br>  <br>Didn't he kill himself?</br>  <br>Bamp</br>  <br><br> What I'm saying is that that's not going to happen, you idiots. There's no money for massive law firms in suing barely-profitable doujinshi circles. It's an utter quagmire of countless individual artists. <br><br>God you are an INCREDIBLE tool if you don't understand what's happening here.<br><br>This is the feeding ground that those fucking parasites love. You seriously thing nobody will touch this 'quagmire' if there's money to be made?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all of Japan <br>Just the part that matters, anon.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>About 300$ per letter.<br>It's not much, but the letter is completely automatized. It's not too much effort after you've done the first one.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should look at Germany and tell me this shit again.</br>  <br> a handful of aging and corrupt politicians in the government <br>So the only people who have the power to make decisions.</br></br>  <br>Nah, he just fled to the Whitest country on Earth and laughed at people in his retirement.</br>  <br>Does this even work under japanese law?</br>  There was a guy uploading stuff on /a/, but then he got a DMCA notice from 4chan itself. I guess they made a new DMCA screen already.  <br>It works under TPP.</br>  <br>But Hitler like japanese.</br>  <br>What does tpp means?</br>  <br>Read the fucking thread, especially the first few tripfag posts.<br><br><br> the part that matters <br> not the people making these things <br><br>They're burning their own hand here and too dumb to know it. It'll take them several years to realize they fucked up big time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you perhaps miss the point where TPP essentially changes Japanese copyright law? Fuck me, start reading the thread.</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br><br>Uploading what?</br></br>  <br>Changes to what? Only that he can sue the artist but the rest is not changed. Like the amount of money he can demand.</br>  <br><br>It was in the sadpanda thread.<br>He was uploading Fakku's licensed works.</br></br></br>  <br>My country's leader was friends with Hitler, though.</br>  <br><br>Ah.</br></br>   128703421 <br>That was to do with Fakku's shit, right? D-dog or one of Judencob's other dickriders just reported it and 4chan was required under existing law to remove it. That's nothing new <a href="http://www.4chan.org/legal" target="_blank">http://www.4chan.org/legal</a><br><br>It sucks, but it's nothing new.</br></br></br>  <br>There's always a chance he's one of them shills.</br>  <br>The way to fight this shit is the same as always, spread the most info you can, for the biggest amount of people you can, other than that it's pray that are still old man that don't bend over for corporations.</br>  <br><br>They'll make money the same way they make money by suing individuals for torrenting music in the US, which they've done plenty of times. People have been hit with big fines. Unlike music downloaders, doujinshi authors are making a big investment and exposing themselves, so not many will take risks.</br></br>  <br>4chan has had a DMCA policy ever since the fappening. Fakku does own that content, so they have the right to send DMCAs for it.</br>  <br><br>He didn't even know how TPP worked until a post ago, so he's more likely a huge retard.</br></br>  <br>The demand for money is not legally binding. It's just semi-legal blackmail.<br>If it goes to court the lawyer will eventually get the invested money back but it doesn't actually pay for him.<br>This works because people get scared.</br></br></br>  <br>And? You realize that lawyers send billions of letters to anyone that they can potentially catch?<br>I got one once and they told me, I have to pay 3k bucks for something that I didn't do. You either go to another lawyer and pay them to deal with it, or you pay them 3000 bucks. Guess what the average person is going to do.</br></br>  <br> they make money by suing individuals for torrenting music in the US, <br><br>I am pretty sure US law does not apply in Japan. How much money can you demand in Japan for that?</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't say they didn't.<br>Just that they it happened.<br>I'm hoping it'll lead to posters thinking that everyone can report stuff and weaponize DMCA warnings/ban against other users.</br></br></br>  <br>Fakku shouldn't have the right to do anything but die</br>  The threat alone is enough to make the doujin author to quite you dumbass.<br><br>Japs are spineless race.</br></br>  <br>In Germany you don't have to pay that shit, just say you wont do any copyright infringement anymore. If it works the same in Japan the lawyers wont see a cent.</br>  <br> spread the most info you can, for the biggest amount of people you can <br> the biggest amount of people you can <br>Like who? People don't like to read the fine print. And 4chan isn't very good at disseminating info because of its isolationist policy. As much as I hate to say it, Reddit is probably the best place to take this.</br></br></br>  <br> Guess what the average person is going to do. <br>go to another lawyer and pay them to deal with it</br></br>  <br> Thinking there isn't anywhere in the world where US law can't be enforced by force <br>kek</br></br>  <br>READ THE FUCKING THREAD. TPP is INTERNATIONAL LAW.</br>  <br>That's what I just said.</br>  <br> Guess what the average person is going to do. <br><br>Nothing since the number of artists is pretty low. It is not like they can send a few million letters, only a few hundred. </br></br></br>  <br>It's an internation TRADE AGREEMENT. They're different. it's still really bad though.</br>  <br><br>Fakku is the beginning of the end. When they first came around they were alright, used to jerk it to doujins on there with my shitty NetZero connection and fuck around on the forums.<br><br>Now the main guy has sold out and thinks he can make a fucking Netflix for weeaboo hentai.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So, how does TTP change the copyright law in Japan besides that everybody can sue? Making US law suddenly apply to it too?</br>  <br><br><br><br>There's no reason to look for anything about it though. The posts have been removed from archive.moe as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I am pretty sure US law does not apply in Japan. <br>What if they sign a secret trade deal that sets terms for Japan and lets them sue Japan for having lax laws? They could call that the TPP and pass it without making the entire text public, and then wikileaks could leak some parts and you could ignore it.</br></br>  <br>In Germany a lot of lawyers got very rich very fast until the people understood that the blackmail is just that, blackmail. It took them 5 years or so, I believe.<br><br>You can destroy the doujinshi scene within 5 years.</br></br></br>  <br>That's unfortunately wrong since it's coming from another lawyer. You seem to be unaware of the fear that a lawyer can spread.</br>  <br>True, but you never know. He could just be merely pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>I don't even know why would anyone pay Fakku to masturbate to japanese drawings.</br>  <br>So spread through there, tell that to famous youtube retards, Internet celebrities, just spread, SOPA was the same way, the more people kind of know, the less they can hide their scummery.</br>  <br>There are only a very small number of doujin artists. A lawyer could send some letters once, get a few thousand dollars if he is lucky and then thats it.</br>  <br>I give it two comiket. <br><br>Can't wait to see when every japs otaku get hostile to every westerner they see in Japan.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, within a week of the necessary legislation becoming law. Send out a few SOPA takedown notices and everybody else will be scared to even try.<br><br> GRAB EVERYTHING YOU CAN NOW. </br></br></br>  <br>There's a few more than you think. And not every doujinshi goes through comiket.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>It's already passed you fucking idiot<br><br>Read the thread.</br></br></br>  <br>So just these two changes. Means US law firms still have to sue under Japanese law.</br>  <br>Can you prove that Japanese law doesn't impose fines or the cost of lawyer fees for this? Why wouldn't it have fines already? Your claim seems unlikely.</br>  <br>It didn't pass in Japan yet.</br>  <br>How is it not international law if it changes existing laws, from each country to something that is being used by all of the countrys. I guess you could call it TPP law but that would still be international law.</br>  Can't Japan just say "fuck you dude" to USA and start world war 3 over doujinshi?  <br>No because Japan leaders are old corporate slaves.</br>  <br>Japan doesn't care about the doujinshi.<br>The main problem for them is the agriculture.</br></br>  <br> implying Japan can stand even a day against USA. </br>  <br> vassal state saying no </br>  <br>They only passed the TPA so far.</br>  <br><br>If GATE is to be believed their military is filled with otaku. Revoke their doujins and they may very well go Nanking all over this bitch.</br></br>  <br>This guy is right.<br><br>Just hope that some old farmer oji-san will shank abe soon.</br></br></br>  <br><br> can a country with no military say no to the most powerful military while they have 250% debt of their GDP <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br> Americans <br> large fat men who can barely move, being huge targets <br><br> Japanese <br> small nimble fighters, who can dodge bullets with Yamato Damashii <br><br> American planes <br>Can't even fly.<br><br> Japanese planes <br>Transformers piloted by idols using the power of music to bring about peace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/pol/ pls</br>  <br> implying their history textbooks have anything about Nanking in them <br> implying the average Japanese thinks they did anything wrong in WW2 </br></br>   my home country is trying to kill everything I know and alive <br> AGAIN <br>FUCKING STOP ALREADY</br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with /pol/?</br>  <br>Go on m8, shoot some politician during the next convention.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>-Pacific_Partnership#Intellectual_p<wbr>roperty<br><br> Standardization of copyright provisions by other signatories would also require significant changes to other countries’ copyright laws </br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_countries_by_public_debt</wbr></br>  <br><br>I did not imply any of that. I am saying if they revoke their doujins and they may go rape crazy as it is the Japanese natural state that is being sated by doujins. Kinda like how the English natural state is to enslave the Irish.</br></br>  Someone needs to nuke Japan again, to tell them not to bend over to America  <br>He was implying the US might invade Japan if they say no.</br>  <br><br>People with loads of dosh and lawyers.</br></br>  <br>Differently from the USA, pretty much all the Japanese debt is in Japanese hands.<br>Japan holds more US debt than the US will ever hold Japanese debt. In fact, I think the Japanese are currently number 1 holders of American debt.</br></br>  <br>No he didn't imply that at all.</br>  <br>Why not just nuke America then?</br>  <br>The US might fight back.</br>  <br>Japan owns more US debt than any other country. All they have to do is sell their US debt and it would utterly, completely, and entirely destroy the US economy (and the global economy for that matter). Japan has always been fond of suicide though.</br>  Isnt there a law in the US that a corporation can be treated as a individual?  <br> Japan <br> no military <br>http://www.globalfirepower.com/coun<wbr>try-military-strength-detail.asp?co<wbr>untry_id=Japan</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Why not make America nuke itself?</br>  <br>Aren't they already doing that?<br>Isn't that what this thread is about?</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure shutterstock is public domain</br>  <br>They are. Or at least, they've shot themselves in the foot. The nuke comes later.</br>  <br>Yes and no.<br>There is a law that people say, "THIS CLEARLY SAYS THEY ARE" and is treated as such, but actually doesn't. And it's not as an individual, it's personhood.</br></br>  <br>Who will do that?</br>  <br>No, he was replying to someone else who implied that.</br>  <br>It was a supreme court ruling that money is speech and that since corporations have money it's protected speech. The implications being there is no limit to free speech - that is, the amount of money you can spend to buy your very own politician.</br>  <br>Guess I'm moving to Indonesia or Taiwan next since Japan is rapidly turning to shit</br>  <br>JDF isn't military.</br>  <br> This one is a lot, lot more scary than any of the last ones. You should prepare for the worst. <br>This is said every time, and it is also true every time.</br></br>  <br> public domain <br>How long until US government passes a law that states 'Public Domain' is now a property of the US?</br></br>  <br>It is now that they have changed the constitution to allow them fighting outside of their country.</br>  <br>I already have backup thirdworld shitholes in the form of Philippines or Indonesia.</br>  <br> money is speech  <br>I hate this world, i want fascism back, fuck, anything but this corporate greed.</br></br>  <br>Clapistan hasn't been free since like the 40s, anon.</br>  <br><br>Fuck, there could have been a loophole where you could buy and share manga/anime/whatever with people who are part of your own buisness/corporation.</br></br>  <br>Private Domain is public of US as well. kek.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emine<wbr>nt_domain</wbr></br></br>  <br>Do you even know how many countries have been forced to fuck themselves over just so the USA allows them to do a little international trade?</br>  <br>But they are also parts of TPP.</br>  <br>They didn't, it passed the lower house. Japan's society is pacifist and has always been pacifist. In fact, they signed some sort of agreement well before the second world war.</br>  <br>https://ustr.gov/tpp/overview-of-th<wbr>e-TPP<br><br> The United States is negotiating the TPP with 11 other like-minded countries (Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam) that share a commitment to concluding a high-standard, ambitious agreement and to expanding the initial group to include additional countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region. <br><br> expanding the initial group to include additional countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region <br><br>Have fun with that, faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Not a problem, at least for me.<br>Most of my favourite doujins are original from its author, anyway.</br></br>  <br>Taiwan is pretty cool from my understanding.

We're just on /a/, so that's what we care about.</br></br>  <br>The goal here has nothing to do with doujinshi and manga and has everything to do with american companies.<br>Japanese media will just be caught in the crossfire and hit hard because a lot of it is built on copyright infringement. Even though historically, copyright infringement has done nothing but help the industry.</br></br>  <br>Of course it will. If you're an American media company, like the kinds paying the RIAA and MPAA to sue everyone, you want to fuck over the anime industry because they're competitors.</br>  <br>Well, i'm doomed then. Even i brought it legally, i can't even read it, because i can't read moon language.</br>  <br>Not yet, that is the not so far future.</br>  <br>Yeah, doujinshi will be the least of your concerns. Still, everything else would be off-topic for /a/.</br>  You retards are finally paying attention.

I gotta watch this show then.</br>  I noticed that the new idolm@ster promo art has a lot feet, does the anime too?  6/10  <br>No. Now fuck off, we don't need you to ruin im@s threads any further than they already are.</br>  <br><br>I don't find them insufferable, just strange.<br>LIke, why not appreciate the whole body?

I just don't understand.</br></br></br>  <br>How can you not find people spamming their entry-level fetish on every board and trying to force it as normal insufferable?</br>  <br><br>Those threads are awful too to be honest. <br>If it were up to me they all would be purged from /a/. Only anime and manga discussion would be allowed.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't even go to im@s threads, I just like feet.</br>  <br>Fuck off of /a/ regardless.

So you're telling me...you wouldn't admire this girls feet while they're resting on your shoulders, as you fuck her? I feel sorry for you, you must be so boring in the bedroom (that is if you've ever even been laid).  <br>Needs more webms.</br>  <br> lol... <br><br> you must be so boring in the bedroom (that is if you've ever even been laid). <br>When will summer leave, and can they take the footfags with them?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes because we have lives, we move forward while you continue your meaningless existence on 4chan posting edgy stuff.</br></br>  <br> tumblr </br>  <br>They're concealed most of the time, so they have a weird appeal to them when you're able to see their shape. They're soft, cute and sensitive. Bare feet on a girl gives off a certain aura of comfort and relaxation. <br>Of course you're not appreciating the feet by themselves, just giving them a little more focus than usual when looking at the whole girl.<br><br>And this part is really important: Like everything else, 2D feet are in an entirely different dimension than 3D. I would think that goes without saying but the fascinations seems to get mixed up a lot. Anime girl feet are soft delicate flowers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Problem is there's not many anime focused on this subject, i suggest sticking to the few mentioned on the thread<br><br><br>When you're old enough to browse</br></br></br></br>  <br>But 4chan's traffic doesn't even increase that much in summer. It barely increases at all.<br><br>You fucking doughnut</br></br></br>  <br> believing Moot's lies </br>  <br>Misusing greentext, and samefag shitposting is forbidden</br>    <br><br>The only anime I know of that has detailed feet scenes is the monogatari series and it does hint of the fetish but that's it really.<br><br><br><br>I don't actually browse tumblr I saved this pic from google. But like I said, keep your 4chan 'edge' because you have nothing else.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats completely unrelated to the topic though. As long as theres a good feet shot in an anime you're watching then its all good.</br>  <br>Making threads that belong on other boards is forbidden, as well. But don't worry, it's okay when footfags do it.</br>  <br>see<br> &gt;Recent ANIME you watched with nice feet service</br></br>  <br> thinking that justifies your imagedump <br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Would actually be more /e/ than /h/. So why the crusade against feet? You were bothered enough to bitch in the archives, and I figured I'd find you here.</br>  <br>Cause i am a huge faggot that enjoys gobbling on cocks please feed me cocks i just can't stop being a huge faggot</br>  <br>Why would this belong in /h/? and I don't get why it would be in /c/ either lmao. They're actual screen caps from anime here. Just how there are smug face threads and ass sniffing threads.</br>  <br> why the crusade against feet? <br>They get more than enough service shots handed to them on a silver platter and still whine when you don't give them seconds. They're greedy and need to be taught that no one cares.<br><br>Nice timestamps.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not buying it.

I have a webm one but the size is too big to upload.</br>  Not sure why this specific scene turned me on alot.    <br>Hmm... I'd say anything from Magoroku is really good stuff.</br>  <br>Because you have a mental illness, perhaps?</br>  <br>Well, I wouldn't say having a fetish would mean you have a mental illness but thanks anyways.</br>  <br>How much feet shots do you think Nourin has? Are there alot of moments with the mc showing that he has a foot fetish?</br>  <br>He's tricking you, that's the only shot. It's not even that long.</br>  <br>It also had this scene.<br>But yeah aside from this and that image there isn't much more.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Gzz<wbr>nDtHYXco</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Well, at least theres this guy which has a long scene.</br>  <br>Doesn't seem like hes enjoying it though lol.</br>  <br>God damn, what a lucky bastard.</br>  I came across this scene from Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight!        <br>He wanted the girl to be the beautiful, famous Idol he's been lusting after forever who transferred to his school and instead he got a fat fucking cow. So yeah, he wasn't very happy.</br>  <br>Shes still hot though.</br>  Saten feet.  <br> fat <br> hot </br></br>        <br> toes gripping that stand <br><br>This conjures up so many lewd images.</br></br></br>  <br> using sandals outdoors <br>I guess /a/ was right by calling her a slut</br></br>  I was surprised nnb had a nice scene last week. Delicious nee-san feet.  I'm curious but does anyone want an anime screen cap collection which has 2000 pics?  <br>shes the ultimate footslut</br>  <br>I'd be into this. Do you have one lying around?</br>    <br>I'm going to agree with <br>She has slutty feet.</br></br>  <br>I didn't like the blobby shape of the foot here, but the way they drew the toenails there was unique and aesthetically pleasing.</br>  <br>yes, here it is. Its not really my collection so, thank the person who downloaded it all. Its on exhentai I think. Heres the download link for 2000 feet screenshots from anime.<br><br>https://mega.co.nz/#!r00DGCSa!xyY82<wbr>-otHHqLK5QQaWy7NMQmScwteUhGGN80qJ5I<wbr>kh8</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>For me its the opposite. The toenail doesn't really look very nice for me. It looks a bit like a guy's feet.</br>    <br>Thanks anon.</br>      Shaft draws some really nice feet.  <br>That's not how ankles work. Is he licking a dead body?</br>  <br>Those are legit monkey toes.</br>  <br>So cute</br>  <br>feetfags are cancer</br>  <br> those toes <br><br>They fucking knew what that would do to footfags. They fucking knew.</br></br></br>  <br>What's the problem with using sandals outdoors?</br>  <br>Uppotes are lewd</br>  <br>Now that you pointed it out lol... yeah it does look weird.</br>  <br> putting on a foot clinic for footfags all around the world <br> not slutty </br></br>  Anyone got the gif or webm for this?    <br><br>Trapfags are 10x worse honestly.</br></br>        <br>The japanese are damn smart, teaching girls to sit like that since forever. It's literaly the best position to showcase the feet. Shame no western can hold that position at all. Shit must be practiced.</br>  <br>literally perfect.</br>      <br>Yeah, I love that position too. I'll try to find more pics of it.</br>      <br><br>MORE</br></br>              <br>Fetishes don't need an explanation, but if I had to give one, It would be the same as <br><br>That said, it's not like we like ALL types of feet. I mean, who could like feet that have some disease?.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Have some more saten's feet.</br></br></br>  <br> Drawing Greek feet <br>Why is this allowed?<br>I know that it's accurate but they should always draw Egyptian feet.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ those are horrifying.</br>  <br>Just how most guys are born to like tits and ass. I am born to like feet. I have no idea why I like them. I just find them sexually appealing. I mean, there are people who like small breasts and others who like big ones. Why is that?</br>  <br>Lmao, yeah. That feet's toenail looks horrifying.</br>  <br> feet <br>disgusting-distasteful, dirty and not in the good way</br></br>  <br>k, thanks for leaving your opinion :) I really care about people's opinion.</br>  <br>Thanks!. Be sure to try harder next time :)</br>    <br>I'm not a foot fetishist, but I would really like to massage a woman's delicate feet like this</br>  <br><br>Obligatory copypasta response:<br><br>- Men are evolutionarily wired to seek mates with small feet as it's a sign of high estrogen production and therefore fertility. We're hard-wired to look at, notice and appreciate cute little girlfeets.<br>- Many scientists think sexual orientations and fetishes can form when the "cabling" of the brain fucks up and accidentally "wires" sex to something it shouldn't be "wired" to. The parts of the brain responsible for feet and sex are right next to each other so this could possibly make this "miscabling" easy.<br>- Feet are very curvy, complex body parts. Curves are generally aesthetically pleasing.<br>- The cute, dainty, tiny, hairless female foot is a sexy feminine contrast to the big-ass hairy manfoot.<br>- The feet and the armpits are the two body parts which secrete the most pheremones. There's something sexy about inhaling the essence of a woman, so the smell can be sexy even if it's "bad."<br>- The feet are very sensitive and a woman's reactions to having them touched can be exquisite.<br>- The appeal to the masochist/submissive of "worshiping" feet, the lowest part of the body, a body part which is often dirty and/or smelly, should be obvious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br><br>go kill yourself memelord</br></br>  <br> memelord <br><br>Careful there.

There is anyone who wouldn't choose left?  Best girl.  <br>I see FAs on /a/ all the time.</br>  <br>Right.<br><br>Orange a shit. A SHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>Left.</br>  Pink  <br><br> orangefags </br></br>  <br>Orange. Silver a shit.</br>  <br>Silver a best.</br>  <br>Right, of course.</br>  <br>Left because I'm not into bitches and whores.</br>  <br>Orange &gt; Pink &gt; Black &gt; Poop &gt; Silver</br>  <br><br>You just posted one.</br></br>  <br>Now let's be fair –Orange isn't a whore. Silver is closer to a being a whore, but she is also best girl.</br>  <br>Shitwa is a literal bitch.</br>  <br>Neither, direct me to where Pink is.</br>  Pink = Silver &gt; Black &gt; * &gt; Orange  <br>I have to wonder if Silverfags are all masochists or betafags.</br>  Pink &gt; Silver &gt; Yellow &gt; Black &gt; Orange  <br> Cute, adorable, chill and cool childhood friend loli <br> Or a blackmailing and pretentious 3DPD-like cunt with family issues <br>Gee, OP. You sure make this hard.</br></br></br>  <br>Quite the opposite, triumphing over a bitch takes an alpha male. It's like breaking in a wild stallion or wrestling a crocodile.<br><br><br> Orange <br> chill and cool <br>You serious? She's a spaz. Black is probably the chillest.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like you.</br>  <br>Once again, FLAT is justice.</br>  <br><br> liking joke characters </br></br>  <br> loli <br>Anta full baka.</br></br>  <br>Please, she'd break you before can break her.</br>  <br> joke <br>Pink was no joke man, she was very cute and probably the second best girl for MC if it weren't for Masuzu.<br><br><br>Speak for yourself, I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Joke characters tend to be better than serious ones in shows like this.</br>  <br>Orange</br>  <br> liking retards </br>  <br>How does it feel knowing that Hollanda will never win a World Cup?</br>  <br>Best girl never wins.</br>  <br> neverlands <br> orangefag <br><br>How fitting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The proper term is comic relief character. Those types are usually fun and Pink being second best to Orange can be said to be a testament to that. Pink even supports Orange, so you which team is the team to side with.</br>  <br> Netherlands <br> best girl <br>Bullshit. They start off well and fall apart after a few screw ups, even degenerating into infighting. They're a good team no doubt but far from the true best,  Germany .</br></br></br>  <br> Enemy of my enemy is my friend. <br>But then again i don't like white either, fuck that bitch. I heard pink got better in last volume and try to find a way to stop MC's anti-love thing.</br></br>  <br> white </br>  <br><br>Oh fuck i mean silver.</br></br>  <br>you know*<br><br><br>More Silver than White.<br><br>Thing is though, Pink and Orange gets along well so they are not enemies.<br><br>Last volume that had spoilers I remember reading was volume 8. That was Pink's volume and in that was her first time being a serious heroine. She realized her position and in the end went to support Orange to be together with the MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If team Orange doesn't win, I'll riot.</br>  <br>Here, have a Molotov cocktail and some bike chains. It's going to be a harem end because Eita is JUST that chuuni. /a/ is going to shrug and say "it was always shit" but everyone will be smoldering inside.</br>  <br>Those with good taste.</br>  <br><br>Left, right is okay too though, I like silver hair.</br></br>  I want to cum all over Masuzu's delicious tummy.  <br>Was it ever satisfactorily explained in canon why she doesn't wear pantsu? It's been so long I forget.<br><br> inb4 she's a slut, whore, etc </br></br></br>  <br>She just likes FREEDOM.</br>  <br> going commando <br>I get it.</br></br>  <br><br>these<br><br>why is she so perfect</br></br></br></br>    <br>right</br>    Silver = Pink &gt; Black &gt; shit &gt; Orange  anyone who likes orange should be euthanized    <br>Orange is such a fucking shitty bitch. Worst girl.</br>  <br>This /a/non knows.</br>    That boy who has a crush on MC    Avoid the crazy.  <br>Always left.</br>    Silver is made for good hard breeding<br><br>Orange is too dainty, she'd BWEAK</br></br>  <br>Chiwa. She is one of the few childhood friends who deserves to win over the bitch heroine.</br>    <br> that fucking scene </br>  <br>I concur.</br>    <br><br>I hate to break it to you...but all dem bitches be krazy!</br></br>  <br> boy </br>      <br>Why the fuck can't we just have regular traps lusting for MC cock instead of reverse traps. Makes me sick.</br>    <br>Can you make a webm of this scene? </br>    <br>Left, because she's not a blackmailing cunt</br>  I like Silver and Orange individually. I wish only one existed and not the other. Orange deserves to have her wish fulfilled by being with her childhood love and watching Silver defrost is magical. <br><br>Fuck the author for making me choose one or the other.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't have that video in my com right now. Also it might take sometime to re-download so don't expect anything.</br></br>    <br>Ok.</br>  <br><br>Or...<br><br>Send me a download link (Preferably Mega , Mediafire) and I'll make whatever webm you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because that's gay.</br>  <br>This is what I found<br>https://mega.co.nz/#!kgdw1B7B!vR0n-<wbr>oBBV-3Q4sZqs3VxtXDGtYlhxTblZsTB_DRy<wbr>acE</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Pink, please</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon. Will see what I can do.</br></br>  I'm still baffled as to how Silver can have fans.  <br>She bullies worst girl. That's enough reason to like her.</br>  Who /bestFriend/ here?<br>Nobody?<br>eh, it's not like I'm gay, but if dating pink would make my bro happy, I'd marry pink.</br></br>    <br>I think most of her "fans" like her unironically.</br>  <br><br><br>Alright, I'm not sure if you want the whole thing or not but here you go.</br></br></br>  <br>That's perfect. Cheers.</br>  I'd take silver and orange.<br>The other two can join in.<br>I guess I'll have them all.</br></br>  Here, have the fixed version  <br>This. I think many would agree except the filthy orangefags.</br>  <br>neither, as i am not a lolicon or a masochist</br>  <br>I would rather have Pink win than Shitwa.</br>  <br>Ai-chan kawaii!</br>  <br> ever picking retardation <br>Right until the end of times.</br></br>  <br>Osananajimifags have the smallest comfort zone.</br>  <br>fool you smash both</br>        the people who would pick left are the same people who would pick Eriri<br><br>prove me wrong</br></br>   picking left ever   <br>I bet you think Hinagiku is a joke character too.<br>Look at this guy. Look at him and laugh.</br></br>  <br>Jojo is garbage.</br>  <br><br>That's true. Both Eririfags and Orangefags are a minority.</br></br>  <br> Pretentious and cancerous Jojofag <br>The worst type. It's not enough she's a huge cunt on top of that.</br></br>      <br> Nyaruko </br>  Left is literally a kid, mentally and physically  <br>PINK<br>I<br>N<br>K</br></br></br></br>  <br> This is why NTR exists </br>  <br>I haven't seen this show. I don't even know what show it is.<br><br>Right is the CLEARLY superior choice.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see the connection other than that they have twintails. Both are best girls anyways.</br>  <br> both are childhood friends <br> both are losers <br> both are worst girl </br></br></br>  <br>Left. If I had a childhood friend like Orange growing up, things would be a lot different around here.</br>  <br> Liking a cockblocker bitch <br>How can orangefags like her?</br></br>  <br>You forgot<br> Both are bitches </br></br>  <br>What a fucking bitch</br>  Pink. The Aunt's game literally proves she has 100% compatibility with the MC.  <br>Cockblocker tier:<br><br>1) Silver<br>2) Pink<br>3) Orange<br>4) Black</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> losers <br> He doesn't know that Orange is more likely to win than Silver <br>Animefag pls. Nice shit taste by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to believe.</br>  <br><br>Cool lie.</br></br>  <br>Nice delusion</br>  <br>F unny, that is one of my thoughts exactly when I wonder why Silverfags exists. Getting in Orange's way when she wasn't interested in the MC and was only using him for selfish reasons via blackmail. Silver is seriously 3DPD. At least with Orange she is mostly a kid mentally. Silver has ill-will and is vindictive when she abuses, schemes, and bullish.</br>  <br><br><br> Cockblocker tier: <br> 1) Silver <br>Even if it's a lie, she is supposed to be MC's girlfriend <br><br> He doesn't know that Orange is more likely to win than Silver <br>[citation needed]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  This show was a waste of a good OP  <br><br>Such a cute little butt.<br><br>Too bad that ram it too hard and she will be paralyzed from waist down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So? It's a fake relationship and she wasn't interested in the MC then. If she wasn't such a sadistic bitch, she should had told Orange that it was a fake relationship in the first place. But no, she enjoyed messing with Orange despite the fact she can tell that Orange likes the MC.</br>  <br>The strong always wins</br>  <br>Nice excuse that has nothing to do with the point at hand.</br>  <br>Your point? She has the right to stop the horny childhood friend who tries to seduce her boyfriend everytime because to the eyes of an outsider, they are going out.<br><br>However, orange has no right to stop the MC from flirting with anybody else and by doing so, she is just showing how hipocrite is she</br></br></br>  <br>That's why Ranka lost to Sheryl.</br>  <br> Orange is more likely to win than Silver </br>  <br>Why do you blame Silver?<br>It's MC's fault the he didn't tell the Orange his relationship was fake</br></br>  <br>Anyone playing the waiting game has no excuse.</br>  <br>They both occupy a distant third position in popularity lagging far behind the gold and silver medals.</br>  <br> Your point? <br> It's a fake relationship and she wasn't interested in the MC then. If she wasn't such a sadistic bitch, she should had told Orange that it was a fake relationship in the first place. <br>It's right there, you god damn retard. Silver is most selfish, she enjoys having it her way and causing others to suffer. It it's not even about keeping up with the bullshit relationship, but she got a kick out of fucking with Orange. <br><br>If you are going to cite rights, then by all rights Orange has the most right to be jealous and try one-up the other girls for knowing the MC the longest and for having better reasons to feel the way she feels than anyone else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ISSE NO~</br>  <br> she got a kick out of fucking with Orange <br>To be fair Orange made it REALLY easy for her. She's so gullible in the earliest episodes that it's painful to watch. You'd think she would realize that Silver is playing with her and tell her to fuck off, but no.</br></br>  <br>GAARISHU LAVA</br>  <br>Are you new to harem? Girls have their own rules and shit amongst themselves. Silver is a girl and she knows about Orange's feelings. So she is the one who purposely cockblock that hardest and most maliciously so. MC is your usual dense harem MC. He's not in the right to not tell, but the (poor) excuse for him exists in that he was getting blackmailed and stuck to go along with it for now.<br><br><br>Well, she is an innocent and naive girl. That's part of her character. But she grows a bit more later and starts to become highly competitive to the point she can have some weight in her banters against Silver.</br></br></br></br>  <br> SJW strike again </br>  <br> But she grows a bit more later  <br>And that's all thanks to Silver, if it wasn't for her Orange would continue to be dumb and naive kid</br></br>  <br> taking haremshit seriously in the first place <br>Your sanity isn't coming back anytime soon.</br></br>  <br> an innocent and naive girl <br>There's being naive, and then there's "dumb enough to think swinging a guitar around while screeching like an ape is the first step towards becoming a proper lady". It was like a crueler Kill Me Baby, but I wasn't laughing.</br></br>  <br>This might be bullshit, but I'll believe it. I won't riot when Orange wins.</br>  <br> It was like a crueler Kill Me Baby <br>Why is Yasuna so based while Orange is so shit?</br></br>  <br> If you are going to cite rights, then by all rights Orange has the most right to be jealous and try one-up the other girls for knowing the MC the longest and for having better reasons to feel the way she feels than anyone else. <br><br> I'm his osananajimi, so you need to ask for my permission if you want to date him <br><br>No wonder there are people who like orange, they are mentally challenged like her</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Orange <br> winning <br>Just like people believing Eriri can win.</br></br></br>  <br>No relationship squabbles in KMB.</br>  <br>Hint : anyone using the word "deserve" should be completely ignored</br>  <br>Both</br>  <br> but the (poor) excuse for him exists in that he was getting blackmailed and stuck to go along with it for now <br>Silver doesn't monitor him 24/7, he could have just told Orange it's a fake relationship so she wouldn't feel depressed about it<br>There's no excuse</br></br></br>  <br> Implying I would know what the fuck that is <br><br><br>If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. She'll mature as she grow older, it's only natural. The one thing Silver did was made Orange developed into an astringent character, that's all.<br><br><br>You realize her being a baka coincides with her innocent and naive, right? She's like Aika from Shomin Sample, but a less of a baka. <br><br><br> Straw man <br> Implying it is about permission <br>You sound mentally challenged when you can't understand rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Pink because I'm not a jojofag  <br> Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. <br>And why's that?</br></br>  <br>MC's future is driven and motivated for Orange's sake. Per LN writing, you know how that will go.</br>  <br> You sound mentally challenged when you can't understand rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts. <br><br>Are you really an orangefag? Because she's the one not respecting those "rules" you just said by trying to fuck someone who has a girlfriend (and she didn't know the girlfriend is fake)<br><br>Also<br> gets called mentally challenged <br> NO, YOU  <br><br>Refrain from accessing this board if you are underaged</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rules between girls and not fucking each other over like bitches and sluts <br>You ever hear the phrase, "All's fair in love and war?" There are no rules in love. MC even tries to go for harem end, which if anything is disrespectful toward everyone.</br></br>  <br>Still haven't watched this because the color palette makes me nauseous.</br>  <br> If Silver wasn't around, Orange and the MC would end up together eventually without a much of a problem. <br> Completely forgetting that she knew the MC for years and yet the MC became a beta faggot who didn't believe in love. <br><br>It's thanks to Silver that the MC started to change</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've never seen so many white people in one place before.</br>  <br>If he let SIlver fuck around with Orange and didn't even tell her his relationship was fake, I don't think his future is that much driven and motivated for Orange's sake</br>  <br>He sees her like a little sister</br>   she's bitch because she's smarter and not naive <br>Orangefags logic</br>  he was gonna become a doctor and fix her frail vagina bones so she could marry a nice boy, while he himself becomes a misanthropic bastard like Dr. House  <br>It is though. He wants to become a doctor and stay by her side to treat her. <br><br><br>Shit happens in the future, dude. In the LN, she doesn't see her as a little sister anymore after Orange's advancements towards him. So, yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She made advancements because of sSilver. If it weren't for her, she would had mantained the status quo</br>  <br><br>Orange's faction in Japan have strong reasons behind their Orange end prediction. Unless the author does an asspul like Haganai's author, the ending should follow a general LN path so Orange end is most likely.<br><br><br><br><br><br>Anyone who has been following the story closely should be able to see it. Silver's arc isn't about needing the MC. Overcoming her family issues and deal with no-love will be the resolution for her character. By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Silver isn't a bitch because I like her <br>Silverfag in denial.</br></br>   Orangefags still post <br>EL OH EL</br>  <br>The one voiced by Yukari Tamura.</br>  <br> Any ending where my favourite girl doesn't win is an asspull </br>  <br> deal with no-love will be the resolution for her character <br> By the end, Silver will likely do what Pink: step down and give Orange a pat on the back to support Eita and Orange hooking up <br>I didn't think it was possible to be this overoptimistic.</br></br></br>  <br> Orange's faction in Japan <br>Stopped reading here</br></br>  Where can I read the LNs?
