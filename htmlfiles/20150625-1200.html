[ How many of you watch Prisma Illya with a constant boner?  Anon here.   None of the characters are very appealing.    how can you think that?   Scans out bitches  Dump images with discussion please, 1/5 of last thread is literally Irohasu~   Unless you want me dumping Yukino in the name of Spyro     I want to kill this fucking cunt.    My pessimism = gone. Thanks brothers. Weekly Iroha thread when (album-kun, please).         Yahallo!  I'd be ok with a Yukinon dump.  Good Irohasu, everyone!   This anon knows it    Irohafag cancer    How about we split the difference at a "both best girls" dump?   Iroha is my goddess  Who's winning   Now that's genuine Cap'n.    Yui    Irohasu~     pls no more Irohacucks  I don't care if Yui wins the 8 I just don't want her to be sad  and I don't like these chances     I want to see more original design Yukino.     cucks  Then stop instigating responses  Irohasu~       I'll take you up on that offer.    Irohasu~   Happy to be here captain. I was laying low for the most part, but decided to pop back up once the fun started to happen.   Feel free to, a fanart/discussion thread would be a welcome change of pace to what we usually have.           I feel as if those spoilers were true, it'd be a much bigger deal and we'd be discussing it. For the most part, what we've been talking has been mostly the 3way date between the club members   In this volume? Probably Yui. hachiman finally made the homemade cookie connection (and she was the only girl I think to give him something on Vday)  As to who's winning overall, beats me. Probably Yukino and Yui tied at this point         If she is giving him a handy then why is she using two hands?     What? But what about Iroha's spoon scene?     I can't seriously find a stronger term, so I'm going to resort to a simple one  Go fucking Irohass yourself      Irohasu~   Foursomes are pretty nice too you know      Fast. We have little time before they come. Let's discuss a few posts about the series and then we can hide. Because they are coming.    YUI WANTS IT ALL   Yui sandwich end is still best end        IROHA, captain.    Irohasu~   Avatarfag already shitting up the thread. This why the fanbase will always be considered cancer.    Service Club should be changed to The Swinger's Club.  This should legit be a LN series.       Irohasu~   It's your own bloody fault, try not making provoking shitposts like this  and maybe we won't passive aggressively spam fanart.   Try putting your hand over a fire to learn something already.          We aren't 100% sure how that scene is meant to be interpreted because of the dammed Japanese wordplay.    Taichou, I can see them coming. They are about 100 men. What are we going to do, Taichou?   It's happening isn't it?   it could still happen.   You can't stop Irohasu NTR 8man  Irohasu~~~    In case otherfags can't understand it   That's the thing, anon, we know her chances of winning are slim, but we don't give a shit, we still love our queen.  I'll put it like this   1.-She loses the 8bowl, but we don't care that much cause we saw it coming.   2.-She wins the 8bowl and you all faggots get gloriously BTFO by our queen.   We have nothing to lose and everything to win   IROHA OR DEATH   And Reminder   “Huh? W-What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, it won’t work out. There’s someone I like.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me? I’m sorry, you’re aiming too high. It’s creepy too and not possible.”   “Ha! Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, for an instant that made my heart skip a bit, but now that I think about it rationally, it really wouldn’t work out.”   “…Could it be that you were making passes at me just now, I’m sorry, I do like them older, but it really wouldn’t work out.”   “What are you doing? Are you making passes at me while I’m heartbroken? I’m sorry, it’s still not possible just yet.”   “Ha! What was that just now, were you trying to hit on me, you’re a bit shameless to think you can act like a boyfriend just because we went out to have fun for a bit, I’m sorry, please do that only after we do this a few more times.”    “In any case, today turned out to be a good learning experience. Thank you very much.”   Isshiki lightly bowed, honestly expressing her appreciation. Taken aback by her earnest and mannerly behavior, I replied back awkwardly in a fluster. Isshiki lifted her face and laughed in amusement.   “…Senpai, make sure to keep today in mind, okay?”    I was interrupted by Isshiki’s sliding movement towards my side.   “That’s why, for now…”   Isshiki stopped her words there and moved her lips to my ears as if to say something secretly with deceiving eyes at the end.   She added some spice smeared with sugar.   “You’re the only one that I’ll act this way with, senpai.”   These were flirtings.                                Iroha almost wins, but is beaten back by reinforcements coming from a wizard(Shizuka-sensei) and is ultimately defeated?    If a few pictures of an anime girl are physically stopping you from writing out your discussion on the series I don't think your mentally stable enough enough to post or formulate a post in response to an argument.    I thought it was pretty straight forward since the ellipses were at the beginning of the term in question. If it were at the end I could see how it could be interpreted in many ways, but for the most part it sound like his standard way of giving backhanded compliments.  "...But I don't hate it." is pretty easy to understand compared to "I don't hate it, but.."   Irohasu~          You could boil eggs with how hot her crotch is I bet.     It's not insignificant, but the hype that Irohafags exploded into about it was way out of proportion.    You better be off asking god, Anon-kun. I don't know what you will do, but I have family. I will run. If fighting is brave, then running is smart. They are coming Anons! Prepare yourself!   That's it faggots, you guys got on my nerves. POSTING LEWDS    Not really, the whole "but-" argument doesn't make sense because of the lack of commas, and the one about telling the words she was waiting for = lying is just bullshit    inb4 Spyro translates the whole scene as "I don't hate it, but...... it's way too sweet"        Why boil them when you can fertilize them?     A few? Are you fucking kidding?  Half the posts in this thread are Iroha shitposts.  I think I'm really going to have to straight up filter every post with Iroha's name.         I could Yukinospam the shit out of this thread, but you know, I don't want to annoy Yuifags either because we're trying to have a discussion here but you just keep shitting Irohas like your shithole was the new opening to Earth's core.   Seriously anon      Irohasu~    8man need Iroha's saliva bottle      3P works much better though. More than that and it starts getting awkward to keep everyone in play.    Yui's chances have gone up in this volume with giving Hachiman cookies on Vday, him saying to her be genuine with your feelings, and the possibility of another date between just the two of them in the future (the 3way date was supposed to be promise date but Hachiman has a code of honor)  Does Yukino get anything to boosts her chances of winning? Beats me. Hachiman tells her that ultimately she needs to solve her own problems and she is about to give Yui/Hachi a request. But she had a bunch of flags in previous volumes. And the story is mostly going to focus on her from here on out I think   Theres also the Iroha spoon scene but lets not dive into that        That's the thing, anon, we know her chances of winning are slim, but we don't give a shit, we still love our queen. I'll put it like this  1.-She loses the 8bowl, but we don't care that much cause we saw it coming. 2.-She wins the 8bowl and you all faggots get gloriously BTFO by our queen. We have nothing to lose and everything to win.  IROHA OR DEATH           So from that image, everyone is standing but Iroha is kill? What?     I actually agree with that, I think a lot of Irohafags had pent up frustrations since people kept saying Iroha was going to get BTFO in volume 11 for no reason.   At the very least it only lasted for a bout a thread or two. Much better than the Yui berserk threads after that one episode.   Iroh-asu~  Not as easy as you'd like it to be, eh fucker?           Ambush! I repeat, ambush! Some of our comrades changed sides and shot down some of our men! The enemy is increasing! Taichou we have to run!     See   Except, probably when they all end up in college, and miraculously it's the same one.      The report function exists.    posting fanart   shitpost  Irohasu?       We have nothing to lose and everything to win.   IROHA OR DEATH  So Irohafag lives are truly worthless then.      You do realize that you're implying Iroha is sleeping around on 8man, right? Learn to use NTR correctly for god's sake.    Here your "Irohafags shitposting"    <br/>        No, really. If you don't have the mental capacity to just ignore pictures of an anime girl I don't even know how you function on this board. If someone wants to discuss they'll look for your post which discusses something and respond. No one is making a conscious effort to discuss not because of pictures but because they don't want to or you know they haven't read the newnovel.      Welp, I guess for Spyro it is.   Enemy fire! I repeat! Enemy fire! We have injured comrades taichou! Where are you?    Well we can't really discuss anything until some translationfags come out. So for the most part there's nothing to discuss that hasn't been already.  At the very least fanart posting isn't doing any harm, it's a pretty tame thing to do in response to shitposts. Much better than the circlejerks that pop up whenever someone falls for the denialfag's bait.   Irohasu~ to you too         Yukino essentially told Yui she likes 8man. I don't know if that hurts or helps but it does turn this into a love triangle.    be an edgelord with a heart of gold   be moderately attractive   score two really hot chicks  Damn, 8man is a lucky man.          Yuifags spam too, nobody is innocent.      Lewis Hamilton   Less shitposting, more cute girls.   Don't forget the awesome imouto.   BFFs stand together!         Yukino essentially told Yui she likes 8man? Where?   So Yui pulls ahead? I fully support this   Once again, feel free to do so. Not much to do until we can get the moonreaders in here to explain shit for us.   I don't have as much Yukino fanart as I would like anyways.       /a/   posting pics of an anime girl = shitpost  Incredible.     Y+Y yuri 8man + Iroha   Hachiman suicide is the only solution that will give everyone an equal amount of happiness      I wouldn't say she's pulled ahead, but things between Yukino and Yui have definitely equalized at the least.      Listen good now my men. I want you to run and never look back. Promise me you won't look back. I'll stay here, and take them with me to the south, you run to the north and then take the helicopter. I know I wasn't always nice to you guys, but i remember times where we had actual discussions about this series. And I can die for these memories. Now go! Go and don't look back! Because if you do I can't hold myself back from coming with you!       k      When she told Yui she was conscious of 8man. That's basically the same as "I like him"    Ahh she did. Well at least they're being upfront about it.   I think even though its a full blown triangle now its better than the tension we had earlier in the novel. I feel when Hachiman told both girls to be genuine that it leveled the playing field        Let me dream. I dont like Yukino at all    T-TAICHOUUU! I WILL STAY WITH YOU!      I actually read moon, just don't translate them for the absence of shitposting      The anti-irohafags are ass mad right now since we Irohabros are not falling for their obvious baits to a shitpost fest   I-Irohasu~~!!       Taichou, you have family. I will stay, you go.    Yukino said she was "conscious" of 8man.  Which, unless you're a denialfag, clearly has romantic connotations.  Remember everybody, Yui is love and Yui is life.  But a Yukinon is fine too.          Why do I come to these threads anymore   Yui ship isn't as dead as we thought it was, actually seems in really good shape in fact. So congrats you guys, I always supported you despite all the jokes I made at your expense at times.  To be fair those were only in response to shitposts though.   That's understandable I suppose, you're free to do whatever the hell you want anon.   Irohasu~ my brother!            Link?    spoilers     I-I will stay too ;-;     I got you on that.   I expect an all-out Waifu War by Vol.12      Translatorfag-san onegai~     Nothing much with Vol11. I've enough Irohasu~ in chap 4. Chap7-8-9 only about club, Yui moment while touching Fish, Yui playing fair, let 8man and Yukino alone. Yukino dependency problem while she saw the fish in water tank.  Still Irohasu~         https://mega.nz/#!X5lhkRwb!mOsZVYyo<wbr>EW3XNs0NvOpeZsCjkP8PgUivYmTXL4Ar9u8<wbr></wbr></wbr>       You realize the reason for that is because she doesn't sell on her own.      https://mega.nz/#!X5lhkRwb!mOsZVYyo<wbr>EW3XNs0NvOpeZsCjkP8PgUivYmTXL4Ar9u8<wbr></wbr></wbr>   Here you go, image quality is a bit off, but it is pretty decent.   We haven't been having one since the season started? News to me.           5 months of Cold war    What? This is just a warm-up. Real shit comes after we find out what's Yukinon request    I'm sure she sells fine on her own. The problem is that she doesn't have a solid relationship with either of the other girls, so pairing her off with one of them makes much less sense than it does to put her with 8man.     1. Spoilers. 2. Occasional new artwork 3. Sometimes get comics translated 4. Read Iroha spam          Heh, bakayaroudomo. Ah-ah, what am I gonna do with you bastards? After all this, I will buy you all that ramen from Ichirou you love, so lets keep fighting!      Okay, who else say the love triangle between 8man/Yui/Yukino coming?   Welp, forgot pic    That's not exactly how marketing works anon, if that were the case she would be paired with the main heroines rather than the MC. The females have more selling power than males do.    So November if we're lucky and Watari doesn't fuck off with his deadlines and crap out 11.5 to fill the dead air.    No I mean when they were doing the key chain thing, Iroha's didn't sell that well.   8man's merch actually sells better than Yui's.       Good end never    Tobe shouldn't you be practicing with the rest of the soccer team?    Why can't they all be happy? Life isn't fair.    Sadly, 11.5 seems so real to me    Now that's alpha.    Seriously? That's weird, on average in Japan the trends are usually pretty static in favor of female merchandise. Odd.   I might have to look into that later.   Marketing major here, so this is actually really surprising for me since I've done case studies on this shit.         So they sell more when they ship Irohax8man and YxY? Nice taste nips      I saw the it coming, I am not dense.     No I mean when they were doing the key chain thing, Iroha's didn't sell that well.  [citation needed]      Delayed to December   Half the pages of a normal volume   Half of these pages are WW rants about not meeting the deadline       aren't your arms tired yet from all the reaching you did to get "8man openly flirting with Iroha" out of the spoon thing?       Well he also has to write those side stories for the blu-ray special editions too.   I think the issue is how heated it would be rather than it's existence at all. We all saw it coming, the problem is that we don't know exactly how hostile it might be.  Yui side of things is pretty easy to predict, she seems like one of those "let's fight fair and square!" type of girls.  But Yukino has shown she gets pretty jealous extremely easily. So jury's out on that one.            It was months ago, I'm not going into the archives for that. There were several pictures showing that Yukino and 8man had sold out while Iroha hasn't sold much.     Kawanantoka-san?    aren't your fingers tired from pressing against the trigger of that gun since your waifu is pretty much non-existent at this point?   Seriously you Sakifags used to be chill, where did that stick up your asses come from?        Everything that happened in Vol 10/11 was the precursor to the real romance war that will happen in 12.  Hachiman basically evened the playing field, removed most of the tension in the club, and basically gave a green light to Yui/Yukino to go all out for his affections    Is anyone actually dating anyone in Oregairu? I mean is there even one couple in the school?  I feel like I'm missing someone obvious, but nothing comes to mind.     It's a goddamned tragedy that Ponkan8 gave Yukino the Zettai Ryouiki.  Though I guess that might have been a strategic move on his part. Nobody would care about any girl but Yui if her character design was that perfect.      Shit, totally forgot about Blu-ray editions. Welp, December probably.    Tobe and Ebina have the comfortable relationship of him being her bitch while she ignores him, he deserves better.    Even so, if she sells more while being paired with 8man, that just means nips like them as a couple      I'll say it's a blessing, ZR doesn't mix well with buxom      She sells more with 8man because people want 8man.    all these tiny scraps of information all over the place   Nah, I'll wait until Spyro comes along to save the day.       Tobe x Iroha?    Not a Sakifag, she was just the first "tired of your shit" face I hit on in my Yahari folder.      Isn't he dying?    You want to base your statement on a few pictures taken on a single spot? That's not convincing.       We'll have to agree to disagree. The slight indent in the otherwise perfect curve of plump thighs covered by stockings is what keeps me going when I feel like the world is crashing down around me.     Why exactly would he be dying?   Did you see him post that he was ill or are you being a retard?               They should compete with their bodies.        Somebody with taste took my dump from last thread        all this Yukino art    Fucking hell     And then they can share the prize when they tie.   Damn right I did. Yui's my forever girl but how could I not love a girl great enough to be her BFF too?      I haven't been keeping up. Has Yumiko won the 8man yet?    I wonder if this is artsy-fartsy enough for me to get away with blowing it up to poster size and hanging it on my wall.    Want me to continue?  Don't care either way       168 / 88 / 38  This is a new low.    Definitely. I don't remember seeing some of these, so either I'm going senile or the epubs in that one mediafire folder left out some of the early volumes' illustrations.      As long as you like it, it'll do       reminder that Chapter 1 fanfiction translation is out on kyakka     At least I gave an early warning       So wait, was Yui's proposal that there would be no romance in the club, or was it her essentially declaring "war" or whatever? Because I've seen people saying both and I'm not sure if it's a dodgy translation or if I'm just getting memed by shitposters    38 unique posters :^)  Its basically a /c/ thread at this point. So lets start fighting. Because we all know Yui is going to beat Yukinon. Yukino pretty much said that Yui was reading too far into her feelings by saying "Don't decide how I feel for me."     approx. 4 posts per user. that's been the standard for ages, plus we've got at least three of us in here image dumping to various degrees.  Speaking of that though I should really go check the Yui tag on pixiv again.       cropped  I can play that game too you know.       Very well then, it's going to be the two of us then.      Yes         Yukino a shit.         A worthy foe eh?      Sounds more like it was a psy-ops move to shake up 8man and Yukino into being more genuine.      That was Yui lying so that she could spark another genuine moment from Hikki and Yukion. Hachiman shot down idea anyways  In the end from what I gathered is that next volume both girls will be going after Hachiman in earnest (after he basically gave them a green light to do so). But theres no tension in the group anymore so its more or less a fair fight and whoever wins, wins      She wanted no romance in the club, ie no HikkixYukinon because it would make her want to an hero  She does say she wants everything which can be interpreted many ways.  Hikki at the end tells her to follow her genuine feelings and it seems like she consents. He basically told her to go after her love.          k        I hope so.       Why Yahari threads have been degenerating into art dumping threads?   Quality suddenly went shit, don't know why   You may have pixiv, but I have 5 volumes in my arsenal        So, do they still casually insult each other with nicknames?   Cats are a best    I love how her personality transformed entirely after the genuine scene. She practically disappeared from the series, only to suddenly transform into a completely different character with next to no development.      We're not shitposting no?        These aren't from pixiv though      We lack fresh spoilers, so there's nothing to discuss right now  Better dumping than shitposting at least.      That happens. In any case I feel a sudden urge to write sonnets and I'm not sure why.    The Ice Queen/Demon Woman is gone.        I know, but your legion have one huge ass cult following in there     If Yukinon and/or Yui don't win we riot.   I wish we'd get coloured art more often.    Protip: The Ice Queen exterior has always been an act.     S2 Yukino doesn't even feel like the main heroine.       Sometimes I actually wonder if that's true.      Because as soon as they let their defenses down they start making spaghetti.    Poor Yui, she was just trying to get 8man some condensed milk for his coffee, and now she's covered in it!    I'm an Irohafag, but I always really liked this pic.        8man become japan's frank sinatra spin off when      Those are some next level yandere eyes. Oh god, what did she do this time?      This one is also pretty nice, wish there was a higher quality scan of it though.       Man I never noticed the bow in Yukino's hair before. Fucking adorable.          Tomorrow is it.   At last, a decent Irohafag. Never thought I would see this day.        That's a philosophical question, be more specific      Great job I did including my pic there. I feel dumber than Tobe.        Don't worry, I just did that twice      Don't hate on Tobe, he's a good guy.      Hey, just because I have a favorite, doesn't mean that I don't appreciate the other girls. Though the fact that 3/4th of my folder is full of Iroha pictures is a bit of a problem for me.     Does Haruno want something genuine?     Is this official art? What the hell is going on?       not having a folder just for the goddess  Come on, brother.         Think of it like when Yukino tosses insults at 8man. I love the guy too but come on.        [Iroha intensifies]    She'll take his genuine thing, then she'll make him take her sister's genuine thing.     Yukino pretty much said that Yui was reading too far into her feelings by saying "Don't decide how I feel for me."  This.       He's still dumb though, a good guy and a nice friend to have, but still stupid.    Havent been to the threads in a while. Is vol. 11 out? Has it been translated?        At least you don't go Iroha or death for now. May you live well Irohafag      Wait, could that be interpreted as her bowing out of the 8bowl or?      Read the LN.   I want her.     Don't let the shitposters and falseflags get to you. Iroha or death means more than just spaming it in all caps.       I'm a Yukinofag, but I love this art. Fucking cute.    Probably not that was part of them denying her request to stay friends.    You too anon, whomever your girl may be.   I think it's more like she dislikes the idea of Yui trying to read into her more than anything else.       Nice meme      Official, 8man, chuuni, and double Y strip card against nerds. Long story short, Yukino almost strip, 8man sacrifice his dignity, chuuni won      YOOO 8man's desk is in the wrong place!     151  Image limit incoming.       i think everyone who has top-tier taste does too anon    Iroha or Death means you won't jump ship like some YYfags did. Though it's understandable in case of Yukino, since she became party pooper-chan at second season. At least for anime-only fags.      Man, I can't believe I missed all this birthday art for her.    Oh right, forgot that was from the big exchange at the aquarium.          Yes, cute. That's certainly a word to describe them.      The one true path.                 I could say something about trusting a traitor to not turn traitor again, but I won't.  At any rate, is ship-jumping really such a sin as long as it's  genuine ?        Everyday until I'm bored. http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm264<wbr>84384 https://d.maxfile.ro/tplqqbrcmf.mp4<wbr></wbr> </wbr>   Don't forget about the image limit anons  So the Yukino copy cat scene is true after all, it's actually kind of creepy.  I wonder why 8man didn't react to this though.      Was this part of the story of a volume or just a pic description? Why did they skip it in the anime.      Did we kill the thread?      Anon that second link isn't very genuine.         Implying I give a shit  We could actually discuss this way       Explain?      Don't care either, but shouldn't we leave some image space for others who might want to post scans and such?        Editor probably messed it up   Unfortunately         Works fine for me, maxfile is just the replacement site for pomf.    Always liked this pic. Has pretty much no bearing on the plot, only lasts like 3 sentences, but gets your attention.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]    <br/>    Looks like Yui did, though.   Write a love letter to Yui RIGHT NOW.      At any rate, is ship-jumping really such a sin as long as it's genuine?  Yes.     Yeah let's just stop.    Not the editor, she says the exact same thing as 8man    Chrome/Google has problems with Maxfile for some reason. Press the "Details" link to continue.      You make a good point, but I feel like we've hit a lull with that. Maybe because it's all gonna get revealed tomorrow with the episode?      Very well, then. Ceasefire it is, unless somebody else keeps at it.     Wait, what? When did that happen?    Man don't tempt me   Yuifag dumper here, I'm willing to accept these terms.

Volume 6 from the filename, so probably when the class that switched their exhibit to a rollercoaster shoved Yukino and 8man onto the ride.    aquarium date   yui and 8man tenderly look each other in the eyes   they head home together   in bedroom   undress   yui turns to see her bare lover   it's a fish   8man still in tank           What did Yui say?  Is it that big a deal? Hachi and Yuki early in the series often said the same thing (though simultaneously)      Look what you've made me done  I'll need some caffeine after this    I worked as an editor for a children book once, since most of the sentence are x is not for y I'll just use copy paste.  I should be fired for mentioning this    Yeah that Yui poster gotta stop   Volume 6              He accidentally left stealth mode up again.    They're totally in sync.    Anime skipped it. But when Hachi and Yuki were making rounds during culture festival, one of the classes had a coaster/ride of some sort and the two of them somehow ended up on it together.

Childhood friend that has loved MC since forever   Some bitch shows up and MC is floored by her   Childhood friend loses  EVERY FUCKING TIME  KILL ALL NEWCOMERS CHILDHOOD FRIEND IS TRUE END           It's unfair but realistic.    love a guy since how long   do fucking nothing because you think you have all the time in the world   lose to the first assertive slut that shows up   wonder why you lost  Yeah. No.      They deserve it. They've had all the time in the world to make clear they want to be more than friends, but they never make a move. They don't "own" the MC just because they saw him first, they're seriously shit tier girls.    realistic  Really? All the people I've known are married usually start off with them being early romances, sometimes as early as grade school.  blog   And it always hurts when the childhood friend loses         Childhood friend has had years to confess   Has spent that time friend zoning herself instead   Childhood friends have only themselves to blame for losing.      Except that usually in reality, it always the MALE who has a crush on the FEMALE. Whereas in Nippon pop culture it always the other way around.    Childhood friend is rarely best girl. But it hurts so much when she is and she loses.     love a guy since how long   do fucking nothing because you think you have all the time in the world   lose to the first assertive slut that shows up   wonder why you lost  Yeah. No.       is pic related ? looks comfy to be a drama      Some bitch shows up and MC is floored by her  Tsunderes always win anon.        what anime, friend?    Interesting, in my case I pretty much don't know any couples like that, neither do my parents I believe. It's pretty rare for a romance to begin that early and survive all the ups and downs of puberty and beyond that follow.    Except that usually in reality, it always the MALE who has a crush on the FEMALE.  Says who?  And it's not always the other way around in manga either. In harems of course it's that way because the male is the protagonist.          childhood friends  Either act or go home. You wait, you lose.    I still hope.    All the people I've known are married usually start off with them being early romances, sometimes as early as grade school  Do you know like, one married couple?      Childhood friend that has loved MC since forever   Some bitch shows up and MC is floored by her   Childhood friend disappears for 70% of the entire story   "Bitch" gets developed and is lovable   Childhood friend comes back at the end of the manga and wins  Yeah no, fuck you.         sauce pls ?    What manga is this? Google and iqdb are being shit.     Tsunderes always win    These childhood friends wouldn't have this problem if they made a move earlier    Dagashi Kashi    No childhood friend can compare to the perfection that is Himari.  Suigintits was pretty fucking close though.    have 10+ years alone with the MC where you have literally no other female competition   a couple new girls come along and one of them manages to win him in a few months   Oh the poor childhood friend. If only she had had more time to do something about it.       Girls getting NTRd needs to happen more often.    implying Himari isn't a childhood friend by definition as well     If you've known the MC for years and nothing happened, you've pretty much lost before the competition even shows up.    Man, you guys really don't know what love is. It's not about someone that's been there for you, that's just simple fucking friendship. It's about someone you want to wake up to and live the rest of your life with. Childhood friend or not it doesn't matter, it could be anyone.     Actually, 4 of the bitches from his harem are childhood friends. How do you even manage to meet that many girls, spend years of your childhood in their presence while none of them met before the MC turned 16 while each of them is unrelated to each other?   Usually when there's a high childhood friend count there's several siblings involved, in this case there was none.       If the author could write well he wouldn't be doing shitty otaku pandering harems.   Man, the girls in Dagashi Kashi are just great.   What?        Himari was more like his childhood cat.  Same thing, I guess.   You will never have your best furry friend come back as a hot chick         This is why it's terrible. I don't mind if childhood friend loses to someone properly nice. But to a tsundere? Fuck that shit.    Silver isn't tsundere you dumb idiot.   Childhood friends DESERVE to lose. There's nothing that makes me happier than a lazy, entitled chilhood friend losing hard and bawling her eyes out. Get fucked, bitch. Should have taken the initiative ages ago.   The childhood friend losing effect is so strong, even someone as active as Manami lost in oreimo.  Manami created a gap between Kyousuke and Kirino, kept Kyousuke's self-confidence in check so he doesn't attract attention(and love rivals), made him love normalcy, which is what she excels in.    The girl who changes the MC's life tends to win since that's the direction of the story that writers usually want to write about. Childhood friends who stick around with the MC for a majority of their lives usually signify routine while the new girl brings change.  Also, they should have confessed when no one else was in the running if they really wanted to get together with the guy. The only pitiable ones are those that confessed, got friendzoned and have to watch the guy fall for a new girl while supporting him.     More like the author ran out of ideas, needed a villain and made Manami a bitch to glorify another bitch.    The retcon bullshit again, fuck off.    all these people hating on childhood friends for taking too long   Oh yeah like none of you have ever missed an opportunity because you thought life wouldn't change. Lord knows /a/ and 4chan in general are just the epitome of ambition and productiveness.     That's because they have to lose. They need to learn from experience.    Because female tends to mature faster than male. So when the time come, the female childhood friend already looks like a woman to him while the female still sees him as a  faggot .  It really is not a rare case. Ever wonder why there are so much female childhood love interest who doesn't win? The author's little self-vengeance kicked in.        Wouldn't 4chan knowing regret from that make them more qualified to judge? They knew they made a mistake, they regretted it and dealt with the consequence by living with the failure so they're more likely to not throw a pity party and pretend the girl should have won. It's not unconditional pity and it's not spitefulness.   Reminder that Silver was the objectively best girl  Likes JoJo   Has a banana phone   elder god tier hair color   wins   isn't orange         They hate childhood friends precisely BECAUSE of that.    This doesn't apply right? Hand girl wasn't tsundere.    Hotaru is superior    No, I was implying that the tsundere actually lost.     You can't hate someone for making the same mistakes you did just because you happened to make them earlier.     Says who?    Says me faggot.    Seems like we have a tough guy here!    I don't blame other people for being more productive than I was, though. If I had the advantage of an early start at something and still did worse than someone else, that's all on me.    You bet your ass bitch boy. Now you better stop having different opinions about japanese cartoon characters than me or we're gonna have some trouble.    I can if I hate past me, which I do.    Female Childhood friend finds a new boyfriend and MC sees it because MC is a betafag   Everyone shouts whore, NTR, and calls her slut.   The exact thing happens again but the to the opposite   Everyone blames the female childhood friend.       You know when she started losing? When she stopped wearing ZR.    Otaku fantasies don't include gender equality.    I don't think people would complain if the guy got with a girl and the childhood friend got over it. That's fair game. And usually, people consider the MC the stupid one in that case.    They're all faggots because they didn't aim for a harem end.   MASTER SAYA   MC gets thrown into a coma before he or his childhood friend could confess   Waits for him several years to wake up   MC wakes up   Finds out girls started pity dating some other guy until you wake up   She eventually falls in love with the guy   MC's heart gets shattered after waking up from the coma  You all know which one I'm talking about.          I don't think people would complain   You're funny anon.  You know there's a reason girls in VNs absolutely NEVER get on with another male when the MC doesn't choose their route.(Unless it's a masochistic/NTR VN) There have been plenty of cases of otaku boycotting and burning down entire series because of a female heroine having a relationship with someone else.          people call sluts sluts  WOW O W       I honestly don't,    insecure otaku please go    Normalfag pls go, being on any dick but my dick means filthy whore.     You know there's a reason girls in VNs absolutely NEVER get on with another male when the MC doesn't choose their route  I can understand them throwing a shitfit if you are forced to see them being all lovey dovey and her getting fucked while you accidentaly run into them or something but just her ending up with some other guy?     It's not girls fault your dick is too small for them to even find.    Yes.  Why would you think any different of otaku. You should know they're among the most petty, insecure, pathetic people in the world. They're like /r9k/ and /jp/ combined, in much greater numbers.      This is why I have a hard time playing VNs, because I played one, went through every route and realized that if I pick any one of the girls, all others life are a shitfest because I won't be there for them.  I know they're imaginary, but still. It ain't fair.        my face when playing White Album 2 CODA  I wish Setsuna would just fall in love with another guy so she could finally be happy and leave it all behind.     You should incredibly butthurt.     You should incredibly butthurt.     I couldn't play more of Grisaia becasue I tried trice and ended up un Michiru route all the times. I understand your feelings.    I meant 'sound'. The effects of 24 hours of no sleep.    At least it is not Yume Miru Kusuri.    Long night of desperate attempts at trolling and shitposting neetboy?    I hate myself, though, that's why I can hate them too.     best girl of the freaking manga   confesses her love almost at daily basis    she's aware of her faults and is trying to improve to become a better person for her beloved    still the author decides that she has - 1000 chances of winning the RakuBowl    Yeah... Fuck you Naoshi.         last to show up never wins   Don't worry, she will die before Raku rejects her.    It'll probably happen, in 10 years or so when she'll basically settle. Kazusa on Setsuna's end on the other hand, nope.     And there is only one to blame! Fuck you  Anno !    Kazusa needs MC, there's no one else that could save her from that shitty life.    I wish. Atleast then I would have had fun.   You're fucking kidding me right. If this was the reverse where the childhood friend was a guy and the main love interest was a chick, he'd deserve to lose if he didn't take any initiative.  /a/ would go nuts if he won and didn't take initiative.  Reverse the genders again where the main love interest is the male protagonist and the childhood friend is a girl, and the truth stays the same. She was happy with her situation and didn't do shit to change things so of course she'll lose. She deserves to lose.        Being completely honest I would prefer that happen instead of being friendzoned by the worst MC ever.    Yeah, a/ is filled with hypocrites.    But she's not in kampfer or infinite stratos.    Oh crap. Someone already did that post. Should've read more.    I hate both series but I can sure you, there's no worse MC than Raku.    Really? There's one choice for each route, and maybe 1 or 2 more early on that don't matter.   I do agree Michiru was the easiest route to end up in, though. As opposed to jumping headfirst into romance, in her route Yuuji starts off just wanting to know what the hell is wrong with her head.      I don't think you've seen as many shows as you think if you think Raku is the worst MC in all of anime history    read Uwakoi   childhood friend &amp; MC dating   he, regularly, fucks other girls behind her back   won't even touch or fuck her   they haven't gotten further than a kiss    Here we have an active childhood friend &amp; MC still fucked her over.          Uwakoi  For a second I was about to call you a retard because I mistook it for Uwagaki.     Well MC is retarded to the max.  And shes batshit insane.      Not the worst but saving some exceptions who doesn't even deserves to be mentioned, trust me this shit is going to have a Harem ending.    No, I just couldn't bring myself to pay attention to other girls. I'd end up replaying the Michiru route everytime.     Girls aren't supposed to take initiative.    That's why girls that do are best girls.    Says who?   Most childhood friends are terrible  Also, Silver isn't a tsundere     More like "hanged" ending to me when it comes to Nisekoi. Never read kampfer but IS do will have a harem ending, I believe    Gender norms. A girl taking initiative is just the fantasy of some otaku, like femdom.    Did your muslim father tell you that?   <br/>   Anime is escapism, why subject it to the same limits of real life?    That only happens if you are ugly    What if the new girl who showed up from nowhere was secretly also a childhood friend?     She was even longer the childhood friend     What if you all had amnesia and all along everyone was childhood friends?    The term "childhood friend" describes a very specific character type with pretty obvious traits. You can have a childhood friend who isn't a "childhood friend" at all and vice versa.     a very specific character type with pretty obvious traits  Like what? I call bullshit      So Nisekoi?    Childhood friend and new love interest become best friends   They drop MC because he's a cheating faggot and their friendship is more important to them  White Album is GOAT.     I hate linking to this rotten website but I don't feel like typing all this shit out. http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.p<wbr>hp/Main/PatientChildhoodLoveInteres<wbr>t</wbr></wbr>     Are you sure you watched White Album?     female friendships   more important  choose one       Well minus childhood friend     Final Fantasy 8 also   what about cross game. im talking about wakaba   Persona 2 IS as well.    Kimi ga Nozomu Eien?    Fuck that manga.    Poor Kaname.    name please?    Every single high school romance I know breaks down after high school  something about being in different colleges and being surrounded by sex.   But that's just America, other countries are probably that case I heard some countries engage you at an early age and the two parties just have to deal with it (Japan should probably do that for their birthrate thing).        they don't always win  it's just when they do it's usually the most infuriating one.      People in this thread that are hating the childhood friend were also the guys who laugh at the betafags who get NTR'd  Whereas the ones who love the childhood friend are usually the one that calls the unfaithful love interests NTRing whores.     One of the few examples of the osananajimi wins, and she was worst girl.  Guess who I am talking about.     I demand bullshit from both genders when the situation is set  fucking Midori no Hibi  but if I have to be complete honest I'm more biased towards the girls when things like this Happen and tend to blame more the fucktard beta MC.    Koi to senkyo to choco?    bingo     Chosen releases love interest, who is supposed to be a cursed child, from a cell because she feels keeping a girl in a cell is a pretty shitty thing to do   Cursed child pays her back by wishing their roles get reversed    Chosen girl becomes a cursed girl and is kept in a prison   Love interest leaves her to die    Years later Love interest and MC meets and the Cursed girl goes to the big bad's side due to all the abuse she had in her life   Cursed girl finds the MC and falls for him   Only to find that he's in a relation with the bitch that fucked over life   Fights ensue    Epilogue the MC is about to die   Cursed child sacrifices herself to save the MC   We get a a flashback on how shitty her life is after the love interest fucks her over   MC shacks with the love interests and completely forgets about the Cursed child afterwards    I'll give you a cookie if you can guess this manga.                    I jumped blind into the series becasue I liked her design and I was told she won, god what a mistake that turned out to be      This. Childhood friend is best girl more than 99.99% of the time. She only loses to some random chick the MC has no chemistry with is because the law of clichés predetermined the ending before the series began.     Really they have a better chance   whether the girl will get the MC might depend on whether or not the MC still remembers her. Thus it is imperative for the childhood friend to always erase his memories and move out of the neighborhood during grade school if she wants a chance      Sooo Yumekui Merry?    Thats nothing. You should read the VN.     best girl of hte manga  I'm sorry anon, but all girls are best girl except her, she's overbearing as fuck and makes retarded plans which force people to do what she wants to do     I suffered enough already. I just want to forget about it.    Best girl. Pour a 40 out for a dead homie.  Pic related     What she does is the thing we're debating here, she's being accretive and straightforwarded with her love unlike the rest which does nothing but blush and hit the stupid moron MC, if she just stood there and do nothing like the others she would deserve to lose but she's taking a bet and fighting for what she wants.   Childhood friends always lose, while childhood love interests win all the time. It's almost like there's some word in there as a hint he might just not be that into you.   How many people have you known? Two?    That was a pretty nice train at the end though.    I made this for you Marika is a harrasser     It's a thing in Japan, its like hotter for them if the girl doesn't make the first move or something, rather she just puts the moves out there and sees if he responds.    So please locate the other girls in that graphic and elaborate why are they better.    Rihoko, every childhood friend in Shounen Shoujo, and a few others won.  Rihoko just wasn't the first in line to win there      Don't take me wrong, I like Marika. But her attitude is not fit for a "winner", that's all.    That is literally nothing like Yumekui Merry.     Childhood friend is best girl more than 99.99% of the time   She only loses to some random chick the MC has no chemistry with      I'm laughing at you right now    Messiah or whatever  the SnO author and his suffering fetish      My memory is a bit fuzzy but wasn't she also extremely powerful, as in she cold have killed the good guys at any moment if she wanted but instead kept her attacks at a level were they would power up, basically training them?    ITT: plump animu posterieurs.   Oh wow some guy drew two big circles. I'm not impressed     not liking big circles  how will you find a wife in america?      I'd make her butt sore on new year's.     top cuck     not impressed   Mombutts are so best always.      &gt;inb4 not animu     Large asses are unnatural and disgusting, reminds of female niggers.   Bugger off Ireland.     loli butt    Pull over    I am sorry I can't see it. Can somebody circle it?    This. They're gross.     Fuck off, /pol/lock      large asses are disgusting    My brother         he doesn't like large but firm black asses  low test tbh       Perfectly balanced.    Don't have a screenshot at hand but Meme from Denpa Onna's ass was, as my african american brethren would say, OFF DA HOOK.     Fuck off back to tumblr, shitskin. Or better yet shouldn't you be in a church?      waaah, go back to a site that has nothing to do with anything   Get bent, retard.         And then there's these assholes.      Same. Fuck this trend. What's worse is when fanart of characters with balanced proportions constantly exaggerates their ass size.   There were some fine booties in lycra shorts in yowapedal.  Here come the flat asses.  "Large asses were a mistake." -God   Why is gigantic anime ass so delicious           Go shove a potato up your ass, Liarland.          Not liking big asses  Go back to your lolishit and/or plebeian boob preferences        Butts are usually very circular so it should be good for you.             The butts in Glass Mask 2005 are very noticeable However I will not post butt of musume        I never did finish watching this.       moving around to make the ass more fuckable    Oh jhesis.      The manga was terrible    I know this shit is not from a hentai. What is the context?    I'm uh I'm gonna need a source on this     Kanokon      God Her butt is so perfect. I wish her sisters was as good.      God   Her butt is so perfect. I wish her sisters was as good.  Ryuko's is nice but her boobs are better than Satsuki's.     Asses are nature's miracles   You're right. Cheers for appreciating all of the femininely bounties.     You took the words right out of my mouth.    A delicate balance is nirvana, though if I had to choose, I'd prefer a flatter chest with a more plush butt.     A delicate balance is nirvana, though if I had to choose, I'd prefer a flatter chest with a more plush butt.  I'd go the exact opposite with that.     It's good we can agree to disagree in the most appropriate of manners.    Each to their own.     It's good we can agree to disagree in the most appropriate of manners.  Can't agree on everything now can we? Oh, well at least we can post pictures of butts.   Nice butt.       For some reason I imagine satsuki really liking anal. I am not sure why, but I always imagine her talking about having enough resolve to pleasure her lover with all of her body or something like that.    Couldn't agree more. I'm just refreshed by the civility of it all.    This is a cute boy     For some reason I imagine satsuki really liking anal.  So I'm not the only one.   I am not sure why, but I always imagine her talking about having enough resolve to pleasure her lover with all of her body or something like that.  Sounds like her talking to herself during puberty.   Couldn't agree more. I'm just refreshed by the civility of it all.  So do big butts bring civilized conversations?          bonus feet if ur into taht kinda shit     Please don't meme shame her.  Also, lolis with plump yet stiff round asses are also exquisite miracle.       So do big butts bring civilized conversations?  Perhaps so.      This is a cute boy      Perhaps so.  Let's keep going on with this. We may be on to something.     This could very well be the start of a profound new philosophy.    Satsuki would be incredibly competitive during sex. If you brought up liking liking anal she would let you fuck her ass every single day until you got sick of it. If you brought up enjoying femdom, she would tie you up and take care of all your "needs" until the chair you were tied to was stained with semen and vaginal fluids. I can almost imagine if you brought up wanting an FFM threesome, she would bring you a harem and not feel slightly jealous because she knows no one would choose anyone over her.    It is one that I can, for a lack of better words, get behind.     tfw no alpha female      Satsuki would be incredibly competitive during sex.  Meaning?   If you brought up liking liking anal she would let you fuck her ass every single day until you got sick of it. If you brought up enjoying femdom, she would tie you up and take care of all your "needs" until the chair you were tied to was stained with semen and vaginal fluids. I can almost imagine if you brought up wanting an FFM threesome, she would bring you a harem and not feel slightly jealous because she knows no one would choose anyone over her.  I like. I have a feeling that she would be still dominate or establish dominance.        What kind of father lets his daughter dress like that        You're the whitest man on this board right now. How does it feel?   裏私利物か?      My kind of thread  These threads are so pointless on a sfw board. What's the point of butt without butthole. It's like cake without icing. http://gelbooru.com/index.php?page=<wbr>post&amp;s=view&amp;id=2739661</wbr>       You're the whitest man on this board right now.  I wish this meme would die     She would be in control, but not necessarily control you if the distinction between the two is clear enough. She would know how to get you like what she likes without forcing it upon you. The only person she might get jealous of is Ryuuko if you were caught ogling her.    An absentee one.    I don't like excessive icing on my cake. Plus, straight up ass cheeks are quite fun in their own way. Read between the cracks, Anon.  Also, if anyone has any Togame from Katanagatari I'd be quite grateful.        why have i not seen this image before?    A very bad one.    ?     She would be in control, but not necessarily control you if the distinction between the two is clear enough. She would know how to get you like what she likes without forcing it upon you. The only person she might get jealous of is Ryuuko if you were caught ogling her.  I get it now. Me I'm for her sister more. I don't think Ryuko would have any preferences and would just want to have fun in the bed.     I pretty much need nothing but this in my life, Anon.   Why does everyone look like girls in part 5  The 80's were a different time  Because Araki likes to spice things up every now and a gain   Because your gender prejudice is too strong.      But Part 5 was serialized between '95 and '99.   Forget looking like girls, almost everyone has that same fucking face and build.  Fuck Araki, he sold his drawing talent in exchange for eternal youth.    I think he means the chronology   Early part 5 is arguably the worst art   really the biggest art change happened in Part 4    But mid part 4 was arguably the best    It's set in the 2000s    The worst is fucking 6. I cant believe this isn't general consensus.     There is literally no one in that image that I don't want to fuck in the vagina, wtf?!    To be fair that's entirely possible - he'd been trying to go with a female main protagonist since part 2 but his editors kept cockblocking him so he went "fuck it!" and just made them all reverse traps.  That and part 5 marked the point when he seemed to go more towards fashion models as body shape inspiration.            well, late 4 and early 5.     How is Bruno even standing like this? Are his feet glued to the ground?       But mid part 4 was arguably the best  that doesn't mean that the art didn't change.     I'm reading part 7 and I think sometimes Araki forgets that Johnny can't walk. The way he easily moves around is not something he could do crawling.  I want to ravage Narancia's boy pussy   I dunno.     Heyzeus's legs help him     I don't think the early 4 panel is representative.    Narcinia is best girl    Late 6 looks like shit, especially Jolyne that looks like a tranny.    The other thread got deleted it seems and there was some decent discussion in it too. Just don't name threads "edition" or "general" anymore, hopefully that will take the heat off.       sounds like the work of a moderator's stand     Are mods really deleting JoJo generals? Fucking finally.   A crack down on generals would severely increase the quality of the board.       What is 「GRAVITY」? Green baby don't hurt me     I thought they were purging them because there are usually multiple up at a time.   While the threads were fun there's nothing to talk about until JJL chapters/EoH trailer/general announcements of a Jojo nature. If jojofags really need a thread at the most have one weekly.  Why didn't Kira just use Sheer Heart Attack in the mansion instead on relying on slow ass air bubbles?   The one holding the knife is actually a girl... right?    A new chapter did just come out and we've actually had some unusually in-depth discussion about it over the last few days despite not even having a text translation yet. I understand why they'd want to get rid of generals but I think it's a real shame it happens just when all the cancer DIO's World brought in is finally clearing up.   That're some manly girls.   /ag/ when?    Nope    Because Araki just forgot.    Apparently the /a/ sings Jojo is going to be starting soon, someone said last thread that Jebus was going to pick it up. We should just stick to those threads.     Never.     Late part 7 is my favourite.    /r/ing an edit with them in the Gangstars' outfits and/or faces.    Early Part 3 was the best.     Because he knew they were aware of how it worked and he can only use one type of bomb at the time.     But Josuke couldn't do anything against it anyway,only Koichi could.   Araki got tired of drawing manly homos so he switched to twink homos.    He could divert it long enough to punch barrage Kira to death if he set something on fire.     Josuke could just punch it and it'd go back to Kira as his hand.    Early and Mid Part 7 was awesome, Araki started to suffer from his sameface syndrome around Late Part 7 and he has never stopped since then.    If he used Crazy Diamond's healing ability, it would go back to his left hand. Also, then he wouldn't be able to do anything offensively in that time period.    Actually at this point there's more variety than there was during either late 7 or the scratch nose era.   can anyone give me name of a music that is played during almost entire the world part from anime?   Darkness of the world i think.    Araki went through a David Bowie phase while writing part 5.     Araki had just learned to draw different faces around mid part 4 only to revert back to his sameface style in the next volume   Truly sad.  I think he hasn't found an equilibrium yet.        He got sick of people comparing his characters and artwork to Hokuto no Ken so instead of manly characters he went the opposite route and made them FABULOUS instead.    i love you     It's more like he didn't have to imitate HnK and buff 80's action stars once they went out of fashion and he became established enough to do his own thing when part 3 ended.     Didn't he lose it with his left hand?    It might just be my fetish for white hair talking, but I don't blame the Japs for liking Fugo as much as they do just because of his design.    I guess that worked out for him because that's what people prefer for him now, I mean fuck look at all the shit he's done since adapting that style.   NEWS ALERT-Actual Discussion approaching  http://jjlscans.tumblr.com/post/122<wbr>355928463/jojolion-44-delay   This month’s chapter is taking awhile because the store is slow to stock this issue and our Day 1 contact is hard to get in touch with this week.    Expect the chapter sometime really soon    Edited for brevity.       </wbr>     Fuck you.    No fuck you leatherman!    I liked the muscle bound style before part 4. Then everyone including Jotaro and Polnareff turned into fruit boys. There's manly fabulous and then there's faggot fabulous.    Both are acceptable as long as the source material is enjoyable. Like LotGH for example. Full of fruit boys, but still a great piece of work.     Early part 1 will always be objectively the worst.      it took me a while but damn.  J♂J♂     How did JoJo defeat DIO?   DIO stopped time   Crushed JoJo   JoJo apparently escaped via stopping time himself  But JoJo could move when DIO previously stopped time, so why did JoJo's time stop affect DIO?        I need the pastebin guys    I totally agree with you, Mid Part 4 is beautiful.     calling Jotaro JoJo     In terms of story and characters the first 3 parts were the best, series went to shit after he was forced to make it more mainstream     http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     DIO's♂DARK♂FANTASY    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     Jotaro could move for 2 seconds within DIO's time stop   DIO can stop time for 9 seconds (as High DIO)   Jotaro stops time at the 9 second mark   DIO can move for two more seconds (now 11 seconds)   DIO can't move anymore         The youngest JoJo is the relevant JoJo     Implying   tfw Araki will never ever make women as beautiful as in Phantom Blood.      DIO seemingly crushed Jotaro to death before the 11 second mark    Because Araki is a massive faglord, but a cool faglord.    Those are 12 year olds.    I know. It's ridiculous but you just have to go with it. Araki is known for drawing things happening and then having a character say it didn't happen.  Wheel of Fortune burning Jotaro for example and then just saying it was his coat.       not colouring the painting on the wall  lazy colour job      Implying  He started excelling with females at part 4     I love how Araki used to draw women, even before Jojo. Gorgeous Irene is really  gorgeous.     The anatomy's kind of crap but the faces are truly gorgeous. So expressive.      So since they found it necessary to notify us this time I'm assuming we might not even get it this month.  Shit happens and all that and I do appreciate that we get scanlations at all, but I just really want to discuss Karera and Josefumi with you guys.      Looks like early part 1.     Fugo is not blonde  Welp.     Nobody here know enough japanese to translate it?    Yeah, Gorgeous Irene is really wild.    They said to expect it really soon, I don't think that there's anything strange about them giving us an explanation for being a few days late.    It is.    I like it, looks original. I do like Part 8 art a lot but, the sameface is kind of annoying sometimes.     Can someone explain what they're even wearing?    Clothes.    Now here's Gorgeous Irene with the Steel Ball Run art style.    I fucking hate it, how did Araki lose the ability to draw expressions on people's faces?.  Look at this Gyro from mid Part 7       He started diversifying after Paper Moon King, I think it's a telltale sign that he became aware of it.      Now look at this one from Late Part 7, that expression on his face it's terrible, it doesn't look sexy, or intimidating, nothing.     I'll give you late 7 and very early 8 but here's plenty of expression now. Our main character this time is the kind of guy who doesn't show his emotions much to the people who normally surround him, but look at the others around him.      He looks like Iggy before having a human face   Oh God. People really shouldn't be trying this early to guess the designs.  How long do we have to wait an announcement of Part 4 anime?  Like a month ago someone told me to do the phonetically matched lyrics for Jonathan's Ballad. So, uh, here it is I guess.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RwN<wbr>jSwZD8e8</wbr>  [ ]     Awful.    Jojolion Volume 10. We first saw the Iggy promo on a flyer from the Volume.    Please don't use Casca as a reaction image, it'll make me feel bad for fapping to her getting raped.  I wish she enjoyed it as much as I did.    Gyro SAS announced.   I'm pretty curious to see how he'd draw him now. Karera gets a lot of really good panels in this month's chapter and her thick eyebrows reminded me of her a bit.    That's pretty nice, i love the song and Jonathan.    Damn, that's fucking nice, It makes me really appreciate Johnathan.    As dorky as it is to say, I understand why the guy yesterday said Jonathan was his favorite Jojo now.    Jonathan has always been my favorite Jojo     tfw we'll never get an OVA/HFTF The World    This should have played when Jotaro kill DIO.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Yqt<wbr>JqKgemw4</wbr>  [ ]     Making the video was such a treat for myself as well because Jonathan is also my favorite JoJo.     No Diego SAS   No Shadow DIO SAS   You'll never have 5 different Dio SAS figures        Jonathan is the kindest and most gentle JoJo in the entire series. He's Kenshiro if he wasn't so stoic.    Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?   I would let Diego fuck my ass<br/>     Where is the Pucci SAS, and the Whitesnake     Would you fuck your favorite jjba character?  That's like an anon if they breathe air.      no diego  it hurts.    At some point he played so much with the clothes that forgot the faces.   They did say they were doing more villain part 5 SAS then they'll move on to 7. Have hope anon.      Can't unsee young Dio      Italian civilian clothing To blend in     YOU THOUGHT IT WAS DIO? NO, IT WAS I, IRINE.     No, this is Dio.     Purest Jojo didn't deserve that fate   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DMj<wbr>hY98bf-g</wbr>  [ ]  I love DIO's adventures as a nun under a bridge in Japan.    Ｓｉｍｐｌｅ Ｓｕｂｊｅｃｔｓ Ｓｗｉｎｄｌｅｄ Ｓｗｉｆｔｌｙ ｆｏｒ Ｓｈｅｋｅｌｓ...  ...「ｓ4ｓ」     You lost. Now leave.    Far more HnK than JJBA.    This is the only good JJBA AMV I've ever seen in my life, and i'm not crying.    I wasn't trying, that was just the best image I have of [s4s]-tan    And to think I was just going to but the lyrics on a black screen to avoid being grouped in with the AMV crowd.    Araki can just recreate the late part 3/mid part 4 look can't he. If so, why doesn't he do that whenever he redraws characters from old parts. Jonathan looks like a downie in all the recent drawings. The Kenshiro look suited him.   J♂J♂'s Bizzare L♂cker R♂♂m    Because he can't recreate them.    what is the fastest stand? besides Made in Heaven of course   I heard he could. He said that in the J♂j♂nium volumes. He prefers the faggot statue of david sameface art.    possibly silver chariot without armor     Mind to post a link?   Weather Report when?      SUTAR PURACHIMA    Possibly. Even with armor, it matched Star Platinum in speed.    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1XT<wbr>gcfwi_L8</wbr>  [ ] Did Kakyoin and Dio engage in homosex in Egypt, other than the fisting?     Fall♂off♂your♂horse    Now I want to reread/rewatch Phantom Blood. People seem to forget about how interesting it is because of the other parts, myself included.    they look the fucking same    DIO was his first friend.    He doesn't care how any old character looks after their part has ended and they'll never appear in the manga again. Check this out, it's from part 4's time.   He also doesn't care much for Jonathan. Back when he made his top 10 he was the only Jojo not on it.      Ah. Right there. Right there was the start of the downward spiral into sameface and scratched n♂ses.      Dio knew Kakyoin better than any of his other "friends" did       Still no C-moon.   ;-;   Spiral staircase.      No, that was always the way it was with old characters. Part 3 style Ikuro and Part 3 style young Joseph were just Jotaros, and Joseph and Jonathan looked the same a lot of the time to begin with.    what was that stand that moved through electricity? that may be the fasted     No C-Moon   No MiH      You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan. I'd say it was part 3 that it became difficult to tell between the faces. Especially between Kekyoin and J♂tar♂.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=V-B<wbr>Bt29m0I8</wbr>  [ ]   Kakyoin had a longer mouth and thinner eyebrows. He also didn't had a more colder facial expression rather than that eternally pissed look that Jotaro always had.    they specifically state that it's useless against josuke     You could still tell between J♂seph and J♂nathan  You couldn't even tell between Dio and Caesar     It doesn't really fit.   Can Yotsuba beat Jotaro?   Yes.   Well, now that the season is over I'm gonna probably start reading part 7, but I'd still like something to watch. Do you fellas have any recommendations for some fun, silly shonen like JoJo?   hokuto no ken    Between the different girls? Araki has never had much variety between female faces but I'd say he's doing quite a bit better than usual in that regard this time around. Hato is particularly distinct, but I wouldn't mistake Yasuho, Karera, or Daiya for each other either.    ya ya ya    They've never looked like women. Abandon your meme    Is there any way to download the Heritage for the Future OST (without using a Youtube downloader)?     Isn't it in the pastebin?    The OST? i don't think so.    Holy shit you're right Cheers, dude     You shouldn't ask for recommendations on /a/ but what the hell, Read Devilman, you've always got to read Devilman.  That or Berserk, but you've probably already read Berserk, who hasn't? Once both are done, try reading Parasyte, emphasis on "reading". If you're more into comedy, watch Detroit Metal City, or GTO. Both are ridiculous yet enjoyable shows.   Some other great stuff to consider. Grapper Baki Golgo 13  Cromartie High Getter Robo VIOLENCE HERO Riki-Oh.  MD Geist is overblown and fucking ridiculous but you might like it or you might hate it. Inferno Cop. Legend of koizumi is short but sweet. It's about three Ovas long.   If you’d rather read more manga try, Keiji of the Flowers at the Other Side of the Clouds. It was written by the original author of Fist of the North Star. Also Kyou Kara Ore Wa is a good manga. Its a comedy but the characters are manly as fuck. Its like Cromartie High but better.  Bonus: If you’re a sadist, pick up Wolfsmund.  This list should be enough until you learn to pick up the spoon.                         YUKAKO LOOKS LIKE A STEPPED ON BABY    Not him but thanks, i've seen most of the stuff on your list but I could never find more like it and google fails me.    Araki wanted to be a fashion designer, for Gucci. He started JoJo after they refused to employ him. http://www.style.com/slideshows/fas<wbr>hion-shows/spring-2016-menswear/man<wbr>/collection/7</wbr></wbr>        You could, Di♂ is much more fabulous than Caesar    Why don't they have nipples?    Please no, i don't want the thread to be deleted again.   Anyone else think Josuke was being a dick to Yasuho? He just ran off with the other bitch   ability to load songs from your hard drive into ASB during battle   DIO vs Kakyoin   El Cairo   Noriaki Kakyoin's Theme       This is impressively edited   has anyone put the HFTF WRYYY over the anime scene?   The thread is going to be fine.     Why does everyone look like girls in part 5   You're telling me they're not?      i don't see how giving every female a manface is excelling m8     meme   Resorting to buzzwords when you can't defend your point      Nah, I'm sure Yotsuba's stand would be [MONEY FOR NOTHING] in the form of pic related    Previous thread  Summaries still happening  Reminder that Yoshino is a slut       He becomes the next Hokage!    xyz plebs   &gt;tfw Tohka in charge in using retard's deck        hollowed  Is this supposed to be "flattened", or is he screaming? It'd be "hollering", in that case.   I wish you a good luck  all good luck   did not replied  reply   but Yoshino tell her   told  Mostly tense confusion.                He aims to become the pirate king of the ninjas.    Looks like Yuzuru's got a great Kaguya impression.   Will Togashi die before he finishes Hunter X Hunter?   No.   He's dead already. this is the biggest Jump's conspiracy.   He's only 49 years old, so no.    So him being "sick" or "injured" is just Jump stalling for time as they try to warp the series for their own sinister gain? Everything makes sense now.   So what's his deal, is he addicted to Idolmaster too?  Also who the fuck is spamming HxH threads and why?   Its called Dragon Quest dad    Even if he were 18 he would die before finishing HxH    Forget about HxH, read a better manga.    You're thinking of Miura, Togashi plays DQ.  Someone who can't use the catalog.      How do you find something better than a masterpiece?     HxH is a masterpiece  Fucking kek.     U haven't read it.    Nausicaa     tumblr     Name a better shounen.    Where else would i get these dank gifs?     moron still thinks that Kentaro Miura still plays The Idolmaster  He does many things. You just don't know what he does.     JoJo    Urusei Yatsura    That's the only good part of hunter x hunter    KeitAi.     gay ass japanese title  Fuck that. kill yourself you fucking nerd      Only shounen manga can be a masterpiece   wut?    Why would you use those shitty quality short tumblr gifs?   ebin    NNT, Toriko and One Piece.    It's a masterpiece in the battle shonen type manga.    Its too silly to compare but it is good tbh.   Is this the bait thread?   A masterpiece in the shittiest genre, wow!    Fairy Tail.    That's not harem.    I never said that.    At least harem can have good girls, fighter shounens are just shitty sausage shits    Lol     At least harem can have good girls  Opinion discarded.     You havent read hunter x hunter    Ok.    Well, there are lots of IM games. It takes time after all.    Can't believe these losers actually see naked female cartoon characters as a plus.    Where do you think you are.    And even if you were 18 you'd still live out your entire life without ever getting a gf. Instead of sitting on your ass all day cutting yourself over hxh how about you go do something fucking productive and try to make some good out of your useless life.    You're such a dumb boy.    They also have annoying voices.

Just something nice and cozy would be perfect. Warm, cute, fun.  Reiterating what you already said.  Now lets look at your post at large. You posted this at the tail end of the WWD on Sunday. Double dipping is extremely frowned upon. The requesters that do double dip shoot themselves in the foot and get late or less deliveries.  So my advice is simple. Unfuck yourself and try to make it seem like you have been here longer than 10 fucking minutes.                   we should just call these request threads  Requesting Hori and Miyamura having cute, yet awkward first-time sex or more of Miyamura 'abusing' or treating Hori roughly because she likes it. Total Maledom, or having Hori being his pet bitch in pet-play  Requesting list-tan  Requesting Katai and Inori doing something cute together, like shopping for red hair ties and/or putting on a dozen of them.

Requesting a drawing of whatever you think 4chan would be as a person    Do what you want, if that's your thing. I don't mind.      glad to see we both feel the same    Requesting Misaka in a leotard, thigh-highs, and bunny ears. While blushing and looking somewhat embarrassed.   Yeah i kinda realized it my self should wouldn't look absolutely great in one. But i still want to see her in one.    Look forward to the potential deliveries!          Which Kurumi? clock?    That's a request better suited for /b/. Please keep it anime related.    What's with all the feet people? Everyone knows  thighs  are the best part of the body.      Vert as a slut; piercings, a tramp-stamp, skimpy clothes, etc Or wearing Hestia's outfit (from DanMachi) to make her breasts look even larger  I agree  thighs and butts go hand-in-hand.        You. I like you.     Yeah, sorry. I'm more of a lurker than a poster. When I got the chance to do this, I kind of went a little overboard.   I'm a bit of an autistic dumbass, I know. I'll try to keep the posts to a minimum next time. And not clog up the threads.      Mah nigga, zettai ryouiki is the best    With this in mind...  Requesting intercrural with Kurumi Tokisaki.      I meant put in the dog, not put it in the dog. But whatever makes you happy, I'm fine with!    Wait what. Holy crap, that's nicely drawn.    footfags  Subhumans, the lot of you.

Do i have to be able to draw or can I just come talk?    So basically just keep drawing and eventually an instinct will develop. Just like almost every other thing in art.     Yep.

As a Echidna? http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Echidna</wbr>    Also, despite what I said here  In which I already had her on my list, I have moved all my efforts to the WWD. So any requests for monster girls here will not be me. However, I fully endorse it and eagerly await what gets produced.   Huh, Been a while since I haven't thought of this series. Yeah, let's do this I guess, hooray for sexual confusion and denseness. Setting up stream. https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>      The circle is more of a group of friends, rather than people who try to milk drawings off each other. If you come in with the thought of waifu trades, chances are you won't be added.  You can just come talk in the stream and make friends with people, it's quite fun.       2.5 days      I think you're probably doing whatever you're trying to do wrong.  Probably. He asked for color. I think I fucked up quoting, too. <br/>     oic. Yeah, you quoted right now. Nice coloring.    My bad. I think I copypasted the wrong link there.  Thanks though!      The sinister, conspiracytard term for when 2 or more drawfags are friends.  whats wrong with drawfags being friends?     Interesting. I'm surprised you went with a member of the Lamia family. Was thinking you would go for golem, dyrad, or another plant mamono.  Either way.  added to the list.       People get frustrated when their requests aren't filled, so when they see drawfags becoming friends and sometimes drawing for each other, they get frustrated and paranoid that the "circle" hates them, or that the circle is too busy drawing for each other to draw for anyone else, and think that's why they're not getting anything.    Can;t go wrong with lamias, though.    Why would a drawfag draw for another drawfag when a drawfag could just draw their own shit. I don't really get it.   As someone whos learning to draw, I'd rather try to draw my request myself than request it, im sure some other drawfags feel similar.       Seeing your waifu/OC/favorite character in someone else's art style is fun, especially if you especially admire that style. It's also a social thing, like buying lunch for the other drawfag.  Also, even really excellent drawfags tend to massively underrate their own work and overrate the work of others in comparison to their own (I can't draw eyes that well, therefore this other guy is better than me), so art trades often feel like a good deal even between equally skilled drawfags.      because I can't draw for shit and I like seeing people who can draw actually draw her. but not having a waifu means I never get to see her drawn. life is suffering.      Thank you very much for coloring the drawing anon it looks even better. Have a good one.     I like seeing people draw the waifu I don't have     Color: http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48121  I'm no good with color, and I don't like leotards, specifically this one, it kind of looks like a onsie.  I tried. Hope you like it.    </wbr>    Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray). It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling. Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.     I pretend to have a waifu so people draw something for me.  I just miss having fun drawing stupid shit with friends, now all the people I used to do it with are either "artists" or don't give shits anymore.     Cute. Why didn't you post the color? Looks good.    That line going down her face and neck on the color version is triggering my autism     The irc is dead all the time  What are you even saying?      requesting Tamamo from FateExtra in this also more underboob art    im was bored, so here's a quick doodle. dont count it as a delivery though   Requesting color ref: http://imgur.com/a/gKT2l#0     I just spent the last hour skimming though the MG encyclopedia before I finally cut myself off, and holy crap that is a deep rabbit hole.     It's incredibly cute! Extra points for the dog!  Thanks so much!       Thanks draw friend! The very fact that your tried makes me happy. Theres no way I cant appreciate it!  The Gekota is a nice touch. Ashamed that it never even crossed my mind.   Thanks again!        I want lewd with Misaki Shokuhou from Railgun and Miku Izayoi from Date a Live Both have mind-controlling abilities.    Some are pretty damn lewd.   Girtablilu is the lewdest imo.

Requesting Issei from High School DxD with his full Balance Breaker ( Ddraig and Albion arms) doing Hell And Heaven move from GaoGaiGar https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EnV<wbr>lcBXpTtc</wbr>  [ ]    im not kogasafag    They probably wouldn't anyway. The wrt one would do is tease you into making you think they're gonna eat you, and then empty yu out.      Manticore will never tear Tanpopofag to shreds and feast on his flesh  Why live?     OR here, it's ok if you were a little late, but the coloring actually is nice, thank you and have a good night!  I think I'll probably add Eyeshield 21 to my watchlist.     No problem, I hope you have a good night as well!   You should read it instead, everyone's way more beautiful in the manga       Most of them are 2lewd4me   Posting the  delivery.

Even if some descriptions are cute, I'm extremely tame when it comes to monsterizing my waifu. "Add-ons" like ears, tails, or wings are about as far as I'd go. No swapping limbs for non-human versions.    Bruh I have no idea if this is what you wanted. Hope you like it, and that it's what you wanted.      doesn't want a cyborg waifu  literally shit taste.     This is why I'm hesitant to draw unsolicited. A waifu is very special to the requester. I would hate to violate her in the mind of the requester. However like you mentioned. There are plenty that look very human.    Not sure about that neck twist though.    stream link?    Kind of shaft-ish huh, I hear ya, I'll take more care next time.  https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=StrongerDF</wbr>      I'd say as long as you keep it simple (tail, ears, maybe whiskers) most requesters will be fine with it.    Prim and proper in public, but a sub-human beast in bed who screams hard and bites her lover's shoulders whenever she is fucking him. And she loves raw anal.  Draw both sides of Ikaruga, perhaps the former mainly in a sexual act, suggestive, or completely SFW.    I don't even know why I'm doing this. Some dude already did it    Would someone be willing to draw Yukari Akiyama holding the m6 survival rifle?  Alright I can never pick so I'll just draw the next nonlewd waifu post after this.    Requesting Baron Ashura from Mazinger Z meeting Black Claw from Cutie Honey for the first time, both of them examining each other's strange appearance. http://imgur.com/a/Rb23o    Whoa now, let's not get ahead of ourselves.

I'm not talking about re-requesting obviously      A promise is a promise.    what if time is like a sphere and loops itself back?    Its good manners to wait til the next thread.

Err, why cant it be the same character?     requested high fiving   theyre holding hands  H-hitler-sama...  thanks man i love it!        There's no cooldown on your next request in the general.

HG on one side introducing himself with a "Hoooo!" at the end, implied hip thrusts and sparkles and bubbles in the background, while on the other side NS introducing himself with the usual explosion in the background.  References just for the hell of it:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=HoOqhxJnMIU#<wbr>t=76</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?featu<wbr>re=player_detailpage&amp;v=eI5UGAyYvss#<wbr>t=230</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  Shit quality for NS but that's all I could find on the tube.            [YouTube] Not Found    [YouTube] Not Found  Get your shit together, man.      I have a coloring question. What's the idea behind choosing the "dark" hair color? Adding black to the base color, or using color picker just doesn't cut it sometimes.  Is it something I just play around with?     Consider me officially jelly of Kirikafag    She's Chifusa     Okay, so monster girl delivery, Snake monster thing counts right? Also, more mature delivery, also also, bakemonogatari delivery.

Sure, but you could also learn a bit about color theory and how to pick colors. Or just copy the colors of your favorite illustrators and develop an intuition. Both are valid.      Requesting Ufo style Rin as a milf.     when you say color theory, you're talking about monochrome, complimentary, analogus, etc. as well as value, saturation, and tints?    If you really want to understand, I'd suggest reading through this at some point http://www.huevaluechroma.com/index<wbr>.php probably skimming past anything regarding paint mixing unless you plan on doing that.  Though if that's too much of a hassle, read this instead http://www.floobynooby.com/ICG/artv<wbr>alues.html no excuse there; read it through and through.  To give you the abridged version, adding black rarely cuts it. Making consistent shifts in tone in a certain lighting condition involves a change in the hue, value, and chroma/saturation, otherwise colors will look out of place and inconsistent. Adding black essentially just changes the value which, tends to kill the hue and saturation, leaving very washed out colors. Basic rule of thumb is that lighter tones will tend to yellow, whiter, and more saturated colors while darker colors will tend to blue, blacker, and more desaturated colors.  The trick to picking the right color is picking consistent colors that don't break how the saturation or hue is read in the picture while still establishing a coherent contrast between dark and light.  If you have sai, you can enable the HSV slider option on Windows tab which will tell you exactly each value for hue, value, and saturation.      </wbr>  </wbr>     S-shit, would just copy/paste my shit from the last thread. Thanks. Surprising though, the HG video was there for ages though for some reason most seem to have just been removed. Great fucking timing for this request I guess. In any case, managed to track one down here:  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DiK<wbr>uOSasa7Q&amp;feature=player_detailpage#<wbr>t=77</wbr></wbr>  [ ]  As for NS there really isn't much on the tube so I guess I'll have to pass on this thread and make a webm or something by the next one. Hell, might make webms of both and be done with it. Either way, thanks again for pointing it out.        Why didn't you nerds tell me designing your own - tan was so much fun? 4 hours just disappeared into a worm hole.  TIME OVER I need sleep, it's 1 am  I'll finish this tomorrow   in the meantime  Requesting Erika Kurumi from Heartcatch Precure taking chibi Chaika home!! If you want to include mini Fredericka, go ahead!   ADIOS          What system do you drawfags use for animu esc facial and head measurements? I've been trying the five eye line but it gives to realistic results.   It's something you have to discover yourself, the joy of drawing shit then looking up and it's hours since you started. That happened to me just now too, started drawing a tan succubus flying about in her pajamas and where did the time go?    damn looking good colorfag  mfw Kirikafag is getting lots of deliveries and lots of love   im so god damn happy for him      is this how you drawfags look like when you draw lewd animu pictures?   Less blushing more neutral expression, since I drew it I know all the flaws too well for that kind of expression.    More like this.      you will never watch a drewfag raw ledw pictures while his facial expression slowly changes and he gets wet down there       and he gets wet down there     What do you think we drawfags are, some kind of beast? That we'd fall prey to our basest desires, that we'd stifle moans as we trace over our third primary layer to get the curvature of the breasts just right, erection straining against our pants as we paint shading onto the juicy inner thigh?    so what you're saying is you want to fuck me, and you want it now?and afterwards you want to draw it all?   Requesting Chiri in proper M1930 IJA uniform.   Requesting Yayoi  sexually  struggling to draw.    But that's wrong, anon. You don't sexualize the Precures.     Yayoi should eventually end up stroking herself with the pencil and getting off with it.    It's written right here, nigga.    I can't draw for shit. I did colour it, but it ended up looking terrible.    Requesting Ryona getting her body smashed into a wall please, as in being pushed into it with a great amount of force. something like this:  http://uploads.dragonballencycloped<wbr>ia.com/0/00/Goku_Smashed_Into_Wall.<wbr>jpg</wbr></wbr>     Who's that artist second from the right on the top row?    http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=9762416</wbr>   bump  Requesting Haru dressed like Kanata   IT's fine looks pretty good as-is thanks asoc   My birthday is soon so I'm requesting Eila wearing a party hat   Damn this is really good, thanks drawfriend, the expression is cute and the tail looks really fluffy and huggable~ I wish there were more monstergirl  and lewd monstergirl  art of Natsuru, thanks again!    2 days    Do you have somewhere you post your stuff?    OR here.  That's a big sword.     Bump   Stop that fucking shit right now.    i assume you would want her dressed as alice like in the reference you provided    Does anyone here even want a pregnant waifu?    In a tasteful fashion, maybe    I'd actually like one.    Usually this.    I would, but I already have a lovely picture of her with a baby bump from pixiv so there's no need to request it.     2015   being autistic enough to treat your wifu like 3dpd gf replacement       2015   still having a 3dpd girlfriend      I don't, but I also don't think that wifu should be treated like one, it's just wrong and will lead you to nowhere.    I'd want to make her pregant, take responsibility, and raise our child together, if that's what you mean.   Requesting an anime version of "where do you think we are"   I don't know, I figure people can do whatever they want with their concept of waifu as long as it makes them happy.  I'm not delusional, I know she's an anime character, but more than that a psychological construct that fulfills certain emotional needs more efficiently than a 3D with her own emotional demands would. So in that sense, she is a replacement.  With the downside of not being very interactive, but what in life is perfect?  If I could have a wifubot made that spoke and acted and felt like a real being, I'd never look at 3D again. I'm selfish, I don't want the give-and-take of a relationship with another sapient being. Because in the end, what does that benefit you? Won't both I and my potential 3D wife be happier, more productive people if we have wifu/husbandobots and don't have to deal with each other's sometimes literal shit?  Is our love less real because its directed at objects that don't have the capacity to reject it? I say no.  Next 50 years are going to be fun, I'm glad I'm alive.             Pick a slut and draw her getting turned into a  sinless, pious nun    12 best girl     12   not 25      By tasteful, do you mean  your submissive, pregnant waifu in a collar and leash thanking you for getting her knocked up ? Or  your dominant, pregnant waifu grabbing you by your belt and peeking down to check if your junk is ready for another beating a few months from now ?      2 more days.   Can I pick  both ?   Requesting kagami greedily wringing her hands like the filthy jew she is    Mop   Best anything      Something around these lines   Every time I do a scan preview with my printer it crashes Windows Explorer.  Anyone else have this issue?     I haven't had a problem with Windows explorer since 2005.  Since that was when I last used it.       using microdick wangblows     IE is one thing, but you have to be a masochist retard to use Linux.    GNU+Linux*  OSX is the true master race.       I'm computer illiterate, so there can't possibly be anyone who finds using Linux easy     some versions of linux aren't actually that bad. things like ubuntu are pretty intuitive even for non techsavy people.  personally I think anyone who uses linux as a main OS is retarded anyways because its just more of a hassle than its worth for everyday use, but its not like all distros are gentoo      masochist retard to be using Linux  you know, he could just be using OSX      OSX is a certified unix distro though    I'd like to see these two done http://i.imgur.com/okXtfqC.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Zdixm0Y.jpg sorry if they're rough and all, even clean lines would be nice.      yeah but fuck Apple    Earn 500k+ per year like sakimichan.   requesting taba girl (does she even have a name?) in a summer dress and big straw hat http://imgur.com/c6rAMRH     Hopefully you see this when you wake up, Thanks for drawing Nero, Boa!    Unrelated but does anyone know when thumbnails got fucking axed on archive.moe? I remember people complaining when some were lost late in last year but now I can't see any past like a month ago, or any posts complaining about it in the archive, is it just temporary or does no one care anymore?  requesting waifus being forcefed foods they hate.   2 cute CD.    There was a problem with the long-term storage or something. According to  twitter  it should be back up relatively soon.      Mostly a neutral expression. But if it's especially weird it can be like this    One of you guys drew that? That's fuckin' incredible.    For FREE!    not really.    being away on a weekend  Feels horrible. After being on a long drawing streak, skipping a few weekends after the last one feels shitty.   Requesting Yukari smoking a cigarette   2 minute sketch     For those that aren't in the circle what does this even mean.    Draw a talking burrito, that whenever it talks spits out a nice amount of bean. Can be chasing moe girls around too. Thanks.    implying you have to be in the circle to understand  Boa's feeling a  constriction  in his chest.     is he dying?    He can't die. He has to draw my waifu    I was thinking it was either vulturing and he drew that cause he was like "I just can't win." or that he thought the reply was cute and was showing gratitude.  On reverse image search it shows no results. So I'm guessing this was an art trade?        seiba is Boa's waifu      I requested Nero in the weekend waifu drawthread, Boa drew me a Nero. I wanted to thank him by drawing Seiba. Was it a trade? Kind of. Was Boa guaranteed a thank-you-drawing? No.    seiba = saber  And the last horse crosses the finish line.      Someone said horse?    Go to bed Ycake.    It´s average at best, last thread's OP was way better for example.    Ill take this one, if no one minds.    Don't rank the free art.   Requesting Mami going window shopping with Nagisa   I'd take that she'll raw.   Requesting Teto with her top opened in a cumshot picture on her face + chest or into her womb, smiling and double peace no ahegao.   *shell   Requesting lewds of these two please   This has nothing to do with them being free deliveries or not here.   I want a picture of Cobra (from Space Adventure Cobra) and Dandy (from Space Dandy) hanging out together.   Sweet refs, brah.    I'm in a circle?    holy shit seconded    Already posted.<br/>    More of an ouroboros.     navel licking  No, fuck off.     Haven't seen the anime, so excuse me for not knowing how the design on the collar works. I'm too lazy to check for a reference. Hope it's alright!    Don't play coy. I know you drew for one of the early mass deliveries. I don't think you drew for the big one tho.    My oh My, that sure is wonderful. How do you draw that quickly and with that level of skill?    I don't care for navel play but i would like them to have more ab definition    How exactly do you dock and lick the navel at the same time? Is it like a 69?    Sai does most of it for me.    Oh hey you use sai too?  How do you deal with the lack of vertical and horizontal guides?  Do you just say fuck it?      I wouldn't mind that as well.  Basically.      Yea, I just kind of go for it. Objects end up getting oddly displaced in space but that's what the transform tool is for right &gt;&lt;?     Vertical and horizontal guides   Are you an artist or a draftsman?  If you desperately need guidelines, use the selection box tool.  Not him tho   Really striking, by the way.             I really need to learn how to use sai better.    I just don't like it when I try to draw strict vertical and horizontal lines and it ends up being wonky and stuff looks like it's leaning over or crooked.   Artist. So use the selection box and fill it and use it as guide?       Oh, I tend to not have that problem since a lot of my digital stuff is heavily gesture. I just kind of flick my hand around. When I do need straight lines though usually ill rotate the canvas since its easier to make diagonal motion on the tablet as opposed to a straight line.    I hope you stick around for the weekend. The way you render hair and eyes makes my heart go doki doki.    I hope he doesn't. The weekend doesn't deserve this    Which one?    love the hair but the eyes feel a bit off to me.     criticizing free art     Stop.     thinking critiques are a bad thing  just leave. I know this isn't /ic/, but as a drawfag here I wish people would critique my art more often.      So what about these who are still rocking  XP    Requesting these sluts getting pounded.   This is probably the only reason I will try posting here.  If you want to have no meaningful critique might as well head on over to DA.     It's probably because I didn't add enough hard black and used too thick of a density on the little chicken scratches. I'm actually going over it now that you mentioned it lol.    I apologize, I did not realize that the drawfags were open to critiques on their work after all the effort they put into them. I hope you do not misunderstand.      As a drawfag "The eyes feel a bit off" would annoy me, because if I could see what the hell you're talking about, I wouldn't have drawn it that way. Criticism should be specific.   Even a lot of professional art will "feel off" to certain people. Look in any thread about a certain artist and you'll see tons of people talking about how they hate his eyes or hips or whatever. If you can't suggest a way to improve it, and we can't see anything wrong with it, we have to assume you just don't like the style.  Sometimes someone will say "this part looks bad" and you immediately notice something wrong and can fix it. But not often, unless you're a beginner drawfag.          Fuck off lolyfag.    Well now I seem like a crazy person since I can't find the images in the booru but didn't you partake in a Hestia crossover mass delivery recently? I also remember you were a part of the original Oora mass delivery.    It's perfect you amazing son of a bitch    Who the fuck is that    well that's not it exactly, the eyes themselves don't look bad, they just seem a bit awkward on the face. I mean sorry about not being able to give a better critique but I'm not sure if its because its going toward the uncanny valley or if they just seem placed a little off, its just not sitting right with me.  sorry, its one of those things I'd love to perfectly outline for him, but I can't really place my finger on it. and since it seems he's better than me it's probably easier for him to pin it down than me.       I would agree with that.  A lot actually. Even if you do know something looks off you often can't fix it if it's too vague. Like the face looking wrong. You can tell it's off but not why. Like maybe the eyes are too far apart, or the nose is too big or the mouth is too low. And then vague comments like "the face looks wrong" are no help.   But I was specifically talking to the guy who was hating on critique itself, not that particular critique.       Counter requesting them hammering nails into roof shingles. or pounding pizza dough, or one of them playing the carnival game where they try to ring the bell by by hitting the lever with a mallet.    The only Hestia I've drawn was this one and it had nothing to do with /a/. I don't recall drawing Oora as part of a mass delivery either.   Requesting Kyoko   I would say it has to do with the pupils being rings with a dot in them. It's an interesting style but it throws me off.    Well, I guess I'm crazy. Sorry about that.    Maybe you're thinking of that one time where the other drawfags were watching his stream and delivered along with him. He wasn't an active part of that mass delivery tho.    Its not Friday yet.  This is probably it.      Boa can you draw     what happens friday?     Boa drew Hestia  The end times are upon us!     Is fridays for requests? Do people just post whatever other days?    I tweaked them a bit, gave harder dark colors and it looks nicer. The rings i tried removing and it does look more natural but I'm just a sucker for the little white circles. Adds, I don't know, a surreal intensity? Just a personal quirk though.    weekeend waifu draw threads where people can request their waifu     Summer is real  Friday-Sunday is the Weekend Waifu Festival, where everyone gets 2-minute sketches of their favorite cartoon characters.       Playing whack-a-mole with little Kurosakis instead of moles.    I actually like the little white circles as well. If I absolutely had to give some reason why they look off I suppose it'd be more that her left eye seems flatter than her other eye. the the fold above the eye is angled a bit strange.      Like I said, I find them odd, it's not a definite thing one way or the other. If you like them no reason not to keep them.    Happy birthday! Sorry it's just a sketch    So what is the rest of the week?  I have not been in drawfag threads much but it looks like just people giving and sometimes taking requests.     Nice, that would be fun to see too.    Okay serious answer:  This is the main drawthread, which continues for 7 days a week, and where you can request anything anime-related to be drawn.  Starting Friday morning and continuing until the last Sunday thread dies is the Weekend Waifu drawthread, which is separate from this one and is specifically about getting your (one and only one) waifu or husbando drawn how you want.  Recently the WWD has been significantly more popular among artists than the main threads, so it's looked forward to quite a bit.  You can request a waifu in either thread, but requesting him/her in both is heavily frowned upon.            You can request a waifu in either thread, but requesting him/her in both is heavily frowned upon.  I'm glad people were quick to tell me that the first time I came to these threads without getting told off. Some people aren't so lucky.      is it really that hard just to lurk more? I mean its not like this is rocket science or anything, its literally called the weekend waifu drawthread, whats hard about that to figure out?     It's not that easy to figure out some rules. E.g. when I started out there was someone else requesting my waifu and I requested her in a subsequent thread in which he didn't post, only for people to attack me because it wasn't obvious that the same character cannot be requested after getting a delivery.    It's okay, I know there's some confusion around and I'm almost sure there's a guy out there that has partially assimilated my style   Maybe  I have a lot on my plate at the moment        What do you think of her?  Annoying and unlikable in her own route. Plays the role of a helpless damsel throughout most of it only to turn into the main villain by the end, yet we're supposed to like and want to save her regardless.  The most I'd do is a peck of the cheek if she grabs me I'm making a run for it though    Worms slut.    Sexiest Fate girl.  Best waifu as well.    complete doormat  PMS the character  Managed to drag down everything good in HF with her shittiness.   Best girl.   Illya is close second though.        Is she really full of worms or its just figurative? I saw F / Z, but compared to her Uncle, she appears to be quite healthy     She is literally full of worms.     She needs to calm the fuck down.     She is just misunderstood. I bet every anon in here would date a 3DPD that would resemble Sakura in looks and personality and you faggots can't deny it.     I bet every anon in here would date a 3DPD     It's just a meme, she has only one worm left in her  heart.     Fuck haters, she is pretty nice. And her Servant is the best girl.     A shit. A big stinky shit.  Seiba is the best girl. Fate is the best route.      Sakura made one mistake, and that was underestimate Shirou's resolve to save her by going back to her house, when she killed Shinji. Even at the end (ruru bureika), she believed Shirou was going to kill her, but fuck that, he said he was going to save her and he did it.    Urobutcher please.     tfw no information on HF in TMAce    "The magazine will give more details on the upcoming mobile app game Fate/Grand Order, bundle with a Fate Cross Over Drama CD, an illustration by Wada Aruko (Fate/Extra, Fate/Extra CCC), and a Blue Saber rubber strap."        Fate is the best route.      seiba best girl   fate best route      reading the VN   pretty goo till now   never understood the "bone of my sword" and "body of swords" thing   reading HF yesterday   almost done it seems   they show Shirou's body   Holy fuck I thought this was only some sort of exaggeration or something else. I'm at work right now, I stopped reading yesterday after using fucking Rule Breaker on Sakura. Fucking Rule Breaker man, how did fucking Shirou figure that out.          I HATE IT.    Best girl in every route.     stopping right in the middle of final climax   literally 1/2 (goat) scenes away from ending  For what purpose.     Worst girl with the worst servant literal the shitest combination there is     Worst girl with best girl  Ftfy.     I have no idea how you have managed to go this long without being spoiled, but you should probably finish the VN before coming back to this thread.    Only good heroine tbh.    Best fighter in Fate/Unlimited Codes    It was 2am bro. I had work.   Okay, will avoid /a/ until I finish it.        waifu   you must like getting cucked by cartoon characters, kill yourself m8.       cucked   Implying a girl that waited for her loved one until the day she died of old age would ever cuck you  Senpai pls      It's a meme. In the end she only has one worm left in her and it's not where you think it is.   Of course, I wouldn't be surprised if the people who only started using this term recently don't even know that.       annoying in F/uc   annoying in CFF       fate best route   Are we supposed to take you seriously?     I've grown to like her. Not my favorite TM girl, but I don't think she deserves the hate she gets.  Ufotable managed to make her look the best out of the three heroines.   This I do agree with.     She always looked the best though.     Dat everything 10/10     I wonder if Sakura would look better if she kept her old black hair/blue eyes combo.   We could have had all this moe but shit happened  YAY Penis shaped worms everywhere!   Who is that?    LOL     not recognizing wakame     Here's your wormslut 2x.    Here's your Carenslut 2x.     It's not really a spoiler is to tell him that Shirou figured out to use it because of his weapon based ability to read NPs.  Mainly because he tells you in every route it's a dagger that cancels contracts, and wouldn't you know it, Ilya tells him the night before Sakura is possessed through a contract.         literally has sex for the purpose of procreation       Too bad her father will always be best girl.       did you forget your uniform's pants?      Would Kirei give a shit that anyone's lusting over his daughter?    Caren is an angel that has no regard to her personal health. The reason men lust is because of their inner evil who she seeks to cure.    Why would he?  If someone is lusting over your daughteru it just means your genes produced a high level human.      Wise words anon.    that looks so fucken retarded with no pants     Kirei giving a shit about anything that doesn't involve people suffering    Smug Sakura is best Sakura.   FHA Sakura is the miracle of the universe. It's what made me like her.    I want to hear Sakura's OH HO HO HO.    Carnival Phantasm Sakura is better.    The Matou household was the best part of that.    Which boards would Shinji browse /a/?    Best stalker.    People don't actually read the VN  Besides, ubw is the only route that people properly spoil      /sp/, /v/ and /pol/.    She was by far the best part of the date episode.      Literally fucked All the World's Evils      He'd be making bait threads on /v/ to get lots of (you)s, I bet    People base their opinions in what primaries write here, they won't read the original source.    Didn't she take over the Matou household in CP?    I have this huge urge to protect Caren.    She fucked Sakura's baby, the pedo.     Zouken accepting his fate and going with it    It's pretty clear most people who post in Fate threads haven't read the VN which is why I find it hilarious whenever they try to discuss something they have only partial knowledge about.       She did in HA so probably    Caren purifies those who lust<br/>    He'd make trash talk threads about Rin every day.     he's the luviaposter     So all those posts about Rin's face is Shinji samefagging?    Indeed     Sakurafags     No, Tohsaka Rhino is a common sentiment.    Avenger and Caren were great in HA     6666     I don't blame her, I'd fuck Avenger too.    Avenger &gt; Shirou     no Avenger/Bazett intimate bonding     Pay attention to when he first meets Caster in HF. Something similar happens in Fate's route.  The only time Rule Breaker works is when  Caster keeps it hidden in UBW's route. In the others, where she shows it, he can somehow know what it does, so there is precedence.    Seriously, just finish the VN        she is best girl.   Who would top?    Even Beast's Lair is full of Zero secondaries. In the UBW thread, they always ask basic stuff related to Fate, letting everybody know that they haven't read stay night for shit, but only watched Zero and read the wiki. Now they're discussing if that black haired guy in Rider's RM was Waver or not, when it was confirmed years ago that he wasn't. I like all related to Fate, but the Zero anime was a mistake.    Answering people's basic questions is better than discussing Shirou's ideals for the millionth time.     cliche eroge    asking this question    I really wonder.       Better than regular Sakura.      I mean, it's ok to me if anime only fans discuss topics they have full knowledge of, but what I do find annoying is when some smartass who hasn't read any of the source material is 100% convinced he's right despite the fact that the VNs and side material prove him completely wrong.   I get that not everyone has read everything TM related (not even possible if you don't know moon), but at least don't be stubborn when someone that has tells you you're wrong.         BL   Never registered, but I lurked semi consistently for years. Last time I checked it was overrun with new members, at least the UBW anime thread. Somehow made me lose interest. So it's the same now?      I like her.   She's been getting some good art since the HF movie/s got announced.   Yeah, it is. Also, the more japanese you know, the longer your dick is apparently. There's also this insufferable Zero secondary, Christemo.  At the end of the day, there's only /a/ to have serious discussions about TM stuff. The shitposting is too much sometimes, but you guys know your shit very well.       we will never get femdominant H scenes in Tsukihime or anything Fate related   Life's cruel.       femdominant   The closest we got to that was the F/HA threesome but that didn't end on that note, that's for sure.     It never does. Most femdom doujins end with the guy taking over.     the more japanese you know, the longer your dick is apparently   Probably because the deeper you go into TM discussions the more you need shit that wasn't "officially" translated so moonreaders are treasured like an endangered species.     you guys know your shit very well.  Hmm, somewhat debatable. Funny enough, sometimes it feels like I can recognize certain BL members in /a/ threads by their posting styles. It's trippy as fuck.         Best than Saber, worst than Rin. Her route was the best route though even if the 50% of it is absolutely shit.   I used to go to Beast's Lair for all the translations. For a long time it was a very homogenized community where most people had a similar level of knowledge about Type Moon shit so I can understand why they'd be annoyed by the change.    HF is a mix of shit and gold. The best parts are my favorite out of the entire VN but that goddawful pacing kind of shits on it.      Her route was the best route  And she tried so hard to ruin it     Mai waifu    Christemo  I hate that fucking guy but he's no a secondary      Why is this dude particularly annoying?      implying retarded non-humans count     Really? I was bored one day and I started watching recommended videos on youtube, then reading some comments I saw this guy posting and he had a visibly boner for Zero's Rider.   He's a complete ass.       Tell that to Sakura :^)    Hard to describe. You'd have to lurk BL for a while.  The 2 weeks he was banned were perfect        Sakura's face  I want this voiced, now.     Kohaku's dream H-scene has her dominating Shiki and fingering his ass.     this is supposed to be significantly big   Takeuchi really can't into breasts.      He has a Gil,Karna and Ozymandias boner.    but he can into very long, disproportionate arms.    I'd post that pic of her comparing herself to Krillin, but I don't have it at the moment.    That's from 2005 by the way. This is from 2015.  Now compare this Sakura to the VN Sakura. 2015 Sakura's boobs are huge and I love that.       Dark Sakura  Sexy as fuck.     He's a slenderfag. Compare Rin's body most of the time to the way she looks in ufo's anime. She's a stick but I'd say she was intended to be that way since her measurements fit that. Ufo's the one who exaggerated her curves.    He started making everyone's tits bigger with time. Take Saber for example. The change isn't as noticeable but it's there.   Has Takeuchi accepted the ways of the breast men with age?      Fate remake with this bbygurl when    I love Takeuchi's design, and what ufo does isn't Takeuchi's. Fate/Grand Order is more Takeuchi like, that Archer in the CM actually looks like Archer.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bZa<wbr>buND1LjU</wbr>  [ ]      This  Compare this Rin to Ufotable Rin.      That Sakura, mmm.    Takeuchi got better with proportions with time but even now he draws them pretty slender.     She's a stick but I'd say she was intended to be that way since her measurements fit that  Not realy. Both describtion and sprites/CGs of Rin say otherwise. They just can't into numbers       I was talking more about hips and thighs.    Woah, what's that gooey white stuff?    well at that you're right. Takeuchi legs and arms as sticks which doesn't fit with the description considering that Rin is extremly trained      Eh, it's like the one time she shows off ever, give her a break.  Considering she behaves so humbly 90% of the time, she should strut her stuff.  The funny thing is that she still seems to be growing, as it's implied she got even larger six months after the war. If she was flatter than Saber a year before the war, and is growing even further afterwards, she should be quite the chesty champ in her 20's the rate she is going.         Sakura's ass and hips are supposed to be bigger than Rin's but that's not the idea you'd get from just looking at them. Nasu tells Takeuchi one thing and he draws another. In the end it really doesn't matter considering now they're just going it whatever looks the most attractive    I prefer the 2.0 model.    Not that guy but the way Rin's drawn even in the anime doesn't show her to be "trained". It looks more like she's naturally well endowed rather than toned (in the ass and legs area). Basically, they're not really caring much about the details. Can't really expect them to, though.     She would be an altogether different prototype, since Zouken has used his family for experiments for decades. Anyone who took on his work (foolish as they are), would be something different. Parasites based on familiars are a whole different branch of research.      You will never bury your face in Liz's chest    I like the fun size version better.    What's funny is that they made Rin flatter in the anime, but her ass, thighs and hips all got a boost.      Sakura's ass is supposed to be second only to Ciel iirc. With child bearing hips.  Also, she was able to wrestle down Taiga, so the constant archery training should give her more upper arm strength and tone.       The only thing that makes me suffer is Rin's fucked up eyes.     Ufo can't into consistency, look at the shot where Kirei puts his hand between her breasts, they look big.     Didn't Nasu say Rin was the "ass" heroine and Sakura the "tits" one?   Nothing makes sense anymore.      I think that was fanservice, not necessarily inconsistency. They draw over CG models, so it should be consistent for the most part unless they really, really fuck up.     Then what's Saber the heroine of? Moe?    May as well   Worst girl and a wormslut   It's the same consistency you see in eroge. Every girl gets bigger tits and ass in their H scene. Like this anon said , it's fanservice.   Where can i download F/HA? It tried erogedownload.com, but after i assembled all parts into 1 (like i did with fate stay night) i cant play it  Is there any easier way to download it (englisch ttranslated of course)     Download iso, install, apply patch.     He probably thought it was unfair not to give a title to Rin, but he says Sakura has a dynamite body constantly.   Don't know why he didn't just call her Queen of Twintails, or Queen of Zettai Ryouiki. That way he could call Sakura the Queen of Curves and it's all good.       Food   Sakura and Rider have the best porn.    What's funny is that they made Rin flatter in the anime  Not realy. It's just perspective and ufotable not being the most consistent      It's far more likely that he forgot the numbers he pulled out of his ass ages ago.     What's funny is that they made Rin flatter in the anime  I think it's the other way around      I'd post the bathroom scene now but I can't find it. Consistency is probably to blame.     I love her.    The bathroom scene is a matter of perspective.   Regardless of which girl you like the best, who would you say is most compatible with Shirou?   I have an idea of the one most compatible with Assassin.    Rin. Sakura he has to change the entirety of who he is to work with. He has nice compatability with Saber actually, but it never seems like anything more than him just admiring how perfect she is. With Rin he has actual back-and-forth chemistry.    Compatible? Saber. They are both way too obsessed with their ideals. Best for him? Probably Sakura.     cute girl just thinks assassin is some kind of overgrown chuuni but she likes it like that    Saegusa a best, isn't she?    Get the iso from nyaa and the patch from Beast's Lair        Rin, he needs a lady to be a butler to.    your body will never be made of swords  Why live?    Shitty peado bait character. Rin is best girl, followed by Seibah.       peado bait character   literally what       responding to bait  Literally retard      you will never be as /fit/ as Shirou   you will never have an edgy chant to release your powers   you will never date genderbent King Arthur   you will never have a cute white-haired girl following you around   &gt;you will never have a bro like Lancer   Reading Fate just hurts, doesn't it?            Kirei will never beat the shit out of you         Anyone who took on his work (foolish as they are)  How so? Their only major hiccup was an unforeseeable turn of events that resulted from their being too successful.      gil will never call you a mongrel      your future self will never come back to the past and try to kill you for being a dense motherfucker      Shinji will never act tsun over you      your cooking will never be as good as Shirou's      you will never be a natural ginger      Avenger talks about raping her the entire game   doesn't      Avanger loves Caren.    Bazett is fucking ugly and too old.    Avenger knows who the best girl is    How can you live with such shit taste?    Kill yourself    Kohaku a best    Saber definitely. Those two are literally made for each other.    This.     Sakura is the only one with her own key to his house and open access, plus they just work together in the kitchen like wizards. Did you not see how they naturally just shoot the shit on cooking in Hollow? They act like they are a married couple running an inn of wayward residents.      Yes, and in both Zouken's case and theirs, it's because the material was special, not their handiwork.     I do not think of her. Nice route tho    What? I get why you'd say that about Sakura, but in Tsubaki's case I can't recall any mention of her being exceptional in any way other than because of what her parents had done to her.     Because with such heinous experiments, the subject would die immediately if they couldn't handle it. Especially if they are copying someone as reckless as Zouken, who was also copying the Einzberns.     Not that anon but please she is already kicking him out of the kitchen in heaven's feel true end.    Don't care, not Rider.    Yes!    I'm gonna marry that girl    Good taste Saberfriend.    oh senpai, did I turn you on?    slutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslu<wbr>tslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutsl<wbr>utslutslutslutslutslutslutslutsluts<wbr>lutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslut<wbr>slutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslu<wbr>tslutslutslutslutslutslutslutslutsl<wbr>utslutslutslutslutslut</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>    But Shirou only ever gets to truly understand how bro Lancer is in UBW.   Shirou will never summon Cu and train in the art of the runic muscle wizard   Cu will never get to poke fun at Rin's tsun when she agrees to cooperate and mess with their relationship by tricking Shirou to go out with him to pick up chicks  Goddammit, F/SN needed an option to choose your Servant.       Why in ubw route, she isn't a master    Fake assassin all the way. If I have to load the temple gate onto a truck I'll do it. That nigger has style.      She actually is.   She could've switched places with her sister   she's sweet, even though he was two timing her she never said a word and patiently waited for her turn.    That smile and unnerving patience is what makes her dangerous     Heaven's Feel could have been an Ilya route   Instead we get Wormslut      Please, don't take your lolicon blueballs out on Sakura, she's a good girl.  If anyone should've stepped aside for the Ilya route, it's Saber. He already spends half that route hanging out with Ilya      And the most beautiful part is that the Illya route could've been about love, but not as a couple... but as siblings.  Damn, fuck HF.      No competition.     Implying Sakura's role in HF is more or less a plot device     Illya is literally nothing more than a plot device and I don't see anybody hating her for that. Maybe we should start doing that too from here on.    good    A plot device to develop other characters? But she's arguably one of the most developed ones, compare the amount of shifting to her point of view in HF to the treatment Rin and especially Saber get in their routes. She has an insane amount of intermissions narrating what's going on inside her mind.    HOLY FUCK MY DICK IS MADE OF BLADES    Sakura's story is over, Ilya's story of pure love between siblings will be retold for generations     Illya is literally nothing more than a plot device  How dare you say something like that to Student No.1   Develop  She made Shirou abandon his ideology for her, she made Saber her slave, I say that the development was only to make others gravitate around her.       How big is "big poster"?     I know I definitely enjoyed the dialog between Shirou and Rin the most.     How is Shirou supposed to raise a kid in a situation where he decides to be a superhero and save everyone. You'd think it would be kind of cool to say your dad is a superhero, but in reality it'd be something ore along the lines of.  my dad is never home   my dad might die at anytime   am I not more important to him than those other people he's trying to save   I can't call him sometimes when he's away   everyone else's dad shows up to the track meet, but mine   missing all of his kid's important milestones   getting a call about his death sometime in the future   Having a kid would be a bad idea.             fate best route     Sakura.    Japanese dads are kind of different from what I understand. You're supposed to respect that they're away at work trying to do stuff.  I mean Kerry wasn't there for Shirou as much as people would like to think. He made multiple trips abroad to take care of business and try and rescue Ilya, but Shirou still was in awe over the guy.      Shirou will eventually outgrow the ideal, probably take a homely career or be a stay at home dad with Tohsaka being the man in the relationship and making the money.    So basically the same deal Shirou got with Kerry until the Grail AIDS got him What could go wrong?     THAT ISN'T FUN AT ALL, TOHSAKA!     &gt;everyone else's dad shows up to the track meet, but mine  That one makes me feel bad      outgrow the ideal  good joke      just stop crying and go fuck Sakura, Shirou     Why thank you. Saved.   Oh you have no idea.        Sakura     Yes, Sakura, Archer told him too, probably regrets not fucking her when he had the chance.    Kiritsugu isn't exactly the name I'd associate with a good father figure, and Shirou was still in awe because the guy saved home form death and he had seigi no mikata on the brain    What could go wrong?  Shirou is planning to create another broken JusticeBot child        That's basically what she said in the scene, more or less     Kiritsugu isn't exactly the name I'd associate with a good father figure   He literally raised someone who managed to beat the shit out of a demi-god. He did something right.         Shirou will eventually outgrow the ideal      Shirou will eventually outgrow the ideal, probably take a homely career or be a stay at home dad     I think this makes it clear that Shirou is only fit to father Sakura's children      He will eventually reach the ideals he had in HF and you know it.      If you think that, you kind of missed the point. I mean this shit should be fresh in your head, they laid it out for you right at the beginning of the last episode of UBW.     eventually outgrow the ideal  This isn't HF     Why would he do that?    What, that there isn't anything wrong with it? I got that point, but one day he will outgrow it as it is a childish ideal. He just grew up faster in HF.     He literally reflected on how Archer spent his entire life following it, and if Archer could, he could as well.   Is there any shonen out there that isn't complete shit?   yes    yes    [HorribleSubs] Kyoukai no Rinne - 12 [720p].mkv   All 20-25 followers, ARISE!     Do I need to watch Rinne no Lagrange before this?   I'm sleepy though.  So will this show turn into a romantic comedy from now on?   You're giving this show too much credit.  There are 5-6 followers at most.      no, idiot, the prequel is kyoukai no kanata   I liked the episode, it was nice and Rinne's father keeps on being a cunt.   It's Kara no Kyoukai, dumbo.   Oh SHIT  Wobble wobble   time for the AOTS   Did best girl appeared yet?   it's inuyasha bozo   Well there you go, she said it herself, Rinne confirmed slut.   She's much less sexy than I thought she would be. Cute though.  I wonder if this reference was a joke about misunderstandings.      She's pretty great.    This isn't what it looks like, I can explain. And then he explains.  Why is that so rare?     What a slut.   To be fair, it didn't even work anyway.    Because other heroines would have hit him way before he explained. Sakura is just unfazed by everything.     God DAMN you, Sabato!     Papa da yo~     In another world, Sabato is the main character of a corruption doujin series.     Staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa<wbr>re</wbr>     In the other world, he IS the corruption doujin.    that disgusting bastard   I think I'll just wait for FFF    50% upgrade  Ageha confirmed for wearing fujogoggles about Rinne.      there are people actually waiting for FFF out there right now     16 so far!     FFF confirmed for Damashigami front to put people on the Rinne no Wa before their time    Still the AOTS.   I think Souma's still my AOTS, but Rinne's my super comfy anime.    She's the Shampoo, isn't she?     even has his pinkie finger raised   Genma Saotome could take asshole lessons from this guy.      BEST GIRL INCOMING   I remember someone saying they didn't see these hands often anymore.   I guess they don't see enough anime because Nips still love it.     Ageha a cute!  Mamiya Sakura, I'm going to give you sexual pleasure.   To be honest, outside of Takahashi stuff and Ruroni Kenshin, I haven't seen those hands used very often in quite some time. Must not be watching the right series for it, I suppose.    Okay.    Staaaaaaaaare~    Mamiya-san, don't just willingly do everything he says!   I expected new girl to be awful, I didn't expect her to steal my heart    the comfiest anime of the season  Mamiya Sakura is such  soulless  gal.   But will it stay comfy through the trials of jealousy, infatuations, and relationship sabotages?      prepare for sakura to get cucked the fuck out  best girl even takes rokudo to a love hotel      I can think of one person who'd love to catch her on the rebound.       I like Ageha, or Renge, or maybe even Rika more than Sakura.  Is Mamiya Sakura emotionally stunted?    Renge   Rika   We'll be lucky if either make an appearance in the anime. Better prepare yourself.       The jury's still out on whether she's emotionally stunted or just not outwardly expressive.    Rika is Sakura's friend. The one who got cheat pencil last episode.     Yeah, I realized I fucked that up shortly after posting. I meant "Ayame", the one who wants into Jumonji's pants.   This episode was great, and Ageha was a cutie   exactly 21 posters   the gang's all here     Where else would we be?    Getting fooled by Damashigami's.   Why are so few people watching one of the best shows this season?   They think it's Inuyasha 2.0     no fanservice   no flashy mecha   no bullshit magic   no ship-able pandering   This series is like the anti-anime of 2015, it has nothing to entice the current generation of viewers to it. I'd be surprised if of the 20-odd people in this thread, more than 2 weren't Takahashi nostalgiafags that came up with UY, Ranma, Maison, Mermaid Scar, felt let down by Inuyasha, and have flocked to this because we need the fix.         I miss you faggot.    I don't mind the lack of attention, it keeps these threads comfy.     I'd be surprised if of the 20-odd people in this thread, more than 2 weren't Takahashi nostalgiafags that came up with UY, Ranma, Maison, Mermaid Scar, felt let down by Inuyasha, and have flocked to this because we need the fix.  Oooh, you hit the nail on the head exactly.  I liked seeing the ED change.       I'm going to miss this ED once they do the changeover.     mfw  Lack of anons make a good thread.     Don't bring that cancerous shit into a Rinne thread! It attracts flies.   do I have to watch kyoukai no kanata to understand this anime?   Absolutely not. In fact, KnK might render you so retarded you won't be able to understand this anime.    But everything you just listed is actually a good thing.    Good to have or good that it's not there?    That was uncalled for anon    No, we're talking about Shakugan no Shana, you dolt.    Hey I fucking love Inuyasha. I swear how can anyone hate this fucking colour palatte I just can't even      Does Arslan also count too, if we set the fantasy setting aside?    Arslan is bullshit magic and fanservice.     thinks Arslan is immune   Have you even seen the Arslan threads here? The pandering alone makes it unqualified to be on the (very) short list of non-modern viewer anime. There are people in them that will argue over which one tops in Narsus and Daryun's "relationship".      Good that it's not there, obviously.   Why is this anime so comfy?    I got all the time in the world.     Until you suddenly die. Don't risk it.    Getting a new Takahashi series after all these years is like going to visit your mom after a year of shitty bachelor food and takeout for a home cooked Thanksgiving dinner. It's a little smaller and more understated than the massive bring-all-the-extended-family-from-<wbr>both-sides shindigs there used to be when you were a kid, but it's still perfect.</wbr>    Kagome rustled my jimmies something fierce, and my only exposure to it was the dub at the time. Is it worth watching subbed?    I'll be free of my backlog though.    Their translator for Rinne literally went missing in real life. Just watch HS     having a backlog      translated by Ryoga Hibiki      Not having a backlog    I spotted 30 followers right now.    being new to anime      not wasting your highschool/college life watching anime        friends     we 31 now    H-hey they finally did episode 4 of Yahari. It's worth the wait, you will see.   The face of autism.   I love her (lack of) reactions  A pen is glowing dark   I wonder if it's something bad   let's not do anything at all        autism speaks: it's time to staaaaaare    We Maison Ikkoku now.   That new Shinigami is fucking cute.   autism at it's finest ( and in a good way )    I like her more.    Are you even into anime?    I've been watching it and somehow it never even occurred to me to check for threads. I think I was in such a state of placid contentment I didn't need anything else.     no bullshit magic   Instead we have bullshit EXPENSIVE magic.      Ageha: I don't if he's the leader or not, I'll beat the crap out of anyone related to that guy! The crap!   Rinne: (But I need my crap...)    Rokumon's whispered "Oh, damn" when Sakura catches Rinne and Ageha holding hands   Rokumon's flashback to above    That stare battle   This show, man.           It's actually extremely cheap. Unless you are Rinne.    Most of them are one time uses and he needs a lot of them. That starts to add up, y'know.    But he started needing much less after he got the scythe to beat the crap out of evil spirits, and you get paid for doing this so it pays off.   fff when   TBH, even after getting the scythe he still needs a lot for nonviolent spirits.    Never.    Doesn't help that his father is always taking his money.     no fanservice   no flashy mecha   no bullshit magic   no ship-able pandering   I love this.        Rinne's father is Ataru. The rival bishounen is Mendou. Sakura is like no one ever, but a bit like Tendou Kasumi. Akane's biggest sister from Ranma.   Nah, Rinne's father is Genma if he were more antagonistic and had Ranma's voice.  The "Mendou" of the series seems to be split between at least four different characters.  And Sakura is too autismal to be Kasumi.        I thought we were already factoring that in.     playing mahjong on fucking xbox in japan  Just, wow.    She would be cute without the whore makeup.   But she is a whore.    Who is Rinne then?   Downloading now   Don't count me out yet, I'm just late.      Her memory is REALLY off.     Shouma and Kurosu  doujins when.    When Kurosu decides to work unpaid overtime.   I got some hot videos for everyone.   I've been here since the beginning.  Don't forget me, too. ;_;      .mov  What year is this set in?    This fucking episode, I can't stop laughing. The girls in this show are so good.   At least it's not .rmvb.    Ohio, 43-san  I regret falling so behind on this. It's one of my favourites this season, and is just so all-around well done.      The ED is one of the best this season.     there are people here who don't watch it with French subs one week in advance     I'm not a dumb frogposter, though. ;_;    Sabato is pleased.    That's exactly how I feel about the OP. That shit has dominated and mindbroken my slutty earpussy.  ED is cute too.       Sakura's unreactions are priceless.     The hivemind is in good shape.    I love me some Jumonji. Surely he'll wake up Mamiya Sakura's heart one day!  Right!?      Mamiya Sakura's heart  What's that?     Oh no.    We're getting a new OP and ED in two weeks aren't we?    I hope they aren't worse.   This show reminds me of why I started watching anime. It's just so uplifting.  I'm surprised how little fanservice is in this show given the author's other works.  I'd fug the grandma.   Why Mamiya Sakura so great?   She got bored of fanservice halfway Inuyasha.    It's because she gives no fucks.    She just is.   <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435176855112.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1435176855112<wbr>.webm</wbr></a>   I think I could do with a bit more of the raunchy humor  aside from that time in the manga everyone mistakenly thought Rokudou built a Sakura sex doll.     Something you don't want to fuck with.    Such tension.      there are people itt who like the garbage Ranma but dislike Rumiko's greatest work, Inuyasha  I want tumblr to leave.    The threads going at a decent pace, no need to try and spice it up with bait.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127128904   MUH GENDER EUPHORIA  If you are going to bait, at least get the names for the illnesses correctly.     Both Inuyasha and Ranma are garbage but I love Rinne Come at me faggot    You like lolis now!?   Don't respond anon, just report so that his post may reach the Rinne no Wa and find peace.    Why not both?      If only Sakura didn't have such awful taste.      tfw you will never fuck Sakura as she lies lifelessly staring up at you     I don't know, but it's a bit refreshing that she's not an Akane or a Kagome 2.0.     She's the weirdest female main character I've seen. She's not even dense, it's like the intensity of her emotions was always in a minimum.     She is a little bit dense, especially for asking herself why Rokudou holding hands with Ageha bothered her.     &gt;no fanservice   &gt;no flashy mecha   &gt;no bullshit magic   &gt;no ship-able pandering    Well, considering Takahashi is one of the mangaka that set almost all of those cliches decades ago, it's ok she's does not seem to pander to anyone in particular nowadays.  Same with Mitsuru Adachi and Kazuhiko Shimamoto.            Wait, did Takahashi ever do any mecha?        Not mecha, but UY had tons of sci-fi references.     Damashi-Camera   BASED A S E D          Why there are two Ryogas?    What the hell is with the bear in a cup?    I wonder if he got a good view of her panties.    Because one's Ryoga, and the other is just some lost guy.    I believe the bear is a teabag.    You discriminating against cupbears, Mr. 1234?    Good enough for /m/e.    Maybe they're brears.    They could very well be brears.   I just don't understand why this got so much hate on /a/ before it aired. People saying the manga was the shittest thing Rumiko ever made. Bullshit. In fact, this series is easily in her top 3. I think more people are seeing now that this is a pretty fun series.   I look forward to our weekly threads since this is 2 cour.    this ends in october, right?    Honestly, I don't think she's ever done a manga that was as a whole outright bad, even Inuyasha had salvageable stuff in it.     three-way stare battle   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YPP<wbr>zcXCCPeU</wbr>  [ ]      I think Inuyasha really left a bad taste in people's mouths.      Would it have killed the translators to write cliche?    That was so bad it actually distracted me from the episode.    It is the shittiest thing she has ever made. Which means it is still way above average.    They had Carlos on translation duty for this episode.    Wait, so, that means it's good right?   I finished Rebellion. ...So Madoka Thread. Reaction Images or general disscusion.  Fugg, I just got a ban evasion warning for trying to use !HOMU's trip   You are (Not)  Kevin_ -kun.    Didn't watch it while it aired so missed all the fun   Got around to the movie when it was already discussed to death.     I know that feeling.  Though really we probably just missed out on wall to wall shitposting.       Really mister!    HR is slice of life as fuck.  It's just that the characters in it can't enjoy it because of their own personal hang-ups.      What exactly was Kano trying to do, minna-san? I've heard he was trying to rise to the surface but that makes absolutely no dick-sense since he was well aware that texhnolyzation didn't work beyond the range of the obelisk.  Also, during the scene where Shinji goes and starts rampaging throughout the class he comes across a pool of raffia with androgyneous people inside it. What exactly was the purpose of that? I know that it's supposed to be super important but I don't think the show touches much on it.      Kano's motives are strange. From what he said at the end, it would seem that he originally wanted to "evolve" humans using texh and came to his insanity induced understanding that Lux was all in his head and wanted to bring it all to a close after that all happened. I'd need to rewatch, but this is what I remember. Correct me if I'm wrong. As for the people in the Raffia, it was never explained. I'd figure the Class was maybe voluntarily suiciding and reincarnating into Raffia. Either that or it was some clone operation to keep the numbers "pure" or whatever.     Nothing to elaborate on, my post is exactly as is.  One thing about this thread that disgusts me is the excessive association of the life of the author with the actual content.  Might as well look up where he lived during the writing of this story and talk about how that city affects the narrative? Fucking pointless.  The reason the surface world is a dystopia is obvious and Yoshii spells out this aspect clearly, it's the entire reason he descends.             his reasoning is complete nonsense  I agree that Kano's introduction was the weakest portion of the show, but I think his reasoning being nonsense was sort of the point - they talked a lot about madness engulfing Lux.   I can't recall the last time I unironically told someone an anime was too deep for them, but it was actually too deep for you.       Vol 1. TV: Left BD: Right      Barely any changes even though the episodes were full of quality    so what did they change in this scene?    Donquixote Doflamingos funeral thread  In memorium of the worst One Piece villain who ever existed  In Memorium to a selfish narcissitic sob story cunt  I'm glad he got rightfully finished off by Luffy finally.          Nami   Only fodder fights   implying she won't take out her equal in BB's crew        Implying anyone in Blackbeard's crew is shit enough to lose to Nami     Quads confirm it'll happen.    I think we're at a point were silly toys are crushed by handgrab, just like Sabo crushed Burgess' elbow toy.  With how the power levels have scales, mechanical weapons seems to be more and more useless. Franky is also pretty much useless now, coca cola power was cool for a while, but not in the new world.       I'm not realy convinced of this. Maybe because I have too less faith in Nami for being useful in combat. Same goes for Sanji, I can't see him beating Kizaru, and thats highly foreshadowed. Also I like Kizaru too much to get him beaten by Post-TS Sanji.  </blockquote>]
