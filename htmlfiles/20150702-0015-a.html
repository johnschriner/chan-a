[ Cont. discussion, and speculation from    want to play Tsukihime in Japanese <br>  CD-DA music doesn't loop on Win 7 (not even on XP, I think), want to use custom music too <br>  EOPs with their patch can just drop files into a folder <br>  I have to install special software, set Tsukihime to work with it and write a custom ini file by hand <br><br> You win this one EOPs.</br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Best girl.</br>   still no satsuki route   <br>Red skirt looks better, but damn she's still the hottest of the bunch.</br>  <br>Satsuki got 2 redesigns.<br>TM finally admitting she is the most important Tsukihime heroine.</br></br>    <br>Hisui a best.</br>  <br>Her school uniform was always blue and white.</br>  Shiki looks pretty damn good in this one<br><br>Also, <br>That face on top of the page hnng</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like the Arc redesign.<br><br>The only thing that bothers me is the sameface on all the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Arc looks pretty good here too. Shame about the skirt though.</br>  <br>He looks like Shiki now.</br>  <br>You know what bother me about the mini-skirt? The fact that Tsukihime happens it was uncommon for girls going around dressed like that.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Roa, SHIKI and Nero when?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> complaining about sameface in "anime" characters designs. </br>  <br>I prefer it over the original.</br>  <br>And even more Arc considered the fact that she has been sleeping for a shit ton years.<br><br><br>He's shirou with black hair, a fucking recolor. I don't really that but he looks good I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's finally Sacchin's time to shine</br>  <br>don't really like* that</br>  <br>No.<br>It's Arihiko's time.</br></br>  <br> And even more Arc considered the fact that she has been sleeping for a shit ton years. <br>That's irrelevant. She downloads necessary info when she wakes up.</br></br>  <br> Who? </br>  <br>remake moves the game to a more urban and a more modern setting, look it up in the interview</br>  <br>Considering she was always going to have a route i'm sure she will have it this time around. <br><br>It will also help with sales the fact that you get a new route.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if she does get her route but the game ends up being all ages.</br>  <br>Yes she does, but if she's in a time where it's uncommon for girls to use mini-skirt, she gets information that girls use longer ones and then she goes and puts a damn mini-skirt?<br>Doesn't make sense, why would she go for the uncommon thing? She always tries to fit in</br></br>  <br> Lancer's face <br> Shirou's hair <br> UBW Gil's casual attire </br></br></br>  <br><br> posting blank pictures </br></br>  <br> that <br> Shirou's hair </br></br>  <br>She doesn't look nearly as perfect as she did before. Heck even new Ciel could give her a run for her money.</br>  <br>Actually his eyes are different from Shirou and his hair originally doesn't look like that.</br>  <br>Why is he so handsome? <br>I hope he gets a more relevant role in the remake.</br></br>  <br>TM doesn't make eroges anymore anon. Mahoyo was all ages and Fate has been retconned a long while ago. <br>They're rich now, they don't give a fuck anymore about their old fanbase(yeah i'm mad)<br><br>Tsukihime is going all ages too</br></br></br></br>  <br>Tsukihime took place in the year 2000. Miniskirts weren't uncommon back then, especially in Japan.<br><br>Plus, it's possible that the remake will receive a timeline update.<br><br>Besides, Fate/stay night and Fate/hollow ataraxia take place shortly after Tsukihime and I don't see you complaining about the miniskirts in those.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki looks good but when are we getting best Shiki's redesign?</br>  <br> Plus, it's possible that the remake will receive a timeline update. <br><br>No because it would fuck the entire Nasuverse timeline, unless you want Aoko to be like 40 when she meets Shiki</br></br></br>  <br><br>Akiha looks like the best girl, which she is.</br></br>  <br> they don't give a fuck anymore about their old fanbase <br>PFFFFFFFFTHAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAAAA. What?</br></br>  <br> TM doesn't make eroges anymore anon. Mahoyo was all ages and Fate has been retconned a long while ago. <br> retconned <br>No, they just can't sell the eroge on anything but PC. They just had an R18 re-release on PC in 2014.</br></br></br>  <br><br> unless you want Aoko to be like 40 when she meets Shiki <br> implying time and age mean shit to Aoko </br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to believe and I won't until I hear it from Nasu himself.</br>  <br>It's because there're fucking people who use the term "eroge" whenever they bitch about FSN.<br>Fuck that shit. What's so bad about being an eroge?</br></br>  <br>It's what you use as an insult when you can't think of anything else.</br>  <br>Nasu should just completely rewrite SHIKI and Roa. They had an interesting backstory but they were still lame.</br>  <br> implying people play TM VNs for h-scenes <br><br>you must be new, that is the only answer</br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see Akiha remains perflat and supreme.</br>  Type Moon proving it can't stop recycling its 2 series.  <br>Any descent magi can extend their lifespan so nothing wrong with that.</br>  <br>Not as bad as Nintendo.#</br>  <br>One of Akiha's arcade ends where she speaks with Aoko.</br>  <br>Screencap or it didn't happened</br>  <br>Source? Can't find anything about that, anywhere. <br><br>You're not lying to me are you anon? I mean why would you LIE on the internet r-right?<br><br><br>Prepare your heart then, TM doesn't make eroge. <br><br>Because they're fucking retarded, normalfags should kill themselves</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because they're fucking retarded, normalfags should kill themselves <br>Normalfags are where the money is. If you don't want them influencing your Japanese obscurities then become a super rich millionaire and buy Type-Moon.</br></br>  <br> Normalfags are where the money is <br>Very wrong.</br></br>  <br>Then why pander to normalfags?</br>  <br>Maybe for anime, not for VN anon. <br><br>They should just make 2 versions, one with sex the other without it. It's not hard, really it's not. They could add a kiss instead of sex and just fix a few dialogues. <br>That's fucking it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who know? Pandering to otakus is way more common than pandering to normalfags.</br>  <br> They should just make 2 versions, one with sex the other without it. It's not hard, really it's not. <br>It costs more money. All the same people will buy it anyway. Therefore no money is gained.</br></br>  <br>Is that some new character?</br>  From interviews I get the feeling that no H-scenes is less about pandering to normalfags and more about simply not wanting to do them and being big enough now that they don't have to.  <br>For VNs is the same, just look at Clannad or Steins;Gate. Both are all-ages.</br>  <br> It costs more money <br><br>How much deleting a sex scene for a kiss could cost?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fact that the sex scenes were the worst and the stupidest things in F/SN and Tsukihime should already be enough to make you shut up. No sex scene is better than that trash. But I guess that for mindless idiots like you everything that has sex in it is automatically great.</br></br>  <br> How much deleting a sex scene for a kiss could cost? <br>Marketing it, selling off the differing copies, licencing, changing the box art, giving more incentives to buy the others, etc<br><br><br>Why not look at Muvluv too, while you're at it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Akiha's route just wouldn't feel the same without the physical aspect of the forbidden love.</br></br>  <br>Because Muv Luv sales aren't nowhere near to those two.</br>  <br> Source? Can't find anything about that, anywhere. <br>FSN RN was released for PSP and H scenes are not for sony products because of the sony rules this is the reason why RN doesnt have H scenes sameshit happend for other VN too</br></br>  <br>Who's saying that sex makes everything great?<br>It's just the fucking conclusion of the romance between two characters jesus christ. <br><br>Why does sex offend you anon?</br></br></br></br>  From what I can tell, Nasu doesn't really like writing sex scenes. He feels he has no talent for them. He has no reason to write them now that he doesn't have to.  <br>I don't have the game anymore but is  sufficient for you?</br>  <br>None of the routes. <br><br>What would they do? be friends?</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that Tsukihime remake will have no lewd just like Mahoyo</br>  <br>It doesn't matter as much for anyone else as it does with Shiki.<br>Most of his character is about sex and if you take that away from him then you just have a psychopath which isn't really that much different from other characters in TM, like can you imagine the Arc stalking scene without him being on the brink of a orgasm the whole time.</br></br>  <br>Looks like she just want to piss Akiha off.</br>  <br><br>This is a remake. It will be rewritten, so the whole thing will probably change a lot actually.</br></br>  <br>Shiki is a fucking rapist, that's like half his character.</br>  <br>Just because there are no H-scenes doesn't mean it'll be scrubbed of anything sexual. And they could still have fade to black/implied sex like Saber got in RN.</br>  <br>and he is raped too.</br>  <br>They never wanted to make a eroge game in the first place</br>  <br>Really? What motive would Aoko have to do that? Besides it's Melty anon, not exactly the greatest source of canon in the world.</br>  So pic related won't rape maids anymore? WHAT THE FUCK?  <br>Why can't he use a something better to cut people? <br>Why does it have to be the shitty knife? he could have longer range with a katana and I'm sure he knows how to use one considering he's a superhuman DNA freak trained to kill people</br></br>  <br>When Melty is serious is prefectly canon as it was written by Nasu himself. But yeah, that is obviously a joke scene.</br>  <br>Actually, in RN, the narrative explicitly states that they literally only slept together. No sex, just sleeping.</br>  <br> Why does sex offend you anon? <br><br>see<br><br><br> The fact that the sex scenes were the worst and the stupidest things in F/SN and Tsukihime should already be enough to make you shut up. No sex scene is better than that trash. <br><br>Maybe, just maybe, I was talking about Type Moon sex scenes, and not about sex scenes in general.<br>Your reading reading comprehension is pretty crappy. Or maybe <br><br><br> Who's saying that sex makes everything great? <br><br>Myabe because it's clear that as long as it's sex you not only will eat any kind of rubbish, but you will even angrily demand it like a bunch of hungry flies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Nasi thinks his sex scenes are shit. Thus, he no longer wishes to write them.<br><br>Nasu has the freedom to pick and choose what he wants to write now.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, I don't have a problem with them having sex because it's a conclusion of the romantic feelings those 2 characters are having. <br><br>What can you add to make 2 characters feel more like a couple? A kiss? a hug? it's not on the same level(emotional or physically) as having sex, it's really not. <br><br>I wouldn't mind fade to black like pic related. In fact i'd like it A LOT.<br>But no sex feels bland, like in UBW adaptation not even a fucking kiss. Jesus christ I felt Shirou and Rin were just friends even in the end</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> standups <br>Is that what the Japanese call legs these days?</br></br>  <br>Thanks fucking God for that.</br>  <br>But now I will never finish my thesis on aquatic organisms.</br>  <br>Because it's a relic of the Nanayas, not just any knife.</br>  <br>I have never said that I disagree with that, what you wrote is about sex scenes in general, and that's not I was talking about. Yeah, good sex scene put in the right context could only be a good thing. <br>Sadly, that's not how Type Moon worked. And, as some anons have already posted, it seems that Nasu is well aware of that.</br></br>  <br>So is no one going to point out that Sacchin has a 3rd-year's ribbon color while Ciel has a 1st year's? <br>Ciel even looks like a kouhai character with her redesign.</br></br>  What did he said about HF ?   Tsukihime remake  <br> Dark Souls 3 happens <br>RIP remake<br>RIP Sacchin route<br> inb4 Blood Borne 2 </br></br></br></br>  <br> it would fuck the entire Nasuverse timeline <br>Not if it takes place in an alternate universe.</br></br>  <br>Nasu is like fucking DC comics.<br><br> Ah don't mind about it, it happens in an alternate universe! </br></br></br>  <br>What does it have to do?</br>  Does anyone one in this thread currently have a copy of TM Ace. If you do could you post the full image of the Rider and Bazett, also some one said there was a chibichuki chapter; could you post that as well.  <br>Because a sword isn't easily concealable and way too conspicuous. A knife could easily be stored in his pocket without anyone noticing anything out of the ordinary. <br><br>One of Shiki's favored tactics when hunting for killers or vampires is to set himself as a potential harmless victim. He can't use that tactic while carrying a sword.<br><br>Also, it's against the law to carry weapons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't read it in japanese now, wait for the remake.<br>I tried reading it in moon one year ago and the writing was so bad I wanted to gouge my eyes out</br></br>  <br>He said it's being made into 2 movies but he expects everyone comes to see it</br>  <br>  No sex scene is better than that trash. <br>It's not about his reading comprehension. It's because your expression was crap.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Nasu is a massive Soulsfag.</br>  <br>what 2 part for HF?</br>  <br>Does that mean Hisui with her red ribbon is Shiki's senpai now?  You're either overthinking or baiting. </br>  <br>Yeah. It's doomed</br>  <br>Jesus I wish there will be3-4 part of it</br>  <br>I think he is saying he will add new stuff to HF too as he did to UBW.</br>  <br>Why do you lie? He says nothing about 2 movies</br>  <br>Well yeah but I meant as when he's out hunting for an immortal dude with beasts in his fucking body. <br><br>Having a longer weapon wouldn't be a bad idea. not a Katana since I guess it doesn't fit perfectly with his style but still, longer than a fruit knife</br></br></br>  <br>Only 6 movies is enough.</br>  <br>Thank you, now all I need is that chibichuki chapter</br>  <br>I'm joking anon. Can't read moon.<br><br>But anyways we would need a lot of movies and I don't think UFO will do it. <br><br>It's different from KnK because the movies had a beginning and an end, what would they do in HF? one is SoL one is some fights, then SoL, then fights, then SoL, fights fights fights.<br><br>Don't know if you get what I mean.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And where would he get such a thing? It's not like he knows any weapons dealers.<br><br>And anything longer than a knife would be difficult to conceal.</br></br></br>  <br>Barely enough, 8 movies is fine.</br>  <br>then what about this? </br>  <br>Under that logic they would never make a TV anime either. And it doesn't make sense not going all out given what we know and what they did with everything else.<br><br>Also, episodic movies are the new fad.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck. <br>It was for </br></br>  <br> I can't really talk in detail about how HF is going to be made but the people who watched UBW will probably be surprised. <br> I'm really hyped, just like the fans, to go see it on the big screen </br></br>  <br>That doesn't make sense. A TV anime is not the same thing as a movie.<br><br>It should have a beginning and an end, you can do it with Persona for example(finish it with Moon boss fights) but Fate you can't because there's not a lot of climaxes. <br><br>Well i'm no expert but I don't see them being able to do more than 3 without making them a snorefest. And 3 would be bad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone care to speculate on what the surprise is, or does he mean people who have no prior knowledge of the VN are going to be surprised?</br>  <br><br> X was the worst and the stupidest in Z series = (X in Z was trash). Y is better than (THAT trash) = Y is better than (X in Z) <br><br> There was no word about X being shit in general. <br><br>Yeah, such logic is too vague and complex for a common human brain.<br>Anon, stop it, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you do three, one would be basically build up with explanations, saber dying and stuff.<br>The second would be the mid-route climax, which is the rain scene, and some stuff with archer dying and yada yada.<br>The last one would be action nonstop with some infodumps here and there.</br></br></br>  <br>It seems it is just that they want to go all-out with HF.</br>  <br> people who watched UBW will probably be surprised. <br>They'll use PC version instead of RN</br></br>  <br>That part of the interview is basically Nasu and Takeuchi hyping us by saying that HF will be amazing.</br>  <br>HAHAHAHA.<br><br>No they won't. That's been retconned a while ago anon. I mean I wish they did but they won't, I at least won't keep my hopes up</br></br></br>  <br>I'm biased. Always thought Akiha was the best Turkeyhandle but damn, she looks great there.</br>  <br>He stole a mace from Louvre in Prelude.</br>  <br>It's probably 'the route is so different from UBW' surprise.<br>Especially since it starts by spoiling the shit out of Fate route with Saber, Kotomine and Zouken.</br></br>  So is anything like a release date being mentioned, or is this just another cock-tease to tide us over for 5 more years while Nasu plays Bloodborne?  <br>The later, it barely counts as a cocktease because<br> can't say shit </br></br>  <br>Just like they did with UBW right? I won't buy their crap.<br><br>Also why do people keep talking about Fate on a Tsukihime thread. Fuck off, I should also fuck off since I was talking about it too.</br></br></br>  <br>They still sell PC version and RN was for the vita release. They didn't retcon anything</br>  <br>Pretty sure that the mace is for Arcueid.</br>  <br>That uniform looks fucking stupid though</br>  <br><br><br><br>Random question, but is there a specific name for this sort of design sheet with a character portrait and a selection of facial expressions?</br></br></br></br>  <br> and RN was for the vita release <br>And the best pc version, the latest one was RN, with voices, properly sized CGs and stuff.</br></br>  <br>The surprise is that it's going to be the best goddamn shit you've ever seen. Also, there will probably be new epilogue shit.</br>  <br>What? It looks great.</br>  <br><br>It's called 'Literally all the work we've done in the last 7 years'.<br><br>Just a reminder: The remake was announced in 2008. And aside from the occasional magazine blurb with a couple pages of new art, we've been told jack and shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much this, It would be great.</br>  <br>I have no idea of what you are talking about. It looks like a proper uniform more than 99% of anime/manga/VN uniforms.</br>  <br><br><br>Who cares about Arc's skirt, Akiha's headband not being white bothers the hell out of me.</br></br></br>  <br>The second one would be a massive slog.</br>  <br>AKIHA-SAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AA</wbr></br>  <br>While headband was fucking horrible from any point of view.</br>  <br>  those glasses <br>I can only think Persona now</br></br>  <br>Is it? I just assumed it's a going to be a powerup for Shiki and Kiri's weapon is a stick so it kinda fits.</br>  <br>white headband looks cheap.</br>  <br>Because you have shit taste. The white ribbon looked like shit.</br>  <br>Arc having such a short skirt makes no sense when Akiha's is longer. If Arc's skirt was the same length as Akiha it'd be great. <br><br>Still missing the long skirt, but the new art is better than before.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, just photoshop it white and post your result in here so we can praise it.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I know you guys are completely blind and tasteless, you don't have to go out of your way to promote it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiki has no use for maces. He can't cut things with those, and it would weigh him down too much. Shiki relies on stealth, ability, dexterity, precision and speed. A mace is a terrible weapon for him.</br>  <br> cheap <br><br>Yeah, that's it.</br></br></br>  do we have a release date?<br>I downloaded the VN yesterday, but the art is fucking horrible. Don't really feel like playing it at all.</br>  <br> do we have a release date? <br><br>:-)</br></br></br>  <br> The remake was announced in 2008 <br>Holy fuck. I didn't remember it was annouced since 2008.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off then you scrub, don't play it and wait 8 years for this one piece of shit.</br>  <br> do we have a release date? <br>Yes, "After Kizu"</br></br>  So I recently downloaded the Tsukihime VN, but I heard that there's a certain order you should play the different "routes" in to be able to get all the endings or something.<br><br>Is it worth it following some kind of walkthrough for this reason or is it better to just play blind and on the next playthroughs skip the things I've read and just choose make different choices?</br></br>  <br>Why are you so mad, anon?</br>  <br>Can I have Kohaku's 3rd facial expression please?</br>  <br>But anon, I love it, it's as usefull as cheap.</br>  <br>The proper route order is Arc&gt;Ciel&gt;Akiha&gt;Hisui&gt;Kohaku.</br>  <br><br> implying white somehow costs less than black </br></br>  <br><br>It is literally just a publicity stunt to keep TM relevant and people buying mediocre TM products like Mahoyo. <br><br>Seven years and you haven't even announced the VAs? Or if there even will be any? Yeah fuck that. They haven't done shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What this anon said. <br>And yeah use a walkthrough if you want, it's not going to spoil you</br></br>  <br>I hope you are just joking, because missing the point like that isn't an easy task.</br>  <br>They won't do VA's for this. Better to put them in later and repackage it and sell it again. Nasu thinks his writing sells the product anyway. You'd hope Mahoyo might have taught him a lesson.</br>  <br> EOP talking shit about Mahoyo which he didn't even read </br>  <br> Implying you've read mahoyo </br>  <br>You think people would just lie? for no reason?</br>  <br> implying Mahoyo isn't shit <br> Different anon though </br></br>  <br>The VA was already decided since Carnival Phantasm. They'll go with it.<br>What I fear is that it may end up unvoiced like Mahoyo.</br></br>  <br>We have no idea of it's actual size and if it's not too big he can use it like Kiri with his steel stick, besides it seems to be a pretty powerful artifact so it must have some useful power.</br>  <br><br>Ahhh, feeling so much better now!</br></br>  <br> Prelude <br> mattering <br>Next you gonna say Tsukihime 2 will happen</br></br></br>  <br>At least that's still much better than white.</br>  <br>Good for you.</br>    <br> No more raping the maids <br><br>MOTHERFUCKER</br></br></br>  <br>I like my Akiha in any way, she looks pretty doesn't matter what Takeuchi does</br>  <br>I expect at least groping or threatening to do it</br>  <br>But Nanaya doesn't threaten people, he DOES it.</br>  <br> Kohaku ending <br> being happy for the woman that is responsible for everything bad in the far side routes </br></br>  But what about Ciel? I don't care about Whorehaku or Sadchin or fake imoutos.  <br> He doesn't like Kohaku  <br>Shit taste<br><br><br>You know what's sad about Tsukihime?<br><br>That it will NEVER have a fully anime adaptation for the simple fact that there are FIVE routes.<br><br>I mean they would need to make 5 Anime of 25 episodes each and I don't think they will ever do it. <br>I don't think people would buy Tsukihime 5 times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>HEY. Hey. Hey.<br><br> She's responsible for everything in the near side routes too. </br></br></br></br>  <br> Threaten <br><br>He doesn't threaten, just grins and does it.</br></br></br>    <br> I have hope </br>  <br>RAPE THE DOLPHINS</br>  <br>Someone who has it will eventually come to one of the threads, right?</br>  <br>From what is this?</br>  <br>She has nothing to do with Arcueid or Nrvnqsr being in the city.</br>  <br>But anon, you can't rape the dolphins, the dolphins rape you.</br>  <br>KT</br>  SERIOUS QUESTION HERE<br><br>Could Nanaya get raped? Which girl would be able to rape Nanaya?</br></br>  <br>Yeah I just checked google, never played KT. Think I might.<br><br>So what happened to this Tsukihime 2?</br></br></br>  <br> tumblr <br><br>Go ask them.</br></br></br>  <br>Arcueid if she was seriously trying.</br>  <br>Jesus christ are you fucking autistic?</br>  <br>How is being safe from ufo and more Nasu retcons sad?</br>  <br>Best imouto</br>  <br>But can you rape the willing? I mean my point is that I don't see Nanaya NOT wanting to fuck</br>  <br><br>Don't know, have you never noticed over the years that /a/ has issues about tumblr?</br></br>  <br>Nasu didn't retcon anything with the Anime tho. <br><br>VN is still the source material, everything's canon I think</br></br></br>  <br><br>Arcueid and Nrvnqsr wouldn't be in the city if Kohaku hadn't let SHIKI out of his cell, regardless of which personality wound up dominant.</br></br>  Again, someone is getting fired for forgetting to colour that pinky-hook-thingamajig.<br><br> Yes, this is water bottle guy. </br></br>  <br> someone is getting fired <br>Nope.<br>Misses like that happen all the time.</br></br></br>      Second year students drama soon. Are you ready for Oboe and Flute drama.  I really like how this one turned out<br><br>so for good old times sake, which section would you join? trombros where we at?</br></br>  <br>Does she really?

I'd do a Vietnam Taki with that shot if I wasn't so lazy.</br>  <br>Why was Flute-chan sad?</br>  <br><br>I'm going to sleep after I finish typing this so don't expect any answers unless this thread is up in 12 hours which I doubt<br><br>  To start off, Mizore is a girl with an inferiority complex and low self esteem. Which is ironic because she ends up playing the most difficult instrument at the highest skill level. But anyway, Mizore had no friends in and a personality that doesn't let her play well with others. She's often described as "too cold" and she's the kind of person that speaks in short phrases. So along comes Nozomi who is the only girl who actually speaks to Mizore and Mizore more or less falls in love with her. Nozomi is the one who invites her to join the music club with her; Mizore's parents buy her an oboe, parents of the year amirite. And things go great, middle school is fun and Mizore plays with passion; however, they get cocky and end up getting Silver during their last year which ends their club time. This cuts Mizore pretty deep for but for reasons that'll be explained later. So then everyone from their school which includes Natsuki and Yuuko decide to go to Kitauji which is a local school. The club there is bad but they planned to pull off an underdog story to Nationals. Until they find out that the club sucks so much that they're all put in B-team while the slacker seniors get to play in A-team. The only other oboe ends up quitting for some reason and this puts Mizore suddenly into the A-team and this separates Nozomi and Mizore. Nozomi who wanted to play and Mizore who wanted to be with Nozomi. Nozomi confronts the seniors and it ends in an argument that leads to everyone except Natsuki, Yuuko and Mizore quitting. Natsuki's reason is Nozomi related, Yuuko's reason for not quitting is that Kaori asked her to stay. Sadly, nobody asked Mizore to come with them. Not even Nozomi whom Mizore considered her only friend told Nozomi to quit with them. So Mizore felt like she was tossed aside and worthless.  </br></br></br></br>  It's over, KyoAni is finished.  <br>Thanks for everything today, night.</br>  <br>Poor oboe-chan.<br><br>Must've been super duper awkward seeing each other around in classes and stuff after the club fallout.</br></br></br>  <br> hibike!

Nozomi should be in the band.</br></br>  AH dat melody gives me goosebumps. Made me shed a tear, such beautiful melodies and Reina's playing is EXQUISITE  <br><br>I'm just in stitches imagining Kyoani's 2nd ED. The bait is gonna be off the charts.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Implying KyoAni will not go anime original just to have all cuties play in cast</br>  <br>this one is summarized too much cause I'm sleepy<br> so this cuts to next year where everyone gits gud. Nozomi is actually at the concert as we see in this episode. After seeing the performance, she wants to come back to the club. But before she can come back, she wants to get Asuka's approval. Asuka actually tried to stop Nozomi from leaving, also called her chickenshit for quitting but Nozomi left anyway. So Nozomi wants Asuka to accept that she needs her in the club. But Asuka finds out that Mizore being near Nozomi causes Mizore to freak out so in order to protect the Oboe, Asuka doesn't let Nozomi back in. Nozomi keeps coming back everyday, also hangs out a lot with Natsuki to pass the time. Kumiko ends up talking to Mizore several times and learns more about her. Mizore doesn't like concerts because they put a value on your hardwork, and that the judges can deem your efforts worthless. It's not really the concerts though that she hates but something about herself. Also Mizore's solo is criticized by Taki sensei's friend who came as an adviser. He says Mizore playing is flawless but only because she plays like she is a robot, without emotion. Kumiko later talks to Nozomi and learns about her circumstances too. And Kumiko tries her best to mediate this situation, trying to figure out why Asuka won't let Nozomi back in and what is Mizore's deal. Asuka eventually tells everything to Kumiko after Kumiko confronts her about it, and asks Kumiko can she really tell Nozomi that the reason why she can't come back is because Mizore hates her? Kumiko ends up just asking Nozomi why she didnt ask Mizore to leave with her which causes Nozomi to go find Mizore. And this ends up causing an absolutely disastrous moment where Nozomi is chasing Mizore down the hallway, Mizore just freaking out. Yuuko stops Nozomi and Mizore gets away. Kumiko finds Mizore on the floor of another classroom at which point we find out what the real deal is between them. </br></br>  <br>She's important in the second novel too.</br>  According to some novel readers Hazuki and Midori become background characters and Reina is more of a secondary character after vol. 1. If KyoAni ever makes another season I'd like to still see them hang with Kumiko. Hazuki was already getting friendly with Reina during this last episode.  <br>They are background characters in S1 already.</br>  If I could have your attention please, best girl has a few words.  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Only after episode 8.

Is there a word for yandere but with violent part replaced with self degrading? Cause that's Mizore. So Mizore doesn't hate Nozomi, she's just afraid to see her. Mizore thinks of Nozomi as the most important thing in her life while Mizore feels that Nozomi is just a girl who is nice to everyone, think Yuigahama. Even so, Mizore was happy with that until the incident that left her behind which left her feeling worthless, which is what her beef with concerts is about. The reason why Mizore has gotten so good is so that Nozomi will notice her. The reason she plays the oboe is because it's the only thing that remains between her and Nozomi. Nozomi is all she has in her life. So then steps in Yuuko, who has been Mizore's friend since middleschool and has been looking after her this whole time Mizore who calls her out on her shit. That Mizore thinks of everyone and everything else as nothing to her. That all these friends she's ignoring she considers are worthless to her. Yuuko asks Mizore what she is to her, and Mizore says Yuuko is just someone who is pitying her, which pisses Yuuko off even more and makes Yuuko grab both of Mizore's ears. Yuuko genuinely cares about Mizore, but she's too much of an idiot to see it. Then Yuuko, while still holding onto Mizore's ears, asks Mizore has everything in this club meant nothing to her then? The music she's played, the fun they've had, the suffering they've been through from all the tournaments, the happiness when they made it to Kansai. Mizore finally understands she's her own person and not worthless and asks Yuuko if she deserves to be this happy and starts crying on Yuuko's shoulder when she tells her of course. And then Nozomi shows up at the doorway, dun dun dun <br><br>this scene is actually very touching but I'm too tired to write it in a way that makes it sound good so bear with me here.</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with this pic? Because I can't tell at all</br>  <br>You forgot to mention the fact that she's a senior, meaning she's probably older than him.

It wasn't about Reina x Kumiko after all.</br></br>  <br>I will punch anyone who says Yuuko is shit now. She is the best friend you could ask for.</br>  <br>  So Mizore finally can talk to Nozomi without freaking out and confronts her on why she left her behind. Nozomi never thought of it as leaving Mizore behind, infact Nozomi didn't want Mizore to lose her chance to play in the tournament by forcing her to leave just because Nozomi had a beef with the seniors. She wanted Mizore to keep playing because she knew Mizore loved music, whether or not Mizore realized that yet herself but she does now thanks to Yuuko. Nozomi wants to apologize for making Mizore feel like crap up until now but Mizore tells her everything is diejoebu. Nozomi then reveals that she went to the concert to see her, that Nozomi has always loved the sound of Mizore's oboe. Also that she'll be at the Kansai tournament tomorrow too. Then Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants to hear her practice her solo and those two leave together. In the end, Nozomi doesn't come back to the club because Asuka still thinks its better safe than sorry just in case Mizore freaks out again. MIzore dedicates her solo to Nozomi and everything ends out great <br><br>the end  except I skipped most of the actual earlier details like how Kumiko talked to Nozomi at the pool, and how she talked to Mizore at night at band camp but you ge the idea </br></br></br>  <br>She's just going to bed, anon.</br>  <br>Missed your other posts, I don't mind a yes or a no.

You get ranked gold silver copper based on your performance and only a select number of gold can make it through to the next tournament.</br></br></br>  <br>    to hear her practice her solo <br>   "hear" "practice" "her solo" <br>Is this how they call it these days?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you novelanon. Now get some well earned sleep.</br>  <br>Yes I love that part. I'm glad someone made this.</br>  <br>She looks better with that bow.</br>    <br>look at the webm, the color's just too contrast for light effect.</br>  <br>Did anyone else bawl like little bitch when the ending credits came in?</br>  <br> So then steps in Yuuko, who has been Mizore's friend since middleschool and has been looking after her this whole time <br><br>Do you know how difficult it is to keep updating my best girl list?</br></br></br>  <br> Is this how they call it these days? <br>Yeah. That sounds... sexy. A little too strange... Oh well, whatever that makes them happy.</br></br>  <br>Because they did get gold, only dud golds. The real gold winner or winners, not sure, was announced later by the judge.</br>  <br>Do we at least get a mention of what the seniors do after they graduate?</br>    <br>backalley</br>  <br>I need to reread her parts but yes she does get a minor scene of relevancy where she calls Kumiko the night before Kansai and tells Kumiko to find her at the tournament. I don't think Azusa is enjoying herself very much. The novel doesn't go any further into it but it seems like they're setting up for some original s2 drama. Because they showed wayyy too many Azusa shots in the ending.</br>  <br>Not much?</br>  <br>She's so fiercely loyal. That could be overwhelming but also really nice to know someone actually has your back 100%.</br>  <br>Stop projecting.</br>  <br>so thats why Oboe-chan the only one doesnt smile<br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>Asuka, Oboe and Taki Lovestory are all I wrote so far. <br><br>Taki Love Story<br> &gt;Taki sensei's wife is a former student and band member of Kitauji<br> She was also Taki's dad's former student <br> She never took gold though at Nationals though <br> Taki and his wife met in college at the music club <br> cue Everybody Loves Somebody <br> Taki's wife becomes a teacher at another school and their band adviser, Taki is also a teacher but avoids band due to hating his dad <br> Wife is too gentle though so the club never get good <br> cue Clannaids, wife dies of illness <br> Taki goes into mourning for a few years, so depressed he can't even touch instruments.  <br> Taki dad tells him to get off his ass  <br> Taki sensei gets assigned to Kitauji because his dad used to work there <br> Taki's wife's dream was that her Kitauji would one day get gold <br> Taki sees this as a chance to fulfill his wife's dream <br> cue Hibike!

I have a question for my fellow Cross Ange fans. What'd you guys think of Valvrave? I'm trying to find out if there's any overlap between fans of the two shows. Personally I wasn't too keen on Valvrave, but it did do some interesting things with lies and the lying liars who tell them. But I think Cross Ange handled its social commentary much better overall, and was just very clever all around. It was probably one of my favorite shows of last year, and I watched a lot of good shows, like G-Reco, Argevollen, Nozaki, and Ping Pong.<br><br>Anyway, what are your thoughts? Right now, I'm thinking about girls, but I always am.</br></br>  Leave.   Nice argument, dude. <br>You realize I have no argument because you have none yourself?<br>How is making tons of references not pandering? How are Cross Ange characters not stereotyped? How is completely atypical of the genre when Code Geass had maid and shit like that too?<br>And really, all I said was that people are tired of that kind of humor and mix of genres. Simple as that.<br><br>  thinks it invented those poses <br>Nobody thinks that, everyone knows Fukuda for his complete lack of ideas.<br>Also who the fuck talked about poses and such? There were references to Freedom's weapons and some Kira and Assram toys.<br>Again, more proof you know shit of what you are talking about?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Bronze players   <br>Elo hell, am I right?</br>  So why didn't she just pay Arlong with her body?  would arlong even be attracted sexually to a human? he hates them.  <br> implying arlong would fuck a filthy inferior human </br>  <br> implying Bell-Milf is a filthy inferior human </br>  <br> implying she actually had those two kids <br>She was still in prime when she was killed</br></br>  <br>You can still be a milf if your kids are adopted.</br>  Now that last week's filler reaction chapter was out of the way, what do you expect this week?<br><br> Jesus steals Doffy/Law's fruit <br>   Kizaru outta nowhere <br> Party chapter </br></br></br></br>  <br>- Burgess bravely runs away<br>- Donquixotes are rounded up<br>- no party, cause the entire country is in ruins and there's nowhere to party<br>- Sabo gives Straw Hats a ride on his own ship and takes them to Zou</br></br></br></br>  <br> the entire country is in ruins and there's nowhere to party <br> Implying that even stop Skypiea people to not having a party. </br></br>  <br>another chapter of reaction pics ending with burgess springing into action<br>no chapter next week</br></br>  I'm guessing the Sunny will be hinted at in the last panel of the chapter, then it will appear in a silhouette in the last panel of that chapter, then no chapter next week<br><br>I really want to see Robin and Sabo/Koala reunite, and deliver some message to Luffy about Dragon</br></br>  What made this guy so strong?  <br>As of yet unseen Haki/DF powers</br>  <br>Love for adventures.</br>  <br><br>i used to think it was some hidden power of something but now i think its more along the lines of king or more relevant like buggy <br><br>even though he was a D he didnt get any real kickass special powers, hes probably just really charismatic and happened to be in high stakes situations and everyone just assumed he did it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, someone like Rayleigh wouldn't follow a weakling.</br>  Because he didn't want to have sex with a monkey. Now if she was a fish...  <br>He awakened his Haki.</br>  <br>Rayleigh makes me hope that Roger didn't have any df either. Conquering the world just with guts, friends, luck and talent sounds very fitting.</br>  <br>Dressrosa people can party all they want, Straw Hats can't afford that anyway. They need to get healed and set sail ASAP, or else they're risking a "rescue Sanji" arc.</br>  <br>Then luffy would just be shit by comparison</br>  Doflamingo wasn't even that evil, he just wanted to kill normies  <br>Cuz humans are gross duh!</br>  <br>Because Arlong doesn't like human pussy. Ever seen his sister? That's some prime Shark Pussy right there.</br>  <br>100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and a 10km run, every day for three years, followed by a wig glued to his head.</br>  I always found it weird that Arlong was the strongest in East Blue and he walked around in a Hawaiian shirt and sandals.  <br>Luffy walks around in sandals and a Hawaiian shirt on Dressrosa.</br>  <br>She's a fucking Marine</br>  <br>So, in the end she DID pay with her body.</br>  <br><br>Zoro has no df but luffy has one<br>Rayleigh has no df but Roger...<br><br>I see a pattern</br></br></br></br></br>  If the grand line is so dangerous, how the fuck are there random civilians everywhere there?  <br>it's not a pattern if you can't prove there's a pattern</br>  <br>because pirates dont work? Someone has to maintain the farms and such</br>  <br>I mean how do the civilians even get there?</br>  <br>Another filler reaction chapter.<br>With the backstory of a character no one cares about (for example,Rebecca). Oda is stalling for chapter 800.</br></br>  <br>Travelled with strong captains<br><br>Look at noland. His entire crew was cannon fodder and he sailed everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Born there. Maybe some descended from retired pirates or are just bastard children?</br>  Reminder we'll spend a whole chapter wasted on Mansherry crying back all of Dressrosa (also Kyros's leg), they didn't bring up that her tears curing buildings to for no reason, thus erasing everything physical Doflamingo has done to anyone on Dressrosa (I understand he caused over 10 years of mental anguish but whatever most people didn't even know it was happening or that they were missing loved ones.)<br><br>Not to mention what happens from now on with Rebecca and her family. This post arc is gonna be balls except for finding out what the Colosseum fighters are gonna do and Doffy's fate.<br><br>I know Oda will pull something outta left field but I'm keeping my hopes down low.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People have been living there for thousands of years. The Great Age of Pirates began 24 years ago.</br>  <br><br><br>POETRY<br>O<br>E<br>T<br>R<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This chapter will be "party" chapter if there even is one. Next will be discussion chapter about the main story and the world as a whole and maybe a glimpse of sanji and co. Then luffy and the rest will set off to wherever sanji is and then we will get glimpses of major players and old friends throughout the world which may last another chapter. So unless we get an arc on sanji's adventures, the next island should be 5-6 chapters away.</br>  <br> Doffy is cuffed and blindfolded.  <br> Fuji is gonna pull a Kizaru now that everyone is weakened. <br> A large ship appears from the horizon </br></br></br>  DOFFYFAGS<br><br>B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>L<br>O<br>W<br>N<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>F<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>O<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the problem oda isn't addressing. If shank's crew is naturally on a whole other level of power than the rest of the world from pure skill and haki without powerups, and if roger was just incredibly strong, enough to be pirate king, in his base form he's always in, how can luffy possibly compete when his base form can be slapped aroumd by anyone worth half a shit, and he has to destroy his body or be completely vulnerable for 10 minutes afterwards just to get CLOSE to his opponent's power, which is still eclipsed by someone like shanks and even more by roger? He's relying on his fruit to give him all his strength when he needs to be stronger in his base form. He needs more training</br>  <br>Wishful thinking my brother. We're lucky if Mansherry fixing everything and the Rebecca family's future is only one chapter each, veryy lucky.<br><br>I do hope the crew splitting up leads to something a bit different, sorta like Luffy soloing the story for Impel Down/Marineford, next could be a mini-arc of pretty much every character who really needs to shine or just not look like shit(The Sanji-Hats), it's kinda perfect. If the Kidd alliance was after Big Mom it would be cool to see it with them, or maybe by some stretch of luck the Leftover Hats adventure with the Heart pirates.</br></br></br>  <br>Arlong is a fishman supremacist and loathes humans.</br>  <br>No DF, just an incredibly huge badass. Literally nothing "special". Basically like Garp.</br>  <br>probably the combo of haki and some broken ass devil fruit.</br>  <br>His nose hair</br>  <br>the gomu gomu no mi</br>  Found this in a grocery parking lot. Good taste or autism?  <br> Hancock <br> good taste </br></br>  <br> implying that's not your car </br>  <br>Seriously I was walking past and saw it and had to take a picture</br>  <br>Oda's never went without Luffy for that long, I doubt he would give Nami's group the focus for an entire arc.</br>  <br> triforce <br>Autism</br></br>    <br>Disgusting fish dck.</br>  law is a slut  <br>because fishmen don't fuck, the female lays eggs into the water and the male puts his milk on them.</br>  <br>the grand line is dangerous to SAIL, what with the sea-monsters and crazy weather, but once you're on an island the environment becomes much more stable due to magnetic poles or some such bullshit, so if you can handle the unique environment of the island itself you're good as long as you stay there.</br>  <br>No. The thought of copulating with a woman, or race mixing in general, would likely make Arlong's stomach turn. The man's racial pride would likely make the most hardcore Stormfronter blush.</br>  <br> Still no fanart of Shyarly teasing her manlet older brother </br>  <br>This raised a huge question for me. They went through the trouble of saying that Fishmen and Mermen and mermaids are different things. So are arlong and his sister half breeds? Or is it just kinda random and sometime you're a fishman and sometimes you're a mermaid/Merman?</br>  <br>It'd be like hitler trying to fuck a jew.</br>  <br>Yeah, both fishmen and merfolk have recessive genes that their children can inherit so two fishmen can birth a merman and vice versa.</br>  <br>It'd be Hitler fucking a deformed and mentally retarded half breed gypsy jew while she smokes a cigarette and takes a dump on his paintings.</br>  <br>Literally explained in the manga</br>    <br>Who's gay.</br>  <br><br>Ah dang. I don't know how I missed that. I JUST reread this part too. My bad.</br></br>  I like how the presence of half-fishmen and half-giants explains why some people are weird looking and/or freakishly tall.  <br> Someone somewhere in the One Piece canon universe got that snu-snu </br>  <br>I wonder how Magellan and Hannyabal got horns in their genes.</br>  <br> even though he was a D he didnt get any real kickass special powers, hes probably just really charismatic and happened to be in high stakes situations and everyone just assumed he did it <br><br>Shiki had mentioned that he single handedly destroyed his 500-fleet armada. I think he's strong, like really fucking strong.</br></br></br>  What does this face convey /a/?  <br>Im pretty sure we're gonna see sanji, and or what the kidd alliance is up to then end it with a cliff hanger, next weeks chapter they're gonna rush to zou</br>  <br>Because arlong only fucks top notch babes like his sister</br>  <br>man Den was underrated<br><br> Where the fuck is my merman porn? </br></br></br>  <br>My face hurts, my crew was useless, I want to be a real celestial dragon and go home, this monkey is annoying</br>    <br>hes a big guy</br>  <br> I'm sure that he will die after this one <br> Your efforts are futile strawha- OH WAIT WHAT THE NO FUCK FUCK FUUCK FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU </br></br>  <br><br>there's also the possibility to consider of the children of zoan-users.</br></br>  <br>so Bellamy is just a giantlet how hit puberty post TS?</br>  <br> children of zoan-users. <br><br>dont be dumb</br></br></br>  <br> A guy woke up and decided to fuck a giant <br> He succeeded </br></br>  <br> "I really don't think I'm having a good day right now" </br>  <br>So infidelity would be relatively easy to get away with for fishmen and mermaids</br>  <br>Never go full retard, anon.</br>  What would Arlong think of  cute  half-breeds?  <br>"lol gg it took 200 of you to kill me"</br>  <br>I think that would be more of an ng considering how above humanity he thought he was</br>  <br>She's racist.</br>    <br> One piece  <br> Filler  <br><br>Is your head ok anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ this art is so messy. Not to mention the unnecessary amount of text bubbles. I miss his old artwork</br>  <br> There's something I forgot isn't there <br> Rule #1: Never buy into your own hype <br> FUCK </br></br></br>  <br>There's supposed to be a lot of text going on there as he's dumping a lot of info at once as you can tell by Franky's "I'm not actually following what this guy is saying" face</br>  <br> This hurts more than it's supposed to be </br>  <br>So how come all of Poseidon's kids are mermen?</br>  <br><br>Poseidon doesnt have any kids</br></br>  <br>Because it's the king's heritage. Do you seriously think his ancestors fucked some commoner mermen in the past?</br>  <br>He was always huge, back in Jaya he was at least eight feet tall.</br>  <br>Really? I thought he understood and was just fascinated by what he was saying since he looked up to Tom so much.</br>  <br>he got huge Post TS though</br>  <br>I think you have the right interpretation</br>  <br>Looks like anime just fucked up. Luffy comes up to his chest here.</br>  <br>Sittin down and crouching over, he still is taller than Luffy, he only increased his muscle mass during the time skip.</br>  <br>yeah I suppose so since they make Bartolomeo like the exact same height</br>  <br>Luffy seems to be further from the background in that image given the direction he's facing.</br>  So is CP-0 still on the island?  <br>He wanted to protect his friends more than anyone else wanted to protect their friends</br>  <br> Good thing I didn't make the mistake of underestimating him like everyone else did </br>  <br>Blaaar I miss old One Piece, shit like this is so rereadable. I like Post TS but things haven't really felt the same since maybe Impel Down. I don't wish to reread Dressrosa anytime soon, reread the fight, I might do the flashback that was good</br>  <br>Pretty sure they were leaving when we saw them</br>  <br>To be fair doffy tried going all out and couldn't possibly know luffy would have another brother and ally himself with everyone</br>  <br>That's on Doffy too. He had all these strong fighters gathered in that coliseum and somehow never saw that biting him in the ass.</br>  <br>To his credit he at least created a Spider's Web before sending his final attack through it. He just forgot that an enlarged version of an attack that could already send him flying across the island would wreck everything in its way</br>  <br> there's always a logical reason for phenomena <br>YOU LIVE IN A WORLD WITH MAGIC FRUITS THAT GIVE YOU SUPERPOWERS!</br></br>  <br><br>What? is it so outlandish to think a child conceived from a human and a human/animal hybrid couldn't retain some animal like traits?</br></br>  Post best One Piece music<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hv_<wbr>mT53eLec</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>you already fucked up</br>  <br>Link unrelated</br>  <br>Are YOU going to tell him he can't?</br>  <br> will it be a squid? <br> or a kid? </br></br>  <br>It's not even so much a Hawaiian shirt as it is a sunflower shirt ...which is even worse<br><br>He also wore a blouse on Amazon Lily</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I can't hold all that shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>Because she isn't a slut and has pride. Not like arlong is interested in human woman to begin with.</br>  So who's gonna join the crew?  <br>Make sure you don't listen to that song he linked then</br>  <br>This is very plausible.</br>  Is Luffy in the top 15 of the world already? In influence or strength  <br>It looks like "beautiful lady with a snake" so it's fine. Fuck that Zelda shit though,</br>  <br> JESUS FUCKING CHRIST THESE SHARDS ARE SO CLOSE TO MY EYE </br>  <br>Nah.

They love their captain a lot. Once Law goes, I'M going to miss him.<br><br>I find it cute that his crew doesn't call him by name, though. For some reason. Kidd's and Luffy's crews call them by name. Law's doesn't. Not saying that's a good or bad thing.</br></br></br>  <br> this wasn't this bad a few months ago </br>  <br>Obviously not. Why else would he ditch them? That makes him a scumbag in your eyes, I bet.<br>Or perhaps the fact that he left his crew and is using strawhats, and not his precious crew, in a near death attempt to kill Doffy makes him an even bigger scumbag. "Why waste my crew when I can use this dumb fuckhead's?" Winning!</br></br>  <br><br>Or maybe he came into this with a deathwish and didn't want his crew to die along with him.

I love to please</br>  <br>guys what if it was a decoy, look at his face, threads/strings perhaps or just shock of impact effects?</br>  <br><br>I suspect that's Doffy but he's not actually KO'd<br><br>Just laying there in pain, unable to move but still awake and in a bad mood</br></br></br></br>  what would happen if a devil fruit got a bite taken out it by two people at the exact same time, perfectly synchronized  <br>Well, according to physics, that's impossible, one or the other would have to be the first, so yeah that's boring.</br>  <br>If like to think he was just a huge badass, who became the pirate king because he wanted to and worked his ass off for it.</br>   tfw re-reading FI <br>Who love OP here?</br>  <br>me but not that arc</br>  <br>whitebeard in his prime was the only person to tied with him,which probably means garp in his prime is stronger,unless his illness or flashback says so other why's</br>  <br>FI was fun<br> we're friends, right? <br><br>Also, Shirahoshi has pink hair and cries a lot<br>Rebecca has pink hair and cries a lot<br><br>Why not weakbecca?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> get cucked <br> oh those merman genes! </br></br>  <br> implying cucking is a thing when your reproductive mode is shooting your jizz over eggs in the sand </br>  <br>literally<br> why were these people born into my world? </br></br>  <br><br>So did Genzo ever tap that?</br></br>  <br>Awakened Haki</br>  How would you guys feel about Rebecca joining the SH?<br><br>You can't complain about being a sword user, since she literally, doesn't attack.</br></br>  <br>Why is Papagg so balla?</br>  <br>Never ever, remember when Kyros said she will never have to fight again.

It would explain why she confronted Doflamingo since she probably learned she needs to hurt others to protect those she loves.</br></br></br>  <br> she confronted Doflamingo <br>She fucking didn't. She just stayed there watching Viola getting beaten and then got caught by Doflamingo.She didn't move a single inch.</br></br>   tfw Robin will never have a chapter dedicated to her like all the other straw hats   If the only way into the Royal Neptune Palace is through a tube that is locked by a steel gate, how did the axe Vanderdecken get through to almost hit Shirahoshi?  <br>Doffy stands up again, is pissed, wants to kill Luffy, realizes that Sabo and Fujitora are roaming around, flees.</br>  <br>You're missing the point, she even thought to herself while running there that if she doesn't do something it's all for nothing, she at least tried even if she did get controlled.</br>  <br>Axes don't really care for paths.</br>  <br>You're missing the point. She didn't try. She literally didn't even move,you see her only crying. There is a difference between just thinking she'll do it and actually doing it.</br>  <br>Are you doubting Oddachi?</br>  <br>And I'm sure everybody would love to watch that all series</br>  <br>Rich reggae sea star that gets all that fish pussy.</br>  <br> she at least tried <br>No, see, she didn't try. She quite literally did not try. She didn't even move, she was standing there and then got Parasite'd</br></br>  <br>Wan Piss of Shit.</br>  <br>I literally just checked and she stayed there because Viola told her to, honestly not that much time passed any ways she did not stay there long before she got parasited.</br>  <br>Wan Piss is great</br>  <br> that barto <br>why did he stop</br></br>  <br>Better than Riku? Of course.<br><br>What about Cobra?</br></br></br>  <br> Barto could've became a nakama right then and there </br>  <br>Cobra helped a bunch of wanted criminals spy on his bathing daughter. What kind of king does that?</br>  <br>Excuse me?</br>  <br>He needs an hour to build up that punch and even then you can just cross your fingers and be safe from it. What a lame dude.</br>  <br>Okay, then out of the good kings Riku is the worst.</br>  <br>He saved hundreds of lives with that punch. Best damn janitor ever.</br>  <br>That's the aftermath of the brain transplant surgery.<br><br>Starfish don't actually have brains but Papagg was given one by a generous mad doctor. It's also why he can walk and talk.</br></br></br>  so if Roger was basically Luffy, does this mean he was also a huge idiot and people just remember him as some sort of great man? (Just like doffy perceived luffy during the great war)  How strong do you guys think Noland is? He sliced up that snake pretty easily, but I'm not sure how I could compare to any of the modern day cast.  <br>like your average new world pirate.</br>  <br>I'd probably lose all faith in Oda.<br>I can take the girls not being relevant in fights and men going easy on them because they're girls but this ? No, that'd be unacceptable.  I'd probably still read it though </br></br>    <br>hence the 'See you next week' meme is always posted here. People always cry and whine and say they'll drop the series but they always come crawling back.</br>  <br>Somebody is incredibly assblasted.</br>  <br><br>To be fair he took a beating</br></br>  <br><br>I actually really love the sunflower shirt he's been wearing in Dressrossa. Probably the best look Luffy has had since Enies Lobby.</br></br>     Oda doesn't want to make romance dragging the adventure down <br> princesses keep falling for Luffy <br> One Piece is turning into a long distance harem <br><br>If the Strawhats go to the reverie Luffy is gonna drown in so much pussy the world government won't need sea stone handcuffs to neutralise his powers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a guy who goes to my uni whose number plate is '1piece' and he has stickers of the whole straw hat crew across the back window, if I come across it again I'll get a pic for you all.</br>  <br>Surely, the biggest question has to be<br> Who is actually going to give 2 shits about Rebecca when the arc is over, <br>Right ?</br></br></br>  <br>And rightly so. No named character has been more useless and/or more shat on by Oda than Rebecca. She may very well be the only character whose objective she didn't act upon. She kept thinking about attaining it, but she never seem to do anything right. She runs away, cries, try to kill people with blunt swords, what the everloving fuck. <br>In a series where willpower is the key to powerlevel, even a little girl like her (a fucking gladiator whose nickname is "the undefeated woman" for fuck's sake, I refuse to believe someone who keep evading strikes can't strrike themselves) could have done something. But no, it's like Oda did everything to ensure someone would do the stuff in her stead so they'd look good. That's the only thing she did right, make other people look good for saving/sparing/rising her.</br></br>  <br>You're awfully emotional over this. So this is what it's like when someone is tsundere for their waifu.</br>  <br> emotional <br>But I didn't use a reeeeee pepe<br>.<br> So this is what it's like when someone is tsundere for their waifu <br>Not my waifu but I can see that the reason I'm so assblasted is because I had high expectations for her, character development wise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be okay with him being a generic pirate who wields a pistol in one and a sword in other hand. <br><br>And yeah he punches stuff inbetween.<br><br>A pirate Garp.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He does kinda have a point though. Getting the key to Law's cuffs are the only good thing I can remember her doing.</br>  <br> Garp <br> using a gun <br>He'd shoot himself in the foot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>His pistol probably rips people in half due to his haki being so strong.</br></br>  <br>She wasn't even a qt so there's no point to her existence.</br>  <br> a pirate Garp <br>I always wonder if the pirates in OP carry pistols and swords just because they look piratey.</br></br>  <br>Even that was useless because Doflamingo sent a clone to bring his own keys to Law anyways.</br>  <br>The sword is probably how he got the scar.<br><br><br>That's more arguable since it's subjective. She's pretty hot, in all fairness. Maybe even hotter than Nami, cause I like her hair more. But that's just me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, but they ended up not using that key. Look, I'm not saying she did good, I'm saying she, at least, did something. No matter how insignificant or rather useless it was.</br>  <br>I think her hair is trash personally so I guess that's why our opinions differ.</br>  <br><br>E U R O B E A T<br><br>http://www.youdubber.com/index.php?<wbr>video=fr_hwWJcHf4&amp;video_start=150&amp;a<wbr>udio=EJ8YljjhGc0&amp;audio_start=187</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well sure, of course you're right.  But because they didn't use it now we'll never know for sure why Doffy did what he did fuck fuck fuck reeeeee </br>    <br>That explains that. I don't know, I just like that her hair is all proper and nicely done and what not. But hey, that's subjective for ya.</br>  <br>Cause he was still willing to let it all slide ? Remember when Luffy and Law first reached Doffy and Trebol ? Doffy asked them, just to make sure, why they were there and he was "disappointed" by their reply. Pretty sure he still asks Law to give him the operation in the middle of the fight.</br>  <br> what the hell is a kong <br>Fuckin' kekked heartily. Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think so too but that's all just speculation I would have liked for someone to confront him about it so we could have been sure.</br>  Burgess got owned as expected and looks like blackbeard is calling him.  <br>Bah, that's too much info, in my opinion. Some things have to be pieced together by character's dialogue. It's no fun having a quiz on stuff like this. Pretty sure Doffy even started talking about first meeting Law after they refused his key. It's not all that unclear what his intentions were.</br>  <br>Yeah you're right, I guess all I wanted were more scenes with Doflamingo.<br>It hurts to think we won't see him for a good 5 eays now.</br></br>  <br>He'll always be in your heart Anon.

Her armpits smell like horny teenager.</br>  <br>  the second in command of the revolutionaries beats the second in command of a Yonko <br>Wow,truly surprising, Sabo must be Kaido level</br></br>  <br>Where in the world don't they teach that stuff?</br>  <br>Hitler was a Jew.</br>  <br>Yeah, because WB's Commanders who could fight to a tie with Admirals and top tier Shichibukai are just a bunch of shit.<br><br>The only one who could so easily defeat anyone on that level is a Yonko. But One Piece's power levels are shit,anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Some kind of patchouli perfume, probably Angel. Fits with the blue hair too.</br>  <br>Marco was jack shit compared to Whitebeard. Same with Jozu. Burgess is no exception. He had to run away when Teach fought Ace and it was explicitly stated that none of them stood a chance against Ace. Why people think Sabo, who is clearly stronger, would be a different case is a mystery to me.</br>  <br> It's a Sabo chapter <br><br>I hope Law gets a bit more of a reaction to Doffy's defeat than that near-blank one panel stare in 790.</br></br></br>  <br>I... Is there a bigger version?? I'd like to hopefully read. Sorry for asking if it's not possible. Thank you.</br>  <br> actually wanting more law <br>Please no</br></br>  <br>You literally just spelled it out, bro. The commanders could fight to a tie. The Yonko's could do it easily.

Did he get his closure or something? Also, what's he going to be up to after this? Now that he's "free"?</br>  <br>If Oda's going to bother making him the MC for ~150 chapters then I want to see some fucking emotional payoff to end the character's journey</br>  <br>It wasn't exactly mandatory here either but it never occurred to me to opt out of it as a kid. The textbooks had such pretty pictures, especially about the OT stuff.</br>  <br><br>This. Damn, make him cry or something.</br></br>  <br> to end the character's journey <br> implying <br>Law is going to stick around for another 100 chapters</br></br></br>  <br><br>Didn't he pass out last chapter ?

Any chapter is fine with me. I kind of need some closure too before I say goodbye to Law.</br>  <br><br><br>Law. Crying. Wh... Why do I want this... I know he cried a lot as a kid but... Well, that or maybe just him looking like he's in peace. Or sleeping. Those eyebags, man. Those eyebags.</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu gomu</br>  <br>But fanservice isn't even the reason Rebecca sucks as a character.</br>  <br>It's the Curl-Curl Fruit, it has immense power to roll up anything.<br><br> Roger used it to style his moustache. </br></br></br>   Law still hasn't made a one piece cryface <br>Time's running out.</br>  <br>He'll do in the kaidou arc  before giving luffy enternal youth </br>  <br>Well, some people theorize the Void Century has something to do with the seas becoming unsailable. Whether or not that's true though, people have been living on these islands for over 1000 years (it's directly mentioned in Dressrosa) and up until 20 years ago, nobody had ever even reached the end of the Grand Line (in known history). So clearly they were a lot like the real world where people lived everywhere but it only was explored slowly over the course of hundreds of years until connections were made through technology between all these various lands.</br>  <br>Jesus "Jobber" Burgess does it again.</br>   ・季刊誌ジャンプSQ.CROWN 7月17日発売  <br>巻頭カラー血界、表紙＆センターDグレ <br>ToLOVEる ダークネス 矢吹先生ラフ画集＆描き下ろしアニメポスター <br><br> ・SQ.9月号にうまるちゃん出張版 </br></br></br></br>  I don't understand.

I don't have much going, but I feel I know what you are talking about to an lesser extent. <br><br>For as long as I can remember, academically my shit has been all over the place. I went to school in a pretty affluent area, so the both the quality of education and the academic standards were at a higher bar. I was bright enough to keep up, but for some reason I just couldn't be responsible. I'm not sure when, but there was a point when I just got sick of myself, so I tried to actively change. <br><br>Years later here I am.

They are on the CoR on the 教本 sheet under 暗記:<br> Tae Kim Vocabulary <br>Uses the actual sentences the vocabulary terms come from, in order of appearance.<br> Core 2k/6k Tae Kim Vocabulary <br>Uses the Core2k/6k deck, reordered for the vocabulary used in Tae Kim's grammar guide, by order of appearance. <br><br><br>I am that person. I'm not after html files because they are secondary and do not display exactly the same across all browsers and pdf readers. Forgot to add that I wasn't after html folders for each book but a singular cross compatible file, aka a pdf. In retrospect this should have been added to the post. My mistake, sorry about the confusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How many individual kanji are in the Core 2k/6k deck? I'm 48% through it at the moment after a few months and found that I could recognise about 600-800 of the kyouiku kanji upon a quick scroll through a list of them -- how many different kanji (from the deck only) will I be able to recognise after finishing the whole thing?  <br>Running the example sentences through Jparser provided this<br>http://pastebin.com/JkBMpN1h<br>First column is number of appearances. A fair few with less than five appearances.</br></br></br>  <br>That's... pretty damn neat. Thanks.<br><br>It's only slightly more than I expected. I was assuming all kyouiku kanji would be in there, but not all jouyou kanji. 1650 is a very decent amount.</br></br></br>  <br>Not all kanji in example sentences are used in the new words, and I doubt that he will be able to recognize kanji he only saw in example sentences. Using kanji grid and limiting it to Japanese word field gives 1597 unique kanji.</br>  <br> Not all kanji in example sentences are used in the new words <br>That seems like an oversight by iKnow. Oh well, get what you pay for and all.</br></br>  <br>Well, this is how my cards look, so the example sentences are still going a good deal of teaching.<br><br>1597 in the word field is still excellent, though.</br></br></br>  <br>If you replace the example sentence field with {{furigana:[whatever your field name is]}} those kana in brackets should be displayed as furigana, if you like.</br>  <br>For furigana use {{furigana:your_name_of_field with _furigana}} like {{furigana:Notes-Kanjified-vocab Reading}}</br>  <br>I know, but at that font size the furigana is too awkward to read (my monitor is 72dpi) and I don't want to increase the font size as the purpose is to replicate regular text kanji as seen online and shit.</br>  <br><br>振仮名脳</br></br>  <br>Well, um, fair enough.</br>  <br>Supposedly you shouldn't use sentence on the front as sometimes you will connect meaning and reading to the sentence instead of to the word and then you'll be fucked when this word is used in a different sentence.</br>  <br>This can be true, yes. It's important to check whether front-side sentences are damaging your recognition skills.</br>  <br><br>install Meiryo<br>Heck, should be part of your computer if it's vista or win7</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't actually read the sentence the vast majority of the time. I have it there, well, as an option, but also because the word in the reading is often a different tense to the word up top, so glancing just at the bolded part of the sentence and also at the word gives me 2 different tenses of the word, which I find is pretty helpful.</br>  <br>Oh, and I don't use the audio from the example sentence there.</br>  <br>The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said.

They haven't even done the Confessional arc.</br>  It's on  NEW OP  <br>Fuck, I'm going to miss DAY BY DAY BY DAY BY DAY.</br>  Good OP  I noticed a couple of arcs. Shinigami Arc, Confessional Arc, Body Swap Arc or whatever it's called, and I can't remember anymore.      <br> Hinowa &gt; Tsukuyo <br><br><br><br>Which previous OP would you liken it to?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd say it's closest to that one the Thorny Arc was in. I forget what it's called. It also vaguely reminds me of the Elevator one during the Renho Arc,</br>    Sadaharu ED  NEW ED<br> Don't like it so far <br>Sadaharu ED though</br></br>  Shinigami Arc Next Episode!  One hour until subs.  Ok Shinigami Arc confirmed  Didn't watch the livewatch. How's the pacing for this episode?  <br><br>shit that was fast</br></br>  <br>Well the fujoshi are gonna be happy for that one...<br><br>Love Potion arc when?</br></br></br>  <br>I get the feeling they're counting on going until they can't any further. Like when they're dangerously close to catching up.</br>  Anybody got any torrents for the new episode?  <br>should be up in about 8 minutes</br>   [HorribleSubs] Gintama - 278 [720p].mkv <br><br>OUT!</br></br>  1080p up too  <br>also the mutsu past arc</br>  <br>Why does nobody ever make threads about Gintama? have I missed them all this entire past season?<br><br>I mean I've seen a few ones but nothing different from when it didn't have anime airing</br></br></br>  <br>We have at least weekly threads for the new episode/new chapter</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure we've had at least one thread up every week since the new season started. Two if the original one doesn't last until the new chapter comes out with some additional occasional threads.<br><br>Do we need any more than that? The threads we do get usually turn out with the same posts as the ones before it. There's not a whole lot to talk about.</br></br></br>  am I gay for looking forward to the gintoki being tortured scene      <br>the train has started nothing can stop it now anon</br>  <br> mfw </br>        <br>does this mean the cockroach ark is confirmed</br>      so how was the episode? haven't seen it yet, was it paced well?      <br>The train has stopped.<br><br> Just look at this handsome, based motherfucker, this is fucking Big Boss level. If Otae wont start sucking his dick first moment she see him then i dont know what is wrong with her </br></br></br>    <br> panties hitting the floor at light speed </br>    <br>mutsu is a  cutie </br>    <br>A lot of things in the OP</br>          <br>Tsukuyo is the best.</br>  <br>I shouldn't cry<br>Because now<br>I have to laugh his share too ;_;</br></br></br>    Can I watch the movie if I'm only 70 eps into S1? Or should I rather wait  <br>Wait until you're around the 250 mark.</br>      <br>Honestly, no. You won't appreciate it if you're not up to around ep250</br>  <br><br>All right I'll wait, cheers</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>She truly is the best.</br></br></br></br>      <br><br><br><br><br><br><br> tsukuyo cumdumbster </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Pregnant  Kagura  <br>Stop.</br>  <br>Hijikata a shit.</br>  <br>Reminder Tsukuyo is a virgin.</br>   Kagura has two dads <br> Seita has two moms <br><br>Pottery.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, fujo. You post this in every thread.<br>https://archive.moe/_/search/image/<wbr>FBwuUHWChuSmcLIr2Pbx0Q/</wbr></br></br>  <br>I do.</br>    <br>Man, that guy really doesn't like Tsukuyo.</br>      <br>when was the last time we saw them?</br>  <br><br>I am very surprised they showed up in the ending for no reason. We saw the hostess sister in the Ryugujo arc, but the other one was last seen in the episode where the hostess sister is having a competition with Tae. That's about it.</br></br>    I want DE DE DESTINY back.        <br>He also bash every other girls. Even Tama, Kagura, and Pinko.</br>  <br>I can honestly say that at least 5 of them arent from me. Good to see other people having such a good taste.</br>  <br>Can't be worst that Otae Hater</br>  Toriko?  <br>You mean shit taste.</br>  <br>There's quite a bit of Tae hate, but the Tsukuyo haters are really annoying.</br>  Love Potion arc can't come soon enough.  Finally a serious arc next week.<br>Is it good ?</br>  <br>It's short, but decent. Serves as very important foreshadowing for the previous arc in the manga.</br>  Only read the manga from the love potion arc. Is there any serious arcs before that?  <br>I don't really like it. I prefer Excalibur arc.</br>  <br>It's basically like the benizakura ark with less action and with more gintoki past</br>  That may have only been one chapter, but the pacing was fine, better than last week even.  <br>best fight scene in the whole series</br>  <br><br>Great, I love me some more gintoki past</br></br>  <br><br><br>Otae is fine because she is Kondo only. Tsukuyo is edo period bycicle.</br></br></br>  <br> otae is fine <br>opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>I didn't notice Ikumatsu. I guess they're condensing that into one episode.</br>  <br>But Tsukuyo is only paired with Gintoki and is still a virgin. She scarred herself and got trained as a ninja while still a child.</br>  <br> excalibur <br> serious <br><br>So in the OP we have Amnesia, Body switch, Shinigami, Mutsu's past. No idols, excalibur, or Afros.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Body switch is literally shit. Looking forward to the rest though, especially Mutsu's past.</br>  <br>we also have shogun  ;_; </br>  <br>Amnesia is probably the funniest unadapted arc. Really can't wait.</br>  New OP was better than the last one.  How many episodes should this next arc have?  Still waiting for a hype episode.  <br>I miss DAY BY DAY.</br>  <br> no Afurou <br><br>Why are they so cruel ?</br></br></br>  <br>That's Amnesia anon</br>  <br>There are no monkeys either</br>  I am getting blue balls from all this Tsukuyo and Gintoki shipping that goes on in the show. Will this fucker just pair them up and get it over with?  whoreson was an unbearable episode, not funny at all. and he is not even her real son. she can't save her soul, nobody can  <br>Gin wouldnt go for used goods.</br>  Shit episode.  <br> implying it's not the contrary <br>gin IS the used goods.<br>Tsukuyo is a virgin</br></br></br>  <br> gin IS the used goods. <br>Can't remember it being hinted that Gin isn't a virgin.</br></br>  <br>I think Sorachi will end the series without pairing anybody off, probably with the Yorozuya going out on a job, leaving everything else open.<br><br>I do want them to get together, but I don't think it'll happen in the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>One of the weaker ones for sure, but they adapted it well. I enjoyed it.</br>  <br>let's just hope for that</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VcW<wbr>AQ5a1NdI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>It's shown several times he goes to brothels before. He also seems to deliberately avoid having sex with girls he know.</br>  <br>sup</br>  <br>First of all, he fucked Madao. And you can see him going to a brothel in the Kuronoko arc for example.</br>  Summer 2015 anime season begins in a couple of hours. What are you hype for?  Is mahou org dead for good?  <br>I'm nervous about Ushio and Tora.

This is the same reason I get more annoyed when CR does bad translations than when a group does one of equal quality. The more someone expects to get for doing something, the higher the standards I'll hold them to.</br>  <br>It's gonna drop this week anon, as easy as using google.</br>  <br>How else are you going to represent the pronounless Katze?</br>  <br>That synopsis sounds like some kind of new age philosophy</br>  I just finished S1. Do people really like Hajime? It's hard to believe. She was the worst part of the show for me.  SOMEBODY GET THIS HOTHEAD OUTTA HERE  <br>So you tolerate the piss poor English and the Batman memes because no one else will do it?</br>  <br>I like her. My favorite is O.D though</br>  <br>I'm torrenting as we speak, so I don't know.</br>  <br>I didn't really like her but she was interesting as MC, definitely "different."<br><br>Her body was pure sex though.</br></br></br>  <br>O.D. is my favorite too. But I just don't get Hajime's appeal outside of her looks. like  says. Plus I'll agree she's different. they could have gone with the safe route of having the newbie be an audience surrogate with no personality. <br><br>I just find her voice and near autistic genkiness at all times annoying, especially in ep 10-11 when the city is burning down and she just walks around happy as shit and repeating phrases to herself. The biggest gripe for me is that she's literally never wrong, no matter how retarded her ideas.</br></br></br>  <br>Be sure to watch 12's Director Cut if you haven't</br>  <br>Why do all the kids' shirts say "fujo"? Are there schools for that?!</br>  <br>It says fuji.</br>    Oh shit, I didn't even know it got an OVA and I haven't watched the Director's Cut for the final episode of last season yet either. Based  <br>Fuck those faggots for delaying the real chapter for a few days. Fuck them for also taking so long to release any chapter.</br>  <br>Why would you slice a Crowds before throwing him out of a plane?</br>  <br> last updated 26th April <br>It can't be helped.</br></br>  Crowds are still creepy as fuck, man.  <br> Crowds are just a manifestation of your soul <br> There's a crowds inside all of us. </br></br>  <br>Hajime's not alien to the sense of urgency and concern that assaults other characters, she just believes there's no gain on getting worked up about things and i think that's her appeal. She's mostly a vehicle for everyone's else character development though.</br>  <br>I really want to get one....</br>  <br>No, but it would be extremely humiliating. (as if wearing that shit in public wasn't enough already)</br>  <br>I hated her at first but then I grew indifferent to the point where I don't find her annoying. I like most of the other characters.</br>  <br>Its like how when Katze is really starting to get its shit going she says<br> this is something that can't just be turned off <br>contrasting with pic related and her general stance of being unaffected by other's actions</br></br></br>  <br>that`s a gay looking bane you got there.</br>  Hajime walks the talk, she isn't impervious to harm, nor is she always right. But she is portrayed as immune to the personal baggage and psychodrama the other gatchaman bring to the organization. She's a revitaizing example for them.  <br><br>She's probably going to get into drama with Katze this season tho.</br></br>  <br>VAPE?</br>  Tell me about VAPE! Why does he wear the mask?!<br><br>Lotta loyalty for a hired YACK!</br></br>  The mask reminded me more the guy from Mad Max more than Bane. Why the fuck is /tv/ shitposting so strong? it wasn't this bad in the past  <br><br>Perhaps he's wondering why you'd henshin a Hajime before throwing her out of a plane.</br></br>  <br> it wasn't this bad in the past <br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAAHAHHAAHHAHAHH<wbr>AHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>It kind of hit critical mass when /tv/'s baneposts caused a real-life airplane disaster.</br></br>  <br>You're posting in a meme show who gets memesubs, who the fuck do you think you are to complain about this? Someone get this hothead outta here.</br>  <br>JUST</br>  ITT: Post your favourite opening and ending credits from any anime.<br><br>Going to start us off with a classic.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3Lu<wbr>cBfR1w6Y</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=o0F<wbr>RxIJ0svw</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wkJ<wbr>TsR-KhrM</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ukd<wbr>bbMMjpT8</wbr>  [ ]  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ALo<wbr>W0ECm5UQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Lfc<wbr>zlKJo8Zo</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aYO<wbr>11eE3Uq4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Lws<wbr>zEzrN7OY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jwy<wbr>Iw0hpE5U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What's wrong with this image?  <br>Is there any other Uzuki pairing out there? Uzurin is the only one that comes to mind</br>  <br>Funnily enough, the NG manga did show excellent chemistry between Uzuki and Anya, so did the NOMAKE.<br>Probably because of their different but similar goals.</br></br>  <br>Sachiko x P-san's blazer.</br>  <br>Is the only official pairing I know of, should clarify.</br>   Vanishment, this world! </blockquote>]
