I can't speak Nip, but I have a decent amount of practise parsing Google Translate output.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm Ingenium, and I'll defeat you! <br>Fucking.<br>Yes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mmmm all those healthy looking anime waifus.</br></br>  I wonder how many Noumus they have?  Translatorfag standing by. I have to go out for dinner tonight, hopefully the Chinese scans come out when I come back.  <br>They kinda overdid it with the heads.Poor Noumus.</br>  <br>Does Hands's quirk work on Noumos?</br>  <br>since the sternritter villan group which is basically the nazi regime stereotype.<br><br>fucking lamest shit ever. really spells out how bad bleach really is. <br>it just got away with the arrancars because badass death metal demon creatures n shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whats facepalms quirk?</br></br>  <br>nigga they showed it twice</br>  Wheres my boy at Horikoshi?  <br>In general ed.</br>  <br><br>His power is crushing knives with his bare hands?</br></br>  <br>Did you just skip the USJ arc?</br>  <br> wait all day yesterday <br> go to bed early cause fuck it it will be up by then <br> still no scans </br></br></br>  <br>its decaying,but since he was worrying about a certain hand,he may have other quirks maybe with other hands</br>  <br> Go to bed late yesterday; hoped I'd get the scans <br> "Fuck let's sleep it'll be up by tomorrow, i'll read it before work" <br> still no scans <br>I'm so hyped for this chapter and this whole arc</br></br></br></br>  Shit it's been red on ishuhui for 8 hours now...  <br><br><br>Is this what suffering feels like?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was explained by Naomasa Tsukauchi (cop guy, All Might's friend). Shigaraki's quirk is disintegration, he can completely destroy whatever he holds with his own hands (the special U.A. gate that kept out the press, Aizawa's elbow, Stain's knife) <br><br>He protected that hand because he called it 'father' before. That hand means a lot to him. It doesn't have a special quirk of its own: a dead hand can't have a quirk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been following Berserk and HxH for years now, I suffered already but I'm not imune to it yet.</br>  <br>So thats why he's a villain in the same vein of Bakugou, poor motherfuckers cant masturbate.</br>  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>251</wbr>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>Finally.</br></br>  <br>THE 5 MINUTES ARE OVER<br><br>FINALLY</br></br></br>  <br> IIDA LIVES YES.  </br>  <br>Good, man.</br>  <br>Is it too late at night to summon Translatorfag?</br>  <br>We don't know that anon. The hands on his face + the hands all over his body might still hold quirks, we still haven't been informed.<br><br>If the author really does intend to make Facepalm the anti thesis to Deku, then it wouldn't be strange for him to somehow have multiple quirks (in the form of hands).</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Iida's saying some epic shit.<br>What do you think GT and Deku are talking about in the beginning ?</br></br>  <br>Deko has no Quirk<br>Hands has many quriks.<br>its the opposite</br></br></br>  <br/>  Begin the SUMMONING!  <br><br>SPIRAL STAIRCASE</br></br>  <br>To me those hands seem more like an unwillingness to let things go than anything else. <br><br>The way they are positioned on his body gives me this sensation as well. If you look clearly, you can see that they're all positioned in a way that would restrain a person (around his neck, under his arms like how you would lift a toddler, on his arms etc.) <br><br>If they still contain their quirks and they would work in the way you said, it'll need a lot of explanation. To me personally it sounds like nonsense, but we can only wait and see. (Besides, if he had to use multiple quirks at the same time, I reckon he'd become brainless just like Noumu, the body can't take that many quirks and still function perfectly)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Premum vos Translator</br>  <br>People were really expecting him to die ?</br>  <br><br>Maybe to use the quirks he literally has to swap hands?</br></br>  <br><br>Well he will still probably turn to villain, violent vigilante or get crippled, since Deku said that one line in hindsight.</br></br>  <br>The one on his face is the one whose quirk he's using.</br>  <br>He will probably lead to the death of someone else, get expulsed and then go vigilante I think.</br>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>thank you</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127868652 <br>No need to be rude, it was obvious he was going to live even with the pic above, maybe the guys was just excited or something.</br>  <br> replying to shitposters </br>  <br>I forgot what website I was on for a moment sorry.</br>  <br>Looks like Deku is going to fight some Noumu Rip offs. HYPE</br>  Why doesn't anyone realize that Iida will get seriously injured to the point of probably not being a hero anymore but then being helped by gadget girl and her gadgets.  <br>Robocop?</br>  <br>ABRAKA DABRA</br>  <br>For Iida It´s a better route than the Noumu one</br>  <br> It wasn't a single ennemy <br> It was a hero-killer prototype <br> Next arc will be full of Noumu 2.0,3.0 and so on </br></br></br>  <br>Shit got real, really fucking fast.</br>  <br>The series got shittier ever since Aizen became the villain and the fascist Japanese afterlife officers became the heroes</br>  Why does Gran Torino dress like 8-bit Megaman?  <br>BACK IN MY DAY SUPERHEROES HAD STYLE</br>  <br>Translatorfag here.

Is Stain like Villain Batman or something? <br> This city needs a Villain </br></br>  <br> &gt;&gt;But then... <br> &gt;&gt;How...!? <br> &gt;&gt;How can I let this go?? <br>fucking hell u stupid fuck, this is like the rescue park arc all over again</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess he just hates seeing the concept of heroes becoming a mere job.</br></br>  <br><br> &gt;What an eloquent wordsmith of a violent psychopath <br> &gt;That idiot is so mighty epic I can cry <br> &gt;No ordinary idiot can achieve what he did... <br> &gt;? <br> &gt;The fact is, every city he terrorized experienced a visible drop in crimes <br> &gt;One talking head even proclaimed him equivalent to a hero, adding a storming popular controversy to his resume <br> &gt;I get it! Keep the heroes on their toes by eliminating them slacks on the doles.  <br> &gt;A killer who both destroys and refines heroes?  <br> &gt;Very twisted! <br> &gt;I can't stand that guy, boy does he piss me off... <br> &gt;Blackmist, release the Noumous!  <br> &gt;.... <br> &gt;He's not gonna cut me and just walk away <br> &gt;Destruction? I'll take him on!  <br> &gt;We'll have make this a race </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact is, every city he terrorized experienced a visible drop in crimes <br><br>Why would that even happen?</br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;Get ready to be upstaged, big shot! </br></br>  <br> Despair_but_also_a_boner.png </br>  <br> rekt 4 incompetent heroes <br> replace with more competent heroes <br> ???? <br> profit </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The dialogue seems to imply that the remaining heroes are of a higher quality, but thinking about it it's more likely that the villains are just shitting themselves in fear because there's a guy outside who has no problem with murdering them.</br></br>  I'm hoping that the hand he has in his face is just a decoration/part of his villian costume, and that when he takes it off, he gets an extra power.  <br>The heroes step up their game in response to the attacks, also maybe some criminals piss their pants and lay low.</br>  <br>Most likely it's like a cop getting killed. The other cops work overtime to show that shit like that isn't acceptable.</br>  <br>It's his father's.</br>  <br><br>What are they supposed to do when they run out of heroes? If there is an effect, why would it be so local? Surely if Stain has an effect, it should be in the general hero population, not in just one place.<br><br>Bah, I hate it when a story justifies some evil dumb plan with a hand-wave like this.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Release the Noumous <br>Oh boy here we go</br></br></br>  <br>when heroes get rekt by Stain, the living ones decide that it's best to become crazy good at fighting or something in order to survive. like, when Stain's in the area heroes are more on guard and smarter so they don't die, and this inadvertently causes them to become better heroes in general.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127872316 <br>No picture?</br>  <br><br>oops, my bad<br><br> &gt;It'll be nightfall by the time we arrive, will that be alright? <br> &gt;The later the better! <br> &gt;More crimes happen at night, more exhilarating for us <br> &gt;I'm not sure if I agree with the second part... <br> &gt;Taking out your cellphones already!

Red&gt;green&gt;orange<br><br>Team RED</br></br>  C.C. has always been the best.  <br>Left&gt;Middle&gt;&gt;&gt;Right<br>C.C. is still great but Kallen is superior.</br></br>  <br>Kallen.</br>  Sumeragi.  when do we get our alternate dimension geass where kallen and CC have a sexy contract and the super-dimensional space fortress lelouch shows up asking for a cup of water?  <br><br><br><br><br>Kallencuckfags detected. <br><br><br>Pizza butt is superior.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Suzaku chasing after him across dimensions and fucking up all his water supplies for muh Euphy out of sheer force of will or something?

Pretty meh first episode and i dont like the character designs.  <br>They had nothing to do with what happened in the first episode. It was all original for the anime.</br>  starting faggots  It's started.<br>OP was edgy.</br>     Completely ignoring the source material   ded maid  <br>It's like 50 percent new 50 percent source.<br><br><br>But she survives.</br></br></br></br>    <br>yes</br>  Hey kid wanna /ss/  <br>It was pretty much fucked the moment they decided to give Ibuki that shitty edgy ability</br>  Nice %   Silver Link is doing this shit instead of focusing on Ilya   Dem ED  Well that was shit.<br>This is probably up there as one of the worst this season.</br>   Same sword clashing sound effects as UBW <br>Anyone else notice this?</br>  Well at least it was better than the first episode, not like that was much of a feat in the first place.<br><br>Gen's character is probably the one that's going to keep me watching this.<br>Picked up until the end of the season, I guess.</br></br></br>  If the first one was 3/10 this was 6/10.<br><br>Well, it was indeed better, but they fucked up by adding all this edgy original stuff that it doesn't serve any purpose. At least spider chick is dead.<br><br><br>Gen, Nasu and Narita's characters are indeed the best part.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want to stick my dick in Urobutcher's booby hole</br></br>  <br><br>What happened in the original?</br></br>    OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>xe5yj</wbr>  Seriously, why is it so hard for screenwriters to faithfully adapt something instead of fucking things up with their stupid ideas?  <br>Let's see...<br><br>Kouran/Huanglan wasn't specially evil, Nil Kamui wasn't being invaded but it was a buffer state between Kouran and D'natia, Ibuki did not had any edgy powerup that involved killing friends, Ibuki and Eiha were members of the Revolutionary Army from the start...<br><br>Lots of stuff really. All the wrong and edgy stuff is anime original.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Ibuki could still summon red dragons power without any cost?</br>      <br>He had spiritual powers due to being from the imperial lineage and was able to manipulate the mana streams.<br><br>Still, the main fighters were Swallow and Lou.</br></br></br>  <br> Ibuki and Eiha were already in the Rebel Army from the very beginning and were trying to talk with the Red Dragon and calm it from its insanity. It goes wrong and almost all the Rebel Army unit gets wiped, but Eiha revives because Nill Kamui is odd and its known as the land where the dead come back. <br> Also, Kouran wasn't evil chinese empire and the situation between Kouran and D'natia was a cold war with Nill Kamui being a buffer state. <br> Then the parliament of Nill Kamui and both countries decides to create a multi-country unit to solve the problem with the Red Dragon. That's the party. </br></br></br>  <br><br>I was fine with the loli but this is too much.</br></br>  Oh man I love this hilarious sacrifice your allies for overwhelming power bullshit.<br>It reminds of that one time when I played with a fucking necromancer in a D&amp;D campaign. All the characters the DM introduced to get us on track always ended up dying and becoming soul fodder for the necrobro. <br><br>Looks like I won't drop it. Too good.</br></br></br>  <br>They are killing off irrelevant and original anime characters, nothing wrong there.</br>  <br><br>Killing shotas is never ok you fucking monster.</br></br>  <br> minigun on Narita <br><br>ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL</br></br></br>  <br>It is if they go pass this bullshit and start the actual adventure next episode.</br>  <br>shotas are only exist for sacrifice for the blood god</br>  <br> effective <br> effective <br> unlucky <br> numbers that look like the game system in action <br>Is that what I think it is?</br></br></br></br></br>  I must fuck Urobuchi.  <br>Mainly hyped for EOPs having to wait 5 days again to see it.<br><br>Petty, I know.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, Funi releases it in ten minutes.</br>  <br>I watched the first episode raw and I had a pretty good idea of what was going on. I don't speak Japanese.</br>  Anybody have the nico rating for this episode?  <br>Why? It's pretty crap.</br>  <br>Ibuki is unlucky, Lou is effective and Swallow is critical.<br><br>It makes sense, given how Nasu always rolled critical or botch. He was that extreme.</br></br></br>  EP1 was shit. I'm only watching because I want to see Narita's character. But it will be a miracle if I manage to watch this till the end.  <br><br>It'd be nice if they actually subtly added some of that in there.<br><br>That being said, it might be surprisingly enjoyable once the entire cast can finally get to there shenanigans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully it should pick up once we get past the anime original crap.</br>  <br>If they follow more or less the campaign once the party is complete it would be fun at least.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Chaos Dragon - 02 [720p].mkv   <br>Its fucking awful. Has nice waifus though.</br>  <br>Are there transcripts of the actual game? I wanna see the source material, but as best I can tell that requires me to speak moonrune.</br>  OP and ED were pretty nice.<br>Full version when?</br>  <br><br>They should have go with the first idea they had, that it was making an anime about some people playing a tabletop roleplaying campaign and their antics.</br></br>  ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>xeb9o</wbr>  <br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/3472-Red-Dragon<br><br>Not fully translated though.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Funny how they made her ass look flat and unappealing.<br>This was the last straw, dropped. And it feels good.</br></br>  <br> It makes sense, given how Nasu always rolled critical or botch. He was that extreme. <br><br>As expected of Nasu</br></br></br>  <br>Should have pushed for it. I don't mind what we have now but that's far more novel.</br>  “I am the Bone of my Sword<br>Steel is my Body and Fire is my Blood<br>I have created over a Thousand Blades<br>Unaware of Loss, <br>Nor aware of Gain.<br>Withstood Pain to create Weapons, Waiting for one’s Arrival<br>I have no Regrets. This is the only Path<br>My whole life was Unlimited Blade Works”</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I had a pretty good idea of what was going on. <br><br>I dunno, I'm ambivalent about this. When I was starting with Japanese, I was happy with this too, but nowadays I wouldn't want to watch anything while just doing guesswork.</br></br></br>  Alright how many more died this episode.  <br>Two.</br>  <br>Shota and spider chinese chick.</br>   *39,566位/*39,174位 (***,*43 pt) [*,**0予約] 2015/09/16 ケイオスドラゴン 赤竜戦役 第一夜 Blu-ray 初回生産限定版 (イベントチケット優先販売申込み券付き) <br><br>Well deserved.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but then I watched it subbed and it turned out I was about 98% right.</br>  So who's the girl with the twintails at the end of the OP?  <br> flat and unappealing  <br>That's a fine ass to me. If anything the one in your picture looks off for some reason.</br></br>  I'm starting to like it. Episode three is going to be decider whether I stay with it or not.<br>If it gets better each episode even if it's just marginally, I'll be a happy clam.</br>  Cult turning MC into an edgelord - the anime.  <br>Good question. The Spirit Mother in moster form?<br><br>Probably some original anime bullshit, but it would make sense to be her given she appears with the Red Dragon and the Black Dragon behind.</br></br></br>  <br>The point is that she was a very boyish girl in the original, but they still bothered to give some volume to her ass, making it delicious.<br>In the anime, as expected after the design change into a non erotic clothing, they really didn't want to draw her attractive.</br></br>  <br>Episode 3 is basically the party travelling to the city where Narita is and getting to know each other.</br>  <br>That's probably the case. What night does she appear?</br>  <br>At the very end, but here in the anime they already introduced her. That's probably the best change they made.</br>  <br>Doesn't mean much this early, but I doubt it'll sell more than 1000 BD.</br>  <br>About the general gist of what happened or about the 98% of every single line being spoken? <br><br>Well, you said you don't speak Japanese, so I guess the former.</br></br></br>  <br>No more introductory DRAMA, I presume? Because personally, they could have done without the overdrawn background setting for the shota.<br>This episode was specifically better because they actually showed more of the other main characters instead of just Ibuki.<br>Though that sounds like I'm not going to drop this then.</br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, it only means that it will have a hard time catching fire. And they can't really use shock value either, given they played that card already.</br>  <br><br>I think it'll at most sell 3k, 2k at least for the first volume. We'll see once we're at the halfway point, things could change a lot.</br></br>  <br>If something doesn't happen that would make otaku notice it, this won't even sell 4 digits.<br>This is an original, so it will need some big impact, but I feel like the show doesn't have enough soul to pull it off.<br>For example Sekai Seifuku shot up to top 5 ratings after the first 2 weeks, yet it still only sold 2.7k of first volume.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody dies in episode 3 actually.</br>  <br>brown haired saber?</br>  <br>It's not really an original though.</br>  <br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/works/special<wbr>/reddragon/01/01.html</wbr></br>  <br><br>I though the setting and a few elements of the RPG is more like a pointer for the series, so is this something more of a strict adaptation?<br>In that case I'm sorry.</br></br></br>  Sexualize Ibuki y/n?  <br><br>I dunno what to think of those. OP gets you pumped but is some really generic pop-rock. ED is original and has an interesting construction but it drowns in its awkward piano breaks and it doesn't move the viewer.</br></br>  <br>It is a rather free adaptation of the web transcripts and the published version of those. They are basically telling the same story in those but with a lot of changes here and there, that's why it is Chaos Dragon and not Red Dragon.</br>  So how was the episode?<br><br><br>It's an re imagining of a transcript of a bunch of writers playing an RPG. <br>It's getting a LN released of the new version written by the guy writing this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By the guy who wrote the original campaign and was the Fiction Master actually.</br>  <br>It's getting a bit better now that the other MCs are showing up. Personally, episode four is what'll convince me.</br>   Nobody will ever make a anime out of your tabletop adventure   Now Funi decided to translate only one portion of the entry at the middle of the episode.<br><br>Why they are so bad?</br></br>    <br><br/></br>    New PV<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O7u<wbr>j9Xsb9VY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  haha this kid  <br>His death would be more satisfying that way</br>  <br>/jp/ baby blow the fuck out.</br>  Why is this such a disappointment?  <br>Because you overhyped it in your mind and in pre-air threads with other TM faggots.</br>  <br>to bad there all going to die</br>  Weren't we all just going to post this picture in every Chaos Dragon thread?  <br>Because you somehow expected an adaptation of a bunch of nerds playing make-believe to be good.</br>  <br>The main characters wouldn't die, which are Eihass, meido and urochan</br>    <br>Because unnecesary changes and people thinking this was writtem by Gen, Nasu and Narita when it's not.<br><br>You have to see it as what it is, an adaptation of tabletop RPG campaign with some writers having fun and showing their quirks through their characters.<br><br><br>They are not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  What are the Nicoratings for this episode?  <br>Because you all hype stuff that are "anime original" without actual consideration of the unveiled clues. You are just so deep into the "adaptations are shit" mentality that you lunge at anything remotely new and "entertaining", only to end up disappointed in the end. It's the same shit as the cliché Bahamut shit, who got anyway BTFO by Shirobako in every fucking way.</br>  <br>His change of mind was so fucking idiotic<br> YOU KILLED MAI SISTER/WAIFU <br> NOW KILL ME ;_; </br></br></br>   unnecessary long death scene <br> Chinese spider girls stands still watching the kid dying  <br><br>Who is in charge of the direction?</br></br></br>  Didn't he sacrifice waifu for "power to change the world"? Why does he need to make another sacrifice just to kill some bitch? The dragon isn't playing fair.  <br>The die value wasn't high enough, Aka no Ryuu wasn't satisfied.</br>  So will each ep feature somebody from the cast dying so Ibuki can speak ancient japanese?  <br>He has to make sacrifice every combat</br>  <br> Shirobako <br> Better than based Bahamut <br>You're deluded</br></br></br>  <br>Long death scenes and people just waiting aren't that strange in anime though.</br>  <br>But this is not anime original.</br>  <br>This was particularly bad though.</br>  <br>Bahamut was so fucking cliché and meme, it was just bland.</br>  Fuck all of you haters. I like this,<br>It may not be perfect, but it's far from shit<br>Shit is boring stuff like NNB, that diomedea harem, and TLR</br></br>  <br>Nice shitpost</br>  Super qt.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127831553 <br>Don't expect a child to be logical. Also, he is right in that he killed her.<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127831597 <br>/a/ hyped Red Dragon that this is only following in a really broad way.</br></br></br></br>   Every time he needs the power he has to sacrifice someone close to him. <br><br>This sounds fucking stupid but I'll finish it for the laughs.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127831553 <br><br>I want a doujin of these two getting gangraped.</br></br>  <br>Well, he actually want to go to the Red Dragon and say him that he doesn't want it.<br><br>Also, now he got Swallow and Lou with him so it's not that he needs to fight.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127831553 <br>You can't blame him. He was a big guy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127831597 <br>/a/ hyped it not because they were TMfags, but because it was to be done by a decent studio using interesting source material.<br><br>Nasu, Urobuchi, and Narita DID NOT WRITE THIS. Where does the TMfaggotry come in? Gonna blame SJWs too? And Shills?</br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't he become friends with his enemies and sacrifice them?</br>  <br>If I say yes, will you die?</br>  <br>It will be very painful.</br>  How does Red Dragon even play, compared to say D&amp;D?  <br>Technically, Nasu, Uro and Narita were all part of the writing process. That's what happens as a TTRPG player.</br>  <br><br>So, like, turning Kouran evil is some kind of attempt at historical revisionism where !China are the tyrannical bullies who invade and oppress !Japan and not the other way round?</br></br>  <br>That was so edgy I cut myself while watching it.</br>  Tfw Blonde Guy and Titty Monster are the only good part of this show but they get like no fucking screentime.  <br>Sounds much more interesting than the snoozefest we got in the first ep (didn't watch the second because shit was so bad I'm reconsidering watching the rest). Why can't anime makers do into clever plots?</br>  This doesn't deserve sales.<br><br>MC is such a fucking faggot</br></br>  <br>You are very dedicated</br>  <br>And here, we have some fucktard worthless director that thinks his writing is worth shit compared to everyone's combined manuscript.<br><br>If more waifus were involved, I'm sure he'd be stabbed by some otaku and found dead in a ditch by now.</br></br></br>  <br>Second one was better. And by the third by should reach the place were this begins to look a bit more like the original trancript.</br>  Ibuki is single handily killing this show.<br><br>He looks absurd and his plot is so fucking ridiculous</br></br>  <br>The changes were approved by everyone involved with the TTRPG sessions, you edgelord<br>For what reason? Who knows</br></br>  <br>Jesus christ this shit is fucking awful, the childish designs plus a really out of place VA make this a really retarded shit. Seriously this is like a mix of Moeshit and Edginess with a shitty and retarded story.<br><br>Seems like this is the Triage X of the season because is fucking terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>God knows why they decided to makes unlikeable shota who is not even popular in the original campain into the anime MC.</br>  <br>Oh for fucks sake, you have no idea what goes into a full campaign of a TTRPG, do you? Collaborative storytelling is the fucking reason they exist.</br>  <br>Because MUH MC MUST BE BLAND AND DULL</br>  <br>What happen to her hand? Is she doll or artificial human?</br>  What does /a/ think of the OP and ED?  <br>I was referring to the anime.<br>No need to blow your shit.</br></br>  <br>Fucking trash, actually the whole show is fucking nothing but a piece of shit.</br>  Are Gen and Nasu in this new episode much? What do people think of them so far?  This edginess is killing the show for me, not only the MC is boring as fuck but all these one-hit power ups are ridiculous.  <br>They are the best part of the show.</br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br><br>This reminds me of GxS though it was way better implemented there.</br></br>  Holy shit this show is awful<br> But I'm going to watch it anyway  </br>  Edge was too much for me so won't bother picking up this second episode.  "Can you give me the power to save her?"<br>"Yeah."<br>"Ok, let's do this."<br>"You gotta kill her to get the power."<br><br>I think I'll pass.</br></br></br></br></br>  Everybody is kinda passing over something very importatnt<br>it looks like shit, both in designand animation</br>  <br> What is love? </br>  <br>Fucking dropped this shit after ep 2.</br>  <br><br>I don't really care about either if the show is good. This one though, ain't.</br></br>  <br>I dropped it after ten minutes in ep.1<br>it was unbearable</br></br>  <br>The animation took a step up comapred to the stills in episode 1 though.</br>  <br>They missed an opportunity. Mc should have gone "dragon cheated me. screw the country. my quest is not to get revenge on the dragon."</br>  <br>They managed to fuck up both her arms, neat.</br>  Ibuki is love. Ibuki is life.  What is this? An anime showing Nips kicking chink ass?  <br>They should have played the scene where she gets knocked out of the orphanage after the dragon accepts the contract instantly, it would have at least handwaved away why she's not immediately charging at them</br>  <br>His whole character is pretty much "please no fighting", I don't think it'd make sense for them to go down that route. Though it would make things slightly more interesting.</br>  <br>An anime about a Japanese shota's determination to cockblock the viewer out of seeing the European Knight guy or the crazy chinese Titty Monster</br>  <br>She just seems to be augmented, albeit magically.</br>  <br>They already killed the chinks who were just hilariously evil.</br>    So who roleplayed as who? I hope its not like Nasu roleplayed as Eiha and Butcher as Ibuki. That would be really awkward.  <br>That's it? They don't invade or take revenge?</br>  <br>Ibuki was Shima Drill.<br>Eiha was Kougyoku.<br>Swallow was Nasu.<br>Lou was Gen.<br>Kaguraba was Narita.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In the original campaign, Kouran wasn't even evil nor invading the island. And here it seems that the outright evil ones were spider chick and fat guy as they even had their own agenda.</br>  <br>Yeah but he only has so many friends to sacrifice so it's not like he can do it all the time. They're like bombs in an STG.</br>  That god awful exposition rush.  <br>Why use Funi if you can use DDY?</br>  <br>Does it matter? The series creators placed a fucking info card for the world setting as an eyecatch, because they couldn't be arsed to show, not tell. You'll have to pause either way to get through that wall of text.</br>  <br>It's just an entry to refer to the original being a tabletop rpg campaign. It's an extra.</br>  So the dragonfuck isn't satisfied? <br>Worst dragon of 2015.</br>  <br>IT'S OVER UROBUTCHER IS DONE FOR</br>  <br> UROBUTCHER <br>Did not write this. Nor was his character barely even present in the first two episodes.</br></br>  <br>Ow, that hurts. Even the nips don't really like this show. Looks like the ship is getting abandoned.</br>  I blame the Director for all of this and how poorly it's doing. I imagine if to participants of the game were actually involved directly, the show would be 100% better or at least less shit.  <br>I bet people are getting sick of his name being attached to terrible shows he didn't write that much for.</br>  <br>They should have adapted the original and not try to make anime original shit.</br>  What the fuck? Did they just tell everybody who's going to get sacrificed in the ED?   Whoa... That was a terrible move by our country.  <br>Oh Nasu.</br>  <br>It's a bait &amp; switch. Kind of. Or not really. <br>Full colour equals bonded individuals. <br>Monochromed image equals friends/acquaintances. <br>Crossed out red equals sacrifices. <br>Silhouettes characters not yet met. <br><br><br>Is what it looks like. I highly doubt all the people in that shot are going to be sacrificed. But it probably shows what characters have the potential to be sacrifices.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The best GMPC.</br>  <br><br>Does Ibuki penetrating her mean that she didn't die a virgin?</br></br>  This show is such a retarded traiwreck.  I like it.   <br>That scene was hilarious.</br>  <br>Holy shit, that looks horrendous. Looks like they did some half-assed CGI modelling, then added some PS1-tier texture. I really don't want to watch the episode now.</br>  <br>Gargantia, A.Z and now this.</br>  <br>That's totally a drawing though. There is nothing especially strange there, it is just a spirit.</br>  <br>That's drawn, in motion it is totally obvious.</br>  <br>If there is no proper setup for the edge it just ends up being cringy. This kind of shit should be left to the endgame or something. <br><br><br>Don't forget Gunslinger stratos.</br></br></br></br>  Watching for blonde guy and the maid, are they secretly fucking or not? I need to know this, it's of outmost importance.  <br>Samurai asshole is next. He won't be missed.</br>  <br>She's an educated prostitute.</br>  <br>Spoiler: Everybody except maybe 1 or 2 guys dont die.</br>  <br><br>I like to delude myself into thinking that after Narita gets introduced, the show suddenly shifts into a more meta state and actually adapts the the table top session as well.</br></br>  <br>If it follows the original, only 2 people more there die.</br>  <br>They have a rather unique relationship.<br><br>imgur.com/a/Lgo3w</br></br></br>  Who are the idiots actually expecting anything from this? Literally no one was expecting anything from a story based on a couple of writers playing a TRPG. Did some people just not read the summary or something and are fucking retards?<br><br>The first 2 episodes were mediocre. Should've been from the perspective of the players rather than the game.</br></br>  The fact that they did the whole sacrifice shtick for the first two episodes is going to make everybody watching it think that this is going to have a character die each episode now with Ibuki powering up instead of party shenanigans. That's honestly really hilarious.  <br> Literally no one was expecting anything from a story based on a couple of writers playing a TRPG. <br>Why are you speaking as you as if you are speaking for everyone? <br>As a matter of fact I generally love /tg/ stuff, and truly love TRPGs. <br><br>Seeing a TRPG story replay be adapted to anime intrigues me. And I enjoy it for a numerous number of reasons, including but not limited to moments like  where the exchange between GM and players shine through.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whoever came with that stupid idea should be ashamed.</br>  <br>But anon, it's the dice's fault. And it's worse than mediocre.</br>  <br>He was the best thing this episode.</br>  <br><br>This could have started off decently if they didn't waste the first two episodes with Ibuki hogging all the screentime instead of giving it equally to the entire cast. The first episode was undoubtedly shit, this one is now around below average.<br><br>Will the show get even better after this? Probably. Sure. There's really no other way but up.</br></br></br></br>    So If the blonde guy breaks whatever he touches, how does he masturbate?  <br>Because the material was decent and totally serviceable. It could have been a modernized Lodoss instead of the mess we've got.</br>  <br>I bet that one time he masturbated was great</br>  Hate seems overexaggerated. It wasn't anything supremely bad to the point that it offended me, just a healthy average.<br><br>The first two 'deaths' were obviously just background establishment for the white haired shota, I didn't really see it as a LOLDRAMA EDGY shock factor shit.</br></br>  <br> releases its full power <br> I wonder what that feels like </br></br>  <br> Breaks every weapon he touches  <br>Did you even watch it?</br></br>  This has the potential the be one of the shittiest anime on my list of things I should have dropped, but never did.  <br>Are you implying his penis is not a weapon?</br>  <br>Talking's a free action, pal.</br>  I hope Ibuki's OC donut steel fucks off and we get some actually tabletop RPG stuff instead of MUH CHOSEN ONE circlejerk.<br>That shit ruins sessions.</br>  <br><br>It is actually every tool he touches.<br><br>In the original he was indeed secretly afraid that it would end affecting human beings so he avoided touching important people for him like Meryll.<br><br>But in the original his hands very fucking black and hideous.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His maid isn't a tool for him?</br>  <br>Given that he considers her as the truly capable one compared to him, not really.<br><br>They are truly bonded for life also.</br></br></br>  <br> With Meryll: <br> Swallow does his utmost best to avoid having to rely on Meryll. <br> So Meryll, laying bare her soul in a moment of unguardedness, asks him. <br> "Why do you not rely more upon me, Master?" <br> "Because I know you can do everything and do it well, too well. I feel like I'll become a good-for-nothing if I depend on you too much." <br> "I thought you already were, Master Swallow. Are you saying there is worse in this world?" <br> Meryll is someone special to Swallow, but he makes a point of pushing it aside. Precisely because he wishes for her to lead a life of happiness, he is convinced that he mustn't get too involved with her. <br> "She is the most important woman in my life so far. But surely that's no reason for me to look after her?" <br> I suppose he's a pretty big jerk in what he says and does after all. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are clothes not tools?<br>How is he not naked?</br></br>  <br>Well, I suppose he needs to hold it in his hands for the curse to make its effect.<br><br>Also, probably Meryll is the one who dresses him.</br></br></br>  <br>What else does she do for him?</br>  <br>Almost everything. His family is in bankrupt due to a scam and how carekess he is about his curse and now he is indebted to Meryll because her company is the one handling that.</br>  <br>I mean... What else does she do for him, personally?</br>  <br>Their romantic story is quite unique and strange, and they can't seem to be able to advance to that point because some factors explained here  (and that would be probably shown in the anime too).<br><br>They are still bonded for all their lives and are obviously OTP.</br></br></br>  <br>You must not have seen DDY's version in episode 1.</br>  <br><br>this kill counter is gonna make it way hard to actually get invested in any of these characters</br></br>  <br>It's not really a kill count.</br>  Does anyone know what the numbers in the OP mean? Are they dice rolls or something?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> forced to tribute another friend  <br><br>AGAIN!?</br></br></br>    <br>They were a loli and a shota<br>/a/ praises lolis and shotas like gods<br>So of course they're gonna go on hatefits when one dies. <br>I also saw the deaths as a way of establishing why the dude who has a contract with the red dragon would want to join the party to find and presumably kill the dragon.<br>The first death was to introduce the fact that the dragon needs sacrifices for the power<br>The second one to have Ibuki learn it works at a rate of a sacrifice each time he wants the power.<br>Also, people complaining about the anime having Ibuki kill one person each episode for his power just from these two are idiots. <br>The sacrifices need to be people Ibuki cares about.<br>He just joined a party of people he doesn't know, and is leaving the rest of the orphans behind.<br>There won't be suitable sacrifices near Ibuki anymore</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Soon™  Wait, so which character is whose?  Psychotic Sayaka Ohara characters are the best.  <br>See </br>  <br>Can't believe I went through the thread twice and still missed it. Thanks.</br>  This anime is reminding me of something  <br>I never finished that game. I was trying to keep every member alive, but then I just stopped playing games altogether. Pretty sure I was more than halfway through it, it was a fun game.</br>  <br> I was trying to keep every member alive <br>On your first run? Because that's actually kinda hard. Remember trying to do that myself but the game likes to through bullshit your way to force you to use the plume. Particularly the Overkill/Sin System.<br>Didn't meet your Sin quota for the mission? Next Mission your doppelganger pops up and wrecks your party.</br></br></br>  <br>12 people for 12 episodes<br><br>thanks butcher</br></br></br>  <br>In episode 3 nobody dies.<br><br>And only two more of that list will die actually. Maybe three.</br></br></br>  I'm so fucking mad.<br><br>The OST is great and arguably it has a good premise. I was even hyped for the protag to be shota of the year.<br><br>But jesus, what hole in North Korea is the animation studio located? Watching some low budget 1cour from 2003 is really ruining everything for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I assumed that if Eiha or her doggy die then they both die</br>  <br> Le Chaos Dragon has bad animation meme <br>No, it doesn't you fuck<br>If you think it does, you haven't seen real bad animation</br></br></br>  <br> I played on an emulator and abused save states like crazy. That's probably part of the reason it felt like a hassle to get back into, it's too much of a pain. </br>  <br>    abusing save states <br> That's me whenever playing a TRPG, too. </br></br>  Best OP of the season by far.  <br>That's not Exterminate.</br>  <br>Yes there is heavy use of CGI involved. But it plays it very well to the strengths of CGI and dynamic use of the camera. <br>That is actually very good. And something you rarely see in TV anime.</br></br>  <br> Best girl dies in the first episode <br><br>Why even bother?</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay, she wanted it and now Ibuki gets to hang with an animal-eared girl who has a giant blind winged dog attached to her butt, a seductive murderous psychopath, and a serious-business maid.</br>  <br> I highly doubt they'll last the next 4 episodes </br>  The exposition in this episode is hilarious. Somehow the blonde dude "forgets" that his country was involved in a huge war that resulted in the death of the other country's king, so his maid explains it in full. They aren't even trying.  <br>Unless the anime goes full-original rather than just halfway they should live to the end.  Well, not Lou, but her situation becomes rather special. <br><br><br>It was just the GMPC expositing to the players.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey man, sometimes you just forget the shit that caused basically every event in your life.<br><br>I bet Israeli soldiers after fighting some Palestinians ask themselves "wait...what am I doing again?" All the time.</br></br></br>  <br> Somehow the blonde dude "forgets" <br>Standard NPC dialogue GM introduced to remind the players what the story was about. Come on, anon. you know how this works.</br></br>  <br>Natsumi Kon &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shitsuki "past her prime" nana</br>  <br>That anon is fucking entitled he actually expected the players to read the setting's backstory.</br>  <br>Anon, Swallow is an idiot, like really a big idiot, he really doesn't know better. <br> <br>Plus we know that was for the benefit of the viewers more than the characters. </br> </br></br>  <br>Eiha is delicious, the anime actually made her appealing unlike the shitty original design. Based Silver Link improving the source material.</br>  Archer?   <br>She looks like shit compared to her old tomboy look.</br>  This show is pretty generic for being nasu and urobutcher.<br><br>also what the fuck was up with those bells on the haughty's bitch's ass? i was trying to wrap my head around those stupid leggings.</br></br>  Where were you when Ibuki x Eiha OTP was confirmed?  <br>What the fucking shit is the point of this series?<br><br>I just got done watching the first 2 episodes and this premise is retarded as fuck.<br><br>The whole series revolves around sacrifice but whats the POINT if none of these have any emotional weight to them? The MC's closest friends been killed so fast that we didn't even have time to learn anything about these characters, or grow to like them, those things that make character deaths worth while? It can't even count as shock value at that point.<br><br>Not only that but due to the fact that the MC's OP OHKO NEEDS to have a sacrifice, and we have a death counter it kills literally all the tension and suspense because you KNOW all these characters are going to die EVENTUALLY. The most they can do is bait and switch one character death for another, even then said character will probably just die later.<br><br>It may as well just be the Shrike Team from Gundam Victory. You know all of them are going to die so their eventual deaths hold no value or surprise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Details of the source material were changed to add drama and emo crap.<br><br>Like how the whole sacrifice for OHKO thing didn't exist and how the two friends who died weren't even in the source material at all.<br><br>The reason they lack emotional impact is that they were tacked onto the background specifically so they could be killed off almost immediately.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't fucking get it. Why change it in the first place? The concept of small time islanders getting caught between the fights of two bigger powers is actually interesting. Why did they have to edgify it?<br><br> The reason they lack emotional impact is that they were tacked onto the background specifically so they could be killed off almost immediately. <br>This is fucking stupid. Don't treat shit like this as a huge deal when its obvious to anyone with half a brain who is going to die. Especially now that the filler background characters are gone it'll eventually get to the main cast.</br></br></br></br>   https://archive.moe/a/thread/12491<wbr>7592/#124919884</wbr> <br> This is made by the same people who created the campaign for the TRPG in the first place. The changes are just to make it a little different, they compared it to something like the Records of the Three Kingdoms compared to the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. <br><br>Apparently this is what they had in mind.</br></br></br>  So is there a non-butchered manga version out there or is it LN only?  <br>Pretty sure there's an event book they actually played the game</br>  <br>Original:<br>http://sai-zen-sen.jp/special/reddr<wbr>agon/<br><br>Partial translation:<br>http://forums.nrvnqsr.com/showthrea<wbr>d.php/3472-Red-Dragon</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Whats all this shit you people are saying about this being a ttrpg?  <br> LN <br>I'll pass<br><br>If I wanted to read a book I'd read a book<br><br> Fuck books </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>worst anime</br>  <br> LN <br>Anon, those are the transcripts of the RPG sessions.</br></br>   Swallow's ability is the power to make Excaliblasts out of any weapon <br>NASUUUU</br>   Ibuki has the same ability as that fucking edgy manga that has the MC jack levels from his partners.  <br><br>Le why.

Like, totally polarizing opinions even. You either totally shit on it, remain indifferent and find it barely passable, or fairly like it.<br><br>Shit's crazy.

Eykha <br> Sweallow <br><br>No way those are the official names, right?</br></br></br>  It feels like more and more, Anime are getting Urobuchi to write a tiny amount of a show so they can plaster his name all over it to make it insta sell, but it's creating a fuckton of anime with really mismatched writing styles and it's going to ruin whatever reputation Urobuchi has built up eventually and stop working. I hope studios stop this shit.  <br>It's actually some conceptual nonsense about how he causes the tool to fulfill its entire lifetime's worth of purpose in a single action.</br>  <br> can't live past age 15 <br> ;_; </br></br>  The OP is as edgy as I thought it'd be.<br><br>And I like it</br></br>  <br>The edgy ability needs the sacrifice to be someone dear to the MC. <br>Something that none of the main cast are, because he just met them<br>So, what you say is retarded and not gonna happen. <br>But I guess it's easier to complain like a retard</br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people are mad that there are changes (Even though the people involved with the TTRPG sessions approved those changes)<br>Then there are shotafags and lolifags mad about the deaths, and retards who find them "edgy" or "forced" (pure empty buzzowords, both of them)<br>And some retards think that Narita, Nasu and Urobuchi are actually writing this, when they just played Kaguraba, Swallow, and Lou respectively in the source<br>And then there are the "muh animation" shitposters falsely claiming the animation to be shit</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>dropped</br></br>  <br>What about that made you drop it?</br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/people.php?id=103231<br>Has done episode direction ONCE before this, and Wooser is just a short flash animation.</br></wbr></br>  <br>The OP has too much episode footage for my liking, hopefully they will release a complete version later.<br><br>ED on the other hand is pretty sweet with lots of animated scenes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>What's the point of all this if Ibuki isn't a shota?</br></br>  <br>It would be extremely awkward to be friends with him.<br><br> Oh look, if that bloody god sacrifice shota, I-I'm gonna say hi to him! </br></br></br>  <br>I doubt we'll see adult Ibuki in the show</br>  <br> Urobutcher and Nasu <br>That explains why it's so shit</br></br>  <br>That's characterization too.

First impressions man. They stick deep.</br></br>  <br> dice rolls and hints of the ttrpg seeping through <br> Narita with a drill and minigun <br> inevitable ADVENTURE <br>Oh man. I'm really giving this shit a chance.<br><br>I hope it gets genuinely good once the party assembles.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The very opening scene was fantastic though including just about everything barring the actual dragon that ultimately just took up a small portion of the opening scene. <br>Aside from that just about the only really poorly animated parts were of the mooks fighting. But if that's what sticks in your mind and not everything else then there is probably something more wrong with you than with the animation at large.</br></br>  <br><br>Hey I'm not one of the guys who think it's shit. Just explaining why it's probably so.</br></br>  <br>Will there be "rape the maids" in this show?</br>  <br>It is.<br> About the curse of pulverization: <br> A special skill possessed by Swallow. <br> Though it triples the effects of what he uses, the tools/weapons are unable to withstand the energy and break. <br> In appearance it is no different from other Reinforcement skills. <br><br> About the curse of pulverization (truth): <br> &gt;The curse that destroys any tool in a single use.<br> The more intricate, the more elaborate something is, the more easily it breaks. <br> Swallow has borne this curse since birth. &gt;Although the curse is known to occasionally manifest in those born to the Cratsvalley, &gt;Swallow's curse surpassed all previous incidents in its destructiveness. <br> In truth, it is the curse not of pulverization but of "consumption." <br> The tools do not break but are "used up." <br> Because of this, with one use the tool expends all of its capacity to perform. It breaks afterwards not because it could not stand the power, but rather because it had "fulfilled its purpose." <br> The Black Dragon calls this "the embodiment of humanity's nature." </br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127825468#p127872636">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I got to say I like her anime design more.<br><br><br>Annoyed, Ibuki doesn't have any of his buff skills though.

Why did they have that paintball battle instead of letting them fight right away? Their personal feud doesn't even have anything to do with kill vs. save issue.  <br>Because they we're about to choke/bludgeon each other to death. Atleast this time they have rules.</br>  <br>Be gentle</br>  <br>Thank you so much anon. You saved me from the regret and disappointment that I would have to face after I've done the deed.</br>  A reminder that Lala has already won.  <br> implying Ms. smith is not the endgame </br>  I was surprised the anime didn't suck.<br>I expected it to but hoped it wouldn't. <br>I knew GATE and Overlord were going to suck and they did. <br>Now all I got to brood on is One Punch Man. <br><br>How long into the series will the anime get before S2 never?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> endgame <br><br>Lala is just chillin' at the afterlife while the others fight for kurusu kimihito, the best girl of all.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to protect that smile.</br>   Reminder Ms. Smith is best Girl.   Reminder that Miia already won and is used goods.  <br> Blue skin <br><br>WHY<br><br>That will make people believe that she's part of a subrace of Demons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lala wins when and after darling's dead.</br></br>   AN A KE   <br>Time for an exorcist.<br><br><br>But Darling is too small to fit in her.<br><br><br>Hold your breath for a long time then die and look at your skin.<br>NIGGA ITS BLUE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When renovating the house, did they just tell the contractors "just build it like an American expat will be living here."?  <br> American expat <br>If the said American expat's from say virgin island and weighs about 400lb, then sure.</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE RACHNEE  <br><br>Maybe they told them to build it for Texan/American Samoan.</br></br>  <br> When renovating the house, did they just tell the contractors "just build it like an American expat will be living here."? <br>Realistically you can just say "build it for a disabled person who had to use a wheelchair everywhere".<br><br>Granted, in real life Japan has really bad disabled access in buildings. So if you need to use a wheelchair your life would be hell. And this explains why the larger monstergirls have problem going to places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a cripple is literally worse than death in Japan, they might as well kill themselves</br>  <br>Japan cannot unto accessibility. <br>Nope, can't have common sense ruin shits and giggles. Large and deep pool is a-ok, but reinforced roofs with proper escalator? Forget about it.</br></br>  Suu?<br>Suu</br>  <br>How fucking cute is she?</br>  <br>It was pretty ok. The animation was distracting because of how static it was. I found that little video game styled bit quiet charming, I'd like to see more of it.</br>  <br>They don't want smelly cripples stinking up their country, so they force them to flee by making everything require stairs.</br>  <br><br>Best girls</br></br>  <br>Rachnee is ultimately responsible for the house collapsing, due to dragging Honey to her rape attic without first disabling everyone else.</br>  <br>This round about deflection of blame from horse pussy</br>  How would Rachnera act during the full moon? She's already the most unambiguous rapist member  Snakes are the cutest.  <br>She'd turn her legs into penises.</br>  <br>Whose fault is it that all the girls in the house went to the attic to protect his virginity?</br>  Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling?<br><br>It's so easy.</br></br>  <br>Because no one will save her from Suu.</br>  <br>not with that pig voice</br>  <br>That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck.</br>  P O L T<br>O<br>L<br>T</br></br></br>  <br>Chuuni ass-fuck doujin when?</br>  <br> Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling? <br>Unlike the other girls, it seems she needs to be in the mood to feel like it. So she doesn't really plan to rape Darling unless the situation presents itself. And in general we know she can't actually fight off ALL the girls in the house.<br><br> Because no one will save her from Suu. <br>Especially Suu, who is essentially her nemesis. Suu is not affected by silk.<br><br><br> That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck. <br>The Lala bio is written by a sceptic who assumes that magic doesn't exist. Note the section that talked about unexplained connections between Dullahan sightings and deaths.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Scene cracks me up every time.</br>  <br>Lala already told darling that she'll be there for him once he's dead for good.</br>  Do you think the VAs are thinking about how weird this shit is to them?    <br>She doesn't have to fight them.<br><br>She simply has to tie them up in her web</br></br></br>  <br>Dat body</br>  <br> that Smith <br>unf</br></br>  <br> She simply has to tie them up in her web <br>Tie up Suu? With spider silk? She is good, but she isn't THAT good.</br></br>  <br>This is the result of that.</br>  <br>Slime best girl.<br>Imagine her covering your dick and churning her slime.</br></br>  <br>Waitafuckingsecond. The anime's airing?<br><br>Fuck, where did the time go!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think  means this, but still the same thing in the end. Everyone else are the only things standing between her and Goo victory.</br></br>  <br>That's like saying Bond was responsible for the firing of Goldeneye because he didn't go back to make sure Alec was dead.</br>  <br>That is why she is not in the anime.</br>  <br>He is. He's a government-sponsored assassin. Failure to kill=poor job performance.</br>  <br>This confuses me to no end. Episode one covered the first two chapters of the manga. However, at that pace, the anime would go straight through to Lala's introduction, yet she doesn't appear in the opening theme. Plus, minor characters like Port and Kii don't show up in any of the themes either, so I have no idea what to think.</br>  <br>They'll be there. Lala's not showing up until the second half of the season at any rate.</br>  <br>Because the entire D arc is a huge spoiler if you're anime-only.</br>  Can somebody explain what are the D's all snakes wear on their heads? <br> inb4 hur durr D worship </br>  <br>I think it's just supposed to be cute hairclips, part of their  D sign.</br>  <br>They're hair clips that resemble snake eyes I think</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he can protect it himself, faggot</br>  <br>It makes them look like snake eyes anon.</br>    Okiku-Mushi when  <br> protect it himself <br>You clearly don't love this decent, earnest and long-suffering fellow. He's been constantly abused, yet his head hang high and his spirit undiminished. <br><br>Scums like you just want to see the flame of hope being snuffed out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to have a daughter and bring her to school with Cerea.</br>  Best girl, can't wait to see that long tongue in anime form  <br>OPPAI LOLI<br><br>HESTIA LIVES IN CENTAUR FORM</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the Cerea bath scene and the full moon episode.</br>   ANN actually liked the first ep <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>  <br>Yes he suffers his small dick(fact) is diamonds all the time, Kimihito can walk off those horse kicks to the head</br>  <br>Every time</br>  Why is Rachnee so cute with all her fangs?  Fucking hell this is boring. Do you guys actually enjoy this garbage?  <br>nnb isn't a very good sol</br>  <br>it's alright</br>  Renge's voice makes me want to kill myself  <br>There is so much wrong with this thread.</br>  <br>AOTY</br>  <br>Goddamn, why does apple insist on keeping the horrible OS X window shaodows even in screenshots.</br>  <br>It's good. Cancerous fan base though.</br>  Welcome to the slice of life genre.<br><br>Please enjoy your complementary nothinghappens.</br></br>  I don't understand it either. The entire time I was watching this shit all I could think about was K-ON. I'm sure you felt the same way.<br><br>The only people who like this are "people" who are too stupid to understand and appreciate the profound impact K-ON had on the world of anime.</br></br>  NNB S1 was a strong contender for AOTS. Confident S2 will be AOTY.  <br>The problem with episode 1 of Restart is that it's still missing best girl (until the very end.)</br>  <br>Pretty sure K-On and NNB have a good amount of fan overlap there, Anon.</br>  <br><br>K-ON is basically the progenitor of content-barren modern SoL.<br><br> The only people who like this are "people" <br><br>Why are there quotes around people? Are you skeptical of their species as Internet users?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, Komari has some scenes in the middle of the episode too.</br>  <br> K-On! <br> Content Barren <br><br>This is what retards actually believe</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me rephrase:<br><br>It's largely lacking in best girls #1 and #2, in some order.</br></br></br>  Because I like watching cute girls be cute and gay together. That's generally why I like SoL like this and GochiUsa. Not cute girls suffering. Not cute girls lusting over some dense faggots dick. Just cute girls being cute. I also like anime like Symphogear. You'll understand once you watch more anime.  <br><br> Why are there quotes around people? Are you skeptical of their species as Internet users? <br><br>An appreciation of K-ON is the fundamental measure of a person's humanity.<br><br> K-ON is basically the progenitor of content-barren modern SoL. <br><br>Did you see the episode where they go to Mugi's beach house and she discovers that, contrary to her wishes, her family stocked the refrigerator with a roast?<br><br>Did you ever contemplate how that affected the Keions' decision to go to the beach?<br><br>No. You probably didn't.<br><br>Yet you have the audacity to call K-ON content barren when it continually dramatizes the human condition, as illustrated above.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Japs have boring lives in general.<br>Wake up, eat, commute, work/study, commute, eat, sleep. It's depicted as a boring, peaceful life in a lot of anime. That's why a girl with some kind of power usually falls from the sky or some shit.</br>  <br>Forces myself to watch three episodes, then dropped that shit.</br>  <br><br> enjoys watching a whole season of pretty girl caricatures putting off band practice to put on dresses and eat sweets. <br><br>You probably have the personality of a foot<br><br><br><br>Well I guess that puts me somewhere between nihilistic psychopath and stubborn autist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will KyoAnusfags realize K-on isn't that good<br>It's not even the best SoL, that title goes to Hidamari Sketch</br>   Hika-nee, denwa!   <br>Whats it like being a shitposter</br>  ITs supposed to heal you<br>So only damaged people can enjoy it</br>  <br>Nyanpasu!</br>  <br>Why does she run like that?</br>  <br>She's autistic</br>  <br>Maybe her feet hurt.</br>  <br>It makes my heart pure</br>  <br>im /functional/ as HECK dude and I love NNB<br><br><br><br><br>Have you ever seen children doing anything before? They're all dumb as hell and run around like apes who have no idea what they're doing<br><br>also she runs that way because  It's cuter </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That is true for anime as a medium<br>Except it never quite "heals" you per se, only acts as a respite from the real world</br></br>  <br>The episode with the roast is good, but it's NOTHING compared to the episode where Mugi wants to eat takoyaki and is unable to. Or Ritsu and Mio having to confront their blatant homosexuality via role reversal in Romeo and Juliet.<br><br>But clearly you need to watch more Non Non Biyori. Take the early season 1 episode where Hotaru tries to dress more maturely to impress her senpai/crush (as pictured upthread) and is mistaken for an older woman. It's a deep exploration of how others interpret the same actions differently based on outside appearances. And you certainly can't reflect how it addresses the unspoken power dynamic in their relationship!<br><br>Enjoying one masterful work of art doesn't mean you have to ignore all others.<br><br>You may also want to check out Yuru Yuri for an examination of rape culture in today's middle schools.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>from what?</br>   muh moeshit <br><br>You can't seriously pretend K-On is good, /a/. I thought this is just a <br>smokescreen to keep normies off your board.<br><br>Call me crazy but I just don't see the appeal of wasting time on anime where literally nothing of importance happens.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then you need to stop watching anime period</br>  <br>Not to mention the exploration of support for those that have gone through trauma in modern society, wherein the audience is thrust into the position of someone unaware of their tragic past, and forced to observe the declining condition of the victim if their subtle cries for help go unnoticed, especially in the series' setting, where the current Japanese popular opinion of support and therapy is that it is "weak" and "shameful".</br>  <br> every anime is boring or has a consequence free plot <br><br>nay, anon</br></br></br>  <br>At least it's better than K-ON.</br>  <br>And how many shows can combine a commentary on the failings of our modern test-focussed education system with the plight of the manual labourer losing his job to machines. Two issues that are deeply linked, but rarely juxtaposed so smoothly.</br>  I love renge's voice<br><br>Holy cancer anon, nice mac<br><br>this is next level bait</br></br></br></br>    <br>How did you do that?</br>  <br><br> Fucking hell this is boring. Do you guys actually enjoy this garbage? <br><br>I feel the same way but I don't want to call it garbage, I wish I could enjoy it. Does it at least picks up after ep2-3? Komari design is just perfect, I wish I could have liked it more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>poor bait, heres your reply</br>  <br>I tried to watch the first episode, it's so fucking slow paced. <br>Does it get better at any point?</br></br>  <br>It is always good you're just a plebian</br>  <br> Fucking hell this is boring.  <br> Do you guys actually enjoy this garbage? <br><br>You are doing it wrong if you watch NNB during daytime.<br><br>You're suppose to watch NNB while on bed every monday nite before you go to sleep.<br><br>Do the above and you'll feel refreshed when you wake up tuesday morning.<br><br>This is the magic of NNB and other shows like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hah that fucking screenshot. If you used VLC instead of mpv it would be a more refined bait.  It took me one year to finish the first season, it's alright  <br> Forces myself to watch three episodes, then dropped that shit. <br><br>NNB is also NOT meant to be marathoned either. Here is the rule of thumb for watching NNB </br></br></br>  Reddit tier SoL for plebs, just watch Aria that in my opinion is the best anime ever created.  <br>It isn't though. I want to like it but I just can't get into it.</br>  <br>Nice shit opinion.</br>   there are people who hate nihilistic toddler <br> there are people who think K-On actually affected anime in any way <br>These are probably Redditors who backed Under the Dog.</br></br>  <br> just watch Aria <br>You literally googled "/a/ reccomended anime" and pulled up the first thing on the list, holy shit.</br></br>  <br><br> Ariafags <br><br>Kill yourself<br><br><br><br>B-but K-On! was the first moeshit and killed anime</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I see this is the containment thread.  <br>The very first episode isn't my favorite either, but if you don't see anything you like in the 2nd episode of the 1st season, it probably isn't for you.</br>  <br> first moe shit <br>GET THE FUCK OFF OF /a/ RIGHT NOW IF YOU DON'T KNOW BASIC ANIME HISTORY.</br></br>  <br>Aria is excellent and is better than NNB but NNB is almost as good as Aria, the ost isn't as god tier (but is still good) and Aria has its own special comfiness that I find more appealing than NNB cozy village<br><br><br>If you don't think K-On! had any impact on anime then you're dumb, heres you're reply</br></br></br></br>  Nah I hate it, I prefer watching cute girl running with toast in her mouth colliding with the MC while he grabs her boobs.<br><br>That's proper anime.</br></br>  <br>Someone needs to post about the themes of Lucky Star. Something something Tsukasa traditional gender roles.<br><br>Eh, no one jumped on my Yuru Yuri rape culture joke and I'm tired. I give up. I'll leave it to K-on-kun.</br></br></br>  <br> If you don't think K-On! had any impact on anime then you're dumb <br>The only thing it "impacted" is KyoAnis art style  and wallets <br><br>Its generic SoL anime, the people that think moe wasn't gestating before K-On need to fuck off back to r/anime, because they don't know shit and will suck off any cock that tells them they're right.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lucky Star, while being both moe and shit, isn't considered moeshit because it's old and vintage, therefore cool to like.</br>  <br>I enjoy Bakemonogatari too so I think it's alright.</br>  SoL is NOT for everyone. You can call this as boring and garbage, but some people will also call this as comfy and relaxing.  <br>And by shit you mean, the good shit like a vintage alcohol.</br>  <br>Remember when ledouche actually liked and talked about this anime? Your shitposting is insufferable</br>  <br> isn't considered moeshit because it's old and vintage, therefore cool to like <br>I know I am being baited. But somehow I can't help but feel that a piece of my frontal lobe is going to burst open and leak out brain cells, slowly dilating myself into the shit eating dumbass you are.<br><br>Congratulations, out of my time being on /a/ since 2007, you are the first person that I hope gets their cock ripped off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only theme is "how to write a script about eating a doughnut for 20 minutes, and then proceed to get fired"</br>  <br>Well, at least you have an okay taste in computer software.</br>  <br> SoL is NOT for everyone. You can call this as boring and garbage, but some people will also call this as comfy and relaxing. <br><br>preach!<br><br>not all anime need not to be laced with crack/cocaine</br></br></br></br></br>  I like Slice of Life. Many of them do very interesting things with their "nothing happens", typically in the setting. I didn't feel Non Non did anything to make it stand out at all and just got bored watching it.  <br>You're watching sol anime, m8.<br>You don't wait for something to happen. You just take it easy.</br></br>  <br>I watch SOL on train from work. Sometimes I watch 2 episodes in a row. What's wrong with me?</br>  <br>You don't own a car.</br>  <br> Lucky Star <br> old and vintage <br>I'm eighteen and it was popular as fuck among the weeaboos in my eighth grade class. Are you like twelve or some shit?</br></br></br>  <br>It would take twice as much time and money to drive across the whole city, leaving me exhausted and with no time to watch SOL.</br>   People who can't appreciate the pure beauty of this first episode of S2 <br> People who don't even understand all the small unobtrusive metaphors used to convey the characters feelings <br> People who have no sense for the aesthetic value of the subtle blend of healing and melancholy in the atmosphere and themes of this show <br> People who, in all seriousness, compare a show as artistic as NNB to the shitstain that is K-On. <br><br>Could all you plebs please leave the NNB threads and don't come back at least until the anime is over?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's Restart?</br>  <br>Komari had some scenes, what are you talking about?</br>  <br> 2deep4u <br>Here's your reply.</br></br>  It's a nice show. Not the best, but still above average.<br>The fanbase is really what makes it near intolerable on here though.<br>See <br><br>Also, it could have stood to have a good OP and ED instead of that nano.RIPE crap. It's hard to completely look forward to an episode when the first thing you heard was a below average OP, it sets a shit mood.<br>The ED was just passable. Nothing more.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I only watch it for hotarun.</br>  I only watch it for Renge. All the other girls are shit cunts and I especially dislike the lesbian.   this thread <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/reddit/</br>  NNB is an entry-level SOL. It's not bad, but it's rather unremarkable other than the setting and Renge.<br><br>Tamayura and Aria are superior.</br></br>  <br>This and holy shit she will grow into such ugly woman.</br>  <br> You don't wait for something to happen. <br>It's almost completely pointless then. What a colossal waste of time.</br></br>  <br> not watching SoLs to relax and get comfy before you go to bed </br>  <br>It's still better than Gakkou Gurashit.<br>Damned shit tricked me into thinking it was a comfy slice of life.</br></br>  <br>Literally the best anime ever made.</br>  We're not finished talking about this yet.<br><br>Why are girls why tired eyes so based?</br></br>  I wasn't sure what to expect but I really liked the first episode  <br>Because lazy sluts are the best~</br>  literally best girl  wait... what is the fourth hole?  <br>I bet urethra, it's also a hole, isn't it?</br>  <br>the hand</br>  <br>Reminds me of that entry on a med school textbook about an elderly couple who couldn't have kids no matter how hard they tried over the decades they have been together<br><br>turns out her husband was sticking inside her urethra the whole time an she still had her hymen intact</br></br></br>  <br> eye bags <br> lazy sluts only <br>if anything it shows the slut hasn't been able to sleep properly for a while, it can show that she is lazy and spends all her time shitposting online, OR that she spends all her time studying a subject she is interested on<br>Green is the later</br></br></br></br>  <br>she probably spends every night sticking stuff in her vagina to try and work out why it feels good</br>    This doesn't turn into a harem of lewd girls, right?  <br>Of course it does.</br>  <br>But she already has a boyfriend</br>  of all the anime im watching this season, this'll do.  <br>it's the sexual frustation, she just need a couple hours of passionate lovemaking.</br>  This show is bad and you should feel bad.  IN A WORLD WHERE SOCIAL JUSTICE HAS WON AND OPPRESSED ALL FUN<br><br>ONE BAD DUDE WILL RISE UP TO TRIGGER A NATION</br></br>  This has to be one of the worst hairstyles I've ever seen in an anime.<br><br>What the fuck, himecut with bangs and short hair? Fuck this</br></br>  Why does Yuzuki N' Dash like Nakadashi so much.  <br>  himecut </br>  <br>Because it's hot, that's why.<br><br>Now fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does she like it so mich that half hername is Nakadashi.</br>    This show is really aggravating my choker fetish, it's glorious.  <br> you will never be so pure that the sight of two flies mating makes you cum </br>  <br>They want his D too?</br>  <br>So since everyone came it means that it's the purest school in the world?</br>  I really like when they censor "penis" in shows like this.<br> Chi*po </br>  <br><br>HOW</br></br>  <br>is this copypasta now?</br>  <br>green didn't cum, so no, not every one in the school is pure, thus it is not the most pure school in the world</br>  At least this was pretty interesting. <br>Probably one of only 3-4 I will keep going with.</br>  <br>Why do they even orgasm when they dont know about anything sexual.<br>They were so oblivious to anything that you have all reason to believe that they dont even schlick/fap.</br></br>  So was this really a light novel? The premise and the jokes seem like they would work much better as a manga or anime.  <br>Painfully.</br>  of course she didn't since she's thoroughly explored herself in her inquiry about where babies come from, and has gotten used to that lewd moist feeling.<br><br>She needs to examine one of those hoses to experiment with it and see precisely what kind of substance gets pumped through it that causes pregnancy, however. That mystery substance eludes her.</br></br>  <br>they were each other's first crush and it was the 20's<br>no internet or porn mags easily available to show him he was supposed to put in the lower hole inside her vag</br></br>  <br>Green is the purest and didnt cum because she didnt grasp what mating really is nor what sex is.<br><br>Its like showing a five year old porn. The majority wont pop a boner.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Back of the knee maybe?</br></br>    <br><br>MUCH better. Thank you.</br></br>  I'm gonna re-create her in Artificial Academy 2 and fuck her all day.  why does she have a pregnancy fetish?<br><br>what a shit tier fetish...only thing worse is scat</br></br>  <br>it was green's flies, she knew what the flies were doing enough to know from her research that while similar in concept, human reproduction is not like fly reproduction, hence why she was confused why every one was getting their panties wet when the only thing slightly arousing she was being exposed in her point of view was the lewd terrorist narration, which alone was not enough to make her panties dank <br><br>tl;dr green got over exposed and is basically a slut in comparison to the rest of the school</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel like I've seen her kind of design in another show but I can't remember which. She might even have had a lab coat, too. Similar voice, if not the same.</br></br>  <br>Wait I've seen or heard this somewhere as well.</br>  <br>Nothing better than some slender neckwear on a girl</br>    <br>I think it was the doc from Date a Live.</br>  Tell me about Blue Tundra, why does she wear the mask  <br>Kiyama Harumi<br><br>Railgun, also adapted by J.C. staff.</br></br></br>  <br>end your life</br>  <br><br>JC Staff is the best modern anime studio period.<br><br>KyoAni is old and busted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, when I was five a naked barbie doll would make me erect.</br>  WHAT IS THE FOURTH MOUTH!?  <br>Yeah and look where you ended up.<br>Kids that pop a boner during childhood end up as sexual deviants.</br></br>  <br>Pussy, asshole, mouth, and given the gesture she's making, her hand.</br>  <br>you're doing it wrong<br><br>see:</br></br></br>  <br>The hand doesn't go anywhere. There is nothing but empty space on either end. The vagina, asshole, and mouth all lead to something or somewhere. I find your claim reckless and dubious.</br>   that ohohoho <br> that upbeat spirit <br> that dirty mouth <br> wears panties on her head <br><br>Why is Ayame so best?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If the hand is a hole than feet can be too which in return makes armpits etc also holes.</br>  <br>Fuck, this is depressing as hell.</br>  how many episodes are out? how do i keep track of this? ive only seen the 1st one  <br><br>Her anime design is top tier. I like Yuzuki-N-Dash and all but the manga design was plain boring.</br></br>  <br>KyoAni can animate well but the content is usually never stuff that keeps me awake or interested for long. The only shows I ever enjoy from them are some LNs they adapt.</br>  <br>Exactly. There is no real difference between handjobs and every other sort of sexual activity that can incorporate the body. What would set the hands apart from the feet, the thighs, or the boobs? They can all rub on a penis in a similar fashion to the hands. Therefore, this claim that the fourth mouth are the hands is groundless. That's not even getting into the issue of whether or not the hands would count as one or two mouths, making women in possession of FIVE holes as opposed to four.<br><br>I posit that it's more likely the fourth mouth is the urethra.</br></br></br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br>Personality of a charismatic background character but is actually main girl.</br>  <br>Well her style of art is kind of same-facey. Even sometimes the males have more or less the same faces.</br>  <br>green is greatness</br>  <br>Must be Nunotaba Shinobu from Railgun.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I think  was it (though more manga version than anime version). Though these other two makes me appreciate the sleepy-eyed/voiced archetype even more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually yeah, kind of.<br>In a show with a less ridiculous premise her antics would usually relegate her to a comic relief character and nothing more</br></br>  <br>Basically put Rika from Haganai as main girl</br>  <br><br>I read the LN but maaan.<br>The adaptation is going the fantastic.<br>Amazing OST.<br>Amazing ED.<br><br><br>girls have 3 holes down and one up.<br>Check your mom :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  They should have just fucked in front of the entire school.<br><br> I remember spanking several times to the thought of fucking several girls in front of the whole school during a pep rally. </br></br>  <br>this<br>the moment she mentioned she doesn't have the actual intercourse pic, the first thing on my head was "now you have a dick on your side, just get naked and fuck while taking pictures"</br></br>  Dystopian SYD huh...<br><br>I can dig it.</br></br>  <br>Sounds like a perfect way to blow both of your cover and get thrown in juvie<br><br>Also Ayame is surprisingly bashful apparently</br></br></br>  she's a pure girl who just wants to talk like a slut<br><br>she wouldn't just go tape 3 minutes of hardcore raw unpixellated dickings with the first henchman she recruits into SOX and air it just to corrupt the students. she's not that dirty.</br></br>  <br>Nobody can tell who you are when you have a pantsu mask on. Also MC had a pantsu mask and a wig, they could have made it /u/ as fuck.</br>  <br> dat uniform <br> dat braid <br>I love both her looks.</br></br></br>  <br>The spectacles are just the icing on top.</br>  <br>disgusting!</br>  <br>God I LOVE Girls with Eye Bags!!! I wish there would be way more characters like her!</br>  <br>The 4th hole is the hole in a females heart that longs to be filled with the love and emotion of another mate.<br><br>producing the phrase speak from the heart.<br><br>or <br><br>there is a secret hole in their back like a piggy bank where you can stash your coins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you type like someone from something awful.</br>  <br>  coins <br>Or stolen virginities?</br></br>  <br>Love makes you do awful things.</br>   S-O-X <br> S-O-X <br> S-O-X <br> S-O-X </br></br></br>    Did anyone make a webm of the ED?  <br> Why are girls why tired eyes so based? <br>They just are, anon.</br></br>  <br>So not only is she not going to win the MC, she won't even be in love with him?</br>  <br>Because it's a joke.</br>  <br>FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOU</br>  <br>post pics when you're done</br>  <br>There's a few.</br>  <br> know from her research that while similar in concept <br>No, she does not know what human reproduction is like at all, she only theorized that the *cucumber* might be a key component in it and it might be related to fly reproduction in some way.</br></br>  <br>THIS IS A STORY OF A MAN WHO HAS YET TO REALIZE HIS DESTINY</br>  <br>Throw yourself to fire skeletons you disgusting fuck</br>  <br>I want to give her my cucumber for research</br>  fuck yeah chokers/collars  <br>i'd choke her with my dick</br>  Will the BD be uncensored?  Does anybody have the "cock-a-doodle pussy!" picture?    <br>I was being serious</br>  <br><br>1) Go back in time to prevent yourself from being dropped on your head as a baby<br>2) If retardation persists, keep it to yourself instead of asking questions.</br></br></br>  Is this AOTS or just dogshit?  <br>Hard to tell from just one episode, but so far it's not too bad, it's mindless lewd fun with a ridicolous setting and story. The character design is pretty nice, the president and Kujo both look hot, and the green haired girl has her own charm. This is one of those animes where you don't have to think too hard to enjoy yourself though, so if you're up for a moment of laughs and relaxation, watch it.</br>  <br>Is this the new "how did he play rock"?</br>  <br><br>So there's hope for urethra insertion fetishists! Yes folks, your waifu really can be fucked in the peehole! And there's only a small amount of pain for the first year!</br></br>  <br><br>if it pulls some Madoka "suddenly much deeper that it at first seemed" later on it'll be the AOTS, else it'll be a decent series that will never get a second series because japs have no taste.</br></br>  <br>tbh, i dont want this show to pull a madoka - i just want to enjoy it as it is.</br>  <br>I wonder how the hell they can do that with this show, the caliber of ridiculousness is seriously too high for that to even succeed. But whatever works for them I guess.</br>  <br> animes </br>  <br> that ironic Utena <br>triggered me good anon</br></br>  I think this is the first time I've been mildly irritated by bad subtitles, I checked the Hiryuu ones and at some parts funimation makes a much better delivery. Seems like I'll wait some more.<br><br>Ayame is perfect</br></br>  <br>I'd fuck her on the spot.</br>  <br><br>Which hole is that?!</br></br>  So who wants to bet that this is going to be one of those shows that have an amazing first episode, and everything else is meh in comparision?  <br>You sir are an evil person - just for mention this possibility</br>  <br>I get that feeling too. I hope I'm wrong but there are so many ways for this show to turn into forced drama.</br>  <br>I got out of work just now.<br><br>I'll post her either in this or the next thred.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, true, let's just hope it sticks with being pure comedy and doesn't take itself too seriously.</br>  It's time.
