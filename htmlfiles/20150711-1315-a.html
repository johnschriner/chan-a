Great Leadership there! <br>Three full Legions of the VASSAL STATE's forces.<br><br>You missed the point entirely. The Empire lost half its army and is vulnerable from rebellion, so before the word gets out he ordered the vassal kings to attack the JSDF and get themselves killed, so the potential future rebel forces get weeded out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he should have done some scouting before entering the Gate? Nah. Scouting is useless anyway.<br><br><br> so before the word gets out he ordered the vassal kings to attack the JSDF <br>Well that works too. A more valid reason.

What are you implying?</br>  Were kill numbers higher in manga or am i misremembering things?  <br> Maybe he should have done some scouting before entering the Gate? <br><br>Well, they did actually. They even took some Japanese slaves.<br><br>Didn't prevent them from being retarded though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These vassals seemed pretty eager to fight for the Empire. Seems like he just killed loyal subordinates for no good reason.</br>  <br>Do not doubt the emperor's tactical genius, fuckhead.</br>  <br>Most of the men there were driven by glory, and nothing else.<br><br>If they felt there were be more glory in overthrowing the Empire, they would not have hesitated in changing sides.<br><br>It also serves the secondary benefit of turning the land around the Capital into a chaotic mess, with rebels, mercenaries, and bandits adding to the scorched earth policy, buying time to shore the Capital up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Manga also said around 120k died by that point.</br>  <br>Even streaming is no excuse for that low quality with all the HD streams out there nowadays.</br>  Where are those webms brahs  I want to taste elf pussy.  I like this Itami version more than the manga version.<br>He looks here more like a competent soldier that doesn't show it on the first look, something that the manga failed to show.</br>   the Japanese <br> building friendly rapport with underdeveloped foreign villages in a war <br><br>hahha...HAHAHAHA</br></br></br>  So this is the power of Japan's military...<br><br>whoa..</br></br>  Why is the length of the day, the month, and the year for some reason the same in the Gate world as it is on Earth?   you need to be 2000 years ahead in warfare <br> and the enemy are mindless morons who can't learn <br> and you need to film it like they deserve it <br> and you have to look like a hero yourself <br> and all enemy women will jump on your dick for it <br>Just how big is Japan's inferiority complex?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.  One of the other kingdom/empires attacks the weakened empire later.  </br>  <br> pink  <br><br>nice</br></br></br>  So when do the volunteer "comfort women" come in?  The show is the equivalent of filming yourself beating up a bunch of preschoolers and uploading it to youtube.  <br>They wanted glory and plunder. That's why feudal lords go to war in the first place, who they're fighting for and why they're fighting doesn't matter as long as they think they'll win and there will be glory and plunder involved.</br>  <br> Doesnt Zorzel throw a coup then gets killed by bunny queen? Who becomes emperor after? </br>  <br>So big, not even two nukes could cover it.</br>  Fucking retard OP.    <br>It is, and I'm enjoying every second of it.</br>  <br>I think by the end of the story / gaidens  Pina looks to be heir apparent. She likes Itami though so we might end up with Itami as Emperor, may Rory help all their souls if that happens.  </br>  <br>Now that would be a video I'd like to see.</br>    <br>why is not asuka so shit?</br>  <br> he and bunny queen both kill each other </br>  <br> blocking bullets with a wood shield </br>  <br>They were against a mere 10,000 men, they don't want to be humiliated and they want the gate back before it gets worse.</br>  <br>Why is Tuka drawing her bow like a Japanese (arrow on the outside, string drawn well past the cheekbone and almost to the level of the ear, thumb draw), she's not fucking japaneeese<br><br>Not like Big Boss here</br></br></br>  <br>What about the other brother?</br>  <br>What is this, anyways?</br>  <br>Not a history major, but I believe that's bronze anon.

America is just stupid (In this manga universe).</br>  <br>In Gate World the middle east conflict is a lot more wide spread and violent so US is tied up there with their forces. They are supplying Japan though and even the Japanese diplomats know that they're going to have to let the US come in to the gate eventually. This shit is covered in like the first few chapters of the manga.</br>  <br> the first thing the local military does is attack the civilians of the other side <br> after losing the offensive, the feudal lords are dumb enough to let themselves get slaughtered on the kings commands without raising an eyebrow <br>ayy</br></br></br>   Axis Forces: 130,000 dead   <br> Those 20 POWs <br><br>Every time.</br></br></br>  <br> First Legend of Galactic Heroes <br> Then Log Horizon <br> Now this. <br><br>Can someone explain to me how AD Vision's anime version of Mutineer's Moon stalled out when it appears Japan has the exact same sci-fi sensibilities as Baen Books?<br><br>At this point all we're missing is "Aliens invade, but humans are natural-born killing machines."</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>literally know nothing about the country or world beyond the gate. <br><br>AND YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO GATHER INTELLIGENCE?!? WOULDN'T BE TRYING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE, HOW THEIR POLITICS WORK, ETC ETC?!?<br><br>Now im not saying you have to make friends with them, thats just MC's way of doing things, in the manga his recon team out of the 6 that were sent out is the only one that actually makes friends with locals initially. But to knock down the idea of learning more about the nations villages and state of the world is just silly anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than the square steak</br>  <br>The villages don't really give a shit about Imperial politics.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need sauce.</br>  <br> Streaming <br><br>Holy fuck why would you do this to your eyes?</br></br></br>  <br>I want to bury my ass in her face.</br>  <br>How did big boss lose? Where's your dogs at?</br>  <br> I wonder if all those lost troops lead to problems later on? Like a lack of Defense to further external Threats. <br>Yep, and internal threats as well.</br></br>  <br>it is not wrong, it's just unrealistic to think that the all Japanese army are so pure and peaceful against an enemy that killed 150 civilians. Some hothead there is everywhere, but in this manga all nips are champions of justice.</br>  <br> bronze <br> stopping a bullet <br><br>5.56 (M193) flies through modern hardened steel body armor (level III) plates at close range.<br><br>Bronze is a lot softer than steel, which is a lot softer than hardened high carbon steel. If you were using bronze, you'd have to rely solely on thicknesss to hope to stop a bullet, making a shield that size impossible to even lift without heavy machinery<br><br>Even a steel shield that size rated for rifle centerfire cartridges would be impossibly heavy, there's a reason modern ballistic shields are made of ceramics and Kevlar, and even those are fucking heavy<br><br>so yeah, bullshit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon please</br>  <br>Damn, Rory looks fucking retarded with those "cat ears".</br>   Gate opens in Poland  <br> Crudely assembled military forces doing somehow well only GROM guys doing great, lots of guys are Witcher fanboys.  <br> Lots of vodka smuggled everyday beyond gate <br> Politicians are even more at each other throats and prevent any big progress to be made <br> Rusians are told to GTFO and end USA gets all access and take over operations there but need to move more stuff into Poland (so there is something we gains by this) <br> This cause more political shitstorm <br> Most and often first word from out world learned by people beyond Gate is 'kurwa' </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I found the answer in under 40 seconds.<br>I believe in you, you can do it!</br></br>  <br>If I angle my shield perfectly, I can deflect bullets.</br>  <br>Yes this is the power of a modern nation with a.......sorta developed modern military..... vs a roman empire like army<br><br>What did you expect? this is guns and tanks vs swords and shields. we have come a long way since we fought with sword and shield. Even back when firearms were first introduced into warfare and they needed 4 min to reload the damn things they still kicked the asses of everyone who didnt have them. Look at Oda Nobunaga who took over most of japan using firearms.</br></br></br>  <br>During the Cold War, US military doctrine stipulated that America should have the capability to fight "two and a half" wars at once, in anticipation of having to fight WW3 both in Europe and the Pacific just like WW2.<br><br>Nowadays it's supposed to be "fight two wars at once and decisively win one of them".<br><br>Even if America was busy with fighting ISIS on the ground, they have more than enough resources left over to support an intervention in Japan if they really wanted to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>soon my anon, soon. and they are monster girls too</br>  <br> So the Empire sent at least THREE FULL LEGIONS to their death? Great Leadership there! <br>He ends up pretty clever actually.<br><br> Uses the potential rebels of smaller nations to be slaughtered. <br> Later begins to see his daughter's competency and the true danger of the JSDF. <br> Sees his first son steadily become more idiotic, and begins priming him to take the fall by declaring him to be the successor. <br> Diablo the second son sees this and tries to form his own faction. <br> Both sons' rebellions fail and Pina is left as the only heir. <br><br>And he survives it all, IIRC. Diablo saw his scheme, and tried to take over the Empire after Zorzal's defeat and turn on the JSDF (IIRC, with Chinese assistance), only for it to fall through.<br><br>If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

People like to call the US an imperial power but the fact is that the American people hate imperialism. Americans don't have the willpower to fight imperial wars which is why vietnam was so unpopular. The best deal the US could get is cheap trades on the resources coming from the GATE.

But yes, the way Rome endured it shows how really powerfull it was as a constitution.</br>  All America needs to do is send one of these bad boys through the gate and there would be #FREEDOM for everyone.<br><br>Piloted by Walken, of course.</br></br>  <br>So sexy.</br>  <br>What's your name drawfriend?</br>  <br>Sure, except for the part where the W33 would have probably killed the crews that fired it.</br>  <br>Being useless, they haven't even grasped how to cast fireball yet.</br>  <br>I never realized until I took a Roman history class just how long Hannibal was roving around the Italian peninsula, like 15 years of that shit. Hard to fathom it.</br>  <br>Scipio was pretty great but the magnitude of Hannibal's tactical victories shadow him. Scipio was a better startegist than Hannibal for sure tough.</br>  <br>here's one of them.</br>  <br> they rely on satellite navigation <br>Not really. Long range missiles exist that do not rely on satellite navigation. I thought that for example ICBM do not work with satellite but instead inertial navigation to make them more reliable, so once you know the gegography and physical parameters, such missiles will work without any communication. Afaik there are many modern missiles who can self navigate. But I am not a /k/ommando so my knowledge is extremely limited and I could be wrong.</br></br>   America is the big, bad, greedy nation <br><br>To the trash this garbage goes. I guess 2 nukes weren't enough</br></br>  <br>Ohhhh baby yes</br>  <br>Leopard2-chan is the love of my life</br>  <br>*W9. Upshot Knothole Grable was a W9; the W33 had static tests only. My bad.</br>  <br>oh, so Gate world is still early magic?</br>    <br> Tires tied thousand times <br> Not even a nuclear blast can make them melt. </br></br>  <br>DK</br>  <br>The first episode makes it pretty clear that Japan has interest in resources beyond the gate, too.</br>  <br> America is the big, bad, greedy nation <br>Implying not.</br></br>  <br> Schwarzemarken when </br>  <br> Lazenby <br>Literally who?<br><br>Also "Hannibal ante portas".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inertial navigation is a big part, especially once you get to extreme altitudes where GPS gets wonky. (The whole system kinda relies on you being guaranteed to be below the satellites, and the faster you're going the harder it is to get a clean fix.) This is a big part of why extremely good accelerometers remain under weapons export restrictions in the US.<br><br>That said, terminal navigation often involves satellites, and aiming the thing in the first place would be very difficult without some sort of GPS to establish a coordinate system to aim at in the first place. They don't even know with certainty that the world on the other side of the gate has the same radius, for instance.</br></br></br>  <br>Because modern archery is a joke compared to how archery really was when archers were on real battlefields<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BEG<wbr>-ly9tQGk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Longbowmen truly were fucking terrifying.

You don't have to overdo it with a 20 Mm range missile after all.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br><br>How about a nekomusume looking puzzled at a nekomimi headband, while a bunnygirl looks at a cosplay tail and wonders  tail goes where? </br></br>  <br>Nice. Aurea's so cute, even when she wants to consume your spirit.</br>  <br>Regrettably not.</br>  <br> Because modern archery is a joke compared to how archery really was when archers were on real battlefields <br>You are a joke because you link to a mediocre trick shooter video that makes a bunch of ridiculous claims with 0 evidence to back them up that shows how gullible and retarded modern internet browsers are.

Loli wartales had quite good description about how magician platoon being used, including how magician rely on MP storage tools since magician own MP is always not enough. The magic usage was standardized to flying magic, barrier magic, and explosion type of magic continuously for limited time, and then back to the base like an air plane.</br>  The real question is, is the show any good?  <br>The initial post I was responding to was a Topol-M, which relies on a mixture of inertial and GLONASS navigation. Theater ballistic missiles would be a possibility, but without satellite support they probably wouldn't achieve acceptable mean targeting error.</br>  <br>Maybe.</br>  <br>Its alright.</br>  <br>Interesting, thanks. So what WMD would you propose in such a scenario? Of course the entire question whether or why they should be used at all is ignored here.</br>  No matter how much you tell me the WN was written and set in the period when Dubya was in office, the president in the anime looks just a little bit too much like Trump.  <br>Shame.Saved anyway.</br>  <br>Yes danger close prob ep 5 or 6</br>  <br><br>Japan sure is good at predictions.</br></br>  <br>Do you not understand the value of a completely new world to the leader of ANY country?</br>  I do wonder if America has the capacity to act when politics at home is getting more and more liberal. They'd throw a hiss fit if America is to actually commit mass troops for a big offensive. Especially when Japanese military is well equipped to counterattack immediately.  <br>We talking about waifus?</br>  <br>They've got essentially unopposed air power and armored vehicles that can move faster and with better protection than anything on the ground. They could use SADMs if they wanted, or they could just pulverize things with strategic bombers. (If they had either of those in their inventory.) They wouldn't even need nukes; firebombing the capital like late-war Tokyo would be more than sufficient, with far less difficult cleanup.</br>  <br>Nah, webs gonna made another 9/11.</br>  <br> trump <br> winning <br>Its going to be Hillary, or by some miracle of god, a competent GOP candidate.<br><br>the US is also well equipped to counterattack, while having even less liberals than Japan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That actually brings up one of the things I'd have loved to see. Would have been great if they had rolled a big H2 rocket through the gate (might have to re-assemble the SRBs on the other side to make it fit), set up a pad on the other side, and launched a bird into orbit to scope out the entire damn planet.<br><br>I mean, they haven't even set up an observatory (that we know of), to look at the stars on another world's night sky.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 300,000 knights vs 10,000 scrawny japanese army men AND women <br> knights defeated <br><br>man they could've defeated them if they sent them in waves ... sacrificing themselves by depleting their ammo.<br><br>it did not seem that they brought enough ammo.<br><br>Majority of knights would still die</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Now I think about it, this show's premise might make more sense for South Korea. They can't fight back with North Korean transgressions here and there but if there was a foreign nation that gated and invaded, they would try to slaughter the enemies immediately. And they have a bigger ready military due to mandatory military service and they have all the latest American technology + Korea's new military robotics.  <br> KNIGHTS <br>Really?<br>Aslo <br> moral <br> muh magic </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>   GATE opens in remote Estonian forest <br> goes unnoticed <br> Empire manages to colonize half of the countryside before the locals get a wind of it <br><br>also<br> GATE open anywhere in Europe <br> EU makes it a refugee dumping ground </br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> GATE opens in Ukraine <br> They told that this is a russians </br></br>  <br> American enters the Gate </br>  <br> GATE opens in America <br> Imperial empire is forced to accept our culture <br> McDonalds on every street </br></br></br>  <br> Gate opens in UK <br> Empire imposed by Shariah law in 10 days. </br></br>  <br>stale /pol/ memes are so ebin</br>  <br>Can't trump the Trump.</br>  <br>It's not a meme, Mohammed.</br>  <br> Gate opens in Belarus <br> Empire apologizes and re-open Gate in Poland. </br></br>  <br> and as she dies she hallucinates her husbando holding out his hand to take her away </br>  <br><br>Butthurt much m8?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Pls no, you're posts are fineish but this here lies the road to rampant shit flinging.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder if Gate harpys lay eggs like Papi.</br></br>  this show is like seeing brock lensar beating cancer patients and i fucking love it  <br>Rectum ravaged no, bored yes.</br>  Anyone read this?<br><br> guy makes dynamite and guns and pretends to be a magician <br><br>Only thing I can think of that's similar</br></br></br></br>  Well, to their credit, the armies never retreated. <br><br>I want to know what the JSDF did with the bodies.</br></br>  <br>Those damn Connecticut Yankees and their lassos!</br>  <br>There's also the Ring of Fire series where a small American town gets transported back to Europe in the 1600's.</br>  Anus attack  <br> At this point all we're missing is "Aliens invade, but humans are natural-born killing machines." <br>harry turtledove's worldwar series anime when?</br></br>  <br>yea man, i nearly started laughing out loud when i realized the soldiers were getting bombarded by artillery.</br>  <br><br>The Japanese are extremely used to earthquakes.</br></br>  <br>wasn't there a bit when they bombed the shit out of them while laughing and playing ride of the valkyries too?</br>  <br> It's like you didn't even pay the slightest bit of attention or something. <br>No. That anon was right. The emperor directly said after the battle that they sent in tributary state armies to get killed. This was to prevent any uprising. That is why they (Empire) held back their own forces.<br> These vassals seemed pretty eager to fight for the Empire. Seems like he just killed loyal subordinates for no good reason. <br>Not really. They wanted glory. That is how these guys fought back in the days when even in our own human history, wars were fought for something as benign as a royal prince's birthday or ascension into power.<br><br>They killed them because they could turn onto the Empire in a later situation if they found out that the Empire was fucked up royally.<br><br>These were tributary states under the Empire's control, and not truly loyal to the Empire.

You might be right.</br>  <br> Not really. They wanted glory. That is how these guys fought back in the days when even in our own human history, wars were fought for something as benign as a royal prince's birthday or ascension into power. <br><br>Wars in the past did have reasons regarding law or rights or whatever. The only meaningless wars were raids by one side looking to make off with treasure and slaves from enemy territory. I don't think any war was fought over someone's birthday.<br><br>The vassals probably couldn't refuse in this case. If they were ready for rebellion they might have struck their banners when the order came, but they likely got their orders before they had everything in order. As for the soldiers, it doesn't take much to get them to fight for rape and pillage. Professional armies weren't too common in history, with many being paid by whatever they could steal from civilizans and dead enemy soldiers on the march.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH SHIT SOMEONE CROSS REF THAT SHIT!</br>  I can't tell what this show is trying to be.

I'd say happy, seeing someone get bullied really kills my boner.  I'm a sucker for happy endings.  I want everything to have a happy ending.  Happy endings are good.  Happy.

Like the story in your pic, it's just completely ridiculous.</br>  <br>Excuse me, does anyone know the name of this?<br><br>Image search gives me nothing much a link to an mmo board.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't even.</br>  <br>Happy or bittersweet endings are the best. Also lots of hnng and an actual plot.</br>  I utterly loathe rape/bad end doujins, which is precisely why I fap to them from time to time to feel that sense that I'm doing something wrong, something I'll regret afterwards. In particular, doujins of characters I like getting raped or tortured so that I feel guilty about it and am reminded of it whenever I see the series mentioned. Like that Nanoha doujin "3 Mothers".  <br>It depends, both can be good.<br>That's not a doujin by the way.</br></br>  <br>PFFFT.</br>  <br>I remember that ending. After she's ostracized from school, her mother kicks her out, leaving her to be pimped out by her fuck buddy.<br>It was deliciously soul crushing.</br></br>  I like the ones where they fuck, those are the best  Depends on my mood, but generally I prefer happy endings. I read and enjoy darker stuff too, but afterwards, not immediately but within half and hour or so, I usually get in mood for something sweet and vanilla.  Sometimes I read doujins just for the loveydovey dialogue and only halfheartedly look at the lewd pages.<br><br>I don't know. Seeing someone confess and pour their heart out to someone else and the general atmosphere of those doujins just transforms my latent heartboner energy into bonerboner energy.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, confessions are great.<br>If only most doujinshi I try didn't confuse confessions with sex.</br></br>  No. Prefer sad endings. I want to see the despair in the characters as they lose all hope.<br><br>I also like NTR.</br></br>  <br>Exactly, its the intimacy and briefness of doujins that can make them very heartwarming reads, better than some 100+ chapter manga that drags on for the next flag to be sprung up.</br>  <br>Yeah, the nice thing about hentai doujins is that they actually go somewhere. Going somewhere too quickly, without any build-up, can also be a problem, but a lot of vanilla doujins are really good for a quick heart-warming read.</br>  <br>dammit /a/, my thread got deleted because of you.</br>  <br>What thread?</br>  <br> briefness of doujins that can make them very heartwarming reads <br><br>So..... basically oneshots?</br></br></br>  <br>I absolutely love when a doujins portraits even weird pairs as just a story about love. I love damaged goods, comedy hatesex, stuff like that. But I have best time reading those stories. I don't even fap.<br> tfw I read doujins for the plot </br></br>  <br>Kek, where you the guy who tried to start a Morrowind thread with that image on /v/?<br><br>What the fuck were you expecting?</br></br></br>  <br>Left out "intimacy" m8, key word there. I'm not saying all one-shots are not intimate, just that the majority that I have come across don't tend to give me the same satisfaction as some doujinshi that I have read.</br>  <br> that doujin <br><br>Simultaneously impossibly pure and more dirty than any mindbreak in this world.</br></br></br>  Definitely happy. <br><br>Although recently I read this, and the  transition from happy to soul crushing to happy was one hell of a roller coaster   I almost stopped at page 94 I couldn't handle it <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/821767/b407ba<wbr>9734/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  I like happy endings with tragic content.  <br>Speaking of happy to soul crushing to happy, this is always and forever will be one of my favourites. <br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/601371/4a2823<wbr>690b/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I don't mind sad endings but the ending to this was fucked.</br>  I like bittersweet endings.  <br> Already saved <br>I'll have to read it again.</br></br>  <br>Ah I totally remember this, yeah it was a good one.</br>  <br>I wish 3D women were capable of love</br>  I like the "how the fuck are those two together?"  Still mad.  Ending in pregnancy &gt; Everything else  I've never been a fan of sad endings regardless of medium. But for hentai, bad endings don't really seem to feel right. One moment you're fapping, then the next moment you're supposed to get feels?<br><br>Then again, I prefer vanilla stuff anyway.</br></br>  <br> Not wanting to blow your load in a well of depression and heartbreak <br>Vanilla indeed.</br></br>  <br> it's a nigger baby <br> yfw <br>also gonna check this </br></br></br>  I see this thread calls for a reposting.  <br><br>I'm black so I actually would find that pretty funny.<br><br>Might be why I like cuckold and adultery endings so much also.</br></br></br></br>    <br> mfw </br>      <br> Sense of values of wine <br>This entire hmango.

Also, I sometimes type properly. </br>  <br>Are there any other cute anime? Only hs and yy do the trick for me.</br>  <br>yuyushiki. kiniro mosaic.</br>  <br>Well there aren't that many people that type like that <br><br><br>I've been wanting to watch NNB as well. Lucky Star is also pretty good</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty partial to KMB and Kiniro Mosiac, but I'm sure all anons have their own strong opinions on this. Cuteness is pretty subjective, after all.</br>  <br>Minami Ke and Sketchbook are great but unfortunately not as popular.<br><br> I don't know why, I loved HS, YY, Sketchbook, Minami Ke, and tons of others SOL, but I just can't bring myself to finish Aria because it bores me. </br></br></br>  <br>Lucky star was the most cancerous shit I've seen. It was like pani poni dash but not fun. NNB is great.<br><br>I'll try yuyushiki and kiniro, thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>Sketchbook was comfy but lacking something, I don't know<br>Also isn't Minami-Ke famous as hell? I think it has like hundreds of seasons</br></br>  <br>Definitely second Yuyushiki and Kiniro.<br><br>Azumanga Daih is also pretty good if you haven't seen that, less cute, more funny. (Still cute.)<br><br>Non Non Biyori is extremely cute and less funny.</br></br></br></br></br>  Chinatsu is a cute and high tier Yuru.<br><br>Try Gochiusa. Also Yama no Susume.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>I don't get it</br>  <br>Get this normie out of here.</br>  <br>She can't stop being amazing.</br>  One day, Chinatsu will realize there's an even better option available to keep her up at night.  <br>Is it me or where all the Yuurus a little more lewd in the older chapters, barring maybe Yui and Akari?</br>  <br>Yurus are never lewd!</br>  <br>Yes they were. Only Ayano is untainted.</br>  <br>She's figure it out soon enough. Her dreams are already trying to send her the message.</br>  <br>Purest purness.</br>  <br>Might have something to do with starting out Yuri Hime S. It had mostly male readers from what I read. But it's the characters have also gone through changes and their personalities are more consistent.</br>  Why did Chinatsu-chan soil both herself and Akari instead of remaining pure for marriage?  <br><br>You know she's masturbating like a maniac behind the scenes though.

They're practically pure as snow now. I can't even remember the last explicitly lewd thing to happen in the recent manga chapters. Even boob-touching seems so pure in YrYr now, my brain didn't even register it.</br>  <br> that casual pat on Himawari's boobs <br>I wish I could do that too.</br></br>  Does Sakurako have any redeeming qualities at all? I don't want to dislike her, but she just seems to be bad at everything.  <br>That's exactly why she's great.</br>  <br>She's a cute vampire who is in love with an oppai monster.</br>  <br><br>She's cute but she's just... dumb.<br><br>Like, Kyouko is actually pretty smart, good at stuff and things, and comes up with fun activities.

He did kill Android 19, technically the first character to defeat SSJ Goku (Though Goku had 1000 handicaps in that fight)  <br>True, forgot about 19. Still tho, it'd be refreshing to see him get at least one major saga victory, like a Frieza/Cell/Buu</br>  <br>Not if the Fanbase has anything to say about it</br>  <br> implying fans know what's best for them </br>   any character other than Goku winning   <br> Vegeta will never achieve anything. <br> Piccolo will never achieve anything. <br> Gohan will never achieve anything anymore. </br></br></br>  <br>The DBZ Japanese fanbase is probably the worst Japanese fanbase of all time, and considering Japan like Seraph of the Shit that says something.<br>Has anyone ever called out Japan on their stupid Gohan and Vegeta hate?</br></br>  i always hated this about dbz, it's so predictable.<br>vegeta fights and loses, then goku fights and wins. repeat x10.</br>  More importantly, will Piccolo get to do anything? Only saiyans are shown fighting in the op, as usual.  <br>He'll get some sort of power-up that will make him able to stand up to the bad guy for at least half an episode.</br>  We have a better change of Gohan Growing a pair and wrecking shit than Vegeta getting a victory.  <br>most likely. Vegeta and Goku are treated equally in the new promo materials for the most part.<br>Personally, I hope he will actually take the victory against Freeza in Super, but i also want Freeza to survive this time around.</br></br>  <br>I can understand making him take a backseat to Vegeta and Goku (even if I don't like it) but turning him completely fucking useless and making him a joke is going a bit far.</br>    <br>I think it has to do with moralfaggotry that he doesn't get major wins in the series. As in, an asshole coming out on top is generally a turnoff for most people. Just look at how people react when anything other than a betamax is the protag of an anime, they fucking hate it.</br>  I really wish they'd level out Gohan's nerdiness with some strength/seriousness to situations at hand. Early in the series Gohan had a great balance with his nerd and fighter sides. now he's 120% nerd and -80% fighter. <br><br>He doesn't need to be need to be the strongest character evar because he has too. Just seeing him be strong enough to defend himself and his friends would be nice.</br></br>  <br> they fucking hate it <br>Doesn't /a/ constantly bemoan the generic stupid good guy shonen cliche?</br></br>  <br> useless and making him a joke is going a bit far. <br>That's just you projecting.</br></br>  <br>I'd say it's pretty even, but even that is too much.</br>  <br>He had "great balance" when he was in constant fucking danger of dying. The world is in peace and he is not being forced into crazy shit anymore.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? Don't you remember Vegeta's yet unmatched victory against the invincible and unstoppable Cui?</br>  <br> 120% nerd and -80% fighter <br>Anon, that adds up to 40%. What's the other 60%?</br></br>  <br>Semen tank, according to Videl.</br>  <br>there's a difference between laziness and being forced. while the 7 year gap was happening and buu bad happened, Gohan actually felt bad about his poor decision of not training. yet in the recent ROF he'd doesn't give a single shit about not being strong enough to help. <br><br>but with Super he might get a 180 degree change. which i hope thats the case, hate it that all the character not named goku just wait to be saved.<br><br> What's the other 60%? <br>probably character development. imo he and vegeta had best character arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Piccolo or the human characters won't get an equivalent to SSJ <br>Bullshit</br>  <br>Isn't Piccolo x Kame on par with SSJ2? Why does it need to be a transformation?</br>  <br>Bojack called.<br><br> PiccoloxKami <br> SSJ 2 level <br>SSJ 2 gohan would have raped the androids harder than the Cell Jrs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His victories are reserved for fights against Goku.</br>  <br>I hope not. Yamcha 2.0 needs to stay on the sidelines. It's bad enough he got a bigger role if RoF.</br>  <br>I'm with this guy. Not sure why Vegeta needs so much attention when there are more interesting/better characters that desperately need the attention to become relevant</br>  <br>Know who else was in constant danger of dying? Miyamoto Musahi.<br>Now he's one of the most historical figures in Japan and Dueling Culture.<br>The man fought over 60 Life or Death Duels.<br>And had a zero loss record.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yamcha 2.0 needs to stay on the sidelines <br>Gohan has never move from his post after his fight with Cell.</br></br>  <br>its actually sad when you think about it. Gohans potential as he was being developed all the way to and shortly after the cell games. <br><br>Then he did a downward spiral to Nerdy Yamcha. Mystic mode felt like a cheap and quick way to make him "feel important" again when all it did was make the villain stronger...</br></br></br>  <br>after his mystic power up he was the strongest character except vegitto fullstop so i assume he can still do something useful this series. Dunno how he compares to super god super saiyan god super goku saiyan god now though considering how much he jobbed in the beerus movie.</br>  b&amp;  <br> Cell V2, until he fucked it up </br>  <br> jobbed against beerus <br>I hope in super he actually puts up a decent fight. I mean flipping fat Buu did better against Beerus than all the Z warriors except Goku/Vegeta.</br></br>  <br>Exactly my point</br>  Remember that time Vegeta blew up a planet and slaughtered billions? Neither does the cast.  <br><br>Piccolo does and tells him he'll definitely go to hell when he dies no matter how much he hangs out with good guys.</br></br>   People think Vegito was cool <br> When he literally only exists because Toriyama couldn't use Gogeta due to the movie </br>  <br>He had some great fights against Dodoria and Zarbon. And he killed most of the Ginyu force.</br>  <br>and that's only what was shown. Nappa and him have probably destroyed dozens of planets</br>  <br> vegeta at his best <br> being evil killing other evil people on his way to the top. </br></br>  <br>TEN TIMES EARTH'S GRAVITY</br>  he will defeat frieza in the anime version of fukkatsu no F  <br><br>Beerus does that all the time. No biggie, Goku and the gang will still hang out with them.</br></br>  <br><br>Beerus does it because it's his job.</br></br>  has Vegeta at any point of the manga/anime ever been stronger than Goku?  <br>When they first fought, he was technically way stronger than him. <br>He also was stronger than him after getting out of the Room of Spirit &amp; Time, then he was quickly outmatched again.</br></br>  <br>Beer does it because it's probably his nature, it's most likely not just his job, he was probably born for it.</br>  <br>one could argue all the villains did their "job"<br> frieza: job: galactic emperor and planet conqueror  <br> Saiyans: space pirates. <br> Androids just doing what they were programmed to do. <br><br>mulitple times but not for very long.<br> very first fight <br> parts of frieza saga <br> early android saga <br> couple fights in cell saga <br>never in buu though. Vegeta jumped toe gun a lot and lost. in cell saga he was stronger than goku but Goku could contol his Super saiyan powers much better than Vegeta resulting in Goku being better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>never because he is a loser</br>  I hope we get more Piccolo being a worry wart in Super.  <br> married the richest woman in the world. <br> Had a child that he actually spends time with. <br> Can go on bitchin space ship rides whenever he wants. <br> Doesn't sound like an 80 year old woman. <br><br>Vegetable has it made dude.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This scene is a little scary if you think about how strong Vegeta is compared to everyone else at the time.</br>  <br>Not really, it's still just Vegeta, he won't do anything but find a way to lose no matter how strong he is. He could have ended Cell, but he just had to chimp out.</br>  <br>  find a way to lose no matter how strong he is <br>just like Gohan and gotenks.</br></br>  Vegeta has had more victories than most of the cast has.<br><br>I don't know why Vegeta fans won't ever be satisfied unless Vegeta gets to kill the major villian of the entire arc. Gohan hadn't won a fight with a character with a name up until fucking Cell!</br></br>  <br>Gotenks shouldn't even exist, goddammit.<br><br><br>People aren't tired of Vegeta not beating the Main Boss, they're tired of him being a fucking retard who jobs at every opportunity. He's had opportunities to end shit quickly but he goes retard every time, and Goku shows up to fix his fuck ups.<br><br>Or even worst, Goku's fucking kid shows up to fix it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Being Super Saiyan messes with your head. The main reason he's so retarded in the Android Saga is that he never mastered it like Goku and Gohan did.</br>  <br>Sorry but Gotenks is awesome<br> all them awesome attack names <br> suicide ghost attack <br> Trolls piccolo relentlessly  <br> only character that actually looks good in ssj 3 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan beat up cell tho</br>  <br>he said anymore.</br>  <br>Only after Goku incapacitated 2 of them.</br>  <br> MUH VEGETA <br><br>Fuck off, when will the humans get a turn?</br></br></br>  <br>Tenshinhan does, and was furious at Yamcha for becoming friends with Vegeta.</br>  <br> vegeta seasoned vet on the battle field <br> gohan a 5 year old kid out to save his green dad <br> nerd keeps up with battle vet <br> nerd eventually surpasses Vet by a ridiculous margin <br> took a seven year gap of serious training and the nerd to not do a thing to catch up <br> nerd goes mystic now stronger than Goku in SSJ 3 <br> vegeta now Buus punching bag <br> Goku save day  <br> nerd gets hot wife <br> BOG rolls around Vegeta stronger than Goku <br> Goku goes god <br> Vegeta bingo champ <br> ROF rolls by Vegeta SSGSS <br> gets killed by Butt hurt frieza blowing up the planet <br> time rewinds, Goku steals the kill <br> Movies no loger canon <br> DB Super is now the show <br> to be continued.... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> in the anime version of fukkatsu no F <br>Wait, is this show remaking the new movies? I thought it was set after them. Why are they randomly showing Beerus already, then?</br></br>  <br>yup a retelling...</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Japan likes Vegeta quite a lot which is why he gets to be in everything. They just like Goku way more than everybody else.</br>  <br>never defeated any boss!<br> died like a bitch </br></br>  <br> Gotenks shouldn't even exist, goddammit. <br> Shitting on Gotenks <br><br>Gotenks' fuckups are bad. Gotenks the character is hilarious</br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/2015/07/0<wbr>1/dragon-ball-super-complete-showca<wbr>se-event-reveals-series-plot/<br><br><br>Big deal. Boo blew up the Earth and killed all humans and Goku still wanted him to come out so they could be friends/fight</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Who hasn't died like a bitch at least at one point in Dragon Ball?</br>  <br>Remember that time Vegeta became stronger than SS3 Goku for like a few seconds because Beerus slapped Bulma</br>  <br> ssj 1 vegeta <br> stronger <br> than SSJ 3 Goku <br>..yeah that was dumb. it was a cute scene but dumb.</br></br></br></br>  Are we ever going to see SSJ3 Vegeta?  <br>It's not like it was permanent. It only lasted for a bit because Saiyan muh waifu rage.</br>  Reminder that Goku hardly ever defeats major villains on his own power, he channels the power of others in a spirit bomb. Who's doing the hard work when he's powering it up against Buu? Vegeta. Who blasts Cell when Gohan is about to lose? Vegeta.  <br>No Gohan had his head up his ass so far doubting himself that it took goku from the dead to tell him to stop being an asshat and beat the villain.<br><br>if Gohan didn't put the mental block on himself for some reason unknown to goku, He would have easily beaten cell.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Also Trunks is really the one who sliced Freiza in half, and who is the Trunks the seed of? Vegeta. Exactly.<br><br>So that basically counts as one of his victories too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about this guy?</br>   There will never be an arc where the saiyans are unable to defeat a badguy and its up to Piccolo/Yamcha/Tien/Krillin/Satan to save the day.   <br>"teen" gohan was best<br> best outfit <br> best hair <br> best transformation <br> just the right amount of screen time <br> great character arc <br> great final battle that took the whole team to help him through it. <br><br>sadly "adult" gohan isn't as fun but saiyaman is best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really hope Super gives some of the supporting cast some victories. It's been one of the most universal criticisms of later DBZ and GT that no one but Goku gets to do anything exciting or score any major victories.<br><br>I'm hoping that with the introduction of Universe 6 Beerus and Whis realize they're gonna need more than just Goku and Vegeta to help them fight so Piccolo, Tien, and Krillin (maybe even Yamcha too) get enough power boosts to remain somewhat relevant.</br></br>  <br> saiyans not saving the day <br> Humans actually doing something <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure nobody would like that.</br>  <br> Krillin <br> Yamcha <br> relevant <br><br>They're only relevant because them getting killed rustles Goku's jimmies.<br><br>And for some reason Krillin is appointed senzu bean distributor.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yamcha will be the one to take down the first big bad <br><br>How would you react? I can sort of see a Yajirobi situation going on where he cut off Vegeta's tail but it would be hilarious to see just for how everyone would react at the event.</br></br>  <br>Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan * Gohan has already been shown fighting alongside Goku and Vegeta is the intro to Super. I'm so pumped.</br>   Humans <br> Relevant <br>I always thought they should get the Kaio-ken move. but have it where there is a Kaio beyond Kaio and have Kaio-Ken 2. its a move created by a god dude, it should be better.</br></br>  <br><br>You see, there's this webcomic called Dragonball Z Multiverse...</br></br>  <br>Why was he so miffed at Gohan and Videl chumming it up? He miss the BSC?</br>  <br><br>In the manga they were all supposed to be doing training that was harder than gokus<br><br>but somehow none of them got kaioken, maybe toriyama forgot</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think humans can use the Kaio-Ken. It was supposed to be special that Goku was even able to do a Kaio-Ken x2 since doing it wrong can kill you</br>   Tullece can fight ssj teen gohan <br> tullece is a true alternate version of Goku <br> Super going to alternate universes </br></br>   Roshi has achieved Super Human status <br> He teaches Super Human to the human characters so that they can keep up with the Saiyans </br>  <br>I'm sure he also feels disapointed at Gohan not training anymore.</br>  <br><br>It's an alternate universe where Goku didn't hit his head, he decided to follow through with his plan of conquering Earth, Vegeta and Napa arrived for same reasons but instead launch a coup after falsely pleading loyalty towards dick Goku.</br></br>  <br>They let Gohan take the spot light once. And look what happened to him.<br><br>The only other character to do that is Arale. And no one dares mess around her neighborhood.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they all did learn the Kaioken but we just don't see them use it, like when Goku used the times 10 against Frieza.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they would have used it at least once during the next arc.<br><br>And we knew Goku was using x10 against Freeza because Kaio told us that it was happening</br></br></br>  Dragon Ball is retarded.<br><br>Why won't they wish to make everybody immortal. Thus they won't need to care if anyone stronger comes by.</br></br>  <br>That would be using the Dragon Balls for personal means which is something they really don't do.<br><br>Also, Goku and Vegeta would hate being immortal</br></br></br>  Why doesn't Shenlong just protect himself if he's powerful enough to grant wishes?  <br> Turles is Goku universe 6 counterpart <br>Fucking OK with this.</br></br>  How cute is Videl is Super?  <br>in Super*</br>  <br>meh, too waifu-y.</br>  <br>It was probably SSJ2 but the Animators/Toryiama forgot that SSJ2 has Lightning</br>  <br>QUALITY VEGETA!</br>  <br>Kek. This delusion</br>  <br> Scene literally in motion <br> QUALITY <br>/a/ people</br></br></br>  <br>Pig tail Videl or Short hair Videl?</br>  <br><br>It's not that SS1 Vegeta is stronger than SS3 Goku. It's just that Saiyans can temporarily become stronger when they're really angry. Remember when gohan fucked Vegeta's shit up in the Saiyan saga cause he got angry?</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Vegeta already weakened from Goku AND getting his tail cut off?</br>  I've always wondered, is Vegeta or Goku stronger in the time period before the time chamber when they both achieve super sayian?<br>Assuming Goku isn't handicapped and Vegeta didn't get the shit knocked out of him for a free power boost from 18? Or where they still getting zenkai at that point?</br>  <br>Vegeta was implied stronger.</br>  <br>Yeah, but the point is that normally gohan wouldn't be able to put a scratch on vegeta even in his weakened state but his anger made it possible.</br>  <br>I don't like her hairstyle but I think her and Gohan make a really adorable couple. She's also very kind to Goten and Trunks.</br>  So about Revival of F. If Freeza's men didn't expect him to be able to become stronger, why did they want to revive him when they had that red horned guy who could beat up Piccolo?  I admit its been years since I watched the early years, but I can't seem to remember...<br><br>When did Gohan learn how to fly?</br></br>  <br> Krillin <br> human </br></br>  <br>6 month training with piccolo probably</br>  <br><br> Revival of F <br><br>Friggin retcon...<br><br><br><br>Sounds about right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Picolo thought him while training him in prerparation for the Saiyan invasion.</br>  <br>when he train with piccolo</br>  <br><br> Piccolo and Goku killed Raditz  <br> Goku beat Nappa <br> Gohan, Kuririn, and Yajirobe beat Vegeta  <br> Goku and Vegeta beat Ginyu  <br> Goku beats Freeza  <br> Vegeta beats #19 and #20 <br> Cell beats #17 and #18 <br> Gohan beats Cell  <br> Goku and Vegeta beat Boo <br><br>While Goku is the main character, it's not nearly as one-sided as you're implying.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Future trunks also killed frieza.</br>  So is Vegeta the second strongest protagonist in the series? As in stronger than Mr. Buu now?  <br>When was he implied to be stronger other than by himself? <br>He only took out 19 who Goku was beating pretty good until his heart gave out.</br></br>  <br> It's just that Saiyans can temporarily become stronger when they're really angry. <br>Yeah, that's why I said it was for a few seconds. I never said that "Yes Vegeta is stronger than Goku forever". <br><br>And he was going higher than Goku in those few seconds because he was tanking a punch from Beerus when Goku went out with just a flick to the head and a chop to the neck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IIRC Piccolo implied it.</br>  <br> Goku had two fights in the Android Saga <br> He lost both </br></br>   Masenko-ha <br> never seen used <br>wish gohan would use it again. I remember him using it in Future Trunks special which was cool but...</br></br>  <br>I don't recall that but I'm not positive.<br>I've got volume 14 of DBZ around here somewhere, I'll go look and come back.</br></br>  <br>I think he used it once in the fight with Dabura.</br>    <br>Why is Piccolo always sweating?</br>  <br>The fans love Vegeta, you idiot.<br>It's Toriyama who never liked him. The "rival" slot was always intended to be Piccolo's, and Toriyama kept powering Piccolo up to make him sort of relevant. But Vegeta had to fill the role because readers wanted it.<br>If Vegeta looked bad in shit like GT or the movies, it's because Goku is the hero and eventually has to win.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I liked Masenko even if it was just "yellow ki blast", it was still his homage to Piccolo</br>  <br>And here it's less implied and more explicitly stated</br>  <br> Toriyama never liking Vegeta <br>That was back in like 1995. Now he says if he makes another movie, he wants Vegeta to take more of the spotlight</br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't he get his ass kicked shortly after?</br></br>  <br>Yes, but he's fighting 18 who is stronger than Super Saiyans at that point</br>  <br>Because he's wearing heavy clothes.</br>  <br>does tori hate Gohan? or did he forget that Gohan is powerful?</br>  <br>He likes Gohan just fine probably, he just decided that he wasn't suited to being the main character. In a show about fighting the main character kind of needs incentive to fight.</br>  <br> And then the Cell arc ended. Did you think that everyone felt you would put Gohan into the leading role? <br>I intended to put Gohan into the leading role. It didn’t work out. I felt that compared to Goku, he was ultimately not suited for the part.<br><br> (Personally, what I think he's really saying is that Gohan stopped being popular once he became the main charactter) </br></br></br></br>  It's more then just Vegeta.<br><br>Pretty much no character but Goku was allowed to have any victory in the series.<br><br>And I'm pretty sure it was due to editorial interference because Toriyama kept trying to put other characters in the spotlight, but it never worked out.<br><br>For instance, what was the point of all those training arcs for the other characters before Vegeta and Nappa came to earth <br><br>It's not like they couldn't have had Goku fight the main baddie anyways. Why not, for instance, have Nappa just barely be beaten at a great cost (all the characters who died still die), and then just as Vegeta's about to get serious and jump in, *then* have Goku show up?<br><br>This way at the very least none of the other cast looks *useless.*<br><br>Same with the other arcs. Let the minons go down with the rest of the cast, but the big bad has to be taken down by Goku.<br><br>I liked the Garlic Jr. filler arc just because it allowed for the rest of the cast to be the heroes for once.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Vegeta's kill record:<br> Saibaman (x1) <br> Nappa <br> Cui <br> Dodoria <br> Apul <br> Zarbon <br> Helpless Namekian villagers <br> A bunch of nameless Freeza soldiers <br> Guldo <br> Recoome (after Goku beat the shit out of him) <br> Burter (after Goku beat the shit out of him) <br> Jeice <br> A bunch of helpless tournament watchers <br><br>Also bug people in that one filler episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To protect is just as good as "i liek fighting". <br>Gohan will probably get his moment or two, but obviously is left behind in the grand scheme of things. I don't think Super is going to last long enough to have a serious arc where Gohan can get up anywhere near Goku and Vegeta.<br><br>I hope Universe 6 has a Gohan that kept training</br></br></br></br>  <br>This kind of fails when you remember that Goku wasn't even the one who beat Vegeta</br>  I always thought it was funny how DBZ's second OP was clearly geared to believing Gohan and his high school stuff was going to be the main story from now on and then they never changed it. Compare Z's Boo saga OP to Kai's<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QSO<wbr>jj8Q_9b4</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=b6Y<wbr>ocAEsxFU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  You know, it's funny. Sometimes, Gohan acts like he enjoys a good fight every now and then. He just doesn't really care at all for training.  <br><br> wasn't suited for main <br> didn't like to fight <br> whats called character development  <br>its all about character popularity and Tori's laziness/not enough time to make Gohan develop farther since people didn't want to see a new guy. plus its easier to write a character with the same personality than have a character grow even farther.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan got to kill Cell.</br>  <br>You forgot the alien from the planet with TEN TIMES THE EARTH'S GRAVITY, and you forgot Vegeta.</br>  <br>Didn't Planet Vegeta also have ten times Earth's gravity?<br><br>Also Kaio's planet?</br></br></br>  Why the fuck are they retelling the last 2 movies, I don't wanna sit twice through shit I just watched. Fucking hell, this shit pisses me off so much I wanna kill that retard Toriyama myself.  <br>Earth is pretty wimpy on the gravity scale.<br><br>Maybe that's why human's are useless babbys in the DB universe.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Also this weird thing</br></br>      <br> its all about character popularity <br>Well yeah, that's what I said</br></br>      <br> bottom right <br>Who?</br></br>      <br> Gets to fuck Bulma <br><br>Nigga, Vegeta already achieved the greatest victory.</br></br></br>  <br>anyone who got a slice of bulma is a winner in my book</br>  <br><br>The movies not canon? I call bullshit.</br></br>  Goku never won against Vegeta technically Gohan and Kirin beats him in the saiyan saga, in the Buu saga Vegeta ko's Goku, still cheap shot still a victory. GT not canon.  <br> implying she put out for him </br>  <br> Grandpa Gohan <br>Ha</br></br>  <br>He was that alien who found Gohan and Krillin on Namek and broke their ship.</br>  <br> doesn't know Super is retelling BOG/ROF </br>  <br><br>They're just recycling footage from the movie. They aren't changing the story.</br></br>  <br>They've already changed the story by having Beerus be awake 6 months after Buu.</br>  <br> Bulmas birthday is on a boat <br> beerus already awake <br> going recycle </br></br></br>  <br>They are changing the story. We already know they've moved Bulma's birthday party to a cruise ship.</br>  <br><br>Those are just events in the past from the last time Beerus was awake</br></br>  <br><br>No they haven't, stop making shit up</br></br>  <br>nope<br>we already have the titles of episodes 3-5 and they are really redoing the movie<br>beerus has been asleep for 39 years and just woke up recently</br></br></br>  <br><br>Toriyama said the movies were canon<br><br>You are wrong</br></br></br></br>  <br>pic related<br><br>they aren't canon anymore</br></br></br>  <br>toriyama says lots of things.</br>  <br>titles where?</br>  <br>Kibitoshin didn't exist 39 years ago, yet he reacted to Beerus destroying the planet.</br>  <br><br>All this means is that in the movie she was having her party on a cruise ship, just look at it. The stage is set up the same way</br></br>  <br><br>Do you know what time dilation is?</br></br>  <br>Toriyama is too polite to say that Toei is a piece of shit company and nothing that they do makes sense.</br>  <br>did you for get about Kaio-shin then dude thats been around for 1000s of years? the guy who actually saw Buu when he was first made?</br>  <br> Where Does the Dream Continue?! Find Super Saiyan God! <br> Aim for the Dragonballs! Pilaf's big plan! <br> Battle on King Kai's planet! Goku vs Beerus! </br></br></br>  <br>It keeps seeming more and more like there's not going to be a 5 year timeskip and that Super is going to have a new way of creating a Super Saiyan God.</br>  Great that DBS is actually a thing, we will obviously watch every single episode patiently and have tons of threads.<br>When I think about all the doujinshi that will result form this my mind goes woozy. Chichi is best girl.</br>  <br>ChiChi is best girl when a teenager in DragonBall. As of right now 18 is best girl.</br>  <br>You really think so?<br>I prefer mature Chichi.<br>She is so troublesome on screen but I always have this fantasy that she is super sweet to goku whenever they are just by themself. I hope sometime there will be a ridiculously cute vanilla doujinshi with that theme.</br></br></br>  <br>You could argue that Vegeta was stronger than Goku up until he went SSJ. Goku was only stronger in the namek saga because of kaio ken, a technique, not actual strength.</br>  IS there a place to download a non-shitty version of the entire DB manga?

What other anime's live up to its level of sophistication?  Too bad, this is a recommendation thread and will soon be deleted. Also, EVA is entry level shit.   Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br> Himouto Umaru is Godakobo revival <br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> Shimoneta adaptation did not disappoint <br>Prison School... well. No season can be absollutely perfect. Some adaptation had to be an absolute ugly disgusting garbage,</br></br></br></br></br>  Care to elaborate?   jitsu adaption is great    jc staff <br>What did you expect</br>   Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br><br>Stopped reading there, kill yourself.</br></br>  Having read the manga and still actively reading it, I don't want to ruin the image built from it via the anime. Could be a hit or miss  <br>right is better deal with it fuckface</br>  how long will i have to wait for uncensored?  <br>6-7 months for all the eps</br>  I thought I was watching Bakemonogatari for a second with these voice actors.  It's JC Staff, what else did you expect? They always do lackluster adaptations.  <br>the only thing better on the right is the torso:leg ratio</br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br>How much of a faggot could you possibly be?</br></br>  Long awaited new season of Shingeki no Kyoujin  <br>It's not MOE enough.</br>   almost every boy had some kind of role in nichibros <br><br>PICKED THIS SHIT UP</br></br>  <br>Left: deviantart "I draw animes ^_^" quality<br>Right: generic soulless low budget harem anime quality</br></br>   Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br><br>Stopped reading right there.</br></br>  <br>See you guys then!<br><br>fuck japan</br></br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br>did you even watched the shit? did you read the manga?</br></br>  <br>you confused left with right again son</br>  <br>But people are praising Danmachi</br>  <br>A shame the source material from every manga you mentioned sucks balls.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Because barely anybody reads light novels. <br><br>That was a horrendous adaptation too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>they're doing a great job with Shokugeki no Souma though</br></br>  <br> implying you read every source material from every manga he mentioned </br>  <br>Fuck this overreaction!<br><br>The episode was good<br><br>I want the anime becoming popular<br>I want the manga becoming more popular<br>I want Akira Hiramoto becoming ultra popular</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great </br>  <br><br><br><br> Jitsu fans in charge of anything other than circlejerking over their hipster manga and art style </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> fuck japan <br><br> yet consumes massive amounts of their media. </br></br></br></br>  <br>that's a sad attempt of trolling</br>  <br>Isnt this entire thread?</br>  <br>Whatever helps you sleep at night pal.</br>  <br>Well if the anime is bad, but the adaptation is good, that only means that the source is bullshit.</br>  <br>I want Reddit to leave</br>  <br> Well if the anime is bad, but the adaptation is good, <br><br>This literally doesn't make any sense.</br></br></br>  <br> Well if the anime is bad, but the adaptation is good <br>you don't even know what you are talking about</br></br>  WHAT THE FUCK<br>ARE THEY SERIOUSLY CEONSRING THIS SHIT<br>HOLY SHIT<br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br>  <br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br>I am Akagami fag but this is so wrong. I actually afraid they gonna ruin it again.</br></br>  <br>yes, but  was the saddest one I've seen in a while</br>  To be honest I think it's impossible to adapt this manga correctly.  <br> Manchild crying over anime adaptation <br> Calling other posters sad <br>Alright.</br></br></br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great </br>  <br>Hayate S2 was pretty good and that was JC Staff iirc. And I like Shokugeki.</br>  <br>buy the bd gaijin<br> even at showing this anime at 02:00 in the morning they still censor the shit out of it, well fucking done japan </br></br>  <br>fanservice trash with bad art<br>and dropped</br></br>  <br>JC staff has been pretty good in recent years. They were the studio that did the WIXOSS series and that was incredibly well produced.<br><br>I blame the director for this one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Dumb frogposter kill yourself.<br>Fucking cancer of summer.</br></br></br>   Best girl  <br> Kanahana <br>I love it.</br></br>  I think JC Staff did fine on this. The story was totally different than what I thought though. I thought that it actually might have some kind of plot because of the huge following. Instead it is mostly PLOT with S&amp;M shit going on. <br><br>I am not with the whole "let a female beat you up" type thing. Where I come from we slap hoes. Beat the shit outta em.</br></br>  Jitsui wa ep1 WAS good. I am not going to let one shitposter in a Prison School thread change my opinion. It was one episode and the entire adaptation was shit? Fuck You.  im an animeonlyfag why are people hating this  <br><br>You gotta be. Bones is an expert ruining final chapters.</br></br>  <br>read the manga.</br>  <br>Cause they censored it.</br>  <br> I thought that it actually might have some kind of plot because of the huge following <br>read the manga.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with that coloring? Holy fuck, sasuga JC.</br>  <br>the manga art looks fucking shit stop being butthurt because the studio fixed the shitty design</br>  <br>I haven't watched this or read the manga, but the one on the left is clearly better. The one on the right looks like the artists have never seen the manga.</br>    <br>oh okay thought it was about something else</br>  The manga is cheap garbage, so I don't know why everyone is so upset.  <br>It's people who only checked it for the lewdity rather than the story.</br>  <br>my eyes</br>  <br>That's fucking terrifying.</br>  What time does this shit air in Japan?  <br>I think it's a japanese time</br>  <br>yeah one of the most dissapointing first episodes this season</br>  <br>Did they follow this guide?</br>  <br>People got excited because tits. It's also oddly popular, because tits.<br><br>Cheap ecchi shows like prison school aren't exactly made for adapting</br></br></br>  <br>That's a parody image, right? They don't actually all have that exact same face, right?</br>  <br> oddly because tits <br> oddly <br> tits <br>reread the manga, there's nothing odd about being excited over tits</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also oddly popular, because tits. <br>By that logic 99% of all manga would be popular.</br></br>  <br>What's with the mold on their clothes?</br>  <br> bad art <br>Thanks JC Staff for making the adaptation so bad even secondaries are put off.<br><br><br> that finger positioning <br>What the actual fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> parody <br>nope<br> sameface <br>yes</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's also oddly popular, because tits. <br>Good thing nobody watches it for that then.</br></br>  Is this going to be like Highschool DXD where HS was censored and some shitty fansub group got the uncensored version?<br><br>Or am I going to have to wait for the BDs?</br></br>  <br>HS is doing Okusama ga Seitokaichou! uncensored so I guess it's not outside the realm of possibility.<br><br>But seeing as episode one is censored I guess they won't be.</br></br></br>  Why does funimation exist?  So is the manga lewd enough on it's own or should I seek out doujins instead  <br> seek out doujins instead <br><br>Should we tell this newfag or let him find out on his own?</br></br></br>  <br>I almost forgot this is Summer.<br><br>Thanks for reminding me.</br></br></br>  <br> Well if the anime is bad, but the adaptation is good, that only means that the source is bullshit. <br><br>I can't stop laughing here</br></br></br>  <br>I have jacked off to every chapter of phs</br>   Prison School adaption is terrible <br>NO SHUT UP! I DON'T BELIEVE YOU<br><br>I don't want to believe...</br></br></br>  Apart from the stupid censoring I liked it.  <br>This looks like they tried to capture the art style of the manga, when it just doesn't work in motion.</br>    <br>i feel like the author includes titshots because it's gonna be labeled as ecchi anyway so why not. The story itself is compounded with friendship and brotherhood but mostly comedic circumstances</br>  Was the author able to continue his Devil Blues manga? Or was I dreaming?  <br>it's a fine adaptation. Personally I think the story is moving a bit too quickly to follow at times, but that's what the pause/play function is for, I guess.</br>  <br><br>It looks horrible, and it's censored to hell, which defeats the whole point of a fanservice show. Pure garbage.</br></br>  are you guys kidding? the adaption was fine  <br>Just wait for the BDs, jesus christ. Did you ACTUALLY think the should would be uncensored? Are you that retarded?</br>  Hey, fucking idiots... News flash! AT-X version will be out in 2 days which will be uncensored. Calm your tits.   fat guy has the smallest penis <br><br>This is discriminating actually<br><br>FUCK YOU</br></br></br></br>  adaptations of shit are shit.<br>this season is fucked.</br>  Why didn't they go for 24 episodes? Because of money?  <br><br><br>assburgers detected.<br><br>by "good," he means "faithful."<br><br>this isn't hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>probably<br>im surprised this even got adapted in the first place</br></br>  <br>Was it confirmed?</br>  <br>Holy shit, I couldn't een tell that was Andre, I thought it was a close up of Jo until I saw him to the right</br>  <br>Then you could've wrote "faithful" instead of "good" my ipchangingburgerlandnewfriend</br>  <br><br>The censorship is the tip of the iceberg. In addition, Monmusu is airing fully uncensored, and is as graphic as this.</br></br>  <br>Can you elaborate on what you mean?</br>   a shitty manga that only sales because of tits has a shitty adaptation because nippons can't animate the female body properly <br><br>What a surprise</br></br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>But that's a worldwide fact<br>Stay mad fat guy</br></br>  Just like with DxD, they were releasing AT-X versions (uncensored) a few days after. You don't have to wait for the BD versions.  <br>I actually read Prison School so the ugly ass anime is a plus. Secondaryfags won't be shitting up the discussion.</br>  <br> that only sales because of tits <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;IMPLYING <br><br>Why don't you, ya know, actually read the manga instead of assuming like a dumbass? The art is godlike and Akira really knows how to draw girls in some sexy ways but the story is actually good and funny, better than most shit out there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Danmachi wasn't a good adaptation. It just looks nice.</br>  <br> inb4 muh muh Tsutomu Mizushima is the best director in the industry, everything he touches is gold. <br><br>People need to stop sucking this dude's dick</br></br></br>  <br>I heard the manga went into more depth on it's mmo/rpg like elements but for a short anime adaption, it's fair to cut that out since they just want to get through the story</br>  The art is probably more than half the manga's charm<br>This is going to suck</br>   &gt;Monster Masume adaptation is godlike  <br><br>It's not hard to please people with shitty harem fan service tastes.</br></br>  <br>You're right but the anime seems better than the source material so far</br>  <br> manga <br><br>It's actually the LN, but it really needed that depth for Bell's character. Without it he's just another gary stu with random asspull powerups.</br></br></br>  <br>Well is hard to be worse than a plotless, fanservice, selfinsert manga.</br>  <br>we don't write to please esl's, faggot.</br>  is there some place good to download the manga  <br>I heard google is a good start</br>  <br>google hmmmm ill have to look into this</br>  <br>I love you anon</br>   Gay Shit Staff  <br>what did you expect</br>  <br>They're usually good at comedy.</br>  I'm only on Chapter 22 of Prison School manga but the art is fucking fantastic, I don't even know if you could copy that over in anime to such details.  It was too rushed. Every character was talking as if it had a stick up of his ass. A good comedy needs fucking pauses,you don't slap every joke after the other.<br> inb4 chapters lax of content <br>They nearly adapted a whole fucking volume of material.</br></br>      <br>Maki a fucking piece of shit.</br>  <br> unironically hating best raibu </br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br><br>Not great.  Anime of the season </br></br></br>  The first episode was great, what fuck are you on about  It wasn't bad at all, it felt rushed but the pace should be slower in the next episodes  Yall have to be kidding me right? Yall actually thought this show would be uncensored? They censor nipples and that's not a big deal. Hell I haven't laugh this hard in a very long time. This show is perfect. JC Staff is on a role. The manga is great the anime is great. Love the adaptation   Light <br> Beams <br>They got us good.<br><br>Also, really uninspired work from the VAs. This is going to flop.</br></br></br></br>  I don't care if it's censored to hell or looks like shit. I'm going to watch it for glorious Kamiya MC and angry bitch HanaKana  <br> uninspired work from the VAs <br>Good post anon but let's try that post again without the dicks in your mouth.</br></br>  Fanservice aside, I think JC staff really nailed the comedy parts. I chuckled quite a bit.  <br><br>Ye I thought it was pretty funny</br></br>  <br>I find it hot</br>  <br> Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br>Good joke.<br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br>Almost had me there.<br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> adaptation <br> Bones anime </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  well /a/?

It's just the style they went with.</br>  <br> calling somebody a virgin on /a/ <br>Hello, Summerfriend.</br></br>  <br>I'm a virgin myself but tits don't work like that</br>  Feels rushed. I didnt laugh once  <br> now im downloading all the chapters to the manga <br>Good on you. Get ready for great art and I hope you have a lot of tissues to spare</br></br>  <br>This is not a comedy.</br>  Atleast it's funnier than Gintama.  <br>Those faces are scary</br>  <br>Both have different kinds of humour though, don't they? I haven't watched Gintama but I remember reading the first 4 volumes a long time ago and thought it was pretty funny but I wouldn't say it's humour is anywhere similar to Prison Schools</br>  <br>what is it then</br>  <br>A deconstruction of the ecchi harem genre</br>  <br>it is, my animeonly summerfriend</br>   Jitsuwa Watashi Wa adaptation is great <br> Monster Musume adaptation is godlike <br> Himouto Umaru is Godakobo revival <br> Akagami no Shirayuki is best Bones anime of all times <br> Shimoneta adaptation did not disappoint <br><br>All this fucking delusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> expecting ecchi shit to be good <br><br>LOL</br></br></br>  <br>Compared to the manga? Yes, faggot. Read the manga</br>  I'm I the only one who reads Prison School for the antics and happenings? The tits and ass are a plus but if it were censored I wouldn't even give a shit as long as the story and characters stay likable.   Prison School <br> Shoukugeki <br><br>Why is JC so based?</br></br></br>  <br>It was doomed to fail. There's just no way any animation company would have the balls to do what needed to be done to adapt this spiritually and practically.</br>  <br>No, you're not. I like the characters very much.</br>  <br> 4chan browswe <br> Actual consumer <br><br>NOPE</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're not the only one. I first read it for the tits but was pleasantly surprised by the top tier comedy and story progression. All the characters besides Chiyo are actually pretty good.</br>  <br>Yeah i can't get enough of Andre and his fucking face, it blows my sides</br>   VP beats the shit out of MCs mercilessly <br> "No, licking your boot is too much" <br> She actually backs down </br></br>  <br>this show and manga are SHIT</br>  <br> Secondaries </br>  <br>Is this pic from this manga?<br>I was always curious about this pic but never asked about it before.</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  That first episode felt really rushed, It's been ages but didn't they just burn through a good couple of chapters?  <br>No, you're not. I couldn't give two shits. It baffles me how maybe 20 seconds of steam and white light is ruining the other 24 minutes for some people.</br>  <br> Monmusu is airing fully uncensored <br>It isn't<br><br>There is still slight censors</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love how clever the series can get at times, Some of the scenes where Kiyoshi has his monologues are amazing.<br>I loved that scene where Kiyoshi has to discreetly pass the phone to the president.</br></br>  <br>It is comfrimed? 12 episodes means is going to be shit no matter how you look at it, they going to adapt around 8 chapters into 1 episode.</br>  <br> It baffles me how maybe 20 seconds of steam and white light is ruining the other 24 minutes for some people. <br> Many are watching just for those 20 seconds. </br></br>  <br>Not that guy, but I'd take Monmusu's unobtrusive censoring method over lightbeams any day of the fucking week.</br>  <br><br>and the colors and apparently the art style, personally I enjoy it even though they change some few stuff I wasn't bother by the censor. <br><br>I'm here for the laughs, the fanservice is just a big bonus for me.</br></br></br></br>  If this is 12 episodes and expected to end at their release boy oh boy is it going to rushed as a motherfucker.  <br> Watching a series just for fanservice </br>  <br>For obvious things like pussy. I still saw nipple though.</br>  For what I read, it's going to air uncensored in 2 days right? Though AT-X been shit for most of series this season, why is that?  <br> secondaries <br>nice meme<br>why dont you go back to reddit</br></br></br>  <br>Where do you think this is? You'd have to be blind to miss the fact that every poster on this site and their dog will watch a show just for a bit of fanservice.</br>  <br> Watching a series just for fanservice <br>You have to be fuking me, I love the series but you don't seriously believe people don't watch some stuff just for fanservice do you?</br></br>  Other than the censoring I think it looks pretty okay. <br><br>Sometimes they look like porcelain but it's not as bad as I thought it'd be.</br></br>  The coloring is actually total dogshit. Look at the clothes, why is it that they can't decide if it should have a fade or not? Same with the faces. <br><br>Also the pacing was really fucking bad. They are going to shove like 80ish chapters into 1 cour.</br></br>  <br><br>Decide already.</br></br>  <br>I know people do, but that's a really fucking stupid reason to watch a series.</br>  <br>Prison school is so over the top in its sexuality that I've managed to completely ignore it at this point and only read it because it's funny as shit.<br><br>I never got the appeal of hyper ecchi anyway since at that point just watch some shitty hentai.</br></br></br>  <br> fucking stupid reason to watch a series. <br>Why is it stupid?</br></br>  <br>yeah so far i fucken love the characters and how they interact cant wait for more eps.</br>  <br>Because wasting your time watching an entire series for maybe a few minutes of fanservice throughout it is retarded</br>  <br>That's not really "stupid", At least no more so than watching cartoons for hours on end each day.<br>Watching anime doesn't really have much pay off anyway just watch whatever the fuck you want for whatever reason you want dude.</br></br>  <br>Those two posts are saying the same thing. Reading comprehension, anon.</br>   ecchi shit <br><br>If you watch this garbage you are the cancer killing anime</br></br>  <br>I really can not for the life of me figure out why they decided to color it like that...why couldn't they just go with your typical fucking flat colors? It would look so much better like that</br>  why do some of the MCs sound so autistic?  <br>It's ecchi with a legitimate good story, good characters, good progression, and good humour. The ecchi is just a bonus you fucking retard.</br>  <br>How does one sound autistic</br>  <br> implying I give a shit about the state of anime anymore </br>   A fanservice show that focuses on a bunch of guys <br><br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br> A fanservice show that focuses on a bunch of guys in an entire school full of girls* </br>  <br>It won't be uncensored on AT-X. It doesn't have the same notice that uncensored shows get.<br><br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>6206 (※視聴年齢制限あり※)<br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>5336 (※視聴年齢制限あり※)<br>http://www.at-x.com/program/detail/<wbr>6521</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about the rest of you, but after watching the episode I wasn't that bothered by the coloring. I think it looks OK in motion, it's when everything is still that it looks like ass.</br>  <br>It's not god awful it's just a really strange thing to do for seemingly no reason</br>  chaos dragon was better than this shit, the manga of course is fucking excellent but i cannot pretend that this adaptation isnt complete shit  <br>CD is better than a lot of shows: overlord, rokka, prison school, LN harem #2, gakkou gurashi, shimoneta</br>    So, we getting around 8 chapters per episode? And you people worried about the censorship??  If they break out of prison by episode 12 that's around 7 chapters per episode, they ended this episode in the middle of chapter 6<br><br>Which means unless they skip some chapters or something, the pacing will be this fast every episode</br></br>  Honestly I really enjoyed the first episode. It could have been better visually but otherwise I think it did the job well.<br><br>I do have similar worries to a lot of anons with the pacing. I think for the early chapters this breakneck pace is fine, but I think having 5/6 chapters per episode later on could ruin it.</br></br>  <br> I love how clever the series can get at times, Some of the scenes where Kiyoshi has his monologues are amazing. <br><br> Him laughing just because the prez told him to was gold.  </br></br></br>  There were a few funny moments but they've destroyed the pacing so badly. Even basic things like conversations had horrible pacing, nevermind the fact that we're already so far in the story. They're probably planning to wrap the whole thing up in a season.  <br>I was hoping that the ridiculous pacing was just so they could get into the prison quick and start the main story so people wouldn't drop it after the first episode but there wasn't a need to rush Hana's introduction so I don't think that's the case sadly :/<br><br>I'll probably give it 2 more episodes to see if the pacing changes because a few things were still funny in there.</br></br></br>  This really doesn't look anywhere near as good as the manga.<br><br>And it's being censored.<br><br>Honestly I'm not even sure if I feel like downloading.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And it's being censored. <br>What did you fucking expect? When was the last tv anime that had tits uncensored? Are you fucking retarded?</br></br>  While it did feel kinda rushed, the comedy was there and it was really enjoyable. Maybe the fact that I've alredy read the manga influences my reaction to it though  <br>I genuinely don't understand what's so bad about this image.<br>The sameface is atrocious but the rest is above average.</br></br>  <br>The colors and art style look fine though don't they?<br>The censorship is bad but other than that seems fine.</br></br>   it doesn't look as good as the manga <br>no fucking shit, that would be borderline impossible<br>it's still probably going to be AOTS and a contender for AOTY, just because it's still much better than any other anime coming out</br></br>  <br>how about you read the manga, stupid</br>  <br> No Sugita <br><br>I miss Jack.  I miss Nichibros so bad. <br><br>School boys SoL&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;shit&gt;&gt;&gt;School girls SoL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, it looks fucking cheap compared to Danmachi or Souma. It's like JC didn't even care to give it a good budget. It has horrible animation too.</br>  Andres voice is terribad, besides that this is fantastic.  <br>Does somebody knows what happened to Me and the Devil Blues? That shit was amazing.</br>  <br>Well haven't seen it yet, only judging by the pictures posted in this thread but I don't see anything particularly bad with the colors.</br>  <br>what kind of shitty filter did JC use, jesus this looks bad or is this intentional since Prison School is supposed to be a trashy show?</br>  It's awful but Kana Hanazawa  I fucking hope they add all the close-ups to the Blu ray  Fuck, only 6 BDs? So it's going to be one cour and rushed as fuck. Nice knowing you Prison School.  <br>what's wrong with you /a/, this was easily a 10/10 first episode. no, I'm not trying to bait. the manga is 11 or 12/10 though</br>  <br>Pretty much. When I read all the complaints I thought the censoring was much worse, but it was just in the close ups.</br>  <br>Let him learn anon. He must learn.<br><br> Either that or spread the glory of daigo. I swear you just have to pretend veep grew up and wants to fug her kid then this doujin works </br></br></br>  <br>You got that right. Just watched the episode 1, what a horrible pacing like the show was on crack or something. Well young jump adaptions are doomed to fail one way or another</br>  <br>I don't even understand why people are so obsessed with the censoring. The scenes were not cut and will be available in the bd edition later on. The truth is this episode was genuinely funny, unlike most other series where gags are so forced that watching becomes awkward</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>AT-X is another channel or distribution system or whatever that releases uncensored shows. Shows that required the nudity for obvious reasons. <br><br>People are pissed prison school gets censored since it's one of the biggest factors of the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Wow jc staff do uncensor. So it's great then.</br>  <br>It's just a cheap gimmick, while the fanservice is great, it's not the main reason you should be watching Prison School. It actually has a good story, good characters, and good themes underneath the facade of trashiness it displays.</br>  <br>So people are bitching for no reason then? Just wait like two days if you want it uncensored?<br><br>People are fucking retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the thing, AT-X will NOT be showing this uncensored for some reason. You literally have to wait for the BDs.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I agree. I read it for the comedy I'm probably gonna watch this censored just so I can keep up to date.</br>  <br>But then why is it being shown on that channel?</br>  <br>I guess for people who miss the initial broadcast on whatever channel it was first aired on?</br>  I enjoyed it. It's been a while since anything's made me laugh an actual laugh.<br><br>I love this guy's voice.</br></br>  <br>Well, that was disappointing, dropped</br>  Why's everyone complaining about the pacing? I didn't see a single thing that was cut from the manga, and aside from not being able to match the god tier drawings it was pretty much on point exactly. Not to mention the fact that I like how it's moving at a good clip. Not much happens per chapter.  http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87 <br><br> 100+ years old <br> still looking relatively youthful and able to fight hordes of vampires with his students and easily dispatch them <br> can heal people using his ripple <br> can see the future of people using his ripple <br><br>Were all subsequent ripple users shit because they were selfish and didn't maintain their training into old age? Also did Tonpetty have a stand? Because the healing other via touch (not like how zeppli unlocked the ripple in johnathan and his ripple healed him) and future reading seems completely out of line with the Ripple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  first for wanting to eat hot pants' ass  <br>The Ripple is JoJo's Hokuto Shinken.</br>  <br> Were all subsequent ripple users shit because they were selfish and didn't maintain their training into old age? <br>The only other Ripple users we saw last into old age were Straits and Joseph. Straits tried his best, but just wasn't as talented as Tonpetty, while Joseph just got outright lazy because there was no reason for him to train his use of the Ripple for 50 years after Cars.<br><br>One could argue though that Hermit Purple's power partially drew itself from Joseph's Ripple, so he did get the "seeing the future" ability in the end.</br></br></br></br>  Jotaro is the best JoJo imo tbh.  Stupid question, but what would you guys like to see in future JoJo installments?<br><br>personally,  i kinda wanna see Ripple return. maybe not for the full part, but just have it there. </br></br>  <br> Jotaro <br> Best Jojo </br></br>  <br>Not a Jotarofag but, why do you post the worst Jojo?<br>Jolyne didn't protect a damn thing</br></br>  <br> Trashes on Jotaro <br> Posts a picture of the   second best  JoJo<br><br>Fuck off, nigger</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? Why does anyone like the ripple?</br>  <br>Most underrated Jojo on /a/ along with Jonathan</br>  <br>Part 3 Jotaro was the worst ever.<br><br>After that though I started liking him more and more. I guess he's just one of those guys who works better on the sidelines.</br></br></br>  <br>Does that mean all true ripple masters have Hermit purple?<br><br>Was Tonpetty a stand user?</br></br></br>  Dead franchise.  <br>not Lisa Lisa too?</br>  <br>Why? He was awesome.</br>  Jojos in one sentence.<br><br><br>Johnathan: Moralfag gentleman kenshiro<br><br>Joseph: Buff human Bugs Bunny<br><br>Jotaro: School delinquent Kenshiro<br><br>Josuke: Sweet boy on the outside, straight hustler on the inside<br><br>Giorno: Gold Experience punched a brick wall and gave it life.

There was a bad guy coming, he was after me, and using some weird liquid I trapped his Stand in a part of the house and left him there.<br><br>There was a very weird part of the house, everyone was told to not go there but some kids went in anyway, it was a smal room wih a big virgin Mary statue, if you stared at it long enough you would lose control of your body and then wander around the house telling people to not go to that room and leave the house in a very spooky way.<br><br>Some time passed and I was chilling with my crew and one of those cursed virgin mary kids came up to us so we knocked him out.<br><br>Just after that, some dude in a trench coat, looking very menacing, walked by a door no one really uses. I have seen this guy before he had a fucked up ability, if you stared into his evil eyes he would give you an order and you would have to follow it no matter what or you will die.<br><br>I told my crew to get out of the house and go to a big house across the street where some event was being held. We went there and chilled for a while, but before I realized it, that Stand user we were running away from was there, this guy can sense when someone looks at him so I cant even look at him to check his position.<br><br>My crew was gone so I went looking for them, but some dude grabbed me by the back. I tried to call out my Stand but nothing happened, thats when I realized the dude grabbing me, was the enemy Stand user, to not look at his eyes I started to call for help and a nearby cop noticed me, but did nothing. The enemy Stand user was disguised as a cop. He grabbed my head and made me look at his eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I thought aqua necklace could only turn into different liquids? How did it turn into a brandy logo?  <br>The logo is made of wax, which is a very viscous liquid.</br>  <br>It's fun. not as fun as Stands but still fun.</br>  <br>I had sleep paralysis once and I felt some spooky girl behind me trying to suck my soul and drag me to hell. <br><br>Since I was so used to sleep paralysis though, it wasn't such a big deal to me. <br><br>Stardust Crusaders final ep came out that night so I just focused my thoughts on Star Platinum beating up the spooky girl and so it came out of my body and did just that, in the dream. It was pretty rad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Lali ho!!  </br>  <br>I honestly disagree. Any power that can shoot the cap off of a coke bottle, make water into a solid, allow you to stick to walls, transmit the power of the sun, break through rocks and walls, mind control/give people incredible strength, create a force field out of hair, redirect lazer beams, create a hangglider out of stone, let you walk on water, shoot out bubble beams, and probably a bunch of other stuff that I'm forgetting is far too vague and powerful. Ripple users never figure out how to use their power in creative, fun ways. They just create new powers.</br>  <br>Did it yell ORAORAORAORA?</br>  <br>Well, fuck<br><br><br>Yeah, ended up destroying my cabinet with his punch barrage too. Good thing it wasn't real.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Tonpetty was over a hundred years old.</br>  <br>She has one objective: Leave the prison. After that, Pucci was just icing. Icing that she never got to enjoy, but icing nonetheless. But, in terms of being a badass and fucking niggas up, Jolyne was top-tier.</br>  Isn't there some sort of Jojo event going on today in japan?  if there's a part 9 jojo protagonist, what names do you think will be picked? would it be a japanese name, or will he go with a western name?  <br> on /a/ along with Jonathan <br><br>A lot of anons like Jonathan here.</br></br></br>  <br>African<br><br>Jomutambe Jokembe</br></br></br>  <br>Jolyne also had the weakest stand of all main jojos (not counting Joseph).<br><br>While CD and SP were massively strong, GE and S&amp;W have ambigous power that can work whatever way they want, and tusk act 4 is almost instawin, stone free had to go part 2 Joseph and be creative with her skill set</br></br></br>  <br>I'd surprisingly be ok with this I think</br>  <br><br>Araki has already stated in an interview that part nine protagonist's name is Costelo Matias</br></br>  Have a Sad image<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BUR<wbr>9e0gbTao</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>it would be different atleast</br>  <br>shouldn't that be coffee-flavored bubblegum instead of doggie treats? <br><br><br>you're joking right? right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lisa Lisa was still alive when DIO resurfaced anon.</br>  <br> shouldn't that be coffee-flavored bubblegum instead of doggie treats? <br>first image I found, sorry.</br></br>  Is there anyone else is manga or anime that can write characters as well as Araki?  <br>Because he is a non-entity that barely does anything does and speaks even less.<br><br>For me it makes up for the intense spotlight on Joseph in Part 2 while everyone else just existed to get screwed over. Still, can't like Jotaro because there isn't much he gives off to like in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br> ishida <br> togashi <br> miura <br>I dont know if as good but I think they're pretty top tier</br></br></br></br>  <br> an't like Jotaro because there isn't much he gives off to like in the first place. <br>I got it<br> his stand <br> his fashion sense <br> his daughter <br> his job <br> his grampa </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127880943   <br><br>Thank you.</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127880943 <br>what was tusk ability again? shit was so ugly that i forgot about it.</br></br>  <br>I'd say Miura compares but he only wrote a few top tier characters, whereas Araki pumps them out with incredible consistency. Togashi is great but out of all of his characters I think only Hisoka is as good as the best Jojo characters. For Ishida I don't see what's special about Bleach characters.</br>  <br>I'm saying character-wise.<br>Throughout most of his life he just sits in the back until Araki calls him up for a fight, which then afterward he goes to sit in the back then.<br><br>Doing what? I don't know. Studying starfish I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Johny is standing <br>Shit pic</br></br>  <br><br>http://jojo.wikia.com/wiki/Tusk</br></br>  <br>At the end he can walk, so its legit</br>  <br>Act 1 - Shoot fingernails<br>Act 2 - He makes a hole that moves to it's target<br>Act 3 - He can shoot himself to move his body in the holes.<br>Act 4 - Infinite spin (not affected by time stop or dimensions)</br></br></br></br>  <br>INFINITE SPIN! Which raises the question; What would happen if Act 4 got pierce by an Arrow?</br>  <br>Why could he walk again? Was there any reason or was it just because kek happy ending?</br>  <br>And what can Echoes do? the wiki is way to vague on it.</br>  <br>He became a master in spin, and one of the uses of spin is healing</br>  <br> Hermit purple <br> weak stand <br>Like, seriously?</br></br></br>  <br>Act 1 - Produce sound on touch<br>Act 2 - Just a stronger version of act 1 and much faster<br>Act 3 - Affect a small area to be pressured down to the ground with extreme force</br></br></br>  <br> For Ishida I don't see what's special about Bleach characters. <br>is that a joke? thats the mangaka for tokyo ghoul.<br><br><br>I got nothing you're right</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this continuity doesn't seem to have arrows so probably the closest thing is for Tusk to get fisted by Jesus</br>  <br>I think he can shoot them out too.</br>  <br>how do you go from sound ability to gravity?</br>  <br>「Fate」</br>    <br>Act1- Paste a Onomatopoeia that plays the sound that represents<br><br>Act2- Paste a Onomatopoeia that creates the effect of the sound (Paste a BOING in the ground, and if you touch it, you bounce). Only one at a time<br><br>Act 3- Can use "Freeze", that increases the weight of the target the more cloce the user is from the target (Min Range: 5 meters)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Paste a Onomatopoeia that creates the effect of the sound <br><br>What would happen if you put in 'SPLOOSH'?</br></br></br>  <br>and if Echoes got a fourth act, what would it do?<br><br>Splendid, but what ability would that give it? It already has Infinite Spin, what comes next?</br></br></br>  <br>Water appears and a turd falls on it.</br>  <br>You can swim through the Pasted surface.</br>  tusk is one of the worst stand designs araki has come up with even worse than pucci's stand final form.  <br> Bukkake: the stand <br><br>But what would 'REWIND' do?</br></br></br>  <br>your next post will be "Arakis new idea are soooo unoriginal."</br>  <br>Is it worse than Kraft Work, though?</br>  <br>I think it's brilliant, it has  chain-nail  armor and uses the stars that Johnny has.</br>  Did this guy rip off Kakyoin?  Arakis new idea are soooo unoriginal.<br><br><br>N-NANI?!</br></br></br>  <br>Tusk Requiem would manifest as a horse so that super spin is available at any time. Further more, being Johnny's own spirit the synchronization of the the horses rhythm is infinitely perfect.

Kiss is also fucking hideous.</br>  <br>What, you don't like horse head dick?</br>  <br>I actually liked MIH, shit looked cash, I just didnt understnad why araki made it look like he was try to ride a real horse? kiss was...part 6 bad.</br>  <br>What<br>I really like those two stands, MiH actually has a design that easily tells you what it does, while Kiss is just alright, there's nothing wrong with it but its power is great and underused</br></br>  <br>Part 6 is the worst part. Jotaro jobs to a CD stand? Fuck off.</br>  <br>Horsecock was great, KISS did look pretty bad.</br>  <br>Anything to the power zero is 1, doofus.</br>  <br>Whitesnake is OP as fuck, it has many more abilities than just the CD shit<br><br><br>I thought kiss looked pretty good</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even Infinity?</br>  <br> Also did Tonpetty have a stand? Because the healing other via touch (not like how zeppli unlocked the ripple in johnathan and his ripple healed him) and future reading seems completely out of line with the Ripple. <br><br>I thought the healing touch was just a better Ripple technique, whereas Zeppeli's gut-punch was the quick and dirty version to get Jojo ready for action.</br></br></br>  I want to hug DIO.  <br><br>I'll never understand how Act 3 was the final evolution of the previous acts given what ability it has.<br><br>That and I'll never understand how Koichi can use whichever he wants when it showed his stand was growing into the other Acts while the previous Act was left as an empty husk. If it did something like, say, transform like a Transformer or some shit I'd understand. As it is I'm just left confused.</br></br></br></br>  <br>JogJog's Bizarre Adventure<br><br>Set in caveman times</br></br></br>  <br>At least it's consistent with Tusk</br>    <br>Could be worse, could be Echoes Requiem</br>  <br>Splendid! Pic Related Is A Stand User! What Happens!</br>  <br>When I binge read the first four Parts I had tons of dreams on the nights of the day I've been reading. Even now I sometimes get them. It was especially weird at the time because I only read the manga. I didn't think my dreams could animate still art like comics. I mean, I didn't have any point of reference for my brain to conjure up animated movement.<br><br>I don't remember what any of the Stands were. Nothing official I think. And I can only remember what one could do. I think it was... getting people to tell the truth by making them fall ill to virus that makes them speak. Not special or super crazy, but it's the only one I can remember.<br><br>For a non-Stand related Jojo dream, I remember going into this jolly, super-kid friendly inside amusement part, where I had to fight Dio in the horror movie-esque, huge basement floor below. Being a normal nobody in this dream, to face him I went in using "Spray On Vampire". It was liquid in a spray bottle that gave me the powers of a vampire until sunrise when the liquid would instantly dry up. It was like some shit straight out of Doraemon. I don't remember how it ended...</br></br></br></br></br>  Some artists' album covers already resemble something out of JoJo. Pic is Dj Okiwari's Kaleidoscope album.  First time drawing Midler. Her design is so inconsistent between the game and Arakis interpretations...  <br>thanks for posting this m8</br>  <br>Bop Alloy also fits this category</br>  <br>fantastic<br><br> If u taking request i want a Diego please <br><br> it's my birthday </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Looks good, i'd fuck her.</br>  <br>I'd like to see both Hamon and Spin in the next part but Araki's the type that never has his ideas wear out their stay. It's always a fresh concept with him, the only exclusion are Stands since their appearances and abilities are so varied and unique.<br><br> except for STA PLATINOOM and ZA WARUDO  </br></br></br>  <br>What would Bop Alloy's power be?</br>  <br> I'd like to see both Hamon and Spin in the next part <br>Why not combine them, somehow?</br></br>  Wasn't Gold Experience's original power to reflect any damage it takes if you touch one of its living creature things? Were the translations so bad that that's not actually its power or was it retconned or what?  <br>What was the Bands Style?</br>  <br>What would the name be? <br><br>Smooth Jazz rap</br></br></br>  <br>no, it was, it just got retconned</br>  <br>Honestly I don't think it would have a Unique name, You're just channeling Hamon into an object and making it Spin, that's it.<br><br> Smooth Jazz rap <br>Hmmm...Not really sure on it's power then. But for the design we can take the cover and extrapolate it from that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah I got ya. That shit was super OP in the beginning. God, Part 5 had a ton of issues. At least the stand designs were really cool.</br>  <br>Draw some lewd Hot pants next if you can.</br>  <br>Manipulating souls? Jazz is a "soulful" genre</br>  <br>Isn't that SCR's schtick though?</br>  <br>Yes you mongoloid.<br><br>Go back to introductory math, you son of a bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>White snake can<br>- steals stands<br>- steal memories<br>- has super strength at 20 meters<br>- can disguise itself as other people<br>- can produce digestive acid<br>- can put people in dreamlike states<br>- can mind control people by putting its hand in their head<br>- can create disks with impossible orders<br>- can boil water by touch<br>- can remove abstract parts of a person like "eyesight"<br>- has its own personality<br>- create illusions</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Train for 50 years <br> Gain 50 extra years of life <br>So...you earned a total of 0 years? You just managed to live longer, but didn't really "live" those years, if you know what I mean.<br><br>If anything, Joseph would've just lived longer to see everyone die.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joseph was going to be a vampire anyway, so he'd see everyone die anyway.<br><br>But then Pucci happened.</br></br></br>  <br>And awww Jotaro couldn't even hold a timestop for 5 seconds.<br><br> he didn't train it <br>You wouldn't try to better your most OP ability? Jotaro should have Kekyoin'd literally every enemy he came across. But no, he dies.<br><br>Part 6 should be ranked last on every poll.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget<br>-can make people sing songs by putting music cds in their heads.</br></br>  <br>thats because time sped up and so did his timestop.</br>  Just went from part 3 to part 4 Araki stopped explaining every panel. I always wanted him to do that but now I find it hard to follow.  Just ordered the two Phantom Blood HC's and preordered the third.  <br>He could only stop time for like 1-2 seconds anyway. If he had the full 5, his stand would have never been stolen.</br>  <br>Depends on when.<br>Infinite spin cannot be reset, since it has no point of origin once it's active<br><br>But the flaw is that it needs to be activated.<br>That's where the reset can happen without any discomfort.<br><br>Tusk4 is the gun to beat GER, it just cannot be fired.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to put my penis inside Yasuho  <br>You can't really blame them for liking Jonathan, he's pretty based.<br>https://<span>youtu.be/RwNjSwZD8e8?list=P<wbr>Ljf9-cxvDup9jQHZsxhIXV5Y9FyJXR4Bg</wbr>  [ ] <br>The only thing is, i've been posting in this thread for years and years and only noticed the Jonathanfags getting vocal recently, it still feels like a small handful of people rather than "a lot".</br></br></br>  <br>I read Phantom Blood for the first time a year ago and I was shocked more people didn't like Jonathan.<br>He was awesome.<br><br>Fighting vampires in slowly collapsing mansions.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ users <br> people <br><br>Kekyoin</br></br></br></br>  <br> JoJos in one sentence <br> Giorno: Gold Experience punched a brick wall and gave it life. This is how Giorno came to be. <br>There is a problem.</br></br></br>  <br>did someone say kekyoin?</br>  <br> I read Phantom Blood for the first time a year ago and I was shocked more people didn't like Jonathan. <br>Everyone is too busy jerking it to Joseph and Jousuke to remember him.</br></br>  <br>no, you don't understand, Giorno follows no rules or consistency</br>  <br>and that is?</br>  best jojo  <br> 10000x10000 <br>Thanks for crashing my shit computer you asshole.</br></br>  <br>Jonathan's is the only Jojo that feels like an hero.</br>  <br>Thanks for crashing my toaster pc, you Kekyoin.</br>  <br>Jonathan isn't bad but he isn't especially good either. He's far superior than Jotaro,but that's not saying much,Jotaro is shit.</br>  <br>I like the fact that he wasn't a stereotypical self righteous"hero" and was mainly morally gray, I mean, for fucks sake he ended up forgiving Dio during his last moments and called him his friend, he just didn't want anyone to suffer.</br>  <br>Jonathan has a very clear arc. Starts off somewhat spoiled and not really focused and rather grows into that role.<br><br>It's standard but done well.</br></br></br>  <br>Jotaro went from a prick to an artist to a shit father to a less shit father</br>  <br>Sort of like in real life</br>  <br> an artist <br>Did I miss something?</br></br>  <br> an artist <br>Confirmed best JoJo.</br></br>  <br>Jonathan has some of the best character development in the entire series, whether or not you like him as a character is subjective though.</br>  <br><br>Autist <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 1 being hated and ranked lowest is just a fresh new meme. Usually part 6 is rated lowest because of the amount of retcons it did.</br>  So I just started Part 8 is there a reason for Jojo to have 4 balls  <br>No not really.<br><br>Maybe to show that these fusions don't always go perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta have them big cummins</br>      <br>lmao 2sack<br>2sack!!1111</br></br>  <br>Josuke is actually more Josefumi than Kira but you're right, his memory is completely gone and Josuke has brand new different personality (most likely).</br>  <br>Thanks Doc.</br>  <br>nice</br>  <br><br>You're welcome</br></br>  <br> not wanting to find out for himself/herself <br>do you really want to live like this anon, change your ways</br></br>  Is Hermes really a girl? she has a fucking beard.  <br>i guess that was make up??<br><br>Btw, the D'Arby brothers faces: are those silvery gray things tattoos or what?</br></br></br>  <br>Rohan is one to talk with his shitty paintbrush hair.</br>  <br>That's a scar.<br>Same as the one on her forehead.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it supposed to be a scar?<br><br>She's just a very masculine woman. Araki even gives her a name starting with "herm"</br></br></br>  <br>Doc why u don't make a  read the manga   folder in imgur?</br>  <br><br>Anon why don't you go   somewhere else  </br></br>   Thinking about buying the Japanese version of JJASB. Can I still play online against people with the NA version?   How do people figure out their stand ability when they developed the stand/get shot by the arrow?<br><br>Some stands are pretty easy to figure out, it punches really hard, it controlls fire/water/sand, it can swing a sword, it's a gun, it's a fish, it's a book that predicts the future, it can turn into tentcles and shoot gems, etc.<br><br>But there are other stands with abilities so vague it's like a [concept], giving life, reflecting damage on the object you just gave life to, Onomatopoeias, making people young by grabbing their shadow, virus that melts everyone who moves [down], accelerated aging depending on body temperature, etc.<br><br>We see Koichi having a little trouble with his stand when he first used it and that's about it. Jolyne got a hang of it real quick, and Gappy straight out uses his stand ability without any memories.<br><br>So how to people figure out what their stand does? Through experiments or trial and error? Can you imagine how pissed Kira was when he first tried to touch a hand with killer queen and the hand just fucking explodes in front of him?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Made one: http://imgur.com/a/2OSEa<br><br>but it's only full of my stuff.</br></br></br>  <br>They experiment, it took DIO 6 months to figure how to stop time.</br>  <br>I can't speak from experience, but I have a friend who had ASB Moonrune Edition and we couldn't play.</br>  Come up with your own stands, but it can't be too OP.  <br>Mosty through trial and error.<br><br>Since stands are a part of your soul, finding out its basic powers wouldn't be too difficult and probably feels instinctual as well.<br>Getting creative with it is another story though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, bro. I'll shop around for some deals on the NA version.</br>  <br>The power to place sensory organs like eyes and ears on various surfaces.</br>  <br>I just want to know how did Notorious BIG's user know what it did.</br>  <br>Stand Name: September<br><br>Able to omit certain memories. Can also target the heart for autokill, but only on the 21st night of September. I've fucked with this idea, mainly because Earth, Wind and Fire are best.</br></br></br>  Newfag here, just finished the first part of the anime and im moving on to Stardust Crusaders, is Joseph still wacky or does he mature?  <br>He's still as he is, I'm sure you'll still love him.<br><br>Now get out before you get spoiled.</br></br></br>  <br>Most likely the knowledge is part of his stand, or it told him like with Trish.<br>Or an additional power, since his stand did manifest already before getting shot.</br></br>  <br>[Dear Penis]<br>Makes everything seem like phallic imagery. The dicks appear sentient in your mind and will constantly talk dirty and flirt with you. The Stand will be disguised among them and try to influence you into becoming a mindbroken cockslut.</br></br>  <br> was there for the request of this picture and all the retards who didn't know what it referenced <br> I know and I didn't even read naruto </br></br>  <br>did you play the EBA song?</br>  <br>It was still a retarded request. It would've made since if it was from a guy who got off for doing something fucked up and everyone just forgave him</br>  <br>Too overpowered.</br>  <br>no idea about a name, but it switches user and stand of a single person at a time<br><br>like star platinum becomes a real person with personified personality while jotaro becomes a stand with his personality translating into powers<br><br>obviously only useful against people with shitty personalities</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you place your own, so you only have 2? Or can you make your own artificial ones? Also, can you stick other people's anywhere as well?</br>  <br>「Kill The King」<br><br>This stand does literally nothing except making people believe something terrible and unfathomable is going to happen.<br><br>Basically 「menacing」: the stand</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just your own, but artificial ones.<br>They can be destroyed, but it won't damage the user very much, since you can just replace a lost eye with your stand.</br></br>  <br>fuck jotaro, he prevented the others from shining because the japanese liked him more<br><br>how awesome would it be if they sercretly recruited alessi and had him turn joseph into young joseph for the dio fight</br></br></br>  <br>he would forget who DIO was because his memories would revert too, you dumbass<br><br>he couldn't see The World<br><br>he'd die even faster</br></br></br></br></br>  Part 9 with Jesus being the first stand user when?<br><br>After all, one of the ways you could say his personal name is JOshua bar JOseph.</br></br>  Part 7 anime never.<br>At least an OVA of the last fights would be cool.</br>  <br>「Jawbreaker」<br><br> power A <br> potential E <br> range E <br> speed B <br> durability C <br><br>The stand is just a huge arm with huger fist. If it hits the enemy in the jaw, he/she is killed instantly regardless of the power of the punch. If hit elsewhere, it's essentially a lame Star Platinum without timestop.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this.<br>He'd be able to ruse PB Dio, but The World is simply too strong, even for most stands.</br></br>  <br>well it's not like araki never asspulled exceptions before, and the world wouldn't be able to directly touch him because of the hamon body, so it would be a joseph vs dio fight. he would still die and have jotaro save the day, I'm just mad that he's useless on part 3 so jotaro can look badass</br>  <br> the world wouldn't be able to directly touch him because of the hamon body <br>that's part of Hermit Purple, he can't do it on his own</br></br>  Did someone got the fanart of Gyro and Johnny doing a selfie?  <br>i thought he'd know he was the baddie but just forget the name like mini polnareff did with alessi</br>  <br>that was because hermit purple man<br>  god, joseph fags are so annoying </br></br>  <br>mini polnareff had vague memories he was bad, but for joseph that knowledge would be useless, he wouldn't know what stands are</br>  <br>Thanks doc.</br>  <br>「Before the Dawn」<br><br>Gradually makes the enemy allergic sunlight. Needs to be in &gt;100m to continuously take effect. When sunlight weakness is full, the victim will crumble to dust in the sunlight just like a vampire would.</br></br></br>  <br>im not denying he'd get shat on im just saying he'd have vague memories of him being evil</br>  <br>You're just nitpicking man. Joseph is my favorite jojo but stands are just on another level.</br>  <br>He wouldn't know why they are looking for DIO<br>He would have no idea about Jotaro.</br></br>  <br>I dont even know what were arguing about any more<br><br>im just saying he'd have vague memories like him being evil just like mini polnereff did</br></br></br>  <br>This stand has no backside, so no matter where you are, this stand always looks directly at you.<br>Your speed does not affect this stand, and all his projectiles basically have 100% accuracy and cannot be sidestepped.<br><br>Strong, but easy to manage if you know what you're doing, and by not being in an open field.</br></br></br></br>  <br>punches make you hallucinate</br>  <br>where did I even say the opposite?

But neither Joseph, Lisa Lisa nor Ceasar could heal Suzie Q after here encounter with ACDC. I think it's more like specialization.

The force which drives the nail forward isn't, is it?</br>  <br>I wouldn't think so, not to say that one infinity cancels out the other but rather that the "infinity" in infinite rotation doesn't rotate forward it's purely two dimensional. it's just propelled forward by the nail.<br><br><br>the point i was trying to make was that flawed and exciting main characters are best. Faggots like Joseph are shit though</br></br></br></br>  <br>The force is also the Stand itself, which controls gravity. The bullet only has to make contact to inflict the infinite rotation and the point where the Green Baby makes things disappear is its very skin.</br>  <br>thanks</br>  <br><br>So it would be a point of infinite rotation "floating" in mid air where zero point should be?</br></br>  Will we ever go back to the original Jojo universe?  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibon<wbr>acci_number<br><br>it's a 2 dimensional thing, even in stopped time Tusk 4 didn't move forward.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>It's still active in stopped time though.</br>    nice tumblr autism circlejerking general faggots    <br>Tell 'em to eat shit, Doc</br>  <br>tell him yourself.</br>  <br>eat shit and fall off your chair!</br>  <br>i have the EU version and i have played against japs, don't expect it to not lag heavily with anyone who isn't in the same room</br>  <br> fall off your chair <br><br>Rude.</br></br></br>  <br> Jesus has gains <br>Araki wouldn't draw that these days<br>So if he does do a Jesus part one day, he won't look like that</br></br></br>  Reminder that King Crimson is just a Tohth that lets you rip out pages, but functions is a shorter time interval and doesn't tell you how to win.<br><br>King Crimson CAN "kill" people in erased time, but then their death doesn't become a reality.

Jo2uke/Gappy is his own person, we have no indication that his personality is exactly the same as Josefumis so it makes no sense to call him that.

Whenever and enemy does something other than standing, they get ORA'd from wherever they are conceptually sitting (e.g: if they're skydiving and take a "sitting" position, they get ass and back punched) until they stand again. It also makes it somewhat harder for them to keep their footing.</br></br></br>    <br>bye bye abdul :(</br>  <br>Stand: 「Hijo de la Luna」<br><br>This stand has a moon for a head, and when she attacks, painless black spots appear on the impact zone.

What the bloody fuck is you guys's problem ?</br>  <br> New York Times Best Seller 3 months in a row <br> Underground <br>U Wot M8?</br></br></br>  <br>Wow. So even burgers digged that shit so much they actually bought imported manga? That really good. Hopefully there'll be more seasons.</br>  <br>Most of us actually bought the official  better translated  volumes from Seven Seas.</br>  <br>   better translations <br>This is actually a good point.</br></br>  <br><br>Seven sea shills please</br></br>    <br>I didn't even know what Seven Seas was until this guy posted it.</br>  <br>Just watched it.<br>Lucky I'm already fapped out or Smith would send me off for round three.<br><br>Darling alpha as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  huh, they actually fucked up the censoring for a split second in the first ep  <br>Since when Seven Seas is good? FwPA always throw shit against them.</br>  Rachnee and Cerea are best girls  <br> and the censorships is almost nonexistant. <br>They're just doing a good job of not doing the blatant "RANDOM BEAMS OF LIGHT FROM GOD KNOWS WHERE" that so many anime have done as of late. Looking at you, Testament.<br><br>I guarantee you that the scene with Miia flashing Darling in the lingerie shop is going to zoomed out a hit in the BDs so that we can see her nipple, just like in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  Would you fuck Miia?  <br>even though she's not best girl, who wouldn't?</br>  <br>Happily.</br>  <br>Only if I can do it without going to jail and getting her deported.<br><br>But I'd do the same for any of the other harem girls except for  Centorea  and  Fishtits. </br></br></br>  <br>Duh</br>  Is he ever turned on by Papi?  <br>i want her to fuck me with her tail</br>  Why is harem suddenly ok when it's monster girls?  <br>Because there is no tsundere</br>  <br>They're sure of a lot better than TF and her crew. They also seem pretty bro-ish from the few times they've come here and had legitimate discussions about the manga.</br>  <br>Momma does it best.</br>  <br>Because it isn't showing stagnancy within the genre. It is doing something at least a little different. If harems become more niche about who they pander to, the genre can become less repetitive and more enjoyable for everyone.</br>  <br>The problem most people have with harems isn't the fact that the guy has several girls after his dick, it's the nigh-inescapable conventions of the genre. The beta MC, the main girl being the worst girl, the "accidents" and the girls inevitably resorting to intentional physical violence in retaliation, the shitty tsunderes.<br><br>Monster Musume doesn't really have any of that.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe but I want a Miia.</br>  <br>I need to know this please.<br>Cant download anything from where i am now</br></br>  <br>Yet they still lay on the puns, and 12beast isn't that great of a read with all the shit they fluff into it.<br><br>I may have issues with both sides but I won't stop supporting both sides.</br></br></br>  <br>With  a shotgun. </br>  <br>This. <br><br>Haremshit is part of the bread and butter of seasonal anime, and even more so after the LN adaptation craze the publishers are on.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon you're my hero, your post is perfect.</br>  Is protag ever turned on by Papi, or was miia more attractive to him despite not having legs?  <br>Stop asking and just read the fucking manga yourself.</br>  <br>S E C O N D A R Y</br>  <br>Darling loves all of the monster girls unconditionally. You'll see when the show gets there. You could also always just read the manga.

You should be a giant normalfag instead" <br> What Manami didn't know, is that by putting herself between Kirino and Kyosuke, Kirino didn't have time to develop the feeling that "this is my brother, i dont' want to fuck him" <br> Several years pass <br> Kirino and Kyousuke actually fall in love <br> Manami goes apeshit, getting in a fight with Kirino and kicking Kyosuke in the stomach <br>A.

This... This is all I needded!  Griffith is going to forgive Rickert and let him go, but not because he cares about him, Griffith is literally Jesus to all the world right now and he knows it, so by letting him go he'll show how forgiving and kind he is as a ruler. It's not like all midland watched him getting bitchslaped so probably no ones gonna know what happened.  <br> only just now hearing about this <br>Well, better late than never I suppose, eh anon?</br></br>  <br>eggxaclty :3</br>    the suffering is back  <br>Well, he'll let him go not out of forgiveness but out of losing interest. He'll see no point in interacting with Rickert anymore and just move on. Remember that Griffith sacrificed his humanity when he became Femto.</br>    Bueno...  <br>anons top it <br><br><br>no man should suffer this much</br></br></br></br>  <br>Woah I don't remember Guts being so fucking tall.</br>  <br>But he creates a perfect Kingdom for save some lifes .</br>  there better be tons more of pimphand Rickert in the story to come.  <br>He just created a kingdom because he WANTED a kingdom, he doesn't give a fuck about saving lifes.</br>  <br>I know that SK wrecked the dimensional balance, but isn't it the God Hand who use it for spreading carnage and destruction. So Femto is actually in on the chaos, because it gives his magic kingdom justification for being around.</br>  <br>Why not both ? Griffith did something good with apostle , now they don't kill human and he saves Human race when he killed the giant apostle .</br>  <br>holy fucking shit rickert has balls</br>  <br>Fuck off hawk.</br>  <br>I hate the bag meme... but damn, that bag.</br>  Please, Miura. Good ending, fucking please.  <br> "It was too big, too thick, too rough to be a   purse , but it was a  PURSE  nontheless"</br>  <br>I think casca will join Griffith when she will recover her memory .</br>  <br>I said fuck off hawk.</br>  <br>falcon*</br>  They licenced berserk like 2 months ago in my country <br>Not a coincidence profit moves people</br>  <br>Well yes it's true that he saved midland from the kushan invasion, but he clearly didn't do it to save the people. Now all the world is full of monsters and no one knows it was all part of his plan. So now everyone thinks that Griffith is Jesus and Falconia is the only safe place on earth, and it probably is but as I said before, it was all part of his plan to have his own kingdom.</br>  <br>Damn those covers look bad</br>  <br>ok here.</br>  <br> What will happen to Rickert after the slappening? <br>Probably nothing, Griffith let him slap him</br></br>   morons who think they're funny and try to fit in still shitpost in a Berserk thread <br>What a surprise.</br>  <br>Could that maybe have been Griffith wondering if he could "feel" something at the hands of one of his former comrades, like how it was at the hill of swords?</br>  <br>I like how you put the most effort in the ass</br>  <br>There's no one shitposting in this thread besides you</br>  <br> to-resume-as-monthly-series-this-m<wbr>onth</wbr> <br>You people don't actually believe this, do you?<br><br>How fucking gullible are you retards?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's always a comfort to cling onto that faint hope.</br></br>  <br> morons believe a moron <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  <br>I agree<br><br>You should still end yourself though</br></br></br>  <br>Is that the Mexican edition or the hue one? Those covers deserve a solid 6/10.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off, Nagi's gay crew.</br></br>  <br>I really don't know what Rickert plans to do next, but some serious shit is about to go down in Falconia.<br>Griffith is set to marry into the crown sometime soon, the official plan is already in place. Whoever just broke into the palace is probably after his head to prevent that.</br></br>  <br>JUST_SACRIFICE_IT.png</br>  Falconia could go either way, The God Hand don't really linger there. But there's that apostle fight club in the back room. <br><br>People say Femtolost all humanity to become a God Hand but when he used the Demon Child to manifest in the physical world he gained that child's humanity. He just might be feeling regret and remorse. Maybe not for his actions but the sadness the child has to have never had a real chance to live, or to feel his parent's love. <br><br>Guts' New Party is totally gonna get destroyed though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or, on second thought, maybe they're targeting Charlotte's head because Griffith is 2strong</br>  <br>Rickert is just going to leave because not a single fuck was given that day.</br>  <br>Nice meme</br>  Is or will there be a human stronger then guts?  <br> Start the manga one week before the annoncement ; finish one day before the announcement. <br><br>It feels good to be the chosen one.</br></br></br>  <br> He thinks it's gonna last longer than 2-3 chapters </br>  <br> He doesn't know <br><br>It won't actually be monthly anon, he hasn't managed to be monthly in something like a decade.</br></br></br>  <br>Just cut your limbs off now, anon.

Well, I suppose. It's not safe outside, but it's likely even less safe around Griffith, and Rickert is one of the very few characters aware of that.<br>For reasons still unknown, Rickert has insane plot armor, but keeping Erica safe could be a problem.<br><br>And someone really ought to make an "Around Griffith, Never Relax" image, if there isn't one already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you just pretended to be a girl and married Miura you could make him happy and defeat his depression and loneliness once and for all. Do it for us. Do it for Berserk.</br>  <br><br>But then the apostles who literally see Griffith as their messiah will kill Rickert.<br><br><br><br>yeeeah.<br><br>Son, you see, the reason why no one believes it'll truly be monthly is because the quality of miurta's art detailing is AMAZING, like, if he does do a monthly schedule it'll be because the art is simplified, which'll be sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All he gained after manifesting in the child was the instinct to protect his mother. It was simply lingering affection from the child to Caska.</br>  <br>I swear I wasn't even mad when it happened. I thought it was amusing like everyone else.<br><br>Yeah, that's not gonna be a distraction at all for him. What could go wrong?</br></br></br>  <br>OH DEAR GOD NO</br>  Reminder that once they're done with Elf land they have to get back on a boat.  <br> implying he will stop raping my ass for Berserk. </br>  <br>No.<br><br>There will be teleportation magic or something.<br><br>NO<br><br>THERE WILL BE TELEPORTATION MAGIC OR GIANT LIGHTSPEED BUTTERFLIES</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying the Elf King won't use his Elf magic to alleviate that problem </br>  <br><br><br>Or just a timeskip, like every other times an uneventful, long travel has happened in a story.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, instead of a boat he'll give them the ability to walk on water and to never sink so they don't' need a boat.<br><br>Good thinking.</br></br></br>  <br>do you think griffith's prettiness rubbed off on rickert and now he'll be handsomer?</br>  <br>No one knows if he actually recovered some humanity when he absorbed the baby apostle, the only thing we know is that he felt something when he saw Casca in the valley of swords.</br>  <br>The urge to rape.</br>  <br> Honk </br>   /ai/ - Idle Activities  as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection.
