Read the guide before asking anything<br><br>buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Everything about this is perfect except the face.</br>  <br>I need this</br>  <br>This looks like impending hotglue</br>  <br>I have found a new fetish. bikinis too small for their tits.</br>  <br><br>I FUCKING LOVE short shorts.</br></br>    <br>There's nothing wrong with the face.</br>  <br>Kojak a shit. Clear when?</br>  Seems like there's an exhibition in my city that has GSC, Alter, Volks, and the smaller manufacturers turning up. I'll post pics if any new prototypes happen to be shown tomorrow.  <br>Weird to see batman and superman, but seems interesting</br>  <br>I have that Miku, love her.</br>  <br>Reminds me I gotta pick up Aoba but I cant bring myself to pay 7k+ for a nendo.</br>  So it was mentioned in the previous thread. What's the deal with Chicago customs? They don't give a fuck over there or something?  <br>You should have preordered those nendo nipples when you had a chance.<br><br> I didn't preorder him either, but I found him on Rakuten for 40usd later. </br></br></br>  <br>What's going here? Chicago customs? Now that I think about it, my parcels always land in Chicago for customs.</br>  <br>I don't know. Referring to this last thread. As far as NY customs go, I haven't had any problems albeit I don't know if I'm on any kind of watch list.</br>  <br>I've only ever had things go through NY customs but I've never had a problem. On the other hand, I never order anything lewd or even loli, so there's no reason for them to stop anything. I haven't really heard of anything getting stopped at US customs though in recent memory.</br>  <br>finally a good fig of mai waifu. They ever list a price or we still in the dark?</br>  <br>Nothing yet.</br>  <br><br>That post makes me curious now, also none of my parcels haven't been open over the years as well</br></br>  <br>That body is too delicious. It should be a crime to be this delicious.</br>  Is this safe in Canada? I'm worried.  <br>yeah totally</br>  <br>nope i hope you get jailed</br>  <br>Any other Canadians getting her? I'd feel a lot safer to know I'm not the only retard.</br>  <br>She's not naked. Even if she was, it's nothing sexual.

She looks pretty naked in it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not Sonico.</br>  <br>She uses her wand thing as a buttplug and it wraps around to cover her pussy.</br>  <br> nothing sexual </br>  <br> it's nothing sexual </br>  <br>shut up and help us jail the canadian<br><br><br><br>yeah it's really fine to me<br>i'm from canada and i will be getting this by the way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nothing to do with being extra paranoid. But more with being fucking retarded.<br><br>Loli IS illegal in Canada. Period. No matter how you fucking try to deluded yourself this it isn't customs won't give a flying fucking shit. It is illegal. Fucking Period. <br><br>You order it at your own risk, stop asking "hey guise is this specific loli legal!?"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will this be going up on amiami, or exclusive on some other site?</br>  <br>Get it! I'm sure you'll be fine!</br>    <br>No dick means it's not pornographic. It's safe.</br>  <br>There's what looks like a strap on her hip and chest. Maybe a micro bikini or something.</br>  <br>How big is the risk? Can I pull the old "I dind order nuffin"</br>  <br> via 9gag </br>  <br>How many people in these threads have been caught though? I never see people get into real legal trouble in these threads and I'm sure they've ordered a ton of shit.</br>  <br>na nigger your pedo days are over if you buy this and your going to get anally raped in prison for the rest of your natural born life buy a big ass nigga named buba<br><br>anyways I just got this yesterday.</br></br></br>  <br>Get a load of this faggot.</br>  <br>I want to get this, but I'm not even into the fate series.

I'm surprised by how simple yet nice the box is. Do you guys do anything with the cards?  <br>it depends on wich storyline you choose - and this figure is based on fate/Kaleid, where she is 10</br>  <br>drawings don't have ages</br>  <br>I use them as bookmarks.</br>  <br>Putting the sword in his hand was a little bit challenging because the thumb on the other hand kept getting in the way, but it worked eventually.<br><br>Verdict: He is a  cute. </br></br></br>  <br>When did he ship out to you?</br>  <br>If I'm a cute girl and I order this, will I be okay?<br>Clearly I'm not a dirty pedophile, so they won't be angry at me.</br></br>  <br>Tell that to the UK Government.</br>  <br>I got the shipping notification on June 27th, so two days after release.</br>  <br>yes, today's society is run by SJW cucks so if you're a female then you get a shit load of privilege</br>  <br>I have two on my mirror and the rest are stored in my files.</br>  <br>Ike when?</br>  So I'm going to Tokyo soon and am thinking about bringing figures back. Do you guys have any general advice? How feasible is it to bring things back in my luggage?  <br>I want him, but I need to save up all I can for that 1/12 panzer on top of my regular preorders. I'll hope he's still not sold out by then, but it's unlikely.</br>  <br>i plan to make a suit of armor out of amiami cards</br>  <br>I will</br>  <br><br>My hot glue gun is ready.</br></br>  <br>Marth's coming soon, so it's very possible Ike is to follow. I want an army of Fire Emblem nendos.<br><br>Soren  never ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>The boxes are huge, so you can only bring a few at best.</br>   those paranoid canda/brit faggots <br><br>i lold mordina is even flatter an more naked than illya and you can order her in canadian shop<br><br>kill yourself faggots</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hm, are there alternative options?</br>  <br>She doesn't look like a child though.</br>  <br>Unless you bring one set of clothes to use, you won't be able to bring much back in luggage.<br><br>You'll have to send it back, but the boxes at the post office are pretty fucking small if you want some easy to find boxes.</br></br></br>   Cover <br> 87 USD <br><br>Why.jpg</br></br></br>  <br>That's the usual price for a daki that's not released yet.</br>  <br>Just came out today anon</br>  <br><br>Hi /v/.<br><br> fuck off </br></br></br></br>  <br> illya looks lika child <br><br>get eyes faggot<br><br>also im not going to continue this shitposting anymore im not live in a shit fascist country aka cucknada</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I've personally never owned a daki.<br>I can understand it being that much for both the pillow and the cover together, but just the cover? that seems a bit too much.</br></br>  <br>I just brought a separate carryon bag for space to carry figs when I went for 2 weeks. Granted I only got ~5 total and 2 were nendos</br>  This is worth something now ? This toys are from 1996-7 I was cleaning my attic and found a bag with old toys  <br><br>this is a joke, right?</br></br>  <br>Not buying them.</br>  Episode 03 "Launch" in just about 9 hours (I think the official twitter is saying it airs at 26:30 instead of 25:55) <br><br>Preview pics are out. Rui still the cutest.</br></br>  こんにちは。関東圏以外の皆様、お待たせしました。<br>本日26:30よりＢＳ日テレにてガッチャマンクラウズインサイトがオンエ<wbr>アです！<br>ぜひぜひ第1話contact pointをご覧くださいませね！　#GATCHAMANCrowds #クラウズ #agqr<br><br>Hello.Everyone except the Kanto region, we've kept you waiting.<br>Gatchaman Crowds Insight is on the air at today from 26:30 BS NTV!<br>By all means I please Visit the first episode contact point! #GATCHAMANCrowds # Clouds #agqr</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Gel is the cutest alien in the universe! She needs more fan art!  <br>Reminder</br>    <br> one of these things is not like the others </br>  Their notes colors look so weird, they are not the typical red/blue/green/yellow, I wonder what the logic was  Yeah I'm not feeling the new girl at all.  I'm ready for my weekly dose of Hajime-ssu~  <br>I really hope there is a twist. I know Gatchaman isn't the deepest shit, but this handholding kumbaya shit about everyone needing to be happy and share emotions makes me want to puke.</br>  <br>Of course there is going to be a twist, Gel was shown straight out manipulating people into changing their "air". The question is whether she is evil, a victim of manipulation herself or just naive and about to be used.<br><br>Also what the fuck are these.</br></br></br>  Hope we'll see Rui wearing this. My favorite outfit after the winter one.  <br>lollipops</br>  Overanalyzation time!<br>From this I'd say that we only have to worry about Hajime's bubble if it becomes red, the gray is just Hajime being Hajime.<br>Also, I don't know why Rui doesn't have a shadow.</br></br>  <br>aaah, no, I get it, the shadow is X! Cute.</br>  <br>Yeah, seeing that image I'd definitely have to agree. It's so subtle I hadn't seen it until now, maybe because the OP is so catchy it's distracting.<br><br>Hajime confirmed for red, and it's going to be fucking brilliant. Just imagine her breaking down and pitching a fit or crying her eyes out. I'm getting hard just thinking about it~</br></br></br>  <br>You must be an evil person.</br>  <br>yeah there's an edgy faggot who wants to mindbreak rui so he wouldn't pay attention to apes because he wants a special and exclusive club.</br>  <br> Red hajime has no shadow <br>spooky</br></br>  <br><br>It seems like the red is trying to affect Hajime but she brushes it off with grey.<br><br>Tsubasa is red.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rui has no shadow, X has a shadow. Probably because carrotop is his shadow.</br></br>  <br>I love how they had to take Hajime away from Rui when he probably needs her the most, because OD sure as hell ain't leaving his talk show anytime soon</br>  If Rui takes X inside himself like Hajime did with Katze will he also grow boobs?  <br>x's "shadow" is just shading, look at rui's legs, head, armpits and back, they all have the same shading as rui's hands</br>  <br>we are talking about the silhouette you can see behind them. Look at the other characters.</br>  <br>I wonder if Rhythm will react any different to trap Rui.</br>  <br>Yes, X casts no shadow in the back ground, unless you are considering the huge darker blue square his shadow</br>  <br>I'm considering the blue square X's shadow. (actually, the angle is wrong, so I'm considering the lighter blue the true shadow/silhouette of an X and the blue the background).<br><br><br>I wonder if Gel's influence is the reason they look like they are having a nice chat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> gel mindcontrols them into fucking each other in that rooftop <br><br>It'll be a doujin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Gentle love making under Gel's influence <br> Rui suggests moving somewhere nicer <br> Teleports them away, Gel's influence disappears <br> Turns into brutal rape </br></br></br></br>  <br>Who rapes who? Rizumo is a faggot medical student while Rui's been superheroing for a while.</br>  Why is Hajime so... "special"?  <br>In my heart Rui is always the one getting raped, but   as a fellow former med student who very much doesn't have the time to start a revolution   this time it can be Rizumu who takes a dick.</br>    <br>Hajimes.</br>  <br> utsutsu's mound <br><br>hot</br></br></br>  Gel-chan is super moe.  <br>GERURURURURURURU</br>  <br><br><br>People forget Rui can be athletic and packs a punch and survived brutal assault from Katze. He's not a wimp.<br><br>Rizumo looks pretty wimpy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> packs a punch  <br>He strikes me as quite the non violent pacifist, actually. He is very athletic, but I don't remember him ever fighting much.</br></br>  <br>Sure.</br>  <br><br>By athletic, you mean he's not a fatass, right? He's not athletic, he's a skinny crossdressing faggot</br></br>  <br>I seriously thought this was a 4chan meme until I saw the top prints for a design-your-own t-shirt website.</br>  <br>It is a 4chan meme.</br>  <br>I just noticed that Joe likes sweets</br>  <br> you will never do that with your dick </br>  <br><br><br>I wish autistic people were as interesting as Hajime. One guy I knew just sat around looking at pictures of lawnmowers all day. Just lawnmowers.<br><br>One time I got his parents lawnmower and went around the neighborhood trying to mow lawns at 3am.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By athletic I mean "able to literally jump in and out of traffic in high heels to save a little girl"</br>  berg is the one who created the crowds I wonder if :&gt; asked him.  <br>Fags really forget Rui's running around in heels and that Katze could throw heavy stuff like that shit JJ sat on and could break the ground with his heels, that he wasn't completely broken after his beating proves Rui stamina.</br>  <br><br>why does Hajime have 2 dairies</br></br>  <br>Her's and Katze.</br>  <br>She was born with them</br>  Same stream as last week?  <br>But what about those in the kanto region?</br>    Fucking Ruifags, holy shit.  <br>go away Joefag.</br>  I want a Gel-chan.  <br>you better stay away from my rui you evil alien loli.<br><br> gerururururu </br></br></br>  <br>Half the thread is just faggots talking about their favorite shitty trap.</br>  <br>gentleman of superior taste aren't they?</br>  <br>Anon, half of /a/ is just faggots talking about their favorite shitty trap.</br>  <br>Couldn't be more wrong.

I don't know if the same stream as last week is showing it.</br>  For that special anon in your life.  <br><br>Great, thank you. It's my first time live streaming this so I wasn't sure which time it started exactly.  Meiz is the only option, right? </br></br>  <br>Doesn't it air tomorrow?</br>  <br>that's illegal anon-kun.</br>  <br>I'm not sure, myself. It's showing an episode of classroom crisis right now and I doubt it will be done in 8 minutes, though last week they streamed the episode 10 minutes later.<br>It's our only hope, though!</br></br>  <br>It's already tomorrow in Japan.</br>  <br>Rui's the only character that isn't the new lesbian trio with an actual storyarc thanks to BANE.<br><br>Sugane, Joe, Saya, Paiman and OD are mostly quirky background fodder now that appear only to spice up the show.</br></br></br>  <br>Shh.</br>  <br>The episode airs in 23 hours, not now.</br>  <br>Oh, that explains things!</br>  <br>That makes sense, thanks.</br>  <br>It's called "Kuu-sama" according to the picture. Assuming it's kuu from 食う, "Lord Eater"?</br>  I'm going to drop a few webms if you don't mind.              Aya Hirano Panda is the best part of this show  Female Sugane and male Hajime.  <br>I think they are impressed that Utsusu is letting Hajime do a make over or something.</br>  Subs when? edition. Raws are already out. <br><br>Movie sold out all over Amazon.<br><br>Reminder that in 2 days there's an event and a s3 announcement is likely at said event.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who is Seki?</br>  <br>Kogami's siyuu</br>  <br>Kogami drops all the spaghetti around Akane, it can't be helped.</br>  <br>Well, damn.

They were right to at least obscure it a little. Think of the children!</br>  <br>In the original version Nobita turned into a vampire and got scared of the bandage that looks like a cross. They changed it into garlic, hence the pizza.</br>  for what purpose  <br><br/></br>  <br>They actually unironically censor hand-holding? I thought hand holding being worthy of censorship was all just a big /a/ in-joke.</br>  <br><br><br>american law</br></br></br>  <br>I guess the first one due to "cruelty to animals".</br>  <br>the loli pop looks cooler smoking isnt cool</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>I'll at least give them props for changing the gun to something funny.</br>  <br>mad with power.</br>    <br>Law that prevents you from have a product in a kids cartoon thats an actual 1:1 piece of merchandise for sale. That and they went censor happy since they were paid by the amount of animation to change.</br>    <br>Everytime, here in fucking germany if there's a trap, the gender gets switched.<br>Just saw that last night with Akame ga Kill.Dub censored out all references to Nyau being male.<br>(Was also the same with Sailor Moon, with Fisheye and Zoisite.)<br>Anyway, Nyau was kept on being referred to as "she" even in his buff form and a clear male voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When you edit it, you have to have animators and artists to redraw or reanimate the scene. The more that needs to be done the more it costs. So they tend to get censor happy so that they can justify charging more.</br>    <br>Don't they even call them contests in the dub? I remember there being episodes about pokemon contests during the Hoenn series where they called them that.</br>  Just remember guys, 4kids fucked itself in the ass and got sued into bankruptcy. Its dead and the ashes are a crappy sporting and entertainment licensing company that will never touch anime again. It can't hurt you ever again.  <br>they literally sexualised it by giving it clothes.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xfJ<wbr>uJrqFhXM</wbr>  [ ]  <br> not completely censored <br>THEY HAD ONE JOB</br></br>  laser chainsaw  Terraformars and Prison School  <br>What did they do again?</br>      <br>I think the reason they do this is to make it easier to internationalize the 4kids dub, so they don't have to change the writing for every language. Not that having words in English in a non-English dub hurts anyone, but see  I remember them removing all text from the Kirby anime, also.</br>  <br>Wouldn't this be more effective than guns if it had sea water? Why don't guards just run around with squirt guns against devil fruit users.</br>    <br>They aren't weak against water itself, silly. It's that they lose all strength and sink if the water is deep enough.<br>If they wanted to exploit that weakness they'd have to outfit the average marine with a goddamn swimming pool (bathtubs have been shown not to be enough).</br></br>  <br>All my wat</br>  <br>But it would be affective against logia type users. Didn't Luffy coat him self in water when fighting Croc so he could hit Croc/not be dried out.</br>  <br>They don't fucking die from touching the water, they just can't swim.</br>  <br>His wording is pretty bad but in essence, he's right : they don't have the right to show the actual merchandise in a show. Like, if you make a toy of a tank that's in the show it's fine, but having the toy of the tank show up is not. It's why, for instance, YuGiOh dub edited the cards from a direct copy of the TCG cards into those dumb ones with just the image and atk/def (no one reads the damn effects in these shows anyway).<br>So with Pokémon being a giant cash cow, anything like pens or cases with a pokéball on it is potential merchandise and they got too censor-happy as a result.<br><br>I think that legislation's gone now, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a special case because Crocodile had an explict water weakness, since he's made of sand and all. If you threw water at most Logias it wouldn't do jack (except maybe Ace?)</br>      <br><br><br><br><br><br>I can understand why One Piece never got quite as popular with the general western public as Naruto.</br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>What the hell is that supposed to be?

They took positions in television or called to complain about things they didn't want their kids to see on TV. Rules were written, shows got censored, etc.<br><br>Eventually, all this got relaxed a bit and now there's not much censorship for cartoons. There's no where near as much that gets picked up for kids compared to the late 90's early 2000's anime craze though.</br></br></br>  Now imagine a country got something that isn't exactly for kids, to air in a kid's block.<br>And threw out the entire script and replaced it with thousands and thousands of puns.<br><br> It was fucking hilarious. </br></br></br>  <br>Is 4kids localizing it?</br>  <br>I know, right?</br>  <br>Enjoy your nothing!</br>  <br>Fuck, they did this to Renamon and in One Piece with Hachi and Satori, too.

The 90s had censorshit on animu, but it also had Animaniacs, Gargoyles and Batman.<br>It's so much better now (most of the time).<br>Sometimes it's still dodgy (it was never literally stated that Korra killed Unalaq, but it was fucking obvious; at least we can now imply homosexuality without moralfags starting to whine down everyone). And in Thundercats 2011 they at least made the genocide VERY clear, and the cat realm was not portrayed as a gentle paradise (they had it coming).<br>But we still have barely anyone shooting at others with real guns, amusingly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  In german naruto no one died, people just suddenly vanished.<br>Appearently Ninjaland was ruled by Stalin.</br>  <br>Lit end = candy end<br>"filter" end = non-candy end<br><br>How did they flip it so he didn't put the non-candy end in his mouth?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They just edited it so the candy end flipped around and went in his mouth, then colored what would have been the lit end, to just be the white end of the stick. I remember catching an episode way back in the day and thought it was funny to see it just flip around like that.</br>  <br>Thank god the latin dub for this series was great and made me afraid to go to sleep at night.<br>10/10 would torrent if found</br></br>  <br>Sounds like 4kids YuGiOh.</br>  <br>Why even bother translating it at that point? Its a show about ninjas.</br>    <br><br><br>To give you an idea, remember that in Hokuto no Ken ("Ken the Survivor" in French), you have two rival schools, Hokuto and Nanto. Hokuto, when pronounced Hokooto, sounds like "couteau", the word for knife. nanto sounds like manteau, the word for coat. <br><br>hence, the French dub abounds with sentences like : <br><br> "He was a great master of the fur Nanto."  <br><br> "This is a secret technique of the meat Hokuto." <br><br>Also, in the scene where Yuria commits suicide in front of Shin by jumping from one of his palace's balconies, the French dub has Shin getting mad at the architect for not installing a proper balcony. <br><br>It also has nonsensical dialogues. To quote :<br><br> *Kenshiro strikes Shin with a powerful attack* <br> Shin : How did you do that ?  <br> Kenshiro : I can't tell you. <br><br>or <br><br> *Ken talks to a widow about her dead husband* <br> "Before dying, he told me he loved you. He told me other things too, but I forgot them."  <br><br>This dub is a work of art in itself. It's become a cult classic among French anime enthusiasts. <br><br>However, even in all this shit, it managed to make what is, in my opinion, an improvement on the base material. Kenshiro's most famous line is "You're already dead." The French dub turns it into :<br><br> "You don't know it yet, but you're already dead." <br><br>Which is a lot cooler.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Honestly, the one on the right looks better</br>  Explain.  <br>Laziness. Actually giving effort would result in them having to make a specific version for each dub.<br><br>Much easier to remove everything and never care.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, it almost sounds like an abridged series.</br>  <br>clapistani's don't like reading.</br>  <br>Now that you mention it, yeah, it's kinda like that.</br>  <br>Since fucking when.

Honestly I prefer the Jojo cigarette censorship instead of the One Piece cig censorship. Clearly censoring the source material but keeping it the same is better than straight up changing the source material to hide the censorship. Of course, on american kids television they probably couldn't even get away with the Jojo style censorship, but still.  <br>Who did it better? Guts or Vegita?</br>  <br>Jojo censorship takes you out of the show while One Piece does not.</br>  <br>and they changed his name.

The other day my 10 year old niece was watching a TV-14 show and there was a masturbation episode and I blew a casket and took the tablet away from her. I had a talk with my sister and she told me she did not know it was that sexual suggestive. I then told her it was a TV-14 show and that she should be more responsible.
