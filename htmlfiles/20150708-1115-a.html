[ Episode 1 is a 10/10, good VA, amazing designs and animation. Lerche find a way.<br><br>Monster musume chapter 35 this month, FwPA delivers. Also Mero arc. <br><br>Daily reminder:<br> Report secondaries and summerfags <br> Keep the thread clean <br> Enjoy the ride </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Previous thread  do not ask for Webm.</br>  I am disappointed at a lack of uncensored subs.  Cerea/Suu are the worst singers in the op  Op as much as I appreciate the gesture and the ignoring of retards, you know having two threads up isnt helping anyone.  Stop making fucking threads  <br>GET THE HELL OF THIS THREAD AND GO BACK TO /b</br>  There are three other threads, use the catalog.    <br>They ruined Smith's legs. They're no longer nice and thick and juicy. She also sounds a lot younger than I expected. How old is she? I assumed she was Kurisumasu Keiki.</br>  <br>The other thread made by a secondary is full of shitpost, you can check it by yourself. As a person who follow this from more than 3 years ago when MM was born on Pixiv I really don't like to turn these theads into GATE or JwWw threads full of animeonlyfags. <br><br>I hope you understand this.</br></br></br>  <br>I still want to ejaculate into Manako's eye. She could sit on my face in exchange and pee in my eyes.</br>  <br>Is just the angle, not the legs in general you can rewatch the episode and when she's in the kitchen with darling she looks really good.</br>  <br>Half that thread is one anon whinging about the OP</br>  <br>Another veteran here. I just gave up time ago. It's the curse of something becoming popular.</br>  <br>Im in a similar position as you and I understand, but still having 3 threads isnt helping contain the anime consequences.</br>    <br>Correction, 4 other threads.<br>At this rate these threads are going to get banned to /jp/ because of dumbasses that know how to use the catalog.</br></br>  You are now suddenly aware that she shoots like Doomguy.  <br>What do we need is the chain way to make threads, just posting continuations of the previous one and always keep the mangafags here. In the end we're the only ones able to keep this place in peace.</br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE RACHNEE  <br><br>Forgot this  always keep record of the threads.</br></br>  We're off to a good start here.  Thank you based LERCHE for giving flat chest fans the middle finger.  <br> tfw Kevin probably didnt live long enough to see this day <br>He had a hard life</br></br>   Kimihito had those white eyes for 90% of the episode <br>It's just like in my Taiwanese picture books!</br>  Just letting you guys know. <br><br>this is the autism we are dealing with in regards to this particular OP. <br><br>I made a thread towards the end of the last megathread that i ASSUME he made based on his reactions <br><br><br>which are...<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>and my favorite <br><br>after my thread had at LEAST 30 replies , he went into the big thread and did this<br><br><br><br><br>ultra man baby</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  There's a picture circulating about an anime-only Cerea wife end.<br>Please tell me this is a lie.</br>  <br> banned to /jp/ <br>You mean again?<br><br>And there's nothing wrong with multiple threads. This is a popular airing anime that just had a new episode release, of course people are going to want to talk about it. If someone has an OP worth creating a discussion about, they're welcome to post it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Link the picture at least.</br>  Will the online game be a browser-shit with a VN style?  what's a secondary?  <br>You.</br>  <br>Ladies and gentleman from MM threads. <br><br>This is a filthy animeonlyfag who made a thread just at 400 replies, doesn't even know the rules of /a/ and also just copy paste the OP of this thread  <br><br>Not even with all of that, his thread is fucking dead and full of shitpost. <br><br>Now report and ignore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> discussion <br>What discussion? There's nothing to discuss until a new manga chapter comes out</br></br>  should i watch it now or wait for bd   you'll never be subject to prejudice for dating a monster   <br>oh.</br>  Tfw cereals mother looks better than her  <br>Maybe you should try discussing the new episode that just aired, that's a fertile ground for conversation.</br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>How the fuck do you even hold a rifle with one eye in the centre of your head? You can't put a stock to your shoulder in this case. Bet she can only shoot with a bipod.</br>  <br>Autistic mods keep deleting it when it's posted.</br>  <br>Like a fine wine. Cerea will age well.</br>  USE THE CATALOG, CHRIST PEOPLE.  <br>Last thread still 400 reply when you making that, you seem don't know /a/ bump limit eh?</br>  <br> his thread is fucking dead and full of shitpost <br>From you. Good job. Now fuck off, tertiary.</br></br>  <br>Japan can't even do tits, Why wait for disappointing BD's.</br>  <br>Monster girls general on /jp/ =/= Monster Musume threads on /a/<br><br>Learn the difference, here we always have Hound or TF coming with new content, news or just for chilling, meanwhile /jp/ threads are just a circlejerking of furryfags.</br></br></br>  So I have to say, i really liked this new episode. It felt good seeing something you've been watching over for so long. I liked the Miia date scene (the little crab plushie was a nice touch) it was just how i hoped it'd be from the manga. <br><br>Really liked the catchy opening and ending songs.<br><br>The animations and technical aspects seem fine to me and in my opinion this episode was a solid 8.5-9/10. Thoughts?</br></br></br></br>  <br> tertiary <br><br>Newfag OP from the shitpost thead detected.</br></br></br>  <br> here we always have Hound or TF coming with new content, news or just for chilling, meanwhile /jp/ threads are just a circlejerking of furryfags <br>You can't be serious</br></br>  <br>You can't be this newfag.</br>  <br>I've been probably here more time than you.</br>   http://ch.nicovideo.jp/monmusu <br><br>Who's going to be subbing these?</br></br>  <br>The main question is if the studio is going to keep the same good quality until the end, from my point of view LERCHE spend all the budget here.</br>  <br>Thats precious, jumping from thee thou to you in one page. People whining about secondaries or whatever the hell the latest boogieman is and only make threads when the subbed version comes out.</br>  <br>Fuck off, quaternary.</br>  Centaurs are a cucks fucking wet dream <br><br>Get them horny by looking good then let some other guy fuck her brains out</br></br>  <br>The voice acting was almost uncannily good. I was expecting something much lower-effort and cheaper for this, but they really went all-out. The voices were almost perfect.<br><br>I'm genuinely surprised they put so much love into the adaptation, though we're still only on the first episode so it remains to be seen if the quality will maintain itself. I half expect it to shit the bed at some point. There's no way they plan to maintain this quality all the way through.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because the fucking male centaurs are ugly as fuck like a macho man with AIDS. At least Cerea's mom have taste. <br><br>But I really want to know if Cerea is a child born from human/centaur couple or she still one coming from centaur/centaur.</br></br></br>   no nipples   <br> Cerea's father was a human. </br>  <br> not watching tokyo-mx edition <br><br>You fucking newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>Human dick baby.</br>  <br>Is tokyo mx uncensored?<br>Actually, on that note which raws are the various sub groups using? I assume at least one group that isn't CR/funi or whatever garbage HS is ripping from will be using the uncensored raws.</br></br>  Would you do a Zombina?  <br>I don't even like horsepussy but I gotta admit her singing voice is immaculate.</br>  <br>What if I want to be able to understand what's happening to the anime tiddies? I don't speak chingchong</br>  <br> Rotten meat </br>  <br> muh /jp/ boogeyman <br>/jp/ threads have more content than these ones, while /a/ threads have been a bigger circlejerk since there's much less content to discuss (which it is normal because it is about EMG and maybe a bit of 12Beast<br><br> furryfags <br>They're more bittering at furry than /a/, which adore Polt<br><br><br>How can you know about the male centaurs and don't know about how's Cerea's father.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know, as a secondary, I feel it is only right to derail a thread full of elitist mangaonlyfags. Fuck you.  <br>Better than horse pussy anon.</br>    <br>Yep it is, at least the bath scene and others were uncensored. The only one with censorship have the hair over the boobs.</br>  <br> literally fujoshi inside and outside <br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>first quote meant for </br>  Tokyo-mx ver subbed when?    <br>Because  I'm gay. </br>  <br>Wasn't it said her father was human?<br><br>Her moms a hypocrite</br></br></br>  <br> Suu's rapeface <br><br>Glorious.</br></br></br>  <br>Where did you find a censored version to begin with?</br>  Why does a snake have ears?  I want to be tied up and milked by Rachnera until I'm a stupid pathetic sticky mess that isn't afraid of spiders anymore.  Smith confirmed for one of us.  <br>why does she have boobs</br>  These threads will never be decent ever again. Monmusu is finally popular.  <br>Is this show going to be the fsn of the season?</br>  <br> High quality version </br>  Holy shit, Ms. Smith stole the show, and the ending as a bonus too. Absolutely amazing.<br><br>I imagined Miia with a more genki voice rather than the high pitched cute type, but it's OK, I guess. I wish Jitsu wa Watashi wa got a first episode that good.</br></br>  <br>I want her to hold me tightly with her 8 legs and fuck me silly in her bed of webs and bite my neck injecting a neurotoxin that will keep my dick in diamond mode for ungodly hours <br><br>Then shell give birth to about 500 half spider half human children and the cycle will restart</br></br></br>  <br>I would read a spin off manga about them.</br>  <br>Nah, you need to do what these anons said, is easy to know who is a secondary shitposter and who is a veteran from MM threads.<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mero and Rachnera are out of order</br>  <br>It was good while it lasted</br>  <br>Fuck I love how they draw hands.</br>  I love how one secondary in the other thread was complaining that they were abusing the 'blank eye' face. <br>Fucking nigger doesn't know that he has that fucking face in more than half the manga unless he gets emotional or serious.</br>  <br> you need to do what what these anons said <br>Stop referring to yourself in the third person.</br></br>  Am I the only one who thinks the Ending song is so much better than the Opening? I mean Yu Kobayashi rocked it with everyone else better than ones in the Opening.  <br>It's time for an all out attack!</br>  <br>monster girl generals =/= monmusu anime threads</br>   Miia will never fly across a fucking room to fuck you   <br>Honestly he looks weird when he doesn't have the blank face, I'm not used to how he looks with eyes at all so I honestly feel a bit uncomfortable when he isn't in anti-spiral mode.</br>   First episode was actually great <br><br>I hope its successful so we can get those delicious monster girl figures.</br></br>  Ms. Smith re-confirmed for best girl.  http://<span>youtu.be/amXiceqtTto  [ ]<br><br>This fucking Ending though, so much better than the Opening.</br></br>  Projected episodes:(At the rate of 2 issues per episode)<br><br>Episode 2: Papi and Cerea introduced<br>Episode 3: Bath time with the girls and FULL MOON<br>Episode 4: Miia's deadly cooking and snake peeling followed by Cerea brushing down in the bath and Suu's arrival.<br>Episode 5: Suu carried off by Papi scared for her being deported, with Darling running off after Papi.

D Letter Finale with Date with the M.O.N.<br>Episode 12: Lala's introduction and inclusion into the Harem.<br><br>This, of course, precludes any 'extended scenes' or 'original content'. But if they stay on the same pattern for the next 12 episodes, they'll end with Lala.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just want it to be popular for the one percent chance of cute nonntr doujins.</br>  First time in a while I've seen an anime burn so many threads after release.  <br>Why not 24 episodes.</br>  If you watch carefully, you might spot some uncensored frames.<br><br>Was it on purpose?</br></br>  Anyone have a webm of Kurusu being smashed through the glass door?  <br>Lerche have balls.</br>  <br>Because the anime is probably just to boost the manga sales and there isn't enough content for 24 episodes.</br>  <br>What about the rachnera drama with her other shitty family? Also, what about the chapter were darling meets their mothers, I think that would be a better ending.</br>  This thread made by mangafag &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; thread made by secondary full of shitpost <br><br>LEARN THE DIFFERENCE PEOPLE.</br></br>  so it might be good <br><br>thank god we live in this time period</br></br>  DAH-LING  <br> Am I the only one who thinks the Ending song is so much better than the Opening? <br>the ED is metal</br></br>  <br>'cause they're doing 2 issues an episode and there are only 35 monmusu issues. There isn't enough for 24 unless they slow down and stop doing 2 an episode, add in some slice of life filler, and expand things.<br><br><br>We wouldn't get to it unless they do more then 12 episodes. If they did 17, it'd be able to end at the current issue.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lerche banned from nipponTV, confirmed.<br>Also those are some delicious looking nipples.</br></br>  <br>I just want to see the gym pool chapter animated.</br>  <br> that tongue peek <br>she knows what she wants</br></br>  <br>Polt's intro. Episode 9.<br><br>I'm looking forward to episode 8 the most.</br></br></br>  I have a bad felling that the anime is going to drop in quality after the first episode. I mean Lerche is adapting 3 shows this season.<br><br>Quality control is gonna happen.</br></br>  the voice of smith is the ninja girl from gintama isn't it?   tfw a MonsMusume anime is actually happening   <br>www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QALSx1w3EgE<wbr></wbr>  [ ]<br><br>the VA who sings this song</br></br></br>  Is anyone else besides &gt;crunchyroll picking this up?  <br>I was really surprised when I noticed Kobayashi was actually singing an ED, I can't wait for the full version.

What the fuck did you expect?</br></br>  <br> Tio's QUALITY </br>  <br>Well, we can look forward to the Orc episode at episode 6. Then MON showing up regularly through the D saga. Ending with the big date of the three girls.</br>  <br> implying you can self insert into the based Lord that is darling </br>  <br><br><br>To be fair, if you watch the ED up until that point, Tio's ass continues much higher then it is shown there. Its just failure to draw the crack or a bit of perspective.<br><br>She has one hell of an ass.</br></br></br></br></br>  Link to uncensored version?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0PH<wbr>bR3xf6Vs</wbr>  [ ]</br>  The way Miia is animated, the way Smith is voiced, even making me like scenes I didn't care for before this is 10/10  <br> screamo <br>I have no idea what that is</br></br>  <br>Of course<br><br> Dat sexy Ms Smith voice <br>damn<br><br>Just right now I'm finally able to watch the episode.

I want uncensored but also want to actually understand it.</br>  <br>oh okay now i know why anime was invented<br><br>that girl is ugly as fuck and the only way to salvage her is to remove her pretty voice from the body <br><br>this whole thing isnt escapism for the japanese. <br><br>its simply transhumanism</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=downl<wbr>oad&amp;tid=1635599</wbr> <br>its fucking boku no pico newfag</br></br>  <br>It's subbed, alright.</br>  <br> Is this what JoJo felt?</br>  <br>Yeah, it's subbed.<br><br>Just the CR subs re-timed, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly what I mean by personality inversion, Anon. Integra is pure. Smith is lewd. Integra drinks tea. Smith drinks coffee. Dark skin, blonde hair. Pale skin, Dark hair.<br><br>Same haircut. Business outfits.<br><br>Integra is devoted to her minions and a workaholic.<br>Smith is the epitome of a lazy boss and loves to slack at work.<br><br>Integra is a virgin. Smith wants the D.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's what every manga fanbase with an anime adaptation feels.</br>  Should have known monster girl fags were incapable of keeping their shit in one thread. Mods had a good reason to kick them the fuck off /a/.  <br>Would you want a Smith with cigars?</br>  <br><br>I knew trusting people on the internet would bite me one day.<br><br><br>Now are YOU pulling my leg or if I got to Nyaa myself will I actually be able to find what you've described?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean every fanbase with translated source material, right?</br>  <br>No no, she is an inversion. So Smith would smoke cheap cigarettes. Not expensive cigarillos like Integra.</br>  <br><br>Pretty sure JoJo got hit a lot worse than your usual popular manga adaption.</br></br>  <br>You sure about that?<br><br> I used to read Shingeki before it was cool </br></br></br>  Sorry, but Tio's hip is broken.  <br>it also got hit with memesters who got further into jojo just to get more dank memes<br><br>gay priest soon</br></br></br>  It's pure garbage but I'm going to keep watching it anyway and I don't know why.  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>slut</br>  <br>When will we get more dank memes?</br>  <br>Oh, I'm sorry anon.</br>     never really been that attracted to smith  <br> she a fun character but if i wanted to watch someone fuck a human i would pick random harem shit #456 <br> anime comes out  <br>IS IT HER VOICE?</br></br></br>  <br>same.</br>  <br>Just take it for what it is.

When in the preview is it?</br>  <br> Ill never get to ask centaur for her hand in marriage. <br>Man she would be comfy as fuck to be around, and I could lay atop of her back and cuddle.</br></br>  <br>She wants to be NTR'd, yeah.</br>  <br>Well, sure. But how many ancient stories are there which don't involve demi-human monsters praying on humans and instead being doting waifus?</br>  <br>I was very, very pleased. But I blindly love anything with Kobayashi Yuu, so there you have it.</br>  <br>Consensual NTR where it's a woman getting hurt, I might be able to fap to this.</br>  <br> implying he isn't <br>he's the exact same in the manga<br><br>my favorite badass scene of his is when he tempts death with all those fucking death flags</br></br></br></br>  <br>If anything you can blame this show on Greece.<br><br>Lamia, Centaur, Mermaids, Harpy, Arachne. These all originated in Greece.<br><br>Cyclops? Greece.<br>Dullahan? Ireland.<br>Oni? That one you can blame on Japan<br>Zombie? Everywhere.<br>Doppleganger? Everywhere.<br>Kobold? Germany.<br>Dragonewt? Everywhere.<br>Dryad? Druids.<br>Succubus? The Jews.<br>Slime? Who the fuck knows. The Blob. Dragon Quest. D&amp;D. Sortof came into being. Man eating slime isn't a very well known origin but it seems to come from a lot of places.<br><br>So really, there are a lot of peoples to blame here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Greece is truly the greatest civilization of all time. Too bad they are so far in the gutter these days.</br>  <br> ask for her hand in marriage <br><br>Not exactly how it works with Monmusu universe centaurs. Enjoy being a teaser, unless you can knock out a male centaur.<br><br><br> the jews are responsible for my hentaifu <br>I was aware of the origins, but the realization hit me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> was smith masturbating? </br>  I didn't like it at all.<br><br>To be clear. Never read the source material. But I feel like the anime adaptation is top-notch bordering on perfect. But that I don't like the source material. Not because of the monstergirls themselves, monstergirls are great! But it's still a harem.<br><br>So when in an episode you see shit like "if a monster hurts a human, it's game over" mentionned explicitely AFTER she fucking chokes him several times and dislocates his goddamn shoulder, it feels pretty annoying. And when you've got the lamia flaunting her tits in the bath, post-tailgasm, and then calls that MC a pervert, I'm pretty annoyed.<br><br>I know it's details, but it's the kind of details that irritated me since Love Hina. And awesome fetishes included or not, it will keep annoying me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought Smith and Zombina would have bigger tits...huh</br>    <br> Never read the source material. </br>  <br>In Jewish mythology, I believe Lilim would kidnap Jewish shotas or whatever.</br>  Bloody hell. I fall asleep near the end of the live thread, and two others archived by the time I'm awake.  Finally a good harem to enjoy after the complete shitfest that was Yahari.  <br><br>Don't be fooled by that shot, they have rockin' tits in closeups.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder if the Grecian monster girls have Greek Myth origins. Exploring that would be pretty fun.<br><br>The original Arachne being a weaver who boasted she could make better tapestries then Athena, the goddess of weaving.<br><br>Athena told her 'The hell you say!' and challenged her to a duel.<br><br>Athena 'won' but Arachne denied it and still said she was the better weaver.<br><br>Athena smote. Then examined the tapestry. Realizing it /was/ better then hers, she turned Arachne instead into a spider. To forever contemplate challenging the gods.<br><br>Thus was born the all female race of Arachne who, in those days, were more feral and mindless. Raping, murdering, eating. Taking men for sex and food, and women for food and possibly wombs for eggs. Depends on who you ask.<br><br>And by the generations they have grown less monstrous and more intelligent and thriving.<br><br>Thus, Rachnera.<br><br>I want this to be the real origin story of the Arachne</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why must you bring in other series to start shit?<br><br> Before you call me out, I avoided the threads like the plague. </br></br></br>   love spirit bomb in the OP <br><br>fucking crabman making me grin like an idiot this whole episode<br><br>i fucking love him</br></br></br></br>  <br> Never read the source material </br>  Cute.  I feel kind of bad Lala isn't going to be in the series.  <br>Yes. Its her day off. She used Darling's voice to get herself off and moans into the phone at him as she cums.<br><br><br><br><br>Yeah, Smith and Zombina have about the same size as Lala and Mero. IE, Ds.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Never read the source material <br> But that I don't like the source material <br>found the retard</br></br></br>  <br> To be clear. Never read the source material. <br> Stop reading there <br><br>Secondary fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at this: <br><br>She will be if we keep going 2 issues an episode. The last episode will be Lala's two intro issues.</br></br></br>  <br><br>cameo in the last ep, dattebayo<br><br><br><br> you will never smack an in-game lamia the same way again </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, she is barely even in the manga at this point.</br>  Next week cannot come soon enough.  <br> Pic related </br>  <br> Never read the source material <br><br><br>but I agree for the most part.</br></br></br></br>  <br> lamia sprites <br><br>Reminded me of my earlier vidya days.</br></br></br>  <br>Well later they actually acknowledge that fact even to the point where "I like you BECAUSE you don't hurt me" <br>But I see where you're coming from, the standard harem girl who beats the shit out of him for walking in on her and seemingly hates him not even in a tsun way. But the first few chapters are really the only timeswhen they call him a pervert. Later they just try to rape him anyway.</br></br>  <br> you don't mind if I beat that thing, right? </br>  <br> So when in an episode you see shit like "if a monster hurts a human, it's game over" mentionned explicitely AFTER she fucking chokes him several times and dislocates his goddamn shoulder, it feels pretty annoying. And when you've got the lamia flaunting her tits in the bath, post-tailgasm, and then calls that MC a pervert, I'm pretty annoyed. <br><br>Eh, I know how you feel. But, if you do read the source material, MC has got  god-like endurance , so he won't really be injured very much (in serious scenes anyway). Also, you are talking about the very common double standard in anime. It's nothing, really. It's ecchi. You should not be looking for nuanced discussions about particle physics in Monster Musume.</br></br></br>  <br>Hound we all know you're going to masturbate every night with that ED specially with tio.</br>  <br>Tit Size Chart of Main Harem:<br><br>Cerea, Rachnera, Miia, Mero/Lala, Papi.<br><br>And Suu can be any size she fucking wants.<br><br>For the bigger cast:<br><br>Tio, Cerea, Rachnera, Miia, Polt, Lala/Mero/Smith/Lala, Draco, Succubus Girl/Papi.

I want to kiss Miia  <br>Fucking love you man, thanks!</br>  <br>Not exactly how it works with Monmusu universe centaurs. Enjoy being a teaser, unless you can knock out a male centaur.<br><br>Well to be fair, the centaur comes onto a Japanese student, and I think my dick is far bigger then any Japanese mans.<br>Least I still have the wuffer girl and jogging.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was mentioned(someone had asked Crab on Twitter) that Mero is E(same as Lala), which puts her above Polt.</br>  <br>I want her drool for breakfast.</br>  <br>You hate having fun? since when you're a boring person Hound?</br>  <br>Have you read the manga, anon? They fall in love with humans to get in the mood, so male centaurs can mate with them.</br>  I want   Hold   Darling.  <br>Horse pussy next week, so he'll probably be too busy to post after Papi's debut.</br>  <br> vlc <br><br>Hound c'mon, at least change the filename</br></br></br>  <br> those teeth <br> drool </br></br>  <br><br><br> you will never jerk off your own snake body <br><br>source is here for future reference<br><br>http://ch.nicovideo.jp/monmusu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wow, where is this from?</br>  How long until someone subs the OP?  <br>  to be honest anon, I haven't had time, Ive been working my ass off lately and its almost like having a backlog of video games. When I do have time to indulge in these things I go to get it and then put it back because " I'm to tired to be havin this" so I watched today's episode while cooking dinner. </br>  <br>No.</br>    <br>Is Papi's hair made of feathers too?</br>  <br>Oh yes, she is probably bigger then Tio. Or as big. Tio is pretty fucking huge.<br><br><br>I want her lovebite on my neck and her fangs to sink in, injecting me with powerful aphrodesiac venom... ...not that she has that. But one can dream. She is clearly more the boa constrictor type.</br></br></br></br>  Umm...<br>Wat do, /a/?</br>  People talking about how Smith is Best Girl. Soon I won't even need to post a reminder.  Also, that Doppel's voice. Not even close at what was I thinking. Way more mature. Besides she's way hotter now  <br>say yes</br>  <br> If you lack time, read a chapter a day before you go to sleep, optionally on a mobile device if needed while you lie in bed, only shaves off a few minutes off your sleeptime. </br>   its 2015 and a monmusu anime with this level of quality animation is currently airing and I am alive to witness this unfold before me <br><br>what a fucking time in humanity's vast history to be born in</br></br>  End was cool  <br>Run</br>  <br> Looks like it's time to oil up! <br>Any version with sound?

Fuck off to </br></br></br>  <br>But i'm not dunkfag.</br>  <br>I think she's cute though, catgirl with that eyeliner looks nice.</br>  <br> what if I'm a 3d modeler , pretty sure doom is one too, he also animates 2d</br>  <br>It will. Drawfags can be creative with this request.</br>  <br>As someone who's learned about the 3D pipeline, the amount of work needed for a good looking model eclipses what's being made in this thread. I personally don't think it's worth the effort.</br>  <br>That's not very useful. The point is to have as little abstraction as possible, not copy someone else's abstraction. <br>Unless you do photo-realistic rendering but that would be a bit too much work I think.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I assumed as much. Still, it's nice to know there's some talented people lurking the threads.</br></br>  it would be nice if we had more drawfags as talented as archvermin  Requesting Mako from KLK in a shark suit, due to it being shark week and all that  <br>Yeah, I don't know why we keep getting these noobs</br>  <br><br>We're trying our best.<br><br>Requesting waifus isn't gonna help us get better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably because most good artists would rather get paid?

I’ve been so busy these days… I’m sorry. <br> Carla: My husband worries about you a lot. <br> Shadis: Really? <br> Carla: Mr. Keith… Do you really plan on living like this, dying for the cause? <br>*trigger warning*<br> Shadis: Do you know why commoners could keep living and mind their own business until their death? <br> Shadis: It’s because they lack imagination. That’s why they will never find their raison d’etre even until death. This is also why they are able to live shamelessly through the remainder of their pathetic lifespan, eating and shitting leisurely without any fucking worries. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You had one job retard.</br>  <br>Poor guy, I could feel his frustration when he saw Carla and the kid after all he heard.</br>  <br>Sounds like someone is angry that his waifu had a kid with the man who cucked him and is letting it all out.</br>  <br>Now I want a scene with Kenny and Keith shitting on everyone else around them.</br>  <br> "what the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch?" </br>  <br>Keith a shit.

He was just a beta cuck.</br>  <br>No wonder the guy broke down crying after 10 years of being cucked and being useless</br>  <br> Shadis: Bringing back accomplishment is not something someone ordinary could do. There are lots of things they don’t understand (sorry translation kinda fails here but there are some traditional letters I can’t read) <br><br> Shadis: For someone who easily falls in love with a man who took care of you, but is otherwise completely talentless beside being able to bring booze for other people, you would never understand anything! <br> Shadis: That's right </br></br></br></br>  <br>So last month Mikasa got cucked, now this month it was Keith. Who will it be next month?</br>  <br>He fought to save humanity. He tried to become head leader to win her respect. He even got the medicine to save her. If it wasn't for meddling grisha she would had fallen for him</br>  <br>Keith saying it like it is.</br>  <br>This is me after every step of hearing Kuckth's backstory. Truly glorious.</br>  <br>Dammit, Shadis is so butthurt I feel bad for him.</br>  <br>Enough with the cuck shit. It's unfunny and retarded.</br>  <br> For someone who easily falls in love with a man who took care of you, but is otherwise completely talentless beside being able to bring booze for other people, you would never understand anything! <br> telling her off for being a barmaid <br>Shadis confirmed for shittiest potential husbando.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not going to be sad for a delusional HURR I'M SPECIAL piece of shit who kept attacking titans mindlessly due to his own fucking ego instead of taking some advice to minimize casualties.</br>  "Nothing Happens" - The Chapter  <br>And how should Carla have known that he was trying to impress her?

Eren should punch him in the face for talking to his mother like that.</br>  <br>Everyone wanted cucking last chapter and now they got it</br>  <br>Who head is on the chopping block? His not erwin.

I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the trainee corps, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Wall Maria, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in monkey warfare and I’m the top soldier in the entire Scouting Legion. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over Shiganshina? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of central MP across the Walls and your horse is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the hidden technological advancement of the central MP and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, titan. </br>  <br> Shadis: This is my last mission… <br> Shadis: Why would I do something like this? <br> Maria has fallen! <br> Titans are approaching Wall Rose! <br> Shadis: I’ve always been played by the natural course of history… <br> Shadis: Why would I create such a big misunderstanding? <br> Grisha: Shadis! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't he only quit years later when Eren is older?</br>  <br>we don't know because it a 2 year gap.</br>   all that suffering <br>No wonder he went bald. I can relate about wanting to break the borders and then getting humiliated.</br>  <br>Nevermind, I just noticed </br>  <br> Alas, I’m not that special person <br>He changed his mind pretty quickly.</br></br>  <br>He caused his own suffering for being such an arrogant, beta cuck.</br>  <br> Shadis: Ahh… I remember… <br> Shadis: It’s all because of you… <br> Soldier: Shingenshina has been annihilated! <br> Soldier: If we don’t defend Trost to death, we’ll all get fucked over by the titans! <br> Grisha: The shelters! I’m sure my family will be there! <br> Shadis: Let’s split and find them! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of feel bad for him here. But it was his fault for thinking in terms of how he looked to others, instead of what he was doing.</br>  <br>SL is special. Keith is not. And that's why quitted SL.</br>  <br>Wait, what the hell is going on here?</br>  <br>At some point, everyone thinks they're special.<br>People just don't say it out loud in order not to sound arrogant.</br></br>  <br> Shadis: Ahh… I remember… <br> Shadis: It’s all because of you… <br>So much salt</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't see any salt what are you guys talking about?<br><br>Isn't salt currency?</br></br></br></br>  <br> *Petra &amp; Auruo cameo* <br> Shadis: Carla… Where are you? <br> Shadis: I want to apologize for what I’ve said before… where are you? <br> Grisha: Wake up, Eren… <br> Eren: ugh…. Papa? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's no reason to take it out on an innocent woman, he didn't even fucking try to win her, he has no right to get butthurt when she chose someone else.</br>  <br>Wrong page chinkfag</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>This nigga.</br>  <br>I'm not no nigga.</br>  <br>If his chuuni is affecting his work and leading to preventable deaths, it becomes an issue.</br>  <br>Sorry pict related is the page. <br><br><br>this is pg. 32. <br> Eren: Mama...

Please don’t come with us. <br> Shadis: Wait. Are you gonna ask your son to avenge? <br> Shadis: If all you wanted was to avenge Carla… Why can’t you do it yourself? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Shadis: You are not like me… You’re someone special. <br> Shadis: I see that kid isn’t one either… right? <br> Shadis: Perhaps he isn’t the chosen one either. <br> Shadis: Right? Are you really gonna curse the rest of his life? <br> Shadis: If he’s not the one to do this job, what will you do then? <br> Grisha: This child isn’t like you. He is my son. <br> Grisha: Please… Stop meddling in our affairs. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>BTFO</br>  <br> Shadis: Lightening? </br>  <br> I-I'm not the only one who is not special Grisha! Y-your kid too! <br>This guy is cringeworthy.</br></br>  <br>The situation is really common, Isayama just escalated it.</br>  <br><br> Shadis: If all you wanted was to avenge Carla… Why can’t you do it yourself? <br> still didn't get a fucking answer <br>Goddammit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shadis: Afterward, I brought you back to the shelter… And this is all I know. </br>  <br>So he already killed the Reiss at this point? Or is it supposed to happen soon?</br>  <br>The Reiss knew Grisha, they were gonna hunt him down.</br>  <br>Based Grisha.</br>  <br>So Mikasa didn't have to do anything with this afterall.</br>  <br>So was Keith indirectly the reason for Eren getting the coordinate instead of Grisha doing it himself?</br>    <br>He was eaten by Eren right after that, so he already killed Reiss by this point.</br>  <br>Common or not, Keith a shit.</br>  <br>That's weird though. I bet she was just pretending to be sleeping and followed them.</br>  <br>I don't think Keith said those.</br>  <br>"The Reiss" is just Rod and some MPs. Grisha killed them all and took the coordinate remember?</br>  <br> Eren: This is all…? <br> Shadis: That’s all. <br> Hanji: Now I finally understand why someone so experienced like you would retire from the front line to the training corps. <br> Hanji: You aren’t doing this to amend for your fruitless efforts which caused so many comrades to die in vain… <br> Hanji: You’re doing this after realizing that you are no longer that special someone, and that you’ve developped this intense inferiority and guilt complex. Right? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>IF I SEE THAT TITAN ONE MORE TIME....</br>  <br> Hanji is disappoint </br>  <br>Fucking Hanjo preaching the truth.</br>  <br> hating irrelevant characters <br>How do you deal with life with such autism?</br></br>  <br>PUTAIN CA CLASH DIRECT</br>  <br>I thought Hanji was going to smack him down and call him a pathetic loser too for a second.</br>  <br>But where the hell was Grisha's corpse?</br>  <br>He's raging about his special complex. It's gotta be him.<br><br><br> Hanji: You retreated back here for such a childish reason… <br> Levi: Hanji, stop. <br> Hanji: You don’t get to pick and choose how important those information are.  <br> Hanji: Stop relating these to your own goddamn inferiority complex. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Biggest mystery so far. It could have evaporated. It could be that after shifters die, their bodies evaporate.</br>  <br>Wow, I thought I was the only Muslim in this thread. are you a girl maybe?</br>  <br>Eren's bubble?</br>  <br> pointing out facts <br> hate </br></br>  <br>You forgot some lines</br>  <br> It's gotta be him. <br>The arrows don't point at him though. If anything, it would sound like Grisha throwing irony.</br></br>  <br>Funny how Isayama shits on all the characters who were badass or cool when they were introduced. There are no heroes in this world.</br>  <br>Looks like you skipped the last two bubbles</br>  <br>His clothes too?</br>  <br><br><br>Is this the new Leviface?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the shifter bodies evaporate like the titan's after the spine is out</br>  <br> Hanji: the so called “give your heart to humanity” all for the same reason, right? <br> Eren: Please stop, Squad Leader Hanji. <br><br> Eren: The instructor is right. I’m.. nothing special. <br> Eren: I just happen to be the son of that special someone. <br> Eren: This is the reason why Dad passed down his titan power to me. <br> Eren: What a relief now I finally found the cause of this… <br> Shadis: Your mom… once told me something like this. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eren was conscious after eating Grisha. He probably walked a bit before collapsing.</br>  <br>MT is gonna turn out to be some pathetic loser too and when that day comes I will be 10/10 mad.</br>  <br>It could've also be just too dark to see. Or Isayama being shit at consistency nothing new etc.</br>  <br>Never. MT is not like Keith or Eren, this guy is the real deal.</br>    Oh great, more unrequited love. Where have I seen this shit before? Certainly not between Eren and Mikasa, or Mikasa and Jean, or Petra and Auruo, or Marie and Erwin. What an original idea for Shadis to have unrequited love for Carla.<br><br>Isayama's writing is bad and he should feel bad. Every month I ask myself why I'm still reading this shit manga.</br></br>  <br> Carla: Does it really matter that he’s not special? <br> Carla: That he won't be acknowledged by everyone else? <br> Carla: I don't think so. <br> Carla: At least, I acknowledge this child… <br><br><br><br>Sorry I put these here </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know it deep down that his reason for attacking humanity is because they killed his waifu.</br>  <br>Because we need to see what's in the basement</br>  <br>You're reading the manga to funpost with us.</br>  <br>This is Keith's flashback after all, and Mikasa is a ninja.</br>  <br>I sure hope so. I don't want Armin to be the only intelligent mastermind in the series. Rod and Kenny were fucking idiots and I hope MT doesn't end up like them too.</br>  <br>I'll be waiting for your tears, anon.</br>  <br> tfw no carla </br>  <br> Carla: Even if he couldn't become someone accomplished <br> Carla: Nor could he become better than anyone else… I don’t care. <br> Carla: Because look, <br> Carla: look at how cute he is... </br></br></br></br>  <br> What an original idea for Shadis to have unrequited love for Carla. <br>The point was to show the humiliation, not some love triangle.</br></br>  <br>You're clearly it , but don't have the guts to say it<br>:^)</br></br>  <br>I was going to say something like this. Grisha was already a well known man, he couldn't have fit in for a bit like Eren did.</br>  Did Carla know about Grisha's real identity? Would have been shitty if she died without knowing.  <br> Carla: After all, he is born into this world. <br> Carla: And to me, this is already such a big feat... </br></br>  <br> Eren saying how cute Eren looks <br>Why is this pic so disturbing.</br></br>  <br>You clearly love it* <br><br>fuck im tired</br></br></br>  <br>There's differences, though. It isn't all the same.<br>Keith hoped he'd get noticed (by not just Carla but everyone) by becoming commander and it fell on its face, Erwin realised he'd have to abandon the idea to go with what's more important.</br></br>  <br>My nigga, Hanji.</br>  <br>He's not really that cute.</br>  <br>Eren looks cute on this page.</br>  <br>He is cute in that panel. He stopped being cute once he started to grow.</br>  <br> 3 years ago <br> Shadis: That’s the look… <br> Shadis: Just like his father had thought, this kid will… <br> Shadis: Burn away his own life, and become a pile of ashes outside the walls. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Tell that to any mom.</br>  <br>Wasn't Keith talking about Carla? Why is she retorting with Eren now?<br> derailing </br></br>   no manlet lines <br>Thank you based Isayama</br>  Eren was fat  <br> become a pile of ashes outside the walls </br>  <br>He had a few lines. Chinkfag is just based.</br>  <br>You can see the poop thought bubbles whenever he shows up.</br>  <br>Too much milk</br>  <br> All of his mother’s effort will turn into dust without himself knowing. <br> Shadis: You don’t belong here. Please live the way you've always wanted... </br></br>  <br>So Mikasa was actually innocent.</br>  <br> keith sabotaged his gear since the beginning <br> managed to pass his test anyways <br>Keith is the biggest failure and cuck in SnK</br></br></br>  <br> Burn away his own life, and become a pile of ashes outside the walls. <br>Eren a kill confirmed.<br> Not like this is any news, obviously. </br></br></br>  <br>TWEEEST IT WAS SHARDIS ALL ALONG!!<br>THAT GUY is such a joker lol</br></br>  <br>Which one? There are 3</br>  <br>And here I thought it was Connie and Jean who had messed with his belt.</br>  <br><br><br>Carla best mom</br></br></br>  <br>Where have you been for the past 2 days? Living under a rock?</br>  <br> Shadis: I see… <br> Shadis: In the end, I’m no one but a bystander. <br> Shadis: I don’t have the strength to change anything… <br><br>Despite putting all his might and sacrificing everything for the fight, he still wasn’t able to win anything back. Such fights do exist in this world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And people thought it was Mikasa.</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br> Destroys his gear in order to let Eren live as he always wanted <br> Eren has always wanted to fuck off with the SL <br>Sasuga Keith.</br></br></br>  <br>I misread it and I thought you wrote Tardis, top kek.</br>  <br>He failed tho, Keith passed him</br>  <br>Keith is the biggest failure in SnK and now his deathflags have risen to unimaginable heights.</br>  <br>Thank you chinese translator friend</br>  <br>Based chinkfag, thank you.</br>  <br>Poor Keith</br>  <br> Where have you been for the past 2 days? Living under a rock? <br>On /tv/ discussing the new episode of true detective</br></br>  <br>Thank you, Chinkfag.</br>  <br> Despite putting all his might and sacrificing everything for the fight, he still wasn’t able to win anything back. Such fights do exist in this world. <br>Kek. The finality of those words. Thank you based chinkfag.</br></br>  <br>Who's going to be knocked down a peg or ten next?</br>  <br>Much appreciated chinkfag<br><br>The chapter was ok</br></br></br>  <br>Connie probably. He's going to visit his mom and MT is in Shiganshina.</br>  <br>Thank you, chinkfag. We missed you.</br>  <br>This was a nice chapter in my opinion.</br>  Now that I read it, I also thought it was nice.  <br> Despite putting all his might and sacrificing everything for the fight <br>His own fault he was too hung up on being special that he missed opportunities that got dumped in his lap.<br><br> finds a guy with suspicious backstory outside walls, lets it go <br> ignores new tactics </br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746556 <br>It wasn't "good" it was "okay" the pacing is atrocious as always</br>  <br>Thank you based chinkfag</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746556 <br>It was ok. I think the fact that it was entertaining watching Keith The Failure helped a lot than if it would have just been Jaeger backstory.</br>  Young Erwin is the only thing that matters in this chapter.  Take the cuck shit back to /pol/ and /v/.  <br>Thank you. <br><br>I know some people find them boring but I enjoy these kinds of chapters, this and 69 were really good at getting the perspective of others. Also the differences between Shadis and Erwin as characters are really striking now. <br><br>Can't imagine how much worse it felt having a squad leader try to suggest something that saves lives, rejecting it, only to return and realise that was the best option. Pretty late to do so, really.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks like a balding abomination.</br>  <br>The only thing what mattered was Keith getting cucked.</br>  <br>NTR doesn't have a good noun.</br>  <br> fujos <br>please kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Isayama didn't even attempt to make him look young. I guess it makes sense since it shouldn't have been too long ago.</br>  <br>He doesn't look any different and only fujos cared for his irrelevant panel. Why did people think it was an Erwin chapter again?</br>  Why didn't Keith simply drug Eren, put him in a barmaid dress and rape him?  <br>He looks so dreamy<br><br><br><br>Really? His cranial feature is much smoother.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wish it had more meat to it but it was ok. People will now shut up abut Mikasa fucking up Eren's gear.<br><br><br>Did Keith resign right after that? Seems like he was only asking Erwin at that point and hadn't made any moves to step down yet.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because someone of tumblr overblew it saying that Isayama said in an interview that it would be an Erwin chapter even though the only thing he said was that younger Erwin would make an appearance</br>  <br>fake spoilers</br>  <br>He will soon.<br><br><br>It's because Isayama said in a conference that Erwin will be featured in the next chapter, and the exploration into his mysteries has just begun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not sure, I assumed he'd be in Keith's flashback based on the more reliable spoilers. People just took Isayama's words too far, but he did show what he said, which was basically the part where Keith hands over command. He only said younger Erwin. <br><br><br>This too.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br> isayama <br> cohesive <br><br>anon, pls.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br>Now I can't look at Yeager household and not think of Keith's cucked face. Damn you Isayama.</br>  <br>Based chinkfag saving this shitty chapter</br>  <br>I didn't see anyone here say that.<br>Isayama told OnoD that Erwin would be featured, and that he finally has his backstory fully formed in his mind.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br>The way Keith's expressions were drawn distracts you from thinking that that's bad writing.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br> typical "I'm better than these normalfags" chuuni got BTFO like he deserved <br> unique </br></br>  <br>What do you expect from Erenfags?</br>  <br> For someone who easily falls in love <br><br>If it were that easy he would have gotten her.</br></br></br>  <br>i'm an erenfag too and even i'm not that delusional.</br>  <br>You definitely are since you're dumb.</br>  <br>Get better taste.</br>  <br>kek</br>  Anything new about next month's big announcement?  What about Q&amp;As?  <br>An announcement of more boring chapters.</br>  <br> being an Erenfag </br>  <br>Oh right. I forgot this was /a/. <br><br>I apologize for not speaking in hyperboles and for not making generic comments about how everything is shit without ever explaining it,</br></br></br>  <br> Keith realizing he's fictioinal and not MC <br>Being him is endless suffering</br></br>  <br>based</br>  <br>Most of the characters in this manga are shit. It doesn't matter who I choose.</br>  <br>http://strawpoll.me/4857769</br>  Why do I get this weird feelings that Bert will go bald too?  <br>He is already starting to bald.</br>  <br>Because he's already balding</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746556 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746826 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127746966 <br>I don't get why these were deleted.</br></br></br>  <br> people voting for anything over a 5 <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br>  <br>Keith and Erenfags.</br>  <br>or you could just grow a thicker skin, faggot.</br>  <br>I voted above average because we got some much needed answers about Grisha</br>  Where did mina go?  <br>nigga, she's been dead. for countless volumes.</br>  <br>C2 please, his hairline is fine  I hope </br>  <br>Like?</br>  <br>Not balloonhead.</br>  <br>Like he's a wall foreigner<br>He's a spy<br>We know what happened during that night of the injection</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Done already because most of them are fucking baseless and obnoxious parroting.</br>  <br>He's already a conehead with a ten inch hairline.</br>  <br>We already knew all of those things and where are you getting the spy idea from?</br>  wow there wasn't a single mention of Historia of Ymir in this thread until now  <br>Great job retard.</br>  <br>No we didn't. It was all just speculation at first but now it's confirmed.<br> where are you getting the spy idea from? <br>Because he was asking questions non-stop</br></br></br>  <br>Many thanks Chinkfag</br>  This is irrelevant but I want to point out this horse's ass. Isayama can't even draw a proportionate horse ass.  <br>what do you think Ymir is going to do after this chapter's developments?</br>  <br>Or Reiner or Connie</br>  <br>Annie please, contain yourself</br>  <br>then jump into a titan mouth</br>  <br>I bet he can.</br>  <br>Jesus Christ</br>  <br>Jean would tap that.</br>  <br> where are you getting the spy idea from? <br>He obviously lied about forgetting things and asked for the customs to a point that even Keith became suspicious.</br></br>  <br>Probably banned for shitposting elsewhere.</br>  <br>Does Bert's hairline keep Bertfags up at night?</br>  Speculation time.<br><br>Did Grisha truly forget? I don't think so, or if he did, he remembered soon enough.<br><br>He says he admired the SL and I think that's true, he didn't disapprove of Eren wanting to go outside and was ready to entrust him with the secret of the basement. Anyone think Grisha was building up to something big that would help humanity and the SL out, only to be interrupted by BRA?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br>He was in the walls for 20 years. How long does it take to built a super weapon if his civilization is so advance.</br>  <br>Probably Islamfag thinking he can ban evade on 4chan.</br>  So Grisha was fighting off titans near the Shiganshina district. What was he doing there? Did he want to breach the gate but decided against it? Or was he really looking for shelter and by doing so he pretended to be someone who suffered memory loss, there's no way he knew that Shadis would be coming right?  <br>I have constant nightmares about it.</br>  <br>He's also alone, juggling work and family. It's believable that it might take a while to develop the perfect serum or whatever.</br>    So did Carla ever know who Grisha really was? What he is? Because if she died thinking he was just a normal doctor, that's even sadder.<br><br>Carla deserved better.</br></br>  <br>I don't think she knew anything. Sad.</br>  <br>Kek.</br>  <br> Carla deserved better. <br><br>Not really. She was a plain jane tavern sloot who was lucky enough to marry a doctor.</br></br></br>  <br> marrying the one man she fell in love with makes her a slut <br>Keith please.</br></br>  <br>i kek'd</br>  <br>He arrived in the wall in 831. he married carla in 835. He had 5 years of bachelorhood to built a weapon.</br>  <br>You know she got around well enough before that.</br>  <br><br>Also five year of not being suspicious :)</br></br>  <br>yep, I think the epidemic changed him because he fell in love with carla.</br>   Shadis was never the generic badass instructor <br> he was just a cucked manchild who was taking out his frustration on children who couldn't fight back <br> the kids still beat him anyway (Eren overcoming the tampered maneuver gear) </br></br>  <br>Being Keith is suffering.</br>  <br>Atleast he has Anka now.</br>  Was there even a need for Shadis to have been in love with Carla? I can't think of a single reason it needed to be that way.  <br>To make him even more miserable. To make him want to butches Eren's belt because he loved Carla and wanted Eren out of the army.</br>  <br>To justify him breaking Eren's gear or even bothering to help him after he ate Grisha.</br>  <br>Just like Reiner asking question about Erens titan and his formation during the female titan arc and Trost. Grisha was faking memory loss.</br>  Well, at least Shadis held no grudge against Eren  <br>Anon...</br>  <br>To self insert. He probably got humiliated in front of his crush too.</br>  So what shows have you dropped based on their first episodes?<br>pic related.</br>  <br>The fuck were you expecting?</br>  It was just so dull.  <br>A comedy series. I wasn't expecting the male-targeted version of Diabolik Lovers. <br>Have you dropped any series yet this season?</br></br>    <br>Fucking anime only fag</br>  Elven Lied, especially after the piss scene.  <br> muh source material <br>It still sucks</br></br>  <br> dropping the show thats going to get the most talkback threads on /a/ this season <br><br>do you hate fun?</br></br></br>  <br>holy shit you're lucky, i watched that entire shitstain before realizing it was garbage</br>  <br>well doll tits ... is way better than a pink flash like to love...<br><br>to love = BD<br><br>monster i will keep going.</br></br></br></br></br>  The only show I've ever dropped on episode 1 was Hyouka. maybe ill try it again.  I dropped Chaos Dragon because the frames hurt my eyes. It also seemed way too shounen for my tastes.  <br>A male MC who's basically powerless and is constantly physically abused by women isn't fun for everyone, masochistfag.</br>  I dropped Gangsta cuz its so fucking gay.  <br>You just have shit tastes son.</br>   male mc with a bunch of girls <br>Why even give it a chance</br>  <br>But there are a lot of betafags and Taigafags around here.</br>  <br>I read manga and I dropped anime before finishing first episode.</br>  <br> le gangsta gay summer meme </br>  <br>Yes and this is softcore porn for them. What's your point?</br>    <br>You forgot to say he punches two humans who were talking shit of the girl in this very chapter.</br>  <br> benis </br>  <br>The designs in Gangsta wouldn't look out of place in a bara series.</br>  <br>Gangsta is really gay</br>  <br> b-but muh haremshit circlejerks <br>This is probably the worst reason ever to watch a shitty show.</br></br>  <br> female writer <br> yaoi hands </br></br>  <br>Those designs are better than the gangsta ones.</br>  <br>I remembered liking the manga (haven't read it in a while), but I forgot just how contrived and shitty the writing is.<br><br>I know it's just a dumb comedy series, but it's still pretty bad.</br></br></br>  What good shit there's this season? I'm feeling like picking up something.  <br>The monsters shit you mention OP<br>Gangsta<br>Chaos Dragon<br>Bikini Warriors</br></br></br></br>   masturbating the snake monster <br><br>dropped, subtle if you don't know where the snake cloacas are though</br></br>  <br>forgot, also the royal family with powers thingie</br>  <br>Same. Not to mention that ridiculous edgy shit end. <br><br>This coming from a guy that never drops a show. Literally 2 out of the 600+ I've seen.</br></br></br>  Chaos Dragon<br>Joukamachi no Dandelion<br>Charlotte<br>Wakaba*Girl<br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu<br>Ushio to Tora<br>Okusama ga Seitokaichou!<br>Shimoneta</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   dropping shows <br>Not like I have anything better to do, besides I'm pretty good at picking out shows I know I'll like. <br><br>If I did drop anything it would probably be Gate though.</br></br></br>  <br>Some anime try<br>some anime fail<br>others Isuca</br></br></br>  <br>time to get a job.</br>  <br>Most of them. I drop 3 shows for every one I continue watching and I'm being generous.</br>  <br>Dropped that too, though for different reasons.<br><br> breast upgrade for Papi <br> retarded small wings <br> not avian looking legs <br> small talons <br>In short, giving DFC/Papi fans the middle finger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dropped, only to be picked up again once BDs are out.</br>  <br><br> dropping something because it's vaguely homoerotic <br><br>top pleb</br></br></br></br>  <br>sup LRD</br>  <br> dropping monster musume <br>are you gay or something?</br></br>   a-am i fitting in yet? : the thread   <br> Bawwwww some people don't like my harem shit of the year </br>   I can judge a whole show from 20 minutes!   <br><br> muh 3 episode rule </br></br>  <br> anime is such a complex medium that you have to spend at least 60 minutes watching it before making a judgement </br>  <br>Your still not fitting in, anon, try harder</br>  You guys are just as contrarian as ever.  <br><br>To be fair, it's not uncommon for good shows to have really weak starts, so the three episode rule is a good way of cementing an opinion.<br><br> In this case however, you really just need to read the manga to know if you'll like the show </br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you marathoned it?</br>  <br> So what shows have you dropped based on their first episodes <br>None, because:<br><br>a) I am not a huge fucking faggot<br>b) I don't claim to drop shows based on their first episode on anonymous image boards only to pose as an attention whore<br>c) the show is exactly what i expected<br>d) go fuck yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And this show caters to my fetish, too. What a bland and stupid premise, even by anime standards.</br></br>  <br> being this mad </br>  Nothing from this season but I havent properly decided what to check out yet.<br><br>Last series I instantly dropped was Love Lab. Also only saw one episode of Plastic Memories but I may still give it a watch.</br></br>  Berserk ch. 338 will be published in Young Animal #15 (24/07).  <br> 87x125 <br>So you're just saying that your dick is tiny.</br></br>  It's so great to know that you don't have to reread the entire manga to know what's going on unlike D.Gray-man.<br>Well I mean that is if the next chapter is coming out soon and it doesn't turn out that it won't come till I have dementia.</br>  There's already another berserk thread OP<br><br><br><br><br><br>But this post made my visit worth it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking kidding me? That rate is tremendous progress compared to the last year.</br>  AaaaAAaaRrrRRRRrGgggGGgHgHHHHmmbl<br><br>Where can all my eyes read it?</br></br>  Based Spyro<br><br>https://kyakka.wordpress.com/2015/0<wbr>7/07/4435/#more-4435</wbr></br></br>   mfw Spyro gets hunted down by the FBI before he can see Yukinoshita lose   Even if his site gets shut down, there's always Madokami.    <br> Spyro <br>*Excorsism<br>Fixed</br></br></br>  <br>And IRC and torrents and even just /a/.</br>  Huh, I am not hearing good things about vol. 11.<br><br>Did something major happen?</br></br>  <br>Nothing happened.</br>  <br>This guy, holy shit. And he recommend great mango too.</br>  <br>The problem is nothing major happened and yet drama intensifies<br><br>It was absolutely stupid for everyone not Irohafags</br></br></br>  LN fags, can someone tell me what happen after anime?  <br>May god bless his soul.</br>  <br>Yeah. 8man goes into existential crisis mode questioning everything he has done.<br><br>He comes up with the idea that he must give into every one of his desires in order to be genuine and needless to say that causes some trouble.</br></br></br>  BASED SPYRO  Yeah, this could easily backfire. If there are signs of Yukinoshita losing or if WW gives in to the shekels and starts padding the story to make extra novels Spyro will easily back out. He's under the impression it's ending in 1-2 novels.  <br><br>.... go on?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127722162 <br>If that seriously happens I'll punch WW.</br>   Volume 12 <br> Yukino starts standing on her own <br> Leaves everything behind and rejoins her family <br> Everyone loses touch with her for months <br> After the graduation ceremony, 8man looks around in the old club room for old time's sake <br> Inside is Yukino <br><br>The end</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Praise SPYRO-SAMA for he is almighty and awesome.<br><br>Yukino is pleased.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was obvious. He's a teenage boy regularly in close proximity with attractive women. The only thing holding him back was fear, and he decided he would fear nothing. Just think what would happen if he didn't fear the consequences of his actions.</br>  <br><br><br>So this answer  is correct? Why does  want to make it sound like it was wrong?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is a token of my gratitude, no please, it's just a thank you.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> if he didn't fear the consequences of his actions. <br>Sensei created beast then.</br></br>  <br>Indeed she did.</br>  <br>Fuck you, you made me cry</br>  <br><br>Question, can't a translation, just conveniently pop up out of nowhere with no attachment to any names, and give Spyro complete deniability on responsibility for the unofficial translations?<br><br>He needn't be so readily visible, or centrally located for his translation operations for Yen Press to home in on him.<br><br>We can just use pastebins and make redundant copies of the translations to ensure YP doesn't erase everything he's worked for, or in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How soon until Yen Press goes bankrupt.<br><br>They don't have unlimited translators and pile up their LN backlog and do shitty rush jobs yet continue buying up licenses and somehow expect /a/ to still be alive in 2020 much less interested in material that already ended.</br></br></br>  <br>That depends if he wants to. I'm sure if he asked someone would set him up with a VPN or a proxy server in Chile or something.</br>  <br>SAO and LH are selling like hotcakes, and they're very pleased with those sales according to what they said at the AX panel so not anytime soon.</br>  <br>I wonder how good YP reputation in Japan. What was their first ever license? How did it sell?</br>  <br> I wonder how good YP reputation in Japan <br>Why would Japan care about YP?</br></br>  <br>You need a good portofolio to convince them. Getting license ain't easy on the first place. So i just wondering.</br>  <br>They can just hog those titles and cockblock other Western publisher. They're slowly turning LN market into monopoly. Not that there's decent competitors for them, anyway.</br>  <br>Haruhi and S&amp;W sales probably</br>  <br>So what you're saying is that we should all invest in Yen Press for serious payouts?</br>  <br><br>I somehow am not convinced that this is true.</br></br>  <br>As long as they get money, they don't care about what happens to the series outside Japan. And it doesn't help that there aren't any competitors to YP at all</br>  <br>Anything could happen but the anmie covered everything.<br><br>We're all in the dark until Watari releases Volume 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they won't move a single bit. Just like Funi and their shitty encoding, you'll be stuck forever with official translation never.</br>  For what it's worth, I've never seen YP drop a series before. They've already caught up to the latest Haruhi novel, well it was a while ago actually. They're almost done with S&amp;W with the final volume coming out Spring 2016. I think we're fine especially since Oregairu probably won't be that long anyways. For series like Index though I would be a bit worried.  <br>The problem is that we'd be waiting years for something we expected in the next couple of months at most</br>  <br>Reported to Yen Press,<br>I hope they sue him.</br></br>  <br>BASED SPYRO</br>  <br>sent letter to Yen Press</br>  <br>So. When will vol 1 Yahari YP gonna be published?</br>  <br>Not exactly hard to catch up with Haruhi with its long hiatuses</br>  Anyone has the episode 8 full of "I don't understand" stitches?  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Tokyo Pop hogged LN licenses too that never materialized.<br><br>Also, that obscure company that actually licensed Hidan no Aria never released Volume 1 and never mentioned it again but still holds the license.<br><br>Seriously, Americans are scum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LH <br>Whats that? Log Horizon?</br></br>  <br> And he recommend great mango too. <br><br>Can't find it. Castle of Dandelion or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, that obscure company that actually licensed Hidan no Aria never released Volume 1 and never mentioned it again but still holds the license. <br>Probably YN give pressure to them. You don't want anymore competitor in the market.</br></br>  <br>Which is retarded since the American market system is completely based around the idea of competition. <br><br>I was hoping that another Light Novel company would finally be able to beat into Yen Press' skull that including something as simple as honorifics wouldn't make the books any less "accessible" to the average reader. <br><br>But at this point Senpai is probably going to be reduced to some shitty localization that takes away all the significance that came with it. The Persona 4 localization didn't treat us like idiots, wish Yen Press would do us the same courtesy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not retarded. If the company owns the rights then no other company can profit on it.<br><br>Companies aren't there to suck your dick, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what I am mad about?<br>Zaregoto v3 to v9 never.</br></br>  <br><br> the American market system is completely based around the idea of competition.  <br><br>You'd be surprised.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723830 <br>because LNs are shit</br>  <br>yeah</br>  Can somebody translate this one page?<br><br>That's all i need to summed up whole volume 11.</br></br>  <br>Not really since I'm actually a marketing major (sorry for the minor blog), so I'm pretty used to the shitiness of certain business practices by now. Thing is that monopolies are allowed to exist in certain circumstances, but the idea of competition is still upheld by the vast majority of the market. Having one company handle the product is just asking for trouble. <br><br>Yen Press is pretty much the only place to go for Light Novels in English at the moment. And while their quality isn't bad for the most part, if they massively screw up a series by hiring a bad translator (like No Game, No Life for example), then you're pretty much screwed as a reader since there won't be any other alternatives except reading moon. Which has too high of an opportunity cost for many people.<br><br><br> It's not retarded. If the company owns the rights then no other company can profit on it <br><br>What the fuck are you even talking about? Nice job stating the obvious twat, of course a company that doesn't hold the IP won't get any profit from it. The point is that multiple companies in the same market fosters better products for the consumer overall. If X company does a shitty job at translating a certain Light Novel, and Y company gets a better reception by doing something differently (like say including honorifics). then X company is likely to pick up that practice in order to improve their sales. <br><br>And yes, companies are there to suck the customers dick. That's the whole bloody point or else they would make any money you retard. <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723830 <br>The only reason he started in the first place was because Yahari was the only series that sparked his interest enough to start translating. He legit started doing it on a whim for the most part, and continued at his own expense. <br><br>I'm pretty sure once Yahari is over he won't bother translating any other series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they wouldn't make any money <br>Goddammit, there was nothing wrong with that auto-correct.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad. Yen Press won't get to Volume 12 until 2019 or so.</br>  Based Spyro.<br>Saving Yaharis since 2013.</br>  <br> too high of an opportunity cost for many people. <br><br>Why is learning a language an opportunity cost?<br><br>Surely time spent doing that is more productive than playing vidya or watching anime.<br><br>I'm also interested to hear the opinion of a marketing specialist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because everyone already busy finding a cure for cancer or something. Why would they burden themselves in doing something else more costly in their spare time when they can just relax and have an animay?</br>  <br> Why is learning a language an opportunity cost? <br>I'm generalizing a tad, since opportunity cost in general really depends on the person's own idea of what's worth their time or not. But in general learning antoher language could be considered an opportunity cost simply because of the large amount of time you have to spend on it.<br><br>In this case context is extremely important, if you were to say be learning another language so that you can be more efficient in your job that means interacting with people on an international level. Then it could very well be considered an investment of sorts, and thus the opportunity cost isn't all that much since you are doing so in a way that will make up for that lost time in your workplace.<br><br>In this case you're largely using your free-time solely to access more content to read in your free-time. While nothing is necessarily lost in that amount of time, there isn't anything really being gained. You're not learning Japanese to do anything to make up that time, you're doing it only to be able to watch/read Japanese entertainment that you would normally be unable to.<br><br>Which is perfectly fine of course, nothing wrong with that. But the usage of that free-time is still an opportunity cost (not in monetary form obviously) since you could have probably used that time to consume more media rather than investing your time to learn the language instead. Plus there's the risk that you could become frustrated and give-up in the middle of learning, which would mean you lost a lot of your free time for nothing in the end.<br><br>Very subjective for the most part, but I consider learning Japanese to be an opportunity cost for that reason alone honestly. While the sunk cost fallacy is something to bear in mind, it's hard to justify all that time spent if you end up giving up on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spyro seems like a cool guy but he clearly bites more than he could chew.<br><br>I guess it doesn't matter since most of you guys don't care about translation quality though</br></br>  <br>YP's impending releases' quality is a dice roll anyway so this evens out in the end.</br>  <br>I thought you fags were saying that his translation is biased anyway.</br>  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br>What song is that?</br></br>  <br><br><br>So do you learn Japanese yourself?<br><br>On a side note,  since you are marketing major, you got touch on economic a bit right? What is the best source/book on understanding modern economy and investment? </br></br></br></br></br>  Can anyone explain episode 8?  <br>It was Yukino haters<br><br>Seriously though Spyro is quite autistic even when translating, which result in great quality. Since he's one man team, some imperfection is inevitable.</br></br></br>  <br>  8man want to understand <br>  8man hates talking <br>  Yui said it's impossible to understand without talking <br>  8man know he's delusional <br>  he still wanted the genuine* <br><br>* do note that even 8man can't really define it, but most points learn toward complete honesty, for good or for ill, instead of preserving shallow and superficial bonds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What was Yukinon being unfair about?</br></br>  <br>The election<br><br>Yukino still butthurt about it, and Yui told her it's her fault for not telling them about what she wanted properly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How did Yui know, Yukinon told her? But judging from the reaction, Yukino is just butthurt that they didn't understand her wish. Student council president is something she would like to have, but not necessary needed, am I correct?</br></br>  <br>not just the election. The club atmosphere soured after the Kyoto trip and both Yui and Hikki kept it in a stagnant state by trying to smooth things over by pretending nothing was wrong. Yukino kept quiet about it since she thought they didn't want to address the issue.</br>  <br> Student council president is something she would like to have, but not necessary needed, am I correct? <br>Exactly<br><br>Yukinon was butthurt that Hachiman removed the necessity factor, and Yukinon is too autistic to realize that yes, she actually wanted the position for real.<br><br>What Yukino did was a bitch move, but not entirely hard to understand. Plus, Hachiman is an asshole for not following Komachi's suggestion to talk with Yui and Yukino properly.<br><br>Of course, Yui pretending that nothing happened didn't help at all. No one is innocent in that conflict.<br><br><br>That too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, I don't really have any need to since I'm specializing in digital marketing, so English is all I need to know for the most part (but getting used to Indian accents are definitely a thing). The only languages I'm fluent in are English and my native language.<br><br>As for the books, well it depends on whether you want to learn about micro or macro more. Then there's the fact that the majority of books on economics are really dry textbooks.<br><br>If you want just a basic overview then I highly recommend Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science. The book talks about the market, and the pros and cons of government interventions, and how not to fuck up an investment. Pretty good read, and definitely easier on your brain than the textbooks.<br><br><br>It's not really biased in the traditional sense. It's just there is a real possibility of him misinterpreting the importance of certain scenes simply because he wasn't paying as much attention to them as he would to a Yukino scene. Like the Yui scene where it was pretty much an indirect confession of sorts.<br><br>It's not malicious bias, but it is still considered bias nonetheless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHEN THE FUCK DO THEY ANNOUNCE THE MOVIE?  <br> American market system is completely based around the idea of competition. <br>Not really there is actually a really large monopoly in the NA especially when it comes to Internet Service Providers and Mobile Operators.</br></br>  Like, the license is appreciated, but the timing of it sucked. Fans are most hyped about it now, with S2 having just passed. Apparently to Yen Press, cashing in is more important than being considerate to the people (or person, in this case) who contributed to creating the demand for it.  <br> Internet Service Providers and Mobile Operators. <br>Ah yes, the dreaded ISP war.</br></br>  If Hikki didn't stomp down Yui's suggestion at the end of vol 11 what did Yui expect would happen? Forcing a non-genuine relationship between everyone was not really going to do anything but prevent severe emotional pain of rejection. Did she think that her and Yukino were just going to fall out of love with him?  <br>Once again, monopolies are actually allowed in certain circumstances. In the case of American internet and telephone providers there's this thing called a Natural Monopoly. I'm not going into the specifics, but this kind of monopoly is allowed on a local level due to the fact that if done otherwise it could end up being a clusterfuck infrastructure wise. <br><br>In the case of Internet Service Providers and them being a bunch of twats. Well technically speaking that shit shouldn't be allowed, but because of a loophole in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which ironically was supposed to prevent monopolies, let them do that shit. <br><br>That recent thing with the FCC helped a bit, but there's still a long way to go before that particular situation gets more reasonable. The internet and how it should be distrusted is still a huge gray area in economics since it is largely uncharted territory. And unfortunately I don't know that much on how it is handled, since I'm a marketing guy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do I find the pdf collection?</br>  <br>She knew Hikky would stop her, she just forced the outcome to come faster</br>  <br><br>Thanks for the recommendation. Also sometimes I wonder do the Indians really speaks English? (Glad that you are used to it.) On the other hand, I can understand (mostly) what Russians try to convey even with their bizarre vocab and grammar.<br><br>Did Spyro go back and correct the part he was biased about?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Over here in the EU such monopolies don't exist, wherever you are in the country you are free to choose from any ISP or Mobile Network that exists. And thus there is actual true competition between such companies over here.</br>  <br>mega:#F!GRkyET7Z!YLFw2JE0pC6OTd3CAw<wbr>VwkQ<br><br>Does anyone have 10.5 PDF? I can't find any with google-san</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>What about his IRC?<br>Can't find it in his about page.</br></br>  <br> Did Spyro go back and correct the part he was biased about? <br>The fuck is this bias meme? It's not even a mistake, commie just find a slightly better translation.</br></br>  <br>If it changed the meaning of things this much, then it might as well be called bias</br>  <br>That's an impressive collection. Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>I decide to import all that shit to my account.</br>  <br><br>Oh, and thank you pdf anon.</br></br>  <br>She knew that 8man will stop her.<br>She knew.</br></br>  <br>No problem anon, and last I checked he fixed it after the episode involving that particular scene aired. Apparently he wasn't aware of the ambiguous wording (once again, likely because he doesn't pay much attention to Yui scenes as much as he does Yukino's), and Commies translation motivated him to fix it.<br><br><br>EU is overall better than the American economic policies in my honest opinion. Though I only say that since I'm a very "consumer first" type of guy. In America people tend to treat businesses more like people than they treat actual people, which is really fucking strange. <br><br>Though the EU has it's own share of issues, but that's mostly a government problem rather than an economic problem for the most part. <br><br><br>I'm not talking about bias in the way the Yukino haters use it as a buzzword. I'm talking more in the unintentional, but nonetheless existing bias that may colour the way he translates certain scenes. <br><br>Once again, using the Yui scene as an example. While Commie found a better translation, that was because of the visual aid of the anime. When Spyro was first translating the scene it's very likely he overlooked it because he simply didn't pay as much attention to it as he would a Yukino scene.<br><br>It isn't intentional bias on his part, but just something inherent to a shipper. He has his eagle eyes on searching for more meaning in a scene if it's one that holds more of his interest (I.E a Yukino scene).<br><br><br>Last I checked no. There was one anon a while back who said he'd make a PDF of it, but we haven't heard from him since.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Iroha &gt; YY<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br><br>Did she knew 100% deep down? It seemed like she was prepared for her proposal to work. <br><br>I am just wondering what she thought would actually happen if her proposal worked. Did she really think she would stop being in love with him?</br></br></br></br>    <br>there is some .epub file in mediafire folder though</br>  <br>I respectfully disagree.</br>  I don't care if Iroha doesn't win. I just want to see some well drawn doujins featuring her.  <br>No</br>  <br>You have to always have a plan B, I'm sure she knew he would reject the proposal. But given that he did not, she would win the 8man, and just delay the inevitable "go help yourself, faget<br>" Yukino development.</br></br>  <br>It's all a matter of personal preference</br>  <br> Did she think that her and Yukino were just going to fall out of love with him? <br>at that point she probably noticed Yukino's feelings for 8man and got scared at the possibility of NTR and Club Drama so she suggested to keep the way things are. To avoid somebody getting hurt. Desperate times calls for desperate measures i guess.</br></br>  <br>Specifically Yui requested that they maintain the status quo until someone wins the sensei-bet and let the winner be chosen that way.</br>  <br> got scared at the possibility of NTR <br>Shame, would have been awesome to see it in Yahari properly</br></br>  <br>Your taste =<br><br>My Taste =</br></br></br>  I want Hachiman to touch Yui's yahallos  <br> gives her chocolate to 8man directly, making it extremely obvious that she made it specifically for him <br> respectful enough not to give it in front of the other girls <br>I concur, I'll throw my support into this as well. Though I don't really have anything against YY.<br><br><br><br>Has there ever been a series where the girls didn't give a fuck about each others feelings? Because I feel like every series has the classic "I want them to be happy" or "let's have a fair contest!" go at it, but never have them actually spite one another for it. <br><br>Real life romantic conflicts rarely go that smoothly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Hachiman to insert his shaft into Yukino's womanhole.</br>  <br> Yui's yahallos <br> not Yui's yuis </br></br>  <br>He would have to it against her will though.<br><br><br><br>So Yui had no intention of falling out of love with him?<br><br>It was a cowardly move she pulled, it is like she trusted 8man not to agree to it. I can see why she could be considered unfair. <br><br>She looks so happy that he stopped it though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   There were people yesterday doubting Sypro     <br>But that's Hayato' job m8</br>  <br>I would love a series where the girls actually don't give a shit about the other one and just go full force for the guy.<br><br>Also, the guy needs to not be a beta pushover but hopefully not full alpha-cunt either.</br></br></br>  <br>White Album 2 says hi, literally what you are describing there.</br>  <br> She looks so happy that he stopped it though <br>IMO it was more akin to her feeling relief. 8man basically telling her that whatever happens happens</br></br>  <br>Nothing against YY either, but Iroha is better definitely</br>  <br><br> Tobe and the rest aren't just gonna pop in and go "Gotcha", are they... <br> What are you saying, you live here Hikki. <br><br>Everytime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I downloaded it but kind of just added it to my backlog thinking it'd be some sort of True Tears bullshit </br>  <br> Even after 10.000 years later Noefags still mad. </br>  <br> True Tears bullshit <br>There's going to be tears alright, depends on whether or not you enjoy the taste of them or you end up drowning in them. But there will be tears.<br><br><br>I kind of wonder how much would have changed if Iroha was introduced early on. I bet some of the more lackluster volumes would have been much more bearable if that were the case. <br><br>Then again part of Iroha's appeal is the fact that she is great even as a late character. <br><br><br> thinking Noefag asspain is the longest running <br>You should check out Pokemon shipping spots, makes all this waifuwar shit in these threads seem like a nice calm tea party in comparision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari Ore is like White Album Lite.</br>    <br/>  <br><br>So who's the true winner in that anime?

The MC true love is Touma but she became too autistic and fled to another country because muh dream. <br>And in the ending credit, Setsuna is hugging the faggot MC in the back, refusing to leave him although he doesn't love her.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly</br>  <br><br> Pokemon <br> shipping <br><br>What the fuck are they doing?</br></br></br></br></br>  Who would take the rejection worse between Yui and Yukino? <br><br>I think Yui would, she has invested so much into her romance with him she would be destroyed by a direct rejection.</br></br>  <br>is he not in brazil?</br>  <br>Based. <br>Now where the fuck is the last part of chapter 1</br></br>  <br>In the VN:<br> Setsuna won the hardest <br> Touma won the corniest </br></br></br>  <br>It's like poetry.</br>  <br>More importantly: which girl's rejection will wound 8man the hardest?

I didn't notice yaoi undertone in CCS when I was young too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Broke was always Nurse/Police woman chaser, he was never a problem in the pairing. He was a sideman.</br>  <br>Brock was barely relevant in his time with Ash, and there were arcs when he leaves to do something and Ash is alone with the girl for 20~ episodes</br>  <br><br><br>Hmm... so the show itself also encourage shipping. I never noticed it and moved on when after I grow up.

Literally nothing got resolved.</br>  <br>Did you expect the series to resolve itself 1-2 volumes before the ending IE the actual resolution?</br>  <br><br> implying animes aren't used to advertise the source material <br><br>want a resolution? buy vol12 when it comes out</br></br></br></br>  <br> buy vol12 when it comes out <br>Who knows when will that be.<br><br>Isn't Wateri supposed to chum out side volumes with every BD volume?</br></br></br></br>  Happy birthday to the best oneesan~  <br>Nigga that ain't even the best onee-san in the series.</br>  <br>Buy le LN</br>  <br>It's just a cliffhanger until the Movie.<br><br> Gekijouban: Yahari Ore no Kouhai Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru </br></br></br>  <br>It's a  recap movie </br>  <br>No, it's  live action with movie original ending </br>    <br>Bai bai Hikki</br>    <br>N-no</br>  <br><br>christ</br></br>  <br>Is that a guy</br>    <br>What is that collar...</br>  <br> Iroha: Senpai&lt;3 I want to go to a hot spring <br>Fucking hell, just take her there 8man.</br></br>    <br>Why is Watari dressed as Yui?</br>  <br><br><br>いろはす～</br></br></br>    スカーフ はす～  <br>Woah</br>  I just finished the series, Yui seems to be the best girl but Yukinon is great too.<br>Is the triangle relationship the only good option?</br>  <br>it demonstrates that he is now her property.</br>  <br> But she never put that in her mouth. <br>You have no idea.</br></br>    <br>8man loves Komachi the most</br>  <br>Well, the problem is  8man seems to like/adore one girl and getting close to her as a figure/person but he's also loving and trying to get over his trauma in order to cross the line with another girl. </br>  he has yet to:<br><br> give yui's "someday" <br> take responsibility for iroha <br> help yukino <br><br>how's that gonna fit in 1 volume?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He did help Yukino</br></br>  <br>He's going to ignore all of them and fug sensei</br>  <br>I like to imagine that Yukino is the one saying "No" in that picture.</br>  <br>I think the aquarium date was Yui's someday.<br><br>Taking responsibility for Iroha is an ongoing thing.<br><br>Yukino's was about to make a request at the end of the last volume.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i seriously don't get that part, she almost accepts yui's proposition if 8 man didnt stop it then says "don't tell me how i feel" at the end</br>  <br>He is going to take Yui on another 1 on 1 date because he has a code of honor. Not sure what other role she will play if 12 is the final Volume<br><br>Iroha...yeah I dunno how relevant she is going to be<br><br>Yukino is going to be relevant until the series concludes since everything pretty much revolves around her character</br></br></br></br></br>   OTP <br>I remind them.<br><br>Also a gift to Spyro.</br></br></br>  <br>She was going to accept so she doesn't end up getting hurt, 8man basically tells her to wake up and face reality.</br>  So now that we know what's going on with Yukino, a lot of the earlier scenes with Yukino can be seen in a different light<br><br>Basically what has happened is that Yukino has surrendered to Hachiman's way of thinking in the early episodes. We see her at the beginning and she has all the ideals about improving yourself, helping others, changing the world, etc. What she really wants though is to improve herself. Meanwhile Hachiman believes it's pointless to change yourself or the world. His solutions always sidestep personal improvement and rely on manipulation or understanding social situations to get out of problems. <br><br>Yukino watches this and sees how Hachiman's way of thinking produces better results again and again. It gradually wears down her resolve. What is ironic is that as she's becoming closer to Hachiman's original way of thinking, he is getting closer to her original way of thinking. He no longer rejects change or self improvement.<br><br>Anyway I think in the next volume Yukino's family is going to intervene to try and separate Yukino from the service club and Hachiman in particular. Yukimom would have several reasons for wanting that. Aside from whatever hopes she might have for Hayama/Yukino, she is never going to accept Yukino having feelings for some middle school loser with rotten eyes and little prospects. Plus she can point to how Hachiman seems to have 'ruined' Yukino even further. Whatever feeble improvement she had shown has been wiped out and she's as bad as she's ever been now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I know, but if their main goal is to find genuine why was she even lying there at the end. It's basically in similar character to "I was just pretending to be retarded posts"</br>  <br>http://i.imgur.com/9uUftqR.gif</br>  <br>No I will remind everyone</br>  <br>As expected of a TL who has the best girl as his waifu. There is a God and his name is Spyro.</br>  <br><br>Her "don't tell me how I feel" to Yui is her trying to save face I think. She was about to accept Yui's proposal, Hachiman intervened and shamed her basically, now she's backtracking.</br></br>  <br><br> give Yui "someday" <br>This will be the chapter where the 8bowl is decided.<br><br> take responsibility for iroha <br>Ongoing, as per  but not really a factor going forward.<br><br> help yukino <br>Already "helped" her at the aquarium, plus it's the central plot of 12</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just how Yukino is, she's dishonest about herself so she puts up a front of overconfidence.</br>  Can someone explain to me why Yukino was fine with Hachiman's social suicides in season 1 but she just changes her viewpoint on it in season 2? She was even fine with how he fucked Sagami verbally. Did she just fell for him right then and she cared a lot more? Or was it something else?    <br> he fucked Sagami <br>Yukino NTR fetish confirmed, 8man is secretly fucking Haruno</br></br>  <br>It wasn't shown well in the anime I think, but basically the Sagami case WAS the turning point; that brought a lot of grief crashing down on 8man's head, unlike their prior cases.</br>  <br><br>I think it gradually happened. Once it became something that he was going to make a routine of her hostility to it increased in proportion to how much she cared about him.<br><br>There are other factors than just the 'self suicide' though. With the fake confession, it made her reexamine what she thought was their shared hostility to insincere relationships.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>YY weren't there in person for the sagami scene, the fake confession was the first time they got a up close look at how 8man did things. <br>It also doesn't help that they already liked him when he pull the confession stunt.</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't there, but word got out about it and practically everyone in the school had a massive hate-on for 8man for a while.</br>  <br><br> OTP <br>Wrong files, the both of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do I see a Ryuuji in 8man? Not talking about the appearance, of course.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>I always wondered, why did Yukino lean in like that?</br>  <br>I don't think the 1 on 1 date will actually happen.<br><br>8man will pester Yui because the convenience of the 3p date left him unsatisfied after he resolved to seriously try to address/humor Yui's feelings.<br><br>That's when Yui will confront him with the fact that the reason he won't let go of that date because of a sense of obligation rather than returning her feelings. This is how 8man will realize he's not being honest by tolerating/humoring Yui's feelings, instead of making it perfectly clear that he won't return them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10<br><br>Shitty, contrived, and "obligation" and "humoring" Yui very obviously has nothing to do with why he wants to go on the date.</br></br></br>  <br>The reason he feels want to go on another date is because Yukino tagged along for the aquarium one and the promise date was just between the two of them<br><br>Whatever happens beyond that no one knows</br></br></br>  <br>He literally went with the mood when he asked her out, there are no special reasons behind it.<br>But Yui tried to waste his promise on a 3p date, so he'll just give her another chance to convey her feelings properly. Her ship is most likely going to sink soon.</br></br>  <br> Suki nano <br>No answer.<br><br> pulls hand out from hers <br>Makes an excuse instead of giving his real reason.<br><br> hair grooming <br>Clearly uncomfortable the entire time.<br><br>Since becoming friends 8man has been soft on Yui's romantic advances despite not accepting them. If you actually think the promise date is our of anything other than obligation you have not been paying any attention to their interactions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Her ship is most likely going to sink soon. <br>I heard that one before. Remember when /a/ was convinced that vol 11 would sink her? Now she is in better shape than before.</br></br>  <br> He literally went with the mood when he asked her out <br>And Iroha went with the mood when she asked Hayama out.<br><br>In Yahari between "mood" being genuine and non-genuine, there is more precedent to it being non-genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>to get a closer look of the bandages she was tying</br>  <br>Not that anon, but Iroha didn't ask Hayama out solely because of the mood.

Unless a girl gets a boost in romantic writing, all will sink.</br></br></br>  <br>She's basically equal to Yukino now which isnt saying much since Yuki is at her lowest point in the series and 12 is probably her "redemption" novel that also starts to tie up loose ends</br>  <br>He went with the mood because he had been thinking about stepping over the line with Yui for some time.<br> summed up his current situation with YY perfectly already.<br><br><br>Not even worth addressing since you completely misread the mood when she took his hand during the genuine scene.

Please add spoiler tag to anything that would potentially be a spoiler, and on the other hand, readers who haven't read the manga until the latest few chapters please do not uncover those spoiler if you do not read tp spoil yourself.</br></br>  <br> ...forget to put this in spoiler when I first post this, but anyway this is the latest chapter summary. </br>   Man I'm shocked there was an actual graduation so early on.Best School Life animu.Can't wait for University.Or was it High School?   Looking forward to these Generals.  As from the previous chapter, that glassed people shoot and while it do not hit ri-san, shovel's shovel cut ri-san's leg. And then the glassed ppl yell to them WTH are you guys doing, shovel yell back and said then you guus understand we are not "those things" and so please let us pass, however that glassed people grit his teeth and response with rearmming his weapon. Then as shovel step close to that person, he shout "don't come! even if you are not those thing, the possibility of turning into those things still exist!" and afterward they decide to retreat. Then yuki and ri-san stay in their car, kutumi and miki went to try contact them again, but then another two people with head fully covered chase them from their back and apparently want to beat them. After they all get onto their car and so as those people chasing from the back, they heard something from the car audio which told them go to the backdoor if they encounter any danger. Thus they get in and the car at the back turn away. Then the 3 new girls welcom them and say they are different from those violent gangs  Does anyone have the korean scans of the new chapters?  <br> new thread <br>Well, fine if we go the endless threads route for this series I can continue this stupid circular argument too.<br><br><br>https://twitter.com/erkin_kawabata/<wbr>status/589384655796731904<br>Kyoani getting magically higher budgets than anyone else just because is another one of those memes that has to die. Their new shows are mostly from their own ln brand too so they don't even have the usual potentially unlimited Kadokawa money anymore either, not saying that lantis and friends aren't enough anyway.<br><br>Besides that I don't even get why we're arguing anymore. I know that money is important but since the first post I said that in the moment that you decide that your studio can handle 3 shows at once the budget will not be your biggest problem anymore. Hell, you even admitted now that your precious money will still only bring you a somewhat passable end product when you fall behind.<br>The biggest problem is still that you took on 3 shows which is a fuckload of work even if everything goes smoothly. But nothing ever goes smoothly and you will most likely fall behind despite your calculations and have barely time to rescue episodes with extra staff you had to recruit last minute. The chaos and wrong calculations will fuck your series over, but not the money directly.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://www.mangaumaru.com/archives/<wbr>452324<br><br><br> The main reason why I start a new thread is because of the first reply, but I don't want to put that to OP </br></br></br></wbr></br>  How true is the anime going to stay to it's source? I'm worried this is going to be the show lerche fucks up.  <br>not very true, as  those twitter-evernote spoiler say the ep1 include material from vol.4, amd apparently the show were said to be able to surprise even manga reader </br>  <br>Ok let's end it on "Do you know how fucked you'd be if you fell behind and had no money?"<br><br>Lerche have known for a while they're going to be doing 3 shows and so they've been able to plan for it. You're acting as though them picking up shows is a sign of not planning. Yeah, Lerche just accidentally got 3 shows and has no idea what they're doing. <br><br>Higher budget makes everything easier. It's an undeniable fact. You can't plan for anything if you don't have money. With more money you can get more staff and have more time as a result of more people doing work to sort out problems. <br><br>Can you explain to me why you can't understand that having say, 10 people is better than 5? For the sake of argument each person does the same amount of work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just to quickly elaborate<br>If I've been given a deadline of a month, 120 shots. Each staff memember is assigned a shot to work on each day. <br>Will 10 people finish faster than 5? Would that not mean they have more time to fix problems? Would the extra people be as a result of having a higher budget?</br></br></br>  <br>So  new bitches having ulterior motives is at least 90% sure, right? <br>It could still just be an intentional ruse and they're actually not that bad, but this all feels way to convenient and I can't shake off the feeling that they're up to something even though they're cute girls. Besides it's a staple of zombie fiction to show how fellow humans are even bigger assholes than the corpses trying to snack on you and now that they're outside it's about time to happen.</br> <br><br><br>What if  Shovel actually turns this time? </br></br></br></br>  <br> A loli in a zombie apocalypse setting <br>I've seen enough zombie apocalypse series to know that the loli rarely survives ;_; Damn shock value trope.</br></br>  So for all that twitter shit, they fucked up the first episode?<br><br><br>Shut up, that's a taboo anon</br></br></br>  <br>Anime-only-fag detected, GTFO  and read the manga, its actually pretty nice to be fair, its worth reading </br>  <br><br>You put way more faith in Lerche than me then.<br> I don't believe that they calculated everything thoroughly and I don't think that they have the available staff nor the experience to handle a potential fuck up well. They might think that they can handle it but it's still a first so it's not set in stone that they will be fine especially if other studios have already shown to fuck up in lesser situations like that.<br><br>I can understand that just fine, don't worry.<br>I said myself that more budget will give you more or better staff but apparently that didn't get through your thick skull and saying that money is important but not the most important part of the production when it comes to work overload is the same to you as saying that it doesn't matter at all. I repeat it again, the biggest pile of money won't help you if your planing and scheduling gets beyond fucked.<br>Let's say they are in week whatever, the anime is airing, they're in the middle of the season and they got more and more behind schedule despite them thinking they could handle it with the staff they had at hand. Now they're desperately searching for freelancers with time who can take up the load. Money isn't a problem but well sougth after animators all have their hands full already with other series and regardless of how much money you throw at them you won't have them cancel prior agreements. So the only ones you can give it to are the mediocre or shit ones. And regardless of how good they are they won't be as much into the series as your own staff that got drilled on all different shit in meetings so chances for small things to be off get higher too which means more time to fix little mistakes but you don't actually have the time.<br> And now I wait for you to say that this scenario is pure fantasy again and we will go back to the start. Just do it quickly, I want to post a sarcastic reply with an reaction image and go finally to bed after that. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone please hurry up and  kill  her.  <br>Is she nopan?</br>  <br>I'm not going to give you a proper reply, just call you an idiot.

It'll be on Logos BD Vol1.</br>  <br>They realized then didn't show Apollonius/Gen/Zen/??? in the first episode</br>  <br> the OVA has absolutely nothing to do with Logos. <br>Wasn't there some crap about there being seven worlds?

Fair point though.</br>  <br> seven worlds. <br> Genesis and Evol TV series world. <br> Genesis OVA world. <br> Genesis vs Evol OVA world. <br> Logos world. <br> ? <br> ? <br> ? <br>What does it mean?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   that OP <br>What the fuck.

The OVA would have been better if they have kept Mikono and Amata bullshit out of it. I was irritated their 'spat' distracted from the plot.   TFW you watched EVOL to the shitastic end and feel like picking this up too <br> yet still haven't watched Genesis or any of the OVAs </br>  <br>Genesis was pretty great, but since you've already seen EVOL it's probably ruined for you, so no need to bother with it.<br><br>Serves you right for not watching in production order.</br></br></br>  <br>Genesis is even worse than Evol if you don't count the final episodes of the last.</br>  <br>Genesis was meh, but had great characters and a nice OST/Insert Songs.</br>  What with this show about romance, apocalypse and mechs?  <br>Crisis on Infinite Aquarions?</br>  <br>Gen made Genesis pretty alright. Always looked forward to his nonsensical training</br>    <br>Genesis was just very average throughout. Had maybe one standout episode for me (cosplay), and while it did get better as it went on, it still never rose above mediocre.<br><br>The first 2/3 of EVOL was much, much better than Genesis for me. Even if it went downhill hard, and ended on a really shitty note, I'd still call EVOL better as a whole.</br></br></br>    Never watched Aquarion but decided to check this out because I read it's a new story.

The notion that anyone else in the franchise is reincarnated is all just fanwank constantly guessing X is the reincarnation of Y.</br>  Is it physically possible to watch this without having seen the previous seasons?  <br>Ahh okay. That makes sense.</br>  <br> Implying Fudo died <br>Top kek</br></br>  <br>Good, nobody messes with Zessica reincarnation<br><br>The worst</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much. The notion that people are watching this to see Zessica get a good end is hilarious because there's no indication that any of these characters are reincarnation of EVOL characters especially when all of them died in content so they wouldn't reincarnate again. You're just wasting your time.</br>  <br>I don't recommend you watch this or the previous seasons at all.</br>  <br>Are you dumb? Yunoha and Jin's reious lives died content and they still reincarnated to become Yunoha and Jin.</br>  <br>*previous</br>  <br> Can I watch X without watching the previous series/seasons? <br>That's a retarded question about any show, doubly so about Aquarion.<br><br>Anyway, we're only one episode in so it's a bit early to call it, but Logos seems like complete shit so far, and the boring kind of shit. On the otherhand, the original Aquarion is great and EVOL is the incredibly enjoyable kind of shit.

Shin and Yunoha's past life are from 1996.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>*1966</br>  <br>Considering all the kanji stuff, I doubt any fansubber will touch it.</br>  Is there anything in this show that isn't CG it all looks so disgusting. Fucking CG mechs are the worst thing ever.  I'm definitely not keeping my hopes up since Zessica can never have nice things, but I will have a laugh if Maia turns out to be related to her somehow. Even more if she's confirmed to be her reincarnation.<br><br>But yeah, so far she has everything to be reincarnated: unrequited love, treated like shit by all the cast, and on top of that being possessed by a shadow angel. She's got everything to come back and try again.</br></br>  <br> ANN </br>  <br> ANN <br><br>No thanks! Besides I already watched the OVA and they never stated they were their past lives and given how Aquarion works backwards in regards to this stuff they would be breaking their own rules yet again.</br></br></br>  <br>different robots mean different universe</br>  <br><br>These anons confirmed to be idots who like to samefag.</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Pollon previously rejected by Celiane in the ova or something?

She supposedly had accepted Yin's death but because they got popular they kept shoehorning them in the rest of the show, even though they weren't relevant anymore.

AmataxMikono are once more solidified as a OTP in episode 0 of this.</br></br>  <br>  this is what delusional shippers believe </br>  <br>But I'm not shipping AmataxZessica or MikonoxKagura.</br>  <br> But I'm not shipping AmataxZessica or MikonoxKagura. <br>Forgot to mention KaguraxZessica there, retarded shipper.</br></br>  <br>It's a valid pairing, butthurt-kun. Are you mad about what they ship tease for real and present as healthy rather than obsessive and destructive "love" like Zessica's one sided feelings and Kagura's brainwashed affection?<br><br>Plus it rustles the tumblr landwhales and fat otaku waifushits. It's a great couple.</br></br></br>  <br>God, I wish Big Bang got more OVA screentime</br>  <br>Andy and MIX needed more screentime.</br>  <br> It's a valid pairing, butthurt-kun <br>As valid as pairing Sazanka with Andy. Last minute damage control bullshit deserves to be treated as such.<br><br> and present as healthy <br>  two fags that tried to kill each other before  <br>  pushed against each other at the last minute because plot demands it <br>  healthy <br>Thanks for the laugh. Shippers are truly cancer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   MC and FeMC are both autist <br>Oh boy.</br>  <br>MC isn't autistic, he's the savior. Get it right you pleb.</br>  <br>So, is he like the reincarnation of Onii-sama?</br>  I already expected this to be shit with those character designs and no Akino  and the fact that its Aquarion , but fuck if this doesn't look to surpass even my incredibly low expectations. And I doubt the threads will even be half as enjoyable as EVOL's were. What a blunder, I just want to go listen to Gekkou Symphonia now.  <br> all this butthurt <br><br>Your tears are delicious.</br></br></br>  <br>  le butthurt meme because I can't argue back <br>thanks, faggot</br></br>    I like it.    <br><br>I don't need to "argue." The reason behind everyone's affection was stupid. But at least this one isn't as bad written as Zessica's "love" for Amata which made her the pathetic buttmonkey of the show.</br></br>  <br>Well, to be honest, Zessica and Kagura have specifically that one card from the card game, one cover of the manga and novels and there's confirmed nothing happens between them there so... that image doesn't say much.<br><br>Zessica and Kagura still lust after Amata and Mikono in the rest of the merchandise, though.</br></br></br>  <br> But at least this one isn't as bad written <br>A last minute cop out is as badly written as the rest of the romance of the show. You just don't have any problem with it because it allows you to ship a retarded couple. But for anyone that isn't a retarded shipper and actually cares about good writing and good characterization (none of which this show had anyways), is just as bad if not worse than the rest of the shit the show came up with.</br></br>  <br>Zessica was a pathetic buttmonkey because Okada is the queen of melodrama. Honestly you're talking like the whole fiasco was the character's fault when you should know the writers were just incompetent and clearly had no idea of what they were doing, and it shows characters suffered for this.</br>  <br>You do realize is not Zessica's fault her heartbreak was dragged out until she looked pathetic, right? Okada admitted she overdid it. Characters are not at fault for what the writers decide to do with them.</br>  Logos is so shit.<br>I had to listen to EVOL OP2 just to cleanse the bad taste out of my mouth.<br>https://vimeo.com/80681958</br></br>  Seems like everyone went into this with expectations too high. I recall thinking EVOL had a pretty shit and contrived first episode too. It was frustratingly cringe-y and it kinda got worse from there. At least so far this show seems to be mildly self-aware of how ridiculous it is.<br> The male lead goes on about how he's the savior and other react with reasonable disregard. <br> The base is in the middle of the city in a stupid cafe and uses a park as a launch point. <br> Kanji is some sort of mystical power and infecting word characters has a powerful albeit absurd affect on the world. <br><br>At least in this regard it's laughable enough to be enjoyable despite what's likely going to be a mess of a plot.<br><br>On the other hand, the animation is pretty shit and the vaguely 80s/90s anime throwback design decisions don't really work that well. And the music sucks, or at least is pretty unmemorable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> s and there's confirmed nothing happens between them there <br><br>That's wrong. The manga is very different too, Zessica turned into a guy.</br></br></br>  00/the OVA was fantastic. I wasn't ecstatic about EVOL after the mishap that was the entire second half but the music and silliness made it work well.<br><br>Logos seems really lackluster. The characters aren't compelling, the concept of kanji seems limited (especially with how it was displayed in this episode with the enemy design) and the music isn't appealing. Maybe May'n is the only thing making the OP feel unique but it also wasn't particularly good. It and the ED were mediocre.<br><br><br>Somehow even after EVOL, I had high expectations. It has the Aquarion name but not the staff or features that made the series enjoyable. It's only the first episode so who knows where it will go from there but the episode wasn't very gripping. Especially not after the Genesis x EVOL stuff.<br><br>At least the Aquarion design is neat. A bit jarring when put into perspective with the others but nonetheless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, the manga and LN have nothing to happen between Kagura and Zessica. They don't even talk in the volume that features them in the cover.</br>  <br><br><br>She looked pathetic because she came out as a shallow cunt who fell for a guy for no reason and had her entire life orbiting around him even to destroy her self worth.<br><br><br> last minute cop out <br> implying they got together there <br><br>No, the ending just sets the roots for a positive, teasing and equal relationship that can happen in the future. <br><br><br><br> Zessica and Kagura still lust after Amata and Mikono in the rest of the merchandise, though. <br><br>That's not true? Only the outdated merch they do, like the one you posted. And the LN does have Kagura/Zessica content. I dropped the manga after Zessica turned ZessY, but Kagura's 'fixation' on Mikono is downplayed. Kagura's even said he was over Mikono by the guy who was actually in the project. Isn't this OVA even plain to you he doesn't give a fuck about her anymore?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I mean, the manga and LN have nothing to happen between Kagura and Zessica. <br><br>The LN ends up with more romantic hints between them. Kagura is attracted to her scent when he frees her. It expands the ending, I don't know if I'll call it love, but there's obvious attraction.<br><br>Did you read the manga? The last volume? All the covers are mean to portray the couples. You can argue it's good or bad.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seems like everyone went into this with expectations too high <br>Not even remotely. It always looked like it'd be the shits.<br> I recall thinking EVOL had a pretty shit and contrived first episode too. <br>On the contrary, I thought it did a much better job in that it took its time to show you the setting and the two main characters, letting you get to know them some so that you'd be a bit more invested when the shit hit the fan immediately after. With Logos we don't know a damn thing about our mains other than one can barely squeak out two words, and the other is Captain fucking Autismo: Savior of the Universe.<br> At least so far this show seems to be mildly self-aware of how ridiculous it is. <br>Oh god, lets not. Aquarion has always been intentionally hammy, but I'm not about to let this pile off the hook by saying its only being bad "ironically".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She looked pathetic because she came out as a shallow cunt who fell for a guy for no reason and had her entire life orbiting around him even to destroy her self worth. <br>Zessica is a fictional character. She doesn't have a say in what happens to her. She looked pathetic because the writers were incompetent at handling her character. You're talking like she decided to become pathetic on her own.<br><br> No, the ending just sets the roots for a positive, teasing and equal relationship that can happen in the future.  <br>It's a cop out. Kagura and Zessica have never interacted in the entirety of the show, neither have showed interest in each other until they made Kagura give up and Zessica to accept she got rejected for real. It's a cop out at its finest.<br><br>  Only the outdated merch they do, like the one you posted. <br>No? Recent merch has Kagura screaming his typical Kuso-onna. The booklet also has them saying lines to Amata and Mikono respectively. Zessica I don't know, I haven't seen much of her.<br><br> but Kagura's 'fixation' on Mikono is downplayed.  <br>More like Kagura gets even less screentime. Most of his scenes are cut off and he's more of a background character. But he's just as obsessed as he was in the anime. He just doesn't get enough screentime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hurr muh development <br> huurr they tried to kill each other <br> hurr they fought! <br><br>Like Kawamori gives a fuck: Miriya and Max had no development.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kagura is attracted to her scent when he frees her. <br>That was a fake spoiler by 2ch, I think.<br><br> Did you read the manga? The last volume? All the covers are mean to portray the couples. You can argue it's good or bad. <br>Yeah and in that regard is the same as the anime. Kagura and Zessica never interact until the last minute, and they're at best, friends. There's no romantic interactions between them. And the cover of the second volume, in which they have Kagura and Zessica, has no interactions between them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seems like everyone went into this with expectations too high <br>Really? Most of the posts I see are people expecting more bestiality jokes and gleefully waiting for how this one will fuck up worse than evol.</br></br>  <br> No? Recent merch has Kagura screaming his typical Kuso-onna. <br><br>Because he's pre-finale Kagura. Like your pic related. Kagura no longer gives a fuck about Mikono. This is official and canon. You have an entire OVA of him around Mikono and not acknowledging her presence. Wake up and smell the fact Kagura was brainwashed into giving a fuck about Mikono by Mykage.<br><br>Mikono/Kagura shippers are the worse. Even Kawamori stated his feelings weren't real love when he discussed Amata's and Kagura's feelings for Mikono.<br><br> Zessica is a fictional character. She doesn't have a say in what happens to her <br><br>We judge her as she's portrayed. We conclude easily her relationship with Amata was negative and poisonous. While her relationship with Kagura is postive and proactive. That's how is portrayed on screen. Take the shipping goggles aside and just consider it platonic on both cases. <br><br> Kagura and Zessica have never interacted in the entirety of the show, <br><br>So what, they can interact now and they have in this OVA. Accept it and move on.<br><br> More like Kagura gets even less screentime. <br><br>Everyone gets less screentime. But no, because he has an additional scene when he thinks back about how some other woman (Zessica) smells. But the ZessY bullshit made me drop it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mangaka likes Zessica more than Mikono, and even included Zessica going on a pseudo-date with Amata, with Amata actually giving a fuck about her. She wasn't very fond of Kagura and Zessica as a couple.</br></br>  <br> That was a fake spoiler by 2ch, I think. <br>Huh? It wasn't a fake.<br><br> eah and in that regard is the same as the anime. <br>They have more interaction. Why are you bringing the second volume? I'm asking about the fifth. And the covers are sill meant to portray the official couples according to the mangaka.<br><br>You can argue it's canon in mangaverse but not the anime, because the events played up differently as I said. But one thing is certain: the staff is trying to expand on Kagura and Zessica as couple in Evol. If was a finished story, it means we'll consider their future, but this is still an ongoing franchise with a focus on reincarnations. I'll just be cautious with your way of thinking.<br><br>Last OVA drew a direct comparison of Kagura and Zessica with Apollo and Sylvia in their dynamics which wasn't innocent on their part and this is by the staff now working on Logos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  aquarion LOVE reminded me of how shit amata and mikono were  <br> Because he's pre-finale Kagura. Like your pic related. Kagura no longer gives a fuck about Mikono. <br>Merch is still merch. Kagura is still sold as Mikono's stalker. Like it or not.<br><br> Kagura was brainwashed into giving a fuck about Mikono by Mykage. <br>And now you're making up shit like this?<br><br> We judge her as she's portrayed. <br>No, you're talking like she decided to become pathetic. I'm judging her from what the writers decided to make with her. It isn't her fault she was made to cling to Amata until she was barely a shadow of her former self. It isn't Kagura's fault either he was forced to act out of character because they needed him out of the way. It isn't Amata's fault either he was made into a retarded white knight for Mikono until he looked like an asshole.<br><br>You're talking like Zessica's pathetic development is a natural consequence of her love for Amata, when it's just the writers being incompetent. I should say, you're the one who should take the shipping googles off.<br><br> they can interact now and they have in this OVA <br>So, you admit you don't give a fuck about characterization and consistency as long as you get to ship whatever you'd like? Thanks for confirming your retarded logic. I mean, I don't give a shit if you want to delude yourself that this is any good, but don't go around saying it makes perfect sense and is somehow positive for both of them as characters.<br><br>  because he has an additional scene when he thinks back about how some other woman (Zessica) smells. <br>Which is the very basis of what drove him towards Mikono. Same shit, different woman. Wow.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> I'm asking about the fifth. <br>Yeah, and? They don't interact much, Mention one interaction, then. If anything, Zessica gets more scenes and even goes on a date with Amata. You keep saying they interact more without bringing anything in specific.</br></br>  <br>Ohhh, that game in which Kagura and Zessica barely talk outside battle? And where their only interactions are when everyone are being lovey dovey with each other and Zessica needs to be sweet with someone? The game where Zessica is almost paired up with Kira? I see. Nice example you got there.</br>  <br>  Everyone forgot about Kagura, Jin and Crea and so they joined much later <br>You aren't helping yourself here.</br></br>  <br> Merch is still merch. Kagura is still sold as Mikono's stalker. Like it or not. <br><br>Of course he is anon. <br><br> And now you're making up shit like this? <br><br>Because it's true, if you actually paid attention to his character instead of parroting that he was out of character last episode. He was only obsessed with shit woman because Mykage emotionally manipulated and brainwashed him into thinking only she could give a fuck about him in a planet full of men. He couldn't give a damn after realizing he was wrong.<br><br>Are you one of the tumblr landwhales who is convinced he really loved her and are buttmad because he no longer cares?<br><br> No, you're talking like she decided to become pathetic. <br>She did. Grant her character agency. Her "love" for Amata was meant to be unhealthy and destroy her.<br><br> It isn't Amata's fault either he was made into a retarded white knight for Mikono until he looked like an asshole. <br><br><br>He never endangered people like Zessica did with MIX when she went full retard out of her self pity.<br><br> So, you admit you don't give a fuck about characterization and consistency  <br><br>They do. Time has passed, Zessica and Kagura moved on. Unlike you, they aren't hung over shit characters like Amata or Mikono anymore. <br><br> Which is the very basis of what drove him towards Mikono. Same shit, different woman. Wow. <br><br>It just means he's possibly attracted, while in case of Mikono, her smell was special because Mykage brainwashed him to track her like a dog.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would never imply something is bad "ironically" and if it even were, I would never imply that's a reason to let it off the hook. I'm saying that this show is not necessarily a lost cause just because it's so far silly. Those awful things might be what makes it worthwhile. There's a reason so many of us watched VVV despite it's many shortcomings. These sorts of absurd, over-the-top, 1-D characters put into certain situations can be entertaining enough. Of course, there's no guarantee that will happen.<br><br>And while the first episode of EVOL tried to invest you in the characters a little, it was still a really sudden attraction while not knowing a whole lot about anyone. Stutter girl gets as much characterization because we see her walking old people to the bus stop and she makes her own straps.<br><br><br>I mean to say people are expecting as much of a ride from the start-gate as EVOL. When you start watching EVOL you don't have the same feelings about it as you do at the end, especially after watching Genesis. EVOL has collectively lowered the expectations that Aquarion is good, but it heightened the sense that the series is poorly written and leads to zaniness, even more so than the weirdness of the first series. People expected this to be a shit first episode, but they also expected to get that same pleasure from the first episode here as they did from the entire season of EVOL.<br><br>Though looking back through the thread, there are really only a few people legitimately complaining. I guess the above applies to those guys. The rest seem to be eagerly anticipating the possibilities or are just bitching about kaguraxzessica.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because it's true, <br>Nowhere is said Mykage brainwashed Kagura into liking Mikono. Kagura being attracted to Mikono because of her smell was something he did on his own. You're making shit out of what you think happened without providing any quote or screenshot on it.<br><br> He was only obsessed with shit woman because Mykage emotionally manipulated and brainwashed him into thinking only she could give a fuck about him in a planet full of men. <br>This is sure consistent with how he was wishing Mykage would wake up and stop Izumo from bullying him in the beginning, and how he called Mykage Mykage-sama. Because Mykage's relationship with Kagura is very consistent throughout the show.<br><br> Grant her character agency. <br>She has none. She's a fictional character, dude.<br><br> Her "love" for Amata was meant to be unhealthy and destroy her. <br>Stop making shit up. Okada herself admitted she overdid it. It wasn't meant to look like that. You keep ignoring this.<br><br> They do. <br>You sure don't. Who cares about consistent characterization and good writing when I can be a retarded shipper over these characters that have never interacted in the entirety of the show until the writers needed them out fo the way? This is how stupid you sound.<br><br> It just means he's possibly attracted, while in case of Mikono, her smell was special because Mykage brainwashed him to track her like a dog. <br>He never did, and there's nowhere in the show they said this. You're making shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Of course he is anon. <br>I like how you ignore the new stamps of Kagura screaming kuso-onna. Those that came out at anime expo.</br></br>  <br> Grant her character agency <br>That assumes you think the writer was actually writing a character, and not just stringing events along until things happen.<br> Unlike you, they aren't hung over shit characters like Amata or Mikono anymore. <br>They also aren't people. Again, this isn't about "character agency" since they aren't alive. They are written to fit whatever the writer wanted them to fit. The worse the writing the harder you have to force things to fit.<br><br>Seriously, "agency?" Do characters in poorly written fanfics also have agency? Do I suddenly have to make sense out the incomprehensible relationships in "My Immortal" because I clearly don't understand the complex relationships of Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way?<br><br> because Mykage emotionally manipulated and brainwashed him <br>Did you also forget the part where he's Amato's other half and that both were destined to be at silvie's side once again? That he was naturally attracted to her in much the same way Amato was?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nowhere is said Mykage brainwashed Kagura into liking Mikono. <br><br>Did you skip the last episodes? It shows clearly Mykage thorning and caging a young Kagura into his track dog to lure him to Sylvia incarnation, purposefully planting in his head how nobody will love him but her. That's why Kawamori stated Kagura never loved her. I suggest you to rewatch and to look at the interviews Kawamori gave about the difference of Amata's and Kagura's feelings.<br><br>Kagura was never into Mikono, he was only chasing after the idea of being loved and he realized, after meeting Zessica, that he could be loved by other women because this woman liked his other self, Amata. That's also in the commentaries of the episode by the staff. Zessica broke the spell Mykage had placed on Kagura which weighted his soul and Kagura broke the spell on Zessica. So Mykage threw them out because he couldn't longer control them.<br><br>I thought the episode had been very direct with this, but I guess I was wrong. This doesn't mean the writing wasn't a disaster sometimes.<br><br> his is sure consistent with how he was wishing Mykage would wake up and stop Izumo from bullying him in the beginning, and how he called Mykage Mykage-sama. <br><br>Are you that unfamiliar with Stockholm Syndrome? He was brought up as a child by Mykage and he had no idea Izumo was his father.<br><br> Stop making shit up. Okada herself admitted she overdid it. It wasn't meant to look like that. You keep ignoring this. <br><br>You keep ignoring it keeps happening in other media which have nothing to do with Okada, like LN, manga, superobot works and manga used Kawamori's idea that Zessica, not MIX would turn male (and thank fuck the anime didn't have that).<br><br> Who cares about consistent characterization and good writing <br><br>Which was never in Aquarion to begin with?<br><br> You're making shit up. <br><br>I'm not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Also the second half of this was horribly drab. So, Logos is about a bunch of faggots with shitty haircuts are fighting an evil wizard who can destroy the world by using MOONRUNES? And Aquarion seems like an afterthought added because the basic premise was so poor that the only way to get traction was to try to arbitrarily hitch it to a different IP and hope it would sell that way? I like how he totally force-gattai'd with that slut, though, and it made her moist. The thick fluffy wimp girl is already losing.  <br> You keep ignoring it keeps happening in other media which have nothing to do with Okada <br>How does this have to do with Zessica's pathetic heartbreak being Okada's fault and not hers?<br><br> Are you that unfamiliar with Stockholm Syndrome? He was brought up as a child by Mykage and he had no idea Izumo was his father. <br>  It shows clearly Mykage thorning and caging a young Kagura into his track dog to lure him to Sylvia incarnation, purposefully planting in his head how nobody will love him but her.  <br>This is a show were they made up shit along the way. You may not know this but Mykage and Kagura's relationship was never truly defined and they kept contradicting themselves a lot. Hell, Kagura and Amata ahd the same conversation about Kagura's upbringing with Mykage twice and Kagura only mentions the abuse towards the final episode. You're not trying to make look an inconsistent relationship like this something planned from the start, because it obviously wasn't. There was never a stockholm syndrome, just the writers making shit along the way.<br><br> That's why Kawamori stated Kagura never loved her. I suggest you to rewatch and to look at the interviews Kawamori gave about the difference of Amata's and Kagura's feelings. <br>Oh, so we're taking the word from the guy that was so biased towards his favorite characters he forced them even though everyone told him it was a bad idea? Yeah, no.<br><br> That's also in the commentaries of the episode by the staff. Zessica broke the spell Mykage had placed on Kagura which weighted his soul and Kagura broke the spell on Zessica. <br>Ah, yes, the spell that we've never heard off in the entirety of the show and that conveniently shows up at the last minute, in the staff comments! Another great example you got there.<br><br> Which was never in Aquarion to begin with? <br>It doesn't give you a free pass into being stupid.<br><br> I'm not. <br>Yeah? You're twisting things to your convenience and ignoring what they're not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be quite the bait and switch for white to "win" (if you can even call it that) the savior. I mean, what's her name is plastered all over the fucking ED. Gee that kinda pissed me off.</br>  <br>Did you watch the show when it was airing?</br>  <br>You seem to be stuck in the idea that characters have control over what happens to them and that it's their fault the consequences of their actions.<br><br>They're fictional characters. They're written by people. These people are responsible for what happens to them.<br><br>Also it seems you think everything was planned from the start. Did you watch this in one sit through or what? It was pretty apparent to anyone watching it when it was airing that they were making shit up as they went. They admitted they had only planned out the first half, IIRC. Everything after the finale is just damage control.</br></br></br></br></br>  I am so fucking confused right now.  <br> He was brought up as a child by Mykage and he had no idea Izumo was his father. <br>Izumo being Amata and Kagura's dad was made up, though. He was hinted to have kindapped Alicia and stolen her from Amata's real dad. A guy with the exact same hair as Amata was one of Izumo's subordinates. Though that was dropped and Izumo was made to be Amata's real dad.<br><br> superobot works <br>top kek<br>Also, as far as I know Zessica doesn't turn into a guy in super robot wars. Unless I missed something, and I'm sure I didn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  Well I just watched the whole thing and nothing made any sense.  <br>Vectors are made - belongs to the old dude while cafe uses the launching mechanism that reminds of angels technology. Old duded was happy that MC was successful. So most likely the old dude isn't even evil.</br>  <br> That's also in the commentaries of the episode by the staff. Zessica broke the spell Mykage had placed on Kagura which weighted his soul and Kagura broke the spell on Zessica. <br>Most of the things you're mentioning along with what happens in the manga and LN are just afterthoughts, though. If you read the interviews, nowhere was mentioned nothing about Kagura being attracted to Zessica or something. Everything came after the finale to make it look convincing. Is not really supporting your arguments that you're bringing only afterthoughts to what happened after the show ended, which are intentionally made to be lined up to what happened in the finale, like the staff comments or merchandise, for example.<br><br>And EVOL is a show where the writing staff was full retard, so most things coming from them (SPECIALLY kawamori) can't be trusted because they're biased and are trying to cover up the fact that they didn't really knew what kind of direction the show would take. Kawamori being away and Okada too, it becomes apparent the writing staff didn't knew what to do, and it shows.</br></br></br></br>  <br> If you read the interviews <br>*if you read the interviews before the finale<br>In case you think I'm trying to start shit up.</br></br></br>  <br> Old duded was happy that MC was successful. So most likely the old dude isn't even evil. <br><br>I don't know, something about the twisters, people being choked to near death and highway damage makes me think otherwise. Though they did mention there were no casualties so maybe this was all a part of the plan.</br></br></br>  I Want loli to have lots of sex.  <br> If you read the interviews, nowhere was mentioned nothing about Kagura being attracted to Zessica or something <br><br>Not that anon, but the director, not Kawamori, the person who was left behind to do the job, brings up Kagura is impressed and smitten by Zessica after the last episode. And that they have a "good atmosphere" there (this is what elevens use for 'romantic chemistry'). Zessica's feelings are a lot more ambiguous, but Kagura is talking reverse for Zessica which is what he does for the girl he fancies. I think Aquarion Love continues on it. It doesn't mean Zessica likes him back.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I'm  I agree, before the finale, but after it, I'm not sure they make a secret that Kagura has taken a liking to Zessica. I would disagree they are a canon couple because we aren't sure what she feels about it.</br>  So Logos is its own series? I thought it was just an OVA?  <br>operation</br>   villain has superpowers that only affect Eastern Asia <br> the rest of the world doesn't even give a fuck while China and Japan grapple with their crazy kanji problems </br>  <br> 7 worlds <br>this series is gonna be another hell of a trainwreck, isn't it</br></br>  <br>But they were already together, Jin was the frog.</br>  <br>It means we have another ten years of this shit to put up with.</br>  Is this continuation of something or original?  <br>Don't you mean 12,000 years?</br>  <br>That already makes her better than mikono.</br>  <br> implying <br>She has the whole ED for her<br>Also she's the very first girl.</br></br></br>  So we'll never have a peaceful Logos thread without Zessicafuckers shitting it?  <br>That's because her VA is a singer. Maia has the OP, merchandise and first Gattai.</br>  <br>The kanji powers affect everything relating to the word/concept. Why they didn't use it on person, I have no idea.</br>  <br>Because then everybody dies, including Kotomine.</br>  <br>If years of mecha anime has taught me anything, it's because of something something about the wills of humanity being worth more than words can describe.</br>  how fucked am I if not even Zessica could hold me to the ending of EVOL?<br><br>or should I not even bother since no kawamori's wild ride?</br></br>  the ending of evol was just bad<br><br>not only that, it also paints a portrait of Fudo as not a badass mentor who has transcended time and space, but rather a cosmic troll who is honestly a huge fucking dick. EVOL only happened because he shit on the big gay angel so hard 12,000 years ago by tricking him into becoming a dogfucker. Or something like that. Mikono and Amata also bust out some love and peace newtype rainbow faggotry in there, too, because their hippy shit was stronger than HOTBLOODED INFINITE PUNCHING.</br></br>  <br>Because it was a last minute decision.</br>  <br> I'd still call EVOL better as a whole <br>I'd rather have a generic burger than one with both caviar and dog feces.  Also you're a faggot making your opinion objectively wrong by default. </br></br>  <br>Because they're desperate for her to be relevant.</br>  <br> Rewatch Nichijou. </br>  <br>Maybe old dude is Fudo and he is preparing the cast to fight against the real enemy on the 2nd half?</br>  <br>Well apparently they'll do it, not sure if under Commie's tag and not sure how they are going to pull it off with all the kanji but hopefully they deliver some toaster breaking typesetting.</br>   Jack enemy Vector to GATTAI <br> Also override the pilot's control of their own body <br> muh savior <br>This MC is amusing. At least he is weird and silly enough for an Aquarion MC.</br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if it is something to the effect of "preparing/testing" the cast, but the part about endangering everyone is what makes me uncertain. Again, unless he planned it out to have no casualties.<br><br><br>I wish his personality went beyond wanting to save the world from all evils. It's only the first episode but he is lacking.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's only the first episode but he is lacking. <br>Give him some time.<br><br>He probably has some backstory that explains why muh savior</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does he also have autism?</br>  <br> every world is gonna converge <br>Wait, if that happens, are we gonna get an Aquarion made from combining the Vectors from each world?<br><br>If Kawamori actually pulled that off, he needs to be crowned the King of Transforming/Combining Robots</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe</br>  <br>This Aquarion Evol Special is a fucking fanservice with all those fighting mechas.<br><br>Also, Gen/Zen/Apollonius is still a fucking hack.</br></br></br>  <br>I like being serviced.</br>  <br><br> Aquarion Opening <br> Not by Akino &amp; Family <br><br>Good job, another point off the reason why I should watch this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone feel bad about the dog?  <br> OP &amp; OST : Not Akino <br><br>Fuck this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br>Don't forget the cast version of 'Sousei no Aquarion' on credit.<br><br>It's pretty sweet, gathering cast of olds just to sing that one song.</br></br></br>    <br>I don't like her at all.</br>  <br>C'mon, it's Aquarion, with Akino around it can't be that bad.</br>  <br> Liking Shit4 <br><br>This kind of cancerous fags that would destroy music industry.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean May'n rigth? Also the OP sucks balls</br>   OSORE!     <br>I swear, if they put another Sheryl in here...</br>   that feel when   <br> samefag.jpg </br>  So, why are people calling Evol/Genesis crossover an OVA if it wasn't released direct-to-video?  <br>Because people are retarded.</br>  <br>It does? Come on, Kanno copied style of previous openings for you.</br>  <br> Stop hitting yourself </br>  <br>Agree 100%</br>  I had the feeling he controlled/soul raped her that entire fight there.<br>She basicly had no means to oppose his actions.<br>Is that normal?</br></br>  <br>Not for True Love: The Robot</br>  As someone who hasn't seen any past Aquarion shows, I enjoyed this tremendously.  <br>Even without having the previous two series to compare it to, you'd have to have pretty shit taste to like Logos</br>  <br>What do you not like about it without comparing it to the previous two?</br>  I miss Mikono-san.  <br> Terrible character designs <br> Anime cafe is a secret front for fightan robots <br> Complete shithole of an MC <br> Stupid word jumble fight <br> Cellphone-obsessed <br> So hung up on giving us a little bit of every aspect of the show to hook us in that the first episode doesn't actually give us anything remotely interesting. <br> That stupid fucking scroll monster <br> The dumb shit they did to show how the 'corrupted kanji' effected the world <br> Where the hell did they even fight the scroll monster? <br><br>Who fucking wants to watch The Savior vs Evil Scrabble Wizard?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Amata.</br>  <br>I'm not a big fan of the male character designs either. Otherwise I just disagree. Especially regarding the MC, he was awesome.</br>  I'M THE SAVIOR.   still no sub without the OVA   <br>When did they say that? I'll take Commie over HS any day.</br>  <br>skiddiks said it, they'll be doing an original TL because Funi sucks. I guess their translator will be sharkweek which makes me doubt it'll be a Commie project (and which makes me think it'll make it easier for them to deal with the kanji).</br>  <br>If anyone who can speak ancient Japanese exists on the twelve thousandth anniversary of Genesis, I really hope they'll sing that song in commemoration.</br>  <br>Got a link or was this in IRC? Don't get my hope up. I don't want to be stuck with shit subs from HS and/or Funi.</br>  <br>Join IRC and ask him about it.</br>  I-is it that time again?<br>How was it?</br>  <br>Boring and ugly.<br>It's probably going to turn out as just another Fool.</br></br>  Will MC become the next savior king, kid.   thick/healthy Mikono-san clone <br> not green hair Zessica clone <br> loli pilot  <br> milf commander  <br>this has potential</br></br></br></br>  <br>Meh.<br>I'm going to watch this with my expectations set to the absolute minimum — haven't watched the OVA either, but it looks like it's been a bit better received.</br></br>  <br> I just disagree <br>Exactly, you like things that are bad, and therefor have shit taste.</br></br>  <br>The OVA was also terrible, but it at least had enough shit for fans of the series to get excited about for it to be enjoyable.<br><br>The first episode of Logos, on the other hand was just bad.</br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like Genesis to me.</br>  <br>Are you sure you just don't dislike things that are good?</br>  <br>OVA sucked.</br>  <br>gattaing like TTGL</br>  Anyone wondering why they even like this shit? <br>Why can't I NOT watch it?</br>  <br>OVA was fine. The 1st ep. of Logos wasn't exciting.</br>  Not even plugsuit loli can save this.  It's already better than EVOL.  i like it, is like a old school Motw that are really rare with mecha in this last few years   Kanji monsters screaming their own name <br>Did they hire the writers from Precure?</br>  OVA was sick, but logos is a piece of shit, doesnt help that the mc looks like shit.  <br>Kek.</br>  I'm impressed at how they managed to make a protagonist that's more autistic than Alto.  <br>Everyone looks like shit.<br><br>And fat.</br></br></br>  <br>What did you expect? It's not Kawamori ride.</br>  MC is such a huge autist, I love it  The first episode was a bit weird, but winning girl is a cute. Mikono was hotter, but this one seems to be pure. Let's hope she doesn't turn out to be a slut.<br><br><br>oh well, never mind...</br></br></br>  <br>You got the wrong girl, anon.</br>  <br>Can relate?</br>  I'm so confused watching this. Am I supposed to go back and see the other two series to understand?  Is there a worse OP this season? I honestly don't even know if I'm just disappointed after the other Aquarion OPs or if it's just fucking horrible.  <br>Don't worry, no one really understands what the fuck is going on.<br>You should probably watch the other two though. There's a pretty high chance that stuff that happened during them will become important again.</br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori's probably.</br>  <br>NNB's OP is the best, what the hell are you on about?</br>  <br>It's absolute shit and way worse than S1's OP.</br>  Comparing this to EVOL's first episodes this feels so nothing. Like the Gattai was weird and creepy and the "awesome" moments felt phoned in.<br><br>I con only pray that it will be the opposite of EVOL and get better as it goes.</br></br>  <br>I don't mind the rape gattai but a 2 vector gattai is kinda meh. The result doesn't even look too good.<br>I better hope there's a mech-on-mech gattai later on for some quad gattai actions.</br></br>  <br>The vectors are fucking horrible too.</br>  <br>I kinda like the idea that they're more unique this time around but yeah, they're fucking horrible too.</br>  So is the big twist in this series going to be that NotZessica is Zessica's reincarnation who ended up being Touma's reincarnation after all?  What the fuck? Last season was Aquarion Love, and now this is Aquarion Language? What's next, Kawamori?  <br> What's next, Kawamori? <br>Anon, I...</br></br>  I say fuck it, let's just watch the original series again week-by-week<br><br><br>Could happen, since Mykage was only part of Touma</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, next is Aquarion Kawamori.<br><br>But really, both Sousei and EVOL were all about love, if Logos isn't too then it's definitively not Aquarion.</br></br></br>  <br>No that's dumb. Let's watch all three series/seasons week by week.</br>  Looking to pick this show up, anything I should know before going in?  <br> liking nanorape </br>  <br>It's pretty obvious that this one will be about how people reaching each other with their words and what they really want to say or some shit like that.<br><br><br>Oh, I just noticed that Kawamori isn't the director.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm almost sure this is going to happen. Celiane's soul was divided in Genesis, why Touma's wouldn't? (Good Part &gt; Zessica, Evil Part &gt; Mykage) <br>Or maybe Zessica is Celiane's reicarnation but from Sirius' part. Although I don't really think so. Touma &gt; Zessica &gt; Not!Zessica is the most logical option to me.</br></br>  <br>If the topics are beginning with "L", my guess is: Aquarion Lewdness</br>  <br>Touma and Sirius were both popular theories for Zessica when EVOL was airing. She was never identified as being anyone reincarnated in that show, but it did show us that later seasons aren't above retconning who's reincarnated into who.</br>  <br>My issue with that is how Zessica's crush on Amata fits into the equation. Touma loved Apollonius. Amata was the reincarnation of Apollo, who was the reincarnation of Pollon. And Touma knew Apollo was not Apollonius, after all that's how Mykage came to be. So to reincarnate, and then be drawn to Amata seems odd. Unless he was actually just tsundere for the dog dick or something.<br><br>Personally, I don't think Zessica was anyone's reincarnation. Zessica was just Zessica.</br></br></br>   "Kimochiii!" by Ayaneru <br>My dick exploded.<br>By the way did MC just fucking NTR that other dude right from episode 1?</br></br>  <br>More or less.</br>  Something always bothered me about the finale of Aquarion Evol.<br><br>How the hell were Touma and Apollo and Sirius's consciousnesses still lingering in Aquarion to give Mikono advice when their souls had long left to be reincarnated already.</br></br>  <br> By the way did MC just fucking NTR that other dude right from episode 1? <br>By basically raping not Zessica right in front of him, no less.</br></br>  <br>I always thought that Zessica is prince Scorpius.</br>  <br><br>GATTAI/10</br></br>  <br>I read a lot of fucked up shit on panda but somehow this gattai left a bad taste in my mouth.</br>  <br>Is there a series I need to watch before this?</br>  <br>Until Fudo pulled his "Nope, Apollo's a dog, I'm the real Apollonius", it was largely assumed that he was the third pilot of the original Aquarion (I don't think Scorpius was named outside the OVA, where Reika was him)</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I'm willing to bet that Maia defects because she got addicted to gattaing with Akira and can't live without his Vector any longer.<br><br>Maybe the show will go as far as to make Maia tell Cuck-kun that his gattais are nothing like Akira's.<br><br>This is just like one of my Japanese doujins.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So... that white haired girl is Mikono's reincarnation? <br><br>As in, MC's true love? The winning girl?</br></br></br>  <br>The MC reminded me of that Kamen Rider Kabuto.<br><br>Y'know, the one who's a gary stu.</br></br></br>  If I haven't seen Aquarion Evol, is it worth watching for this show   evil moonrune wizard casts spell on water <br> MIZU~ <br> MIZU SUZAKU MIZUUUUUUUUUUU <br> everybody's bodies exploding everywhere because the water inside is tearing them apart <br> the world's atmosphere is going insane <br> Joaquain Phoenix runs in with a baseball bat and starts smashing the kanji monster <br> Mr. Scotty gets on the radio and says THAR BE WHALES HERE </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Given how many twists there are in the human body it's really just convenient writing that people's small intestines weren't exploding out of their abdomens when the villain fucked with the twist kanji.</br>  <br>All 3 aquarions have enough distance between each other than they work completely as standalones. Watching the old ones will give you the benefit of recognizing blatant references and callbacks, but when they actually start getting into the "12,000 years" and reincarnation shit they'll stop and explain everything again.</br>  <br>She wasn't, Reika was only Scorpius on the OVA. In Genesis proper the real Scorpius was originally hinted at being Fudo.<br><br>And that shit was a retcon.<br><br><br>That was Shrade.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Aquarion to Aquarion Evol 12,000 years timeskip <br> humanity goes from post apocalyptic futuristic society to well-off super futuristic society <br> another 12,000 years <br> humanity regresses to the 21st century <br>I'm calling bullshit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, the reason why Amata got paired with Mikono is because Apollo hooked up with Silvia.<br><br>The reason why Kagura didn't get the girl?<br><br>Well, he's on the short end of the stick, I guess...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That was Shrade. <br>I thought Shrade was supposed to be Sirius.</br></br>  I miss Fino so much, /a/ ;__;<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3O2<wbr>YcnHSjw0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Fino <br><br>Something about this name just feels evil</br></br></br>  <br>It's because it reminds you of the terrible finns.</br>  <br>I know right? And that laugh is just scary..<br><br>Also are those f-fangs?!</br></br></br>  I miss her too.  <br>She's the most evil being you'll find.</br>  why can't we have a animu where fino and brown fino meet and agree to conquer the world together   Ore-sama da! Gyahahaha! <br><br>I miss her too. One of the few instances where the main girl was the best one.<br>S2 never.</br></br></br>  <br> Brown Fino <br>What? Where?</br></br>  <br>I think he's referring to this one.</br>  <br>Man that show was hot garbage. But brown fino a best.</br>  S2 when?<br><br>I'd be fine with 12 episodes of random filler hijinks.</br></br>  <br>It was an inoffensive and tame show. If you were looking for something else other than some shallow show, you were the problem.<br>But I agree, Choco Fino was pretty great.</br></br>  <br>Since I apparently cannot find anything indicating that Onihime VS has an animated adaptation, what is the source of your .webm?</br>  What's her name, /a/?  momo kyun sword<br><br>episode 1 was shit, but then brown fino showed up in episode 2 and everything became better</br></br>  <br>Peach Tits and Friends  aka Momokyun Sword. </br>  <br> episode 1 was shit <br>Bugger off, m8.</br></br>  <br>Raul is one lucky son of a gun, that's gonna be his wife one day.</br>  <br>Guillotine Gorilla</br>  <br>It is Best Girl.</br>  <br>Wasn't a very successful show, probably never.</br>  <br>Lambchops Do Asphyxia.</br>  <br>She's a miracle of the universe.<br>Her smile, her laugh, her everything.

Those are the important facts that any anime staff and the author(s) discuss during their meetings.</br>  <br>Besides her being hot as fuck, she really was a breath of fresh air as a heroine.

Too many LN tease you with their unique hook only to let you down by becoming generic shit. This one stuck to it's guns, and that's something worth noting.</br>  How could there be such a good girl in such an awful show.  Anyone familiar with this series?

Was curious to see how good it is.  Is there as much ZR as it looks? I don't think my penis would handle if it does.  <br>very different from the anime. there's actually a translation project going on now, though the guy might be dropping it soon hopefully he found an editor.</br>  <br>Shit on her chest because she isn't the Fino I'm looking for.</br>  <br>Lamchop de Axekiller</br>    <br> Fino 2.webm <br>That's All Anal.</br></br>  <br>This is Fino's work attire.

That should tell you all you need to know.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Half of cast in anime is original, LN had some slut that stole Raul's first kiss and made Fino sad. There is manga adaptation of LN which has one chapter translated.<br>There is also manga adaptation of anime, which it seems it had better ending than anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I know about that kiss stealing slut and that there are less cast members. The anime has a better cast and uses them for humor as opposed to cheap romantic conflict so it's leagues better. If the anime had a conclusive ending or a fucking kiss it would have been perfect, but that's against the law for LN adaptations.</br>  <br> I thought it was against the law for LN adaptations to not be shit. </br>      I normally dislike bakas, but Fino is a miracle of the universe.  <br>Apparently Raul is a baller in the LNs.</br>  <br>It is. That's why they changed so much of the source and made this one good.</br>  <br>Why is she pouring perfectly good liquid on herself like that?</br>  She needs it to cure those inverted nipples.  <br> cure those inverted nipples <br>I hope you're just fishing for replies.</br></br>    <br>But they're cute.</br>  <br><br>... This image is really lewd even though objectively it shouldn't be.</br></br>  <br>wait who was the kiss stealing slut and what volume ?</br>  math sure is deadly  Remember the threads?  <br>The threads were comfy. We rarely had shit posters. <br><br>This was airing along with a hell of a lot of popular shows.</br></br></br>   No VN spinoff <br> No Ramses the Architect route ever </br>  <br>Holy jesus.<br> What did she do that was so bad? Is it all from siding with the bad dudes in the final episodes? </br></br>  <br>I remember the anti All-A alliance (aka as A4) we had. Good times.</br>  <br>Fuck off Lam-chan.</br>  <br>She was a bitch to Raul throughout whole anime.</br>  <br>She was a bitch to everyone.</br>  <br>I've seen many tsunderes get a pass for it. What denied her that?</br>  Why, The show was boring and wasted potential.  <br>Go be cancer somewhere else, Lefag.</br>  <br>this<br/></br>  <br>hahahahaa</br>  anyone have the LN illustrations? Can't find the raws.    How could she hide those here?  <br>She had a glass of milk afterwards.</br>  <br>Magic.</br>  <br>I believe it's because her breasts are made of the finest quality.</br>  <br> Fino <br> Finest <br>All makes sense now</br></br></br>  <br>Got the last 2; here is how the novels end:</br>  <br>Raul turns into a faceless rapist for the purest demon queen ever. ;_;</br>  <br>So what is the plot even about after they go save fino from the demon world? From what I heard that part is similar to the anime. The manager is still the person who killed the demon lord etc.</br>  <br>Rescuing Fino is volume 9.<br>This is the plot of volume 10:</br></br>  <br>Oh so the ending to the anime was basically the ending to the novel? I figured there was anotherp lot line they'd use.</br>  <br>I'm not fluent in Japanese, but the details of the quest for the little girl seem different.</br>  <br>Hot damn I love Fino. S2 when</br>  <br>So that is Fino right?</br>  <br>That's my opinion.</br>  <br> Light Novel finished  <br> No translation <br>Find a good reason to live.  Profit: you probably can, but not too many </br></br></br>  <br>there is a translation anon. the guy is (or was) looking for an editor to continue.</br>  <br>I only remember like 1 volume, though.  I sure hope they continue </br>  I just started watching this series!<br><br>I'm actually watching it and Chaika at the same time--what a freakin' contrast between two magic-dominated postwar worlds.<br><br>I kinda wish someone would make AMVs of the two ladies in the convenience store with audio from Kevin Smith's "Clerks"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, you know, you could like, learn moon or something</br>  <br> chinese raws <br>Woah nigga you expect me to read that?</br></br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/there<wbr>s-a-demon-lord-on-the-floor-r14671</wbr></br>  So did the anime manage to pack 10 vols into one season, or what since the ending was the same? I'd love to see what they omitted.  <br>That season had Yuushibu and Outbreak Company. Those were 2 of the only LN adaptations I truly enjoyed.</br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=5<wbr>90006</wbr></br>  <br>While thank you for the torrent, let me rephrase. I'd love to be able to read what they omitted.</br>  <br>People always shit on annoying tsunderes. There's a small and very vocal fanbase of shit eaters who actually like that horrible archetype, but given that the main girl in this series is fucking perfect the shiteaters' voices got drowned out.</br>  <br>I can read moon. I promise you that you're not missing much by not being able to read LNs.</br>  <br> There's a small and very vocal fanbase of shit eaters <br>I'm pretty sure it was just a single anon who was blind and deaf, and some how clicked and hit random keys until some post coincidentally seemed like someone liked her.</br></br>  <br>why is Fino's hair so long?</br>  <br>All-Anal looks like an even bigger piece of shit in the LN</br>  <br>I was referring to tsundere lovers in general. Though it'd be nice to believe that no one on /a/ actually has taste that shit and it's all one big misunderstanding.</br>  <br>Ponytails can give the impression of a shorter hair. Also, magic.</br>  Less than 5hours to episode one and no threads.<br>Will this be the sleeper hit of the season?<br>Will this reach patrician QUALITY levels?<br>Discuss</br></br></br>  <br> Dat internalized muh-soggy-knee </br>  <br>You clearly don't get it.</br>  <br>Maeda Hiroki</br>  looks like there is no DFC/loli <br> dropped </br>  <br>I'm sorry i'm a smalldick tranny who wants a sex change but its poor so I have to be jelous of anime girls :3c</br>  One of these panda thread things.<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/830320/ebeba4<wbr>019b/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830318/21b816<wbr>0774/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/829271/23b902<wbr>3b9e/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/830245/603201<wbr>2c28/</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> left click goes to next page, right goes to previous <br> right arrow goes to next page, left goes to previous <br>It's shit</br></br></br>  <br>You can change the direction of the controls in the settings.
