[ Did anyone order a plate of bullshit? Cause I didn't order a plate of bullshit.  Seriously, what the hell was that all about? Is there more to it than just squirming out of a child romance?      Did she die? Thank for the spoiler.   The way I understand it: Mei developed a twisted mind so she could become an assassin and endure all the horror and guilt. That's the "curse" the boss talks about.  Aki wants to "save" Mei and get her out of the mafia world He himself is starting to mentally crumble under the guilt of his short time in that world.  Mei has adult feelings for him despite being a child, this is because of her "curse" but it paradoxically weakens it, since it makes her yearn for a normal life with him. Basically at the end of the manga, her psyche is crumbling because her jaded personality is fading, but she facing all the guilt and horrors she had bottled up would break her.  This is the kinda bullshit part Aki and the boss came to the conclusion that she needs to make a clean cut and completely leave her killer life behind. As leaving the town is not enough, she also needs to kill Aki so that she doesn't have any ties left and at the same time kill the "adult" feelings she had in order to completely revert to a little girl.  It really does feel like a cop-out though. In-universe, it looks more like Aki just wants to do an Hero and justifies that with all this Psychology 101 crap. I mean, she still had to regain consciousness, get up from Gohongi's cold body and washes herself from all the dried blood, then book a boat ticket by herself Typical "just a little girl" stuff right there                    fuck this shit (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  wheres my comfy ending???    I'm fucking pissed, I had a bad feeling when I saw it said finale, but this is quite the shitty ending. I get what happened, but it seems like a cop out, and entirely too rushed, this brought the series down quite a bit in my opinion.   No she didn't, but that is the last page.    Lol looks like the author was forced to end it abruptly but why the hell would he choose such an ending? FUck this shit. I had high hopes for them to live happily ever after...   Just another shitty end from eleven's manga. I;ve lost count on how many manga ended abruptly like this.   you dont get to have a normal life after killing Someone you admittedly said you have feelings for. so hes dead? glad i never picked this up      They banged then she killed him because he told her to.   Wait, so what even happened after she killed him? I thought she'd killed herself instead for a second there, but she killed him, and then forgot about him naturally from the passage of time, and then those people at the end were just random?  If you get cancelled, there's no reason to bust out some stupid shit like this, just have them escape and end it there.      he    The wait for HS commences.     No new OP/ED this week.       The buttbros after gay marriage was legalized     its an abstract kind of wrong hole.jpg        Ulala    Her interactions with Souma are always cute.     Gokigenyo     Seriously? Why not?    Yugi would be CRAZY not to hit that.   Is Houjou paired with anyone?   Changing op/ed mid-arc is weird.    that reminds me, we never got the Generalissimo Meat pose.    If they don't change to the new ones next week, will they use Souma for the ED?   Shit I've been gone for about a week or two, when/why did hippo become hypo in these threads?   Megumi/Yugi.      one of these days I'll fuck your shit up    Megumi. Maybe Yugi if you're a fag.     not 'til elections arc, sadly.     Alice tries to Gokingeyou   fails miserably     I want to protect this smile.    I don't see the hippos   Because the current OP still has the egg flipping done by Souma. We'd most probably get it in 2 weeks.    That's during the elections.   Houjou isn't a man-hater per se, but she's touchy about guys at the moment due to negative experiences. She's still perfectly capable of being friendly though as we saw with Souma.        ASSETS OUT OF CONTAINMENT            Houjou isn't a man-hater per se, but she's touchy about guys at the moment due to negative experiences  She'd ride on Yugi's D so hard once he changes his mentality on Chink cuisine.     What a qt.      She looks hideous in the anime.    2cute4me. Alice best girl, as always.        We'll never get an Alice EDgasm face     dat ED intro was perfect, JC staff so based    IE SENPAI...     I want to think the new ed will have foodgasm faces.    deep down, she wants what all women do:  the approval of stern men        He shouldn't have been a cunt about only doing just shichuan cuisine he way he does it.     mangahere      Takumi needs to smile more and be less of tsundere fag      The manlet would break in two pieces tho.     i needed to pull up the image fast. sorry i don't have every chapter archived like an obsessive fag     shichuan  Do you even ching chong nip nong? Souma would probably be the one to make him change his ways, &amp; in the process, match-make the shorty with her.       manlet   tall, strong, manly girl  It just fits.       not using Casanova's SnS page  http://casanovascans.com/series/sho<wbr>kugeki_no_soma/</wbr>    Stalker  Read the guide: http://buyfag.moe   Resin Cast   ABS  How fragile would this figure be.     Shiki already unavailable in both BiJ and NY   Well shit, where do I get it now?   USA stores are out of the question for me, since they either require immediate payment or the shipping is beyond ridiculous.      Thanks to the anon who posted about the Hobby Search sale.   She is really cute.    I like to reuse my boxes when I ship things to sell because I am a friend to the environment. Not a casual tree killing consumer.    Looks like you had some good fun.    okay   Anyone else having trouble with Wonfest payment?  Aside WF, is there a way to get this cu-poche Miki?   No worries there, I have a bunch of boxes from previous parcels and can always get more from work.   It was painful at times. Either Yoshino's head would fall off or she come off the peg holding her up.She is too heavy to lean over.       yes    have you tried putting a little bit of blue tack on her peg?   Shit for sale, give me your lowballs.    Your car exploded and you need money fast?    http://www.hobby-wave.com/special/m<wbr>ahoujin_mat/index.html  All you have to do is buy this and reach wizard status. Then you can finally summon your own servant.  </wbr>  2 months into buyfagging from different sites, and all I've gotten from BiJ are order cancellations and site problems.  Are they even any good or is this a ruse?    I asked last thread but I want more opinions. What do you guys think about Pureneemo dolls? I just found a (very) good deal of one from my waifu and if they're good I'll actually buy her.     All NIB btw.     Good thing I don't like their Nendos, Figmas and that I decided to pass on the Stronger scales since they will look like shit unless you get the full set.     How many times has Tharja been glued?     all bandwagon shit   It's always those people who end up selling shit.      No idea, sorry. If it's you're waifu, you may as well go for it.    Anyone know where I could maybe preorder these? HLJ doesn't have them. Seems like they're made by Takara Tomy  <br/>   I'll give you $20 for all of them shipped.   Car exploded, best offer on Ranka is less than tree fiddy, etc.  Email me if you're interested   mbvt33@yahoo.com        Post MFC for PMs.     Nah.    Probably end up on amazon.jp next month    They're gachapon, /v/ermin. You can't preorder them.     lunchtime. high school.   social reject mouth breaths down your neck while you're reading.   can I sit at your table?    Nope.   sits down anyway.  What do people hope to gain in a situation like that?         sounds pretty alpha to me    It's a /v/ thing. Whenever you tell them to leave they always respond with something along the lines of  I'm staying just because you told me to leave       5k  Not bad.  tfw just bought a set of spoons because my waifu is on one  I need more official merch.        just bought a set of spoons because my waifu is on one   You passed the point of no return a long time ago, isn't it?      Thanks!    I'm pretty sure /v/ has their own ripoff of our buyfag threads anyways, not sure why these fucking retards from /v/ feel the incessant need to shit up /a/ too.    You just need to spend on the best girl   Maki      And /toy/ has plenty of /v/ threads as well. Even one for just Nintendo shit.    Yeah. There's 1 prize figure and a bunch of small time merch so I've bought anything and everything I can find. There's only 1 GK that I've never seen and no proxy has been able to find it for me. Shame because at this point I would pay any amount of money even though I can't into GK.      /v/ buyfag threads are horrendous. Same casual shit, over and over again.     /v/ buyfag threads are horrendous. Same casual shit, over and over again.   So they're a reflection of the board? Who would've thought?     Jeeze it's about time. And this was all for a replacement part from GS.   Do people like her because she sounds almost inhuman?  Everyone else sounds like a typical voice actor in a sound booth. While Maki sounds like someone putting on a fake accent and talking from behind you.     pre-order starts July 1st  Anyone see anything on the Raiden nendo? Saw he has a nude body but am worried it'll be a GSC exclusive   If it is, how shitty would it be to order straight through GSC?       took 50 days for a replacement part to get through customs  What the fuck     Senbonzakura Miku Nendo how much?    It was a new leg part for my Amatsukaze nendo. They must have thought it was some kind of bullet or something.    Deja vu    My only package that's ever gotten lost in the mail was a replacement piece from GSC. No tracking so after a month I emailed them and they sent me another one.    Did they open it?    my only package that's ever gotten lost is things I send to other people on Ebay.    I'm picking it up tomorrow.    I'm still waiting on my RSAL package from AmiAmi after a month. I should probably send them an e-mail.    Why?     After a month   You're fully aware that SAL can take up to 4 months, right?       Yes, but this is as far as it has gotten in that time. My USAL packages consistently take 2 weeks. My last one took 9 days.     Yikes     Yes, but this is as far as it has gotten in that time. My USAL packages consistently take 2 weeks. My last one took 9 days.   It really doesn't matter in what time you usually get them with that shipping method, it can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 4 months, if you send them a mail before that they'll basically tell you to fuck off since the limit time is still far away.      Doesn't matter, they'll just tell you to wait.    I dispatched it, out of my hands anon. Look at my hands! No package, see? Baka gaijin.    Yeah. That.  Zero, new in box.  Characters I liked? Sorry you don't have a tongue.  $30 shipped.          Email or mfc?     Not "Rook at mai handus anon-san. No pakkegu, shi? Baka howaittu piggu"    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127195582   LOL'ed  Leave.     Where is the 4 month figure from anyway? Not that I'm arguing but every source I've seen states 5 weeks, Just like 3 months is supposed to be the max for surface.  I know when I had to contact them about EMS they told me to fuck off until it had been a month.      I'll give you 35 for Miku nendo.   Do any of your guys have any serious blu ray collection of anime? I'm talking more than 20 shows.  Most of the shows I would love to own are $50-$120 for the series. The only two shows that I really like and are affordable to me are Watamote and Mysterious Girlfriend X and both of those are just barely below $40. But I enjoy those and would rewatch them again once a year or so.  No...what's the point...I already have them digitally. Blu-ray better quality maybe?  I'm just trying to justify spending money on this. How do you guys justify blu rays?         How much for Red?    Maybe you should learn kana before attempting to imitate Engrish.    Ruku atto mai handosu! No pakkeji, shi? Baka waitto piggu. I think.     Closer but still not completely correct    I know. I tried my best.    You can watch it on the television.   My cat brought me a bird   Let it go    Thanks for sharing. Is it alive? My cats bring me dead rats and occasionally pieces of a bird every couple of days.    Maybe your cat wants you to order some doujin.      <br/>       Car imploded, pls buy burd         isn't it because with delivery services one weeks is actually 9-10 days since you can't count weekends, thus making Monday to Friday (5 days) Saturday, Sunday (that you don't count since they don't work) then Monday and Tuesday (7) to get a week?     Is this your cat?      clothesandfigs@gmail.com   $58 shipped if I can ship in the same box it came in with it being right against the cardboard, $63 if not         Cute     justifying localized  Nigger try buying some Jap BDs.      How much for Tharja and Tell Your World Miku?     I wiill, for today I put it in a cage with water until tomorrow morning.   Though my cat has big fangs, the birds seems to be ok.   yes that's my cat.          How did you know?    Jap BD's? I'm sorry I don't really understand what you mean by that. Like importing them form a Japanese seller? Would they even have english subs?  I don't see anything like this in the buyfag guide.      Yes No      If you need a justification to buy blu-rays you don't even watch then buy the original releases to support the creators directly instead of giving money to some shitty localization hack job.   Watch the rips, keep the BDs.       File width, size, quality and original file name. Here is his Ivy.    Only recently have I started buying JP releases, I've got about 40 volumes of things, about 15 of those are Jap.  I didn't really like spending $60 AUD on a single series, that comes in a crappy box with no extras.  Look for second hand Jap releases, you can find BD sets (maybe minus the collectors box) for rather cheap, and they look great with lots of bonuses.      Impressive    Yes, importing a Japanese blu-ray from Japan. A strange concept I know.    why don't you send him an email?     I going to try this out. Do you guys recommend any sources for Japanese blu rays?   I feel like im being trolled here.   I do appreciate your help though!         I get the feeling that most of us really have too much free time.     I feel like im being trolled here.      They're expensive, but content is better.   CDJapan has bunch of newer releases. Older things will go through manda like everything else or just YJA.       You're so useless that it's moe.    UPS said my package would be here today   check location   its literally the town next over   DELIVERY DELAYED DUE TO SEVERE WEATHER CONDITIONS, DELIVERY HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED...   mfw it was 78 degrees all day, bright and sunny  I fucking hate UPS so fucking much.        Depends on how many you are buying at once. Check the guide for a list of shops and compare prices.    Thank you. I honestly really only want like 4-5 blu rays for shows that I consider a 8/10 or above but that will probably grow in the future    Nobody wants to work at 78 degrees, it's a fucking sauna.     78   hot  It's California, it's not even humid, it's not even hot due to the sea breeze.  Meanwhile USPS is delivering my Yamato on time.       What kind of fag are you? Would you buy 1 great expensive figure or 2 good figures that cost the same as the great one together?  GSC exclusive bonus is some cutesy stickers.  Neither. I like nendoroids.     Whichever one I want more and appeals to me the most. Why compromise for any reason?    well amiami gave me a warning for missing a payment and now theres an order i want to cancel, wish me luck.   Quality&gt;Quantity    Someone with such poor forethought doesn't deserve any luck.   600mm of giggle inducing silliness.  After what GSC put out I don't think anyone will want Union Creative's Mikasa.   Team Fortress' Heavy x ray version.   Orca has a new bunny girl going up for preorder next week.  I am really looking forward to seeing proper shots of painted Cordelia.   I have literally 52 nendoroids     I'm surprised anyone still gives a shit about this terrible franchise. Everyone bought and sold their collections within the six months.     After the Levi they did I don't think anyone would want her anyways.   Might order 2 just for the arcade   I would buy neither and get art books instead.    Looks good(though I'm not very fond of her bikini's color) there aren't many Chouun's good figures out there.    The best and worst part of this manga for me is that it's kind of a history class on videogames. It's good because it's interesting but fuck it drags on so much.    The amount of merchandise it got so far is pretty astounding. It does seem to be slowing down a bit. Once the second season starts up I wonder how much more we will be seeing.    $70 shipped Tharja $60 shipped Miku  To the anon who emailed me for Miku nendo it's not letting me reply for some reason but $30 shipped is fine but if you wanna pay $35 I won't stop you.       Huh, I thought she wore white? Am I wrong?    It's the sort of thing idiots who don't know anything about buyfagging buy at cons, I guess. aka a large portion of SNK's fanbase.    https://<span>youtu.be/4-h_RLZWvzw  [ ]   We need kof nendos.       Her armor is white. She has it off.    I don't know, it's ugly like the source material.    Wow, rude.   Time to cross the event horizon.   The one time /a/nons are being helpful and you think it's a troll.     I agree with you,all my money for some KOF nendos, even I will take KOF Cu-poches       tony taka   doll   the unholiest thing in recent ages.       The great expensive one. I usually buy nendoroids but for a figure which looks amazing I gladly pay more than just two okay ones. Like kotori from alter.    Welcome to the club   Should I buy multiples of amakuni Muramasa? Not sure how rare she'll be.      there are people shilling hotglued figures on this very thread     They even included the silly feet Awakening characters have while in combat.    Fuck off and kill yourself.    What I don't get is why anyone would even post this. It's not "shocking" and hasn't been ever. You're not funny or cool for recording it and posting it on a thread on /a/, and you're even sadder if you saved some faggot hotgluing his figure and then posted it on /a/.    Try eBay. People would pay a lot for them, especially Red and Elsa.    i thought it was moe so i wanted to share     Elsa is 4k brand new most places.      stalking people in an Anonymous image board     It's art anon. Or performing arts.     This saddens me.     Kill yourself.     Scat &amp; Diaperfags rank higher than you dumbasses into hotglue. At least their fetishes aren't huge waste of money     Are you from 6 months ago?       hot gluing unironically      Diapers get pretty expensive, buddy.       tfw going to nippon land in October      tfw can't buy figs due to holiday cost     life is suffering          Why    Reduce,  reuse , recycle. That's what 'ol grandma used to say.    It's just as much "Art" as the retards who make 2 minute walking simulators about gay children running away from home. No, I'd actually consider that more of an artwork than this. Congrats.    Who the hell go to Japan without extra money for the goodies?   Friend go to Nippon with me   Ask if he wanna add more luggage weight   No, I am fine. I will only be sight seeing   End up buying fuck tons of cosplay costumes   Pay more for luggage space on flight back          Is the the birth of an epic new maymay?!  Should I?   Do it. He's best boy.     Tales a shit but he actually looks cute. I would. That stubble and ponytail are great.    Probably, you know you're in trouble when it doesn't show up in another couple weeks.  They might not be inclined to help you until it gets more toward the 2+ month period. Asking them to have the post office look into it sooner probably isn't a bad idea though.  I'm still in the dark about my rsal package from february. Mandarake initiated a search with the post office, but haven't really heard much. I assume it's gone, I just hope I get the 6000 yen insurance or whatever.. It's still a net loss of like 2700 or so which sucks.        But  Karol  is best boy   Anyone wanna take my Wo preorder from BiJ off of my hands?    I dunno anon, most people don't buy large items when their on holiday  i plan on bringing £500 to spend on merc. Which should be enough for what i want.   Did you keep the boxes after you bought them? The size of the box will really limit what you can take back.   I'm told customs is a pain in ass as well.           finally got 1k in the bank   considering blowing it all on figures  Sorry for the minor blog but jesus christ what a slippery slope.      Think about the comming years and figures. If you buy now a lot of shit you maybe wont have enough room for things you woll enjoy more in the comming year. Only buy stuff which you really really like and think about it for a few days before ordering.      I'm glad I'm a picky motherfucker.     I've answered personal ads on craigslist for figure money more than once. You don't know the real struggle.     If I were a cute gril, I'd have as many stds as figures.    safe some money for upcoming years. At least wait for wonfest for the time being       If I were a cute gril, I'd have as many stds as figures.  You could remove cute and you'd still have the same result. There are some desperate people looking for any female to fuck.     just blew $2,500 on a computer   grail pops up on manda   Is this hell?       spending 25k on a comp  What the fuck anon. A good one shouldn't cost more than a grand, tops.     He said 2.5k not 25K     I dunno anon, most people don't buy large items when their on holiday  i plan on bringing £500 to spend on merc. Which should be enough for what i want.   Did you keep the boxes after you bought them? The size of the box will really limit what you can take back.   I'm told security is a pain in ass as well.          muh 4k gaymin     2.5k on a PC   The fuck are you doing. A high tier one that will last you 5 years minimum (at which point you would only need to change the GPU) cost you 1.3k tops.    inb4 I got an Allienware!         Oh sorry, forgot to mention I live in Australia. The Land of Double-Priced Computer Parts.     See   My life really is hell.        Holy shit anon you just made my nose twitch     I automatically typed 25k and meant anime dollars, sorry.  My condolences.       My condolences.      Th-Thanks.    <span>youtube.com/watch?v=w5KRawOXy4U  [ ]   Oh come on, it's not that expensive. You way over future proofed if the specs were actually worth that much.   Amakuni Muramasa or Hestia?    I also bought an expensive as fuck monitor for all my anime needs.      noice      Hestia is FoTM everyone will forget by the end of the year, Momohime is guarantied to stay popular just like she has been for years and her figure will most likely skyrocket after release just like the last one. Your choice in the end though.      Surprisingly enough, that was quite interesting.    What do you currently have in the mail, or is just about to ship?     Absolutely nothing because of delays again.    Day 1 PO     Instant pre-order.     preorder starts tomorrow when the final episode of UBW anime airs.    Any word if this is exclusive or not yet?     not chloe  Why     It's Aniplex+Stronger, which means it's exclusive.     How come Stronger is releasing prototypes and then the painted version so fast yet other manufactures can take year. That Rin was announced just a month ago, it can't get faster than that.     Aniplex+Stronger   What do you think.           Fuck that spin-off piece of shit. I want an actual Illya scale, not magical girl nonsense which is all we're getting that to that shit.     figma Snake figma The Thinker figma Criminal/figfix Conan Cu-poche Hibiki Ganaha Cu-poche Dark Magician Girl         Literally whom?      part of me wanted to believe     All three with SAL, so won't see any of them for another week or so.     That's not bad if you live in USA as your local retailers will have her for cheaper than BiJ/NY.   If you live in  Mexico  like me then you're fucked since 90% of those figures aren't available here from any USA store or if it is they charge ridiculous shipping fees. I talking about shit like 7k for a fucking 1/8 that weights 1kg.      Tell me experienced buy fags, I want the following.   a girl dressed in gothic lolita fashion   not a "stick in the mud" personality   from a somewhat decent anime   Ever since I played no more heroes 2 when I fought Margaret Moonlight I had a bit of an obsession with the fashion, and I want me a statue or a somewhat decent figure of one.  My problem is none of pic related exist and most characters I've seen seem just boring, only one that got my interest up was kurumi tokisaki from date a live, but one problem   only in stock brand new is her sexy kotobukiya statue   The hair cover thing is cute but the statue I want of her is long out of stock, I actually don't want anything sexy I just want something respectable, anyone willing to help find a thing that isn't from china or isn't a heavily marked up second hand thing?  As for what I got myself recently just mp-10 convoy, figma snake, bishujo psylocke x force costume (impulse purchase I kinda regret, gonna stack her at the rear of my collection) and unite warriors superion.  I might be a guy but seeing something like this on my bed side would just be nice, for once something refined as opposed to robots, manly men or overly sexy characters.  Anyone willing to help a guy who has no idea?                     You already asked, everyone already told you Hestia a shit. Now stop.    Fuck off    D-style Burglary Dog some pre-owned Ymir fig     Read guide. Check tags on mfc for whatever you are looking for. Also read the guide.     Fuck tons of Alter figurines getting reissue.   So, are they declaring bankruptcy soon?      Which?     Why wouldn't they, it's easy money for them. Don't have to pay for a new sculpt, just reuse old molds.    I was just asking for help, but ok, I get it.  I should of guessed too many stuck up princesses are here, I just thought someone might like to help a guy choose something other than what a friend suggest.  I'll just go do what my friends suggest and get me that kotobukiya hestia, thanks.   Links not working, where I am is blocking it and its honestly quite annoying, but thanks, I'll read the guide in 2 months time when I'm back in australia, hopefully our government doesn't censor this place, where else can I get hands on user experiences, youtube sucks and photos without commentary suck.  I do thank you personally though, its common sense to read the guide but its just not working, nor is facebook  or reddit, think the hotel where I am went over kill with the internet filter .  I should of mentioned it first I suppose but I guess I thought people are nicer on /a/, first guy shown me this place's true colors, I'll be gone now so feel free to make fun of me, cheers                Or they could ruin shit in re-release like with Shizuo and Izaya     Horizon Kazuno, Dress Code Saber, Suguha's sugus.   Just to name a few.      You sound like you belong to reddit.    Go back to your hugbox fag.     friends   Hestia   facebook   reddit  This is an 18+ website.          Here we go.    I don't understand the Gisen Yagyu re-release since I saw her going for 3500 yen     I should of guessed too many stuck up princesses are here   I guess I thought people are nicer on /a/      Still no Yoko rerelease.     titty imouto getting re-release   Nice.       no KnK Aozaki re-release   Ill get her and Elizabeth alter someday     Recently got half of my shit out of storage. I need more shelves to accommodate figs, artbooks, DVD/BD and Manga    that butt   I am tempted.     This isn't actually official, the figsoku blog owner noticed that Amiami updated their products and "possibly leaked" upcoming Alter re-releases. Some of these don't make any sense, so I'm not sure if it's anything to go by. I wouldn't get your hopes up. But like literally none of this shit is rare or even in a huge demand,    Subscribed.     webcam  Reee.    So...much...meat.   Those colors are really nice.    I like the teal theme.    Got to skype with family somehow; had to dust off an old one.   Preordered. I'm not passing up the opportunity to buy another Momohime. It will be rare on the aftermarket regardless.   The majority of them are on Amiami as re-releases right now. Actually, now that I think of it, the missing ones are probably because they are male characters and I was looking at the bishoujo section.    I tried to downvote you because I thought for sure with a shitpost like this I must be on Reddit.    Don't trust promo shots. they are carefully lit and have been mangled through lightroom.     Aniplex and their jewpricing can fuck off, I'll wait for GSC or Alter.     Shit figures getting re-released.   That's the only re-release that I want.  Another anon was saying that the only reason why they haven't re-released it was that they probably lost or destroyed the original mold.         The rerelease is scheduled for July. These are just shelf warming overstocks that they likely found in a warehouse somewhere collecting dust.  Almost all of these figures don't even sell at these prices A/B preowned.       Nadeko and that SAO chick are dirt cheap as is. Why would they re-release them?     Minus in comfy-points for the following:  Uncomfy desk Uncomfy chair Shitty mouse Only one small monitor Facing windows Flip phone KLKShit Mouse pad being way too small No apparent media buttons on your keyboard Being a mechafag  In conclusion; pretty uncomfy.   At least you have a 3DS.                     Minus in comfy-points for the following:   Uncomfy desk  Desk is very comfy for me  Uncomfy chair  Just because your fat ass won't fit in it  Shitty mouse  Gets the job done  Only one small monitor  Point taken   Facing windows  nowhere else to put  Flip phone  runs android, makes calls, decent 16mp camera  KLKShit  saved anime  Mouse pad being way too small  it is indeed  No apparent media buttons on your keyboard  why would I need that?  Being a mechafag  Eva aren't mecha, they are human angel hybrids  In conclusion; pretty uncomfy.   At least you have a 3DS.  I have two of them                            No apparent media buttons on your keyboard  Why would anyone want that?      No apparent media buttons on your keyboard   owning a shitty keyboard with media buttons       You're pathetic. Quit posting your shitty room and go back to /v/.     Your room wasn't passable on /v/ and it's double not relevant here. Fuck off.     Just in case I decide to rate someone else's setup in the future; this isn't me.    Only got picco ones and they're adorable.  Pure neemo seems kinda hit and miss as far as apperance goes. In that sense they're like RAHs. But they are barely more expensive than a scale figure, so it's not so bad.  They got rooted hair, but since you're buying her for the character that shouldn't be a problem.         Post a picture. I find most of them creepy but some are fine.    Not enough meat.       How the fuck did this go so fast?   Preorder hard as fuck    because best girl   Does anyone have a photo of her pantsu?    you dirty bastard      What is mfc?     Miu is a sexy gal.      Relatively inexpensive and good quality figure of a main character from a popular series.   Man I love witch hats.  Most of my Blame! reprints came today, Amazon decided to ship one separately for some reason. They look amazing, bigger than I expected too. Chaika is there for scale.    Buy only merch of your best girl   Who cards here   you already posted that before    pls show more, and what's the size compared to the jojonium ?    IMO that looks much better than the cu-poche hibiki. The joints are more concealed    It's a ruse. BiJ is literally just one random French guy trying to operate a warehouse out of Japan. At least N-Y has 11 employees.    What if my best girl is Miku?   So MF's Venera got delayed recently, which got me thinking; will their Plamya-sama also get delayed? There are a number of differences between them in terms of marketing, which I have to assume will play a part in deciding whether or not the latter will also be delayed.  Plamya-sama was exclusive to the GSC store, and she had a limited window for pre-orders, Venera did not have either of those things going for her.  Can someone with more experience lend me their thoughts?        You're fucked    I remember some fag here saying Mercedes was going to be rereleased. WELL?    I don't have JoJo so I can't say but they're roughly 7"x10" and over an inch thick.    I want this.      Not choosing best Honda     Anyone have the Rage of Bahamut Olivia figure?  I can not figure out how to get her belt on. It's not wide enough to slip on from the top, she's fixed to her base as far as I can tell so I can't slide it on from the bottom. Her arms don't seem to be removable either.  Pic related. The belt I'm talking about is the white plastic with golden blades.       You can separate her torso.    Heat her up with a blow dryer and push belt down Not too long  I had to do this with shimakaze nendo skirt       Damn, this worked thanks. That seam was basically invisible and not in the instructions at all.   Enjoy the twenty-sixth of June.   Yeah, I had the same problem. Instructions were not clear on this.    Preorder achieved.   dont forget to pre-order the best aidoru   I'd rather not.    How much for Tharja? If its sealed and NIB i'm interested   Can't stop my dick from ordering at this price.   Cheap shit is still shit. The quality is trash on her.    Already did.  Now I have to get Makoto and Yukiho too.       Goodsmile should make more trap nendroid      Not already owning and preordering all in this line that are available.     Speaking of, I wonder how this will turn out. It's Banpresto.    I've always wondered how they made it. Very nice find!  tfw each of them are probably sold at $5 for all the hard work      It's a prize figure, don't expect much.    They actually look really good for prize tier figures. Hibiki and Iori look especially nice (considering their price)    Why do people hate this figure again?    Some silver paint smeared on her skin. She still makes my dick hard.    Her ass isn't great as they thought it'd be.    Which is the best Dangan Ronpa figurine?    Whichever one you like the most.   I ordered this with free shipping for $5 after scamming Tokyo Otaku Mode but there's no status updates, it says it releases on June and it's almost July now. Should I complain to them or should I not? I did exploit their point system.   I think it's paint issues for the most part. I think she's still worth the bin price though.   Box of 120 manga volumes arrived. Just filling long-overdue holes in the collection.   Would you buy a canon onahole of you're waifu?   Can you send those 3 ex links?    Yes, as pointless as it'd be.    I would be kinda angered that it exists. Then I would buy it.    all my June orders except one got pushed to July   my July order is close to 100,000 yen now      canon onahole   canon      I read that as cannon and thought you were talking about GuP or Kancolle for a second.     Not already owning her  Your love pales in comparison to mine.      Any news on MF version?     that feel when stop watching airing anime and begin to be unable to recognize any of the characters from new figures    Whose fault is that?     Always just watch everything one year season behind   Never know what the fuck is going on   I'm glad I have patience.       Japan's fault for only adapting shitty harem LNs and flavor of month manga    Not cheap enough, I will wait for the 20k range.    It reduces your spending and that's a good point    I never understood this argument. There's so much variety airing every season these days that there's bound to be at least a couple shows that you enjoy. Are you sure you even like anime? Regardless, if that's the case there's not much need for you to recognise the figures anyway.   I don't understand. If you caught up you could be doing the exact same thing only without being a year behind and clueless.       kekked.    This.  Better than ending up with stuff you only kind of like and get tired of eventually     Does anyone have both GSC's and Kotobukiya's Shiki?  I like the posing on Koto's but her face doesn't look anything like Shiki. But then I heard GSC's has leaning issues     They should make trap scales.    But figures do that even more.  Brings up the question of how you even came to the conclusion to come to a buyfag thread.        What was the sad thread about?    Let me guess. It's a GK?    I have the original and the reprint GSC, and the koto one.  None of them have issues and I've had the GSC original on display for years.      Of fucking course it is.    I just needed certainty.      When      The fag is just making excuses since he is probably in a relationship.   I have a full time job with some OT and still have time to play vidja and watch 30+ anime show per week.      Looks like shit already.    Now.    I'm very interested on this, how are Pure Neemo's quality? Appearance? I'd like to get one.    The body is somewhat inferior to Volks 1/6 but still okay. Hip and knees joints are a love or hate thing though.       Pure Neemo's quality  Knee joints have QC issues, i.e. some are weak, making it difficult to stand on their own even in simple poses. So some DIY fixing or a doll stand may be necessary.   Appearance?  Varies. Some are hideous, others are ok. Look at user pictures on MFC.  And you need to do haircare if you want them to look like in the promo shots, hair gets kinda frizzy simply from handling them.   The upside is that you can dress them up. E.g. miko outfits or whatever is currently available.               They fixed the face, impressive. Now I'm actually interested in her.      stereoscopic  Neat, it works.     Hopefully the one I'm looking for has jointed limbs, I can't really tell if she has or not from the pictures I've searched.    I can live with haircare and weak joints.   Are dresses easy to find? I don't think AmiAmi is the right place to search for pure neemo wardrobe.         I missed stereoscopic images.      They have guides.        $60 for the Tharja and Saber    I don't like those joints.    Those feet.    Looks weird, even weirder than nendos. Mostly because of her huge forehead or whatever it is that makes her head look too big.    A demoralised Kumiko is fine too.  How are people supposed to see anime as art when KyoAni keeps making stuff like this?  I love Gotou.   That crushing feeling when you can't get good, no matter how hard you try.    Have you been working on those lip slurs anon?   SO UGLY.   EVEN Hazuki and Natsuki was amazed at how shit Kumiko was playing, and they didn't even make the cut.   Why don't they just fuck already?   Maybe they don't know how.   I just can't take this character seriously. I want to laugh whenever I see her dumb face on the screen. She's just so adorably autistic.     2special4u?   shh, Kumiko is sleeping   I want to put her in a room filled with LEGO bricks and watch her play with them all day long.    Because in Japan girls are gay in High School up until they find the D that they want then they endlessly pursue that D. If they fail they're doomed to Christmas Cake status.  Girls aren't allowed to switch D pursuit unless the new D is above and beyond all expectations in the ultimate shape of masculinity.  You now understand why Harems are such fierce competitions.        Why must you respond to shitposters?     girls only allowed to change Ds if new D is greater   thus harems are competitive  Surely it can't be that hard to find something superior to the faggots who typically find themselves leading harems?       Robert fripp did it, you can do it too.    I want to drink her blood.   You would think that, however density also starts with D and dense D also sounds like density which means the harem lead is the ultimate D.  Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.      What are you talking about, anon? Just look at her.    I want to fuck her sister.   Like pie in the sky    I want to fuck all the Hibikes at the same time.  How would socially awkward attempt to court Taki?   peace-chan has a name    I sort of miss those days. Things were so much simpler then.     That's basically the main reason why I want season 2. I want to see her try to act flirty around him.     Invite him on a quick trumpet walk up Mt. Fuji  iykwim .    She should go after him with a bottle of water offering it to him because it's hot. Taki thanks her and Reina dies.    I-I don't anon.   I don't know. I think she would just try to talk to him a little while and then tell him that she loves him if he's enjoying the conversation or smiles.  That or  she would mount him and demand that she start touching him, even though she would probably grab one of his hands and put it on her breast.           The same way how Kumiko approached Taki-sensei this episode. Leave her cellphone intentionally, they go to the room where she left it and then she rapes him there.      H-here, drink this sensei   Oh? You're giving me water?   It's because you look h-hot.  She then leaves blushing furiously and amazed at herself for being so bold.       So that's why Reina wanted Kumiko to tell her what happened.  Sasuga Reina.     Do you think Reina runs a blog or since she's so super special and different from all the other girls her age she has a traditional, physical diary where she writes about her interactions with Taki-Sensei?     I did it Kumiko, I told Taki I thought he looked hot      She would drug his drink, wait for it to kick in and rape him. A few months layer Reina sends him a positive pregnancy test result and attached to it is picture of her grinding his dick.     Reina shitposts about her crush on /r9k/    get on my level bitch.      Reina?  More like REEEEEEEEEEEEina, amirite fellas?      Reina is a pussy that pretends to be hardcore around other people. She would probably faint if Taki-Sensei even touched her.      She's also an M, I don't see her raping anyone.    She's M and S.  She reminds me of me.      Holly fuck a 'proper' nosebleed sacre bleu!     Kousaka-san, you'll be playing the solo. Not Nakaseko-san. You'll play. Got it?   Y-YOU TOO!      She's probably only an M because she found Taki's laptop open one day, and learned, among other things, that Taki hasn't mastered private browsing.      Now its time to disscuss medecine.what was the cause of Kumiko's nosebleed? Stress? Dry air? Obscure disease?       What does Taki does on his computer? Jacking off to professional orchestra music?     He watches that one amateur porn video he made with his wife over and over again. Then cries at the end.     It was not dry air. Kyoto is like the fucking Amazon in summer.    We went over this. The only causes for nosebleeds in anime are punches to the face or indecent thoughts. And I'm pretty sure Kumiko wasn't punched off-screen.      Implying they had time to do that  Taki married and his wife died like the week after what a fucking loser      Dehydration      10 orchestra hacks that will change your life   What this 10 year old trumpet prodigy does next will blow your mind   Depression help       Yuuko plz   Well whadda you know.  Screens are up, fuckers.     It's Key AIDS. Kumiko will be hospitalized right before the competition and Reina will completely fuck up her solo because she's worried about Kumiko. Reina will become a pariah, reviled by the band while looked on by Taki with only a gaze of deep disappointment while Kumiko becomes sicker and sicker. Kumiko will eventually die and Reina will try to throw herself off the school roof before being stopped by  Shuichi  who will  confess his love to her.    why the fuck did I write this       This shits going around.    Like seriously.    Holy shit the ponytail is back.    Ponytails everywhere.    Ponytail is back. Nice.    3 ADs  It's over KyoAni is finished.    JUSTICE    Kumiko must be sweating in that uniform she hates summer after all.      ponytails are back      last episode not called "Hibike! Euphonium"  I'm ready for you, second season.    Didn't Tamako's last episode have even more ADs?   Leave it to Kyoani to have us waiting until the end. The promo image didn't lie, Kumiko has the hairband around her wrist.   Nope, only one.    BUCHOU!    Look at her fucking uniform!  these illustrations will most likely become drama cds, as it happened with free!      Are the winter uniforms their performance uniforms? Only the slackers seem to be wearing their summer get up.       Ponytails vs. Ribbons: which is better?        !       Is it not possible that this scene is before or after their performance?    I think its for the more formal look.  コンクールの舞台で演奏できる時間は“たった”12分間。 それは一瞬のようで、でも永遠のようで……。 吹奏楽部員たちはその12分のために青春のすべてをかけて練習してきた。 北宇治高校吹奏楽部の演奏が始まる。         I'm pretty sure there have been some relatively recent KyoAni episodes with a couple of ADs, I just can't remember which shows did it. Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  It's pretty funny just how little staff is required per episode in KyoAni shows compared to other productions.     Are they really going to focus on music?  Hold old is Taki anyway?   Dehydration, which is why she was given water.    Ponytail is back, fick ja!          Taki in formal attire  How wet will Reina be?     Taki is 34. You should know this by now, Anonymous.     return of the ponytail   return of the winter uniform  It's the obligatory fan service episode.      There have been rare eps with two ADs but three is quite unusual for Kyoani.    I'll ask my friend. I'm pretty sure he can see the future.    Wiki says 34, although it varied from 32-34 before. I'd like novelanons to confirm ;-;    Brilliant.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEl<wbr>5RvbGdik</wbr>  [ ]       Asuka ponytail  I still have mixed feelings about her but now I'm definitely aroused.      the description of the scene is that they fell asleep during practice. And the entire page is dedicated to the duet episode. It's probably one of those "it happened but we didn't show it" artworks. Kumiko has the hairband because she always puts up her hair for concerts, and they were practicing in the concert hall.       Well, it is the closing of three consecutive productions for KyoAni. With this many ADs on board here's hoping for a really well-animated performance. It would be great to have back-to-back episodes with cool animation highlights.     1434178590484.jpg  I really love the uniform designs in this show. The color palettes are very cute. I also like the little number in the back. Nice touch.     Who is she again?    Episode 13 "Goodbye, Competition" The amount of time to play in the concert is just twelve minutes. It seems like it will be over in an instant, but it seems like it will last an eternity... For the sake of those twelve minutes, the concert band members have stakes the springtime of their youth. Kitauji High School Concert Band's performance begins now.       I-I fucking love taki.    We know Riko, we know.    None of that says it can't be an actual scene. Do you not want it to be an actual scene?   Who are the staff for the last episode?   Reina please contain yourself    Go back to your trumpet solo.     Still, I don't expect any more than 16 key animators for the finale.  3 animators teams. 1 from Do, 2 from KyoAni. They might reach 20 KAs this time.  Too bad, their best animators already worked on episode 10-12 so they probably won't be in the finale.          start the show with ponytails   end the show with ponytails   There must be some deep symbolism in this, I can't figure it out though.       Who are KyoAni's best animators these days? Is Kigami still relevant as a key animator?    they had like 9 KA on the last episode, do they even need 20?   There's lots of instruments and tiny details this episode.   They sure do if they're going all-out on depicting the performance.    of course he's still relevant, he did episodes 5 and 11    But no tiny hats.     Plus all the superior Ds are too busy trying to fight for koshien.   I chuckled a bit, but it's true best boys can be found in the sausagefest that are baseball mangas.      5 and 12*    Direction: Kawanami  SB: Yamada AD: Sezaki, Akitake, Hikiyama      Huh, no Ishidate. He's normally the finale guy.    Their best or most experienced that aren't AD or ED - Tatsuya Satou - Shinpei Sawa - Hiroshi Karata - Kunihiro Hane - Yoshinori Urata - Mariko Takahashi - Kouhei Nakahara Kigami actually worked solely on key animation for like a year before Hibike.            Do we know which staff members haven't been very active lately? IIRC Ogawa and Utsumi have been pretty quiet so maybe they are doing some new project.     normally  Outside of his own show and Chuu2? Not really.     he's 34, although I forgot where they mention his age     although I forgot where they mention his age  Pretty much when he first appears.     there's no way Utsumi isn't doing animation for the Free movie. She's just directing anything for it.    just not*   Even Natsuki was embarrassed.   Holy shit, Kumiko sucked.    BD/DVD vol.2&amp;vol.3 also added event ticket.  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/650<wbr>45</wbr>     Its over. KyoAni on bankruptcy watch.      3 event tickets  We jew now     She's not in a position to judge.  She didn't even make the audition.       I think the both of you may be misinterpreting that scene.     I hope she's working under Takemoto's supervision. Her talent shines through the most when she's led by someone else. Same with Ishidate.    more like time to announce a s2    Do they have enough event tickets?    better add more tickets just in case    tfw Aoi won't be at the concert   Yes. That position, yes.    ■感謝イベント　京都でお祭りフェスティバル ～南座へようこそ～ 概要    日程：2015年10月31日(土)   時間：17:00開場／17:30開演   会場：京都四條 南座 (京都市東山区四条大橋東詰)   The same day as KyoAniDo event. It's in Kyoto too.            tfw I don't give two fucks about a random non-character with a subpar design      same day as KyoAniDo event  Isn't that counterproductive?    live action  Is the next episode the last?   There's an OVA in December.     Beach episode confirmed     Too many guys    So we don't end with them playing in the competition?    What? Sauce?    7 volumes, 2 episodes each. That means episode 13 + OVA is in the last volume.    http://anime-eupho.com/product/  続巻発売日情報   第4巻：2015年9月16日（水）  第5巻：2015年10月21日（水）  第6巻：2015年11月18日（水）  第7巻：2015年12月16日（水）  Volume 7 of BDs goes on sale on December 16th. Every BD volume contains two episodes and a short special. Anime TV series only has 13 episodes.  It's the same thing that happened with Amagi Brilliant Park. TV series had 13 episodes, OVA came out with the seventh BD volume.                They announce S2 on Tuesday, right?  I want to fuck Kumiko, hard.   Taki tapped that right?    KyoAni has been consistently doing this format for their TV shows since Chuu2Ren.       Asuka stoic as fuck whilst everyone else is has varying degrees of damn when Kumiko got told.   Now that I think about it, they didn't focus on Shuu's reaction, did they.    Right, because she can't feel empathy.      That reminds me of Haruhi.    god, are japanese ugly without photoshop and centimeters of make up  Centuries of imbreeding do that to you. Almost as bad as English.       That little river play was cute, a push for each other to get good.   Get good, Kumiko.    Must be a communist.        <br/>    Asuka reads it for the first time and plays it flawlessly. Kumiko, who has been playing euphonium for seven years, struggles even after practicing for an entire week.       If you look at the music for the piece she played for her middle school competition, it's not that hard in comparison. The degree of difficulty is just this much higher than what she's used to.  Asuka's just special.    Will Shoe1 win the Kumikobowl?     Maybe on the new AniDO project? They have something to announce next month.     Why do most japanese in highschool look ugly? Is it because of inbreeding?     If they make two more seasons, or a two cour second season, then yes. If they end it with this season, nope. It's an adaptation of a novel, and in the novel he only wins the k-bowl at the end of the third volume.      He's already out of the running.    He's the only one in the running. It might take him a year but he'll get to the finish line eventually.      He's the only one in the running.  That's what you think.     Piss off Kumiko     tfw you will never go to a Hibike event     WAKE UP BITCH    Please don't suck so much donkey dick and PUT THE FUCKING BLANKETS.    Would be weird if AniDo announced the new show and not Kyoani. Even Free's announcement was all under Kyoani's name.     Not Kigami Not Ishidate  3 ADs....  I can't say they're cutting corners but I'm kinda disappointed.             Violin-chan is a cutie.      Is Aoi daijobu?  I hope she gets into a uni and STEM subject of her choice.     I never understood the obsession to study for college during your final high school year.    That's the feeling that indicates that you're not trying hard enough.    Entrance exams. You can't go to college if you don't pass them.    Are entrance exams in japan really that hard? To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd.   Why isn't Reina in any special classes? Is that normal in Japan? Here in America, autistic children have their owns classes. And when they take standard classes with normal students, they have a chaperon with them at all times.  You will never date Reina and then go out with other girls to make her jealous. ;_;   It's the only way to get into university, and the choices of universities you can get into is determined by your score.   It can also mean the difference between a life long white collar job or whatnot.        It depends on the college you want to get into but yes, students are very stressed out during this time because their future depends on it. In Japan it's hard to get in to college but easy to graduate, but in America it's relatively easy to get into college but more difficult to graduate.    It's better to make them socialize with normal people instead of treating them like special snowflakes or giving them Ritalin like in ameriland.    They are the most important exams you will take in your educational career as the university you go to will depend on your results, and that has more influence on your future job prospects than how you actually get on at university.    They are announcing something next month and many people are not working on anything for a long time. It makes sense for them to start acting independently.     To dedicate an entire year just for that seems a bit odd  It's not odd at all in an Asian country. An entire year is nothing when everyone else starts preparing for the exam since their first year of highschool.      I have faith in the Yamada. Hopefully they don't dissapoint with the finale like they did on Ep 11.       inb4 it's just another seasonal staff illustration thing        It just seems kind of odd to base what university you go to on one exam, rather than your overall academic performance.    I think they'll give a solid hint that Kumiko likes Shuichi otherwise they would never should have bothered with the whole Kumiko doesnt know about her feelings sub-plot.  What's Kumiko feeling here?  Abject despair that she'll never reach Reina's skill level?       I can only assume she is aiming for a very hard or unusual career or something, otherwise sperging out just because you want to get into liberal arts, marketing or nursery would be kind of stupid, any diploma from any college could pretty much do the job. I used to think that without a degree from a top tier university you'd be pretty much unemployed for life but it isn't really that important for most 'normal' jobs.      The kind of university you graduate from matters more in Japan. People and employers might look down on you if you're from a third-rate school. Even in the dating world they look at where you graduated from as a way of picking a mate. Probably because better school = better job = payed better = security.   In Aoi's case she'd already failed to get into the high school she wanted so she's already stressed out about veering off the path she wanted. I don't know if it will ever be mentioned what career she's going for but it must be something she really wants.      Do lacks a digital department, they can't be independent.      That doesn't matter, Do can't be independent because they're not a separate entity, they're a subsidiary owned entirely by KyoAni. Pretty much a KyoAni studio in Osaka with a fancy name.     Where is that pic of red rinnon blowing the paper? She has the guts to be in a position of authority.   red ribbon*    What the fuck is wrong with the Japanese male hair styles.    They have shit hair genetics that don't really allow them to have more than 3 styles.    I don't think it's going to be anything too overt. Maybe hints of them reconciling, but no strong romantic hints. Romance hasn't really been an important part of this show, so to make a big revelation of Kumiko realizing her love for Shuichi would feel out of place.  But I also don't think we're going to get any pathetic, cheap yuribait like episode 11 scene either. Yamada is doing the storyboard for this episode, and based on her previous work I doubt she'd stoop that low.     I finally understand the context of this picture.  Reina is murdering Kumiko.     Someone needs to shop Ufo-kun and a shadow of Reina with a knife.     No, I expect a solid one. They've been lacking really because they had to go crazy with the yuri bait.     Where is that image even from? Is it just fan art or an official one?     I finally understand  No anon, you don't.     That teacher hhhnnng    It was one of the very first pieces of official art, and its purpuse obviously was to bait otaku into that nifty new Kyoani show since that artwork looks like POV shot of somebody about to rape Kumiko. If there's one thing all otaku love, it's fat faceless men raping virginal highschool girls.    You're right. They should stop making art so people can see anime as art.    Her ankles though    The Euphonium player is kinda cute.     most highschoolers are ugly  Holy shit anon you are onto something.      anime with so little confidence in its story it has to resort to school girls almost humping each other for the viewers' titillation   art      Can't blame them after hearing best girl Asuka play that part. Asuka raised the bar too high for Kumiko.    The concert scene is one thing they could animate in advance, you know?    I'm still mad about this.  Hibike! Euphonium could have been Kyoani's magnum opus, the first work since Hyouka to surpass it.  But they had to completely shit on it and ruin it just because that faggot Hanada can't go five minutes without an obnoxious yuribait fanservice scene.        Anime is a mistake.     virginal  I don't wanna know how often her cactus was slimy.      mfw he's working with Kyoani again for their next show     When will Kyoani fire that faggot already? All of the Kyoani shows he wrote the script for flopped.     mfw     You're overreacting     He's right. People focus more on the shipfaggotry rather than the story.      Maybe on this shitty board.     I don't go to under anime related websites, but I was under the impression that shipfaggotry is even more insufferable on most of them, and that the conversations almost exclusively revolve around it. Is that not the case?    This shit is everywhere, the only thing that differs is the tone of the debate.   You can travel back in time to the day before the first episode aired.  What would you tell yourself about the show?      Stop kidding yourself. It's every discussion forum.     Cheer for Natsuki and Haruka, it would be a good investment. Avoid Asuka.     It'll never get S2.     Even though I know it won't happen, I'd probably have more respect for the show if it actually went all the way and made Kumiko/Reina canon in the end. At least then there'd be a point to all the yuribaiting.    Avoid all threads on /a/ (or anywhere else for that matter) after episode 8 like the plague.    What does that have to do with the quality of the actual show?  I'm not sure what you would like the Kumiko x Reina scenes to be replaced with either. I know we would all like more music, but without the Kumiko x Reina scenes where would Kumiko's character development come from? Shuuichi?      Not him but the blatant yuribait scenes did feel really out of place in the show and since it'll lead nowhere it was simply pointless to add it in the first place.    Horiguchi is nowhere to be seen    Horiguchi left Kyoani.    If Reina is supposed to be awkward around people then have her be awkward not price charming. Less yuribait more freindship that actually help Kumiko and Reina develop.    Yeah, same. I don't have a problem with the yuri part, I have a problem with the bait part. If they decided to make a yuri romance, fair enough, that also could have made it a great show. But this bait is just pathetic.   Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem. It's like watching two completely different shows when you compare those scenes to all the other scenes. They could have portrayed their relationship as an intense, emotional relationship without resorting to trying to make them look as gay as possible.        since it'll lead nowhere  Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  Who cares about where they'll "lead. It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.       She took a break from animating and illustrates full-time now.     It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.  And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers, which is cheap and irritating when everyone knows they're both supposed to be straight.      It's a matter of what those scenes were doing.   But that's the fucking point. What they're doing is provide pointless fanservice to give yurifags something to wank over. That certainly does not enhance the show's quality and just invites the endless shipperfaggotry we got.       Sauce? I've heard this before but with no real source.      Having Kumiko and Reina scenes isn't the problem, having them be so obnoxiously pandering and out of place compared to the rest of the show is the problem.  These two statements are rather contradictory. It's not that you didn't like them. It's just that you found them unlikeable.     The problem in those scenes are the fact that they stick out like a sore thumb from the rest of the show in a bad way. KyoAni are perfectly capable of portraying intense platonic friendship and yet they went with making Kumiko and Reina look as gay as possible.     Why are you caring more about what those scenes may mean in the future instead of caring about what they meant in the actual moment?  But that's just the thing. Even without knowing what happens in episode 13, we can already consider them meaningless based on all the other episodes.  Episode 8 made them look like lovers. Then episode 9 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends. Then episode 10 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends and we learned Reina loves Taki-Sensei. Then episode 11 happened, and it made them look like lovers again. Then episode 12 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends, and they made it obvious once again that Reina loves Taki-Sensei.  It's schizophrenic.        Would you have the audacity to practice trombone or any musical instrument at your local river/creek?   What he's saying is that he doesn't like the way their scenes were handled. KyoAni's writing them as lovers when they're supposed to be friends.     And what those scenes were doing is making them look like gay lovers  Who the fuck cares. Why does this bother you.  What important is why the scene is there in the first place.   You know what, fuck it, I'm tired of speaking in the abstract. If you're referring to the scene from episode 11, then just say it. I can understand how someone can say that that scene at least made them seem like "gay lovers", but I don't know what other scenes you're accusing of seeming out of place.       AniDo announces a BL eroge adaptation under their own name You heard it here first    http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/644<wbr>86</wbr>    Not at night    What's her name?    Peace-chan     Why does this bother you.  Because it's cheap. It's like the staff held a meeting and said "yeah, we know they're both straight girls and they end up with dudes in the end, but fuck it, let's bait the yurifags as hard as we can so we can make more shekels."     Yoshigawa Akiko?  You really can't read hiragana?      Seems like you just have a narrower view of what is acceptable behaviour for two straight girls than I do.   I mean Yoshizawa.        KyoAni is the pure responsible older sister that doesn't prostitute its characters   AniDo is their rebellious contrarian little sister and goes owl out with the fanservice       Why does this bother you.  See  Their portrayal is all over the place. That's not good storytelling.       Episode 8 made them look like lovers.   No it didn't. It really didn't. What the fuck does it mean to you to "look like lovers".  Then episode 9 happened, where they were portrayed as just friends.  Reina hardly showed up in 9, but she was just as close with Kumiko as she was in the previous ep.  Then episode 10 happened, and we learned Reina loves Taki-Sensei.   Something that's been obvious since episodes 4 and 5.   You keep talking about things going back and forth, but nothing about their relationship seems different after they became close in episode 8. The only thing that changes is the amount of scenes they have together, and whether or not one of those scenes happens to be an emotional one. An emotional scene, mind you, that makes perfect sense within the story.  If two characters for some reason hug in one episode and don't in the next, are you going to assume then as well that the story is being schizophrenic?            I think there's some misunderstanding going on here.  It's not that I hated those scenes, it's that I hated how out of place with the rest of the show they were. See:  If they made them a couple, and made them be madly in love with each other, fair enough. But that's not what they did. If you're going to just imply yuri with subtext, then do it far more lightly. When you make it this grandiose, you really should deliver on it.         I appreciate that the anime gave focus to Reina, Kumiko wasnt supposed to interact with her much until ep 8, but the blatant yuri bait was obnoxious.     Episode 12 had the best portrayal. They were close good friends but it stayed within the boundary of friendship.     &gt;KyoAni is the pure responsible older sister that doesn't prostitute its characters  I-I was actually making a joke about KyoAni KEY adaptations.     They go to a hill at night and play a duet together titled The Place Where We Found Love and you seriously claim Kyoani didn't make it look romantic? Not to forget that unnecessary yuribait with the lip touching.     You really can't read hiragana?  Yeah I cant, thanks.     If you didn't read the novel spoilers it wouldn't of been obvious.     KEY   eroge  W-what.       It's like the staff held a meeting and said "yeah, we know they're both straight girls and they end up with dudes in the end, but fuck it, let's bait the yurifags as hard as we can so we can make more shekels."  You see, this is the problem. Imagine you didn't know anything about the original novel. Would the scenes bother you this much then? Just enjoy the story for what it is.       No it didn't. It really didn't.  Really?      wouldn't of  Just where is this shit coming from.     AIR and Kanon have 18+ versions with H.    You somehow fail to understand that those cheap yuribait scenes look out of place in the show.    How can you say that with a straight face one day after the ABP Ova? They literally whored everyone in that show.     Even if he didn't read the spoilers the next episode literally negates episode 8. At that point you'd be wondering if it was all bait all along.      Imagine you didn't know anything about the original novel. Would the scenes bother you this much then?  If I didn't know anything about the original novel I'd be expecting the two bitches to end up together in the last episode.      No it didn't. It really didn't. What the fuck does it mean to you to "look like lovers".  Obviously, with all the meta knowledge from the novel spoilers, the "confession of love" line from the novels, etc. we know that those scenes are meant to show them just as close friends who share an emotional bond, that Kumiko is captivated by Reina's presence and that Reina has no understanding of the concept of personal space.  But if we were taking the show at just face value, looking at the episode 8 scene, it's clear that they intentionally made it look as romantic as possible to make people question whether they romantically love each other.  It's easy to interpret all these scenes correctly when taken into context and with all the additional knowledge we have due to novel spoilers and the like. But someone who is just watching the show, not participating in any discussion, not knowing about the spoilers, they would have a completely different interpretation, and this is something Kyoani has done intentionally just to mess with their viewers.          If you didn't read the novel spoilers it wouldn't of been obvious.  No, Anon. It really was obvious. Why the fuck would she go out of her way in ep 4 when someone spoke ill of Taki? Why did she notice him before everyone else in ep 2? Why did her eyes sparkle when she said his name in ep 5?  Sure you can make the argument that she highly respected him, but even if you knew nothing of the novels, when you heard her confess that she loved him in ep 10, it's obvious that should make sense to you.  Also,  wouldn't of          I dropped Amagi after 3 episodes so I wouldn't know. But somehow I'm not surprised since it seemed like a souless quick cashgrab with all the fanservice.    subs when   There was no indication of romance prior to episode 8. Kumiko just wanted to reconcile with Reina.    mfw that will never happen     IRC literally took over the place   Is this what a normal friendship between two girls looks like?   That doesn't make them look like lovers you tap dancing autist. Looking like lovers involves /two people/. If anything, that just makes Reina look like a sexual predator. Reina alone, mind you.     No, but Reina stating he wants Taki-sensei's D in the previous episode you'd think it's just blatant yuri pandering.     It's a OVA, you fucking retard, stop saying bullshit.    Dropping the best show on its season last year.  There you go shit taste.         It makes Reina look highly sexual aggressive, but since Kumiko is not negatively reacting to it, it makes her look like she doesn't mind it.    What are you on about? This is pretty much the most calm and civilized discussion about yuri in these threads that we have had for over a month.     But if we were taking the show at just face value, looking at the episode 8 scene, it's clear that they intentionally made it look as romantic as possible to make people question whether they romantically love each other.  Or maybe it was meant to be a romantic scene despite their lack of actual gayness. I agree that Kyoani enhanced their scenes together to enhance their gayness, but I don't think they went too far.   They aren't meant to ｈａｖｅ　ａ　ｎｏｒｍａｌ　ｆｒｉｅｎｄｓｈｉｐ． That's pretty much half the show, that they aren't just regular friends.   Sexual? Really?            goalpost moving  The point was that their mountain scenes were intentionally made to look romantic.   If you're denying that there's any yuribaiting, then saying that Reina "looks like a sexual predator" contradicts that as well.        it was meant to be a romantic scene despite their lack of actual gayness.  That's exactly what people are so annoyed about, dude.     It's called Class S you uneducated pleb.      I agree that Kyoani enhanced their scenes together to enhance their gayness, but I don't think they went too far.   But they did. They also downplayed Kumiko's attraction to Shuichi to make the yuri credible. They went too far obviously.        it seemed like a souless quick cashgrab  They actually just did it as favour for an old friend. Shoji Gatoh is pals with some KyoAni higher-ups. I highly doubt they would've taken a Kadokawa project on otherwise.      &gt;goalpost moving  I don't think you understand what that means.  The point was that their mountain scenes were intentionally made to look romantic.   And?  If you're denying that there's any yuribaiting, then saying that Reina "looks like a sexual predator" contradicts that as well.  I have been, from the beginning, denying that any of these scenes are out of place and detrimental to the quality of the show.         Intentionally forcing romantic scenes between two characters who are not romantically in love with each other is detrimental to the quality of the show because it is misleading, cheap, bad writing for the sole purpose of baiting yurifags.    But why? It's like you've decided that they can't have this kind of relationship because they aren't actually gay, but isn't the whole point of their scenes to show that they don't have a normal friendship? That this kind of thing is just the way they are? Yes, Kyoani played it up a bit, or a lot, but it's not like they took a friendship that was similar to Kumiko and Hazuki's and propelled it to what they have now, it was already pretty far along this path in the novels. I think you would still be calling this yuribait or whatever else even if they had kept 100% to the novels.    Do you feel betrayed?    That scene in the novel, feels less gay. Sure Kumiko thinks about the physical aspect of it a lot, but it seemed more friendly compare to KyoAni. It wasn't meant to look romantic in the novels. Cause Kumiko was more concern about Shuuichi and Reina acted straight.     It makes Reina look highly sexual aggressive, but since Kumiko is not negatively reacting to it, it makes her look like she doesn't mind it.  She's not reacting positively, either. She's in fact not reacting at all. It's almost entirely Reina's game. But regardless, if I were to play devil's advocate to uphold your point, then yes, maybe it could look like they have crushes on each other, but really, the entire show up to that point had kind of been doing the same thing.      I'm not a yurifag, so no.     I think you would still be calling this yuribait or whatever else even if they had kept 100% to the novels.  Not that guy, and I haven't read the novels. But from what I heard from the people who supposedly read the novels, Shuichi plays a much more prominent role in Kumiko's train of thoughts in the novels, and her interest in him is far more obvious.  So even with all the "yuribait" scenes in the novels, you are constantly aware that she likes Shuichi, so the scenes themselves come off as far less romantic.  Kyoani intentionally downplayed Shuichi in the anime and made Kumiko's attraction to him a lot less obvious. This, coupled with even more "yuribait" than there was in the novels, made those scenes gives a pretty different impression than they did in the novels.        Why does Reina have no friends prior to Kumiko? Why does she strive to be special?   She's an autistic chuuni with a superiority complex.     Why does she strive to be special?  for Taki     Amagi was fucking shit and if you seriously thought it was best anything your taste is beyond help.    No one else is special enough to be friends with her. Except Asuka, but she's a bit too special.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127203869   Kyoani did a good job damaging the anime. This will series will mostly be remembered as that obnoxious yuri pandering BS that went nowhere.     Pretty much this.     We never did see Asuka interact with Reina. I wonder what it would be like.     Asuka knows Reina is fucking crazy and probably avoids her as much as she can.  Sociopaths are great judges of human character.       between two characters who are not romantically in love  Heh. But that aside, you can interpret the end of episode 8 as being romantic, sure. But really, you don't have to. There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.      If they also followed the novel, then Kumiko would also be walking with Shuuichi home. In novel she never walked with Hazuki and Midori. Hazuki walked with her other friends and Midori had cram school. Kumiko either walked alone or with Shuuichi.     not made to look romantic   The Place Where We Found Love   confession of love   not made to look romantic       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204171   Fuck that, I don't want to sacrifice the quality of the show just to make yurifags mad.      There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.  Compared to their scene in episode 11, I guess episode 8 does look less romantic.     The confession of love line was in the book as well. And as the previous Anon said, not really romantic. It's simply an easily misinterpreted phrase. As for the name of the song, maybe the staff just likes that particular Hanako Oku song.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204251  and the keks too      maybe the staff just likes that particular Hanako Oku song.   Or maybe they just like to bait faggots.        It's simply an easily misinterpreted phrase.  That's the crux of the argument. Kyoani intentionally made it so all these scenes can be easily misinterpreted.       There wasn't much terribly romantic about it.  Then how come a million yurifags flooded the threads, declared "hetfags" to be "BTFO" and started speculating about an anime original lesbian endgame?    Who invited the shitposters?  Judging by the conversations that have been dominating these threads for the past couple of days, is it safe to assume that virtually no one here still believes in a yuri end?  I'd post a strawpoll but I doubt it would take the proxy dude long to get to it.     Me. I'm sorry.     Everything about their relationship can be easily misinterpreted, so KyoAni kicked the pandering into overdrive to make sure yurifags got baited while simultaneously keeping hetfags on board.  Too bad it backfired and the show is selling pretty poorly for KyoAni.       You'll always still find those rare delusional faggots who still believe in yuri end.     Because like I said, you CAN interpret it as romantic. You don't have to, but you can.   It's possible it was intentional. We can never know.   But by the way, yuri subtext only becomes bait when things end het. For all we know, KyoAni could end the story at the next episode with no indication that things will go in the way of the novels at all. Kind of like how the anime hasn't been completely faithful to the novels from the very beginning.         <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204171  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204352  These scenarios of yours honestly sound just as delusional as the idea that the yuribait in Hibike! will ever go anywhere.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204410  I don't care if you're falseflagging or the real deal, just    Wait, the show is already ending?   When you blow for so long, you get light headed and the blood rushes up.  I used to blow  euphos  so I know.       Seems like a counter measure for when people rub it in your face huh, yurifag?      Too bad it backfired and the show is selling pretty poorly for KyoAni.  How this show is selling aside, are sales all that matter to you?  Do you only consider an anime good if it's a financial hit?      It's already bait because Reina loves Taki. Not even Kumiko/Shoe1 is needed.   I never believed once in the yuriending because I got to see the light when Reina defended Taki. Support Taki and Reina. They deserve happiness.      For all we know, KyoAni could end the story at the next episode with no indication that things will go in the way of the novels at all. Kind of like how the anime hasn't been completely faithful to the novels from the very beginning.   As I said if they did that then they wouldn't have introduced the Kumiko is dense about her feelings subplot.       The cheap yuribait hurt the show's quality, sales happen to reflect this.    Nobody believes in a yuri end. This is KyoAni. There probably won't even be a straight straight end.  It's all delusions and I like them.       are sales all that matter to you?  No, but when a studio adds a number of yuripandering scenes that weren't there in the novels while downplaying the canon het romance, it's safe to assume what their motivation was.      But by the way, yuri subtext only becomes bait when things end het.   For all we know, KyoAni could end the story at the next episode with no indication that things will go in the way of the novels at all.  I somewhat disagree. Even if Shuichi doesn't say a single word to Kumiko in the next episode, and Kumiko and Reina share a yuribait scene, I'd still call it yuribait. At this point it's pretty obvious, based on episodes 9 to 12, that it was all yuribait all along.  is my interpretation of the episodes.         Which is why preorders starkly fell after each one of the heavy "yuribait" episodes. Oh wait, that never happened.    Too bad, compare to the novels that subplot feels forced, because that came out of nowhere from Kumiko's end. inb4 idiotic argument.    scenes that weren't there in the novels  But they were.  canon het romance  What canon het romance? Certainly not Kumiko x Shoe1, they're just good friends up to the end of the most recent volume published. Sure Shoe1 would like to take it further, buy Kumiko is euphosexual.       Of course the preorders didn't fall, yurifags got baited and preordered it. Too bad not enough of them got baited for the show to have good sales.    Then lets pray for a music friendship end.     What canon het romance? Certainly not Kumiko x Shoe1, they're just good friends up to the end of the most recent volume published. Sure Shoe1 would like to take it further, buy Kumiko is euphosexual.  Kumiko's reaction to Hazuki and Shuuichi's date in novel 1:   "Hazuki-chan's been like that for a while now."    Sapphire lowered her voice as she responded.   "She's going to the festival with the person she likes today. And she's planning to confess to him."    "Oh man, youth on full display! Gives me heartburn just hearing about it!"   Natsuki's face clearly twisted. Her voice was pretty loud, but Hazuki gave no reaction. Somehow, she couldn't hear a thing.    That "person she likes" was no doubt Shuuichi. In an attempt to turn her attention away from the conversation, Kumiko let out a small sigh. She felt a little sick. As if something in her stomach was bubbling up, a muddy sort of feeling began to well up inside her. And as if it was able to course though every one of her veins, the feeling began to spread throughout her body. As if in an attempt to cool the fever that had accumulated in her fingertips, Kumiko gripper her euphonium tightly. I don't like this. I really don't. She couldn't quite explain why, but the thought simply drifted through her mind.                Hazuki vying to act as a go between for Kumiko and Shuuichi also worked to allow her to bounce back.      that subplot feels forced      I haven't read the novels, but from what I've heard in these threads the "yuri" scenes in the novels were nowhere near as intense as in the anime, while Kumiko's crush on Shoe1 was way more obvious. KyoAni intentionally downplayed the het and intensified the yuri.     But they were.  Don't you know it's against the law to tell lies on the internet?       Shoe1   Stop pretending to be dense you one retard who puts 1 after Shoe.       I talked with my japanese friend and he told me "冥利に尽きる" wasn't actually tied to formality! there's hope, HOPE.    Are you saying I'm replying to myself?    Why Kyoani can't into hands?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204564   It's canon those shows are het  How can they be "het" when they're not romance shows at all? They're magical girl shows, and yuri undertones are basically a staple of the genre at this point. I don't doubt that it could happen "in-universe" if you would, but I don't think it would ever be animated.  Besides, Madoka living a normal life is dependent on Homura being in control. With her dead, wouldn't Madoka be too busy being God to get a boyfriend?      Fuck you, my cute cartoon girls don't need knuckles.    Oh god.   There's hardly any middle ground here, it's no man's land between mad gay and strictly friends.  Reina and Kumiko aren't in love with each other romantically, but they're extremely close as friends. Especially given each other's eccentricities, Reina has little regard for social norms and strives to be unique and Kumiko is kindred spirit in this regard.   Kumiko being the honest and blunt person she is finds Reina's attitude to life attractive and bonds tighly with Reina, you could say she loves her in a platonic sense.   Add Kyoani's directions and you have a lot of people interpreting this in wildly different directions.         Shitposting aside, I do wonder how Homura would react if Madoka fell in love with a boy in that fake universe and they started dated.  Would she cry herself to sleep while thinking that she's happy as long as Madoka is happy? Or would she erase him out of existence and wipe Madoka's memory of him? Homura is both extremely masochistic and possessive, so she could go either way.      They're usually moving or not the focus of the scene so they don't bother with making them detailed, but they can into hands when they need to.   Who is this semenus demonus?   You're not fooling anyone with those implants, Homura-chan.    best section best waifus    Clearly, Kumiko has been stick stuff up her nose.    Indeed. Sans that rumour mongering Lala of course.   Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry.       Why is she always so angry?           Oh fuck my bad that's not her, I got confused with the red ribbons.      28 third years   14 second years   22 first years   Why are second years so useless?       <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127204988  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127205167   Getting this autistic over cartoon lesbians, implied or otherwise  Please tell me you're just shitposting.       冥利に尽きる  What     It's that one guy who's obsessed with Reina getting the T and wants to believe he wouldn't reject her.    Fallout from yesteryear's bandgate.     Novelfag himself said it was a strange 'rejection'. I'm not that guy by the way.     No I mean what is this  冥利に尽きる       and wants to believe he wouldn't reject her.  He doesn't though.     Updated. Now featuring the names of Peace-chan, Right Fagott, and other top hit background waifus!   What's the deal with these two?   They are clarinets  and also murderers     Any information on the cast´s school grades?    Asuka's parents will eventually make her quit the band because of her shit grades.    megane sees for maigami, they share senses through physical contact    Will Reina ever love Kumiko back? please say yes   http://www.bilibili.com/video/av248<wbr>3704/</wbr>   What are you on about? She already loves her back.  Kumiko is her only real friend in the whole world.      It's already subbed and up on nyaa, dude.    Will Kumiko ever love Shuuichi back? please say yes    Kumiko sucks at maths.   Goto also comments that Asuka isn't focusing on her entrance exam studying enough.    Foreshadowing, Asuka's parents force her to quit band to study. Owned.          Not by the end of episode 13, at least.    I feel like KyoAnus is trying to force Shitichi down our throats for the ending.   They actually gave him extra scenes these past few episodes with the trombone trouble. Kumiko and Shitichi don't even interact at all until the second novel after his failure of asking her out.  Tamako Love Story 2.0, fuck KyoAnus       Where you seriously expecting a yuri ending?     Right fagott has a name   Doesn't matter because I'll keep calling her right fagott.      Kumiko and Shitichi don't even interact at all until the second novel after his failure of asking her out.  Isn't there supposed to be a foot stepping on scene in the final episode according to novel spoilers?  Maybe this last episode's Shuichi scenes were a replacement for that since they want to focus on music only in last episode?        Can anybody decipher those Mongolian cave writings? I want to learn my background-fu's name.      Stay salty, faggot.     It's a lead into the foot stomp.    Why would Taki reject her though?    Right Fagott is Oka Mikino, Mikino being her first name.    Because he's not a desperate loser who wants to get laid at all cost and realizes she's just a dumb teen girl with a crush on an older authority figure.  And that's not even mentioning how it would affect his professional reputation or how it would make things awkward with Reina's family as two families are close personal friends.      Thanks, kind Anon.    Eh, he just has to wait until Reina finishes school and there shouldn't be any problems with his reputation. I wouldn't see much of a problem with it from the family perspective if Reina's love is so unconditional she'd be unable to give up on it  besides they know the guy. If he fucks up they'll have him by the balls. Also, age-gaps are kind of a thing in Asia.     I want to buy a fagott but they cost so much.  I just want my old love back.      This reed sucks.   I need to make new ones again.      Why is she inside an instrument case?     reeds internally     Smug fagott is a best.     Amagi   Best of anything  It's one of the worst KyoAni shows, just barely above Chuu2 Ren.      Cry harder, landwhale.    Fagott is hard to learn, expensive and there isn't that many opportunites to play it. I respect anyone who can play it.    Thing is before this episode KyoAni actually cut out a lot of Shuichi interaction that was in the novels, and also completely changed how Kumiko initially reacted to him regarding the Agata Festival.  If anything they're devaluing him.      Midori was creepy and a huge bitch, TomatoxMidori wasnt even a cute pairing. KumikoxReina, on the other hand, its so cute, good and perfect that god would never let it happen    This image has to be bait.  I don't think anyone actually wanted Midori to win.     its a fucking bassoon, who calls it a fagott anyway    People who are bad at Italian?    I only heard Americans calling it a bassoon. It's called a fagott here.    Everyone outside the Anglosphere and France.   Fuck /a/, I have a new waifu     I salute your autism.    WHAT HAVE YOU DONE     Yurifags were clearly upset, and the mod was clearly a huge yurifag.     What happened to the last one?    I used to play it years ago. The only trouble I remember having with it was because I was a child my hands were just a bit too small. Then I became a lazy idiot and quit.     Yurifags   upset   mod   huge yurifag        Didn't get any screen time last episode.    you should as well kill yourself and end your pathetic existence.     It's true though.     You disloyal animal.    Do not demoralize the Kumiko.    You can find that thread on the archives. You can also find /u/ threads about Tamako Market (TV series) on the archives as well.  I just skimmed through those /u/ threads out of curiosity and there's a surprisingly a lot of hate towards Mochizou. I keep hearing they liked him and Tamako and were happy with Midori just being portrayed as a realistic lesbian character. But those threads seem to indicate otherwise.          projecting anon this autistic      bariton saxophone   bariton  Jesus Christ is there any quality control over at kyoani       Then I became a lazy idiot and quit  I bet everyone on 4chan get give an example of that.      Not knowing the difference between bari sax and bariton  Anon pls.     I play the piano so no    Prime damage control.  Yurifaggots are so pathetic.     I just assume it's another arbitrary German rendering, just like Fagott.    bariton is literally German for baritone, there is no such thing as a bariton sax unless you are German and then it is still a baritone sax. they also use the english version for everything else so your point doesn't really stand    I have learned from you just know that there is a an another way to write Bariton.    Those threads were mostly dominated by the delusional /u/ fans. Others just ignored it.    Percussion best section.    I bet you call a fagott "bassoon".    I like it.   US Supreme Court legalize sex marriage in 50 states so why don't we might as well embrace the KumikoReina yuri route?  would you an old taki?   Because Japan thankfully hasn't reached that level of retardation yet.     US Supreme Court legalize sex marriage in 50 states  USA, YES     Same sex marriage is legal in shibuya, educate yourself    Japanese constitution defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. Shibuya is just one small part of Tokyo where they have recognized civil unions. Obviously it's a pretty major victory for a country as conservative as Japan, but it's nowhere near real equality.      Fuck off with your tumblr tier bait       taki is actually 34 years old     He's pretty young and pretty hot     Reina pls.     look at him and tell me he's not gorgeous   I've never run home crying and screaming about how I want to improve. Guess that's why I ended up here.   That doesn't happen, so it's fine.    I honestly start to believe that everybody in this show have mental problem. It's not normal to run and scream that you want to get better.     slacker pls     implying kyoani isn't setting up Reina and Kumiko to be new characters in the next season of chuu2      great, an SL anime about a brass orchestra /a/ semi approves  played horn for years when I was a kid  this gonna be gud  no qt horn player after 3 episodes  why even bother  shall I continue anyway?           With Reina joining the crew, at least Rikka wouldn't be the biggest chuuni anymore.    I want to belive.       I am amazed this is legit.     you know i want a yuri end just to piss off everyone who hates yuri, i think it would be hilarious    God damn they're fucking dumb.    What the fuck man.     Well feel free to dream.      it's real      Yurifags everyone.     Concentrated_cancer.png    This has got to be a troll.    As expected of Crunchyroll    This is fucking embarrassing. Why do people feel the need to try and co-opt some chinese cartoon that got zilch to do with the issue at hand in order to spread their political bullshit? I don't even care whether same-sex marriage is legal or not, but sometimes I'm really tempted to oppose it just to spite for fuckers such as those.     Crunchyroll want to start a yuri vs heteo flamewar.  That's absolutly hilarous.     How many days in advance do they even receive the episode?    More like annoying. This shit is not needed.     Cancer     Its a trap.    Because twitter is all hyped up, and the morons in charge of marketing for these companies always feel like they have to find someway to make themselves part of the hype.    I don't even know how to react to that.     I haven't actually watched it  Wow.          No matter what happens       liberal bias in media isn't real they said   even some distributor for jap cartoons spews liberal propaganda now       Camilla  Oh yeah NoA announced FE:If would have gay relationship, for like two characters.  And once again, Crunchyroll demonstrating how cancerous they truly are and why Twitter is fucking shit.       I believed nothing would come close to the cancer of the tumblr petition for Free but I was wrong.    This makes me mad.     GENTLEMEN, LET US SHITPOST    These reactions are hilarious.   Based HorribleSubs.     What the fuck are they doing? This could backfire terribly on them, depending on how episode 13 goes.     Im a huge yurifag but fuck assholes who use girl love as a progressive and political message    This whole anime is backfiring. God what a train-wreak.   Post smug anime. I need to expand my collection.     Not even the biggest lesbo of her own series.    whats up with you people and smug?    Call me when Aya puts a wig on someone because she's separated from Youko.    Shino will never be this smug   Will we ever get a romcom that surpasses School Rumble?  Nichibros  Probably not, though possible since Pie End turned a potential Masterpiece into just a great anime.   SR is my favorite by far but just to be fair: Ranma 1/2 Nichibros Jitsu Wa Watashi Fujiwara wa Meitsu and probably few more i forgot.  Too bad his Bike manga was so short..            Nichibros wasn't a romcom.    Seto no Hanayome tops it by a little.    Nichibros isn't a romcom you idiots, literarly girl/megane guy sections don't even make 10% of the entire series.       nichibros   romcom         At was "romcom" as much as School Rumble. Most romance in SR was for comedy purposes, it never was straight romance manga. Similarly Nichibros has multiple romance storylines too.      Nichibros barely has any romantic or even relationship elements between the sexes, whereas the entire focus of School Rumble is characters liking eachother. Stop being retarded.     Nichibros has multiple romance storylines   wut? Are we even talking about the same manga here?       I can count least 3 canon romance interests pair in Nichibros.     Alright, but that doesn't in any way change that it wasn't close to the focus. Do you even know what a romcom is? It explicitly stands for "romantic comedy", so a manga where the entire focus is romance while also maintaining comedy is exactly what a romcom is you dolt.     3   Manga barely even focuses on romance aspects   Pic related is a romcom, Nichibros isn't.       Even if OP said "comedy", no fucking way. Nichibros was just a mess of disjointed skits, at its best it was amusing, at its worst it was fucking terrible and annoying. It does not even come close to touching School Rumble's greatness.    The comedy in nichibros was all about daily live, the comedy in school rumble was around the romance between the characters. It's different.   I don't think so, Harima was a really good MC and the girls were all good too, Eri was a perfect tsundere.       Except SR is not what you describe. Its entire focus is comedy and romance is just convinient plot device.  If you cant see difference between SR, Fujimura, D-Frag and say Nisekoi, Ichigo 100% and Oreimo too bad for you.      I enjoyed both immensely but I think School Rumble wins for not being a harem.    The motivations for Harima or Tenma to do anything are entirely driven by romance. It's as much plot device as breathing to keep characters alive.    Fuckin lol'd at Karasuma and the curry. Been so long since I've read SR.    Holy shit did you never watch or read School Rumble? Every single thing they do is because they want to somehow get another person to fall for them. How the fuck is the entire plot and motives of every character somehow a plot device rather than the core of the story?    Next thing you say Hayate no Gotoku is romance manga too and thus should not be put in same category as Nichibro`s etc.  Your autism knows no limits, control it. SR was comedy first and foremost. Its no different from Hinamatsuri, Nichibros or Cromantie in that aspect.      Hows the manga compare to the animu I have only watched it.    Great series but the FeMC was unbearably stupid.     Holy shit did you never watch or read School Rumble?  Did you? Dont tell me Tenma for half the show being in love with Kappa alien was romance driving the manga?     I don't think a human being can't be any more wrong than you are right now.    I've only read.    School Rumble had almost every character driven by some form of romantic interest while having heavy comedy. Comedy isn't the focus of the story nor the drive for any character, but it still has heavy comedy elements thus it's a romcom. If you can't understand something so simple and go to such lengths as to claim Nichibros was a romcom then you're retarded.    He probably thinks Onidere isn't a romcom.    School Rumble cast is huge and they all have their different crushes, the series doesn't only focus on Tenma. That collective romance was quite literally driving the manga.    Watch it , its great.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=WpT<wbr>7S2y1MKo</wbr>  [ ] https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9fy<wbr>2GnPZtQc</wbr>  [ ]      So did the qt wrestler girl get it with the stupid crush of hers ? The only romance i cared about   Didn't mikoto end up with Hanai?   The closest thing we have is Sket Dance, it could have surpassed it but it dropped the ball by the end.   Yeah, but at the time they were only close friends. Even when they were about to get pretend-married, they couldn't and ended up just spending the time as friends.    Nichbros cast is huge and they all have their different crushes, the series doesn't only focus on yankee liking baseball guy. That collective romance was quite literally driving the manga.    Tenma almost ruined the show for me, Harima saved it for me.     That collective romance was quite literally driving the manga.  Except it wasn't? The vast majority of the manga was characters doing daily shit rather than focusing on any actual development for the romantic interests or anything.    That paint ball episode was fucking brutal.   mfw the best girl is the sister of the band shit girl and she will never ever get the D  I hate everyone.     Mentions that he can only count 3 romances in Nichibros   Tries to pull a counter argument by contradicting himself later      School Rumble is what got me into Anime will always be a special series to me. I will rewatch it every year or so and can't whether it's objectively a good series due to my nostalgia.     rather than focusing on any actual development for the romantic interests  School Rumble, Ranma 1/2 and Hayate no Gotoku had such thing?!    Did they ever tell what Karasuma's illness was? Alzheimer?   My Negro.   Same boat.      Toradora was better.    I can't rewatch SR anymore, it honestly depresses me when I finish it. It's still probably my 4th favorite series to date.    Yes? Nagi in particular has matured ridiculously much and her relationship with Hayate isn't nearly as naive as at the start.    Not much comedy and too much love triangle drama.    Toradora was better romance, as comedy doesn't even stand a chance.   School Rumble will forever be the best Romcom. No if's, and's or but's     Hayate becoming cinical dandy asshole is hardly a romantic development.  Nagi`s character development is as irrelevant as all others. The only ark with remotely any development is Athena`s.     Man school rumble is so underrated   As a romance yes, as a comedy School Rumble is far better.   Had this same question yesterday so I tried looking for some snime. After filtering out everything I hated arakawa under the bridge was threat thing I could find.  I should re read school rumble Z   If you wanna closure on some things Yes, if you feel satisfied with what you already know then no.    I just dont really remember what happened. Its been like 2 years so i wanna refresh my memory      Valid points that SR was funnier and Toradora had the better romance, but both are technically romcoms and Toradora is simply better overall because of SR's unfortunate ending. SR would unquestionably be GOAT if not for the unfortunate ending.      You are an autistic retard.  SR and Toradora have litterally nothing in common. SR is pure episodic comedy manga nothing else. Toradora is romantic light novel, along with Golden Time.  What next, comparing Ouran High School and Diabolic Lovers?         unfortunate ending   Anon if something sets apart SR is precisely the end, no RomCom has the guts to take that road   I don't like the comparison with Toradora because they are both total opposites  Just to be clear Toradora is on my holy trinity.         http://myanimelist.net/anime/4224/T<wbr>oradora!  Romance   Comedy  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torad<wbr>ora!  Romantic comedy  </wbr>   </wbr>     MAL   tumblr  Thank you, that explains all of it. Just summer.     It pains me that we'll never get a glorious season 3 with all the great stories it came with. Though it was nice how the animated the last few chapters in two episodes.    L O N D O N arc will never be animated     https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/en<wbr>cyclopedia/anime.php?id=10050  Comedy   Romance  http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.p<wbr>l?show=anime&amp;aid=5909  Comedy   Romance   </wbr>   </wbr>    It pains me more that Jin Kobayashi seems to have lost will to work.  Ichiro Heian! was still great, but atm there is no perspective of him starting something new akin to SR.       no RomCom has the guts to take that road  They could have ended it with a choreographed cast-wide symphony of farts instead of  a piefight.   no RomCom has the guts to take the road of a fart symphony, GOAT       Wait, Ichiro Heian got fully translated?    I'd say that Toradora wasn't especially good as a romcom when compared to School Rumble. It feels like something that would've worked better as pure romance whereas School Rumble is pretty much exactly what a romcom should be.   Is Harima one of the GOAT MCs?   Yeah, I can't think of anyone better despite being a 100% self-insert for the author.     whereas School Rumble is pretty much exactly what a romcom should be.  Except the ending, which is literally the most important part of any story, is complete shit.      anime only fag     So, Yakumo did actually love Harima? I thought it was more in the possible love territory.    I wouldn't say its better than School Rumble, but I feel like Hatsukoi Limited is just as great. They're pretty similar because they both feature huge casts and there are many love triangles/squares/polygons. I really love shows like this, too bad its hard to find really good ones.   The ending was okay. Not what I expected but it wasn't as insultingly bad as people seem to imply. We got to see an epilogue so we know that Tenma actually ended up happy, and Z made it clear who won.    She did actually love Harima, but she couldn't admit it to herself until it was too late to her weird dream ghost friend.    Eri was the worst and should have died horribly offscreen somewhere    Not sure how I feel about Eri winning   But School Rumble was God awful.   Kill yourself. Eri was the best tsundere there is, and her interactions with Harima actually had emotional impact while being natural.     tripfag is a contrarian with shit taste  who would've thought     I loved that anime, truly an awesome Romance anime.    But Hatsukoi has nothing in common with SR? Its Amagami territory.    Does SYD count as a romcom?    How? Amagami had one protagonist get with different women, while Hatsukoi had multiple characters that were focused on instead of just one protagonist.    Hatsukoi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Amagami.      alternate universe   canon  SRZ is not an ending to SR's canon universe story. It is a collection of alternate universe sidestories.       The final chapter with the graduation was specifically made because people wanted a decisive ending, so he delivered. Calling it non-canon is just silly.    To elaborate, the events in SRZ are exactly as canon as pic related. Sorry, Erifags.     comparing a game with multiple endings to a story designed to show who ended up with Harima  Fucking dumb.     I remember when I read SRZ it literally said in SRZ itself, I'm paraphrasing here, "this is a collection of stories in an alternate universe/alternate timeline/something like that."    No, it's exactly the same thing. They're both instances of alternate universe stories.  a story designed to show who ended up with Harima  No, it was a story designed to show up who ended up with Harima in an alternate universe in order to appease fans. The author didn't have anyone win in the canon universe because he didn't want anyone to win, and he kept it this way by specifically stating in SRZ that the stories within were not in the canon universe.      There's not even any reason to argue this when it's very clear what the purpose for it was. Having someone win in an alternate universe without showing multiple endings with the different characters would be pointless.     it's very clear what the purpose for it was  Fan appeasement. That's it.      the author straight up said it's non canon   b-b-but t-that's p-pointless!  Eri a shit. Yakumo a best. Eri didn't win. Deal with it Erifags.      You will never finish your backlog    tfw used to watch every anime each season now i only watch around 4 and probably drop 2 half way   What is the point of this statement. You can't finish your backlog because you keep adding to it. Why does that make you sad?  Are you sad that you will never run out of dreams and hopes?      even Teekyuu and Danna gets backlogged   bokurano, teekyu, strawberry lolis, Eyeshield 21, Last season of Slayers, Cutey Honey F, Star Driver, Locodols, Gatchaman Crowds, Denkigai, IkaMusu S2, Chobits, Pripara, precure movies, Baccano Pick one    That's objectively false. I watch 20-30 episodes per week, half of those are airing, half - backlog. At this rate I will run out of worthwile anime in a few years.    Gatchaman. New Season in a week.    Why would you want to finish your backlog in the first place? It feels pretty great to know that you have anime you can watch whenever you want and that you'll never run out of it. Why do people complain about this? It makes no sense.  You're supposed to watch anime because you enjoy watching anime. Not watching it so you can finish it and be able to say you watched it. The journey, not the destination.         only because I can't download/find them.    I actually enjoy watching anime. I get worried when my backlog starts shrinking, then i quickly go and torrent some anime from my download list.     jesus christ, go breathe outside, fucking get a social life.    Thats a good thing isnt it   You acquired taste       If you take advantage of the features of modern media players, you can easily catch up to a backlog of any length. They all have some kind of sped up playback now. And you can watch anime without losing any detail at at least 1.5x speed, and easily up to at least 4x or even 5x once you get used to it. Not only will this let you keep up with all current shows, if you want to, but it lets you clear out your backlog of things you missed too. To be honest, I think in the future people will consider anyone that only watches a couple of shows a season at 1x speed casuals and any serious viewer will be understoond to be watching everything at some accelerated speed.    Where do you think you are anon    you will never finish your backlog    I have a wageslave job, a degree to finish and friends to  play vidya  with. 5 episodes per day is fucking nothing, I watched 20+ when I was an actual shut-in neet.    I know this is bait but I do watch plenty of shows at 2x speed in the boring segments where nothing is happening    This. Also, you can watch multiple things at once. I usually watch two things at the same time (on two screens next to each other), but it's getting boring, I think I'm ready to go up to three.    30 episodes a week is literally less than two hours of anime a day.   fuck you assholes and your unlimited download. I get 30gb a month cellular out here and can't watch more than 20 episodes a month. I wonder if netflix has delicious anime.    20 episodes per week is considered a lot by some newfags  What the fuck has become of this place?      What the fuck，/a/? Might as well just read a wikipedia article instead of watching anything then. Fucking retarded     able to finish a 13 episode series in 1-3 days easily   only watch original works, translations never or adaptations so loose they are considered a different series  At this rate il be done in 2 years.     tfw finally cleared out my downloaded anime backlog   I was pretty excited until I remembered I have my long notepad backlog. Time to download some more, I guess.   Going from capped to unlimited is the greatest thing ever. I absolutely hated having to watch the count every day and be absolutely sure I was going to make it to the end of the month. I'd rather die than go back.         tumblr    A good way to clear your backlog is to just put some anime on in the background for whatever you're doing. You can get the gist of what's happening from the sound anyway.   When I'm really behind, I put it on to play overnight while I sleep. You can learn a lot while you're sleeping, new info gets ingrained in the brain easily. In a sense it's better than watching awake.     Sounds like you don't actually enjoy watching anime.    dozen or so series in backlog   whenever I get time to watch anything I just browse /a/ instead  Send help    Another way is to rip the audio from the episode and listen to it on your ipod while you go about your day  I like to do this while I'm fucking my qt gf     I saved it from here.    using the term "backlog" as some finite amount of titles in one or more HDD's.   That is wrong.    And? It's still tumblr.        tfw have had Shana III on backlog for 3 years    I use term backlog for the shows I have already downloaded. The rest I call watchlist.    no you are unconscious while sleeping. All you are doing is delaying sleep. If you can hear it you are not in REM     I remember when I could blaze through 15 episodes in a day, now I'm lucky if I can finish 3.   No "backlog"   Forever remembering and stumbling over shows I ought to try.   It's a fun life.     Protip: watch the abridged series whenever you can to save time.   how do you even bring yourself to watch 20 episodes per week  There's only around 5 series per season worth watching. Give or take a few depending on your taste, but no one should have such shit taste that they'd watch 20.       you can only watch ongoing anime  Are ya brain damaged?      forgetting that older anime exist   Also, if you can't find more than 5 shows per season worth watching, maybe anime isn't for you. Try .      you're not missing out on anything, just drop it already since you'll have to bring yourself to watch the 1st and 2nd season after this long.    Good idea, will try out.   Thank god I always watch dubs anyway. If I watched subs I wouldn't understand a word with this technique.     One day, one day...  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127199774  Why is she wearing makeup in bed?    you will never start Gintama   I c-can skip it right?    I dont have a backlog. Never have, never will. I just watch series at random old and new     That just means the universe is your backlog, and every star in the sky shines to guide you.    Same but in my case its lack of interest not time and Im lucky If I watch 1 a week    Agreed. You know it's bad when anime is a chore.    Yes.    I spend all day masturbating, browsing this place or looking for new things to masturbate to. Once in a while I try to start an anime but I always get bored fast and drop it  Ive lost control.      This 100%   I average less than an episode a day, it makes me feel awful.  Aren't we all saving it so when/if /a/ dies we all have something to keep us busy and forget the PAIN.    implying  I couldn't live without bullying you, Lelouch     S2 never. Such pretty eyes      At that point why not just read the plot summary for each episode on wikipedia? You could "watch" an entire anime in 10 minutes.  I know it's bait, but some people genuinely do it     If poeple do it, then it's not bait.    It's the same for me as well. It's a sucks when you exhaust all the interesting shows from your backlog and you're just left with things you have to force yourself to watch.    having a backlog   you pick an anime to watch, you watch it then you pick another one.     not having a total of 40 days media to watch in your backlog   not watching 2 cours a day everyday    My backlog is big, but definitely doable. I don't really pick many new shows up each season, like 2 or 3 at most and after having my backlog for years now I almost never find a good old show to add to my backlog I don't already have there.  What gets me is my literature backlog. It's about 600 books or so and given how many good books there are I know no matter what I do I'll never finish it in my lifetime.     test    E- See me after class.     yeah but when you pick one, see another one and also want to watch it, but have to finish the first one first you create a backlog. /a/ has crazy backlogs because they spend more time here than actually watching it.     Reading is for faggots.   Kokoro Connect Lain GTO Digimon Adventure The Girl Who Leapt Through Time Summer Warsa Agent Monster Haibane Renmei Tekhnolyze Aria Nichijou             Fucking touchpad! After Summer wars it should Paranoia Agent.     The language is not relevant.  If you listen to your heart and truly love the series then not understanding any dialogue besides "Baka!" is not a true problem       Relegated Lain to backlog   Not immediate watching  Sort your shit out you pleb      Lain is boring shit anyways     Watching anime    Not being able to piece general conversation and interpersonal terms together, only getting stumped on topical content like the shows focus due to it being specific vernacular that isn't everywhere  Apply yourself      I will, there seems to be a lack of stuff that interests me. I just have to catch up with Gintama and then I can start working on other stuff.  Unless I decide to get into Gundam, I think I should be able to handle it.      1. watching long series leads to a backlog 2. trying to rush through long series doesn't feel fulfilling 3. watching too many episodes consecutively makes you disoriented 4. while watching said series, you find out about another series 5. the cycle repeats         You might have ADD      browsing 4chan   not being able to spot an obviously satirical post      maybe. I can't even read entire threads anymore, sometimes.  what can you do      You're right - because I don't have a backlog.    I know. That's why I deleted it.    I do this with 75% airing shows and I still get behind in some of those.   Am I the only one who randomly starts to re watch shit instead of working on my backlog? Like I could be watching the more than 60 series I have on my list but I am watching kannazuki no miko instead     oh no he is spending 60-90 minutes a day on his hobby   Kill yourself, faggot.       mfw deleting a show from my backlog that I haven't seen to download a show that I'm also not going to see.    I actually finally started watching all the really good shows left in my backlog that I was saving for later and now I just feel empty.  you will never watch Haibane Renmei for the first time again   I kinda wish I stuck to procrastinating on mediocre shows.       why not just read the plot summary for each episode on wikipedia?   Too much effort. You look at the name and maybe 2 screen shots and then pretend to know what it's about.      watching anime   not just coming to /a/ and shitpostif about which grill is best    People still watch anime? My hobby is now /a/   as long as you don't need to pay for anime a backlog is a blessing    summer is only a meme    A backlog that can be finished is not a real backlog.   first 2tb harddrive is full  I feel like I've passed a milestone. Time to buy a new one and fill that, too.    really want to get to Sora no Woto, YuYuYu, Kohaku's route in Tsukihime, Kagetsu Tohya, Melty Blood, and several shows I want to rewatch on my backlog   only watch 1-2 episodes of my backlog per day because I'm extremely lazy     I don't understand how laziness applies to watching anime.  You sit your bloated ass on a chair and stare blankly, listlessly at a computer screen as it vomits colourful lights at you. There is no hobby more passive, no activity less active that watching fucking anime.  Your problem is just your attention span, you ADHD fuck.        Backlog finished   Nothing to do while waiting for Terraria 1.3  True suffering.     Anime is boring when you are a neet    Resisting the temptation to pause the episode and go back to /a/ is too much work for me.    You're forcing yourself to sit through shitty anime. It could be the easiest thing in the world, but that doesn't make it fun. Watching paint dry is just as easy and that's boring as shit.    Terraria   really nigga          You're forcing yourself to sit through shitty anime  Here's the solution; watch good anime. When you;re watching something you don't enjoy, stop and go find something you enjoy instead,  Fuckin' rocket science.        More often than not, an anime will have a boring episode regardless of if you enjoy the majority of it.  You can enjoy Gundam series but good luck trying to convince anyone that there aren't parts that are absolutely dreadful to sit through. Those parts can go on for more than one episode too.      I love SoL and cute girls but its so hard to watch more than one episode a day. I haven't marathoned an anime in so long.      That's why backlogs exists. When you're in the mood to engross yourself in something dull or subdued, watch it. When you're not in the mood for that kind of thing, put it on the backburner until you are.  It's a waste watching something you know you'll love when you're not in the mood to love it. Why is this so complicated for some people? It's a hobby, not a dayjob or a strict schedule.       You do that and then you end up never watching it. I don't want to have a backlog filled with half watched shows.     boring episodes that you will never love   "HURR WHY WOULD YOU WATCH THEM WHEN YOU'RE NOT IN THE MOOD"   even though you'll probably love later episodes that aren't boring shit   try reading next time         1 - 2 hours of shows a day max   "fucking get a social life"  Really? You probably cook that much time whacking off to Bill Maher and Jon Stewart, or watching Sportscenter every night.     My problem is I pick up too many airing shows. Those combined with college means I only have nights to work on my backlog and by then I'm tired. I need to start only picking up shows that really interest me instead of anything and hoping it turns out to be good.   Are you me?      been marathonning all of DB and DBZ for 2 months now   meanwhile backlog growing enormously with no hope of reaching it      watching an episode the day it hairs   pause every few seconds to check the /a/ thread full of other people doing the exact same thing   take screencaps as scenes happen so you can immediately post them   silently curse to yourself when you take too long to reach a certain point and someone gets a screencap before you   ends up taking 2 hours to finish the damn episode  It's like a drug. Watching a show all at once just can't compare with /a/ multitasking         try to burn through backlog by watching 35 episodes a day for a few months straight   finish nearly over 65 series of varying lengths   have a mental breakdown almost exactly a month after starting  Shit sucks man, because there's no other reasonable way of getting through your backlog in a short amount of time. This happened last week to me and I've been taking a break and only catching up to airing shows, but I've already downloaded another 10 or so series in that time. It just keeps growing no matter how hard I try      I need to buy a second monitor. That way I can watch anime  (shit) posting on /a/. The one true anime viewing experience.    Just take it easy, man. When I feel like my HD is starting to get too full I just stop adding more shows to my backlog until I've worked off what I have. I also don't binge-watch unless I'm actually having fun. Sure, I try to watch at least 10 episodes per day, but I have no pangs of guilt if I drop anime completely for one or two weeks to do something completely unrelated.        brehs?     Watching shit just because it's new is retarded.    You don't need a second monitor for anime. In fact, I advice against it. When you have a screen with a good resolution, you can have the right (or left) half for 4chan, and another quarter for your anime without downscaling. The last quarter can be used for torrents and other stuff you've got running in the background. Putting your anime on a second screen increases the distance to the other focus of your attention, which means you lose more time while your eyes are traveling. It doesn't feel like much, but trust me, it is. If your current screen is too small for that, you can buy a new one and set up the old one vertically in order to better read manga.        Finding less than 15% of the currently airing shows worth watching at all means you probably don't like anime as much as you think.    I just finished marathoning all the early UC Gundam stuff few weeks ago, and marathoned Egypt arc last week. So there you go.   I'm only watching Sidonia this season, not even interested in anything else.      Actually it means the person likes anime just as much as they think.  Or is this just some No True Scotsman fallacy you're trying to use here?      Watch out guys, he used the word 'fallacy'. I think that means he won.    No, I've responded to his defensive response. If he'd said "I want to discuss these 5 shows with /a/" or "I'm watching plenty of anime, just not current stuff" then that would have sounded very differently. Instead he just deflected the point.     I can resist the urge to pause and visit /a/, so I'll just put up with it. But I like the idea of using a vertical monitor for manga. I almost never read manga on my computer because I hate having to scroll up or down.     35 episodes a day   That's insane. 15 episodes per day is the max for me, else I'm gonna break my back due to my shitty chair.      That's the point. Ideally, your backlog consists of every anime ever made, sorted by how much you want to watch them.    Where do you think we are?    Get a laptop or tablet so you can watch in bed. I prefer a tablet because I can also use it to watch in the bath, and it's good for reading manga.   I watch every episode of every anime every season because I don't actually have any taste or refinement.   Do you also read every thread on /a/?    Watching in bed is uncomfortable as fuck. Either your neck/back are bent at an uncomfortable angle to see the screen, or you're stuck laying on 1 side for long periods of time. Both suck.    I'm gonna go for tablet because the laptop will just end up overheating on my bed.   What tablet would you recommend?     I skip to the last episode of an anime that I don't plan to finish and consider it watched.   You think so? Last December I watched Mushishi on my tablet in bed and that was a 10/10 experience.    I'm not really an expert. I just use a kindle fire because I got it for free. All I can say is go for a screen at least ten inches.    I sometimes stop watching a show at the 2nd to last episode so I don't have to see it end and. It avoids that empty feeling when you finish a show you love, because you never really finished it, and never had to say goodbye.    You can attach a monitor to your ceiling. Just make sure it's properly fixated and not coming down the moment something lewd happens.    I actually do that quite a bit. It's either I don't wanna see it end or I already know how it will most likely end so I don't see the point in continuing.   The ride never ends.  I lost several tb of backlog when a 3tb drive died recently.  Bios won't even recognize it.     Nightmare fuel.<br/>    I had that happen, although with a much smaller backlog. Now I keep pen and paper and write down every series so I can find them again.    I have a 100/20 connection, I'll live.  The worst part was having to replace the drive with a bigger one. Those 4tb WD blacks are noisy as fuck when doing lots of reads as well.  The 3tb died in seconds a month or two after warranty ended as well. Seagate made in one of those factories that flooded apparently.         Seagate  You deserved it.     Oldest drive I have in my computer is a Seagate that'll most likely outlive me. I've had 2 Seagates and 2 WD blacks that got bought after it and died as well. The whole Seagate vs WD debacle is no more, it's a fucking lottery whether you get a drive that'll live or not.  Oh yeah, that 500gb Seagate that'll outlive me? It's a 7200.11 almost everyone complained about.       Start watching seasonal shows but eventually struggle to keep up with them on a weekly basis   MAL on hold list now has 103 shows there    This thread reminded me, does anyone have the troll "rec" image showing a bunch of fake "anime in anime" like pururin?   I do but I won't share it because you're a faggot.     being this edgy  have fun, kiddo.     I do AND I'm a faggot.    I'll give you this instead.     pootan  Fuck this shit had me in stitches. When the live action movie pulled it out I was dying.      You look at the name and maybe 2 screen shots and then pretend to know what it's about.  Sounds like /a/.     thanks    I had the sense to download this one before, thanks. I think of the other one as a joke, this one's just evil though. I watched Chaos;Head when it was new, and I didn't hate it. That's how I know I have shit taste.        Is the Live Action movie of Cromartie worth watching, if I've seen the anime over and over? I haven't bothered with anything besides the Death Note movies, and I only saw those because they changed quite a bit.    I'd watch the fuck out of Sensei to Ninomiya-kun and Pururin.    Not like your shit taste is worse than mine or the others.    It's basically a 1-1 of the tv series, but in live action. I found it funny because seeing it done with real actors was a novelty and they delivered on the humour perfectly.  Probably one of the better live action adaptations out there      Stop making this post.   I never had a backlog until I started browsing this faggot of a place, I got a backlog spanning all the way back to when haruhi first aired  fuck you /a/ anime has never been the same since then      Anon, he spends less time out of his week watching anime than I do masturbating or browsing 4chan. Hell, I might spend more time than that trying to fall asleep, for all I know.    It's a burden we all must bear, anon. It is our way of life.    why are Yumekui Merry and Queens Blade on the shit list?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127211029 <br/>   Don't respond. Just report. That post is evidently just meant to be a shitpost.      there are people who keep their downloads even when they're not gonna rewatch any of it.      One day someone will make a thread, and I will want to post an image that I have not saved.  When that day comes, I will reach into my archive, open the episode, navigate to the proper time and save that screenshot.  And I will post it.        I will.  One day.  I swear.      I watch 10-18 everyday and I still don't think I'll be out of anime any time soon.    have an anime backlog stretching back to 1992   have a vidya backlog with nearly 200 games   recently made a movie backlog  I can't wait to get fired from this shitty job so I can enjoy myself forever      Why would I?    Because anon told you to?    Be NEET college dropout   Have all the fucking time in the world to watch animu and read VNs   All the time in the world to study Japanese on my own so I can read shit that will never fucking ever get translated   Be at the happiest fucking point of my life   Get kicked out    Forced to find a place and job   Get super fucking depressed and suicidal   Meet suicidal girl online   Keep myself from suicide by focusing on preventing her suicide   She constantly asks me to go out with her and I reject because I don't wanna deal with bullshit and know she's clinging to me in desperation, also she's underage anyway   My depression kicks hard in and I say "yes" to her requests just from the fatigue of cheering her up if I said "no" again being too overwhelming   Expect her to just break up with me within a month or two especially since she's only ever been in online relationships that last that long    After a year she actually moves to my state into my place   Now have to deal with a job, responsibilities of life, and a girlfriend   She lives the NEET life I wish I could live, playing games all day and watching animu   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127198952#p127211920">Click here</a> to view the full text.

It'll build back up, then it'll drop. Such is Arc-V. Hopefully.     you're right, the quality is going up.    Whoa, Yuya's; gonna duel Jack? I need to catch up, only on episode 30 right now. Hope Yuya eventually snaps one day, I swear he's got issues.     Go away Xyz Yusei      This just feels like we're killing time waiting for the friendship cup  It's called world building.     inb4 actual speed spells and speed counters cause tournament     on episode 30 right now    Hope Yuya eventually snaps one day   hehehe       Nah, prison arc is pretty fucking bad.    even the summaries tell of jobbing    not liking ENJOY!     Please That's everything I'm asking for They could have some extra rules for pendulums       SUPIIDO SUPERU - JI ENDO OBU SUTOUMU HATSUDO    Synchro Dimension has the highest QUALITY     How? The Enjoy duel was fucking glorious     I didn't like the prison arc in 5Ds (I dropped the show twice during that fucking prison bit at the beginning) so I'm willing to assume it'll get better when they get out.     ENJOY!    KOI KOI     I enjoyed prison more than seeing that pointless handicapped duel between Shun and Dennis     CHOJIRO CHOJIRO CHOJIRO        He's gonna have his time eventually  r-right?      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6aM<wbr>tT3ha_cU</wbr>  [ ]   DUSTY ROBES      At this point I'm just going to assume that Yugo, Yuzu, and Reiji started a tap-dancing group and are panhandling for change on the streets   counterless speed spell hybrids cause they are monsters? maybe the spell effects just count as monster effects so they cost no counters but can still be targeted as speed spells or whatever. I think it would just be amazing to see Yuya have a real Speed Duel against the king.    5ds prison arc was top tier though  Yusei fucking up the Prison Warden with sleight of hand and trash cards       It was a pointless duel but in the end it was just means for bringing Dennis, Gon and Shun together and setting up Dennis and Shun as opponents for this arc. Dennis is probably gonna all out against Shun and Shun is only hyped up because he's gonna job badly to Bennis, which in turn will hype Bennis up as a real fucking threat. It was obvious it wasn't gonna have a conclusion and at least we got new Raid Raptors and Entermages out of it       SILENT BOOTS     We already know that Yugo and Yuzu are laying low and lurking around somewhere in the slums, though.   It's Reiji who might or might not be up to something       Worldbuilding.   Includes Shun being the new Crow   If they need worldbuilding, they could always do that with Yuya and other characters instead of wanking over how powerful and cool Shun is.       I think the best way to do Speed Counters is to make them generic, to use a Spell Card, they need 2 or 3 counters or something.   So will Selena help Yuya and the Lancers escape, or is she still trying not to drop the soap in Butch Queerio Camp?    Academia uses it too. Dennis used his badge to show that he was an ally of Academy to the Obelisk Force     I want Reiji to have found an old abandoned military silo and hacked into Neo Domino's systems to revenge-keikaku Jean-Michel.     No but they could do stuff like pendulums using up a speed counter when you use them or something.     She'll watch some shit on that tv she has in her room.    Fuck you the last two episodes were great     3 episodes are an arc now?     that could work as a irl mechanic and would work uniform for all decks. I can see that being a thing. Maybe quickplay is 2 and normal 3 or something   Man, Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon would of been an amazing rank 4 if it treason discharge every monster on the opponents field at once, rather than target, especially sense you have to burn it's units for that.   I don't really care that much about a duel having to have a ton of drama/stakes or whatever hinging on it. Just as a duel itself, that 3000 LP handicap just rubbed me the wrong way from the start, and ruined the tension.   How they interact is also not that amusing since Shun can be so dismissive at times, it was just Shun going  bakana, this LDS fake-Xyz user isn't a total scrub!          Nah that would be stupid. The point of speed spells and speed counters is that you have to save up speed counters for the big and powerful spells, while weaker speed spells can be used immediately and most of the time don't even use counters.       Shun wasn't interesting, but Dennis was glorious     It's already a pretty good card.  Pity about that OPT clause so I STILL can't justify running cards like Overlay Regen.     The ENJOY and THE MAN duel was pretty cool.     They could have some extra rules for pendulums  How would they even know that?  Also I don't think they will shill Speed only cards anymore because they can't sell them        Remember the Eita arc? Was my favorite arc.     YES I'M ENTERTAINER     tfw they'll never invade Academia like this     How would they even know that?   Jean      He didn't even need to sleight of hand during that duel He could have just set Blasting the Ruins      I didn't like the prison arc in 5Ds  What the fuck      How about speed  traps       Not him, but I found it boring too.     let's ENJOY    Seems like Serena isn't escaping with Yuya and co. though.  It feels like Jean-Michel will present her as hostage so that the Lancers can't fully escape yet.   Then Reiji proceeds to save Serena while Jean-Michel isn't watching, and Serena will like Reiji from then onwards.          This could work. They'd work like regular traps, but with the necessary speed counters they get additional effects and can be used from the hand or something.  It would allow other dimension people to still use fusion and pendulums and would bring back speed duel rules       Go to bed, Reiji.    SHIBIERU   SPEED CARDS SUCK. THEY ALWAYS SUCKED  anon here who knows nothing about yu gi oh after slifer's first apperance, is 5ds good or should i just watch arc v first    YOLO      It's good. Like really good. Though Arc-V is currently running and you might wanna watch that first so you can shitpost with us.  But Arc-V has a TON of 5D's references so maybe still watch 5D's first       5Ds is okay I guess. Might get disappointed halfway through             IF you want speed spells and speed duels please kindly fuck off back to 5D's, we don't need your shit ruining Arc-V  Let Arc-V focus on its points and elements not shit from a series from 4 years ago               It really annoys me how Shun seems to have forgotten Yuto existed. He never got a straight answer from Yuya about where he got Dark Rebellion     Same director as Arc-V. They're both my favorite YGO series.     I disagree. It was one of those times where a Yugioh series got to show that it can be amusing without having to involve high stakes. Chojiro isn't relevant or anything, but I think he did pretty well for a minor character.    5Ds is the most I have ever cared about the dark underbelly of the children's card game world      kk going to give it a shot       As an anon who currently watches it, I disagree completely. Aside from a bunch of filler episodes that are easily skippable the second half is pretty hype     B-But Riding Duels are boring without them! They're just guys dueling on motorcycles as if that wasn't the fucking appeal in the first place    a man can dream. pls don't bully    I wasn't really invested in the Neo Arc Cradle conflict as I was with the Dark Signers one (might have been cause of the villains though. The three guys are the typical YGO bad guys) though it had it's moments. But the WRGP is complete shit compared to the Fortune Cup. Like it just kept getting worse.    Yuto answered for Yuya as a ghost hallucination instead, because for some reason Yuya and Shun aren't ever allowed to exchange more than 2 sentences with each other.    5D's is pretty good the first season and half of the second season up until we get Blackwings and Crow. After that, a lot of the shit they pull is worthy of a few faces meeting palms without even bothering with the rest of the series where Aki gets side-lined for more BRAKU WINGS and Rura is put into jobber Hell.     It isn't. My fear about 5D's was exactly that. That they were gonna play cardgames on motorcycle with no real justification and just do it because they need a gimmick. But the speed counters made the duels interesting and gave them the uniqueness that they needed to stand out as a seperate kind of dueling.     But the badges are different. If he found it in Heartland, that means that someone from Standard has been to Heartland.    I feel like your enjoyment of the second half of 5Ds banks on how much you enjoy Crash Town and Team Taiyou    He's saving them soon-ish so that could change?    Yeah and most people thought the idea was incredibly fucking stupid when they first heard and saw about it and you still have people saying they dropped Yu-Gi-Oh after motorcycles came into the mix  The actual appeal imo was the new dueling style. Riding on motorcycles while dueling in an entirely different format was cool as fuck. Riding on motorcycles while dueling the regular way is fucking retarded because you might as well just duel while standing up or sitting down.  Now fuck off m8         I never understood why people hype the Dark Signers arc so much. It's a pretty generic arc as far as I'm concerned with your typical shadow game stuff and most of the Dark Signers being pretty forgettable mooks.  Only good memory I have of it is Jack vs Carly       I didn't give a shit about Team Taiyou and actually found most of Crashtown aside from the final duel to be annoying filler and I still enjoyed part 2 of 5D's.    The fuck do you play now Jack  ENJOYYYYYY   Not him, but I didn't bother going past DS mostly because that Godwin shit was stupid and the whole "Actually, nobody died" thing was the last straw. Hell, I was about done with it when Rura got screwed by Crow for his Signer Mark. The other reason was the torrent wasn't finished despite the files and folder being there.    Red Dragons as a archtype?     V-vice dragon archetype maybe?     Red Wyvern Synchro Monster     I don't think Yuya telling Shun that he ate his best friend is a good idea.    Looks like something out of Mukuro's deck tbh.    REDDU VICE DURRAGON     Jack getting an at least somewhat coherent archetype  Crossing my fingers      no Piece Golems  fucking dropped      How did people even like part 1 Rua He was a spoiled little brat who thought he was the toughest guy around and was envious of his sister for being special when he wanted to be special too. He was exactly the kind of kid character I hated the most.  He was lot more sympathetic in part 2 when he's a lot more humble and accepts that he doesn't need to be a super special chosen one to watch over his sister. And his awakening against Aporia is so much better than his awakening against... uh what was that guy's name again, could have ever been         Maybe that's Piece Golem Dragon?    More Archfiend Dragons     He'll get them once he remembers Fusion summoning when he noms his Fusion counterpart     You know he's going to use them as a callback or someone will use them at some point    Dark Signer Arc had the following  Aki development   Yusei development   The emergence of a bretty cool archtype   The possibility of tragedy   Further development for Jack and the rest of Team 5D's   TEAMU SATISFACTION   Actual backstory and an actual excuse for plot power to exist   Villains while one-note and forgettable were actually motivated by their own desires (whatisface from Yusei's past being out for revenge against Yusei because of misunderstandings, Bomber wanting revenge against Godwin for that shit that happened to his village)   Godwin is given some depth and it's revealed that there is a method to his madness   The Dark Signer's weren't huge assholes, just possessed by evil and wearing black spidey suits   Rura does something  Too bad the ending was bullshit                That's just wrong.    It says it's a Synchro Monster and it's called Red Wyvern.  Also, it says there that Jack and Yuya really are having an exhibition match for the Friendship Cup.       He was lot more sympathetic in part 2 when he's a lot more humble and accepts that he doesn't need to be a super special chosen one to watch over his sister.  But he did that in part 1, pretty early on. When he gets wrecked by Divine he starts doubting himself super hard. And he was never jealous of Ruka, he wanted to be the 5th Signer because that was the only way he thought he could be by her side and continue to protect her      taser in duel disk  How does one implant weapons into duel disks?       Exhibition match   so... bets?   I wonder why they make Yuya and Jack duel already when Jack is hyped up as this ultimate duelist nobody in Synchro can surpass. I guess this means Friendship cup won't reach the finale          Why is Sherry so much hotter than Aki     I think we all hated Part 1 Rua because he defined the brat that tries to act tough for his little sister. In the first part he's arrogant and downright annoying, but it's the experiences he has with Yusei and what he goes through pre-Dark Signer and during that arc which made us want him to be a Signer. Hell, Ruka even dropped the biggest hint that he could be a Signer in the near future.   I think what made it all the more annoying during the DS arc was that Crow essentially replaced him as a Signer. Here we had a character that developed from his first appearance all the way up until now when he was perfectly developed and had every reason to become a Signer. Then we had Crow which was essentially Joey 2.0 minus the faces and near-win against the season's big bad. Shades of Jessie from GX, essentially.   Yfw Cyrus should have been the bff to save the day in s4  What could have been        Have you seen how fucking tough and dangerous a trading card is in that world? They already contain weapons     Not him but I found it dull as well. Only good thing to come out of it was Himuro, Yanagi, and Yusei prison raped.    Either Jack wins, or Jack pretty much wins then the duel gets interrupted. I'm leaning towards the latter since they probably dont want Yuya captured again    ENTERTAINMENT     Man Sherry violent just play a cardgame to duke it out sheesh     So how badly is Jack going to stomp the everloving shit out of Yuya?   5D's is the Yu-Gi-Oh no one has gotten over. So don't expect this masterpiece but a fun show that drops in quality for 90 episodes. Though Jack episodes are always fun.    Jean-Michel is probably the one who set up this exhibition match, or at least knows and allowed it, since he's meeting the Lancers on their way out of jail.     Yuya   getting captured again  It's pretty much confirmed at this point that it's Jean-Michel who made Yuya have an exhibition match with Jack.  I doubt he'll be captured again, but rather, he will act as Jean-Michel's chess piece.         Man Sherry violent  Now I want a crossover movie where a ton of Yugiohs get transported to a world without cardgames and have to fist fight their way out  Sherry   Jack   Rank 0-kun   Yuya          Dark Signers. They're basically going to go back and redo all the major arcs from each dimension and shoehorn Yuya in. I fuck with you not.     I'm glad Rua didn't become a Signer. That's exactly what I was expecting when he was first introduced and I hated the thought throughout the entirety of the first part that he'll eventually become a signer because he cries and begs enough for it and gets what he wants just like the spoiled little brat he is. So I was pretty pleasently surprised when Rua had this moment instead   But I'm also one of the few people who don't really mind Crow, I dunno why        Yugo always wanted to duel jack from childhood but can't because the requirements are hard to meet   Yuya duels him just like that   Top kek       You forgot Yusei      I thought we knew about the match.  Jack declares his victory in 3 turns.        Wonder how Yugo and Yuzu will react to seeing Yuya dueling Jack     Why didn't you add the butler? He needs to be there to protect his lady and kick ass.    If anything it's 5D's characters being shoe horned into Arc-V's story you ding dong, did Synchro make you forget which show this is? Whatever the dragons and their highlander rules have to do with the story, it's not like the Crimson Dragon and Immortals are involved.    Yusei'd be fine    But he wasnt crying and begging for it. He had accepted he wasnt a Signer and was just trying to protect his sister like he'd always done, that point would have been the perfect time for it. I enjoyed when he awakened against Aporia, but he didnt get any development there he hadnt already gotten in Part 1     needing 3 turns to beat Yuya   not FTKing him   What a scrub.       No wonder Yugo will go dragons against Yuya even though Yuzu already said he is a friend.   We did know about the Jack vs Yuya, but we were still guessing whether it was an exhibition match or not. Though it was already obvious and agreed upon that it's an exhibition, this summary just confirmed that it is.        Oh I didn't know that That makes it easier. Yuya will survive past turn 3 which will be his "victory" that shocks everyone, but Jack will anways by summoning his Red Demon's dragon       On the other hand, a televised exhibition match will finally let Yuzu and Yugo know he and the Lancers are in Synchro    Pretty sure Jack is going to trash Yuuya.     holy shit, Yuzu, look, I'm dueling against Jack!     But fucking Life stream Dragon and Power Tool being pretty much the same? There was Kizuna with all the Signers under a spotlight (Rua included), Power Tool being sentient, and Rua having some sort of bridge connection with Ruka's abilities. It was planned for Rua to awaken as a Signer but it was pushed back for 143 episodes. Try as you might to justify Crow becoming a signer but you just can't deny the facts that Rua was going to be a Signer.     You want to show people how powerless they are before you to make them go ZETSUBO, not make them be salty about it      Yugo sees Yuya lose to Jack.   tfw he'll never be able to duel Jack because everyone will mistake him with Yuya who lost.   Instead of saying YUUGOU JA NE! anymore, he'll start saying YUUYA JA NE! YUUGO DA!        Of course he was but no matter where he would've awakened he would've been the 6th signer anyway because Godwin still was a signer by the time Rua dueld Demak. And according to Ono the heart mark was reserved for him from the beginning       Wow it took one of you to kill me    Part 2 of 5Ds appeared to borrow the GX Acid Trip drugs considering the EGAO, the Cup Ramen, Jack can't get a regular job for shit, Jack spends then Yen equivalent of $30 on FUCKING COFFEE despite being broke, and Jack spending all of his money to built the bridges between Satellite and Neo Domino which explains why he (and Yusei and Crow) are broke despite Jack being rich in part 1.   Its probably going to be a similar ending to Yuya's first duel with Reiji, except it will be made REALLY obvious that Jack would have won if the duel continued.  Though I think Yuya might be able to deal some damage to Jack like he did with Reiji the first time. So I expect Yuya to get Jack down to about 1500-2000 LP left before Jack makes a comeback and wins, or its interrupted before Jack wins.  Either way, Jean-Michel will probably be really impressive with Yuya's performance even if he loses, allowing him a free entrance to the Friendship Cup.   Reminder that she dropped a man over a building (I think it was episode 93 or 94) and if her butler wasn't there, the man would have died. IIRC, didn't she induce a heart attack on the guy and basically killed him? Its been forever since I saw part 2 5Ds since episodes 65-106 were complete shit.   I assume 3 turns means literally 3 turns (Jack's first turn, Yuya's first turn, Jack wins)... or it means Jack wins on HIS 3rd turn (5th or 6th turn of the actual duel depending on who went first)                 With this reveal, Jack now sports 13 Synchros. Can he win against composite Yusei now? Can he win against Yuya with Master of Pendulum and DOCS cards added into his deck?       Quick! We need more terrible Synchro Monsters who will quickly fade into obscurity.   The only good card Jack ever played was fucking Fiendish Chain.        I really don't see how they can interupt the exhibition match without cancelling the Fortune Cup entirely, unless Jack's D-Wheel crashes again     Nobody "minds" Crow so much as the forcing of his shit on us that happened. He was basically a nobody with a cool deck that happened to have pre-series ties to two of the main characters and one of the villains which was fine. Then, he magically escaped from the Earthbound Immortal shit despite having no special qualities at that point. When he took out a Dark Signer without being touched by the Crimson Dragon, it was pretty much at that point when most of us wanted Konami to stop. That he was shoehorned into that final battle with Godwin was just the beginning of how hard they were pushing him, unfortunately.   Rua didn't cry and beg for his mark. He was with the team from the get-go and only whined about not being special a couple times, both times which someone reminded him that being a Signer wasn't the coolest shit. You also seem to forget that when Divine kidnaps him and Ruka he is willing to put himself at risk for his sister. Sure, he was stupid and brave; but that made him a bit more enduring as a character. Hell, his duel against Bomber showed us he had grown a bit. He was still arrogant and shit, but at least he was also capable of critical thinking to some degree.   Have you forgotten that a lot of the current shenanigans in Synchro have been done before with Yusei and co? Just because it's another series doesn't mean having the characters from it replacing the characters from the preceding series' major arc is any less stupid.    Yusei can kick ass  Yusei confirmed only protag with two Ph.D's. One for dueling, the other for ass-kicking            What is Battle Fader What is Chaos King Archfiend       Well since I knew about Crow before watching 5D's and thus expecting him to be in power trio from the get go I find most of the Crow hate to be pretty elusive. But I get that it's different for people who watched it when the episodes where new and on a weekly basis     Is that the "3 steps ahead" from 5D's? Good that they brought it again.     Forgetting Dragon Ruler Format MVP Crimson Blader      I entirely forgot that this episode existed Or is it the same episode where Jack runs around, gets kidnapped by street thugs and proceeds to beat them all up?      If its on Jack's literal 3rd turn then that's good because we actually get a decently length duel     Have you forgotten that a lot of the current shenanigans in Synchro have been done before with Yusei and co?  Not really, it was mostly just Yusei when 5D's was doing it. The basic format might be similar, but with a pretty big difference in how things actually play out and who's involved with what since the cast is much bigger.  And whatever the point of Friendship Cup is going to be, it's not going to be the same as Fortune Cup since Reiji already did the job of bringing the Lancers together.        I don't see why Arc-V and 5D's shouldn't be directly connected. GX and DM were direct sequels, while 5D's was in a somewhat vague defined future of the two. ZeXal was the odd one out with absolutely no connections to past series at all because BUY XYZ and Arc-V appears to try to fix the fuck up that is ZeXal by explaining how it's existence is agreeable with the rest of the series.  Also a thing I've noticed from the very start is that in Arc-V they use the same duel discs that Yliaster uses and who knows what's up with that         I knew he was going to be in the series ahead of time and it didn't alleviate any of the annoyance I experienced. I had hopes that he would be a side character that appears from time to time up until Dark Signer kicked those hopes around the block.   You have a point. I guess I can only hope we get Rua and Ruka and some Aki shenanigans. Otherwise, Konami has already failed me this arc.      Maybe standard is the original universe all the other Yugiveses broke off from by some unseen force.    It's the one where Jack tries to get a job I think     http://<span>youtu.be/aBd9hpa6Ojs  [ ]     I have a sort of working theory that involves GX shenanigans and works it's way up to the end of Zexal. Basically the 3rd season of GX had the teleport to Monster Dimension shit which in turn lead to Judai becoming the Shadow King. If you remember in DM, the monsters were already more/less developing in their own world, but at a slower rate compared to how the Human Dimension was going along. My thinking is that a combination of continued cross-dimension shenanigans mixed with Pegasus and Kaiba developing the technology that allowed monsters to access the Human Dimension to some degree basically caused them to develop at an accelerated rate and Barian stuff.   I could be completely wrong, though      This track actually hasn't played in a while now that I think about it    I want Selena to ride me       My theory is that the success of Yusei's Fortune System that prevented the Meklord apocalypse allowed the discovery of Xyz and Pendulum summoning which in turn caused a new Yliaster to back in time back to GX era and use some dimension fusion shenanigans but in reverse to split the dimensions by summoning methods because it was too dangerous too keep them all in one dimension.  Also something something Yuya and Yuzu reincarnation.  And Arc-V takes place in those some years after the altered GX timeline which coincides to be a parallel of the 5D's timeline, which is why we get 5D's characters now and Leo is in Fusion dimension because it's the dimension fusion stuff from GX that can reunite the worlds again.  And ZeXal is some sort of prequel to current Xyz dimension I dunno.        YAMEROOOOO       No.    What does that expression tries to convey?    I want to brush his eyebrows.     Chaos King Archfiend has always been terrible.     I want to shave them off     4 years ago  Anon, 5Ds started in 2008, that was 7 years ago.     Zexal actually ends with Yuma deciding to turn back the clock a few thousand or so years to prevent the Barian invasion and things from getting as bad as they did. My thinking is that GX seen a Human pushing monster's to develop to the equivalent of a medieval period and Cyrus's wish was more/less meant to alleviate the damage done. In 5D's we see Momentum basically caused the re-awakening of both the Crimson Dragon and his enemy which caused the 5 dragons to re-awaken and fight the Dark Signer's again. Basically, the monster world at this point has entered a state of independent development and unwritten cooperation with their Human world "partners". The first Momentum experiment fucked things hugely and allowed a more active connection to both worlds.  I guess you could say the Barian are the monsters developed past the Human's due to constant dimension-crossing hijinks and because Kaiba and Pegasus gave the world card games. Also, apparently Kaiba starts a war.      Its playable in DDDs because its a lvl 7 fiend that can help push for massive damage    Despair but also Yuzu.    I'd play it in my Pendulum Magicians if it were a dragon    It ended 4 years ago.    It's still a series from 7 years ago.       i just want to hug him      There will never be Yuya and Yuzu figmas    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184901   Do you measure how old a series is based on when it starts or when it ends?     SAUCE    Don't do that.   Where is Yusei?     You mean Crow's taller friend with spiky hair and a lot of blue in his design?  He's been there the entire time.       His ace is a WIND Dragon-type Synchro Monster with 2500 ATK, 2000 DEF, has an effect that focuses on negation, and is a plot relevant card.   His less important Synchros are Machine-type monsters, or just monsters that look like machines but actually aren't.   He has a lewd waifu who, depending on your opinion, may be best girl.   He enters a tournament ran by an really influential individual who is most-definitely-not-a -villain.   Wants to duel Jack.   Has no social skills whatsoever.   Hasn't lost an on-screen duel yet that wasn't a flashback.   Anon, Yusei has always been here and showed off his impressive cardgame skills in front of Yuzu recently.  I was actually taking about Yugo, but it shows how similar Yusei and Yugo are in some ways.              His less important Synchros are Machine-type monsters, or just monsters that look like machines but actually aren't.  All of them were Machines and Yusei mostly used Warriors     you're thinking of yuto    But anon, Yugo has a personality and acknowledges crushes    Why is Yuri so sexual?     &gt;He has a lewd waifu who, depending on your opinion, may be best girl.   Thats right, Rin is best Ruri      Too many facial expressions to be Yusei.    It's the eyebrows.     He has a lewd waifu who, depending on your opinion, may be best girl.   I thought Yuzu was Yuyas waifu        what is their expressions trying to convey    Well, Yusei didn't have a loved childhood idol to leap for   C A R D I A N S A R D I A N S          No fucking way    Cardian, when the words Guardian and Cardigan are just too confusing so you just merge the words together. ;)     go to animu streaming site   &gt;WHERES YUSEI??   &gt;WHERES YUSEI??   &gt;WHERES YUSEI??   ayy        i thought this yugioh was supposed to be the straightest one     go to animu streaming site   &gt;WHERE'S YUSEI??  Did you expect different?      That's Zexal mate, the gayest one  beyond the gay.wav      Anon...    I think you mixed Zexal and Arc-V up.    Of course it is.      you will never be as cute as III      its just an anime screenshot, don't get you panties in a bunch.    just googled it i guess the only way to follow up card games on motorcycles is card games in space      not card games on rollercoasters  C'mon son     They didn't even spend that much time in space. It was more like weird alien versions of heaven and hell where it's 'heaven' that's a hellhole   Sawatari is totally winning next match, isn't he?    filename  That's not Yuri.     But he is not even pic related    I still  ENJOY  it.     tfw i started watching for yuya      tfw I still do that    /a/ time to post super situational cards     &gt;The Supreme King Black Dragon, Odd Eyes Rebellion Dragon generated a shit load of xyz energy and black waves,thunder and lighting.    &gt;The combination of Clear Wing Synchro Dragon and Odd Eyes Pendulum Dragon will generate a blinding shining light on par with what Shooting Star Dragon created when it first appeared.    You heard it hear first,anons. I want you to remember that.      DARK REBELLION WHEN YUTO COMING BACK WHEN BANANAMAN GETTING BTFO WHEEEEN      &gt;Angry flat-chested Tsundere   People actually like this piece of shit character?      Just because they're smaller than Serena and Rin's doesn't mean she's flat.     is exactly the perfect woman except they ran out of x chromosomes so the had to us a y    How would you all feel if there's a timeskip and Mieru returns looking a little taller and like Rei in GX?   Mierufag please go    yuzu's theme    Is extremely long and boring while Gongenzaka's and Yuya's get straight to the point. It's weird, it's like a build up to something but peters out .    reiji has FIVE   FUCKING 5   theme songs now  I don't understand      I finally caught up with Arc-V  Is fusion world supposed to be Original+Gx's world, synchro world supposed to be 5Ds' world, and Xyz world supposed to be Zexal's world?  Or are these just completely alt universes? I assumed it was just alt universe stuff until characters that were actually from 5Ds started showing up.  Also is it worth watching 5Ds and Zexal? I tried to watch the first episode of Zexal years ago but it just looked like an abomination to me at the time.          Yes, but they are alternate versions. Ignore fan-theory, we don't know why they're alternate versions.  5D's up to before the WRGP is good to watch, ZEXAL is do not watch.       ZEXAL is do not watch.  What makes it so bad out of curiosity.    D/D/D vs Odd-Eyes duels are helluva fun to play for both sides, and can swing (hue) back and forth constantly.  Stupid Yuya topdecking OErymezation and enduring three turns with 400 LP. Now I know to aim for their field spell sooner before.     I like how her whole motivation was getting stronger to help protect the people she cares about, like Yuya, and then never actually does that. Meanwhile, Gon has done nothing but that.    The people that say "Do not watch Zexal" are the ones that never started/finished it.   Go take a hike.      1) Story constructed by Yoshida; 2) Characters shafted by Kuwabara; 3) Horrible characterization and predictable development; 4) Repetitive, obvious duels; 5) Unnecessary first half with ridiculous second half; 6) Inability to juggle large cast of characters; 7) Requires fanservice to stay afloat; 8) III is a boy.  Noh Gil-bo is a god, though. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ut0<wbr>9IJg4P9I</wbr>  [ ]   Fuck off lolicon.                  Fuck off lolicon.  Huh?     5Ds is really good then gets ok Zexal is garbage then gets meh     Mainly the protgonist being kinda retarded, him not using any of his evergrowing ED toolbox except for his ace and derivatives (think Ash still catching pokemon every other episode but only using Pikachu, Megapikachu, Raychu and Megaraychu), and very shittyly shallow side characters.  There's the what-to-skip chart, but I would't stop you from watching it whole over summer though, if you have time. The antagonists in S2 come to save the show and it's fun to see their stupdly powerful anime cards.      Nigga I watched through that entire shitshow because of people like you that says it gets really good It fucking doesn't, the entire first half is irredeemable garbage, while the second half is still bad, but Vector, Kaito, and Shark get pretty cool after like 50 episodes of fucking nothing happening     Man, Noh doesn't do nearly as much AD work on Arc-V as he used to with Zexal. He's still around, but he went back to being mostly a regular key animator instead of staying on as an animation director for whatever reason.    Always been wanting to try out D/D/Ds. Mind posting your build?    Man, I wish someone did an edited version of Zexal 1 that only contained the duels.    Holy shit, does he work for Arc-V too?    Degenerate build is the only one that works. Will update later with Swiral Slime.     Fuck off lolicon.  You have autism or something?     Nah, but Yuma does.     Fuck off lolicon.  pfftt haha oh wow     maybe stygian sergeants will see play again. otk potential.   TCG High Speed Riders will have 60 cards. What bonkerass reason does Tewart have for me still not being about to create a new power that will rend the darkness?    upstarts instead of chicken race  It's like you don't want to burn yourself to victory.     Mizael worst barian, etc., but that TIME TYRANTO    I don't like giving my opponent cards. Also it prevents life gain from Lilith.   Why is everyone in this series fucking blind?    "OH ITS YUYA/YUZU"   Its a character that looks nothing like them, and has completely different hair and outfit  I couldn't even tell Yugo was supposed to be an alt version of Yuya until Yuya freaked the fuck out about them having the same face.  Literally the only person who has an excuse to be confused about the sameface shit is Yugo thinking Yuto kidnapped Rin, and thats only because Yuri was wearing a hood at the time.  It was doubly stupid that people feel for Selena and Yuzu being the same person JUST because they changed outfits. Come the fuck on, they couldn't even change hair styles?  All of that being said  Rin is the best Yuzu.             Can we agree that Yuya's whore of a mother is a miracle of the universe?   Some people chose to believe that their hairstyles are only seen by us, the viewers, and that in universe they're strikingly similar, anyone have that pic of all the Yu's with black hair and normal hairstyles?   Which Arc-V is the best genderbent?     You should first train and learn how they all work with a stapleless build like this, then you can keep the things you like and replace the rest with the usual bunch.  They have even more diversity than Nekroz, despite the lower searching power.      Yu ri       And here's where I forget to post the image.          I'd a Yuri            you should specify if this is a chevalier otk or not, might trip some people up.            It makes me think how people can't tell Shadow and Silver apart from Sonic.   Some people chose to believe that their hairstyles are only seen by us  Bullshit       But that's how it's most likely intended to be, considering even Reiji has to tell Yuzu and Serena apart by their movements.    Maybe because EVERYONE is an idiot    Or, the hairstyles and colors are just for our sake. I don't understand why this is so hard for you to comprehend unless you have to feel superior to a bunch of fictional characters for some reason.    But they can see the hair color?    That's pointing out Sawatari, not Serena.    yuya best girl /boy     So they're colorblind to only the Yu's and Yuzu clones' hair?    Considering they're the only ones with counterparts, that should be incredibly obvious.     man  Sawatari confirmed for not a little itty-bitty baby boy.     Still hilarious that the magazine preview for this week doesn't even try to hide that he gets wrecked.     Considering they're the only ones with counterparts  You don't know that.     What is up with mooks in Arc-V being competent?    They didn't hide the fact Yuya is losing to Jack in 3 turns too. They just don't care anymore.    Man, it's no wonder you need to feel superior to a bunch of fictional characters, if you're this dumb.    Even they know the current arc sucks.    That only says he declares his victory in 3 turns. It should be obvious that it somehow doesn't work, forcing Jack to pull out Scar-right.    What the flying fuck are you talking about?    Unless you're a different anon, I can't make it any more clear to you.    I'm a different person. All I stated was you don't know if Yuyas and Yuzus are the only set of clones in Arc-V.   Reminder that Yuya is going to be meta and use Swaying Gaze after getting hit with 2500 damage from Scarright, only for Jack to finish the duel with Crimson Fire and then Speed World's burn effect.   Then you should have stated that you weren't the same guy. But it's still incredibly obvious that they're the only ones, and saying "you don't know" without providing any evidence to the contrary is stupid.    Well, Sawatari did have a Xyz clone ;)    Ebin.   I may not win duels, but I'll win the Serena bowl, she'll shyly duel for me instead.   There's no evidence to support that those 8 are the only sets of clones in the first place. For all you know Shun could have clones somewhere.    Shun is basically Reiji's clone. I remember when Shun first appeared everyone was calling him Edgji.    Except there is, considering we already know about all of the Yuya and Yuzu clones, and there has been ZERO evidence to suggest that anyone else has counterparts, and the plot is centered around those 8. Remember when people thought Shun and Reiji were counterparts? That's the kind of stupidity we're talking here.   They're connected by the color name thing and being the "rival" of the Yuya, and nothing more.       They looked pretty similar.   How the fuck does Sawatari keep winning these duels? Literally has never lost a duel in the entire series.    They do, but with Yuya / Yuzu clones people immediately thought they were a doppelganger. No one has made that mistake with Shun and Reiji.     Considering they're connected to Sora by the color name thing too, it should be pretty obvious that they aren't counterparts unless Reiji and Yuzu suddenly get revealed as siblings.   I don't see why people are pointing how Sawatari is losing duels. Yuya has been getting pushed quite severely too outside of the Cardians duel, so it's not like Synchro are a bunch of pushovers clearly, unless they're dueling Serena, Yugo, or Shun it seems.   God damn Reiji is hot without his glasses.     Considering they're connected to Sora by the color name thing too   So who's the synchro version of them?      He's the designated chew toy and it's funny that he exists just to lose.   Not introduced yet/doesn't exist. They're not counterparts like the Yuyas or Yuzus so it doesn't have to go all the way.        Serena has fought 12 duelists so far (not including the 3 from her flashback) and hasn't lost a duel   Is she the greatest female duelist in the world?      Probably removed due to Jack and Crow returning.    If I had to guess, some are annoyed that Sawatari has yet to actually win a duel, besides his lackey and obelisk force which wasn't really his win.     He's the designated chew toy and it's funny that he exists just to lose.   No it's sad, considering he should have improved and had more character growth after his Yuya #2 duel. But instead lets just have him lose duels to get comedic relief instead of playing off the other characters.   That's good right?!   BRILLIANT! Have him lose the next 15 duels, and Shun to fly in to save the day, in fact, lets make Yuya struggle as well!            we already know about all of the Yuya and Yuzu clones  Nobody knows Ruri's story, nor Rin's.   ZERO evidence to suggest that anyone else has counterparts  Reiji's father was the first one to discover and travel across dimensions, and if the Yuyas/Yuzus are cloned there has to be an experiment one or a test subject.   the plot is centered around those 8  It's season one.          implying ultimate jihad could have taken place without Sawatari's Pendulums  OH YES      Jack is the counterpart. Sora is apparently the strongest Obelisk Blue, he's the Kingu of Fusion. Jack is the Kingu of Synchro.   I mean you can't see a grown up Sora looking like Jack, all manly and shit sucking on his lollipop?       Hey, I'm doing shit son.    I still want a time-skip where Shiberu has become jacked as fuck and uses a real Dinosaur deck.    Did he even do anything besides run around screaming about rules?     Shiberu grows up and becomes Tyranno   Good, it means him and his dumb shiberu faggotry will go to the wayside.       Nobody knows Ruri's story, nor Rin's.  We know who they are, their backstory doesn't matter.  and if the Yuyas/Yuzus are cloned there has to be an experiment one or a test subject.   I don't know where you got the idea that they're simply clones, but this would more likely be the "original" Yuya and Yuzu. Still not evidence that ANYONE ELSE has counterparts. Show somewhere, in the show, that suggests that someone else has counterparts.  It's season one.  And the Yuya/Yuzu plot is clearly going throughout the entire show.         You'll get DINO DNA instead     And the Yuya/Yuzu plot is clearly going throughout the entire show.   No way in hell it's going to go through the entire show. It'll go as far as the Fusion Arc and Leo being defeated and that's it. Sure the dopplegangers will stick around, but that's it.   They wont continue it beyond that.        They brought him back to appease his fans but clearly don't want to do anything with him. Sorry you expected him to be something more when he clearly wasn't going to be.    Yes way in hell, considering they haven't even gone into the mythology behind them yet and we're almost halfway through the show. Leo gets defeated, and then the "bigger threat" involves whatever's truly behind the whole Yuya/Yuzu business. This isn't like 5D's or Zexal where there's a clear divide between the two halves of the show, this is clearly meant to go throughout the entire thing.   Maiami Arc -&gt; Invasion Arc -&gt; Synchro Arc -&gt; Escape Arc -&gt; Return to Heartland Arc -&gt; Academia Arc -&gt; End of Evangelion / Defeat Yusho Arc   That's not appeasing fans, that's just blatant stupidity on their part to just have him be there and nothing more. If they really wanted to appease the fans they'd have him do something.   Besides, he's been around since the start basically, it's quite clear it was their intention to keep him around for later and has nothing to do with fans. This is just a problem with YGO, certain characters get pushed to the wayside regardless of popularity and how they are written at one point or might get some character growth.   At this point I really don't expect anybody but Yuya, Shun, and Reiji to do anything at all anymore honestly. I'm honestly getting sick of how hard they're pushing Shun.        Don't panic, they're setting up Shun so that eventually when he tries to RR OTK, he'll get countered so fucking hard by Yuri it knocks him into a new dimension.     their backstory doesn't matter  huh?     The only people that are going to matter in the end are Yuya and Yuzu if you're going to go that far. Sounds like you're just butthurt that your favorite character loses all the time.    Actually we only have two seasons right now, and most YGO series last to about 140-180 episodes. We still got a rider ahead of us. With the exception of DM which lasted 225 or so.    It doesn't, the fact that they exist as Yuzu's counterparts is the thing that matters.    No my favorite character hasn't lost once. Sorry for expecting some good writing and hopeful duels out of some characters that need it.   Oh I know he will.      The staff has already stated that the show is divided into 3 parts, and we're in part 2 right now, so that anon that says "It's season 1" is objectively wrong. Part 2 will probably end with Leo's defeat, and then go into the mythology behind whatever's up with Yuya and Yuzu and Dragons in part 3.    what else do you think komoney can talk about or waste episode time on. you cant be serious.    I highly doubt the other yuyas and yuzus will get to be returned by the end of the series, especially if their existence is as anomalous as the splitting of the original dimension.    But Sawatari isn't meant as anything but a joke, just look at his reappearance in the Battle Royal.    Sawatari was never meant to be anything more than a comedy character. If you expected something else, that's your problem not the writers'.    Of course they're going to go into their back story, no fucking shit, but it doesn't matter to the fact that they exist as Yuya and Yuzu's counterparts.    This, expect about 49-50 episodes per season and they said 3 seasons.   Season 1: Ep. 1-49 Season 2: Ep. 50-64 (as of right now) likely Season 2 will end at around 100.  Season 3: Likely 101-145/150 (about the same length as 5Ds/Zexal)       At least Sawatari beaten his jobbing lackey and obelisk force with the help of others This guy has never won at all.   KoA strikes again, say hello to "Hi-Speedroid" monsters   http://ygorganization.com/tcg-high<wbr>-speed-riders/</wbr>  We're never gonna get DD, are we?       Not one thing suggested he'd be a comedy character before the Synchro Arc. In fact he was rather serious outside of him hyping himself up. His character while in Synchro has been pretty much a joke though.      Not one thing suggested he'd be a comedy character before the Synchro Arc.     Eh, Hyperspeedroids sounded cooler    They'll stick around. How many characters (that aren't villains) in all the series can you honestly name that have just straight up stopped existing/died? Maybe 1, maybe 2?   So have we got to the Post Ep. 64 5Ds of Arc-V now thanks to Sawatari?   No, one character that was always a joke continuing to be a joke doesn't mean anything.    Which is why I find it weird that KoA went with "Hi-Speed"     said character has now split the thread into arguments over whether he's a joke or not   people are starting to get fed up with it   More Shun and RR pushing   I've seen you niggers argue for 2-3 threads now on top of the constant Synchro Dimension is really lacking and starting to get dull arguments. It's quite clear it's starting to fade just like 5Ds did.        It's one anon complaining about it and a couple of other anons saying he's stupid. That's hardly the entire thread split on it.    No, I've paid attention to it. It's multiple people on both sides. Besides I'd have to agree, Synchro has been boring as shit considering it just came off the end of the Tournament. If the Jack duel doesn't save it, I don't think anything is going to unless they jump straight to Fusion.     one anon complaining about Sawatari being a joke when he always was outside of his rematch with Yuya   most people are agreeing that the most recent episode was actually pretty nice  It's not "fading" at all, we're in a period after the climax of part 1 where things have cooled down, but they seem to be picking back up again with the Jack duel. Man, I'd hate to have seen you fuckers back during shit like the Quiz duel or some of the earlier episodes.      Qualification arc had Yuto mystery stuff which gave a lot of hype/speculation.   Synchro arc doesn't have anything like that though its better than Michio/Eita duel.      It's a synchro, what we need is good coherent main deck monsters. I don't wanna see Vice Dragon and Dark Resonator again     List of King of Games   Yugi/Atem   Yugi loses to Rebecca (He may have let her win but a loss is a loss)   Rebecca loses to Valon   Valon loses to Jonouchi   Jonuchi loses to Mai   Mai ends up as King of Games at the end   Jack wins King of Games   Jack loses to Yusei   Yusei becomes Jesus and never loses   Yusei is still King of Games   Brilliant.               More like Jack inherited the title.     No way in hell it's going to go through the entire show  At this point in the show, pretty much every other series was finishing or had finished their first arc and moving on to a new bad guy.  I think its very clear at this point the current plot is going to be the whole plot       Well 5Ds is a good 20-30 years after DM, so chances are he won it from someone else, or as Arc-V is pushing he won it in the Fortune/Friendship Cup.     In fact he was rather serious outside of him hyping himself up.  When has Sawatari ever been serious?  Wasn't half his gone time because he was pretending he was more hurt than he was in the hospital?       Card games are serious business man, they can hurt you.    The Yuya/Yuzu stuff, at the least is going to take the whole plot, similar to how DM had the whole finding out about the spirit of the Puzzle took the entirety of DM.   So what are the chances we see other main characters outside of DM in the new movie? I'm guessing zero.   I'm pretty sure Academia is going to be the main bad guy for the whole series too. At least until the last 10 episodes when the actual cosmic bad guy comes out    Not that guy, but the Yuya/Yuzu plot is objectively speaking the entire plot. Without them there wouldn't be a plot.    Raphael then beat Mai then Atem beat Raphael. Yugi still King of Games.    Well yes, that's my point. Academia/Leo? Probably done at the end of part 2, at which point the last 40-50 episodes will cover the "bigger threat."    Hopefully 0. The movie is looking more and more like it will either be a gigantic retcon, or it takes place a year or so after the Millennium World arc. Somehow or another they will have to showcase Azure-Eyes, Black Demon, and Ebon Illusion.    What's the point though? They're just Yuya and Yuzu, grown up through different circumstances. While we're on that topic, its highly unlikely that there wouldn't be four dimensions left at the end either.    I thought Mai losing to Rafael happened after Atem beats him?   Either way, we had Mai has the King of Games for at least a little bit and Rebecca.      Unless we stay in Synchro arc for as long as we were in Standard with Academia being the last arc    They're not Yuya and Yuzu though. They're completely different characters, the entire show has made that a point, that just because they have the same face, they're different people completely, that makes them different characters, their own characters. They wont just can them permanently. But yes, in all likelihood there will be one dimension again. Doesn't mean all the characters will mysteriously vanish.    They're still their own characters, you can't just take say Serena, and go "hey Serena, you've finally found a place you belong and a cause worth fighting for! Now enjoy being eaten by Yuzu!"    What's the 5th? I count only 4.    1) DDD 2) Reiji's Desire 3) Immense Power 4) The Warrior's Trump Card 5) The Truth is Revealed        Thanks, I missed the truth is revealed    With and without his glasses he still looks pretty good. To bad the glasses are a key part of his design.    What about Reira? :D     inb4 Speed Spell   Rank-Up-Magic: EGAO Force    The academia arc is gonna be such a climax. Do you think they'll bring back some GX characters    more themes than duels     If anybody comes around it'll be Zane or Judai as the Supreme King as the one behind everything, he did deal with Dimension shenanigans.     Do you think they'll bring back some GX characters  They need to shill Red-Eyes and Cyber Dragons.That almost confirms Fubuki and Kaiser.  Johan is another possibility, considering that Crystal Beast Pendulums is a thing. Maybe he will be one of Top 3 at Academia with retrained Hamon.  No hope for Edo. ;(         They need to shill Red-Eyes and Cyber Dragons.That almost confirms Fubuki and Kaiser.  Not really, that's like saying Shaddolls existing confirms that Sora will change his deck. The Red-Eyes and Cyber Dragon support will be old enough by the time they get to Academia that it isn't worth shilling in the show. Also Infinity is an exclusive, which they never use in the anime. Not every card gets "shilled" in the anime.     Both. It's been 7 since it began and 4 since it ended.    Edo gonna come back and use V-HEROs    Because he lost his inner D?    He should return     They need to shill Red-Eyes and Cyber Dragons.  Why?     http://exhentai.org/g/766492/3a1a29<wbr>108d/</wbr>         Yeah but check these 4s<br/>       Come back after you'll get three 4 yourself.  But actually I is 1 and V is 5, and you got two fours in between. Most impressive.         20:00:00    EN   JOYYYY!   Last set Konami gave a bunch of support to Red-Eyes. Next set, Konami will make Black Luster Soldier and Gaia Knight Force of Earth into archetypes, and for some reason combined the two. What nostalgic theme will get support next?     Insects and Dino's    Perfectly Ultimate Great Moth  ;^)       Not used by a main character  You'll get a Kuriboh archetype and you will like it       and for some reason combined the two  Its because Yugi summoned Ritual BLS by tributing Gaia     fuck off Tewart    Its probably Kaiba's turn next time. New XYZ Dragon Cannon then.    mfw watching Season 3 of GX   Fucking hell this shit is awesome  The extreme lack of filler episodes is what is really keeping hype. Everyone fucking destroying these zombies is cool too   Zombie Professor Ayakawa trying to do special surgery on Judai and Johan   O-Oh           Supreme King soon    I've never actually watched GX fully  I just jumped on the bandwagon of calling it shit  but I recently downloaded the Fansubs torrent and this shit is baller  I do think however that Johan and his little international crew is stealing the spotlight from Judai's friends       stealing the spotlight from Judai's friends  That was one of the things that made season 3 less trash.     Candidates  Make Kuriboh (Kurib-) a real archetype   Magnet Warriors   Buster Blader   XYZ Dragon Cannon  I just realized that almost no DM characters actually used archetypes (mosters with same word in name), making it very hard to do nostalgia support.          Johan and his little international crew is stealing the spotlight from Judai's friends  That's a good thing since all of them were massively better characters and were actually at Jaden's skill level so they were more fun to watch     Landstar.     Buster Blader  Make buster blader monsters that support buster and DM      all of them were massively better characters  Amon was shit and there was Manjoume and Fubuki.  Also Misawa.      Landstar isn't "iconic" enough for Konami to use up 7 set slots on it. It doesn't look "cool" and therefore kids who didn't watch DM won't care for it either.    IF he's at the zombie part, Fubuki, Edo, and Kaiser don't appear yet    I see XYZ getting an Xyz. There were also used in DM and GX like Red Eyes.    However I do like O'Brien and Jim. I get a chuckle out whenever Jim speaks English and O'Brien is just a badass    Them and Johan are Judai's only true friends.     I see XYZ getting an Xyz   yfw it will get Double Tuning instead       Guy who talks to animals   Guy who talks to a crocodile on his back   Guy who thinks he's still in war    true friends to a guy who talks to monsters in his head   GX was the best saga only because it pulled the craziest shit and made it work           Silent Magician and Silent Swordsman.
