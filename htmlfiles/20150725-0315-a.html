[ Was this the worst writing that Oda could pull for Sabo? Be honest /a/.  It can always be worse.  <br>To be honest he already has, both him and Ace never felt like actual characters at least to me personally.</br>  Who was Mr 9? Did he ever reappear in a cover story or something? He semeed like he was a good friend of Vivi.    <br>Let's talk about some of the best writing<br><br>For whoever hasn't read it yet: this recent article on the OnePiecePodcast website is probably the closest to the true underlying story of the series than anything else<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/07/<wbr>22/the-one-piece-connection/<br><br>Long as fuck but worth the read. Covers the Will of D, the voice of all things, the moon, the Void Century, the ancient weapons and a few other things</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only there was some kind of wiki or search engine to find out such details.</br>  <br>Oh right fuck I forgot that was him. I only remembered Miss Monday appearing on a cover.</br>  <br>we already had this thread yesterday</br>  <br>Its completely fine and I don't see what the problem is</br>  <br>Yeah, like the 4chan One Piece thread where most people have very good knowledge of the series and it could even spark an interesting or fun discussion.</br>  <br>I need REVEALS already.</br>  <br>What are the probable better excuses beside amnesia?</br>  <br>this was a really good summary and speculation tbh</br>  <br>No, it actually was the best option, everything else would have caused too many plotholes for Oda to ever fill. And it is not even bad writing, it is just pretty cliched.</br>   anon   <br>Amnesia is always worst plot device but considering Oda used it for the first time in 800 chaptes I'm okay with it. <br>I would have like it better had Sabo been on a secret mission somewhere, isolated from everything, far away from marineford and with no access to any news whatsoever. But this works too.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=p98<wbr>Wp2wZEnw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No. It was the best option for the situation. Negated possible plotholes. Blah blah blah, we already had this thread pretty recently faggot.</br>  <br>Trusting in Ace like Luffy did back at thriller bark while going on a important mission for the revs OR being completly rekt after a mission and even having scars from it during the entire ompel down/marineford chaos.<br><br><br> And it is not even bad writing <br>It's literally hurr durr amnesia for no particular reason besides filling the plot hole of not helping ace</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really don't see what the problem is with the old "character shows up who is a close friend to but didn't have any connection with the main character so far in the series and just happens to have had amnesia so that he did not appear in the plot at any other point where it would make sense" plot?<br>Is that not a bit too convenient for you? For someone like Oda who foreshadows like hell, this is pretty weak.<br><br><br>He was injured badly doing revolutionary stuff so he could not come to help Ace.<br><br>Don't really have an explanation why he wouldn't contact Luffy and Ace though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> considering Oda used it for the first time in 800 chaptes I'm okay with it <br>This is why I'm also okay with it. As long as it is kept to this singular incident, I'm cool.</br></br>  <br><br>I think you might be surprised with what we already know and have been told without realising it.<br><br>I still think one of the greatest hints of the series is on Volume 27's cover. It's Oda all over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Certainly. Such a small and seemingly miniscule change in Luffy's design but possibly explaining one of, if not THE, biggest mystery in OP.</br>  <br> Gedatsu vs. Senor Pink never <br>There is no god</br></br>  <br> It's literally hurr durr amnesia for no particular reason besides filling the plot hole of not helping ace <br>that does not make it bad writing. it would have been bad writing if it would have caused more plot holes or if it would not make any sense.</br></br>  <br>That reason and the whole sakazuki thing makes it not bother me.</br>  <br>I just read through the whole article.<br><br>Seems legit. I think the biggest problem I'm finding here is absolutely no explanation of the Devil Fruits. Not even a hand-wavy explanation. They're obviously important to the series, and are as big a mystery to the characters in the series as they are to the reader.<br><br>Also, there's a lot of baseless speculation like "All of these races came from the moons". While it's a nice theory, it really has fuck-all backing it up. Some pictures of moons in no way indicate that dwarves/giants/longecks/longarms/mi<wbr>nks/etc. came from various moons. That's a crazy stretch to make.<br><br>It's really clever, though. I liked it. I really enjoy the fan theories. One Piece is an impressively large world that has really rich lore. Oda really fucking knows how to do worldbuilding.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for someone like Oda who foreshadows like hell, this is pretty weak. <br>D: Hello Oda Sensei! Is it possible that in volume 58, chapter 558, on the 3rd box of the 11th page, I see the 3rd person (Sabo)'s cup? P.N. Saitouryu<br><br>O:Wow- again, looking at those teeny parts. The answer is easy, if you read chapter 585 in this volume, you'll see the same scene and you'll be able to tell it's Sabo's cup, but at the time in chapter 558, "Brothers", if I revealed Sabo, things would get complicated, so I secretly drew it. Still, from back then, there were many readers pointing out "what is this", and I seriously freaked out. What in the world are you people!! You're correct!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's convenient writing which makes it so bad as there was no reason for this cliche to show up for such an important character</br>  <br>That's not what bad writing means.</br>  <br> convinient writing in a battle manga for kids <br>oh god help us</br></br>  <br> 558 <br> 585 <br> foreshadowing 27 chapters is amazing xD <br>No</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda foreshadowed Sabo since Alabasta.</br>  <br><br>Maybe you didn't realise it yet, but One Piece is one of the best or even the best battle shounen out there. You expect better things for it than you would for shit series like Fairy Tail.</br></br>  <br>Yes, as you just showed, he is good at foreshadowing. So why did he have to give Sabo amnesia rather than, well, giving him a good and plot-relevant reason why he couldn't show up?</br>  <br> implying Odas writing never was convinient at any point before  <br>are you deluded or something?</br></br>  <br>Yes. And amnesia is a really weak excuse, especially for Oda who, as you pointed out yet again, is pretty good at foreshadowing.</br>  <br> Seems legit. I think the biggest problem I'm finding here is absolutely no explanation of the Devil Fruits. Not even a hand-wavy explanation. They're obviously important to the series, and are as big a mystery to the characters in the series as they are to the reader. <br>I think it's mainly because we've got fuck all to go on. The most we've learned about them in years was with Smiley at Punk Hazard.<br><br> Also, there's a lot of baseless speculation like "All of these races came from the moons". While it's a nice theory, it really has fuck-all backing it up. Some pictures of moons in no way indicate that dwarves/giants/longecks/longarms/mi<wbr>nks/etc. came from various moons. That's a crazy stretch to make.</wbr> <br>I agree. That's about as fanfictiony as it gets. I like the idea but it's entirely baseless. I was just saying that in the other thread, I'm not sure that the Ohara model is anything to go by. If something happened to the moons, it happened during the void century and was covered up. Currently the only moon in the sky is Fairy Vearth. If they were doing their research in secret in the basement, they wouldn't have a fuck off huge model in the main hall that exclaims WE KNOW SOMETHING WE SHOULDNT. Truth is, we don't know anything about the Ohara model and it could be something else entirely. All that we know for certain is that there is one moon.<br><br> It's really clever, though. I liked it. I really enjoy the fan theories. One Piece is an impressively large world that has really rich lore. Oda really fucking knows how to do worldbuilding. <br>Oh definitely! Of all the stretching that it does, I'm totally in for the Punk Hazard/Elbaf/Uranus link. That's just the kind of easter-egg you don't know that you're seeing that Oda loves. Other than that, the D/Moon People theory seems pretty legit from what Greg said. I suppose it's just interesting when someone manages to put it all into perspective</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never this badly.</br>  <br>then tell us a good reason that leaves no plot holes besides amnesia</br>  <br>Because he was lazy and wanted to create a simple explanation that doesn't warrant further questioning.<br><br>Not guy you're replying to, but hey. Oda clearly had other shit to deal with that wasn't coming up with an interesting/complex but understandable reason for Sabo to not contact Ace or Luffy before now.<br><br>It was bland, lazy, cliched, and uninspired, but it did the job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not even the worst part.<br> i forgot everything <br> okay let's give him back to the parents <br> N-no actually there's this instinct i just awakened and shit that tells me to not return to my parents <br>Really Oda?</br></br></br></br></br>  Favourite foreshadowing?<br><br>The kids talking about Doflamingo's awakening attacks about 30 chapters before the reader will understand what it properly means</br></br>  <br> Don't really have an explanation why he wouldn't contact Luffy and Ace though. <br>And this is what you just can't cover with anything else but amnesia. <br><br>Why are people so butthurt about it anyway? Getting amnesia after being blown up seems pretty reasonable to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering one of One Piece's major themes is<br> Man only dies when he is forgotten <br>And a major fucking plot point of Dressrosa was the tragedy of forgetting your loved ones with the toys and shit, I'd say it's not that much of a hurr dur plot point considering that. It's cliche and convenient, yes. But it fits well with the theme of the arc and honestly it's pretty tragic you heartless plebs. Luffy and Sabo's reunion was pretty touching too.</br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>The story of One Piece would be fundamentally different for there to be no plotholes without the amnesia thing.<br><br>So it is Oda's fault if he really did plan so far ahead for Sabo to appear and then write him in with such a cheap trick.</br></br></br>  <br>Please god no</br>  <br> Favourite foreshadowing? <br>Luffy defeated Mr.3 using unawakened observation haki.</br></br>  <br>(G)Oda theres the G.</br>  <br> plot-relevant reason why he couldn't show up <br><br>There's your problem, it wasn't that Sabo wasn't there at Marineford, but the whole life he went missing without trying to contact neither Ace, Garp, Dadan or Luffy.</br></br></br>  <br>No but she will join a gladiator crew as professional cumdumpster,she's used to it anyway</br>  <br>After Monet.</br>  <br>One of my favorites is Rayleigh first appearing in Chapter 19.</br>  <br>I'm totally on board with there being six moons, with a seventh orbiting one of the other six, and all but one is destroyed. I feel like that might be a good way to explain a bit of the world's fucked up shit. It makes more sense than say, Oars Sr. moving continents. He's large, but he's not that large.<br><br>But yeah, it seems we both agree that there's a lot of stretching for things due to lack of information. I'm hoping they're right on some of this stuff, like with Uranus/Elbaf/Punk Hazard. It might just be a weapon that creates giants. They're pretty fucking terrifying.</br></br></br>  Why didnt Luffy sink when Higuma knocked his tiny rubber ass into the ocean?  <br>That is not foreshadowing</br>  <br>Come on now. Luffy's always had good instincts but it's most likely not a haki instance.<br><br>It's possible he was considering a version of haki around that time to get it ready for Skypiea though, so perhaps.</br></br></br>  Reminder that he is Rayleigh's brother.  <br> characters appearing before a proper introduction is not foreshadowing <br>Why even ask the question then if you're forcing your own definition upon everyone else?  That's mostly rhetorical. </br></br>  <br> Tonfa Mace <br>I will never understand why Gin thought that would be a good weapon.<br><br>You put 2 shit tier weapons together and you get even more shit.<br>Gin has shit taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>hes okay though because Gin never shouted his attack names like a dork</br>  <br>Nothing foreshadows him meeting with the strawhats. It's not foreshadowing of anything.</br>  <br>Yes it is.<br> When Shanks and Buggy were first revealed to be part of Roger's crew, a fan asked Oda in a SBS question if the man that scolded them was a subordinate captain under Roger that commanded the ship they were sailing on, or even a high ranking officer. Without giving away Rayleigh's name at the time, Oda responded that this man was none other than the first mate of Roger's crew. Oda also stated in his response that since he had set this fact in stone from the very start, he told Toei Animation that when they adapt Buggy's flashback for the anime, Buggy and Shanks should not refer to Rayleigh as Captain in the anime. </br></br>  <br>Thats what happens when you write yourself into a corner, there are alot more options as to what oda could have gone with. but no matter What he chose. people were going to bitch about it</br>  <br>What the fuck, this tenryubito seems like a cool guy. Unless he's a civilian in disguise. Yeah, that's more likely.</br>  <br>Fine then. Luffy tackling Smoker's back using unawakened armament haki in Alabasta.</br>  <br> And a major fucking plot point of Dressrosa was the tragedy of forgetting your loved ones with the toys and shit, <br>The fact that Sabo was introduced in this arc, damn. Whether it was on purpose or not, that's a nice touch.</br></br>  <br> there are alot more options as to what oda could have gone with. <br>then tell us, so far nobody could name a convincing alternative that does not leave any plot holes</br></br>  <br> It was bland, lazy, cliched, and uninspired, but it did the job. <br>The job is to have a good story. Not just have a logical story. So, yeah, it made the story work, but it didn't make it good.<br><br><br>So why did he plan so far ahead then? Surely he could have come up with something better. He controls what is happening.<br><br>Sure, getting amnesia might be reasonable. But a good plot is not about wether it would make sense in the real world. It is about how well the plot points are connected.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't bother trying to prove him wrong. That guy won't accept anything other than his own opinion.</br>  <br>Yeah, there's no guards shoving everyone to the ground or anything. It's weird.<br><br>I feel like even if he were a civilian dressing up, people would freak out and bow anyway. Then someone would discover he's a fake and he'd be murdered.</br></br></br>  <br>Since Fishman Island, we can probably get a lot more from this page than we could.<br><br>Ship on the right? Pluton<br>Sea Kings underneath? Poseidon<br>Green thing on the left? Uranus<br><br>It's crazy how much story that Enel cover story has in it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Im more curious as to how God tier Haki users ever get contained or captured. its fair enough with devil fruit users as Seastone weakens them. but can you guys honestly tell me anyone above Rob Luccy level without a devil fruit could be contained?  <br>easy<br><br>Sabo is the pandaman. The new one. Dragon was the first one</br></br></br>  <br>over here retard  </br>  <br>Funny</br>  <br>A story that isn't logical is never good. Even One Piece, with all its kinks and weird stuff that happens isn't an exception.</br>  <br>Impel Down was full of non-Haki using shitters and DF users, so I imagine most of the presumably few Haki users are dicking around on the outside, like Rayleigh.</br>  <br>My anus is not green.</br>  <br>I said "convincing alternative that does not leave plot holes" you stupid fuck</br>  <br>How would you know ? Did you check ?</br>  <br>This  post pointed the plothole within, retard.</br>  <br>At least those replies are more foreshadowing than your post.</br>  <br>Non of them leaves any plot holes you autist<br><br> inb4 hurr durr why didn't he contact ace and luffy <br>Because he has his own fucking life as a rev and all of them had their own adventures to do. That's why Ace didn't take luffy with him to fight BB.</br></br></br></br>  <br>read the last sentence faggot</br>  <br>-He was locked up. On a mission in a far away country and was , so he didn't hear about it.<br>-Was too far to travel and didnt make it in time<br>-Dragon forbid it as he didnt want the revilutionaries to be involved more then Iva allready was. or Dragon had a speciffic reason (god knows with him as we know nothing about him or his motivations)<br>-Off tranning on a Island like Luffy was where he could get no news from the outside world<br>-Injured in a battle and was unconceous, then tried to go but was too weak. Again Dragon forbidding him from going.<br>Should i keep going or what?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> characters appearing before a proper introduction is not foreshadowing <br>No? That doesn't foreshadow any event. If any character hinted at him reappearing later it would be,but as it is it's just a character that will come back later.</br></br>  <br>That's not true though, is it?</br>  <br><br>see , it's literally not a plot hole if we follow the known one piece logic autistic mach 20 reader.</br></br>  So it's pretty obvious that Dragon's gotten a Crow devil fruit from this chapter.  <br>I never said a story should not be logical. A story should be logical. But just being logical is not enough for making a story good.</br>  <br> Because he has his own fucking life as a rev and all of them had their own adventures to do. <br>yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. THIS is shit writing.</br></br>  <br>That's not very convincing. And it's not a hurr durr.</br>  <br>There's a difference between "not taking your kid brother along in a duel to the death" and "not telling your brothers you are alive for over a decade"</br>  <br> The kids talking about Doflamingo's awakening attacks about 30 chapters before <br> the flashback was almost a year ago <br><br>Jesus Christ</br></br></br></br>  Sabo should have never existed. What a horribly boring Mary Sue.  <br>Are you fucking serious? haha, holy shit</br>  <br>Ace hadn't seen Luffy in 3 years yet he went out of his way to meet Luffy even though he was on a mission for WB. Yet you tell me Sabo not getting in contact with Ace even though he hadn't seen him in 15 years and knew exactly where to find him makes sense ?</br>  <br>Even if you don't have a power, seastone is still hard as fuck.</br>  <br>No less than skewering punishment.</br>  <br>You so stupid.</br>  <br> yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. <br>He did say goodby through the act of sailing out you retard di you even read the manga?<br><br><br><br><br> implying Sabo would go all the way back to east blue for that without knowing where luffy is now exactly <br><br><br>Ace was almost at the same destination as luffy and not doing shit around the new world as sabo obviously did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Granted there was Mangellan guarding it. but i find it really hard to understand how there has never been someone strong enough to escape before luffy. Its not like Haki is a new concept to the world. It fully seems like there are people who can simply not be contained.<br>-Garp<br>-Shishikubai<br>-certain giants<br>-Yonko</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>These only explain why he could not be at MF you fuck, the more important part is why did he not contact Luffy or Ace in 10 fucking years or did not even say goodbye to them before leaving with the revs.</br>  I'm more curious to know why/how Sabo, of all people, ended up becoming the Revolutionary Second-in-Command.  <br>Fine. Suppose my anus is green. Then your head looks like my anus.</br>  <br>holy shit you make me cringe, just stop</br>  <br>Yeah, but that's an actual foreshadowing. Something that was actually mentioned ahead of the time of it's reveal. It's just as much foreshadowing as Rosinante hiding on the cover of 691, 70 chapters before his introduction.<br><br>You shoehorning haki in, earlier than it was in the series isn't foreshadowing. Your fanfiction isn't haki. Mantra is the earliest version.</br></br></br>  <br> yeah, he would totally just fuck off with the revs withouth telling Luffy or Ace goodbye or anything. <br><br> "not telling your brothers you are alive for over a decade" <br><br>From Sabo's PoV Ace/Luffy would've never thought died, and before he left he sent them a letter saying goodbye and declaring that they'd meet again someday out on the sea when they'd all become strong pirates</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He would have come to Logue Town with Dragon.</br>  <br> I have no arguments  <br>Good for you</br></br>  <br>and you think considering Sabo's character he wouldnt have contacted any of them to at least tell them he was alive? Are you retarded? Or do you not give a shit about consistancy in character and plot and only care about m-muh unique plotlines hurr durr</br>  <br>Im pretty comfortable with it being Revolutinary reasons. YOU FUCK<br>After joining Dragon his cause was greater then finding Ace or Luffy. When all 3 of them agreed on walking their own paths anyway. its not like Luffy and Ace were exactly trying to find each other EVER unless a speciffic reason like Ace knew Blackbeard was hunting Luffy</br></br>  <br>Oda could have just using one of those faces as Rosinate design.</br>  <br>Sea prism stone is also rare as fuck, and getting enough to construct a cage out of is really tough. If you do get a cage like that, odds are you're throwing a DF user in there, not some asshole.<br><br>Besides, I wouldn't be surprised if Mihawk (and eventually Zoro) could cut through it.<br><br><br> implying Sabo would go all the way back to east blue <br>At any point he could have gone back, sent a letter, you name it. Ace took time out of chasing down Blackbeard to GO BACKWARDS THROUGH THE GRAND LINE just to say hi to Luffy.<br>That shit is not a cakewalk.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because he is strong?</br>  so, I'm rereading the aftermath of the marine ford arc and one thing came to my mind<br>how in the fuck did law managed to get out of the calm belt without help?</br>  <br>No. Conqueror is the earliest.</br>  <br> After joining Dragon his cause was greater then finding Ace or Luffy. <br>that would contradict Sabos character completely. I hope you will never write a story.</br></br>  <br>He was probably just a no-name before the war.<br><br>After he heard of Ace's death and got his memories back he probably trained and got strong as fuck.<br><br>And in 2 years he became the number 2 in the Revolutionary.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He would have come to Logue Town with Dragon <br>Literally nothing suggests that. Nothing suggests that Dragon knew that luffy us there and nothing suggest that Dragon always goes with Sabo on missions. Even dressrosa shows that sabo CAN head out with his own crew.<br><br><br> them to at least tell them he was alive? <br> Sabo knew that they the one guy saw him dying and told ace/luffy <br>No<br><br><br> Ace took time out of chasing down Blackbeard to GO BACKWARDS THROUGH THE GRAND LINE just to say hi to Luffy. <br>Nop, he was searching BB that was his primary goal. He just happened to end up near the place luffy was at, he did not at point think that he should forget BB and rather search luffy by taking another direction.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> your head looks like my anus <br>Go home Sanji.</br></br>  <br>He has a fucking submarine. These things move on their own. <br>Also they probably got a snake from the kujas to scare the sea kings away. Or maybe the Kuja crew just accompanied them with their ship until they were back in the GL.</br></br>  <br>Ace, Sabo and Luffy were talented and strong as fuck for little kids their age</br>    <br>you don't have to sail through the calm belt to get to marine ford</br>  <br>Debatable. We aren't even sure that it was intended to be Haki in the first place. It could easily have been badass stares down big monster trope.<br><br>The earliest confirmed Haki use is Mantra, and it seems highly likely it wasn't intended to become what Haki is today.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm posting from my home, silly.</br>  <br>Shanks in chapter 1?<br><br>It's entirely possible. But it's just as possible that it's a retcon. He was developing a power for a long time before he came to the haki we know today. Going through mantra which obviously became Observation and douriki which is a failed and possibly scrapped idea</br></br></br>  <br>...after receiving training from the Revolutionaries, yes.<br><br>It's more curiosity wondering how Sabo was chosen instead of Ivankov or someone else who had been around longer.</br></br></br>  <br> that would contradict Sabos character completely. I hope you will never write a story. <br>Wasnt Sabo leaving on his own anyway? only leaving behind a letter? faggot.</br></br>  <br>You do to get to Amazon Lily</br>  <br>He was already chief of staff in OP's flashback.<br> the chief of staff woke up ! </br></br>  <br>he was strong as fuck for a kid. <br>Do we know how long Ivankov was in Impel Down? I don't remember, maybe that's why sabo got his position</br></br>  <br>yeah but his submarine wasn't fucking made of sea stone and I don't think the kujas did any of that given that he left shortly after rayleigh got there <br><br>yeah, you have to in order to get out of amazon lily as the map you posted shows though</br></br></br>  <br>No he wasn't.<br><br>You literally have no proof of that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Probably because Ivankov was in jail and left for tranny island when he got out.</br></br>  <br>He has a submarine. I'm sure he could have just went straight long enough to get out. And since it's a submarine, it's probably Super High-Tech and he probably got it as a gift from Doffy who asked Vegapunk to make it with Seastone covering.</br>  <br><br> and I don't think the kujas did any of that given that he left shortly after rayleigh got there  <br>Your headcanon. Just because it wasn't mentioned doesn't mean it didn't happen. The Kuja did escort them to the island, it's likely they escorted them back to the GL. It's the most likely explanation.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure he could have just <br> it's probably <br> and he probably <br>Jesus christ all this forcing and guessing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, we only have guesses. What's our point?</br>  <br>Sabo and Ace were on the same tier of stupid-strong as kids<br><br>Sabo, like Ace was, is a monster</br></br></br>  i bet Nami is a spy of the Revs and betrys luffy for sabo  <br>Did you fucking expect Oda to show up and speak moon to you ? Get the fuck outta here.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>How much are you willing to bet?<br><br>How about... one million?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't respond to obvious shitposting, baka. He's probably the same fuck who claims females can't use haki.</br>  <br><br> Maybe <br> Probbably <br> Could have <br>Just type "in my opinion" faggots wel all know its your headcannon bullshit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo had WORDS for Dragon <br><br>aw shit</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 hurr durr niggerstream, shit translation, post raw, you don't know nihongo </br>  <br>Holy shit, that made me laugh harder than it should have.</br>  <br>I can't even read the translation because its so shit.<br>He was most likely Chief of Staff of Fodder.<br><br>Stop trying to fuck my thunder I felt so fucking good writing that post.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"in my opinion"</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>Not that anon, but if you know it is headcanon and guessing, why do you need him to state it?<br><br>Calm your tits, holy damn. You're 8/10 mad right now and a 3 would be the maximum for a situaton like this.</br></br></br>  <br> a sentence with those three words surely must be a fact! <br>Are you kidding me ? How the fuck could you come to that conclusion when I purposefully used ambiguous words ? It's obviously a goddamn guess. No one said it was canon, you cunt.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>   Akainu: You’d better make amends before you show your face here again, Fujitora! // I won’t let you set foot in a single Marine base until you bring me the heads of Straw Hat and Law!!! <br> Fujitora: ......No problem at all!!!! <br>So he decided too leave the marines right there and then?</br></br>  <br> WAIT SAUCE? <br>My keks have exploded</br></br>  <br> you cunt. <br>Your trying to force it as whats going to happen or what the explination is.

And get replaced by Momousagi.</br>  <br>Man, I just took a poop and was greeted by some fucker who thinks I speak for Oda. <br>Glad someone got a laugh out of it.</br></br>  <br><br>Mangastream translations are accurate, they're just filled with needless slang and swearing.</br></br>  <br>I Honestly dont see why not. I dont see any part of his character that would show otherwise. Hell it even seems like he dosen't even like the marines and how they do shit. and that he did it to try it out or a favour to someone.</br>    <br> You trying to force it <br> deliberately used words like "could have, probably (x2)" <br> forcing it <br>Yea, you have a good day, asshole.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>why exactly would Issho care about returning to a base? He can just chill on the boats and whatnot. It's not like he's missing anything, surely someone is already watering his plants for him<br><br>and Saka refusing to see him just gives him more space to fuck shit up as he pleases</br></br></br>  <br>yeah to become a pirate like ace and luffy? ace got a hold of luffy a few months after luffy set sail, why wouldnt Sabo? Heck, why didnt he ask the Revs to take him to Dandan/Luffy/Ace instead of his parents? He had no reason to go sailing with a bunch of strangers when his friends were right there. Why would Sabo even give up his promise/dream to become a pirate to be free in the first place? All that is out of character without the convenient anmesia plotline that allows his character to start fresh and build up his own aspirations. Whether you like it or not, it gives the readers a legitimate reason why Sabo of the Revs chose a different path from his former self. And why he chooses to stick with it despite his memories coming back, since his new ambitions are embedded in him just as much as his pre-amnesia childhood's ambitions.</br>  <br>I know bro but people will always claim it's shit translation to meet their agenda. Just look at </br>  <br> yfw 15 years from now Fujitora, Law and Luffy destroy the marine HQ </br>  <br>Viz non shit Stephen translation.<br><br>I got the idea originally that he was after Luffy and Law but now I'm not too sure. Personally I think he has more shot of making a decent change if he's part of the Navy rather than away from it.<br><br>Was Law even officially taken out of the Warlords during Dressrosa? Would that not have given Law and his crew, which in this case would have included Luffy immunity until the WG said something about it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ace got a hold of luffy a few months after luffy set sail <br>Pretty sure that was because he herd Blackbeard was hunting Luffy and wanted to check up on him. was a speciffic reason.</br></br>  <br> Heck, why didnt he ask the Revs to take him to Dandan/Luffy/Ace instead of his parents? <br><br>Amnesia. Do you know how it works?</br></br></br>  <br>But Marine HQ is located at the opposing direction of Luffy and Law's goal.</br>  <br> Yea, you have a good day, asshole. <br>*Tips Fedora* Nothing personal KID</br></br>  <br>I think I know at least where devil fruits came from, I've been planning to write up the whole theory once Dressrosa ends but the arc just kept going and going. I'm waiting to see if we can learn more from the dwarves before I type up the full theory, and it's not just speculation there actually are a few clues that not many others have spotted.</br>  <br> lover's spat </br>  <br> why didnt he ask the Revs to take him to Dandan/Luffy/Ace instead of his parents? He had no reason to go sailing with a bunch of strangers when his friends were right there. <br>Same as Ace with Whitebeard stuff. Was on the ship and before he could find a reason to leave he liked it too much</br></br>  <br> Was Law even officially taken out of the Warlords during Dressrosa? <br>nope he and doffy are shichibukai until the next meeting which will obviously happen soon.<br><br> Would that not have given Law and his crew, which in this case would have included Luffy immunity until the WG said something about it? <br>Nope because law outright told fujitora that luffy isn't working for him and that they are an alliance which is why fuji fought law on greenbit.<br><br><br> &gt;implying luffy won't come back to destroy it after reaching raftel </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go back licking Dellinger's anus.</br>  <br>Teach wasn't hunting Luffy at all. They only met in Mocktown and even then Teach was surprised by Luffy's bounty. It was only after Luffy and Zoro got the Arabasta boost that Teach tried to attack them. Ace had no idea until Banaro.<br><br><br>I think that was his point.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. That's why I'm saying amnesia is the only way to cover that plothole. I'm arguing with a guy that's saying otherwise.</br>  <br>they're acting like a couple and you know it</br>  <br><br><br>oh. Carry on then</br></br></br>  <br>Well anon, I look forward to hearing it. I like all kinds of theories, and you seem pretty confident in yours.</br>  <br>What? The Revs were literally strangers to him at that point. They suggested to take him back to his parents when he just woke up from his concussion. He could've just said no, take me back to these guys instead.</br>  I feel like a retard for not knowing Benn Beckman was Shanks' First Mate.  <br>Its not called acting like a couple if they're both men you bakayaroga.<br><br>They're just having a bro-down.<br>Bro-ing off with eachother.<br>Just another Bro-out.<br>No homo bromo.<br><br>Watch this video to understand.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gRp<wbr>Tjr4L4T4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>Tch. Filthy gaijin-sans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably will still be in the Marines. Still be an admiral. Basically arresting law and luffy right then would outrage an already outraged country. A country full of riches. This could cause a lot of problems. Best to arrest them later.</br>  <br>How did you miss that?</br>  <br>Those are pretty shitty couple.</br>  <br>I don't follow SBSs as much as I should.</br>  <br>yes and they'll make up with Brojobs laters</br>  <br><br>It's the best thing he could have done with Sabo honestly. That's not to say Sabo is a good character or a good addition to the story right now, but amnesia is the only way to have made it make sense. Him not going to rescue Ace would be somewhat understandable because respecting his brother and letting him live his own life etc, but there would still be no excuse for him staying hidden away from Ace or Luffy for years.</br></br>  <br>i dunno, I think it's kind of cute<br><br>Sakazuki wouldn't deserve Issho though</br></br></br>  <br> a country full of riches </br>  <br> Sakazuki wouldn't deserve Issho though <br>My thoughts exactly.</br></br>  <br> Kid gets hit by cannon fire <br> Not only that but almost drowns <br> Survives traumatic and painful experience <br> Scar and amnesia <br>Sounds fucking legit to me op. Go back to reading naruto with its moon people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't help but feel that Akainu had a fucking terrible past. In his kid drawing (from when Oda drew a lot of major character as children), he was shown bloodied with a knife in his hand. Makes me wonder if perhaps his home town was destroyed by pirates and his parents were killed or something to condition his blatant and severe hatred for pirates.</br>  <br> &gt;Kid gets hit by cannon fire <br> luffy gets raped by lucci <br> nothing </br></br></br>  <br> Luffy literally cracked the air with one punch <br> cracked the air <br> with ONE punch <br> and it looks like Whitebeard's quake punch literally on WB's level <br><br>Holy shit.<br>SPOILER THAT SHIT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's Flamingo's spider's web.</br>  <br>That's the spider thread Doffy set up earlier, silly.</br>  <br>That picture is literally irrelevant. What? A couple of buildings got wrecked? You know how many jewels and valuables they have there? First you have king Riku's valuables and all the valuables that doffy took from the people. Then you have the valuables of all the pirates that came there and were turned into toys. All the government agents. Everyone. Doffy was doing blackmarket trades. He had money to do such.</br>  <br>We alreaedy established wether it is logical or not.<br><br>However it does not make for a good story.</br></br></br>  <br>And what exactly makes for a good story?</br>  <br>some fanfictier bullshit that leaves more holes in the plot than a swiss cheese</br>  <br> anime fags <br>I will never understand</br></br>  <br>Well connected plotpoints. Read the thread.</br>  <br><br>Oh.<br><br>Shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy is an angel <br>IT FINALLY ALL MAKES SENSE</br></br>  <br>Chill. I was making a joke.</br>  <br><br>I totally agree, Ace didn't really make an impact on me until he died. And then it was just like...okay so this guy we barely saw got himself and his friends murdered because pride?<br><br>I also find fire a cliched and boring power.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well.... no. Not exactly.</br>  <br>but everything connects with this, what the fuck is your problem?</br>  <br>I thought he's already dead and dreaming all that nonsense.</br>  <br>hurr durr sekrit mission</br>  this was the best part of this entire arc  What is with Sabo being reintroduced anyway? I have no problem with him in the flashback but I don't understand what role he's meant to serve in the story right now.  <br>Come on though. The moves Ace does is pretty damn cool looking.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>His problem is that there probably was a more interesting/complex way to write the same story, and he's probably correct.<br><br>That said, amnesia did the job well. It just doesn't make for the most interesting version of the story, and I guess I'm okay with that.</br></br></br>  <br>It makes sense logically, yes. But from a narrative standpoint, things are jsut dropped in without any conenction to the other events in the plot.</br>  <br>We'll figure it out in a few years. My guess is he'll save Luffy from some predicament.</br>  <br>Doffy was supplying weapons and shit to countries. His defeat is gonna end a lot of wars, for better or worse. Revolutionaries have an active interest in countries.</br>  <br> hurr durr I forgot everything except that I don't like my parents </br>  <br>Gear 4th for me but this is pretty high up there</br>  <br>I didn't understand Kuma's role in the story during his first appearance beside him being a Shichibukai.</br>  <br>This is how I feel about it. When Oda dies, You go write one piece since you are a plot master. Of course things can always be done better. But it's not your story to tell. Go write your own manga where the plot is up to your standards.</br>  <br> what is subconsciousness </br>  <br>The examples in the thread are not what I mean. I am talking about the discussion.<br><br>The plot of One Piece would need to be restructured drastically for Sabo to smoothly fit in without the amnesia plot device. Oda foreshadowed him for quite a while, and the fact that he didn't manage anything better is a sad thing.</br></br></br>  <br>hurr durr he didn't forget how to talk either</br>  <br><br> hurr my parents were more important than my brothers </br></br>  <br> how pathetic <br>why would he ever say that? was this shitpanda's doing?</br></br>  <br>hurr durr of course they are</br>  <br>probably, they even got the name wrong too</br>  <br>Not the point, not at all.</br>  <br> hurr durr that's not how amnesia works you dumb fuck </br>  <br> a jolly good time with my bros vs traumatising parents who all wanted to burn down the place. </br>  <br>hurr durr that's not how hurr durr work you dumb wank</br>   this thread   <br>you included</br>  Post more Dellinger pic pls.  <br><br> have serious head trauma as a child resulting in amnesia  <br><br>how is this bad writing</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no way to know the roman writing of a name from the raw alone. Oda confirmed it to be Russian after this was released. They actually put a translator note about it, what else could they have done ?</br>  <br>He felt repelled by the thought of going back to the island because his experiences were etched in his subconsciousness.</br>  <br>This actually makes sense though. His memories of his brothers would have been short term memories compared to his parents whom he knew for many years, so if he actually had amnesia he would remember his parents.</br>  <br>Doesn't "connect to other events in the plot" according to someone.</br>  <br>I do enjoy One Piece. But why am I not allowed to criticize it on a board for the discussion of manga and anime, just because I cannot create something similar?<br><br>You are allowed to say that food does not taste well even if you are not a cook.</br></br></br>  <br>It isn't. Some people are just dissapointed that the reason for Sabo not being at MF is not a super secret special mission.</br>  Why do people make such a big deal out of the amnesia stuff. I just read the chapter, said "Oh, okay then." and then went on discussing actually interesting stuff.  <br>But your reasons for saying the food doesnt taste well are "I'm going to still eat this food even though I could make better food". Go make better food then.</br>  <br>I knew it was going to be full of shitposting with the question in the OP. Can't even blame it on daytime 4chan.<br> old thread is shitposting and spam from fagfags <br> this thread is shitposting about Sabo opinions <br>Never fucking ends. Kids always have to argue about something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This. When you have arachnophobia you will still fear spiders even if you have amnesia for example. It is completely natural.</br>  <br>Doffy and Rosi's childhood torture scene foreshadowed Thousand Arrows and 16 Bullets of the Assassin.</br>  <br>Because some people like to nitpick about everything and overanalzye a comic for kids on a highly autistic level.</br>  <br> short term memories <br>Whoa now. Do you even know what Short Term Memory is?<br><br>Regardless of your flawed knowledge related to memory, he spent years with both his parents and Ace/Luffy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>So, what you are saying is, I am not allowed to criticize something I generally like just because I cannot create something similar? Is that your final answer?<br><br><br>Why do you purposefully misrepresent arguments of people you disagree with? I do not want him to go on a secret mission or something.<br>I want him to be well interwoven into the plot.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kind of. It's more like the other way around.<br><br>It's more of a call back.</br></br></br>  <br>No. What I'm saying is, go out and write your own manga or story or whatever instead of sitting on a thread complaining about what you don't like as if it's going to change anything. Expression of opinion is overrated.</br>  <br>So you don't want something real, plausible, sensible, non plot hole creating, but you want Oda to make up some other bullshit.</br>  <br> Expression of opinion is overrated <br>Expression of opinion is overrated.</br></br>  <br>Here's the thing. My opinion is on something that can change with my input. Your's isn't.</br>  <br>Calm down, I'm not that anon.</br>  <br> Well connected plotpoints. Read the thread <br>and every example of why anmesia works best in this thread is explaining exactly that. Whatever your shitty headcannon is probably fucks up the plotpoints even more than not.</br></br>   Eneru's mini arc is actually the most important thing in the story <br> The anime doesn't even animate it <br><br>Why do they always do this shit? They skipped so much important shit it's not funny anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>This isn't the last time we're gonna see Sabo if that's what you were thinking.</br>  <br>Alright, anon. I will not follow up to your advice though, sorry.<br><br><br> real <br>You mean realistic? Because mangas are not real, anon.<br>And nah, since this is a fantasy universe, it would not need to be realistic.<br><br> plausible, sensible <br>Within the consistent given laws of the universe, yes, that'd be good.<br><br> non plot hole creating <br>No, I don't want plotholes.<br><br> but you want Oda to make up some other bullshit. <br>I want Sabo to have a better explanation for showing up from out of nowhere after 12 years, and Oda obviously would have been able to do that, since he (apparently) foreshadowed him since the late Eastblue saga, and thus had many an opportunity to interweave him into the plot.<br>He missed that opportunity, and that is a shame. I can't change that, but I am not going to like it either.<br><br>But what am I doing here, you are just going to misrepresent my arguments in a snarky way as a response to this post.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because the anime is for people that watch one piece just because it is popular and not because it is a great story</br>  <br>Because the moon story will likely be retold in the main series when it's relevant. I mean, it's history and all, but it's going to be largely glossed over in the way of "When I was on the moon, I discovered..." and explains the important bits, and probably not the space pirates.</br>  <br>Like I said, and I repeat myself again: the entire plot would need to be different for Sabo to be included well. Just having one off-hand-explanation is not going to change shit, it might aswell be the amnesia plot device then. The examples in this thread are shit aswell.</br>  Because I'm a faggot who doesn't read manga typically, I need to know of a place with good scans for One Piece.  <br>Mangareader, you spoonfed faggot.</br>  <br>Well, you spoonfed him.</br>  <br>for the entirety of one piece? I havent read the early chapters in a while but they had some horrendus translations, specially the names</br>  <br>Thank you, based mommy.</br>  <br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-digital-colored-comics-r10004<br><br>This has 700 chapters of one piece in the best translation and colour.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>all these people acting like prestigious literary critics for a fucking shounen manga. it's pretty hilarious.</br>  <br> comparing amnesia in One Piece and real world, kek </br>  <br>Batoto<br>Batoto coloured version<br>Mangasee for the missing chapters<br>Mangastream.to for most recent chapters<br>Vizanons imgur album for best translations of recent chapters (though he's currently behind)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, that other anon started.</br>  <br> GUYS <br><br> GUYS DO NOT CRITICIZE ONE PIECE <br><br> NO GUYS BAD <br><br>You are this mad. :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the main problem is that they forget that One Piece is aimed at teenagers but demand Odas writing to cater to their adult minds.</br>  <br>hello autism my old friend</br>  <br>Sabo and Ace were just there to make Luffy react. Oda just shoehorned those 2 guys in the story.</br>  <br>Usually his writing is pretty good actually, atleast what the long term plot is concerned. That's the reason why "Sabo had amnesia" gets so much shit, it is not up to par with the way he usually handles things.</br>  <br> Vizanons imgur album for best translations of recent chapters (though he's currently behind) <br>No. No he isn't.<br><br>And if he ever does stop, I've got a WSJ sub so I'll upload it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw he's gonna think it's me who replied to him <br>Not that the kid who has no knowledge of memory would ever admit being wrong to begin with.</br></br>  <br>I welcome it, just because it's a shounen manga doesn't really forbid it from having complex foreshadowing that people can discuss and make theories about.</br>  <br>Oh you're right he finally caught up.</br>  <br>He was only a week or two off anyway.<br><br>Remember as well that Jump comes out the following Monday from the Japanese releases. Late Monday too.</br></br></br>  So do you think Zeff may have at least made it halfway through the Grand Line?  <br>Yes. At least FI or Sabaody. He knew about "Paradise".</br>  So sad.  <br>He probably wasn't strong enough for the New World and got rekt. Unless All Blue hasn't been found yet I'm pretty sure it's that place in Fishman Island,</br>  <br>True, it seems the translation with the crows is different here. He produced the crows instead of calling them? What did the raws say?</br>  <br>Gekkou Moria confirmed</br>  <br>It's probably just "summoning".</br>  <br>It's not Moria you sperglord we've disproved this a thousand times already.</br>  <br>We don't know who "he" is still. Sabo's talking to someone else.<br><br><br>Manga authors that are friends have similar elements?<br><br><br>God tier foreshadowing that Oda is king of. Give the Revolutionaries a crow motif and no one notices til years later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have normal crows and gekkou's which can talk you retard</br>    <br> the entire plot would need to be different for Sabo to be included well <br>and you would prefer Oda to change his entire plot to accomdate this one character that's not even the main protagonist? In my opinion having Sabo introduced in this arc where a major plot point was the tragedy of forgetting loved ones (toys) was accomodating enough. I'm not saying Oda wrote the toy plot in this particular arc just for Sabo, but considering the connections, I'm pretty sure he put some thought behind his back story more than you're suggesting.<br><br>And so what if it's just a plot device? Is Oda immune to them or some shit? Whether Oda thought up Sabo as he was writing or if he planned him ahead of time is debatable, but he obviously wants him in the story now for future use. Maybe he thinks Sabo's inclusion in the series will pay off with the way he wants to write his own goddamn story? He found a way to put Sabo in without creating plotholes, without shitting on the character's consistancy, keeping it connected with the themes, and giving him a pretty touching reunion with his brother. In my opinion I think you're just expecting too much at this point if you're not letting a guy who's been writing a pretty consistantly decent series for 18 years, not use one fucking cliche plot device to wrap up something as cleanly as possible.<br><br>I'm pretty sure any explanation would've come with its fair share of butthurt comments. But at least with this explanation we have nothing to question, we can just move the fuck on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you smoking speedreader. Moria made bats out of shadows, not crows, and they couldn't talk either.</br>  <br> still thinking All Blue is already an existing place </br>  <br>I'm not mad. Like I said, I think it's actually pretty funny.</br>  <br> we can just move the fuck on <br>Ahahahahaha. If only Anon.</br></br>  <br> Moria made bats out of shadows <br> what is moria's shadow <br>mach 20 reader if you don't even know that moria can form whatever the fuck he wants out of his shadow you shouldnt post here</br></br></br>  <br>Probably one of these dudes from the Sabo vs Burgess chapter where the phone guy hang up too earlier there as well.</br>  <br>Didn't they leave that blonde guy at All Blue? I think that was his dream because he was a cook or something, what was his name again, sanjay?</br>  <br>Fuck off you're the speedreader if you honestly think his shadows can talk.<br><br>The reason why  proves it's not Moria is because at that time Moria was at Marineford, it's literally impossible.</br></br></br>  <br> we can just move the fuck on <br>Oh anon. You need to accept that children ALWAYS have to be arguing about SOMETHING.<br><br>Look at all the people making a huge deal about the crow guy in the Revolutionaries, and some people even believe it's fucking Moria. I expect these same people to shit themselves at any future time when another person with a potential Devil Fruit power is revealed to communicate with the Revolutionaries too. It's fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Probably <br>Entirely baseless. Could be anyone. Could just be talking crows. Stranger shit has happened.</br></br>  <br>simply ebin :^)</br>  <br>No wonder they have to put him into hiatus every so often. Just look at this shit, you know how much work that was to put together in the first place? sure he just took the more outstanding nonames and added them to the more important people but still.</br>  <br><br>Forgot pic</br></br>  What fight are you the most hyped for? If Van Auger vs Usopp isn't the greatest shit ever I'll die on the spot.  <br> implying moria's shadow can't act independent <br>You're the only speedreader here.<br>Also I said that the revs have actual crows and those of moria that were big enough for sabo to ride on you retard</br></br></br>  <br>Kidd,Hawkins and Apoo Vs Shanks and co.<br><br>Unless they're offscreened or something but I'm pretty hyped for this seeing as we'll get his fight relatively soon compared to something like Luffy vs Blackbeard.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay you're either a troll or a retard</br>  <br>nope you just outright lost the argument</br>  <br>No I realised you're not worth argueing with because you're pulling shit out of youa ss</br>  <br> gacha <br> crows are birds <br>I think the crow fruit user might just be a Gatchaman.</br></br></br>  <br>The thing is, theres about a hundred characters in that spread. Some of them have only appeared in the background in some panels. Some you wouldn't have ever noticed and there they are with younger designs.<br><br>You know full fucking well that everyone on that page has a name and a fully fleshed out backstory. The man's a fucking machine. No doubt about it. The story and the sheer amount of characters is fucking huge and it's still getting bigger.<br><br>It's no wonder that with that kind of commitment it goes on hiatus every few weeks. He still gets like 3 hours sleep a night. Which is up on the 2 that it used to be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and you would prefer Oda to change his entire plot to accomdate this one character that's not even the main protagonist? <br>He planned the story from the very beginning, for the most part. Sabo was planned for longer, this much is evident if we are to believe these interviews quoted in this thread.<br><br>I did not say that Oda should change the entire story to fit in Sabo retroactively or something. I am just saying it would have been better if it was different in a way that Sabo would fit in more smoothly. It isn't like that, and that's a shame. I accept that, I simply don't like it.<br><br>I forgive Oda, don't worry. I am not going to spend the rest of my life crusading against One Piece on the internet or some autistic shit like that. I am more than often surprised how well he is writing, from a long-time viewpoint. It's just that this instance, I did not like and think it could have been better. That is it. Am I not allwoed to express that opinion?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nah you said retarded shit and you were proven wrong at all the things you said as argument. That's what it means to lose an argument.</br>  <br> He still gets like 3 hours sleep a night <br><br>Jesus, I get like 10-12 hours of sleep and I still feel like shit, I wonder how it must be like to have 3 hours of sleep and then you need to work on OP for the next 21 hours, fuggin dedication.</br></br></br>  <br>1. You're an idiot if you think Morias shadows can actually be ridden on.<br><br>2. The shadows don't talk.<br><br>3. Moria was at Marineford.<br><br>You are wrong, you are a troll and I'm done with you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Naruto invented characters who throw meteors XD <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br> I forgive Oda, don't worry. I am not going to spend the rest of my life crusading against One Piece on the internet or some autistic shit like that. I am more than often surprised how well he is writing, from a long-time viewpoint. It's just that this instance, I did not like and think it could have been better. That is it. Am I not allwoed to express that opinion? <br>We need more people like you in these threads.<br><br>I'm totally with you, man. When I read the chapter I was pretty ambivalent to the entire idea of Sabo's amnesia and I still am now. I don't really mind what the reason for him not being at the war is but I agree that it's not the best or most water-tight of reasons but there we go.<br><br><br>I usually get between 5 and 7. Right now I'm on 4 and a half and I'm dying - but I'm not concentrating on drawing one of the world's most popular manga series. The man is a fucking machine. I have no idea how he does it. It's been 18 years now! He wan't to take a break every few weeks? Fuck. I don't know how he made it this far on that kind of schedule. Whatever it takes to get him to finish</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>1. If the shadow can literally touch people an dopject there is nothing against that retard.<br><br>2. It was never stated nor suggested that they can't.<br><br>3. Which is basically meaningless, because you are still a retard. I said it twice already the revs obviously have real crows and moria's. Those that appeared when moria was at marineford are obviously real crows as moria joined the revs after marineford. Those that Sabo ride on are moria's. learn to read.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whatever makes you sleep at night.</br>  <br> 1. If the shadow can literally touch people an dopject there is nothing against that retard. <br><br>Fair point.<br><br> 2. It was never stated nor suggested that they can't. <br><br>See what I mean, pulling shit out of your ass in your own headcanon.<br><br> Those that appeared when moria was at marineford are obviously real crows as moria joined the revs after marineford. <br><br>hahhahahahha holy shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, at least for people that could care less about Oda's usage of cliches. I mean, I'm obviously an opfag, but I have to admit, there's plenty of shounen cliches in one piece already.<br><br>I would've hated to be given an explanation where the plotholes derived from it would always be in the back<br>of my mind.</br></br></br></br>  <br>here's you reply, because even after losing the argument you still have to get that attention don't you, you little bitch?<br><br><br> See what I mean, pulling shit out of your ass in your own headcanon. <br>Show me where it says that they can't or that moria can't through them?</br></br></br></br></br>   all the fourteen year olds wake up and immediately swarm the thread <br>Well fuck. Kids during the day and faggots during the night. Is there no place for OP discussion anymore?</br>  <br> here's you reply, because even after losing the argument you still have to get that attention don't you, you little bitch? <br>Why do you still reply to him? Having the last word wont give you any credit points with any of us.</br></br>  <br> learn to read. <br>Not who you were replying to but you're a fucking idiot. You don't understand One Piece, you don't understand Oda's style, you don't understand the world and you definitely don't understand the characters.<br><br>It's not Moriah. Moriah's theme straight through is Bat's. These are crows. Crows have been seen quite a few times as a motif with the revolutionaries. We don't know any particulars about the crows. Sabo is a revolutionary. Sabo somehow managed to ride and communicate with or someone controlling these crows. Shadows don't talk. Doppleman doesn't talk. Brick Bat doesn't talk. Shadows need bodies to talk. It's not Moriah. It's simple.<br><br>The fact that they're crows and not bats is the dead fucking giveaway.<br><br>What you have, is a severe case of wishful thinking. It would be great to get Moriah back and I'm sure he'll return but it isn't here and isn't now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're actually being persistent with that shit, congratulations, you're worse than that guy who saw a fairy tail reference in Sabo having dragon themed attacks involving fire.</br>  <br>Because he's a child. Kids ALWAYS have to have the last word.</br>  <br>why do you care?<br><br><br> Moriah's theme straight through is Bat's. These are crows.  <br>literally nothing suggest that he can't create crows and joining the revs would be reason enough to do so</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We can start early, if you want.</br>  <br> Women can't use haki <br> Fujoshit Law/Penguin/Dellinger/Roci/Robin posting <br><br>Can't fucking escape it. Yesterday morning's thread about the Moon/D theory was the best we'd had in weeks though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that's why you're still involving yourself amirite?</br>  <br> why do you care? <br>Because you're shitting up the thread if you reply with nothing but snark.</br></br>  <br> shitting up the thread <br> discussing is shitting up the thread <br>You better not be one of the fujoshits or trapfags</br></br></br>  <br> literally nothing suggest that he can't create crows and joining the revs would be reason enough to do so <br>Right back to the start, you don't understand Oda or the characters. It's Moriah's thing. No one changes motif in One Piece. There's nothing to suggest that Luffy won't get rid of the Straw Hat next chapter and change the crew's Jolly Roger but it won't happen because it's his theme.</br></br>  Aw shit. Luffy even smiled before almost dying here. This read is fun once noticing all the little things.<br><br><br>I know. It's fucking mind-grating. I'd love to talk about theories and what we think will happen in the future, albeit reasonably and without the obligatory forced stupid event that one sole anon believes will happen to the core of his being.<br><br><br>I'm not the one arguing with you. Both of you are at the same low level of intelligence so it is fitting you attract each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> without the obligatory forced stupid event that one sole anon believes will happen to the core of his being <br>Will Rebecca join the crew ?</br></br>  <br>H A K I</br>  <br> It's Moriah's thing. No one changes motif in One Piece. <br>Yeah because every villian remained a villian right? No one in one piece moves forward, because everyone always stays the same, amirite?<br><br><br> I'm not the one arguing with you. Both of you are at the same low level of intelligence so it is fitting you attract each other. <br> I-I'm not a kid like you guys, but let me involve myself, j-just because I'm better than y-you <br>kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here we go Satan can't be wrong</br>  <br><br>Ah but you have to see the difference though. Oda loves to draw One Piece. Like, literally loves to do what he's doing. He wants to keep doing it more and more. It's like he's obsessed. That's why he can keep at it, day after day, with little regard to his health. I'd probably be right in saying that most of us don't love our work as much as Oda loves his. His own creation is keeping him going and putting him in the hospital. <br><br>It's kinda weird/cool when you think about.<br><br><br>Nah man, I agree. I'm just glad we got an explanation that covers all bases instead of a wild goose chase that arrives at the same finish line with nothing much to add.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Zoro asks Oda a question <br><br><br>:-(</br></br></br>  <br>Fights were always shit and riding on willpower, haki only made that more obvious and visible, it didn't change anything really.<br>Nice trips Satan though.</br></br>  <br>Come on now. I was specifically refering to this post: <br> here's you reply, because even after losing the argument you still have to get that attention don't you, you little bitch? </br></br>  <br>holy shit it's like 4 people if not 5 taking turns telling you to shut up and your main guy you've been arguing for almost an hour now.<br>How dense are you?</br></br>  <br>Oh fuck! Hell of a catch! I never even mentioned that one before<br><br>  I'd love to talk about theories and what we think will happen in the future, albeit reasonably and without the obligatory forced stupid event that one sole anon believes will happen to the core of his being. <br>I swear, no one else has talked about Monet in fucking years. That needs to stop. Her death scene was fucking great.<br><br>I still really like the WG made the world in their own image theory. Used the weapons and various other methods to reshape the world to hide whatever they could. Excellent way of explaining away the Red Line and the strange magnetic poles and weather of the Grand Line.<br><br><br>Didn't say he had to stay a villain. He just wont start making crows instead of bats. It's not Moriah.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw your favorite author has this same drive and momentum <br> such as writing one sequel and accidentallying a sequel to that in the process <br> multiple series that are connected in the same literal universe <br> gonna be like thirty years before it's all complete though <br>And that's with him going FAST.<br><br><br>Of course I forget to upload my image.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We already know Morias dream is to become Pirate King, so there's no way he'd join the revolutionaries. It's more likely his outlook on life has changed and he won't rely on subordinates to reach that dream but rely on himself instead.</br>  <br> holy shit it's like 4 people if not 5 taking turns telling you <br>are you literally retarded?<br><br><br> He just wont start making crows instead of bats. It's not Moriah. <br>wow good argument<br><br><br> so there's no way he'd join the revolutionaries. <br> WG tries to kill him <br> yeah no he better stays a retarded pirate instead of fucking them back guise <br>no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Haki combats Devil Fruits.  <br> Satan confirms Haki is bollocks. <br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br> :-( <br>Don't be sad anon, I was just trying to be funny while simultaneously confirming something.</br></br>  <br>Oh absolutely. The man can't fucking sleep unless the details on Luffy's fist or the shading on his leg are EXACTLY right.<br><br>You can tell how much he outright loves this manga. It's like what was mentioned earlier in the 691 Film Z spread. Everyone there has a name, fleshed out story and history no matter how small or background they are and you know it.<br><br>I will never put anywhere near as much effort into anything I love.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Shachi.</br>  <br>I'm just glad Oda truly loves it.<br><br>Waiting for GRR Martin to finish A Song of Ice and Fire is just dumb, the dude types with only one finger. Same goes for Togashi who just does not give a shit about HxH or his fans. Fuck them, praise Oda.</br></br></br>  <br>This is the fourth time I've read the series and I'm purposely going slow and methodically to catch all the little quirks, the foreshadowing, lore, everything. I wish I could move a bit faster but I don't want to skip either.<br><br> reshape the world <br>Don't forget Oars, the continent puller, either, and his entire race. <br><br><br>I knew you weren't serious but I think  R______fag  is one of the worst shitposters I've ever seen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Becoming Pirate King would put a much stronger blow to the government then joining the revolutionaries you dickhead.</br>  <br> Worthless warlords are all lazy fucks who do whatever they want or keep getting their ass kicked by a silly rubber man <br> Emperors have started doing whatever they want, one being and ex-warlord <br> Admirals keep leaving the navy because of Akainu's poor leadership <br><br>JUST</br></br></br></br></br>   Gekkou Moria and Luffy say that Sanji has silver hair <br>What</br>  <br> Waiting for GRR Martin <br>I fell into that trap once. Read better Fantasy, anon.</br></br>  <br> wow good argument <br>You clearly don't understand One Piece, Oda or the characters so just stop. There's no winning with this.<br><br>Tell me why in your mind it absolutely has to be Moriah and cannot be anyone else. Sell us. You're so resolute in this that whatever has sold you on the idea must be fucking concrete.<br><br>What absolute evidence has brought you to this grand conclusion of yours?<br><br>It literally could be anyone else.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I fucking wish he would take a proper hiatus though. Shit, at least like 3 months. Just give him time to get some proper sleep. During then, he can still draw some stuff and have a bulk ready when the break is over. After that, he can take it easy because he doesn't have deadline issues.<br><br>Never will happen though  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>I am, I'm enjoying Robin Hobb a bit at the moment but I know she's not for everyone.</br>  <br>yeah because becoming the pk is so much easier than joining the outcast<br><br><br> You clearly don't understand One Piece, Oda or the characters so just stop. There's no winning with this. <br>nope you are a butthurt monkey, saying that a theme can't change is outright suggesting that everyone is meant to be the person who they are when they are introduced which is wrong you retard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They give him a break like once a month now. Like at least one mandatory week a month but I don't know if he adjusts his sleep schedule during that week or what.</br>  Why do the world nobles have so much power when (presumably) they have no powerful personalities among them? Sure, making up a powerful empire and placing yourselves on top as decadent assholes might work in real life, but it's another thing when the world is running over with ridiculously powerful individuals, but they still serve the world nobles without hesitation. Even if the marines and such exist to protect the world from pirates, the nobles aren't necessary. So what hold do they have on all the powerful people working below them?  <br>Ah yes! I remember you from earlier. If you were in that D thread yesterday, I was the guy with the Greg info.<br><br>That's a really good catch. It isn't anything at all but there's an interesting shot earlier in that Krieg fight where Luffy in the background makes the Gear 2 pose.<br><br>Keep sharing anything like that you find! Just make sure that the scans you're reading aren't outright awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how many pirates do you think owe Usopp their life? 8000?<br><br> wicked king <br> yfw world government's bounty refers to him as that because of all the people calling him a god </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's the same guy to be honest, that guy has a really distinctive shitposting style, taking every bait and answering to everyone seriously with at least 4 quotes per post for hours on end. This guy just post that same line once every 3 threads. It's more similar to Luccigudboy's style. Actually I think they might be the same guy.</br>  <br> nope you are a butthurt monkey, saying that a theme can't change is outright suggesting that everyone is meant to be the person who they are when they are introduced which is wrong you retard <br>Yeah. That's what I said.<br><br>You've got real problems with interpretation. Get back to the main point, buddy. Sell us on the idea. Share this glorious epiphany</br></br></br></br>  <br> no straw hat <br>Biggest problem with this speculation is it ignores the obvious relevance of the straw hat and that official sources (jump) dismissed it as fan fiction.</br></br>  <br>Got any recs ?</br>  <br> Yeah. That's what I said. <br>Yeah, because crocodile went back to alabasta to kill everyone and jinbei is still a fishmennazi who hates human right? Also Helmeppo is still a richfag who has no friends right?</br></br>  <br>Two words: National treasure.<br>I thought it was just simplistic writing befitting a kids manga before but now I changed my mind.</br></br>  <br>He is gonna die saving his brother who tried to save him in the first place of course.<br>Oh and also get his father killed while he's at it.</br></br>  <br>5 giants and maybe like 500 pirates? depends if the dressrosa pirates extend out to their crews too, like if upon hearing what he did more pirates align themselves with him  basically if taking out sugar gives him the buggy effect </br>  <br>(also drawn in the Norland the liar story book)<br>Unfortunately green bit put a large hole in Greg's theory as well, because we learned that "the enemy" reappeared 400 years ago and Norland defeated him.</br></br>  <br>Now that I think about it, I wonder if the Gorousei are the Tenryuubito's fighting force.<br><br><br>Yeah I'm still around. <br><br>Do you know what chapter it's in? I'm like halfway through Volume 08 right now and Luffy just beat Krieg not long ago. And don't worry. Got my scans off secret club and I know if I find a dud, I can check bakabt for theirs.<br>Speaking of, I thought it was interesting that Luffy managed to predict and see through fast movement this early on, almost as if that were a soru-lite movement.<br><br><br>Definitely. That guy is easy as hell to pick out of the crowd. <br><br>I wonder why Sabo keeps his pipe around. Maybe it's one of the only things he had on him when he was rescued.<br><br><br>Uh if you want a decent metaseries, read most of  Sanderson's  works.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  post yfw Baby 5fags got NTRd by Sai  <br>Even if they were 500 at most, Jet, Abdullah and the rest will make sure to spread his word everywhere. He'll get his 8000 subordinates and create some kind of ISIS. Sooner than later.</br>  <br>Wasn't this medicine similar to what Chopper found?</br>  <br> Obvious relevance of the straw hat <br>Something about fan fiction?<br><br>The article just talks about the underlying story and possible connections between the Moon, the Ds and everything in between. Could well be that the hat has more relevance but there's not much to suggest it. The kid in Noland's flashback having one doesn't really mean anything. Nobody has asked Luffy what his hat is or what it's made of so they clearly exist elsewhere in the world. Nothing to suggest that Roger/Shanks/Luffy's hat is the same one as that kids.<br><br>I think a lot of the points that have been brought up and what Greg says have a lot of weight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Knowing Oda he probably keeps drawing at half speed during his supposed break.</br>  <br>I guess we've, for the most part, only seen the ugly scum among them, to give us a general idea about their attitude towards the rest of the world. Don't forget though, Doffy was among the stronger people in OP and he was a world noble, atleast by blood.<br><br>I'm pretty sure though, they also have some other insurance of power like you suggest.<br><br>Also aren't the Gorōsei world nobles too? I'm still convinced they are among the strongest in the whole world of OP.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mansherry </br>  <br>Each of Usopp's lies turns out half true somewhere else in the world  that's how you know when Luffy dies Usopp will become captain </br>  <br>I should probably have phrased it so that you understood the sarcasm in that a little better.<br><br>Yeah. THATS what I said.<br><br>I didn't say at all that no ones personality can change. In fact a few quotes earlier I said that they could! It's their motif, their theme that will never change. It's basically saying the same thing as Hancock suddenly giving up the snake motif for crows.</br></br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder  <br>Not him but I was in that thread too discussing with you. I'm about to go to sleep but can you do me a favour and find a good source for the mythology of Uranus? I want to read about his stories and see if I can find anymore stuff related to One Piece. I'll check the thread in the morning.</br>  After re-reading the Sabaody arc I thought of something.<br><br>Rayleigh states when prompted by Robin about the Void Century knowledge "Yeah, I know".<br><br>He also said about Robin drawing different conclusions than they (the Roger pirates) each did.<br><br>Now it is not a stretch to assume, despite being cabin boys at the time, Shanks and Buggy probably know too.<br><br>I think it is possible that how they have lived the rest of their lives might be down to what they discovered - maybe even Buggy, but more so Shanks.<br><br>The whole thing with Luffy, betting his arm on the new era, Roger's will etc.<br>Dunno what everyone else thinks, but I found it interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of theories, are there any other major ones that are close in popularity? No matter how small.<br><br><br>I guess that's technically true.<br><br><br>I can't even see that happening. I know a fair few of the crew would walk away if that ever happened, after everything was said and done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They broke up after Enies Lobby and you know it.</br>  <br>Isn't the medicine Law's fruit?</br>  <br> threadly <br>Except not.</br></br>  <br> It's their motif, their theme that will never change. <br> implying taking on the revs crow motive would deny moria's own <br>no</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, since shabaody one piece have been declining in cuality. Amnesia is a shitty excuse for lazy writting and Sabo=Ace, they are the same character (Responsible big brother with high rank among powerful people). Even the power is the same, mera mera no mi.<br><br>Oda should get a hiatus and put his shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been wondering if Shanks/Buggy know the 'secret' too. What I'm more curious is if people are still alive from the crew, why they haven't told anyone or made it even the least bit public? Not even one.</br>  the cutest  <br>I think it's pretty obvious Luffy is going to die at the end of One Piece when they're finally in Raftel<br><br>Ever since gear 2nd people have been commenting about how he's pushing himself too much and shaving years off his life, there's also the whole parallel he has with Rogers, who also died at the end of his journey due to illness.<br><br>Whether the crew stays together after that is another thing though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah just found it in 64.</br>  <br><br>Probably for the same reason Rayleigh hasn't, or was only willing to give it to certain people (and even then told Robin not to).</br></br>  <br>If we want to go full parallel, Roger's last command for his crew was to disband.</br>  <br> yfw Oda drops dead from fatigue with a smile just as he finishes one piece </br>  ARE YOU READY  For what?

Reminder that Griffith is evil.  <br>Already fanslated by some chaps on /a/<br>And its monthly, for now at least.</br></br>  FEEL NO SHAME ABOUT SHAPE  I'll post this in every berserk thread until you like it!  I love Guts' face in that scene when hes like "How can you not feel anything?!"<br>I feel that feel Guts<br>Fucking little bitchboy that abused godmode after he got rekt<br>Griffith did  EVERYTHING  wrong</br></br></br>  <br>anyone going to actually typeset it though?</br>  <br>It was translated by a guy on SkullKnight.net.<br><br>http://f5.s.qip.ru/1a7On1iCK.png<br><br><br>Rakshas pls go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just imagine if this actually happened. Guts would go fucking insane.</br>  <br> fanslated on /a/ <br> implying [Evil_Genius] aren't fans too </br></br>  Did Griffith purposely sell his ass to Gennon so that years later when he attacked Doldrey his obsession with Griffith would affect his battle tactics allowing Griffith to capture the castle?<br><br> just as keiaku </br></br>  <br>Oh shit, is Griffith gonna rain hell down upon Locus and Rakshas for this shit?<br>Griffith is obviously not the one who issued the order to kill Rikert, he dont give a fuck wether he leaves or stays.</br></br>  <br>It was casuality, but how the fuck would Griffith know dude? He was just a regular human back then, he couldnt see the future.</br>  <br>I hope there is some sort of prophecy or contract Rakshas has to fulfill about never letting Griffith be hurt, and Rickert just shit all over it.<br><br>I wonder what the consequences will be.</br></br></br>  <br>they are so cute, I hope they get together soon</br>  Does Gutt´s JRPG party know about his history and he went through? I don´t fucking remember if he ever told anyone  <br>It already happened when Griffith made sweet love Casca during the eclipse.<br> Guts is literally a cuck who got raped by a nigger. </br></br>  someone explain falconia for good, please  <br><br><br>GRIFFITH!!!!</br></br></br>  <br>No they don't, besides Schierke who has seen glimpses of the eclipse in his psyche.<br><br>There's one point where Isidro sperges out about how great the commander of the hawks raiders was, he asks Guts "Didn't you used to be with a mercenary group." and he says something like "Doesn't matter."</br></br></br>  <br><br>He didn't plan that far ahead. At the time, Griffith was feeling guilt for letting a kid in his army die, and that gave him the initiative to sell his body for supplies.</br></br>  I wonder how Griffith's parents look like.    Where can I read 338 in English?   mfw waited a long time for the new chapter  <br> mfw there are people who have been following Berserk since the 90's  <br> mfw some people died waiting for It  <br> mfw I didn't wait one fucking day </br></br></br>  <br>None but Schierke. There have been hints here and there of people knowing about his past but not knowing exactly who he is, like Isidro looking up to Guts without knowing it was Guts ()<br><br>We also see in the Falconia chapters that many of the other side characters remember Guts but none of them share that they know exactly who it is, it's actually a nice bit of dramatic irony to see all of Guts' actions throughout the series come together with many people not knowing it's actually him. I imagine "soon" some of the party members will learn more about Guts' past, if they ever go to elf island.</br></br></br>  I think pick knows what happened to Guts. Hope his party finds out eventually. <br>Will mermaid girl join the party?</br>  <br>Puck*</br>  The JRPG party is going to die in some horrible fucked up way, just letting you all know right now.  <br> If they ever go to elf island </br>  Where's the anon who was translating the chapter at?<br>http://imgur.com/a/SFZqV/layout/blo<wbr>g</wbr></br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Everyone in Guts' party dies, and Griffith rules happily every after. The End. </br>  <br>Being Guts is suffering</br>  how come the manga is only 20 pages or so&gt; someone told me the new chapters were supposed to be 100 plus pages each?  <br>the 100 pages thing was just for recap</br>  <br>Its 21 pages of new material, the other 79 were the previous chapter re-released to refresh readers memory. Also its only this month not every month. Read closer anon.</br>  Isn't it mind boggling to you guys just how young Guts, Caska and Griffith are? They're only in their very early 20's.  <br>Puck knows. Not only was he getting images of what happened from Guts' mind for a while, he was also there when Guts told Rickert about the Eclipse. He's also met the five, not that they left much of an impression on him.<br><br>Schierke sort of knows. She understands the process behind the brand of sacrifice and the meaning behind it. And, like Puck, she's seen images of Guts' memory. She hasn't heard the details straight from Guts like Puck did, though.<br><br> No one else is aware.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Griffith way older than Casca though?</br>  <br>Probably 3 or 4 years older at the most.</br>  <br>Griffith is like 30, guts is 24 or so, Caska I suppose is 25-28.</br>  <br>Nah Guts is 25-30, and Griffith and he are the same supposedly the same age. <br> Griffith was quiet a bit older than Casca when he rescued her. Maybe 20? </br></br>  <br>No...</br>  <br>Owen recognized him and even spoke with him about it.</br>  <br>Griffith is 26, Guts 22, Caska 21 or 20.</br>  <br>What is there to explain? It's the ancient city of Gaiseric except bigger.</br>  <br>That is just false dimwit.<br>Guts is like 20 when he fights Griffith and leaves the band. Then he fucks of for a year, making him 21, he rescues Griffith and Eclipse happens, he then runs around for two more years making him 23. Further journeying all over midland BY FOOT, which takes a long ass fucking time mind you, would make him close to 24 or so now.<br><br>Caska is saved by Griffith when she is like 12 or something, and Griffith is already an adult. Following the same timeline Griffith should be above 30 years old by now and Caska is older than Guts or so we can presume, making her atleast 25.<br><br>How the fuck do you reach the conculsion that they are that young?</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> How long do you think the manga will go on before it goes on a fucking hiatus again? <br><br>When we get the next boat.</br></br></br>  <br> put your grasses on <br>eberytiem</br></br>  <br>I keep seeing this picture of Locus, is it from the new chapter?</br>  <br>yes<br>he craves griffiths bp</br></br>  <br>Yes, and it makes one hell of a template. You can literally add anything and its fucking gold.</br>  anime is gay and you should feel gay  Great monthly releases of ABSOLUTELY NOTHING    <br> insulting people about an entirely speculative topic <br> thinking you make accurate predictions about characters in medieval era manga, let alone their ages.  <br> Not thinking all the obvious shit you posted didn't occur to the anon you replied to <br> thinking Casca was that young when Griffith saved her.  <br><br>Stop.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You preferred biannually?</br></br>  WHERE'S MY TRANSLATION  <br> not reading the thread <br>heh</br></br>  <br>It was a shit chapter anyway</br>    <br>TOP KEK</br>  <br>What would you have done, my man?</br>  <br>Not botched my suicide attempt.</br>  <br> Casca gets her mind back <br> chooses Griffith and spirit kid <br> Griffith rejects her because muh kingdom <br> Casca becomes an hero <br>   Guts becomes an apostle and kills everyone </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>this, are the raws out at least?</br></br>  <br> translation of a translation <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br>    <br>They already have too many party members. Someone's gonna die.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah, we've only established that Falconia just randomly contains devices and technology from other great cities like ROMAN FIRE HOSES* and shit and is a perfect place for engineers and other kinds of great thinkers to live in.<br><br>I'm sure that won't be important later on.<br><br>Also: the battle of the prostitute idols for Rickert's D has begun.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you had a behelit, there'd be no way you could successfully kill yourself before being presented the choice of initiation into the Godhand or eternal damnation. Guts will also have to make some kind of decision down the road because he has his own. It was inevitable. <br><br>Now choose, faglord.</br></br></br>  <br>Then you tell me how old you think this girl is.<br>She has just developed tits as you can see, and I refuse to believe she is older than 13 at most.<br>Prove to me that she was older than 12-13.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Guts take his behelit from an apostle? Does it actually make it count as *HIS* behelit?</br>  <br>His D belongs to Erica</br>  Puck will use the Behelit.<br><br>Save this.</br></br>  <br>They could have had it all ;-;</br>  <br>He's in possession of it, hasn't lost it, and I'm sure it can activate more than once.</br>  This thread needs more Schierke.  <br>miura pls</br>    <br>Berserk needs more Schierke butt.</br>    <br>Just because he's holding it doesn't make it his, he may very well be holding onto it for someone else.</br>  <br>10.5/10</br>  translations when  <br>Thread needs more<br> Corkus </br></br>  <br>only a few times I was so glad when a character died</br>    <br>Oh you want act rike that? I go pray aidorumasuta for 3 more years</br>  <br>Corkus was nice to have. The band was too perfect.</br>    <br>I can see something like this happening for whoever's on that boat. Something terrible happens, most of the crew are dead, and it rolls into someone's hand as they're coughing up blood via impalement. I'm thinking Casca who's so out of her mind being impaled would cause her to freak out a ton. I think since she was mind broken she hadn't had so much as a scratch until Guts gave her that boob bite.<br><br><br>Judeau was my favorite. <br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey fuck you man</br>  <br>It's  Casca's  </br>  <br>was Corkus jealous of Guts?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Goddamit</br>  <br>No he was just pissed Guts couldn't just settle and enjoy the good life they earned as the Hawks but instead had to go and ruin it for everyone. He felt like Guts was acting 'too cool' or too good for that life and resented him for it among other things.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense. But Guts was just trying to be Griffith's equal. To have his own dream, to tread his own path.</br>  Can we get some respect for the Tapasa that not only pasted Raksas with that column, but threw it in anticipation for where he would rebound to.<br><br>I mean, before those guys couldn't even land a punch on him.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy fuck keep em coming. Ill try to retrieve my sides from orbit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> come into thread late <br> see template <br> make pretty much this exact image <br> scroll down and see your post <br><br>motherfucker</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guts wouldn't have ruined it for everyone though, the band had become nobles and ended the war. They would probably never have to set foot in battle ever again, so Guts wasn't needed in that regard, which is all Corkus ever saw him as useful for. He was just pissed that Guts would even think about leaving what he assumed he had been fighting for all this time. When he found out Guts real goal of matching Griffith he completely tore into him because to him Griffith is completely unbeatable and the very notion sickened him. <br><br>There was also a shit tonne of insecurity.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont get it.</br>  <br>look up Tommy Wiseau</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DxW<wbr>kfJ4uvV0</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah and he hated that too. He felt, like a lot of people maybe even including Guts at some point, that to try and stand shoulder to shoulder with Griffith was delusional and nothing if not conceited.<br>I'm sure there's a panel somewhere where he says something like "And who do you think you are? Do you think you're like Griffith? Ridiculous!" <br>Might have been in the tavern the night before he left.</br></br></br>  Who else thinks that in the end, the Band of the Hawk didn't mind that Griffith sacrificed them in order to achieve his dream? I remember Griffith or someone saying that the band of the hawk knew that they would eventually die because of Griffith's dream or whatever  <br>Here's one from yesterday</br>  <br>Did they look like they didn't mind when they were being ripped apart by apostles?</br>  <br>There's a huge difference between fighting for his dream and surviving to continue living. We aren't arguing the fact that they could die, but there is a massive difference between fighting in an army for glory and to attain something, and being shredded by apostles. They didn't sign up for that.</br>  <br>Corkus was a fucking rat, plain and simple. Calling him a human is insulting to humanity, he's that bad. Fucker got his friends killed, tried killing guts, kept trying to add salt to his wounds and was generally a piece of shit all around.</br>    <br>Also the exploitable with no logo</br>  <br>I always saw him as an odd type of tsun tsun. Attacking while there's confusion on the battlefield has shown to be effective, but after Casca told him to stop, he just complained afterwards and nothing else. He never struck me as hostile after that, just petty at times but didn't actually hate Guts.</br>  I literally only come to /a/ for Berserk threads, anyone else?  Let's say casca dies because of something unrelated to griffith. <br><br>Do you think guts will still try to kill griffith?</br></br>  <br>I go for the Tomo-Chan and NTR threads when they pop up but Berserk is the only "real" series I go on /a/ for.</br>  <br>Thats not exploitable, this is.<br>Gotta keep it transparent son.</br></br>  <br>of course you mongoloid. It still wouldn't change the fact that the Band of the Hawk is still dead because of Griffith.</br>  Haven't read berserk in over a year.

He was just a lonely guy.</br>  <br> spoiler <br> mfw <br>The rage from fans would probably set Japan on fire.<br><br><br> raped by a hot chick apostle <br> Guts then has sex with it later on </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  someone please explain falconia  I think berserk will end with a paradigm shift people no longer believe in magic so the godhands and shit will no longer have power. <br><br>I just hope schierke survives.</br></br>    I can't help but feel like Guts is the bad guy in this series now.<br><br>I mean Griffith built a utopia, where both apostles and humans can coexist, he drove out those muslim demons from the lands, he did more for the people than Guts has ever or will do.<br><br>At his point Gut's revenge plot to kill Griffith is just petty and childish, if he ever gets on elf island he should just stay there</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't look like he cares about Griffith as much as he cares about fixing Casca.</br>  <br>Yes but once fixed what will he do? We all know he's not just going to call it quits then and there.</br>  <br>He'll just stay with Casca in Elf Island, unless she goes with Griffith as a traitorous bitch or kills herself because she's too traumatized.  And I think that's exactly what is going to happen... </br>  <br>I would hardly call what the apostles and humans are doing right now 'coexistence,' nor would I say I know for sure what the end of Griffith's lust for power entails.<br><br>Unless his motive was purely benevolent, which I doubt it is, I have no cause to crown Griffith a good guy.</br></br></br>  <br> where both apostles and humans can coexist <br>Except not really. See Rickert freaking out over the apostle's stadium. Also Zodd has to smack some of them around when they think about eating people. It's not so much as coexisting as it's just them tolerating each other because Griffith said play nice.</br></br>  <br>do they have to eat people though? what stops them from eating animals?</br>  <br>Seriously though, can anybody else download the Schierke mod or is it just me?</br>  <br>kek'd</br>  <br>Inhuman taste. Humans, in most fantasy settings really, have a distinct taste that makes them the best food for monsters, also humans can scream. Animals can cry out in pain, but it probably doesn't compare to the screams and cries of 100 people. But that's just speculation based off what 2 apostles said when claiming it'd been so long since they tasted human flesh.</br>  So, can Guts even have a decent ending for himself? I feel like he's going to submit to the beast to kill Griffith and ruin everything  <br>He could, but causality won't let him</br>  <br>He's fucked for life anyways with the brand, we all know there is no way in hell he can kill griffith or any Godhand, the manga is going to end with him dying at Griffith's hand</br>    <br>I think Guts is just cursed with living the longest, most horrible life ever. He'll most likely end up immortal some way or another and forever alone. Or the next Skull Knight.</br>  <br> we all know there is no way in hell he can kill griffith or any Godhand <br>hasn't it been implied the armor may one day turn guts into something like skullknight?</br></br>  <br>Can you tell me one thing, who the hell drew that? Was it Miura?</br>  <br>and how many godhands has skullknight killed?</br>  <br>The one Griffith had to replace</br>  <br>Skullknight can't kill any God hand either, he just seems like he can't die but he's not all that powerful he can barely handle zodd</br>  <br>And the Skull Knight was very capable at killing a God Hand, right?</br>  <br> being this pleb <br>It was pixiv user no. 37799736</br></br>  <br>How does that work considering Guts could probably take Zodd with the armor</br>  <br>The NTR threads are the worst thing about this board.</br>  <br>I think he's eventually going to become a God Hand, honestly. Casca is going to end up brain dead forever, so he sacrifices her to achieve godhood and kill the others.</br>  <br>why?</br>  <br> considering Guts could probably take Zodd with the armor <br><br>We don't know that for sure, he held his own vs big snake cannon apostle with the armor but didn't kill him I assume out of all of Griffith's new apostles Zodd is the strongest</br></br></br>  <br> tfw Rickert was implied to die in the anime <br>That fucked me up before i read the manga.</br></br>  <br>He's branded so he can never be godhand, That one tits godhand said something about how great it would be if he could join them but then she said something about how much of a shame it was because he was branded</br>  <br> Zodd could take out these guys <br>Not too sure about that.</br></br>  <br>Except they literally said <br> that he's not fated to be one of the God Hand.</br></br>  Why is Luca so incredible? Best girl.  <br><br>I will give those bulgy fuckers respect with you, anon.</br></br>  <br>Not that anon, but what the fuck does "ordained by the laws of fate" supposed to mean? Just "no god hand for this faggot"?</br>  <br>I re-read the entire arc since I watched the anime first so I can forgive it. Some things, like Puck, were just taken out because it wasn't getting a season 2. The one thing they should have kept in would be Zodd since I was honestly confused when he appeared to give Guts that sword.</br>  <br>He can still be an apostle</br>  <br>It means "God didn't plan it that way". At this point it's very clear that for the Hand of God what "God" wants to happen and what is going to happen are the same thing, if only because they'll make sure of it.</br>  any one here like mount and blade?  <br>Is that vanilla only?</br>  <br><br>I think Zodd could take em, although is size is confusing at time.</br></br>   Can't find decent scans <br><br>god the one i find is such shit quality it physically pains me to look at</br></br>  did he get off the boat  <br> _no </br>  <br>this.</br>  <br><br><br> you can literally put anything and its pure gold <br>keep em coming</br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of get the feeling that Guts' actions aren't/won't be bound by fate. <br>It's a manga, he's bound to break the rules.</br></br>  The only way for this manga to end properly is for guts to go back in time in the demon armor as his own version of skull knight And stop himself right before him and griffith fight.      <br>Because blushing tomboys are cute and the vanillafag's reactions are priceless.</br>  <br>fuck anon you're golden</br>  <br> vanillafag's <br>and that is?</br></br>        <br>Best one yet</br>    This Locus shit is literally the best thing to happen so far. Spread it far and wide, anons.      I can't think of anything clever, but that doesn't stop me from making these.  I'm surprised I haven't seen an Onani Master Kurosawa edit yet.  <br> Band of the Hawk not Band of the flacon ok <br>Heh.</br></br>      <br>Skull Knight is never serious with zodd though. Everytime they fight, he beats zodd down without being scratched and then zodd breaks into laughter and tells skull knight it was a good fight and they go their seperate ways. Theyre basically chums, I bet they go to the same bar.</br>  <br>Where did you get such a good translation of the count arc? I had to read literal shit.</br>  <br>mangasee is good if you don't feel like downloading</br>  guts could probably easily kill zodd with the armor.    <br><br><br>Here you go /a/nons<br>https://bakabt. me/torrent/162057/berserk-scans</br></br></br></br>    <br>this one is the best holy shit</br>  what if guts party gets off boat but then has to get on a flying boat?   spoonfeeding  <br> facebook tier memes <br> endless shitposting  <br>Why haven't Berserk threads been banned yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Making OC is a bannable offense on /a/ these days, huh</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon, i've been a complete shitter and reading it online.</br></br>  <br>What if he gets to elf island only to find out they have moved and has to take a boat back?</br>  <br>people like you are the reason /a/ is shit</br>  <br>what if elf island is a giant boat?</br>  <br>No problem anon, enjoy</br>  <br>not moe enough for you?</br>  <br>Berserk threads are great containment threads for /v/ filth much like dragon ball threads</br>  <br>Isn't what Griffith is doing right now part of the keikaku to bring about the age of darkness or whatever?

Good quality too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean in general. And in this thread you're not even talking about the chapter. Most of the thread is spam of that shit tier OC.</br>  <br>I see a lot of discussion here indeed.<br><br>You are just too retarded, nitwit.</br></br></br>  Anyone else already missing this awesomely glorious bastard? I wouldn't mind if Guts and co still stayed on the boat for 2 more years as long as we could have chapters with this guy featured in.<br><br>Also, how did he become an apostle? What you think he sacrificed? Why's he blind? Why does he like to stay alone even among other apostles? Why's he so friendly with Sonia? Why didn't he join and swore allegiance with Griffith along with Zodd, Locus, Grunbeld and Rakshas? Why does his bow seem to have a life of its own? Was he on the Eclipse? Is he going to shoot down Dragons with his awesome wolf-head crossbow in Fantasia? Will Sonia get to ride him again? Is he similar to Guts in some aspect? Do you think he will also have a team of archer apostles with reversed centaur-esque forms like himself, akin to Locus and Grunbeld's divisions? Where, how and why did he learn to play the lute?<br>And finally, what was he hunting in the forest for days when he said that he finally became a beast in the story he told to Sonia?</br></br></br>  <br><br>My  headcanon  is that Zodd used to be the Guts to Skullknight's Griffith, except in that version Zodd is the one who used a behelit to sacrifice his comrades and Skullknight ended up having to live in the penumbra or whatever its called while Zodd destroyed his kingdom.<br><br>Which is what role Guts will ultimately have to fulfill in the great IoE's keikkaku  unless the great ultimate battle of ultimate destiny is resolved with griffith and guts hugging it out just to spite the god hand </br></br></br></br>    <br><br>I thought he was just a moomin reference.</br></br>  <br> headcanon <br><br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  You can't shop Locus into everything.    <br>Damn that aspect Ratio, but I like the Locus over Locus.</br>    <br> Why's he so friendly with Sonia? <br>Might have something to do with her personality. Chances are he sacrificed someone who acted like her and he doesn't mind her being around. Or rather, that's how it usually goes. Also, he's rather handsome looking in his transformed state instead of being an absolute monster so I'm going to assume there was some tragic romance going on in the past. Handsome characters always have a romance.</br></br>  <br>Oddly literal.</br>  I have no idea what Im doing  good meming lads  All this goddamn fawning over the hawk is just making me fucking sick, and now apostles are fighting alongside humans. <br><br>I finally caught up with the latest chapter, and looks like guts have absolutely no hope to settle his past with him now, specially considering that he is just forgetting the whole eclipse thing happened or just straight up accepted his jrpg band is better than the past.<br><br>I can see him joining up with the elf king and whatever other mystical beings are left to take on against Griffith as soon they realize the world is pretty fucked now with monsters swarming everywhere. Griffith got his kingdom, so what happens now? He is going to unleash his pet monsters to feast on the world or will the godhand attempt to resurrect their boss or whatever?</br></br></br></br>    <br>I always imagine him playing the passionate version of blood and guts when hes chilling by himself.</br>  Will she join the crew?  <br>Fucking hell what are you doing to my boner?</br>    <br>Just looked that up and it seems to be some finnish cartoon characters. How are they related?<br><br><br>Interesting thoughts. For some reason, i'm leaning to think his sacrifice might not have been human, much like the egg apostle. He seems differentiated for some reason, whether it be his behaviour, nature and/or mannerism. His strange bow and the fact he seems blind, and how that could correlate with his completely unnatural accuracy on his arrows makes me think that ability ws what he aimed for when he sacrificed something.<br><br>I wonder why he's alone. Was he like that before, or did he become that way after becoming an apostle? I'm also leaning towards the former. He's so mysterious.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> loli <br><br>She's in</br></br></br>  <br><br> sacrifice might not have been human <br><br>I wonder if that's why some Apostles seem to not suffer from bloodlust or at least be able to keep it tamped very well (like Zodd). Apostles have to sacrifice what is most precious to them, which for most people is probably other human beings. But maybe if the sacrifice is something intangible or value based they don't suffer from the blood lust.</br></br></br></br>    <br>He could have also been one of the magi types and "sees" with od. His mannerisms are reserved which I think would be fitting for someone who understands everything around him because magic learning as a human.</br>  <br>So maybe he sacrificed his sight?</br>  <br> tfw Casca will never be regain her memories <br> tfw another Apostle ceremony will happen <br> tfw Slan will never pin down Guts in front of Casca and rape him in front of her </br></br></br>  <br>Casca would sacrifice Farnese right? Cant sacrifice Guts twice.</br>  <br>Skullknight mentions that time doesn't flow in a circle, but more like a spiral. Hinting that they're moving towards some conclusion</br>  <br>Seems like a useless sacrifice if he developed the perfect skills he has. Unless he has permanent nightmare vision like berserk Guts.<br><br><br> tfw Slan will never pin down Guts in front of Casca and rape him in front of her <br>So I'm not the only one who wants to see Guts get raped again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see real rape this time.</br>  daily reminder that casca is the perfect waifu  <br>Women cant rape.</br>  <br>So that's how they are related heh? I was thinking more along the lines of his canine/fox/wolf form, and Guts has a sort of aspect that often shows in the form of a mad rabid dog too. Also read some interesting parallels on Sonia/Casca and how she aligned with Irvine/Guts when Griffith started giving attention to other important affairs.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, I think most, as in say, 99.99% of sacrifices are human like we would expect, but sometimes we get the odd one where something abstract or maybe even some parts of the self that are immensely valued could make for the sacrifice too. His sight seems suspicious and could well be involved.<br><br><br>Could be it. His demonic bow seems to have a magical lock on targets and the strength of his arrows seems magical sometimes. Maybe its infusing evil power in its arrows in order to make them even stronger and deadlier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No she isn't. She loved Griffith despite having Guts.</br>  <br>It was Flora who mentioned that, and it was regarding causality, not time.</br>  <br>Second reply was meant to .</br>  <br> women <br> implying she doesn't have a futa penis hidden somewhere </br></br>  <br>A female character in the group that doesn't lust after guts...i wouldn't mind it</br>  <br>Her and Guts only got together like the day before they rescued Griffith. She was in the process of changing, and would have been able to free herself from Griffith in time had she not been interrupted by the eclipse. <br><br>Without the eclipse, despite her feeling an obligation to become caretaker, Griffith would have probably an hero'd as he wouldn't be able to bear being a vegetable. She'd eventually set off to find Guts again.</br></br></br>  <br>I bet guts and griffith fucked. I bet guts still thinks about those nights because he hates the fact that the best sex he had was with his enemy.</br>  <br> ...i </br>  <br>Nah, Casca would've probably ended up killing herself. Even in their way to rescue him she was berating herself for being so careless.<br>Griffith was her whole life, and that didn't change, not even by taking away her virginity could Guts become her most precious person in her heart.</br></br>  <br> young girl <br> sings <br><br>She isnt in idolmaster but is the next best thing to it in berserk. Yes</br></br></br></br>  how long until we see non retard casca again?  <br>honestly doubt it, if anything based judeau would be the voice of reason and encourage her to do the right thing, like he did with guts</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Calm down slash</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujo pls.  I tried to ship them but couldn't. </br>  <br>when it came to Griffith Casca was anything but rational, anon.<br>Hell, she might've even get mad a Judeau for implying such a thing when Griffith was in such a awful state.</br></br>  <br> was anything but rational <br><br>except the whole part about admitting her entire dream has already fallen apart and he'll never love her like she wanted him to</br></br></br>  <br>And then she tried to kill herself? kek</br>  <br>good point</br>  <br>I think the best way for her to die would be an accidental suicide and a slow, pitiful death. Kinda like watching a puppy flail around before dying. Would really make all of Gut's efforts be in vain and would either break him or fuel his rage harder.</br>    Was Griffith actually a complete member of the Godhand as Femto, equal to the others? Is he still equal to them now that he's been reincarnated, or is he a servant to the Godhand somehow?  I can see it. Casca gets her memories back but she can't remember Eclipse fully.<br>She still loves guts, and he does his best to explain what happened, as he caresses her and holds her close, but Casca won't buy it. She just can't believe Griffith would be capable of doing such a thing, not the Griffith she worships. Perhaps he was influenced by something? manipulated? either way, it can be Casca's Griffith.<br>I think Casca would do everything in her power to try to "save" Griffith, even if it's against Guts wishes. <br>What could Guts do in such a situation?<br> be an hero </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm pretty sure all Godhand members were once human</br>  <br>Anyone else thinks Femto looks really fucking stupid? I mean his original hawk helmet looked pretty dopey, but now combined with the latex suit and shitty cape he looks like some sort of autistic batman cosplayer.</br>  <br>he looked best in black swordsman era</br>  <br> autistic batman cosplayer. <br>Already covered.<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/2YzHTt2Pns4?t=7m59<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>kek'd so hard</br>  <br>Nah. New Guts will slap her shit and give it to her straight. Shes just gonna deny deny deny until puck says some shit. When she sees puck shes has to believe, as well as Shierkes confirmation of the eclipes through his memory.</br>  <br>Also, calling asspull memory magic skill.</br>  <br>Why does this exist</br>  <br>to make you wet</br>  <br>Senketsu and Junketsu are like rule 34, only for fan art. There just has to be a variant no matter the series. Especially if there's the hot and cold rivals.</br>    <br><br>Guys' human form looks a lot like snufkin.</br></br>  Cant wait for the ending.  <br>Is this really what some people expect Casca to do?</br>  <br> no sword <br>Reminds me of this. I know it's not the original, but is there a Berserk version?</br></br>  <br>The dub actors seem like cool guys.</br>  <br>That's just bloody great</br>  <br>Someone even made Guts for Mount and Blade.</br>  <br>Never gets old.</br>  <br>not funny anymore casualshit</br>  what happened between the skull knight and void <br>and probably the witch</br>  <br/>  <br> deepfag <br>I searched the archive and he was still posting. After that stupid fight between him (or someone impersonating him), the mods, IRC, or whatever, did he still frequent this site anyway by namefagging, because it made shitposting unbearable somehow.<br><br>Then again, we now get no name, which comes across as someone who gets religious studies degree but having a shit job and post on Berserk thread all the time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> am I fitting in yet </br>  Post favorite pages.  Are there really people that don't like Isidro?      Do we know if Berserk Golden Age is getting a fourth movie?  <br>They finished the Golden Age</br>  <br>the most we might get is a black swordsman arc movie, but that's a long shot</br>  I don't even think current animation standards can do justice to Berserk manga.  <br>these threads are full of you fags so no not really</br>      Reminder that Griffith is a kind savior  <br>Where is he taking them?</br>  <br>To hell.</br>    So what are Guts' party members classes and builds?    <br>The swirling vortex of sexual frustration and rage.</br>  Is Griffith able to see into the future still?  <br>Edited out the watermark.</br>  <br/>  <br> snufkin <br>Cool. Also reminds me of Serpico, with that rustic/sylvan vibe.</br></br>  <br> No Azan </br>  <br>You left out Isma as the bard, idol</br>    <br>Forever my favorite page.</br>  <br>What was she referring to here in "using the falcon of darkness"? How was she planninig on taking use of Griffith?</br>  <br> &amp; they say Jill's dead <br><br>HEE-HO</br></br></br>  <br> Jill's dead <br>Stupid shit of the past week or two.<br>The hair isn't even the same.</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that because he touched those souls, they're going directly to hell.<br>Anything touched by the God Hand or Apostles immediately go to hell.<br><br>So although it's a very emotional scene for these families, the dead are going to suffer eternally for that singular moment of bliss.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Jill cant be dead. Her story doesnt indicate some off screen death.</br></br>  <br>most powerful page</br>  <br> Not this one <br>I'm sad because I'll probably never experience such a feeling of dissapointment ever again.</br></br>  <br><br>Why didn't Griffith want Guts to touch him during the eclipse? I think he said something like "If you touch me I'll..." since nips can't into completing sentences.</br></br>  <br>whoever drew that needs to die in a house fire</br>  <br> And for how long do you think the manga will go on before it goes on a fucking hiatus again? <br>I'm betting on four months, then a one month break, then another three to five before it peters out again. Hopefully in that time HxH will  not update at all, so I can reach the point of not caring about it at all and be free at least. </br></br>  <br>He said "I'll never go back" or somethig like that. Gives me the impression that, by having Guts toch him, he was sealing his fate as a sacrifice and Griffith didn't want that OR by touching him, the behelit would've fallen and therefore, he would've stayed a cripple for life.<br>I don't know.</br></br>  <br> people are posting the best pages <br> I should post my favorite- <br> the first guy already covered it <br>I like you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How did you feel when you realized Casca was actually reaching for Griffith?</br>  didn't know pepe was in berserk.  <br> She still believes in griffith even after everything hes done to her <br><br>Even rickert had the sense to slap his shit.</br></br></br>  <br>But Rickert isn't literally retarded, silly anon.</br>  <br> Anything touched by the God Hand or Apostles immediately go to hell. <br>Said no one ever.</br></br>    <br>He probably means the Vortex of Souls, but alas yes, those who are caught in the affairs of the Godhand and apostles do indeed go there, as shown by Vargas.<br><br>That was said by Slan during the first major Godhand appearance if I recall correctly. 'Caught in the affairs of the Godhand and apostles' probably means souls too traumatized and consumed by negative emotions (like the hatred, and negativity that led Vargas to live a life driven by vengeance).</br></br></br>  Why are griffithfags so desperate for people to like an awful person?  <br>There you go. That said, despite what I just said in , I'd agree that those souls shown in  will probably end up there too.<br><br><br>Yup, Griffith confirms it.</br></br></br></br>  when will the chapters get online?<br><br>I NEED THEM</br></br>  <br>Is that muira?</br>  <br>that is the face of god</br>  <br>i think it is, i looked him up before posting so im assuming so.</br>  <br>Vargas went to hell because of his negative emotions, not because of his affairs with apostles. <br><br> souls too traumatized and consumed by negative emotions (like the hatred, and negativity that led Vargas to live a life driven by vengeance). <br>Exactly. And Berserk world is pretty violent. I'm sure 80% or more souls go straight to Hell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember there are pair of hands, dark and light godhands. Guts can be one of them</br>  <br>No<br>Shares his name but its not him, dont know why people post shit they find on google images</br></br>  <br>I disagree. They look pretty happy. Hell in Berserk world is an ocean of negative feelings. We can only guess, but it's heavily implied that heaven and hell are pretty much the same place.</br>   butthurt hypocritical morons despise people who like the villain that's called Griffith yet they still think it's okay to like some villains especially the ones that are apostles because they're moronic   Are berserk just edgy world, everything suffered and all that shit? Surely there are hope right?  <br>Literally what</br>  <br>please respond</br>  <br>Griffith gives people hope. He is the bad guy.</br>  <br>Here your reply, now thank me</br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>archive</br>  <br>Never felt joy turn into rage so fast before by a manga ...</br>  <br> Band of the Falcon <br>I don't give a shit if Miura wants it to be this in translation. Hawk for life. It's like Georgie Lucas and his Greedo shot first shit. Besides, if the autistic fanbase accepts weeaboos who insist the main characters names are "Gatts, Kjaskar and Griffisu" despite word of god,then Hawk should be acceptable.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but only autistic weeaboos who think they know Japanese call them Gatts or Gatsu. I don't care what you call the Band of the Hawk/Falcon, just say the character named right.</br>  <br> "Gatts, Kjaskar and Griffisu <br>This is HxH tier naming. Filename related.</br></br>   still no JUST edit with Guts <br>you'd think he's the perfect candidate for that meme</br>  anyone still here?    <br>he said how he becane an Apostle, dude.<br><br>He hunted beasts in the forest until he became a beast himself. What really happened was that he was hunting bigger and bigger pray,found a behelit from which he asked power to survive his hunt. He most likely was hunting demon wolves at that point since he's fused with one in his demon form.</br></br></br>  <br>or he's bad with people because he was in the woods hunting 24/7</br>  <br>BOAT<br>O<br>A<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Guts is gonna get fucked over, worse than the Eclipse, and that was a pretty big fuck over</br>  Has Guts gave Griffith the dick yet? There was so much sexual tension between them.  <br> I've never had anything else except my sword <br> except else <br> forget the else <br> I didn't mean the else <br> I was just kidding about the else <br>best one</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>What happend to the soldier? A double back flip?</br>  <br>Additional material for the films state that Guts was 15 when he joined the band, while Griffith was 18 and Casca was 13. This would make them 21, 24 and 19 at the moment, but because it's the films nobody wants to hear any of it.<br><br>Why does everyone state that Casca's older than Guts, though? I remember those toffs over at SK making a timeline where Guts got fiddled by wise magical negro around the same time Casca joined the Hawks, but that would make the age difference between Guts and Griffith more noticeable.</br></br></br>  <br> caska was 13 when guts joined <br>WHAT?<br>So she became the 2nd most powerfull warrior in the band of the hawks in 2 years, with ZERO prior fighting experience?<br>In a midst of seasoned mercenary veterans like Pippin and Corkus, she just learned to fight like a fucking champ in 1 year?

However, he's still weaker than Nazarick's level 100 NPCs like Demiurge or Shalltear.<br><br>Doesn't that mean that Nazarick is completely invincible?

He didn't go gallivanting around but when he did deign to do something, you can be sure everyone knew about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Does Ainz ever impregnate her to make the descendant the floor guardians all want?</br></br>  <br>Nazarick has more firepower stored on the 8th floor and the lvl100s aren't the strongest. Strongest is Rubedo, and there's another lvl100 there we don't know yet.<br>Barring all of that, Ainz still has all those World class items and divine weaponry. Its fair to say that everyone is severely outclassed in everyway.</br></br>      <br>What make PDL so powerful isn't pure strength. If it came down to pure strength, the 8 Greed Kings and the 2 Heroes could have taken him down. What PDL lacks in pure power, he makes up for with deviousness.

It would be positively glorious and  orgasmic .</br>  Asking this again.<br><br>Which is better, Funi 1080p or ayy's BS11?<br><br>Just asking since ayy's version has the logo on the top right corner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You really think two guys at the around the same level as Ivileye could possibly beat a level 100 with a guild weapon stuck on his back and countless other treasures at his disposal?<br><br>PDL is playing for the long term, that doesn't mean he wasn't capable of crushing sub level 70s like bugs. It just wouldn't benefit him since his powers are mostly soul based. <br><br>And if he just comes in and kills the two heroes who are ya know saving the world then he's the bad guy. Why would he want that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Volume 5 still has him thinking like a salaryman. Unfortunately no one in Nazarick has levels in accountant.</br>  <br>Even if he's devious would it even matter? There is no one remotely strong enough to turn against Nazarick, and all npc's swear absolute loyalty to Ainz. His best talent is completely worthless unless he can somehow trick his way into destroying the guild staff or kill Ainz himself with some WC item.</br>  <br>He probably doesn't have it but there's always the branch of tonelico. It allowed a mere goblin to wipe out dragons in one swing.</br>  <br> And if he just comes in and kills the two heroes who are ya know saving the world then he's the bad guy. Why would he want that? <br>But isn't that what happened in the end? Sure, he wasn't the one who personally killed them but he engineered their death. And considering the fact that they had, you know, just helped save the very world he claims to be protecting, he really didn't have to get rid of them unless he was still butthurt from what happened with the Kings. PDL seems like an ass, quite honestly.</br></br>  Are there any gifs or webms of the death knight hacking all those knights to pieces?<br>I was suprised they didn't just all get knocked back.</br>  <br>Could it be that World Class item? The overpowered club?</br>  <br>He also has the Floating City at his disposal. God knows what's going on there. Still might not be enough to take down Nazarick in its full glory but if he were to ally himself with natives from the New World who have relics themselves, well now that would be a different story, wouldn't it?</br>  <br>He IS an ass. That much is obvious. But we don't know whether the rest of the world blames him and that's all that matters to PDL. What's his face, the former blue rose guy who is 260 years old or some shit is his friend, and he's a former 13 hero. Ivileye is also a 'friend' as far as we know.<br><br>So PDL basically won. We don't know how he pulled it off, but he did. And well maybe he really does have a legitimate reason, like given how he's crying about how Yggdrasil magic is merging and changing the world maybe it's the Log Horizon problem where those who use wild magic and can't use Yggdrasil magic will eventually disappear or something. It's really hard to confirm the guy has absolutely no way to justify himself at this point but he's at least Ainz level when it comes to fucking people over for his own benefit.</br></br></br>  <br>That was what I was hinting at, given how Ainz clearly pointed out in Yggdrasil goblins can only reach up to level 50ish, and New World equivalents always seem to be even shittier. I mean dragons were a big deal in Yggdrasil which I believe meant they were raid bosses but maybe Ainz was just over exaggerating.<br><br>But the point is, most of the tales and myths cited over the course of the novels most likely have a bit of truth to them, even if distorted when presented to the reader.</br></br></br>  <br> but he's at least Ainz level when it comes to fucking people over for his own benefit. <br>Ain't that the truth. Anyone thinking because he can't personally match Nazarick power for power means he's any less of a threat is being a smidge bit too optimistic.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah and think about it. In Yggdrasil it's pretty obvious you can't just break someone's guild base by attacking it, otherwise the butthurt 1500 raid would just collapse the tomb from outside where they are safe from Victim. So this meant the tomb was safe from the club presumably.<br><br>What about now? If you have a sufficiently charged world savior is Nazarick gonna survive one swing?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't Ainz seem to have a feeling of vague recognition when he heard about the floating city? I wonder if it was formerly another top guild base.</br>  <br>It's heavily implied to be a guild base from the game. Don't know if Ainz personally remembers it but I wouldn't be too surprised if he did.</br>  <br>Please comeback!</br>  <br> If you have a sufficiently charged world savior <br>CLIMB.</br></br>  <br>Well his biggest advantage is that he clearly had a lot of time to root his influence and gather more WC items and such.<br><br>On the other hand, Ainz's biggest advantage is like others have said, that his posse is loyal to him. But it's not full proof as proven by not only Shalltear, but Demiurge's misunderstandings and Albedo.<br><br>Being too zealous is also something to manipulate. You don't HAVE to coerce people to betrayal.<br><br>Whether or not the author will allow PDL to one up Demiurge and Ainz though, is of course a totally different story. I mean this is my personal opinion but I don't even think PDL is the final boss. He's more like the mid-game crisis that reveals the big bad or whatever after his death.<br><br>That's only if Overlord is going generic, which so far it kinda hasn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I wouldn't know how he gets it, but sure!  He would tragically fail though cause of reader poll saying FUCK THAT KID KILL HIM </br>  <br>The only thing this guy would really have going for himself, is an alliance of weak demihumans, his own powerful items and those of his allies, and a potentially deadly floating citadel that Ainz doesn't need to assault. Unless this guy lucked out with one of the Twenty, there isn't anything worthwhile he could pull.</br>  <br> Being too zealous is also something to manipulate. You don't HAVE to coerce people to betrayal. <br>You have a really good point there. We've all wondered how the guardians loyalty would ever cause a big enough problem for Ainz.<br><br> I mean this is my personal opinion but I don't even think PDL is the final boss. He's more like the mid-game crisis that reveals the big bad or whatever after his death. <br>What makes you think so? I'm trying to imagine what the stakes would be for a "bigger bad" than PDL.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Don't forget Ourobouros or whatever is hinted at being in the new world as well. What are the chances that every creature in the world somehow managed to eat this 'translation konjac' nonsense so their descendents could gain the ability? Like how would that even work for the underwater races? Does Santa Claus exist in this world or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Well he can actually lose his cool even with his racial suppression, like when Shalltear was mind-controlled, he was so angry that every time his anger got suppressed he just got angry again</br>  <br>Do the Japs even like him?</br>  <br>If anything I kind of feel that it was used to create the special skill system used by warriors. The universal language idea makes a lot of sense too though.</br>  <br>I have a few reasons and none of them are good so feel free to bash them.<br><br> The author stated that Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL <br> All the build up towards the guild members and AInz's goal of reuniting with them gives a possibility to one of them being on an alt account, or one of the 2 people who didn't retire (we know Herohero was logged off at the guild base so he can't have snuck off even if he tried and it would be shit writing if it was him) and that's not even going into Touch Me/Ulbert or even Tabula making alts because REASONS <br> Brain gains Gazef's items, and Brain was always the more talented and now has more drive than he ever did presumably, though since I have no idea what happens to him precisely in vol 9 yet this is a shitty one and for all I know he's just a future opponent for Lizard Guy <br> I believe someone translated in a previous thread the shitty map and it showed the Holy Empire being way the fuck apart from the Baharuth Empire / Silian Theocracy / Re-Estize Kingdom so them housing a bunch of players and popping up outta nowhere is possible assuming the post was right <br> We've seen the giant ass level 85 tree and it was implied that 7 people, possibly an early group of the 13 heroes could barely beat one of it's branches; this dumb tree is from Yggdrasil so why can't a world boss have popped up somewhere? <br> Albedo / Spinel can always work as well, hell maybe the penguin was responsible for ALL OF THIS </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I figured it was used twice, assuming that once it was used it respawned in the New World as opposed to going back to Yggdrasil ya know? It doesn't have to be used by the same party after all.<br><br><br>I have no idea, but based on the current fatality rate it's better not to bet on survival.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Strongest is Rubedo, and there's another lvl100 there we don't know yet. <br>The last lvl100 is the area guardian of the Cherry Blossom Sanctuary on the 8th floor. The brief glimpse we get of her in the novels suggests that she's a miko. You can kind of see her to the left of Shalltear in pic related.<br>It's likely that she is Rubedo, which is why Ainz is willing to entrust the protection of the guild staff to her.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;The author stated that Certain Death was the Overlord of the new world, not PDL <br>That seems quite reasonable. Depends on how the author would frame the new conflict. Presumably after Ainz meets up and has a talk with PDL in a "Oh hey, guess what. You thought I was the bad guy, well here's someone worse than me" sort of way.<br><br>Is it possible that the unnatural presence of people from Yggdrasil cause the world itself to spawn stronger demihumans?<br><br> All the build up towards the guild members and AInz's goal of reuniting with them gives a possibility to one of them being on an alt account, or one of the 2 people who didn't retire (we know Herohero was logged off at the guild base so he can't have snuck off even if he tried and it would be shit writing if it was him) and that's not even going into Touch Me/Ulbert or even Tabula making alts because REASONS <br>REASONS would have to be pretty damn good for this to be plausible.<br><br> Brain gains Gazef's items, and Brain was always the more talented and now has more drive than he ever did presumably, though since I have no idea what happens to him precisely in vol 9 yet this is a shitty one and for all I know he's just a future opponent for Lizard Guy <br>Watch as Brain loses to Lizard Guy and goes back into his depression.<br> I believe someone translated in a previous thread the shitty map and it showed the Holy Empire being way the fuck apart from the Baharuth Empire / Silian Theocracy / Re-Estize Kingdom so them housing a bunch of players and popping up outta nowhere is possible assuming the post was right <br>Highly possible. There HAS to be players in the present. Like I'm positive (for which I have absolutely no basis)<br> We've seen the giant ass level 85 tree and it was implied that 7 people, possibly an early group of the 13 heroes could barely beat one of it's branches; this dumb tree is from Yggdrasil so why can't a world boss have popped up somewhere? <br>True.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hell maybe the penguin was responsible for ALL OF THIS <br>Oh god yes<br> "World Items? Who do you think it was that you met in the treasury? Pandora's Actor swore loyalty to me long ago. Don't you think its strange that you haven't activated a single World class item yet? I have all of them within my beak. You can leave this Nazarick of mine... Satoru-san." </br></br></br>  <br><br> Albedo / Spinel can always work as well, hell maybe the penguin was responsible for ALL OF THIS <br>The BIGGEST BAD was here all along.</br></br></br>  <br> Pandora's Actor swore loyalty to me long ago <br><br>OVER THE FUCKING LINE</br></br></br>  <br>They haven't talked much about the demi-human lands. Maybe they are all Gazef level and are just too far away now to give a fuck and will give Ainz a real run for his money.</br>    <br><br>Yeah, not cool, man.<br> Implying PA would ever EVER betray his creator. <br> I hope to hell it never happens. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I know its not albedo's sister but it would be pretty trippy if she was.</br>  <br>Also if you wanna go add in ALL the crazy theories, we have<br><br> Test run implying she's an automaton, therefore it's a ROBO MIKO <br> Automaton also means possibility of using Caloric Stone as a core or possibly crafting it as her body making her a world class NPC <br><br>I mean I doubt these are true, but it would explain why she's just that much better than the rest of the guardians.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone has to carry Penguin around.<br><br>Oh boy more meido the better son</br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like they have a whole other purpose that the author's going to introduce after this whole thing with PDL's settled.</br>  <br> (for which I have absolutely no basis) <br>Its pretty reasonable. I mean with how popular Yggdrasil was, and having been around for 12 years, there had to have been dozens of players hanging around for the very last day of the game. Heck, I can imagine whole guilds partying it up in game one last time. Plus people who havn't played in ages coming back just for the novelty of the last day of the game.</br></br>  You're all thinking up of crazy and grand shit but I personally think the biggest conflict here is the simplest one.<br><br>None of the speculated potential final bosses in the story posed any real threat to Nazarick. They merely serve as vehicles to further advance Ainz as a character.<br>The big bad Ainz has to face at the very end is himself. That is, a larger than life introspection summing up his entire journey so far and the genuinely final conclusion and realization he'll reach at the end of the story</br></br></br>  <br> REASONS would have to be pretty damn good for this to be plausible. <br><br>Personally I wouldn't even mind if he never meets any of his old guildies. I'm just saying Chekhov's gun might come into play. I might be slightly more accurate with my shitty theories if we had a rough estimate of how long this series has left from the author but at this point it could end in the next 2 volumes or it could be the next Raildex.<br><br><br> Eclaire was actually just an alt account that faked being an NPC all this time <br>Code Geass R2 has a new challenger!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but has it really been 12? I thought the novels said it was 10 years but I could always have just remembered it wrong.</br>  <br><br>Damn anon.</br></br>  <br> big bad was Ainz all along. <br>How horrifying.  I like it. </br></br>  <br>And then what? Does he  commit sudoku? </br>  <br>Frame this up. We might just be calling you a precog in the future.</br>  <br>And so the story ended.<br>Not with a bang.<br>But with a whimper.</br></br></br>  <br> He wakes up and discovers it was all a dream and he has to wake up at 4am and go to work. <br>Shitty ending, here we come.</br></br>  <br>W-wow.</br>  <br>The adventurer who got the  potion  has a name.  Brita, I think. </br>  <br> Overlord was a psychological case study all along <br><br>AS DEEP AS THE MARIANA'S TRENCH<br> But seriously, I like that idea. </br></br></br></br>  <br> He wakes up and finds out that the shutdown of Yggdrasil was all just a part of his dream, and he gets a message from Touch Me telling him to hurry up and get online so they can try out a new dungeon raid that was added. </br>  <br>Don't you jinx the novel, take that shit back.</br>  <br>"I want to present you who I love with the world like this jewelry box and me..."</br>  <br>Better but still shitty as long as there's someone dreaming.</br>  <br>Anyone else notice that there's someone right under Ainz, with the ghost arms.</br>  <br> Series ends with Ainz dramatically putting the entire world to the torch <br> Momon appears out of nowhere while all the npcs are shackled <br> Momon stabs Ainz with a club and saves everyone becoming the   world savior <br> The world begins peace talks and all factions try to get along <br> Area 11 err I mean the Kingdom finally gets out of the shit hole it's in while Marquis Raven bangs Lupusregina Beta who finally regained her memory <br> Albedo and Shalltear are seen in the epilogue laying on a cart of hay being pulled by horse, with a mysterious driver dressed as a salary man at the front </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I-I'm sorry. I take it back. I TAKE IT ALL BACK.</br>    <br><br>In a way, it makes sense doesn't it? Shit's crazy but it actually makes a lot of sense.<br> As long as it's not the dream TWEEST <br> Also we need a Disappearance-esque confrontation between Satoru human and Ainz lich. </br></br></br></br>  <br>If Ainz ever regained his humanity somehow I could definitely see this happen. I'm not sure how he would cope with all that torture and murder. Maybe he would go defeat Nazarick himself.</br>  Would it be possible for Ainz's npc to take his form and take over the tomb from the inside?  The final fight will be Ainz invading and defeating Nazerick himself. There is a no more difficult final boss out there. What could possibly be harder than the legendary dungeon that repelled 1500 players? Nothing. Therefore, if he truly means to make the impossible possible, that is what he needs to do.<br><br>that said, I don't know why exactly he would need to do that, but it's the only final fight that truly lives up to the hype.</br></br>  <br>Start scrounging for clubs?</br>  <br>Capping this for posterity.<br><br>Let's see just how right you are, anon.  Fuck. Now I'm going to be sorely disappointed if anything but this happens as the finale. </br></br></br>  <br>The guardians can automatically tell Ainz's presence when they see him. Even Pandora's Actor can't fool them.</br>  <br> we need a Disappearance-esque confrontation between Satoru human and Ainz lich <br><br>THIS<br><br>FUND IT</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought that was because of his intimidating skeleton aura passive.</br>  <br>Why does it make me sad that this sounds like the most plausible theory here?</br>  <br> Overlord ends when Ainz finds a super world item completely original to the new world, it grants someones true heart desire, un-restricted, un-restrained <br> Ainz is sent to an alternate Earth, exactly the same as the old one, only Yggdrasil never shuts down, and all his friends never abandon him <br> Also he encounters a bunch of newbies in the game who are heavily hinted to be human versions of all the Floor Guardians, who quickly warm up to him and wanna be friends. </br></br></br>  <br>do you happen to have the picture of that translated map?</br>  <br> the newbies are the actual children of his friends <br> shalltear and albedo still want his dick </br></br>  Posting translations of the text on these pictures.<br><br>"The Three Poiints: Sexy x Skeleton x Action"</br></br>  <br>It's not translated, it was a phone quality picture, and someone in a previous thread posted it and translated the names for us. I'm not even sure he was the original source, might have just got it off a forum or something.<br><br>Take it with a grain of salt as always.</br></br></br>  <br>No, the narrative placed it on that all 41 would have "special aura" to them, that they don't notice it themselves. Iirc at least.</br>  "Is it true I can knead breasts if I become an overlord?"  <br> kneading padding </br>  <br><br>The most human character in the story all along was the grand skeleton god deified and feared by all.<br><br>Doesn't that sound romantic as fuck? It makes for good storytelling.</br></br></br></br>  Wow look how much less shitposting there is when you don't start a thread with a bait for the OP.  <br>You clearly won the thread, so answer the real question  what happens in the epilogue? </br>    <br>10/10</br>  <br>There's no escaping your fate Ainz.</br>  <br>But will it be the human inside us or outside of our skeleton carriage? And PoV matters, will it be from Papa Bones or from the outside?</br>   /a/ in charge of writing endings <br><br>Oh fuck off /a/. I didn't want to get depressed today.<br>I just want Papa Bones to be happy.  ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Well he could always get on a boat or something with his npcs.</br>  <br>Nice boat, Overlord edition.</br>  <br> Ainz's desperation to find his friends is his attempt at holding on to his humanity.  <br>Once he acknowledges that he will never find his friends, he will truly lose his humanity.</br></br>  <br>And they lived happily ever after.  But still got off before Guts. </br>  <br> not HungryChair.jpg </br>  <br>Fuck that. Infighting between personalities never ends well. Play the mediocre Tales of Symphonia spinoff if you want that shit.<br><br> With no enemies left to focus his attention, Ainz remembers that he should be appalled if not for his undead apathy and, lest he start committing senseless atrocities, figures out how to summon Touch Me to the world to defeat him and take back the guild./spoiler]<br><br> Lunatic mode: it was actually Pandora's Actor, and Ainz used one of the world-class items in the treasury to become a more respectable monster species and elope with Albedo. </br></br> </br></br></br>  <br>i love his running animations, he's like welp bye</br>  <br> yfw the first food Ainz gets to taste again is cheap ass Japanese ramen </br>  <br> Implying they won't have space ramen by then </br>  <br>I was a little disappointed. He just starts sprinting off instead of darting away like a fucking train. Come on animators.</br>  <br>I don't know, it's elegant in its own way. Like the tide washing away a bunch of fleshy sandcastles. No rush.</br>  Still waiting for that PV.  <br>Later today.</br>  <br>Well, I just imagined him as a screaming nightmare rushing around at the speed of sound.

For some reason I always thought it was night or at least dusk during the attack. Made it a lot more menacing in my head. <br><br>His shield bashes definitely should have vaporized, if not dismembered the bodies.</br></br></br>  <br> inb4 CG black holes and angels </br>  <br>No shit. Even the knights were cgi.<br><br>Why didn't they just make the entire thing cgi then? At least it'd look consistent.</br></br></br>  <br>And leading those heroes will be the Dark Hero Momon.<br><br>I really really need this.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Flaming CG swords.<br>CG iron ball to the face.<br>CG hellfire.<br><br>Everything is CG.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think you'd enjoy CG gore anon, just take a look at Kingdom.</br>  <br>There's already cg gore. There's too much gore in this anime to be economical budget-wise.</br>  <br>The cg on the knights was really well done though.</br>  <br>I'm not fully clear, but I think in the novel the Death Knight smacked them around with it's shield and only cut the knights down when they ran for it, making it even more sadistic.</br>  <br>god, kingdom was so awful visually<br>and it bothered me that they would randomly switch to 3d animation to CG</br></br>  <br>I recall it being dusk when it was Nigan's turn to attack.<br><br>From episode 3's ending, it looks like Madhouse should be getting the mood right.</br></br></br>  <br> Too bad vols 6 and 9 won't ever be animated. <br><br>The season would already be over.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The knights were CG? if so that's really well done. I didn't even notice anything outside of the horse-riding scenes</br></br>  <br>The sun pretty much sets during the encounter between Ainz and Nigan.<br><br> After shouting, Nigan saw the fearful expression in his subordinates eyes, and recovered. Panicking in the face of such a monster, would be a very bad move. Gradually the sun began to set, engulfing the world in darkness. It felt like Death was opening its mouth, preparing to devour everything whole. </br></br></br>  <br>It looked like they were cg while in motion but hand drawn while stationary.</br>   show people getting shopped in half <br> show people's heads getting chopped off <br> censor one scene that lasts half a second <br><br>nice</br></br></br></br>  <br>It could still get worse was my meaning.</br>  <br>The guy who got his head chopped turned into CG for a few second during his charge toward the death knight.</br>  <br>Yeah, maybe he was so busy looking for monsters ,that it didnt occur to him to check if he was a monster himself</br>  <br> Kyoukai vs Houken <br> Entire battle hinges on ancient Chinese methods of manually overdosing yourself on adrenaline so that your muscle limits turn off and your perception speed multiplies <br> There isn't even bullet time to visually cue this and instead they make Kyoukai look super slow and retarded <br> This was still a better fight than Ouhon vs Rinko on horseback which was 2 CG legomen whacking each other at 2 frames per second </br></br></br></br>  <br>But didn't he acknowledge he was no longer human in vol 1 when he killed the two knights and felt nothing? And when he reaffirmed it by telling Albedo that he viewed humans like insects and then upgraded them to small animals?<br><br>I mean, if he's still in denial after that then that's fucked up, but I think the approach Ainz went was "I'm no longer human, why should my values stay human?". You are talking about a guy who doesn't regret one bit being away from his family after all.</br></br></br>  <br>And once the whole of Nazarick has brought him the jewel box.<br>He is the sole god of an inconsequential world.<br>The first and last Overlord to ever grace the realm.<br><br>At the end of the day, Ainz is the single master of his own expansive dominion.<br>He, and he alone has the final say.<br>He is destiny.<br>He is fate.<br><br>Stood atop the universe.<br><br>Only then will he realize what loneliness truly is.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And it's all a ploy for Ainz and PA playing their parts, leading the alliance against Nazarick as Momon(Ainz), EvilAinz(PA) goading the brave nuggets on.<br><br>All the while they feed the unworthy to be auto spawns and traps and Guardians (that retreat in the nick of time).<br><br>Final standoff in Throne Room where EvilAinz(PA) waits, and then fools make all nice bravado and empty tirades of justice.<br><br>And lo, Ainz walks up the throne to finish the job, with sudden revelation of PA and Ainz being of same mind and form and Ainz busts out his cards. Either submit or die.<br><br>With the NPC's and Guardians and so on applauding the farce from the sides of the Throne Room.<br><br>Nobody escapes the ballpit unscatched.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you actually read it? <br>Albedo is the one who says that about humans to Ainz, and in the very beginning he says he has no friends or family to go back to IRL.</br></br>  <br>Yes I did, and no Albedo is not the one who says it. She's the one who flat out says she would enjoy very much crushing humans, there's no way she would view them as small animals.</br>  <br><br>You know, you can meet people in real life once or two times a year (assuming that each of them lives in different parts of the country), and still lost contact when you stop playing.<br><br>I know most of the people that I had played for a long time in real life, but once the game dies out and you stop playing together, the reasons to meet start disappearing.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Or when the tomb invaders tried to trick him using his guild mates. <br><br><br>Never? He acts more and more as Papa Bones as the time goes own, but he is still has a 'human' mind. <br><br>He doesn't mind killing, torturing or that Demiurge uses human skin to create wands, but he can't stand his 'furniture'.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And when he reaffirmed it by telling Albedo that he viewed humans like insects and then upgraded them to small animals? <br>He says that so his little minion don't go around trashing everything. He doesn't mind killing, but would prefer not to.</br></br>  <br>Went back and reread it, you were right on that, but he still has no family or friends IRL.</br>  <br>What? That has nothing to do with it. He explicitly said he was incapable of feeling anything when people die. It's only when the people who die are related to him in some form, when he has attachments to them, that he gives a shit.<br><br>He slightly cared when the swords of darkness died, while he gave no shits about the innocent guys part of Iguvua's party. He was about to wipe out all the lizardmen if not for Cocytus' suggestion.<br><br>What part of this do you not understand? I will repeat this only once more. He flat out states he acknowledges that he no longer felt anything when he killed the two knights in the first fight. He didn't even feel anything for the villagers who were unjustly massacred when viewing with the remote mirror.<br><br>The only times he gives a shit about humans are when his npcs get super ruthless in their behavior reminding him there's such a thing as being too evil. Otherwise he doesn't even give it half a mind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I mixed up the family and friends with another LN, my main point though was he easily gave up his humanity (not criticizing him) despite being self sufficient and immediately did a 180 on how he viewed human lives.<br><br>I mean he even blabs on about what kind of excuses he would need to make if he needed to explain his actions to a guild member in the future, and while he is partially validated on his excuses at the end of the day he can't feel shit to begin with, which is obviously totally not the fault of being a lich and having -500 to moral aligbnment.<br><br>Like really, people seem to underplay the roleplaying stats when it's clearly something that will slowly integrate with time. Just look at how Albedo went from vol 1's MUH CREATOR WUBBED ME to FUCK EVERYONE BUT AINZ SAMA.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it probably had guts falling out.</br>  <br>I'm not saying that he cares about killing, but he doesn't want to kill if he doesn't have to. <br><br>So basically he says that to prevent this<br> The only times he gives a shit about humans are when his npcs get super ruthless in their behavior reminding him there's such a thing as being too evil </br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course he doesn't want to kill if he doesn't have to. But that has nothing to do with his humanity, it has everything to do with his pragmatism. He was considering killing Nfirea just for his ability, and he wipes out 50000 soldiers just as a show of force.<br><br>Being calculating is by no means a sign of being kind or righteous. Being calculating is simply objective, and in fact has been often called upon as inhumane.</br></br></br>    do the two sisters papa bones saved keep their memories or does he wipe them?<br><br> What happens to them?

It was being covered by the video title.<br><br>My point with the warhammer still stands.</br></br></br>  <br>Dominion is going to be shit, right guys?</br>  <br>Gazef has good taste in disciplines.</br>  How did they screw up the angels so badly?<br><br>They literally had an illustration from the book to off from. Couldn't they just have done normal winged soldiers and be done with it?</br></br>  <br>that look on papa bones like his laughing at how weak of a.trump card that is</br>   You'll never be a max level fighter and live like you're in Kung Fu Hustle or any other crazy kung fu movie   <br> CGI robot angels are cheaper and easier to make and it's not like they are relevant or anything so only autists will complain about them.</br>  <br>2d shill please leave</br>  The Dominion looks pretty neat. Better than the normal angels.  Also looks like we will have some scrub fire the iron ball.  <br> inb4 Mask <br> inb4 skelly face don't move <br>It looked fun in the manga because it has more leeway in Ainz's expressions, with his chibi face etc. It simply won't work in the anime, so the seiyu will have to do one hell of a convincing job to sound disappointed as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br> Good luck I'm behind Albedo.jpg </br>  I was disappointed in the last PV because of CG death knight, but it still turned out great.<br><br>I shall remain hopeful for this one.</br></br>  <br> mfw Papa Bones taking his mask <br> mfw Angel robots getting their asses stomp <br> mfw Gazef fight <br><br>neat</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds great</br>  <br> dat gazef spin <br><br>wat</br></br></br>  <br>Couldn't they have used the same flame effect from Demiurge's demon general and apply it to the angels?</br>  I'm going to need to cheer myself up with Overlord on Saturday to deal with this.  <br>dont worry anon its gonna be a great  CLIMB chapter </br>  <br>Maybe, maybe not. We can only hope his end of the road is fitting of his status and talent.</br>  <br>FUCK. I just want some papa bones and co wrecking that criminal organization dammit.</br>  <br>Final confrontation is between Momonga - the being taken to another world and forced into another form - and Ainz, the overlord that being became.</br>  <br> Angel curbstomping <br><br>Aww shit<br><br>tuesday cant come soon enough<br><br> Gazef being fucking Gazef <br><br>oh man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her body is daijobu?

I'm enjoying it so much, I feel like it's been at least five.  <br>I was hoping for a more guttural roar and not a dampened godzilla scream.</br>  Episode 3 and 4 would be like whiplash for the people who complained about episode 1 and 2. How ironic that 3 and 4 would probably be less enjoyable without 1 and 2 to set them up.  <br><br> angel curbstomping <br><br>Fucking amazing.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It might be because of religion. It's Funimation after all.</br></br>  <br>At least it made the worst lot drop the show. Maybe better this way if they can't be arsed to learn the background where the "finales" will base on.</br>  Was YGGDRASIL p2w?  <br>Yes, heavily.</br>  <br>No, it was p2p.</br>  <br>p2c</br>  <br> Why was Touch Me such a bro? <br><br>I bet human players shit their pants when they heard about Touch Me. An invincible guy who was in guild full of other ridiculously powerful monster players who liked to ambush human players for fun.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Monthly fees, p2w, and paying for cosmetics <br>Yup typical japanese mmorpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesnt look bad at all so basically just whoever is doing the coloring is shit</br>  <br>Why did a hero of justice join a PK guild?</br>  <br>Because people liked to bully the cute monster peeps and he like to bully bullies. Pk the pker thing.<br><br> ahem, he founded the thing and was first guilmaster </br></br></br>  <br> PK Guild <br>As far as the fan translation goes, there's no mention of them being a PK Guild. MC once said they functioned as an evil Guild though. I always thought AoG only exist as a cool secret base for the members and a challenge/raid dungeon for other player.<br><br>And Touch Me was the first guild master, he likely didn't allow the members to actively PK without a justified reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Monthly fees <br>I would be all over MMORPGs if it weren't for my aversion to paying for a game more than once.</br></br>  <br>Was Ainz Ool Gown really a PK guild? Seems more like they were a RP-focused guild, who wanted to play evil-looking races, and banded together for mutual protection. Heck, they even tried to make some ultimate dungeon of doom and gloom, just like those villains always do, and kinda wanted to get raided, which is why they spent lots of real money into pimping out the Tomb of Nazarrick.</br>  <br>Wait, aren't all of the most high ranking NPCs supposed to gather in that scene? Do you think they'll stick Albedo/Cherry Blossom Area Guardian in there?</br>  <br>I believe it was mentioned that AOG basically did targeted assassinations. They'd find out everything about their target, then lure them in with bait and kill him. I'll see if I can find the chapter it was mentioned in.</br>  <br>How awesome it's going to be? Curbstomp of gigantic levels?<br><br>Will Ainz choke a Angel?</br></br></br>  <br><br>He will.</br></br>  <br>*chokeslam</br>  <br>Well, the angels are technically "summons." Real angels look like  Victim. </br>  <br>Victim is an angel fetus. <br><br>The summons are angels.</br></br></br>  <br>So Victim grows up into a CGI robot?</br>  <br>Ainz said that he and his guild experts on ganking other players.</br>  <br><br>SWEET<br><br>Can't wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are different kinds of angels. We don't know what order of angel Victim is, he could be a winged robot, or an eldritch abomination like </br>  In Baldur's Gate, a licensed Dungeons and Dragons game, there is a female chaotic evil NPC who can join your party called Shar-Teel.<br><br>Coincidence? I think not.</br></br>  <br>I CAME.</br>  <br>I don't think they were a PK guild at first, but overtime, they got into the role, especially after other players started associating them with "evil." Mind, they were known as a "evil" guild, not a guild that went out of its way to pick on the weak. They seemed to have PKed mostly in high-level zones, and most of their quarry are implied to have some ability of fighting back. They're not ganking helpless lowbies; they fighting skilled, high-leveled, and coordinated opponents, enough that they have to plan out their assaults.</br>  <br>Maybe the author played Baldur's Gate in the past?</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bU<wbr>5xBWmPp34</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>The summoner looked much cooler than in the manga<br><br>The angels are a little disappointing. Ironically making them less human also took away some of the impact from Ainz literally choking them.</br></br></br></br></br>  I really like Renner's dad but he's honestly not strong enough to be the King. Renner outshines him in that aspect. But he's a really kind man.  <br>They are entirely different characters and its not like "Shalltear" isn't just a combination of common words anyways</br>  <br>That's what I'm guessing too, since it's too much of a coincidence.</br>  <br>I'm wondering if people's expectation became higher enough after episode 3 that they seem to be overly disappointed.</br>  <br>Then it's a shout out then. And a stealthy one to boot.</br>  <br>Anon, make the logic connection god damn it.<br><br> Overlord is based on Dungeons and Dragons <br> author of Overlord loves Dungeons and Dragons <br> author most likely played CRPGs based on Dungeons and Dragons <br> has a character called Shalltear <br> a Japanese person would pronounce Shalltear as Sharotia <br><br> Baldur's Gate is a famous and extremely popular CRPG based on the Forgotten Realms campaign of Dungeons and Dragons <br> has a character called Shar-Teel <br> a Japanese person would pronounce Shar-Teel as Sharo-Tia <br><br>LOGIC FUSION<br>SWOOOOOOOOSH<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128503767#p128520320">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its kinda awkward that i can root for the big bad to Stomp everyone</br>  You know this show isn't have bad if you imagine that this character has autism.  <br><br>Lain?</br></br>  <br>why autism; PTSD is self-evident.</br>   have   <br>He could of fixed that. Or you can just fuck have.</br>  <br>Dude, the girl is suffering from a mental breakdown and has enclosed herself in this delusion of a normal school life as she cannot handle reality. But she seems pretty stupid but innocent stupid. The world isn't suited for people like her...it's just too sad to watch.</br>  she's just pretending to be retarded  <br>She's been pretending to be retarded since the school burned down. She genuinely lost her shit for months prior to that though.</br>  i still find it really hard to believe no one from the track team was fast enough to get away, they werent even swarmed  <br>And how exactly does that help?</br>  <br>Maybe some got away, they just, you know, ran away from school for some reason? Maybe the zombies were super athletic?</br>  <br>  Maybe the zombies were super athletic? <br>That's actually a possible zombie scenario - for a short time the infected have superhuman strength/speed that can tear their own muscles and break bones, which (also rot) makes them slow shambling type.</br></br>  You do realize she's a but confirmed for it right? Like this last episode basically showed that she was off even before the zombie outbreak.  <br> imagine <br>She was a bullied friendless weirdo who was failing her classes. The zombie apocalypse is the best thing that has ever happened to her.</br></br>  <br> imagine <br><br>Even though she does have delusions because of PTSD, she definitely has autism.</br></br></br>  <br> story talks about complicated psychological disorders <br> too stupid to look up which one it might be <br> lolololol muh autism </br></br></br>  <br> have bad </br>  <br> have bad <br>You know this thread isn't half bad if you imagine OP has autism.</br></br>  <br>Autists are disgusting and should be killed.<br>They are gross, shitty things without soul and no emotions.<br>Therefore she can't be autistic.<br>Fuck autists. Slaughter them all.</br></br></br></br>  I thought she was schizophrenic  <br>It's the endless question with anything zombie related, how could they blind-side everyone during the outbreak.<br><br>In this particular case, a single zombie making its way in a locker room full of unsuspecting students is enough to get them all.<br>There weren't that many people on the tracks, mostly zombies, so it might just be the injured runaways we see getting finished off.<br><br>Also the number 1 trope about zombie movies being that nobody knows shit about zombies, they could get bitten by the injured people they were carrying., or while trying to fight them back.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Boy the first episode really took its time playing with the mascarade that everything's fine.<br>The manga keeps it short and sweet so we actually get a surprise, but this was drawn out to hell with the dog bullshit.<br><br>Also I don't know how I feel about Lesbian being here from day 1.<br>Did they think it'd be too boring with a group of only 4  hue  people?<br>Is this just a lazy way to not have to draw the mall segment and keep it in school as much as possible?<br><br>Still pretty nice</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was so they don't introduce a new main character mid-season.<br><br>They're going to flashback to the mall thing instead. Her friend is in the OP and everything.</br></br></br>  <br>For a filthy secondary who went in knowing nothing about the series, the first ep was pretty good for me.<br>I thought it was a really boring show that I was going to drop until the last few minutes, then I was "wait what"</br></br>  <br>you're implying people didn't just manage to leave the school<br><br>also it's implied first wave zombie virus was able to spread through other means</br></br></br>  <br> Anon why don't you watch this SoL, you like cute girls doing cute things right? </br>  <br>Even if you could escape from school, you're still surrounded by zombies all around in the town/city/country. You're fucked either way. Once you take away our social organization and our infrastructure, humans are literally naked monkeys.</br>  It's been a while since I haven't been spooked by an anime, in this last episode I thought that  we would see Megu-nee getting horribly chewed up right away, so I was anticipating the scene in horror   <br>At least the dog chasing scene provided us with hints that something is not 'right', so it's actually not pointless.<br>Well, I admit that the scene is a bit dragged out, but I have no problem with it.</br></br>  <br>If the anime keeps its rythm, we should get camping next episode,  then after that they'll start dropping heavy hints about Megu-nee </br>  <br>The sheer amount of different hints is actually kind of impressive.<br><br>It's also kind of hilarious though how many of them can be dismissed as "because it's moe anime"</br></br></br>   why didn't xyz <br>It's fucking zombies. You will always have to suspend your disbelief because they were never a good concept to start with.</br>  <br>But we've seen that zombies are pretty lethargic from the get go. See when Megu-nee watches that video on her phone the undead folk are moving pretty slowly.<br><br>It is beyond me how they got rekt like that. A fucking Ayaya runs around with a shovel killing zombies, surely police or jsdf could do something about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Only "virus infected" zombies aren't a good concept. The really real undead ones are.</br>  Just read a bit of the manga<br> Holy fuck, the dog was fake too? </br>  <br>He's alive in the anime. For now.</br>  <br>No, it's real.</br>  <br>But the dog is  dead  no?</br>  <br>It's dead in the manga but not in the anime. We'll see how it goes.</br>  <br>We got camping this episode, though. Next episode will be about Kei apparently</br>  <br>Nope, he's in a flashback right after Lesbian joins the school-life club.<br> He's already bitten when they find him, so he doesn't stick around long. Megu-nee uses him to study the transformation. <br>He'll probably go down the same road.<br><br>It's hardly a spoiler since such is the fate of dogs in anything zombie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>School Slice of Life nowadays stands for Taking the Lives of Schoolgirls One Slice at a Time. Those tags make me prepare for the worst.</br>  <br>Really? Most dogs I've seen just fucks off off screen once shit hits the fan, and conveniently have zombies ignore animals.<br><br> At the same time I can't even remember the names of those movies, so they had to have been terrible. </br></br></br>  Why is Kurumi being scared so damn boner inducing?  <br>Perhaps they just think there's something wrong and get too close trying to help before its too late.</br>  <br>Senpai please.</br>  <br>RAAAAAAAAAAAAPE</br>  If zombies end up going where they remember/count as important, wouldn't a secret hideout be ideal?  <br>She's boner inducing either way.</br>  <br>I, for one, am happy that good fanart of her finally arrives.</br>  <br>I love this face.<br><br>The face of absolute  confusion .</br></br></br>  <br>You know, speaking of the outbreak this episode, just how long is the incubation period supposed to be? People were turning right away here, but Kurumi held out all night until Miki got back.</br>  <br>Seems to be different for different people.</br>  <br>Sensei and that one guy at the mall held out pretty long, maybe it happens based on how much blood they lost?</br>  Shovel is the best action hero.  Why is Yuki so shit? She ruined the whole episode.  Enough with the fucking GG generals  <br>Well, Megu-nee was surrounded by zombies and likely bitten more than once, same with most other people during the inital outbreak, at least I assume, considering how nobody knew what was really going on.</br>  <br>might be different for each person<br>nastier wounds might accelerate the process<br> People were turning right away here <br>you don't know about that</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The more cute you are the more time it takes.</br></br>  <br>So Kurumi is immune after all?</br>  <br>This is my favorite so far.<br><br><br>Quiet, Yuki is a good girl.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kurumi's senpai turned within minutes.</br>  <br>I want to rape Kurumi!<br><br>And I want to be raped by her.</br></br></br>  <br>Did you take in the time it takes to get in the building and climb all the way up the stairs?</br>  So, do we know yet if Shovel has become Alice from Resident Evil?  <br>If you stick your dick into a zombie, will you become a zombie as well?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  So after reading the manga.  It's pretty clear that Kurumi's going to die. The only questions are when and where.   Too bad about the censor.  <br><br>Yeah, the guy in the mall lasted maybe half a day between the initial bite and then turning in his sleep.</br></br>  <br> Sudoku in order to prevent the others from having to kill her. </br>  <br>What about watching her get raped?<br><br>http://nijie.info/view.php?id=98357<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Then why didn't she turn immediately?</br>  <br>Not entirely. She gets the Dreaded Japanese Cold instead of turning.</br>  <br>Obviously because you have shit taste.</br>  <br>I'm never going to understand people who think that all currently unresolved problems in a story will just continue indefinitely and never be solved.</br>  <br>It's using typical zombie tropes and ignoring biology. The infection takes about 12 hours to kill you and bring you back as a zed, but if you die during the incubation period for any reason you also immediately come back as a zombie.</br>  <br>Careful not cutting yourself with all this edge</br>  <br>Future Dead Characters.jpg</br>  <br>Senpai didn't die.</br>  <br>Why do zeds want to kill people anyway?</br>  <br>So all she needs now is some chicken soup and good night's rest?</br>  How are the Gurashis ranked in terms of popularity?  <br>Especially since it's not uncommon in a story like this that the person in the clearly most vulnerable position will actually come out fine.</br>  <br>It wasn't actually that long, Lesbian went down there as soon as she came back and didn't take very long.<br> The night was tensed because we didn't know if it worked. <br>Being apparently virus based, it's bound by physiology.<br>If it's a small wound that's immediately treated, it'll take a while to kick in, whereas it'll act much faster one someone with multiple or deep bites. Or dead with no immune system to fight.<br><br>On that note, it seems there is a period after the virus takes over where they are still alive and can recover or do stuff through sheer will,  like when Megu-nee went down to the basement. <br>It's also possibly the period where they are the most agile and dangerous.<br><br>Guys remember anime watchers are lurking so spoiler your shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure he did. He died of his wounds and immediately turned. Or do you expect me to believe that the infection killed him in less than 20 mins?</br>  <br> I'm hungry but <br> I'M HUNGRY BUT </br></br>  <br>In Japan?<br>Yuki &gt;&gt; Kurumi &gt;&gt; Miki &gt; Rii &gt; Megu-nee</br></br>  <br>Given that's what the scene showed, yes.</br>  <br>Japan shit taste confirmed yet again</br>  <br>Source?<br>Didn't think so</br></br>  <br>Fucking hyped for this scene <br><br> I LOVE YOU.

Sorry.</br>  <br>Fanart is overwhelmingly of Yuki and Kurumi</br>  <br>my god thats worse than the zombie virus</br>    <br>There didn't seem to be too much blood loss, unless he stained half the school red while they were getting to the roof.</br>   playing video games in the middle of a zombie apocalypse <br><br>Living the dream</br></br>  <br>Where the scans at?</br>  <br>Have the uni girls eaten and/or raped them yet?</br>  Why is Mii-kun there from the start?  <br>Now this is what I've been waiting for.</br>   mfw reading about megu nee <br> mfw how kind she is <br> mfw all the predicament <br><br>i need a vodka</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only at fighting games, it seems.</br>   I should have expected a incompetent helicopter pilot, these fucks ALWAYS have to appear in anything zombie related.   <br>I dont know, i'm just following a random nip's twitter account.

Something's going to go down soon enough for them with those uni girls.</br>  <br>That's a default control scheme for Splatoon.</br>  <br>Someone post that picture explaining the helicopter part for blind people</br>  I'd share my hard tack with them.  <br>The implication was that he was infected and that the infection requires regular injections to keep controlled instead of just being cured with one shot</br>  <br>Crashing, evidently.</br>  <br> He lost/was losing control of his body due to the virus. </br>  <br>That Mi-kun though<br> why are all my senpais such bakas </br></br>  <br><br> He's still incompetent because he should've stayed his ass on land if he was infected. </br></br>    <br>Crashing the helicopter with no survivors.</br>  <br> With no survivors. </br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Good enough for me.<br>pls share</br></br>  <br>I bet that's exactly what the author want's you to think while nothing ever happens and they keep doing SoL antics with the occasional shit going down.</br>  <br>Someone get this cathead out of here</br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br> Maybe Randall CO. was sending infected pilots out to prevent healthy pilots from getting infected, maybe he was the only pilot available and they had no choice, maybe he was trying to keep the fact he was infected secret and had to keep doing his job in the meantime <br><br>There's a ton of possible explainations if you think just a little bit</br></br></br>  <br>Does it show any indication of what they're actually playing? It'd be amazing if they were actually playing Splatoon.</br>  I don't mind fanservice at all, but that was just ridiculous.

They did stay at the school for a good while, but they had to eventually move out. The uni girls and the guys, who were chasing them before, could be a good enough reason to progress the plot further and make them quickly "graduate" uni.</br>  <br>If you're fine for 2 weeks until you need another dose of serum, there's not really that much of a risk sending infected people out. There was only a problem because he relapsed then and there.</br>  <br>Aren't those bloomers<br><br><br>We don't know how the "cure" works.<br>If Shovel's foreshadowing is to be believed, we might be dealing with a Zombrex situation.<br>In that case, the pilot could have run out of doses and tried to get back home or not realize he was at his limit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>worst*</br>  <br>The mangaka does play splatoon so it could be a direct reference</br>  <br>Words of wisdom.</br>  <br>The uni girls have been introduced pretty ominously, shit is going to go down one way or the other.<br>They may be cannon fodder so we can have our quota of death without hurting the core roster, or they could be planning something sinister like using the girls.</br></br>  <br> I love you why why wont you open the door <br> No this isnt what i should be doing im hungry but.. <br><br> I wonder if i'll ever see them again. <br><br>im not ready for the anime to reach this scene....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What dastardly things is she planning now</br>  <br><br><br>We aren't in the 80s, nobody would wear such short panties nowadays.</br></br></br>  <br>How dare they rank Rii in anything but last place.</br>  <br>They're going to formally introduce the concept of half-zombies.</br>  <br>Why is there such a distance between Yuki/Kurumi and Miki?</br>  <br>And yet 90% of anime still have them.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here</br></br></br></br>  <br> "Y'know, because it's an university here, there are various kinds of guys here." </br>  <br>I still dont understand why there's no copilot.<br><br>plothole?</br></br></br>  <br>Or further evidence that they're severely low on manpower.</br>  <br>Kurumi and especially Yuki were the poster girls for the anime. They had people cosplaying the two girls at events and whatnot. They've also had the most screentime and development in the anime, and in my opinion, are the most interesting characters both personality and design-wise. But yeah, Kurumi has double the amount of fanart as Miki does on Pixiv.</br>  <br>He just wanted the naked lolis all to himself.</br>  reading the manga was a mistake<br>now im depresed<br>i just want cute girls doing cute things with megu nee ;_;</br></br>  which girl is gonna score the first non zombie kill  <br> Megu-nee already did. </br>  <br>i just wish there were more chapters out</br>  <br>I was gonna say Kurumi but maybe Rii is going to do it and it'll take her over the edge from broken to shattered.</br>    <br>wouldnt mind if Yuki is first to cap a motherfucker</br>  <br> Sweat drop on his helmet </br>  Imagine if pilot-kun was fapping when that unfortunate relapse happened  <br>"What the hell did I just fap to?"</br>  <br>Holy shit it all makes sense now. The chopper went out of control because he was fapping to the thought of a naked lli paradise.</br>    <br> wouldnt mind <br>I want this to happen.</br></br>  <br> Sees clothed high school girls instead of the naked loli paradise he was promised <br> Gets so mad he crushes the message, his medicine and crashes his helicopter in a kamikaze move </br></br>  <br><br>Any girl is likely to kill someone at this point.</br></br>  <br>Turns out she picked up the gun Miki threw away and has been keeping it ever since</br>  <br>picked up the gun that mi-kun threw away<br>caps those no good delinquents</br></br>  <br><br>I wonder how it would turn out now that she's not delusional. Would she break down like the time with the zombie? Maybe she can keep her feelings at bay until they get to safety before it dawns on her what she really did. And maybe she'll completely break and revert to an extreme delusional state where she smiles and waves at her friends in the club while still covered in his fresh warm blood.</br></br>  <br>We were wrong the whole time.

I'm guessing the outbreak at school was an airborne strain since people turned way to quickly and shut went down with minutes. People immune to the airborne virus then got turn through bites which have a different incubation period.

Hitting in the general direction of the eye is impressive enough in itself.  <br>None because they all have type 89's instead of type 64's.<br><br> Anime using 1980's jap military arsenal. </br></br></br>  <br>Gate doesn't have character with that level of moe and genki at the same time</br>  Will potato/rod of steel girl ever get fanarts or even better doujinshi?  <br>No, even itami's trio get barely any art.<br>Hell Rori only has 1 half decent hentai drawing of her riding itami, rest were shit.</br></br>  <br>They look like an airsoft team more than a military squad.</br>  <br>Who's the whopper junior of Gate?</br>  <br> tfw drawfags are still wasting theif time on Hestia instead of use said time for a superior goddess like Rory. </br>  <br>In their defense, they DID say the scouting squads were given outdated equipment in case it fell into enemy hands.</br>  <br>They use old weapons because<br>1)it's more thsn enough<br>2)less budget<br>3)in case they have to retreat through the gate leaving equipment behind they won't lose anything valuable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They even said that the planes were nearing the end of their service life time when one of them got cooked by the flame dragon.<br><br>The short haired squad 3 girl said that her rifle was surplus clearance shit when it got bent as she blocked a sword strike from the bandits.<br><br>Heck because of the low budget a lot of the other squads weren't even wearing the right camo. Itami's group got the new camo simply because he was the Hero of Ginza and on recon, so they gave him the camo first.<br><br>They were also afraid of damaging their night vision shit, they only got MRAPs after their initial encounter with the fire dragon, probably from the USA throwing some supplies at the JSDF because they explained that the USA already assumes that they'll get a slice of the pie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they only got MRAPs after their initial encounter with the fire dragon <br>There was no need for them before.<br>Humvees and LAVs are better for reconnaissance if you don't have to deal with mines,IED or bandits with RPGs.</br></br></br>  <br> because they explained that the USA already assumes that they'll get a slice of the pie. <br>On the side of politics, why do people think it's retarded? I don't know why people call it retarded, some anime out there get praised for its politics and it's more retarded than Gate's.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br>  <br>I like how they mention the MRAPs had A/C.<br><br> Don't worry guys, no need to be afraid of flame dragons now, we got A/C! <br><br><br>Personally I thought it was plausible, those scenes with China would be exactly what China would do if they got hold of the Gate, though their ability to field special forces in Japan is kind of laughable.<br><br>They were spot on about how having USA around is what keeps China and Russia from directly storming for the Gate.<br><br>Perhaps they think that Japan wouldn't send the JSDF over, and then loiter around and ask for peace negotiations the way they are in the manga? Makes them appear to be too much of the good guys?<br><br><br>The manga just can't come out fast enough.<br>It's been so long since I was this excited over a manga,</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> appointing a Rebel and a traitor as a municipal governor <br>What the fuck</br></br>  Any pictures of her sister?<br><br><br>Yes, they produce heat and a radar cross section.<br><br><br>Just add more sabot to the mix.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dragons are confirmed to resemble a stealth fighter on radars</br>  What happened at the end of the VN?  <br> Makes them appear to be too much of the good guys? <br>This is what people have issues with. Like this anime is just Japanese military self-wankery and that semi-realistic premises should always be logical. That the US should have gotten a slice of the Gate pie since all of Japan's neighbors would demand it too. Or that Abe would be called for an inquiry to why they did not ask help since their country was under attack.<br><br>But mostly it's concern out of Japan's "disturbing recent trend of militaristic nationalism" or something along those lines.</br></br></br></br>  <br> VN <br> Leilei open a second Gate after the first one was destroyed and the first thing Itami do is rushing to the comiket, it isn't over yet and it's a LN <br> Also Empress Pina is the girl with the higher chance to win Itami </br></br></br>  <br> Any pictures of her sister? <br>She's hot.</br></br>  What's the difference between the webnovels and the LN?  <br>I would prospect her soil if you know what i mean</br>  <br>The Japanese are pretty split on their military.<br>The US has been pushing them to take a more active role though, both in the past middle east support roles, and the work with the rest of SEA and contain China role.<br><br>Also the build Heli carriers that can be quickly converted to F35 carriers fiasco.<br><br>Personally I'm fine with that, as China's been a big bully throwing it's weight around at the little countries.<br><br>But enough of that, more GATE and less IRL.<br><br>I'm glad that GATE focuses less on politics and more on Itami's random adventures and accen-tion into mythical godhood. <br><br><br>Personally I still think Rori has the biggest chance, Itami likes her personality the most, the elf has the best body, but she keeps calling him daddy, the mage's relation ship with him was more like mentor and student. The Dark Elf is too compliant for his tastes.<br><br>Pina hasn't been that interesting for itami. Itami with his lordship and vast mythical legendary feats is way above Pina, even for a political marriage, she doesn't even bring that much to the table.<br><br>Rori's already dedicated the last 40 years of her demigod hood to following Itami, and her claim for the goddess of love and her blood contract with itami is proof she has the hots for Itami, she spent 900 years without any blood contracts after all.<br><br>I think it was funny during the flame dragon arc when they were bluffing to Hardy's priestess and then JSDF came in and completely wrecked the two dragons, making that priestess believe it was itami's power and adding to itami's mythical legends, as seen by the flood of titles, and gifts once he returned to base.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shit, the second point was my apprehension.<br><br>Anything notable about Rory?

That's quite a bit bigger than a lordship under a king... under the Empire (though King Boss has told the Empire to go fuck itself).<br>Also Pina gets very much into Itami, to the point where Hamilton puts aphrodisiac in a keg of beer when they go on vacation, to insure they fuck.  Turns out, mermaids get their hands on it, and orgy ensues. </br></br></br>  <br> The dissapointment of this girls when they see the Japanese dick </br>  Was there ever any kind of JSDF collaboration or sponsorship for any of the iterations of GATE?<br><br>Other than the obvious fact that the original author was in the JSDF?</br></br>  <br>Yes let's militarize the Pacific I am sure nothing could go wrong.<br><br>I wonder how the US would like it if Chinese aircraft carriers sailed the Gulf of Mexico?</br></br></br>  <br> I wonder how the US would like it if Chinese aircraft carriers sailed the Gulf of Mexico? <br>China isn't the world police.</br></br>  <br> Chinese aircraft carriers <br><br>You mean carrier, as in singular.<br><br>The Chinks only have one.<br><br>Also the Chinks couldn't back up a war against American interests in American waters, while America can easily back up a war against Chinese interests in Chinese waters, so the analogy doesn't really work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pina is dangerously turning into Risa</br>  <br>It's not even set in stone that she's getting to be the next king, her brother has a bigger running, hell she's 10th in equation.<br><br>She brings no benefits that Itami doesn't already enjoy, itami already have close ties with other kings, mining rights, a mythical lengend, tax exemptions and free travel.<br><br>Pina's into itami, but a bunch of other girls are also into itami, and itami's more into the original trio + dark elf than Pina.<br><br>The people as a whole isn't even that fond of the empire, and view the JSDF in much higher regards.

The point is that the JSDF doesn't have the mandate to overthrow the government and they were using standard negotiations done by the modern world.

At that point the dragon was overwhelmed and didn't know what was wat. It's not till his arm blew off that he was like 'Fuck. I gotta bail here'</br></br></br></br>  <br>He did teach them, but they forgot everything when they saw the dragon.</br>  <br><br>Exactly.<br><br>Anyway, you wanted military power level /a/?<br><br>I give you this.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RrS<wbr>S058pjWw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>lol</br>  <br> He did teach them <br>correction, he tried to teach them. they were too busy making dick jokes.</br></br>  Why are they not more angry about being spied on?  <br>It's like a fucking child poking their head into the command tent with curiosity. Why would they be angry?</br>  <br>Huh. Japan doesn't have female fighter pilots? Why not? It's actually one of the few 'in the line of fire' jobs that they can do that their physiology doesn't hold them back. They're actually better at it because the shorter you are the better you can handle G-Forces.<br><br>So wow. Japan actually bans women from the one combat role they physically excel at.<br><br>And yes, physically, women are complete shit in a ground infantry role.<br><br>Being a female in the military means lower/easier standards fitness standards, super relaxed dress &amp; appearance standards, not having to worry about being placed in the direct line of fire and easier jobs, a shitload more healthcare (and the like) benefits, and equal pay.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No<br>They either blackblasted each others or the dragon simply killed them because they forgot to remove the secure, the beast dodged all the rockets they managed to fire too.</br></br>  <br>Yeah but your reasons are a tad bit exaggerated don't you think?</br>  <br>Something about being shot down behind enemy lines, and special pilot suits that fit them.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this guy got a direct hit on it's side.</br>  <br>because people can't into faux-latin</br>  <br>Didn't he fuck up some how tho?</br>  <br>Yeah. They require smaller g-suits and gear. It's a slight annoyance on the flight equipment personnel, but considering how rare female pilots are it doesn't end up being a huge deal.<br><br>I mean, everything any pilot wears is sized and fitted anyways. It's the same amount of work.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just <br> wordius, wordus, wordia. </br></br>  I hate Gate manga because of low res shit scans. Pain to read  <br>Japan would probably use the USA's 'midget sized/female' flight gear anyways considering they're manlets.</br>  <br>He sacrificed himself and shot the dragon as the dragon caught him with the fire breath.<br><br>The backblast retard elf also got a hit in the neck.<br><br>I think the arm blasting off was because it's got less scales there and it was a thin limb, the dragon could take multi hits to it's main body.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Good luck hitting anything.</br></br>  <br>It's slavshit all you do is pull and pray</br>  <br>Oddly enough the requirements for being a fighter pilot are much more extreme than ground infantry.</br>  <br>It doesn't have the hygiene problems that ground infantry has though.</br>  <br>Planes are fucking expensive.</br>  <br>/k/ i know this is you.<br>you're triggering my autism.<br>pls no</br></br></br>  <br>Let alone one sortie's worth of fuel.</br>  <br>I said headshot. And its legs were fairly chunky, and the explosion still had enough force to blast it clear, and not just shred the fuck out of it. And I'm pretty sure that was with a glancing shot. A direct headshot would fuck that dragon's day up hardcore.</br>  <br>Because in infantry if you fuck up you only lose your life. If you fuck up while in a fighter you take an expensive jet with you.</br>  <br><br>I hear you.<br><br>But not only that but women are far better at handling muti-tasking and do not suffer to the extend that men do from "tunnel syndrome" that all men instinctively get the "going in for the kill" mindset.<br><br>But yeah, mostly logistics (is it worth the cost of all the back infrastructure; toilets, female support staff and so forth?) and being shot down (look at the gulf wars, Afgan or Nam'), small arms fire can still rekt hard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, if the physical requirements were less you could just increase the mental requirements to weed out idiots. The problem is that it's physically very demanding in specific ways.</br>  <br> lol <br> memefacecomic <br>Why don't you throw in a smiley?</br></br></br>  Hell. How many anime actually count ammunition and show the correct clip size?. The only one I can think of of the top of my head is Noir.<br><br>And western tv is no better. The only one I can think of is Archer, which uses ammunition counting, guns are loud, and the like realistically to comedy effect.<br><br>Infinite bullets and then suddenly out at -dramatic moment- bugs the shit out of me unless a series is clearly gun-fu wuxia like Black Lagoon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>WHERE'S THE EPISODE OP</br>  <br>That's old /k/ humor, ya cunt</br>  <br> So far there hasn't been a monster that isn't damaged by one. <br>rori would just regenerate</br></br>  <br>Yeah they got multiple torso shots in and it barely scratched it.<br>This one was a perfect side of neck/headshot though.</br></br>  <br>ok McGregor</br>  <br>Gate in the Italica fight I think. Didn't Kuri run out of bullets and exchanged with Itami?</br>  <br>She would still take a deal of damage, and her limbs only repair if you hold them together, you can run off with her limbs and she wouldn't be able to regenerate the whole limb.<br><br>My wording is correct, there isn't a monster that isn't damaged by one, Rori is a demigoddess, but even if you count her as a monster, she still would get fairly messed up, as evident in the flame dragon arc where she got dismembered taking linked damage from itami.</br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck. I guess this manga is just inconsistent then. Compare that shot to this. Exact same weapons.</br>   this webm <br><br>every time</br></br>  <br>I just think that the dragon's scales are inconsistent, perfectly plausible that a thin limb like the arm which has higher mobility would have less scales/armor, where the neck/head, a likely point of getting bitten by other dragons would be tougher, they breath fire and all too.<br><br>The dragon was taking damage, but it wasn't going to be a one shot kill.</br></br></br>  <br><br>We could spectulate that this is a younger dragon and its scales have not fully harden yet.</br></br>  <br>Okay. What retarded show is that so I never watch it?</br>  <br>No, it's the same dragon the one that got it's arm blown off during the first itami counter and then taking multiple hits in the volcano.</br>  <br><br>Look again. That limb isn't thin, dude. And it's not plausible to have your throat less armored than your arms. Both are important. Your underbelly and inner sides, sure. <br><br><br>Those are the same two dragons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you manage to get them sucked in the engine intake, yeah but they'd most likely get shredded up in the rotors before they do.</br>  <br>The first hit probably hit a joint.<br><br>Those are gonna be weaker.</br></br></br>  <br>Blacks in Russian military are mostly there as part of training programs with Africa. They wouldn't be on that mission.</br>  <br>Knight's Armament PDW, HK MP7, and what I think is supposed to be a Magpul PDR? Obviously Americans.</br>  <br>Not a PDR, FN 2000</br>  <br><br><br><br>What if the Dragon's scales reactively harden against it? (same thing happens to humans).<br><br><br><br>I can't remember.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You talking shit about magic arrows?  No really, they're magic arrows. </br>  <br>How can they hit an airborne target with only bows and arrows from that far of a distance?<br><br>I'm not /k/ and it triggers me.

It hit his horns.</br></br></br>  <br> they didn't arm it <br><br>kek<br><br>It is always the simple answer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I knew that there was something I was forgetting that they fucked up.</br>  <br>Where's the real mage?

How can a dragon look like a bird on radar?</br>  <br>Somehow scales gives them a very low RCS</br>  <br>http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=bbb_<wbr>1226768802</wbr></br>  Episode when?  <br>should be today sometime</br>  <br>Blood and flesh absorb radar.<br><br><br>I'm looking at the chapter right now and they got at least 3 shots with the detonator pulled out and primed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure Israeli are a good example here.<br><br>These days they're at worst are fighting Hamas, not exactly trained and deadly soldiers, hell do they even fight against the daesh?</br></br></br>  <br>Because dumb Elevens who make anime don't understand that nearly all modern military combat aircraft can and are supposed to attack from BVR.</br>  <br><br>No, they fund ISIS.<br><br><br><br>b-but m-muh CAS muh brrrrrr</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well duh, they ain't get mandatory service enlistment like gooks, most milfags are airshitters, ain't got no 2nd ammendment shit because of WWII.</br>  <br> b-but m-muh CAS muh brrrrrr <br> <br>Ground Support is also often done from BVR these days unless all anti-air has been taken out.<br><br>AC-130s and A-10s are not gonna survive being shot at by any competent modern anti-air defense. They're gods when there's no anti-air, but they're sitting ducks when there is.</br></br></br></br></br>  They did point out anything that had to do with sats and GPS did not work.<br><br>Getting a lock on something non metal is also kinda hard.<br><br>Fly boys also mentioned to not get lost while flying around, so I'd assume that nav, positioning systems weren't working.<br><br>BVR missles use active radar guidance, they don't have radar in fantasy land, heck you don't even see a lot of them in the base.<br><br>The non active radar ones need passive infra-red guidance, or tracking information, all of which aren't deployed in the fantasy land.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How much effort would it be to build a spaceport on the other side of the gate? I'd think that getting accurate maps and GPS would be worth it.</br>  <br>Multi tasking is a myth to begin with. Your brain takes a second or two( i believe it's two seconds but to lazy to check a source atm) to change modes to the next task so constantly shifting the task it's doing is actually drastically lowering your brain's efficiency at any given task compared to completing each job separately.</br>  <br>I can fap and shit on the toilet at the same time. Get that bs outta here.</br>  <br>And offend whichever god has domain over that shit?</br>  <br>I was asking for the time</br>  <br>If their god cared so much he should have imbued the Roman's shields with invulnerability or something.</br>  <br>They barely had any funding before Itami brought in the big diamond and news of oil.<br>I'm pretty certain that a spaceport isn't very high on their list of priorities.<br>Heck they have 1 jet left as 1 got cooked by the flame dragon.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The head mistress hasn't been shown again after that. She's currently in Guantanamo.</br></br>  She's pretty cute, I'd take her as my apprentice. <br><br>And use my position of authority to sexually exploit her, if you know what I mean.</br></br>  <br>Lots. And it would probably cost a lot more. They either manufacture the rocket in situ, in which case they would need high tech industries on the other side, or they transport the whole rocket through tokyo and the gate, meaning the size of the gate would limit the size of the rocket.<br><br>It would be worth it, though. Just setting up ground telescopes would be worth a lot, setting a satellite to see in which point of the universe the gate is would be worth it a lot more.</br></br></br>  <br>Balloon + disposable camera can give them aerial maps for under $100.</br>  <br>But that is no GPS. Can't guide ICBMs with baloons.</br>  <br>Sure, for the local area. You can't map the whole planet like that though.</br>  <br>Personally I like Rori and the two elves better than her. Rori is guaranteed to fuck like a tiger in bed. Dark elf for BDSM, light elf for gentle procreation.<br><br>The mage is meh.<br><br><br>They don't need ICBMs, their choppers reign supreme now that the only big dragon is gone.<br><br>That 1 remaining jet is enough to drop ordinances where ever they want unhindered. Dragon knights can't even hope to follow it.<br><br>For now JSDF is satisfied with sending out the recon units, having the flyboys zoom around and having Itami go on his "resource" trips.<br><br>They have no motivation for having sats up atm.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The mage can magic your dick and make it more sensitive or make you gush cum like hentai protags.<br><br>You don't want that? Mage a best, patrician taste.</br></br></br>  <br>The mage is the only virgin in the harem.<br>All the others are spoiled.</br></br>  <br>I think some satellites would be nice to find out what the solar system is like in that world. How strong is the gravity? How old is the star? What's the composition of the planet etc.</br>  <br>They lost 1 F-4 but they used 2 F-4 for killing the baby dragons.<br>Probably they have atleast 5-6 of them</br></br>  <br> Rori is guaranteed to fuck like a tiger in bed. <br>My dick demands an explanation.</br></br>  <br>I'm expecting BDSM shit</br>  <br>Heck the only spells the mage "in training" can do atm is snow balls, sleep spells, weight/agility spells, and throw around a few swords.<br><br>I highly doubt she can magic dicks at the moment.<br><br>Though later on she can control the gate, but I'd still rather have the demigoddess in bed.<br><br><br>Meh I dunno man...<br><br>Rory's lingerie is sweet, this is drawn by the official artist so it's canon.<br><br><br>Still, that's not very high on their list, they still haven't even gotten the peace treaty down pat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's like 950 years old.</br>  <br>I'm sure she can cast physical endurance spells. Cast it on a dick and it's no-side effect viagra.</br>  <br>Tight Rori might acktually enjoy Itami's nip peen</br>  <br>Didn't you see how horny she gets every time there is a battle? She'll take the lead, push down itami nibble on his neck and then proceed the ride the fuck out of him while people are dying in battle all around them.</br>  Are American soldiers as silly as they are depicted in this manga/WN? Also it seemed like they made the Americans and Russians out as evil as fuck if they were to ever cross the Gate themselves?  <br>Invent a sextant for the gate zone. Figure out the target location from there with the power of MATH after you've gotten your maps. It's not like the city is going to suddenly move.<br><br><br>http://www.theguardian.com/technolo<wbr>gy/2009/sep/21/mit-students-budget-<wbr>space-photographs<br><br>Still a pretty good chunk of it with garbage equipment alone.<br><br>Gravity can be measured via a ruler, camera, and dropping an object. Preferably in a vacuum but they don't need absolute precision yet.<br><br>Its not that satellites aren't nice. Its that I don't see them using em when there are Romans to swindle nearby. Japan right now isn't trying to setup long term bases for defense against the Gate peoples. They're trying to steal everything that isn't bolted down in the hopes of being self sustaining before the nations with REAL power realize what they're doing, get tired of their shit, and knock back Japan a few decades for their nonsense. You're making the mistake of thinking the Japanese are benevolent when really they're a bunch of swindling extortionists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot to link to </br>  <br><br>I know.<br><br>But even the Collision during the first Gulf war happlily deployed CAS aircraft into un-safe airspace.<br><br><br><br>Wouldn't it be possible to a shove a couple of drones or an E-767 or E-2 through the gate and use it to gather data?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It hurts to think you never grope demigoddess DFC</br>  <br>You really think japs wouldn't harbor any resentment for being nuclear bombed by americans and their territory annexed by russians?</br>  <br> agility spell <br>this one will do</br></br>  <br><br>did he died?</br></br>  So Itami is the Jack O'Neill of this SG unit right?  <br>Peh.

Pretty sure that level of magic can do something about getting rid of refectory periods and exhaustion.</br></br>  <br>It was another operation called operation blacklist led by general Mc Arthur I believe</br>  So this isn't the only manga to show that America has an apparently really crappy army.<br><br>How bad are they?<br><br>They always hype up the patoritics here with how good are they, but how do they compare worldly?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're doing gods work anon.<br>keep spreading the faith</br></br>  <br>Good goy i need more on the left, would bomb palestines for her</br>  <br>That was korean occupation</br>  <br>We wanted unconditional surrender<br>We wanted to scare the piss outta the Russians<br>We wanted revenge<br>We wanted to secured Japan from becoming a Russian slave camp by becoming our our colomy.</br></br></br></br>  <br> really crappy army <br>Call it what you will, it still is the strongest military in the world</br></br>  <br> How bad are they? <br>I can say that as an European USA reigns supreme in seas at the very least.</br></br>  <br> god's <br> emroy's <br>fixed</br></br></br>  <br>which is why they just rolled through the two F4s that were at the end of their service life and a couple handful of choppers.<br><br>Remember that they are very budget limited even with the 100K bonus.<br><br><br>I haven't actually seen Lelei cast any healing spells even when the dark elves were getting slaughtered and all.

I usually give in and just watch HS, but things like song translations are actually important for Symphogear.</br>  <br>Someone needs to play the damn thing to destroy the world.</br>  <br>I want to put the tip of her braid in my mouth and start chomping to see how far I can get.</br>  I fucking love Fridays.<br>I can't wait for  Wakaba Girl .</br>    <br>Commie's translations for songs are filled with make-up shits, though.</br>    Did H&amp;D really need to use that terrible font for the beef stroganoff song?    <br>You can watch the individual episodes just fine without understanding the songs, and it's not like H&amp;D have given up yet.</br>  <br>O TO KO NO KO WA<br>SHI RA NA I KE DO~</br></br>  <br>They'll at least get better once the official song lyrics come out.</br>    <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Their subs for G say otherwise.</br>  <br>Can you give an example?</br>  <br><br>Why would you willingly program a doll you made to annoy the shit out of and style on you?</br></br>  THEY'RE OUT  <br>The blushy Carol I've been waiting for</br>  PREVIEW IMAGES OUT  <br>Wrong one.<br>Fuck me.</br></br>   Picture of Anime-chan and friends in front of the noise is shaking <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  MARIA USELESS.<br>I REPEAT. MARIA USELESS.</br>  SUNSHINE TIME  <br>G-beat is the best obviously horrible example from this season.</br>  Angry Carol!  <br>This party's about to get cuhrazy.</br>  Did she try to kick the noise?<br>What a mong.</br>  <br>BIIFU SU-TORO-GANOFU</br>  Are we going to get more of Miku comforting Hibiki while cuddling in bed?  What did she say to make everyone look at her? Also, why is the image shaking?  Oh hi Mamu.  <br>Oh god, the Kuuga henshin is not working.<br>All is lost.</br></br>  <br>Offer herself as hostage I bet.</br>  Keywords confirm that Daisleif needs to kill once it's been drawn. Well, it literally says "sip the blood of a victim" though.  <br> What did she say to make everyone look at her? <br>"I know the song!"<br><br>Blondetits confirmed for gear user.<br>GUNGNIR DATTO? etc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's about to cast Meteor</br>  <br>If I recall correctly they have things like<br> burning hotter than the sun <br> Boom <br> Break hand <br>or something along the lines in G-beat which aren't what Hibiki's singing at all. <br><br>In G, they didn't even bother to fix the subs for any of the character songs even after their CDs are out. When Hibiki was singing the 2nd verse of Seigi wo shinjite in episode 7, they didn't even bother and just slapped the wrong translation of the 1st verse into the sub.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria might be useless, but gotDAYUM if she doesn't have a lewd body.</br>    <br>That would be a good way of fixing the problem.<br>Why nobody thought about it?</br></br>  <br>I guess she's not returning then.</br>  <br> kick the noise <br><br>Without dying? Is she still symphogeah da?<br><br><br> blonde girl from anime squad is Gungnir datto <br>I don't know how I feel about that.<br><br>That's Hibiki's job anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Episode 04 <br> Gungnir, Once More <br>I guess we won't have to wait too long to see Hibiki punching things again.</br></br>    <br> center bottom <br>Elfnein making her move already?<br>I'm hype.</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ Maria</br>  Seems like a slow episode again.<br>I don't mind, we need that build up before everything eventually goes down the shitter when Dainsleif gets activated.</br>  <br>It's silly that anyone would have thought otherwise.</br>  <br> even more footshit <br>When will these fucking footfags stop forcing their shitty fetish into every anime?</br></br>  <br>She is a cute.<br>I wouldn't mind her as a new gear user.</br></br>   Garie will never serenade you as you sit on your throne   <br> That's Hibiki's job anon. <br>She can't do a training montage to get back her resolve while being a hostage. It has to be one of her friends. Miku would be the most effective hostage of course, but we already had the abducted Miku arc last season.</br></br>  <br> inb4 the title is about Maria, not Hibiki <br>KORT EL FES GUNGNIR</br></br>  <br>I don't really dislike you, but you still confuse me.</br>  Roar out through the heavens and wrapped in undulating emotion.<br>The truest of tones can be found here. <br>The trembling signal of pain in my heart broke through many a night as I searched for you so much and enough to drive me to insane. <br>Within the elegant, dreamlike sounds that float upon a double-edged warmth, entrusted tears roam through the sky.<br>The more I seek this radiant melody, all that's projected is more illusions.<br>But the moment we know as "now" will always be what forms the miracle of tomorrow, so I want to sing for your sake! <br>Let everything free if you have a dream for the future in which you believe. <br>Our resounding hearts are unstoppable! Let's go together! Joining hands no matter how far. <br>I won't let go off that smile! <br>Without noticing the love that's there, trapped within mixing memories and hopes, I was on the threshold of gentleness and weakness in grief. <br>Rather than chasing a fickle and fading past, <br>I'll strain my ears to hear my own voice. <br>Since true happiness is always right by one's side, I want to tell this to you alone! <br>Flare up endlessly if you have something you wish to protect! <br>No one can break this engraved oath! <br>Fearing the thought of losing it, I was avoiding knowing more. <br>But the happiness you gave to me in the beginning becomes determination. <br>I'll sing to you this song of spiritual life! <br>Let everything free if you have a dream for the future in which you believe.<br> Our resounding hearts are unstoppable! <br>Let's go together! <br>Joining hands no matter how far. <br>I won't let go off that smile!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's so Bikkie thing to commit suicide for the sake of her friends I assumed everyone at least expects her to make an offer. I didn't thought blonde will try to do it tho.<br><br>I think it's about Maria. I don't like that idea, but I feel it's going to happen.<br><br>True that, but I think Hibiki needs to at least realize her own value before training montage. And it would be fun to see Bikkie training in prison while other geahs train with Genjuro.</br></br></br></br></br>   I got bored again <br> This one's harder to see though </br>  <br>Fuck yes</br>  So Dainsleif is contained within a Lemarchand Box.<br><br>We Hellraiser now.</br></br>   So Carol has been around for hundreds of years because she keeps creating new homunculus bodies and transferring her memories into them <br>Hundreds years loli old hag confirmed.</br>  <br>Were you expecting anything different from the 2hu?</br>  <br>Is kirika offering cola to the death?</br>  <br>I'm hype for Maria song, as useless as she was in S2, her battle song was amazing.</br>  <br> Garie ganbarimasu~ </br>  <br>Too lewd.</br>  <br>The text in the EP4 PV is clearly Hibiki reviewing her own values. <br><br> My feelings and my words don't lie. Still, I can't let things stay like this. In order to take the next step ahead I can't fear the power that's in my hands. Resound, my heart! Singing passionately, my heart!  <br><br>The last words are referencing the lyrics to seigi wo shinjite in case it wasn't obvious enough.<br><br>I think we will see Hibiki get her development this episode already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Maria's gungnir more than Hibiki's.</br>  <br>Technically, you could take her virginity multiple times.</br>  <br>Pretty much as expected given that the second part of G-Beat, which we haven't heard yet, already spoils this.</br>     She mentioned Tsubasa can be kind of girly around Maria and how that made ao-chan happy. She thought they were flirting a lot lol <br><br> Aoi approved shipping</br></br>  Kirika preview song out.<br><br>It's pretty good.</br></br>  I actually prefer Shirabe over Kirika,  but I'm only halfway through s2 and not exactly fond of either yet    Why does the preview pic of Miku and Hibiki shake furiously when you hover above it?  <br>Literally no reason.</br>  <br>If Shirabe's has a similar melody, then my god it's going to be glorious</br>    <br> They both get much better in the first 3 episodes of GX already. </br>  <br>I didn't really like either of them until GX. Now I love them as much as the rest of the cast.</br>  Kirika's second song is called おきてがみ.<br><br>So it's another dumb letter, but what does 'oki' mean?</br></br>  The DESS DESS DESS was ad libbed by Kayano apparently.  <br>left behind. The full title is The Letter Left Behind.</br>  <br>Someone's gonna die</br>  <br>Don't fall for it again anon</br>    <br><br>OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE</br></br>  <br>Step on my dick, Carol-sama</br>  <br>Called it. Shirabe died last season, now it's time for Kirika.</br>   Because she has the power of the Holy Grail, Garie excels in handling memories <br> Only Garie is able to distribute memories to other dolls, Phara and Leiur can only suck the memories out of people <br> Micha isn't even able to collect memories from people so she depends on Garie to get her fill <br>So Micha can't fight for long without making out with Garie. That's gay as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>What extension is that?</br>  <br>It's about Maria.<br><br>Everyone get your party hats on.</br></br></br>  <br>At the rate they're going, we won't have any characters left alive for season 4!</br>   yfw it's letter from fine <br> Kirika is fine too. </br>  <br>Rikaisama.</br>  <br> Someone's gonna die <br><br>They won't kill any geah from Team A because that would kill the show. Killing girl from Team B would be stupid because they just know started to be interesting characters. Genjuro is going to die in S4 so Hibiki can have even stronger reason to be out of combat. So who?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck it, everyone is Fine. Genjuro can be Fine too.</br>  <br><br>Her first "tegami" was already meant as an "okitegami" though. I see no merit for the show in killing Kirika. Granted, it's only episode 3 so a lot can still change.</br></br>  <br>I eagerly await a naked Genjuro phonecall scene.</br>  <br>I heard that Hibiki's kung fu noises where also ad libbed. Maybe they're just telling all VAs to do whatever they want in the transformations scenes.</br>   yfw it's actually about a depressing goodbye letter Nastassja wrote before dying that was brought back with her corpse   <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>I eagerly await a Genjuro symphogear transformation sequence.</br>  Eps 5 is where shits hit the fan according to interview right ?  <br> halfway through the song Fine starts singing </br>  <br>Episode 7.<br>Also known as episode Nana.</br></br>  <br>I have so many questions</br>    <br>My only question is why is Shirabe not dressed in white?</br>  What do you think of fansub in various languages? I'm italian and i hate italian subs.<br>  Very slow groups (people have a life, so they need a week to translate HS sub file) <br>  Hardsub everywhere  <br>  Tons of timing/grammatical errors <br>  A lot of groups don't use torrent. They use stupid host sites that delete the episodes after a week  <br>  189747894494 groups sub Naruto and One Piece, while no groups care about other better series </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gay schwytzerdeutch detected.</br>  <br>brilliant<br>Maybe I should look if my study has use of nip</br></br>  <br>all is well then</br>  <br> want to become a diplomat </br>  <br>Where can I find "what u want" sub tho? My listening skill is not too good to watch RAW.</br>  Why do you guys hate me so much?  How is this thread still up?  <br> wanting to sex Sugu </br>  <br>Well it is rather easy. Observing how every girl falls for you and you get dragged into plots for no reason, it becomes obvious that you are a low grade reality warper.<br><br>You are a danger to public safety and it is our patriotic duty to shun you to minimize the damage done until the authorities take care of you.</br></br></br>  it is over    Chapter 76 raws are out. Can we have a Sidonia thread?<br><br> Hoshijiro a best </br></br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  This chapter wa boring as sin. This whole battle is.  <br>Samari and Captain are pretty good, too. Izana a meh.</br>  <br> several days <br>my nigga</br></br>  <br>My nigga.</br>  Wow.<br><br> ANGELA IS MY GOD </br></br>  <br>fujoshi pls</br>  <br>The lead up and reveal to this page made me 'Aww' so hard.<br><br><br>I thought that was well done. Very crafty.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I dropped this when it turned into the saga of gay. <br><br>It's never going to leave that. This is just a break, and if you're thinking it won't have the gay ending, then I don't know what to tell you.</br></br></br>  <br><br>At last no more fujo</br></br>  <br>Maybe there's a everyone ditches him for being an indecisive faggot ending.</br></blockquote>]
