[  9 days   9 volumes   Tonight, we do Kirio's arc. Well, at least Mayuko's there I guess.               There is literally not a more attractive woman in anime.    Motoko   a character       whiny cunt who only lives because of plot armor    Kusanagi is probably one of the more respectable women in fiction.    Why is her outfit so bad? It's so ugly that I can't even find it sexy.    Best women coming through.  Who bet on a cliffhanger at end of the episode 12 for the season 3?  What's the worst anime you've ever seen?  Sacred Seven comes to mind.   forgot pic    I regret it, I regret everything, The ONE ANIME THAT I SHOULD HAVE DROP BEFORE PASSING EPISODE 3.    SAO and Naruto Shippuuden are both worse than Hatenkou Yuugi though. I've seen it, it's 4/10.   Worst I've seen is SAO, best I've seen is Berserk. ( I'm new to anime but I can tell you Berserk is great, I watch a lot of TV and it's probably in my top 3)  The 2nd PV https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=flc<wbr>Yx70r4aE</wbr>  [ ]             I love you /a/!  uh-umm..... I guess    inb4 lightbulb?      I love you too, Mikan.  As always, stay far far away from Kaie.  Please.      I would hug and pet Mikan so much. Kuu is the one I want to fuck though.   I love you too, Mikan.    I love you too, Mikan!    I found  the scene where she humped the desk  way more erotic than every other scene.    Character's power is invulnerability    HxH was pretty good with the curveballs. Refreshing.  Was it ever explained why they still wound up neck deep in that whole affair after failing Netero's test?      plot is based largely in powerlevels of some sort or another   author feels (rightly or wrongly) that more powerlevel tension is needed in a new arc   author pulls a: "You know that last guy who we said was, like, really OP? Well this next guy is like 10x worse than him!!"   it's just some generic villain whipped up ad hoc   from that point forward the powerlevel inflation virus basically puts a death sentence on the series       Zankyou no Terror.   harems    why does araki love villains who can do shit with time   Post your favorite reaction images this season.   The sword-penis swap would be trivial. But good cum requires a lot off skill and actual work.      Get in nerds    almost no punchline  /a/s shit taste.     Who is best shingeki and why is it Annie?   Eren put a lot of effort to become a soldier but BRA put much more effort to become warriors. Sure they're not the same, but Eren's will to go against the flow was there only in the beginning. After Levi and Erwin took him under their control he just helps the scouting legion with everything, it just happens that he agrees with their cause.  I expect Bert and Reiner to go against MT for whatever reason, since it's starting to look like MT is doing it for selfish reasons and BR disagree, but that's just speculation on my part.      Bert will go awol to save Annie. Reiner will directly go against MT and die for it.    Bert loves Annie but he wouldn't leave Reiner to die. Reiner always gets into trouble but that doesn't mean that Bert agrees with it, that's why he's always running after him.    Either way he managed to get two girls to envy or admire him because Eren comes across as a strong-willed person. Bert doesn't really have anything admirable about him.    So Reiner and Eren are equally dumb. Although Eren's behavior was even more retarded and got his team mates killed.   Everyone ready to drink Doffyfag tears tomorrow?   You know what? You can just fuck off and die.    Momofag pls go.    Putting that aside so far he's only been shown to be a spoiled whiny kid I think.   anyone got anything else like this?   BASED ODA BEING BASED   NEW SYMPHOGEAR GX PV! GET HYPE, FAGGETS! IT'S REAL! https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CLc<wbr>pO8S8tvY</wbr>  [ ]      Edgewitch is going to get befriended so damn hard, I can't wait.  It makes me want to  fist  you.        You mean hopefully the fanbase is better than G's.    HAATO YO     Shirabe and Kirika going to Lydian  Thank you based Satelight.  We pretty much have an SoL episode with all the students locked in, then?   Who's excited for  Maria going into deep cover to make sure Shirabe and Kirika are doing okay in school, dragging Tsubasa with her.         I rarely see discussions about Manwha, so I decided to make a little thread it.  I'll start by posting the whore that has pissed me off more than Enju from Dice.    what the fuck happened to madokami.  it still worked yesterday    His skill/ability is Gary Stuish. His life is a bit because suddenly those daughter of Zahhard loved him, those whatever stronk faction want to use him, only Rachel despises him.    <br/>    I was really expecting for Baam to destroy the train while he was falling again, but what? He fainted or something?     literally what Manga is pronounced in Chinese and Korean respectively  Which is actually surprising considering how many drastic changes the medium took over the last how many decades and how many authors thought whatever the were doing wasn't manga anymore. See A Drifting Life. The history of the term is actually way more complicated than anyone ever seems to think.   Traditionally made manhwa is a hell of a lot better than the cheaply done and mass produced webtoons they do these days. Which is actually a real damn shame. Webtoon format is pretty awful, and few use it well (and not enough close enough to not feel like it's completely for accomodating mobile devices and destroying any semblance of technique in panelling. Basically screw Tezuka.) They're not all completely awful, but they're probably more derivative than shitty shounen manga and the fact they didn't go through the same evolution or time span like manga speaks volumes for the quality. Where are their Otomo or Tezuka?      What are we going to do after next week? Is there any hope for more UFO Girl and Friends?   thanks  now i see why there were no subs     KUMIKO TRIES TO TRAIN HARD. EVEN BLEEDS. SHE MAKES A BIG FUSS OUT OF IT.  MEANWHILE, MIDORI HAS HER HANDS DESTROYED AND DOES NOT EVEN MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT IT.  BASED MIDGET.       What the hell did you link to?    It's been hinted at several times throughout the series, but I don't know if people realize she really is one of the most talented and experienced players in the band.    There is only one truth Kaori.    Dawn of The Final Day 9 Hours Remain   I'm scared. I don't want it to end.    No opening   Insert of full version of Stella-rium when Subaru starts to fix everything   You heard it here first folks. My dead finacee worked at GAINAX       finacee      I don't want this ride to end either    Hva you bought strawberry milk for the last episode, /a/?  So, now that this season is drawing to a close, who was the best girl featured this season and why was it Cyan?   No, they're bands.    No. Musical band anime isn't idol anime.  The difference is not only in missing idol industry faggotry, but also musical talent.    Get your cursed black stardust, forbidden devil's sigh, legend of hell flame lake, and shining justice at Animate.    not using actual orz screenshot    Wonder what the MIDI CITY residents will think of the sudden departure of Cyan.   They'll probably take the whole 'she returned to her own alternate universe' thing as the band's euphemism for Cyan's untimely death, I know I will   </blockquote>]
