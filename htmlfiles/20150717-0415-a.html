I just think the other girls are better.   watching Umaru while eating snacks and cola <br><br>Super comfy.</br></br>  <br>This is the truth. It's made obvious in the manga she only acts like that because she wants her brother to take care of her.</br>  <br>There's no reason though, he'd take care of her even if she didn't act so spoiled.

No need for her to act like that only to provoke a reaction.

And from a more technical perspective, they were very well-done; they were inventive, well-reasoned and the art fit the tone very well. The manga threw all of that away for a generic harem structure and reducing everyone to rote roles. You have the horny first girl, the ditz, the secretly horny highborn lady, the ara ara femdom chick who's a secret M, etc. - defining traits beyond that are largely gone and the inventiveness and heart of the original strips has been turned into tawdry by-the-book sex jokes.<br><br>I don't really care what you like or why, but to me the manga and anime are empty husks of why I liked the originals.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to bro it up with a /fit/ centaur guy</br>  <br> I wonder what become the fate of those teaser guys? <br> They become the true father of these female's children.

So like I said, I was at dragon con and towards the end of the evening, I went the the bar area. I met a couple people there who liked my shirt, and asked if i wanted to drink with them. I was kinda tipsy to begin with, so I was like, hell ya! So it was me, pudgy chick, hotter chick, and these 2 dudes who were huge flamers. We talk about the con, they say they are into furry stuff. I never really had anything against furries so i really didnt care that much. I think she took that as I was a furry too in some weird way. So we start drinking more and these two dudes are all over each other. I guess that is what made pudgy girl try to go after me. She is talking to me with that whole, lets get out of here voice. You know, that voice that kinda drips eroticism? So me, her, and her friend start leaving and she says to me, in not a quiet tone btw, if I want to come to her room. <br><br>And to be frank, im not one to turn down an offer like that. I mean, sex is sex. When we get into her room, we start making out hard, but then she stops. With big puppy dog eyes, she asks if she can get more confortable...in her suit. At this point, I really dont care. Im about to get my dick wet. So she changes, and gets into a dog/wolf fursuit, comes over to where i was sitting, and starts to do an erotic dance for me.<br><br>That is when I manned up, pushed her on the best, and went at it. Im not ganna lie, it was great. It was weird that she was kind of yipping during it, but whatever. Overall, sex in a fursuit was pretty awesome.<br><br>So if you want the experience of fucking Polt, you should try a fursuit. Its nice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you will never be a communal husband for a village of lamias <br> you will never own a hotspring with a yuki onna <br> you will never try and teach a flock of harpies only for them to forget in 3 steps <br> you will never work on a farm and milk/shear your gf <br> you will never go diving with a mermaid <br> etc </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is she accidentally counting butlers?</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but at the moment they only have enough material to do 17 episodes if they do 2 chapters an episode.<br><br>So they could do the remaining five, but then they'd have to either go to filler or Crabman has to step it up and give us weekly. But considering, I doubt it.<br><br>It will likely end just with Lala's introduction and inclusion to the Harem, then they'll let Crabman get to chapter 48 in about a year and 4 months, assuming no one month breaks, then they can do 12 more episodes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This basically mean no matter who he end up with later, he's going to end with Dulahan-chan by the end right?  <br> This basically mean no matter who he end up with later, he's going to end with Dulahan-chan by the end right? <br>AFTER the end.</br></br>  <br>Reason why you never see Lalafags talking as they know they will win in the end.</br>  <br><br>unless a vampire or something that can grant long life shows up</br></br>  <br>The best teaser guys probably have cuckoloiding fetish in the first place.<br><br>That way it's win-win scenario for all parties.</br></br></br>  <br> They should have just refused to marry instead of living a lie. <br>You're assuming they could. I'm thinking with the size difference, no female could outright overpower a single male, and with enough large stallions making trouble, Centaur society would have been thrown into chaos. So they're building up enough supporters(ie, handsome half-centaurs), while simultaneously waiting for the brutes to die off. It's all about the numbers.</br></br>  <br>Probably not until the Extraspecies Polygamy Bill is passed and he is about to marry all his girls and Smith swoops in to steal his virginity and reap all that built up sexual frustration she built up in him over the time she left him with all these girls.<br><br>I mean, poor Kurusu probably can't even masturbate without the keener senses of the girls noticing the scent.<br><br>Imagine Kurusu spending a long time locked up in his room...<br><br>...then coming out with a sigh of contentment as the girls all peek around the corner at him.<br><br> Rachnera: Enjoy your fapping session, Honey? <br> Cerea: H-how dare you be so lewd!

I'm thinking with the size difference, no female could outright overpower a single male, <br>Except I just showed that they do so on a regular basis.<br><br>Centaur society females hijacked the teaser system and turned it into a boytoy import service. The women basically run this shit because the males are just too dumb. The "Centaur Family" is a sham, the women holding up a lie because they prefer to act like everything is fine. The women had all the power, they just refused to change things officially. Because "Muh Traditions."<br><br>If they cared about traditions so much then they would have got themselves impregnated by the males. Instead the males are basically celebrate now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It will be revealed that she's the most dangerous monster of them all   American  </br>  <br> handsome male who's manly enough to be qualified as a teaser <br> into NTR <br>pick one, not to mention the horse fetish too<br>And even if you can find a guy like that, they're rare breeds, you won't find a horde of them to satisfied the need of an entire race.<br>One teaser for many girls is a different story though. Will that be multi-cuckolding for both parties?<br> the male one got cucked by the centaur every night <br> none of the female centaur love the male </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Suu roomba skins/covers when <br>I bet that could make some decent money and get more people to buy roombas</br></br>  <br>I know, but my extremely limited knowledge (I'm only getting bits and pieces) makes me think she's confusing hitsuji for shitsuji.</br>  <br>lack of sex means she would be extremely lethargic, so uses coffee as a means of masking it.</br>  <br>I'm actually liking that idea.</br>   Exchange student to Centaur Village <br> Exploring the wilderness and researching Harpy Village <br> Traveling to the Snake Village as a "diplomat" <br>Which would you have chosen?</br></br></br>  <br> Papi: Whats going on?

What do you call an Arachne Community. A Hive? A Nest? A Lair? <br>That's the thing, I don't thing they have a community. Sometimes spiders gather, but usually they are so far apart from one another that a male only ever finds one female to mate with in its life time if lucky.</br></br>  <br>Only externally looking. The fact they lay eggs means they have completely different plumbing compared to a human woman.</br>  <br>I know, but It was more of a joke.</br>  <br>I'm sure this means he is going to get alot more money and more sponsors, which means more money for more staff, which might mean faster and more issues.<br><br>Of course, Crabman nearly went insane from the pressure of doing Musume and 12Beast.</br></br></br>  <br>B-But she's part human, she should have "that"!

I'm on my feet constantly at my work.<br>What about burnout?</br></br>  Shirayuki, Charlotte, C*C, Super, Gakkou, Gangsta, Gatchaman, Kekkai (end when), Ninja Slayer, Ore Monogatari, Overlord, Rokka, Ushio to Tora + a bunch of stuff on my backlog and some stuff that hasn't started yet<br><br>Less than last season at least maybe I'll actually finish one of the backlogged shows this time</br></br>  <br>If I get burned out, I study japanese. Since reaching Gundam Seed Destiny in my backlog, I've hit permanent burnout for my backlog, and I've since learned the kana, and 10% of the basic kanji.</br>  <br><br>Himouto<br>Gangsta<br>Overlord<br>Shimoneta<br>Ushio to Tora<br>Teekyuu<br>NNB<br>Sore ga Seiyuu<br>Wakako-ake</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Will keep watching <br>Gatchaman Crowds, Non Non Biyori R, Himouto!

Some of the shorts as well. <br>I've dropped Rokka no Yuusha, Aoharu x Kikanjuu, Game of Laplace, Classroom Crisis, and GATE.</br>  <br>If you didn't spend so much time shitposting on /a/ maybe you could watch more anime. Are you OP? Watching 3 anime per season is pathetic</br>  js06 translated more shit, come see Touma being perfect.   “It’s a love letter!?” <br><br> “Wha-?” <br><br> Kumokawa Seria’s face instantly went pale. <br><br> “Wha-?” <br><br> Misaka Mikoto similarly tensed up while pressed against the wall near the entrance after being chased around by the other students. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   “B-but don’t you have someone you like, a girl you’re interested in, or an older girl you’re always thinking about? Like a nearby upperclassman?” <br><br> “Thaaaat is a completely different issue!! Getting a love letter and having a girl be the one who confesses her love to you is enough to earn one of life’s trophiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss<wbr>ssssssss!!”</wbr> <br><br>Fucking Kamachi. Touma will end up alone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Touma will end up alone. <br>Well at least 2 proactive members of his harem know what to do now at least.</br></br>  Same shit as yesterday,nothing new faggot.  <br> more shit <br>This shit is from last night you shitstain, fuck you for making me think there was more.</br></br>  Where can I buy the novels?  <br>Y-you too.</br>  <br>Don't.<br>Some terms are translated really, really retardedly.</br></br>  Reminder that Nyang Nyang could have killed Mikoto for being a fucking bitch but her retarded plot armor impeded it again.  <br> buying novels </br>   js06 still hasn't finished heavy object <br>REEEEEE</br>  <br>Nyang Nyang a slut.</br>  <br> That Seria Spaghetti <br>I thought a Senpai was supposed to be cool, not a loser.</br></br>  Anyone has the pdfs of the Index novels?<br>I want to compare the official release with the translations, as there are some things bugging me.</br>  <br>https://yadi.sk/d/v3qBTocKh3cgX</br>  <br>Thanks m8.</br>   “Fukiyose-chan! I said that I have a date with black stout later! Ehh, what will happen if I leave it alone!?” <br>Does this mean komoe-sensei is into black dudes?<br><br>Been reading love letter ss because I'm bored.</br></br></br>  <br>You're waifu is a fucking bitch and no one cares. inb4 I'm a butthurt Mikotofag etc<br><br><br> black stout <br>It means she likes her beers.</br></br></br></br></br>  What is Touma up to these days? Haven't read anything in about 4 years. <br><br>Is Accelerator still alive?</br></br>  <br> no one cares <br>You obviously care enough to reply faggot.</br></br>  <br>She wants to get smashed by black stout, read between the lines anon.</br>  <br>But I'm no one, senpai.</br>   PH antics <br> nyang trying to compete with a flat chest and saying no to tsun antics <br>I hope nephy does something or her surviving is going to be terrible.</br></br>  <br>Touma has had a wild life, he got laid with Lessar, Itsuwa, Mikoto, and Othinus (in that order) and has the police on his ass for molesting Birdway. He killed Stiyl in a fist fight and blew up the Tower of London, cucked Crowley on live television, and spends Friday nights playing drinking games with his loli teacher. On top of that he's an American citizen now.<br><br>Accelerator was kill when Last Order electrocuted herself with a conduit and turned off the network. He was in a bathtub at the time and when the connection was cut he drowned in the suds. Yomikawa has left Anti-Skill since then and wears black everyday.</br></br></br>   in the Yen Press release they never say Christianity or Catholicism, but Crossism <br> they leave some terms untranslated but localize others <br><br>The fuck</br></br></br>  <br>Neph is going to BTFO of Mikoto too.</br>  <br> Crossism <br>Gotta love the burgerfats' sensitivity to their religion.</br></br>  <br> reading yen press anything <br> when their translators are buttfuck retarded and absolutely terribad. </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128141276 <br>Who are you quoting retard?</br>  <br>Is this real? This can't be real can it?</br>   Magic god says Touma is the center of the world <br><br>As if I need any more reasons to hate the little bastard. True, it's possible but I doubt it. This series will continue to ignore interesting characters (male and female) to suck Touma's shitty cock.</br></br>  <br> Raildex <br> interesting characters <br><br>Nice joke m8.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The MC is the focus of the series <br>What a shocker that one was!</br></br>  <br>Anon, I...</br>  <br> Faimma <br> Aleister <br> Laura <br> Aiwass <br> Accelerator <br><br>Herp derp no interesting characters here nope</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>None of those characters is interesting.</br>  <br>That would be fine if the MC wasn't a boring sack of shit that's literally shoved down our throats</br>  <br>Well I guess I'm not buying the books then, good bit of money saved there</br>  <br>Learn to speak English before having an opinion on whether or not a character is interesting or not.</br>  <br>To be fair, aside from that and others stupid localizations, the translation isn't bad.<br>It usually flows better than the fan ones.</br></br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with that sentence you nigger.</br>  <br> None of those characters is interesting <br><br>You failed your 7th grade English class, right? You would have had to if you can't spot the mistake</br></br></br>  <br> None of those characters are interesting.  <br>The term 'characters' is a plural.</br></br>  <br> literally shoved down our throats <br>Nobody is forcing you to read this, if you are then you're just forcing it down your own throat.</br></br>  <br>to be fair, kamachi has never used the word of Christianity.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128141859 <br> If I use the word "butthurt" and "moron" and use an epic reaction image, it invalidates the original post </br>  <br>hsv</br>  Reminder that the series peaked with Fiamma and that his powers were so bullshit that Kamachi had to come up with antagonists that were stronger than him and the only thing he could think of were gods. He then realized that the gods were a retarded idea so he's killing them all off.  <br>True, I could drop the series over not liking the MC. But I happen to like the world and a lot of the side characters. I don't get why people can't accept that a series can be liked without caring about the MC</br>  <br>Yes he did.</br>  <br>The only remotely character there is Accelerator. The rest are just as onedimensional and gimmicky as the rest.</br>  <br>I'm still waiting for him to introduce vampires.</br>    <br>WWIII was the best arc. Everyone got a chance to shine. None of this "lol Touma is the center of everything and nobody else matters praise be to Touma" shit NT is giving us</br>  <br> others stupid localizations <br>w-what is it like ?</br></br>  <br>I liked the arc better overall than most of what we've been having sure, but NT9 is the best single book in the series</br>    <br> nobody else got a chance to shine in NT1, 2 , 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 11, or 12 <br>ok anon</br></br>  <br>That's the main reason it was so good. Literally everyone got their time in the spotlight. It was a massive group effort with many different points of view. We got to see Academy City show off their technology, Mikoto fighting the Russians, Hamazura and Takitsubo, Mugino, Double Jesus, Accelerator, Kazakiri, Misha, Aleister, the fucking pope, the English, etc etc. Best fucking arc.</br>  <br> I don't get why people can't accept that a series can be liked without caring about the MC <br>Nobody says you can't, but if you're whining about MC taking the spotlight after 30+ novels of him doing so, then you're just being an idiot. Accept that this series is about Kamijou and take the good with the bad or move on.</br></br>  <br>Just some stupid choices that grind my gears.<br>Like the western naming convention<br> Touma Kamijou <br>Or completely lacking honorifics, Komoe-sensei turns into... Teach.<br><br>But at the same time leaving some terms as is, like Biribiri.<br><br>Also, this one takes the cake for me<br> Blue Hair said "Kamiiiiiiiiiiiiii" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yen Press localization of Spice and Wolf is very good.</br>  <br>All of that has been overshadowed by magic gods and Touma. All of that might as well be fodder to Touma at this point</br>  <br>Oh, this one right at the start also seems stupid.<br> "... There's nothing but comics here..." <br> It was the eighth of August, and Touma Kamijou saw nothing but manga in his bookcase <br><br><br>First they say comics, then manga right after, probably for the same word.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Teach <br>If anything it would be like how you call teachers sir or m'am, jesus christ</br></br>  <br>RAILGUN<br>WHEN<br>FUCKING<br>HELL<br>WHERE ARE THE RAWS?<br>TACT?<br>JS06?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anybody got the download links to everything? All this talk about Touma getting a love letter got me interested.</br>  <br> Teach <br>They really haven't a clue how society works in Japan, do they?</br></br>  <br>How?</br>  <br>Stop bitching over minor things.</br>  <br>I bought it so I can bitch all I want, bitch nigga.</br>  <br> Or completely lacking honorifics, Komoe-sensei turns into... Teach. <br>It's called translating. I get annoyed when shitty fans do an half assed job at translating. Don't have the pic but think "All according to keikaku (translators note: keikaku means plan". Just write all according to plan you fat weeb.<br><br>But teach is a shitty translation though. It's like they're in a shitty 70s high school movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>sup YP<br><br><br>I'm sure they have more than one TL, maybe the guy in charge of Raildex isn't that good.</br></br></br></br>   I had a feeling it was something like this. I didn’t get my hopes at all. Not in the slightest!! You’re probably some magician after Index, so hurry up and attack so I can destroy your illusion alreadyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy<wbr>yyyyy!!”</wbr> <br>Poor man never catches a break.</br>  <br> Don't have the pic but think "All according to keikaku (translators note: keikaku means plan". Just write all according to plan you fat weeb. <br>That became a meme so it's done on purpose, you retard.</br></br>  <br> It's always good when she gets BTFO by other girls.</br>  <br>Probably. I have up to volume 5 of Spice and Wolf from them and the TL is wonderful. I don't think I'm going to pick up their Index localization though.</br>  <br>Taking out honorifics is entirely different than just leaving words completely untranslated. Not to mention no one's even complaining about that but rather that the translation of the honorific completely changes the tone and meaning of the sentence</br>  <br> It's called translating. <br><br>Using BOTH comic and manga as translation for the same word in the same paragraph is translating?<br>BIRIBIRI is translating?<br>Crossism?<br>Also other terms that they left untranslated?<br><br>What I'm mad is that they tried to go for something in the middle, and that fucked up some parts.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have it up to 14 myself and it's been good so far, so maybe there are just different people working on Index rather than S&amp;W like you say.</br>  Soo when are We going to have a new Animu?  <br>Neither of those two scan the raws.</br>  <br>Magic gods make everything seem insignificant. What can someone like ITEM or Amakusa do to compete with all the shit magic gods can do? Why would magic gods care about anyone except Touma? Yes I know they are supposedly dead this volume but are they dead forever? Are all of them dead? Is there a way to stop any more from showing up? I doubt the answers to all these questions are yes</br>  <br>BUT MAYBE THEY KNOW ABOUT IT</br>  <br>Stop typing like a retard. Neither of them would know since the scanner hasn't said anything in the archives, where everyone communicates for scanlating Railgun and Accel.</br>  <br>YOU TOO</br>  <br>I was just venting my own issues. I didn't realise the tranlation job was this bad.</br>  <br>Actually, I take it back. Railgun raws have been uploaded and js06 has translated it so now it's just a matter of waiting for Scanon to typeset it.</br>  <br>As a WHOLE the translation isn't bad.<br>Just average, and some parts are really lacking.</br></br>  <br>We gonna see Saiai the perfection's legs?</br>  <br>Jc staff has moved on to better shit.</br>  <br>What could anyone have done against Fiamma? Seriously, if it wasn't for the invisible thing/ ib auto return, no one except crowley or aiwass could have stopped him, his presence warped reality. Even when he wasn't LPSaD he was way stronger than anyone. I don't see how the magic gods invalidate people more than he did. Not to mention his entire plot centered on touma just like the MG's.</br>  <br>I don't mean power levels, I mean significance. Faimma was one person, not an entire class of being. Also plenty of people helped clean up Faimma's mess.</br>  <br>People forget that Touma can still get wrecked by Saints and a fuckload of other magicians.</br>  <br>Not according to raws.</br>  <br>FUYUKAWAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>It's also only 20 pages.</br>  <br> Seriously, if it wasn't for the invisible asspull thing/ ib auto return, no one except crowley or aiwass could have stopped him <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br><br>We get to see ITEM naked and Mikoto in a cute ninja outfit, so</br></br>  <br> 20 pages <br><br>How does he keep getting away with it?</br></br></br>  <br>Because it still sells good.</br>  <br>He was pretty significant and his actions directly effected the true main villain and the magic gods. Also the entire world fought gremlin and every magic god was beaten by someone besides touma.<br><br><br>eh, the dragon came out in volume 2 and was alluded to be more than izzards imaginations, ib returning was bullshit though iirc stiyl fixed touma's arm the first time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>none of that shit would have worked if ib didn't take touma's arm out of holy right. There is also that bull where the world lost a shit load antagonism while somehow not gaining any for the new threat of the golden arms.</br>  <br>No. No they aren't. The English fanbase corrupted several terms into something more palatable to secondaries. It's nice to be able to read what Kamachi actually wrote for once.</br>  <br>  It's nice to be able to read what Kamachi actually wrote for once. <br><br>Yen Press please.</br></br></br>  <br>Crossism is the correct literal translation, retard. Do you know anything about Japanese? In Index universe, Romans are orthodox and the Russians are catholic. It was changed by secondaries for secondaries.</br>  <br>Yes but all of that gets shat on by "Touma is the center of the world". Perhaps Kamisato will pinch some importance off Touma. Yes, I get it, he's the MC but it's obnoxious to the highest degree that story is making him the only thing of importance.</br>  <br> It's nice to be able to read what Kamachi actually wrote for once. <br>That's impossible unless you're reading it in Japanese.</br></br>  <br>No, he didn't.</br>  <br><br>Fiamma was better because his actions had weight. He wanted to fix the fuck-up in the world's clockwork and then he did it, and it's been like that since then.<br><br>Magic gods can fart from the other side of the galaxy and destroy the world before you can even notice, then decide to take it back and it's like nothing happened.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goddamn, well stihl shouldn't have been smoking at like 6 years old anyways, he was doomed to die early. <br><br>Sucks about accelerator going out like that.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't seriously believe that post do you</br>  <br>And yet people set the bar so high for Biribiri that she's considered garbage just because she can't fight a magic god, despite the fact of the matter being nobody can. This fanbase is beyond the pale.</br>  Aqua&gt;fiamma  <br>Um no?</br>  <br>yeah that is shame, hopefully it is wrong. <br><br>They can, but incidentally despite all their power the only thing truly effected by the magic gods is touma and it seems to be lasting. I'm not just talking ptsd he reads like a different character after NT10. This arc did have an effect on touma which in my opinion is a just as big of a deal as fixing the worlds clockwork.</br></br></br>  <br>But she IS garbage and so is everyone else except Touma. That's the goddamn problem with magic gods.</br>  <br> This fanbase is beyond the pale <br>You just noticed? At least there isn't as much concentrated shitposting about a character as before. In a way it's a good thing we'll never have S3</br></br>  <br><br>I don't remember the details clearly, but was there an explanation for Othinus just making Gungnir out of nothing after making us us go through 8 novels trying to stop it when she could have done it from the start?</br></br>  <br>I dislike Toums and find him extremely boring. That being said, I don't mind him being important as long as everyone else gets their own slice of the plot pie.</br>  <br> and it's like nothing happened <br>Hell that's all Fiamma's "fixing the clockwork" did too, literally nothing of importance happened. "The elements are bent!" "What does that even mean?" "It's ok lol I fixed them already"</br></br>    othinus's segway <br>  the Observer <br>why does kamachi make gods not badass but eccentric ?</br></br>  <br> Toums <br>I don't know why but I laughed a bellyfull, we should refer to him as Toums from now on.</br></br>  Poor Hamazura never gets a break.   mfw this new nigga came and took out the magic gods <br> mfw accel will never take one out now </br>  <br><br> "The elements are bent!" "What does that even mean?" "It's ok lol I fixed them already" <br><br>Now that's how you get shit done.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your reply made me laugh for some reason, too. I agree. We shall call him Toums from now own</br>  <br>Because if you were a god who could do whatever the fuck he wanted would you act all edgy and chuuni or would you instead act like High Priest and fuck around with people? I know which I'd do</br>  <br>To be fair, his break doesn't start until 4 days from there, when Rikou gives him purpose.</br>  <br>Celty can kill Accelerator if she wants. Accelerator fighting a magic god would be like Wham accidentally absorbing half that Nazi in JoJo pt 2</br>  <br> would you act all edgy and chuuni <br>That's for people who pretend to be something better than they are. If you're a god you have every right to do whatever you want, whether it's being quirky or awe-inspiring and godlike.</br></br>  <br>My impression was that Othinus concocted GREMLIN's agenda purely as bullshit so that AC and its allies would be busy tackling politics while she held the real ace up her sleeve. She acknowledged in NT8 and NT9 that the only thing that could have ever really stopped her from making the lance was IB.</br>  <br>Why are Mikotofags so angry? Can't handle the bantz?</br>  <br>So battle royale in railgun soon?</br>  <br>Why are you replying to your post</br>  <br>Honestly I'm not the biggest touma fan myself but he got so little character development in OT that I kinda look forward to the changes. Of course it will be all for naught if he just drops it once the magic god arc is officially done.</br>  <br>No that wouldn't make sense</br>  <br>That annoyed me to be honest.</br>  <br>Gungnir was made to make her attempts at doing anything with magic go 100% positive, once she got fairy spelled she could access 100% negative and just try the opposite thing to make it happen. So she just created Gungnir because she was basically already omnipotent at that point. (Why the hell she didn't then erase the fairy spell is a better question if it was supposedly still slowly killing her)</br>  <br>Battle Royal will be in Accel if it can survive that long.</br>  <br>Why are you assuming samefag?</br>  <br>Not him but I stopped liking him when NT happened. <br><br>I don't know why.</br></br></br>  <br>No you can be edgy and chuuni even if you can back it up, just ask Accel. The point is though that once you have unlimited power you're not going to use it on stupid shit like making everyone kneel before your "supreme and mighty power", or if you do it won't be for long because that gets boring fast.</br>    <br>Is that a nipple</br>  <br><br>Was there even a backlash for trying to make the spear anyway? If it was 50/50, she would only need to try a few times and it'd be done.</br></br>  <br>It's on the wrong part of her breast if it is, it's likely just the brown of her hair</br>  <br>We might get glimpses of it. Uiharu gets her shit kicked in by Kakine, so we'll probably see Accel vs. Kakine.<br><br>It's impossible to shoehorn Mikoto into Battle Royale arc like they did for the sports festival.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just wait for  the Index manga, we're almost to Kihara-kun </br></br>  <br>No one is even translating that shit.</br>  <br>I don't know exactly how the backlash works, but I assume it's proportional to what you're attempting to accomplish. Like how when she attacked Ollerus!Thor and lost her arm, I assume she would have exploded had she tried and failed to get the spear.<br><br>At the same time though if this is true it begs the question of why she tried killing the Invisible Thing, maybe if you assume she knew Touma had shit luck you can brush by it.</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit</br>  <br>I think Touma's more interesting in NT since OT was all about setting him up on a pedestal. NT takes that pedestal and beats him upside the head with it.<br><br>But personally, I want more Shiage and Accel centered volumes. Volume 15 and 19 were great because it showed us that big events were going on that didn't need to have Touma at the center.</br></br></br>  Kakine manga when?  <br>Touma or no more Dark Side of AC plots would be nice. Hard to pull off though at this point since we're getting right into the Kiharas and the general power level has skyrocketed. But hey NT11 happened so who knows</br>   this thread <br>Remember when Raildex fans weren't this salty about everything?</br>  <br>No, but I do remember when we were better at ignoring it and not bitching about it the whole thread to make it worse</br>  <br>This. But the magic gods have ensured that anything like this (unless it involves Accelerator/Kakine/Mikoto powering up) will be nothing but filller</br>  <br>tfw don't want to see Tetsumou hurt</br>  How high was kamachi when he created this character?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128141276 <br> making up quotes <br> retard </br></br>  <br> Wanting monthly chapters of battle royale arc <br><br>Nah.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I want more Shiage and Accel centered volumes. <br><br>What are they going to do? Their stories are pretty much done at this point, they found peace. They've settled down and only participate in NT volumes when someone messes with their homes, unlike Touma who's in for endless adventure around the globe.<br><br>Honestly, it felt rather forced how the tried to make them fit into the magic plot in early NT, they had personal reasons to act in NT1 and then were simply invited to have a chat about wizardry and invited to deal with shit they had nothing to do with.<br><br>They'll just be in filler until Aleister comes for Accel for endgame.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I always viewed OT as more character creation than development. Him trying to piece together a personality from the bits and pieces of "Touma" he got from the people around him.  Who is going to win the Touma bowl?  <br>He's going to die</br>  <br>Your mother.</br>  <br>me koto </br>  <br>Misaka Memekoto? I don't think so.</br>  <br>I said it before, the winner will be his tomb.</br>  <br><br> Mugino <br><br>She must be pregnant every day for the rest of her life. That body is criminal and demands it.</br></br></br></br>  http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_1</wbr></wbr>  <br>Not anymore, her body is mostly prosthetics now.</br>  <br><br>So basically, Delta Force could have their way with her and she'll never get pregnant.<br><br>Neat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Index most likely.</br>  <br>Not with her robot arm being able to break their spines.</br>  <br><br>Heaven Canceller will fix it.</br></br>  <br> "Imagine Breaker is merely an addition to your true nature. Or rather, as the wish of all magicians was wandering aimlessly, it was drawn in by your true nature. You could call it a trivial interference. The name Kamijou Touma, or the One who Purifies Gods and Slays Demons, was not given to the power of your right hand. It was given to you, wasn’t it? Thus, the center of the issue is not the records of your past or the power in your right hand. It is you yourself.” <br><br><br>i dont get it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma is a special snowflake</br>   I said before that the various world-shaking incidents had occurred within your reach, but how many people were injured or lost on the way to those conclusions? You completed everything from beginning to end, but have you ever scored a perfect 100 as you did so? …But if you score us and you alter the world as you wish, the distortions brought by us Magic Gods can change that. <br>Fucking hell even the magic gods won't let the man live down the people he did not save.</br>  <br>holy shit why did no one notice the giant fuxking hand slamming the building?</br>  <br> Railgun manga getting lewder and lewder <br><br>I'm okay with this.</br></br></br>  <br> High Priest just wants Touma to lead the Magic Gods and tell them when they're living their lives incorrectly <br>So that joke about them treating Touma as their senpai and getting jealous of Othinus moving in on him turned out to be true?</br></br>  Are Mikotofags BTFO yet?  <br>No it's still a shitty memeworthy joke. They want him to act like a mediator. There's no senpai or jealousy to it</br>  <br><br> Kuroko wearing a thong to work in that short skirt <br><br>13 year olds, dude.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Crossism <br> right <br>Epic</br></br></br>  So Touma gets confessed like 37 volumes ago yet he is seemingly happy for getting a letter.<br><br>If that isn't being an ass I don't know what is.<br><br> his face when it was High Priest all along <br>serves him right</br></br></br></br></br>   even magic gods were tired of how op they are   <br> TouMAN declines godhood and fights godhood itself <br><br>Classic TouMAN</br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't that what his name means anyway?</br></br>   I may claim to ‘understand’ Othinus, but I only know her as a girl. I don’t understand anything when it comes to her being a Magic God.” <br>I like this expression.</br>  <br> The Magic Gods want him to become god. <br> Rejects it. <br><br>Calling it now. He will use that cheat code at the end of of the series, provided there are still Magic Gods left.</br></br></br></br>  <br> High Priest was right all along <br>I mean maybe, but it would kind of ruin the whole point of this volume</br></br>  <br>Unless he completely breaks and becomes Demon Lord Touma like some of us half-jokingly said before I seriously bought it since that would go against his entire "theme" so to speak.</br>  <br>I called it earlier in the archives. I 100% agree with you. Unless there are no magic gods left and no possibility of more showing up, the end of the series will be him getting godhood</br>  <br><br>If the high priest is right, he'd just have to watch everything go to shit first before agreeing to it. Which wouldn't negate the point at all</br></br>  <br>But there are candidates, like Index...meaning she will become relevant again!</br>  <br>That's what I'm thinking tbh</br>  Calling it now. The ending will have everyone die with a bonus of Touma seeing the main cast die. He will tearfully make the deal with Magic God Index to bring everyone back and happy, very much like the perfect world  <br>No, agreeing to a god button like that would completely break the point of humans living their lives with "freedom" and accepting the danger rather than a "happiness" given by somebody looking down upon them.<br>That's why he could actually bring himself to turn his back on the "perfect" world Othinus created. Even with Will telling him to think about himself a bit, the fact that the people weren't actually really "living" was another part of why he could do so. <br>Even if things went to shit and he did take the offer, he would be completely broken by that point.</br></br></br>  <br>If he saw everyone dead and it wasn't a magic god tantrum like NT9, he'd take the deal regardless</br>  <br>Possibly yeah, but like I said, he'd be completely broken by that point. It would be a very slippery slope, fix one problem with the god button, fix em all.</br>  <br>this ln should change title into To Aru Imagine Breaker no Touma</br>  <br>Back to facebook</br>  <br> “What you’re talking about is no different from the happy world Othinus showed me in the very, very end. It may look perfect at first glance, but it’s really a reign of terror that forces your own values on everyone else. It’s no different from saying you can be happy in solitary confinement because they give you clothes, food, and shelter.”  <br><br>TOUMAAAAAA</br></br></br>  <br>what</br>   High Priest and Nyang-Nyang shit on Mikoto <br> they die <br><br> Neph doesn't shit on Mikoto <br> she lives </br></br></br></br>  <br>wait the fucking sec<br><br>did touma just refuse being a god?<br><br>W<br>H<br>Y<br><br>W<br>O<br>U<br>L<br>D<br><br>Y<br>O<br>U<br><br>REFUSE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Neph doesn't shit on Mikoto <br>You still don't know that.</br></br>  <br>He would be completely at their mercy.<br>They may change their mind.<br>This is not a deal as equals, but as king and pawn.</br></br></br>  <br>He already learned his lesson from Will-chan, and he's sticking to it</br>  <br> selfish <br> against imposed happiness <br><br>Is Touma officially a Chaosfag now?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Touma's answer to the mummy literally confirms the best ship there is in the whole raildex.<br>  Touma x Suffering  </br></br>  <br>like i've said multiple times in these threads, toumas job is literally to do everything.<br>hell he even has a title or some shit for that now.</br></br>  <br>Man, this volume is fascinating so far, and I guess IB keeping him from receiving the blessings of the gods is definitely confirmed now</br>  <br>Nigga's a neutralfag, Chaos is filled with assholes he'd want to punch</br>   The mummy’s dried neck had completely broken and his head was lying horizontally. It shook as he moved, so it was reminiscent of a fruit still on the branch after it had rotted too much for even the birds to touch it. <br>Shaft for Index Season 7.</br>  <br> magic gods are literally lawfags <br>i could see it.<br>though he doesn't like other chaosfags, thats pretty clear, thats why he keeps pimpslapping accelerator around.</br></br></br>   He pictured the faces of Index, Misaka Mikoto, and all the others close to him. <br><br> He imaged a horrible conclusion where they were essentially thrown into an oxygen-supplied and heat-controlled aquarium and made into decorative tropical fish. <br><br>I need this drawn now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because Touma doesn't subscribe to the whole "the strong survive and do whatever they want" mentality so much as he wants people to be free to live their lives as they will without others coming by and fucking them up</br>  <br> that feel when half of them would be entirely alright living like that. </br>  <br>i'll agree with that.<br>my question at this point is if pre amnesia touma had this problem would he line up to be a lawfag or not?</br></br>  <br>Just about all the information we have about pre amnesia Touma is OT1 and NT11 only. Judging from those I'd say he would probably jump at the chance for a wish that could save everybody and not fully understand what it would mean like he does now. This is largely because he would have never experienced NT9.</br>  <br>why wouldn't he?<br>i'd imagine he would just so he feels like hes relevant.<br>i still think pre amnesia touma actually knew what in the actual shit the ability under IB actually did.<br><br>also as time goes on more and more i'm convinced the guy is actually a lv 6 gemstone buried under IB goodness.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lv 6 gemstone <br>Limb Exploder maybe. The main thing people like the Magic Gods or other antagonists talk about when they say Touma is special for reasons other than IB is his nature not that he has a better IB or a better power under IB or something. He might have them but it would be entirely pointless for him to have those kinds of powers</br></br>  <br>pre amnesia would probably taken the chance</br>  So... Othinus wasn't only a cold blooded terrorist by human means but also huge faggot by magic god standards who takes all shared sandbox for herself alone. Add to this that she screwed over hew own allies and she like literally the worst of all characters here.  <br>Othinus is kind.</br>  <br><br>Yes, BUT she is kind to Touma.</br></br>  <br><br> Murdered and tortured him thousands of times <br> Kind </br></br></br>  <br>Well, she is someone who would "betray" everyone's expectations of her.</br>  <br>She wasn't even aware that the other Magic Gods existed, it's hard to feel bad about or avoid screwing over people you don't know exist. Besides didn't High Priest say they were instead fighting amongst themselves elsewhere? Like in the section that Othinus was unable to affect?</br>  <br><br>She also smells good.</br></br>  <br>But Touma himself says she's kind.</br>  <br>Touma is a retard with stockholm syndrome and PTSD</br>  <br>This chapter only confirmed his understanding of Othinus as a girl, not a a Magic God. In other words, Kamijou has no idea who Othinus really is as a Magic God and their ideals.</br>  <br>doesnt matter he still said she is kind</br>  <br> Add to this that she screwed over hew own allies <br>She gave them all that they asked for and more, they just can't remember the other phases.</br></br>  <br>Her kindness lies on her character as a girl.</br>  <br>That's not what it means, he means he understands her personality, values and such, but that he obviously can't understand what it's like to be a magic god and stand above the world. For example he does understand things like her feelings of wanting desperately to get back to her world and friends but does not understand specifics for how it would be achieved or the like.</br>  <br>so she is perfect for touma since both of then are faggots</br>  Would you agree with High Priest deal?  <br>butthurt mikotofag detected</br>  <br>Probably, which is why I wouldn't be offered it</br>  <br>  girl who betray everyone's expectations <br>  boy who destroys everyone's illusions <br>They basically practice same kind of faggotry with crushing dreams and everything.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes. Yes i would.</br></br>  I usually see a lot of hate towards mikoto. <br>Why do many people hate her?</br>  <br>She's popular and appears consistently throughout the series.</br>  <br>she wears shorts to hide her penis</br>  <br>Because she's a Houki-tier tsundere. <br><br>People hate Houki too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Her moments have become stale and irritating when something more plot relevant can be done.</br></br>  <br>She's violent and can't get her shit together whenever Touma's around. I like her otherwise but those times have grown rare</br>  <br> Watch out for Misaka Mikoto<br> The public enemy of Raildex #1<br> She is mainly responsible for...<br> Index's Collar<br> Damaging Index's bowels which make her digest food faster<br> The attempted stabbing of a young Touma<br> The Parameter List<br> The distortion of the elements causing Angel Fall<br> Giving Ridovia the idea of invading Academy City<br> Kanzaki leaving the Amakusa<br> Murdering Agnese's parents<br> Abandoning Angelene and Lucia in Milan<br> Pre-memory loss Touma being angry at Misaki<br> Egging kids to attack a young Accelerator<br> The rollercoaster that killed Vento's brother<br> Rise in pirated Gekota merchandise<br> Worldwide illegal trafficking of gemstones<br> Othinus eviscerating Othinus<br> Touma failing to save the world<br> Radio Noise Project<br> Level 6 Shift<br> Dolly<br> Kuroko not being the protagonist of Railgun<br> Chemicaloid Project<br> Pissing off powerless geniuses<br> Aborting a fetus<br> Shocking thugs into a indefinite vegatative state<br> The punching bag girl from volume 19<br> The decline of 19'th school district<br> The bombing of Seventh Mist<br> Giving Accelerator a caffeine addiction<br> Sexual relations with pigs, underage</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>U wot m8?</br>  <br>I haven't been visiting Raildex threads as much anymore. Did Haimura ever deliver casual Vento?</br>  <br>She is weak compared to the mid and up magic side.</br>  <br>Of course  not .</br>  <br> Did Haimura ever deliver casual Vento? <br>Shit, it's been so long I rarely ever see people bring this up anymore.<br><br> Also, no. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I grew tired of seeing her throughout the series when she almost never has any consistent character development. She's more of a tease than anything.</br>  <br>She's getting the shit Index used to get when she was relevant. <br><br>Ironically, Mikotofags were the main shitposters against Index. <br><br>Sweet, sweet justice.</br></br></br></br></br>   fucking the One who Purifies Gods and a Magic God <br> they understand each other as a boy, as a girl <br>say whatever, this is why I'm othinusfag.</br></br>    <br>Back to Facebook</br>  <br>It's ok anon, I know it'll never happen but we can dream</br>  <br>So Othinusfags really are just shippers.</br>  <br>What if you liked her before the end of NT9?</br>  <br>You expected them to be anything else?</br>  <br>She went from best girl in volume 1 to one of the most annoying and uninteresting girls 37 volumes later.</br>    <br><br>It was inevitable considering the events that transpired in her own arc. <br><br>An entire arc dedicated to understanding and then saving a single girl from the world, which shipper wouldn't go mad? You're blaming them for something they were born with.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was fucking obvious that Othinusfags had nothing to go on but shipping. There isn't much information on her other than her connection to Touma. It's not like she'd been around for 30 volumes doing things unrelated to Touma</br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with shipping if the series itself dedicates a whole two-partner arc to the development of the relationship between a boy and a girl. Plus it died down with the whole 15cm fairy thing.<br><br>At this point, it's more like a bat and Arararagi kind of relationship.</br></br></br>   Mikoto says she has a lot she wants to say to Accelerator <br> 10 volumes later they haven't interacted since <br><br>Why, Kamachi?</br></br></br>   “You only enter your serious mode when you remove your briefs!?”   <br>Mikoto is I R R E L E V A N T.</br>   *1.　56,549　*56,549　Shinyaku Toaru Majutsu no Index Vol.13 <br><br>DED<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank the cover for its sales.</br>  <br> Jul 6 - 12  <br>just 2 days.<br>http://myanimelist.net/forum/?topic<wbr>id=1406214</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Based Mikoto.</br>  <br> died down <br><br>You poor deluded soul</br></br></br>  <br>He's saving that for later. Or it'll get buried under "muh Touma" like everything else</br>  <br>Compare current threads to NT10 threads.</br>  <br>There's still plenty of "Othi a best, no other girl has a chance"</br>  <br>Ded.</br>  <br>You don't even have to be a shipper nor an Othinusfag to see that she was the only girl that was realistically close to win the Toumabowl. I'm sure many people just use that as convenient battering ram to beat other shippers over the head.</br>  <br>her appearance in novel is useless</br>  <br>In series it has at least</br>  <br><br>Othinus is the kindest, therefore the best</br></br>  <br>And then there's fucks like this</br>  <br>fuck off touma</br>  <br>No shit. It's retarded, much like shipping in this series at all</br>  <br><br> implying she isn't the kindest </br></br>  <br><br><br>I bet your Goddess doesn't smell as good as Othinus</br></br></br>  <br>No it hasnt, did you even read NT12?</br>  <br> worst criminal in the series  <br> kind <br><br>Spout more epic maymays pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>Silvia pls go.</br>  <br>Mikoto smells wonderful actually. Touma agrees don't bother him about it.</br>  <br> tfw somewhat disappointed that the Electric Princess doesn't smell like ozone </br>  There is nothing wrong with shipping even if you know she will not get bowl.<br>Me? I like Misaki.</br>  <br>Her shampoo smells good. Touma likes Index's natural smell more.</br>  <br>what with touma and scents?</br>  <br> Othinus <br>What happens when you smell a sexy goddess, it becomes a fetish.</br></br>  Do people really hate Mikoto that much or is it epic lulsy shitposting when people actually don't give that much of a shit  <br><br>It's more of hating Mikotofags actually. They're cunts. The character herself is okay-ish, but her fanbase is very rabid</br></br>  <br>I've seen haters being far more rabid than her fans.</br>  <br>That's because you've surely not seen one of their autistic THK shitfests.</br>  <br>I've seen that too. The spamming is more autistic in my opinion.</br>  <br>To be fair, Mikotofags are still better than Frendafags. Now that's a fanbase beyond help.</br>  <br><br>Reminder that Touma rejected the Perfect World because Frenda was allowed to be alive in there. Frenda a shit</br></br>  <br>Did you read NT10? It's died down a hell of a lot, it's there sure but it's not as in your face</br>  <br>It usually starts with bait cancer but overzealous fans are dumb enough to respond every time, hard to say which is worse. Probably the former by a very slim margin. For all I know I'm replying to one this very moment.<br><br><br>Same applies here, though honestly I don't remember any shitstorms about her while Railgun S was airing. Just goes to show both sides in these retarded shitstorms are new as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Worst criminal in the series <br> Not Terra </br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure scents have been present in the series long before Othinus showed up, Kamachi just has a thing for it and by extension has given it to Touma</br>  WHERE WERE YOU WHEN HIGH PRIEST WON THE TOUMABOWL?  <br> The worst criminals are Touma and Othinus.<br> Touma killed 7 billion people and Othinus killed like 7 billion people x 100billion+</br></br>  I didn't expect a mummy to be such a funny character.  <br>He went from worst to best magic god in one chapter</br>  So Touma is pretty much confirmed to be Jesus?  #6 Level 5 when?  Will there be a PDF when it is done being translated? I don't find it as comfy reading it directly on Baka Tsuki  Nothing against the Magic Gods but they Lack style.If you power makes everthing<br>Meaningless simply dont use it! I bet at that Moment somewere in the Toaru world<br>GOD is simple chilling it out.</br></br>  Reminder that Touma's True Will, his destiny, and for NasuFags, his Origin, is suffering, in fact, that's why he got the worst shit in history by gaining Imagine Breaker.  <br>No, Kamachi is setting him up to become Demon Lord when he loses "something"</br>   M-my Railgun didn’t cause that, did it? <br>Maybe she should stop firing it on Touma then.</br>   Kamijou Touma, you are the one who stopped World War Three with a single fist and even worked out a compromise with the extreme irregularity known as Imagine Breaker.[...] <br><br>I don't know if he is talking about pre-amnesia Touma or Touma during his showdown with Fiamma</br></br>  <br>Maybe he's talking about how Touma is actually making good use of Imagine Breaker.</br>  <br>Uh that could be it. Also nice to see that he didn't drop his suicidal tendencies from NT12<br><br> He lowered his hips, hit the High Priest with his shoulder, and threw his entire body weight into him. <br><br> He did not hesitate to throw himself past the broken metal fence and off of the four story rooftop. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> By this point he must have realized he won't die anyway.</br>  <br> You didn't get it.<br> They want to use their power for whatever the fuck they want but that would cause fight between Magic Gods, so they want Touma to act as some kind of mediator or referee.</br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>If you think about it, even without his prison explaination, that job isn't really something for Touma who just wants to lead a normal life. Who the fuck wants to be a babysitter of a couple of Gods anyway.</br>  would you read ?  <br>Well, High Priest looks like a cool guy</br>  I don't know why, but I feel like Touma will become like Demi-Fiend in the end  Did this one get translated?  <br>Doesn't look like Kamikoto to me, so no.</br>  <br>We've talked about this, and he will most likely turn into a Demon Lord.</br>    <br>Well Demi-Fiend can become a Demon Lord too basically, or something like this  can happen too, after all he will suffer.</br>  <br> goes full demon lord <br> uses that scaling power thats implied <br> +DRAGONS <br> + IB <br>god damn touma would be one hell of a boss baddie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that NT is just a long story of how a hero lived long enough to see himself become the villain.<br><br>Why kill the MC when you can turn him into the bad guy and replace him with a new one?</br></br></br>  <br>so how would that work?<br>like would it be where he takes over the world/phases and all thats left is accel and hamazura trying to stop his stupid shit for not living his life correctly?</br></br>  <br>hold old touma is if we counted the infinite hell world time<br><br><br>Feels like his been suicidal of his action lately that it looks like his just pretending to act like the kamijou touma after his memories got erased.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He just wants to fucking die already but these bitches don't let him.</br>  <br>Still mad about that</br>  <br>That bittersweet ending was perfect really. I'm still mad too, but it's a great ending.</br>  <br> Mikoto on the cover would boost the sales <br><br>Time to bring out that anime adaptation too boost sales again.</br></br></br>    <br>Yes I'm not a faggot like touma and hope everyone he cares about dies now.</br>  <br>The sales will go up to 120k like always.</br>  Okay, so now we have even further questions. What the fuck is Touma?  <br>Suffering incarnate.</br>  <br>Suffering itself</br>  Reminder that "the Observer" is real and that it is Aogami Pierce! He even saved the students thanks to him stealing female panties.  <br>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law, given flesh</br>  All our original assumptions were overturned. Imagine Breaker isn't important. The invisible thing isn't important. In fact, it seems to be that both those things were attracted to Touma specifically and thus aligned themselves with him. The important one is Touma himself. Even his name appears to be important.  “I already told you, didn’t I? It is a matter of sooner or later, of before or after you lose something.”<br><br>All this talk about touma losing something is giving me hype</br></br>  <br> touma has legitimately a plethora of powers that he either can't touch at will or he chooses hard not to use <br> we will probably see all of his bullshit as soon as he snaps <br> and proceed to be the scariest fuck in the entirety of raildex. </br></br></br>  <br>The one who purifies Gods and slay demons</br>  Touma unlocking the true power of IB and the Dragons when?  <br><br>;_;</br></br>  <br>That would make sense <br><br>His job that his not doing properly is to make people face the harsh reality<br><br>No wonder that after so long Kamisato finally reveals himself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i don't even think those 2 are his biggest bullshit powers now, i still think the fact he can get control of every magic gods powers to do shit at will and in addition whatever the actual shit his esper ability is even worse.</br>  <br>He is dead inside mate, we are here for the ride of suffering.</br>  <br>That's because the Magic Gods willingly choose to listen to him though.</br>  <br>Yeah, until Touma bring headband girl, I was pretty sure that High Priest was talking about Aogami.</br>  <br>i still think aogami is aihana, i don't really think the observer thing is for him.<br>his actions seem a little weird for that role.</br></br>  <br>Remember that Aogami casually mentions events he was not present in but talks about it like he observe them all.<br><br>Also funny because he was the final boss in the parody series.</br></br></br>  Man, this joke just isn't gonna work in the anime (if they ever adapt it). That headband girl hasn't shown up at all in the shows.  <br> Implying an Index 7 will ever exist </br>  <br>The Observer is us, anon, don't you see? He is the center because we made him the center. It is our fault he is suffering and it is our fault he is heading to Demon Lord territory.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>She did appear in daihaseisai and in the second to last episode alongside spiky haired glasses girl. Her design was different though.</br>  <br>I kind of think kamisato isn't going to be truly relevant; hes probably gonna get lolnouken'd<br>If someone relevant dies to make touma snap, i personally think its gonna be on crowleys end causing an unholy hellstorm of AC getting its entirety kicked in by a pissed off perfectly normal student.</br></br>  <br>That's some peculiar scanning cover, might I ask what you're using?</br>  <br>Holy shit</br>  <br> not Himegami <br>There is a reason no one ever notices her /a/non.</br></br>  <br> The Observer simply remains by your side at all times and watches everything you do. They know the answers to the questions before they are given, they compile it all, and they construct a massive collection of information. <br> This world is nothing but a story told from the Observer’s point of view. <br>That would be Kamachi. He's telling us the story from his point of view.  And Miki's because muh sales </br></br></br>  i have no idea what is a normal highschool boy. I guess normal highschool boys possseses normal superpowers..  <br>What if it is Academy City 's AI ? It looks like Aleister 's PC .</br>  <br>Plot armor.</br>  <br>touma is demonbane in normal highschooler form<br>thats the only explanation for this shit at this point.</br></br>  <br>Satan confirmed giving touma plot armor<br><br><br>fuck you satan</br></br></br></br>  <br>Satan please</br>   mfw touma is definitely gonna lose someone close to him now   <br>shit, it's gonna be Othinus isn't it</br>  <br>othinus is distraction</br>  <br>killing the most longest person he knows should break him.</br>  <br> mfw it's Misaka </br>  <br>My dick is diamonds.</br>  <br>so who is in index verse is labelled as the tragic girl and barely notice?</br>  <br> mfw kamachi actually kills off tsuchimikado </br>  <br>NO YOU FUCKER, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT</br>    <br> killing off the guys best friend <br> especially if said friend has the ability of regen and magical shenanigans <br>i can see it.<br>he already nearly died in NT 7</br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw Kamijou's normal parents brought their only son to the world to suffer because he's a special snowflake. </br>  <br> the only boy Touma ever cried for <br>I could see it.</br></br>  <br>i still think ot 2 which touma snap was scary<br><br>damn nigga can act like a serial killer if he wants to.</br></br></br>  <br> TouMAN is literally bullshit incarnate <br> there were hints in OT that TouDAD is exactly the same way <br><br>theres some seriously weird shit going on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I almost dropped this shit when i thought he died in NT7.</br>  <br> yfw both touDad and touMOM are gods </br>  Sooo... I just finished watching all the animes.<br><br>Which volume shall i start from?</br></br>  <br>Vol 1.</br>  <br>Go away Observer-chan.</br>  <br>Volume 14 if you want to continue where the anime left off. You can read Volume 2 and 4 to see the difference in adaptation. In fact, go back to square one and might as well read Volume 1.</br>  <br><br>Whta if Touma's parents are actually dead now, but Crowley somehow hide this fact.</br></br>  <br> read the volume 13 epilogue then 14 </br>  <br> she will never observe your dick whenever and wherever you are <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br>Start from volume 1, anime changes some content, and misses a lot of small details you can only get from the inner monologue and shit</br>  <br>You trying to put a nigga off?</br>  <br>Volume 1 if you want to get the full package (since the anime glosses over alot of important shit), though fair warning that the translations for the early books are generally iffy and Kamachi's inexperience at writing is very evident back then.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks.<br><br>I'll try to start reading from volume 1 and hope it isn't half as boring as the anime.<br><br>Otherwise i'll give up and start from 14</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Volume 14.<br><br>No need to reread pointless shit from the beginning when you've already seen the anime except volume 2 and 4 i guess.</br></br></br>  <br>There are both the fantranslation and the official translation for the first 3 volumes</br>  <br><br><br>Now i'm confused</br></br></br>  After yen press get to volume 5 the later volumes are gonna be shit until 13 right?  <br><br>Plus some of the volumes reveal more stuff about the Level 6 Shift. If you're not going to read it, well<br><br> The entire thing was bullshit from start to finish. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I like volumes 6 and 8, at least.</br>  <br>Basically you've got two options. <br><br>Read from Volume 1. You'll get more indepth knowledge about the setting and character's motivations, but the early books are just undeniably worse and the translations are crap.<br><br>Volume 14+. These books are better and the translations almost always superior, though you'll miss some of the intricate details. You'll probably pick alot of it up anyways though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't be a faggot, when you are going from a anime adaptation to source material, you always start from the beginning. More so, since Index does tons of foreshadowing, and has tons of small details early on that come up later.<br><br>The first few volumes are fucking horrible, but are honestly needed to understand quite a few things occurring</br></br></br>  <br><br>12 was awesome. A bit of a very small reprieve for Touma before all hell breaks loose for there is no rest for the wicked.</br></br>  i just remembered Misaka was suppose to be the heroine of this volume...  <br>Weren't the earlier volumes edited by Js06 before they were abandoned?</br>  <br>To be honest he might as well just read from volume 14 and on the way pick up volume 2 from yen press and 4 which comes out soon.</br>  <br>Only the first iirc</br>  <br>Edited yes, but that just means he fixed all the major errors in translation, the small stuff like sentence structure is still there.</br>  <br>With all his suffering, Touma is the heroine and the one in need of rescuing.</br>  <br>I'm probably gonna stop buying the volumes after the fifth one until 15 comes out.</br>   says that if the world is truly ruled by a distorted system he will destroy god's illusions in volume 1 <br> he is actually going to do it <br><br>Gunha was right, Touma has a lot of guts</br></br></br>  <br>He was talking about God-god, not magic gods.</br>  <br> implying there is a God </br>  <br>May be it was a multi dimesional being?</br>  <br>If god doesn't exist, why do the miracles of god exist?</br>    <br>Even if such a being existed by all means and porposes the magic gods are the true God of raildex since they are the ones that created everything that existed and shit</br>  <br>Because Othinus is kind</br>  <br>But magic gods were humans to begin with.</br>  <br>this.</br>  <br>Created by other magic gods and so on<br>The whole if god created everything who created god is a bit of a pointless argument</br></br>  <br>From where did the first magic god come, then?</br>  <br>They didn't create "everything". They started on a basic plane that existed from the start and modified it. That's what Othinus meant by the Silver Star (Aleister) altering the "Pure World", aka said basic plane, while the other Magic Gods just piled phases on phases.</br>  <br>What if everything is just Touma dream?<br>And he will wake up when someone close to him die this time?</br></br>  <br>Humans created magic</br>  <br>Thats a plothole in religion itself, that is why I said it was pointless<br>Even in real academic debates about real religious texts it all boils down to glorified waifu wars</br></br>  <br><br><br> Wrong a Magic God is a God of Magic. <br> In Nt2 Birdway told us about magic this: <br> “In a time before there was a distinction between &gt;science and the occult, someone was <br> jealous of some kind of religious miracle or the &gt;powers they saw in a natural esper which <br> the environment had created by pure chance. This &gt;person did not understand what they <br> saw, but he yearned for it. He wanted to be special &gt;himself, and he began to feel that it <br> was unacceptable for him be normal. That was &gt;how it began.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Wrong a Magic God is a God of Magic. <br> &gt;In Nt2 Birdway told us about magic this: <br>sorry i quoted wrong</br></br></br>    <br><br>What about the angels then? They're supposed to serve God.</br></br>  <br>They are nothing but piles of condensed thelesma, as far as we know there is no evidence of them serving God other than the claims of the magicians witnessing them, most of which are religious people</br>  <br>They serve God if not then they would be per definition be Fallen Angels.<br>But the question if God exist or not is meaningless.We know that the Pure world is a would without Phases and Magic.This means in this World does GOD not exist.And the pure World is the Original World.</br></br>  <br>In a Christian POV maybe<br>Also it is not safe to assume shit about the pure world considering that Othinus and Aleister may be wrong about it, if this arc proves anything is that not even them know everything</br></br>  <br>first magic god was simply some dickhead looked at religion one day and said "i can do that" and thus it happened.<br>its the concept of god being cyclical, where god made man made god made man.</br></br>  Man, High Priest looks like a cool guy, I didn't expect such a nice conversation between him and Touma. Very interesting.<br><br> Chapter end with Misaka joining <br><br>Oh boy here we go, looks like the time for philosophy is over, time for T S U N D E R E~</br></br></br></br>  do time travellers appeared yet?  <br>yea but she said:<br> The man who names himself the Silver Star seems to have been attempting to directly <br> tamper with the ‘pure world’ beyond all the filters…that is, the world of science that is <br> unaffected by religion. …Honestly, you are quite fortunate to see this. Not even the Golden <br> cabal of Europe that dreamed in Tibet was able to reach this point. <br>Even if she doesnt know a thing she noticed that he did something.<br>And in Nt11 we found out that he is using the Archetype controller.<br>isn´t that the first Magic which is does not belong to Religion at all?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.co<wbr>m/wiki/Red_Player<br>http://toarumajutsunoindex.wikia.co<wbr>m/wiki/White_Player</wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>I think there was one in the games</br>  <br>Thelema and science could be consider a religion in this context<br>Also Aleister may be wrong and the pure world be nothing more than an illusion<br>This could all be Aiwass trolling</br></br></br>   it all returns to nothing   <br>yea but the difference between for religion and science is obvious<br><br>For exemple High priest:<br><br>He was qualified enough to be a Buddha.But because people simple said he was no Buddha<br>he didn´t become a Budddha.If self-mummication would be a scientific process he would Definitely become a Buddha no matter what people say .</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one can escape time; it delivers us all to the same end.</br>  Isn´t bad that the Magic Gods are not there any more?<br> Just as humans wither up all on their own if they forget to breathe or eat, the world will roll down the hill to destruction if it is simply left to the ravages of time. &gt;The world has only lasted to this day and this moment because a great many people are desperately holding that giant snowball up and keeping it from &gt;rolling down. <br><br> The world will not be destroyed because something special happens. <br><br> The world is only being maintained because something special is happening. <br><br> In that case, it would only be natural to run across such an ending from time to time. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're extremely associated with memory which he does not have.</br>  It's just me or is Kamachi adding every theory that the fans came with in this chapter?  <br>It probably means that the world is pretty much fucked now. Thanks a lot, Kamisato.</br>  <br>Touma could have stopped this, it is all his fault</br>  <br> the time for philosophy is over, time for T S U N D E R E~ <br>And shitposting. Don't forget the shitposting. God forbid if Misaka does anything in the story, there will be shitposting about it. She can eat a sandwich and people will find a way to shitpost about it.</br></br>  Man, NT13 wasn't fully translated yet, can you guys at least use spoiler tags for the untranslated shit?<br>Please, don't let these threads turn into /v/.</br>  <br> it's always Touma's fault even if he is not there <br> even if he is not informed of what is happening <br> even if people is deliberately hiding information from him that could help people or some new information about his power <br>Fukou da.</br></br></br></br>  Is there some kind of infographic showing all story arcs in chronological order?  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Just go release date man</br>  <br>Just leave the threads until it's all translated. I did that for NT11 and 12 and it was good not knowing what happened/not having seen the illustrations before. You're not missing much in the threads, anyway.</br>  <br> it's always Touma's fault even if it isn't <br>That's right, you get it now. Good job.</br></br>  <br>But I miss the old threads, where we all discussed what was just translated and MOST people didn't post unspoilered spoilers.</br>  <br>;_;</br>    <br> But I miss the old threads <br>You're not alone in that</br></br>  <br>in there defense every single spoiler for the last volume was a lie.</br>  <br>Naturally<br>St. Germain and Aihana explained it perfectly, even Touma agrees</br></br>  <br> yfw all the people butthurt over not being saved by Touma were right </br>  <br>I still think NT8-10 needs to be changed to last just one day, since NT9 took no time, and there was no long breaks during the shitstorm that was Tokyo getting attacked up to Touma facing Othinus once more</br>  Can someone beat Touma? And i mean a plot powered Touma who went through billions of world, has the wisdom of his fairy Othinus , has chosen to accept his magic fan club gods powers and is fighting against someone who is not living correctly.  If Touma's only power is lecturing then running up and punching pussies in the face with his little botch fists, why don't the bad guys just hire a big guy to do something extremely painful to him?  <br> just hire a big guy to do something extremely painful to him? <br>We have already been down that road.</br></br>  <br>great so more people will come to Touma with a "why didnt you save me" bullshit and blame him<br><br><br>and sice childhood batshit people would come to him blaming him that they encountered misfortunes<br>Touma's life is shit nothing ever fucking changes its always suffering.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Has no one made a Touman edit of the Madara pasta?</br>  <br>thx. but damn that is some complex shit. i'll just wait for another animation then.</br>  <br>ST GERMAAAAAAAAAAAIN</br>  <br>Silvia</br>  So is the accepted order for the anime just release order? Or is there better?  <br>MURRICA FUCK YEAH</br>  <br> has chosen to accept his magic fan club gods powers </br>  Dammit Touma, this guy is perhaps the most reasonable enemy you've ever faced and you chose to flip out on him when you two were having sucha civilized talk.<br><br> "Hey man, we just want to chill around here but we're kinda super broken, and way too past humanity to really understand if we're fucking things up for the rest of you mortals. We'd like it if you could work with as as a moral compass of sorts and tell us if things are going alright so we can rest at ease, as a reward you'd get our help whenever you want and become a magic god for all intents and purposes, what do you say?" <br> "Sure thing mister mummy, but that's way too much power for me, I'm fine as long as you respect the free will of the people... And I wouldn't mind if you guys could pay me rent" <br><br>You had it in the bag Touma.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Othinus broke Toums, it cannot be helped</br>  ITT: Cool anime/manga weapons.  <br> weapon <br>That faggot has a glove that creates sparks, his flames are no more a weapon than dbz's ki blasts.</br></br>  <br><br>Alchemy is a science. No more or less than physics, ballistics, etc.</br></br>  <br> classy <br>why, because, he wears gloves and a shitty Reich rip-off uniform?</br></br>  <br>And ki is a part of the person being utilized in an energy blast.<br>Shut the fuck up faggot, it's not a weapon.</br></br>  <br><br>The gloves are a weapon. They're a tool used to create a destructive effect. It's the definition of a weapon.</br></br>  So after Usopp took over Sanji's spot in the monster trio formation he also took ace's spot in the brother trio. Is there anything that god can't do?  <br>For some reason, I find it so hard to hate Doflamingo. What's his popularity ranking going to be, I wonder.</br>  <br> tfw we wont be seeing doffy for a long long time <br><br>I hope he a cover page adventure</br></br></br>  <br><br> SH get to Raftel <br> fight vs BB, yada yada whatever bullshit <br> Usopp wins easily, how the fuck, Van Augurr rekt <br> rest of SH tired/near death <br> Usopp takes One Piece <br> Keikaku doori  <br> TN: Keikaku means plan. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, genius, that's irrelevant. Oda chooses what drawings to make, so even if someone else asked he still made a drawing of the other flamingos in love with the flamingo imitating Doflamingo, pretty much like many fans act.</br>  <br>Usopp may be related to Blackbeard (they physically look alike but BB mom was a D and Usopps was a long nose).<br><br>He will not betray Luffy fuck you. When Luffy was knocked unconscious by Lucci, Usopp challenged Lucci to a 1v1 distracting him from double tapping Luffy.</br></br></br>  How can a show targeted toward kids be so lewd?<br><br>Also, anyone else excited for the new movie?</br></br>  I see the /vp/ thread is being spammed by /b/. How often does this happen?<br><br/></br>  <br>It's been happening quite a bit since summer started. Even more so ever since episode 80 first aired.</br>  Daily reminder.  <br>About twice a day.<br>They come here too, but /a/ mods are competent, so they get their posts deleted so fast they stop bothering.</br></br>  <br>ehhh, some what lately it has been every thread. probably /v/ faggots who think the anime shouldn't have its own thread that got dragged to /vp/ because of the zygarde leaked shots.<br><br>most of the times the pokemon threads in /a/ are made to escape that crap or least this one was.</br></br></br>  So this shit is just boys getting abused by dominant women for cheap sexual thrills the entire time, right? <br><br>Or does it actually develop a plot and get better?</br></br>  Can't wait for doujins where they are mindbroken by the power of the dick.  <br> I'm guessing she came or something <br><br>Isnt that what the nosebleeds imply?</br></br></br>  <br><br>No kidding. Must be amazing. <br><br><br><br>Do they? <br>If so i'm all for it, gonna re-read all the parts to catch sight of it. Thought it was an embarrassment thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> without her panties and jersey <br> chiyo went into that room <br> yfw the author is hiding it till a later point that chiyo saw the same panties there when she thought kiyoshi was alone in that room <br> it all starts coming together </br></br></br></br>  <br>*the same panties she just saw in his room there</br>  Try to say something bad about this anime<br>Protip: You can't</br>  Boogie Woogie Feng Shui  Too much filler, although I enjoyed the filler episodes as well.</blockquote>]
