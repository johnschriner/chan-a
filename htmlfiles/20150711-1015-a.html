[   How long do we have to wait for the twist?  Subaru is best boy   still no fanart   <br><br>The art style feels Gainax-ish.</br></br>  <br>nice is this yuri?</br>  <br> two girls standing next to each other <br> is this yuri <br>There's a point when you go too far with delusions</br></br></br>  <br>well they're cute</br>  <br><br>It's the aldnoah zero sequel. Prepare to be disappointed.<br><br>The twist was that the director wanted everyone to think the show would just be normal romantic comedy haremshit and its apparently actually a corporate drama with action.</br></br></br></br>  Why the hell people keep relating this to Aldnoah Shit?<br><br>Is it even directed by Aoki?</br></br>  <br> hurr next A/Z <br>Fuck off already.</br></br>  Which classmate would you put in Crisis?  <br>No it's just an ebin meme people say to make people mad.</br>  <br>No it's directed by Nagasaki, the GBF director. Has nothing to do with A/Z, the script/series composition is by Maruto.<br><br>People relate it to A/Z because they love to shitpost and anything that doesn't please them is a "trainwreck".</br></br></br>  <br>Meme that started because it's on Mars and one of the main characters acts like Inaho and has Hime's VA.</br>  Livestream soon?  <br> The twist was that the director wanted everyone to think the show would just be normal romantic comedy haremshit and its apparently actually a corporate drama with action. <br>I was willing to wait for the twist but now I'll just give it the 3 episode rule and probably drop it.</br></br>  <br>10 mins<br><br>get in here niggas</br></br></br>  <br>livestream is in about 57 minutes</br>   I run this shit with my bitch   <br>10 mins? Where'd you get that info from?</br>  So when does their entire operation get promptly shutdown and liquidated for the betterment of everybody involved?<br><br>Special snowflake kids having their way is not my cup of tea.</br></br>  <br>26:10 #cc_anime<br>streamer's schedule</br></br>  <br>It's not really a twist, some of the plot descriptions pretty much laid it out from the outset. Realistically, the show is probably going to be a combination of both.</br>  Wasn't it supposed to be airing now?  Where is my crisis?  <br> to make people mad. <br>That meme made for some entertaining threads last time, so not really.</br></br>  <br>Your containment thread is here </br>  <br><br> everything is memes </br></br>  <br>Memes rule the world.</br>  <br><br><br>Are you guys talking about another stream? I thought it was neetball that was streaming classroom crisis. Neetball says stream is at 26:55</br></br></br>  <br>Memes aren't always trolls.</br>  <br><br>There's already a thread for it.</br></br>  <br>Please go be retarded elsewhere.</br>  <br><br><br>It's on MBS which is douyu <br>douyutv.com/meizhi</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sad, sad little man.</br>  <br>You failed to fill in the subject, so don't be butthurt no one's using your thread</br>  <br> no name of the anime in the subject <br>If you make a retarded thread don't expect people to use it.</br></br>  <br>thanks, nice OP</br>   that hand-drawn sci-fi action sequence in the first episode <br>Fucking sold. I can't remember the last time I saw an airing show bother to hand-draw vehicle motion.</br>   international spaceship races    all this exposition    documentary episode <br><br>holy shit this is snorefest territory</br></br>  <br> NOW THIS IS PODRACING </br>    The only good thing so far was Girl Inaho ignoring Annoying Student Boss dude.  <br> Exposition <br> Narration <br> Exposition <br> Still frames <br><br>Worst anime original in recent memory.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Megane man. Best voice.</br>  <br>Any good fanservice?</br>  Maybe the second half will be more exciting.   Why did you join A-TEC? <br> Iris: Because Mizuki joined. <br>Welp.</br></br>  <br>no fanservice at all so far.</br>  <br>Who's Mizuki?</br>  <br>redhead</br>  <br>girl with the orange hair. The teacher's imouto.</br>  <br><br>hahaha and retards said this wasn't yuri<br><br>once again btfo</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying there will be anything resembling romance on this anime </br>  <br>Also the reason she went on the risky spaceship mission was that if she didn't Mizuki's brother would have went and gotten himself killed and that would have made Mizuki sad.</br>  <br>there already is</br>  Two ribbons girl is cute, I hope she becomes more important.  <br>I want /u/ to remember cross ange and hibike and remember what happens when you jump to a yuri conclusion whenever 2 girls are affectionate with each other.</br>  <br><br>Cute.</br></br>  <br> Inaho likes Orange <br>Beautiful.</br></br>  Booring.<br><br>I can't believe Maruto wrote this shit.</br></br>   this ending <br> this yuribait </br>  <br> the promo art has them together <br> good bonding in the first episode <br> now full yuri <br><br>get rekt</br></br></br></br></br>   that ED <br>THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE YURI THEY SAID</br>  <br> &gt;this yuribait <br><br>Don't call it bait when it's just straight forward</br></br></br>   th-there's a male in the cast <br> m-maruto doesns't write yuri <br><br>Pfffttt everybody here just got BTFO and now this show got interesting, good shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just because marketing pushes out yuribait doesn't mean the show will be actual yuri.</br></br>  What I expected:<br> romcom <br> haremshit <br><br>What I got:<br> dudes only interact with each other <br> asshole dude finds a girl interesting, she ignores him <br> girl inaho does everything for the other girl <br> girls lying in bed together </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can taste your tears from here</br>  I didn't care about yuri but FemNaho and Orange Girl are the only good things about this. If it does end up yuri it might save the show.  <br>Mark my words L-elf and girl inaho will be fucking like rabbits by the end of this.</br>  <br>Screencapped, see you in ten weeks for your public humiliation.</br>  <br>How is he L-elf? He didn't murder anyone</br>  <br>L-Elf is too annoying. Maybe if she punches him first and then dumps him for Orange.</br>  <br>It's over dude, you lost, Maruto delivered</br>  <br>Sounds super gay. Nice.</br>  <br>What sort of things happen in public humiliation?</br>  <br>Anal.</br>  <br>Subaru, Iris and wannabe L-11.</br>  He doesn't even look like L-11, you retards.<br>It's clearly jaded Kyouske</br>  <br>Iris, she'd be quiet and submissive and let you do whatever you want.</br>  <br>So you didn't watch the show.</br>  <br>If anything she was the opposite of that this episode</br>  Is Sensei going to fuck L-elf then?  <br>And the first episode. Breaking safety rules on bike and going off on dangerous mission with the ship? The girl's a rebel.</br>  <br><br>I did, she only springs into action for her friends. If you're an asshole the most she'll do is ignore you. Avoid crossing any red lines and she'll remain her usual quiet self.</br></br>  <br>Yes and the nerd guys will have gay sex<br>Everyone on Mars is gay</br></br>  <br>They're rivals now and L-elf told teacher guy to try and bring him down. So probably.</br>  <br>Just like Aldnoah, amirite?</br>  <br>the Martians weren't gay, just fabulous.</br>  <br><br>laughing really hard at you two</br></br>  <br>The ED was like Hyouka/Oregairu ED, don't get your point.</br>  <br>Keep crying</br>  <br>I couldn't care less whether it's yuri or not, but the thing is that most anime have bait like that these days and they aren't yuri. Even Hibike, and that had two girls pretty much announcing they're gay for each other.</br>  Missed the stream. Was there any focus on this supposed pod racing or was it all homosexual undertones?  <br> or was it all homosexual undertones? <br><br>You want anything else?</br></br></br>  <br>I want pod racing, world building and friendship. Where's my friendship /a/?</br>  <br>Yuri is better than friendship</br>  <br>You will get strong f/f and m/m friendship. Please enjoy.</br>  <br>I want this show to go full drama later on. I want suffering, corporate conspiracies, and random deaths for no reason.</br>  <br>I want politics and crazy hijinks</br>  <br>But anon the more homo undertones there is the more there is friendship. If there's het romcom it won't leave space for anything else since that shit always takes all the focus.</br>  https://twitter.com/clcr_project/st<wbr>atus/619573038225297408<br><br>Well, looks like Angelina finally joins the fray next week</br></br></wbr>  <br><br>Ep 3 「The Woman from Accounting」</br></br>  <br>My money is on her shipping Sensei and Nagisa.</br>    <br><br>I dunno...<br><br>She looks too pissed to be a fujo</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuri wins.</br>  Remember when everyone thought Buddy Complex is going to be gay show but then it was super hetero with the King of Butthurt Cucks, this could be a reverse case.    <br><br> implying she's not telling femEggs to back off </br></br>  <br>Calm down, /u/shitter. It's just ED</br>  <br>And it's saving this garbage</br>  <br>Why is this garbage?</br>  <br>It's boring and dumb as fuck</br>  Great variety of faces, like GBF had. This episode was also storyboarded by Nagasaki.  <br>I think it's fine and I wonder on where plot will go.</br>    <br><br><br>It would be a shame if something were to happen to their friendship~~</br></br></br>  <br>What's on his face?</br>  <br>I thought the flying sequence looked like a weird mix of 3D and 2D, the crashing part was definitely hand drawn.</br>  Which subs are best for this show? HS is obviously shit, but DDY typeset some signs FFF didn't.  <br>FFF.</br>  <br>Ok, Picked up.</br>  <br>IT'S NOT YURI THEY SAID</br>  <br>my sides are in mars</br>  where the subas at?  <br>delayed probably</br>  <br>Don't know, I feel like all the subs this season are awfully late. And this isn't even Funi.</br>  <br>CR broke the simulcast. It's only showing blank screen at the moment.</br>  <br><br><br> [HorribleSubs] Classroom Crisis - 02 [1080p].mkv </br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme.</br>  <br>720p is up too</br>  <br>Is this one of those shows that are actually 1080p?</br>  <br>Only if sensei dies first. I like him, but his design screams kittan and we all know how that ended.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>No he looks like Masayoshi</br>  <br>There will be gay, but not yuri.</br>  <br>Who will go crazy and turn on the other?</br>  <br>They're brothers btw.</br>  This is a good OP.<br><br><br>Yeah, I thought of that too.</br></br></br>  <br>Flamenco was skinnier though. Sensei has a squarer jaw.</br>  <br>Has that stopped fujoshi before?</br>  Next episode looks like fun<br><br>Maruto has never gone wrong with a black stockings character!!</br></br>  <br> but not yuri. <br><br>Nice delusion</br></br></br>  <br>Better.</br>  <br>Can't picture Maruto write yuri though...</br>  <br>there's always a first time</br>  <br> girl excited <br> guy distressed <br>Definitely a fujo</br></br></br>  The art kinda makes me feel it will go the incest route.  Jesus Christ.<br>I guess that guy that kept saying that Classroom Crisis didn't have infodumps can't anymore.</br>   15 year olds making spaceships <br> another 15 year old is the CEO <br><br>Yeah i cant watch this guys.<br>Couldnt force myself for more than 4 minutes the second episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one wants ugly adults, just stop watching anime if teens bother you</br>  <br>This. It was worse than an Urobuchi show.</br>  Classroom Crisis will be AOTS.<br>If it's not already.</br>  <br>It is see <br/></br>  So they are like art students, studying something absolutely pointless and in the end they need to choose a normal path?  <br>Are you retarded? He created one character and they rule63 it (with his blessing)</br>  I had faith in you Maruto. You betrayed me.  I don't get it, what happened.  <br> they see your   face </br>  It's dead.  I honestly have no idea what this show is trying to be yet.  <br>pfffft</br>  <br>show is pretty boring, kinda sad because anime originals are the only shows that have the potential to be truly hype.</br>  <br> Cross Ange <br>Three lesbian<br> Hibike <br>2 lesbian<br>so we get</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What happened to Maruto? He used to churn out masterpieces.</br></br>  What is even going on in this shit anime?  <br>A classroom of so called geniuses are building a vehicle for podraces and the transfer student boss wants them to stop wasting resources and get real jobs.</br>  <br>Normally, subtext don't count as romance in japan terms<br>that why symphogear is not tag as romance</br></br>  <br>1 lesbian who will stay forever alone.</br>  <br>Thanks, still sounds ridiculous</br>  <br><br>Thanks, I fell asleep during the exposition and missed what they were building.</br></br>  <br>I don't get how, basically they're some kind of special class who want to do all kind of random shit and the hippie teacher believes in their potential and others don't. <br><br><br>Then drop it and stop posting on the threads if you can't even watch the episode properly, no point in watching show you don't find interesting.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a lot more enjoyable than I thought it would be so far. Infodump was a little ridiculous, but hopefully there won't be many more, now that it's over.<br>Will this be the  Houkago no Pleiades  of the season?</br></br>  <br> Will this be the   Houkago no Pleiades  of the season?<br>A mediocre piece of work hyped up by retards who are too deluded with their own standards to see the work as it is?</br></br>  So, how many episodes until autistic girl falls for Nagisa?  <br><br>They'll probably infodump Kiryuu's relationship with his family. Why did they even bother with all this shitty exposition, there was definitely a better way to do it.</br></br>  <br>Soon.</br>  You can also see the theme in the OP, Nagisa is putting crosses over their career options.<br><br><br> there was definitely a better way to do it <br>Any ideas? I think it was alright, they were watching a video about the classroom's work because they need to prove the class has an actual point to exist, so at the same time the audience gets info. I get that infodump can be boring but this was much better option than "let's talk about this topic we both know already"(see Rokka).</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying it won't be the other way around <br>Mark my words, she's gonna become a harem protagonist.</br></br>  <br><br>We already know they're a school for gifted children. Slip that shit about the founders in one of the teacher's motivational speeches. Show that they're building podracers as a project instead of talking about it in some documentary.</br></br>  There is muh mecha batoru?  I'm hooked. A shame the documentary took so much time. Can't wait for next episode.  <br><br>No, podracing.</br></br>  <br>He went a bit too far from his comfort zone. He should learn from Maeda and stick with the formula that worked best for him.</br>  <br><br>He should at least listen to his own advice.</br></br>  <br>Here, it was sneakily introduced with a documentary.</br>  <br><br>And it was super boring.</br></br>   Caristo   Where would you hire them?  goddamn girl  <br>Horriblesubs lives up to its name.</br>  <br>Fuck off they are taken by each other</br>    <br>PR Manager the cutest</br>  I like it even more.  <br>You mean this TENSAI</br>  So what is this show about? Space podracing?  <br>yuri podracing!</br>  <br> Space podracing? <br><br> More like space Mad Men</br></br></br>  <br>Space BL</br>  Are shitposters bored now after Hibike has concluded, or why are people trying to force their retarded "yurifags vs straightfags" war into these threads? Fucking hell.   They give us exposition so we get an actually coherent, developed setting which can make sprout an interesting story.  <br> "boring", "it is yuri?", "who love who?"  <br><br>Fuck you, it was a well done expostion, which happen every 10 years and you're shitting on it because you didn't get your fucking shipping.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I also don't get why it's target of shitposting. It hasn't got much hyped beforehand and it's not like the director is someone well-known. Well maybe it will stop at some point.</br></br>  <br>So, lets talk about March<br>Why NASA is so shit that they never will go there?</br></br>    <br>March is still so far away anon.</br>  <br>They could at least have translated Europa as Europe and misspell Ganymede as well.</br>   Sera got inspired by his own speech <br>my sides</br>  The show doesn't really stand out but I kinda want to watch it to see what happens with Kiryu and his plan to the top.  <br>Getting inspired and all teary eyed over watching your own TV performance strikes me as weirdly narcissistic.</br>  <br>The best thing about it was that no one else cared</br>  <br>I think that may be why people were so disgusted in the teacher's lounge</br>  <br><br>Not really. The news of the shut down had him forget why he was doing what he did in the first place. Hearing his own words tossed back at him just reminded him of what he was working for in the first place</br></br>  <br>In six months he will be tamed by sensei's liberalism</br>  <br><br>I loved how they changed faces after they saw who it was that got up.</br></br>  <br><br><br>They're just reserved Japanese wage slaves so a sudden outpouring of actual emotion and give a shitness is alien to them</br></br></br>  Could they not find anyone more boring to do that voice over?   this entire episode   <br>It was Japanese?</br>  <br> In six months he will be tamed by sensei's dick <br>FTFY</br></br>  Why is this so fucking boring? I thought it was going to be decent, but they just keep talking and talking and talking.  <br>Maruto is just preparing you for the twist.</br>  <br><br>go watch a Michael Baye movie</br></br>  <br>Wait for the TWEEST.</br>  <br>He'd probably do that if it was necessary to save MUH FREEDOM</br>  <br>No.</br>  Show's boring, let's have a fun thread instead.  <br>Me second from the right.</br>  <br>this pleases my autism<br>I grew up watching the discovery channel and Nova and all the other stuff on PBS that have incredibly slow talking and monotone narrators</br></br>  <br>autism<br>Have you really never had a galvanizing moment like that from seeing shit from your past? I'll bet you were one of the people who didn't get "umaku naritai" either.</br></br>  <br> it was a well done expostion <br>You CCfags are deluded as fuck</br></br>  <br>yeah, lets talk about DAT ASS</br>  <br>she's taken by the redhead, go away</br>  <br>Nah you can go shitpost somewhere else</br>  <br>How it's Made best narrator.</br>  <br>Maruto is setting them up to have a hellishly painful fallout, isn't he?</br>  <br><br>Since when is Maruto known for twists?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  I want to fuck the smug out of Nagisa.   sexy office lady next episode    that Kokoro voice   <br>Only because the bodysuit</br>  <br> Yuu Kobayashi <br>It's gonna be good.</br></br>  <br>see <br>Or better yet, fuck off back to /u/ altogether</br></br>  <br> Those hips <br>Hnng.</br></br>  <br> i don't even watch the show </br>  <br> a couple of fanservice stills from the ending credits is the content of the show <br>Sasuga yurishitter grasping at straws</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/wftspncnuy.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br>They expected another anime original happening-every-week trainwreck mecha</br>  <br> More like space Mad Men <br><br>Yeah that will work</br></br></br>  <br>There isn't even a robot unless you count the podracer</br>    Why's everyone hyping Maruto?<br>He just made two decent highschool series, that's not very impressive</br>  <br> decent <br><br>They're masterpieces, anon.</br></br></br>  <br><br> He just made two decent highschool series, that's not very impressive <br>He wrote Parfait, Damekoi and White Album 2, these 3 are among the best eroge ever</br></br></br>   http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/65<wbr>877</wbr> <br> watch until the fourth episode guys! </br>  <br>He's done way more than WA2 and Saekano.

A lot of the production staff worked on the Wild Arms series.<br/> </br></br></br>  <br>I'm happy the buzz saws are back.

And those stones would be like a unit of energy/memory.<br><br>If that's how it's going to be those petals at the ending probably represent memories too.</br></br></br>  <br>Man, I don't like the transparent bits on Chris new costume. It looks so bad.</br>  <br>They've probably been training on the side.<br>Let's not forget Maria wasn't a total loser, she could fight well enough back when she had Gungnir.<br><br> all dese "Tsubasa" this episode </br></br></br></br>    New Tsubasa butt.    <br>10/10</br>  <br>now remove them to show the end card of the final episode</br>  <br>I want to bury my face in her crotch.</br>  <br> transparent  <br> looks </br></br>  <br>That would be a crime.</br>  <br> subtle hint that all that's left of miku is her head after episode 7 </br>   Bushi Noise   I want to cure both Carol's and Hibiki's daddy issues with my dick.    <br> shadowy powerful leader <br> generals <br> generals with mook spawners <br> mook types and new specials <br> more hero form changes  <br><br>FUCK! DAMMIT! This anime gets my Tokusatsu blood boiling so deliciously! Why must Symphogear be so good?! HOW CAN IT BE SO GOOD AFTER 2 SEASONS?!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Homunculus when</br>  <br>NANA WILLS IT</br>  <br>Where are the transparent bits? I thought they all became opaque after materializing completely.</br>  <br>Nana must have been so happy when she read in the script that bushi noise would be appearing</br>      Next episode will be delayed for 20 minutes.  <br>RIP shield but a chain/snake sword isn't a bad choice. My favorite are strings being used as weapons or weapons that have a wide variety of uses (like cloth in Tsugumomo) but I don't think that would fit anyone in the cast.</br>  <br>All these nipples.</br>   red stuff comes out of the noise when they're killed <br> when Chris protected Elf9, it also dissolved the ground <br>That's not anti linker</br></br>  <br>that move was awesome.</br>    <br>Why would you do that?</br>  <br><br> like cloth in Tsugumomo <br><br>It's great, isn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can see a little bit of her arm and shoulder behind Kirika.</br>  <br> He doesn't want Miku's decapitated head as a hat </br>  <br>Tsubasa getting man handled by an older woman is making her flustered.</br>  <br>Yeah, versatile weapons like that are great. I'm curious just how far they can take a snake sword though. If Maria goes all spinny tornado again, that'd be swell.</br>  <br>Hibiki, having learned how to make alchemy clones from befriending Carol, created an army of Mikus so that she would be warm everywhere.</br>  <br> Little bit of rib </br>  <br>Confident older women are clearly her type. Although Maria has self-esteem issues beneath her solid exterior which might be a stumbling block in their relationship.</br>  <br><br> the original is forgotten </br></br>   Fwee~!   Do we really gotta go through the same motion again?<br>Why is Hibiki so easily confused by words?</br>  <br>Thinking about it, with enough imagination, Maria can recreate the things she did with her cape. Might be cool.</br>  <br>Hibiki just wants to fight, she only wants to use her Symphogear to protect.<br> Fucking Shirou </br></br>  <br>Maria still has a long way to go, just look at this face.</br>  With those anti-Linker Noise maybe you forgot it, but USA is still a bad guy.  <br> anti-Linker <br>Probably not.<br><br> USA is still a bad guy <br> Noise did 9/11 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That subtle expansion as Maria's Marias are freed. </br>   no ZENBU in Chris' song. <br>This is the worst thing since Maria.</br>  <br> Noise did 9/11 <br>The noise did Elfnein in reverse? I guess that explains why she's wearing almost nothing.</br></br>  <br>She also got flustered when Tsubasa brought up her line from G. Her hair looking like cat ears completes it.</br>  <br>It's already late by ~10000 minutes.<br>20 minutes matters not at that point.</br></br>  <br>She actually seemed very disturbed at the mention of her father. More so than usual. I'll wait until we know more of her daddy issues to pass judgement.</br>  <br>   Noise did 9/11 <br>They deserve it.</br></br>  <br>America is basically the Team Rocket of the Symphogear verse, though. They're a hilariously incompetent threat.<br><br><br>You sure about that? Her song really got fucked over by the audio mixing. I almost don't feel like I've even heard it yet.</br></br></br></br>  What emotion is Miku trying to convey here?  MY HARD DRIVE CRASHED<br>I LOST ALL MY SYMPHOGEAR MUSIC<br>SOMEBODY PLEASE HELP</br></br>  <br>Kanade had a ton of problems as well, but she still kept trying her best despite it all. Rather than just "confident older women" I think that's what she likes about her.<br><br><br>She's a simple girl. Its both a good thing about her, and a bad thing about her depending on how you look at it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hibiki I swear to god if you rape more girls </br>  <br> more girls trying to steal Hibiki from me </br>  <br>Can't you just use the usual place for torrenting large collections?</br>  <br>I can't get over that Bushido noise is a thing now</br>  <br> Me feet heart <br> My bag is heavy <br> I wish I was home <br> being sunshine </br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>My god her physique looks weird.<br>Given her ass and thighs  there shouldn't be any rips visible on her, she's not that thin.</br></br></br></br>    <br> hibiki's gonna punch your shit <br>and make a banana split.</br></br>  <br>But my library was so neat and organized. I miss it.</br>  <br>I don't think those are ribs</br>  <br>Why is she so cool?</br>  <br><br>Then recreate it</br></br>  <br>"I'm getting too old for this shit."</br>  <br>That's a good handjob face.</br>  <br> fucking banana Noise <br>I'm so glad the Noise are back.<br>I was afraid Symphogear lost some of its goofiness with them being gone.</br></br></br>  <br>I think I'll just give up on living instead.</br>  With sound<br/>  <br><br>What else would they be? Scars? Exactly looking like rips?</br></br>  <br> Noise <br> goofy <br>They're mindless killing machines that have killed thousands of people all over the world. They are to be feared and destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br>She's slowly going Raita-mode.</br>  <br>I don't shitpost with that "why is she so perfect" stuff, but if I did, it would be with Hibiki.</br>  <br>They have goofy mannerisms though. Remember grape-kun from S1?<br><br>You could argue that their goofiness contrasts with their threat and makes them even more disturbing.</br></br></br>  <br>Would this nice fellow ever hurt anybody?</br>  "Let's ship Tsubasa and Maria really hard since she makes a good Kanade replacement"<br>"But after shipbaiting her with Chris in G we need something"<br>"Let's give her a naked loli and be done with it"<br>"Oh and the loli should die just to break her heart again so she can't become a senpai herself"<br><br>Considering this is Geah we're talking about this seems plausible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Oh buoy!

Which one should I start with?<br><br>I tried original Precure but didn't get far.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Akazukin Chacha is the best magical girl experience available. <br><br>I always read that there was an English dubbed version, I think in China or Thailand or something. I've always been curious as to what it sounds like, but I can't find anything on it.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to watch this now. I need something to watch alongside Flanders no Inu, Astroboy 1963 and seasonal shows for a change of pace.</br>  Might as well put them both on there, I don't really see why not since Nanoha is already on there.  Get that boy shit out of the chart.<br><br>Also Shugo Chara should be removed because it's just not good. Maybe replace it with Fun Fun Pharmacy? Or Panty &amp; Stocking if that counts.<br><br><br>Ojamajo Doremi</br></br></br></br></br>  Throw in Witchcraft Works  <br> Shugo Chara should be removed <br>Fuck you.</br></br>  <br>Nanoha wasn't there, I mean in the original one, but expect the third season, cute little girls doing magical things, so I thought why not<br><br><br>The first season of Shugo Chara was pretty good, but I haven't seen Fun Fun Pharmacy yet, looks like I need to check that out.<br><br>Panty and Stocking didn't count...I mean they aren't really transforming....there was alternative list, where someone put Panty and Stocking in as "parody".<br><br><br>Haven't seen that one, but I'm pretty sure that's not what we're looking for. It's not really mahou shoujo, just wizards and magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not really mahou shoujo <br>You could say the same thing about High Earth Defense Club, Utena and Umi Monogatari though</br></br>  <br><br>Do you only want good/noteworthy ones or just a list of as many that fit the genre? I can think of Fushigiboshi no Futagohime and Saint October, but both are kinda shitty.</br></br>  <br> It's not really mahou shoujo, just wizards and magic. <br>Technically neither is the Mai dualogy and you have those up there. Plus MAL and AniDB classifies it as an MS show</br></br>  What about the classic Moetan  Oh, and Hime-Chan's Ribbon and Otogi Jushi Akazukin, for two more "nobody's heard of or cares about these" series.  <br>Not OP but I think the chart should only have good/noteworthy MS. So then there's deciding what should stay and what should go...</br>  <br> Remove cool and spicy <br> not fujoshit or gen'ei &gt;500 copies <br>Get the fuck out of here.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Also not OP, but a chart that attempted to be comprehensive would actually be useful, which rec charts rarely are because in the end they're just some anonymous faggot's opinion.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Fair enough. Had to ask since there's one or two on the list I wouldn't count as either.</br></br>  Here's the original one, I just tried to put some new into the list, which I saw and was good or at least okay tier.<br><br>I saw most of the shows in the list, but not all of them.<br><br><br>And that's a mistake, this should be in the list, dunno why the original creator didn't put it there.<br><br><br>Looking for the good or at least okay ones preferably</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nanoha wasn't there <br>Which version were you using as a base? The chart on the wiki has Nanoha on it.<br><br> It's not really mahou shoujo, just wizards and magic. <br>What do you think Tweeny Witches is? Speaking of, might as well add LWA.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you want comprehensive<br><br>http://magical-girl-mahou-shoujo.wi<wbr>kia.com/wiki/Magical_Girl_%28Mahou_<wbr>Shoujo_-_%E9%AD%94%E6%B3%95%E5%B0%9<wbr>1%E5%A5%B3%29_Wiki<br><br>This is about as comprehensive as you can get, up to and including live-action garbage like I Dream of Jeanne and Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Could use it as a point of reference for making an anime-only chart, if you felt up to it.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just found the one you're talking about. Looks like I used an older version, I'll update it soon.</br>  <br> What do you think Tweeny Witches is? <br>Shit. But still a lot closer to typical MS than Witchcraft Works.</br></br>  <br>The one you posted here  has Nanoha on it too.</br>  <br>Fair enough, thanks for the link. Looks like they even have some hentai stuff like Mahou no Rouge Lipstick.</br>  <br> Shit <br>Fuck you too, buddy. But I wasn't really advocating for WCW to be added, I was just pointing out his description fit a show that was already on the chart. Still, LWA should be added.</br></br>  <br>WCW is more typical (and better) than Rayearth</br>  <br>Totally agree with LWA, I don't how could I forgot that.<br><br><br>Haven't seen Hime-Chan's Ribbon, but it looks good too me. I'll check that out!<br><br><br>Yep looks like I fucked up something....</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If you've seen Nurse Angel Ririka, Hime-Chan's Ribbon is kinda similar. No major antagonists or monster of the week though; it's more slice of life-ish .</br></br>    no Tonde Buurin   How's Princess Precure?  <br>PreCure already on the list, I don't think we need to list every season and spin-off.</br>  <br>Give the latter seasons of Precure a try, Sailor Moon or Card Captor if you really haven't seen those before, Shugo Chara is fun, Ojamajo or Utena if you want something less sugar sweet.</br>  <br>Good</br>  <br>Hot</br>  Does Shamanic Princess count?  <br>Yes.</br>  Today I will remind them that these are the only two pairs of Magical Girls to have a kiss scene in their respective series.  <br>Chikyuu Shoujo Arjuna, Pastel Yumi, Fushigi Mahou Fun Fun Pharmacy, LWA, Anyamal Tantei Kiruminzoo and Corrector Yui should be added to the chart.</br>  <br> only <br>The bottom one isn't even a real kiss.</br></br>   Minky Momo will never be subbed   <br>the most important thing is a little girl demo/not little girl demo division and the removal of utena</br>  <br>Sayaka and Kyouko never kissed.</br>    <br>Thanks for proving my point.</br>  <br>You're welcome.<br>But I assure you, delusional will get you no where.</br></br>  <br>That's nice. I hope you realize that someday.</br>  <br>Yeah, you're probably right. Natsuki and Shizuku only put their faces really close together, the lips never touched.</br>  <br>Why is Madoka in parodies?</br>  <br>Because it's shit!</br>  <br>I've had people fall onto me face first<br>We didn't kiss</br></br>  <br>What happened to the section of parodies? Because Binan was literally a parody, also Symphogear, I don't think it counts as a Mahou Shoujo show, same as Nanoha.<br><br><br> However I don't think I have seen a single one aimed at actual little girls. <br>You're missing out all the good ones, one good starting point it's Doremi.<br><br><br>The first season was fun though, but I agree with Fun Fun Pharmacy.<br><br><br> Corrector Yui <br>I don't remember that getting english sub/dub.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why would you even reccommend Gen'ei?  <br>Even though Madoka takes things from the MG genre, it's fundamentally very different from almost every other MG show just by portraying little girls as the cause of everything wrong in the world.</br>  <br>Corrector Yui is too great. Not much of it is translated though, unfortunately.</br>  <br>It's awesome indeed, I'm glad I had the chance to watch it dubbed to my language when I was a child.</br>  <br>If it wasn't a kiss, then why was the scene cut off directly before their faces would have touched?</br>  <br>Corrector Yui got a few episodes translated iirc but since Minky Momo is on the chart and it has no subs, I thought it was worth mentioning.</br>  <br>Bait</br>  <br>fuck off deluded yuricunt</br>  If Symphogear and Nanoha are added then Cyber team in Akihabara should also be added.  New material for the movie: Hinata and Himawari's sketches.  <br>Why the fuck does Hinata look younger</br>  <br>Aging is for commoners and lesser bloodlines.<br><br>Here's Salad's design with an ass shot just for you, /a/.</br></br></br>  Sunflower's got a decent range of emotions. Bottom right probably occurs after the cake smash.  Lee's facial aesthetics have improved.  <br>Hinata got some Uzumaki in her so she gets a piece of that expanded life span.</br>  I kinda liked Tenten's old hair better.  fuck off  Mitsuki's evil, right?  Dadruto in full Hokage gear.  Shikamaru's got his wedding ring on a necklace.  <br>Shut up.</br>  Shikadai's the tallest of the kids and also clearly doesn't want to deal with any of this bullshit.  <br>To be fair The Last Hiashi looked younger than he did in the Exam period.</br>  <br>Milfnata got taller.</br>  <br><br><br>They look a good ten years younger than in chapter 700.<br>Naruto's Gaiden design looks much physically larger, more like a proper authority figure and appropriately so. <br>The fuck is SP doing.</br></br></br></br></br>  Nyaa isn't really giving great results, is the last BD out yet?  Post Sakura OP.  <br> skirt <br> stockings <br>  adorable <br><br>new best girl coming through</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>From the trailer and  she seems to look basically the same as in The Last.</br>  <br> Had a one-way crush on Naruto when she was young, but now that has transformed into deep, romantic love.  <br> After she built a family, that love reaches out to other family members as well. <br> She fully trusts her husband who‘s often upset and cannot come home <br> But, she feels sad and worried about the rigid relationship between Boruto and Naruto, Boruto who's so stubborn and Naruto who often cannot come home. U cannot see that shy expression on her face anymore. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Boruto<br> Confident and arrogant, he easily clashes with the people around him <br> But towards his sister Himawari he is quite the gentle brother. </br></br></br></br>  <br> New character for the New era. <br> Unlike Boruto and Sarada, he doesn't show his emotions much. <br> He is always using the perspective of an adult to judge Boruto and Sarada's actions. <br> Just like Bolt and Sarada, he has great parents. <br> But who are his parents, even Boruto and Sarada doesn't know. <br>Has stretchable arms.<br> When he smiles his eyes will turn to the shape of the crescent moon. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks pretty good.</br>  <br> Ninja world's hero. <br> Used to be a mischievious kid, now he has become the hokage who protects the village. <br> Felt like there is a heavy gap between his generation and the new era. <br> Keeps thinking on how to pass down 'what is the most important thing to everyone' to the next generation. <br> While this is a good intention, he couldn't even get along with his son Boruto. <br> Is constantly feeling troubled by this. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just wanted to see if the bottom part of her outfit was different.<br><br>Don't know why Kishi took away her spats.</br></br></br>  <br> She helps her mom around the house despite her young age and is the opposite of a troublemaker. It mentions that Boruto is very protective of her, and she of him. It also mentions she tries not to trouble her regularly absent father and does her best to be patient. </br>  <br>Why the fuck is he wearing a onesie?</br>  Sakura<br><br> In the manga she became a good and frank mother - and even though her husband almost never comes back to the family, she's building up an open and sincere relationship with her daughter Sarada <br><br> Sakura's full body. A bold/aggressive fashion, showing her belly-button. If you look at the Uchiha crest on her back, you are filled with a deep emotion. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Otsutsuki blood, I ain't gotta explain shit.</br>   Naruto's biggest rival but also best friend. A boy who only saw revenge in the past, but has now become an adult that jokes with his friend. Sasuke seldomly returns to the village, but he does this to protect Konoha from possible/impending dangers. In the movie, he became Boruto's master. Sasuke believes that no matter what era it is/how time passes, the nature of ninja will not change. He is on par with Naruto. Using his left rinnegan and right m.sharingan, he fights with the two strongest genjutsu.   <br> Then he kills the cake. </br>  <br><br>Good, Bolt really needed a soft spot.<br><br>I thought the source of the whole butthurt on Bolt's part that they were really tight before Naruto became Hokage and suddenly couldn't spend as much time with his family as before? Certainly the end of The Last seemed to show that.<br>If the generational split is more general than just with his son, something not shown in the Gaiden, it would take quite a bit away from the whole dynamic of the movie.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they were really tight before Naruto became Hokage and suddenly couldn't spend as much time with his family as before <br><br>That got retconned in the gaiden. Now Naruto has been hokage since Sarada was at least 3.</br></br></br>  <br>the issue is probably that the nations are united and that the older generation grew up with war and some shady ninja shenanigans, while the new generation lives a peaceful life</br>  <br> That got retconned in the gaiden. Now Naruto has been hokage since Sarada was at least 3. <br>Where is that stated?</br></br>  <br>if you are talking about the flashback where sasuke says he's going after kaguya, that happened a couple of months after gaiden<br><br>naruto has only been hokage for a couple of years</br></br></br>  <br> even though her husband almost never comes back to the family <br>Sauce the same as always<br><br> If you look at the Uchiha crest on her back, you are filled with a deep emotion <br>who wrote these, Kishi? sure, deep emotion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He has only recently been inaugurated in chapter 700, which seems a year or two before Gainden at most.</br></br>  <br> She helps her mom around the house despite her young age and is the opposite of a troublemaker. It mentions that Boruto is very protective of her, and she of him. It also mentions she tries not to trouble her regularly absent father and does her best to be patient. <br><br>She's seriously primed to take over as Best Girl for this generation.</br></br></br>  <br>Then how come Sasuke has time to go to the village to visit his fuckbuddy and his wife but not his 8 year old daughter?</br>  <br>You know why.</br>  <br/>  <br>He is a bad person. The manga should have clued you in on that.<br>It is far more simple to accept the fact that he doesn't really care to spend time with his family and be back on his edgy road trip asap like he did at the end of Gaiden, than to assume a whole character dynamic at the heart of the movie was retconned.</br></br>  <br> He is a bad person. The manga should have clued you in on that. <br>I know that, but it's hard to accept it when the MC keeps telling me he's the most awesome person that has ever existed.</br></br>  <br>you'd do the same if you were married to sakura</br>  <br>Naruto's gauge for that isn't exactly calibrated well.</br>  <br>Ninja anon.Not person.</br>  <br>He is the first person the MC's age he ever made a real bond with, after spending the first 12 years of his life feared and shunned by all adults around him and none of the other kids knowing why the adults fear him and keeping their distance too.<br>He's hardly objective on the topic. Shame he was not teamed up with better people than with whom he was (anyone, anyone else from that generation), but that is how things ended up.</br></br>  So will the movie confirmed whether Lee and 10/10 got together? Seems weird to show them both in the sketches without their being a something between them.  <br> He is on par with Naruto <br><br>So one armed Sasuke = endgame Naruto with two arms?</br></br></br>  <br>R.I.P. milfnatatatas</br>  <br>why is he so smug</br>  <br>They're ninja now.</br>  <br>He probably pulls a Susanoo arm like in UNS. Also he good powers comes from eyes anyways</br>  <br>His parents are Shikamaru and Temari. You'd be smug too.</br>  <br>She is really good at hiding her assets.</br>  <br>Naruto is probably stronger than Sasuke's right now, but Sasu could be closely that gap quickly with him actually practicing shit whereas Naruto is just doing paper work.</br>  <br>laighed way too hard at this post.</br>  I want Taka to have a cameo just to see Karin animated in her new outfit, she's really /fa/.  <br>Well, at least it isn't the generic housewife outfit.</br>  <br>he doesn't even need them that much anyway. One arm is more than enough.</br>  <br>hinata is the epitome of comfyness</br>  <br>She's also the softest<br><br>All the other girls are /fit/...Ino, 1010, Temari, hell even Sakura, but Hinata is nice and soft.</br></br></br>  Naruto: 180 cm (5”10)<br>Hinata: 163 cm (5"4)<br>Himawari: 138 cm (4"6)<br>Boruto: 145 cm(4"9)<br>Sasuke: 182 cm (5”11)<br>Sarada: 147 cm (4”9)<br>Mitsuki: 149 cm (4”10)<br>Shikamaru: 176-177 cm (5”9)<br>Shikadai: 154-155 cm (5")<br>Sai: 176 cm (5”9) <br>Inojin: 147 cm (4”9)<br>TenTen: 166 cm (5”5)<br>Rock Lee: 179 cm (5”10)<br>Momoshiki: 176 cm (5"9)<br>Kinshiki:231 cm (7"6)<br><br>Apparently, nobody grew since The Last<br><br>Also, Bort is a manlet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino seems fairly soft in some scenes. Not as soft as Hinata or Tsunade (her young form anyway) by any means, but there's some softness in there, dressed up in a 'fuck me' outfit.<br>Mei (or whatever the redhead Mizukage with the two blood limits was called) kinda qualifies too.</br></br>  <br>they didn't get together, Tenten is not part of metal lee's family tree</br>  <br>Same as his father, eating junk food all the time, without even the excuse of being a malnourished orphan.<br>Do we know if Minato was a manlet at that age?</br></br>  <br>Ino is so best girl is fucking hurts. She is everything perfecf rolled into a sexy package.</br>  <br>She looks better with the generic Konoha vest than with that prostitute outfit.</br>  <br>Tsunade and Mei don't really count. Christmas Cakes are soft by definition.</br>  <br>Yeah....Ino's biggest problem is her shippiden and the last outfits sucked ass. She was lovely in her vest outfit, or the orange shirt. Her RTN outfit was cute.</br>  <br>Second best, tied with 10/10. <br>Both are good waifu material, though (for this series' standards) unlike Hinata who has a case of single target sexuality and I would not have it any other way.<br><br>Well, there's that blonde chick that either Bee or Darui allegedly fucked. She seemed pretty damn soft too.<br>As did Kaguya, come to think about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Anybody else really fucking excited for the special episodes that will come out before the movie? Because I am.  <br>Kaguya had the secret Hyuga shrinking technique.We can't know how big they are.Unless you go by that Kaguyafag's art.</br>  <br>I wonder what that's going to be about.<br><br>I'm mildly curious about the Hokage oneshot</br></br></br>  <br>dad is Netori-san confirmed</br>  <br><br>I'm personally wondering how Bolt is supposed to amount to anything. Like, the problem with any story is that it comes with the caveat "Naruto and Sasuke are on hand to solve the problem. One is Jesus, and the other is also Jesus. Together, they are DOUBLE JESUS."<br><br>How the fuck could you compete with that? Every story about Bolt would either be a not-so-significant threat ("Dad has to have the planet-shattering punch up with the god-beast now. Bolt, uh, take the guy with the sword. You kids play nice now!") or find a way to nerf Naruto and Sasuke so they can't actually get involved.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Move over salad we got a new best girl here</br></br>  is the Last movie out with decent sound and not cancer subs?  <br>Then why the yellow eyes and the stretching powers?</br>  <br>The last one was pretty damn good, it does raise my expectation levels.<br> adorable sisters <br> good animation and fight scenes <br> the whole Hyuuga clan being based as fuck, retelling the events of pein's attack to the clan head in a completely objective and unbiased manner <br> Ino being fucking cute as she explains Naruto's Rasenshuriken to Hinata and Neji <br> Hinata shown as growing, earning her clansmen's respect and taking charge of who she is, her little sister finding confidence in her once again <br>Bolt's one could have some good stuff too. By the title I am presuming it is Naruto teaching him the Rasengan, either before he became the Hokage or shortly after, though it could be a lot of things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we don't know the mother</br>  <br>He fucked Orochimaru in a female host.</br>  <br>That ass.</br>  <br>salad is used goods now</br>    <br><br>So why exactly don't we have a manga/anime about her?</br></br>  <br>sp may do something, kishi is a lost cause</br>  <br>Kishi don't give a shit about anyone who isn't Naruto or an Uchiha.</br>  <br>Kishi isn't giving spin-off licenses  for now. </br>  <br><br><br>Himawari gets all this fanart yet we haven't seen a single thing out of her, for all we know she could turn out to be shit like most of Kishi's female characters tend to go.<br><br>People just go with "Naruto's cute daughteru" and slap on whatever personality they see fit.</br></br></br></br></br>    How would you feel is Himawari was actually a terrifying Yandere who inherited the anger and malovolence of Kurama? Like she can actually demon Fox mode without actually having demon Fox powers...and shes deadily protective of her family.<br><br>Would she still be the cute little daughterfu everyone envisions of her?</br></br>  <br>Best case scenario is them doing a Naruto GT, with Bolt and his team going on low key missions, C tops depending on whether they make chuunin in the film. Throw in some SoL when they're back in the village, banter between Bolt and Dadruto, Naruto and Hinata being cute as fuck in the background of scenes from the POV of the kids.<br>Worst case scenario is them doing a Naruto GT but botching it with shitty villains/plots, eye magic and angst.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, before everyone thought she was going to be an overcheerful genki girl until it got revealed that she's a Hinata clone.</br>  <br>Her voice actor is the "calm voice" archetype, so she's probably more like Hinata than Boruto is.</br>  <br>I want nothing more than a SoL anime (20-30 episodes) of Next Gen Naruto, but its just about silly shenanigans surrounding Sarada, Boruto, Himawari, InoShikaCho, and Metal Lee with their parents making very small appearances.<br><br>Maybe another episode where Inojin, Chouchou and Shikadai try to remove Kakashi's Mask like SasuNaruSaku did.</br></br></br>  <br>The funny thing is that he doesn't want to come back, he's the same edgy sperglord he always was, plus he's mentally disturbed from all the trauma he had growing up.<br><br>It's likely that Sasuke feels completely out of his comfort zone when he's around friends and family, and although he claims it's for the "mission" he likely prefers the solace.<br><br>I mean, what kind of person can't drop by in 13 years, but comes running when his buttbuddy Naruto calls? That's what Sasuke is.<br><br>He likely only knocked up pinkshit so she would be busy with a baby and stop trying to follow him around everywhere like she tended to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  sp doesn't seem to like chouchou, uh?  <br>?</br>  <br>Well, she's in the poster while most of the ones with full character designs aren't.<br><br>Though I imagine she'll get a bit shafted after being such a big part of the gaiden.</br></br></br>  <br>the only from neo inoshikachou without profile and she didnt even appear in the trailer</br>  <br>Well she got plenty of paneltime in the Gaiden, they might want to give a chance for the rest of her team to catch up, characterisation-wise.<br>Her dad got knocked out in the prelims, so she might too for some POTTERY.</br></br>  <br>Well, she had her own little story arc, even if it was just for comedy. I wonder what new thing she could fixate on in the movie.</br>  Does Hinata love Naruto more than he loves her?  <br>Probably i mean every couple is like that</br>  <br>The exam itself does not seem to have much time given to it in the film, sadly enough, so I doubt we'll get to see too much generally, and less of the neo Team 10.</br>  <br>Of course she does.</br>  <br>Naruto and Hinata love each other infinitely. There is no comparison to be made.</br>  Do you guys think Bolt likes the nice lady that lives in his house?  <br>Can the the love for your waifu make you stop a Moom cutting bean?</br>  <br>The best interpretation of the character is probably something along the lines of him knowing he's a fucked up lunatic bastard who might go ballistic at the drop of a hat, so he's keeping himself away from civilisation unless there's a specific purpose for him coming back and having to interact with people. <br>That and not feeling like he belongs or some shit like that, burning all his bonds like Kakashi warned him not to.</br></br>  <br>They're all fucking manlets.</br>  <br>Sure, probably not as much as he loves daddy2 Sauce but that's the same case as his dad.</br>  Looks like Himawari made it into the marketing. Of course, so did Sasuke for The Last, despite his whole 20 seconds of screen time.  <br> When he smiles his eyes will turn to the shape of the crescent moon <br>Yep, it's Netori. No clue when or how he came back to earth and fucked Elastigirl, but his papa is the moon caliph.</br></br>  <br> But towards his sister Himawari he is quite the gentle brother <br> He didn't actually throw the cake, did he? </br></br>  <br>It's fantasy japan after all.</br>  <br>Now that would be quite the ruse. But if Boruto didn't throw it, who did?</br>  <br>maybe he knocked it off the table by accident, when he was raging about naruto not being home</br>  <br>You like them 6 footers do ya?</br>  <br>Best girl.<br><br><br> In the manga she became a good and frank mother <br> good and frank mother <br><br> If you look at the Uchiha crest on her back, you are filled with a deep emotion <br> how in Tobirama's name did we allow them to breed </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be just him stomping about in frustration, causing it to fall off or something.<br>Bonus points for Naruto showing up right the second he inadvertently fucks up the cake, makes his little sister cry and ruins the whole party for everyone.</br></br>  <br>thats rude</br>  <br> but has now become an adult that jokes with his friend <br>Tsukkomi Sauce confirmed back? <br><br><br><br><br>There will be a oneshot to clear all of this up, but everything points to Nurudu being inaugurated shortly before chapter 700.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would explain why his face looks kinda downturned here  and why Hinata looks more sad than angry.</br>  <br>Given that she didn't make it into the gaiden nor the trailer. Don't expect much.</br>  <br> Fucked Elastigirl <br> Not Orochimaru who we know can have female bodies and can stretch.  <br><br>Kishi making Orochimaru gender ambiguous was obviously super hardcore foreshadowing that Orochimaru and his moon bitch are Mitsuki's parents meaning everybody was right in guessing Mitsuki's parent.</br></br></br></br>    <br>He's Sasuke.</br>  <br>I'm okay as long as the marketing staff keeps pushing cute sunflower pics.</br>  <br>Bort confirmed manlet. Nurudu confirmed king of the manlets.</br>  <br> "notice me" <br><br>fucking hell every goddamn time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just Nurudu teaching Konohamaru the Rasengan.<br><br><br>He has two dads. Kabuto and Netori.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What more is there to know? She's a smaller Hinata with a Nurudu makeover, and she loves her edgy shit of a brother. <br><br>Her VA is also Saori Hayami. That's all you really need.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Marketing staff only seems to care about the SN foursome.</br>  <br>I can't believe how people so stupid can exist in This world is a fucking comic for gods sake</br>  <br><br><br><br>Hhnnggghhh, Hinata and Himawari are so precious</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a shame Kishi hates/cannot do fluff.<br>At least he doesn't even try and thus does not run it for everyone.</br></br>  <br>Well, pics like  seem to disagree.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q7G<wbr>ufgWKksI</wbr>  [ ]<br>You ain't seen shit, son.</br></br>  <br>He only cares about the Uchiha line in Konoha. He made an heir with Skaura, because no other Konoha woman would have wanted him after his edgy years. Now, there is no need to care for Konoha or Sakura.</br>    <br>I thought Naruto was taller than that.</br>  <br>[AUTISM INTENSIFIES]</br>  <br> Sai trying the Almighty look </br>  <br> no other Konoha woman would have wanted him after his edgy years <br><br>Why would anyone in Konoha have a problem with him when they are ok with the guy running the orphanage?</br></br></br>  <br> Shikamaru steals one of Gai's/Lee's horrible spandex suits and starts flashin people with them <br> shenanigans ensue <br> turns out he lost a bet with Temari or Ino </br></br></br>  <br>Because all the women had the hots for Naruto the savior, instead of Sasuke.</br>  <br>Kabuto was actually a pretty cool guy, though.

I prefer Team 8.</br></br>  <br>They actually used teamwork something unique to every other team. Team 7, 8 and Team Gai were basically 3 individuals.</br>  <br>It's for NUNS4.</br>  <br>We never see 8 or even Gai fighting as a unit. A real shame because with both you could have some interesting shit going on.<br>I like Team 10 but they have been given a team role and specialisation from the start. If this manga had any actual team work in it or if it was important in any way it would have been neat to see the members of each team work out in what role they can contribute the most, with some team combos.<br>Since side characters are generally starved of attention and development, we never see any of that, which I think hurt the story massively.</br></br></br>  <br>Each team had parallels but not so much team work.<br><br>Team 7 was basically the Sannin 2.0<br>3 OP Individuals...The Guy with all the crazy techniques, the hidden ancient evil inside him, and the muscle cleric.<br><br>Team 8 was the "Tracking Team"<br>Kiba had the super nose, Shino had the bugs for stealth, and Hinata for Byakugan sight.<br><br>Team Gai was the Taijutsu Specialist squad. All 3 never really showed much in terms of Ninjutsu or Genjutsu. Neji used the Hyuuga techniques, Tenten had weapon scrolls and Lee was Bruce Lee.<br><br>Team 10 felt like a team. The YoYoBullet is genius. Chouji is the YoYo, Shikamaru the String, and Ino was the aimbot. Teamwork.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaguya will appear in a Video game before in the anime </br>  <br>I like Team 10 beause I love the idea of being raised together with the children of your parents best friends and do the same with your own kids.</br>  <br>Makes one wonder whatever was up woth Teams 1-6. They must feel more than mediocre.</br>  <br> yet we haven't seen a single thing out of her, <br><br>Maybe you haven't<br><br>We've seen three or four official scenes with her so far, and one where she's talked. So far she's characterized as the innocent or well happy type</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Needing arms <br><br>He has a fucking skeleton arm monster he can make appear if he needs a new arm.</br></br></br>  <br>She's stated to be an unfashionable sort of cute girl that wears baggy clothing.<br><br>Her chest things are huge, but she's always worn clothes that cover them up.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd love to see a scene of her interacting with Ino, Ino trying to push her to be a bit more out there and dress a little bit more provocatively, while Hinata gets beet red out of embarrassment, trying to cover it by arguing comfort/function over looks.</br>  <br>Sasuke just visit Naruto, he doesn't hang out with Sakura. See  Therefore, Sasuke ignore his family</br>   muh team 7 <br> Only nurutu and the sauce are still in contact </br>  <br>Is it time?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rL-<wbr>nx3FXZF4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I like that short hair, but prefer and miss the long one</br>  <br> Sakura has Bort and Salad with her <br><br><br> Sasuke just has Bort <br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ino probably knows better than to encourage the one girl in her generation who dwarfs her to unleash her full power.</br>  <br>What does she care, she's got Sai on lock<br><br>No other girl can do freaky mindswap sex with him</br></br></br>  <br>wouldn't her trick be basically roofy date raping herself using some guy's body?<br><br>where does the other person's perception go?</br></br></br>  <br>It can stay were it is, subdued or they can pretty much switch places and/or link their perceptions.<br>So Sai would feel himself in Ino''s body getting fucked by his own body, feel his own body's pleasure of fucking Ino, who would likewise get both body's pleasure but also the echo of them sent via perception link from Sai, and send it once more back to him etc.<br>It's a small wonder they ever stop fucking.</br></br></br>  <br>Whoops, meant to reply to </br>          <br> tfw Minato and Kushina shipped Narusaku </br>  <br>lee got a child?</br>  <br>chatte pls</br>  <br>Minato is such a cuck he probably wanted the girl who reminded him of his waifu for Sasuke.</br>  <br> Minato is such a cuck <br>He was Namikaze "One man Klan" Minato for a time</br></br>  <br>Minato and Kushina shipped Narusaku<br>Jiraiya shipped Narusaku by defualt (his pupil was supposed to achieve everything he couldn't and that included to leave the friendzone)<br>Kakashi shipped Sasusaku<br>Itachi shipped Narusasu<br>Neji shipped Naruhina<br><br>Neji and Kakashi won, except Neji had to give his own life for his OTP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are there people who legit think this sort of thing and are you imitating them to get a laugh out of the responses, or did you make it up yourself?</br></br>  <br>Truly the most dedicated shipper. That man should get an award</br>  <br>Ramen Man shipped Naruhina</br>  <br>Holy shit he got wrecked- losing it on his sixth when she's on her twelfth.<br> holding back hair to slurp noodles <br>This is my fucking fetish. What episode / movie are these credits?</br></br></br>  <br>It's the most recent ED.</br>  <br> implying Itachi didn't win the hardest </br>  <br> minor youtube search <br>Apparently she kicked everyone's ass in some minor ramen-eating special as well. Canon massive eating ability.</br></br>  <br> Kushina shipped Narusaku <br>?</br></br>  <br>It's a mix of Ramenguy's chapter in the Konoha Hiden and an earlier omake the anime did.</br>  <br>I think the original poster means about Kushina's quote "find someone like me"<br>Kushina and Minato don't even know Naruto for 10 minutes, I don't think that this count even as shipping and more as giving live advice in Kushina's case and assuming something and possibly teasing his son in Minato's case</br></br>  <br>Hinata looks like Bort's older sister, not his mom.</br>  <br>but this doesn't work, "somebody like me" could mean a nice person that loves him, I doubt Kushina meant "fuck your mother"</br>  <br> implying Hyuugas age past their teens <br>What do you take them for? Uchihas?</br></br>  <br>Dem moon people genes, man.</br>  <br>Jiraiya's book he wrote was a sex tale about Narusaku</br>  <br>Living on the moon means they don't have an atmosphere to shield them from radiation. Thus they've probably developed intense anti-DNA damage mechanisms over the course of evolution. Since DNA damage is the driver of cellular aging, Hyuugas don't age like normal humans.</br>  <br><br>We are talking about how a line is interpreted by retarded shipperfags who are gone far enough to actually like Sakura. Just remind yourself of that.<br>Those two in particular were red herrings thrown in by Kishi to keep teasing fans into that shit/have a nice feasible excuse should he change his mind.</br></br></br>  <br>He totally would if she did though</br>  <br> Jiraiya shipped Narusaku by defualt (his pupil was supposed to achieve everything he couldn't and that included to leave the friendzone) <br>Do you seriously believe that Jiraiya didn't want his pupil to marry the girl with huge tits?</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it wasn't.</br>  <br><br>We never did learn Netori's age, have we?<br>He could have been 68 with those genes.<br>Also Bolt and Himawari are not only god-spawn with massive genetic potential, but combining the Uzumaki longevity and Hyuuga aging will keep them around and kicking for a fuck-long time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kushina said find someone like his mother. That doesn't mean in the superficial sense. Kushina was a loving person so she wanted the best for her son. That means she'd want him to find someone who would love him with all her heart, who would lay her life down for him, who would lift him out of despair, and who would tell him "I love you" honestly. Hinata fits that mold because like Kushina, she loved Naruto since the day they met. Sakura doesn't even come close.</br>  <br>Got a point, the man knew tits are where it's at</br>  <br>It's really hard to look hardcore when you've got your mom's cute girl eyes.</br>  <br> Naruto might not outlife his waifu after all. </br>  <br>damn, hiashi is hot<br><br>no wonder both his daghters are semen demons</br></br></br>  <br>Which is why he should just smugface it like in bottom right 24/7</br>  <br>He might not with the regeneration and all. But if he didn't use regeneration he probably would.</br>  <br> Naruto becomes an old man like Hiruzen <br> Hinata still looks 20 </br></br>  <br> Uzumaki longevity <br> Hyuugas aging like elves </br></br>  <br> tfw you will never see Hinata and Hanabi mom. </br>  <br>This man is 700 years old.</br>  <br> Medic ninjas hate him </br>  <br>thanks, based SP!</br>  <br>I wonder what would have happened if Jiraiya and Hinata had met in part 2</br>  <br>They could have touched upon that a bit. Say, she died when Hinata was kidnapped (was Hanabi born yet?) which is part of the reason why Hiashi was so harsh with her, taking a bit of his sorrow out on her in trying to train her to be strong enough to defend herself, not really realising what he's doing.<br>Or some shit.</br></br>  <br>Hanabi wasn't born when Hinata was kidnapped.</br>  <br>Yeah, right like Kishi would do that. Hinata's relationships with her father and Nedgy got yada yada'd offscreen at the end of part 1.</br>  <br> tfw she is mostly dead. </br>  <br>She probably dead, giving Hiashi a reason for being such a hard-ass.</br>  <br> Hiashi looks the fucking same <br>Goddamn when will this man age?</br></br>  <br> Jiraiya spots her feelings within two minutes <br> is a little bit jealous, but happy for his pupil <br> proceeds to tease the fuck out of her <br> gives lewd suggestions on how to best get the attention of a man, claiming that having trained him for three years he knows Naruto more than anyone <br> she goes redder than a dying sun <br> Jiraiya expects her to go full Comical Girl Violence on him <br> instead she just leaves the room, saying that she knows Naruto better than that, he is a genuinely good person, not someone into the depraved shit Jiraiya suggested <br> Jiriya is impressed with her, goes off and slaps Nardo's shit around for not noticing her <br> a bit later probably has a more serious discussion with her, warning her that he's thick skulled as fuck, but also saying he's happy someone kind likes his godson <br> two years later <br> The Last Happens, Nardo and Hinata get together <br> she finds out about Naruto's upper arm fetish <br> recalls that's the first thing Jiraiya suggested, weird as it was </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>By the way, what happened to Tsunade? Did she die during the war?</br>  <br>Nursing home with the other Kages</br>  <br>No, but she was probably the hardest hit by the zombie confrontation and then the infinite tsukuyomi.<br>She stepped down and let Kakashi take the reigns soon after the war, she's last shown undressing for the having annual orgy with the old-timer Kages.</br></br>  <br> Hinata: (Huh?) <br> Himawari: Kyah, kyah <br> Hinata: (Himawari... she's in an awfully good mood. I wonder what's going on?) <br> Himawari, you're having fun, eh? What're you doing? Will you tell mama about it? <br> Himawari: Kyah, kyah <br> Mama~  <br> sfx: su (point) <br><br> Hinata: Eh? <br> sfx: bah (look) <br> Hinata: Uhm... there doesn't seem to be anything there. <br> sfx: buh (stare) <br> Hinata: Himawari, you're a bit curious, aren't you? (Heheh) <br> In just a little bit, I'll be done with laundry, so we'll play together then, okay?  <br> sfx: yoshi yoshi (pat pat) <br><br> Naruto: Ehh, so that's what happened? <br> Hinata: Mm... Thinking back, Boruto actually did the same sort of thing Himawari did when he was her age. I wonder if there's something going on? <br> Naruto: Perhaps, <br><br> Naruto: Dad and mom came to see them, eh? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 9. Good Boy <br> 10. Bad Boy </br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck how is this possible?</br>  <br>Eugenics.</br>    <br>Poor Mei isn't quite Anko tier yet, but by her looks she's on her way there.<br>Did she turn to ice cream in lieu of having a good man?</br></br>  <br>Tsunade's using magic illusion bullshit. Hiashi and Hinata are all natural.</br>  Is the Hyuga clan still fucked up?<br>Considering Neji is dead and Hinata quit her clan for becoming a housewife</br>  <br>Did she pass down Hashirama's secrets of how to suck at gambling to Sarada? At this point she is probably the closest thing she has to a granddaughter</br>  <br>Poor Mei and Yamato were the only ones who aged like shit.</br>  <br>They become Nardo fanboys.<br>Also given Hiashi's treatment of Neji and Hinata, it's safe to say that they gotten a bit more relaxed.</br></br>  <br>The entire idea of having a family branch dedicated to die for the main branch is fucked up. What's up with the curse anyway? Too bad Kishi can't into morals. Having Neji to die for Hinata as he was supposed to is beyond fucked up</br>  <br> Saori Hayami <br><br>Aila from Gundam Build Fighters?<br>Neat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the point is that Neji chose to die. He wasn't forced. He sacrificed himself out of love for his kin, not out of indentured servitude. He could have easily let Hinata die. But he chose not to. That distinction is crucial.</br>  <br>I just realized I replied to the wrong post, I meant to reply to this </br>  <br>blah, blah, blah.<br><br>And hard work &gt; natural talent because nurutu trained a lot, right? Nothing wrong with being the son of the 4th Hokage, the child of the prophecy, having a super special bloodline and real losers like Rock Lee never achieving shit, right?</br></br></br>  <br> Had a one-way crush on Naruto when she was young, but now that has transformed into deep, romantic love <br> After she built a family, that love reaches out to other family members as well <br> that love reaches out to other family members as well <br>Doujins when?</br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically he's part 1 Neji without the muh DESTINY bullshit? <br><br>Nice.</br></br></br>  <br>I missed the part where part 1 Neji was a good brother.</br>  <br>Sultan of Cuckistan Abu-Toneri al-Mooni managed to bang some chick eh?</br>  <br> The entire idea of having a family branch dedicated to die for the main branch is fucked up <br>For starters, keep in mind that what we know from internl Hyuuga politics, we know from Nedgy, NOT an objective source.<br>Branch families would in any feudal setting be subservient to some degree, kept down so the main line is in power, and often in a position to best serve/protect them. That idea by itself is not that strange. Compared to some of the shit IRL kings and nobles did to potential pretenders the Hyuuga are downright soft, if controlling.<br><br> What's up with the curse anyway? <br>It was probably fleshed out in more detail somewhere, but presumably deactivates the Byakugan when you die so if someone kills you they can't transplant your eyes into themselves and thus gain the advantage - see the only guy with a Byakugan transplant having it under some odd sealing tag.<br>Additionally it seems to be tied into your brain, able to kill instantly when the right signal is given so if a branch family member would try and pull an Itachi they could shut that hit right down.<br><br> Having Neji to die for Hinata as he was supposed to is beyond fucked up <br>I find it odd that people keep bringing this up.<br>Like his father, he was branch Family and thus had a duty, one he was unhappy with. But he came to terms with that duty and fulfilled it, not because he was made to to serve a superior, but to save someone who in spite of it all was still a sibling/cousin for whom he would give his life willingly. He avoided being made to do his duty by embracing it on his own terms.<br><br>By doing that he finally connected with his father, like many other characters at that time due to Kishi's own father dying or something.<br>He also died for the cousin he has previously hurt greatly and ffor the person who has made him see the light and allowed him to live the years he had as a much more peaceful, happier person.<br>Plus it was a war and someone from that generation had to die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> without the muh DESTINY bullshit <br>Learn to read.</br></br>  <br>Sakura was the real underdog that won against the odds. She wanted Sasuke's cock and she got it despite not having a special bloodline and being destined to the MC because this is shounen. Too bad sakura a shit and Sasuke is a deadbeat dad but the point is she got what she wanted while Ino had to settle down with Sasuke's poor man</br>  <br>Are you shitting me<br><br>Ino dodged a fucking bullet</br></br></br>  <br>But the muh destiny bullshit was nearly all of Neji's character in part 1.</br>  <br>More like Sakura took the bullet and swallowed it.</br>  <br> blah, blah, blah. <br>Your disregard for that distinction doesn't make it null. He choose to sacrifice himself for, arguably, the two most important people in his life, not for some sense of duty to the main branch, he already got pass that angst. Hiashi himself told zombie Hizashi that their sons where fighting as equals in the battlefield.</br></br>  <br> Ino dodged a fucking bullet <br>From your  male  perspective. The point is Sakura got what she wanted and Ino got a reject</br></br>  Will they finally give Vegeta any major victories?  I really hope Super gives some of the supporting cast some victories. It's been one of the most universal criticisms of later DBZ and GT that no one but Goku gets to do anything exciting or score any major victories.<br><br>I'm hoping that with the introduction of Universe 6 Beerus and Whis realize they're gonna need more than just Goku and Vegeta to help them fight so Piccolo, Tien, and Krillin (maybe even Yamcha too) get enough power boosts to remain somewhat relevant.</br></br>  <br> saiyans not saving the day <br> Humans actually doing something <br>kek</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure nobody would like that.</br>  <br> Krillin <br> Yamcha <br> relevant <br><br>They're only relevant because them getting killed rustles Goku's jimmies.<br><br>And for some reason Krillin is appointed senzu bean distributor.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yamcha will be the one to take down the first big bad <br><br>How would you react? I can sort of see a Yajirobi situation going on where he cut off Vegeta's tail but it would be hilarious to see just for how everyone would react at the event.</br></br>  Enjoy the weekend and take it easy.

My understanding is that if you're having a request met, you're supposed to not request for a bit to give others a better shot at their requests. I'll probably toss out more normal requests for her at some point in the future.<br><br>To the myriad of dunkfags who have e-mailed me in the last couple days, good to meet you and hope you're enjoying the videos!<br><br>And to everyone else, good luck with your requests this weekend!

I never see akihisa requested here  part of the reason why i practised so much drawing in the first place was so i could draw my husbando </br></br>  Requesting Hitagi, long hair preferred. If you'd like an idea I'd appreciate her putting her hair up into a pony tail.  <br>A fair number of them do.</br>  <br>Yeah it's pretty common, you should make a reference image and make requests if you want to.</br>    <br>neat</br>  <br>Looks damn good, not OR but I hope ya do mine</br>  <br>Really nice delivery</br>  <br>Hello Gwenbro, I'm glad you are back!

That's the only reason I can think of.</br></br>  <br>I made this earlier but gave up on it when drawing the controller revealed to be way harder to draw than i thought it would be. I hope this helps you at least a little when you wait for a proper delivery. Im going to sleep now, my head is killing me<br><br>I might as well do that one day</br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty good anon.</br>  <br>I've never seen anyone draw Ika in that fashion, so I want someone to draw a SFW one</br>  <br>Better than original.</br>  <br>nice~</br>  <br>Why not just a regular reference and ask for Ika in a tanktop and short shorts?</br>  <br>I'm always impressed by speedy drawfags. Nice job on the thighs and chest, looks really soft.</br>  <br>Because I'm terrible at english and don't know what they're called</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127886316 <br>This is it, thank you so much!</br>  Requesting Sako wearing a uniform from MLA.<br><br>references here: http://imgur.com/a/Tpr7L<br><br>Thanks if you consider</br></br></br></br>  <br>OR here, don't worry about it and truth be told it looks leagues better than the original.

And now im finally off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Evening everyone.<br>Requesting Sanya but couldn't make up my mind of seeing her in a cheer leader outfit or wielding a big ass battle axe, so the only reasonable thing to do is to request her doing both.<br>Thanks and hope everyone enjoys their weekend!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127888358 <br>Hate to break it to you but the "delivery" that was deleted was Lolyfag</br>   thread isnt close enough to death for me to request again before i go to work   Requesting Mako being cute or sexy either in her Goku uniform or a bikini.  <br>Who is she?

I hope you'll enjoy the rest of the weekend!<br><br>I wasn't actually sure how do describe my request  that's why I decided to include some examples,  but I couldn't ask for anything cuter than your drawing since she looks incredibly cute in this pose  and in those panties.

Thank you for drawing my beloved!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dude, I'm sorry<br>I really am.</br></br>  <br/>  What happened to taking it easy?  <br>Mad jelly.</br>  <br>nice tits</br>   she probably won't be drawn this weekend <br> &gt;but got 3 10/10 deliveries in the General in the span of 3 days <br>Guess it's gotta balance out.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Kill yourself fag</br></br></br>  <br>That's incredible!

I've always wanted to see more of him in that outfit too so it's perfect! <br><br><br>Aah, I love this! Thank you very much Ojii! My king looks super cool! I would love to have the delivery on my shelf too, though if you don't want to you don't have to go out of your way for it. It was a very pleasant surprise, I hope you have a great weekend!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm confident that she will be drawn this weekend.</br>  <br>If you got such nice deliveries, I would at least expect for you to excuse yourself from the weekend thread</br>  <br>Thanks, and thanks even moreso for putting effort to redraw it.<br>b/w is fine with me too.<br><br>also you should probably lookup on reviving dead hds temporarily, should be possible to get bit of what you lost depending on how bad it is.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's so beautiful 34, both Alleyne and Rias look gorgeous in those dresses and the colouring is amazing.<br><br>Thank you so, so much for this.<br>Hope you have a great weekend.</br></br></br></br>    I almost missed the first thread. Here's to a good weekend!<br><br>Requesting my fluffy sweetheart. Some specific ideas are sitting on a couch or bed with a "yes" pillow (either in lingerie or an oversized shirt, posing in a 1920's era pinstripe suit, or wiping the sweat off her brow while gardening.</br></br>  <br>Your waifu is so cute anon.<br>I just want to hug her.</br></br>  <br>You're welcome, glad that you liked it!</br>  34 will you art trade with the thread again?  <br>That's look interesting you definetely put lot of creativity in it, thank you for drawing my Goddess friend!</br>  <br>Not OR, 2nd Riasfag, but looks amazing anon.</br>  <br><br>You're welcome !</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, nigger.</br>  <br>read her request, she clearly says she's up for art trades.</br>  Requesting Kochou Yoshida studying for an exam, with the study headband of course.  <br> second Riasfag <br>Get out, she already has a wonderful husbando and you are a piece of shit she would never love</br></br>  <br>There just so happens to be a second one yeah no fuck you</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127890316 <br><br><br>Not him, but listen,<br>Would you rather have an unknown as a Riasfag, or the dunkfag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The unknown for not being an obnoxious dick waffle that shoves his fetish everywhere.</br>  <br>Not that it'll help my case, but I am the dunkfag.<br><br>I said before though in the main threads, I like Rias more than dunk tanks, it just so happened someone took the request and it's getting filled, future requests won't involve dunk tanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Just fuck off and don't bother Riasbro</br>  <br>The unknown one because he's not annoying, and seems good.<br><br><br>Your future request will just bother the one already here, and also bother us. And also bother the drawfags because several requests of the same character.<br><br>There's no place for you, go away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm staying with just regular arttrades for now, the thread-wide ones are very time/effort consuming and the art quality really isn't as good because of limited time frame. I'll probably do it again when there's some event/theme I really want to draw though.</br>   This might be really risky, but should I repost the latest episode of Waifu Wars for people who missed it?   <br> No and stop entirely while you're at </br>  Requesting this cutie poi!<br><br><br> lol/spoiler] </br></br></br>  <br>No offense, but I don't really care about it.</br>  <br>People are desperate for waifus.<br>The end.<br>Same as every weekend.</br></br></br>  Requesting Ririchan  <br>I thought it was gonna be a series of images instead of poor writing</br>  <br>Marblefag here thank you very much anon</br>   no more deliveries   Any wips?  <br><br> all drawfags are dead </br></br>  <br>cant get motivated, even though there are so many requests i want to draw<br><br>sorry</br></br></br>  <br>It's just colors.

Thanks, and have a good weekend!</br></br>  <br>Clearly the requestrs wants his waifu drawn an ice cream treat or rather her wearing an ice cream related outfit.</br>  Has despair set in?  <br>There are about 25 more to draw.</br>  <br>Yes!</br>  <br>But it's only Friday!</br>  <br> W-who are they? </br>  <br> about 25 more <br>There is still a chance mine might be one of them!</br></br>  <br>Not yet, I need this with my waifu for despair to consume me.</br>   killing a blonde <br>Am I supposed to root against this thing?</br>  Surely not, this loli is too cute to be a scary demon.  <br>That loli is my waifu.</br>  I got something for her to devour.  Does she just kill if you aren't a lolicon?  <br>Good choice.<br><br>You mean some nice food r-right?</br></br></br>  <br>I hope the devour means she gives them forced blowjobs and bites the dick off just as they cum, giving her a mixed cum-blood facial.</br>  <br>I think the key is that you have to be in denial too</br>   Precure Thread   I want to suck Mana's dick.  <br>Mana a shit.</br>  <br>Shit thread.</br>  I'm going to marry Haruharu!

Actual image in the following post.<br><br> (...) However, after she met Haruka, subconsciously, she gradually changed her way of thinking and became softer. Together with Minami, she's like Haruka's guardian (laughs). Among the three, she is the one with the most common sense, and she probably plays the "straight guy (tsukkomi) role".  <br> It appears that Kirara's eyes aren't Tsurime, but more like cat eyes? <br> Tanaka: That's the character designer, Nakatani Yukiko's quirk. It's not like I went "please give her have cat eyes" but I think that she has a certain cat-ness to her, doing things at her own pace. When the first draft for Twinkle came up, it was already close to what it's now. I think that regarding the head/face for the three of them, nothing much really changed in the final draft. <br><br> The name "Amanogawa Kirara" is also the only strange one of the group. <br> Tanaka: I came up with "Kirara"*. That's certainly what you would call an unconventional baby name**! I wanted her to give off a "a modern, unusual girl" first impression. Since she has a star motif, including her surname, it was a pretty straightforward process. When the producer Kaminoki Yuu first heard about this he said "(If I were to meet her) I would defensively go &lt;can I really become friend with such a girl?&gt; for a second there" and so we were like "Yep, this is it!" (laughs). <br><br>*Kirara is a real name, it's not like he invented it.<br>**Unconventional baby names are called "kirakira names", that is "glittering names".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kirara gives nicknames to everyone around her "Haruharu", "Minamin", "Yuiyui" etc. <br> Tanaka: Kirara employs an even attitude towards whoever she meets, good persons or bad persons. That's why she doesn't speak formally to Minami, even though she her senior, and has very little requirements to give anyone a nickname (laughs). Like she just goes with whatever sounds best, on the spur of the moment. <br><br> The first Kirara episode was 12 and it was a comical one. <br> Tanaka: We wanted a comical episode 12 to contrast the serious episode 11. Since 9 was Minami's episode, we went for a Kirara one, and added another character to show a side of her which we haven't seen before. In this one, she only sees donuts (laughs). Since Ranko makes quite the display of aggression, Kirara just decides to join in the fray midway. However, it's not like Kirara hates Ranko, she can understand how she passionately follows her dream and acknowledges her in the end. <br><br> Episode 17 dealt with her mother and it connected with her dream. <br> Tanaka: Since we wanted to give each character an episode about family relationships, we came up with the idea of having her on stage with her mother. We also wanted some pressure by adding the idea of "surpassing your own wall". Stella is in the same business as Kirara, and to Kirara she's a target she wants to surpass, a rival. <br><br> It looked like the Shooting Star Key came out of Stella's body. <br> Tanaka: It's not like it was actually inside her body. The Keys are hidden in places that can't be seen, and react to the Precure's dreams, coming out at the very best time. <br><br> Like, they use people and objects related to their dream as "gates"? <br> Tanaka: Yes exactly. In episode 17 it was "the relationship between parent and child". Their dreams realized, they can move to further objectives. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> By the way, Twilight finally transformed. <br> Tanaka: We decided early that Twilight was to become a Cure. At first she was an antithetical character to Haruka's "a commoner who wants to become a princess", but after Haruka understands what becoming a Princess means to her in episode 18 and has no more doubts, her role as the antithesis has ended. So we made her become a Precure after a big battle in episode 21. <br><br> What should we look forward to? <br> Tanaka: regarding Kirara, after she achieved starring in a world-level fashion show, she will be even busier as her popularity rises. There, an interaction between her and Towa will be created. July-August will be what I would call "team reorganizing chapter", and we want to depict Towa and Haruka and the others interactions. While investigating more about Towa, through her point of view we will aim to re-evaluate the character traits and relationships that were affirmed before. Look forward to see the relationship of the 4 girls gradually change with this new addition to the team! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's it. There's two other images with some text but they don't say anything new.</br>  I want to choke on Mana's monster cock.  Am I looking at it wrong or are there really times where they outright take pictures of the toys instead of drawing or CG?  <br>Rizumu stronk.</br>  <br><br><br>Hnnnnnnnnng<br><br>Kirara best rara</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not like she has much competiton.</br>  <br>I want Mana to force my head down on her dick.</br>  <br> &gt;Episode 26: To the rescue of milady Towa! Fighting royal fairy! <br>Return of Roma?<br><br><br> July-August will be what I would call "team reorganizing chapter", and we want to depict Towa and Haruka and the others interactions. While investigating more about Towa, through her point of view we will aim to re-evaluate the character traits and relationships that were affirmed before. Look forward to see the relationship of the 4 girls gradually change with this new addition to the team! <br>This sounds fun</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Yui? Why Is noone talking about Yui? Is this some kind of Toei's ruse?</br>  <br>It's a miracle that her name was even mentioned in that spoiler for episode 25.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br> Hestia <br>So its not a kids magazine?</br></br>  <br>That poor girl outside under rain.</br>  <br>I hope there will be lots of interaction between Towa and Yui  the true grand princess </br>  <br>get in line</br>  <br>It's animage, I think. I never quite understood how it works but it seems to be a mix of show for big girls and little children. Or at least the charts always have ikemen on them.</br>  <br>Is that a popularity contest?<br>Damn Haruka is far behind</br></br>  <br>Yes. She was 18th the previous month, Minami was 13th and Kirara was 7th.</br>  <br> Kirara suggests that she should try working as a model for a new magazine. Towa accepts <br><br>TOWA NO<br>YOU'RE BEING LED ASTRAY</br></br></br></br>  <br> otherworldly qt elf becomes your roommate <br> not slutting her out and using your friendship to boost your own popularity while overworking her to exhaustion <br>ISHYGDDT.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I guess elves are only good for one thing</br></br>  will they have idol-finisher?  http://a.uguu.se/feujgb.webm      <br>Firefox says the webm is corrupt.<br><br><br>Pink qt holding a pink qt.

It should read:<br><br> Thanks to the headmistress' plan, Towa has been enrolled at Noble Academy. Since she was raised as a princess of the Hope Kingdom, her thought process is however quite removed from what's considered normal in this world. <br> (...) Towa became a transfer student, and Kirara's roommate. (...) <br> (...)　Kirara is offered a job as a main model for a new magazine. She accepts, but since she tries too hard she becomes fatigued and start losing her smile. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It will probably Towa's job to put a smile on Kirara face, seems better than the alternative.<br>Thanks, kind anon.</br></br>  <br>She is using brazilian carnival costume?</br>   Go play pic related on my hacked 2ds <br>So ace/Aguri is only in dance simulator.

GoGo too, kinda. I wouldn't say "usual" indeed, the last two examples aren't even quite the same thing.</br>      <br>Yes obviously, the newer seasons (current and last one) always feature more prominently in the crossovers.</br>  Reminder that this girl is voiced by the same person as  Haruharu <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6fo<wbr>9F7EZfdE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  HOLY SHIT  <br>So Haruharu is a jew?</br>  <br>Haruharu is Aryan, more like.</br>  <br>That explains why she smells so bad.</br>  <br> Princess of flowers <br> smelling bad </br></br>  <br>She must be the Princess of carrion flowers.</br>  GOKIGENYOU!  <br>no, it's not as if hacha ever made fortune &amp; honey's identities a secret. they're in the opening, for god's sake.</br>  What is wrong with her fingers?  <br>I want to touch her bottom.<br><br><br>She's from another world, aka, an alien.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still can't get used to her purple pupils.</br>  <br>She was touching filthy plebs with her bare hands</br>  <br>I'll admit it looks a little odd,, but it just reminds me of Heartcatch's styilization.<br><br><br>... Okay now that fuckin' bugs me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why is cologne there!? he's dead!</br>  <br>that's the most terrifying one yet. I mean, DAMN. that's something out of a nightmare.</br>  <br>I can't help but try to imagine what the crossovers would look like realistically. To the other girls, do the Heartcatch cures have even bigger eyeballs (I'm not bashing the style, it's a favourite of mine). Or do they all look like regular humans and we just see the different styles?<br><br>Also, animation-wise, are the crossover movies like a big collab between certain animators from all series?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not QUALITY or anything, it's a constant quirk of the design. <br>It's just that it looks pretty darn weird once you notice.<br><br><br>I think they just get one character designer to make the designs more... consistent? for the movies.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the point. The crossover movies exist to give some more screentime to the characters you know already from their series. Watching them without having watched each respective series is not only heresy, it's also stupid and you should feel bad for suggesting it.</br>  <br> I think they just get one character designer to make the designs more... consistent? for the movies. <br>Yes, and he sucks, pic related. He's like worse than Kawano. This time around they apparently gave the respective animators more leeway and it looks amazing from the fresh and Yes!5 screenshots.</br></br>  <br>So you except little girls to have watched every season before watching the crossover movies.</br>  <br>I expect every little girl on /pc/ to have watched every season included in each crossover movie before watching them, yes.</br>  <br>Why the hell is Waldo and Akagi there?</br>  <br> Akagi </br>  <br>K-Kaiji?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>She will be there in the next crossover.</br>    <br>Akagi is a boy though. If you mean the shipgirl, that would definitely be a way to keep big friends around.</br>  <br>Towa's fake surname is Akagi.</br>  Have you ever done this /pc/?  <br>Why would you want Towa when you already have Aguri</br>  <br><br>He's not as bad as Kawano, but he can't draw two even eyes to save his life.<br><br>Seriously, one is always higher/lower than the other.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Extra Cure bonding with the Yellow instead of the Pink <br><br>How Unprecure!<br><br> Meanwhile Minami <br>Sucks to be a Minamifag.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Blue officially a fairy now</br>  <br>They said in the interview that she will be the one to develop the most, but later in the series.<br>Of course it's totally possible that they said that thinking the readers have goldfish memory and nothing will happen.</br></br>  <br> Hime hover handing Erika </br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br> Erika face <br>Perfect</br></br>  What did people think of the first time they saw a villain become a Cure? Especially Eas, since she was the first one to get that treatment.<br><br>I remember being surprised when Siren became one, but that was more because she was a cat prior.</br></br>  <br>Kawano's the man, he really found his calling in Hacha. What I assume his Gopri episodes were weren't too bad either.</br>  <br> I remember being surprised when Siren became one, but that was more because she was a cat prior. <br>Eh, if a dog can do it...<br>And if anything I'm still sad about Michiru/Kaoru NOT being cures. They even borrowed the Bright and Windy powers... only to get a generic dress out of it and that's it.</br></br></br>  <br>I do this all the time<br><br>Feels good man</br></br></br>  <br><br> Splash Star could have been the first season with four Cures <br><br> Instead Saki and Mai get new, even uglier forms while Michiru and Kaoru stayed dead for most of the series. </br></br></br></br>  Honoka is my waifu.  <br>I was kind of expecting it. There was four keys at the beginning, and Eas was starting to go soft.</br>  <br>And then there was that episode where they take Setsuna to go bowling, where all foreshadowing got really heavy-handed.</br>  <br>Poor elves are not used to being alone at night. If you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I'm not sure what you mean. Can you please explain?</br>    <br>Well elves and their 'one thing', you know what.</br>  <br>I don't understand.</br>    When I marry Alice my life will be set.    <br>You don't know what elves are good for?</br>  <br>You've lost me.</br>  <br>As if Alice would marry some jobless poorfag.

But there's something weird about her mom's face that I can't put my finger on...  <br> Ayy lmao </br>  I bet the /u/ crossovers had a field day with this episode.<br><br><br>I think that's it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's the Kawano effect.</br></br>  <br>You don't have any idea how /u/ on /pc/ was like. ANY FUCKING IDEA.</br>  <br>Komachi actually looks good.<br><br><br>Did her midriff grow?</br></br></br></br>  Yeesh. Henshin, one finisher after another, donem, no fighting at all.

She can't cook and burns toast, but at least she tries. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127874160 <br>I literally never saw the name Ebina before Yahari and now it's in this too.<br><br>This is almost as bad as the one show with the girl called Benisu</br></br></br>  <br>Theres been such a while i seen tongue in anime thats not porn i though they were censored by the new Tokyo laws like the genitals and nipples...</br>  <br>She does not bully Ebina. Ebina is a protected species.<br><br>She bullies Kirie though, since litterally percieves her as nothing as a obidient slave rather than friend Kirie wants to be. Not sure Umaru even sees her as a human and not some part of interier.</br></br></br>  <br>Spoiled, yes. Bitch? No.<br>In fact I like her because of her spoiled personality, it really makes her childlike and cute.</br></br>  <br>That sounds adorable.<br> Have you fucked her? </br></br>  <br>Just because you marathoned the manga after seeing the first episode of the anime doesn't make you a primary all of a sudden.</br>  <br> he doesn't read everything from Norway Scans </br>  <br> he reads scans </br>  <br> he actually read the scans with shitty puns instead of the raws </br>  <br>Look at this butt-blasted EOP and laugh.<br>LAUGH!</br></br>  The OP made me want to play MonHun again  <br>...because there isn't.<br><br>Anyway, the whole point of the show is what an awful little person she is at home. Her Himouto incarnation is supposed to be an antihero, and you're not expected to like that aspect of her.</br></br></br>  I want to fuck her in her usual real self, but kill the whiny little loli bitch she turns into when coming home.  <br>I want to make sweet Loli love to the real umaru</br>  <br><br>nice try my ip changing newfriend</br></br>  <br>How do you make Loli love to the real Umaru? Are you a loli? Are you bringing in a loli?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127871964 <br>Someone needs to make a new one with tittymonster Ebina.</br>  How is she not a fat greasy piece of shit?  UMARU A CUUUUUUTE  <br>Latebloomer, I had perfect skin throughout high school, but got bad acne starting at about 21.</br>  <br>but where you also a model student that was great and sports and music despite not practicing at all and just being a lazy slob outside of school?</br>   kirino <br> bitch <br><br>pick one</br></br></br>  <br>I'd prefer a constantly expanding image like this, with Spurdo and all the anime Ebinas.</br>  <br>That would work if the characters made the same expressions, but they don't.</br>  <br>awful memed my newfriend, try again</br>  I want to spoil Umaru  <br>Fuck you nigger, I pick both.<br>Kirino A FRESH, BIG, STEAMING, STINKY SHIT.</br></br>  <br>ok, secondary</br>  <br>I want to spoil Umaru all day long with my dick.</br>  <br>I want Kirie to spoil Umaru all day long with her vagina.</br>  <br>new umaru or old umaru?</br>  <br>It doesn't need to be a literal copy of this image.<br>It can just be fanart with all the Ebinas :DDDDing at each other.</br></br>  <br>your right she's a super king kamehameha biatch</br>  <br>New Umaru, old Umaru, UMR-san, Kumaru.</br>  <br>Yea</br>  /a/ is having the predicted reaction to Umaru, but the outbreak of brainless seasonal nerds is much larger than anticipated. How do we contain it and fix the 20 minutes mistake?  <br>This. The main reason I dislike Kirino is because she's ugly, but she grew on me eventually as a character.</br>  As a dirty secondary I must know, does Umaru personality changes over the course of the manga or stays the same?  <br>Why contain it?</br>  <br>There's less of a focus on her selfish antics, and she does appreciate her brother more than the first episode would imply.<br><br>Just to say though, you really shouldn't ask things like this. The whole point of fiction is that you experience it yourself, not get told about it from others.</br></br></br>  <br>The gags stop being about Umaru is spoilt, and more about friendship and platonic sibling love.</br>  <br>Why contain it?</br>  Ok i'll just straight up ask: Do they ever bang?<br>Help me out anon, your answer will decide whether or not i drop this show</br>  <br>This manga isn't about romance. <br>Ebina, Boss and her little sister, have a higher chance of winning the oniichan than Umaru. Oniichan has a mother complex.</br></br>  <br>Nope.<br>Fuck captchas.</br></br>   literally turns into a little girl <br> yet /a/nons don't relate to her </br>  Use the fuking catalogue   People actually think Umaru is worse than Kirino. <br>What a horrible world we live in.</br>  <br> tl;dr they dont bang <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>She does not turn into a little girl. She turns into a Gremlin.</br>    <br> blonde <br> a bitch <br>What did you expect? All of them are fucking bitches. You do everything for them and they just bully you and tell you to fuck off.</br></br></br>  ebin a   <br>Bobby please. There is no need for a billion thread shitposting about Umaru being cute or a bitch or getting unnecessarily heated about a light gag manga adaptation</br>  I feel like only people who have sisters understand that Umaru is a cunt. People without sisters just don't get it.  <br>this</br>  <br>She's not even a bitch. She mellows out later in the manga and becomes super adorable. <br><br>You need a starting point to have character development</br></br></br>  <br>:-DD</br>  <br>I'm not saying she's a bitch, she's a dumb moeblob. I'm saying there is no need for people to get upset about her being a bitch when she is a dumb moeblob that you are supposed to find cute like a reasonable human being and that they need to stop going autistic mode about this series just because it's an airing anime</br>  <br>More like:<br>People that read mango understand Umaru is an Angel and living idol of perfection and motherly care<br><br>Anime only fags that think its Oreimo are still buthurt about Kirino.</br></br></br></br>  <br>shut up tripfag</br>  <br>She's not a cunt though, she's just a spoilt brat but sincerely loves her oniichan. It's more like people who don't have little sisters will think that Umaru is a cunt.</br>  <br>You are dumb tripfag posting the usual aggravating nonsense tripfags post. People should filter you and dont get upset, but they still do, and some even reply!</br>   there are people who think that umaru is a bitch   <br> episode 1 <br> bigger bitch than kirino <br>fuckoff newfags</br></br></br>  <br>THIS</br>  <br>ikr newfafs these days lull</br>  <br>Its about people throwing a bitchfit to an adaptation of a manga this board should be well aware of already.</br>  If you cant love a gilr like humaru you are not made to be a n iniichan  <br>Alright<br>Have fun with those getting extremely agitated about Umaru for the sake of replies. I'm sure it'll be fun</br></br>  <br>My sister is much worse than this cutie</br>  <br>I do and she isn't enamored with me nor does she act like the spoiled bitch that this show revolves around. So no you are incorrect, imoutos do not act like this towards their brothers in real life.</br>  <br><br>Being an anime only fag should be no reason to just spout blind hatred without knowing her character.<br>What we got so far really isn't enough for that, not to mention acting like a spoiled child is cute rather than bitchy.</br></br></br>  <br>So this is a harem with both mother and sister in it ?</br>    <br>Have you thought about the reason is maybe that you are a shitty brother to her? Just asking.</br>  <br><br>Did you watch the episode? She starts throwing tantrums when he refuses to drop everything to buy her stuff---that's what makes her a bitch.</br></br>    <br>The parents haven't been seen once. It's a gag manga not a harem. The romance is played off as comedy. Both the main siblings have magic genes that pull the other characters.<br><br><br>That was her being spoilt, not a bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  <br> yfw Umaru will turn into a golddigger when she grows up and will lure in rich, powerful men with her talents to support her while she spends most of her time NEETing it out. </br>  <br>Literally living the dream</br>  If this is an example of how these threads are going to be (i.e. "Secondary!" "No you!"), I think I'm gonna bounce. Enjoy shaking your fists at each other for the next three months.   WHAT A BITCH <br> tfw having to explain everything </br>  <br>Stop being a little bitch, that's just boring shitposting. <br><br>This is a fucking gag manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Same deal with Oreimo.  Kirino is not a bitch. </br>  Hey mangafags, does this have romance or is it just SoL?  <br>0% romance until about half way through then it ramps up to about.2% towards chapter 100. You have to really want to see it.</br>  <br>yes there's incest and romance</br>  <br>Manga starts out with all the jokes revolving around Umaru being a brat and then changes to sibling relationship moments with gags. It's been literally one episode and people are calling Umaru a bitch despite that.</br>  <br>This . Hardly anything at all. <br>Mainly done for comedy value to see Ebina blushing like crazy and Kongou being a desperate for oniichan.</br></br>    <br>Hopefully the brat phase in the anime gets over soon.</br>   tfw I realized I'm literally a male Umaru <br><br>Yes, I leech off my older sister as well.</br></br>  I never once like Kirino, but after one episode I like Homura. Even when she's acting a spoiled brat, she still has cute moments. Maybe that and her not verbally abusing her brother all the time make her more likable.  She's a brat, not a bitch.  <br> I like Homura <br>Wrong thread, Madoka.</br></br>  Reminder that the dependent one is the older brother. Umaru can actually live by herself if she wanted to, unfortunately Taihei keeps spoiling her.  <br>I'm more tired than I thought</br>  <br>No she can't. She has school and probably won't be able to support herself. <br><br>Her brother is meant to be super clever though, no idea what he's doing in such a backend job.</br></br></br>  tfw you will never have a cute 2D imouto  <br><br>Remind that Taihei is useless for anything besides cooking and cleaning.<br>Umaru just gives him a reason to live.</br></br></br>  <br>That's because his high school circle is there.</br>  <br>His hobby is doting on his sister. He literally sacrifices everything else for that alone.</br>  <br>Now you are talking out of your ass.<br>He is sacrificing nothing because he doesn't have anything in the first place.</br></br>  Reminder that Umaru-chan is actually a sci-fi thriller and Umaru isn't actually blood related.  I want to gape her asshole and fill it with cement.  <br>Are you missing the fact he's been invited to do stuff from his work but literally does none of it because he goes to look after his sister.</br>    <br> 2D <br><br>Even if I did I wouldn't be able to  _hug  her.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a convenient excuse for not doing things he doesn't want to do anyway. Taihei would prefer to walk away from his desk job and become a student chef of Ebina's brother, a path Umara made possible.</br>  <br>Why do you assume he wants to hang out with them?<br>Have ever thought me may just not be the social type?</br></br>  Seeing this really good i really want to see Godakobo animated my other holy trinity of manga, Sotomura and Shinozaki.  <br>she is like kirino but autistic</br>  <br> Sotomura adaptation <br>Yes please.<br>Long skirts are justice.</br></br></br>  I like her, she's cute but I wish she didn't take her socks off when she goes into chibi mode that sucks. But her casual clothes are megas cute.  The part where she autistically eats her snacks and watches anime all day hit home hard it's pretty much what I do including going to the store in disguise so no one see me buy a cart full of snacks  <br> going to the store in disguise so no one see me buy a cart full of snacks <br><br>What kind of shithole do you live in where buying cart full of snacks is such a social taboo?</br></br></br>  <br> Shes like Kirino but not unpalatable  <br><br>fixed</br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but if I saw that I would judge them.</br>  <br>kirino is a little more realistic imo reminds me of my two little sisters minus the anime part just huge bitches <br><br>himeouto is just a 10 year old in a 16 year old's body but she seems to have enough awareness to hide her autism from her peers she might just be a crazy sociopath who needs to be stopped</br></br></br>  <br>I have massive social anxiety it takes me 30 min of pacing up and down of the hallway of my apartment before I can leave I will grab the door handle but can't work up the courage to pull it and then keep pacing <br><br>I mostly worry about someone from college seeing me since I live downtown in a small college town, and I also worry about the cashier so what I do is everytime I go buy snacks I hit up 4-5 stores to spread it out as to not raise awareness</br></br></br>  <br>So we have another boring SoL show. Just checked the first episode, it's stupid as fuck, but I'm still going to continue watching it because it didn't give me any solid reasons to drop it. The only reason I can actually name is that this is more bland than water so far.</br>  <br>You sound like a faggot.</br>  <br> I hit up 4-5 stores to spread it out as to not raise awareness <br>Well, at least you're getting some exercise.</br></br>  <br> I have no idea what slice of life is. <br><br>FTFY.<br><br>In additon, why the fuck are you watching shit that openly think is bland and stupid you retarded masochist?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Strictly because I don't drop shows on the first episode.</br>   brother actually folds to a childish tantrum   <br>for real that part made me mad he was holding strong but then he caved faster than a cave <br><br>also do people really roll themselves up in bedding like burrito?</br></br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br><br>Nobody cares as long as you don't smell, but if you're one of these neets that doesn't shower everyone is going to be disgusted with you no matter what you're buying.</br></br>  <br>Especially from a 15 year old girl. <br><br>If she is a spoiled brat, it's entirely her brother's fault.</br></br></br>    <br>Me and my sister used to do that when we were kids.</br>  <br> SoL <br>This is a gag manga mainly and if it's boring why are you watching it you retard.</br></br>  <br>For the past several years I've identifed myself as a burrito, and not just sexually.</br>  <br> also do people really roll themselves up in bedding like burrito? <br><br>I'd actually like to try doing that.</br></br></br>  I really wish this crap would take an unexpected dramatic turn, like a bad end kinda way.  <br> strictly because I'm 12 years old and I'm on vacation <br><br>FTFY</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>i would cave in.<br>i can't handle the noise.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>You could be taco-fluid.</br>  <br>Not really. I am doting my imouto like Taihei and i don't think she a cunt. She is so lovely even she treat me like Kirie treat Bomber.</br>  <br>I feel like only people who have sisters understand that Umaru isn't a cunt.

Why?</br>  <br>I hate captcha a very large amount since I was here prior to it. I'd rather take accelerator back and all the other spam including the js color spam than have to type all that bullshit in.</br>  Sylphin is a good girl that only wants her onii-chan to be proud of her.  <br>If I ever buy a pass it's to report all those retards faster.</br>  <br>She want Alex dick</br>  <br>Stop trying to prove you're an oldfag, you're not one</br>  Wow...i'm barely on the first chapter and already, Umaru is worse than in the anime. Somebody lock her in a cage and throw away the key.<br><br> At least there's good reaction images in the manga though. </br></br>  <br>What a shit design, blue - white - blue - white - blue with blue eyes.</br>  <br>How slow do you read?</br>  <br>whatever nigger</br>  <br>That's a great design, though.</br>  <br>Depending on how text-heavy it is, I can read one chapter in 5 to 30 minutes, assuming it's 20 pages</br>  <br>Seriously, its sad when our new friends pretend they've been here for longer than a week</br>  <br>Umaru is like 5 minute chapters. It'll only take a few hours to read up to the current point. Plus, it's not like you have anything else to do.</br>  <br>Approx 30 chapters of Umaru in an hour. 110 is impossible</br>  <br>These are 10 pages chapters, very little text</br>  Subs when?   lovin oniichan makes steak like she wanted for a surprise. <br> doesnt eat it. <br><br>Does anything happen with her friends or rivals at school or is it just the brother that interacts with the himouto version?</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have troubles with reading?</br>  <br>She's like a more fuckable Cure Marine except I wouldn't be committing a crime.</br>  <br>Best girl nigga<br><br><br>It's going to be more about her friends as well as oniichan soon. The anime already introduced the 4 main girls and the main oniichan.</br></br></br></br>  except she's not a bitch. she's just a bit spoiled.  <br>That ticked me off a little too. I'd kill for a kind oniichan or oneechan to make me hamburg.<br><br>Who gets full off of just that many snacks anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>Someone who's not a 400lb landwhale.</br>  What if her oniichan gets married?  <br>I don't know if getting kidnapped by his boss lady and locked in her sex dungeon can be considered marriage.</br>  <br>You're a retard<br><br>6 volumes = 1000~ pages<br>1000 pages / 60 minutes = 16 pages in 1 minute/1 page in 0.25 seconds<br><br>How the fuck do you read one page in 0.25 seconds</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw ebina will win the onii-chan instead of manager </br>  <br>Where do you think you are?</br>  <br>Oh shit I almost forgot about that. I'd say nice boat has had a lasting effect though.</br>  <br>Shouldn't it be 2 seconds?</br>  Why does Umaru talk in third person in the manga? Is it supposed to be cute?  <br>60/16<br>=3.75<br>Who's the retard now?</br></br></br>  <br>One page in 3 seconds is still way too fast</br>  <br><br>Idk probably pretty nice and sweaty though I wanna steal her thighhighs and smell them</br></br>  <br>It's 1 page every 3.6 seconds. But still impossible if you're actually paying attention instead of mindlessly clicking through it.</br>  <br>the same reason Donald Trump talks in third person, to feel extra special.</br>  <br>Nobody will win the Tahei oniichan. He will die in the ensuing family war.</br>  <br>I read manga at 1.5x speed, just like how I watch my anime.</br>  <br>She's talking like a child<br><br><br>Well /a/ has had an impact on anime in the west: with scanlations, things like mangatraders, etc. but that doesn't really impact Japan or anime itself</br></br></br></br>  <br> Donald Trump refers to himself in the 3rd person to seem cuter. <br><br>I laughed more at that image than I should have.</br></br></br>  <br>I talk in third-person with my parents and sibling.<br><br>It's a language and culture thing.</br></br></br>  <br> You're a retard <br>you are the retard that reads too slow</br></br>  <br>It is with the right documentation</br>  I hope she gets bullied. If there's no Manami punch scene equivalent in this I will be extremely disappointed.  find two flaws  <br>cucked and dead</br>  None, currently rewatching. So corny but so satisfying  <br> dead. </br>  <br><br>He accidentally Euphie</br></br>  He didn't fuck Kallen  Being king edgelord counts as two flaws.   Didn't fuck C.C <br> Died </br>  <br> &gt;Didn't fuck C.C </br>   jibun  and  wo    isnt Rolo <br> feel free to gtfo </br>    didn't fuck kallen<br>didn't fuck cc<br>didn't fuck shirley<br>didn't fuck suzaku<br><br>Zero are you even trying</br></br></br></br></br>  Why did he choose "kill the Japanese" as the example of his Geass' power?  <br>1. He has made mistakes despite being cunning and intelligent. See: Euphy<br><br>2. Emotions get the better of him. He's frailer than he acts.<br><br> 3. Literal Jesus (virgin) </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> intelligent <br> emotional <br>There you go OP, having one of them makes the other a flaw automatically.</br></br></br>  <br> dead <br><br>Bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>He allowed himself to become fujobait.</br>  <br>  dead <br><br>I can't believe there are anons who don't believe our lord and savior is alive.</br></br></br>  <br>Could have literally used his geass for any other purpose than for asking one favor or deed.<br><br>Seriously, making people slaves would have been much easier and more useful</br></br></br>  <br>motherfucking this<br><br>He and Suzaku are perma-fujobait.</br></br></br>  <br>Spent too much time explaining what he was about to do and his plan would always get foiled because of it: See Euphy, Cornilia, etc<br><br>Also not making the emporer his servant was a pretty dumb thing to do</br></br></br>  <br>What's the fun in that though</br>  <br>For us nothing but he still did something wrong</br>  <br> making the emperor his servant <br>Are you retarded or have you just not seen the anime?</br></br>  <br>He used his code to force the emporer to shoot himself, there could have been a more useful option. Especially since his main goal was to find out information about his mom</br>  <br>Check and mate.</br>  <br>You think that would have worked? That's too simplistic.<br>While that might have worked for getting some info out of him, the main goal wasn't that, it was to kill him and crush Brittania.</br></br>  <br> Seriously, making people slaves would have been much easier and more useful <br><br>As long as you don't care about the victims. Still, he did use it like that near the end when it actually did help his plans</br></br></br>  <br><br>You have to be dead to be a ghost</br></br>  <br>that means literally nothing</br>  <br> I disagree so it doesn't matter! <br>Miraculous Birthday is canon.</br></br>  He  died a virgin.   <br>none of the picture dramas are canon</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127808<wbr>792/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Decent time to quit anki all together. Maybe wait until they're all mature. Just read. Those words are common and you do not need to keep reviewing them.</br>  <br>anime with japanese subs (closed captions).</br>  <br>Yeah, funny enough I'm the one who shared it with djt. Problem is that the deck in question, although useful (it's also giving stroke orders), is only giving 1 koohii story per Kanji. The one from the anki website is giving 2, which I think is still better.</br>  <br>Why would you do that?</br>  <br>Not really, I've seen that word many times while reading, even in my moege.</br>  You best get used to seeing tears here.  <br>By that logic every Yugioh character with a recurring motivation is a meme</br>  <br> They released Half Unbreak <br>Now imagine if it hadn't been Yuma's staple but an action card, they could have released something that wasn't an utter waste of space and ink.</br></br>  <br>In Shun's case, they became memes.</br>  <br>Catch up to Arc-V, then watch all the other shows in between new Arc-V episodes.</br>  <br>watch arc-v and whenever you catch up spend time in between subs releasing on binging the other shows to get more fun references.</br>  what is it about Haruhi that gives her that raw sex appeal?  her euphoria  <br>mlady</br>    <br><br>Her voice actress being a slut</br></br>  <br><br>Do you think she's ever fucked a guy using the Haruhi voice?</br></br>  What does /a/ think of Yuki Yuna?  A bland madoka wannabe with an equally bland madoka fanbase wannabe  <br> There is literally 1 (one) semi-important character outside of the main cast, Sonoko. If I remember correctly there isn't even any other one that has a fucking name <br><br>That's completely deliberate. The show is purely about the girls and how they react to their situation, as with a SoL anime, not about the situation itself. Do you think it was an accident that they only had text messages to communicate with the Taisha?</br></br></br>  <br> That's completely deliberate. The show is purely about the girls and how they react to their situation, as with a SoL anime, not about the situation itself. Do you think it was an accident that they only had text messages to communicate with the Taisha? <br>The fact that it is deliberate does'nt make it better. The fact that a story is mainly about the psychology of the characters does not excuse an empty world. In most cases it requires an interesting world and character cast to create interesting character interactions. Because why would the interactions of only 5 characters that all share the same fundamental character trait, namely the fact that they value their friends extremely high, be interesting?</br></br>  <br>Have you seen a SoL before?</br>  <br>Okay, it was funny once, but now it's enough with this meme.</br></blockquote>]
