[ This Power Level placements are correct, right /a/?     This is the up to date one  inb4 boo hoos      Technically Wizard has the strongest suit of any Kamen Rider, you did see Black RX right?    Not like it matters, Space Sheriffs and Zubat have the toughest armor of any toku hero short of an Ultra    Not this shit again     calling it bait  and little goblins too, anon, and little goblins too  Now if only I had a "get a load of this guy" pic       No it's not. This is the idiot-friendly version.     It is Hao Asakura, not Asokura.    The types of threads remind me of when I used to play with my friends as a child, and in the end it would always result in us arguing by saying "infinity plus 1". Don't you feel somewhat embarrassed by still doing this as an adult?   I see you're a Demonbanefag.    How is Battler that low, he literally punched Bernkastel in the face   There's no fucking axis! what kind of bullshit is this?    idiot friendly   Over a hundred characters      Less powerful.  Featherine is above them all, but she's in special for some reason.     This is getting asinine even by autistic powerlevel thread standards. The only things you people bitch about now is whether or not to move Demonbane/Featherine/Myuugi half a pixel higher or lower. Take 's advice and shut the fuck up.    spike   stronger if not even with shichika    nigga w u t       No contradiction there, retard.  Having a huge clusterfuck of characters with no special tier is garbage. Sorry you wasted hours of your pathetic life making this.     oh look another power level thread. fun thread guys   Fuck off, weeaboo.   Reminder that Full Possession Shurouga is stronger than Demonbane      No contradiction there, retard.  Nice irony there      Hatou is up there   I approve.       I don't know about the other faggots, but It's proven that Shichika can take atleast 8 bullets and still fight as if it's fucking nothing. Spike wouldn't even touch him.      deleting your post to make a new one  Confirmed idiot.     Nobody cares     Accel stil above madara     Arcueid should be higher. She can fight the God tiers of CCC, who are confortably in large planet/solar system level and billions of times FTL.    [citation needed]   Reminder that even nu52 supes can throw SSJGod into the sun before he could react.   Nothing suggests they are that strong outside of the mooncell.    Check the Origin Servants vs Kiara fight.   So? The fact Arc can fight them on even level still puts her at that level anywhere else.        implying he couldn't survive being thrown into the sun      throwing Superman into the sun  Are you aware of the flaw in your plan?     Full Possesion Shurouga is just a meme m8.    When did she fight them? And Nasu's statements mean shit since he doesn't canfirm that she can go and beat them at their strongest under the conditions where they have those stats.  As it is now CCC god tiers are still way above her in raw feats.       He would suffocate in an instant.      She is the only one who can fight Amaterasu among all CCC characters, while it was noted all other characters stand no chance against Amaterasu. Regardless of how anal you are about feats, that still puts them at the very least on a comparable level with other CCC characters, if not stronger.    instant transmission, boya   Why is Guts not in here? There are weaker people in this list, more weaker than him.    Hajun   might as well put Ren in there too      Esdeath would destroy Guts.    This, if Gutz is not there I'm sure as hell Spike should't be.    Spike is only on that chart made by retard for retards, ignore it. Any other chart than that is much better.    move jack rakan to special tier. he can respawn if he is errased from reality    What does Yuugi even do?   I'm ultimate.    Beerus not rank 1 with Goku rank number 2  Your list is shit     My ass, Esdeath is garbage, she wouldnt even kill Dio, who's time stop only lasts for 5 seconds, unlike her 8 second advantage.    He can only respawn for a couple moments though.    So? Dio's The World is faster than light and has regeneration.     being this new    Reminder that Guts is a jobber.  He wouldn't be able to kill any characters at the bottom of the chart.      DIO's timestop lasts 5 seconds  Your new is showing.      Don't you feel somewhat embarrassed by still doing this as an adult?  I stopped worrying about stuff like that when I realized that doing so is no less immature.     I don't think Saitama should be that high, considering he doesn't have reality-bending powers.    And you're still watching stupid cartoons as an adult   Stronger than every DBZ character.    Saitama to the top baby  As someone that recently started Noein (only 7 eps in) just how powerful are the titular character and Haruka?  homura would literally die if you shot her in the head.  she's not a god she's just able to interfere with a god    At least we know one thing will always be true.    homura would literally die if you shot her in the head.  Magical girls can't die from physical damage. Shooting her in the head would just render her unconscious until she regenerated.     Wouldnt the End of Evangelion be above the viewer then?    No. A fictional event can not do anything to real people.    Special tier.     missing the joke     The holocaust made people pursue nazis.    I see what you did there    Battler was only able to punch Bern because she was caught off guard by the sheer absurdity of someone punching her.   AuAu is in special because she is literally omnipotent under special circumstances, but completely powerless otherwise. That makes her impossible to categorize normally.       Special Tier    The same applies to the other witches, yet they're in the field.  You always assume they're at their post powerful on these charts.        That all only holds true if you interpret extended metaphor and delusions as literal fact.  MAGIC ISN'T REAL         aka: I am so broken but truck-kun can kill me.       The difference is that Lambda/Battler/Bern/Beato can all be defeated, even under perfect circumstances. AuAu, at the height of her power, is 100% invincible. The only way to "win" against her is for her to decide that the story is more interesting with someone else's victory.  I would place her in special tier because there is no contest when she is involved. She can just choose to automatically win.       I would place her in special tier because there is no contest when she is involved. She can just choose to automatically win.  That's a nice way to summon all the Demonbanefags.     I don't know shit about demonbane other than copypasta, but it seems to me he should belong in special as well.    That's because it had the word "general" in it.  We've had quite a few power level threads in the last month that go to 500 replies, and the mods have no problems. Keep the tears flowing.        Actually no. Battle was able to punch Bern because they were playing a game. She was not fighting using her real power. She was playing a magical board game with him.      There is a Demonbane that forces her to write her own defeat.  There is a Demonbane that can summon an infinite army of Featherines.  Demonbane wins.        Honestly, the easiest way is to just put all of the toppest tiers on the same level, since they're all just fluffed-out pseudo-omnipotents. You can spend all day arguing about who's stronger, but never come to a conclusion because they're all fucking bullshit.   http://news.mynavi.jp/news/2015/06/<wbr>25/296/  Otaku (431 males, 2122 females) have voted for their ideal wives and husbands and here are the results:  </wbr>  Ideal wife (2261 votes)  1.

(Tennis Prince)  Pardon the blank place/possible mistakes as I’m not familiar with a lot of these shows so feel free to correct me.                          Japan knows who the best waifu in Free is.   It is a popularity contest based on popularity of the show and the character design of the character and it has nothing to do with how good of a wife would the character actually be.   but most/none of those characters are rich filthy millionaires.      Nozomi   2nd place  Maybe Japan isn't so bad after all.        5. Gintoki (Gintama)   ideal husband   What        12. ???  I can only make out that they're from Touken Ranbu      all that idolshit  Japan needs to get nuked again.      The shit taste is astounding.    REMOVE IDOLSHIT   12 is Shokudaikiri Mitsutada from Touken Ranbu. He's really more of a waifu, though.     16. Kagami (Kuroko no Basuke)   u w0t     Literally who    japan in charge of taste       They should have made one without idolshit in it.      Okay so apparently it's this dude http://touken-ranbu.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Shokudaikiri_Mitsutada</wbr>     Gintoki #5   No Ginko  You fucked up, Japan.       1. Makoto (Free)  For once Japan shows superb taste.      having a waifu from fujobait show   I'm not sure what to think about that.      Hanayo  I don't watch LL but I don't think I've ever even seen smut of her. Then again this is the bizarre result of 2k bitches extremely outnumbering dudes.     15. Honoka (Love Live)   Why do they hate Honk so much       Really Japan?      what? how? why? so japanese just watch Love Live all day everyday or what?      16. Kagami (Kuroko no Basuke)   18. Haruka (Free)  If they're gonna be massive faggots they could at least have good taste.       16. Saber (F/SN)   Ideal wife      I can understand the rest of top 10 but Arakita? What the fuck, Japan?  My female weeb friends who are into Yowapedal doesn't even take Arakita into consideration.       I didn't even think guys would watch UtaPri let alone have a waifu from it     Not wanting Kagami's Rimfire.  You are the one with shit taste.      15. Okita (Gintama)   What?      He's not even best boy. What the fuck Japan?     10. Akashi (Kuroko no Basuke)   At least he's rich.      I don't think i seen this much shit taste in a while Japan. Thank you for confirming your taste still holds true.      characters almost exclusively from shit anime on this list   complain about Saber  butthurt much?         That abyssal gap in tastes between male and females. Womin should take control of the anime industry already.         Only the respective first places are the ideal wife/husband due to their qualities, the rest not so much and seem more like popularity votes.      I'd much rather have Kise    One day /a/non ratios will be like this. It will be a glorious tumblr board.    You seem to be forgetting that Love Live is also popular with females.    I agree, Doutanuki is lightyears better than that eyepatch fucker.    men choose Haruka   women Makoto   That nip female master race.       Otaku (431 males, 2122 females)   Ideal wife (2261 votes)   Am I the only one seeing the problem here or are we all just pretending to be retarded again?       No, we've got /y/ and /cgl/, they work incredibly well as containment boards. We'll be fine.    Enjoy your massive case of STD contraction. You're also going to have to make sure you get treated for AIDS, or you will die a painful death.    It's very likely that females voted for both categories when you look at the gender split numbers. It'd explain why there are so many girls from female-oriented shows in the list.    You forgot /u/ and /co/.    All that concentrated shit taste, sasuga Nippon.     Lesbians Anon-san.     Wait, /u/ isn't inhabited by men?     Macross Frontier: Sheryl  Fuck you Japan, Ranka Lee is a million times better.      20. Yui (K-ON)  Wait until the KyoAnifags hear about this.     kek   What the fuck is with Japan's huge boner for idolshit?    didn't think guys would watch UtaPri   You'll be surprised at how many guys are really into utapri anon.   some pretty boys  like me  are into utapri to cosplay and get cheap squeals from fangirls          So girls love Rabu Raibu.     Fucking dykes   Uta Prince &amp; Love Live crossover when?  Hoping for the otakus and the fujoshis to freak out      14. Onodera (Nisekoi)  Get rekt Shitoge      7. Nanami (Uta Prince)     Each person can vote for both wife and husband.     Hanayo   not the worst raibu      Only lesbians who like fat rapists voted for her.     to cosplay and get cheap squeals from fangirls  Well, you're a faggot, but I can understand you so I guess I'm faggot too.     wanting a bum as a husbando   ayyy      not best dera though    Reminder /a/ is literally ~70% female.    Agreed. It should be Ichi-nii.     20. Yui   憂  It's Ui. Not even similar to 唯. Get your Japanese straight.         Asuka SAO      Ideal wife   18. Haruka (Free)  Good.      Both males + females voted for both questions it seems.     implying Saber isn't from a shit anime  butthurt fatefag?     not surprising that theyd want that aids infested slew      Asuka SAO      Girls pretending to be guys  I sure hope so. From now on I'll consider every Anon talking about their dick to be a girl pretending to be a guy.      free   diabolic lovers   hakuouki   male  Sounds legit.        Sorry.     LL is simply fun and girls are great. It has nothing to do with idols really.   im@s is far more idolshit than LL ever was and it's doing many times worse.       Honoka last Love Live  Japan is sometimes really disappointing.    All that otomeshit. Fucking shit taste.     Well, those guys got more than two years worth of semen.    Touken Ranbu is the tits. Thank you Japan.   No, it's her place alright.     They are right though. Honkers was the most boring LL.      he thinks free doesn't have a faggot fanbase     Agreed. Otomeshit belongs on Best waifus.     16. Saber (F/SN)   Fateshit ded.      Touken Ranbu made it to the list   Not a single Kancolle on waifu list   kek      You disappointed because no self-insert gary stu like Tatsuya and Kirito?    And Hanayo was the most interesting, right?      hating on Amaterasu  Honk is second-best LL. HonoTsuba is best LL ship.       12. Asuna (SAO)   Cuck Queen   Ideal wife        Kantai Crap is dying.       Stay delusional, tumblrtards      Nitro+Chiral is keyed in to the female mindset. It's inevitable.     Honk is second-best LL  Who's best?     I only know who three of those are     This is a "best wife" list. Not best girl.     Calm down m8, it's just a joke.    I can't into nip, but #20 is probably Atobe. He's by far the most popular, and he has a fuck huge loyal fanbase that still worship him obsessively to this day.    Wait what, so this is mostly voted on by females?    Pretty okay list, needs less shitty feMCs though.   Male list is mostly shit but at least they got the first place right.  decent/10 ranking          Jesus fuck, how? You just got here from Reddit?     Maki. Maki, Honk, and then Harasho.    Yes. Sasuga dykes.     otome   no gary stu  What?       Love Live everywhere   Bunch of autists.      Makoto is the biggest fuck up on that list. What a shitty character.    No, I just like guys with actual personalities instead cardboards with character archetypes attached to them.     Yui (Diabolik Lovers)  Why, so you could beat her?       these shit tier lists  What the fuck Japan.      I'm just not a fan of ugly onedimensional rapists.    Why are there dudes in the male list? What the fuck japan.    But this just goes to show Chitoge is best because that list shows how shit Japan's taste is.    Makoto being first saves the whole list from being garbage. He's rightfully the ideal husband.    Because 85% of the voters were wimmyn with shit taste.    my husbando is nowhere to be seen on the list   Sasuga Japan, shit taste,    These are obviously voted by women, I know only girls who like that shitty rice eating waste of space girl from Love Shit.   Fucking LL!   I'd totally marry Nozomi.       He's a piece of cardboard that lonely female otaku project their fantasies onto.     top 5 are the 5 worst Love Lives  Fucking amazing.     To be fair, even if the men voted the poll wouldn't be any better.    Because they could vote for both waifu and husbando, retard.    Isn't that what we all do?     diabolik lovers   what the FUCK      Some of us prefer characters with actual personalities.    So basically the entire cast of love live?  This poll seems rather odd.      How can he be the ideal husbando, when he has all the qualities of a boring waifu? He's literally a little girl in a muscular male body.    Love Live is incredibly popular in Japan.     implying that's not what femotaku want    1. Kira Yamato   People like him never calm down, they enjoy their anger.     ??? (Tennis Prince)     Femotaku have shit taste, nothing new there.   What would /a/'s list be?   Never meet a nigga that doesn't want to fuck more than 1 girl, asuna is a blessing.    He's devoted, hot and moe.   Not a girl, but he'd be my husbando if I were one.   tfw I realized my waifu would have Makoto's personality if genderbent          implying a little girl would conquer her fear to the ocean by swimming through a heavy storm to save a friend   Seriously, if you don't think Makoto is best free, you should kill yourself.       This is why no one take female otaku seriously.     Shinobu for waifu Archer for husbando     I assume it's Atobe Keigo    All otaku have shit taste. Why are you people surprised?    Because she's perflat.    This list is precisely why Japan is going extinct.     any otaku being taken seriously   What drugs are you people on?      Time for you to sell those bags of salt.    Goddamn Japan and their idol shit.    No one takes otaku in general seriously, anon.       All Frees are shit. It doesn't really make a difference which is slightly less shit than the rest.     14. Onodera (Nisekoi)     I read the list three times and I don't see Oreki, why is that?     muh shitty artsy husbando isn't on the list so everything is shit  Cry more.     This  You fuckers are in denial if you think the lists would be any better if the male-female ratio was balanced. Japs always disappoint.   That said, fuck Onodera.       Best raibu wife ranking  Nozomi &gt; Kotori &gt; Umi &gt; Eli &gt; Hanayo &gt; Maki &gt; Honoka &gt; Rin &gt;&gt;&gt; Nico    Seriously what do people see in Love Live? Considering what a massive hit it is both in Japan and West, I assume I'm missing something. I watched both seasons and while I thought it was alright it really wasn't anything special. Most characters were boring as fuck(I even had to check out who is "Hanayo" because I forgot, turns out it was the glasses girl who might as well not exist), the drama in the end was ridiculous, the songs weren't good at all, the CG dances were creepy and Aikatsu looks much better. So why it is such a phenomenon?    The Free defense force is here. Abandon thread.     Because he's shit.    The only girls I can understand not knowing are the three otome heroines.    7. Nanami (Uta Prince)   10. Yukimura (Hakuoki)   13. Yui (Diabolik Lovers)  Otome heroines stronk          Just ignore the obnoxious shits.   Not a SINGLE fucking Kancolle.  Japan I...     Otaku make anime such a shitty juvenile medium. A poll like that shouldn't even fucking exist.    Nozomi &gt; Rin &gt; Maki &gt; Honoka &gt; Eli &gt; Umi &gt; Kotori &gt; Hanayo &gt;&gt;&gt; Nico     claims a character doesn't have qualities of an ideal husband   gets proven wrong   changes subject       You never proved him wrong.     18. Haruka (Free)      complete shit taste     better, but still shit   Expected as much.          <br/>       all these idol shit both male and female   I bet the vote was niche and unpopular as shit while some random fanatic idol otaku find a link and then spread it to their community.         All this Utapri and LL       Good. Boats are shit and anime was a joke.    Absolutely horrible taste    LL domination is well deserved.     idols    Are Swords OK in your book?     Gintoki   Okita   I mean, I like them, but honestly speaking it would be pretty shitty to be trapped in a marriage with either one of them.       Free popularity stronk as ever.     Implying  Even if that happens, this board would be full of chinatsu or other type of perveted lesbian rapist.      1. Makoto (Free)   5. Gintoki (Gintama)      Makoto from Free!   multiple Haikyuu boys  Great taste there.     Free!   I don't even need to see the translation to know that this poll is shit  Fuck off Japan       That's not even me, shitposter-kun.     16. Saber (F/SN)  This has to be a joke, she just sits around doing nothing.     There's only two Haikyuu boys and one of them is literally a side character with rabid fanbase resemblant of Akashi worshippers.   There must be something about that name that attracts crazies.      Yeah, what the fuck, first the Akashit cult, now the Akaashit cult     5. Gintoki (Gintama)   15. Okita (Gintama)  They seriously want a NEET Samurai or a jerk sadist as a husband?       How can he be the ideal husbando  He's gentle, responsible, good with small animals and kids, domestic, honest, diligent, loyal, moe, affectionate, helpful, considerate, brave, is a great older brother and friend, has a strong manly body, likes doing physical work in his freetime and most importantly would treat you with respect and care. Makoto's popularity isn't unjustified in the least.       shitposts   calls others shitposters  Oh the irony.     Did fujos take over /a/ after moots death? what the fuck   Whose death?     Haruka (Free)  Haru-chan is the best waifu confirmed, sasuga Japan     zzzzzz    Welcome newfriend    Why is Umi so low? She'd make the best wife.    My nigger.    Those Love Live rankings are weird as fuck    So he's like a boring waifu then.    If you completely disregard everything I just listed, I guess so.    passive-aggressive Freefags  Gross.     aggressive shitposters  Gross.      431 males, 2122 females        wanting to marry someone with high functioning autism   I'd still have sex with him though     Why the fuck does anyone like Hanayo? He is the literally who LL; shitty design, barely any personality, no relevance or screentime.   She cooks the best rice. She is usually shy and quiet. Waifu material.      Otaku (431 males, 2122 females)  They should only let males judge female characters, that way only people who are the target audience can give a valid view on it. All those women vote for some short haired girl which is far less appealing than a long haired feminine girl for a man.      She likes idols, hence she is just like me    What a shit fucking list.    Well, then, you should just watch mature anime for mature people like yourself, huh.    I thought they want serial rapists.     le fujobait   le fundashibait      Read {Love Live} as Love Lab for a second there and thought that finally the nippons didn't have shit taste     9. Kazemaru (Uta Prince)  You mean Ranmaru? Ranran is upset. I'm glad the senpais are getting more popular, nobody can beat Tokiya or Syo ever.   12 is Shokudaikiri Mitsutada from Touken Ranbu.          gaytama   gaykyuu   cockroko no basugay   Sounds legit  Yes.        All those women that voted for waifus voted for those 2 males than ended up on that list.    You have the saner femotakus and then the batshit crazy ones.     14. Onodera (Nisekoi)  HAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA GET REKT SHITOGEFUCKS COME ON BROTHERS, ASSEMBLE AND REJOICE       Gintoki  lel gintoki....  The guy who drink all night and look like shiet. And his dick is small.       nico likes idols even more     431 males   2122 females  The fujoshits are taking over. Also iM@S &gt; LL       The fujoshits are always overrepresented in these niwaka polls.     Butthurt that even LL has more female fans than IM@S   They need the female fanbase dosh as well, that's why IM@S is falling, unless side-M becomes really popular but that ain't the case.       elevens   having any taste       10. Akashi (Kuroko no Basuke)  Were these otaku 12?     What the fuck are you talking about?    Love live is only popular because females are known for eating up shit and LL have female fans. Love live does nothing better than IM@S. The girls aren't as cute, the songs are shit, the game isn't even a game. Everything about it is shit and second rate.    People are into the hungry NEET thing.    But why are you telling me that? I just said that Nico was the superior idol fan and Hanayo is boring and bland.    Are im@sfags always this butthurt or is it just only you?    Onodera  Are elevens really THIS retarded? Unironically?    (431 males, 2122 females)   Who gives a fuck about what women think?    <br/>   /a/ apparently    Fuck off, Shitogefag.    Is no one going to tell him that women buy anime and vote with their wallet, making what they think fucking relevant?     15. Okita (Gintama)  Are Japanese girls a bunch of masochist or something?      i still prefer her over any other girl   7. Nanami (Uta Prince)   10. Yukimura (Hakuoki)   13. Yui (Diabolik Lovers)  Where the fuck is my SoL about otome heroines doing cute things without boys around?       431 males, 2122 females  I can't stop laughing. And holy shit, the first non-LL non-fujobait entry is Asuna, the second is Onodera, and the third is Seiba. As sausaged of the worst part of nippon.      Fking lowlifes....     14. Kosaki  Not even best Onodera, even fucking Marika and Ruri are better than her. Japanese shit taste confirmed.  16. Kagami.  MY FUCKING SIDES. Japanese Lunchtime Rush really had impact on fujos.       Fujos are the lowest form of otaku. If this was a male-oriented poll the taste wouldn't be as shitty.    Absolutely.     &gt;what the hells with the hard on for love live?  Because those girls are marriage partners and would sincerely want to make a marriage work. You don't pick a spouse that is going to make a marriage fail, right? Free is amusing though.  The question included MARRIAGE which means you and her get along as husband and wife. Too many in past /a/ "marriage threads" would pick a wife that is incompatible with marriage simply because she is good looking and disregards the bloodthirsty murdering or backstabbing aspects of her personality.      Love live is fucking garbage, and so is Japan's taste.  Enjoy Sunrise's cock in your anus, fags.      no Saki     amazing taste for once, nippon.    RIP idolmaster     1. Hanayo (Love Live)   2.

Nozomi (Love Live)   I'm happy   (431 males, 2122 females)  Why          How come every "____ of all time" poll in Japan is skewed because 80% of it is just the flavor of the month that will be gone by next year's poll?    Japan does in general. It's pretty much the dominant anime franchise right now.      431 males, 2122 females  That explains the odd taste at least.      I always asked myself the same question about Monogatari series too.      If Love Live had any male characters besides Nicks brother I wonder if they'd dominate the other chart too.      No they really are I've noticed.      Love live isn't just flavor of the month.     Love Live has a boy?     9/20 Love Live   Saber   A dude   Literal retard  Not sure if we bombed them too hard or not enough.         fking   .....

Kero-chan.    inklings   Come on lets have a thread dedicated to this, I'll eliminate the easy ones by posting screenshots from One Piece              They'll fix it in the BD     Yeah, wont save the pacing though   Do you have anything other than bleach screencaps?   These are one piece screencaps         a classic  So, why are one piece QUALITY screencaps allowed and FLCL caps are not allowed again?     Btw, if you want to post QUALITY, please don't post in-betweens or far-away shots to not make yourself look like a clueless idiot.    thats not a far away shot, thats Toei being shit    i dont get it, whats wrong with this shot? it looks perfectly fine to me.   is it her hand? im just assuming you cant see the other fingers from perspective     What was his name again?  Next week: Back to the swirly-haired pirates!   This, we might know his backstory, but we didn't get a single look at his thoughts ever since he was a child ("father, what have you done !"). Now Oda might just as well leave it all up to interpretation, but I sure wouldn't mind confirmation Doffy's been guilt tripping about Roci/missed Law for 13 years and couldn't bring himself to kill him even after all was said and done. Because at this point it's really just hints and clues and interpretation, which is probably too subtle for a shonen.  It might come in the form of Oda resolving the "why did Doffy bring Law his cuffs ?" plotpoint.      I'm not saying that he is fully recovered, but the fact that he was recovered enough to deliver a finishing blow on Doflamingo who was no where near as beat as him makes it seem like the debuff wasn't even really a debuff at all. Had they put him in a more perilous situation while he was taken out, maybe I'd be a little bit more accepting of it, but it was Gear 4, a chapter where Luffy wasn't damaged what so ever, Gear 4.   I never felt like Luffy was truly in danger, and it doesn't seem like there was any Drawback of using Gear 4 at all, even though he may have been exhausted for a single chapter. Due to the shit pacing, Law's over powered bullshit and Doflamingo being the biggest jobber of all the main villains, Gear 4's downside seems like it's more of an inconvenience than an actual life or death matter. I was expecting some Garo timer shit where if Luffy didn't beat Doflamingo in one go with his Gear 4 he would be out of comission until the arc ended.      Violet cum outside luffi    Minus panels upon panels characters running and Oda's ridiculous habit to show the face of EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER IN THE ARC every 5 seconds, Dressrosa was great.     Luffy fight Doflamingo TWICE  Pretty sure he fought Croc and Eneru more than once as well    What the fuck did I just watch  In the very first PV there were some cuts that weren't in the anime. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=tLI<wbr>ppl9GlX4</wbr>  [ ]  Particularly, Ito's scenes and Strange Juice near the end. Game cutscene?      BUY  THE GAME      Good old brown Rabura.     there will never be a new episode of punchline for the rest of your life      tfw no more AOTS next week    Reminder that you should get a PS4/Vita http://punchline-game.jp/  Also https://www.cs-reporters.com/vr/pun<wbr>chline/</wbr>       mc has chance for perfect ending   decides to die instead      I'm going to buy a Vita if the game comes out in English. Punch Line will make me cross the line.     Will there be English subtitles?    He should've got the harem end     triple zeros  ZERO ESCAPE 3  CONFIRMED       They didn't explain the cat.  So wait, the real Yuuta a.k.a Pine decided not to return to his real body and died, leaving Guriko alive right? Then the ghost Yuuta went back 25 years in the past and did the whole Fax thing right? Then he went back and possessed himself to start the whole time looping thing so the future would be peaceful did I understand that correctly? Does this mean that the premise of the peaceful future is the time loop? Also who was cat?   He's a cuck.    Or Tsubouchi.   There has to be a second season.     The fuck was the point of the cat?  The cat was the superior officer right? Being possessed. But then he talks like it's Tsubouchi Qmay.   What the hell?       Yes.  And the cat was a cat.       There has to be a second season.  There'll never be a second season, you're supposed to play the game if you want the rest.      triple zeros     But it's in Japanese. ;_;       Americans       well who was possessing cat?    THE CUTEST    The time lines are split into infinite realities. Every bad end was a different time line.  Yuuta chose the happy ending in the show, but didn't get the true end.     WILL THE GAME HAVE ENGLISH SUBTITLES?  ANSWER ME, /a/.     your mom    I'm a britbong.    Yes, we get the short end of the stick      Localization and dub   I wish        Not knowing moon already       We can't get all our answers, anon    I'm European, tho.    I'm not liking the 3d models.      I just want subs. ;_;   It wouldn't even take them long to implement it in the Japanese version.      Me neither. Though didn't they say that they wouldn't be the final ones? Hopefully?    Not even in VR? https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bmH<wbr>w0gW05Wc</wbr>  [ ]     In that case you'll never get it and will have to rely on the off chance that Xseed or Atlus brings it to murrika. Then you have to pray doubly hard none of the localization team finds anything problematic.    I hope you're not a Britbong calling yourself European, although technically correct due to geography, we never call ourselves European.    I'd like something similar to Danganronpa: Another Episode    The coronel was Qmay all along (notice him wanting to find Muhi). You need to remember Guriko liked to Qmay and thus, he didn't know Ws were completed (That's why he wanted the bear)    Nope, I'm Finnish.    We Euros got the SK franchise, and SV is way lewder than Punchline   Smiles were not protected. I didn't ask for this.  GOAT anime. I think so.  I'm glad it's over.   How did the smelly NEET even end up in that position?    They were happy   Reminder that Ito hasn't changed her panties in at least 10 days  Ten days    Fucking loved this show from start to finish. This is how I remembered good animu. Sadly it will do shit because Japan always has shit taste.   Okay, it was a fucking 10/10 on fire season 2 when?     Buy the game.   Meh 6/10 had some nice moments. Maybe the VN will be better   She's just has a lot of panties that are similar    Same here but I give it a 5/10.    I said season 2. who the fuck cares about shitty games, I want animation ANIMATION     How long did she wear the ones she gave as an offering?     Ichikawa: Flight Unit, who is well-known for their quality when it comes to 3D characters, is being tasked with those. However, the character models we have now are not the final versions. We plan to make better ones, so please look forward to them.     no yuuta harem end   2/10, would suggest it on MAL     Derischas    It will have a harem end in the game    They aren't animated yet    It won't be a VN, so it will be better for sure  can fly around the apartment and peek pantsu on your own      So tgeres still one thing I still dont get. Why does out of body Ubafying cause the asteroid to drop? Was there ever any explanation for this?    You should rewatch the whole thing if you didn't understand one of the most basic plot points.    the asteroid dropped because the asteroid dropped    No, when Yuta was a spirit, temporal physics don't apply to him so when he sees panties twice he gets unconscious and time jumps when the asteroid hit Earth    It doesn't, that was explained in the first fucking episode.  Yuta passes out, isn't able to save things, earth dies.      I'm I the only one who thinks girl Yuta is cute. Also what happened to the penis?    mfw also finished endless 8 today   One of those time loop days I guess     No penis. Only girls here.    The fuck are you smoking? The only one who has a dick is Guriko in Pine's body.    He wanted yuri-end, he's a fucking yurifag cancer.   Damn, it was weird as fuck seeing Churiko in her own body again, I could only imagine Yuuta. They should've made her breast bigger.   You're not watching. Fuck off    Watch/rewatch Madoka, Steins;Gate, and Space Dandy episode 10 while you're at it    BEST SHOW EVER!!!   btw what happened i didnt understand anything  New-neo-/a/      Not marathoning Endless 8  pleb     no overly long exposition spoonfeeding you the ending  Pretty unexpected, that's a surprisingly good finale for Uchikoshi. Maybe he's getting better at writing. Would be cool if he stops reusing time loop plot in every work, though.     It wouldn't be an Uchikoshi story without time shenanigans. That's only thing why I buy his stuff   That was fucking sick  The first few eps were pretty slow but it definitely made up for it, can't wait to rewatch     Rewatching makes the context different. It feels great.   Would you fuck mikatan in yuuta's body, or rather hers. Y/N?  So what was that exorcism at the end?   No, you thieving gaijin    Ya    Rabura is a trained exorcist, has been since the beginning. Qmay is an actual ghost, the evil spirit of a dead man. So she used whatever she knew and it worked for once.    Rabura is from a family of exorcists.      Qmay is an actual ghost, the evil spirit of a dead man  wait, when this was said exactly? wasn't his bearmigration possible only with technology?      It's explained in episode 7. It doesn't actually cause the asteroid to drop. Ghost Yuuta just passes out and wakes up after Guriko's keikaku succeeded   so anyone have any idea on what to do for the TRUE end  obvious shit would be to deal with that THE LIVING PLOT DEVICE bear    Damn it, I'm going to have to stop being lazy and learn japanese to read the true ending aren't I? I know the kana, and some words and grammar. But I keep slacking every time when it comes to grinding vocab and kanji.   Yeah, what did Qmay want to do with that bear    Qmay died in November, that was said in episode 3. So he spent a month living in people like Ito's teacher who he had a deal with.   So what was the punchline?   Teraoka told him that Muhi's ability was the key to becoming a W. Teraoka lied because he didn't like him but Qmay didn't know that.    some thing to regenerate the body of their old leader    Ah yeah, I forgot about that.   Anyone else think this was a pretty shit ending to an otherwise good show?  So is Pine in an infinite loop? Does she have to go back and keep reliving all this pain over and over again?  What a hard life.     No    Punchline is you sat through a shit show for 12 weeks.    No, it was pretty good. everything that doesn't go for the easiest happy everafter ending today is godsent    that you actually have to buy the game to get the real end    Why didn't you look at her punchline? now is too late   How to get true end is too predictable You can keep everything the same except you use muhi to make Pink become a W so the body doesn't die from yubafying    It's a different version of him each time, so it doesn't really matter    Too hard to explain; here a pic    W are immortal though. Living forever isn't good.    I felt it was a nice ending for a mediocre show, actually. Made sitting through the boring episodes in the middle worthwhile.    True end 1: pure love kinda yuri end with Yuuta and Mika   True end 2: shit goes south so Yuuta takes back his old body, uses the power of W to kick everyone's ass, and then achieves harem end.     Maybe I'm being paranoid, but does anyone else think pic related is suspicious? If aliens or something show up in the game, consider them called.   How do they even become W and why did they refuse to become W? Okay, they didn't want the world to end, but why not become a W if it's a straight-up power-up? Mikatan was dying and couldn't uberfy, so why not became a W and have her body healed?    Aliens appearing wouldn't be surprising.    AYE...   Is Teraoka X Mikatan considered yuri or hetero?   It's considered fuck you.    Yuri romance, het sex.    It would be region free, either way is fine.    *fuck /u/    it's considered never happening in a million years...    Futa    Good enough, I'll take it   She cut her hair. Maiden with a broken heart confirmed.     my actions has cost countless lives   I am going to atone for it by going on this peaceful hike through the countryside   The fuck Japan, why do you always do this shit?      RIP gay braid ;_;    Her life is ruined. She will have to become a fag if he wants to have sex with men.    I think Guriko is gonna try something to help the past yuta    I'm pretty sure a hike will do his mind good after literally a life of drugging and brainwashing and living in a crazy cult.   Fuck, that was great and that one anon wanting the silly dance got it too.   Guriko just didn't want to be alone ;_;   I just finished it. It was okay but the ending was a little weak in my opinion. With 999 and VLR the final twists are revealed at the end, things fall apart (or more accurately, are put in place) and there is an emotional climax. I think that Punch Line blew its load a little to early. All the twists were already revealed and the finale only served to move the plot towards the end, rather than have a revelationary aspect. It was too focused an the "action" part of the conflict. Also there was less tension in the climax than I think 999 had with the final sudoku puzzle. With the sudoku puzzle I felt that it tied everything together in a meaningful way that had a deep emotional payoff. Meanwhile, Punch Line ends with a mecha fight. Cool in its own right, but not having the same depth that I felt in this guys other works.  No evil Yuuta   True end is for the game, you dolt. Uchikoshi wrote this with being "animated" in mind.      I enjoyed the first episodes more.     I realize that, but I'm judging the anime based on it's own merits. I still liked it, but it was relatively weak.     didn't mean to quote    What if the game reveals that everything we thought we knew was true in the anime finale turns out to be a lie?   She did nothing wrong if you think about it. The Qmay group experimented on her all her life to know more about überfication, she just wanted her vengeance and she wanted to save Yuta and Mikatan because they were her friends why would she care about other people?     That'd be great.    Because his hair is short as an adult.   We still know nothing about the fucking cat. He got his name from Chiyoko, now what?   It's been a shitty 12 weeks. Welp, see you guys in 101 days, I guess.     play the game   Never watched the show but the girls seemed cute especially the reverse trap looking one. I am glad that fans of the show seem to have gotten an ending they are happy with.  I was hoping that they would accidentally all swap to their original bodies in the middle of the final fight and that Guriko would uberfy without knowing her body was at its limit and die as a result. The actual ending was really lackluster in comparison, just typical heroic sacrifice nonsense.   Accidentally swapping would be the dumbest "oh wow saved by coincidence" ending.    that'll happen in the game    Maybe in one of the bad endings. I don't think an antagonist dying by accident is a good idea.    1) Why trust Guriko 2) That would make G believe she's on the right side 3) Maybe they enjoy being somewhat normal 4) Precious time they could spend actually saving the planet        just typical heroic sacrifice nonsense.  In a sense it was also the opposite of that, since that's exactly what Teraoka was trying to do.    I did a lot of horrible things. Welp, guess I'll just sacrifice myself since I'm feeling kinda bad about it now.   nope   And then he had to actually deal with it instead of just getting the easy way out.         Will the true ending save all three of the lab children?  THEN WHO WAS CAT?   Cat was just ordinary cat.    A third Yuuta    Good People Die mate    8 days*    You're pretty much the worst type of person.    *9 Hours     But who was phone?    I dont know why people keep saying that Guriko is the bad guy when she is just lonely   the REAL bad guy is the other guy floating around without his body     no its avoidable    they give enough plot devices for it       The real antagonist is the asteroid.       the REAL bad guy is the other guy floating around without his body  He may have started all the bad shit, but at the moment of the story he's mostly a tool used by his own organization since he doesn't know that his primary objective has already been fulfilled.     It's a joke about Zero Esca...  whatever      Reincarnation of a Yuuta who dies. When he eventually becomes a spirit, he goes on to help the current spirit Yuuta. That's where that whole thing from Chiranosuke came from, where he said he hopes that they meet again somewhere, someday.    Asteroid did nothing wrong, it changed its course because of Qmay's hacking      that ending  It's a good ending I guess. The true ending is probably in the game.  Where he isn't fucked to do the the peaceful future loop forever.   I doubt it's coming to US though, not anytime soon if it does.       I don't want this show to end but I'm very satisfied with the ending. I haven't felt this way about a currently airing anime in a while.    That's great, the waifu age is almost here.     Mostly because it was a standalone end unlike adaptations    i want to pet a chiyoko    It was a nice breath of fresh air     Why were they even wearing panties here, I thought they offered them to Yuuta, or were they clean ones, which makes them a really rubbish offering.    I was so sort of disappointed not to see Yuuta power up by looking at panties during his fight with fake Pine (Guriko??).   They dont leave the house without panties They are proper ladies m8    Was this the punchline?   its qt and has a pussy why not      here      forehead  Fucking bullshit.    True end is going to involve going through more than two loops as long as we're playing as a single pine spirit.   The censored panty shots were great.   glad it was only that or else it would stir /u/    If you were actually expecting to get the true end I can understand how you would be disappointed, but that would make you a maximal autist.    BUY THE VN      Game for kiss in the lips. Still female body x female body.     That's the true body of the cat.    It's not a VN, they're going all out with gameplay and shit. Producer said they're betting everything on it, and if the game flops the entire team retires from video games forever.  RIP Uchikoshi       Game   Yuuta has achieved Paragon    new dialogue unlocked   managed to convince Guri-chan to stop his evil ways   with Guri-chan's help world is saved from the Qmay   Guri leaves because he doesn't want to be a 3rd wheel   Yuri-intensifies           I'll buy it. I don't even know runes but I'll buy it   Would Yuuta do his old body if they all managed to switch back?   even Rabura turned out to be useful  Damn, I totally didn't expect THAT    Yeah.    Yeah, mostly her type of character would be useless    Technically Guriko never killed anyone in this timeline.   Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed  http://www.zero-tsukaima.com/    How would they summon the spirit of the author?   Is the author coming back as a zombie?    BASED A S E D       Is MF Bunko that starved for ideas that they'd steal from the dead? This seems really iffy.  Not even death can stop shitty LNs from being produced it seems.   Tiffa will be fucking killed in your life time   FUCK YES    Reminder than translation never  Finally, besttsun returns!  Really? Who is gonna write that?  Should have just released author notes.   Novels from the hell.    Seems the editors.    Nah, it's the editor find a new author, just still don't know who he/she is.   It was shit but damn it is the definition of a guilty pleasure.  Really want them to have the series crossover with our world so they can travel between them. That would really refresh the series.   Also needs to Jam it Louise. She is craving his dick at this point.       He continues to live through his shit franchise that no one wants to admit to liking.   I could think of far worse fates.    I love ZnT and Louise though    I want to live    They're just finishing it, the last 2 volumes.  Tiffa will die, Louise will get it jammed and other things.     Zero no Tsukaima is a great series and everyone who "ironically" liked it instead of just outright liking it should stop being retarded.   2nd season has a special place in my heart as the final episode made me cry and feeling good.    Louise will get it jammed and other things.  She better. IIRC she is begging for it in LN at this point.        The second season's last episode's last 30 seconds are what made me drop the show. I did read the LNs after though, but all of that development right out the window in the last fucking 20 seconds of the show made me drop it on the spot.     last episode's last 30 seconds are what made me drop the show   Hilarious.     correct me if im wrong, but I only watched the anime. Does this mean that the next season will take place in the real world with louise and Saito? I wouldn't be surprised if their is some shitty excuse for the two to go back, like to fight some magical demon lord. They better not fuck this up, bringing back authors from the dead just for this.  louise is best girl!     I've done the same thing before, for other shows.  Also it's a shame they didn't adapt the war aftermath properly       next season  Anon, the anime was finished and will never get anything else.  this is for the novels.   I do wish we could get a Movie or something to adapt these two volumes, or an OVA or something.          Wait what? This is excellent news. One can only hope the notes left by the author will be enough to make a proper plot and Louise ending.   It'll still make you wonder what the author intended to do towards the end. This is just some random people trying to fit stuff together and make a different route albeit probably acceptable at least    Louise ending.   implying it will not be a Siesta ending      The editor probably knows the author's intentions so it should be fine. On the other hand, he could just say fuck it and tell the new writer to do something completely different.    That's the thing really, it's hard to consider this canon when the original author's six feet under.  My Opinion of course    I wonder how much they'll advertise this.  Would be stupid to just release with barely any advertisement. Maybe an OVA or something.    I SAY YES ZUTTO    病床のヤマグチ先生より完結までのプロットが遺されておりました。   Yamaguchi has finished to make the entire plot.      They're finishing the light novel?! How? And if I remember correctly, there was only a couple volumes left to write but remained unfinished due to the sudden passing. So the story was almost done.    Yes, author notes and editor will finish the novels. They will be releasing the last two volumes based on extensive notes left by the author in case he passed away. Seems like they are going to grant his wish of finishing his series rather than going full idiot and not doing it out of respect for the dead.      It sounds like the author and the family were all for it.    They also make sure to ask his family first.    Well, the last 30 seconds of season 2 is anime original   Saito is 'dead' for months in the LN and Louise tries to kill herself       Wedding version best version    Well let's hope the editor didn't find a lame author.    LNs are way fucking better, and now that they are getting finished the anime ending won't matter. Specially if the LN ends with them fucking like rabbits, Louise getting impregnated and then Saito showing Louise his world, home and family.     Yeah, I read the LNs after so I knew what was "supposed" to happen.  Maybe I'll go back and watch seasons three and four some day, but I really hated elf tits.     Thanks for the spoiler Anon.  No srsly Iam finally going to start reading the LN .    I don't really care if the LN is overall shit or not, I'm just glad the publisher want to respect the dead author by finishing it in his stead.    I watched all of the anime and loved it. S3 is definitely the weakest one but I still enjoyed it a lot.   I started watching anime because of this show.  I swear to God, if that maid cockblocks them AGAIN in the last chapter, I will go to hell and kill yamaguchi myself  That maid really needs to fuck off    Pure joy!  Concrete proof that Japan succeed to summon dead person's soul. They did it just for money. Truly evil... Evil... Absolutely evil...  I wonder how many orphaned children's blood they sacrificed for this depravity?     Bitch, i love the LN and best-tsun.   Last thing I remember from the LN is the mom chasing them down and them saying how fucked they were.   Keep in mind I'm not the biggest fan of this series but I would love to see the story finished. This better fucking end well!!    I think I remember mention of him leaving notes for his death.    Whose mom?    Anime is done, anon. This is only LN's. If they wanted to continue the anime they'd have to do even further original content.   Never forget    Summoning GARcher.   I guess she nailed it.      It's good, anon. You won't regret it.    Reminds me of that one Fate x ZnT fanfiction.   I'm still surprised that ZnT crossover fanfiction is still active until now       Louise's  IIRC there is a novel image of it but I can't remember the volume     I'm glad.   mfw we will never get more of Louise's mom adventures when she was hotter than Louise    I don't blame her. All she wanted was a decent familar and instead she got angsty asshole who wanted to kill his past self even though he knew 99% sure that it wouldnt undo his own shitty existance anyway.  I'd be unhappy too.      Everyone would get fucked from the get go if she had summoned Archer.   http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/?<wbr>title=Zero_no_Tsukaima  WILL WE EVER GET IT TRANSLATED THOUGH?  </wbr>   But there's no high-jump boy in Halkeginia. Also: summon servant's mind altering bind.    He'd get flustered and dere'd in 2 secs after forming the bond     Summon Archer   Every woman in their world panties flood wanting him     This is the news of the year.  The resurrection of Zero no Tsukaima is the best way to bid farewell to the author. His influential legacy will be eternal. Rest in peace.      flustered   GARcher vs RIEEEEEEEEEE   It'd be glorious.      Quick, who was more influential in the grand scheme of everything  Shakugan no Shana   or  Zero no Tsukaima  Quickly, respond!          What is it about Louise that makes her more likable than the other Rie Tsunderes not including Taiga?   The Era of Rie is long gone   I miss the days of constant bitching about hearing her.        It's not like I want to protect your adorable ass or anything.   I-it's not like I admire your coolness or anything!!!  ZnT: The Tsunderening     More perflat is always welcome   ZnT  I don't remember much about Shana as it didn't leave a lasting impression but I still remember ZnT crystal clear.     Anyone got the epubs/mobie/pdf. The links on BT are all dead.   ZnT thread  Obligatory  https://www.youtuberepeater.com/wat<wbr>ch?v=s0CuyZBaG90  Also DON'T FORGET TO PUT YOUR HEADPHONES  </wbr>      Someone needs to pick it back up, this should hopefully bring interest back into ot   If they go for a shitty tsundere end, here's a reminder it won't be canon since the author is dead.  Best mother   Read the thread Nigger.    It would beb based on author notes so canon.  Also Louise is love.     I wanted to fuck her bad. It would make her less bitchy.   Delicious loli-Karin    She definitely needed a healthy dose of Vitamin "D", stat.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_4Y<wbr>NB7azSBg</wbr>  [ ]   they summoned him as a counter guardian      I love Rie and wish we could usher in a new Rie era.  Also all Ries are love and life though      I don't see it being a tsun end, Louise is basically throwing herself on saito's duck the the previous 5 volumes, of only they weren't cockblocked by meido/elftits     new Rie era.  Well, we had Kagura, Black and Howaito this season.  HnA spinoff is coming soon too, she was in the expelled from paradise movie recently as well. Not good enough, but it's something.         Having to re-read everything again  Just fucking kill me     Gabe Blessing pretty much ensured it would never die after Hill of Swords.     I didn't care for his portrayal of Shirou. May as well have just slapped a fucking OC in there.    So ZnT x Fate is seriously a thing in fanfics?  I guess it ain't that much of a stretch with Summon Familiar.     Don't forget the robot.    Oh shit, you're right.  How did I forget her, she's so good.   The show is fucking atrocious though        Hidan No Aria was an underrated masterpiece.   Yeah I'm kind of blaming it for many edgy interpretation of Shirou in many crossover fics. I like his Louise development in that fic though    Did Lousie's mother ever appear in the anime?     So ZnT x Fate is seriously a thing in fanfics?  No, ZnT x ANYTHING is a thing because of Summon Servant.  Gabe's Fate cross is just what popularized it.       Wholeheartedly agree.  Honestly, it's a shame people don't like it more. Aria is fucking hilarious, cute and sexy.      Catches them making out in the boat    That problem isnt just related to gabe.  99% of Fate fics on FFN can be summed up as in name only and no matter how much they change thing he always has UBW at it's highest showing dispite how many things need to happen to create it.      Which season? Damn, I've forgot almost everything about this series.    2nd     He's dead. Louise a shit and didn't win. Deal with it.      being such an assblasted Siestafaggot     Louise has perfect genes. I hope she remains flat forever though.     I hope she remains flat forever though.  She will anon, she will if we all wish for it.      he doesn't like the worst tsundere ever made!   h-he must be an Xfag!  What are you going to do next, accuse me of being some made up bogeyman?      There's actually some pretty hilarious ones.   Louise starts summoning shit from Warhammer 40k   Louise summons Godzilla   Louise summons the Terminator         Oh man, I've read that the Godzilla one is hilarious.    I'm not that anon, but I'm gonna report you to moot    I think Murasaki Yukiya, Tsukasa, or Akira.    It didn't help that his fic after that was even worse in the portrayal. I didn't even finish it.    Also one of the recent one where she summoned a Gundam. Shame that it's probably under hiatus forever now    There's a guy on there called Neoalfa. His Shirou is the closest to Nasu's I've seen while being decently written.   Who is this perfection?    Louise summons a fucking Jaeger w/ Saito as the co-pilot.  Sadly its a one-shot.     The only non-shit Elf in the whole series   I don't even like Louise but I will admit she is better than the other tsunderes. Light novel better fucking end well.    Louise summons a Geth Platform   "This platform is the Juggernaut, female canine."     There's a guy on there called Neoalfa.  Path of the King is pretty great.          Hasn't updated his Dresden Files fic in 11 months   Gabe is kill       Stops at literally his best fic   Feels bad man.      I remember one with some horrible murica self insert who gassed the people of albion then set up a 'democracy' with only one political party which he was of course in charge of.  I laughed so hard i almost fell off my chair.     Great news, I just received my Louise figure and nendoroid in the mail too,  Thank you kamisama      Hot gue intesifies.     Finally! next one should be MM!, I hope so.    Congrats, looks great    Can't wait for Louise and her magical co in the modern world    A good one I've read had Louise summon Alex Mercer from Prototype, mindfuck and bloodbath ensues. It was a long time ago though, I should probably check for updates.     I couldn't blame him if he did    Wasn't there one where she summons Saitama from OPM?    It remind me that fanfiction were she summon a Necron lord.   She should summon  the EMPRAH    Never read that one, will look it up.     I laughed so hard    I'd love to see the day a ZnT thread doesn't turn into fanfic shit discussion.  Is there any other information other than they will finish the series?    I'll just leave this here  https://forums.spacebattles.com/thr<wbr>eads/zero-no-tsukaima-story-thread-<wbr>index-and-updates.229094/</wbr></wbr>      2016   Japan begins to resurrect LN authors to finish their works   One young and promising author is resurrected after he dies in a car accident but decides to stop writing and live out his life as a regular schoolboy   meets several beautiful girls and totally fails to realise that they want his   autograph  see it's all a set up for just another Shitty LN         Dat ZR using garter and dem details of her small delicious body  I want. That is one good and sexy fig.    New season when?   This. Let best girl win.    Sir, are you aware you have objectively shit taste?      I think you meant to quote a Louisefag.     Necron Lord thinks she's a C'tan   Louise cries herself to sleep thinking she's a world destroying monster         Non shit elf.    also a loli.   Welp that makes perfect sense to me guys.          She has shitty sleepy eyes though.    Jesus fucking Christ, thats a lot of volumes. No wonder the Light Novel outlived the author, holy shit. I want to read this but fuck all that overblown tsun in the earlier volumes, the cockblocking and harem status quo all spread out in 20 volumes and side stories of varied translation status.      Author will never finish the LN    Why live      It's worth it, I hope these news will revive the translation efforts. Specially since there's not much left.   Louise is great but goddamn is Saito an unfaithful cunt.   Pink hair is supreme.      Wants third worst girl to win  Fuck that.      JS06 S 0 6       Will the loli save us?    Not to throw you into despair, but ZnT really, really doesn't seem like it would be up js06's alley.     Louise will never sit on your dick, sliding her tight little vag all the way down on you      Louise summons the Terminator  Holy crackers the fanfics literally predicted Genisys.     But i can still fap to that mental image.      &gt;tfw ended up writing my own shitty summoning fanfic  I know some of you are also guilty of this, don't deny it.      The one where she summons the Skyrim player character is fun.       How many LN volumes did the Anime cover?   All of them, even to the unwritten ending.    You're telling me the new movie has a cute littel tsundere ojousan summon Terminator   Guess I'm reading the LN again.  But man did the 1 vs 70,000 sequence suck in the LN.    N-not exactly, just that the series is a prequel reboot with the T800 sent back in time to protect sarah. You can pretend its Louise with guns.     You can pretend its Louise with guns.  So, Aria?      tfw ended up writing my own shitty summoning fanfic  Haha, what a fucking autist!    I used to write mlp fanfiction and I don't really regret it. I still have a few fans that email me and tell me to write more.          mlp fanfiction  Reported      I don't really regret it.   Straight to the camps with you.        That's some great news.    Herald of the Void was a good read   I know nothing about this series apart from that the glasses girl has some great porn.    Shit taste.    I hated this show so much that I ended up loving it. I'm actually excited it's going to be finished.    Did they manage to gather the dragon balls?   I'm so happy that they're going to finish what he couldn't finish himself. I don't even care it it's shit, just knowing that it's finished will be fine.  Why.  Let it die like the cancer it is    Harem ending please  Where can I find the LNs in Japanese   maybe that actually happened and is part of the reason why EMIYA is such an ass   Why is louise the perfect semon demon?    the author died more than 2 years ago  Fuck, it feels like the sticky was only yesterday.     EVEN IN DEATH HE WRITES      Coming soon to a bookstore near you:  I Was A Light Novel Author Who Died Of A Myocardial Infarction Caused By Deep Vein Thrombosis From Sitting Still For Too Long While Writing My Works, But My Editor Who is Also My Younger Sister Resurrected Me To Finish My Most Popular Series.       Has LN names gotten too long?   I want more about the elves and the onee-sans, I don't really care about the rest of characters.   I feel the opposite.     Pretty soon they're going to stop writing the novels entirely and just sell the covers.     TIFFA GETTING KILLED SOON ALL ELFS GETTING BLOWN TO THE MOON WITH FREEDOM NUKES  BASED LN       They may as fucking well, with all the shit that sells based on it's art alone.     What    They should reboot the whole thing.   Pretty sure it has to be because she was a bitchy comic relief girl in season 1 of the anime, but by season 4, she was this clingy walking doormat that would let Saito fuck the maids just to stay around. Pretty drastic changes.  Also, the sexy pin ups help       mfw 5 seasons of well adapted ZnT   5 seasons of Rie   I only wish this and SnS could get a reboot and have more faithful adaptations        NUKES  Wait what? I haven't read this thing that far yet but what?     I'm just too distrustful to belive they want to respect the wish of the authour, I'd bet they only want to scratch some money and probably such notes he "trustued to his editor" doesn't probably exist at all.  I mean do you people read LN do you really belive these authors have notes about everything is going to happen till the end? If they struggle to end one fucking novel in time do you think they have 2 more plannead ahead?      It's certainly a possibility given how much this guy loved the novels. Also the fact that he could die means he must have left something.    Fire stones are big ass magical nukes if used right.    Are you this clueless?  Js06 translated Color Wars on a mere whim by flipping a coin when asking people on /a/ what LN he should translate next in a thread he made one to two years ago.  Among the LN choices posted, he ended up picking up Color Wars.        That's not too bad. IIRC the author of Guin Saga died leaving the series unfinished as well, so they did the same there. The famous Wheel of Life series was also completed after the author's death.    Most don't under normal circumstances, sure. But the series was supposed to be close to being finished, and the author knew he was dying. Those are the sort of circumstances in which they can set the plot in stone, figure out the key details, maybe write the the scenes they feel the most critical, and then when they die there's enough information on what is supposed to happen, and what happens to who, for any halfway competent author to wrap up the series.   I might have to reread the series again since remember jack shit about it, other than fapping an unhealty ammount to Louise   /a/ suddenly likes ZnT  What happened?    Where's Angela? She's voiced by the Rie and a tsundere, she totally counts.    The LN was ridiculously popular. Think mahouka levels.   Dont forget crazy shit like a crossover with sengoku rance.  Light novel series Zero no Tsukaima will be continued after author Noboru Yamaguchi's death. The last volume released was the 20th out of 22 on February 2011.  Before he passed away, Yamaguchi told his editors the remaining plot and ending and entrusted the series to them on his sickbed. His family also desires to see a continuation along with many requests from the fans.  Source: http://blog.esuteru.com/archives/82<wbr>30152.html</wbr>       The maid has fucked off. She and Louise reached an agreement in the LN. Now Louise just needs to shoo off all the other harem orbitors.    I'm pretty sure it was always fairly liked, not that we don't lik to point out it's numerous flaws or anything, b-baka!     LN getting finished  Fuck year. I never dreamed this would happened. My body is ready.  Louise is mai waifu. Please no touch.        More elves   Also can Overlap do the same thing with Infinite Stratos? I know Yumizuru isn't dead, but the series is pretty much dead in the water with him at the helm and literally anyone pulled off the streets could write better than him. The fucker likes using "ちなみに" too much, it's aggravating to read.      Would there be an improvement in the characters personalities?    Let IS die please     Zero no Tsukaima LN Continuation Confirmed   AH FUCK SHIT NIGGA, BEST NEWS OF THE YEAR      Can we have a lewd tread like in the old times?     Let IS die please  But they are doing so great    I hope this gives us more Louise doujins   This nigga knows what's up      Dude what the fuck.    Great quality in the water part    The LN's already killed it and the anime already butchered the source material and characters. What more do you want?   I want to masturbate by rubbing my penis on the soft inner walls of Louise's vagina   For it to stay dead and for its merchandise to stop clogging shelves    Okay, now they're just getting silly. How long before they start lifting stuff straight out of bond movies?   So i heard that the stupid dog dies and becomes a lich.   Does anyone have that lewd image of louise on a couch with the thumbnail magic?   Who NTRietta here?   No magic though    A shit.    /r/ing Rie the Man and Sugita the Bald photo. You must have seen that one.    FUCK OFF    Lovely    NTR queen is pretty fun though    I remember when Spacebattles went member only traffic because of the huge influx of users. Good times.     the author of Guin Saga died leaving the series unfinished as well  She didn't, the main story was finished, the books she was currently writing were side-stories.    Perfection.  Do you guys think we'll get an OVA or something maybe?     Holy shit the author came back to life?  Does MM! still have a chance?      I think they sealed the casket with that last season. They played the 1st season Op and everything.   I don't understand why you guys want Tiffa dead  ITT: Main girls who are also best girls  Obviously.    In celebration.     hahahaha, fuck no.    She's a tsundere, that's literally everything I need to know to decide she's worst girl.     Ellen   best anything  You'd have to remove pretty much every other girl for that to happen.

I want to marry Yukina and have her birth me a daughter.   She hardly has competition.  Mai waifu related.    Well I like Nora the most but I know I'm pretty much alone on that. So I try to keep that to myself as much as possible.      Kazusa a shit. Setsuna did nothing wrong.    99% of them. Side character girls are always just fluff shit that people with terrible taste want   yes, a blonde and a bitch from the initial town...  but talking about the anime world, she don't      Wrong.      I thought the reflection wasn't opening her mouth, but grimacing. Reflecting (c wat i did thar?) her innermost feelings that she refuses to show.    Setsuna is a literal cuck.          Reminder that loli Misaki was best Misaki and best loli.    who needs competition when she's already best girl.    Steph &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shitty loli   obvious choice, you're a faggot if you say otherwise    Service Club Edition   Yui knows about Yukino's feelings   Yukino knows about Yui's feelings   8man knows about their feelings   Where do we go from here?        What do yukinos feet taste like? She wears thigh highs all day but she must bathe in the finest of rich people soaps.   Is "here's your reply" the new "who ye quoting?"  I like it        literally one minute apart  Seems suspicious.      did we watch the same episode&gt;?      Delusionfags     New Famitsu scans of Steins;Gate 0. 30% done. Release date is November 19  Science Adventure thread, I guess.      No, there will never be a sciADV on PC ever again.    Not just that, Mayuri's design is literally because she's a kindergarten teacher in Antimatter. She isn't in Zero.    Vita TV is literally $40 half the time, there's no excuse for missing out on these VNs     What if Kurisu was lying about her past, Nakabachi was delusional, and Kagari actually IS Kurisu.     How about Nintendo wii version?   Why does /a/ hate Miyazaki again? Clearly he's a genuinely good guy.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PGi<wbr>yDw3dOSs</wbr>  [ ]  Boruto  - Rasengan and Rasenshuriken - Chidori and other lightning based jutsu - Rasengan/Chidori Mix - Multi Shadow Clone - Snake Summoning - Snake based Jutsu like the shed skin - Toad Summoning - Sage Mode  Sarada   <span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127178584#p127178584">Click here</a> to view the full text.                   fuck off already  Boruto will be trained by a genius who also is basically a god, on the other hand Sarada will be trained by Sakura who is a great ninja (especially considering that she's a nobody) but she can't compare with Sasuke. Masters matter a lot in this manga so Boruto will win imo   But most of Sasuke's power comes from Sharingan and Hagoromo power up which Boruto won't get. He can't even train him to be as fast Lee because again you need Sharingan for that.    Sure but Sasuke is also a Raiton expert, he learned Chidori at 12 and apparently knows very well how the Rasenshuriken works.    Yeah, but Nardo combined rasengan with fire, magnet, ink, black fire, water, lava and yinyang. I'm sure Bordo can combine lightning with rasengan   Summary anon delivers  Previous thread  just 5-8% remaining of chapter 5 and epilogue.  Neorigami best girl, Phantom best mom (?).       I wish she was around more   Did we finish up for today?   TL seems to be slow today, he's probably just busy doing things.   I know you're masturbating, stop that and keep TLing       I try to finish each girl's part in one go this time. That's why it's taking longer.    No worries    Trapped inside SAO and nearly dies   Trapped inside ALO and also raped   Not traumatized   goes back into same game ALO like it's no big deal  what       Kawahara decided to make "willpower shenanigans" canon in this arc. Given enough imagination, and self-delusion, you can overwrite certain aspects of the world around you in UnderWorld. The more powerful NPCs use this to basically use the force, and to "unlock" the hidden power in their weapons, like Bankai.  Sinon and Gabriel basically turn their weapons into guns, and start having a fight like that.  When the author got around to writing Accel World, he went ahead and included the concept, even with the same name ("Incarnate System")         when this shit gets animated you will be able to smell chinesse and korean butthurt over the world     stronger than Kirito   anime still tries to make it look like Kirito would've won  Fuck, at least let the AIDS chick who spent her entire time in the game beat your Gary Stu, she's going to die anyway, fuck.      What did the NSA go and hire mercenaries for? Why not just phone their buddies in the US Army and send some Navy SEALs to do the job?     Japanese government project to build UAVs piloted by disposable souls of babies cloned in an illegal medical procedure.  Wait, what? Is this story still about playing VR MMORPGs?  </blockquote>]
