It takes a few weeks tops. Is advice like this aimed at weaboos taking college Japanese classes?</br>  <br>Even that's overkill. I've just been watching anime for a solid 7 hours a day minimum for the past 10 years and now I can almost understand anything that's spoken. Plus writing makes sense when you understand the spoken language and everything just falls into place.<br><br>Honestly, the best advice I can give to anyone is to just watch alot of anime. Kids learn in a very similar way, so so can you!</br></br></br>  What happened to the old guide...? I don't understand how this new thing works.  Is there another VN as easy as hanahira? It was really good and useful but i'm finished with it  <br> I've just been watching anime for a solid 7 hours a day minimum for the past 10 years  <br>Holy shit are you me? I even wrote down words I learned while watching anime!</br></br>  <br>Why do you post this like it's epic? Radicals you may as well learn. Plugged into anki only took me a few weeks. It hasn't really helped me with kanji recognition but its still knowledge.<br><br>You don't magically learn kanji any other way than reading.

Watching nico is even better than watching anime, because it's real people.</br>  <br>I was trying to view some of the azw3 light novels from the CoR in my web browser without success so decided to convert them to a format both readable and with selectable text instead of static images of the other light novels. This is an example using the [アサウラ] デスニードラウンド　ラウンド1.azw3 file<br>https://mega.nz/#!3xVTiBzA!w29rLgfo<wbr>A88k-p3ZRGtI6lbxiXVrCYz6aqWgAPRTsMs<wbr><br>Would anyone else be interested in using these? <br><br>Here is the full list of files from the CoR azw3 folder at the top of the light novel section<br>http://pastebin.com/8jiWyaSX<br><br>Sorry if this has already been done/isn't necessary.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  宿題、手伝ってくれない?<br>Could you help me with my homework?<br><br>Is this really an accurate translation?</br></br></br>  <br>Stuff it, I'll post the link to the folder they are all going to end up in. <br>https://mega.nz/#F!e49TFahC!vIEZQHj<wbr>uvkKkFmLz3g63sg<br>330 books are being converted and should start to populate the above folder in a few hours but I won't be in the thread to post the link by that point. <br><br><br>More of a "Can't you help me do my homework?"</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>That's what I thought too. Thanks.</br>  <br>Also note that it isn't exactly a polite way to suggest someone comply, in that context. Not something which would be addressed to a teacher or someone in a higher position than the speaker, like a senior or something. That is, it is rather familiar. <br><br>My bad if that sounded patronising or anything.</br></br></br>  <br>No worries.

If you don't go that you just have to change I guess.</br>  <br>I try to.<br>I have a postitive outlook but man it all looks so bleak. I get my Japanese in and I know I am going to learn it one day but fuck man, the cards are stacked against me. Its sad how life is to nearly everyone. Perception is truly everything. I just want t drink my life away but that doesnt help with Japanese. I hate everyone yet I love everyone.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for this I will be downloading when you're done. Can you repost the link when its all completed</br>  <br><br>This is important. Also realize liking yourself is not such a black and white thing. Everyone has faults, but everyone also has their own strengths . If life has you down, focus on the things good and remember that the bad can change.</br></br>  <br>I would suggest working out and spending your time doing what you enjoy. After I began with that my life has been great.</br>  <br>It really is true anon. I am afraid of a lot of things right now especially my health but ive already posted my lifestory here.

Can confirm.</br>  <br>Ah so it involves health. That can be especially difficult sometimes. I don't have much going, but I feel I know what you are talking about to an lesser extent. <br><br>For as long as I can remember, academically my shit has been all over the place. I went to school in a pretty affluent area, so the both the quality of education and the academic standards were at a higher bar. I was bright enough to keep up, but for some reason I just couldn't be responsible. I'm not sure when, but there was a point when I just got sick of myself, so I tried to actively change. <br><br>Years later here I am. I'm still not the best I believe I can be , but I'm at least sitting on a 3.07 gpa, which is just above the required 3.00 gpa to study abroad in Japan for a year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finland or German?<br><br>You're a real go getter if you;re up now.

My skill improvement once I started reading went up so drastically.<br>How long have you been studying?</br></br>  <br>I try to get some reading it, mostly some VN.

Still in beginner land though.</br>  <br>It happens.<br>I'm only a year in but I notice drastic improvement.

They are on the CoR on the 教本 sheet under 暗記:<br> Tae Kim Vocabulary <br>Uses the actual sentences the vocabulary terms come from, in order of appearance.<br> Core 2k/6k Tae Kim Vocabulary <br>Uses the Core2k/6k deck, reordered for the vocabulary used in Tae Kim's grammar guide, by order of appearance. <br><br><br>I am that person. I'm not after html files because they are secondary and do not display exactly the same across all browsers and pdf readers. Forgot to add that I wasn't after html folders for each book but a singular cross compatible file, aka a pdf. In retrospect this should have been added to the post. My mistake, sorry about the confusion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How many individual kanji are in the Core 2k/6k deck? I'm 48% through it at the moment after a few months and found that I could recognise about 600-800 of the kyouiku kanji upon a quick scroll through a list of them -- how many different kanji (from the deck only) will I be able to recognise after finishing the whole thing?  <br>Running the example sentences through Jparser provided this<br>http://pastebin.com/JkBMpN1h<br>First column is number of appearances. A fair few with less than five appearances.</br></br></br>  <br>That's... pretty damn neat. Thanks.<br><br>It's only slightly more than I expected. I was assuming all kyouiku kanji would be in there, but not all jouyou kanji. 1650 is a very decent amount.</br></br></br>  <br>Not all kanji in example sentences are used in the new words, and I doubt that he will be able to recognize kanji he only saw in example sentences. Using kanji grid and limiting it to Japanese word field gives 1597 unique kanji.</br>  <br> Not all kanji in example sentences are used in the new words <br>That seems like an oversight by iKnow. Oh well, get what you pay for and all.</br></br>  <br>Well, this is how my cards look, so the example sentences are still going a good deal of teaching.<br><br>1597 in the word field is still excellent, though.</br></br></br>  <br>If you replace the example sentence field with {{furigana:[whatever your field name is]}} those kana in brackets should be displayed as furigana, if you like.</br>  <br>For furigana use {{furigana:your_name_of_field with _furigana}} like {{furigana:Notes-Kanjified-vocab Reading}}</br>  <br>I know, but at that font size the furigana is too awkward to read (my monitor is 72dpi) and I don't want to increase the font size as the purpose is to replicate regular text kanji as seen online and shit.</br>  <br><br>振仮名脳</br></br>  <br>Well, um, fair enough.</br>  <br>Supposedly you shouldn't use sentence on the front as sometimes you will connect meaning and reading to the sentence instead of to the word and then you'll be fucked when this word is used in a different sentence.</br>  <br>This can be true, yes. It's important to check whether front-side sentences are damaging your recognition skills.</br>  <br><br>install Meiryo<br>Heck, should be part of your computer if it's vista or win7</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't actually read the sentence the vast majority of the time. I have it there, well, as an option, but also because the word in the reading is often a different tense to the word up top, so glancing just at the bolded part of the sentence and also at the word gives me 2 different tenses of the word, which I find is pretty helpful.</br>  <br>Oh, and I don't use the audio from the example sentence there.</br>  <br>The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said. It isn't an issue if Anki is used as a revising tool, not a learning tool, and the person reads outside of Anki. <br><br>The consensus flips back and forth amongst online learners yet at the end of the day the most effective tool for language acquisition is comprehensive input, and lots of it. Anki should really be the smallest fraction of exposure to the target language a learner receives. <br><br><br>明朝体 is the most commonly used in print media, as it is an actual standardised font, so really for the best means of getting used to the most commonly used fonts, a 明朝 based font would have the widest recognition application.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I recommend meiryo because it's the most legible at low text sizes<br><br>You need to be reading outside of Anki anyways and nearly everything out there uses a mincho font, yes, this means that what you use in Anki doesn't matter because you're familiarizing yourself with the fonts outside of it.<br><br>For what it's worth when I still used Anki I had everything be meiryo except for a very large (&gt;=64px) gothic version of the vocabulary item on the front.

I mean, how many time do you dedicate to kanji, grammar and vocab? Maybe on Mondays you do kanji, then grammar, then vocab and so on?  <br>As many time as I have in my pocket. These pockets can hold dozens of time.</br>  <br>You cover all 3 by reading.</br>  Okay, I know there are lots of resources for studying, but how does one go about actually learning once past the kana level?  <br>By reading the Guide.</br>  <br>Tae Kim.

If there are words which don't stick they aren't priority. There is no point in trying to learn words you aren't coming across in native media.

Anki is useful for acquiring rarely seen (1-2 times per year) vocabulary. Yeah, you could learn it like Nips do, over 20 years of life, but some people want to be fluent as quick as possible.<br><br> If there are words which don't stick they aren't priority. <br>They ARE a priority if you want to become fluent in less than 20 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said. It isn't an issue if Anki is used as a revising tool, not a learning tool, and the person reads outside of Anki. <br><br>Even were you correct, it would still be very detrimental to have sentence on front when it comes to very rarely seen vocab. You would see the word almost only in anki and still connect the meaning to the example sentence.<br><br>Also, nice ad hominem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said. <br>Yeah, sure. That's why I can read.</br></br>   DJT in action   <br>たとう</br>  <br> Do you plan on using a texthooker most of your life? <br>I don't use a texthooker.<br>How the fuck do you think people have been able to reach fluency in the past? <br> Anki is useful for acquiring rarely seen (1-2 times per year) vocabulary. <br>Vocabulary isn't "acquired" in Anki; it is "acquired" through a process of massive exposure and encountering the word used in a wide variety of contexts. Unless your card for the word has dozens of example sentences you aren't "acquiring" shit. <br> but some people want to be fluent as quick as possible. <br>1. language isn't something you can rush. It simply doesn't work like that, like it or not. <br>2. The only way to speed up the process if the physical increase in time spent with comprehensive input. Reading for hours and hours a day, looking up unknown words and structures, is going to be vastly more efficient than using Anki, because it means you will have to be reviewing hundreds of new words every day. <br>3. People concerned about trying to learn Japanese as fast as possible don't waste time on anonymous image boards. They are the people too busy studying and reading as much as they possibly can. There are a few language learning schools, which are under the radar due to legality, which hammer the language into poor immigrants who need to learn the language as quickly as they can in order to get a job and survive in Japan, as their current living conditions are unsustainable.<br><br><br> Even were you correct, it would still be very detrimental to have sentence on front when it comes to very rarely seen vocab. <br>That's nice. Anything data supporting this? So far the data supporting reading=learning more words is outstanding to the point which makes the anki format entirely irrelevant. <br>Also keep in mind that DJT's champion Steven Kaufman has stated that on the occasions that he has used Anki his cards have EVERYTHING on the front. Seems to work pretty well with him, no?<br> Also, nice ad hominem. <br>Not how an hom. functions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not how an hom. functions. <br>/int/fag detected</br></br>  Well, I came here for a Japanese discussion, but it seems there's an argument going on as per normal.<br><br>In any case, has anyone else experienced the phenomenon of forgetting "basic shit" because it's, paradoxically, so uncommon? Like "cat" being a basic word, but forgetting it because you read a VN and it never comes up a single time. For me, it was the word 習う. I heard someone say it and I didn't recognize it so I looked it up and poof, it's a basic-ass word I already knew but just forgot. Like, what the fuck? I'm thinking back and I haven't seen the word in the past 5~ hours of this book I'm reading. It's weird for a common word to coincidentally not appear. Any thoughts on this phenomenon?</br></br>  <br>Acquiring as in memorising. And don't tell me you need hundreds of contexts for 'beige'</br>  <br>This was in the Feedback section on the website and on the off chance that the anon who posted this<br> 30/06/2015 22:11:18 Can you fix the css on the pages show they correctly show the links I have and have not clicked. Makes it easier to keep &gt;track of what I've already downloaded  <br>reads this thread, I have a solution for them. <br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/1B4lUu6eURfU0KPmZbysJcfrKbRc2r9<wbr>bBpll_F07EdOA/edit?usp=sharing<br>Download a local copy of the spreadsheet, as above, and use the links from there to keep track of what you are downloading.</br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  Here's an interesting question for you guys: <br><br>So my countries Japanese embassy has a job opening that doesn't require Japanese language knowledge, but still considers it a buff. Other than saying I have an n4, I'd like to get across that I can speak basic japjap by starting my cover letter with a greeting in jap. I was thinking something basic like "今日は マクーさん” <br><br>Will that be enough or is there something I can break out that'll really impress them? Anybody have any experience applying for something similar?</br></br></br></br>  How important is listening practice in developing an intuitive understanding of the language?<br><br>I've done a lot of reading practice, but my Japanese still feels really robotic. If there's any kind of slang or a dialect slightly changing a common conjugation (たん instead of の) then it throws me for a loop and I can't intuitively pick up on what obviously should have been there because I don't have a feel for the flow of sentences. I've just become pretty good at robotically piecing them together.<br><br>Will this improve with more reading or does an intuitive understanding of the language come mostly from listening practice?</br></br></br></br>  <br> And don't tell me you need hundreds of contexts for 'beige' <br>You do to really come to terms with the different ways people use it and don't use it, naturally. Chances are you have come across several thousand different contexts for the usage of 'beige' in English.<br><br>You don't seem to have any real idea just how many thousands of times in thousands of different ways we come across common words in English.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well for one, don't write こんにちは in kanji。And that's probably not the appropriate greeting anyway, it's too casual. You are applying to these people for a job, I think some keigo would be in order.</br>  <br> Seems to work pretty well with him, no? <br>He never became fully fluent. <br><br> Not how an hom. functions. <br>"An ad hominem (...) means responding to arguments by attacking a person's character, rather than to the content of their arguments."<br> The people who suppose that are beginners themselves who are mimicking things other beginners have said. <br>The above falls nicely into the definition. Instead of refuting what the anon said you just try to ridicule him to make his statement look false.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey djt, can you do me a rock solid? I'm going on an impromptu, strong-armed vacation for 10 days starting tomorrow and I do not have any new cards in anki lined up. Usually I mine what I read and do them on that day. However, now I need 10 days worth of cards and I simply do not have that many.<br><br>Therefore: Can anyone do me a rock solid and paste some words from their mining deck? I will in turn mine those and save a lot of time. I would appreciate this greatly.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I thought it was too informal. Just not sure what's appropriate for this scenario</br>  <br>Give me even 5 different usages of 'beige'.  Also I just realised that my example is pretty bad, because it also means "A soft fabric of undyed, unbleached wool" </br>  <br> is there something I can break out that'll really impress them? <br>Converse with your prospective employers in Japanese. They will be impressed if they think you are a native or part Japanese only to find out you aren't. <br><br><br> He never became fully fluent.  <br>Buzzword. <br> instead of refuting what the anon said <br>You don't get it, do you? Anon made a statement without any supporting reason or evidence. It was opinion and conjecture; I provided my own opinion and conjecture based on observations. There hasn't been anything stated which has been founded by anything in order to be able to refute. The quote you quoted is also wrong. An ad hom. is when the argument is taken to the person and the personal attributes of the person are used as a form of evidence to form an opinion. An insult or comment about the attitudes of people isn't an ad hom. <br><br>Since you are so inclined to suddenly want for reference, how about sharing the full citation and source of that quote?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My advise is: Keep in mind, you know some Japanese but you do not know Japanese. I mean. Trying to produce when it's far above your level (no offense) is just going to embarrass you. At one point, you WILL be confident in yourself and will be able to shit out greetings like no tomorrow. At THAT point, produce on your letter or whatever.</br></br>  I'm curious, what's "optimized" about the core 2k/6k Anki deck?  <br>It introduces words in such a way that you learn kanji more optimally and build upon existing knowledge.</br>  <br>So you're saying for now I should just write a normal letter? I get i'm still a newb and I wouldn't want to embarrass myself</br>  <br>Probably a bad idea. Managing a greeting in a cover letter isn't going to impress anyone anyway. It just leaves you open to looking stupid later. Just say that you know some basic Japanese somewhere in the letter.<br><br>But if you're feeling really into it: http://en.bab.la/phrases/applicatio<wbr>n/cover-letter/english-japanese/<br><br>I've been writing Japanese cover letters recently. It's pretty soul destroying. Not recommended if you can get away with doing it in English.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I won't risk embarrassing myself, I guess it's enough to mention my knowledge and experiences in Japan. Ty for the link though, interesting stuff</br>  <br> Give me even 5 different usages of 'beige' <br>http://pastebin.com/TAkztDt9</br></br>  <br>You can always include that you know some elementary Japanese and are studying it.</br>  Which Anki deck will be best for very basic beginners?  <br>The fact that other people use fallacies doesn't mean that you are suddenly allowed to do so.<br><br> full citation and source of that quote <br>Boku no google it faggot.<br>Jokes aside it was Wikipedia. This sentence even has references, so end your armchair logic expert act.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They all mean the same " A light grayish brown or yellowish brown to grayish yellow."</br>  <br> not 此処である <br>I'm disappointed toughest VN ever.</br></br>  REVOLUTION SOON  So where do you guys think Reiji went?

The only thing interactions he's really shown is:<br><br> Believing Yuzu to be Ruri and immediately getting gut punched <br> Protecting Serena solely because she protected him <br> Listening to Serena because she said Ruri was likely safe <br><br>Otherwise he gives no crap about the other Ruris, only his Ruri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  PROTECT ALL RURIS  <br>Yeah, as a card, in her deck. <br><br> He's not her ace </br></br></br>   tfw manlet bird boy doesn't let you break out of jail to find your waifu   YAMEROOOOO    You will never stop Fusion Shun, never.  <br>Don't know but he needs some screen time I need more DDD's.</br>  <br>He'll beat Jack and become Kingu himself and recruit him into the Lancers so he's around all the time.</br>   the real reason Shun learned how to ride a d-wheel   <br>You forgot<br> Went out of his way to watch Yuzu vs Masumi, despite not playing spectator to any other duel during the tournament. </br></br>  D-hhwheel.  <br>Back on Standard watching Netflix.</br>  i've seen a kurosaki win against you before<br>no matter how cute you are this time around i'll be rooting for it to happen again</br>  <br>Planning a new prank for Sawatari in his Synchro Neet Cave</br>  Honestly I want more Yuya thirsty scenes than Shun's Give back Ruri scenes.

There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect</br></br>  <br>Does that mean his friends will eventually act like little fuckers towards him, except Gon who will be the Sho at this situation where he forgives Yuya?</br>  <br>Thats if they were involved in any way of the escape plan, so that's why Yuya waned to escape without telling them</br>  <br>this episode has made me homosexual for shun</br>  <br> There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect <br>Have you seen literally any of the fusion related they've made in the last 3 years? Fuck, that would have been broken when Heroes were the only good fusion deck<br><br><br>They didnt say that, they said that those left behind would take the punishment. They knew who knew who, do you think they'd care about how much involvement they had?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon.<br>Shit was so hype.</br></br>  <br>Fusion Advantage<br>(This card's name is always treated as Polymerization.) Draw 1 for every fusion material used in a fusion summon with this card yadda yadda you guys fucking get it once per turn and all that shit<br><br>Fluffals would love it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HE DID IT<br>HE WON<br>BASED <br><br>man same here, that was almost ichigo vs byakuya levels of hype</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome the club.</br>  <br>At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. At best, others like Gon and Dennis notice that something's up and are actually helpful.<br><br>Judai's friends excluding Jim and O'Brien directed all their frustration and blame at Judai for how they ended up while not really trying to help the situation themselves because of the marks.</br></br></br>  <br>What I wouldn't give to watch Shun vs Sora again for the first time<br>And you don't even have to wait for the tracks to be released, you fucking prick.</br></br>  We all know Yuya vs Yuri will be the hypest duel  <br> At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. <br> tfw nobody knows you're the main character </br></br>  <br>Damn Serena looks big</br>  <br> for you </br>  <br> tfw when I first saw this on the preview I thought she would hug him </br>  <br>Is that a bad thing? In-universe, Yuya's treated as another member of the group like all the others, rather than being the leader with hanger-ons clinging to his heels, and we all know how the latter situation ended up for Judai. For once the rival is the leader (or he's supposed to be).</br>  Guys who says this?   HANASE HANASE    <br>No, it isn't. It's one of the things I liked when I started watching Arc-V, it isn't all about Yuya.<br><br>but it's still sad for poor little tomato</br></br></br>  <br>At this point of time Yuya has the least screen time out of the protagonists, shame since he's my favourite</br>  <br> Summon Blazeman <br> Add this <br> Activate to fuse Blazeman on field and Shadow Mist in hand <br> Draw 2, add a hero with shadow mist effect and make Nova Master or whatever <br>This card is awfully designed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yoshida will come back and restore the peace  </br>  oh shit what yuto vs sora<br>based shun surpassed my expectations, now i just have to count on yuto not jobbing<br>also damn if i didn't expect sora being evil-ish</br></br>  <br>Wait until Violet Flash is an official card since it helps fusion decks reclaim the lost advantage by drawing for each time you fuse alongside the fact that it makes activating fusion/Poly unrespondable to.</br>  <br> Rampant capitalization <br> Bleach </br></br>  <br>I had forgotten about Violet Flash. Yuri can't get an on screen duel fast enough.</br>  <br> Sora was gonna job. He gets his non-jobbing injections later. </br>  <br>I like Bleach too but don't make yourself look like a fucking retard. This is still /a/ we are on, not /dng/.</br>  <br> not /dng/. <br><br>Thank Ra.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's alright as it is, and I like the kid too. Past Yugioh series could occasionally get annoying about MC doing everything of importance.</br>  <br>GX was very bad about that and nobody will ever surpass the amount of duels Judai had, though I liked Judai, but maybe because the abridged shit gave me a view of him just rapping constantly which somehow fits...</br>  <br>i think one of the reasons why he's so good is because he has such little screentime and the people/relationships around him are fleshed out so well<br><br>i don't spend much time on this board but i guess bleach is one of those triggers on here, i'll shut up about it</br></br></br>  <br>Because Judai actually dueled a rapper in the dub and always talked like he came out of the 90's. I like how his deck now outshines Yusei's in getting out fusions over those synchros.</br>  <br>That's a good thing. Most side characters are treated well in Arc-V. It isn't all about Yuya and that's a thing it has over past series.</br>  Remember when people thought we'd never see Mieru again after her duel or have her cards ever released because it was flip and ritual based?

Shun has heard the accusation and is advancing on your position. What do you do to prepare?  Can't decide which not-yuya is my favorite, Banana, Tomato, eggplant, ...whatever vegetable/fruit Yuri is.<br><br>still I want Sora to show up again love that guy</br></br>  <br>Buy Raid Raptors and hope I have enough to appease him.</br>  <br>It's called writing a decent main cast</br>  <br>shove him straight into a set of pic related</br>  <br>Prepare Super Poly.</br>  <br>Gekidan Niagara</br>  <br>Yuri is either a Dragon Fruit for the pun or a Plum.</br>  <br>Watch his deck crumble because I don't special summon.</br>  <br>I prepare my  anus </br>  <br>I SUMMON MYSELF<br> steps forward </br></br>  <br>BUY FLUFFALS!</br>  Are Prophecy really so shit they can't hurt anybody? Because I like spellcasters and this is an xyz focused deck.  <br>You can probably fine tune it, but for the most part yes, Prophecy is shit.</br>  <br>They are? I remember people bitching about how broken they were. What happened. flat out outclassed by later sets or ban listed fucked them up good?</br>  <br>Isn't that banned though?</br>    <br>Banlist happened</br>  <br>Miami is in America ;)</br>  <br>And now, the only way they'll be back is if the power gap grows enough to make them a non-threat, their banned cards get an errata that shits all over them or Konami prints more xyz monsters for them like a rank 4 and 3. Sadly, there are no more of the arcana to adapt so they fucked up the ying yang.</br>  <br>This is maiami city tho ;)</br>  <br>We wont be seeing them again unless they start fucking with the power gap too much with Pendulum, which is a possibility, but I doubt it, since it seems they're making efforts to have all the summoning methods relatively balanced as best they can.</br>  <br>Cept fusion, synchro and ritual need a really big fucking buff to keep up with xyz and pendulum.</br>  Xyz is too weak right now it needs This card printed.  <br>Well fusion looks like it's starting to get individualized cards for everything. Ritual they almost never pay attention to outside of Black Luster and Nekroz, and Synchro, Synchro just needs better effects I think. <br><br>By next year I expect due to Pendulum and all the Rank 4 Xyzs that a lot of cards are going to get banned due to dumbass combos. <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if the next summoning method will be like Pendulum Xyz/Synchro/Fusion where we'll get Synchro/Xyz and stuff like Synchros with Overlay Unit effects and all sorts of things. Could be neat.</br></br></br></br></br>  1 week and 4 days until KINGU.  <br>Chojiro will become a Cardian himself in a way  once he gets carded </br>  <br>Bad Shun, bad!</br>  <br>I mean, it's neat to see an ossan be part of the group, even if briefly, but at the same time it feels like he's just gonna die or be sacrificed in some way.</br>  <br>Fusion needs a Miracle Fusion that's not exclusive to Heroes, some way to off set that -2,more cards that fuse based on type and attribute rather than names and if they do continue that shitty trend the name material l monsters need to have effects that are worth it. <br><br>synchros need far more level 5, 6,7 and 8 synchros, <br><br>Rituals need ritual monsters and spells that can actually do shit more than ritual summon the monster and all ritual monsters should have built in protection from spells,traps, monster effects. <br><br>These 3 have a lot of work to do before they could ever be worth anything over a rank 4 xyz monster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, but I'll give Konami credit that they are trying to finally start making cards to keep up with Xyz at the very least. It's still gonna be awhile before it's all relatively balanced though. What they ban and don't ban though needs a serious look at sometimes, I feel like they just bang their heads on a table when it comes that more so than anything else.</br>  what is an "XYZ" anyway<br>why is it pronounced "x-sheezu"<br>is it XYZ or XZ</br></br>  <br>Because Exceed wasn't cool enough for Konami.</br>  <br>is just gonna end like Instant fusion splashable in some decks and even better in top decks.<br><br>but I am all for it if konami want us to play some degenerancy.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be the perfect topdecking card.</br>  <br>It means Exceeding it's just shortened to Xyz, because the way the Nips pronounce it is basically ik-seez, or their way of pronouncing Exceed, or X-yeez, it's weird, but Engrish, and yeah it's Xyz not Xz.</br>  <br><br>I see, thanks</br></br>  <br>XYZ variant when?</br>  <br>No problem man.<br><br>Probably for Kaiba in the new movie.</br></br></br>  <br>I see a smile there.</br>  <br>They can't make better Fusions until they ban Shadolls, because it'll just make Shadolls broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Synchros until they ban Quasar, because it'll just make Quasar broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Rituals until they ban Nekroz, because it'll just make Nekroz broke as fuck<br>It's a vicious cycle</br></br></br></br>    <br> Dark Rebellion XYZ XYZ Dragon Cannon </br>  <br> Make Nekroz broken <br> Make </br></br>  <br>No need to be tsun now.</br>  <br>I'm busy Shun go away.</br>  <br>How will making better synchros make quasar broke as fuck?</br>  <br>If there's one thing I know about Yugioh<br>It's that what is broke can be made even more broke if Konami makes the right moves</br></br>  <br><br><br>Guess we better make some new Ritual cards!<br><br>BUY NEKROZ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Busy getting fat?</br>  <br>I'm simply stating they're already at that stage, you don't need to *make* them broken</br>      <br> If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon. <br> Shit was so hype. </br></br>  <br>omg, I read it in his voice...</br>  <br>What happened when MAXIMUM JIHAD?</br>  <br>I cant wait until the day that Shun gets absolutely destroyed, and I mean destroyed, he had a chance in that second duel. <br><br>This place is going to fucking explode.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun gets absolutely destroyed <br>pls no <br>that being said i can't wait until the day reiji gets destroyed</br></br></br>    <br> making memes for a character with literally 4 scenes </br>  <br> R-Ruri <br> W-what about heartulando? <br> Heartland? I've always lived in Academia <br>And then he died</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun is going to go down hard. Reiji probably wont since he seems to be the main rival, he'll at least put up a fight, even if he's going to lose to Yuya or Leo eventually.<br><br>Can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm the one that brought them to Heartland silly~  Yugo Shokan </br>  <br>Serena is Ruri is still possible.<br>Seriously why are they hiding Ruri's design at this point. Is it just to foster shitty theories like the one I just typed and Ruri=Yuzu? Because come on.</br></br>  <br>It might make sense considering Yuri/Ruri, though I'm curious why Leo only calls her Serena-sama, he didn't say Yuzu-same when telling Yuri to go after her. <br><br>If anybody Yuzu has the best chance of actually being Ruri considering they both have that bird swoop, Yuto said Polymerization doesn't fit her, which is just an odd thing to say regardless of Fusion attacking Xyz, and then you have her mysterious birth and bracelet.</br></br></br>  <br>it's stabilized antimatter monsters</br>  <br>Nah. Ruri is being saved as a surprise. It'll feel like christmas once they show her.</br>  <br>I've been playing around with the unlikely idea that when the girls get to fusiontown, they're immediately mindwiped ala Masumi to believe they're Serena. But I guess with the childhood flashbacks that's not possible.<br><br>(I'm also the loser who keeps saying we won't be seeing Rin in person ever, which is why we get to see flashbacks of her.)</br></br></br>   Rewatching Shun vs Sora <br> Blaze Falcon is taken by Sora <br> Shun starts talking about always being prepared for their comrades being taken before playing Revolution Force <br>Ok yeah, Ruri is definitely gonna be brainwashed or some shit<br>And then Shun will rank her up into a Rank 6 Ruri</br></br></br></br>  <br>When Leo planned the Xyz dimension's destruction, he did not foresee the need for alliances. The Fusion users would sweep through the other dimensions, systematically exterminating their enemies and dismantling the proud xyz users. But the leo's vision was cynical. He did not count on the brave sacrifices the Xyz dimension's heroes were willing to make. After the Fusion's offensive seized the Heartland tower, Leo turned its sights to the synchro dimension,Believing the xyz Dimension was still recovering from its heavy losses, Fusion forces charged into Heartland Academy, where they were caught off guard by the full force of the Resistance's Army. The Resistance obliterated the Fusion squadron and the Battle of Heartland Academy became the Resistance's first major victory in the war.</br>  <br>KATTOBINGU DA<br>ORE</br></br>  <br>The news spread across the City, rekindling lost hopes and re-energizing exhausted defenders. The Resistance Army moved on to defend other battlefronts, but a courageous force of Duelist remained at heartland Academy to await the Fusion user's return. The vengeance of the Fusion came swiftly, elite fusion users army closed in on the Academy grounds to recoup their losses, but Professor Belth Allusis, seven dozen of the Resistance's finest duelist, and four thousand casual's players dug in to defend the Academy's grounds...or get carded trying. The disparity was staggering. An unprecedented Fusion army, fifty thousand strong, descended on Heartland Academy's brave defenders. The defenders were undaunted. With no expectations of survival, they were mindful of their duty.</br>  <br><br>But overconfident Fusion Professors threw all their armies' might into the direct assault and their ground forces fell in droves. For every Xyz duelist who was carded, ten Fusion users were killed. The Fusion professors was forced to call in reinforcements. Despite the defenders determination, their lines were whittled away until only a handful of Duelist remained. They rallied to Professor Allusis for a final stand. Fusion Professor Moff Zellos offered to spare Professor Allusis if he and his brave comrades would surrender. Neither pride nor foolhardiness drove the defender's decision. They were guided by their sidedeck. They had passed beyond the fear of death. Their glorious last stand will never be forgotten. Allusis and his men fell, but not before the Fusion users were driven to retreat. The Battle of Heartland Academy was a draw. The heroes of Heartland Academy inspired bold new xyz strategies that eventually halted the Fusion's advances. In retrospect, though, the Resistance lost too many duelsit in the early days of the war. The execution of the Leo's brilliant strategy was flawless. Survival was the best the Resistance could hope for.</br></br>  So, where the fuck is Yuri? Is he still at Standard? Or did he go back to Academia?  <br><br><br> same guy who kept posting edited Darth Bane quotes </br></br></br>  <br>You kidding? I loved Baneposter-kun.</br>  Yuya has gone full Yuzufag. Please imagine the link below comes complete with a shitty fadeout AMV of Tomato hallucinating his waifu:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sto<wbr>RjxrJavc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>tumblr please go</br>    <br>Unless he's decided that wandering around Standard doing nothing for several days is a good use of his time, he's probably gone back to Academia for a scolding.</br>  BATTLE DA  <br>ENJOOOOOOOOOOY</br>  Meow~  So what makes the Fusion Dimension so much more deadly than the other dimensions anyways? <br><br>I mean I get the shitty logic that they're trying to fuse the dimensions, but why is fusion so good? They should in no way have had the advantage on Xyz. Makes me curious if GX characters actually are their teachers.</br></br>  <br>Probably because the Fusion dimension trained all their soldiers for war and invasion while Xyz dimension just dueled for fun</br>  <br>Even still they're just using generic decks for most of their soldiers and just trouncing most people. <br><br>That and it's pretty safe to assume that all the DM/GX/5Ds/Zexal characters barring the main characters exist in this weird dimensional rift/alternate timeline, so where are half of them even at? Also how do some characters even work such as say Kaiba? If KaibaCorp exists in Synchro, considering the Duel Runners, then what is he doing? Just retired, and if Kaiba would likely exist, I'd assume Pegasus and all the DM/GX characters exist within Synchro too, unless there is technically a Kaiba in both Standard and Fusion as well and they don't take place concurrently. <br><br>Ya know, I'm just confused by this whole stuff honestly. I know it's meant to just be callbacks, but I'm sure they have to have some type of explanation for it at the very least, I don't think they'd just do it without any type of plan whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>artist?</br>  <br>Do not sexualize my monstah kado</br>  Soon  <br>Already ahead of ya there Standard. Two Ruris down, two to go.</br>  <br>Well, since Synchro exist due to Yliaster time travel fuckery, who knows the status of other essential characters such as Kaiba and Mokuba. Pegasus is dead though. Died in Duelist Kingdom.</br>  <br>Ok, I'll sexualize Selena then.</br>  <br>I lost my shit when they treated the fucking prison guard getting hit as a duel</br>  Are there any gifs/webms of Shun going Yusei on the guards yet?      <br>That's fine.</br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br> gif </br>  <br> gifs </br>  <br> gifs of Shun going Yusei on the guards </br>  So why are lancers selection being sent to do this and not like a swat team? They're just duelists.  Huh, Yuya's more of a carnivore than Sawatari is.  Tell me, /a/.<br><br>What other illicit drugs will Yuya and pals target in the next OPs?</br></br>  Why was Sawatari allowed to come with them? Didn't he like lick and sexually harass one of the female characters? Oh yeah, gotta send the potential rapist there, he's there to look after all the asses  <br>When the hell did that happen?<br>Are you accusing the great Neo New Sawatari of something he has not done? There's no bigger disgrace</br></br>  Explain this  Can someone more well-versed in the card game than me explain what monster is being portrayed in the poster?  <br>When he kidnapped Yuzu he was like, grabbing her and getting pretty close.</br>  <br>That's an Obelisk Force</br>  <br>I thought that was supposed to be Obelisk Force.</br>  <br>But he didn't kidnap her.<br>He has not ever touched Yuzu or any other females in any way either.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, damn! I thought the 'head' part was the head and the 'shoulder blades' part was the tail, and this is some weird four-footed monster. Only now have I realized the other shoulder blade.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're duel energy tanks.

Maybe you should try being indifferent towards her, Yuya!</br>  <br> Let's warn everyone about Yugo <br> NOT YUGO! FUGO! <br> oh right, but let's also make the person on the poster a silhouette so no one knows what they actually look like </br></br></br>  <br>Not even that guy. But you know that he is right. This whole "VR" thing has just been a marketing gimmick because VR sure as fuck sounds a lot more attractive than "a partial taste of what might eventually evolve into VR".</br>  I can't be the only one enjoying Choujiro so far,  can i? <br><br>I wish he joins yuya's group or lives a better lives somehow.</br></br>  I remember when Yugioh used to be good...<br><br> Seven weeks ago, before Synchro happened </br></br>  <br>It will be Christmas by the time they show her.</br>  <br> It will be Christmas by the time they show her <br>Of 2017.</br></br>  <br> try being indifferent towards the Citrus <br>He already did that.

Like dating a Goddess.  Sexually exhausting.  You wouldn't understand.  <br>How is this show still being talked about 20 years later? Is there a reboot or remake coming or something?</br>  <br>Because Lain is the true God and not Madoka. Yet there are at least 2 Madoka threads daily.</br>  <br>No and it's unlikely that'd ever happen.<br>It's just one of the mediums more artistic works and has an aesthetic that fits anonymous internet chat quite well so it gets continued discussion</br></br>  <br>No, but it had a great impact, and that's why it's still talked about today. Unfortunately, instead of actual discussion, people like to post endless threads quoting the opening and sexualizing/deifying/posting cute pictures of Lain as if that's what it means to "love Lain" -  which it's not </br>  <br>Pray to lain, do not imagine fornicating with her.<br><br><br>would a christian fornicate with jesus?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Can you imagine clubbing with Lain?<br>Can you imagine going to Mogra with Lain?<br><br>Man, I bet she's just 3fun5me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey, I can appreciate the anime for its deeper meanings and shitpost about molesting a cybergoddess at the same time.</br>  <br>Because it's rather unique as far as anime goes and a lot of its artsy circlejerking is left up to interpretation.</br>  <br> implying Despera will ever actually air </br>  I was shocked when Arisu approched to Lain at the end of the anime. I thought Lain was invisible on reality. Did Lain show progress over the years and become a part of 3D world?  Present day.<br> Present time </br>  <br>She didn't become invisible. She erased all memory of herself and became a spectator. She can still show herself.</br>  <br>Why is talking about a series like Lain from time to time strange when we have 8 bazillions of Fate and Oregairu threads everyday?</br>  What would proposing to Lain feel like?  <br>There was an actual discussion thread yesterday fag, they only show up when an anon takes his sweet time to share a piece of his mind.</br>    <br>I understand that, but threads for mindlessly posting about how cute Lain is should go in /c/. In fact, there's a thread up right now.</br>  Arisu~  Dating her would be unsatisfying. <br><br>Go over to her house to hang, and she ignores you all night to post on the internet.</br></br>  <br>Yeah no. Lain desires companionship. That's why she got on the internet in the first place.</br>  <br>She is the internet</br>  <br>Because there's other old weird stuff that's never talked about.</br>  <br><br><br> posting on the internet all night <br> Lain is the internet <br><br>So does this mean she'd just be masturbating?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Appreciation threads are everywhere and you can't stop it. Why resist instead of posting qt Lain wearing bear costume?</br>  <br>Because it's old. It's not entertaining. It's almost mind numbing. The same images everytime. The same posts everytime. The same Boa lyrics everytime.</br>  You'd have to agree to kill both of yourselves  <br> Go over to her house to hang <br>We all know why you want to visit her house, it's because you want to rape her onee-chan, am i right anon?</br></br>  <br>You can't compare the Kiminozo anime to Lain, it was shit and poorly executed.</br>  <br>So the more I'm going deeper on internet the more I'm deeper inside Lain</br>  <br>That would certainly be pleasant for the first few visits, but it's not the main reason.</br>  An experiment ;D  <br>are those cat ears or a bow in her hair?</br>  Like dating Dr. Manhatten?  <br><br>A bow... that looks like cat ears.</br></br>  <br>moe as fuck</br>  Too complex to put into words.  Slow, but possessing a dreamlike quality to it each time you meet.  holy fuck i just realized that the wired, crazier lain domming the real, softer and more childlike lain would be the sexiest piece of selfcest i'll ever witness<br>pls someone commission</br>  <br>I prefer the relationship of Lain and Alice TBH.<br>Nothing overly sexual, but good companions.</br></br>  <br> The same images everytime. The same posts everytime. <br>Welcome to /a/</br></br>  <br> How is this show still being talked about 20 years later? <br>It's gud<br>References and mindfuck, gud. Soundtrack and albums, gud. Plot and execution, gud.<br><br>Besides, Lain pretty much became the first interweb goddess.</br></br></br></br></br>  Lain is Love<br>Lain is Life<br><br>Let's all love Lain.</br></br></br>  <br>pretty boring, since she's a fucking shut-in. her friends had to practically drag her out clubbing.</br>  <br>Introverts are the best kinds of people</br>  <br>PRESENT DAY<br><br>PRESENT TIME</br></br></br>  <br>Like dating a neckbeard from /g/.</br>  <br> go over to her house to hang <br>yourself</br></br>    <br>Shy Lain is cute and likes bears. I'd dress up like a teddy and we would cuddle a lot.</br>  <br>It is nigger. It is</br>  <br>I pray for lain everyday and everynight, even though she's not my waifu but I like her</br>  <br>Ask this fucker</br>  <br> Go over to her house to hang, and she ignores you all night to post on the internet. <br><br> Implying should wouldn't just appear in your bedroom while you're at your PC fappin it to loli porn to laugh at you. </br></br></br>  <br>Taro? If he was Taro he'd be a statistic.</br>    <br>Yeah sure. It's "gud."<br>I don't think that's enough though. I don't see many Lain memes. No merchandise. Barely anything in any media referencing it. And the internet was still in its infancy when it aired. There must be something else driving this other than oldfags and word of mouth.</br></br>  lain...  <br>Because it's genuinely amazing.<br>Even more so if you look at how many things it got right in predicting the future.</br></br>  <br>I'm currently watching this now and I don't know what the fuck is going on</br>  <br><br>It's unique. If it were a generic battle shonen or harem or magical girl show executed with the same competency you probably wouldn't see many people still discussing it to this day, but because there's genuinely nothing else like Lain it remains in the cultural consciousness.</br></br>  <br>Looks like DFC to me</br>  <br>Don't worry, you'll go back to rewatch it over and over and over again.</br>  <br>Same reason we still discuss LOGH. If you circlejerk something long enough, others will notice and join. It then becomes an enduring machine.</br>  Let's all love  <br>Despera Never  ;_; </br>  <br>Why was her hair unbalanced?</br>    <br>I really like this reaction image.</br>    Like an IRC cybersex.    <br>Bastards like you killed Hidamari alcoholics anonymous threads.</br>  So why didn't she just pay Arlong with her body?  would arlong even be attracted sexually to a human? he hates them.  <br> implying arlong would fuck a filthy inferior human </br>  <br> implying Bell-Milf is a filthy inferior human </br>  <br> implying she actually had those two kids <br>She was still in prime when she was killed</br></br>  <br>You can still be a milf if your kids are adopted.</br>  Now that last week's filler reaction chapter was out of the way, what do you expect this week?<br><br> Jesus steals Doffy/Law's fruit <br>   Kizaru outta nowhere <br> Party chapter </br></br></br></br>  <br>- Burgess bravely runs away<br>- Donquixotes are rounded up<br>- no party, cause the entire country is in ruins and there's nowhere to party<br>- Sabo gives Straw Hats a ride on his own ship and takes them to Zou</br></br></br></br>  <br> the entire country is in ruins and there's nowhere to party <br> Implying that even stop Skypiea people to not having a party. </br></br>  <br>another chapter of reaction pics ending with burgess springing into action<br>no chapter next week</br></br>  I'm guessing the Sunny will be hinted at in the last panel of the chapter, then it will appear in a silhouette in the last panel of that chapter, then no chapter next week<br><br>I really want to see Robin and Sabo/Koala reunite, and deliver some message to Luffy about Dragon</br></br>  What made this guy so strong?  <br>As of yet unseen Haki/DF powers</br>  <br>Love for adventures.</br>  <br><br>i used to think it was some hidden power of something but now i think its more along the lines of king or more relevant like buggy <br><br>even though he was a D he didnt get any real kickass special powers, hes probably just really charismatic and happened to be in high stakes situations and everyone just assumed he did it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, someone like Rayleigh wouldn't follow a weakling.</br>  Because he didn't want to have sex with a monkey. Now if she was a fish...  <br>He awakened his Haki.</br>  <br>Rayleigh makes me hope that Roger didn't have any df either. Conquering the world just with guts, friends, luck and talent sounds very fitting.</br>  <br>Dressrosa people can party all they want, Straw Hats can't afford that anyway. They need to get healed and set sail ASAP, or else they're risking a "rescue Sanji" arc.</br>  <br>Then luffy would just be shit by comparison</br>  Doflamingo wasn't even that evil, he just wanted to kill normies  <br>Cuz humans are gross duh!</br>  <br>Because Arlong doesn't like human pussy. Ever seen his sister? That's some prime Shark Pussy right there.</br>  <br>100 push-ups, 100 sit-ups and a 10km run, every day for three years, followed by a wig glued to his head.</br>  I always found it weird that Arlong was the strongest in East Blue and he walked around in a Hawaiian shirt and sandals.  <br>Luffy walks around in sandals and a Hawaiian shirt on Dressrosa.</br>  <br>She's a fucking Marine</br>  <br>So, in the end she DID pay with her body.</br>  <br><br>Zoro has no df but luffy has one<br>Rayleigh has no df but Roger...<br><br>I see a pattern</br></br></br></br></br>  If the grand line is so dangerous, how the fuck are there random civilians everywhere there?  <br>it's not a pattern if you can't prove there's a pattern</br>  <br>because pirates dont work? Someone has to maintain the farms and such</br>  <br>I mean how do the civilians even get there?</br>  <br>Another filler reaction chapter.<br>With the backstory of a character no one cares about (for example,Rebecca). Oda is stalling for chapter 800.</br></br>  <br>Travelled with strong captains<br><br>Look at noland. His entire crew was cannon fodder and he sailed everywhere.</br></br></br>  <br>Born there. Maybe some descended from retired pirates or are just bastard children?</br>  Reminder we'll spend a whole chapter wasted on Mansherry crying back all of Dressrosa (also Kyros's leg), they didn't bring up that her tears curing buildings to for no reason, thus erasing everything physical Doflamingo has done to anyone on Dressrosa (I understand he caused over 10 years of mental anguish but whatever most people didn't even know it was happening or that they were missing loved ones.)<br><br>Not to mention what happens from now on with Rebecca and her family. This post arc is gonna be balls except for finding out what the Colosseum fighters are gonna do and Doffy's fate.<br><br>I know Oda will pull something outta left field but I'm keeping my hopes down low.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People have been living there for thousands of years. The Great Age of Pirates began 24 years ago.</br>  <br><br><br>POETRY<br>O<br>E<br>T<br>R<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This chapter will be "party" chapter if there even is one. Next will be discussion chapter about the main story and the world as a whole and maybe a glimpse of sanji and co. Then luffy and the rest will set off to wherever sanji is and then we will get glimpses of major players and old friends throughout the world which may last another chapter. So unless we get an arc on sanji's adventures, the next island should be 5-6 chapters away.</br>  <br> Doffy is cuffed and blindfolded.  <br> Fuji is gonna pull a Kizaru now that everyone is weakened. <br> A large ship appears from the horizon </br></br></br>  DOFFYFAGS<br><br>B L O W N T H E F U C K O U T<br>L<br>O<br>W<br>N<br><br>T<br>H<br>E<br><br>F<br>U<br>C<br>K<br><br>O<br>U<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the problem oda isn't addressing. If shank's crew is naturally on a whole other level of power than the rest of the world from pure skill and haki without powerups, and if roger was just incredibly strong, enough to be pirate king, in his base form he's always in, how can luffy possibly compete when his base form can be slapped aroumd by anyone worth half a shit, and he has to destroy his body or be completely vulnerable for 10 minutes afterwards just to get CLOSE to his opponent's power, which is still eclipsed by someone like shanks and even more by roger? He's relying on his fruit to give him all his strength when he needs to be stronger in his base form. He needs more training</br>  <br>Wishful thinking my brother. We're lucky if Mansherry fixing everything and the Rebecca family's future is only one chapter each, veryy lucky.<br><br>I do hope the crew splitting up leads to something a bit different, sorta like Luffy soloing the story for Impel Down/Marineford, next could be a mini-arc of pretty much every character who really needs to shine or just not look like shit(The Sanji-Hats), it's kinda perfect. If the Kidd alliance was after Big Mom it would be cool to see it with them, or maybe by some stretch of luck the Leftover Hats adventure with the Heart pirates.</br></br></br>  <br>Arlong is a fishman supremacist and loathes humans.</br>  <br>No DF, just an incredibly huge badass. Literally nothing "special". Basically like Garp.</br>  <br>probably the combo of haki and some broken ass devil fruit.</br>  <br>His nose hair</br>  <br>the gomu gomu no mi</br>  Found this in a grocery parking lot. Good taste or autism?  <br> Hancock <br> good taste </br></br>  <br> implying that's not your car </br>  <br>Seriously I was walking past and saw it and had to take a picture</br>  <br>Oda's never went without Luffy for that long, I doubt he would give Nami's group the focus for an entire arc.</br>  <br> triforce <br>Autism</br></br>    <br>Disgusting fish dck.</br>  law is a slut  <br>because fishmen don't fuck, the female lays eggs into the water and the male puts his milk on them.</br>  <br>the grand line is dangerous to SAIL, what with the sea-monsters and crazy weather, but once you're on an island the environment becomes much more stable due to magnetic poles or some such bullshit, so if you can handle the unique environment of the island itself you're good as long as you stay there.</br>  <br>No. The thought of copulating with a woman, or race mixing in general, would likely make Arlong's stomach turn. The man's racial pride would likely make the most hardcore Stormfronter blush.</br>  <br> Still no fanart of Shyarly teasing her manlet older brother </br>  <br>This raised a huge question for me. They went through the trouble of saying that Fishmen and Mermen and mermaids are different things. So are arlong and his sister half breeds? Or is it just kinda random and sometime you're a fishman and sometimes you're a mermaid/Merman?</br>  <br>It'd be like hitler trying to fuck a jew.</br>  <br>Yeah, both fishmen and merfolk have recessive genes that their children can inherit so two fishmen can birth a merman and vice versa.</br>  <br>It'd be Hitler fucking a deformed and mentally retarded half breed gypsy jew while she smokes a cigarette and takes a dump on his paintings.</br>  <br>Literally explained in the manga</br>    <br>Who's gay.</br>  <br><br>Ah dang. I don't know how I missed that. I JUST reread this part too. My bad.</br></br>  I like how the presence of half-fishmen and half-giants explains why some people are weird looking and/or freakishly tall.  <br> Someone somewhere in the One Piece canon universe got that snu-snu </br>  <br>I wonder how Magellan and Hannyabal got horns in their genes.</br>  <br> even though he was a D he didnt get any real kickass special powers, hes probably just really charismatic and happened to be in high stakes situations and everyone just assumed he did it <br><br>Shiki had mentioned that he single handedly destroyed his 500-fleet armada. I think he's strong, like really fucking strong.</br></br></br>  What does this face convey /a/?  <br>Im pretty sure we're gonna see sanji, and or what the kidd alliance is up to then end it with a cliff hanger, next weeks chapter they're gonna rush to zou</br>  <br>Because arlong only fucks top notch babes like his sister</br>  <br>man Den was underrated<br><br> Where the fuck is my merman porn? </br></br></br>  <br>My face hurts, my crew was useless, I want to be a real celestial dragon and go home, this monkey is annoying</br>    <br>hes a big guy</br>  <br> I'm sure that he will die after this one <br> Your efforts are futile strawha- OH WAIT WHAT THE NO FUCK FUCK FUUCK FUUUUUUUUUUUUUU </br></br>  <br><br>there's also the possibility to consider of the children of zoan-users.</br></br>  <br>so Bellamy is just a giantlet how hit puberty post TS?</br>  <br> children of zoan-users. <br><br>dont be dumb</br></br></br>  <br> A guy woke up and decided to fuck a giant <br> He succeeded </br></br>  <br> "I really don't think I'm having a good day right now" </br>  <br>So infidelity would be relatively easy to get away with for fishmen and mermaids</br>  <br>Never go full retard, anon.</br>  What would Arlong think of  cute  half-breeds?  <br>"lol gg it took 200 of you to kill me"</br>  <br>I think that would be more of an ng considering how above humanity he thought he was</br>  <br>She's racist.</br>    <br> One piece  <br> Filler  <br><br>Is your head ok anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Christ this art is so messy. Not to mention the unnecessary amount of text bubbles.

I thought he understood and was just fascinated by what he was saying since he looked up to Tom so much.</br>  <br>he got huge Post TS though</br>  <br>I think you have the right interpretation</br>  <br>Looks like anime just fucked up. Luffy comes up to his chest here.</br>  <br>Sittin down and crouching over, he still is taller than Luffy, he only increased his muscle mass during the time skip.</br>  <br>yeah I suppose so since they make Bartolomeo like the exact same height</br>  <br>Luffy seems to be further from the background in that image given the direction he's facing.</br>  So is CP-0 still on the island?  <br>He wanted to protect his friends more than anyone else wanted to protect their friends</br>  <br> Good thing I didn't make the mistake of underestimating him like everyone else did </br>  <br>Blaaar I miss old One Piece, shit like this is so rereadable. I like Post TS but things haven't really felt the same since maybe Impel Down. I don't wish to reread Dressrosa anytime soon, reread the fight, I might do the flashback that was good</br>  <br>Pretty sure they were leaving when we saw them</br>  <br>To be fair doffy tried going all out and couldn't possibly know luffy would have another brother and ally himself with everyone</br>  <br>That's on Doffy too. He had all these strong fighters gathered in that coliseum and somehow never saw that biting him in the ass.</br>  <br>To his credit he at least created a Spider's Web before sending his final attack through it. He just forgot that an enlarged version of an attack that could already send him flying across the island would wreck everything in its way</br>  <br> there's always a logical reason for phenomena <br>YOU LIVE IN A WORLD WITH MAGIC FRUITS THAT GIVE YOU SUPERPOWERS!</br></br>  <br><br>What? is it so outlandish to think a child conceived from a human and a human/animal hybrid couldn't retain some animal like traits?</br></br>  Post best One Piece music<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hv_<wbr>mT53eLec</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>you already fucked up</br>  <br>Link unrelated</br>  <br>Are YOU going to tell him he can't?</br>  <br> will it be a squid? <br> or a kid? </br></br>  <br>It's not even so much a Hawaiian shirt as it is a sunflower shirt ...which is even worse<br><br>He also wore a blouse on Amazon Lily</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I can't hold all that shit taste</br></br></br>  <br>Because she isn't a slut and has pride.

In influence or strength  <br>It looks like "beautiful lady with a snake" so it's fine. Fuck that Zelda shit though,</br>  <br> JESUS FUCKING CHRIST THESE SHARDS ARE SO CLOSE TO MY EYE </br>  <br>Nah. Everybody who met Luffy would be like "OH SHIT IT'S RODGER'S FRUIT"</br>  Who is "that person"?  <br>maybe hitler wouldn't have done anything wrong if a jewlet just gave some up?</br>  <br>Buggy</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5dl<wbr>VeiY61VA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>law is such a hot slut<br><br>I want to see him get violated and have tears in his eyes but really like it</br></br></br>  <br> not the result of someone fucking a fighting fish </br>  <br>I want to see this crew's reunion.</br>  why is this thread becoming literally SnK tier? <br>this wasn't this bad a few months ago</br>  <br>They probably miss him<br><br>Do you think Law misses them too?</br></br></br>  <br>They definitely miss him. They love their captain a lot. Once Law goes, I'M going to miss him.<br><br>I find it cute that his crew doesn't call him by name, though. For some reason. Kidd's and Luffy's crews call them by name. Law's doesn't. Not saying that's a good or bad thing.</br></br></br>  <br> this wasn't this bad a few months ago </br>  <br>Obviously not. Why else would he ditch them? That makes him a scumbag in your eyes, I bet.<br>Or perhaps the fact that he left his crew and is using strawhats, and not his precious crew, in a near death attempt to kill Doffy makes him an even bigger scumbag. "Why waste my crew when I can use this dumb fuckhead's?" Winning!</br></br>  <br><br>Or maybe he came into this with a deathwish and didn't want his crew to die along with him. Noble sacrifice and all</br></br>  <br> it's been shit for a while now, m8 </br>  <br>He's half fighting fish fishman. Different from fucking the actual fish itself.</br>  <br>As stated in post you replied to, deathwish or not, but let's use this one's crew and get them killed, because kawaii and shit.</br>  <br>yes you moron<br><br><br>If DF affected offspring. there'd be little Mera Mera babies and Gomu Gomu children all over the damn place</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her relationship with Gen was amicable and he was a surrogate father to her children.</br>  <br>Sunflowers fit more with Dressrosa<br><br>considering the huge flower field there</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo<br><br>he's not going to want to let Luffy out of his sight again and it's not like Luffles would say no to him<br><br>Dragon is on his own now</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its been like this since mid punk hazard one piece hasn't been able to contain peoples autism since then</br>  <br><br>Many months ago people had threads on the chapter release day and then let them die unless there was something to discuss.

It's not like it's in Doffy's nature to correct his charge's weird quirks so Law grew up picky<br><br>It's just to show off his childish nature</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thoughts/ideas/stories of Doffy spoiling Law as a kid makes me happy. Thanks for this, anon.</br>  <br>No problem! I love to please</br>  <br>guys what if it was a decoy, look at his face, threads/strings perhaps or just shock of impact effects?</br>  <br><br>I suspect that's Doffy but he's not actually KO'd<br><br>Just laying there in pain, unable to move but still awake and in a bad mood</br></br></br></br>  what would happen if a devil fruit got a bite taken out it by two people at the exact same time, perfectly synchronized  <br>Well, according to physics, that's impossible, one or the other would have to be the first, so yeah that's boring.</br>  <br>If like to think he was just a huge badass, who became the pirate king because he wanted to and worked his ass off for it.</br>   tfw re-reading FI <br>Who love OP here?</br>  <br>me but not that arc</br>  <br>whitebeard in his prime was the only person to tied with him,which probably means garp in his prime is stronger,unless his illness or flashback says so other why's</br>  <br>FI was fun<br> we're friends, right? <br><br>Also, Shirahoshi has pink hair and cries a lot<br>Rebecca has pink hair and cries a lot<br><br>Why not weakbecca?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> get cucked <br> oh those merman genes! </br></br>  <br> implying cucking is a thing when your reproductive mode is shooting your jizz over eggs in the sand </br>  <br>literally<br> why were these people born into my world? </br></br>  <br><br>So did Genzo ever tap that?</br></br>  <br>Awakened Haki</br>  How would you guys feel about Rebecca joining the SH?<br><br>You can't complain about being a sword user, since she literally, doesn't attack.</br></br>  <br>Why is Papagg so balla?</br>  <br>Never ever, remember when Kyros said she will never have to fight again. If she joined, she would literally be useless.</br>  <br>But she would never fight.</br>  <br>why does pappug look like hes been cut open and stitched back together</br>  <br> they go full dbz </br>  <br> Oh no these bad guys are going to kill my friends <br><br> Too bad I can't fight :) </br></br></br>  i didn't know rayleigh was married to shakky  <br>All of the Straw Hats will survive at the end of the series.<br>You're talking crazy, my friend.</br></br>  <br> wanting the most useless character in the entirety of OP to join <br>Even fucking Gatz managed to be more useful than her</br></br>  <br> oh no my auntie is getting brutally killed by Doflamingo! <br> it's not like I'm going to just stay here watching and crying right? </br></br>  King Neptune is best king.  <br> remember when Kyros said she will never have to fight again <br><br>We never heard her thoughts on the matter, she only cried in happiness. It would explain why she confronted Doflamingo since she probably learned she needs to hurt others to protect those she loves.</br></br></br>  <br> she confronted Doflamingo <br>She fucking didn't. She just stayed there watching Viola getting beaten and then got caught by Doflamingo.She didn't move a single inch.</br></br>   tfw Robin will never have a chapter dedicated to her like all the other straw hats   If the only way into the Royal Neptune Palace is through a tube that is locked by a steel gate, how did the axe Vanderdecken get through to almost hit Shirahoshi?  <br>Doffy stands up again, is pissed, wants to kill Luffy, realizes that Sabo and Fujitora are roaming around, flees.</br>  <br>You're missing the point, she even thought to herself while running there that if she doesn't do something it's all for nothing, she at least tried even if she did get controlled.</br>  <br>Axes don't really care for paths.</br>  <br>You're missing the point. She didn't try. She literally didn't even move,you see her only crying. There is a difference between just thinking she'll do it and actually doing it.</br>  <br>Are you doubting Oddachi?</br>  <br>And I'm sure everybody would love to watch that all series</br>  <br>Rich reggae sea star that gets all that fish pussy.</br>  <br> she at least tried <br>No, see, she didn't try. She quite literally did not try. She didn't even move, she was standing there and then got Parasite'd</br></br>  <br>Wan Piss of Shit.</br>  <br>I literally just checked and she stayed there because Viola told her to, honestly not that much time passed any ways she did not stay there long before she got parasited.</br>  <br>Wan Piss is great</br>  <br> that barto <br>why did he stop</br></br>  <br>Better than Riku? Of course.<br><br>What about Cobra?</br></br></br>  <br> Barto could've became a nakama right then and there </br>  <br>Cobra helped a bunch of wanted criminals spy on his bathing daughter. What kind of king does that?</br>  <br>Excuse me?</br>  <br>He needs an hour to build up that punch and even then you can just cross your fingers and be safe from it. What a lame dude.</br>  <br>Okay, then out of the good kings Riku is the worst.</br>  <br>He saved hundreds of lives with that punch. Best damn janitor ever.</br>  <br>That's the aftermath of the brain transplant surgery.<br><br>Starfish don't actually have brains but Papagg was given one by a generous mad doctor. It's also why he can walk and talk.</br></br></br>  so if Roger was basically Luffy, does this mean he was also a huge idiot and people just remember him as some sort of great man? (Just like doffy perceived luffy during the great war)  How strong do you guys think Noland is? He sliced up that snake pretty easily, but I'm not sure how I could compare to any of the modern day cast.  <br>like your average new world pirate.</br>  <br>I'd probably lose all faith in Oda.<br>I can take the girls not being relevant in fights and men going easy on them because they're girls but this ? No, that'd be unacceptable.  I'd probably still read it though </br></br>    <br>hence the 'See you next week' meme is always posted here. People always cry and whine and say they'll drop the series but they always come crawling back.</br>  <br>Somebody is incredibly assblasted.</br>  <br><br>To be fair he took a beating</br></br>  <br><br>I actually really love the sunflower shirt he's been wearing in Dressrossa. Probably the best look Luffy has had since Enies Lobby.</br></br>     Oda doesn't want to make romance dragging the adventure down <br> princesses keep falling for Luffy <br> One Piece is turning into a long distance harem <br><br>If the Strawhats go to the reverie Luffy is gonna drown in so much pussy the world government won't need sea stone handcuffs to neutralise his powers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a guy who goes to my uni whose number plate is '1piece' and he has stickers of the whole straw hat crew across the back window, if I come across it again I'll get a pic for you all.</br>  <br>Surely, the biggest question has to be<br> Who is actually going to give 2 shits about Rebecca when the arc is over, <br>Right ?</br></br></br>  <br>And rightly so. No named character has been more useless and/or more shat on by Oda than Rebecca. She may very well be the only character whose objective she didn't act upon. She kept thinking about attaining it, but she never seem to do anything right. She runs away, cries, try to kill people with blunt swords, what the everloving fuck. <br>In a series where willpower is the key to powerlevel, even a little girl like her (a fucking gladiator whose nickname is "the undefeated woman" for fuck's sake, I refuse to believe someone who keep evading strikes can't strrike themselves) could have done something. But no, it's like Oda did everything to ensure someone would do the stuff in her stead so they'd look good. That's the only thing she did right, make other people look good for saving/sparing/rising her.</br></br>  <br>You're awfully emotional over this. So this is what it's like when someone is tsundere for their waifu.</br>  <br> emotional <br>But I didn't use a reeeeee pepe<br>.<br> So this is what it's like when someone is tsundere for their waifu <br>Not my waifu but I can see that the reason I'm so assblasted is because I had high expectations for her, character development wise.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be okay with him being a generic pirate who wields a pistol in one and a sword in other hand. <br><br>And yeah he punches stuff inbetween.<br><br>A pirate Garp.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He does kinda have a point though. Getting the key to Law's cuffs are the only good thing I can remember her doing.</br>  <br> Garp <br> using a gun <br>He'd shoot himself in the foot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>His pistol probably rips people in half due to his haki being so strong.</br></br>  <br>She wasn't even a qt so there's no point to her existence.</br>  <br> a pirate Garp <br>I always wonder if the pirates in OP carry pistols and swords just because they look piratey.</br></br>  <br>Even that was useless because Doflamingo sent a clone to bring his own keys to Law anyways.</br>  <br>The sword is probably how he got the scar.<br><br><br>That's more arguable since it's subjective. She's pretty hot, in all fairness. Maybe even hotter than Nami, cause I like her hair more. But that's just me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea, but they ended up not using that key. Look, I'm not saying she did good, I'm saying she, at least, did something. No matter how insignificant or rather useless it was.</br>  <br>I think her hair is trash personally so I guess that's why our opinions differ.</br>  <br><br>E U R O B E A T<br><br>http://www.youdubber.com/index.php?<wbr>video=fr_hwWJcHf4&amp;video_start=150&amp;a<wbr>udio=EJ8YljjhGc0&amp;audio_start=187</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well sure, of course you're right.  But because they didn't use it now we'll never know for sure why Doffy did what he did fuck fuck fuck reeeeee </br>    <br>That explains that. I don't know, I just like that her hair is all proper and nicely done and what not. But hey, that's subjective for ya.</br>  <br>Cause he was still willing to let it all slide ? Remember when Luffy and Law first reached Doffy and Trebol ? Doffy asked them, just to make sure, why they were there and he was "disappointed" by their reply. Pretty sure he still asks Law to give him the operation in the middle of the fight.</br>  <br> what the hell is a kong <br>Fuckin' kekked heartily. Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think so too but that's all just speculation I would have liked for someone to confront him about it so we could have been sure.</br>  Burgess got owned as expected and looks like blackbeard is calling him.  <br>Bah, that's too much info, in my opinion. Some things have to be pieced together by character's dialogue. It's no fun having a quiz on stuff like this. Pretty sure Doffy even started talking about first meeting Law after they refused his key. It's not all that unclear what his intentions were.</br>  <br>Yeah you're right, I guess all I wanted were more scenes with Doflamingo.<br>It hurts to think we won't see him for a good 5 eays now.</br></br>  <br>He'll always be in your heart Anon.

But One Piece's power levels are shit,anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>Some kind of patchouli perfume, probably Angel. Fits with the blue hair too.</br>  <br>Marco was jack shit compared to Whitebeard. Same with Jozu. Burgess is no exception. He had to run away when Teach fought Ace and it was explicitly stated that none of them stood a chance against Ace. Why people think Sabo, who is clearly stronger, would be a different case is a mystery to me.</br>  <br> It's a Sabo chapter <br><br>I hope Law gets a bit more of a reaction to Doffy's defeat than that near-blank one panel stare in 790.</br></br></br>  <br>I... Is there a bigger version?? I'd like to hopefully read. Sorry for asking if it's not possible. Thank you.</br>  <br> actually wanting more law <br>Please no</br></br>  <br>You literally just spelled it out, bro. The commanders could fight to a tie. The Yonko's could do it easily.

Pretty sure he was falling over after switching Luffy over.</br></br>   mfw all these assblasted fujos just because a pair of tits gets more fan service than their stupid faggot pairings   <br><br>He will go from being a grumpy groo and back to a smug bastard when he gets back to his crew.</br></br>  <br>It's not that I opted out of it, it's just that it doesn't exist. In public schools at least. Praise the separation of church and state.</br>  <br><br>He's going to cry when he reunites with his crew and sees how they were all worried about him and feels guilty for leaving them alone to pursue his crazy deathwish.</br></br>  <br>Yes, he did. Any chapter is fine with me. I kind of need some closure too before I say goodbye to Law.</br>  <br><br><br>Law. Crying. Wh... Why do I want this... I know he cried a lot as a kid but... Well, that or maybe just him looking like he's in peace. Or sleeping. Those eyebags, man. Those eyebags.</br></br></br>  <br>Gomu gomu</br>  <br>But fanservice isn't even the reason Rebecca sucks as a character.</br>  <br>It's the Curl-Curl Fruit, it has immense power to roll up anything.<br><br> Roger used it to style his moustache. </br></br></br>   Law still hasn't made a one piece cryface <br>Time's running out.</br>  <br>He'll do in the kaidou arc  before giving luffy enternal youth </br>  <br>Well, some people theorize the Void Century has something to do with the seas becoming unsailable. Whether or not that's true though, people have been living on these islands for over 1000 years (it's directly mentioned in Dressrosa) and up until 20 years ago, nobody had ever even reached the end of the Grand Line (in known history). So clearly they were a lot like the real world where people lived everywhere but it only was explored slowly over the course of hundreds of years until connections were made through technology between all these various lands.</br>  <br>Jesus "Jobber" Burgess does it again.</br>  <br>that doesn't have anything to do with what I said <br>I'm saying that fujos are overreacting at rebecca just because she gets fan service while their faggot fantasy does not</br></br>  <br> before giving luffy enternal youth <br>Why do so many people believe this, I really don't see a reason why it shoud happen.<br> but Oda wouldn't introduce a power if he didn't mean to use it ! <br>It already served his purpose by giving Doffy a reason to look for the Ope Ope and lust after Law, and it may also be there to justify the existence of an immortal character we might meet later in the story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But that's not the reason they were mad about Rebecca.<br> while their faggot fantasy does not <br>It gets plenty, you just don't see it because you're too focused on tits.</br></br></br>  <br> he is going to be one of my friends  <br> this somehow means they are going to fuck or have some kind of love relationship <br> fujos are actually this delusional </br></br></br>  <br> Why do so many people believe this, I really don't see a reason why it shoud happen. <br><br> Oh dude look at it Sabo is alive <br> NO NO NO YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND GODA <br> turns out he actually is alive <br><br>Onepiece is good, but it doesn't pretend to be unaware about the fact that it is a shonen.

This is an honest question. Not meant to mock. I'm not around here that often. I don't really know why people think that. Enlighten me? <br><br>I was thinking Law would probably restructure Luffy's body to do something about that Gear 4 drawback, but not sure about eternal youth. <br><br>As for the introduction... Maybe it was introduced so people would want it? Maybe not just Doffy? And because people are after it, Law chose to do his voyaging in a submarine?</br></br></br></br></br>  Even though I know he'll be back to either troll or reluctantly help Luffy out (probably when it comes to taking on Mariejois), i'm gonna miss Mingo.  <br> law would give a fuck about it or ask luffy for fucking permission <br>yeah no</br></br>  <br>Best king are alabasta and skypiea kings</br>  <br> Room. Makes Luffy immortal. Dies. <br> TORAO WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO YOU <br><br>This is kind of interesting to me, honestly.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this? A picture For Mortals!</br>  <br> oh yeah let me just kill myself and give you immortality without your permission <br>do you think that in this manga, where the only people that die is in one of the biggest arcs or flashbacks, that kind of stupid dead is going to happen?</br></br>  <br>Luffy's shortened his own life drastically with his techniques, so people are trying to think of ways to put a stop to it, and Law's power looks like it might help.<br><br>However, I don't think that'd happen at all. It's more likely gonna end up with an arc where Luffy is incapacitated/dying and the crew search for a cure without him to lead them and come into their own a little more.</br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou rapes everything left and right   especially robin and nami <br> luffy is the strongest remaining fighter, but has not enough stamina/power <br> law is half-dead <br> It's time <br>It's way to easy to make this work out dude</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>immortality from the ope is not fucking god mode <br>is just that you don't die of old age</br></br>  <br> immortality from the ope is not fucking god mode  <br> is just that you don't die of old age <br>Are you God Oda? If yes, why can the Ope Ope make you teleport? My Doctor never teleported in my presence, because that's kind of rude.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, I see. Thanks anon. Maybe Law could "improve his life expectancy" (can't think of a better term, sorry) without giving him eternal youth? Is this something anyone has considered before? Again, just being honestly curious.</br>  <br>Luffy also doesn't seem one to appreciate immortality very much, being a D, he accepts his fate.<br><br>That kind of just clicked with me as another ideological battle between him and Dofla.</br></br></br>  What do you reckon Kaidous laugh is gonna be?  <br>Strength? Fuck no.<br><br>Influence? Yes (since a lot of the other big players are just within another's sphere of influence whereas he is in charge of his own influence).</br></br></br>  <br>Kachinkchinkchinkchinkchink</br>  <br> strength <br>Don't think so<br>He's still weaker than Doffy and only won because everyone dogpiled on Doffy</br></br></br>  <br>Hyuk hyuk hyuk.</br>  <br>Azorzorzorzorzor</br>  <br>Yeah. Luffy wants to die with a smile and no regrets, not watch all his nakama age and die around him.</br>  <br>rah rah rah rah <br>or some kind of roar+laugh</br></br>  <br>reereereeree</br>  <br>Luffy and Brook will never know peace.</br>  What the mystery behind D and noble?  <br> brook will one day just let himself drown in the sea because of tiredness  <br>immortality is a horrible curse</br></br>  <br>Behind a regular D is probably an asshole, the noble are the ones that attained good behaviour.</br>  <br>Falling in the sea hasn't killed him yet though, and he doesn't have lungs so he can't drown. He'd just end up like Bootstrap Bill.</br>  <br>and?<br><br>Logia are their element all the time. Do you think their sperm is being changed with them or something?</br></br></br>  <br> sanji funeral procession <br>party it is</br></br>  <br>Nobles consider themselves holy, so I guess D stands for Demon/Devil? I'm pretty sure that the D bloodline must have been in the Word Noble's position before the Void Century and the WG is now desperate to stamp out any remnants of them.</br>  <br>I mean, if he can eat he probably can drown</br>  <br> "I've drunk enough alcohol to give myself Liver Poisoning.

To be fair though, he's never had to do the seastone cuffs thing to my memory but if he did, logically it would kill him.</br>  I want the main baddie on Elbaf to be one of those Oars type giants, only with a Devil Fruit. That would be pretty sweet.  <br>this makes me wonder<br>can giants master rokushiki?</br></br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Depending on the Devil Fruit, it wouldn't really be stronger than Oars (especially since Oars' resilience actually came from the fact he was a zombie) and the crew is well beyond Oars tier now.<br><br>Honestly, I don't see how any sort of Elbaf thing will work, it will have to just be an adventure arc. Giants are no longer a threat and its implied by someone like Hajrudin that nobody in Elbaf has Devil Fruits (or at least not powerful ones).</br></br></br>  <br> elbaf <br><br>it'll be a fairy half of chopper's size</br></br></br>  <br>because they are big and they can be more easily seen when moving fast</br>  <br>Shigan!

Every OP fan I know wets themselves for him but I don't get the appeal at all. He's just Ace 2.0 right now.<br><br>Koala is far superior.</br></br></br>  <br>Did Robin, Sabo, Robin, Koala and Robin ever have group sex?</br>  <br>  He's just Ace 2.0 right now. <br><br>Nah. <br><br>Sabo clearly is a bit more sadistic, unhinged than Ace and im sure when we see Sabo in the context of the Revolutionary Army 2nd in command rather than an older brother helping out his younger brother, the distinction will be clear.<br><br>Sabo has an entire backstory that sets him at odds with the WG and the World Nobles. Ace was just a pirate happily living in the shadow of another pirate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why wouldnt people be going crazy over Luffy's insane qt blondie of a brother?</br>  <br><br>The way Oda is writing him though, it just seems as though he's his playtoy. <br><br>Oda really couldn't get over killing Ace, could he.</br></br></br></br>  <br>chill on sabo hopefully we will get some development for him and dragon post arc</br>  <br>I dont really see where you are getting this from.<br><br>Already Sabo seems incredibly different to Ace in both personality and goals.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but they're both Luffy's big brothers and they have same fruit so that makes them the same!</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Sabo was always the most driven and unhinged out of the three. He set off to sea far earlier than Ace ever did and Sabo knows first hand how the nobels are allowed to treat regular folk due to the WG system.</br></br></br>  <br> other why's </br>  BONES new anime「コンクリート・レボルティオ 超人幻想」<br>Seiji Mizushima &amp; Shō Aikawa</br>  <br>Revolutio, I think.</br>  DtBfags BTFO  <br> Seiji Mizushima &amp; Shō Aikawa <br>Fuck yes! Say what you will about these guys but at least they make interesting anime unlike Igarashi and Enokido who can only do the same boring thing over and over again.</br></br>  <br> Mizushima has wanted to do a magical girl anime for ages <br>I wonder if this is going to be it?  Looks shit.  Like most his work  </br></br>  <br>Is that a guy with pink fluffy hair?</br>   Many animes and mangas make references to wrestling <br> Can't make a good wrestling anime or manga to save their lives  <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>because no one wants to watch MC-kun go through a training arc just to be told to throw the next match.</br>  Sekatsuyo was kind of entertaining. <br><br>Anyway, just watch the real thing. NXT is fine, but rest of WWE is crap. There's Lucha Underground too, and there's NJPW for weebs and enthusiasts.</br></br>  It's too gay.  The upcoming AOTY, Gangsta, is airing soon. Are you excited?  <br>Not really but I'm checking it out regardless.</br>  <br>Are you ready for worst anime of the season?</br>   Manglobe <br><br>My expectations are zero but i'll give it a watch</br></br>  I love the manga but I don't have high expectations of the anime.  God, this show is retarded, but fun.  <br>so now Sakura walks in on them doing the hug from behind maneuver? is this gag gonna end where sakura eventually walks in on them just outright fucking?</br>  Hey guys<br><br>I know we don't agree on things too often, but can we at least agree that Suou is the best DTB girl?</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Only because red hair and pantyhose  Who? I don't remember any girl named Suou.  Who? <br>I don't recall seeing such a character in all 26 episode of the series.</br>  <br><br> This denial  <br>Slav Kana a cute and Yin died.</br></br></br>  After avoiding S2 for years because of the "it doesn't exist" meme, I finally decided to watch it last week and  it was actually pretty good .  <br>It was  alright <br>That ending really is as bad as everyone makes it out to be though.</br></br>  <br>the only reason people like to pretend it doesn't exist is because there will never be a conclusion</br>  <br><br>I don't remember her in the OVA<br><br><br><br>I feel like Yin 'died' wouldn't be the issue If such a scenario happened..</br></br></br></br></br></br>  fuck no<br><br>yin is the best</br></br>  <br>The ending is absolutely balls. Powerless Hei and his new fighting style is great though.</br>  <br>What pisses me off about Suou is that she never used that rifle on anyone, while we got to sit through every one of those magical girl transformation sequences. That power is retarded to start with, I mean how did Hei's electricity turn into that?</br>  <br><br>This thread again. No no I hate arguing who is the best girl character in any given show but I can't stand by and agree with this statement in the slightest.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Who?<br><br><br>I'm sorry, I don't remember any of that happening. Yin and Hei ran away together from the Syndicate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>shit taste</br></br>  <br><br><br>The ending on the Hei side of things did piss me off a bit, it kind of necessitates a third season that I realize we'll probably never get. I thought the conclusion for Suou's story was good, though.<br><br>I don't know, I didn't expect the big problem to just be the ending. I've always heard people complaining about Hei being different in it, but it was immediately obvious there was a reason why he became the way he is at the start of the season, and I really liked how he slowly reverted to the way he used to be throughout. I also kept hearing complaints regarding the change in main character, so I expected Suou to be awful but I honestly thought she was pretty good.<br><br>I don't think it measures up to the first season but I thought it wasn't bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, also someone has the Yuki_ona_ass.jpg?</br>  Reminder  <br> implying we watched S2  <br>Horrible fucking season. they only even started to introduce an interesting character at the end.

Is this show any good? Worth watching? I heard it was like the chinese batman or something, wasn't really sure what to make of that.<br><br>Like I mean if it's west/clooney/kilmer batman, I'm fuckin down bro, but if it's some like srsbsns tryhard bale type deal, forget it.</br></br>  Suou is best girl  <br>yes suou bestest</br>  <br>Chinese Electric Batman<br><br>It's pretty fucking good, give it a go.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Who?</br></br>  <br>watch the first season</br>    <br><br>That artist is great, he really loves Suou.<br><br>Heard he died in the earthquake, can anyone confirm?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I just pretend it ended with the first season.</br>  <br>Training bra and pantyhose. This is something I needed.</br>  <br>Nice fanart.</br>  With the help of Sb69 and Kekkai<br>S4 SOON</br>    <br>Yea his first pixiv posts were of her and you can see how his art improves as he contributes for best girl.</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?id=1419371<br><br>his art for anyone interested</br></br></wbr></br>   #<br> &gt;Chinese Electric Batman <br><br>Hei isn't chinese<br>supervisor denies it in Japanese book.<br>Li Shenshun is false name, too.<br><br><br>Hei is Golgo13 clone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice try, Hei and his sister are both chinese</br>  <br>So he loses yin and gets a loli?</br>    I want to cook perumeni for her every day.  Yes. The season itself was shit but Suou was God-tier.  <br>Damn, this is one of the few fanbooks I'd like to own. <br><br><br><br> Who? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I would feel that way if it wasn't so different from the first season, on it's own, I think it could have stood as an okay show. But it's not a good follow-up to DTB imo.</br>  <br>Yes, he gets the best girl in DtB<br><br>  Everyone close to him dies, even the shota  </br></br></br>  <br> who? <br><br>A hero</br></br></br>    <br>You can't be best girl when you're dead.<br><br><br>We don't know if Yin is dead. Most probably fell into a coma.<br><br><br><br>Who?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What happened to the S3 hype by the way? You know that thing about the staff members twitter?  <br>She's not dead, she's on another planet, safe from the hellspawn Yin gave birth to after getting soul fucked by Shion.</br>  <br> Who <br>?</br></br>  <br><br><br>I'll check it out. Thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>Normally yes but she's in the same show as Yin so no.</br>  <br>There were a few things I liked about it as a follow up to DTB, like it showing the backstory to Mao who was the only one from the main cast who didn't get his backstory shown in S1.</br>    HEI HEI YOU YOU<br>I DON'T LIKE GIRLFRIEND!<br><br>NO WEI NO WEI<br>I THINK YOU NEED A NEW ONE!<br><br>HEI HEI YOU YOU<br>I COULD BE YOUR GIRLFRIEND</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Best Girl </br>    <br>The thing is it had to do with her collar, and plus everyone gets different powers. All though I must agree a rile for a power is just out of place compared to all the other powers.</br>    <br>No. Havok was.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Hei's commentary<br><br>岡村天斎「黒たちメンバーは、実は中国人ではありません。」 <br><br>岡村天斎「ええ、実は黒は中国の人ではないんです。 あの料理も、一生懸命覚えて中国人のフリをしているんですよ」 <br><br>This book is recommended, too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the trip who used to do this even around anymore?<br><br><br> Yin died <br>Except she didn't?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>I have no idea what that says.</br>  <br>how about Yin?</br>   All these pedophiles <br> Not preferring the smart qt 3.14 Christmas cake that has a stable job and is very loyal to you  <br><br>Suou is cute, but daily reminder Misaki is the best girl</br></br></br>  <br> Suou <br>Who?<br><br> Misaki <br>Acceptable taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not everyone is a nigger.</br>  <br>this fuckin guy gets it</br>  <br>After all of these years I still have no idea what that purple patch on the side of his face is.</br>  <br> s3 hype <br><br>It's kinda died down since we haven't received any kind of new speculative info since middle of march. It's been almost 4 fucking months since that cat was revealed on the BONES website and it still hasn't changed. A lot of people are thinking it's going to be Noragami but with all the new info out on the second season like key visuals and even a fucking air date you would think they would've changed it by now. But no, it's still fucking there. The hype will come back when there's some new stuff to talk about. Even Komori one of the head animators/char designers for DTB hasn't posted anything DTB related since March. So yeah, we're in the dark right now but I'm hoping something good will come out of it. My dream is to see a sticky on /a/ with the third season of DTB announced. Who knows, maybe with all the money BONES will get from sbr and KS it's possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Fake birthmark to throw off the feds.</br>    <br>That Chinese Neo was pretty badass.</br>  <br>Just shit like this is why I want more DTB. These fight scenes are so fucking GOAT.</br>    <br>She's cute</br>  <br>is that even possible?</br>  <br><br>I just checked it and it's still there. Goddammit bones, you would think with only 3 months until Fall that they would reveal what their last original anime is right? Don't they need to release the info ahead of time to start promoting and get people hyped? <br><br>Also I heard a while back that Tomoki Kyoda (director of E7 and AO) was going to be involved? Is this true and if so is there a credible source somewhere?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Hei and Yin ran away into that interdimensional shit and left a kid in the hell's gate</br>  <br>Why is Suou pure sex?</br>  Hei and I disagree.  Should we just kickstart DTB S3 like the Japanese did for shenmue 3?  <br>Yep, it's pretty good. The only bad thing about it is the insane ending. I think most people hate it because it's nothing like s1. It's very story driven compared to s1's episodicness. But I don't think that's a bad thing.</br>  <br>I'd wait until after DTB's 10th anniversary passes. We still got 2 years to hope.</br>  <br>S3 hype anon shut up after anime expo revealed it was just promotion.<br>There won't be any S3.</br></br>  <br> She's not dead, she's on another planet <br>clones don't count<br><br><br>What kind of OC is that?<br><br><br>Shouldn't you be on some Aquarion threads or something, instead of posting worst girl?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>tfw back then i didnt realized her VA is kanahana. and people keep saying she can only voiced same character</br>  Is it alright to take advantage of special needs girls?  <br><br>If their special need is a dicking, yes</br></br>  <br>Did Hei and her do it?</br>  <br>Yin is dead and was the stated outcome after she and Shion created satan</br>  <br>Souls exist in DtB, hers and quite a bit of others where shot into notEarth</br>  <br>I think they just hugged a lot.<br><br> Gaiden and Gemini sucked, should've quit while they were ahead. </br></br></br>  Suou &gt; average Rei clone &gt; Yin  Hei will die.<br><br>But his soul will chose to go back in time, the the time when he was happiest, and he will be at season 1 first episode.<br><br>Suou who loves Hei want to be with him too and want to be in a time when Hei'd love her, but since he already loves Yin she'll go back in time before Hei is born, and became his mother.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Suou is not only worst girl in her series, but is a contender for top ten worst girls of the decade.<br><br>She is shit in every department imaginable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How can that be true when Yin has more personality than either of them?<br><br>And that's saying something since Suou isn't even a real operator.</br></br></br>  <br> Yin has more personality <br>You gotta lay off the fanfiction</br></br>  <br>See, you would have a point there, except Yin got more developmental episodes than Suou did so you're not.</br>  <br> Going from a statue to a statue that cares about you and tries to show the little emotions she has like 3 times in the entire series. <br><br>Wow what development Even the shota doll developed more.</br></br></br>  seriously is there anything this girl can't do?

Second half was still fun, but it just felt a bit off to me. The elf MMO wasn't nearly as interesting as the original MMO, Kirito's fairy avatar sort of sucked and big titted sister wasn't nearly as likeable a sidekick as Asuna. It was nice to see Yui return and have a larger role though. <br><br>Death Gun arc is okay, but it's a bit disappointing that all the previous characters haven't really been doing much. Especially Asuna. I'm hoping she'll return to being the action chick she was instead of just the girlfriend who does nothing. <br><br>Also, what the fuck is up with Kirito's avatar in GGO? Hoping it'll be explained why it looks so feminine and how it's apparantly a rare character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> someone posts not-/a/ related pic <br> he must be a crossboarder!! <br>I've been here for 5 years, "oldfag", sorry not to fit in your delusions you have about /a/</br></br></br>  <br>this cancer infested /v/ and /g/ as well</br>  I almost killed myself during the S2 second arc.<br><br>I didn't learn from S1</br></br>  <br>/v/ has been cancer for years now, newshit.</br>  This scene was just bad and awkward. <br><br> Actual sex implication <br> Asuna confirmed slut <br> Virtual reality fucking period </br></br></br></br>  <br>2 YEARS OF SEMEN</br>  <br> Sleeping with your boyfriend makes you a slut </br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/filena<wbr>me/1429958174521.jpg/<br>I wonder why someone would bring 3DPD reaction images and their garbage memes to other boards and then pretend to belong to the board.</br></wbr></br>  <br> I've been here for 5 years, "oldfag", sorry not to fit in your delusions you have about /a/ <br>sure dude<br><br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real?</br>  <br><br> if you don't follow the rules you don't "belong" to /a/  <br>How does it feel being no fun allowed faggot?<br>Must be hard</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel World <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Nope.

Or more like sad.</br>  <br> I can take out 50 other players alone just because I'm that good! <br>This is bullshit<br><br> Kirito can take out 200 players alone because he wields Excalibur <br>That's at least slightly reasonable b/c we dont know stats of that weapon<br><br>but still<br> they clear 40 man dungeon in 5 because they're just that good <br><br>All decent MMOs copy WoW and they have berserk timers and they'd just get wiped for not having enough DPS. This entire show is fucking fake.<br><br>Good this I only watched it ironically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>iirc, character models are randomly pulled so that feminine looking model type is rare in terms of RNG for male avatars</br>  <br>This makes me happy.</br>  <br> a zerg rush of Korean and Chinese gamers <br>Fund it. Fund all of this. I will watch it.</br></br>  <br> Virtual reality that's controlled with actual body motions, has physics simulations and borderline atom-accurate hit detection <br> implying it'd be copying some 20 years old ancient shit like WoW anymore <br>hell, even the show said that Alfheim was all about personal skills and gear than levels. So it's not too farfetched for someone living in the VR world 24/7 to master all the tricks of the game and git gud.</br></br></br>  So who here got Progressive 2?  <br>I had mixed feelings about that arc.<br><br>Did they have to throw in all the drama to end the series on?</br></br></br>  <br> I can take out 50 other players alone just because I'm that good! <br><br>The gear she's using to dive is literally the best full dive gear that exists and she's spent more time in VRMMOs that the SAO survivors<br><br> Kirito can take out 200 players alone because he wields Excalibur <br><br>He ends up getting killed though. All he did was buy enough time for Asuna and friends to break through the party in their way and get into the boss room<br><br> this entire show is fucking fake <br><br>Fair point but they're bending the rules in order to help tell the story. Is it poor writing? Debatable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can write pages upon pages of what I found wrong with the characters and story, but as far as an action show goes it was pretty decent aside from some of the scenes in the gun arc. Although there was so much unintentional comedy during those scenes.</br>  <br> Any words on S3? <br>One of the producers said he'd like to see it animated. I guess that's a good thing?<br><br> Are the latest books translated yet? <br>All of them are translated...

Is it worth buying the console and game just to play?</br></br></br>  <br>buying a console for a single game is always bad idea IMO.</br>  <br><br>Grabbed it early a couple days ago, reading through it right now. Kirito is aware that he's autistic.<br><br> In the month that I'd been trapped in this castle, I'd been hell-bent on survival, on powering myself up through whatever means I could find. Had I ever even stopped to regret my decision to jump into Sword Art Online? <br> Regret would be the normal choice. Anyone who didn't regret getting stuck in here was insane. But no matter how far back I scrolled through my emotional event log, despite the presence of terror or homesickness, there were no hits for "regret." <br> So either I was insane, or the circumstances never gave me enough breathing room to even consider regretting my choice. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is this the shitposting general?   SAO lets you bathe dark elf NPCs <br><br>Man, even without the two years glopping, how were they allowed to sell this to kids?</br></br>  <br>Wasn't in the beta. Not even the glopping.<br><br>Once your game becomes a death game that traps its players, it doesn't matter who it sells to, you can put whatever you want in the final release.</br></br></br>  Seems like you can marry dark elf NPCs as well, if you have the permission of their queen.  <br> Marrying NPCs <br> In a game set to delete itself upon completion <br>Is it encouraging you to kill all the front-line players?</br></br></br>  <br>Laughing Coffin did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Speaking of,<br> Morte <br> It's Showtime <br><br>Man, they've been around since the third fucking floor.</br></br></br></br></br>  How much rape will season 3 feature?  <br>Some off-screen mind-rape, and then some very prim-and-proper double rape with fancy silk rope in a fancy bed, with just a few centimeters away from penetration.</br>  <br>Elegant rape isn't rape.</br>  Considering how Asuna treats NPCs in Progressive, I don't see any way for her reaching the point of using them as bait for the field boss.<br><br>Another retcon can't hurt that bad, I guess.</br></br>  <br>She will use her self sacrifice attack to save them from a boss or something in future floors I bet since she should have originally died anyways. This will be the sad moment.</br>  Seeing the Afterword mention volume 14, Eugeo and Alicization and what not is an odd feeling since the English volumes are still at 5.<br><br>Aria was confirmed for being written for the anime, but the content was twice the amount requested. I suppose the way it turned out couldn't be helped after all.</br></br>    forgot to clarify this is this recent episode of SAO where Sinon gets almost allegedly raped  Are there any more situations in the novels where Sinon openly flirts with Kirito?<br><br>That shit she pulled during that short thor arc was fucking perfect.</br></br>  <br><br>The butthurt is hilarious.</br></br>  <br>I'm honestly surprised someone didn't make something like this sooner.</br>  If they wanted this to be a harem anime, why'd Kirito get with Asuna so early in the series?  <br>Despite how shitty SAO is, that scene was really cute.</br>  <br>Oh, I haven't checked in on Toonami General since they got into the cave.</br>  <br>Well I only started doing it as I needed something to feel in the time between shows I didn't want to watch like naruto</br>  <br>Oh wait this is recent? Oh that makes it even better!</br>  <br>Here's 1 of 3 I made prior to this episode</br>      <br><br><br>I mean, people in the livestream chat where yelling, but I think they where just poking fun, Not genuinely upset like these seem to be.</br></br></br>  wait if sinion is an elf now<br><br>does that mean retroactively, she loved rape when she was a gunslinger?</br></br>  <br>But that's the beauty of it.</br>  <br>I think most of the people in those thread are shitposting around for the fun of it.</br>  <br> wait if sinion is an elf now <br>she's a cat. So no, basically, default Elf stuff does not apply.</br></br>  <br><br>dammit, saw people posting about everyone being elves now so i was wondering if sinion the cockmocker was an elf too</br></br>  <br>Oh god. I'm going to get very angry at the two assholes for the second bit</br>  <br>Cats are a type of elf in the game, aren't they?</br>  <br>well they can fly, but they act and look like cats.<br>so unless they go to heat, they don't enjoy the dickings.<br><br> poking a fire-arrow into your nostril </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Did the /a/ threads blow up as hard as these on the same episodes? All I seem to remember is a mixture of LN talk and ASADASAN memes, but the threads were pretty much dead by then compared to BULLET THROUGH OUTLET.</br></br></br>  <br> Alicization Exploding <br>My sides exploded</br></br>  <br>The /a/ threads were pretty slow from what I recall. S2 was barely noticed on /a/.</br>   play VRMMOs <br> get covered in bitches <br>I hope I don't get hit by a car before 2025</br></br>  <br>This fucking shit was so fucking predictable.I predicted every fucking scene before it happened. Including the lol tweest. Fuck this show. Nice animation yes but fuck this show.</br>  <br> s2 bombed <br><br> 20k average over 9 volumes is bombing <br><br>Nah, sales are still very strong. See you in s3.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The author wanted it to be an action-romance, with the first volume.<br>And then he decided to throw in a bunch of characters retroactively, as if he remembered all the light novel tropes he forgot about.</br></br>  <br>You wont, but you can't escape the stealthy nippon truck.</br>  <br>A 25-episode, well-paced Aincrad anime would've made a killing.</br>  <br>The Progressive spin-off didn't exist at the time, unfortunately. That said, even if it did, fully animated Progressive, from start to (unwritten) finish would be hundreds of episodes.<br>Hah...</br></br>  <br>ah, the death trucks and mysterious "weak body" illness... how I hate thee! I hope I won't catch that "summer cold" either.</br>  <br><br>You know what that reminds me?<br>The police in SAO is so useless that they can't even find out by themselves that some teenagers are invading some nerds houses and killing them while they are playing videogames.<br>I don't really remember if they make a excuse for that, but if it doesn't then that's some really stupid shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The idea was that they broke into houses that used older, mechanical locks and that their method of killing is the usual "barely traceable" method with injection being done via a device that doesn't require piercing the skin. Something like a injector that shoots it directly through the skin.</br>  <br>Picked up</br>   uses swords in a game any guns  <br> Death Gun has a weapon made of BATTLE SHIP METAL <br><br>Why did this show get a second season again</br></br></br>  <br>Because it sold like hot cakes, and the LN is in the top 10 LN sales.</br>  <br>So the police didn't check the bodies to see the cause of death, like, you know, poisoning?<br>I mean, if there's a way of injecting something into someone's body I would expect the police to consider that.</br></br>  <br>whatever was injected was the kind of chemical or whatever that would induce cardiac arrest or sth. The explanation was that it's hardly traceable if at all possible and the device that injects it leaves no marks</br>  <br>Succinylcholine doesn't show up on most blood tests, and is a bitch to detect.<br>An overdose on it WILL kill you, but not the way portrayed in SAO; instead you'll suffocate to death. Though there was one or two cases of cardiac arrest.<br><br>Basically, because the two victims they found were hardcore gamers who stayed logged in several days at a time, they figured that they probably just died from being stupid and not eating or exercising.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The explanation was that it's hardly traceable if at all possible and the device that injects it leaves no marks <br>I guess that's the easiest way to make an excuse for a perfect murder case then, almost to the point that the police would never find out if the retards didn't show to everyone that they were the murderers through the videogame.</br></br>  <br>The cops and everyone assumed they died of natural cause and that death gun was a hoax.<br>That pissed them off, so they took it a step further, and decided to kill people live.</br></br>  <br>Yep. Not the best writing but at least there was effort in making the "perfect crime"</br>  <br>Dunno, it kinda bothers me how some things are really technological while some others are faulty just for plot convenience.<br>I mean, it doesn't matter if those guy that died weren't rich and everything else, but I really doubt that the police wouldn't find out that someone broke in someone else's house.<br>I mean, even if somehow there weren't some big evidences of that, I guess they would have some surveillance cameras close to where the victims live.</br></br></br>  <br>The story doesn't bring much attention to it, but this future Japan is pretty scary. Some years ago, the government promoted using electronic locks, which were "super secure", so that police and medical personnel can easily break in, using a pass that opens all the locks.<br>The two brothers' parents own a hospital, thus getting that sort of key let them break in without anyone's notice.<br>Of course, they made sure that the person had the right kind of lock to begin with, before committing the murders.<br><br>Basically, big brother knows where you are at all times, and can get to where you live whenever it feels like it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but it sold well enough</br>  <br>I think it was something along the lines of their being "input lag". Yuuki, having lived in VR for 3 years has the least input lag, which directly correlates with having a better reaction in SAO. <br><br>This also kind of explains why the team of SAO survivors can clear dungeons better than niggas who weren't imprisoned in VR for 2 years.</br></br></br>  <br>it's partially because she's been in VR for 3 years but also largely because the equipment she's diving with his more advanced than both the nervgear and amusphere<br><br>Kirito even makes a point to say that with her reaction speed, she would've inherited the Dual Blades skill in SAO, which was supposedly reserved for the fastest player. That's what tips him off to where Asuna can find her later on iirc</br></br></br>  <br>There was actually two simple explanations given in the show:<br><br>1) the mystery drug injected through the pressure syringe<br>2) the bodies were found several days, sometimes weeks after their deaths, technically rendering most evidence useless on untraceable.<br><br><br>You might be correct.<br>It could also be the simple fact of getting completely used to the game and thus getting into the "flow" better. I personally have experienced something similar in online multiplayers years ago, getting that fascinating high where you don't need to stop and think anymore, and everything seems to just work fluently just as you want it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   An American got on the Japanese server of GGO <br> Entered a BoB tournament with a knife/handgun <br> Won <br> Americans banned on Japanese servers from then on <br><br>This never makes not laugh. Japs shit at FPS.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> glop glop </br>  <br> banned <br> proxies in  <br> fights unarmed <br> still kicks everyone's ass with probably ridiculous ping <br>Can't stop the freedom. <br><br><br>If nothing else, we can blame everything on how being a guild officer robbed her of all cheerfulness and enjoyment. <br> muh immersion <br><br> &gt;responding to posts from 5 hours ago </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>While it was probably a mistake on the author's part, it would not be without precedent for the police in Japan to write a suspicious death off as "heart failure", so that they don't need to investigate, and it doesn't go down in the books as a murder in their jurisdiction: <br>http://articles.latimes.com/2007/no<wbr>v/09/world/fg-autopsy9<br><br><br>They cased the houses/apartment of their potential victims to pick either victims that hid a spare key near their door, or used the older model of the electronic lock that  talks about. Said older model did not keep logs of the usage of the "emergency" key. So there'd be no signs of forced entry. It's best to assume that "no inconvenient security cameras" were included in their evaluation of which targets to go after.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  Kibaou is a pretty cool guy, I can see how he got into Lost Song.  <br>See where you went wrong is you applied logic to a show that doesn't have much logic to begin with. They literally put 50 thousand people to sleep in order to fully integrate them into a video game world and gave them no way to leave in case of an emergency LIKE WHAT ENDED UP HAPPENING!<br><br>And I get it. That part of the series had stakes and thats why it was half decent but not we've got two seasons of just compounded awful. Its staggering, just staggering.</br></br></br>  <br>if you'd bother to read the thread / watch or read the series, you'd notice that there's a decent, simple explanations for all that.</br>  <br>It's from the Web Novel. It might be changed for the Light Novel.</br>  <br>I did watch the show. I was drunk but I was paying attention enough. I shouldn't have to read extra material in order to understand whats going on on screen. Its just lazy ass writing.</br>  <br>Its actually real?<br><br>I want off the sao wild ride.</br></br></br>  <br> FPS <br> not Metal Gear <br>Really though he sounds like Big Boss, given that his real job is a mercenary for hire.</br></br></br>  <br>You were paying enough attention to get the number of people wrong and to not accept the basic premise of the first arc. You're still stuck in "How does the Japanese safety board allow this?" mode. The threads have long since moved past MICROWAVE HELMETS. Keep up.</br>  <br>But GGO is run by an American company...</br>  <br>I dunno why Kawahara didn't just use potassium. It would bring about the cardiac arrest he wants, and cell lysis after death normally deranges blood potassium levels so it would not be unusual to find it in blood tests at autopsy.</br>  <br>I still find that dumb. I don't care where the "hip threads" are in their discussions. I just use that as an example of how this series kind of just leaps from common logic and why the police are useless in season 2. The minute you throw out your willing suspension of disbelief toward the end of season 1 or hell even earlier when the big head in the sky said no one can log off, the series just improves by quite a bit, like a good kinda bad really. Thats why I'd watch another season of this wreck, this and index no doubt I would love another season.</br>  <br><br>But doesn't Chrysheit say later that they have security cameras all over Tokyo scanning the faces of all passersby? They couldn't find out who was in the vicinity of both victims houses prior to the murders?</br></br>  <br> slut <br>how so? kirito was the only guy she ever tried to sleep with and he was her boyfriend</br></br>  <br>Potassium hurts and burns like a mofo. They'd very easily wake up from its injection. <br><br>Succinylcholine-induced cardiac arrest is actually due to high potassium, but that's really rare. <br><br>Succinylcholine-induced suffocation will kill you but like potassium injection, you will most certainly wake up from not being able to breathe. You can't fight back because you're paralyzed, too. All things considered, sux is a pretty good drug to use in a "perfect crime" scenario. What they got wrong was the whole "heart attack" thing. <br><br><br>In general, it's a pretty good idea to suspend your disbelief while watching anime. SAO S3 would inevitably alternate between boring you and infuriating you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Does it matter if they wake up or not?<br>Uh, I guess they could prime them with propofol or midazolam if they want them to stay quiet while they die.</br></br>  <br>SAO S2 was boring and infuriating for me. I finally started "enjoying" the badness around around the mid season point. Believe me I try to suspend my disbelief but the show needs to meet me half way at least SAO just isn't there in the slightest. <br><br>It cracks me up you guys think the writer is some kinda chemist. As if he even considered that shit.</br></br></br>  Why was literally every character in GGO so absolutely fucking pants on head retarded throughout the entire fucking arc in its entirety?  <br><br>Oh, wait, they'd find sedatives on blood tests. Never mind. So why was it important they don't wake up?</br></br>  <br><br>It matters because otherwise there might have been signs of a struggle.</br></br>  <br> propofol or midazolam <br>Propofol may not be routinely checked, but you can bet your ass benzos would be checked for on tox screen at autopsy. <br><br>Sux is great for its ridiculously short half-life. <br><br>As an aside, the way in which Kirito is shown to be "dying" (i.e. heart rate slowly getting slower until arrest) is probably going to be most consistent with potassium or calcium poisoning. <br><br><br>An awake victim is a victim who'll fight back. Signs of struggle is sure to raise suspicion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its like reading an episode of house. What is going on in this thread?  <br>Shhh. Busy killing catgirls.</br>  Sinon best girl  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3uO<wbr>N7ANNOi4</wbr>  [ ]  <br> You will never lick Sinon's asshole </br>  <br>That confirms one thing for me. I remember thinking that this series must have been a nightmare for anyone currently taking mmos "seriously".<br><br>If only the guy had another view point or at least someone else to discuss it with. Early on he seems to make a lot of valid points I agree with which is surprising. I'm shocked someone on youtube can actually sit down and look at SAO with a subjective view point.</br></br></br>  <br> The police in SAO is so useless that they can't even find out by themselves that some teenagers are invading some nerds houses and killing them while they are playing video games. <br>Japanese police are pretty shit at their jobs so it's pretty true to life.</br></br>  <br> perfectly fine SAO thread <br>That's a good one.</br></br>  Sorry but SAO has to be one of the worst anime I've ever watched.<br>I was perfectly fine with it existing until it's young, obnoxious fanbase starting parading it as the most "epic" anime they'd ever seen.</br>  <br>Damn. I haven't seen a newfag be this much of a tryhard in a while.</br>  <br>You hated it because it popular then.<br><br> Fanbase <br>It's not like the other fanbase are doing the same right?</br></br></br></br>  <br> caring about fanbases off of /a/ </br>  <br> You hated it because it popular then. <br>Are you implying that /a/ doesn't just hate popular anime because it's popular?</br></br>  <br>Who gives a fuck. Everyone has watched a couple of bad shows. Cry about it. Fuck fan bases too, who fucking cares?</br>  <br>/a/ is not one person.</br>  <br>Well, he just did said you are just like most of /a/.</br>  <br> You hated it because it popular then. <br>You know what, you're absolutely right. OniAi sucked too, but it doesn't infuriate me because it's regarded by most people as being anywhere from mediocre to bad and it gets exactly as much respect as it deserves. SAO gets much, much more, and its massive undeserved success has caused other people to try and imitate Kawahara to try and cash in on the craze that he caused. SAO's existence is actively harmful to the medium as a whole.</br></br>  <br>Well it wouldn't exactly be on anyone's radar or gotten a second season if it weren't popular. <br><br>The ridiculous amount of hype it gets from people who have seen like three anime in their life is what elevates it into being worth watching and complaining about on the internet on a "so bad it's good" basis.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It isn't just that,she uses medicuboid,which is better.<br> amusphere=single core <br> nervegear=duel core <br> medicuboid=quad core <br> STL=hexacore </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How is nerve-gear still a thing at this point.<br>That shit would have been shutdown indefinitely after what happen in the first season.</br></br>  Good, they should ban you too fucking newfag.  <br>It's partially exaggerated...<br>Is what I want to say, but the only parts that are off is some numbers, and the fact thta PoH and Vector aren't NSA agents, but mercenaries hired by them.<br><br>On that note <br> Light novel <br> changing anything </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So can we just assume/pretend that the Death Gun trio had a lot of potassium mixed with their Succinylcholine, or some shit?</br>  <br> All decent MMOs copy WoW and they have berserk timers and they'd just get wiped for not having enough DPS. This entire show is fucking fake. <br>you clearly don't remember when paladins used to be able to solo raids</br></br>  <br>Thats not how mmo's work m8.<br>On Ragnark for example, if you did everything right you could solo mvps while other people needed a full party</br></br>  <br>Supposedly, the WN had Sinon bisect Kirito with her own lightsaber instead of the grenade suicide.</br>  Is Progressive the official canon now?  <br>It just works, like cape comic canon.</br>  <br>SAO has changed nothing that was plot relevant. Usually a few scenes that don't change much.<br><br>Eugeo became an Integrity Knight?<br>That's nice—in the very next volume the timeline syncs up with the web novel, and he dies in the exact same way.<br><br><br>Kawahara considers both canon, but acknowledges that Progressive contradicts some parts of the main series—just consider these contradictions as retcons.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So if progressive can recon the original doesn't that make it the official canon then?</br>  <br> Game anime <br>Boring genre. Uninventive self-insert shit. Only faggots from /v/ without taste likes this type of anime. Mods did well in deleting your low-quality thread, OP.

The world and character designs were all perfect. I would love a non-VR MMO with the same kind of structure and setting. Is there any plan for a SAO game set in that part of the series?</br></br>  <br>As far as P3 is concerned it's only covering the 4th floor. It lists all the floors the book will be covering at the start, no 9th floor mentioned, so nope.</br>  <br>Rghit, but the quest he's on will last until around the 9th floor. That anon was saying Kirito gets to bathe with Kizmel until that time.</br>  <br>Glopping</br>  <br>I get you now, I thought he was saying they were bathing on the 9th floor.</br>  <br>That position gives a really good feeling</br>  <br> this sword of mine is made from a space battleship! </br>  <br>You never know, if Occulus Rift and the like are successful, we may have something similar to what's in SAO 10 years from now.</br>  <br> To defeat them the main characters get 2,000 Japanese VRMMO players to connect. Despite the difference in numbers the Japanese are superior and win because Asian gamer damashii. <br>but the entire GGO jap players got punked by one american with a pistol, they're obviously not prepared</br></br>  <br>I really don't see the problem with having a sword made from a metal that was clearly designed to withstand weapons meant to take down most ships.<br>It's a fictional video game that takes place on a wasteland built around the crashed remains of a spaceship.</br></br>  <br>That's actually misleading.<br>The Japanese ended up importing their high-level characters, while the thousands upon thousands of koreans were all level 1.<br><br>The koreans still won though, so that copy-pasta still has some errors.<br><br>Also, Kirito killed them all with his god-level account, using an ice sword.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because SAO is shit.<br><br>/a/ went to shit recently allowing so many Dragon Ball, SAO and Naruto threads.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I want the full body immersion. Goggles are just one aspect of it, and they're distracting because you can feel the heavy ass things on your head - and using a controller or keyboard completely takes you out of the illusion.<br><br>The kind of stuff that makes the SAO world look so desirable is probably in all respects impossible in real life. You would have to interface with the brain in ways that can't even begin to make sense.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The kind of stuff that makes the SAO world look so desirable is probably in all respects impossible in real life. You would have to interface with the brain in ways that can't even begin to make sense. <br>No, it's quite possible. The technology just isn't affordable. Also, there's a ton of ethical issues created too, that would get it shut down.</br></br>  Evil released the first spoiler of the last chapter. <br> After Salada and her parents speak with each other, it turn out that Karin really is her mother, but (in the last chapter) we get no explanation of what actually happened. We don't hear why Karin's kid lives with Sakura nor why Sasuke says that he loves Sakura instead of Karin the mother of his child. And it's unlikely that the movie will elaborate on it, because it's about Boruto, so Kishi kind of left us without any explanation besides confirming again that Karin is the mother. </br>  Mods?

From a crush on this creepy, weird guy through the first few three books, to falling for him all over again across the next few books, then finally the last bit of volume 8 where she "confesses" again and tries to comfort him after the twitter gambit.

If she had any status quo filler scenes it would undermine the significance of her valentine's scenes.<br><br>The fact that she disappeared until the next volume in all likelihood means that Watari has something big to capitalize on it when she shows up next volume.<br><br>Really, the fact she disappeared is actually good for her.

He knows he has to put them together to make spinoff spawn but clearly doesn't fucking want to and regrets it, considering how Sasuke brutally rejected Sakura, then later when he was in a better mood gently pushed her away. Then he's just ignored Salad and Sakura for 12 whole years.  <br>To start with consider how most of the porn had Pinkshit as the main girl.<br>Now throw in the fact that regardless of the series everyone always expects the tsundere main girl to win (despite the fact that Sakura is not in any way shape or form tsundere, she just does the Comic Effect Girl Slap) and how fucking rare it is for a best girl to win, especially in this genre.<br>Add some morons falling for the parallels red herring, and you have quite a number of people.</br></br></br>  <br>It's fucking Naruto. He could've found a way to forgive Hitler.</br>  <br>Well it's not really Naruto's place to be angry at sauce. If Salad and pinkshit can forgive him and be ok with everything, then naruto doesn't really have a reason to be angry. Sauce didn't really cheat on Naruto.<br><br>As for giving full custody to Bort, that would be stupid of nardo yes. Though it's possible he just meant 'protect my son while I'm dead'. We'd need to see the movie to get all the context.<br><br> Also dadruto isn't going to die ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  Will editor-kun give us the 1st page preview this month?  <br>I'm not saying a titan would eat it. If it stayed there it would've been picked up by someone clening the place.</br>  <br>Probably. Either way I doubt it's important.</br>  <br> if we have Krista it should make the search much easier <br>Sounds like they thought having Hisu would help them find the coordinate, not that she is the coordinate.</br></br>  <br> mfw there's actually a doujin of it <br>Shit, I was just joking.</br></br>  <br>It was burnt along with the rest of the bodies. <br>That bone shard Jean was holding when crying about Marco was actually from Eren's arm.</br></br></blockquote>]
