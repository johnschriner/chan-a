Same reason. Not all japs are drones.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The real question is how the hell did a low selling manga get an anime adaptation</br></br>  <br> cancel'd </br>  <br>So this... is the power... of anime...</br>  <br>Chapter 36 translation where?

Even though this is published on Kirara Forward, it's a bit different from their usual stuff, so they needed to promote it to people who don't read that magazine.</br>  Pre-season I made a thread of which manga is going to get the most explosive boost. Guess that solves the question. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127624294 <br><br><br>Well yeah, headlines like "100x more!!" are always misleading in any kind of situation because more often than not the initial value was low to begin with.

It’s true to some extent — only 1 percent of Steam gamers are coming from Japan. But add zombies into your game and suddenly you’re looking at 4.5 percent of Japanese players, even before proper localization! So if your game has zombies, don’t forget about a Japanese localization and some marketing there. </br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Rii will find her real sister. <br>She's dead though.</br></br>  <br> implying getting eaten with the one you love isn't romantic </br>  <br>No</br>  <br>She doesn't exist. Only in Cathat's mind. If you are gonna go delusional and imagine your classmates are alive, you could make them cool looking you know?</br>  They will take care of Megu-nee in ep 3 right?<br>But she is already in her grave as we've seen in Ep1. S<br>o they will cover it as a flashback? I hope not as It'd be a really bad move, it'd take so much away than the actual thriller. Bu then it wouldn't make sense to be a grave on the roof.<br>so how do you think they will care of it?</br></br></br>  <br>Yuki, stop posting on internet. You are supposed to not having internet. Stop using your denpa.</br>  <br>I don't think its sounds romantic at all.<br>It sounds just plain gruesome. <br><br><br>Megu-nee is still in the basement. The grave is just a memorial, there's no body there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This series has some of the most chuuni characters ever. Their dedication to their fantasies is inspiring.</br>  <br>And then they'll wake up. And remember their life is still hell</br>  <br>Doesn't seem to be just a random noname backstory character from cathat delusions, and even if she was, didn't appear in the manga</br>  <br> denpa </br>  <br>She was beautiful, wish we'd see more of her before she went diejoubu</br>  <br>The memorial was there in chapter 4. We don't know what they did with Megu-nee's body but they didn't need to drag it to the roof.</br>  <br> &gt;Megu-nee is still in the basement. The grave is just a memorial, there's no body there. <br>I seriously thought they decided to bury her corpse on the roof.<br>So it was just a memorial? But still they only made it after killing Megu-nee, no? So as things stand it doesn't make sense to make a memorial for Megu-nee when they don't even now what happened to her.<br>Also her cross and her white ribbon were placed on her grave as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And then, /a/ is going to start shitting on it.

I think at that point it obvious to assume she's dead jim. Also um guessing the ribbon was just left lying around in the bedroom or something.</br></br>  <br>Made it before they killed her. Had a cross and ribbon on it, too. After they killed her they put her cross necklace on it. Probably didn't drag her through all the zombies, up all the stairs, and over all the barricades to actually bury her there, though.</br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  <br>They know perfectly well what ahappened to her. She came back and tried to get inside while turning, just to remember that she had to do something for the girls.  Ironically, that sense of duty she managed to retain was what almost killed one of her dear students. </br>  <br> Not using dead people as fertilizers </br>  <br>let's enjoy the honeymoon while it lasts</br>  <br>For Jap timezone?<br>Anyways please spoil me, as I might forget about doing it.</br></br>  <br>They made it after they lost her.<br><br>They stayed in the basement so they had to move her body.</br></br></br>  <br>This is one of those things that only happen in Japan.

Whether infected or not is another question, but he's real.</br>  <br> it doesn't make sense to make a memorial for Megu-nee when they don't even now what happened to her. <br>They knew very well what happened to her, even managed to get her necklace before she completely turned.</br></br>  You laugh at me when I say everything will be daijoubu.

Only had the ribbon on there before.</br>  <br>Thanks man.</br>  I found the reason Taroumaru hates Miki. This is the cover page of chapter 29.  <br>No it checks your local time. You could probably change the time in your PC and look at it. I posted an image in another thread will post when I get to my pc.</br>  <br>Oh you will laugh anon, you will laugh at your stupidity when you thought for even a second it was daijoubu. A laugh of absolute despair.</br>  <br> Risking infection <br>Alpha strain had something to do with mushrooms. using bodies for fertilizer is just making a petri dish.</br></br>  <br>also worth posting</br>  <br>Well, in America, reading is for faggots.</br>  <br>There seems to be a cross necklace on it already </br>  <br>He hates pictures?</br>  <br>Depressed Rii is so hot.</br>  <br>and because I cut it off for some reason, here's night Kei<br><br>the student + teacher picture is just a blank, dark hallway.</br></br></br>  <br>Well if everything actually goes daijoubu, I won't care about you laughing at me</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Thanks anons.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm more than sure that she just left them lying around in the bedroom. I mean the girls never even saw her after she turned as she almost instantly headed for the basement.</br>  <br>That's the point of anime adaptions. They're supposed to advertise the source material.</br>  <br>I laugh now then.

Will shovel become a cute wife?  <br>It's too soon to tell. Wait till pic happens, then you be the judge.</br>  <br> after <br> shovel <br>Anon.</br></br></br>  Should I read the manga now or wait until the season finishes so i can still have the suspense while watching the anime. I mean, from what i understand, the anime has changed a few things from the manga (so it can presumably have some sought of ending). And it looks like the kind of "taking away thongs from the manga" changes, so i'de likely still get stuf from the manga.  <br>Read it now.</br>  <br>This is great, but the switch should happen a bit faster. People might click away first.</br>  What's the biggest manga boost from an anime? FMA? SnK?  <br>Pic related.</br>  <br>They are pretty close.</br>  <br>Nobody said it was but it almost certainly isn't being funded by the studio. They are both manga adaptations and the primary source of funding for these is the publisher of the respective manga and they will have separate budgets and commitments based on that. You wouldn't be using the money you were paid as a studio to do one job to do another unless you wanted to face serious legal implications. To say that studio "wasted all the budget" from one show on another is a situation highly unlikely to have occurred and what is more likely if anything along these lines is that they were originally given a low budget by their respective production committees.</br>  Hat girl is going to get everyone killed, Or at least she would in real life. I was cringing at her level of autism. I wanted to smash her head in with best girl's shovel.  <br>assassination classroom, kekkai sensen, Arslan senki</br>  <br>You haven't read the manga, have you?</br>  Ten times is not really a boost considering how low were the manga sales to begin with. Still seems like the anime is doing a good job.  <br> not liking cathat <br>How do you manage to survive without any taste?</br></br>  The manga is mediocre. You can see the mangaka started padding and prolonging the story for the sake of prolonging after the anime was announced. It relies on "my cute girls are suffering, how terrible" too much.<br><br>I still recommend you to read it though. It's only 37 chapters. Then you'll see for yourself that It is nothing to fawn over. I do have higher hopes for the anime. Hoping the mangaka will go for an anime original ending.</br></br>  <br>Rii-san keeps her delusions in line with their actual missions and they always keep her with someone else outside of the safe rooftop and 3rd floor. She also knows to avoid contact with zombies when they come close.</br>  <br> cat-hat <br> Not a based hero <br>She will save the world and we all know it.</br></br></br>  <br>She just wants to have tanoshii</br>  <br>no one dies right?</br>  <br>I couldn't find it<br>you can copy paste here I guess<br>here is the link </br></br></br>    <br> I do have higher hopes for the anime.  <br> Hoping the mangaka will go for an anime original ending. <br>Are you reading the literal shit you're typing or it makes you too nauseous?</br></br></br>  <br> </br>  Is Yuki at all aware of her delusion?  <br>You know anime original ends are usually shit, right?</br>  <br>No, she believes they're real until she snaps.</br>  <br>As of the anime?<br><br>Not at all, she's full blown crazy.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, I think ultimately ending the story in someway is better then leaving it without an ending.<br><br>And I find, make me want to read the manga more aswell.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not going to be an original anime end, it's going to end at the graduation?</br>  <br>But what if the anime only ending is actually a bad end?</br>  <br>Its mixed opinions at this point.<br>There's nothing to directly tell us if she was aware the whole time or if she really was crazy the whole thing. Most people will tell you she was crazy the whole thing but its all baseless.</br></br>  <br>She at no point showed she knew they were fake.</br>  <br> shovel <br> cute wife <br>Hahahahaha<br>Enjoy your dead waifu</br></br></br></br>  <br> taking away thongs from the manga <br>If anything, they're adding thongs to the anime.</br></br>  <br>Most of the changes are not bad and them seem to just start the manga after Miki joined them. They might take care of the group finding them in a flashback or whatever.<br>I see some anons complaining about the cowering part but Megu-nee not leaving her in a time of crisis makes much more sense than leaving her all alone as Megu-nee is Yuki's coping mechanism.</br></br>  <br>This girls always make me suspicious as fuck, why the author would give her a face and a little storyline with it, it just dosent make sense. I think the author wanted to make a story line with her but the editor crossed it out or something, its just plain weird how she existed ans how she died. Also theres the fact that she was in a shelter similar to the one in school.<br>Theres a lot of shelters spread to japan or waht?</br></br>  <br>And she also at no point showed she knew they were real.<br><br>As i said there's nothing to tell us what was actually going on in her head.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you know Singeki no Kyoujin or Eotena Onslaught supposed to be low selling manga?</br>    <br>Those boostS are ridiculous compared to FMA and SnK</br>  I'm glad this is finally getting some attention, the TL threads every so often were fun though  <br>At first I thought she wasn't aware about her own delusions.<br>But the recent chapters have made me doubt this. She is like that retard that keep the group glue together and her delusions actually made everyone go through a tough ordeal by doing school life activities. It might well be done on purpose.</br></br>  <br>There is no way to finish an zombie anime in an original ending easily.<br>People don't enjoy anime original endings anymore and in this work it's either you let them survive by having the military or something reaching them or get them infected and let them die.<br>Sounds like problematic eaither way.</br></br></br>  <br> Most of the changes are not bad and them seem to just start the manga after Miki joined them. They might take care of the group finding them in a flashback or whatever. <br>Most of the changes are not bad and they seem to just start the anime after Miki joined them. They might take care of the group finding her in a flashback or whatever.</br></br>  <br> fun though <br>How? the translator dumped and then we discussed for about 30 posts than the thread died.<br>And that went on for about 4 months, there was nothing good about those threads. <br><br>Besides the chapters were things happened, those we're fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone has any info on this?</br>  <br> Hey guys what's going on in this thre- </br>  <br>The radio girl and pilot pretty much showed how the vaccine doesnt work.</br>  Yuki is cute and all but I'm not ready for the inevitable despair episode where her delusion comes crashing down.  <br><br>She became aware of it. This is pretty much Yuki faking that she still believes in Megu</br></br>   inb4 they akame ga kill it by the end of the show   <br>Do we have numbers?<br>And well if GG can't even go over 100k for the manga then all the hype is for nothing I'd assume.<br>60k for max is nowhere enough but it will keep selling for a good while though. Especially if Ep3 and Ep4 deliver it.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think it needs to be as pull a switch as that.<br><br>Something fitting i think would be something like everyone but Yuki dying and her surviving, thinking that nothing bad happened (or atleast convincing herself that), but thats maybe being to hopeful.<br><br>But i dont think theres much of a good way to end it on a "read the manga" note given what they've already changed to, so they are going to have to create some conclusion... even if its not really a conclusion and atleast a "and things kept going" ending</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because Lerche is based that's why</br>  <br>I don't know, this makes things confusing as fuck.</br>  <br> People don't enjoy anime original endings anymore <br><br>Got some examples to back that up? As far as I know there are just as many anime original endings these days as before. Gakkou Gurashi actually has a good chance of following the manga to graduation because that's an ideal chapter to cover for an anime finale, but there are still many manga that don't have such a good stopping point, hence the original endings.</br></br></br>  <br>But we never see her inject herself or any sign that she was infected. We are just assuming that she was infected or a zombie breaktrough and got her</br>  <br> zombie breaktrough and got her <br>Zombie never broke in. She locked herself in and turned while writing her last letter.</br></br>  <br>I really hope her VA can pull it off.</br>    Why is this manga so comfy?  <br>She probably became aware of it when she broke down during the cleaning, before the graduation.</br>  <br>Because it can be.</br>  <br>I only remember Kono naka ni imouto ga iru getting criticized for doing anime only end right now, but we know that the anime studios try to avoid doing anime only ends for various reasons, no?<br>And people purely not wanting them is a part of those reasons I think.</br></br>  <br>Aw shit anon you are right, i forgot that little detail, Still i think she was kinda wierd in the way she was portraid, also kurumi will be daijobou right?  ;_; </br>  <br>At first she for sure wasn't aware, but later on she's faking it for the group, by staying crazy she's keeping the groups morale up.<br><br>Well at this point it's only Rii-san that needs/needed it.</br></br></br>  In the least thread, the results were disappointing but let me ask it again.<br><br>We are all like Rii r-right?</br></br>  <br>because anime is mostly advertisement for the material that gets adapted</br>  <br> la especia debe fluir <br><br><br>That's undeniable. What I posted is from before.</br></br></br></br>    <br> comparing this with Shit-On </br>  <br>Rii is getting worse and worse.<br>Mii and Ayayaya go well with each other.<br>Yuki is turning up to be the group talisman.<br>Rii is dragging the whole group down with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think she actually became fully aware of the situation and her delusions later on, when she woke up at night and saw Kurumi's bed empty. Meeting the zombie just sparkled the whole thing.</br>  <br> Do we have numbers? <br>It's too soon. We will have to wait for the next oricon ranking (next wednesday) to see if it was enough to put the volumes in the top 50 or the franchise in the top 10.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi has such lewdly cute casual clothes. Pic related are still the best outfits though</br>  <br>This part was actually fairly strange. If Kurumi is bound to eventually turn or die, then it would still have been a good choice for the pilot to use the vaccine (unless he destroyed it accidently) since it would have bought him a few more days (enough to save the girls and come back to the base), same for radio girl, a few more days can't hurt.<br>We can also rule out the vaccine being so ineffective that they need to take it on a regular basis (everything was in order in radio girl's shelter). <br><br>There are two options :<br>1.Kurumi is the exception to the rule, she had a lot of luck and the vaccine worked enough to save her and most of her humanity.<br>2.Pilote-kun and radio girl were infected by a mutation of the virus, against wich the vaccine is ineffective (wich wasn't Kurumi's case).<br>3.Infected people using the vaccine actually transform them into something worse than a zombie.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you will never snuggle with a shovel in her sleeping bag <br><br>Why even life?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why would anyone like some crazy tittymonster?</br></br>  <br>She's cute and I'm excited to see her descent to insanity and suffering.</br>  <br>How is anyone confused what happened? Yuki snapped and became sane after killing the zombie. She ran through the halls echoing her intro speech and recognized what things were really like. But Yuki already knew her smiling was important to the group. Their dynamic had been shifting sinc the crash where Rii collapses and has to rely on Yuki; only Rii's recent delusions that really show it off, Yukio is willing to play pretend with Ruu because Rii did the same for her.</br>  Why does Megu-nee (and he others, but especially her) look like a middle schooler?  Guys, what if it ends like this:  They all wake up and realise it was a dream from before they got infected and turned into zombies. The manga then turns into 'cute zombies do cute things' with absolutely no suffering   <br>I like her the most.<br><br>You are not alone.</br></br></br>  <br>I was referring to before and after manga sales for SnK.<br>It was really popular before the anime as well but I wanted to see how much sales it gained thanks to the anime.</br></br>  <br> cute zombies do cute things <br>The only problem I have with this idea is that I'm pretty sure that zombies don't dream.</br></br>  <br>Because it's cute.</br>  <br>   they were just recounting their lives <br>I don't know if I could handle it.</br></br>    <br>Dreaming, recalling, just going back to previous memories in some way. At least early on it was clear that Megu-nee could remember stuff from when she was human</br>  <br>    absolutely no suffering <br>Fucking garbage</br></br>  <br>I think the pilot was infected and under the medicine, but then the zombie symptoms started kicking back in he attempted to take another dose to keep going but instead ended up crushing the syringe by accident and turned.<br><br>We can assume that all the trembling are the first symptoms of turning, the pilot was quickly losing control.</br></br></br>  <br>Gakkou Gurashi is a literal noname manga pre anime unlike some of the more popular kirara title like gochiusa. Contrary to popular believe, manga time kirara has a very low circulation rate and Gakkou Gurashi is in one of the less popular kirara offshoot.<br><br>I doubt the producers even expected it to be the most talked about show this season. I mean studio lerche? Literally who?</br></br></br>  <br>Megu nee noblonger appears when Yuki talks to her?</br>    <br> 'cute zombies do cute things' </br>  <br>You make it damn difficult, Kurumi.</br>  <br>We don't know how long they've been infected</br>  <br>No one needs to find out if you're not going to tell anyone.</br>  <br>Megunee was never there through the other girl's eyes. That's not what's happening here though. Yuki isn't asking Megunee because she doesn't see her anymore. Yuki's time isn't stopped.</br>      <br>I think it's the 3rd, maybe making infected people a better version of humans that can co-live with zombies and not die as easily. From there, it's only a matter of time until all of the GGs do that to themselves to avoid being killed by zombies.</br>  <br>Please nibble gently.</br>  <br>¿Cómo puede ser tan perfecta?</br>  Is it true that one of the girls becomes a zombie and is also a lesbian?

Don't take SnK's boost for just a "big" boost, it was a once a decade success.<br><br>A 20k boost would be a success for GG, and since the first episode is going viral this number is not unreachable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They will cover it as well.<br>I fucking hope they will deliver it and it will be really popular  even among the japfags &amp; normies as they are the ones to buy shit after all <br> More sales more win. </br></br></br>    <br> normies <br> the ones to buy shit <br>Maybe if you're talking about CR subscriptions.</br></br></br>  <br>Not bad as far as twatter jokes go</br>  <br><br>good for them</br></br>  <br>Fucking Mexicans.</br>  isnt the writer is from Nitro+?<br><br>thats probably why it stayed away from cancellation<br><br>besides, i'm pretty sure many were caught off guard by 1st episode</br></br></br></br>  <br>It seems like it was seeling 3k-6k vols before the anime and after the 10x boost in selling now it's somewhere 30k-60k<br>It has already gone over 20k increase.<br>Also SnK anime boosted the manga sales like 1 Million more so obviously I'm not taking it as a base for GG sales you know.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The anime is probably gonna end with the graduation, so they need to go through the basement arc. anon<br> I mean if they stick with the manga </br></br></br>  <br> Kurumi goes full nemesis. Needs regular shots to keep her sanity. <br> Miki gets bitten as well and suffer the same fate. <br> They learn that the outbreak was an experiment to create superior beings. <br> Using the mayor's treasurery, Miki create her own terrorist organisation to destroy them and bring a new age to the world.  <br> To counter Miki's military use of the virus, Kurumi build her own organisation. <br> Fast forward twenty years. <br> Kurumi and Miki fighting each other on top of a submarine while injecting each other with vaccine. <br><br>You know it has to be this way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't the 3k-6k estimations after the 10x boost?</br>  <br>Did anyone else get the impression that the helicopter pilot and whatever group he's part of were just remnants of their organization? It looks like it's set up to suggest they're part of a larger group but there are details that point to it being only a few people.</br>  <br> meanwhile in Prison School, the manga gets axed </br>  <br>I doubt it will vary too much from the manga. The only big difference so far is Miki and dog, and it actually works better with her there from the start in my opinion</br>  <br>If it wasn't selling at least 3k it wouldn't have been adaptated in the first place.</br>  What does the Gurashi smell like?<br>Shovel a best.</br>  <br>Good question</br>  <br>Nope, it was before the anime.<br>they would cancel it even before getting an anime adaptation, if a possible anime adaptation were to bring this much of small boost.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=uPx<wbr>WAIal64M</wbr>  [ ]<br> FOX...DIIIIEEEEEE </br></br>  <br>You're a dumbo. It was selling around pre-anime AgK levels (Think in the range of 10-20k or so).</br>  <br>Dried blood and sweat</br>  <br><br><br>Best end<br>But does that means Miki will win in the end?</br></br></br></br>  <br>After months without a proper shower, the bat and shovel isn't their strongest weapon.</br>  If Kurumi turns full zombie, does she retain shovel powers or does the shovel get passed onto the next zombie slayer?  <br>Miki kills Shovel with her own shovel.</br>  <br> You're a dumbo <br>T-tanks</br></br>  <br>they are actually started the anime from from the time when Miki joined them. And they changed the events a bit.<br>The only major difference is the fucking dog and it's not doing good to the anime at all.<br>There is a scene in the Ep3 previre where Kurumi seems to lose herself (her eyes losing the light) so maybe she will take care of it.</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly, yes. As much as we all want both to win,  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FLq<wbr>cpPDFEzk</wbr>  [ ] </br>  <br><br>Go ask Megu-nee</br></br>  <br>I watched an entire episode.<br><br>I don't even speak Spanish, I don't know why I did</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to blow her hard with my shovel.</br>  <br>Yuki is literally perfection.<br>I want her to chomp on my balls.</br></br>  <br>They didn't just start there though, they rejigged everything that happens before miki so it was after. It's a pretty big change</br>  <br> Kurumi gets unnoticed because she smells like one of them </br>  <br>Alpha stage is airborne. Survivors are immune to that. Scientists are presumably out of range.</br>  Why did helicopter-kun gave up?  <br>But we don't know how the disease gets transmitted, Kurumi was soaked with enough zombie fluids.</br>  <br> Kurumi is actually a fujo <br>I don't want this</br></br>  <br>No, mall scene never happened in the anime. Miki in the manga is a much different character than Miki in the show at this point.</br>  <br>He didn't, he just became 'one' in mid-air.</br>  <br>He turned zombie</br>  <br>He was infected. Zombie tremors crushed the picture and the syringe so he died.</br>  <br>Rii talked about how Miki managed to survive in the mall al by herself though so I feel like they are just injecting pre-Miki events that covered in the manga (except the time with Megu-nee) to the current time-line.</br>  <br>Too many waifus</br>  <br> Not Tyrant Kurumi and Veronica Virus Miki fighting on top of a skyscraper </br>  <br> No, mall scene never happened in the anime. <br>They directly bring it up as a thing that happened.</br></br>  <br>It might not be a big difference story wise (since I'm assuming them going to the mall and that whole scene still happened) but it's still a big difference</br>  <br>What are you guys on about? They bathe as normal, it's even touched in the manga when Miki recently joined them</br>  <br>Miki didn't try to fix Yuki like in the anime, which we would see if the events were similar. She's simply not the same character due to her different experience.</br>  Senpai a cool  faggot   <br> wanting resident evil end over mgs4 end </br>  <br>I wonder how the mall scene happened in the anime. They still have the store in the anime, so it's not food.</br>  Why is the opening so shitty.<br><br>Is this the season of the shitty opening. The only good ones are the shimoneta and overlord ones.<br><br>Kurumi a best and a death.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We may still get it as Miki seems really nervous about it.<br>Maybe when she will get more proof that will make her believe Yuki is pretending then she will confront her about it.</br></br>  <br>So it's now selling 30K? Immense success.</br>  <br>Maybe the fixing attempt already happened.</br>  <br>This is mere speculation, but maybe they'll touch on that part when  Taroumaru dies and Yuki starts deluding herself he just went home </br>  <br> We never had a single bath/showe  l  scene.</br>  <br> Why is the opening so shitty. <br>Full retard.</br></br>  <br>But the OP is great<br> <br>GENKI DESU!</br> </br></br>  <br>It's a pretty gud opening tbh</br>  <br>30k-60k is not much for a popular show that's on the level of GG right now. you can even say it's not enough / a failure.<br>Let's see if it will be able to go over 200k or not.</br></br>  <br> Alpha stage is airborne. <br>Why do people keep spreading this misinfo? It's spread through "contact, liquids and blood", there's nothing about it being airborne.</br></br>  <br> not liking DIE好き </br>  <br>why are they using gas mask when is obvious that the viru does not tasmit by air.</br>  What VNs did the author write anyway?  <br> tbh  <br>Opinion discarded</br></br>  <br> No one gives a fuck about him <br>Why? This fag might have fucked youre waifu you know.</br></br>  <br> liquids and blood <br>Common misconception about zombies. All their blood would flow down to their legs and they would all be really dry if did not drink.</br></br>  <br>Anime Miki is fine with her talking in an empty classroom to people who died. Manga Miki got into a fight with Rii over just the idea of not helping Yuki.</br>  <br>I'm not sure about the water supply in Japan, here you wouldn't get (clean) water after 1-2 weeks without the daily maintenance.</br>  <br> mgs memes have been posted so often and for so long at every single opportunity that it's more obnoxious than fateshit at this point, and I don't even dislike mgs the way I dislike fate <br><br> just saying </br></br></br>  <br>The point is that we might still get it.<br>Miki might get triggered over some other event or whatever.</br></br>  <br>Read the manual, water purification held them indefinitely.</br>  <br>Doesn't matter. That difference is enough for me to treat them as different characters.</br>  Reminder that bullying Rii is not okay, no one is a weigh down, they all protect and help each other.  <br><br>Opening is just too cute for my taste. I know that is suppose to contrast with how dark the manga is but still. And the part qhere the girl hold hadns is too gay.</br></br>  <br> Rii is dragging the whole group down with her. <br> Imlpying <br><br>This is what I was talking about, she's not dragging down anyone.</br></br></br></br>  Will this get any kind of conclusion or will it turn into just another "Let's survive!" manga?  <br> Miki got into a fight with Rii over just the idea of not helping Yu <br> Which is kind of stupid, because how are they suppose to help her. Non of them are medic or have access to drugs to help her craziness.</br></br>  <br><br>The manga is shaping up to be a surviving manga. A la The Walking Dead. It's weird considering that the first chapters feel like they'll tell a short story. Then the story keeps extending.</br></br>  <br>Copypasta of the pastebins links for the extras<br><br>http://pastebin.com/xKr64Qre<br>http://pastebin.com/8rz8gEUM<br>http://pastebin.com/hgr2a3ZL</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thing is, Megu-nee or the other studens were never a liability to Yuki (or the others).<br><br>Ruu actually hinders Rii's actions. I mean she was attacked because she didn't drop the teddy. She needs to get her shit together soon or they will get in real trouble. I'm afraid how far Rii is willing to go for Ruu.</br></br></br>  For those wondering, 3k in a Kirara magazine is pretty par for the course. I can't really name too many that sell more than that. <br><br><br>I'm hoping for a everyone becomes zombies end. The idea of them all surviving is nice too, but just imagining the tension as characters die out one by one over a load of chapters gets me excited.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuki was the one to save Miki, of course Miki would want to save her from being crazy.</br>  <br>Megu-nee helped Yuki, but her delusions still forced everyone to take care of her and make the school club.<br><br>It's okay to be afraid though, Yuuri is probably going to cause some serious problem before she wakes up.</br></br></br>  <br>It's also a hell of a lot more than it was previously selling</br>  <br> they think Rii went too far and want her to snap out of it <br> she accuses them of conspiracy and murders the first person trying to take Ruu away </br></br>  <br>I think all Kirara stuff sells weak for the first 1/2 volumes, I only casually look at the manga charts but I've never seen any doing particularly good. Except New Game. <br><br>Feels like Kirara stuff can generally just float along at pretty average sales and not worry too much. It's only a problem if it's not going anywhere I think (Itoshi no Karin).</br></br></br>  Rock Lee probably found a ninja prostitute.  Naruto is the only one with 2 kids.<br><br>Is Hinata's body just so irresistible he wanted more?</br></br>  <br>She's made for breeding</br>  so he didn't bang 1010?  <br>Lets be real, it was Hinata who wanted more</br>  <br> Chouji and Karui are not pictured for whatever reason <br> Metal Lee and Toneri Jr are half brothers connected through '?' </br></br>   Lee is a single dad with an unnamed, dead waifu   <br>Naruto always wanted a family and has the means to produce one. <br><br>That picture on the top doting on baby Boruto while HInata holds him is just too adorable.</br></br></br>  <br>Both him and Hinata are fairly big on family stuff, and Kishi said their relationship is drama free compared to the more sitcom/soap opera-ish ones the others have.<br>While it is inevitable that the plot be taken over by Edward Rinneganhands and Moon Bud Spencer, I do hope we are getting some nice stuff with the families.</br></br>  <br>He's also balding</br>  <br> I do hope we are getting some nice stuff with the families. <br><br>Sure, thing is that it's going to be this family.</br></br></br>    <br> Kishi said <br>Care to post some sauce there, my friend?</br></br>  <br>Fujo please, your pushing this shit is getting dull.</br>  <br> we'll never get a revenge movie starring Lee trying to avenge his dead waifu </br>  <br>I heard a third was on the way.</br>  <br>Some interview after the end of the series/The Last.<br>Not gonna dig it up, feel free to believe it or not.</br></br>  <br>No, there isn't.</br>  <br>I think her entire genetic line is.</br>  <br> implying you would stop with Hinata after the second baby </br>  <br>That was just Kishi joking around, saying he might just give a third kid the Byakugan.<br>No mention of a third kid so far and she sure as shit does not look pregnant in Bolt's movie.</br></br>  Why is Shikamaru wearing a onesie with a v-neck?  <br>Chouji, Karui, Ino, Temari, Toneri's parents and whoever received Lee's Primary Lotus not pictured because they aren't going to be featured in the movie or otherwise haven't had their anime version designs revealed.<br><br> Rock Lee <br> son: Metal Lee <br> father: Blues Lee <br> mother: Rhythm Lee </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*Mitsuki's parents</br>    <br> Chouji, Karui, Ino <br>Makes sense, they already all had cameos in the gaiden.<br><br> Temari and Kiba <br>Those really got fucked over by the next gen stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Temari had some screentime in the novels (definitely the Gaara and Shikamaru ones).<br>Kiba had a little bit to himself and Shino in Konoha Hiden, but not much beyond that. By now the fucker's probably mourning Akamaru's death, or is back to training a puppy.</br></br>  <br>Poor Tenten, she'll die alone, and only her weapons will mourn her</br>  <br>Kiba and Neko-girl's kid will probably be a Ninja with a magic flute that controls mice</br>  <br> blue eyes <br><br>Sarada confirmed to be Naruto and Sasuke's test tube child created in Orochimaru's lab by Karin, making her the half sister of Bolt and Himawari.</br></br></br>  <br> Sakura still gets no keychain </br>  This guy is creepy  <br>Just because new swag trend in Konoha</br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me if it was Toneri reborn. Probably came to Konoha for either Boruto, or the Sunflower.</br>  <br>He's definitely Orochimaru's experimental son or some shit.</br>  <br> yellow eyes <br>If that's the case then evolution really doesn't want people to have the byakugan</br></br>  <br>Silly human byakugan's for villains now.</br>  <br>I'm still annoyed that he literally forgot to give Boruto and Himawari the Byakugan.<br>And it's something so simple to fix too, just say that due to the mix between Uzumaki and Hyuuga genes they're able to deactivate it, problem solved.</br></br>  <br>I thought Boruto was their child together.</br>  <br> I'm still annoyed that he literally forgot to give Boruto and Himawari the Byakugan. <br>He probably simply didn't want to, as he said he did not like drawing the Byakugan, they make expressions hard to make.<br>By all means I would prefer if Bolt had some activatable/unlockable version of it because the Gentle Fist did not get enough screentime, but clearly that is not Kishi's idea for the character.</br></br></br>  How will the Big Mom ship encounter turn out?  I hope we scenes like this for the final battle and Luffy's crew being named with their own panels.  <br>Then they get wrecked by the Marines.</br>  <br>Jinbei will come and save them, Kid's alliance will take her down.</br>  I'm positive everyone on the ship jobbed  <br> final battle </br>  <br>Hate to ask to be spoo nfed, but where do I get HQ scans?</br>  <br>Capone seemed to think they were doing well.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Sanji and Brook defeated Pekoms and Tamago; and Caesar blew up the ship.</br></br></br>  <br>I really think Jinbe is too strong in water to be a straw hat. He's 10x stronger than when he fought Ace to a standstill on land.

Judging from the interest in Buggy's fruit it seemed like they didn't really care too much.<br><br>You also have to remember that as a pirate you spend most of your time on the sea, and losing the ability to swim is enough for the majority of the pirates to avoid eating one (Especially if the fruit is unknown), the only reason we don't see shitloads of fodderish DF users drown is because it would be pretty boring and somewhat morbid. <br><br><br><br>If PH is any indicator, they can permanantly change the climate of an island.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Devil <br>Demon <br>Literally god'a natural enemy</br></br></br>  <br>Transform/alter the environment into their element; as seen on Punk Hazard and with Crocodile.</br>  <br> Daring </br>  <br>There is no evidence Shanks intended to sell the Gomu Gomu.<br>Zero.<br>There is evidence against it.<br>For example on the first page of storyline canon (actual page one is a color spread of Luffy and Shanks and many characters in a open area full of treasure, celebrating), a narrator tells us Shanks arrived 1 year ago. We are shown his last night and day at the island.<br>Before docking one year ago, Shanks stole the Gomu Gomu from an enemy pirate ship. A year later, Luffy eats this fruit which was hidden on the red hair's ship.<br>Shanks flips out.<br>Later in the story we are told that BB gave Shanks his scar, that he was a 20 year member of Whitebeard's crew (joined before Roger died but within the same year). <br><br>Shanks hid in East Blue for one year because he invaded Whitebeards ship to steal Gomu Gomu and was scarred by Blackbeard.<br>Blackbeard would only expose his power level to a Roger pirate if it was over something really important.<br>There's no canon that suggests Shanks planned to sell Gomu Gomu. None. That's just your wrong assumption.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The D is linked to the destroyed kingdom 800 years ago, and probably tied to the Poneglyphs.<br><br>When the Ohara scholars were about to reveal the name the Gorosei ordered CP to kill them.<br><br>I would have guessed "Dragon", but "Monkey Dragon Dragon" sounds too retarded.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all those bottles of liquor </br>  <br><br>Probably the most obvious options, so I really hope it's not one of those</br></br>  <br> Dee </br>  <br> Shanks hid in East Blue for one year because he invaded Whitebeards ship to steal Gomu Gomu and was scarred by Blackbeard. <br> Blackbeard would only expose his power level to a Roger pirate if it was over something really important. <br> There's no canon that suggests Shanks planned to sell Gomu Gomu.

I want the previous owner of the Gomu Gomu to be some village idiot who drowned.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Professor Clover was going to say the name of the Kingdom. We don't know if the name of the Kingdom is the same as what D. stands for, nor if the Kingdom even begins with a D.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I really hope it doesn't turn out to be "Shanks was holding Rogers fruit".<br><br>Luffy is similar enough to Roger as it is, if they have the same fruit then you might as well give him a mustache and it's the same character.<br><br>Plus it would be far more interesting to have Roger be a badass on pure skill alone.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Openings List From Best to Worst (excluding Opening 7)<br><br>God Tier:<br>1) Kokoro no Chizu (OP 5)<br><br>Top Tier:<br>2) Hikari E (OP 3)<br>3) Fight Together (OP 14)<br>4) One Day (OP 13)<br><br>Good Tier:<br>5) We GO (OP 15)<br>6) Jungle P (OP 8)<br>7) Share the World (OP 11)<br>8) Brand New World (OP 6)<br><br>Okay Tier:<br>9) We Are!

Kind of like how the amazons live on Amazon lilly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It stands for Davy Jones</br>  <br>What? Are you still salty that Hikari E spoiled Robin for you, anon?</br>  <br> Shit tier <br> Wake Up! <br><br>Anon you're list is shit and you should feel bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, it would be terrible writing to put that so late in the series... I really don't see it happening.<br><br>Whitebeard and his crew all saw Luffy fight, and Luffy has interacted with a lot of legends like Rayleigh and Chiango who would have mentioned something about similar powers.</br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Zou will be an arc similar to the Davy Back Fight arc because Oda know when to give his readers a break after long, exhausting arcs.  <br>Roger has only been shown going into battles with a sword and pistol, and presumably haki on top of that.</br>  <br> shit song <br> terrible outfits <br> shit drawing <br> shit animation <br> cheesy dialogue <br><br>Only good things were the Dressrosa parts, and that was only about 30 seconds of the whole thing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what new fate things Zoro learned from Mihawk.  <br><br>I'm hoping there's a huge amount of buildup for Big Mom, including flashbacks to fights with WB/Roger/Kaido etc... Then she opens the bomb from FI completely destroying her flagship and critically injuring most/all of her crew.</br></br>  <br>He cut apart the ship when he arrived back on Saboady, saying it was fate that he got on it accidentally.</br>  <br>Yeah but that seems like something Zoro would do normally.</br>  <br> fan colored manga <br>Eww no thanks</br></br>  <br>Is this bait?<br>There is nothing to suggest that the ancient kingdom name has a D in it anywhere.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Your loss friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br> pics <br><br>And people still thinks Mihawk &gt; Doffy</br></br></br></br>  <br> dude no one talks about and have never seen him fight is better then people we seen fight and one is the greatest swordman in the world fuck off mate </br>  <br>replied to wrong post. anyway the point is still the same the ancient kingdom could be raftel/lvneel/whatever and it wouldn't require a D.</br>  <br>He is.</br>  in the final fight I bet zoro flashback to Koshiro and not Mihawk. If Koshiro was #1 before Kuina died especially. Who says Koshiro was ever defeated by anyone?    <br>What chapter did that flashback start in?</br>  <br>Chapter 5<br>You'll have to read 90-100 to find the second because I forgot, but when Zoro meets Tashigi and gets two new named swords he has a second. When he fights Daz Bones he has a third.</br></br>  <br>The one I posted isn't a flashback but a cover page showing Koshiro in the present time period.</br>  <br><br>No, All Blue will happen when the redline part of mariejoris and fishniggerisland will be destroyed.<br>Making the four Blue´s flow into one place</br></br></br>  <br>Forgot image</br>  Please, post chapter pages in color.  <br>Even Daz Bones blocked a Mihawk air slash, Luffy dodged a bunch of them, and Crocodile stalled him long enough for Luffy to leave his CoO range.<br><br>And that whole time Oda made us believe Mihawk was serious and trying to kill Luffy. Maybe Koshiro really is better.</br></br></br>  <br> No, All Blue will happen <br>No you don't know anything about it,neither do any of us.Stop forcing your own headcanon into making it a fact because no ones cares about your shitty theories.</br></br>  <br><br>It´s been discussed to death, and most seem to agree it would happen.<br><br>Because of that, it´s without a doubt gonna happen!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't respond to it.</br>  <br>Any general ones you want posted? I've only got like 100 saved.</br>    Who's the qtest character and why is it Roofy?  <br>I want ones like this.</br>   koala will never hotdog yo dik   <br>How the fuck is anyone suppose to fight Sanjuan Wolf?</br>    <br>Do you mean official Oda ones? Or ones with similar events happening on the page?</br>  Robin will never push her sweaty tats on your body.  <br>Official Oda ones.</br>  <br> tats <br><br>Well apart from the one chapter you're posting, Oda hasn't coloured any chapters</br></br></br>  <br> It´s been discussed to death <br>Oh,did you discuss it with oda and editors and they agreed?That's marvelous.</br></br>  <br><br>I was actually talking about the people that kept posting without color, but a color dump is noic too.</br></br>  <br>Shitty, and this chapter was not colored, just those two first pages of it.</br>  <br>It would be cool if in the future, one of the crewmembers has to fight someone in a different archetype and completely floors them through sheer strength difference alone.</br>  <br>Jinbei can handle giants pretty well himself.</br>    When's this asshole gonna show up?  <br>In the final arc</br>  Is the Doflamingo figure worth the extra $40 to pre-order the European special edition of Pirate Warriors 3 or does it look like shit?  <br>Sounds like a very Sanji or Zoro thing to do. Literally just overpower them by being strong.</br>  Do you think Marines will uprise to the WG at the end? Are you expecting a coup d'etat?  <br>Someone shop the Xusasu Basasu and everyone's typeset into this color page. It'd be glorious.</br>  im not sure what the heck was going on in chapter 793<br><br>The navy is angry because Luffy upset the balance of shichibukai or something?</br></br>  <br>Basically, what's not easy to get though? It's all pretty clear.</br>  I'm hoping they managed to get away<br>What I'm expecting is that only like one or two of them got away and everyone else was captured.<br><br>If anything, I'm sure Sanji's being forced to cook for big mom</br></br></br>  <br><br>I can see that happen under akainu's tutelage.<br>He doesn't give a fuck about the WG and wants the marines to be his own tool of justice.</br></br></br>  here is as good a place to post this as anywhere  Why does Oda always pierce your heart by his shit and you start to almost cry?<br> That person they spoke of wasn't some random pirate and he wasn't the cursed offspring of the great pirate era that everyone spoke of, Ace was my brother </br>  So I am reading one piece again and I'm at Skypiea. Here is this scene where Robin talks how the lightning fruit is one of the invincible powers. Is she talking about Logia in general or are there fruits which are considered invincible?<br><br>Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line?</br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I think the line was about the most powerful ones <br>the goro goro is one <br>pika pika is another<br>gura gura <br>and probably the magma one</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Also how strong would Enel have been in the grand line? <br>Oda confirmed that he would have had a 500 million bounty if he were on the blue sea. So New World tier of course.<br><br>Also, I think it's one of the invincible in that the user is very hard to kill perhaps. He did restart his own heart with the fruit after all.<br><br><br>Could also be this; I'd argue Enel's fruit is the best in the series so it could be reference to the overall power of the fruit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason Enel lost was because for no real reason he made himself really big and unable to dodge.<br><br>Maybe Oda bumped him out of the plot early on because he's planned out all the biggest powers early on and the lightning one was so strong he needed it out of the way.</br></br></br>  <br> new world tier <br>Yeah, no. Bounty != strength. Enel would get trashed by any top-tier New World Pirate/Marine.</br></br>   big mom showing up already to get jobbed.   <br>yeah, i like to imagine Roger as a beast, no fruit, no weapons, only the good old barehands and his fukking super haki<br><br>Also i want an entire Arc for Roger adventures/flashback (at least the early and the late years)</br></br></br>  <br>I'd like for Roger's flashback to show him as a  horrible criminal who burns down cities and steals fucking everything. <br><br> But I'm aware he'll have to be another good guy who never does wrong. </br></br></br>  <br>Has she been conirmed for battling anyone as of late? I'd love it, if she pulled a Gecko Moria and got a lot weaker for not dong anything for a long time. She's able to keep her position due to her past notoriety, but it's not based on anything anymore.<br>Then her whole crew should job against the SHs on the Sunny.</br></br>  <br>People tend to forget how insanely strong Doffy is.<br>He wasted Law and Luffy while mantaining that stupid birdcage that not even a whole island could stop, including Zoro and Fujitora. Also Gear Fourth Luffy could not finish him even when Law already injured him big time. Doflamingo is fucking strong.</br></br>  <br> brook drinking soda which would dissolve his bones <br> luffy feeding a fish soda which would fucking kill it <br>Robin's hot legs are the only thing that save this pic.</br></br></br>  <br>Obviously Roger will be a  a complete retarded who act before thinking  with enough knowledge and focus to reach raftel.<br><br>Also  final boss is Davy Jones, Admiral of the ancient kingdom, become the keeper of Raftel and One Piece, who is something world gov needs to achieve the complete control of the world </br></br></br>  <br> Told people to blame God <br><br>I thought Zoro is an atheist?</br></br></br>  <br>man, croco is so weak now. luffy can stop his attacks like nothing.</br>  <br> people forget <br>Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't.<br><br>Oda dropped the fucking ball with this arc its presentation is so boring.</br></br></br></br>  <br>DFs &gt; Haki<br>Enel would destroy people with lightning. No-one is immune to it but Luffy in the world.</br></br>  <br>Everyone is forgetting that Enel has the most advanced form of Kenbunshoku Haki seen so far.</br>  <br>Implementing his DF power into it really is unique. I can't wait how he applies niggermode into it.</br>  <br>dont read it through mangapanda if you are. if you arent, dont see what's so hard to understand</br>  <br> Probably because Dressrosa is so forgettable. I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>No it's not, it's just that when you read weekly you forget events much quicker due to a certain amount of things taking 2 years, while with every other arc you got to experience the whole thing in a continuous hit.</br></br>  <br>Because any NW pirate/marine can do something about Enel's god-tier CoO and speed of light.</br>  <br> he becomes black with lightning powers </br>  <br> Because any NW pirate/marine <br><br>Why do people say this sort of thing about 'all' nw denizens when the majority of them, including crews, seem no more stronger than most of what we've seen before? There's just a few captains and things who are strong. Their crews are still the same jobbers.</br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora also likely does a similar thing with his gravity to advance his CoO.<br><br>Exactly (correction though; speed of lightning =/= speed of light, but it's still a fucking massive velocity which would be comparable in the OPverse)</br></br></br>  <br> I have to keep rereading it because I forget half of it if I don't. <br>or maybe it's cause you're dumb. one refresh should be enough to remind you or keep up with things, only because it's so long.</br></br>  <br>This.<br>I would forget about some things from Impel Down, Marineford, Fishman Island and Punk Hazard as well. <br>It's kind of sad we'll always have newfags whining about whatever current arc is, no matter how good it may be.</br></br></br>  <br>You realise that Zoro, Usopp, Sanji and Robin survived his lightning, right ? Just CoA up and block that shit.</br>  You guys think Law will the be next Straw hat? Here is my thought:<br><br>Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats. It's always been like this and now we have seen Law's. <br>You guys think there is any correlation with that?</br></br></br>  <br>People survive every DF, however Enel's is one that's highly effective at incapacitating people.<br><br>Haki wont block out lightning by the way.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the crew got stronger too ? I feel like it's relative. The crew fought fodder before but that same fodder would be dust in the NW. The fodder in the NW would be semi-successful in the Grand Line.</br>  <br>What role could he fill though?<br><br>I've been saying this for ages: the strawhats need a cook</br></br></br>  <br>Law has his own crew, but they can die, or he can give command to someone else. It's possible.<br> Kaido or Big Mom massacre Law's crew <br> Law seeks revenge again </br></br></br>  <br>We've seen bunch of non-crew members having flashbacks. By that logic Hody Jones should be a member already.</br>  <br>Surgeon.<br>Chopper is a great doctor, but can he perform surgery?</br></br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br>Senor Pink/Baby5 for next nakama!</br></br>  <br> Implying that Zoro is not a God. </br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I preferred the translation "Blame it on a quirk of fate."</br>  <br> Haki wont block out lightning anyway <br>You base this on absolutely nothing. If Haki can block fucking Light and Magma, it sure as shit can block Lightning. <br><br>Also, the NW people are obviously going to be a lot tankier than the Grand Line people. We have no idea if someone with Doffy's endurance would be incapacitated at all. Shit, he didn't fall unconscious after getting his insides scrambled.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would not even be mad.</br>  <br>Proof?</br>  <br>Zoro doesn't really have a role except being the badass sword fighter does he? Law could just be another fighter because they need one. And his surgery skills are needed. Chopper can't do every thing by himself. Not the kind of surgeries Law can handle.</br>  <br>Post yfw Zoro is revealed to be an ancient deity based around anger and carnage.<br>Pic related.</br></br>  <br>When has haki blocked light? Not in the sense of Rayleigh using it on his sword; but if Kizaru shot a beam of light at you, your haki on your body wouldn't defend that. Especially when haki like Vergo's can't even block out Law's ability</br>  <br>Zoro's just the Swordsman, yea.</br>  <br>That would be such a pain. He's been emo for long enough now, I want to see him enjoy life for once.</br>    <br><br>it's not really official but he fits the role as the first mate.</br></br>  <br>There's more required to become a crewmate than just a sad backstory.<br>You need:<br> Goal which requires travelling the seas <br> Sad backstory <br> A general role they can take (which is either wanted by Luffy or necessary I'd say) <br>Jinbei for instance has it all, which is why he's confirmed to join.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not talking about how every one who had a backstory joined the straw hats. But every straw hat that did, had a backstory before joining.<br><br>Just a thought that popped into my head.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The same way the user can be blocked, I suppose. I'm not saying it will negate the attack. I'm saying you can put up a defense, since Enel's lightning seems more similar to Magma than Light for whatever reason. And we really haven't seen anyone use CoA for defense against Kizaru, so I suppose I'm being baseless too. That's my bad.</br>  <br>Like an Archaelogist!</br>  <br> Kaido or Big Mom kill Law <br> Law's crew joins Luffy <br>A whole bunch of new nakamas is better than one.</br></br></br>  <br>Robin does have a dream though. It's to discover the true history of the world.</br>  <br> implying they don't need an archaeologist for reading the poneglyphs </br>  <br>Robin is indeed necessary for finding One Piece. Luffy is lucky that his fate lead her to joining.</br>  <br>but they could also have that backstory introduced later in the series. like robin. so characters that didnt have a backstory in dressrosa shouldnt be automatically ruled out, or Oda might not even keep up with that pattern. I think having a dream that makes sense to travel the seas with the strawhats and a new role they can fit into on the ship seem like a better criteria for now. <br><br>Which is why I dont think anyone's joining this arc.</br></br></br>  <br>chapter 816 second page</br>  <br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br><br>Robin.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, that's Law performing immortality operation on Chopper. You fucked up, /a/non.</br>  <br> Robin <br><br>What is the Tragedy of Ohara</br></br></br>  <br>ooh shit sorry youre right</br>  <br><br><br>I know, I know. I was just joking because Luffy doesn't seem to give 2 shits about it right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why did Oda make him suck so much ass?<br>All he did was essentially was use birdcage and then tank every attack thrown at him until he lost.<br>We didn't even get to see him actually fighting save for a few exchanges.</br></br></br>  <br>He was against his own protege and a prick that trained for 2 years solid. The majority of which was under Rayleigh himself. There was no way Doffy could have predicted that kinda growth.</br>  <br>Luffy and Law were absolutely thrashed with just a couple of blows. Also he has to lose, so Oda wrote it that way. We already saw him kicking ass in Marine Ford (Joz and Oars Jr), then fucking smoker up, tanking Aokiji attacks and wasting Luffy and Law. He has been the major villain who kicked the most ass in all fairness.</br>  I wonder how long it'll be before Luffy loses a fight again.  <br><br>Regardless of what happens, Doflamingo will be the best just because of that fabulous pink feathers coat.</br></br>  Which Yonko will Luffy oneshot?  <br>But he did fight back. He put Law on the verge of death, then put Luffy 3m deep inside a wall.<br>Without the whole colliseum team, Doffy would have finished this in 5min, it was a 200v10</br></br>  <br>He technically lost in PH. Most of the crew did.</br>  I'm beginning to suspect Brook might be a bit of a pevert...  <br>Shanks cause he'd be too busy crying over how far Luffy has come.</br>  <br><br> Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats <br> backstory of a character before they join  <br> before they join <br><br>Robin joined the crew before her story was even remotely explored. <br><br>It's entirely possible for someone to join then have their backstory explained later.<br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was just traveling with them until after Ennis Lobby. Her "I wanna live!" moment was when she officially became a Straw Hat, I reckon.</br>  <br>(Like how Nami was with them for a while and only became a Straw Hat after Luffy took care of Arlong.)</br>  <br>Technically we didn't get Nami's either. Or Usopp, I think. I think we got Usopp's just when they set sail, right ?</br>  <br> sail on a ship <br> obey captain's orders <br>That's all you need to be a crewmate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Are you fucking serious?<br><br>How was Robin not a part of the SH during Skypeia? Your statement is complete bullshit and you're pulling crap out of your ass to try justify it.<br><br>You know you're wrong and you're grasping at straws.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's what I'm thinking too. She basically invited herself onto the crew. She became a full member after Enies Lobby is what I always thought.</br></br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>One Piece Party 2. It's on Mangastream at least. Probably other places, too.<br><br>Is everyone who's traveled with the Straw Hats and fought along side them a member of the crew? Jimbei? Vivi? Those two bounty hunters from early on?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is complete bullshit and you know it, the argument isn't "They're not a REAL crew member until they have their backstory is explored"<br><br>The argument is that "Oda always tells the sad backstory of a character before they join the Straw hats"<br><br>If you don't think Robin was a part of the SH's during Skypeia you're being willfully ignorant.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>if you have to spoonfeed, spoonfeed the non-cancerous version retard<br>http://bato.to/read/_/307282/one-pi<wbr>ece-party_ch2--v2-_by_powermanga/2<br>Chapter 3 is also up there as it seems.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>Vivi was asked to join the crew and rejected the offer due to having to take care of Alabasta.<br><br>Jimbei said he would join after clearing a few things up.<br><br>The two bounty hunters were barely even around, maybe a dozen panels at most. Robin was around for Skypia which was 100+ chapters. You're making terrible comparisons to try dig yourself out of a hole.<br><br>I swear do you even read this shit?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>when he kills/cripples mihawk<br><br><br><br>My guess is we are going to meet more BB pirates since their aim is devil fruits and such. Shiliew could maybe be after mihawks sword or title as we speak.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Do people actually like this guy?<br><br>His hat looks super gay.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Turns out a lot of people don't judge a character by how "gay" his hat looks. What a fucking wonderful World!</br>  <br>Danke. Here's your reward.</br>  <br> &gt;I swear do you even read this shit? <br>Becoming a Straw Hat isn't about allying yourself with them, even over a long term.<br><br>It's about not holding back and giving yourself over to them as a cause. Robin didn't fully believe in them until Ennis Lobby when they declared war on the government. She was still holding back because she was afraid they'd dump her or try to turn her in like everyone else in her past.</br></br></br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br>They'd better get some decent screentime and be involved in an actual fight.<br>...please.</br></br>  <br>How is this a reward?<br><br>Are you stupid?</br></br></br>  <br><br> she was afraid they'd dump her or try to turn her in like everyone else in her past <br><br>Holy fucking shit you're retarded, you just proved you don't read this shit.<br><br>The reason Robin went with CP9 willingly during W7 was because she truly cared for the SH pirates, she knew that refusing would invoke a buster call and lead them to their deaths.<br><br>Kuzan mentioned that she could have easily escaped if she was by herself, the fact she cared for the SH's was reason enough for her to sacrifice herself. If that isn't enough dedication for you, you can go fuck yourself.<br><br>I'm going to stop responding to you because you're completely wrong and pulling bullshit out of your ass like <br><br> It's about not holding back and giving yourself over to them as a cause <br><br>Your headcanon != canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're so gay.</br>  <br>Stop posting like a fucking asshole</br>   &gt;not liking gay hats   <br>Chapter 398. It's not even subtext.

No way in hell Roger had the gomu gomu, that's way too much of a clichè  and it's also really fucking retarded </br>  <br> we'll never have a SH gun user <br>Oh well, we still have Izo and Yasop. They're cool.</br></br>  <br>What a shitty spinoff. Most crack doujins are more entertaining.</br>  Oh Bellamy.    <br>Yeah Zoro ain't nothing to fuck with.</br>  <br>what is this?</br>  <br>Kuzan D.  Frost </br>  <br>Is this from one of the movies? I've never watched the anime or any of the movies.</br>  <br>yeah it's from the latest movie<br>the anime has nowhere near the production value for animation like that</br></br>  <br> a well executed fight against a decently strong woman where Zoro doesn't pussy out with cheap excuses and actually take her seriously <br>Movie Z not canon confirmed.</br></br>  <br> Zoro doesn't pussy out <br>The only woman Zoro has met in his entire life worth taking seriously was Kuina.<br>No other woman has proven capable of coming near to challenging him.</br></br></br>  <br>Dunno, but I like this cover.</br>  <br>D stands for Dereshi.<br>Robin knew it from her eavesdropping on the scholars.<br>Monkey Dereshi Dragon</br></br></br>  Who /best boy/ here?  <br> Law <br> fun <br>Pick one!</br></br></br>  <br> actually take her seriously <br>Nope. He knew she wasn't into it before the fight even began. The only thing he ever took seriously was yelling at Luffy.<br><br><br>Rather surprising to see Robin has a bra.</br></br></br></br></br>  Are the Yonkos the only guys capable of rekting the admirals? <br><br>Ace was clearly no where near Akainu league. Jinbe who was Ace level was clearly not as well. <br><br>Aoikiji didn't find much trouble beating Jozu, he completely froze him. <br><br>Fuji implied he could've take Doffy but preferred to let Luffy handle him. <br><br>Marco and Bekhman might be Admiral level but then again Kizaru didn't seem very serious. <br><br>The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Short answer, Yes.<br>Long answer, Yes, the Yonkos are people like Dragon are the only people that strong. The WG needs the entirety of the Marines and the Shichibukai to balance out the Yonko's, and apparently this balance isn't to be fucked with. So, it's safe to assume that the Yonko's are fucking hideously strong.</br></br>  <br><br>Yep, Pirates would just run amok if there's nothing in the Marines stronger than them.</br></br>  <br>maybe not the only ones but yes, Admirals are clearly overpowered as shit.<br><br>and about the people who claim Kizaru was really scared of Beckman, do they always forget that something like five second after Beckman told him to stop Kizaru jumped into the air and spammed a storm of lightrays towards the submarine completely ignoring Benn? It's not like I dislike the guy but come on, it's pretty obvious Kizaru was being sarcastic</br></br></br>  <br> The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks. <br> Shanks <br>Not necessarily confirmed. He would have been a threat at that point even if he was just normal admiral level. A bunch of well rested admiral level guys showing up all of a sudden would have been too much for the navy to handle, that's why they agreed to stop the battle.<br>We still only have confirmation on the extent of abilities of WB and BB of the yonkos, the rest are still unknown.</br></br></br></br>  <br> le epic not hurt women attack </br>  <br>I like this theory about how the D is actually half of the moon and the people who have D in their names are remnants of the moon people who built the robots up there which connects it to the regular world</br>  <br>This leads me to believe that Sanji won't fight an Admiral. I'm not saying he's weak. By the end, I think Luffy will fight the main ''villain'', Zoro will fight an Admiral and Sanji will fight someone that's on Doffy's level. Which is still impressive. I really don't see Luffy/Zoro/Sanji fighting 3 Admirals separately at all.</br>  <br> Ponyglyphs' actually moon language <br>I kinda want this.</br></br>  <br>I really gotta watch this movie</br>  I just watched Strong World and did anybody else find it a little out of character that when hearing about the East Blue bombings, Luffy was just like "Welp, let's go back" and saying they can just restart their adventure.<br><br>I just feel like that doesn't really sound like something he would do. I mean he didn't even go to help Ace when he heard he was locked up</br></br>  <br>DREAM</br>  <br>Ace was a pirate. Both Luffy and Ace knew what that meant. Luffy was prepared to die every second of the journey. East Blue was a ''symbol of Peace''. East Blue has nothing to do with their fight, so to say. East Blue has tons of Luffy's friends and memories. It's where he grew up and where Daddan is. He went and fought the entire World to try and save his brother. You think he's going to just sit and watch as his entire childhood gets destroyed ?</br>  <br>Dude, wat ? He DID go to help Ace when he heard he was locked up. Luffy and the crew never knew where Ace was in Thriller Bark. All they knew is that Ace was dying/sick/not healthy. Nothing else. For all they know, Ace probably just lost a fight. They knew the paper would grow back when the person gets healthy so they were all happy. When Luffy realised Ace was going to be executed, in Amazon Lily, he immediately wanted to go to Impel Down instead of leaving it to Whitebeard.<br><br>It is sounds Exactly like something Luffy would do.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No because it would make no fucking sense.<br><br>Why wouldn't people who KNEW and SAW Roger fight react to Luffy using his fruit?<br><br>It would be a complete bullshit retcon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this the only reaction image you own?</br>  <br>he's claiming the exact same thing you fucking dingdong</br>  <br><br>Well he was supposed to kill people just for insulting/laughing at his crew.<br><br>I don't think he's a completely good guy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I swear I'll flip out if X Drake isn't named D and D stands for Dinosaur.<br><br>I'll put my face through a window I swear.</br></br></br>  <br>That was early in the series wasn't it? Expect that to be brushed aside and ignored. Roger will just end up being luffy 2.0.<br><br>Or is that .5?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah misread.</br></br>   thanks to toei we will never get one piece remade into a high quality anime   <br> Expect that to be brushed aside and ignored. <br>why?</br></br>  <br> Anonymous <br> 4chan <br> reaction image <br>Do you realise how these things work ?<br><br><br>His name is like Diez Drake or some shit. A man can't have that many D's. It's unnatural.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Shanks is so strong how did that Sea King manage to bite off his arm?  <br>This was when kid Ace went rage mode and started assaulting people. So, not really that early.</br>    <br>What exactly is keeping the Yonko's from overpowering the marine?<br>I mean we saw that the entirety of the marine together with the shichibukai didn't have the power to take down 1 yonko and his crew.<br>They may hate each other but aren't the marines the common enemy of every pirate alive?</br></br></br>  <br>He is...<br><br>DOUBLE D.</br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean never? They might sell the rights to it in a couple of decades, when they can't milk it anymore.</br>  <br> Toei <br> Selling any of their properties <br> Implying any company can make as much money as they do with their sucessful properties <br><br>Look at what happened when Saint Seiya went to another studio</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>HE BET IT ON THE NEXT GENERATION</br>  <br>Not really. The Marines don't actively fuck with the Yonko but the Yonko's themselves keep each other at a stalemate.</br>  <br> X D. Drake <br>I'm not sure I'm ready for the shitposting that would bring with it</br></br>  <br>DOUBLE D's are fine! Triple D's are too much! I know he's a dinosaur but let's not make him a monster.</br>  <br>I dont think I am either</br>  <br>X D. Rake, you dingus. His crew is 'Broom'/'cleaning equipment' themed.</br>  <br> shitposting <br>Funny because Waterloo didn't get enough</br></br>  <br>As funny as DDD would be I think it would X D. Rake</br>  <br>I hope you're wrong nigger, I'm fucking waiting everyday for<br><br>Luffy vs Aikanu<br>Zoro vs Fujitora<br>Sanji vs Kizaru</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I want Franky to fight Kizaru, but that's never going to happen - it'll be Vegapunk or some shit.</br></br>  <br> sanji vs kizaru <br>if sanji wins 1on1 with kizaru ill eat a shoe, screencap this</br></br>  <br><br>The problem is nobody at all should be able to defeat Kizaru, but he handicaps himself.</br></br>  <br> D. stand for different Dimension <br> the people from the other dimension are evil and want to invade the mirror universe <br> marines are building up a army to fight them <br> Akainu is gonna be killed by the Gorosei who are the real final boss <br> Luffy and Law are the chosen ones and use their nakama powers to defeat them <br> timeskip <br> now they have to fight alien monsters for some reason <br> Luffy's kids are called Salad and Borito <br><br> Believe it </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just from that opener, which I think happened before Oda forgot Sanji existed and used to be a rival for Zorp.</br>  <br> Franky to fight Kizaru <br>That doesn't even make sense<br><br><br>Oh you mean IKUZE SHINING RUNNING FOREVER</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think kizaru is going to be the villian of an arc or at least have one major fight against a non strawhat. He's the only admiral of the original 3 that hasn't done anything</br>  <br>Let's be honest here. Does Sanji have it in him to defeat either Pekoms or Tamago?<br><br>Sanji couldn't even scratch Vergo.</br></br></br>  <br><br> that doesn't even make sense <br><br>'That' pic + lasers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> no dragonballs <br>i am disapoin</br></br>  <br> Luffy vs Akainu <br><br>why can't I possibly imagine Luffy defeating Akainu in a 1 vs 1? I mean, I know there are several people who expect it to happen, but I seriously can't see that happening with some major asspull / another timeskip (and this one is debatable too) / a 5 vs 1 gangbang<br><br> mind you, I don't even like Sakazuki that much </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji hasn't revealed Okama Kenpo yet.<br><br>I think Oda might try to pretend that Sanji+Okama Kenpo is almost as strong as Zorp</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy and Sabo vs Saka</br>  <br>Not really anybody could scratch Vergo except maybe Luffy.</br>  <br>Sorry but I honestly can't see it happening. I was hyped about this kinda scenarios when I first started following the series but as I grew, I realised it probably isn't going to happen. <br><br>Take a look at most, if not all, all Sanji's opponents. They all have some kind of ''kenpo''. Some kind of weird martial arts technique. Sanji doesn't just get paired up with some guy who kicks. Not at all. And Kizaru is arguably one of the stronger Admirals. if anything, he'll be the one to fight Zoro. <br><br>Luffy fights the Fleet Admiral<br>Zoro fights Kizaru, who Rayleigh tango'd with.<br>Sanji May fight Rokyugu, if he is some type of Martial Artist, or he'll fight someone strong, like, Kuma's level of strong.<br><br>I really can't see this Monster Trio vs 3 Admiral scenario. And I quite honestly am not that disappointed about it. I think it's for the best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>without*</br>  <br>sanji has the shittiest timeskip growth, its so fucking stupid, he's so fucking underpowered i feel like any SH member can defeat him now(even usopp, since he has haki now and shoot the fucking shit out of him in the sky)</br>  <br>Zoro hasn't used Asura either.</br>  <br>These coloured scans are excellent, is the guy/group doing these still active?</br>  <br>Luffy will be Pirate King, he will be the strongest person alive<br><br>dealwithit</br></br></br>  <br><br> next/whatever chapter <br> Big Mom's ship rekt <br> Nami, Brook etc. Enel faces <br> Don't mention this again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The only guys we've seen who are clearly above admirals are WB and Shanks. <br> WB <br><br>What a bunch of imbeciles you Whitebeard Pirates are!<br><br>Well I suppose it's no surprise your captain being who he is.<br><br>After all Whitebeard is nothing but a loser from a dead era!<br><br>Gold Roger conquered the entire Grand Line. He gave his life to open the door on a new era the Great Age of Pirates. A Navy man like me probably shouldn't say this but that man truly deserved the title of "Pirate King".!<br><br>What is Whitebeard when compared to that? I mean did he even have the guts to fight against Roger? All he's ever done is hide in some safe corner of the world and keep himself out of trouble right? These days some fools may claim Whitebeard's name alone upholds peace on various islands. But as far as I'm concerned he just intimidates the small-fry and believes himself a hero for it.<br><br>Ridiculous! Roger maintained his honor as long as he lived and even dead his fellow pirates hailed him as a king. In other words Whitebeard is an eternal loser who will never surpass Roger! That is all he is.<br><br>Everything I've said is the truth. Now that I think of it he sure is one pitiful man. Making all his underlings call him their "Old Man" or "Father" or whatever and sailing the seas playing house.<br><br>He reigned the seas for decades yet he never became a king or gained anything. He got himself stabbed because one of those foolish "sons" of his believed every word I said and now he'll die to protect that same fool. Truly an empty existence.<br><br>If man does not live righteously he does not deserve to live at all! You rogue pirates don't deserve a "place to belong"!<br><br>Whitebeard will die a loser! A fitting end for a little fish in a big pond!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ya'll niggas forgetting there's a green guy we don't know who Sanji could fight  <br>and its funny because I used to root for Sanji pre-timeskip because he was pretty bad-ass</br>  <br><br>u wot m8.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Enel would roast Nami and Sanji on sight out of principle.</br>  <br>Look, I know this 'Sanji is so weak lel' thing is mainly a joke but I honestly can't tell if you're joking or not. I love Usopp to death. He's one of my favorite characters but it's fucking retarded if you think Usopp mastered CoO and knows perfectly well how to use it and actually hit Sanji.</br>  <br> implying <br><br>luffy's new gear form is overpowered, doffy couldn't even cut him because he is made of haki infused rubber</br></br></br>  <br>sure thing, that does not mean that I cannot dislike the fact (if that ever were to happen) of him soloing Sakazuki and alikes.</br>  <br><br>Perona didn't get roasted though.</br></br>  <br>Usopp isn't even aware that he used CoO</br>  <br> Strings, thin pieces of strings, used as a slashing attack <br>compared to<br> Fucking magma. <br>Really, anon ?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Like fucking hell once he gets used to it and can spam it like G2/G3, jesus. <br><br>Also, just wait for more forms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> luffy's new gear form is overpowered <br><br>it would be if it weren't for the problem of it having a time limit and a fucking gigantic drawback.<br><br> doffy couldn't even cut him because he is made of haki infused rubber <br><br>I'd argue Doffi couldn't do shit against him in that form because it was used after Doflamingo was severely weakened from his own internal organs being slashed up, and even then he would've won in a pure 1vs1 because Luffy needed the support of all of the gladiators after gear 4th ended while Doflamingo was still standing<br><br> now I'll pass out as a Doffifag but really, I'm not, I'm just stating what I think </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Perona was a side character and clearly helping Zoro<br><br>Enel is a crazy man who doesn't give two shits about nuking a peaceful place.<br><br><br>Exactly. After all this, when he wakes up, he's going to be just as confused as Coby was. Or he may not even notice it. He would go about his day thinking it was adrenaline or some shit. He won't realise what he did unless he talks to the Monster Trio.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>Its time to rewatch Film Z.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy <br> Almost passes out after 20 minutes <br> Still didn't knock Doffy unconscious <br><br> Akainu <br> Fought fucking Aokiji for 10 fucking days <br> Won <br><br>You do the fucking math.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not even kidding, sanji hasn't even used anything decently strong other than bbq kicks and flying, I'm not sure whether he has anything up his sleeves(none used against vergo/mingo) but it probably is underwhelming as compared to luffy and zoro. Usopp has shown growth after the timeskip, developed haki and he probably has some one of a kind seed projectile just waiting for a strong opponent.</br>  <br><br> I'm not sure whether he has anything up his sleeves(none used against vergo/mingo) but it probably is underwhelming as compared to luffy and zoro. <br><br>You know Okama Kenpo will be strong as fuck, it has nothing to do with Sanji - it's Oda.</br></br></br></br>  Man, I don't know about you guys but Brook's dub voice does the YOHOHOHOHO damn perfectly  <br>if your haki is strong enough it doesn't matter if its lava or anything really.</br>  <br>Usopp unlocked Haki. He hasn't developed shit. He may not even know it was Haki. Why does everyone forget what happened to Coby when he unlocked CoO ? It took him 2 years to get good at it. Same for Sanji, and he's supposed to be the specialist. <br><br>You think Usopp would have fucking beaten Wadatsumi (with Jinbe's help), beaten Vergo and beaten Doffy if he just had CoO ? Fuck no. He'd die in seconds. <br><br>Look, if Sanji is 100, his growth is shown to be about 130 or so. +30. Usopp is only at about 50. His growth is about 40-50. These numbers are obviously arbitrary and not to scale or whatever, but you get the idea. <br><br>I'll say it again, I love Usopp. I love him way too much. But this is just silly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not sure whether he has anything up his sleeves <br> he probably has some one of a kind seed projectile <br> I'm not even kidding <br>did you miss your lobotomy appointment?</br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw sanji busts out ivankov's techniques in his next big fight <br> mfw sanji's new ultimate move is version of Death Wink that channels the power of his eyebrows to fire in a spiral pattern </br></br>  <br>Yea. Except Haki isn't the end of the World. Luffy passes out after 20 fucking minutes. Even if Akainu was 1 punch away from K.O, he'd just have to flood the place with magma for Luffy to horribly die. And Akainu obviously won't get rekt that much in 20 bloody minutes. The dude fought another Admiral for 10 days straight. Luffy gets rekt if he doesn't eat Meat after fights.</br>  <br><br> Death Wink <br><br>I actually understood whether it was a technique or from Iva's fruit (obviously Hell Wink was due to his fruit)</br></br></br></br>  <br>and you're assuming Luffy's gear 4th haki is stronger than Akainu's how exactly? Basing on what? Instinct? Headcanons? And no, I've never assumed the contrary if that's what you're about to answer, I simply think Akainu is overall way stronger. I'm also sure that Luffy would doom himself by using Gear 4th against Akainu, there's no way in hell he would be able to defeat him in such a short time</br>   Luffy vs Yonko <br> Luffy vs Sakazuki <br> Luffy vs Smoker <br> Luffy vs not allied supernovas <br> Luffy vs Coby <br><br>Any other rivalries?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lobotomy <br> yfw it would be like Zoro testing out Shusui, and the blast gets absorbed or whatever and turns into a bigger, more destructive one <br> yfw Brook dies a 2nd time because he can't stop laughing <br> yfw Sanji did more damage to the crew than Big Mom </br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy vs   Zoro </br>  <br> Luffy vs   Gorosei <br><br> seriously the Gandhi one always holds a sword, it can't be just to show off right? </br></br></br>  <br><br>They looked too 'figured' to be nothing if you get me.<br><br>They just can't be for show.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nothing to do with his fruit, Bon said it himself, he blinks with such force he creates a shockwave, so its not even a technique or something like that, just pure raw power.</br>  <br>It'd be Zoro vs Gandhi. He might have the Shodai Kitetsu. He might actually speak against violence or whatever but actually fights like an absolute pro.</br>  <br>Raw sexual prowess. What a guy.</br>  <br><br>Oh ok, that would be cool then.<br><br> Sanji appears with dress and eyeliner <br> shit's going down </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw it's the 4 yonkos against 4 of the gorosei and Dragon against the strongest one <br><br>it's NEVER going to happen for several reasons, but god would that be a perfect setup for a shitton of badass chapters</br></br></br>  Making some Film Z webms, anyone have any requests for scenes? I'll be doing a bit of Sanji's fight after this one.<br>Trying to find the optimal size to look decent and still be large enough to see.</br>  <br>Yea, it'll never happen sadly. I don't think I'd even want to see that actually. I more want to see Akainu + the Admirals fight them. Aokiji included. Garp would be in the background, throwing shit at Kuzan and his opponent, laughing and making fun of them.</br>  <br>Fuckin' Luffy going ham on Zephyr. That shit was amazing looking. Don't make it too long, just make it like 15 seconds or whatever, getting the juiciest bit and make it decent quality and I'll be in your debt for 5 minutes.</br>  <br><br><br>Could be everyone vs. everyone, Oda said the final fights will dwarf MF and I don't see it doing so unless it's a massive mosh between all the world's powers.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't think I'd even want to see that actually <br><br>provided the Gorosei are some monstrously strong fighters, I think I'd love that to happen. Then again, we yet have to see what the yonkos can truly do so</br></br></br>  <br>yes, that would be a dream for me. Everyone vs everyone fights best fights, there's always the coolest shit going down there, absurd cooperations and synergies and improbable matchups and such.</br>    <br>Oh, of course. It's a guarantee that pretty much everyone would be there and the arc would take like 3 years to finish but goddamn the hype levels would be through the roof. <br><br><br>Yea, I know, it's just that I don't really like the idea of Teach and Big Mom fighting with Shanks and Kaido. Teach, because I want him to be a plain villain and it would be odd to see him help the others. Big Mom, because she's my least favorite Yonko.<br><br>It'd be cool and all, I just prefer some other ''never gonna happen'' scenario to happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji would seriously be the coolest character in the strawhat crew if he wouln't job that much, seriously pre-timeskip Sanji was at the very least a 8/10. Always fucking off to appear when he's actually needed. Like that time at the mr.3 arc or as mister prince or as the hunter and so on</br>  <br>if it's going to be a bigass pirates vs wg war I highly doubt Blackbeard of all people wouldn't be there. And assuming Shanks doesn't die before then, he'll be there as well. They may not be friends, but in such a situation they would be 'forced' to cooperate, and that to me would lead to some interesting scenarios.</br>  <br>this scene?</br>  <br>Haki makes him either broken or pointless.</br>  <br> Sanji was the only one to remember to open the gate after Luffy beat Lucci </br>  <br>Ohhhh, I love it when Luffy does that. Gets my blood pumping like nothing else. Thank you very much, Anon. Could you please also do that scene from the Trailers when Luffy is still clothed and goes ham on fodder, I think ?</br>  <br> I didn't think it would be this effective <br>Bastard planned it from the start. Also, forshadowing Bon-chan's sacrifice + Okama kenpo ?</br></br>  <br>this?</br>  <br>Not quite but I won't complain. It might not be against fodder and he may not have been clothed actually. I'm severely retarded. I meant when Luffy goes Gear 2 and screams Z's name in the trailers.</br>  I started reading One Piece Party because it was brought up earlier in the thread, and I love this page  <br>forgot image</br>  Oda's editor talks about Dressrosa:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Cir<wbr>LmTzDldk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>I loved Luffy's reaction to meeting Sabo. It was so adorable to see this mad cunt, who looked like the devil when he fought Doffy, cry and lose his cool like that. To say it was heartwarming would be an understatement.</br></br>  <br>I did too.<br><br>I'm in tears</br></br></br>  I'm still mad about the time skip.    <br>I'm crying.<br><br> They think he's still relevant to the story <br><br>I fucking lost it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah it's just one punch he does in gear 2</br>  <br>Story wise, design wise or character wise? Story wise it was great, design wise it depends on the character, character wise it was bad.</br>  <br>Same. As a Sanji fag that really got me.</br>  <br> Brook is the only one without a skull tattoo <br> Confirmed for sole survivor of crew when OP ends </br></br>  <br>Design and character, yes.<br><br>The only crew i really liked post skip is Usopp.<br>My two biggest disappointments though are sanji and franky.<br><br> Oda literally forgot about sanji for more than a year <br> Make him fights unfair characters and seem weak as fuck <br><br> New franky design is horrible <br> That robot armor is cool as fuck, but he can't use that often </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What could be at One Piece that holds a price higher than a city of fucking gold?</br>  <br>I think character wise it depends on the character too. Not really disappointed in the other characters except Sanji. I'm actually liking Franky and Robin more after time-skip too</br>  <br>Is this from the latest movie?</br>  <br>Yeees, that's the one. I fuckin' love Luffy going all out like that. Thanks again, bro.</br>  <br>I still have mixed feelings about Franky, but I must say it really makes sense for him as a progression. Besides, only his first hairstyle was really bad.<br><br>His battle with Señor was fun, but I hope he gets a serious moment soon.</br></br></br>  <br>So Oda just didn't realized the word "mom" in English was pronounced phonetically like "mahm" and that was why she was originally called "Big Mam" years ago, right?</br>  <br> Besides, only his first hairstyle was really bad. <br>yeah his headcanon was awesome. plus it'll be fun seeing him change his hair every arc which i'm expecting him to do.</br></br>    <br><br> picture for ants </br></br>  <br>If you mean 'English' as in British areas. They say it as ''mum'', I believe and the American'esque places say ''mom''.</br>  Whether you think Franky's new design is shit or not, we all have to admit his post-ts figure is the most glorious op figurine to date.  <br>Thanks, now I have a bigger version, here have a smug face of best Animu character</br>  <br> What is this, a picture for Tontattas? </br>  Why are all these fags saying sanji can't beat kizaru. Do you not realize sanji will take advantage of kizarus weakness. If sanji uses a mirror then half of kizarus move won't work  <br>kek</br>  <br>That combined with his old hairstyle makes him look absolutely badass. His legs don't look like chicken legs either. It looks more proportionate and normal. That figurine looked fucking awesome.</br>  <br>Oda did say in an sbs that kizaru will be defeated by a character using a mirror but he didn't specify who. But it probably will be sanji</br>  <br>Does someone know if this is still buyable, I only got into OP last year</br>  <br>Of course he will, he should do it even more times per arc, at least two. He had two styles for FI (almost bald and pre time skip), one for PH (beetle) and two for Dressrosa (pigtails and cannon). <br><br>Though I still hope he uses his pre time skip one more.</br></br></br>  <br>don't make me sad anon...pls</br>  <br>Good thing Sanji conveniently has an afro with a piece of mirror stuck in it from a previous battle against someone in a War field, huh ? Phew, close call.</br>  <br>not even. Black beard or Colbi and the five elder stars.</br>  <br>Try the buy threads. I don't really know much about these things.</br>  <br>"death flag," you are such a fucking tool.</br>  <br>Thanks, I tend not to browse buy threads</br>  <br>Do you know any good doffy figures?</br>  <br>he saw the Dressrosa arc coming from a mile away and said "fuck that birdshit, call me when Wano rolls around, that shits gonna be tight"</br>  <br>see<br><br>Sorry. I just know that image from seeing it one of the previous threads.</br></br></br>  Well, now that Bellamy is confirmed as an ally and not dead, what are your thoughts?  <br>He's not gonna stay behind like Vivi or something, right ? Especially since he's a yakuza mob boss.</br>  <br>he is. Strongest Shichibukai, followed closely by Dofy, then Jinbe, These are absolute facts.</br>  What is your upcoming wano arc sidestory? Some corrupt daimyo, another pirate ruling the county like doffy?  <br>Did anyone in their right minds think Bellamy was gonna die and he was not going to be an ally ? Did those people even read the arc ?</br>  <br>Wano vs Kano instigated by Kaidou</br>  <br>This guy gets it, those old fuckers are the real deal.</br>  <br>D is not a letter but a symbol.<br>Everything in One Piece points towards the moon(s), including the Tenryuubito's space suits.<br><br>D is a half moon.<br>Ancient Weapon Uranus is somehow related to the moon.<br>The secret Doffy knows of also weaves into this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's an adventurer at heart, he'll join up with SH's eventually</br>  <br> ally <br>plsno<br><br>That motherfucker should've just died. The most uninteresting and unlovable character this arc had to offer.<br>Why was he even brought back? Exactly what purpose did he serve?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah many thought it, but now it's confirmed.<br>Also that shit with Luffy prior to the Doffy showdown was kinda intenste.</br></br>  <br>Strongest shichibukai will be the 7th one, which we haven't seen yet. It's always like that, bosses always do appear at the end.</br>  <br>Kuma could probably take Jinbe, no ?<br><br><br>They're living under the fear of Kaido. The Samurai's are trying to get rid of him to free the country from his grasp but they can't get past the Zoans constantly coming back. Then the Strawhats show up and Zoro wrecks like 25 Zoans in one go and everyone jizzes their pants. <br><br>Then the Ryuuma side story begins.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Bellamy was the most useless character this arc offered </br>  <br>I'm kinda hoping he ends up with Law.<br><br>Gonna be interesting to see how he feels when he wakes up.<br>He still might be all dejected that Doffy hates him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even then Bellamy was showing regret and crying about his decisions. I knew he was going to be an ally the second he said ''I won't laugh at you any more''. Then Luffy actually cheers for him. Then he says he can't assassinate Luffy. Even gets beat up because of it. And he actually thanked Luffy for putting him out of the fight. I think it's awesome that he's getting redeemed. <br><br><br>That's not Trebol and Diamante.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would be perfectly fine with a Ryuuma side story</br>  <br><br><br> Ryuuma side story <br><br>Perfect.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is still Rebecca lol. And Machvise. And Chopper.<br><br><br>eeyup<br>See pic, which one is Raftel, guys?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> coverstory arc: Bellamy follows marines and tries to show himself as a donquixote family member. at the end fujitora gets tired with his bullshit and takes him too </br>  <br> I think it's awesome that he's getting redeemed. <br><br>Oh fuck no. I seriously hate redemption stories and fucking Bellamy is the last one i wish to see in one. Just kill him while he is sleeping</br></br></br>  <br>I know they were all worse then Bellamy, I was laughing at the dumbass who thought Bellamy was the worst</br>  <br><br>Guys there is a whole manga about Ryuma.<br>It's called Monsters and was drawn by Oda.<br><br>It's a Kaito Kid - Detective Conan kinda crossover.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's definitely gonna happen. Hell, we might even see a half-sibling or something of Zoro. Luffy and Nami are the only ones in the crew with siblings, right ? I can see Zoro maybe getting one but actually not having a clue as to who it is.<br><br><br>Does Chopper even count in this arc ?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I know I've read it - it would be great if Oda just adapted it into the story.</br></br>  <br>It was my opinion Anon. Shit, I;m not saying everyone has to like the guy, that will literally never happen. As much as you hate him, he's not going to die and you should just accept that already.<br><br><br>Yes, we're aware. That's where the theories of Zoro being related to him and stuff comes from.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Devil fruit tree, ancient weapons, Lost History. Gold is far from the most valuable thing. Pound for pound, most illegal drugs are more valuable then gold in our world for example.</br>  <br>Law's bloody fruit was like 5billion, wasn't it ? That shit's almost 10 times higher than the highest bounty we've seen.</br>  <br>2 cities of fucking gold.</br>  <br>is he zoro's father?</br>  <br><br>When will Frankinator get a mirror and cyborg his back? Or will it be a series long gag? Or an army of nano bots? Man. their are so many cool upgrade possible for him.</br></br>  <br>I don't think it was ''made'' out of gold, in that sense. We saw the ruins and Enel had stripped all the Gold from it and it all fit into Maxim so it's even that much, really. Granted, Maxim was big but not everything was made from Gold and chances are there are treasures in One Piece that is far larger. Just look at this massive haul.</br>  <br>Fairly sure he's been dead for a few generations.</br>  <br> Bellamy sneaks into the cell next to Doffy's in Impel Down somehow and continues to vie for his approval...forever </br>  <br>he already did, that's one of the things he changed post timeskip</br>  <br>Nakama.</br>  <br>He didn't, read his fight with Señor Pink again.</br>  The epic thread continues!  Chinks in about 2 hours  <br>I find that the whole puritanism bullshit where one or two bad comments or threads suddenly make an entire community cancerous somehow (usually baited by the people who then call it cancerus) way more of a problem.<br>So please fuck off, I'm sick of all this dramatic bullshit where everyone focuses on identity.

It's easy to recognize them since they always use the same pattern.<br><br>Every time someone posts something they don't like, they say it's cancer.<br>Every time a thread is created from Monday to Friday, they show up and say "fuck off with your shit thread" and "stop bumping your own thread" even if the discussion before they appeared was completely healthy.<br><br>Do like me : ignore them and only reply to the good posters. If you feed reversetrolls, they are just going to keep replying and will shit up the threads even more. The guy who used emoticons in the previous thread was bad, but these reversetrolls are much worse. TG threads went completely downhill because of them.<br><br>Remember, it's always the same reversetrolls, remind other people of that and ignore them.<br>They'll get bored eventually.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>This page still looks absolutely absurd to me.</br>   people use the thread of the samefagging shitposter as a real one <br>Kill yourself</br>  <br><br>We will never get rid of that shiteater, won't we?

A more well-proportioned face.</br>  <br>Yeah I like it. Too bad we won't be seeing his face in Haise's memory soon.</br>  <br>Looks really good, his half kakuja looked pretty good too, a shame he had to job.</br>  <br>He's a bad guy but I really liked his character. He died too early.</br>  Clowns are really getting back in the picture in this chapter , looks like Suzuya sqaud will be investigating them  <br>That is pretty interesting how CCG is just blindly connecting them with Aogiri while they are just fucking with everyone.</br>  <br>You fucking serious? Mods always doing their fucking jobs.</br>  <br>It is what they want the ccg to think</br>  <br><br>It's always the same people who hates TG that they dedicate themselves to shit up the threads. At this rate, I could really care less and I don't even bother posting anymore because the replies are mostly newfag tier le troll crap or someone trying to spite me by saying ebin memes. Seriously, the urine/trap/troll clownlelelel posts that flooded these threads for the past few months have been overused so much that their only purpose is to bump a shitty thread. It was funny the first few weeks but now it's like fucking a broken toy. I blame imperial's shitty job on bringing turds into these threads so barely anything is discussed except how bad they do each chapter gives another opportunity to derail the thread. At any rate, I hardly come to these threads besides looking at spoiler pics. There's only good discussion around when something big happens but lately it''s slice of life crap before the next big arc starts.</br></br>  <br>They are just too dimb for the Clowns. The fact that they still can't catch Uta even if his kakugan is showing 24/7 in plain side is a proof.</br>  <br>Well, he's wearing sunglasses outside and I doubt that a Ghoul Investigator would just randomly stroll into HySy.</br>  <br>This<br>Also when Haise went in, I don't think he particularly gave a fuck.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  Meanwhile at IS "NA NA NA" <br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/17Zwq2_njezILPbhozSwR-Fq-c1iXeR<wbr>ckRj9H3MyBrVw/pubhtml</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>The fact he shows them so obvious is how he keeps the attention from ccg away</br></br>  Why is CCG so dumb? Ghouls wear masks so it is better to trace every mask makers in TG amd test them for RC cells. Haven't they thought of interrogating some random ghouls for mask maker info?  <br>Don't look into the plotholes , it wil ruin your life</br>  <br>Pic related.<br><br>It's often N/A on Saturdays. The releases have been faster recently, so they will probably come out tomorrow.<br><br>That's a wise advice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> police tracking for Tsumugi - another mask maker rather than CCG. <br>Even the polices are smarter than them.</br></br>  <br> Fast but shit quality. </br>  <br>Then they would just not have shops out in the open. There is also nothing they have as evidence proving it is a ghoul who is making the masks, for all they know it could be a human. Spending resources on that instead of looking for active ghouls is stupid.</br>  They could go undercover as a ghoul and ask for masks  <br>Anon think of it as tracing out drugs. Do you investigate all active drug users or do you investigaye drug dealer?</br>  <br>Thank you for contributing to my point.</br>  <br>An OVA about homo prince? Literatelly why? Why does Pierrot or Shueisha think this anime needs useless stories about useless characters?<br>What I fucking demand is the manga route, akka Don Kaneki and more of my loli Hinami. If they are planning to adapt :re with these OVAs I am going to lose my shit. My butthurt will be legendary.</br></br>  <br>Because money. More homo princess=more money. Have we ever needed an entire arc dedicated to homo family and drama? No but it still exists because of money.</br>  <br>this so much. <br><br><br>Whats so confusing about it? Only time I've been confused was when I watched season 2 of the anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br> How and why is this trainwreck of any anime making any profit? <br>Welcome to the world named as merchandise:<br>https://twitter.com/tghoul_check<br>https://twitter.com/tkg_anime<br><br>Also the OVAs are about Autisma, one of fujoshits' favorites, and homo prince, literately the king of the fujoshits.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> To confirm his future semen container? <br>Yeah, best family has to keep procreating.</br></br>  Next chapter predictions?  <br> Because money <br>I better get Don Kaneki out of this in the fucking future or else Pierrot, I'm going to spit on your faces.</br></br>  <br> Next chapter predictions? <br>More people walking around, few panels of homo prince and his fanboy.</br></br>  <br>I personally think there will be another ccg character will be introduced and will be forgotten in 10 chapter</br>  <br>My bad, I forgot that even a picture was enough to feed a reversetroll. I shouldn't have replied.<br>Still, I can easily picture you smiling like an idiot behind your screen. It's kind of sad to know that such people exist. Don't you have anything more interesting to do in your life?<br>I'll be the bigger man and stop helping you to derail the thread. Have fun, shitposter.<br><br><br>I wonder how they'll handle the lines about Tooru usually calling Haise "sensei". They never translated that if I recall well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The only thing I'm hyped about TG in the game.<br>But those disguising Rio's sideburns.</br>  <br><br>Ovas are fujobait, anon.<br><br>Indeed. Pierrot is pandering to fujoshits. Nothing new.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Homo princess crying and demanding to know about Kaneki <br> Haise wandering around and talking to more new characters <br> Urie weight lifting his edge. </br></br></br>  <br>is that a water mark under tsukiyama's left eye or are those tears? Looks like an 11</br>  I just want this shit arc to be over with.  <br>Is Pierrot trying to make TG their new Naruto or something or I'm getting crazy over nothing? I mean Yona and that shoujo show about a wolf god got also two OVAs.</br>  <br> this shit arc <br>Those chapters can even be considered as an arc? They are about SoL, fujoshit pandering, occasional secondaries being interesting and nothing else.</br></br>  <br>Masks aren't inherently "bad" for you though, and there's no guarantee again that the guy selling them is a ghoul, if he isn't then have a good time trying to catch one of his clients (that is if he actually deals with ghouls).<br><br>And again, if they do end up starting to scout mask shops they can go underground. I mean, the ghoul life already is.</br></br></br>  <br>Let me guess. Your favourite manga is Nurutu then.</br>  <br>Ghouls are known for their masks and it's not like they celebrate Halloween in Japan 356 days of the week. If anything, it warrants a investigation or a stakeout.<br><br> My bad, I forgot that even a picture was enough to feed a reversetroll. I shouldn't have replied. <br>Did you even read his post? Or are you just paranoid?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are funny.</br>  <br> Or are you just paranoid? <br>You know what he is, then again you are replying to him. You should be ashamed of yourself.</br></br>  <br>Asa in the novel said that Uta was living a dangerous life by making masks for people. This is pretty similar to Chie since they do not think of their lives as value and only want to live the best of their time.<br>If this matter has been noted by her, I don't see why there has not been any signs of CCG finding clues about masks. Mado had to conduct a RC test on Applehead to confirm.</br></br>  Thx to the information of this chapter i think next arc will focus on the clowns who will torture Haise to re awake Kaneki because of the parallels  I still don't understand why homo prince's fanboy and his human pet think showing him a photo of Haise is going to fix anything. <br>According to what I understand homo prince's problem are his shitty genes that are interfering with the control of his kagune, so he needs quality food.</br>  <br> You should be ashamed of yourself. <br>Literally why. He sounds like a newfag who doesn't know any better.<br><br>It's a matter of doing something so unconventional that people wouldn't suspect anyone being this ballsy. But I think it's the government trying to respect privacy if it had happened before. A big crackdown on ghouls may have attracted unpopular public opinion. Or it could be ghouls having strings in the government like some high class families.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He sounds like a newfag who doesn't know any better <br>Just check who he mentioned in his comment and you will have your answer.</br></br>  <br>Nah his problem is his grief over Kaneki's "death". Well Kaneki is still buried 2 ft under Haise's faggotry.</br>  <br>Yeah, he still sounds like a newnugget.</br>  You will never eat Anime-chan's stroganoff.  <br>Kirika in general is beast now</br>  <br> I was just pretending to be an idiot </br>   sacrificial girl <br><br>Oh, so Carol's plans also require Hibiki to get her shit together and fight. Good, she can be useless as long as she needs to and world won't be destroyed in the meantime!<br><br> Elfnein called Shirabe a goddess <br><br>Is Fine's soul fine then? Or she just doesn't know Fine's dead now?<br><br><br>He tried to meme you, so you would think commeme is a thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm more inclined to believe that Commie shit the bed even before getting proof. It's what they're known as.</br></br>  <br><br>I'll admit that after 1 and 1/4 seasons she's finally gaining some points. I couldn't stand her in the entirety of season 2, now Shirabe is at the bottom.</br></br>  Why can't Tuesday come fast enough?  Because some students are on Summer vacation and they want it to last as long as possible?  <br>They need to die.</br>  Have the previews to further whet your appetite.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ghS<wbr>uUnii_58</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Snw<wbr>DoP8aoRA</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  ***,319位/***,322位 (***,393 pt) [*,*11予約] Overlord<br><br>Not doing too bad. This is definitely the work of LN readers though. I doubt animeonlyfags are interested enough at this point.</br></br>  <br>I-I don't get it.</br>  <br>i just marathoned the first 2 episodes, any other similar cartoons to this one?</br>  Would you want a blowjob from a mouth like this?  <br>I'd take a blowjob from a vacuum cleaner bud</br>  <br>Anime only shitter here, It's okay but like the Anon said above it's not really clear what the story is so far or how it's going to progress. <br><br><br>Maybe if these people attack the Bone King and the NPC engage in battle it'll be good and interesting.</br></br></br></br>  I want to see this entire thing animated.  <br> MMO shenanigans flashback <br>Not sure if like..</br></br>  Ainz-samaaaa  <br>What, you don't want to see how Momonga met Touch Me?<br>Heresy.</br></br>  <br><br>I generaly dislike huge power gaps but this LN is so damn fun.</br></br>  <br>Going by the pacing, MAYBE at the end of episode 4 it will show where the series is going. That depends on if they actually add the scene.</br>  <br>What makes it better was that she caught it from the back of the sword.</br>  <br>I wonder how Brain would feel if he saw the Takemikazuchi Mark 8? Would he experience temporary insanity like the mage guild boss?</br>  <br>Ever since Akuma no Riddle these sort of evil expressions turn me on.</br>  <br><br>The best part of this is trying to imagine his face. I doesn't even have to be Takemikazuchi, Cocytus would suffice.</br></br>  <br>I love the coloring in akuma no riddle, the art director are doing a great job.</br>  <br>Well I mean just the weapon. He was already jizzing over obtaining a normal Katana.</br>  Animefag here, i kind of dislike how the series is thus far. To be precise, i dislike the relationship between Mr. Skeltal and the NPCs. The fact that theyre all getting wet just from him speaking to them, not to mention always assuming that everything he does is according to some masterful keikaku of his and not just him wanting to take a fucking walk. <br><br>If they actually added some diversity, as in there are NPCs who dislike Bones but still respect him, NPCs who are neutral, those who dont see him as an authoritive figure. Albedo could have been protective of Bones and actually make an effort to keep the other NPCs in check while treating Bones as if he were a child (Momonga-sama, please dont be bothered bla bla, i shall take care of everything blabla).<br><br>Im just giving examples, im sure you get the gist.<br><br>TL;DR: this looks like shitty wish-fufillment thus far, can LNfags tell me if it gets any better regarding character interaction?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your opinion is duly noted. Perhaps a show like K-On is more to your liking?</br>  <br>Is it really wish-fulfillment when Bones' only wish is to be left alone?<br>If he didn't have the whole Nazarick transferred with him, he would have become an undead explorer.<br><br>The miscommunication between the NPCs thinking their guild master is some genius, while he's actually "just a salaryman", is  fun .<br><br> Sorry for buzzword abuse </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> evil overlord has minions <br> said minions dont like him and dont listen to orders <br> said minions arent loyal at all and wouldnt jump off a cliff if told to <br><br>No anon, you're just fucking retarded. What you're asking for doesn't make any sense, unless someone put that shit in as flavour text. The penguin does have said text, but he is still loyal as fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <a href="http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437200144578.webm" target="_blank">http://i.4cdn.org/wsg/1437200144578<wbr>.webm</wbr></a>  <br>Its silly how badly she btfo of Brain, when she told him to "use Martial skills already" after using his super trumpcard "god slash" i felt kinda bad for him. Then again seeing him them run away like a bitch was hilarious.</br>  <br>The fact that the women all immediately wanted to jump his literal and figurative bones did kinda reek of wish fulfillment bullshit. <br><br>Them being loyal wasn't the issue for me.</br></br></br>  <br> Then again seeing him them run away like a bitch was hilarious. <br>I ain't even mad. At that point it's every man for himself.</br></br>  <br> TL;DR: this looks like shitty wish-fufillment thus far, can LNfags tell me if it gets any better regarding character interaction? <br><br>Welcome to the world of anime.<br><br>But they do end up doing things against his wishes later on though. They each have their own wants and needs alongside their loyalty to Papa Bones.<br><br>Cocyutus for example  wanted Momonga to spare the Lizardmen instead of exterminating them because he felt a "kinship" with them as warriors. <br><br>Sebas  gets a human girlfriend despite Nazarick being EXTREMELY anti-human, and the ones that Papa Bones save are just barely tolerated by the others. <br><br>Narberal  keeps getting pissed at humans and keeps having to be chastised by papa for being a bad bunny. Pic related <br><br>Shalttear  also tries to kill him at one point as well. Then she became his chair. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They where MADE by him and his friends. And Albedo is specifically supposed to be in love with him. Shaltear is just a horndog. Plus, they're all afraid he might leave them one day like the other guild members did. It's not like all of this is out of the blue. But I suppose the anime didn't explain it well enough.</br>  <br>He's a creator of them, of course they do. He's basically their god, without all the religious bullshit. In addition, its obvious why Albedo does, and Shalltear, well, thats because she has some real funky fetishes</br>  <br>Albedo wanted to because of her adjusted description that Ainz made as a joke and he felt disgusted at himself when he realized what that joke makes her do.<br><br>Shalltear is just weird like that.<br><br>Aura doesn't seem to mind either which way though. But then she's only a 74 year old brat so who can say?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The thing is that Momonga didn't expect this shit, he was thrown into it. It's not his fault and one of his greatest worries is that the NPCs will betray him.</br></br>  Whens Ch. 2?  <br>2 hours probably. Maybe less.</br>  <br>KOTAE WA DOKO EEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br><br><br>Hey I understand why it happened and it was explained well. I just wish they didn't do it.<br><br>It just kinda irks me on a conceptual level.<br>Like being the uberpowerful evil Overlord isn't enough, he has to have women fighting over him from the get-go too. <br>It just feels like it's too much, too soon.<br><br><br>But if it actually leads to something good, I'll eat my words.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>SAGASHITEEEEEEEEEEEE</br>  <br><br>anyone have a gif of this?</br></br>  <br>WITH MY SOUL</br>  <br>It isnt unsual for children to love their creators</br>  <br>no. but I have a webm grandpa. <br><br><br> WITH MY SOUL I guess </br></br></br></br>  <br>Well there is a reason why LN fags calls Ainz Papa Bones.</br>  <br>I'd prefer a gif but t-thanks, papa bones</br>  <br> uberpowerful <br>He's actually pretty weak</br></br>  <br><br><br>So none of you think some actual conflict between characters other than who gets to be Lord Skeltal's bottom bitch would be interesting?<br><br><br>Actually Anon, you're the retard. I clearly stated that i was giving examples, i just didnt want to go out of my way to list obedient types other than Semendemon since, right now, all of the gaurdians seem fully obedient. If it was up to me, i'd make Shaltear the bitchy one who constantly goes against Skeltal's word (so the hostility with Albedo can be justified) and have Demi be the one that acts nice but doesnt actually care about his orders. Cocytus can be netrual as in he doesnt dislike nor like Bones, but hes obedient. Same for Sebas. All the others can go ahead and be wet for the skelly dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>WITH MY HEART</br>  <br><br><br>August 26 when?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice</br>  <br> So none of you think some actual conflict between characters other than who gets to be Lord Skeltal's bottom bitch would be interesting? <br>You mean the shit that happens later?</br></br>  <br>Albedo isn't loyal, she is only in love. Sebas pushes Skeletor into doing good things.<br>I like Demiurge's role of overexplaining everything that Momonga does to make it seem like some kind of master plan. The part in volume four when he does this is one of the best parts of the novels in my opinion.</br></br>  <br> So none of you think some actual conflict between characters other than who gets to be Lord Skeltal's bottom bitch would be interesting? <br><br>i honestly doesnt even recogblnize anyone being the wife or some shit.<br><br>I mean the fact that Ainz is a skeleton makes everything null. Nigga doesnt even get a boner anymore which is ironic for a being made of bones</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is very specialized, that doesnt make him anywhere close to weak. Stuff like "The goal of all life is death" is beyond broken. So far only time weve seen him get serious was against Chair that is set up to be his Hard counter, and he came out on top. Calling him "pretty weak" is just plain stupid.</br>  So far im only watching still because the premise. The pacing is absolute shit. Two episodes in and we're barely past an introduction of the area and characters. <br><br>Last episode was literally him going outside. That's it. Then an additional 15 minutes of his minions sucking his dick. <br><br>We get, they adore him, move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shalltear isn't his hard counter, he just didn't know that Peroronchino had given her a counter to his super death spell.</br>  <br>what happens in August 26th?</br>  <br> Then she became his chair. <br>Truly OTP.</br></br>  <br>Like I said, I didn't read the LNs.</br>  <br>well then strap in buddy. You're in for a ride.</br>  <br>http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/ZM<wbr>CZ-10179</wbr></br>  <br>Lets see, undead that uses holy magic, has lance that heals when it deals damage so minions are NG, overall very good stats, resistances, ressurection item. She is literally the worst possible opponent for Ainz who specializes in death magic and summons. Even Ainz was shocked how it seemed like Peroroncino made her as if she was designed to take him down.</br>  I'm not the only one who likes the ED, right?  <br>OP and ED are both great.</br>  <br>DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION!</br>  <br>I would prefer Shalltear but it's still pretty good</br>  <br>I'd really rather he not. It's pretty obvious he has some desires that just won't be satisfied. Stop promising people stuff yo don't know that they'll get.</br>  <br>Eh, he can do what he want's. Doesn't affect me.</br>  <br> By the way, why are you dressed like that? <br> Bukubuku-sama wanted me to be a trap <br>I fucking knew it.</br></br></br>  New translation vol5 when?   “Simple, just pick one person and cut off his arms. That way, the others will compare themselves with him and know that they are more fortunate. How wonderful. And to make the one whose arms were chopped off feel blessed, we just need to chop off another person’s legs. Ahh, I made so many people happy!” <br>Fucking clowns.</br>  Still waiting on non-Funi subs for episode 2.  <br>Everyone must be happy.</br>  <br>What you're looking for, just plain and simply wouldn't make any sense. If we are going to use bad writing seriously, what you just said would be a good case of it.</br>  Do people even know how much of a beating the concept would get if even one of Papa Bone's children wasn't loyal? The one time it happened, it almost brought him to his knees and there are actually people who want it hard-coded that some aren't loyal.<br><br>What, all the women want his dick? I'm pretty sure I counted only two and both want him for different reasons. Of course, there's  Ivileye  later but that's just hopeless.<br><br>Call it wish fulfillment or whatever but I'd rather not read about Papa Bones now trying to get his subordinate's loyalty. That ship sailed when he and his guild members created these people.</br></br></br></br>  <br>skeleletons dont have dicks</br>  Obligatory:<br>http://crossfade.io/#!/zmtnt7j93j</br>  <br>ED lyrics where?</br>  <br>Equality i happyness.</br>  post reaction pics  <br> emoticons <br>Fuck off Ainz.</br></br>   tfw accidentally spoiled myself about the poor little girl sufferings. <br><br>I want to get off Papa Bones wild ride.</br></br>  <br>No stops on the papa bones ride</br>  <br>I'm kinda bored of stories where the hero has to fight to rise up, fail, try again and improve. I had enough of this.<br>A nice SoL of a god among mortals is a nice change, and if the god is an evil one, all the more fun.<br>Besides, being an overpowered evil overlord already includes women fighting over you. It's in the package.</br></br></br>        <br>Poor  Arche . <br><br>Think of it this way. There's NO WAY  she'd have been left free and alive in a way that wouldn't make her want to kill herself. Her fate was sealed the minute she took the job. Her death was sealed the minute her faggot teammate opened his big mouth. </br></br></br>  <br>Was that the first time Momonga actually got really mad?</br>  <br>Imagine having subordinates like that .. <br>Momonga must be fucking tired from all of their bullshit.</br></br>  So-Bin makes ballin armor.  <br>More like So-Based. Seriously, what's his story, how did the writer get such a cool artist?</br>  <br>Why does chair need armor?</br>  <br><br>I just reached the interlude of the second book.<br><br>Does the author explain who the old woman with the dress is?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno. He's done a lot of commissions though. <br><br>http://so-bin.tumblr.com/aboutme</br></br></br>  <br>Kinda sorta.</br>  <br>i know man but what i fucking hate about it is that the author madd me carw about her. Not to mention her little sistee would be waiting for her oneechan that will never go back ;_;</br>  <br>We can only hope author has mercy for her little sisters, in the long run if nothing else.</br>  <br>Don't worry, they'll still be able to  hear Onee-chan's voice. Entoma has it, right? Bug girl Maid </br>  <br>That throat looks perfect for fucking</br>  <br>Aye, sweet lullabies from them. Inb4 author blinds them (at the hands of slave traders) and they really believe she's still alive.</br>  <br>I find it hilarious how the author made people this much invested in a one volume only side character. Although, if we go by history and Ninya, her sisters will probably show up somewhere  I hear they did in the WN. </br>  <br>   Entoma <br><br> I hate that disgusting thing so much. </br></br></br>  <br>Arche was keep alive in the WN and even teach Papa Bones how to dance.</br>  I fucking hate Altina, loli bitch should get used as fertilizer for Enri's field in Carne  <br>Better yet, why can't volume 3 adaptation be here now?</br>  <br> why did you kill them? <br> why did you kill them? <br> why did you kill them? <br> why did you kill them? <br> why did you kill them? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Loli doesn't want to spare a single wolf that threats her life <br> She wants to be Empress <br>Just let her get eaten then, geez</br></br></br>  <br>Why is she so flat?</br>  <br>AINZ - SAMAAAAA!!!!</br>  The novels are boring as fuck, I hold no more hopes for this anime.<br>The protag just NEEDS to overthink every small step in endless detail.

Everything I've started watching is because I see people on here talking about it.</br></br>  <br><br>Yamada is equally annoying</br></br>  <br>Surprisingly, I didn't find her too annoying this episode for some reason.</br>  <br><br>fucking slut</br></br>  <br>Kinda sad, I don't want my SoL in which I feel bond with characters to end  I will probablz feel sad for few days and move to another frenchise as always ;_; </br>  <br>To be honest, I'd rather have them finish it than drag it for another season, there's barely any content not yet adapted.</br>  <br>This. Finish strong.</br>  <br>It got 3 seasons, which is more than most anime get.<br>It's ok.</br></br>  YAMADAAA  <br>Yamada ?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Km<wbr>-yfase3k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  OP2 &gt; OP1 &gt; OP3<br>ED1 &gt; ED2 &gt; ED3</br>  <br>Adsoluting hetstupid!<br>Since it was another antiyuri twist</br></br>  <br>OP1 = OP2 &gt; OP3</br>  <br>Acceptable opinion. Just this makes OP2 better than OP1 though.</br>  <br><br>OP1 = (OP2 + OP3)^2<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=1oN<wbr>8RPklUac</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think the only thin we'll ever agree on is that the S3 OP/ED's are vastly inferior to the others period.</br></br></br>  Poplar or Popura?  <br>Katanashi or Takanashi?</br>  <br>Yamada or Yamada?</br>  Why is Komari best girl?  She's a mature lady.    Womanlets, when will they learn?  <br>Best body.</br>  <br>Because she's loved by the bestest girl</br>  That's a weird way to spell Natsumi  <br>Because she's pure minded.<br>Also, the full OP is out. It's so good.</br></br>  renge is objectively best  Best.  <br>SHIN<br>KAN<br>SEN</br></br></br>  All the Mosaics are good  Stay funky.  <br> All the Mosaics are good </br>    So why the new timeline?  <br><br> new timeline </br></br>  Hey, don't bully Koma-chan.  Suguru is best girl  <br>They're all dead, this is purgatory.</br>  <br>She is pure minded because she has non-functional ovaries. She has no libido.</br>  <br>Koma-chan is built for bullying.</br>    <br>What's that?</br>  <br>Did you watch Higurashi? It's like that. We have to solve the mystery. Hotaru is Rika.</br>  <br>Because she's so  bullyable .</br>  <br>I thought that was Kirino Kousaka for a second.</br>  OPN manga will be publishing in Poland!  <br>I always wondered. Why is it sometimes Indonesia instead of Poland?</br>  kurwa<br>siema<br>kto pl<br><br> polandball is great </br></br></br></br>  A5 format ;]  Deer in the headlights moments your favourite anime characters...

That's really some shitty forced drama.</br>  http://mach20.org/slide/read/assass<wbr>ination_classroom/en/0/148/page/2</wbr>  <br>I got triggered by how the first group wrote "help him" instead of "save".</br>  <br>The previous translation was shit and dumping at least gives the threads a little more life.</br>  <br>Exactly!</br>  <br>No, it isn't. He just wants to save him because he thinks sensei doesn't deserve to die after listening to his flashback.</br>    What is this expression trying to convey?  <br> I'm not talking about them generally getting any sort of sexual thoughts. I'm talking about them explicitly starting to see the girl, who has put herself in a sexual context, as a sexually available object. Respect for her diminishes. <br>When a guy talks about sex it's also understood that he's open to sex, otherwise why would he be talking openly about it in a public space?<br>If a girl talks about it it's obvious she might want it too.<br>If what really insults you is the fact that they are being treated as sluts, you really should walk with more women. I can't even count how many times my  female friends  go around talking about guy butts and how hot they are and etc and etc.<br><br>It's the same shit.<br><br><br>Yeah, some of them are pretty solid, but some are just logical Olympics.<br>The most correct thing in it is that porn and sexuality in general is still focused on the man, but this has been changing so fast you can't even blame the society anymore, just the people that are still locked into the idea of "I can't do it because it's wrong".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ayyyy lmao neets writing essays  <br>But cultural mindsets have been created by people, who decided what is ok and what isn't. Those decisions and opinions, like all decisions and opionions, are partially influenced by instincts,hormones, etc., so I'd say neither of those theories has more backbone than the other. Both are simply unproven theories.</br>  <br> Yet you do not see them actively as sluts, degraded human beings, etc. <br>Not him, but i see them as hopeless scum. Worse than porn stars, actually.</br></br>  <br>Why?</br>   no Shimoneta thread <br><br>Let's fix that</br></br>  On a scale of 1 to lewd how lewd is this anime?  <br> still no feet version <br><br>Sad.</br></br></br>  <br>Good.</br>  <br>No bully pls</br>  <br>I've only watched two episodes and so far is very tame, maybe a six, but I hope someone correct me.</br></blockquote>]
