[ Literally the only character with common sense in the whole fucking fate universe.<br><br> Died </br></br>  <br> Comon sense <br> Killed hundreds or maybe thousands of innocents  <br><br>It's somewhat bizarre the fact that he killed Shirou's family and adopted him. Is also Bizarre that Shirou never thinks about it</br></br></br></br>  <br> killed shirou's family <br>More like failed to save Shirou's family</br></br>  Your underage is showing.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128614808 <br>Being on /a/, caring about F/Z plot</br>  <br>Don't mistake pessimism for realism. He assumes the worst possible outcome in any given situation. His most proficient magic was related to time and its manipulation to change outcomes. His worldview only works when everyone around you is trying to kill and betray you.</br>  <br>It still works if everyone around you wants to help you, given how fucked up it is.</br>  <br><br> dedicates his entire life and lineage to a stupid, incredibly painful and stressful cause because "muh villiage" <br><br>That's pretty much the opposite of common sense, unless you were referring only to how he fights.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His ideology may be stupid, but his way of fighting gets shit done, instead of muh magic honour, no guns allowed</br>  <br>Kiritsugu had to die for the same reason Spike had to die. The antihero doesn't get to see the world saved because he doesn't want to. He just wants to hurt the bad guys.</br>  <br>SIX BILLION PEOPLE</br>  <br>The series would have been better if there are other's that know how to bend the rules like him</br>  <br>That's more like the only magus with a combat sense rather than common sense.<br>Magecraft isn't made for fighting to begin with, so why should magi have combat sense, exactly? This is like demanding a scientist know exactly how to turn their chemicals into high explosives and where to place them to bring down architecture.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that what scientists are doing today?</br>  <br>The level to which Gilgamesh would completely wreck his shit forever is a big reason why not. The power levels in the show fluctuate like its fucking DBZ. Tohsaka goes toe to toe with fucking caster. For a prolonged period of time. Guns have a pretty finite power level so he's tied to the same fate as homura where he uses guns and bombs while Gilgamesh is fucking opening the earth's womb and drawing out the concept of 'sword' and cutting time and space or some shit.<br><br>I mean he basically is homura vs god madoka at that point so I guess we could see some cool power stealing shit but it wouldn't be fun.</br></br></br>  <br>Yea the part about scientists breaking down buildings makes sense, i'm not joking</br>  <br>And in every route ,in every series, lancer dies a shitty death</br>  <br>There are weapons scientists, but if you think a geologist or a neurologist would make a good one then you have no idea what science fields even do.</br>  <br>The powerlevels in F/SN and Zero are very consistent, Nasu and Uro just know that being more powerful doesn't mean you're going to win.</br>  <br>Got me there man :c lancer is my favorite class. <br>I don't know the show is fucking retarded and at the end of the day its the power of friendship that wins it all and nothing matters.</br></br>  <br>You're actually retarded if you think the "power of friendship" has any role in F/SN and Zero.<br><br>The only Fate work Nasu's written where that shit shows up is CCC.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought CCC was the power of love.<br>Not, like, "I l-like you senpai" love but "I want to ride your dick" love.</br></br>  <br>I thought "i love you senpai" and "i want to ride your dick" aren't mutually exclusive?</br>  <br>A human being has the most powerful noble phantasm in Stay which is powered by mana given to him by his friend/love interest. The noble phantasm being a plane of existence where he is basically a god.<br><br>And we are comparing this to where he was earlier in the series making sticks slightly harder.</br></br></br>  <br> Unlimited Blade Works <br> "the most powerful noble phantasm" <br> "where he is basically a god" <br>You don't actually know anything about this story, do you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Reality marble in which he can copy all other weapons and their abilities as long as he has seen them. Just about every other class' offensive noble phantasm is based upon their weapons so he technically has access to that too. <br><br>So he just copies rule breaker, makes a hundred copies and fires them around just doing whatever the fuck he wants because that's what Unlimited Blade Works does.</br></br></br>  <br>Creating a hundred copies of Rule Breaker would be functionally useless, Rule Breaker has to be personally stabbed into someone. It doesn't work at range.<br>Beyond that, it doesn't kill servants, merely sever the connection to their master. Almost all servants can still fight on after that, Berserkers excluded.<br>Beyond that, effectively all servants can deal with a barrage of 100 copies of the same extremely shitty weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>I love kiri2gu but it's better when he dies. It also makes F/SN much more tragic in retrospect, considering how Shirou tries to follow in his footsteps.</br>  <br> common sense <br><br> fucked up in Fate due to Fuyuki fire <br> most likely fucked up in Prisma resulting in adoption <br> still fucks up in Miyuverse by going mind of steel again </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rule Breaker is not nearly that 1 dimensional. Rule Breaker ACTUALLY negates magical contracts with objects and people and noble spirits it comes into contact with. It causes magical bindings and contracts to 'betray' the other party of the contract. <br><br>So you could theoretically use it to break the connection with Gilgamesh's treasures and the Gate of Babylon, for an example.</br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't work on NPs</br>  <br>He was trying to be morally gray and never realised he was stuck in a black and white setting. That' no common sense.</br>  <br>Archer and Gilgamesh endings are pure friendship. Yes, even as a girl.<br><br><br>This may surprise you but UBW is actually pretty shit by Reality Marble standards and is mid tier as an NP.<br><br>Its also not powered by friendship.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW is actually pretty shit by Reality Marble standards <br>I don't actualy think you can realy compare RMs.<br>I mean how do you compare it to Lair of the Beast King for example?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm just saying that its raw combat potential is seemingly lower than most of the other ones we've seen before.<br><br>Its obviously got its niches where its way better than some of them and such, but its still not the best of them.</br></br></br>  <br>No, that's bullshit.<br>  Of course, there are limits. No matter how low the rank, it is impossible for Rule Breaker to affect a Noble Phantasm. <br><br>It only works on magecraft, which most heroes don't use.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What is the raw combat potential of a World filled with Chaos?<br>What is the raw combat potential of Sacchin's RM?<br> Remember it only drains ambivalent mana , not the odd </br></br></br>  <br> What is the raw combat potential of a World filled with Chaos? <br><br>Considering that the description of it is nearly exactly the same as the description of EA's attack? Probably huge, not to mention what we know of it non-speculatively is insane.<br><br> What is the raw combat potential of Sacchin's RM? <br><br>Not to sure, never played Melty Blood so I've not seen much of her.<br><br>Caster in Extra/CCC and Iskander both have pretty strong ones as well, and unlike UBW aren't said by Nasu to be pretty useless versus most servants so it can be assumed they're well above it on the tier list.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Caster in Extra/CCC <br>What?<br> Considering that the description of it is nearly exactly the same as the description of EA's attack? Probably huge, not to mention what we know of it non-speculatively is insane. <br>I mean he's basicaly unkillable but that's because he constantly deploys it in his own body.<br>The only 3 "offensive" moves he has are<br> spitting out parts of himself that become some sort of animal, he can't controll what comes out <br> Absorbing people if they are trapped <br> turning into the 999th Beast <br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Iskander  <br>That's a noble phantasm that functions like a reality marble, not truly a reality marble.</br></br>  <br>Correct me if i am wrong but isn't Nrvnrsqr's beasts are a sort of RM(what i mean is that he basically has his RM on at all times to summon beasts and shit). <br>And Sacchin's RM, from what i've gathered, pretty much drains mana from everyone inside of it at a fast rate but don't take my word for it, could just be one of her abilities.<br><br>And i never played with Caster in Extra but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a non-conventional reality marble. It's a world egg that can be deployed. We have reality marble subspecies, so not everything literally has to be internal world --&gt; external world.</br>  <br>Meant Alice, not Tamamo. Should have been more clear.<br><br> I'm an absolute Nero-fag but he's hard to quantify offensively <br><br>True, its hard to determine his exact power level, but I still feel its a safe bet its higher up there than UBW.<br><br><br>Its an irregular RM, but it still is one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Alice is a cheater and Archer still defeats her, so how could the queen's glass game be above UBW?</br>  <br>Because you use the Vorpal Blade to counter the Jabberwocky aspect of it. It'd be impossible for him to normally defeat her by his own power.</br>  <br> but i heard that as a heroic spirit she is pretty OP. <br>You heared wrong.<br>She's one of the weakest servants seen so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Nigger what<br><br>Tamamo is a fucking monster, she's mid-high tier in Extra and an utter beast in CCC</br></br></br>  <br>She's literaly the weakest out of the 3 low tier servants you can chose from.</br>  <br>CCC involves her getting her Origin form and then being boosted by the Mooncell due to being an aspect of a Solar goddess. Normally shed not be nearly that strong as a Servant.<br><br>You're right though, even normally she's a very respectably powerful Caster.</br></br></br>  <br> Nero <br> Archer <br> low-tier <br><br>Now I KNOW you're messing about. They're both mid-tier at worst.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>As a real heroic (or monstrous) spirit, Tamamo is unfathomably powerful.<br>But Hakuno didn't summon her that way, and got the mortal Tamamo, who is amusingly pathetic, but tries really hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As a real heroic (or monstrous) spirit, Tamamo is unfathomably powerful. <br>Only in the monstrous form.</br></br>  <br>Tamamo is mid-tier at worst as a servant even in Extra where she is at her weakest in canon.</br>  <br> being able to defeat Lu Bu, Shuwen, Gawain and a gimped Arc <br> low-tier </br></br>  <br>You are aware that this is literaly stated to only be possible because of Hakuno, right?</br>  <br> Artificially boosted by Aoko </br>  <br> fighting for utopia <br> pessimist </br></br>  <br>Sorry but please reread F/Z or even watch the anime if you don't realise that Kerry is a pessimist</br>  <br> getting your true stats restored after having them all reduced to E rank by a shit master <br> "artificially boosted" <br><br><br>Hell if anything its doubly impressive she probably beat most of them while still somewhat weakened</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> true stats, could literally give her EX strength if you wanted to gimp her. <br><br>I imagine you if stopped at her real stats, the later game would probably suck.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope you're just shit at comprehension.</br>  <br>It's not like enemy masters were complete retards though.<br><br><br>They mostly say "oh i got closer to my true power, nice". They only really say "wow you got my stats higher than they actually were" once you get them too high, around EX or so. And i only got them that high when i was messing around with cheat engine to see stats-damage relation(and it appears that pretty much every stat boosts your melee and skill damage, even luck; fucking Caladbolg went from 3k or so to 7k after i boosted luck or agility, don't remember, each stat increases damage by different amount though but it still increases) so you'd need some grinding or focusing only on one stat. <br>I actually beat the game without super charging my servants or anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her true stats are pretty much the recommended build for her.<br><br>Small amount of phys stuff for early game, then just pump mana absurdly high.</br></br></br>  <br> Only character with common sense  <br> Not mentioning Waver or Kayneth <br><br>Heck, even Tokiomi was less of an idiot.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaynet <br> I'm just gonna walk straight into the base/workshop of one of the 3 founding families of the grail war <br> Tokiomi <br> that Zouken fellow sure seems trustworthy, as does Kotomine <br><br>I think Rin probably has the most "common" sense unless it's about social situations</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>According to Uro, Tokiomi felt like Sakura could take care of herself, trials of a magus and all that.</br>  <br>At least Kayneth wasn't a self destructive fool. <br><br>Matous and Tohsakas were friends for ages. It'd be like doubting your own brother. <br>Kirei always acted like a nice guy, nothing to be afraid of. <br><br>Kayneth's "problem" isn't even a common sense problem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Precisely because of that, it was nothing better than a godsend for the Matō house to hope to have Sakura as their adopted daughter. He had obtained the way to have both his beloved daughters inherit first-class magecraft, unconstrained by their bloodline’s consequence, and carve out their own lives </br>  <br> Kayneth's "problem" isn't even a common sense problem. <br>Remember how Rin constantly drills it into your head that attacking a magus in his workshop is basicaly suicide?<br>Remember how we actualy hear of entire enforcer and executioner squads getting wiped out while attacking someone's workshop in HA?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not Bizzare that Shirou never thinks about it because he is just plain fucking stupid and autistic in every way.<br>Why don't Fate/meme stop making their cancerous battle shounen moe/ecchi/SoL comedy video game threads and just fuck off so we can discuss a good show like Fate/Zero in peace and pretend the dumb low-budget sequel never happened?</br></br>    <br>Except that Kayneth was literally convinced that he was strong enough to murder Kerry. <br>Arrogance =/= Lack of common sense.</br></br>  <br><br>The problem was that he called the Matous shameful heretics of a failing bloodline in the prologue. <br><br>Which means he either gave her over with full knowledge of the fact he irresponsibly had another daughter, and that this was a bailout arrangement for him, making him both a bad parent and a terrible human being, or he really did change his mind about them, which would just make him an incompetent parent.<br><br>Either way he isn't a stellar parent, because getting power and being forced into a role isn't a choice no matter what he spins this with. He had her without acknowledging that only one child could get the crest and gambled on her being mediocre enough in potential that she gets under the radar, making no precautions if that didn't occur.<br><br>It's death or a terrible family who could ruin your genes and make life absolutely shit for you. The thing that keeps him from the terrible human being part is him wanting what's best for them in his own way. Doesn't save him from being incompetent though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you literally arguing that Shirou isn't a dumb, autistic fuck? End your life</br>  <br>I honestly agree with Kerry's ideals. It's just there would be no way to regulate 7 billion people on the planet. Plus until technology evolved to the point machines would take over regulating humanity Kerry would still have to rely on good old fashion humans to trust to follow your ideal and not succumb to the darkness or be an idiot to fuck up the system.</br>  <br>Tokiomi's logic is entirely that of a magus. From a human perspective, he's scum. From the perspective of magi, he's doing the right thing.</br>  <br><br>They weren't friends, they were business partners. People misinterpret the non-interference pact. Just like they had with the Einzberns, it was an agreement that basically meant they kept the winner as one of the three houses, and nothing more. A treatise between noble families, not an agreement amongst friends.</br></br>  <br> Edge: the show <br> good <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It isn't even logical from a magus standpoint. He wanted to protect her from other magi using her as materials, but gave her to the first guy who claimed he wanted her as his heir, even when he knew the family was a hair's away from extinction with rotten blood, no promising heirs to train her, and their place being exceptionally low in mage society. The only thing they have to offer is their knowledge. He was expecting a four year old to revitalize a dead house.<br><br>It would be like taking your perfect specimen child and making them have a kid with a guy with every genetic defect on the book. He just didn't even bother trying to find anyone more suitable after she was born, because he was stuck on maintaining the grail being with one of the three families. It's nonsensical if you look at it objectively.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Atleast try to pretend that you've read F/Z.<br>Tokiomi thought he was doing the best thing for Sakura</br></br>  <br><br>Parents do the wrong thing with the right intentions all the time. You can love your kids but have terrible judgement based on how you were raised. Those aren't mutually exclusive.</br></br>  <br>The best thing for sakura as a magus and as a parent (who is a magus). If he was willing to abandon the path as a magus, they probably all could have lived a happy little life without any interference. That idea would obviously never cross his mind.</br>  <br> abandon the path as a magus <br>Sure, and if Kerry just decided to kill himself he wouldn't have had to worry about anything anymore either! <br>Great plan.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh no it's literaly spelled out that neither Rin nor Sakura realy have the possibility to not learn magecraft because their talent/potential is just too big.<br> Now that he thought back, for Tokiomi, this was the best gift that his father gave him as the previous head of the family. <br><br> Tōsaka Tokiomi decided to enter the way of magecraft through his own will, and decided not to be swayed by fate. <br><br> It was indeed this preparation that gave Tokiomi an iron will. What supported him through the days of merciless, strict practices ever since then was indeed this proud overconfidence of ‘this is the way of life I chose for myself’. <br><br> If only he would be able to pass the treasure that he got from his father onto his daughter – Tokiomi thought sadly. <br><br> However, that was already impossible to be achieved. <br><br> For Rin and Sakura, there were no choices for them in the first place. <br><br> One of them has all elements, having five multiple elements as her alignment. The other has no elemental alignments, having Imaginary Numbers only. Both sisters have a rare potential that can be equated to miracles. This had surpassed the limits of so-called natural talents or inborn skill; it is almost like a curse. <br><br> A magical nature would equally gather magical powers to it. Prominent people who are far outside the rules inevitably ‘gather’ equally extraordinary experiences. This can not be controlled by the person’s own will. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he gave up his position as a Second Owner, disassociated himself from the Association, and simply went to live in the countryside so that his family could live in peace, that would be an accomplishable situation, especially in an area like Asia where the Association lacks influence.<br><br>Tokiomi is such a typical magus that he would never for a second think about giving up his path for his family because his family is a means to continue his path as a magus and his lineage's toil to reach the root.</br></br></br>  <br>Sadly he went off the wrong path. He could have been a good doctor or researcher. You can't save the world with destructive force only. I guess it couldn't be helped given what he had experienced. At least he realized at the end and was able to redeem himself.</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>True Assassin has more common sense then he does.</br>  <br>And that's with them being in the limelight of the Association, with visitors coming regularly and such. Someone like Ciel remained completely hidden despite her insane potential until Roa took over. If Tokiomi went and became a simple salaryman living in a suburb somewhere, it would reduce the likelihood of such a situation.</br>  <br><br>No, he had to adopt her out, but that was the situation after the fact of her being special at birth. He knew only one child could get a crest, and any child as strong as she was without a family's protection could be taken by the Association as material via Sealing Designation (which is dumb either way).<br><br>The imprtant part is that he didn't review proper family planning, nor bothered to take the time after she was born to make prep for that inevitability, and just called it "fate". That was his warped mentality. He loved her as his daughter but made really bad decisions.<br><br>Like Kerry did with letting the Einzberns experiment on Ilya before she was born in her mother's womb. <br><br>Good parenting is rare in the Nasuverse.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>for </br>  <br><br>Are you incapable of reading?<br>The text basicaly says that having such enormous potential draws things like Roa-possesion towards you.<br>Similiar to what Aoko said in the prologue of Tsukihime.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's too bad that despite that being the case, these special people have kids as carelessly as horny teenagers on prom night.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Why couldn't Tokiomi just let Sakura live a normal life? Just let her be a regular girl there isn't anything bad or evil about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh what?<br>Rin and Sakura are the "special" people.<br>Tokiomi is utterly mediocre<br>Also having more than 1 child is rather common among magi.<br>Sakura just had bad luck.<br><br> Why couldn't Tokiomi just let Sakura live a normal life?  <br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's more philosophy than a hardcore rule. Due to her nature, she cannot simply be the "second useless child of a magus family meant to be married off as a bargaining chip" like Sola-Ui. So long as she is part of a magus family, she will always be at risk, whether someone happens upon her while visiting the Second Owner or someone connects the dots that "Rin = super, so sister = ?". In this hypothetical situation where Tokiomi acts as a human rather than a magus to protect his family from all suffering and abandons his path as a magus, hiding themselves away would be fairly safe. There's always the chance of a freak accident, but warding away such things would be within his ability to some extent.</br>  <br>He can't protect them from "all suffering"<br>That's impossible even for normal people and as a magus the road they have to go is full of suffering.<br>And the whole thing is that they need to be taught magecraft to defend themselves throughout their lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Rin and Waver are the most sane master in F/Z &amp; SN</br>  <br><br>No, Tokiomi didn't just have bad luck, he conveniently didn't know his wife's cootch spits out superbabies, even when the 500 year old mummy next door knew since the beginning. How Zouken knew and he didn't is baffling. Then again, Zouken also knew the grail was cursed and the Einzberns didn't, guess he is the only family head with a brain, unfortunately.<br><br>Even then, when you understand that your child can have such detrimental shit happen to them if they do become that special, what stops you from just stopping at one kid and being satisfied? Rin was perfect to fit bring the heir, and he got his student. He had no need for another daughter beyond just fucking his wife without thinking of the consequences.<br><br>And like another guy said, what stopped him from actually doing his work after she was born in finding a family? That can't be refuted, because not only was him cutting all ties a dubious action at best given her real family is in the same city, but there can't seriously be no takers for super kid to be their heir, that he was desperate for an adoptive family, he even had the Edelfelt family as a possibility despite their estranged history. And yet she goes to the worst proposition ever.<br><br>You can't give him the excuse of no choices. You also have to admit he made terrible judgements of both character and logic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If they were to live as normal people without using it, it would be much harder for anyone to sense. Even though he's shit, it's not like Rin or Kotomine once sensed him at all despite how often he uses it, so it's not like they can sense stuff over an entire city or anything. They would have to run into a very specific situation for anyone to realize they were special.</br>  <br>*Even though Shirou is shit</br>  <br> Even though he's shit, it's not like Rin or Kotomine once sensed him at all despite how often he uses it <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br></br>  <br> doctor and researcher <br>he was a researcher in Miyu's universe in prisma Illya, and still fucked up in the end, and even maybe killed by shirou</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but you can't discuss F/Z without mentioning F/SN because it's just a prequel. everything fate related is based from F/SN and you can't deny it</br>  <br><br>There's kind of a difference between using one pseudo circuit and having 27 "normal" circuits and Rin/Sakura's 1200 circuits  40 main circuits and 30 subcircuits each </br></br>  <br>What does that have to do with that post?</br>  <br>But the fact that a person can using it daily within his home and constantly within the same school building as Rin without once being suspected means it isn't particularly easy to sense at long or short ranges even with active usage. Rin and Sakura have large capacities, but if they were to never use them in an area completely devoid of any magical connections, it wouldn't bring about any suspicion unless somebody were to actively be next to them.<br><br>My original point is that from a magus standpoint, giving her away makes sense, even if the recipient is of dubious credibility, but that it isn't entirely out of the possibility that an OOC decision by Tokiomi could have let them lead normal lives.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean it's kinda stated that you can't keep people with such massive potential away from the supernatural.<br>As an example I could bring up Ciel who was never found and got Roa-ed</br></br>  <br>That's less of a rule and more of a like attracts like sentiment that often applies. It's not like Rin and Sakura just existing is going to make them supernaturally attract the supernatural, but that them being like that would make it more likely. For every Ceil that's fucked over, there should be plenty that die in obscurity. it's also a testament that Ciel lasted sixteen years without anyone finding her that it's not easy as easy as having a radar that just finds magical potential.</br>  <br>It should be noted how amazing a master Hakuno is. He/she'd be able to win a Grail war with Avenger.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128614808 <br>If you were thinking of watching the anime, his death isn't even in Zero. The nigga survives Zero, then you start UBW and he's already dead for a reason they don't explain and then you have to look the shit up and come to find out that in the VN he dies in-between due to some weird "Grail affected his body shit." I was like "Whatever man I'm just rolling with it."</br>  <br> his death isn't even in Zero <br>It's the very last scene.</br></br>  <br>Shhh...he's just sleeping.</br>  <br>you realize that Shirou has sub-circuits also and all that gets counted normally is main ones, right?<br><br>Saying Rin has 1200 circuits is absurd. She has 40.</br></br></br>  <br> you realize that Shirou has sub-circuits also <br>Eh no.<br>Please point me to a single instance where it's mentioned that Shirou has subcircuits.<br><br> Pseudo-nerves within the body of a magus. <br> Magic circuits are responsible for converting life force into magical energy, and for connecting to the underlying grand sorcery formula. <br> Because the number of magic circuits a person has is fixed at birth, magi lineages do what they can to improve themselves and create an heir with even one more magic circuit. <br> Once the magic circuits have been opened for the first time, the practitioner can switch them on and off at will. <br> Each practitioner visualizes the flipping of this switch in their own particular way. For Shirou, the image is that of a gun's firing hammer, while for Rin it is stabbing a heart with a knife. <br> This image tends to be related to how the circuits were opened for the very first time, so there even those who can only open their circuits through sexual arousal or self-harm. <br> By the way, Shirou's number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27. <br> Rin, on the other hand, has 40 main circuits, while her sub-circuits are 30 each. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an idiot to a tragicomic extreme. If he had even the least bit of common sense, he could have used it to figure out his entire plan was shit even a decade before entering the Grailbowl.</br>  I never understood the shit storm about Kiritsugu. He did everything he could to obtain the grail to save the world from violence. What if you knew that when you kill 7 people the world is guaranteed peace for eternity wouldn't you do it ?<br><br> inb4 edgemaster </br></br>  Does anyone have that one picture of female Gilgamesh without a shirt staring directly at the viewer?

Every time he does anything it just makes everything worse, and just about every single time it would have been easy to see in advance that his chosen course of action was moronic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the shitposting about Kerry comes because of the people claiming he was a genious and the best protagonist ever being more complex and deeper than Shirou.<br><br>He wanted a childish desire imposible to accomplish and he was willling to do anything for it. He was both dumb and idealist, but that's not bad.<br>I personally like Kirigitsugu, but trying to argue with Zerofags is impossible thus the arguments against Kerry are always exagerated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>the motherfucker never realized that some things are worth trading the world for</br>  <br>Well it was idealistic desire but who knew that the "omnipotent wish granting device" would go "yeah, no that's not possible".</br>  <br>1. Enter the Holy Grail War<br>2. Win<br>3. Come before the Holy Grail<br>4. Make the Holy Grail to produce a result you cannot describe, in a way you cannot conceive, by presenting a wish you cannot put into words even after thinking about it for ten years<br>5. ????<br><br>His plan was shit from the very start. It was majorly flawed even if there wasn't the detail of the Holy Grail interpreting every wish as a command to kill all humans.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He could have saved more, but he was committed to the ideal "I'll never take a chance again after that Shirley thing. If it ever comes down to people being in danger, I'll immediately kill the smaller number of people in favor of the larger group"<br><br>Even the end of the story showed you why that logic is fucked, with the boat analogy. He killed the smallest amount of people, but because he will never take a chance he ended up killing the majority.<br><br>If he was willing to make some compromises he would have saved the majority in that situation, or if he had some people skills at least. His answer will always eliminate the smaller number though, he's not the only guy with logic in this series. No matter how innocent the smaller number and no matter how much of a non chance the death may be if he tries to save both, he won't take chances.<br><br>He'd kill every member of his family, if it meant he saved five people in the process. That's what kind of man Emiya Kiritsugu is here.<br><br>If someone was being held hostage by two people, he might just kill the hostage off the bat in order to effectively save the two people that are holding him up so they don't die in a police shoot out. As they might have to give themselves up now. Can't be helped, that was the smaller number after all. Yet with his track record they would still die as well, and we would still act like this made sense.<br><br>Hero of Justice these days feels like it goes hand in hand with "Killer who hides behind justice to exonerate himself most of the time, killing those that fall through the cracks himself in the name of altruism". Fate has mostly proven that a hero is one that kills those that get in the way for the majority in a sense. Doesn't matter who or why they were, but in the name of the majority its all it takes.<br><br>I'd take someone who just kills the bad guys, or tries to save everyone without compromise over that. Even if you failed on the second one, you tried to save everyone at least.<br><br>That's Batman</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please point to a single instance where any other magi is said to have sub circuits, especially Sakura who you've previously claimed has an equal number of circuits as Rin.<br><br><br>...oh, you can't? Because sub-circuits are never mentioned aside from a single time in any Nasuverse material and Rin is the only one who has ever had hers listed? And even then, only once to demonstrate that hers are particularly developed, implying other magi such as Shirou have a smaller number of them?<br><br>Well fuck its almost like sub-circuits should be assumed to be a regular part of any magi's circuitry that go unmentioned due to being unimportant.<br><br> B-b-b-but Rin has an amazing amount of magic power!!!! Of course she's unique and special and has sub-circuits nobody else has!!!!!! So I'm right to count them all the same as regular circuits when I say she has 1200!!! <br><br>Literally more than a years worth of her mana stored up in a Gem is equal to a single A offensive rank spell, and her maximum output is stated to be 1000.<br><br>Shirou can manage 270 before damaging his in the process.<br><br>If she actually had fucking 1200 circuits, 1160 of which are unique sub-circuits only she possesses, then her circuits would have to be an order of magnitude worse than his which makes no fucking sense since they're explicitly said to be high quality while his are trash.<br><br>The only logical conclusion based on the information we have is that sub-circuits are a vital part of any magi's circuitry and that they're not mentioned for anyone because they have no importance whatsoever to the story.<br><br>Ergo, Shirou has them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device if I had a plan how to execute my wishes I wouldn't need that shit in the first place.</br>  <br> Even the end of the story showed you why that logic is fucked, with the boat analogy. He killed the smallest amount of people, but because he will never take a chance he ended up killing the majority. <br>The boat analogy as Angra proposed it doesn't even work.<br>I mean holy fuck you don't change the thought experiment in the middle of it.</br></br></br>  <br> especially Sakura who you've previously claimed has an equal number of circuits as Rin. <br>It's directly stated in F/SN that Rin and Sakura have the same number of circuits<br> Shirou can manage 270 before damaging his in the process. <br>Where do you get that from?</br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device if I had a plan how to execute my wishes I wouldn't need that shit in the first place. <br><br><br>Its possible to formulate a plan to achieve fucking anything, but it doesn't mean its at all possible - for example, I could plan to kill a Rhino by having it be struck by lightning and slain instantly, but I can't summon the lightning.<br><br><br>Kiritsugu couldn't even conceive of the lightning. <br><br>Lighting as a concept doesn't fucking EXIST for Kiritsugu.<br><br>He wanted the rhino dead and fought in a death battle tournament in order to get the grail to kill it for him anyway, he had a dream but not the ability to even conceive of how it could be made to happen.<br><br>He charged blindly into it fueled by desperation and idealism, his plan was fucking awful.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CCC has no power of friendship<br><br>Though it does have "Power of Origin"<br><br>Friendship alone gets you killed every time in that game.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure,but his desire was extremely childish, and his inability of realizing if it was an unsustainable ideal made him look like a manchild. An extremely well-armed, emotionally dead, willing to do anything for his wish manchild.</br>  <br> It's directly stated in F/SN that Rin and Sakura have the same number of circuits <br><br>You know what scene that was? I actually tried to find the info on her before saying that so I'm surprised there's a canon source.<br><br>Source on Shirou:<br> By the way, Shirou's number of magic circuits is an unexpectedly high 27. <br><br>And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged right after he opens them in F/SN for the first time properly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> holding a gun while smoking <br><br>doesn't get any more edgy that this faggot</br></br></br>  <br>I'd consider the Gilgamesh and Archer endings power of friendship and the Saber and Caster endings power of love.</br>  <br> And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged right after he opens them in F/SN for the first time properly. <br>Eh no.<br>pic related<br>10times the capacity != 10 magical units</br></br></br></br>  <br> You know what scene that was? I actually tried to find the info on her before saying that so I'm surprised there's a canon source. <br><br>It was the scene with the gemsword and shadow giants  I think </br></br></br>  <br> but "I want to ride your dick" love. <br><br>Main love interest is noted to be entirely chaste, and its an innocent type of high school love between two fake humans who just recently became human, so they're still pretty childish in this manner you might say.<br><br>Its the main villain that's "I want to ride your dick" instead; despite the game acknowledging that lust and sexuality is indeed part of love and isn't evil, its simply part of it, it also shows that taken to an extreme will bring you nothing but folly. Main villain took her lusts too far and ended up losing to the innocent love between two fake humans, despite proudly trying to say that her love was the only real love.<br><br>The real lost to the fake, as her love was shown to be nothing but selfish and foolish in a way, while the pseudo humans love was selfless and for each other. Even Andersen admits defeat before this sappy type of stupid love story, then he calls his master a fucking idiot for picking a fight with the one person she never had a chance of beating even if she could beat everyone else on the planet.<br><br>Fetish and sexuality are themes in the game still; the game makes sure to weave them hand in hand with an innocent sort of love, as they aren't different things, rather that's all definitely part of love. Even if they're taboo in a way, they're certainly not evil, as everyone has such things. Goes as far as to list out the fetishes of everyone in the game. Its not like Disney where it just ends on a kiss and says that's as far as anything would go, rather throughout the plot it talks about different forms of love and meaning. Some loves are shown to be warped, yet the game does not decry them as wrong entirely either, even if they are cast down as it goes along.<br><br>MC does almost mount Nero during her route though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tamamo has nine selves, nine personas, one for each tail.<br><br>MC summoned the weakest self, the self that only relfects her ideal of serving others and loving humans, along with Tamamo being willing to take a few debuffs in order to be summoned to begin with.<br><br>If you summoned one of her more malicious selves, its noted it could get bad. Though if you summoned that she might just kill her master off the bat at worst. After all there are peronas within her like her bitterness and anger for the way she was killed.<br><br>Though her real form is one of the strongest</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posting a picture from the gilgamesh vs shirou fight in UBW and trying to pass it off as if its from the scene i mentioned <br><br>poor form, anon<br><br><br>Cheers</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was recently confirmed that Tokiomi knew about the wormrape, but didn't care as long as it meant her magic improved.<br><br> &gt;TMF: Do Tokiomi knew what was suffered Sakura after it was adopted by the Mato? <br> U: What is important is not to Tokiomi parentage but magical progress in his family. So it is aware of having literally threw his daughter. One can imagine that Tokiomi says that through his beloved daughter, he will arrive to have higher thaumaturgic powers. <br><br>[Outside interview]<br> Tokiomi knew what was going to undergo Sakura but for him, it would allow it to become a real magician. As long as it increases the potential thaumaturgical of his family, he had no problem with Sakura treatments in Mato. However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused. He also thought that if things went too far, Sakura could stop herself Zōken. Unconsciously, even if he would never have said, the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br> By against Aoi knew nothing. <br><br>Translated from a French interview</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also confirmed that he'd fucking hate Shirou as a son in law.<br><br> TMF: One last question Fate / Zero before moving on. How would he have reacted Tokiomi learning his relationship with Rin in Unlimited Blade Works and Sakura in Heaven's Feel? [Laughs] <br> U: It is not impossible that he would have been green with rage because it would penalize her magical power quest. </br></br></br></br>  <br>I feel like there's gotta be something lost in translation here. Like Tokiomi knew she'd be filled with worms but not that it'd be done via rape instead of a surgical procedure or something.<br><br>Because holy shit he is literally the worst person in the fourth war - Kotomine included - if he knew what happened to Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br>TMF : Est-ce que Tokiomi savait ce que subissait Sakura après qu’elle a été adopté par les MATŌ ?<br>U : Ce qui est important pour Tokiomi n’est pas la filiation mais la progression magique dans sa famille. Donc il est conscient d’avoir jeté littéralement sa fille. On peut imaginer que Tokiomi se dit que, à travers sa fille chérie, il arrivera à avoir des pouvoirs thaumaturgiques supérieurs.<br><br>[Hors interview]<br>Tokiomi savait ce qu’allait subir Sakura mais pour lui, cela allait lui permettre de devenir une vraie mage. Tant que cela permet d’augmenter le potentiel thaumaturgique de sa famille, il n’avait aucun problème avec les traitements de Sakura chez les MATŌ. Cependant, s’il avait su le sort de Sakura, n’être qu’une matrice pour Zōken, il aurait refusé. Il s’imaginait aussi que si les choses allaient trop loin, Sakura pourrait d’elle-même stopper Zōken. Inconsciemment, même s’il ne l’aurait jamais dit, le combat entre Sakura et Rin à la fin d’Heaven’s Feel était pour lui la meilleure chose qui puisse arriver aux TŌSAKA.<br>Aoi par contre ne savait rien.<br>[/Hors interview]<br><br>TMF : Est-ce que Gil a un Gate of Babylon dans son Gate of Babylon ? Est-ce que ça fait une récurrence infini ?<br>U : Non, mais d’autres puissances peuvent peut-être s’en dégager, parce qu’à la base, c’était une arme qui était freiné. Mais le mieux, ça serait de poser la question directement à Nasu.<br>TMF : Mais il n’est pas là…</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not omnipotent. It's just very potent. He knows the principle behind how it works, because he knows the war is a ritual to aggregate mana into the Lesser Grail, and if he had any questions he could just consult the people who originally designed it, since he's been living with them for the last decade.<br><br>However, the problem wasn't whether or not it had the power, the problem was his wish, which really just amounted to a vaguely defined desire for the world to be a nice place. He couldn't say what he wanted and he couldn't say how he wanted it. Maybe the Grail would have been more helpful if it wasn't tainted by concentrated evil, but he still would have relied on an unknown variable to formulate his wish for him, to do something unknown, to remake the world into something unknown. It's just a bunch of question marks as soon as he reaches the Holy Grail. And he had at least a decade to think this part through.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're right.<br><br>"However, if he had known the fate of Sakura, being a matrix for Zōken, he refused" sounds a lot like it means he didn't know she'd be filled with the worms since half the point of them was to put one next to her heart to function as her main body and the other reason was to prepare her as a grail vessel, which may be the 'matrix' shit it mentions.</br></br></br>  <br> Cependant, s’il avait su le sort de Sakura, n’être qu’une matrice pour Zōken, il aurait refusé. <br><br>Yeah, translation provided above for this line seems accurate based on what I recall of high school French.<br><br>I think this anon has a point here possibly also<br>  <br><br>Without knowing the original Japanese response I can't really say what he meant by the 'matrix' line since I don't recall that exact phrasing being used before. <br><br>It could refer to her being raped by the worms until they were a part of her instead of them being passed on via surgery, or just the part of him using her as a vessel for himself/the grail.<br><br>Either way he's still a fucking cunt for sending her to a household he knew was gonna fill her with worms one way or another just so she'd know some magic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>No, that's just saying if he knew she was just breeding stock, he would have refused.<br><br>He didn't care about the rape if it meant her potential increased, but he cared if she was just a means to an end to raise up someone else, y'know.<br><br>Tokiomi wanted it to be his own loin fruit that reached the end or fought against each other. Not for her to be used to give birth to someone else who would be power in a sense. It was something like that.<br><br>I can probably find original anon's summary<br><br>Original anon that translated a summary of it confirmed that much; the one I posted is just the google translate version to make it easier for people. Since it seemed like the Google translate got it close enough to be readable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> For the fate stuff, the most interesting parts is that Tokiomi knew the kind of treatment Sakura got, but he didn't give a shit, although he would have refused to give Sakura away if he knew Zouken was just using her as a womb and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. Also the Sakura Vs Rin is the best thing to ever happen to the Tohsaka family. <br> There is no gate of bayblon inside the gate of babylon. <br> Kiri views Taiga as a sister, but she's in love with him. <br> He didn't answer whether Waver will join Ionioi Hetairoi after he dies, it's a question of Waver's immortality he says. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Cheers then for the clarification</br>  <br><br>Give me a source</br></br>  <br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>http://www.studio-shaft.fr/intervie<wbr>w-de-gen-urobuchi-a-lepitanime-2013<wbr>/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it references her becoming a spare body for Zouken and being remade into a bootleg Grail vessel instead of being brought up as a magus. That she was treated as a system he could fiddle around with instead of as a pupil.</br>  <br> and he was betting on Sakura stopping Zouken if things went too far. <br><br>Its a realization in itself how stupid Tokiomi is if this counted as a plan.<br><br>She was an eight year old with no magic or understand of spells other than what Zouken himself taught her, he was a hundreds of years old vampire type being with plenty of magic and intelligence when it comes to surviving, and the first time he uses you for "training" you can no longer turn against him at all or else you're liable to be eaten alive from the inside out. He can kill you with a thought by the time you've reached the area of "Hey, I don't know about this sort of thing". Even if he doesn't have his familiars inside of you yet, I'm pretty sure he could overpower an eight year old and throw her in the pit pretty easily. No matter what she loses in that situation pretty easily.<br><br>She had no magic or power, and he expected her to somehow do something here as a powerless eight year old against this wormpire?<br><br>He's stupid<br><br>Teach her some magic first if you want this to actually be a plan, but for now that's just fucking stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If this is from 2013 how comes that it has never been mentioned here or at BL?</br>  <br>Zouken at this point is patheticaly weak and uses nearly all of his magical energy to keep himself alive.</br>  <br>Even Rin couldn't kill him when she was trying, despite her getting the chance to fight him twice.<br><br>When it comes to survival, he's an existence that surpasses servants as a roach. He can beat up or capture an eight year old just fine.<br><br>Guy almost killed Shirou pretty easily in the story as well. Even without a servant for either of them, Shirou was right about to die and he knew it. He was able to surprise Zouken by almost summoning Saber, which created a slight stall effect despite it not working, and then Rider bailed his ass out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See this is yet another reason I think that this guy  may be onto something<br><br>It really does sound like he only knew she'd be treated like shit and have worms shoved in her, not that she'd be raped by them in the process, made essentially a slave, and used solely to carry Zouken's main body worm/prepped for breeding/turned into a grail vessel.<br><br><br>There's a lot of interviews even with Nasu that have never been translated or even found by the Western community due to them being in disparate magazines and various fansites only, I can believe one minor French one with Uro slipped through the cracks.<br><br>But yeah, it does seem somewhat suspicious.<br><br><br>But if Tokiomi actually knew what he was doing to Sakura he still should have known there'd be no way for her to EVER fight back, unless he was just so arrogant he assumed she'd come up with something even he couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> See this is yet another reason <br><br>I'd just say Tokiomi really is that stupid<br><br>He has that kind of track record here.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I just really wanna believe that even he couldn't be that much of a callous, arrogant, massive retard.</br>  <br>But given certain circumstances you can only save one, or none. When both isn't a option, it's clear that you have to make a choice or just lose everything all together. There's is no "try to save everyone", that's the same as trying to pick both when it isn't possible. You can only hope for a miracle or take action.</br>  <br> over 7 billion people in the world  <br> your evil for thinning the herd <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey there Grail-kun</br>  <br>Fuck off, Gil.</br>  <br>I tend not to have too much faith in the guy. He has this sort of luck where he caused basically every problem in F/SN. Giving his daughter away leading to HF, summoning Gilgamesh leading to humanity almost dying, having Kotomine as his student and causing him to be corrupted, giving Zouken power by honoring that old thing they had between families when he would have basically passed with no harm if he hadn't given him such an ace since it was noted Zouken was plum fuck out of options before that point and he wasn't going to get a magus potential child out of nowhere except in this sort of situation, etc.<br><br>Not to mention in the two worlds we've seen where Tokiomi was still alive when Rin and Sakura were still around later on in life, they're a bit fed up with the guy. At best he's that embarrassing sort of father, and at worst they really tend to avoid him. Even if those are a bit jokeish scenarios.<br><br>Non joke scenarios though its noted if he was alive when Rin reached adulthood she really wouldn't be happy. She would have either abandoned magushood entirely and run away from home, or become a cold witch dead on the inside.<br><br>He's a guy that tended to fuck up things, and had a coldness about him that few fans tended to get, even if he still had fatherly feelings.<br><br> In the eyes of young Rin, her father Tokiomi was a great magus who must be respected and loved, but as for the coldheartedness that accompanied the ideal, that was a negative aspect of his personality that she failed to understand. <br> If Tokiomi had survived until the time when Rin could have really understood her father’s personality, it would certainly have deeply affected the development of her own personality. Whether she would oppose that inhumanity and leave the path of thaumaturgy, or whether she would become a “perfect and coldhearted” witch like her father – no matter which one, this parallel world, for Rin, would certainly be one far away from happiness. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's is no "try to save everyone" <br><br>Batman would pick that choice, he'd find a way.<br><br>A good version of Shirou would also pick that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but there's also a quote by the Butcher that Rin got her kindness from Tokiomi can't quote because I'm on mobile</br>  <br>Its this coldness and inhumanity people tend not to get, thinking he must really not be good. For him the ideals of a magus are above everything.<br><br>Part of him in this logic would say Sakura would be glad to be raped a lot if it meant she had a chance to be a real magus, to have a chance to reach the root and earn glory for all magi ever.<br><br>He thinks with the glory of mages ideal above all else, his humanity or family self is a very distant second.<br><br>For him, the most unhappy thing for his daughter would be to not live as a magus if she had the potential. To have such potential and let it go to waste, she'd be miserable, she'd much more go through some shit and be able to use it instead. If she almost died a thousand times or was tortured in order to become a magus, he thought she might prefer that due to his inhumanity.<br><br>After all being a magus is the ultimate glory, and to try to reach the root is the only thing we should strive for.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Takeuchi: He was a character whose image changed 180 degrees from what I hat thought in the early stages. However, now he has become a character who can't be pictured any other way <br> Urobuchi: Since Rin inherited her kindness from her father, I was given some hesitation about killing off his character, and so I ventured to put him in the position of the bad guy. However, by personal standard, he's a traditional person without a single thing wrong about him. <br><br><br>I think he means she originally inherited it from him, so he made him more of a prick so it'd be easier to have him killed off the way he did - but he was still the perfect example of a traditional magi even then.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's sort of right in that after all the shit she's been through, she still likes the practice of magic. If she had been brought up in the mindset of reaching the root, she'd probably be more typical.</br>  <br><br> you can't thin the herd and make life better for everyone  <br><br>Anon pls</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;summon a Servant so shit the only halfway realistic way to win is to keep a low profile and engage in hit-n-run tactics while hoping Lady Luck smiles on you <br>He isn't shit though. He isn't the most skilled Knight in the round table for nothing.</br></br>  <br>He's the Rorschach of the Fate Universe, only rabid utilitarian instead of rabid deontologist.</br>  <br> Diarmuid <br> Knight of the Round Table <br><br>I think you may have misread</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, shit I thought you meant the other K man. Why most of the 4th war masters have similar names?</br>  <br> Common sense <br> Tries to achieve an impossible dream </br></br>  <br> There's is no "try to save everyone" <br>This guy tried. He was going to save literally every person to ever live and die in any universe. Even that ginger chucklefuck limits himself to one universe when he talks about everyone. He had a plan and everything. All he needed to do was win the Grailbowl and then let Shakespeare work his magic, and then everything would have been unimaginably fine for fucking everyone. If only some Catholic harlot saint and her aberration boyfriend hadn't gotten involved.</br></br>  <br>She still could have been a magus like that either way.<br><br>Its just that the main kid gets the crest, and they're usually not going to waste much time training the other one, but they will still train the other one in the spare time.<br><br>Like with Aoko and her sister perhaps<br><br>Tokiomi wanted Sakura to be one with a crest, like it would be a waste any other way since she needed to be a magus head. This kind of potential can't be wasted by getting somewhat less training to him, but she's just kind of learning magic for her own reasons rather than due to some grand potential, because she wants to get gud at any sort of hobby she takes on. For her its like learning cooking or archery, its just another sort of skill she's decided to take upon a bit.<br><br>She didn't even end up with a crest in the Matou family, it died with Zouken.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's gotta be a limit unless you are god or some omnipotent being capable of bending the odds to your will. You can only believe in your ideals so much that they blind and drown you. Being overly idealistic can be a weakness too.</br>  <br>The grail is a clump of mana that isn't even capable of performing an actual miracle, and as a source of energy isn't even on the level of a single planet. <br><br>Beyond that, his idea of 'saving everyone' was literally destroying the concept of evil which is akin to stripping mankind of its freewill permanently to impose your own on it.<br><br>He sought to make slaves of us all because he thought he knew best, wouldn't have achieved jack fucking shit even if he'd won, and Jeanne did nothing wrong by stopping him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> capable of bending the odds to your will. <br>Funny thing about that, Marik here always has the odds in his favor. His Revelation skill means he's able to divine the course of action that comes with the highest chance of success in carrying out his agenda.

He wanted to save everyone, and he knew of a realistic way to do it. He thought people were assholes who didn't deserve saving, but he knew of a way to make it impossible for them to be assholes and was going to see it happen. He really doesn't have much faith in others.</br>  <br>He was winning the 3rd war before the Nazis ruined it and stole the Grail.</br>   people actually think the Grail can grant any wish <br>A beautiful lie.</br>  <br> She didn't even end up with a crest in the Matou family <br>On the other hand, she did end up with effectively inexhaustible mana and the ability to bind spirits to her will.

The original is nowhere in the equation, unlike Alter/blackened Servants</br>  <br>None really. The personality he shows is supposed to be 100% false, rather all of it being just a negativity Shirou himself possesses.</br>  <br>If it was truly wrong, he would have known as soon as he'd succeeded and all evil had been purged from his existence, and then he could have fixed it. Can't hurt to at least try his way out first.</br>  <br>He's pretty low tier by the standards of just about every Grailbowl that have been shown. He's not particularly versatile and he doesn't stand out for his strength, so he's way down the food chain.</br>  <br>You're assuming a lot of things go exactly as you'd want them to in order for him to be able to reverse it.</br>  <br>I just realized Gae Buidhe's unhealable wounds could have been really useful against Cthulhu yet he's the only one who didn't participate in that fight. Amazing. It's a been a while. but didn't Gae Dearg land a hit on his Book and nothing really happened? I guess he could still beat Caster by stabbing him.<br><br>He also loses hard to every Stay Night servant as well. Deermud a shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the opposite, he's quite weak but versatile. He can apparently shut down NPs with the red spear and fight guerrilla warfare style with the yellow one. Like all heroes, he just has bad matchups.</br>  <br> He also loses hard to every Stay Night servant as well. Deermud a shit. <br><br>He could possibly handle Medea and Archer at close range. I'd still say the odds weren't in his favour unless he gets the element of surprise though, and his sense of honour would probably mean he'd never take that option.<br><br>He'd also near definitely wreck Shirou!Saber considering she's a lot weaker than she is in Zero, soon as she's contracted to Rin/Sakura or gets Avalon she'd be able to handle him easily though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but didn't Gae Dearg land a hit on his Book and nothing really happened? <br>It temporarily cut off Gilles' connection to the tome, or temporarily disabled it. Can't remember which way it was. It was restored just a few moments later, though. He could probably destroy it completely if he got in a better hit or just kept shredding it into smaller pieces with his spear. He sucks, though.</br></br>  <br>I usually mix up Kariya and Kayneth since they're are both equally retarded.</br>  <br>He didn't know Kiritsugu was the cause you dummy.<br><br>Besides, Shirou had a new self after the fire.

Just no.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Why do people overrate Iskander this much</br>  <br>Maybe not including his giant army of Servants. Europe Cu would be =, while he stomps any Lancelot.<br>Emiya is much more situational than Diar.</br></br>  He just had a hard life, anon. But it's ok, his ideals are in good hands.  <br> He can apparently shut down NPs with the red spear <br>He shuts down mana flow, so he cut Lancelot's connection to the plane. It does nothing against Excalibur, except dispel the enchantment with which Saber conceals her blade.<br> and fight guerrilla warfare style with the yellow one. <br>That's pretty much the only way of fighting he's good for, and even then the spear's no good against armor or anyone who fights at range. And he's not even the best Lancer who can cause unhealable wounds; that would be Cu.<br><br>At best he can pull off a single tactic in one of two very similar ways, neither of which stands out as great and they might not even work half the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Saber gives Excalibur a rough 50/50 chance of overcoming it and says she would be overwhelmed otherwise. People underestimate a giant swarm of Servants by thinking they're on the level of Medea's boner soldiers.</br>  <br>Berserkalot is a bit faster than Cu.<br>Lancelot has A+ agility while under Rin Cu is only an A.</br></br>  <br>Don't you mean<br> The entire town's bitch and Cu's bitch <br>?</br></br></br>  <br>Agility has always seemed to be more dexterity than pure speed while still somehow accounting for speed.</br>  <br>when</br>  <br>Agility isn't speed you fucking retard.</br>  <br>How is that better? He's 5th Hassan without the kill move and his main ability jobs due to Conservation of Ninjutsu. Kojiro can actually fight off other Servants. The many Hassans might be really really good at killing Masters if used properly, but this is specifically Servant fights.</br>  <br>Diarmuid has great compatibility against Lancelot, and his spears go through armor. <br>Alex's greatest strength is his army. Diarmuid is an army-killer.<br>Diarmuid again, is an army killer against Hassan.<br>Everyone else is a bit harder to deal with and may require Diarmuid asking for a double-team with other Servants, mainly Saber.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Kojirou has A+ agility yet Cu is still called the fastest heroic spirit during F/SN</br>  <br>Pre-registering ends tomorrow, so they're "end of July" should be correct. Definitely within the week.</br>  <br>To be versatile means to be competent in several different things, or to be capable of several different things. He can fight with his two spears and that's more or less it.</br>  <br><br> Agility is the ability to be quick and graceful. </br></br>  <br>Fastest in burst. Fastest in long distances is Medusa.</br>  <br>Cm3 = Quickness and speed of reaction</br>  <br>yeah Medusa would win in long distance running.<br>too bad this doesn't matter in fights</br></br>  <br> his spears go through armor. <br>Gae Daerg goes through Saber's armor.

He's just strong. He shuts down anyone who cannot quickly kill him or those who cannot tank their way through it. The numbers of the former seem slim due to not even Excalibur being a certain thing, and the numbers of the latter are also likely incredibly small (Heracles and Karna being the foremost). Great survivors like Cu stand a good chance of making it out, but I'd put their ability of winning as pretty low.</br>    !<br>nuhuh</br>  <br>That is burst speed which Cu is faster at</br>  <br>This list assumes he even calls on IH in time to deploy it before they close in or wipe him out. While very short, it does have a cast time - and for Saber/EMIYA/Cu/Medusa that's all they need.<br><br>Lancelot and Herakles are really the only ones with no sizeable chance to kill him before he pops his RM. Even Gilgamesh can manage it, though I doubt he would ever not at least let him summon it before killing him.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna say that Lancelot will have a hard time with IH. As a guy specializing in 1v1 swordfights and no AoE attacks or crowd control, he's very much Anti-Unit, not Anti-Army. It wouldn't be long long before the Zerg rush will get to him and they dogpile the guy.</br>  <br>Sorry, I'm not intimately familiar with every single literary tradition in recorded history, and I would certainly get the exact number wrong if I were to make a guess.</br>  <br> Herakles becomes essentially unkillable after four or so deaths due to building resistance and their lack of NPs, likely can slaughter Iskander's ride also given his feats and then maul him given his stats <br>Heracles stands a very good chance of surviving, but prior knowledge of GH and strategy could pull out a win if Rider has enough resources available (Enough strong enough to hold him off and kill him and proper usage of his chariot). Without those, Heracles cannot lose, but cannot win unless he can get up close to Rider.<br> Arturia can Excaliblast twice or so thanks to Rin's reserves being absurd <br>It still takes time to launch another, which she won't have if it doesn't finish them off in the first place.<br> Cu is famous for slaughtering whole armies and is so fast he'd be in Iskander's face before IH is finished summoning, and pretty much cannot be struck by ranged attacks <br>Armies of pure mooks maybe. Regardless of what they were in life, these guys are Servants and are not going to be put down so easily.<br> Lancelot is of comparable speed and renown  <br>Lancelot gets owned in two minutes. Even if he can kill 100 soldiers in ten seconds, once he takes a single hit, they'll start piling up and overwhelm him.<br> Medusa either petrifies so much of the army IH collapses or jumps on her Pegasus and just mows through them till she reaches him in half a second/plays keep away until the mana sustaining it runs out <br>We don't know her range, but it is unlikely it can affect thousands upon thousands at once. It's also appearently taxing to use it on a great number of people.<br> EMIYA can pick him off from range even in IH, and deploying UBW in it would likely overwrite it much like it would the regular world <br>No, and we don't know how overlapping RMs might work.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit you're right, I forgot Arondight isn't a beamsword like nearly every other sword NP.<br><br>Iskander would probably beat him if he got IH summoned then, yeah.</br></br></br>  <br> Fighting at full speed the entire time in a prolonged fight=burst speed <br><br>Uh-huh.</br></br></br>  <br> Armies of pure mooks maybe. Regardless of what they were in life, these guys are Servants and are not going to be put down so easily. <br>I realy recommend reading the Tain.<br> No, and we don't know how overlapping RMs might work. <br>Yes we do.<br>The one deployed later wins because the other one gets crushed by two RMs at the same time<br><br>Also stop riding Iskander's dick</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>You don't seem to understand the difference between burst and average speed.</br></br>  <br> Armies of pure mooks maybe. <br><br>He actually slaughtered something like half the heroes in Ireland during his battle with Medb in the Ulster Cycle. I could easily see him at least reaching Iskander even in IH considering he seems to enjoy leading the charge against serious opponents.<br><br> We don't know her range, but it is unlikely it can affect thousands upon thousands at once. <br><br>In F/HA she takes down thousands of the Avenger clones from range and only gives up with that strat when she realizes there's literally millions of them.<br><br>Its also stated to affect anyone in her line of sight, IIRC<br><br> No, and we don't know how overlapping RMs might work. <br><br>We do actually. Alice deploys one in the RM the Mooncell establishes for the arena, and he could easily oneshot a servant with mediocre defense like Iskander from range.<br><br>I agree that Lancelot would likely get his shit shoved in though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If he was killing 5000 per day, they were mooks (at least in the Nasuverse).<br><br>And we don't. We have never seen any example outside of the gamplay of Extra and the bit in UBW2014 which may only be a case because it's the same RM.</br></br></br>  <br>The 5000 per day wasn't even a fight.<br>That was just Cu throwing rocks at them because they tried to avoid fighting him.<br>In the actual Ulster Cycle it's 200 per day if I remember correctly</br></br></br>  <br>Both Archer and Alice overwrite the Reality Marbles established by the Mooncell that the grail war takes place in. This even occurs out of fights as part of the story for Alice.<br><br>If Archer saves UBW for a last resort like he always does he WILL erase IH.</br></br></br>  <br>Those likely would have been limited battles unless Ireland had thousands of heroes.<br><br>She doesn't use her eyes or the pegasus because it would prove useless in the long run. We know there is some limit because even people ten feet away petrify slower than those up close. Who knows how it would work at a thousands feet or a mile.<br><br>The internal RMs of the Moon Cell cannot be taken into account because it is unlikely to be attempting to crush anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The 200 per day was when he used Runes to compel them to fight him 1v1IIRC<br><br>He was only dueling during that period, its unknown how many he'd kill if he'd decided to go for a straight melee against the army since he took that option to avoid having any of them slip by him to march onwards and attack where he was defending</br></br></br>  <br>In hollow, it mentions Medb contemplated between losing 5000 a day for significant advancement or one per day for measly advancement.</br>    <br>I know.<br>I was contemplating the real life Tain.<br><br>Runes are 1 person a day.<br>That's kind of the whole point on Medb's end</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Lancelot <br>It says in the Fate/Zero Materials that<br><br>Lancelot<br>Height: 191 cm <br>Weight: 81 kg<br>Blood type: Unknown <br>Birthday: Unknown<br>Image color: Dark blue<br>Talents: Martial Arts, Horseback Riding<br>Things he likes: Etiquette and tradition<br>Things he hates: Talking about his true intentions<br>Worst enemy: Iskander (Alexander)<br><br>Iskander isn't a good matchup for Lancelot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They weren't nobodies. At the very least they were of the same class as the bulk of Iskander's IH forces going by the standards of Irish legends - though only a handful at best would be comparable to Iskander and stronger servants.<br><br> We know there is some limit because even people ten feet away petrify slower than those up close. Who knows how it would work at a thousands feet or a mile. <br><br>You remember where that's said? As far as I recall it works equally well at any range, and in HA she's using it against huge numbers of opponents at varying ranges equally well.<br><br> The internal RMs of the Moon Cell cannot be taken into account because it is unlikely to be attempting to crush anything. <br><br>Are you actually arguing less than 100,000 men have a greater force of will to establish their RM than the Mooncell? Or are you just making a baseless assumption that for some reason its Reality Marbe operates differently than any other despite all evidence indicating they operate on the same principles?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn, really? I need to re-read his myths. <br><br>Haven't since secondary school and its starting to show.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still not sure how this pudgy Nipponese teenager turned into Marik Ishtar.</br>  <br>If Cu could kill 5000 per day and still survive, then they would have been. Saber never once thinks about trying to tank her way through them, and even without BC, would stand a similar chance of making it through with Instinct instead.<br><br>When she uses it on Archer, it's nearly instant. Rin and Shirou take slightly longer. While it is only a brief few seconds, it shows that it gets less effective with range. Certainly everything within 100 feet is fucked, but it's hard to say if it retains that effectiveness for 500 feet or 1000.<br><br>The Moon Cell is built to act like the regular world in a way, so it's going to be set up so Servants can use their abilities properly. It wants a fair fight as possible, so it isn't going to try to impede upon them by making their abilities unusable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean he sometimes kills more than 1 person per day but the general idea is 1 per day</br>  <br> If Cu could kill 5000 per day and still survive, then they would have been. <br>Faulty logic</br></br>    <br> If Cu could kill 5000 per day and still survive, then they would have been <br>Please learn how to argue.</br></br>  <br>That goes with the second part of the statement. If Cu could slaughter them, so could Saber. If they're of the same caliber, Saber would also be able to slaughter them. Saber shows no intention or ability to be able to slaughter them and believes they would overwhelm her, so Cu should similarly not be able to slaughter them.</br>  <br>Please point me to the legends where King Arthur slaughters entire armies</br>  <br>Cu has never been shown to have a type-advantage against armies. That would be silly if Cu could easily slaughter IH while Saber has no idea if she can win. The fact that Cu and Saber are around the same level of strength would mean Saber should be able to replicate a similar feat without much issue. The fact that she can't means Cu shouldn't be able to as well.</br>  <br> Cu has never been shown to have a type-advantage against armies. <br>Read the Ulster Cycle.<br>In F/SN he never went up against armies</br></br></br>  <br>this has got to be one of the most retarded things i've ever read</br>  <br>The universe<br> Prove me wrong </br></br>  <br>Armies are different from monsters. Kill enough monsters, you're good at killing monsters. Though they have differing strengths, the qualities that make a monster are still similar. The same cannot apply to armies whose body can be made up of entirely different qualities depending on the soldiers available. Him adapting to it and being able to kill a bunch of people he wouldn't be able to kill if they weren't considered an army makes little sense.</br>  <br><br>Where is this from?</br></br>  <br>She's a failure of an idoru.</br>  <br>The heavens feel vita opening.</br>  <br> Saves the most autistic possible kid denying fate from having a good MC. </br>  <br>I know she's a bully and a slut for blasphemous dragon dick, bringing shame to all of Christianity and to God, but I still love her.</br>  <br>It was either him or the plain Jane wallflower girl here.</br>  <br> blasphemous dragon dick <br>Siegfried is christian.<br>The Nibelungenlied is early medieval even though it's based on far older texts</br></br></br>  <br>Shut the fuck up, Bluebeard.</br>  <br>The homunculus Sieg is a soulless aberration born from witchcraft.

And then you had Angry Manjew fucking around to show the worst possible outcome of his wish.</br>  <br><br><br>Gram<br> A sword that appears in the “Völsunga Saga” of Norse mythology. It is wielded by the hero Sigurd. The incident where Sigurd’s father Sigmund pulled Gram from the trunk of a tree later became the model for Caliburn, the sword in the stone. After Sigurd reforged Gram from the shattered pieces, it is said to have become a demonic sword capable even of killing a dragon. <br>Balmung<br> A cursed holy blade which had accomplished the feat of dragon slaying. <br> It also possesses the attributes of its origin, the demonic blade Gram, and will change attributes between holy sword and demonic sword depending on who wields it. The blue jewel of the hilt stores and preserves magic energy (true Ether) from the age of gods, and upon releasing it, emanates a twilight aura. Those with the blood of dragons take additional damage.  <br><br>So we have a sword that's shattered and reforged into a dragon killing sword, and a dragon killing sword that came from Gram.<br>I'm talking about Type-Moon, not mythology.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not him, but <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram_<wbr>%28mythology%29<br> Gram was forged by Volund; Sigmund received it in the hall of the Völsung after pulling it out of the tree Barnstokkr where Odin placed it. The sword was destroyed in battle when Sigmund struck the spear of an enemy dressed in a black hooded cloak. Before he died, Sigmund instructed his wife to keep the pieces so that it might be reforged for their unborn son (Sigurd). The sword was eventually reforged by Regin for Sigurd's use. <br> In the Nibelungenlied (ca. 13th century), Siegfried says that the name of this sword is Balmung </br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>But that anon was saying that Gram was also named Balmung in the Volsung saga<br><br>Dude Sigurd and Siegfried are different figures in the Nasuverse.<br>It fucking talks about both in the same article as different people</br></br></br></br>  <br>That isn't in-universe context, dude.

The reason Rin is able to fight on equal footing is because Sakura can only use so much of the Grails infinite mana at a time, the same capacity as Rin, and Rin can tap into a more finite source of mana, the mana in the air of the room, an infinite amount of times because of the Jewel Sword.</br></br>  <br>So who is &gt; Sigurd according to you?</br>  <br><br>Different guy, but I'd consider Beowulf to be the better known Scandinavian hero, if only because his story became popular in england.</br></br>  <br>Sigfried is german, Sigurd is norse.</br>  <br>But Sigurd was said to be the greatest northern hero.<br> Also his father was the King of Frankland which is also germanic </br></br>  <br> And its established each can handle ten units of magical energy each before being damaged <br><br>Its later established that even though they can't handle the most mundane amount of energy for anything normal, they literally cannot do any other magic and will go retarded if he tries, but they will not break when it comes to casting swords.<br><br>Suddenly they will become a thousand times more efficient than ever before, but only when he realizes the one thing they can actually do.<br><br>When he's trying to use them for strengthening or projection on their own before he starts to realize how this works he can't get the energy across, especially when it comes to strengthening. However at a certain key scene he realizes how his circuits work, and in that moment all twenty seven of them light up at full power and accomplish things that would logically be far beyond them no matter how many he has. He notes there that he realized how his circuits work, and they will not break doing this one thing, compared to anything he's done before they can be used far far better in this one thing.<br><br>Ten units of prana is most likely when he was doing strengthening training with Tohsaka and couldn't understand how his circuits work as the mana couldn't flow with that thing.<br><br>When trying to do mundane things with magic he can never do it, but when it comes to casting swords or worlds of swords, his circuits will suddenly because more productive than anything before, the energy will flow more correctly and his other circuits might get in on this.

Every fanart I've seen of her Strange fake self is her being pissed off towards Richard who seems really energetic or something.</br>  <br>She's an antisocial delinquent who's haunted by visions of a dead girl.

He's able to make some real Italian or something, and Shirou can't do that much.<br><br>Shirou can mainly just do Japanese meals, a bit of Western, and that's mainly it.

Even if it means cold bloodedly killing magicians without the honor of using magic to do so, he seldom uses magic, because he can see something others cannot see. That weapons are just enough to kill most magicians if used right. <br>Although his death is stupid and weak at the same time, i think he's one of the characters that will keep the series interesting.<br>Now it's just muh magic battles with Fate series. <br>But he's dead, nothing can be done about it.</br></br></br>  <br>Julius was probably a far more effective killer than him in some ways.<br><br>It was his own servant that sort of ruined things for him, when the master kept killing dozens of people behind the scenes.<br><br>Not to mention one of the main guys in Fate/Strange being a far more competent version of Kiritsugu.<br><br>If you think its just magic battles and everything is dead, you're really not reading the different series at all and are just complaining about shit.<br><br>There was another master in Apocrypha who had about the same methods as Kerry but his style is very different.<br><br>There's one in almost every series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Astolfo's sex appeal is just that foolproof.</br>  <br>There's not even really magic battles to begin with.<br><br>I'm not sure if to date there's been one legit magic battle where people were just throwing spells at each other.<br><br>All the mages are the abnormal types in a grail war, or the "I can't do anything, except this thing" type.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The battles are a sideshow. They don't even matter. The other characters are way more interesting.</br>  <br>Rei and Caster could be one, but i guess she got rekt</br>  <br>why</br>  <br> the fight between Sakura and Rin at the end of the Heaven's Feel for him was the best thing that could happen to Tosaka. <br><br>Rin manages to kill Sakura there. That means she'll never forgive herself.<br><br>Sakura actually does manage to make herself believe she killed her sister and goes off the deep end enough to attempt suicide right there.<br><br>How the fuck is this good for his daughters?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Einzberns are completely rational.<br> take their art and strategy to their logical conclusions <br> fail  <br> realize they're out of options instead of going insane and retrying the same shit <br> hire mercenary instead <br> fail <br> final contingency plan is hybridization to shake things up <br> fails <br> give up on grail </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;give up on grail <br><br> Really seek a grail in America when you lose the one in Japan, fuck that up as well. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget these geniuses thought it was a good fucking idea to summon something akin to Satan. Honestly the smartest thing they ever did was summon Hercules and they still fucked it up by giving him the Berserker class because they all got scared he'd kill them super dead Because of how they treated IIya. So rather than have a good servant and maybe treat their representative better they chose the option that cost them to lose. Berseker dies easily in every route. God I hope at least in the UBW's timeframe they got wiped out.</br></br>  <br> It's a fucking omni potent wish granting device <br>Even Gil knew it was bullshit; the Grail doesnt grant wishes.</br></br>  <br>Gilgamesh is one of the people that confirms the grail can grant wishes, and it can be used to grant wishes.<br><br>It just turns out that this isn't its true or intended purpose, but it can do it.<br><br>Its more like "This much raw mana could basically do anything if given direction", but that can be used to create a wish.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Angya Manyu is quite literally a wish by humanity, even if no one actively asked for it. That's his entire nature.<br><br> Q: I thought that the Lesser Grail collected "All of the World’s Evil (Angra Mainyu)"when it was defeated during the Third Holy Grail War, but then how was the Greater Grail corrupted by "All of the World’s Evil (Angra Mainyu)"? Is it because energy flows from the Lesser Grail to the Greater Grail when the two are linked? <br> A: It’s because Avenger himself is "a Heroic Spirit born into existence according to people’s wishes". Other Heroic Spirits are recognized as true heroes, but Avenger represents the belief that "heroes" are lies and fabrications. The enshrinement of humanity’s selfish desires turned Avenger into a Heroic Spirit, creating a direct connection to the wish-granting function of the Holy Grail. The Greater Grail, "activated 3 times without granting anyone's wishes", turned into its present state as there was still a chance to grant somebody’s wish. <br> As a result, Avenger was born into this world in order to grant everybody’s desire for an existence like "All of the World's Evil (Angra Mainyu)". <br><br>Its not by his nature that he did the things he did, it was by humanity that he was born and wished for.<br><br>That is technically a wish granted</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Provided your wish isn't complicated.</br>  <br>It can be complicated, but you have to understand all the ins and outs of the process yourself<br><br>Just look at Apocrypha</br></br></br>  <br>Hiring Kerry and Summoning Berserker were actually both decently solid plans on paper.<br><br>Kerry was absolutely renowned for being absolutely ruthless and highly effective against proper magi, which is essentially what the HGW was a contest between. Kerry himself wanted the Grail at all costs so they had a mutual interest in obtaining it and on top of that they have an artifact that could someone supposedly one of the strongest servants available - King Arthur. Kerry pretty much did win too, it's just that he didn't expect the Grail to betray everything he lived for right at the very end.<br><br>Berserker on the other hand, despite dying in every route fairly easily really is bullshit overpowered. I guess you can say the same for almost every 5th War servant though, so eh. Still, on paper they had a very well renowned hero as well, absolute loyalty through the berserker class and a master with enough mana to actually take take advantage of the class without burning up instantly. It was a pretty good bet to win the war with the previous wars in mind, but there's simply too much other bullshit going on in the 5th war.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And that's why we have gilgamesh.</br>  <br>Now what if... we gave Lancelot to Kiritsugu instead of Arturia.</br>  <br>He'll get rekt, berserkers needs alot of mana man. Kerry is a sub par magician.</br>  <br>Summon Lancelot as a Saber then. ANd keep Irysviel as a mana source. Kerry being able to get that nigga whatever weapon he wants would be broke as fuck.</br>  <br>He'll probably just rob a museum and give him some priceless weaponry</br>  <br> Is also Bizarre that Shirou never thinks about it <br><br>Because FSN VN frames Kirei and Gilgamesh when those were Kiritsugu and Saber.</br></br></br>  <br>Kek, and then we come to the conclusion Kirei did nothing wrong</br>  Yeah I have no interest in continuing this series.<br><br>Finished f/z today, and its just all retarded, that grail war did nothing but kill characters after you grew attached, and still the outcome was fucking pointless. there will be another grail war? thats fucking stupid.</br></br>  <br> being attached to characters  <br>Biggest kek</br></br>  <br>eyes watered at the part with waver and alexander. Much better death than alexanders real life death, bastard got sick, wasnt even finished conquering yet.</br>  <br>Honestly, if they needed him dead they should have just given him fucking cancer.<br>Would have worked with all those cigarettes.</br></br>  <br>He basically had grail cancer.</br>  <br>Kerry summoned the wrong Arthur though.</br>  <br>That's like the worst cancer right?</br>  <br><br>If there is anything that you should have learned by the posts in this thread, it's that he is warped as a father.<br><br>After all, even in the comedic alternate future he has, he turns his youngest daughter into a giant robot and basically goes Gendo and tells his oldest to just "get in the robot" and defeat his enemies, regardless of their wishes.<br><br>Not exactly the type of dad who listens to his daughters.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not entirely. Sakura tries to save his ego by saying she still has much to learn from him, but he admits she is flat better at Japanese now, was always better at Western, is the only one of them that bakes sweets, and is trying to learn Chinese from Rin.<br><br>Rin herself admits Sakura has the aesthetics of cooking down better than herself because Sakura makes attentive choices that suit the person she prepares food for. She has the skill and the love down.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know what's really bizarre?  JoJo's Adventure. </br>  <br>This is a dumb argument.<br>Overall in his lifetime he has saved at least tens of thousands of people.<br>Even if his actions led to thousands of deaths he still saved more people than he's killed.<br>He is therefore a good person.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Nah, they don't have the catalyst for that. Besides, some of Lancelot's shit were stories from other knights.</br>  Who is your  second  favorite seiyuu?

I don't know why and I don't know how but only when reading Berserk this fear comes to me.<br><br> tfw Iwata, Robin Williams and Christopher Lee died before reading the new chapter of Berserk <br> tfw I may die before finishing Berserk <br> tfw I may not finish Berserk and HxH in my lifetime <br><br>Maybe my children will finish them but I'm afraid that I'd die and wonder how will it end?<br><br>;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The way I see it it's going to go 2 ways.<br><br><br>1. Griffith/The other God Hands sacrifice Falconia<br><br>2. Guts becomes the bad guy by fighting Griffith and thus not allowing the people to have their "paradise"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm still in disbelief at the fact that a chapter came out.  <br><br><br>/a/ never change</br></br></br>  <br>But the question is, will you forgive the magaka for dragging out a series for so long?</br>  <br>Casca a shit</br>  <br>Shut the fuck up you stupid namefag</br>  <br><br>Hell I can forgive Miura for "dragging" out Berserk since the art is nice and the story is rich. And you have the author of Hajime no Ippo after 1000+ chapter Ippo is still a punching bag that uses his head literally to block punches and be the champion. Ippo should just die already and have the manga focus on Sendoh instead</br></br>  <br>I just saw the source yesterday. I'm still mad.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Jesus the Berserk threads have been awful lately.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd be more worried about Miura dying before he finishes Berserk. That way not even your children will get to read it. No one will.</br>  <br> Your coffee is shit <br> You drink this shit? </br></br>    <br> 2015 <br> Not liking coffee </br></br>  <br>It's been shit ever since it attracted faggots like a certain tripfag.</br>  <br>yeah fuck that guy</br>  <br> he actually talked to that retarded butthurt hypocritical newcomer <br>You're dumb.</br></br>  <br>The butthurt moron who likes Mihawk is the funniest</br>  <br>There are theories that this guy and the Skull Knight are the one and the same.<br><br>Is the Skull Knight the kind of a person who would murder an innocent?</br></br></br>  <br>SK is Gaiseric</br>  <br><br> Is the Skull Knight the kind of a person who would murder an innocent? <br><br>He literally wouldn't give two shits about murdering an innocent to achieve his goal.</br></br></br></br>  <br> There are theories that this guy and the Skull Knight are the one and the same. <br>lol what</br></br>  http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/the-i<wbr>dolmster-r607<br><br>Which one of you did this?</br></br></wbr>  <br> KidCongo </br>  Wow I hate this whore's reasoning<br><br>"dont be mad cause griffith killed anyone who you cared for and pretty much planned to kill you too, stay in the capital! lol!!"<br><br>I swear to god if he/that little girl stay I'll kill myself</br></br></br></br>  <br>He went out of his way to save best girl in the conviction arc and he decided to save guts and casca during the eclipse instead of taking void's hed.d</br>  <br><br>That's getting your priorities straight, not "forgiving"</br></br>  <br>What? I think you meant to reply to someone else.</br>  <br> dont be mad cause griffith killed anyone who you cared for and pretty much planned to kill you too <br>Except she has no idea of what you just said. At all. What she knows is Rickert has a responsibility to take care of the girl and it's safest to keep her in the city.</br></br>  <br>Rickert choosing to stay in the city would be like Guts choosing to prioritize healing Casca over revenge on Griffith. Priorities.</br>  <br>She doesnt know what happened and even if she did, shes still right. Rickert cant go live outside of falconia where demons and monsters are fucking running around everywhere.</br>  Why have berserk threads been so shit lately?  <br>;__;</br>  <br>Nothing left to talk about. This is the fate of every franchise with substance and a substantial number of threads.</br>  <br> he actually spoonfed that retarded butthurt hypocritical newcomer <br>You're dumb.</br></br>   M-Miura didn't really kill her, right? Guts will meet her again in Elf Helm, r-right? ;_;   <br>"Lately" can extend further back than one week, you know.</br>  So last thread I was wondering is Griffith replaced a God Hand (which implies that the one before got murdered).<br>The only response I got was that he was the first to occupy the spot, but re-reading the manga I stumbled upon this (image attached). <br>It seems that when the Skull Knight got branded there were already 5 "Angels" or God Hand. <br>What do you think ?</br></br></br>  <br>Judeau gets corrected though. It seems they aren't sure if it was 4 or 5.</br>  <br>I think they were four at that time. But the Hand of God were "fated" to be five, so the story is told like that.</br>  <br>'There are theories" about anything you want. To answer your question, no, Skull Knight is Gaiseric and has an absolute vendetta against the God Hand (particularly Void) and by extension the apostles.</br>  <br><br>First, it's an old tale.<br><br>Second, it's said somewhere that once a God Hand is born, its existence exists retroactively. Like, once a new God Hand is born it's like it always existed.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's also possible they recycle every 1000 or so years (216 years between each red behilt).<br><br>The fifth god hand is said to warp or drastically change the world, if my memory serves correctly, and Void becoming the fifth god hand and destroying Gaiseric's continent spanning empire would do just that. <br><br>The four or five remark is, in my opinion, meaning that there were four before the destruction and five after, meaning that was the ascension of the fifth god hand.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I still think Guts will somehow end up forgiving Griffith for what he's done <br><br>2015 and idiots from /a/ just started to realize that Griffith is going to die as Jesus saving Earth from God's hand.</br></br></br>  <br>Or he sacrifices the entire city to bring forth a new era<br>It's Bloodborne all over again</br></br>  Griffith did nothing wrong.  <br> newcomer <br><br>Lately goes a little further back.

(It was also covered by Imai and Chiaking in the old im@s radio, but nobody remembers that anymore.) <br><br>Point is, It's not an im@s song. Why would they put it in the anime?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why would they put more Kaede in the anime? <br>A question requiring no answer.</br></br>    Why is the 2011 anime so much better than CG? Excluding any Kaede screentime, of course.  anyone has the theory image of usamin's old age and her song explanation of her depression?  <br>I agree. The first one was so much more enjoyable to watch. CG is only worth watching because of pic-related.</br>  <br><br>Because it lacks more Kaede and Ranko. It really should just have those two on screen at all times.</br></br>  I want to rock her world, all night.  <br><br>She'll get her time soon, with plenty of Natsuki and jelly Miku.</br></br>    <br>Aiko's so sweet, too bad she's so underrated.</br>  <br>I would like to get to know her cute friend better.</br>  <br><br><br> Riina's panty status: moist </br></br></br>  <br><br>Riina wasn't the only one with wet panties during that scene.</br></br>  <br>Not in my heart.</br>  <br>The highs were higher, but the lows have definitely been way lower than anything in CG so far. The whole evil Kuroi shenanigans was also a lot more stupid compared to Mishiro, but there's still chances for her to do some cartoonishly evil stuff as well.<br><br>Also, TakeP is just way better than AkaP.</br></br></br>  That Kaede episode is what I've been waiting for since CG started. It was alright. I think they could've used Koi Kaze better, that song had the potential to be Yakusoku or Nemuri Hime tier from im@s2011.  <br>You sir have a great taste.</br>  <br>Because there is too much focus on Rin and NG. Its ok if its Uzuki. But you are right, only thing enjoyable are Kaede's scene.</br>  <br>Simple yet sympathetic development with small office starting up using lively girls, everyone getting some impactful scenes not just 5 favorites, danketsu, no sterile plastic agency, lolis that actually did something.</br>  <br>Well Kaede is a support cast so it isnt surprising but it still have its own impact in the story. Its my favorite episode so far. As they delivered Kaede with much more develop than the freakin whole CG cast.</br>  <br> As they delivered Kaede with much more develop than the freakin whole CG cast. <br>Tell me about it...</br></br>  After the "interrogation".  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br><br> <br><br>Aiko is in my top 5 as well. If Scamco had any sense, they'd put her and Uzuki in a healing unit.<br><br>She's the Regen to Uzuki's Cure 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Anya was born in the 25th of December she'd be a Christmas miracle.  <br>I want to get smashed with Anya and Minami while Ranko is drinking tomato juice.</br>  <br>And if Kaede was born on the 25th of December she'd be a Christmas cake.<br> &gt;tfw all my Kaede pictures just got up and disappeared </br></br>  <br><br><br> Had the potential to be Yakusoku or Nemurihime <br><br>Okay, the Kaede overreaction nonsense in these threads really needs to get toned down a bit.<br><br>Kaede is not the main character. The main characters are NG (and TakeP), supported by the rest of the Cinderella Project and a few other characters. The main focus of the show we see is on the growth of those involved in the Project. How they start as a ragtag bunch of strangers held together only by way of being chosen for the same initiative, and how they develop into a strong, cohesive group. A Cinderella story.<br><br>Kaede has already had her Cinderella story, so to speak. She started at the bottom, and worked her way up until she reached the top. So in a show that wants to tell the tale of a Cinderella girl from start to finish, why should they devote such a cathartic moment, as Yakusoku was, to someone who has already had their development offscreen?<br><br>I'll admit, I like Kaede. One of my favorite CGs, even. She's a fun, cool character and I love Hayami's voice, but this nonstop Kaedeposting in every CG thread is becoming tiresome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Minami probably doesn't drink but can you drink the Vodka fairy under the table?</br>  <br> So in a show that wants to tell the tale of a Cinderella girl from start to finish, why should they devote such a cathartic moment, as Yakusoku was, to someone who has already had their development offscreen? <br>Maybe because that's what A-1 likes, and they're obviously playing favorites?<br>I mean Mirio, Rika or Kanako will never get anything as big as Kaede had this episode. They won't ever have any emotional scenes, or glorified on stage or any shit. They won't have a "cinderella story" happening to them.</br></br></br>  <br>Hell no, I bet Anya could the hags a run for their money with her drinking.</br>  <br>I get that she's not the main character and I didn't mean Yakusoku-tier story-wise. I just meant that Koi Kaze as a song has a lot of potential to be a great insert in my opinion and they could've implemented it better, rather than cutting to dialogue after the first few lines.</br>  <br> Uzuki is the only one frowning <br><br>RIP gambarimasu.</br></br></br>  <br>kaedefags are just celebrating A-1 finally deliver Kaede, it will be back to usual thread next week or change focus to Nana if next week is Nana episode</br>  <br> usual thread <br>Kaede threads were a thing from the start.</br></br>  This woman is your friend. She fights for profits.  <br>Thats sad bro. Good thing I got one on my Phone then Laptop then Desktop.</br>  <br><br>Because the current show's focus is far too widespread among different idols.<br><br>They should just make Rin be the main character. <br><br>That would have made for a much better show. <br><br>Better than wasting time on Giantess Autist, Hipster Rock Autist, Goth Chuuni Autist, Illegal Immigrant Ruskie, lolis and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  Are ML girls allowed?  <br>There are some lewd Rins in that pic.</br>  <br> lolis <br>They didn't waste 5 minutes with them altogether, not even with Dekoration episode.</br></br>  <br> goth chuuni autist <br> illegal immigrant ruskie <br>sasuga rinfag <br> athough I have to agree that the giantess and hipster are fucking terrible </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Honda Mio must be removed.</br>  I can't get enough of Tsuki no Hotori de.<br>Azusa has an angel's voice.</br>  <br><br> Hating on Kirari <br><br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's hard to like her when SHE TALKS like THIS all the MOTHER fucking TIME and it's so ear GRATING.<br><br>Plus that fucking ":3" face all the time makes me want to punch her face in..</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because of our difference in tolerance but I love Kirari's speech, it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy whenever she talks.</br>  Which idols would you swap?  <br>Kirari, Anzu, Sachiko, Syoko, Koume, Anya, Minami, Ranko, Miria, Rika, Mika, Akane, Kaede and KWSM</br>  <br>No matter what, the lolis would still stay irrelevant, so whatever.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy happy whenever she talks. </br>  <br>To each his own nigga, she's not even my favorite but she can still put a smile on my face.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy happy whenever she talks. </br>  http://strawpoll.me/5034239<br><br>The poll is still up.

It's nearly impossible for me not to smile whenever I see and/or hear her.</br></br></br>  <br>This with pretty much all the idols with some kind of unique speech, it feels refreshing to hear when everyone speaks plainly.</br>    Would Chihaya and Kaede be a good unit? Or would they kill their fans with their no stop puns?  <br>Azusa and Kaede would be better, Chihaya and Kaede stand on 2 different ends of the spectrum it feels weird putting them together.</br>  24 starring Idols when?<br><br>End boss is Chihaya. <br><br> Chihaya wins </br></br></br></br>  <br>You underestimate Anya's capabilities.</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  <br><br>Cinderella Girls Xenoglossia when?</br></br>  <br>Kaede feels like a fusion of Azusa and Takane, two people that Chihaya seem to have a good affinity with (as long as breasts are not concerned).</br>  <br>Well at least with Kaede she doesn't have to worry too much, she has pretty modest breasts looking at it.<br> And I feel the same way but with Anya being a combination of Takane and Makoto </br></br>  <br>Well I think there good too. But Kaede doesnt get drunk on stage and mostly act quiet and mature when not intoxicated. So I think the normal Kaede and Chihaya would be good both are good singers too.</br>  <br> TakanexMakoto=Anya? <br><br>I dont see it.<br><br><br><br>Clearly see this; Takane's mysterious persona and Azusa's ara ara attitude is clearly Kaede's trait. Still if Azusa and Kaede drinks I doubt she can handle the top cake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could see TakeP being a killer.</br>  <br>Light hair, astrology nut, rather refined elegance and naivete from Takane with the short-mid length hair and some boyish charms from Makoto, probably thinking too deeply into it, it's not really right to find 765Pro parallels in CG.</br>  New Love Laika when?  <br>The only thing parallel with CG and 765 are Haruka X Uzuki with the "muh gambarimasu".</br>   You will never get molested by Kaede. <br><br>Fuck my suffering.</br></br>  <br>That's silly, the new Love Laika is a trio</br>  When's the PV?<br><br>Also, is Nana the only one who works in the cafe?<br><br> Why are these two paired together in some pics? Is it because of cock rings, pegging, and mouth gags? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be unfair to the other groups. No one else would be able to compete.</br>  <br> Anzu, Miria and Rika <br>One can drea.</br></br>  I've neither played nor watched any part of the IP. Should I start with the first series or jump straight into CG? What about that mecha spinoff? Do the shows have high production value when it cones to musical performances?  Best unit comming thru.<br><br><br>Hahaha keep dreamin.</br></br></br>  <br>Either. Preferably the 2011 anime first. The mecha is not related in anyway but name.<br><br>Don't expect LL!

The mecha spinoff is silly, but it's not really horrible. Keep in mind it's really not Im@s.</br></br>  <br>And we make some small ajustments and we've for CG's vocal powerhouse and a bankrupt Cygames all in 1 turn.</br>  <br>Mecha spinoff is related to the series only in name. Personalities drastically differ and voice actors too. The only thing in common is the base designs and names of the characters. Otherwise, it's your standard sunrise mecha show.<br><br>Aside from a shared setting, there isn't really any connection between the two. (Although CG chronologically takes place after the 2011 series). The approach and story framing of 2011 and CG drastically differ from each other so each is a completely different experience and it doesn't matter which you start on. But for Chronology's sake, go start on 2011 first.<br><br>In my opinion, both series are well animated where it counts (i.e. the performances) but fuck should I know what your standards are for these things, so it's best you watch it for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we've for <br>we've got</br></br>  <br>I love Rin and Uzuki</br>  <br>the fake CMs were easily the best part of the idolmaster anime, i'd love to see them do one with kaede as protag</br>  <br>I agree here. You should only get into the anime if you already like it.<br><br>Get the english translated PSP games which run on ppsspp perfectly (I think). Reccomended to get morning(?) sun first as it has all three girls translated, Moon next as Chihaya is adorable,a nd Wandering Star last as doing either Yukiho or Iori's route will spoil you thanks to Takane.<br><br>Check out doujins, the memes/lore, some of the manga.<br><br>If you still want more, some routes are translated, check out Yukipo.<br><br>tldr<br>PSP games&gt;Music&gt;Translated Stuff&gt;Doujins/Lore&gt;Anime&gt;Puchimas<br><br>CG and ML are pretty much just check the translated stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should I start with the first series or jump straight into CG? <br><br>Either is fine. Do note that the respective anime adaptations are only the barebones experience of their source material. They are plenty enjoyable as they are, but plenty of in-jokes or references will fly over your head if you have zero knowledge about the franchise. Furthermore, both series are guilty of shafting some of the characters to the side. So if you like a particular character, you might want to dabble in further im@s media to see them have further depth. Both adaptations only really managed to flesh out select characters.<br><br> What about that mecha spinoff? <br>Greatest Love Story between a Girl and her Giant Mecha ever told.<br><br>If you watch Sunrise Mecha shows not named Gundam, you know what to expect.

Noel a cute.</br>  <br>Good timing, The Noel nendo should be shipping out on the 28th</br>  <br>NOEL BEST LOLI</br>  Miracle of the Universe  Nice.  <br>Astronomy Reina is cute.</br>  Holy shit this show, why were they mad at MC again? Because she called the alien? Ayy lmao.  When exactly is this suppose to be set? Everyone's friends and Noel is around, but Kaiju-san's arm is uncracked again.  Didn't even know that there would be one.  <br>The ending of the show is a kinda alternative universe where enban and Noel didn't exist so Kaiju-san wasn't broken. It's probably set after the ending.</br>  <br>It cracked again when everyone was starting to remember Noel.</br>  Remove the saucer.  Even though SnM is pretty bad I miss Noel so the OVA is good news.  REMOVE SAUCER<br>REMOVE SAUCER</br>  Well that was cute.<br><br> Poor Souta, he just wants to get his dick wet. </br></br>  <br>I haven't finished this<br><br>should I?</br></br></br>  <br>Decide for yourself.</br>  <br>Seeing how this show is pretty much the typical eroge scenario but with a gender bent MC, Souta would be that MC's cool bro friend that never gets any.</br>  <br>People were definitely comparing it to Kanon when it was airing.<br><br>At least Nonoka chose best girl's route.</br></br></br>  Still downloading the episode, just wanna say that yuzuki a cute.  Cute shit.  <br>Damn, my torrent doesn't work<br>Guest I wait mcanime</br></br>  Noel a cute    <br>Gao~</br>    <br><br>Why is she so cute?</br></br>  <br>It's a mystery</br>  IMMORTAN!<br>IMMORTAN JOE!</br>  Fuck, didn't know this was getting an OVA downloading now. Her nendoroid should be released in a few days too.   "I've been thinking lately, could I perhaps be hated? The only one who understands my feelings is..." (sees the Kirigon poster gone) "So even you've abandoned me." <br> And sure enough, he doesn't appear for the rest of the OVA <br><br>Poor guy. I wonder if he was sort of breaking the fourth wall there.</br></br></br>  Oh god this was to cute, though I was surprised when the ED started playing after 11 minutes ;_;  <br>Now I'm sad.</br>  Why is Kirigon so cute?  <br>Holy shit, now I feel bad.<br>From the thumbnail I thought somebody had edited a feel face into the Dragon's mouth.</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=fAK<wbr>prNbyLaI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Dat Yuzuki's ass, dayum.</br>  Why aren't 3hz doing more shows?  <br>They would have made lots of money with some comedy 4koma</br>  Not enough Shuichi  <br>This guy fucks Nonoka every day.</br>  I forgot how good the music was. I was jammin to the old school rock tune on acoustic guitar on the way to the island  https://d.maxfile.ro/pujbthtztl.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br><br>I just noticed how good the soundtrack was especially the one that sounds like it's played on a banjo.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm actually ordering the OST now, it's a 2 disc set. I'm stoked.</br></br>  Stitch anyone?  So, apparently aliens can't reproduce (found on Amazon)  Noel is a miracle of the universe. I totally want to adopt her. Though I'm not sure having a loli that doesn't age would be good for the heart.  <br><br>Somehow this one feels more lewd, I don't know who would want it though. I really can't think of her in that way.</br></br>  <br>I would.<br>I want to impregnate Noel.</br></br>  Very cute. I wish this show had been more light-hearted.  <br>Nonoka and Shione are happy with her.</br>   Still in stock on AmiAmi <br><br>Not surprising I guess given how nobody kept watching the show, myself included, I picked it up again after I dropped it 3 episode in so I could buy her nendo without feeling guilty. Her nendo is so adorable though, especially the Kirigon.</br></br>  <br>They're doing Dimension W next year, I guess<br><br>I looks good, honestly<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xH5<wbr>sYIkWV_U</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>This. SOL and drama/suspense don't really mix</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  She has so many great accessories, I can't wait to get her.  <br> tfw slowly turning into a buyfag </br>  <br>I want to  pat her head  while gazing at her  enban </br>  <br> Dimension W <br>Sci-fi? Looking good. Is MC's voice Shizuo from drrr?</br></br>  <br><br>Eh I'm not too bad, I have 14 nendos will be 18 by sometime next year, though, I can't stop buying ones I like now, but I have some self restraint, I have to have seen the show of whatever I'm buying.</br></br>  <br>But she doesn't like when people stare at her naked.</br>  <br> Dimension W <br><br>Holy fuck I have 7 tomes at home, it's pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Only 2 more days friends!</br></br></br>  Noel is super cute.  <br>Where there any fanbooks for that? There was a little bit on Pixiv but I've only seen three fanzines two with Noel and one with the five girls and Souta.</br>  <br>Maybe there will be some on the C88 in a few weeks, but don't hold your breath. This wasn't a very popular show, so it won't have many doujins.</br>  <br>That's pretty damn cute.</br>  <br><br> ED by Fhána</br></br>  <br>Listening through the OST, there are actually several ones with a banjo in it. Pretty nice.</br>  <br>Yes, it's OnoD</br>  I haven't watched it yet.    That was nice.<br>I forgot about how good the OP/ED were.</br>   INSPIRATION <br> YOROKOBI TOKA </br>    <br>I fucking knew it. Illuminati son of a bitch.</br>    Cute.  <br>It's official, and a perfect dakimakura.<br>Noel is lovely, sure, but gentle love making is always sweet with a loli.</br></br>  <br>ultraman?</br>    <br>no<br/></br>  I feel like I was asleep while watching this show. What exactly was the plot?  Nonoka moves away without telling anyone so everyone got pissed at her. Magic space loli comes in and resets time and now her friends aren't as mad at her as before?   <br>Nonoka wins the Shione and they adopt Noel, that's it.</br>  Figures the ONE time I would have welcomed fanservice with open arms, it doesn't happen.  <br>Who would be giving the service? As long as Noel isn't involved, I wouldn't mind but it's definitely not what I would have expected.</br>  <br>Anyone and everyone. Wasn't SnM void of beach bullshit? It's been a while since I finished the series.</br>  <br> As long as Noel is not involved <br>Are you gay?</br></br>  <br>Noel is criminally sexy.</br>  <br>It was, despite the girls being super delicious sex godesses.</br>  <br>Now that's more the spirit I want to see.</br>    <br>Noel should be in GF beta.</br>  <br>GF Beta has mostly tall girls though, aside from a few minor girls.</br>  <br>Exactly. They need more diversity.</br>  <br>I agree with that. I couldn't even finish that series because of this.</br>  <br>I miss that show.</br>   Saucer is there <br>Wait, what?</br>  <br>Well Noel is there, so...</br>  <br><br>It's post-ending of course.</br></br>  <br>But Noel showed up without the saucer in the ending.</br>   No, wait a second, I take that back. I think the saucer disappeared at the final episode, didn't it? Though Noel still came back.  <br>I thought it was some weird pseudo-post-ending where Noel didn't disappear and just kept hanging out with everyone. Shione even still has this </br>  <br>Is Hokkaido warm enough to swim outdoors?</br>  <br>B-but that would make you imaginary.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>In truth, Noel is  the flying saucer. </br></br></br></br></br>    The cutest.  <br>Sexier than Hestia.</br>  <br><br>That kinda rhymes, doesn't it</br></br>  <br>Slant rhyme</br>  <br><br> NNGAAAAAA! <br><br> NGAAAAAA <br><br> NNGAAAAAAA! <br><br> NGAAAAAA <br><br>I can't stop watching it. Someone send help.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> INITIALIZE <br> SONO TOBIRA WO </br></br></br>    <br>Noel is nice, but Yuzuki is also pretty cute and lewd. Other girls have nice designs too, but for some reason they aren't as appealing. I feel like it would be more popular if they manage to make the rest of the characters more likable in various ways, especially Nonoka.</br>  <br>I thought Nonoka was good after that terrible first arc. But that first arc was really, really bad and marred it from being better-remembered.</br>          What was going on here?  <br>Nonoka comforting Noel because Yuzuki was indirectly rude to her.</br>  <br>I don't know, she felt a little bland to me. She isn't as cute as Noel or Yuzuki, she has some subtle fanservice shots, but they aren't as good as other girls for me, so I can't really fap to her either. She spends most of her time running around trying to fix shit. It's okay in an eroge, since you can self-insert and wait for the pay off with the girl you chose, but didn't work as well in anime, I think.</br>  <br>Yuzuki being saucy about the saucer.</br>  <br>Yeah, I can see what you mean. Personally, I thought she was pretty cute, but Noel was the main attraction so I didn't really mind her being more of a self-insert character.</br>  <br>Saucer is naked Noel.</br>  <br>This. I personally love those "very pink" main girls like Nonoka. She also was the second cutest probably tied with Yuzuki, and had amazing subtle service shots like you mentioned.</br>  <br>Nonoka's main appeal is her unhealthy relationship with her father.</br>  <br>I think Noel mentioned in some episode that she doesn't like people staring at it and Shione was taking pictures.</br>  <br>Well, she was asking for it.<br>She was coming on to Shione.<br><br>If you float around nakedly cute above me, you can be damn sure I'll be making pictures of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Their working pace is even slower than their 3Hz framerate.</br>  Well guys currently getting this series. Hope its a good one.    <br>Yeah, I can see that. The few times I've fapped to her were about that.</br>  <br>You sound like you have high expectations and are expecting a masterpiece. Will you make a thread later how shit it was and that /a/ has shit taste and that you hate us for luring you into watching the series?</br>  <br> 1110520155916.jpg <br> Fri, 11 Mar 2005 05:49:15 GMT <br>If you're going to use fake 4chan filenames, at least come up with something that doesn't date back to times before the anime even aired.</br></br></br>  <br>nah nigga. Only thing that worried me was the one anon saying the slice of life mixed with drama didnt work too well. <br><br>Sort of like gosick?</br></br></br>  <br>Autsim.</br>  <br>*Autism.</br>  <br>It's more like the drama of the first two arcs are irrational, or shallow and stupid.<br>After that, it becomes actually charming enough, at least that's how I felt. Too bad half of the series were spent by then.</br></br>  <br>Except Shione lives in a different city, so actually Nonoka chose the Noel route.</br>  <br>Thanks anon i appreciate the input.</br>  Face.  <br>It was decided from the start when they showed that handholding in the sunflowers scene, which actually happened immediately after 13.<br>Nonoka has good taste.</br></br>  <br>NGE reference in my SNM? Somebody confirmed for bro.</br>  <br>You mean in your Hokkaido.</br>  <br> implying Hokkaido is real </br>    Hokkaido is the most underrated Japanese Island.  <br>I've seen a number of anime set in Hokkaido but I'm hard pressed to remember one in Kyushu.</br>  <br>I had to look it up, but Sakamichi no Apollon.</br>  I forgot about this, and now I miss it a lot.   Season 2 maybe? ;_;    <br>About what? <br>Nonoka humping Shione with Noel standing in the door and asking why nobody wants to play with her and why they even brought her back?</br></br>  <br>You mean Nonoka humping Noel while Shione cries herself to sleep while hugging enban dakimakura.</br>  This show was my personal favourite of the season it aired. Can't wait to watch the OVA!  <br>I guess you don't love it enough to not save shitty tumblr gifs.</br>  <br>At least it allows to see who is the targeted audience. Same goes with SnK and snakefags.</br>  <br>I just grabbed it from my thread archive. Somebody else posted that image eons ago and I couldn't be fucked finding a different one.</br>  <br><br><br>How about the three of them become a cute family?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>But girls can't love girls. They are just friends.</br></br></br>  <br>Friends sharing a family register.</br>  <br> Sora no Method <br> targeted at tumblrfags <br>I really doubt. It was trying to get the otaku, but was too shallow for it.</br></br></br>  <br>He's just pretending to be retarded.</br>  <br>I can probably use this to trick people into watching the show. Just like pic related.</br>  <br>MUROMIIII</br>  <br><br>Not that guy, and it definitely wasn't aimed at them, but the outrage in the threads over a simple lewd edit seemed to suggest that they might be watching it anyway.</br></br>  Thought the thread would be dead by now, Im surprised its still up. Have a nonoka.  Could you guys please post more images? I missed the threads here when it was airing.    Nonoka X her Dad OTP  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Gross. Take it away.<br><br><br>Damn.

I don't even think Crow does that much in Episode 65 bar getting mad at Jack and Ghost.<br><br>Fuck off with this Crow hate meme, it's getting annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Crow beats Yuya and it's Crow vs. Jack and it completely ignores everything about Arc-V and turns into a 5Ds duel </br>  <br>I like how he went to Yuya's room first</br>  <br> Crow wins by spamming Blizzard <br>Best boy, cant remember the last duel that so closely resembles real ones</br></br>  <br>Sawatari vs. Security, so not that long ago.</br>  So why doesn't Yuya go searching for Yuzu now that apparently the doors are unlocked instead of hugging on Reira  <br>I wouldnt be surprised if that's not part of the reason he left his room, but calling Reiji a piece of shit comes first</br>  <br>A YGO MC can only be straight for so long.</br>  <br><br>He misses his shota Sora.

Reiji comes in after his little bro. Either takes his little bro back with him or leave Reira to cool himself with Yuya's presence. Meanwhile he closes the door behind him as he leaves.  :^) </br>  Why is thi scene so based  <br>Because it's the power rangers</br>  now that I think about it Johan's crystal beasts got two pendulum monsters, does that mean we'll see him in Arc-V?  <br>Yuya look like he wants to punch the viewers in the face</br>  <br>Possible, but I doubt it. CyDras got Infinity but unless Kaiser is running a Xyz/Fusion Resistance within Academia then what cards come out don't mean much.</br>  Why were people in the last thread saying Gon handed Crow the win? He attacked, same as he was planning on doing before he heard the story, and he didnt have any follow up plays  <br>Blizzard is the only non trash card he used.</br>  <br>Listening to the story gave Crow enough time to get to an Action Card, or something to that extent.</br>  <br>Trying to shit on Crow while justifying Gongenzaka. Crow could have easily put his monster in Defense Mode to keep off the attack and Crow could have re-done his Blizzard combo. Crow was going to win the whole time, Action Card or not.<br><br>But you know, hate clouds the eyes of judgement.</br></br></br>  <br> Stopping to monologue and listen to backstory <br>But everybody does that in duels</br></br>  <br>It is.

Nobody said Meiru handed Yuya the win when she talked so much about MUH FUTURE and he ended up grabbing an Action Card just in time</br></br>  <br>exactly</br>  <br>This is suposed to be an alternate version of Crow, Arc-V has a multiverse plot (with Fusion, Synchro and Xyz having their own dimension, the main characters come from the "Standard" dimension that can use all the summon methods plus the New Pendulums.<br>Crow either got his cards from his mentor like in 5Ds, got them in a dumpster or stole them from some rich people</br></br>  My sides. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bvP<wbr>NNSiGQbo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>     Old /a/ used to talk about Nanoha daily <br> New /a/ doesn't even talk about the current airing show <br>Has /a/ been taken over by normies?</br></br>  <br>No, it's just garbage except for A's.</br>  <br>What's a nano ho? I've heard of having bitches in different area codes but never nano hos. That's a new one, gr8 job m8.</br>  <br>Old /a/ didn't agree with you.</br>  <br>there's better little girl anime like gakkou gurashi</br>  We only love Naruto here.  <br>Stardust Witch Meruru is better anyway.</br>  <br>The TV series killed ViVid by being such a normalfag adaptation as you claim /a/ to be.</br>  <br><br>/a/ isn't and never was a hivemind. Nice dubs though.</br></br>  <br> Gakkou Gurashi <br> little girl anime <br>They are 18, with one of them being 17, and the design is not particularly loli, save it for Yuki.</br></br></br>  <br>Has it become not-shit yet?</br>  <br>It's by A-1. So no.</br>  <br>That's what normies say.</br>  <br><br>gakkou gurashi is lucky star tier characters in a horror setting, that's all</br></br>  <br><br>dafuq's with their eyes?</br></br>  <br> lucky star tier characters <br>No, they are not nearly as super deformed or stylized.<br>Really they are not lolis, much less little girls.</br></br></br>   normies <br>Well, its seems we've been taken over by /r9k/ crossboarders.</br>  So old /a/ was 2 month ago and now is the new /a/ that doesn't talk about shit show, im fine with that  The new airing show is shit. /a/ has better taste than that.  <br>Stop confusing yourself normie</br>  <br>It's not just /a/<br> no nips care about it <br> the staff doesn't care about it  <br> QUALITY, ugly simplified designs, fanservice cut the fuck out <br> BDs are not even up for sale <br>It flopped hard, just as it deserved after A-1 shiteaters removed one of the main appeal of the series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  yes, /a/ is dead blame narutards daily thread  <br><br><br> normie <br>Go back to /r9k/.</br></br></br></br>  <br> current airing <br>Didn't it finish last season?</br></br>  <br>A lot of old /d/ daily threads are gone or died out. Even Nanoha can't be spared from this. Vivid had threads when it was airing though, so you're wrong there. Granted, the activity wasn't highly towards the end of the season, and it's the decline in Nanoha fans in general over the years is the cause for that.</br>  <br>old /a/*<br><br>Don't know how I fucked up there.</br></br></br>  <br> A-1 shiteaters removed one of the main appeal of the series. <br>What? they didn't remove anything, that's what the manga is like.</br></br>  <br>Corona qt. Sieg too.</br>  <br>They removed the fanservice you idiot.</br>  LRD thread, don't forget your sage.  <br> fanservice </br>  <br>Then should we say erotic fanservice, or do you want to play dumb?<br>And don't even say that wasn't part of the manga's charm.</br></br>  <br>Say sexy bits you tool.</br>  <br> muh fanservice <br>fuck off. At least they spent their little budget wisely and gave us great battles<br>Action&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fanservice</br></br></br>  <br> There are Nanoha bros who still reply to LRD's bait <br>This fagget says the same shit for Prisma Illya.</br></br>  <br>The vivid anime is just terrible. Why are they in track suits, anyway? They should exercise like the ancient Greeks.<br><br><br> muh <br><br><br>The action was awful another major weak point of the show; 0/10.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> terrible <br>  Why are they in track suits, anyway? <br> action was awful <br>0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br> wisely <br> great battles <br>It's just tournament shit without anything at stake, and the artstyle made it worthless, not to mention one minute of action scene would have been enough for 50 minutes of high tier fanservice.<br>Yet the faggots decided they will blow all money into only one thing, because their morality doesn't let anything more, and it was still cheap, filled with QUALITY and had horrible designs to begin with,<br><br><br>Well Prisma Illya was adapted far too tame as well, they always blow their efforts into the kiss scenes, and forget to draw their bodies delicious and lewd.<br>At least it's nowhere near ViVid's complete faggotry level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Obviously. <br>Also, screw the haters I'm looking forward to season 2.</br></br></br>  <br><br> New /a/ doesn't even talk about the current airing show <br><br>That's because the old shows wasn't carried only by loli fanservice. Even StrikerS had a passable story, setting and characters. Vivid has nothing going for with besides the service scenes, I might as well just download some Nanoha hentai, which there are plenty, and be done with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That didn't stop people from discussing it though. There was still a lot of fighting among the fanbase, but the threads used to last for days even though it wasn't airing.</br></br>  <br>I want to hug her.</br>  <br> Vivid has nothing going for with besides the service scenes <br>It doesn't even have service scenes aside from a very ridiculously tame shitty bath scene.</br></br>  <br>This is what happens when the slow panning service scene of the adaptation looks like this.<br>ViVid died.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if Seven Arcs released that fucking movie we'd have something to talk about.</br>  I enjoy the Nanoha franchise a lot, but I do not like parts of the fanbase. The fightan and powerlevelfags are okay but the /u/fags and the lolifags are cancer. Can't even enjoy cute girls doing cute things unless they're being massively pandered to. It's obnoxious.  New /a/ is old /a/ recycled except a bit more serious. Instead of faggots from gaia and chatango we have people from r/anime acting like pretentious douchebags. On the plus side blogshit is kept to a minimum but the whole 3DPD thing has literally become a meme where its posted in shit like Seiyuu threads.<br><br>Honestly I'm different but it's still funny to see people flip when someone posts ;_; though people /r9k/ need to go since they're actually annoying.</br></br>  <br> massively pandered to <br>More like seeing them being appreciated, instead of awkwardly covered up as if they were disgusting shit, and giving them QUALITY designs since "who cares, they are disgusting shit anyways".<br>No, thanks, I'd rather a staff that doesn't think like that, and maybe after that I could enjoy cute girls doing cute things. <br>Not that any of them did any cute thing in ViVid, since there weren't SoL scenes, only fighting and training.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the lolifags are cancer <br>Who the fuck do you think made this franchise big after the first two series?<br>Ungrateful fucking action fags I swear to god.</br></br></br>   Innocent Sound Stage <br>Anime soon  after the GoD anime .<br><br><br> Old /a/ used to talk about Nanoha daily <br>Not really.</br></br></br></br></br>    old nanoha threads were just garbage animesuki transplants anyway. why would you miss talking about a series with retards who think innocent is good?  <br><br>Fuck off. Tournaments are great. Not everything has to be life or death battles. The battles in Vivid were fun, and I'm glad they chose to spend their little budget in them instead of fanservice<br>Action&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;fanse<wbr>rvice.</wbr></br></br></br>  I want LRD and annoyed hetfags to go.  <br><br><br> normies <br>Jesus christ.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You are a fucking retard that can't even read or comprehend the problem some people have it.<br>Action and fanservice are both an important part of ViVid.<br>Action scenes cost 100 times more than fanservice scenes.<br>They still cut out all fanservice, just because of their shitty morality, and despite that the show still looked horrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want people who don't like loli or care about their fanservice to go.</br>  <br>Get fucked, fanservicefag<br>Fanservice should always be an optional side dish<br>Action is the main dish. I prefer great and fun battles to fanservice. I'm glad they didn't pander to fucks like you. It's not because of morality. It's because they had budget and/or production issues. Every single show by A1 in Spring looked shitty</br></br></br>  OP is a normie  You wouldn't a Yuri.    <br> It's not because of morality. It's because they had budget and/or production issues. <br>No, since it wouldn't take anything not to cut the fanservice. It has nothing to do with budget or production. This is A-1 faggotry.</br></br>  <br>But they didn't cut it. The bath scenes were still there. The problem is that it looked shitty for budget and/or production issues. Every single show by them in Spring looked shitty. That can't be a coincidence</br>  <br>Oh they cut or changed just enough scenes besides the bath scene.<br>The funnies was the bathing with mamas "give Fate a service shot, but don't dare show Vivio's body" bullshit.</br></br>  Amite is my waifu.  <br>I always figured nanoha has been a unpopular series since forever.</br>    Higa Yukari  <br>You'd have point, if they didn't show everyone during the hot springs scene</br>  <br>It's not like they showed much.<br>And bath scenes are bath scenes either ways, even the most innocent shows have them for a reason.<br>Unless they focus strongly on them it's not real fanservice, and they sure did focus more on that shit eating number than any of the lolis.</br></br></br>      <br>If you are who I think you are, you're just a shitposter who wants a loli hentai to air on TV. Even on Prisma, you complain, and that sure as hell focuses on the lolis in it's TV version</br>  Best Onee-chan.        <br>Nice shitpost</br>    <br> who wants a loli hentai <br>I just want lolicon material to at least be brought into animation on an almost regular ecchi level.<br>I don't need it to be extremely lewd, just some nicely drawn bodies. Illya blew all budget on the kiss scene, and they didn't draw their bodies basically.</br></br></br>  dat hair    <br>The bodies in Illya are well drawn, you shitposter. <br>Hell, if we're gonna compare to regular ecchi shows, it actually looks better than DxD S3</br></br>  <br> completely remove subaru and teana's nipples in hotspring scene <br> "waah muh lolis r ruined" -you </br></br>  I want a proper scan.  Reminder that normie is a term made up by normalfags trying to fit in, alot like OP and this thread.  <br> current airing show <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Not true. DxD S3 had plenty of cameltoes and curvy legs/butts. Even this season has show like Shimoneta or Okuusama with well drawn bodies. I don't even need them to go that way, but the blob navels are a bit too much.<br><br>It's almost sad how lewd that small girl is, and how far away the anime is from the manga.</br></br></br>      <br>Now I know you're shitposting. <br>Illya looks really nice, and definitely better than the QUALITY fest that was BorN</br></br>  oh god Stern  <br> Illya looks really nice <br>Maybe, but they are not nearly drawing them as lewd as DxD or the manga is.<br>No tone, shine, shadow, vagina bones, cameltoes on them.</br></br></br>    I want to pet Lynith.  <br>Everyone moved onto Symphogear.</br>  <br> lolifans died with ViVid anime <br> mechafans died with Symphogear <br>Quite funny.</br></br></br>    <br>Nanoha isn't a loli anymore so I've lost interest.</br>  Nanoha is too good for normies to watch tbh<br>They don't have to even know it tbh</br>    <br> lucky star tier characters <br>So, good characters?</br></br>  Don't mind me, just posting bestest Vivid.  <br> Symphogear <br>We have the Corona though.</br></br>    <br> Has /a/ been taken over by normies? <br>Yes. The most reasurring confirmation of that is that you, the OP pretending to be an oldfag, is using normie isntead of normalfag. It's normalfag, not normie.<br><br>Fucking newfags.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>StrikerS was disappointing but otherwise alright.<br><br>The first movie was good, the second movie was missing a lot of content.<br><br>Vivid is kind of boring. Force is just all around shit.<br><br>Nanoha is dead mate. I remember all those Nanoha/Fate threads but the magic is gone. Let go already.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>          <br> It's not lewd, so it's bad <br>What a shtty logic</br></br>  <br>They need some evil force/organization and a threat. I remember watching the first to third season of Nanoha and rooting for Nanoha as she faces overwhelming odds.<br><br>The tournament arc of Vivid is ok though, but it could have been a lot better.</br></br></br>      <br><br>I agree with you at least. <br>Fanservice should always be second to good action and believable character relationships.</br></br></br>  <br> not lewd, so it's bad <br>I didn't say that.<br>Just that they didn't really drew their bodies lewd for the adaptation.</br></br></br>    Best Vivid.    <br>Houki type is always worst.</br>    <br>If it's not bad, then why are you complaining?<br>Do you really expect anime adaptations to be able to match the manga art styles? <br>Because you should stop expecting that. It's dumb to think weekly anime can have drawings with the quality of monthly manga</br></br></br>    <br>I don't really like her for some reason.</br>      <br>No, and you should stop exaggerating my words or playing dumb/intentionally not understanding my complaint.<br>They sure as hell have budget to draw some definitions to the bodies, plump asses and nice thighs, buttcheeks and cameltoes. They are also in the manga as well.<br>But do we get them in the anime? No. Do we get them for any shitty ecchi with cowtit girls? Yes, even if they don't have 1/10th the budget of Prisma Illya.<br>It's a good thing that it's not garbage as ViVid anime was, but it's still a shame they aren't going for nice bodies we could appreciate or service shots of them. I'm a loli body enthusiast, that's important to me.<br>If they went so far with the kiss scene either ways, it wouldn't have hurt them to casually draw their bodies more lewd, and considering the fuckload amount of budget they will eventually have in the action scenes, it wouldn't have hurt the wallet either,</br></br></br></br></br>      I can't believe there's still no BDs for this. They're not even up for preorders, but why? I suppose they will release a BD box eventually, however the fact that they haven't even announced it smells like shitty marketing.    <br>I'm not playing dumb. <br>Don't assume everyone has to understand your shitty logic<br>Also, I don't rermeber Luvia or Rin having ther bodies more defined than the lolis, so stop thinking it's some evil illuminati conspirancy against loli</br></br></br>  <br> normies <br>Posting in an /r9k/ thread.</br></br>    <br> Also, I don't rermeber Luvia or Rin having ther bodies more defined than the lolis, so stop thinking it's some evil illuminati conspirancy against loli <br>No, you misunderstand me. I'm not really angry at Illya, more like I'm disappointed and underwhelmed. It's still alright, but a shame they didn't put a bit of effort into drawing the girls' bodies. All in all, Illya is fine, not good but not inherently bad.<br>ViVid on the other hand is a complete fucking bullshit, that is a worthless pile of shit that completely butchered the loli service on moral grounds, or because the staff was probably disgusted by lolis.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what King Records/Aniplex/Seven Arcs are thinking. It's insane.</br>     downloaded nanoha at the start of the year <br> never ended up watching it <br>Welp<br>I don't think that's going to change any time soon either</br></br></br>  Sette is cute.  <br><br>No fans would buy it, or care.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  /r/ full pic  <br>Delete it.

I love the bits with the Materials in innocent just because of that. </br>  <br>They didn't suffer it quite as hard as the lolis did (Fate did get her service scene, and the ass focus on Teana/Subaru/whichever number in bath scene was more than the lolis got), despite ViVid having more loli service originally.</br>  <br>Damn, I need an anime with Materials.</br>  <br>This.
