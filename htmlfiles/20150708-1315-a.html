[ Now that even Hibike! "We want the K-on audience" Euphonium didn't manage to reach 10k, it's obvious Kyoani is going to try to replicate Free success.<br><br>Is your body ready?</br></br>  What went wrong with Euphonium?  Maybe Kyoani will now beg Kadokawa to let them make more Haruhi.  Kyoani is a pro at pandering   Hibike! "We want the K-on audience" Euphonium  <br><br>Kyoanus is doomed</br></br>  <br> replicate Free success. <br>Yes, and I don't see why it's a bad thing. Shows intended for the fujo crowd usually sell like hotcakes and are on average better than the otaku and western pandering shows. KyoAni are already releasing a prequel film later this year for Free, so they've got a big money maker coming up anyway.</br></br>  <br>The real question is how is Kyoani going to pay their debt to their creditors? They have no money now.</br>  <br>High Speed movie.</br>  IT'S TIME!<br>IT'S TIME!<br>IT'S FMP TIME!</br></br>  Hibike and K-On are nothing alike  <br>With the way KyoAni has fallen from grace since the Haruhi film, I'd rather they weren't involved.</br>   kyoani   <br>Haruhi was shit from the start.</br>    <br>We both know that will not happen unless they apply austerity politics to their management.</br>    <br>Nobody said that.</br>  <br>OP implied it with the we want the K-On audience</br>  <br>They can still be aiming for the same audience without them being similair.</br>  <br>That's not how audiences work. You can just make salad and expect meat audiences to like it.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It's highly doubtful they can replicate Free's success. Free's success was due to the novelty factor: it was the first fujoshit series that was executed that well on a technical level. This was something fujos had been waiting years for.<br>No future fujoshit anime will ever have that kind of novelty factor again.</br></br>  Isnt Hibike like K-on but with a bit more drama added?<br><br>I mean they are both about highschool girls playing in a band and doing cutesy shit for the otakus to jack off to</br></br>  Free was pretty decent so I don't mind. Whatever feeds the industry money  Can you enjoy Free! if you are not particularly into male homosexuality?  They just need to churn out Amaburi OVAs with bikini Sento as the main focus  As a Keion fan I didn't even watch one episode of hibikek.  <br>Motivations and personalities are different.<br><br>K-On is mainly about Yui trying to find a place to belong and eventually the theme centers around the characters' friendships and how they grow, the last few episodes turn melancholic with Azusa coming to terms with the fact that her friends will no longer be around when they graduate. The music part of K-On is not the point.<br><br>Hibike is about the motivations and obstacles a musician can have while playing on a band. The protagonist herself doesn't understand why people around her take band so seriously (specially Reina), she's afraid of commitment and passion. Reina slowly turns her to their side and it's made apparent during this scene and how she finally admits she loves playing the euphonium at the end of the series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't much like K-On! at all but it wasn't terrible. One of the better series series KyoAni have made in recent times. The best TV series they made since Hyouka.</br>  <br>Enjoy your taaki.</br>  <br>Upcoming new Jump series by Masahiro Hirakata is already on it.</br>  What are you retards talking about? With Euphonium near 8k KyoAni makes a tidy profit, even more than other studios because their shows have a slightly lower budget than average and because they own the property and are their own publisher/distributor. Not every show of theirs needs to break 20k for them to keep operating.   If nothing gets to 10k its a failure. <br>Are you joking.</br>  <br>  they own the property <br>I'm pretty sure they had to buy licensing from the novel author they are adapting from</br></br>  <br> If it doesn't get to 10k, they probably won't make a S2 <br><br>ftfy you cancerous tripfag</br></br></br>  <br>They completely bought the IP though, none of the money from the series is going to someone like Kadokawa. Sure, the acquisition costs money, but now they're in complete control without needing too many outside companies on the production committee.</br>  <br><br>KyoAni's magic number for a second season is 15k not 10k.</br></br>  <br>that does not mean this post  is false</br>  <br>Yeah that's not true either.<br><br>Nice.</br></br></br>  <br> Kuroko no Basuke <br> Haikyuu <br> UtaPri <br>Nah son. We've been living in the fujoshi era for a while now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't get this hate for fujos. Aren't they allowed to have their own moe and yaoi undertone shows? Cute girls doing cute things shows are still the majority</br>  <br>They should just do male idol show or slice of life comedy without drama.</br>  <br>Of course. If by making one fujoshit show would give them enough money to animate 3 non-fujo shows then I'm all for it.</br>  <br><br>The combined BD/DVD sales are now 8,776. BD sales were 940 last week and 1,094 the week before. Volume 1 will at least get to 10K. No idea on how the rest will sell though.</br></br>  I am pretty sure Vol 1 will get 10k yeah. /a/ is so fucking quick to jump to conclusions holy shit  <br>If you're implying that those shows were executed as technically well as Free, you'd be extremely wrong. If you're implying something regarding those shows' sales, implying that fujoshit shows are what's selling the most these days, I'd just have to say, "Love Live."</br>  <br> sports shounen  <br> reverse harem  <br><br>Neither of those are actual overt fujoshi pandering shows like Free. Fujoshi liking a show =/= fujoshi pandering. They like anything with qt male characters.</br></br></br></br>  The situation with Euphonium is somewhat unique for Kyoani.<br><br>Euphonium is neither a novel that was written for the sole purpose of being adapted by Kyoani (like the source material for Free, Chuunibyou, etc.), nor was a novel owned by a publishing company that contacted Kyoani and hired them to make it into an anime adaptation (like Haruhi, Hyouka, etc.).<br><br>Euphonium was originally a novel published by a completely unrelated publishing company, written by an author with no connection to Kyoani.<br>A few Kyoani employees read the novels, and liked them enough to convince the rest of the company to try to make an anime adaptation of it. So they contacted the publisher and eventually bought the rights to the anime adaptation. They are the sole owner of the right for the anime adaptation and can do whatever they want with it.<br><br>Remember how Tamako Market was made? Kyoani was planning on making season 3 of K-On!, but Yamada convinced them to make Tamako Market, their own anime original work instead. K-On! was very popular at the time and it would have easily been profitable, but Kyoani instead went with a riskier project simply because they liked it more.<br><br>So they're not a company that chases only profit and is willing to engage in other projects simply because they like them. And they still have their cash cow Free!, so it's not like they're in any kind of financial problems.<br><br>Euphonium was not a flop, it made a pretty decent profit. So if Kyoani wants to adapt the rest of the story, there is no reason for them not to, just because the sales were not as high as some people expected them to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The storm may have calmed, but to this day I still don't understand why people got so butt blasted over Free.</br>    <br>Because Kyoani could have made an anime that pandered to me instead of making an anime that pandered to them.</br>  <br>Scared of being turned gay</br>  <br>You can turn gay?</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>I want to see Kyoani adapt Amanchu, just for the pottery. Besides, the scenery porn will be glorious.<br><br>Gay swimming.<br> Lesbian diving. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyoani was TEH studio that pandered to moefags and otaku, and it was a relatively high-profile studio and not someone like DEEN or J.C. Staff.<br><br>So, you suddenly got this studio who pandered exclusively to moefags (I mean, Haruhi threw a bone a fujo back then, but that's it) suddenly making an anime about half-naked boys with no girls in sight. They felt like they were betrayed for those alien creatures called fujoshi + add the eternal butthurt FMA fans.<br><br>I mean, right now it seems silly, but I still remember Commie "GAY SWIMMING". It's like something that no one could ever imagine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So they're not a company that chases only profit <br> Shitty park anime with tits <br> That one monogatari clone with forced moe </br></br></br>  <br> forced moe <br>what is this</br></br>  cute boys &gt; cute girls  <br>And non-plebs will know how stupid it is to only ever eat one kind of thing your entire life</br>  <br>Too much yuri bait, doesn't deliver.</br>  <br>it doesn't? Oh! Who would have imagined that Kyoani would back-stab otakus again?</br>  <br>Everytime. Thank you anon. <br><br><br>/argument</br></br></br></br>  <br>According to AX14, they're still begging to adapt the rest of Hyouka novel.</br>  <br>But Kyoani never finish what they start.<br>It happened with K-On! Haruhi, FMP, Nichijou, Chuunibyou, Hyouka, Naruto...</br></br>  <br>It is happening right now you idiot, Takemoto is directing it.</br>  I get so disappointed when someone I admire says they like free/anything yaoi/anything by kyoani.  <br>I liked the proto-frees better than the actual Free designs.</br>  <br>Who is that guy?</br>  <br> with no girls in sight <br>There were two hot girls</br></br>  <br>Gou is the best female character Kyoani has written, but she wasn't presented immediately and certainly wasn't a focus.</br>   <br><br>The heroine was clumsy as hell despite the fact it made no sense</br></br>  <br> not knowing based Takemoto <br>Why are you even in this thread?</br></br>  <br> Gou is the best female character Kyoani has written <br>lol</br></br>  <br>Director of Disappearance, Hyouka, Amagi, great episode director. Influenced by Shinbo a little.</br>  <br>You forgot fumoffu and tsr.</br>  <br>Too much yuri bait? Basically 1 min out of 13 episodes. <br>Too much indeed</br></br>  <br>What the shit are you talking about, most episodes had at least one yuribait scene</br>  <br>Oh yeah I forgot Fumoffo<br>I didn't forget TSR because unlike Fumoffu I didn't like it</br></br>  <br>Name one.</br>  <br>she a very realistic character<br>a woman who only cares about male abs</br></br>  <br><br>Go watch the actual show instead of reading shit threads. <br>I had forgotten two girls speaking with each other was disgusting yuri pandering here.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, they weren't talking about the weather. It couldn't have been more obvious if they were saying they want to rub their cunts together.</br>  <br/>  <br>Actually in all those scenes they were talking about improving as musicians aka the whole fucking point of MC's character arc. <br><br>Youtubing the meme scenes instead of watching said show isn't healthy anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you want the scene to be yuri doesn't make it so</br>  <br><br>Are you saying Kyoani didn't intend to bait yurifags with this?</br></br>  <br>the quotes are from the novels, but kyoani make them look/sound lewd<br><br>that doesn't change the meanings though</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Did I fucking stutter? I don't even want it to be yuri, they just bait it. Talking about improving as musicians doesn't have to involve that much adoration, touching and "love" confessions.<br><br>Yes, that's exactly why it's bait.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Sure, if you want to, but that doesn't make it the point or the most logical reading of the scene. Joking about confessing love was a meme between them since episode 8. <br><br>Still don't really get why this turned into something so infuriating to everyone since the entire show was about their relationship.</br></br></br>  <br>Full BL anime by kyoani when?</br>  <br>Which part of that post was /u/? There's a difference between being a yurifag and acknowledging that there were scenes where Kyoani baited yurifags.</br>  <br>OH NO THEY TOUCHED, STOP THE DAMN FIGHT. Listen to yourself, holy shit</br>  <br> if you want to <br>I don't want to. I'm just saying that scenes like those were written with yuribaiting in mind.</br></br>  <br><br>You fucking faggot, Amagi was brilliant. Fite me in the local park, I'll wrek your shit.</br></br>  <br> Using a tumblr gif <br><br>You already lost.</br></br></br>  <br> Amagi was brilliant <br>indeed</br></br>  <br><br>Nigger I stole this shit off some thread here a while back. But if you're goin' to be a little bitch about it, pretend I used the reaction image I posted this time.</br></br>  <br>So are you saying kyonami didn't yuribait at all with this one, or what's your point?<br>I don't get why people get so buttmad over me pointing out the seemingly obvious fact that they baited yurifags.<br><br><br><br>Stop shitposting asshole</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Again this is one sentence, a ten seconds scene, out of 13 episodes. <br>Saying that the show is just about yuribaiting is bullshit</br></br></br>  <br> this butthurt </br>  <br> kyonami </br>  <br> Saying that the show is just about yuribaiting <br>I never said that though. But it was more than just one scene, and the yuribait is what caused the most discussion and will probably be what the show is remembered for, for better or worse.</br></br>  <br> Kyonami <br>Solid Snake moe anime when?</br></br>  <br>Just wondering why it's such an offensive thing to you that it did that. It was well established that they were both attracted to each other, it's not as if it came completely out of left field, yet by the tone of people like you it seems like it completely become something fake and pandering as soon as it did that, when it was the whole point of the show to detail their relationship.</br>  <br>Careful, some people might actually start believing this.</br>  <br>Nips have shit taste, as per usual.</br>  <br>You may have not, but a lot of people did. <br>Because dumb people prefer fighting over shipping, romance and yuri while it's clearly not the anime's point. <br>Those shitty discussions ruined the show, and if it's what it's gonna be remembered for, then it is a real shame.</br></br></br>  <br>It's selling pretty ok though. Will definitely break 10k.</br>  Utsumi will deliver Violet Ever Garden for sure.  <br>Women are weak.</br>  <br>This. Any replications to the trend will be a rehash of Free's archetypes and tropes. All Kyoani needs to do is release Autumn and Winter inbetween prequels of Free and Highspeed and they keep the gravy train going.</br>  <br>Their show doesn't have lower budget than average faggot, stop believing random people on twitter<br>And Hibike hardly reached 8k with an EVENT TICKET<br>Next volumes will sell 5k at most</br></br></br>  <br> stop believing random people on twitter <br>Prove the contrary, I think a random angry anon is less believable.</br></br>  <br> And Hibike hardly reached 8k with an EVENT TICKET <br>It's going to hit 10k for sure<br>Do you think only week 1 counts or something</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that moefags got BTFO<br>Kekkai Sensen sold 3 times more than hibekek</br>  <br>Nigga please.

Anyone I know who's farsighted only puts on glasses when they're needed.<br> I accept your point and that's probably the reason why, but I just don't get it. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, the real reason she has glasses at all is that abec likes glasses.</br>  <br>He's got good taste.</br>  Because she is a qt 3.14  <br> Alicization when? <br>Soon™</br></br>  <br> Either she's just wearing glasses for fashion or she transcends human perception, but its gotta be something. <br>They're "bullet proof" glasses she wears to make herself feel (even a tiny bit) safer.<br><br>Web novel, she didn't have glasses, but abec wanted Glasses anyways, so Kawahara thought of a reason for her to have them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> only puts on glasses when they're needed <br>Don't they need it when goes out, like go out to shopping or to recognizing someone's face when talking?</br></br>  <br>That's pretty cute.</br>  <br>There was also a Q&amp;A for the web novel, where here eye-sight was basically described as near-super-human, so there's that.</br>   Ah, Agil and Klein became more handsome. He was totally some wandering samurai in the materials I received, so following it too faithfully will make him too eye-catching… (haha). Also, we had a conversation over how Leafa’s “weapons” were lacking, so she got big breasts by Miki-san’s suggestion. As for Shino, I like glasses and went, “The glasses factor is too weak! Let’s make Shino a glasses girl!” while on the topic of SAO’s heroines and that ended up being adopted (haha). <br>abec pls</br>  <br><br>she isn't even the MC of her own show</br></br>  Asada-san<br><br>Asada-san<br><br>Asada-san!<br><br>Asada-san!<br><br>Asada-san!<br><br>ASSADASAN</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not as cute, that's the opposite of cute.

Both of my eyes are 2.0. * <br><br> 2.0 can also be defined as 20/10 or 6/3 in the foot and metric system respectively. It’s eyesight twice as good as the average person. <br><br>Not sure if that's actually super-human or not; I just remember some argument on a thread a long time ago where someone was saying that it was pretty close to being super human.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the best possible eyesight that's been recorded without aids, and it's also the best possible eyesight people with 20/20 can achieve with aids. <br><br>Shit's dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>welcome to sao</br>  <br><br>Because every other SAO is shit.</br></br>  <br> Kawahara knowing shit about what he's writing. <br>I don't think he was trying to give her near-impossible eye-sight—I think he just didn't research it when he was writing the web novel.</br></br>   Sawashiro flowchart.gif   On another note, is there really any other way they could have animated this scene without the romantic implications?

Especially considering Jotaro's body would have been that of a sweet gentle boy, even if his mind hadn't regressed yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  first for gay priest  <br>First for best Jojo</br>  You have 10 seconds to explain why Speedwagon isn't your favorite character.  <br><br>Best brojo after Gyro.</br></br>  <br> not with mini avudol </br>  <br><br>I don't think there is way that Joseph Ripple could damage Alessi, and Joseph can't see Alessi shadow because it's a stand (de-aged Joseph doesn't have a stand) Joseph is fucked <br><br> But I accept it would be cool anyways <br><br> &gt;inb4 Joseph defeats Alessi with ultimate asspulls </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> imply fujos would care about the black guy </br>  <br> needing a stand to fight stand users <br> Thinking a guy with two steel balls and some body energy wizardry couldn't take on stand users <br><br>I bet you haven't even read past Heaven have you?</br></br></br></br>  <br>don't you remember when joseph knocked a guy out with ripple</br>  <br><br>Of course</br></br>  <br> constantly teasing Jotaro running into young Joseph but it never happens and by the time they meet again Alessi's already defeated <br><br>You know araki would do it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Meanwhile these two</br></br>  Draw request<br> Can someone draw something like this (elephant or wooly mammoth skull lying on the floor, not at this exact angle) with Tusk act 4 popping up from behind it?   want to use it for an album cover <br><br><br> doesn't need a stand to fight stand users just uses his balls <br>Gyro a best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>someone post that page where he fits the steel ball in a bottle</br>  Is /a/ sings Sono Chi no Kioku still happening?  <br> daily reminder that joseph has spin now </br>  I have a boner after looking at the mona lisa<br><br>what should I do</br></br>  <br>i wish. a few anons seem to disapprove of it though<br>but thats a given<br>its really simple honestly someone just needs to "take the first napkin" and get the ball rolling and we'll all follow</br></br></br>  <br>get hit by an ambulance and go to hell</br>  <br>Get a grip, hand yourself in to the authorities, and hopefully get back in touch with reality.</br>  <br>Stab yourself with an arrow and use your catman ghost to rape women and blow them up</br>  So how does he work?<br><br>Could he turn back time punching the daytime and reduced it to 12AM because it's considered zero?<br><br>What limitations does this fucker have, if any?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He has to punch it, GER doesn't have infinite range<br> Punches Diavolo <br> Dies for eternity infinite times </br></br></br></br>  <br>literally set things to "zero"<br>no limit</br></br>  <br>MY MEME WAS STOLEN, I REPEAT, MY MEME WAS STOLEN</br>    <br> I'm a meme? <br><br>See that's where you're wrong.

After Jotaro stopped time, he should have punched the defenseless dio up so high that he went over the horizon line of the Earth and the sun would destroys his head. <br><br>Then everything from the neck down would fall back to earth"you only lost because you pissed me off" and Jotaro takes the body of his grandfather back, give the bullshit blood transfusion to Joseph and we have a full circle of taking back what Dio stole.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never made this one.<br><br><br>Last panel, horse hair.<br>Kick panel, Steel Ball.<br><br> It's a very faint png of the face I use on my FB profile pic. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There's another one you didn't find out unless I point it out. <br>is it even effective at that point?<br><br><br> cuddlefucking <br>i just fapped god dammit<br>definitely  Jolyne <br><br><br>niiiiceu</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>  I kinda like that  </br>  <br><br>Largely depends on what you want.

Because I still want to fuck  Pucci .</br>  <br>i think the jotaro ending was pretty bullshit too but i think it was supposed to show us (as I think polnareff said) that jotaro was a very intense person even as a young kid. i think we're supposed to assume anything that holly said about jotaro being nice might have been slightly exaggerated. but regardless, still a bullshit fight</br>  <br>I took it to mean that a little bit of Star Platinum was there from the start</br>  <br>no matter what way you look at it, baby punches was a massive asspull.</br>  <br>Hey Doc, can you post the link to your imgur?</br>  <br>http://docg95ehh5tlv3.imgur.com/</br>  just finished part 5, what the fuck did i just read, what was all this bullshit even.<br>what was araki even thinking.</br>  So is The world Jonathan's stand?  <br>Fuck off</br>   you will never have Gyro tease you around with his steel balls   <br>was there golden rectangles?</br>  Was von Stroheim a brojo?  <br>He is one of the more competent JoJo allies, and after   his robot surgery   Joseph didn't have to worry about his safety. He was extremely useful in  the final battle .</br>  <br>The naziest one.</br>  <br>King crimson fight should have totally been about manipulating epithet's 10 second limit getting the Diavolo by surprise after hes already skipped time and his ability cooldown is happening. <br><br>Gang Pieces together first the 5 second time skip and the 10 second future read. You could even bullshit having them get the info from doppio before killing him.<br><br>After all the body swap nonsense, we know that Doppio was in Brunos body, and Diavolo knew he was alone. So they could have totally played with Trish pretending to be Doppio inside Mista and pretend to kill Giorno in accordance with the time skip, and right when the time skip ends and giorno looks like hes dead as epiphet predicted (really just been stretched by Spice girls) and Diavolo is laughing at his triumph, Giorno surprise attacks and gets a massive blow, and while trying to react, Mista from afar gets the final headshot while distracted.<br><br>No bullshit GER, no infinite deaths, just playing out a good fight. <br><br>Then after that have the final final fight be with SCR.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I'm evil?  <br> making diavolo see future where he wins <br> he skips time to make it so <br> get oingo boingoed where it happens but still fucks over in his face <br><br>Fucking beautiful.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Tusk act 4 <br>Wtf man I'm at chapter 40 and all he can do is spin his nails</br></br>  <br> So how does he work? <br><br>Ask Todd. He knows.</br></br></br>  <br>It gets crazy.</br>  <br><br>Alessi's shadow isn't very powerful, and young Joseph could tango with Pillar men head on. If Jotaro as a schoolchild can beat Alessi, young Joseph would curbstomp him.</br></br>  I wish somehow Kars got back to earth in the next Jojo. It's been way too long since there was an actual fight  <br>I know you can beat the shit of him.<br>but how many times Alessi really needs?<br>I mean how much time Jotaro was in the shadow?<br>Jotaro lost 10 years because of that (17 years &gt; 7years) so how many seconds would alessi need?</br></br></br></br>  <br>well the lady in indian was touching it for 10 seconds before she was a fetus. And she was probably mid-late twenties. <br><br>So Joseph being 67 would dance around in the shadow before he was in any real danger. And even still 10 year old Joseph still had enough ripple to incapacitate a grown man.</br></br></br>  <br>I need this fight</br>  <br><br>I would have liked it if instead of waiting for the sun, they have the revived Joseph destroy his body with Hamon. That at least would have been a fitting end for its relevancy.</br></br>  The one thing I liked about Doppio and Diavolo was the phone bullshit, that was hilarious.  <br>Why would Dio in Joseph's body use or even know how to use the ripple?<br><br>Or do you mean Joseph reviving as a vamp and then going straizo at the end?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Dio is Joseph's body <br><br>What a masterful ruse, Josephposter.</br></br></br></br>  Gay priest is here now  <br>Young JoJos can't meet. It's a taboo concept.</br>  <br>Your fault for posting here faggot</br>  I've been powering through Part V for what feels like forever now. I'm finally at the Diavolo fight.<br><br>What the fuck is going on? Araki did a really poor job of properly conveying King Crimson's power and how GER reacts to it. I know the translation is bad, but I should at least be able to get the gist of it from the illustrations. That's sort of the whole point of a graphic novel.</br></br>  I don't have a link to the DBS subs, but the anon that is translating RoF just finished translating part 3!<br><br>Find them here: http://pastebin.com/tGPsm6nx</br></br>  1st for sub anon is absolutely based. <br><br>So keen to watch this shit you mad dog</br></br>  Thanks you guys!

Obviously Sub&gt;Dub always.<br>Also the voice for Freeza Goku and Vegeta are pretty good and fitting, even more than the english dub if you ask me.<br>Here's the trailer for the spanish dub release on cinemas in case you want to see what you're in for: https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=cD8<wbr>Vv5bdmbI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> Obviously Sub&gt;Dub always. <br><br>Nah nigga, Latin DBZ &gt; Jap shit</br></br></br>  <br>spanish (latinamerica) has always been one of the best dubs around.</br>    <br>That's just nostalgia talking man, I enjoy the dub too, but let's not be delusional.</br>  <br>damn the narrator is getting old</br>  <br>Objectively wrong man, I grew up on the English dub, never bothered with the Spanish dub until I went to visit some family in Mehico, and some of my cousins were watching DBZ.

This saga will be like 12 episodes long.</br></br>  <br>Theres no episode on the 26th?</br>  <br>nope, no episode that week</br>  <br>uwutm8</br>  <br>Wasn't there GT shit in Xenoverse?<br><br>Or is it canon because of "muh alternate universe" bullshit?</br></br></br>  <br><br> Pilaf is still fucking shit up <br><br>YES<br><br>THIS PLEASES MY DICK</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Trunks said the GT shit was an alternate universe in GT</br>  <br><br><br>I'm so fucking conflicted. I love them right now, but at the same time I feel soemthing is off.<br><br>These two are my faves, but at the same time it worries me they won't get to do shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>in xenoverse*</br>  <br> Where is the continuation of my dream? Look for the Super Saiyan God! <br>Movie events confirmed<br><br>But from what I am gathering from these episodes, it looks like they are turning like, the first like 30 minutes of the movie into 3 episodes</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's only the rest of the guys fighting beerus then Goku fighting him again. So like 2 or 3 more eps.</br>  <br>So like 6 eps each for the movies? It ain't too bad?</br>  <br>Before the guys fight him again, there's those scenes trying to keep Beerus entertained not to mention Pilaf and crew fucking things up so that could easily be two episodes. And I'll be damned if they don't extend the party fight, at least the Vegeta bit.<br><br>I would bet that they will make BoG run for the Summer anime season</br></br></br>  <br>could be good<br> make the BoG fights longer <br> give RoF more story </br></br></br>  <br>Oh that's cool. I was wrong then.</br>  I just want a timeline where Gohan is not fucked up this much. <br> Hell, whole damn dragonball would be tons more enjoyable if the side characters stayed relevant too. </br>  <br> vai ser melhor que o big show sic </br>  <br> subbing RoF <br>This movie is already on teathers where i live<br><br><br> hue </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quick question, where did those titles come from?</br>  <br> implying we won't be seeing even more of the secondary characters in this silver age of fun dragon ball </br>  <br> I want a bean! Let's have it! <br> I want the magic stick! Now I want total power! </br></br>  <br>I really really would love to be in a recording session for this dub. Just to watch.<br><br>Somebody actually thought this was good, the 90s really were crazy</br></br></br>  JUST A REMINDER THAT NEXT EPISODE IS GOING TO BE KING KAI LEARNING TO DRIVE<br><br>PREPARE FOR THE BEST EPISODE OF THE SEASON</br></br>  <br> seeing <br>yeah we will see them how the job again</br></br>  <br> calling an amazing site that has high quality anime and downloads trash  <br>Shiné</br></br>  <br><br> Aim for the Dragonballs! Pilaf's big plan! <br><br>ADULT MAI CONFIRMED</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the only characters who even can job are Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Boo.</br>  <br>You forgot they were aiming for the Dragonballs during the movie, which is why they were there so they may be kids already</br>  <br><br>If we're extending the movies then they'll probably do a flashback of the time they were turned to kids. At least I hope so because their scenes in RoF with the dragon balls were fun.</br></br>  <br>Wait, isn't BOG some years after Buu Saga? And doesn't Super start 6months after Buu? So we gettin a timeskip already???</br>  <br>Movie 'canon' is already broken by Beerus being awake now anyway.</br>  <br><br>They probably stay as kids.</br></br>  <br> http://gogoanime.tv/dragon-ball-sup<wbr>er-episode-1</wbr> <br>Here you go faggots</br></br>  <br>BoG was originally 4 years after Boo. <br><br>Super is six months so the timeline's shifted</br></br></br>  <br>but why</br>  <br>And it fucking works. Honestly, people calling him a hack for retconning so much shit is laughable when he literally makes shit up as he goes.</br>  <br>Vegeta begrudgingly going an a family trip will be one of the very peaks of the dragon ball franchise</br>   ITT   <br> Being three days late and thinking everybody hasn't already watched it </br>  <br><br> peaks <br><br>You sly fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>you'd be surprised how many dumb fucks on /a/ have no idea where to actually find anime.</br>  <br> Doesn't matter, she's a voice actor. <br>All english VA's are voice actors? Does that make Sub = Dub?</br></br>  <br> Pan will go super Saiyan in the womb </br>  <br>King Kai already knows how to drive, you doofus.</br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>708749</wbr> <br> Beerus-sama <br> Not lord beerus <br>Yeah <br>good subs<br>Honorifics works fine if the setting is in Japan, but otherwise you cut out the filth for fuck sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>filthy gaijin<br>honorifics are always the best choice</br></br>  <br> Boo-san <br>No<br>Can't even spell his name right.<br>Stop linking horrible shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ is one person </br>  <br>no not /a/<br>you<br>At what point did I imply the whole board?</br></br></br>  <br> implying I am one person. </br>  <br> Part 2 in the paste bin doesn't actually have subs. It's just some time stamps and then nothing. What am I doing wrong? </br>  I really hope Piccolo remains badass and wrecks a main baddy<br>Even better if he becomes the strongest at some point, even if temporarily</br>  Now this is what I call proper characterization. There's no way Gohan can be dumb reading a book with a title like that  <br>Go complain to the group page then. They are the same people who subbed Kai and are probably the only ones that will actually stick with the project after the first couple of weeks. http://the-moonlighters.ml/</br>    <br>does the subtitles for the second part show up as just numbers for anybody else or is that just me</br>  <br>Boo is how it's really spelled. It's a direct portmanteau of the characters-&gt;song for Bibidi-Babidi-Boo. Nothing wrong with Buu either but Boo is not wrong.</br>  <br> if the setting is in Japan <br><br>fake china works too</br></br></br>    No variance in line widths <br>  Neo Anime shading <br>  Non-existent highlights <br><br>I don't like how anime looks right now.</br></br></br></br>  Manga chapter 2 when  Dub when?  <br> you'll never be smart enough to read THE Difficult Book </br>  <br>it could have been much worse</br>  <br>Yeah I really wish there was a scenario where goku is unable to fight the guy/ somewhere else. I'd like to see a big bad guy get defeated by Piccolo and the rest of the Z fighters actually working together.</br>  <br> do you really want Mexican tier quality dub <br>The Mexican dub of DB is pretty much universally recognized as top 3. People will just scramble around the MX, US and JP positions but anyone who has watched several dubs will come to this conclusion.</br></br>  <br>fixed for you<br> http://www.mediafire.com/download/c<wbr>r4qv6magty342t/RoF+Subtitles2fix.sr<wbr>t</wbr></wbr> </br></br>   mfw it wasn't terrible <br><br>Well shit</br></br>  <br><br>I hope we see these three again</br></br>  <br> mfw <br>no face<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>August? Why the fuck you niggas get the movies so late?</br>  What forgotten thing is more likely to come back first in Super, Launch or the nameless background animal people?  <br>How could someone do this and think its good?</br>  <br><br>Animal People, I guess.<br><br>By the way, I remember that episode, it was after he befriended the "InoShikaChou", right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the Konkichi episode. It was called something something Papaya Island.</br>  <br>Chances are neither.</br>  Threadly reminder that the Big Green Dub is not the worst Dragonball-related thing.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dZ1<wbr>NcxAZUYk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  will super have at least 5~6 super-animated episodes like the ss omega s1 or the typical precure season?  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Upy<wbr>2SEnP9MU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> King Kai </br>  I was really hesitant about this but that was pretty damn good.  <br>Okay, that was pretty fucking shitty, but not just because of the voice acting. It was fucking silly on its own, and the ending was mad gay.</br>  <br> all instances of saiyan were replaced with space warrior and all instaces of piccolo were replaced with big green <br><br>HAHAHA. UK = cuck nation.</br></br></br>  <br>Only for the movies.<br>TV series was a mix of Ocean and Funimation.</br></br>  I love how the movies tried to add stupid shit like false super saiyan.  <br>Bio Broly a worst.</br>  <br>The Spanish dub used this opening during Frieza's saga. They also used Super Warrior, Hyper Warrior and Mega Warrior instead of using Super Saiyan.<br>It's pretty bad since they used different terms whenever they felt like it.</br></br>  Why is it that every dub seems like they did Tree of Might?<br><br>Like, was it that great?</br></br>  Is this kid still canon?  Dumb ass question, but do you think Mira, Towa and Supreme Kai of Time would somehow be mentioned in Super? Kind of hope not.  <br>Well, in the manga, atleast in the german translation, they call it Super Saiya-jin, Ultra Saiya-jin and Mega Saiya-jin, and only mention the SSJ2 and SSJ3 thing on the side. Felt like Ultra and Mega were more offical than 2 and 3.</br>  <br>Yes, Super takes place before the last time skip after Buu is defeated.</br>   mfw Mr Satan's voice   <br> mfw Gohan and Videl didn't even finish High School. </br>  <br>Yes.<br><br><br>But GT Uub is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan was probably in his Senior year as he was 17-18 by the Boo saga</br>  <br>Is it the same seiyuu? I asked in the thread yesterday and nobody replied.</br>    So whats the best way to watch the dragon ball series? or is it better to read it?  <br>the pacing is better in the manga</br>  <br>Fucking Vegeta.<br><br>At least all the embarrasment and all the hits on his pride are well deserved.</br></br></br>   Beerus literally kills billions of people, worse than Freeza <br> Goku's still his mate <br>Why is Goku so shit</br></br>  <br>goku wanted to befriend frieza too but frieza is kind of a dick</br>  <br>Do you think if he was pals with Frieza he would've let him go around blowing up planets for a laugh?</br>  <br><br> tfw we will never get to see Goku trying to help Freeza become a good guy <br> tfw we will never see the crazy hijinks that would happen because of this </br></br></br>  <br>Is Freeza a christfag?</br>  <br> Tfw Dragon Ball's Jesus Christ will never come down from Heaven and smash Beerus' wicked skull in <br>Jesus is real in Dragon Ball anyway because they invoke Christ against the Vampire that one time and it worked.</br></br>  Doc is here now. I prescribe a double dosage for all of you.  <br>It would be really funny if there's an alternate universe where Goku somehow befriends every single major DBZ villain. Him and Raditz hang out and go fishing together all the time; his relationship with Vegeta is prettymuch the same (maybe Nappa hangs out with Mr Satan); Frieza becomes a benevolent space king and visits every once in a while to say hi and bring space gifts; Cell embraces his Saiyan heritage and trains with Goku and Vegeta regularly to try and be the strongest; Buu/Uub are the same.</br>  <br>No idea, but it feels weird hearing Freeza say that<br>maybe he started believing after he spent so long in hell...<br><br>oh my god<br><br><br>I really want this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how generals work anon</br>  <br>BoG confirmed for 4 and 5. Shit, that gets the movies out of the way a lot faster than I thought.</br>  <br> This will never happen </br>  <br>If Toriyama is involved this time, definitely animal people. He remembers those a lot more than Launch.</br>  <br>He looked like a nigger in GT so no. The Indian kid will be back though.</br>  <br>I replied to you but you must have went to sleep. Yes, it's Unsho Ishizuka. For fucks sake check the website.</br>  <br> Freeza leads a space crusade to purge Constantinople of kebab </br>  <br><br>Hes calling himself god</br></br>  <br>But that's Beerus' job. He destroys without discrimination because he's a God of Destruction, unlike the selfish tyrant Freeza.</br>  <br>But Beerus does discriminate. If their food is tasty enough, he spares the planet.</br>  <br> Without discrimination <br>But that's not true, he's bribed with food. Hopefully Goku works out hard enough so that he can cave in his skull in future.</br></br>  <br>bardock chuckling as he dies</br>  Iconic anime scenes  I'm not going to read through this thread but I assume this hasn't been posted yet.  <br>I don't remember any really obviously iconic scenes in DBZ</br>  <br> I'm not going to read through this thread <br><br>hello reddit</br></br></br>  <br>here you go<br/></br>    You wouldn't fuck a loli vampire that lived in your shadow.

Drawfags can be creative with this request.</br>  <br>As someone who's learned about the 3D pipeline, the amount of work needed for a good looking model eclipses what's being made in this thread.

The point is to have as little abstraction as possible, not copy someone else's abstraction. <br>Unless you do photo-realistic rendering but that would be a bit too much work I think.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah I assumed as much.

He's a teenage boy regularly in close proximity with attractive women. The only thing holding him back was fear, and he decided he would fear nothing. Just think what would happen if he didn't fear the consequences of his actions.</br>  <br><br><br>So this answer  is correct? Why does  want to make it sound like it was wrong?</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is a token of my gratitude, no please, it's just a thank you.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> if he didn't fear the consequences of his actions. <br>Sensei created beast then.</br></br>  <br>Indeed she did.</br>  <br>Fuck you, you made me cry</br>  <br><br>Question, can't a translation, just conveniently pop up out of nowhere with no attachment to any names, and give Spyro complete deniability on responsibility for the unofficial translations?<br><br>He needn't be so readily visible, or centrally located for his translation operations for Yen Press to home in on him.<br><br>We can just use pastebins and make redundant copies of the translations to ensure YP doesn't erase everything he's worked for, or in the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How soon until Yen Press goes bankrupt.<br><br>They don't have unlimited translators and pile up their LN backlog and do shitty rush jobs yet continue buying up licenses and somehow expect /a/ to still be alive in 2020 much less interested in material that already ended.</br></br></br>  <br>That depends if he wants to. I'm sure if he asked someone would set him up with a VPN or a proxy server in Chile or something.</br>  <br>SAO and LH are selling like hotcakes, and they're very pleased with those sales according to what they said at the AX panel so not anytime soon.</br>  <br>I wonder how good YP reputation in Japan. What was their first ever license? How did it sell?</br>  <br> I wonder how good YP reputation in Japan <br>Why would Japan care about YP?</br></br>  <br>You need a good portofolio to convince them. Getting license ain't easy on the first place. So i just wondering.</br>  <br>They can just hog those titles and cockblock other Western publisher. They're slowly turning LN market into monopoly. Not that there's decent competitors for them, anyway.</br>  <br>Haruhi and S&amp;W sales probably</br>  <br>So what you're saying is that we should all invest in Yen Press for serious payouts?</br>  <br><br>I somehow am not convinced that this is true.</br></br>  <br>As long as they get money, they don't care about what happens to the series outside Japan. And it doesn't help that there aren't any competitors to YP at all</br>  <br>Anything could happen but the anmie covered everything.<br><br>We're all in the dark until Watari releases Volume 12.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, they won't move a single bit. Just like Funi and their shitty encoding, you'll be stuck forever with official translation never.</br>  For what it's worth, I've never seen YP drop a series before. They've already caught up to the latest Haruhi novel, well it was a while ago actually. They're almost done with S&amp;W with the final volume coming out Spring 2016. I think we're fine especially since Oregairu probably won't be that long anyways. For series like Index though I would be a bit worried.  <br>The problem is that we'd be waiting years for something we expected in the next couple of months at most</br>  <br>Reported to Yen Press,<br>I hope they sue him.</br></br>  <br>BASED SPYRO</br>  <br>sent letter to Yen Press</br>  <br>So. When will vol 1 Yahari YP gonna be published?</br>  <br>Not exactly hard to catch up with Haruhi with its long hiatuses</br>  Anyone has the episode 8 full of "I don't understand" stitches?  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br><br>I don't get it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Tokyo Pop hogged LN licenses too that never materialized.<br><br>Also, that obscure company that actually licensed Hidan no Aria never released Volume 1 and never mentioned it again but still holds the license.<br><br>Seriously, Americans are scum.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> LH <br>Whats that? Log Horizon?</br></br>  <br> And he recommend great mango too. <br><br>Can't find it. Castle of Dandelion or whatever.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, that obscure company that actually licensed Hidan no Aria never released Volume 1 and never mentioned it again but still holds the license. <br>Probably YN give pressure to them. You don't want anymore competitor in the market.</br></br>  <br>Which is retarded since the American market system is completely based around the idea of competition. <br><br>I was hoping that another Light Novel company would finally be able to beat into Yen Press' skull that including something as simple as honorifics wouldn't make the books any less "accessible" to the average reader. <br><br>But at this point Senpai is probably going to be reduced to some shitty localization that takes away all the significance that came with it. The Persona 4 localization didn't treat us like idiots, wish Yen Press would do us the same courtesy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not retarded. If the company owns the rights then no other company can profit on it.<br><br>Companies aren't there to suck your dick, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>You know what I am mad about?<br>Zaregoto v3 to v9 never.</br></br>  <br><br> the American market system is completely based around the idea of competition.  <br><br>You'd be surprised.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723830 <br>because LNs are shit</br>  <br>yeah</br>  Can somebody translate this one page?<br><br>That's all i need to summed up whole volume 11.</br></br>  <br>Not really since I'm actually a marketing major (sorry for the minor blog), so I'm pretty used to the shitiness of certain business practices by now. Thing is that monopolies are allowed to exist in certain circumstances, but the idea of competition is still upheld by the vast majority of the market. Having one company handle the product is just asking for trouble. <br><br>Yen Press is pretty much the only place to go for Light Novels in English at the moment. And while their quality isn't bad for the most part, if they massively screw up a series by hiring a bad translator (like No Game, No Life for example), then you're pretty much screwed as a reader since there won't be any other alternatives except reading moon. Which has too high of an opportunity cost for many people.<br><br><br> It's not retarded. If the company owns the rights then no other company can profit on it <br><br>What the fuck are you even talking about? Nice job stating the obvious twat, of course a company that doesn't hold the IP won't get any profit from it. The point is that multiple companies in the same market fosters better products for the consumer overall. If X company does a shitty job at translating a certain Light Novel, and Y company gets a better reception by doing something differently (like say including honorifics). then X company is likely to pick up that practice in order to improve their sales. <br><br>And yes, companies are there to suck the customers dick. That's the whole bloody point or else they would make any money you retard. <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127723830 <br>The only reason he started in the first place was because Yahari was the only series that sparked his interest enough to start translating. He legit started doing it on a whim for the most part, and continued at his own expense. <br><br>I'm pretty sure once Yahari is over he won't bother translating any other series.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they wouldn't make any money <br>Goddammit, there was nothing wrong with that auto-correct.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad. Yen Press won't get to Volume 12 until 2019 or so.</br>  Based Spyro.<br>Saving Yaharis since 2013.</br>  <br> too high of an opportunity cost for many people. <br><br>Why is learning a language an opportunity cost?<br><br>Surely time spent doing that is more productive than playing vidya or watching anime.<br><br>I'm also interested to hear the opinion of a marketing specialist.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because everyone already busy finding a cure for cancer or something. Why would they burden themselves in doing something else more costly in their spare time when they can just relax and have an animay?</br>  <br> Why is learning a language an opportunity cost? <br>I'm generalizing a tad, since opportunity cost in general really depends on the person's own idea of what's worth their time or not. But in general learning antoher language could be considered an opportunity cost simply because of the large amount of time you have to spend on it.<br><br>In this case context is extremely important, if you were to say be learning another language so that you can be more efficient in your job that means interacting with people on an international level. Then it could very well be considered an investment of sorts, and thus the opportunity cost isn't all that much since you are doing so in a way that will make up for that lost time in your workplace.<br><br>In this case you're largely using your free-time solely to access more content to read in your free-time. While nothing is necessarily lost in that amount of time, there isn't anything really being gained. You're not learning Japanese to do anything to make up that time, you're doing it only to be able to watch/read Japanese entertainment that you would normally be unable to.<br><br>Which is perfectly fine of course, nothing wrong with that. But the usage of that free-time is still an opportunity cost (not in monetary form obviously) since you could have probably used that time to consume more media rather than investing your time to learn the language instead. Plus there's the risk that you could become frustrated and give-up in the middle of learning, which would mean you lost a lot of your free time for nothing in the end.<br><br>Very subjective for the most part, but I consider learning Japanese to be an opportunity cost for that reason alone honestly. While the sunk cost fallacy is something to bear in mind, it's hard to justify all that time spent if you end up giving up on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spyro seems like a cool guy but he clearly bites more than he could chew.<br><br>I guess it doesn't matter since most of you guys don't care about translation quality though</br></br>  <br>YP's impending releases' quality is a dice roll anyway so this evens out in the end.</br>  <br>I thought you fags were saying that his translation is biased anyway.</br>  <br> https://d.maxfile.ro/jhqpamzkep.we<wbr>bm</wbr> <br>What song is that?</br></br>  <br><br><br>So do you learn Japanese yourself?<br><br>On a side note,  since you are marketing major, you got touch on economic a bit right? What is the best source/book on understanding modern economy and investment? </br></br></br></br></br>  Can anyone explain episode 8?  <br>It was Yukino haters<br><br>Seriously though Spyro is quite autistic even when translating, which result in great quality. Since he's one man team, some imperfection is inevitable.</br></br></br>  <br>  8man want to understand <br>  8man hates talking <br>  Yui said it's impossible to understand without talking <br>  8man know he's delusional <br>  he still wanted the genuine* <br><br>* do note that even 8man can't really define it, but most points learn toward complete honesty, for good or for ill, instead of preserving shallow and superficial bonds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What was Yukinon being unfair about?</br></br>  <br>The election<br><br>Yukino still butthurt about it, and Yui told her it's her fault for not telling them about what she wanted properly.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How did Yui know, Yukinon told her? But judging from the reaction, Yukino is just butthurt that they didn't understand her wish. Student council president is something she would like to have, but not necessary needed, am I correct?</br></br>  <br>not just the election. The club atmosphere soured after the Kyoto trip and both Yui and Hikki kept it in a stagnant state by trying to smooth things over by pretending nothing was wrong. Yukino kept quiet about it since she thought they didn't want to address the issue.</br>  <br> Student council president is something she would like to have, but not necessary needed, am I correct? <br>Exactly<br><br>Yukinon was butthurt that Hachiman removed the necessity factor, and Yukinon is too autistic to realize that yes, she actually wanted the position for real.<br><br>What Yukino did was a bitch move, but not entirely hard to understand. Plus, Hachiman is an asshole for not following Komachi's suggestion to talk with Yui and Yukino properly.<br><br>Of course, Yui pretending that nothing happened didn't help at all. No one is innocent in that conflict.<br><br><br>That too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, I don't really have any need to since I'm specializing in digital marketing, so English is all I need to know for the most part (but getting used to Indian accents are definitely a thing). The only languages I'm fluent in are English and my native language.<br><br>As for the books, well it depends on whether you want to learn about micro or macro more. Then there's the fact that the majority of books on economics are really dry textbooks.<br><br>If you want just a basic overview then I highly recommend Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science. The book talks about the market, and the pros and cons of government interventions, and how not to fuck up an investment. Pretty good read, and definitely easier on your brain than the textbooks.<br><br><br>It's not really biased in the traditional sense. It's just there is a real possibility of him misinterpreting the importance of certain scenes simply because he wasn't paying as much attention to them as he would to a Yukino scene. Like the Yui scene where it was pretty much an indirect confession of sorts.<br><br>It's not malicious bias, but it is still considered bias nonetheless.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  WHEN THE FUCK DO THEY ANNOUNCE THE MOVIE?  <br> American market system is completely based around the idea of competition. <br>Not really there is actually a really large monopoly in the NA especially when it comes to Internet Service Providers and Mobile Operators.</br></br>  Like, the license is appreciated, but the timing of it sucked. Fans are most hyped about it now, with S2 having just passed. Apparently to Yen Press, cashing in is more important than being considerate to the people (or person, in this case) who contributed to creating the demand for it.  <br> Internet Service Providers and Mobile Operators. <br>Ah yes, the dreaded ISP war.</br></br>  If Hikki didn't stomp down Yui's suggestion at the end of vol 11 what did Yui expect would happen? Forcing a non-genuine relationship between everyone was not really going to do anything but prevent severe emotional pain of rejection. Did she think that her and Yukino were just going to fall out of love with him?  <br>Once again, monopolies are actually allowed in certain circumstances. In the case of American internet and telephone providers there's this thing called a Natural Monopoly. I'm not going into the specifics, but this kind of monopoly is allowed on a local level due to the fact that if done otherwise it could end up being a clusterfuck infrastructure wise. <br><br>In the case of Internet Service Providers and them being a bunch of twats. Well technically speaking that shit shouldn't be allowed, but because of a loophole in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which ironically was supposed to prevent monopolies, let them do that shit. <br><br>That recent thing with the FCC helped a bit, but there's still a long way to go before that particular situation gets more reasonable. The internet and how it should be distrusted is still a huge gray area in economics since it is largely uncharted territory. And unfortunately I don't know that much on how it is handled, since I'm a marketing guy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where do I find the pdf collection?</br>  <br>She knew Hikky would stop her, she just forced the outcome to come faster</br>  <br><br>Thanks for the recommendation. Also sometimes I wonder do the Indians really speaks English? (Glad that you are used to it.) On the other hand, I can understand (mostly) what Russians try to convey even with their bizarre vocab and grammar.<br><br>Did Spyro go back and correct the part he was biased about?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Over here in the EU such monopolies don't exist, wherever you are in the country you are free to choose from any ISP or Mobile Network that exists. And thus there is actual true competition between such companies over here.</br>  <br>mega:#F!GRkyET7Z!YLFw2JE0pC6OTd3CAw<wbr>VwkQ<br><br>Does anyone have 10.5 PDF? I can't find any with google-san</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>What about his IRC?<br>Can't find it in his about page.</br></br>  <br> Did Spyro go back and correct the part he was biased about? <br>The fuck is this bias meme? It's not even a mistake, commie just find a slightly better translation.</br></br>  <br>If it changed the meaning of things this much, then it might as well be called bias</br>  <br>That's an impressive collection. Thank you, anon.</br>  <br>I decide to import all that shit to my account.</br>  <br><br>Oh, and thank you pdf anon.</br></br>  <br>She knew that 8man will stop her.<br>She knew.</br></br>  <br>No problem anon, and last I checked he fixed it after the episode involving that particular scene aired. Apparently he wasn't aware of the ambiguous wording (once again, likely because he doesn't pay much attention to Yui scenes as much as he does Yukino's), and Commies translation motivated him to fix it.<br><br><br>EU is overall better than the American economic policies in my honest opinion. Though I only say that since I'm a very "consumer first" type of guy. In America people tend to treat businesses more like people than they treat actual people, which is really fucking strange. <br><br>Though the EU has it's own share of issues, but that's mostly a government problem rather than an economic problem for the most part. <br><br><br>I'm not talking about bias in the way the Yukino haters use it as a buzzword. I'm talking more in the unintentional, but nonetheless existing bias that may colour the way he translates certain scenes. <br><br>Once again, using the Yui scene as an example. While Commie found a better translation, that was because of the visual aid of the anime. When Spyro was first translating the scene it's very likely he overlooked it because he simply didn't pay as much attention to it as he would a Yukino scene.<br><br>It isn't intentional bias on his part, but just something inherent to a shipper. He has his eagle eyes on searching for more meaning in a scene if it's one that holds more of his interest (I.E a Yukino scene).<br><br><br>Last I checked no. There was one anon a while back who said he'd make a PDF of it, but we haven't heard from him since.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Iroha &gt; YY<br><br>Debate me</br></br>  <br><br>Did she knew 100% deep down? It seemed like she was prepared for her proposal to work. <br><br>I am just wondering what she thought would actually happen if her proposal worked. Did she really think she would stop being in love with him?</br></br></br></br>    <br>there is some .epub file in mediafire folder though</br>  <br>I respectfully disagree.</br>  I don't care if Iroha doesn't win. I just want to see some well drawn doujins featuring her.  <br>No</br>  <br>You have to always have a plan B, I'm sure she knew he would reject the proposal. But given that he did not, she would win the 8man, and just delay the inevitable "go help yourself, faget<br>" Yukino development.</br></br>  <br>It's all a matter of personal preference</br>  <br> Did she think that her and Yukino were just going to fall out of love with him? <br>at that point she probably noticed Yukino's feelings for 8man and got scared at the possibility of NTR and Club Drama so she suggested to keep the way things are. To avoid somebody getting hurt. Desperate times calls for desperate measures i guess.</br></br>  <br>Specifically Yui requested that they maintain the status quo until someone wins the sensei-bet and let the winner be chosen that way.</br>  <br> got scared at the possibility of NTR <br>Shame, would have been awesome to see it in Yahari properly</br></br>  <br>Your taste =<br><br>My Taste =</br></br></br>  I want Hachiman to touch Yui's yahallos  <br> gives her chocolate to 8man directly, making it extremely obvious that she made it specifically for him <br> respectful enough not to give it in front of the other girls <br>I concur, I'll throw my support into this as well. Though I don't really have anything against YY.<br><br><br><br>Has there ever been a series where the girls didn't give a fuck about each others feelings? Because I feel like every series has the classic "I want them to be happy" or "let's have a fair contest!" go at it, but never have them actually spite one another for it. <br><br>Real life romantic conflicts rarely go that smoothly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want Hachiman to insert his shaft into Yukino's womanhole.</br>  <br> Yui's yahallos <br> not Yui's yuis </br></br>  <br>He would have to it against her will though.<br><br><br><br>So Yui had no intention of falling out of love with him?<br><br>It was a cowardly move she pulled, it is like she trusted 8man not to agree to it. I can see why she could be considered unfair. <br><br>She looks so happy that he stopped it though</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   There were people yesterday doubting Sypro     <br>But that's Hayato' job m8</br>  <br>I would love a series where the girls actually don't give a shit about the other one and just go full force for the guy.<br><br>Also, the guy needs to not be a beta pushover but hopefully not full alpha-cunt either.</br></br></br>  <br>White Album 2 says hi, literally what you are describing there.</br>  <br> She looks so happy that he stopped it though <br>IMO it was more akin to her feeling relief. 8man basically telling her that whatever happens happens</br></br>  <br>Nothing against YY either, but Iroha is better definitely</br>  <br><br> Tobe and the rest aren't just gonna pop in and go "Gotcha", are they... <br> What are you saying, you live here Hikki. <br><br>Everytime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I downloaded it but kind of just added it to my backlog thinking it'd be some sort of True Tears bullshit </br>  <br> Even after 10.000 years later Noefags still mad. </br>  <br> True Tears bullshit <br>There's going to be tears alright, depends on whether or not you enjoy the taste of them or you end up drowning in them. But there will be tears.<br><br><br>I kind of wonder how much would have changed if Iroha was introduced early on. I bet some of the more lackluster volumes would have been much more bearable if that were the case. <br><br>Then again part of Iroha's appeal is the fact that she is great even as a late character. <br><br><br> thinking Noefag asspain is the longest running <br>You should check out Pokemon shipping spots, makes all this waifuwar shit in these threads seem like a nice calm tea party in comparision.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yahari Ore is like White Album Lite.</br>    <br/>  <br><br>So who's the true winner in that anime? Setsuna or Touma?</br></br>  <br>Watch and find out.<br>It's part of the ride.</br></br>  <br>Touma's butt hurts</br>  <br>I don't know how the hell you remain unspoiled till now (especially when 90% of WA2 threads open with the same screencap) but do yourself a favor and just watch it.</br>  <br><br>  last I checked he fixed it after the episode involving that particular scene aired. <br><br>in the epub too?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I already watch it.<br>I just didn't understand the ending. The MC true love is Touma but she became too autistic and fled to another country because muh dream. <br>And in the ending credit, Setsuna is hugging the faggot MC in the back, refusing to leave him although he doesn't love her.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly</br>  <br><br> Pokemon <br> shipping <br><br>What the fuck are they doing?</br></br></br></br></br>  Who would take the rejection worse between Yui and Yukino? <br><br>I think Yui would, she has invested so much into her romance with him she would be destroyed by a direct rejection.</br></br>  <br>is he not in brazil?</br>  <br>Based. <br>Now where the fuck is the last part of chapter 1</br></br>  <br>In the VN:<br> Setsuna won the hardest <br> Touma won the corniest </br></br></br>  <br>It's like poetry.</br>  <br>More importantly: which girl's rejection will wound 8man the hardest? Yukino or Yui?</br>  <br>Touma won, but choose her dream over her love. Setsuna choose to keep loving Haruki regardless and that's how it ends.<br><br>Now we wait for CC&amp;CODA VN translation or anime adaptation or learn moon. So we can get the rest of the story. But since it's a VN the two girls all have their winning endings anyways.<br><br>Detailed CC&amp;Coda Summary here for now:<br>http://mdzanime.me/2013/12/29/white<wbr>-album-2-concluding-chapter-coda-ro<wbr>ugh-summary/<br>Enjoy.</br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently the newest season is causing the Tumblr/Deviantart nutballs to go berserk. And it's bloody glorious. <br><br>The golden stuff usually gets posted whenever there are those occasional pokemon threads, so if you browse the archives you should fine them pretty easily. My favorite is the one where that one delusional Misty shipper made it their headcanon that the new girl was some sort of Yandere stalker. Pretty great for a quick laugh.</br></br></br>  <br>I am a Yuifag,<br>does it make me a Setsunafag by default?</br></br>  <br>Yes. Better than being a Toumafag.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>No,  but I am Yuifag as well as Setsuna fag </br>  <br> http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/<wbr>wiki/Shipping</wbr> <br>Have you seriously not seen them? You haven't seen a true shipping war till you've seen a Pokemon shipping war.</br></br>  What is the archetype of the girls in WA2?  I have a feeling this will end in platonic love  <br>Nice girl and autistic girl.</br>  <br>There don't really fit into standard archetypes like that but I guess:<br>Setsuna is normal nice girl, Touma would be closest to a kuudere.</br></br>  <br>Best girl<br><br><br>Worst girl</br></br></br></br>  Slutsuna a shit  <br>Setsuna - School Idol but is secretly a dork outside school<br>Touma - Icy bro character, teaches MC how to play guitar and stuff<br><br>Both are much more likable than double YY</br></br></br></br>  <br> Both are much more likable than double YY <br>Incorrect</br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't want to look at them. Shows like this is tolerable with shipping since at least the girls is interested in the guy, albeit sometimes really vaguely. Shows like Infinite Stratos the shipping is the main business as the show is base around it too.<br><br>But Pokemon? Like really? I haven't watch it in ages but isn't it about trainers training their Pokemon and fighting together with their Pokemon? Why shipping is a thing in such a show?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Shows like this <br><br>By that I mean Yahari.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Tomato Sauce goes around with different girls every season or more, doing Pokemon things. It's only natural you'd end up pairing him with your favorite girl.</br>  <br>Every season Ash is with a different girl<br>Of course shippers are gonna ship, and in Pokemon they take it to a whole new level because of how long the seasons are.</br></br>  At least pokemon shippers are better than avatar shippers. Now those people are wastes of space.  <br><br><br>Pokemon got seasons? That's news to me. If Ash is with a different girl every season, then there is even less reason for a shipping war. No matter how hard you ship, the girl is not coming back.</br></br></br>  <br> No matter how hard you ship, the girl is not coming back. <br>Err, anon that's the problem<br><br>Shipping war happens BECAUSE the girls always come back for one arc or two.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Different region: different season<br>The girls do come back occasionally, that's when the fanbase goes ballistic</br></br>  <br>Sometimes previous girls get camoes or episodes where they cross paths with.</br>  <br>But they come back, for specials, and when shit happens and what not.<br><br><br><br><br> girl comes back <br> flirts with boy <br> current season girl goes tsun <br> cue the horrors of pokemon shipping <br><br>Same if current girl is too close to ash and previous girl makes a comment about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Can't they just, like, train their Pokemon or something? The only girl I remember from it is Misty, and that's the time they travel together with Brock. Their relationship is ABSOLUTELY not romantic at all.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You go a boy and a girl traveling across the globe solo, camping out together and practically spending their daily lives together. How do you not ship?</br>  <br>Yes they train their pokemon<br>But there are some moments where there are subtle romantic hints that you wouldn't even notice as a kid<br>Not to mention shippers will always ship even when it's hopeless, that's why pokefags have the longest and hardest waiifu wars</br></br></br>  <br><br>Hence the Brock. Didn't he following Ash all along?<br><br><br><br>Well, kinda true. I didn't notice yaoi undertone in CCS when I was young too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Broke was always Nurse/Police woman chaser, he was never a problem in the pairing. He was a sideman.</br>  <br>Brock was barely relevant in his time with Ash, and there were arcs when he leaves to do something and Ash is alone with the girl for 20~ episodes</br>  <br><br><br>Hmm... so the show itself also encourage shipping. I never noticed it and moved on when after I grow up. It is hard to understand shippers war anyway, Pokemon or not.</br></br></br>    <br>I want Haruno to do this in front of Yukino</br>  <br>I want Haruno to do that to me.</br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>I want Iroha to do that in front of Haruno</br>  <br>I want Megumi to do that in front of Iroha</br>  <br><br>I want Hayato to do that infront of Ebina.</br></br>  <br>I want Yukino's car to do this in front of Yui's dog.</br>  <br>I want to do that to Iroha in front of Komachi</br>  Tobe is Iroha's osananajimi  <br>I want Yumiko to do that in front of YY.</br>  Thread is dead  <br>I want thread to do that in front of dead</br>  <br>Spyro is ded</br>  <br>I get the feeling that Yahari fans have some sort of saliva fetish.</br>    Since it's tanabata, let's see what our main　cast wished for!<br>Hachiman: I want something genuine...<br>Iroha: Senpai&lt;3 I want to go to a hot spring<br>Yukino: I want to go to Destinyland<br>Yui: Yukinon doesn't just like cats, but likes giant pandas as well!!<br><br>How was that even a wish, Yui?<br>But Irohasu you're just as sly as ever.<br>いろはすあざとい</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When didn't Yukino let him kiss her?</br>  <br> against her will </br>  <br>I meant why rather than when.<br><br><br>I never said that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Does Yukino like 8man?

Can someone assure me of this?  I thought Yui would stop crushing on 8man as the story went by. But that isn't what happened, she fell in love with him even harder. It is deep love at this point.  <br>It's 100% friendship.<br><br>She's just confused since she has never had a genuine friendship.</br></br></br>  <br>Two shits.</br>  <br>She attracted to him platonically<br>I bet she even wants to kiss him platonically</br></br>  <br>Nah, see the difference?</br>  <br>Would she want him to coat her womb with his seed platonically</br>  <br>She even wants to raise his children platonically and after living a happy and fulfilled platonic life with him, she would die platonically in his arms</br>  <br>Yui only likes Hikki as a friend.

Literally nothing got resolved.</br>  <br>Did you expect the series to resolve itself 1-2 volumes before the ending IE the actual resolution?</br>  <br><br> implying animes aren't used to advertise the source material <br><br>want a resolution? buy vol12 when it comes out</br></br></br></br>  <br> buy vol12 when it comes out <br>Who knows when will that be.<br><br>Isn't Wateri supposed to chum out side volumes with every BD volume?</br></br></br></br>  Happy birthday to the best oneesan~  <br>Nigga that ain't even the best onee-san in the series.</br>  <br>Buy le LN</br>  <br>It's just a cliffhanger until the Movie.<br><br> Gekijouban: Yahari Ore no Kouhai Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru </br></br></br>  <br>It's a  recap movie </br>  <br>No, it's  live action with movie original ending </br>    <br>Bai bai Hikki</br>    <br>N-no</br>  <br><br>christ</br></br>  <br>Is that a guy</br>    <br>What is that collar...</br>  <br> Iroha: Senpai&lt;3 I want to go to a hot spring <br>Fucking hell, just take her there 8man.</br></br>    <br>Why is Watari dressed as Yui?</br>  <br><br><br>いろはす～</br></br></br>    スカーフ はす～  <br>Woah</br>  I just finished the series, Yui seems to be the best girl but Yukinon is great too.<br>Is the triangle relationship the only good option?</br>  <br>it demonstrates that he is now her property.</br>  <br> But she never put that in her mouth. <br>You have no idea.</br></br>    <br>8man loves Komachi the most</br>  <br>Well, the problem is  8man seems to like/adore one girl and getting close to her as a figure/person but he's also loving and trying to get over his trauma in order to cross the line with another girl. </br>  he has yet to:<br><br> give yui's "someday" <br> take responsibility for iroha <br> help yukino <br><br>how's that gonna fit in 1 volume?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He did help Yukino</br></br>  <br>He's going to ignore all of them and fug sensei</br>  <br>I like to imagine that Yukino is the one saying "No" in that picture.</br>  <br>I think the aquarium date was Yui's someday.<br><br>Taking responsibility for Iroha is an ongoing thing.<br><br>Yukino's was about to make a request at the end of the last volume.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i seriously don't get that part, she almost accepts yui's proposition if 8 man didnt stop it then says "don't tell me how i feel" at the end</br>  <br>He is going to take Yui on another 1 on 1 date because he has a code of honor. Not sure what other role she will play if 12 is the final Volume<br><br>Iroha...yeah I dunno how relevant she is going to be<br><br>Yukino is going to be relevant until the series concludes since everything pretty much revolves around her character</br></br></br></br></br>   OTP <br>I remind them.<br><br>Also a gift to Spyro.</br></br></br>  <br>She was going to accept so she doesn't end up getting hurt, 8man basically tells her to wake up and face reality.</br>  So now that we know what's going on with Yukino, a lot of the earlier scenes with Yukino can be seen in a different light<br><br>Basically what has happened is that Yukino has surrendered to Hachiman's way of thinking in the early episodes. We see her at the beginning and she has all the ideals about improving yourself, helping others, changing the world, etc. What she really wants though is to improve herself. Meanwhile Hachiman believes it's pointless to change yourself or the world. His solutions always sidestep personal improvement and rely on manipulation or understanding social situations to get out of problems. <br><br>Yukino watches this and sees how Hachiman's way of thinking produces better results again and again. It gradually wears down her resolve. What is ironic is that as she's becoming closer to Hachiman's original way of thinking, he is getting closer to her original way of thinking. He no longer rejects change or self improvement.<br><br>Anyway I think in the next volume Yukino's family is going to intervene to try and separate Yukino from the service club and Hachiman in particular. Yukimom would have several reasons for wanting that. Aside from whatever hopes she might have for Hayama/Yukino, she is never going to accept Yukino having feelings for some middle school loser with rotten eyes and little prospects. Plus she can point to how Hachiman seems to have 'ruined' Yukino even further. Whatever feeble improvement she had shown has been wiped out and she's as bad as she's ever been now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah I know, but if their main goal is to find genuine why was she even lying there at the end. It's basically in similar character to "I was just pretending to be retarded posts"</br>  <br>http://i.imgur.com/9uUftqR.gif</br>  <br>No I will remind everyone</br>  <br>As expected of a TL who has the best girl as his waifu. There is a God and his name is Spyro.</br>  <br><br>Her "don't tell me how I feel" to Yui is her trying to save face I think. She was about to accept Yui's proposal, Hachiman intervened and shamed her basically, now she's backtracking.</br></br>  <br><br> give Yui "someday" <br>This will be the chapter where the 8bowl is decided.<br><br> take responsibility for iroha <br>Ongoing, as per  but not really a factor going forward.<br><br> help yukino <br>Already "helped" her at the aquarium, plus it's the central plot of 12</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just how Yukino is, she's dishonest about herself so she puts up a front of overconfidence.</br>  Can someone explain to me why Yukino was fine with Hachiman's social suicides in season 1 but she just changes her viewpoint on it in season 2? She was even fine with how he fucked Sagami verbally. Did she just fell for him right then and she cared a lot more? Or was it something else?    <br> he fucked Sagami <br>Yukino NTR fetish confirmed, 8man is secretly fucking Haruno</br></br>  <br>It wasn't shown well in the anime I think, but basically the Sagami case WAS the turning point; that brought a lot of grief crashing down on 8man's head, unlike their prior cases.</br>  <br><br>I think it gradually happened. Once it became something that he was going to make a routine of her hostility to it increased in proportion to how much she cared about him.<br><br>There are other factors than just the 'self suicide' though. With the fake confession, it made her reexamine what she thought was their shared hostility to insincere relationships.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>YY weren't there in person for the sagami scene, the fake confession was the first time they got a up close look at how 8man did things. <br>It also doesn't help that they already liked him when he pull the confession stunt.</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't there, but word got out about it and practically everyone in the school had a massive hate-on for 8man for a while.</br>  <br><br> OTP <br>Wrong files, the both of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do I see a Ryuuji in 8man? Not talking about the appearance, of course.</br>  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>I always wondered, why did Yukino lean in like that?</br>  <br>I don't think the 1 on 1 date will actually happen.<br><br>8man will pester Yui because the convenience of the 3p date left him unsatisfied after he resolved to seriously try to address/humor Yui's feelings.<br><br>That's when Yui will confront him with the fact that the reason he won't let go of that date because of a sense of obligation rather than returning her feelings. This is how 8man will realize he's not being honest by tolerating/humoring Yui's feelings, instead of making it perfectly clear that he won't return them.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>0/10<br><br>Shitty, contrived, and "obligation" and "humoring" Yui very obviously has nothing to do with why he wants to go on the date.</br></br></br>  <br>The reason he feels want to go on another date is because Yukino tagged along for the aquarium one and the promise date was just between the two of them<br><br>Whatever happens beyond that no one knows</br></br></br>  <br>He literally went with the mood when he asked her out, there are no special reasons behind it.<br>But Yui tried to waste his promise on a 3p date, so he'll just give her another chance to convey her feelings properly. Her ship is most likely going to sink soon.</br></br>  <br> Suki nano <br>No answer.<br><br> pulls hand out from hers <br>Makes an excuse instead of giving his real reason.<br><br> hair grooming <br>Clearly uncomfortable the entire time.<br><br>Since becoming friends 8man has been soft on Yui's romantic advances despite not accepting them. If you actually think the promise date is our of anything other than obligation you have not been paying any attention to their interactions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Her ship is most likely going to sink soon. <br>I heard that one before. Remember when /a/ was convinced that vol 11 would sink her? Now she is in better shape than before.</br></br>  <br> He literally went with the mood when he asked her out <br>And Iroha went with the mood when she asked Hayama out.<br><br>In Yahari between "mood" being genuine and non-genuine, there is more precedent to it being non-genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>to get a closer look of the bandages she was tying</br>  <br>Not that anon, but Iroha didn't ask Hayama out solely because of the mood. The implication throughout that scene was the exact opposite, and she planned to after she started doubting her feelings due to the genuine speech.<br><br>Subtext, it is a thing to look out for anon. You can't go by what these characters say as the truth.</br></br></br>  When is the OVA coming out?<br> I wanna see Iroha win and watch the double suicide by Yui and Yuki.</br>  <br>Most thought that every ship but Yukino's would sink in volume 11. Thing is, we have at best two more volumes to go, so we can already expect shit to happen.<br>And it's not about being in better shape, it's about 8man being in love with somebody, and right now that somebody is nobody.<br>Hell, most thought that he was in love with Yukino, but that turned out to be bullshit too. Unless a girl gets a boost in romantic writing, all will sink.</br></br></br>  <br>She's basically equal to Yukino now which isnt saying much since Yuki is at her lowest point in the series and 12 is probably her "redemption" novel that also starts to tie up loose ends</br>  <br>He went with the mood because he had been thinking about stepping over the line with Yui for some time.<br> summed up his current situation with YY perfectly already.<br><br><br>Not even worth addressing since you completely misread the mood when she took his hand during the genuine scene. It had nothing to do with her feelings and everything to do with salvaging their friendship.<br><br><br>Nice job pretending that adding "genuine" to a statement makes it a legitimate argument.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> When is the OVA coming out? <br>After vol. 12 's ending sinks all the ships as 8man gets into an arranged marriage with Zaimokuza's as of yet unrevealed older sister </br></br>  Yukino and Yui are okay, right? <br><br>Iroha is the bad one, right?</br></br>  <br> He went with the mood because he had been thinking about stepping over the line with Yui for some time. <br>You are self inserting too much here. A promise is a promise and that's it.<br>A request is a request and that's also it. No girl is ahead of another because that's how Watari is writing it.</br></br></br>  <br> Not that anon, but Iroha didn't ask Hayama out solely because of the mood. <br>She outright stated she did.<br><br> The implication throughout that scene was the exact opposite, and she planned to <br>[citation needed]<br><br> she started doubting her feelings due to the genuine speech. <br>Which she outright stated is why she went with the mood.<br><br> Subtext, it is a thing to look out for anon.

He can't be that obvious.</br></br>  <br>I never suggested she was "ahead" of any others but 8man is very obviously receptive to the idea of dating Yui.</br>  <br>Didnt we get more hints of 8man liking Yukino despite all the shit that happened in the latter half of the novel</br>  <br> Not even worth addressing <br> Proceeds to only address the one he considers wrong <br><br>Based on this, one can safely conclude that you believe everything else you failed to address is correct.

It was just the denialfag being a retard and responding with [citation needed] like he always does because he can't think up of an argument other than "Iroha has no feelings for 8man".</br>  <br>Which wasn't during the valentine's conversation. You should know from the infirmary scene that every time he mentions taking a step with someone he isn't necessarily speaking romantically.</br>  <br>It feels like it was only yesterday he was posting those things <br>Time flies</br></br>  <br>I know right? The shitposting just wasn't the same without him for a while.</br>  <br>The anime aired the same thing (Yukinoshita being last in his thoughts in this monologue) <br><br>Rewatch episode 7</br></br></br>  <br> What argument? <br>The one where you got mad at being asked to source your statements and so decided to shitpost instead.</br></br>  <br>Ah, good times</br>  <br>Except the source was the scene in question itself, and he just responded to everything people said with [citation needed]. Even though it's really bloody obvious that just becuase a character said something, doesn't mean it is true. <br><br>And his usage of [citation needed] marked him out as the denialfag, hence why he is considered bait and a shitposter.<br><br>Also nice job trying to whiteknight yourself denialfag, real classy of you.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> samefagging this hard <br>Sasuga denialfag, never change.</br></br>  <br>"The scene" is not a citation. Provide quotes and explanations, those are the foundation for an argument.<br><br><br>Butthurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I haven't read it yet, but the Irohafags were beat the fuck out! She has no feelings for 8man you see. <br> I haven't read it yet <br>Oh man, no one is that dumb. I don't believe that one.<br><br> No word from him until now. Which will probably be "Just wait until volume 12!" <br>He did say shit, he said that Iroha wasn't part of the main plot and that she explicitly wanted to make chocolates for Hayama. She used him for this purpose.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Trusting a Yukinofag director's adaptation </br>  <br>it seems unbelievable but he said that his reason being that 10.5 wasn't canon</br>  <br><br><br><br>Isn't the context of the quote about the images 8man keeps of the girls in his head?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes but he emphasize Yukino's resigned smile 'above all'</br>  <br><br>I'm not sure how this is surprising, 8man still put Yukino on a pedestal all the way up to 11. First she was someone he idolized, then she was someone he had to help. Both cases he falsely elevated her importance, and it's only possibly amended now that he says she needs to solve her own problems.</br></br>  <br> Oh man, no one is that dumb. I don't believe that one. <br>I'm being completely serious though, I'm not even exaggerating he legit posted that he hadn't read the chapter yet.<br><br> He did say shit, he said that Iroha wasn't part of the main plot and that she explicitly wanted to make chocolates for Hayama. She used him for this purpose. <br>I must have missed those threads then, since I don't remember reading that line. I should really just compile a list of this shit. Good comedy to bring up every now and then.<br><br><br>Specifically he said that anything not solely about Yui and Yukino were non-canon if I recall correctly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No it's about what 8man caused, because of his methods.</br>  <br><br>I wouldn't call it 'one sided' or 'selfish'.</br></br>  <br><br>Couldn't it be the results of his actions conflicting with the images he has of those people?<br>Like, with Rumi, he probably thought she'd be fine with being alone, while she clearly isn't</br></br></br>  <br>Yukino is OTP.</br>    <br><br>Hachiman and Yukino clearly share some sort of special connection. But even as a Yukinofag I don't think it's necessarily headed to romance.</br></br>  Remember that girl called Saki?  What is Volume a?  <br>I disagree.</br>  <br> Most of all <br><br>I hope you remember this thread:<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/125379<wbr>368/</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  What is this face trying to convey?  <br>Who?</br>  <br>This isn't a motorcycle board anon, I think you're lost.</br>  <br>Redditor should fuck off.<br><br>Seriously, your post reeks of bullshit.<br>In more than 3 months period, there are at least 500 Oregairu thread has been created. And it's safe to assume that there is at least 100 posts made by Irohafags in each thread. So that mean 50.000 posts in total that you have to hide. No one is that fucking autistic.<br><br>So what does it mean? It means either you are a filthy liar, or you only visit Oregairu thread once or twice each week. Combine to your "hiding post" statement, its fucking obvious that you came from reddit.<br><br>Either way you are not belong here, get out and never come back.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    We can't go back to the day we met, can we anon? <br><br> I miss the times </br></br>  <br>I remember that "above all" spam. It was so funny I stopped visit Oregairu thread for a while.</br>  So, does sensei win in the LN?  I want the Yukinofags (aka mal/animesuki fags) to leave.  <br>Nope, only in the VN.<br><br><br> You mean "MOST OF ALL". </br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Come on now, the few that remain aren't bad.</br>  <br>Well I'll give you that the animesuki fags are Yukinofags for sure. I don't know about MAL since I avoid that place like a plague. I still use it's list feature though, but does anybody know a good alternative? I'd rather not associate with that cancer any longer.<br><br> Nice trips by the way </br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>Wanting to remember threads from when the anime was airing</br></br>  <br> Forgotting &gt; </br>  Is this really going to last for fifteen weeks straight?<br>God damn.</br>  <br>But it's fun. Animeonlyfags were cancer though</br>    <br>They will go away in a few hours. Then thread will be as slow as already dead like usual.</br>  <br>Can't understand the context, let alone the moon. Any moonreader?</br>    <br>Not moonreader but <br><br> Rumi-like childhood+Haruno bully <br> Ice cold princess <br> Hikitani patch <br> dere Yukino <br><br>Am I right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Watch the shipping bullshit start again as soon as Spyro releases the final part of chapter 1, because of Iroha and 8man's siscon stuff.</br>  <br>Not even close</br>  <br>some one still have that "siscon" webm?<br><br>I wish I could hear Iroha abusing/teasing voice more.</br></br></br>  <br>One would hope the Irohafags would already be burnt out crowing about her gimmie scenes, but we all know they aren't. Blind fanaticism knows no bounds.</br>  <br>If you want Iroha's voice just go into the Iroha nico pastebin and take your pick</br>  <br>Thing is, I'm an Irohafag and a moonfag and I never get tired of her 'gimmie' scenes.<br>Have fun tolerating those that will use it to trigger you.</br></br>  <br>What is it then?</br>  <br>I just want that particular "siscon" scene. I do remember that clip was posted several time. Maybe that anon doesn't visit Yahari thread now.</br>  <br>Last I recall album anon was compiling webms of Iroha. How is he now?</br>  <br>I have it, took it from album anon some time ago.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/lalormktlm.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>    Will Yukino lose her place among the top LN females in the 2016 contest?  Happy birthday!  <br>She says she might have fallen for anyone who saved her, and that for that reason she's glad Araragi was the one who did save her. I'd call that real love ("genuine" needs to be banned from /a/ for the next few years now).</br>  <br>She's just lonely in that big house. While cat is not loved by everyone.</br>  <br>Lurking mostly.<br><br>I knew I would find you here today.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes that's true.<br>How about emotionally frustrated then?</br></br>  <br> I knew I would find you here today. <br>Oh, you're so adorable.<br><br>Things have changed on my end, I broke my schizophrenia a couple months ago, after four years of work I broke it. Actually remembering and enjoying life for the first time. Different these days.</br></br></br></br>  Gran Torino will make a man out of you yet anon.  <br>It's only a parody if it's intentionally bad, so to speak, and makes fun of itself. Black Clover mimics what's popular nowadays, it's just another regurgitated example more for the sake of profit, not a parody.</br>    Momo is not fat.  <br>Faggots here think that anything that isn't a loli is fat</br>  <br>Honestly though, that would be such a broken power. <br><br>Fucking shitting gold, whatever.<br><br>Don't mind me, just popping a carbon fiber armor suit out of my back.</br></br></br></br></br>  See this.<br>What do?</br>  <br>Saori-chan is used goods already, so I'd agree to let Geiger have his way with her as long as I can get some too.</br>  <br/>  <br>Why didn't she fight back?</br>  <br>Context?</br>  <br>He couldn't even sink a little girl? What a fucking panzy ass faggot, he doesn't deserve to rape.</br>  ITT last anime you watched and your reaction to it<br><br> Akagami no Shirayukihime - 01 </br></br>   Monster Mosume  <br><br>not the last but Charlotte was really meh the second half</br></br>  Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann<br><br> RIP Kamina (￣^￣)ゞ </br></br>   OverLord <br><br>I'll watch the 2nd episode when it comes out just to give it a chance but episode 1 didn't really appeal to me..<br><br>None of the new series this season have really appealed to me, at least I've still got Shokugeki no Soma to look forward to every week for a while longer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're such a little girl.</br>   Go! Princess Precure 22   Lewd.  <br>honestly you can say the top 1st year students are very close to each other. Which I am okay with since it is a cooking manga.<br>Souma would've beaten Hayama by 3:2 in the qualifier.<br>Hayama had a draw with Ryou.<br>Alice and Ryou had a 50:50 past record.<br><br>We don't know where to put Erina and that's about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  what was your favorite joke in the series<br><br>mine was when the guy said shut up midget and he goes what the fuuuuuuck</br></br>  <br> 50:50 <br>Source?</br></br>  <br>Bec/a/use</br>  <br>Kuga (to Souma): I will accept your challenge if you have one thing better than me in cooking.<br>Nene: height.....</br></br></blockquote>]
