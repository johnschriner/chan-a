[ So anon, is this worth a read?<br>Apparently its not done, is it nearing completion?</br>  its good, don't expect it to finish or have a good ending  <br>It's hiatus time</br>  USE FUCKING GOOGLE.  <br>Is very good, too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. Still, is good enough for you to look past that. <br><br>Ending will be good if you like Mushashi and dislike Koshiro.<br><br>Must give the mangaka a pat on his back for not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga, jesus was the shit pretentious as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an adaptation of a novel that was pretty good, and the art is great, so yes, it is worth a read.</br>  <br> pretentious <br>Explain further.</br></br>  <br>That word gets misused time and time again.</br>  <br>That pic is so small, we can hardly see what a handsome bastard Musashi is.</br>  <br> pretentious as fuck <br><br>Jesus christ, how stupid do you have to be to find it pretentious? Nothing the characters did was close to being an affectation embodying some super deep philosophy. It was literally Thorfinn being depressed as fuck because he lost his purpose in life and wanting to do something more than senseless killing for once in his life. I can understand not liking it, or finding it boring, but it was as far from being pretentious as you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Shoving down ideals that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction, yet for that moment, is the magical solution. <br><br>And the result, the "feels" feel fake. But of course, it was directed for the mainstream Naruto audience, so majority buys it.<br><br>Well, now I´m sounding pretentious as hell for even explaining it.<br><br>tl;dr:<br>The answer for stopping the bloodshed is dumb, and I´m not buying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that would never work in the world that have been shown so far in the fiction <br>Yes, and some fools even believe than one day man will fly! Pish-posh!</br></br>  Wouldn't it be nice to have a worthy opponent?  <br>If you start, just remember when it stops that's it.. don't get your hopes up or dwell when it will finish.. it wont</br>  <br>There's always the book.</br>  <br> not making the farming arc pretentious as Vinland Saga <br>I disagree. In fact, I could have agreed with you entirely barring this fact.</br></br>  <br>Alright, so retard confirmed. Learn what the word pretentious means next time, dumbass. And congrats on completely missing the central conflict of the story. You are the naruto audience, as you've completely failed to understand the story.</br>  <br>But it's just a comic book about carrying longboats and killing people, there's nothing to understand!</br>  <br>Second only to Berserk in its genre. Definitely worth checking out. Like Berserk however, it will never be finished.</br>  <br> second only to Berserk in its genre <br>Hmm.</br></br>  <br> genre <br><br>You don't know what that word means, do you?</br></br></br>  <br>I like Vagabond more but the farming arc in Vagabond is way more pretentious than the one in Vinland Saga, even if it was shorter.</br>  <br>Epic philosophical action Seinin genre.</br>  <br> Berserk <br> philosophical </br></br>  <br> joke <br> your head </br></br>  <br>Well it does have that intro in the anime where it says something about free will.</br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL  <br>Even having been told there is a joke, I'm still missing it. Explain.</br>  <br>He's pretending to be the original dumb poster who thought Berserk and Vagabond are the same genre.</br>  <br>I concur. Real is too fucking good.</br>  It starts rather awkwardly as a 6/10 manga and then it steadily climbs to 7/10 and 8/10 and 9/10 and eventually a solid 10/10 during the peak of the action but it's followed by a period of peace and it's steadily declining over time. The character progression is good and he feels a lot mature and philosophical but it also means that there is less action, there is less travel, there is less suspense, the main character hardly fights anyone, and if you previously liked the manga for all these things then you're going to feel blueballed.<br><br>Still worth checking out I'd say.</br></br>  Is there anyone else here who has read both the manga and the original novel? Because I think that sometimes when they differed, the manga actually turned out better.  <br><br>nice art but I found the main character and antagonist boring, the side characters used for nothing but brief unfunny comedy relief scenes lame and the fights with random nobodies a chore to get through. <br><br><br>read Shigurui instead op. it has disabled swordsmen that aren't as big of faggots as kojiro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't say whether Shigurui is better than Vagabond but I can definitely say that anyone interested in a good samurai mango should check out both. They're the best of the genre.</br>  <br><br> Shigurui </br></br>  <br><br>Shigurui is fucking great. It's the first time I've gasped due to the outcome of a fight.<br>It's a shame the whole thing wasn't made as an anime.</br></br></br>  <br>It also made me cringe when people got hurt.</br>  <br>Shigurui has an anime adaptation which is still very good.</br>  For some reason I could only read this while drinking heavly, whisky preferred.<br>Never made it past after the fight with staff-kun in the woods and MC reaches some town with a dojo or something, I dont know, its been a while.<br><br>Did I stop before this so called "peak" or does it continue in its rather slow manner that builds up the good points?</br></br></br>  I'm the only one that liked the Farm arc the most out of the entire manga?  <br>I know.</br>  <br>no, vagabond is literally the most cliche and shonen structured samurai manga i know of (second to ruroni kenshin). its bad, read zamurai or something else. there are so many better samurai mangas.<br><br>i mean, vagabond was alright for a while. but it does fall apart quick when you get to the deaf guy.</br></br></br>  wonder where he got his inspiration from  <br>Second that. The best part begins once Musashi can't fight as good as he used too anymore.</br>  <br>:^)</br>  <br>to*</br>  I pray and hope everyday for ricefarmingsaga to continue  <br>naruto fangirl here, and i do like vinland because thorfinn reminds me of naruto. so dont shit on us narutofags.</br>  <br>You having a giggle there?</br>    <br> Musashi refusing the other Samurai's proposal of glory so that he can help a bunch of peasants <br> Despite the fact he's growing weaker every day, he's improving as a person and learning to understand other people and his surroundings. <br> That amount of despair when despite his efforts everything just goes wrong over and over again. <br> Old man becomming a total bro in the end and helping everybody out <br> Mushashi, who is now a walking hungry skeleton begging on his knees to the other samurai and making a deal with them so that they help that infertile land and help his friends/comrades <br><br>Pinnacle of the manga right there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want REAL to genre shift into wrasslin' instead of cripple basketball.</br>  <br> refusing <br>casca is disgusting used goods. i rather read hitman reborn.</br></br>  <br>The artist probably would die before he can finish his remaining works.</br>  <br>Pro wrestling in manga? Let's not be silly.</br>  <br>I hate both, but the farming arc in Vagabond were better written. <br><br>Mush growth in mind was realistic, growth takes time, and it doesn´t happen instantly. In Vinland it was almost comedic. I would even put it on par with Canute´s sudden personality change.<br><br>Using k-drama as milestone growth is bad writing. Hence, Vinland is worse. But I hate both, just not a fan of period pieces that´s more fiction than history.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fuck real, the mc is a doucebag without any redeeming traits. i want a follow up to slam dunk instead.</br>  <br>K-drama?</br>  <br>Shigurui was trying to be way to edgy, is like the mangaka learned the art of emo cutting.</br>  <br>Google?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>if youre in china, just use yahoo.</br>  Matahachi did nothing wrong.  <br>Most sympathetic character.</br>  <br>I think most people understood that its korean drama or so i would suspect, but who the fuck watches that shit to know what you mean by it.<br>Christ nigger.</br></br>  <br>Unless Inoue decides to continue into Musashi's later years, it will end like the movie and the book do: he gets on board the boat leaving Ganryu Island, gets vaguely sad, the boat sails off to the sunset, THE END.<br><br><br> too much glorification and ultra high romanticized view on the samurai era though. <br>It's pretty realistic actually. The samurai who don't give a shit about fighting are not a part of the story in the first place, and for the rest it was pretty much like what is shown in the manga, a wide spectrum of characters ranging from old masters who have awakened to petty murderers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do go autistic on me know. If you already know what Korean drama is, you know what was implied.</br>  <br>I have no idea what was implied, I've never seen a single Korean drama and don't know how it relates to Vinland Saga.</br>  <br>I really dont, but whatever.<br>If this is your idea of "no spoonfeeding" keep at it.</br></br>  <br>Canute's change was sudden, but Thorfinn's change was not. There was a whole year when he went mindbroken and just did hard labour so he didn't need to think about anything, and then we got Einar's arrival, budding of friendship, and then after another year (or was it 2?) of working on the farm, Thorfinn realizes his new goal in life (vinland) only through the subplot of that slave woman and her husband. I'm hardly seeing any dramatic change in Thorfinn's character throughout. It was not a case of him being depressed one day, and the next day being motivated about not using violence for no reason.</br>  <br>Nah, it panders way too much to glorious nippongo. Reading it make you want to live in that era. Shigarui would be a better representation of the sword era, dishonorable, shitty, and inglorious.</br>  <br>Reading Vagabond didn't make me want to live in that era. People get killed left and right with hardly any consequences to the killers. It's a scary time.</br>  <br><br>Tetsuya Sariwatari, writer of Tough, has started writing a wrasslin' manga if I'm not mistaken.</br></br>  <br> Tough <br>I've been meaning to pick that up, but it's so long and I don't know if I can stick to a fighting series for that long. How good is it?</br></br>  <br> edgy <br><br>there's that buzzword again.<br><br>"edginess" aside the relationship and rivalry between Gennosuke and Seigen was far more interesting to me than anything in vagabond.<br><br>I also liked how the creator didn't have a romantic view of that era or the samurai class. these where violent cunts looking out for their best interest in order to rise in their shit heap of a society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The supposed edginess of Shigurui comes from the fact that the series is unnecessarily brutal, just like the time period it depicts.</br>  <br>Do not take that literally and go full retard. It is more in the line of: Damn, this is beautiful, such a romantic age, sword, manliness, and rice growing. I would like to experience that, of course with plot armor and not getting hunted down by forest bandits for a day. And then you realize how comfy you are on that room of yours with PC and Internet.</br>  <br> It is more in the line of <br>Dude, don't go taking your personal experience and pretending everyone else shares it.</br></br>  <br>I could see yaoi doujins of them if they wasnt drawn by somebody that couldnt draw.</br>  <br>HA! no</br>  <br>Then what is worth reading? Don't be shy anon.</br>  <br>When will you learn that people do not have to put IMO after every sentence to get that across. Is the Internet lad.</br>  <br>bleach is quite good, lol, only shonen manga i like, or read gantz, that is very bloody and good.</br>  <br>Shigurui goes to extreme of complete anti-glorification and does it on purpose. It has partly true elements but its whole cannot be taken as being realistic or accurate by anyone.<br>I agree with . The time frame presented in Vagabond isn't appealing.<br><br>Compared to Shigurui, the movie Sword of Doom (partial adaptation of the novel 大菩薩峠, "Great Bodhisattva Pass") is a more accurate representation of the times (just before the Meiji era) from the point of view of a sociopath samurai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>I've only read part of Tough myself, I've been meaning to continue but other backlog priorities arose. It's pretty bizarre and not a very conventional fighting series, I remember: Bloodsport+Mortal Kombat-esque underground tournaments, mafia everywhere, borderline supernatural powers, some guys building up power and energy via sexual deprivation, strong and righteous MC who uses a super secret assassination art but doesn't kill people, some guy linked to his past because of his father, or something.<br>As for the author's other works, Dog Soldier is like dog shit, the Tough spinoff-prequel OTON is pretty good, and Igyoujin Oniwakamaru is great.<br><br>So yeah maybe give it a go and you'll see pretty quickly whether you like it or not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Both of youre wrong. Both Vag and Shi are unrealistic. One head to the extreme of showing the brutalization and ugliness of being a samurai. And the other one indulge in your desire of a romantic era. Men with dreams and ideals. <br><br>However, both should be read. As theres much enjoyment and learning to be had. Everyone should just put down their fucking fan flags.</br></br></br>  <br>After your description, I think I'll pass. I prefer martial arts stuff to be like Holyland.</br>  <br>shit taste confirmed.</br>  <br>is okay at first, then turns very very very bad with evil uncle and the fights become a super power fights.</br>  <br>Compare, though: Shigurui doesn't show a single good thing about samurai life and the samurai, while Vagabond showed many bad aspects of them even if it doesn't focus on that.</br>  So how useful is dual wielding for real?  <br>Not very unless you can actually overpower someone with one hand.</br>  <br>Did the real Musashi ever actually dual wield? I know for a fact that he would utilize his short sword if he lost his primary weapon but I don't know if he ever used them at the same time as he's commonly depicted doing.</br>  <br> not useful until you got what it takes to utilize it. like every thing ever. <br>geez, do you moonlight as sherlock?</br></br>  <br>It's more than just skill or practice. That's like herculean strength.</br>  <br>Niten Ichi-ryu, he used his second sword as a parry tool. So yes.</br>  <br>never go full retard. you are assuming he is wielding a bastard sword on both hands or what? have you ever wielded a short sword? they are quite light and can be used to swing with one hand. dualwielding can be useful. throwing your other sword or use it to block.</br>  <br>Confirmed for being scrawny.</br>  <br>Absolutely. When I picked it up I couldn't put it down. Thank God there was 300+ chapters when I started.</br>  <br>Another thing is, Musashi did not take a vow to not kill or pick up the sword again like Thorfinn did. He just simply doesn't want to murder everyone who goes against him, like when his leg was injured and drew the circles when he was recognized as was challenged, yet all small fries stepped in.</br>  I want it to finish so I could reread or own it. I mean fuck I read it years ago and it was fantastic, but now can barely remember the events.  <br>yup yup. vagabond is the better one.</br>  Fuck yeah it's worth a read and when you're done with that read Vinland Saga.  <br>The Book of Five Rings states that it's superior but only after years of dedication. You should be able to wield the long sword with one hand as if you were wielding it with two.</br>  <br>Like I said, you don't have to like Thorfinn's extreme stance, which is obviously in its early stage and is obviously going to be developed throughout the story since there ARE going to be people who want to kill him. It doesn't make it pretentious though.</br>  <br>I didn't say I don't like it, or that I find it pretentious. I just pointed a major difference out.</br>  <br>Then why on earth are you quoting me? My original post was entirely about disputing the claim that vinland saga is pretentious. I never said one thing about Vagabond.</br>  <br>Excuse me, I didn't think getting quoted on an anonymous image board would actually offend somebody.</br>  <br>Not that guy quoting you. But I have to say it. A tad pretentious, is what the Thor moment was. Would make sense if the king guy got touched by it but would not admit it. And maybe cut of one his fingers or something. They instead become buddy buddy. And now that is how they will solve conflicts from now on. Suspension of disbelief works no longer after that.</br>  <br>Again, I'm going to have to say people really need to learn what pretentious means before they use it. What you describe is the problem of realism or believablity, hence your lack of suspense of disbelief after that.<br><br>A pretentious story has nothing to do with whether or not it's believable. It means that the story's theme is pretending to be much deeper or important than it is. A good example would be if a character namedrops famous philosophers, but those philosophers nor their ideas have any relation to the story nor its themes.</br></br></br>  <br>To continue, another example of pretentiousness is to use overly convoluted metaphors, symbols, or allusions so that the author can confuse the reader into thinking that there is lots of depth in his story when there is not.<br><br>When Thor states that a warrior needs no sword, he is stating directly. He's not hiding it in fancy words, nor is Yukimura drawing confusing symbols or whatnot. It's communicated to the audience in a very direct way. That's the opposite of being pretentious.</br></br></br>  <br>But it is pretending to be deep.<br>"Killing is not the answer, violence will never solve anything". The writer is trying to shove some idealistic bs down the readers throat. Now if it turned out that something like that would not work, then okay. But the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple. That is pretentious bs.<br><br>Why are you so triggered? There are people that actually stopped liking for that crap. And not for "hurr durr no more blood and gore".</br></br></br></br>  <br> if it turned out that something like that would not work <br>And I'm 100% sure it will not work.</br></br>  <br>I'm only triggered because people like you literally have no idea what pretentious is, yet continue to use it. Perhaps excusable if english is your 2nd or 3rd language, but that doesn't seem to be the case here.<br><br>Again, the message is not pretending to be deep in any way. Pretentiousness is concerned with the delivery of a message, not the content of its message. Its simply what it is. A stance advocating pacificsm. Its no more or no less pretentious than saying something like "violence is appropriate in certain circumstances."<br><br> the writer is telling us that the solution is that simple <br><br>Except we see directly IN THE STORY, that the solution is NOT that simple. Thorfinn's belief in pacifism is being continually challenged. And even if he himself doesn't pick up a sword, he can't make other people stop fighting either. He couldn't prevent Arneis's death nor her from utterly losing hope in the world. He can't do anything about the baby's family because he knows that blood feuds are an integral part of viking culture. It's like you completely missed every plot development in the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> vinland <br> pretensious </br></br>  Viking mead&gt;sake  <br>Now that is pretentious.<br><br>I would understand if you all argued about a good manga instead of this below average shounen stuff (Shuukan Shounen Magazine). And Vagabond is okay I guess. Read Blade of Immortal instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Guiness&gt;Apple Cider&gt;Rice Sake&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Beer&gt;Viking Mead<br><br>Objective fact, Scandinavian true blood.</br></br></br>  <br> not a single piece of argument offered <br><br>Right, go on and keep misusing the word pretentious like a retard. As they say, ignorance is bliss, or is even that phrase too "pretentious" for you?</br></br></br>  So what have YOU been doing with your life?  <br> guy trying to correct another guy but instead turned into that guy. <br><br>the gaze as abyss thing seems to be true.</br></br></br>  <br>Blade of the Immortal is pretty cool guy, eh?</br>  Sorry drinker-kun, got the wrong post<br><br><br> guy trying to correct another guy but instead turned into that guy. <br><br>the gaze as abyss thing seems to be true.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, it's truly and utterly worthless arguing with idiots. I don't know why I bothered to begin with.</br>  <br>Indeed. So glad is not trying to be like Vagabond, Shigurui and Vinland Saga.</br>  <br> this fucking guy </br>  <br>Not useful. I can confirm, I'm a master swordsman.</br>  <br>Whittling your own bones to use as a weapon was way edgier than anything that ever happened in any of the three you mentioned though.</br>  <br>What's your name, kid?</br>  <br> I've no name to give... a man of your skill... <br>SO HARDBOILED!</br></br>  <br>I am now afraid to read it, because of you.<br><br>Is it his shit taste or is it also good?</br></br></br>  <br>It's not bad at all. It's just silly. I mean it's about a guy who can't be killed because he's full of worms that fix him up, like Fry in that one episode.</br>  <br>Masturbating.</br>  <br>How many times a day do you do it?</br>  <br> Sasaki Kojiro </br>  <br>Too many Kojiros.</br>  <br>I agree with this guy. It's funny how a you faggots are so averse to manga that tries to deliver a message contrary to your beliefs. Muh pretentiousness!</br>  <br>8</br>  <br>Waiting for more chapters of Vagabond.</br>  <br>I wish had the appropriate cap from Starless handy for this one.</br>  <br> Everyday until we like it </br>  <br> I agree with this guy. It's funny how a you faggots are so averse to manga that tries to deliver a message contrary to your beliefs. Muh pretentiousness! <br><br>as long as the message is interesting/original/new/ or done well is all good. after that one idiotic one chapter where thofin get punched without getting crippled i dropped it hard.</br></br></br>  <br> dropping a manga because of the manliest thing since forever <br>Wow.</br></br>  <br>All creatures are made to compete, pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak.</br>    <br>Competing does not equal murdering everybody and chasing some vague concept of honor.</br>  <br>B-but muh culturally mandated honor killings!</br>  <br>So many spooks in one post that it became terrifying.</br>  <br><br>I was going to give it a read. nvm, looks like the mc is a beta faggot.</br></br>  <br> pacifism is a defense mechanism concocted in the minds of the weak. <br><br>You have no fucking idea what you are talking about if you actually believe this. Competition and pacifism are both necessary for the continued existence of the human species.</br></br></br>  <br>All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate, this is the essence of living and every feeling and thought stems from this place.<br>Thorfinn is very good at fighting and he is an idiot for not taking advantage of that.<br><br><br>He doesn't become the main character until a fair while in. It's very good up until that point, would recommend reading it then dropping it like Thorfinn clearly was a child repeatedly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> risking your life for others and being a martyr is a way of a beta faggot. </br>  <br>I think you might have stumbled upon the best definition of a beta there is, well done.</br>  <br> every feeling and thought stems from this place <br>This is a blatant reductionism. Even some apes are not that simple.</br></br>  <br>now I know why people mention naruto in this thread. even more reason to not touch it with a billion mile long stick.</br>  <br>Every creature is that simple</br>  <br> All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate <br>No. But humans have the will to realize this simple fact and go against their instincts.</br></br>  <br>Even in viking society there was a balance to be maintained, a culture with a hierarchy too strongly defined by individual martial strength will underdevelop in many other ways. Thus it benefits all of humans in a society with a certain degree of pacifism so both strong and weak can enjoy comforts.<br><br><br>This sounds an awful lot like overcompensating, "resources and procreation" is a simply asinine oversimplification of human drive. Humans are herd animals and thus VERY much have the mental mechanisms to facilitate good cooperation within the group, e.g. empathy, inhibitions against beating/killing senselessly.<br><br>Come on, really? Altruism==nardo?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Is it the time to post hat pictures?</br></br>  This is no longer about vagabond. Everything have turned into layman-tier sophistry. Unsightly seeing a bunch of teens acting like something more.  <br>One fucking post was enough to derail the thread completely. It's marvelous.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how this "X is naruto, t. edgelord" troll is still successful, shit's been around forever.</br>  <br>That is not what I'm talking about. I meant the "thank god it's not as pretentious as Vinland"-post.</br>  <br>That is essentially on the same axis of retardation at a lesser degree. Anything that deals with "morals" in a less than objectivist fedoralevel way is reduced to either pretentious, somehow religious or for children.</br>  <br>Will and reason are slaves to emotion. The root of everything you do in your conscious mind is going to be "because i felt like it" and the root of every feeling is the desire to garner resources and reproduce.<br><br><br> This sounds an awful lot like overcompensating, "resources and procreation" is a simply asinine oversimplification of human drive <br>Show me anything not rooted in that.<br><br> Humans are herd animals and thus VERY much have the mental mechanisms to facilitate good cooperation within the group, e.g. empathy, inhibitions against beating/killing senselessly. <br>I'm not at all saying it's in every persons best interest to go on psychotic killing sprees. Humans cooperate because we gain from it. On a personal level we also do it because we believe we gain from it.<br>Thorfinn however is good at killing and not much more, he is an idiot not to take advantage of that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Readers here need to seek constant validation that they got taste that agrees with the majority. So when one of their mainstream so-so manga(s) get called it for what it actually is, they get triggered. I doubt the posters original intention was actually that though.</br>  <br>Since you acknowledge empathy and say humans are ruled by emotions, perhaps you can understand how some people are more ruled by the emotion of empathy and some less? It's fine to say that that doesn't align with YOUR distribution of emotions but don't claim that that's somehow universal.</br>  I love how suddenly everyone has become super ostentatious with their words.  <br> trying to shame me into agreeing to the hivemind when I'm anonymous <br>Don't bother. Enlightened by my intellect as I am, I understand that there will be no lasting consequences for me no matter what I say.<br>Do you understand that? There is literally nothing you can do to hurt me in any way, your opinion is completely and utterly worthless.</br></br></br>  <br>because the easiest evasion/derailment there is is to point out "hurr cant english gtfo underageb&amp;"<br><br><br>who the fuck talked about hurting? people just think what you're saying is ridiculous and that's for you to care or not care about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he already got you to reply, your inferiority complex have already subconsciously gone on full display for everyones pleasure to mock.</br>  <br> It's fine to say that that doesn't align with YOUR distribution of emotions but don't claim that that's somehow universal. <br>I don't directly feel like that, but I am convinced it is the essence of every living creature.</br></br>  <br> A kiddo trying to call out another poster while failing basic capitalization rules learned in elementary school. <br><br>How did you even manage to be worse than the guy you´re calling out?</br></br></br>  <br> ostentatious <br>Nigga, I don't even know what is the meaning of the word.<br><br> Thorfinn however is good at killing and not much more, he is an idiot not to take advantage of that. <br>You seem to miss the point completely. He is good at killing, yes. But what is good about it? He achieved nothing by killing more and more people. He couldn't stand against the Canute's army. He had no advantage in that situation. The only thing possible for him was to appeal to reason and emotions. By killing more people he simply wouldn't have suceeded.</br></br></br></br></br>  I award the fedora-thread of the year to this!  <br> spooks <br><br>Stirner is that you? On my /a/?</br></br></br>  This thread sure went into a strange place.  <br>Gutts is a beta cuck.</br>  <br>You're a funny guy and your dick is huge. Now that you got that, will you leave?</br>  <br>No, I'm dead.</br>  So is this still supposed to be a Vagabond thread, or a thread about seinen MCs growing up as humans?  <br> You seem to miss the point completely. He is good at killing, yes. But what is good about it? He achieved nothing by killing more and more people. He couldn't stand against the Canute's army. He had no advantage in that situation. The only thing possible for him was to appeal to reason and emotions. By killing more people he simply wouldn't have suceeded. <br><br>Thing is Thorfinn is a dumb guy. The guy lacks both smarts, balls and a goal in life. Let us say that his deus ex machina trick failed (as it should, but didnt because muh morale message). Everyone in the farm would get slaughtered, well, everyone that is left. What good writing would instead do, is have him apply all his years of warring around with Askeladd to counter back Cans army. Traps, guerrilla warfare and leadership. But hey, fuck good writing and let us all go the path of Naruto, path of NARUTO DATTEBAYO.<br><br>Waste of potential is what this manga is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Contrary to what you might believe, it is possible to resolve issues through talking, and this has been done in real life many times.</br>  <br>then we would not be talking about vinland, since that is a shonen shit.</br>  <br>So is this still supposed to be a Vagabond thread, or a thread about MCs growing up as humans?</br>  <br>Fuck that. All MCs should be ubermensches embracing their instincts, imposing their unstoppable will on others and inflicting as much pwnage as possible. All in all it's what humanity is about.</br>  <br>thread is about being pretentious. get with the program.</br>  What you still need to realize is the extent of implications of being herd animals. Surely humanity's first and foremost incentive and source of emotion is that of survival instinct, but for herd animals this is also applied on the group level. It follows that it's anything but against nature in extreme cases for individuals to even give their lives for the continued survival of their group. The degree differs greatly from person to person and modern society structures and groups has made it a giant clusterfuck but take family as an example. Do you care about your family, or only about making kids and money? Do you honestly just see them as another resource?  <br>You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.</br>  <br> The guy lacks both smarts, balls and a goal in life <br>Him lacking smarts is the only agreeable point in your sentence. The goal in life was literally spoken out loud by him.</br></br>  <br>no one said that, you have to stop putting your words into the other posts. ya tits, calm them.</br>  <br>At that point it was best not to fight, but to go the path of a pacifist when you're really good at fighting and have spent your whole life up to that point training to fight is completely retarded.<br><br><br>He only got through that because plot, he's not a smooth enough talker to rely on that.<br><br><br>You mean getting delusional to protect their ego.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hold on, let me open up my thesaurus. Have to check what words that havent been used yet.</br>  <br> because plot <br>Everything happens because of the plot.<br><br>How about calling Thorfinn a conscientious objector?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's either that, or a complete lack of idealistic traits of characters and acknowledgment that we're only animals and altruism is completely pointless.</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br> At that point it was best not to fight, but to go the path of a pacifist when you're really good at fighting and have spent your whole life up to that point training to fight is completely retarded <br>Why is it retarded again? Because it doesn't always work?</br></br>  <br>Jesus, you have to break your tendency of saying obvious things. No shit mate. It just was not the time nor place for it. But, hey, my plot armor can resolve anything. Guy do not have the knack for negotiations, he barely talked under all them years of killing. Again, my plot armor.</br>  Let's all calm down for a bit and take moment to appreciate the vastness of nature and how we are all insignificant.  I just finished the arc where Musashi fights the 70 dudes from Yoshioka. Holy shit man, that was such an intense fight.  <br>It's hard to do that from the indoors and particularly the basement.</br>  <br>Pal. I read the whole thread and was to spell out my mind on the subject while trying to avoid the p word. But Odin spare my soul. Dude. That was pretentious.</br>  <br>Then appreciate your inner universe.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=EIV<wbr>gSuuUTwQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br> I just finished the arc where Musashi fights the 70 dudes from Yoshioka. Holy shit man, that was such an intense fight. <br><br>avoid vinland if you like that.</br></br></br>  <br>And his emotions change m8, it's called CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. He decides there's nothing good about killing and that it will only bring more killing. Empathy is a valid, basic human emotion that you can develop or suppress like any other both in individuals and in groups.</br>  <br>I'm bad at constructing coherent speech and maybe am stupid, but I'm certainly not pretentious.</br>  <br>And everyone would love that if it was handled with good writing. Too bad, it went Naruto on our asses. Everything got solved conveniently and unrealistically. Thorfinn never got challenged on his belief. If Canute would have tested his convictions by offing Einar, and see if Thorfinn would stand by his new found ideals. Then bravo. But no, is magically resolved everything. <br><br>That is bad writing.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the last time he saw the guy he tried to kill him then got sold into slavery by him. Yes he was merciful by letting him live but still completely content having him be a slave for the rest of his life. All he knew about the guy now was that he was a ruthless conqueror and really wanted this farm.<br><br>He had no reason to believe this would work and when he saw it did he was actually surprised.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you humans are the most significant creation on earth</br>  <br> I'm bad at constructing coherent speech and maybe am stupid, but I'm certainly not pretentious. <br><br>I would say is more like you do not know how to choose your words. <br><br>Wheredoyouthinkweare-scrubs.jpeg.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>is called asspull</br>  <br>There is nothing inherently good about character development, if he lost his mind and started eating shit it would be character development. And frankly that would be better than this which might be the most tired trope in all of literature.</br>  <br> He had no reason to believe this would work and when he saw it did he was actually surprised. <br><br>As mentioned, is bad writing. Just let the pretentious-fag be.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't follow. I thought we agreed that not to fight was the best choice in that situation.<br><br>I asked why do you think pacifism is retarded in general.</br></br></br>  <br>Pacifism is not retarded in general. And it might not even be retarded under the viking age. But how it was handled in Vinland was retarded.</br>  <br>Trying to fight in that specific situation would be a bad idea but going guerrilla or just running away would be much better than going to talk with a guy you have no reason to believe will listen to you.<br><br>I don't dislike pacifism really, but it usually comes from a delusion trying to protect the ego</br></br></br>  <br> read 1 sentence, stop <br> compare pacifism with eating shit <br>I even agree that it's a generally boring development since first reading crime and punishment but please. I'm not going to debate against it being an asspull that he survived.</br></br></br>  Went into this expecting Vagabond discussion. Instead, we have pretend to be autistic-Oxford-dropsouts.<br><br>Can we all agree on the following and move on?<br><br>- Vagabond is awesome so let us discuss it<br>- Shigarui is too edgy<br>- Naruto was good untill Chunnin exam<br>- Vinland was good untill farm arc<br>- Mountain MC is awesome<br>- We stop being pretentious now</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>English is not my native language if that helps.<br><br><br> Everything got solved conveniently and unrealistically <br>I thought that is the same manga where there's horse punching, single-handedly fucking up squads of enemies unarmed and talking heads of dead fathers. But I understand your complaints. Asspulls can be infuriating, for sure. Especially if the story pretends to be somewhat down to earth.<br><br>Though what I don't understand is your particular claim that for it to be realistic everything should end as dark as possible and that Thorfinn never got challenged on his belief. He was challenged. He willfully endured the beating. Why do you think his convictions should've been tested at that time by offing Einar?<br><br>I think you're mixing your doubt of his ideals and bad writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>niggger</br>  <br>No, you're a fucking retard and all your posts in this thread have equally been retarded. And you still have no idea what pretentious means.</br>  <br> Naruto was good untill Chunnin exam <br>Compared to what? Vagabond? It has always been shit then.<br><br> Vinland was good untill farm arc <br>Yes. During the farm arc it became great.<br><br> Mountain MC is awesome <br>He's okay. But I must say that the ending is a perfect example of an asspull.  Ironically enough I'd even say that some imagery in the manga were pretentious. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i admit. first time seeing a live meltdown. stop being triggered. your reactions only breeds more bait.</br>  <br>1.<br>Compared to manga in general. It taught children world wide about friendship, about the horrors of child soldiers, the consequences of playing ninja and it had a good variety of characters. So even if you disliked the MC, there´s always the edge guy, or the smart guy or whatever floats your boat. It just drove it´s great concept to the ground by beating it´s morale like a dead horse until the horse have turned into soil. Don´t be a hipster, it was a good manga before Chunnin exam.<br><br>2. <br>Nope, it turned a chance to become great and descended into mediocrity. No, it became even worse the mediocre. Since the potential it had was matched very rarely. Is tragic, but hey, got to pander to your mainstream audience, you don´t get paid for being original. <br><br>3.<br>Well written character development. Is rare, so whenever I see it, I need to commend it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but hey, got to pander to your mainstream audience, you don´t get paid for being original <br>Mainstream audience always wanted it to be vikings doing viking things.</br></br>  <br>As in pillaging cities.</br>  <br>Berserk is very philosophical, it just can be lost amongst all the blood because it isn't as obvious.</br>  <br>It got to be blatant and IN YOUR FACE to count.</br>  <br>  fuck vagabond, I want him to work on REAL <br>Mate, he's working on REAL consistently for more than ten years - chapter every other month, volume every year. Vagabond is the series hindered by many hiatuses.</br></br>  <br>God, remembering when Naruto was about struggling within a fucked up system of child soldiers and even had themes like the powerful getting away with slavery (hyuugas) and all kinds of cool shit.<br>Then it got stupider and stupider because Kishi overfocused on friendship to the point where it was like a creepy guy chasing his ex.<br><br>Then at the end they all submit to the system of shinobi wherein children are exploited and turned into soldiers for the sake of the village's economy. 10/10 absolutely fucked it</br></br></br></br>  <br>How boring were your childhood? Did you never play Viking with your friends? Did you never read history books of the viking era as a kid? Did you watch the Viking series that started some year ago?<br><br>Can you not relate to simple escapism? You now have both my pity and sympathy. Poor sod.</br></br></br>  <br>The romantization of Musashi and his actions in the early part of the manga are torn down by the later part's message and his character growth.</br>  You know what's pretentious? This thread.  <br>What has this all to do with me? The poster I replied to said that it pandered to mainstream, which is not true.</br>  <br>Bitch, please. People do not want the same thing over and over again. Maybe at most, they could take another viking raid with Ask viking party. People wanted Thor to grow up. And he did, just in a mainstream way, for the mainstream readers. I mean the author basically went all SJ on us. Not being mainstream was if he would become a new kind of Viking leader. One that is against the king. But it went all unoriginal on us.</br>  <br>Mein nigger. The worst thing is that people have forgotten when it was good. All they remember is the trainwreck it is today.</br>  <br>You said it brother.</br>  <br> All living creatures want to garner resources and procreate, this is the essence of living and every feeling and thought stems from this place. <br>Well, there was that one guy who 2500 years ago based the world's most complete system of thought and action on the fact that not only this is true but that it is also the cause of all distress and therefore should not be embraced...</br></br>  <br>Appeal to authority is a fallacy, also<br> the world's most complete system of thought <br> 2500 years ago <br>heh..</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not appeal to authority. The implication is that saying that kind of thing as a final note is stupid because people a billion times smarter than you have thoroughly analyzed it and argued for something completely different.<br><br>I hope that you at least got who I was talking about, and why the 2500 year gap means absolutely nothing.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I'm 22 <br> haven't learned anything at all </br></br></br>  <br>Are you dying?</br>  <br>Shigurui is not edgy, Vinland is still good.</br>  <br> Shigurui is not edgy <br>It is. It's on purpose, but it is very edgy.</br></br>  <br>I really didn't feel that way though. Like, the brutality is there for an actual reason, rather than shock value, like in most other stuff that's called edgy.</br>  I know Matahachi was supposed to be the mostrealistic character, but he keeps on regressing back to his old self. Like, no actual development. At least grow up and be yourself, no matter what others think.<br><br>Meanwhile, Takezo, who was just a run of the mill savage, became refined and learnt to control his savagery and only show it in fights, improved greatly.<br><br>Reread after reread, I try and feel sympathetic towards Matahachi, but he just infuriates me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess I should have said "it does it for a purpose" instead of on purpose.<br><br><br>Well, Matahachi is weak especially in spirit. He has to get strong in order to stop being a shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Matahachi never grew up, that's the point. He was always a manchild who couldn't look out for himself on the long term.</br>  <br>But if it is done with purpose other than "to be edgy", isn't it not-edgy then? I mean, it's like, meaningful and stuff. I dunno, maybe I'm using this word wrong.</br>  <br>No wonder. He'll never change, and in the end he never rekindled his friendship with Takezo. <br><br>Unrelated, but I like how much growth Takezo went through in just 4 years. By the end of the 1 v 70 fight, he looks like he was 40, even though he was still 22-28.</br></br></br>  <br>Maturity of the spirit and harsh life in the wilderness does make for some premature aging.</br>  <br>The nipple eating wasn´t edgy? The guy making human mashed potatoes wasn´t edgy?</br>  <br>It's edgy, but the edge has a non-edgy purpose which is to show how terrible people with power, physical or otherwise, could become.<br>It's just a buzzword anyway, don't think too much about it.</br></br>  <br>I really don't think it was. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the word "edgy" is not synonymous with gruesome or brutal, is it?</br>  <br> The implication is that saying that kind of thing as a final note is stupid because people a billion times smarter than you have thoroughly analyzed it and argued for something completely different <br> It's not an appeal to authority <br><br> the 2500 year gap means absolutely nothing <br> human knowledge has gotten nowhere in 2500 years </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That occurs irl as well, strangely.</br>  <br>That's what I was referring to.</br>  <br> world's most complete system of thought and action <br>Sounds kinda biased. I assume you're talking about buddhism. Buddhism is not free from criticism.  I agree with your thinking though. </br></br>  <br>Ah, I didn't realise. You are quite insightful, anon.</br>  <br> human knowledge has gotten nowhere in 2500 years <br>Scientific? The progress is tremendous. Knowledge of thyself? There was hardly any progress on these grounds. Maybe there was even a regression of sorts.</br></br>  <br>Is more than that. At least not for me. Synonymous with the following however, unnecessary over detailed gore and brutalization just for torture porn to the point where it reaches glorification. If you know the guys other works, is his signature stamp.</br>  <br> hardly any progress <br>Don't make an ass of yourself.</br></br>  <br>So if a person is an authority, his arguments become invalid when people who are not authorities make an argument? Is that it?<br>Again, it was just to highlight that the position you claimed was stupid and invalid by was seen as the exact opposite by some others through history.<br>As for the years, again refer to the previous post.<br><br><br>Correct. Yeah I'm biased and sure it's not free from criticism, but it would be bad if it was free from it anyway. The vast range of commentaries, explanations, methods and reformulations and diverse forms of practice would probably not have happened.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*At least for me</br>  <br> there has been progress on knowledge of thyself </br>  <br>Tell me the limit of your understanding, and I will show you where to go from there.</br>  i liked the farming arc  <br>Is there a self?</br>  <br>This is good.</br>  <br>Yes. There is also an "I" and a "me".</br>  <br> So if a person is an authority, his arguments become invalid when people who are not authorities make an argument? Is that it? <br>No, to say someone's argument is invalid because they're an authority is a fallacy. Likewise, to say someone's argument is invalid because they are stupid or because someone in authority says it is, is also a fallacy.<br>You didn't actually make argument.</br></br></br>  <br>How to be good?</br>  <br>vagi farm or vini farm?</br>  <br>Read Better Angels of Our Nature, it seems we've been doing fine, just fine.</br>  <br>Matahachi and Takezo are foils of each other.<br><br>Both face troubles and hardships. Takezo looks inwards and improves himself, and thus overcomes them. He is strong is spirit, but he is also honest to himself and that is the most important thing.<br><br>Matahachi does realize he has faults, but instead of truly trying to fix them he tries to cover them up and put up a facade, saying that it will be alright because the lies he says now won't be lies when he is stronger.<br><br>Matahachi is a lot of people's most sympathetic character because he represents human failure and our sometimes perceived inability to change and improve ourselves, no matter what we do. Takezo is an ideal, someone who can truly fulfill their potential, but Matahachi is far more realistic, even if he is somewhat extreme in the other way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him, but  I like both. </br>  <br>vagabond</br>  <br>I didn't make an argument and never said I did. Others have done so in this thread and outside of it, including very intelligent people, and I just pointed that out. <br>Pointing out that intelligent people have done so isn't to imply that they must necessarily be right and the non-authority must be wrong, it's to imply that the position must be a tiny bit deeper than something that can be rekt by a 2-line post on 4chin.</br></br>  <br>Both are great in their own way.</br>  <br>the anime series is actually pretty good and captured the atmosphere brilliantly.<br><br>Yeah Shigurui is my favorite manga ever, its social criticsm aspect is also brilliant in a way.</br></br></br>  <br>So you admit you have no argument against me?</br>  In memoriam.  <br>I haven't read it, so I don't really have much to say. Though it seems like the author is very optimistic about human nature and thinks that we're getting milder and live practically in peace. My opinion differs.<br>I see yesterdays brothers and sisters kill each other for nothing and not in some forgotten-by-god place. I see radicalism uprising. I see people forgetting what is really important and sell their lives to consumerism. I see lonely souls begging for affection, while discussing chinese cartoons every day.<br>Yes, we live in a relatively safe period of time. But was this a result of a human progress or just a fad, just a reaction on two world wars and a cold one? And can you really call this peace "progress"? We are safe and we rarely feel hunger. Our lowly instincts can be satisfied. But it's not a progress of the mind. It's merely scientific one. People still suffer from the same old question "what is the meaning of all this".<br><br> And yes, this is pretentious. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> opinion differs <br>And the statistics disagree with your opinions. Everything you said is just ignorance of the bigger picture. There is no "fad", there is a trend. A continuous trend. Go read the damn book. Or listen to it.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TI_<wbr>qLJA3clM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>What statistics? Statistics of homicide? I can easily believe that he's not lying.<br>It doesn't prove that our lives and we ourselves became better.</br></br>  Here's thought: who do you personally agree with more, Musashi or Thorfinn? They both grow towards less violent ways, but in different ways and for different reasons.  <br> What statistics <br>Dude. I gave you a link to the audiobook. You could go listen to it. I don't want to start going through the book's contents.<br> It doesn't prove <br>No, the decline of homicide alone doesn't do that. And nobody claimed so.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fair enough.

Am I right?</br>  <br>I don't get what you're referring to, but if this is where we stop, that's fine by me.<br><br>At some point, sure, but that's not what the book is about.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't get what you're referring to <br>I mean there's no point in arguing because I don't really have an idea what I'm arguing against.</br></br>  <br>Well that's reasonable.</br>  <br>NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET NEVER FORGET</br>  How to be good tho?  <br>You can, or more like -- you shouldn't be good.

It makes women feel more safe and not subject of abuse  <br>It's a Chinese scanlate, don't you see?</br>  <br> no one knows how babbies are formed <br> good </br></br>  <br><br>For example, just 10 years ago in America, the best comedians could still make racial jokes, be they about Jews, blacks, Hispanics or whatnot. Now, racial humor is considered not PC and is no longer welcome on college campuses. Watch any Eddie Murphy movie from the 80s or 90s, or any Richard Pryor comedy routine. These are now considered "offensive," and therefore unfit for public consumption. No joke.<br><br>Just 10 years ago, men who thought they were women and dressed up in women's clothes were shunned by society and joked about even in polite conversation. These days, these people receive their penis-removal surgery with public tax dollars, and are featured on the covers of prominent women's magazines, referred to with female pronouns, and commended by the President for their "bravery."<br><br>Likewise, some 30 years ago, gay people were tied up to flagpoles and beaten until they were straight. They were the brunt of the best jokes and definitely considered dangerous perverts who molested children and carried HIV. These days, if you donate to a Christian charity that believes gayness can be cured through prayer, you will lose your job. The White House is decorated in the degenerate colors of the gay flag.<br><br>The thought police are stronger now than they have been since McCarthyism, except instead of promoting patriotism, they are promoting degeneracy, drug use and miscegenation. The masses haven't seem to have noticed anything has changed, though. Rachel Dolezal and Bruce Jenner are talked about on TV shows as if they might seriously be able to change their genes if they "feel black" or if they "feel womanish." <br><br>It is entirely possible that the regressive element in our society, in Orwellian fashion referred to as "progressive," could totally ruin our country to a similar extent envisioned in Shimoneta. In America, talking about sex wouldn't be taboo, but certainly any criticism of progressive-approved notions on gender, sexuality and race would be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of which... Any VNfag care to elaborate how is actually baby formed in this society? In Vitro under full anesthesia?<br><br>But where does sperm come from and are doctors performing it not in violation of the laws?</br></br></br>  <br>I've remembered how bad I was bullied for liking anime. Just 15 years ago.</br>  <br>Stop with this bullshit, women are still treated like trash, look at this<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zNO<wbr>TWjIJ58E</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Man attacks woman.

Nobody in Europe gives a shit about stuff like that, stop pretending that America is the world</br></br></br>  <br>That's common human psychology at work, anon. If it were a man, the same number of people would help because, as bystanders in a situation like that most would assume someone else is going to do something or hope that things work out by themselves when the proper authority arrives. Not every individual feels that they should step in, even when if they believe it to be the right thing to do.<br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bysta<wbr>nder_effect</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I will ignore the fact that I didn't even mention the treatment of women in my post at all and just say that even if I had, that would be a pretty bad example of how women are supposedly treated badly. With modern civil lawsuits, you can get sued for seemingly just about anything. The public has been cowed into staying out of other people's business, regardless of if it's "the right thing" to do or not.</br>  <br>You weren't bullied for liking anime, but because you were an ugly sperg.<br><br>We had two huge weaboos in class - one was on the basketball team and chill and the other wore naruto tshirts and never shut the fuck up. Only one of them was bullied, nobody gave a fuck about the other one being a weeaboo.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's actually getting better? Are you underage or do you really think that the world in the past was more "free"?</br>  <br>You Europeans have some pretty fucked up notions of white guilt. Google "Rotterham rapes." An entire police force looked the other way as Middle-eastern rape gangs raped some 1400 Aryan lolis because if they took down the rape gang gingpins, they were afraid of being accused of being racists (since there were no whites doing the raping).</br>  <br> Man attacks woman. Out of 24 people, only 4 help. <br>I wonder, how many would help if a woman attacked a man? Or a man attacked a man? Or a woman attacked a woman? My guess 0/24, 2/24 and 4/24.</br></br>  <br>Let's see. HIV is only a recent development of the sexual promiscuity revolution. Due to people not knowing how to copulate in a way that produces babies anymore, the white birthrate is plummeting in every Western nation to the point where it is becoming national policy to bring immigrants in by the boatload just to keep the economy afloat. Our countries are becoming browner and browner, and politics are shifting to favor the low class, easier-to-manipulate outsiders, instead of protecting national interests. Brown people are promoted and hired based on meeting racial quotas instead of by merit, and women are given special treatment under the auspices of gender equality and are often promoted undeservedly with a nod to the gender pay gap myth. Yeah, shit's pretty fucking bad right now.</br>  <br>I remember watching Eddie Murphy movies on over-the-air TV channels as a kid. Those were the days.</br>  <br> the white birthrate is plummeting in every Western nation to the point where it is becoming national policy to bring immigrants in by the boatload just to keep the economy afloat. <br>It has been happening since 1970s. <br> favor the low class, easier-to-manipulate outsiders, instead of protecting national interests <br>Again, nothing particularly new. <br><br> Yeah, shit's pretty fucking bad right now <br>I was talking about censorship, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It has been happening since 1970s. <br>Right around when the sexual promiscuity revolution really took off. Hmm...<br> Again, nothing particularly new.  <br>See: . And yes, it is relatively new.<br> I was talking about censorship, though. <br>Is English even your first language?

Hmm... <br>No, it's closely related to decolonization and the economic crisis of 1973. <br><br> Is English even your first language? How was that post supposed to be about censorship? <br> So it's actually getting better? Are you underage or do you really think that the world in the past was more "free"? <br>I was talking about censorship. It's not worse today than in 1970s or 1980s.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this, I would love to translate this shit some time, but I'd need RAWs for that.</br>  That's rich.

Also I really find it amusing that you see 4chan talk about what's degenerate or not as weird, but you don't see it as weird that most of the degeneracy here is posted by virgins who haven't engaged in normal sexual relation, let alone fetishes and kinky shit.</br></br>  <br>But... That was my point.</br>  <br>  yet so smart at the same time. </br>  I want /pol/ to leave.  <br>Welcome to every single thread until the show finishes airing. It's going to be hell</br>  <br>At least the show isn't promoting race-mixing.</br>  <br>Why are they even here outside of shitposting? I mean you would think that that chinese cartoons promotes everything they are against with "muh multiculturalism", "muh degeneracy", "muh aryan race" ect.</br>  <br>Japanese (aka, East Aryans) are model nationalists. They do not allow the mass importation of rapist Mexicans or Arabs into their country, they do not intermarry with other races, and they stamp out multiculturalism very effectively at every level of their society. If only Western countries could follow their lead.</br>  <br> East Aryans <br><br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA<br><br>JAPS ARE LITERALLY UGLY SHORT SUBHUMAN MONKEYS THAT STOLE OTHERS CULTURES<br><br>THERE IS NOTHING "ARYAN" ABOUT THEM</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They are Aryan in spirit.</br>  <br>And yet apple products are incredibly popular there</br>  <br><br>Too bad that marrying a chinese man is acceptable to over 90% of the population and isn't seen as weird. Korea to lesser amount (iirc 65%), just because we make jokes about how much the elevens hate koreans doesn't make it true. So go back to /pol/ with your "muh multiculturalism" because what you know about the elevens is wrong.</br></br>  <br>The only site I know off the top of my head for raws is raw.senmanga. The site is kinda buggy and slow though.</br>  <br>Chinese and Japanese are the same race, dumbass. It's not anywhere close to the same level as marrying a black. It would be the same sort of thing as a Frenchman marrying a German.</br>  <br>I started reading the manga and stopped cause it was just too silly. Enjoy your shit.</br>  <br>Manga-zone.org has a working link for the first tank.</br>  <br>Heteroconger hassi<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_OM<wbr>Df7Q9n04</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I have seen similar "experiment" with man attacking woman and vice versa. The woman got helped quite frequently but dude getting his shit kicked got laughed at and woman beating him got cheered up by other women. People generaly thought "he did something bad, so he deserved the beating", while woman getting beaten was "obviously" abuse.<br><br>That said the statistic sample you are working with is too small to make any good assumptions anyway (same thing with that one I mentioned) .<br><br>It isn't even that special that when someone is trying to defend abused woman in fight like that (fight within a couple), he will get attacked by "victim". Because they are gonna start to defend their partner (even the shitty one). So good luck at court because they are gonna sue the shit out of you if you are gonna even touch the abuser.<br><br>But really, that video doesn't prove or show anything at all.

Just a lot of lol so random shit and not actual translations.  <br>No, what makes jokes funny is how they were said.<br><br><br>The same things that are referred to today.

Black people have regular sized eyes. You couldn't even joke about blindfolding them with dental floos. <br><br>Q: How do you blindfold an Asian?<br>A: With dental floss!<br>It's corny, but this joke works for the exact reason that the previous joke failed. Because there's a grain of truth to the source of the humor. <br><br>Same deal with blonde jokes. Blonde women are notoriously stupid, so jokes making fun of stupid people are interchangeable with jokes making fun of blonde women and they work because there is a grain of truth to the stereotype.<br><br><br> The same things that are referred to today. That the world is controlled by the Jews, that the US is allowing illegals into the nation because they want to genocide the white race, that the banks are trying to bleed dry the citizens, that the white race was is the omnievil, etc. <br>You're a fucking idiot who has likely never even heard a racial joke in his life.

You sure showed me!</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127680901 <br> Irc brigade <br><br>That explains a lot.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm just trying to help some intolerant liberals in the thread to make sense of why free speech isn't banned <br>I'm aware. Please fuck off and do that on /pol/. You seem to think that just because a show has political undertones to it that suddenly means you're allowed to soapbox and attempt to convert people. I don't care what views you have. This isn't your blog and it isn't your political rally either.</br></br>  inb4 massive post deletion by a trigger-happy janitor and nobody knows what the fuck people were talking about earlier in the thread anymore.  <br>So, basically, you don't want people to discuss Shimoneta on /a/. Got it. <br><br>Fortunately for the rest of us, you aren't in charge of what we discuss here.</br></br></br>  <br> I'm just trying to help some intolerant liberals in the thread to make sense of why free speech isn't banned. <br><br>GO<br>SHITPOST<br>ON<br>YOUR<br>OWN<br>BOARD<br>OR <br>FUCKING /v/<br><br>THEY LOVE TO SHITPOST ABOUT THIS SHIT. WE DON'T CARE ABOUT POLITICAL ISSUES HOLY FUCKING SHIT.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>/a/ and /pol/ are the embodiment of 4chan. They both belong to all boards and all threads.</br>  Why do /pol/ faggots think it's okay when they blog?  <br> Corrupt world filled with hyper-violent gangs where women have next to no rights and are treated as property. <br> Surprised they go into prostitution <br>You can't have it both ways I'm afraid</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not talking about political issues for the sake of soapboxing. I'm talking about Shimoneta and the political issues arise naturally, SINCE IT IS A HIGHLY POLITICALLY-CHARGED ANIME.</br>  <br>Are you a fucking retard?<br><br>How is any of it /a/ related Shimoneta discussion? <br>You /pol/shitters are talking about completely unrelated trash that doesn't belong on /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Casual racism != /pol/shit<br>Fuck off back to your containment board crossboarder</br></br>  <br>Because they whine about SJWs and shit like that when they act EXACTLY the same way of the people they hate.<br>Fucking<br>hell.<br><br> I'm just trying to help some intolerant liberals </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try to use more buzzwords in your post next time. I almost understood the content of what you were trying to say.</br>    <br>Nobody cares. Fuck off.</br>  <br> &gt;How is any of it /a/ related Shimoneta discussion? <br>See:  where this is explained in detail. If you'd read that post to begin with, you wouldn't even have had to ask your question.</br></br>  <br>This was the post that started it all</br>  <br>This picture is spot-on.<br>Go whine about liberals or whatever on your own damn board and let us masturbate to anime traps.<br><br>In THIS board YOU faggots are the degenerates.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously you care, since you have become so emotionally invested in the conversation.</br>  <br>Now please show me the post where niggers or nigger IQ were mentioned in this thread and how that caused a derailing snowball effect.</br>  <br> talking about a shit post obviously made by a /pol/tard whining about gays, degenerates and black people <br><br>NOT<br>/a/<br>RELATED<br><br>WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE MODS?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck? No. The conversation started with the fact that the anime itself makes a very astute commentary on society. You would have to be blind or a young child not to see this.</br>  <br><br>They've got plenty of mods over there. More than they can handle. Maybe you should go there yourself and give them some work cleaning up your shitposts. You'd probably like it there.</br></br>  <br><br>you don't have to samefag</br></br>  <br>Screaming about liberals and political correctness gone made and how much you hate degeneracy has nothing to do with the show. You don't even bother to put it in the context of the show.<br><br>If you actually bothered to, you'd realise that the show is in a way the antithesis to /pol/, with how it's focusing on sexual liberation.<br><br>This pathetic excuse is one of the many reasons /v/ is in the state it's in now. Because the shitty mess the industry was in was used as an excuse by /pol/tards and every other armchair politician to complain about feminists and SJWs<br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127681359 <br>See </br>  Then go make your own threads on /pol/ about this. Some of us just want to discuss the fucking anime without speaking about the implications in the American 3D world.<br><br>If anything I bet most /a/nons made the link with anti-loli/pro-morality censorship laws for 2020. SJWw are not topical on /a/.</br></br>  <br>Chapter 10, not translated yet.<br><br>Also raws are on nyaa just look for it using the japanese title.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127681359 <br>This. Summerbabbys are overstaying their welcome already.</br>  <br>It's 12 episodes right?<br>Think the anime will reach that chapter?</br></br>  <br>It focuses on sexual liberation for the comedic value but it still is the embodiment of /pol/ otherwise.</br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  <br>I'm referring to the cause of the current shitstorm which could have originated from that post.<br>That being said I haven't seen the show yet and wanted to get a grasp of what /a/ is yammering about. Sounds interesting so I'm downloading it.</br></br>  <br>In unrelated news, I really want to fuck this chick while she wears the glasses.</br>  <br>Then go make your own thread on /pol. This is /a/.</br>  <br>They do accentuate her eyes.</br>  <br>Why must you announce this? Why? What do you gain?</br>  <br>Yup if they don't suddenly cut it that is.</br>  <br>Are you saying that any discussion that arises fro a show doesn't belong on /a/? Are you saying that only waifu threads belong on /a/, you fucking faggot?</br>  <br><br>Is that the main "girl" of this series? Because if so, it's dropped before it even begins.</br></br>  <br>I do get hard when I think about anons fapping.</br>  <br>Because it deals with political issues? Yeah, no. That doesn't cut it. And since when does /pol/ give a shit about the Tokyo bill? You're reaching ridiculously far to make this /pol/ related, by pretending this is about how the liberal machine is oppressing the West</br>  <br>Nope different.<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Compare their chests.</br>  <br>i love those kind of eyes.</br>  <br> This is so stupid <br>Yes it is.<br> yet so smart at the same time. <br>No it is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's only because of the Southern Democrats. From Lincoln's time to the Civil Rights Movement, Democrats had to pander to their voting bloc in the South. Once Lyndon Johnson, a Democrat, signed the Civil Rights Act into law, that entire bloc defected. They tried to form their own party but eventually ended up with the Republicans.</br>  <br> Screaming about liberals and political correctness gone made and how much you hate degeneracy has nothing to do with the show. <br><br>The show is all about political correctness gone mad though. That is its main theme.<br><br>It is true that it's also massively pro-sexual-anything while /pol/ generally isn't, but that doesn't stop the theme of thought policing from being relevant.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You're reaching ridiculously far to make this /pol/ related, by pretending this is about how the liberal machine is oppressing the West <br>Woah there body, hold your horses. I just jumped on the shitposting bandwagon, I don't even know hwat I'm shitposting about.<br> though I do believe that the liberal machine oppressing the west can draw paralels to this show. Maybe you are just autistic about people discussing what you don't want them to discuss. </br></br></br>  <br>Okay.<br>They are italian, I am italian and understand what they are saying.<br>The acting is so fucking stiff and forced that I'm surprised they actually managed to bait 4 guys.<br><br>Also "I'm 11 and I would have helped" - 200 likes.<br>Kek</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you stupid? <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gende<wbr>r_dysphoria</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>No, he's saying that /pol/ shit belongs to /pol/. You're reaching too hard. Does feeling victimized makes you feel better?</br>  <br> I'm a strong independent freedom fighter, hear me roar! <br>No /pol/, you are not entitled to control every discussion about everything that is related to politics. Some of us just want to discuss the show, we don't want to make threads discussing the threat of SJWs. How is this hard to understand?<br><br>But the whole thing can be discussed form an /a/ perspective. There's no need to bring in /pol/.</br></br></br></br>  There wasnt much to talk about the show anyways. This thread would be empty without pol  <br>If not wanting anime touching on politics to be used as an excuse for /pol/tard levels of discussion is autistic, then call me CWC</br>  <br>Is that the main "girl" of this series? Because if so, it's picked the fuck up as my AOTS before it even begins.</br>  <br>good</br>  <br>Huh, i thought i was the only one.</br>  <br> Some of us just want to discuss the show, we don't want to make threads discussing the threat of SJWs. How is this hard to understand? <br><br>Well, the main problem with that is that the "threat of SJWs" is explicitly the premise of the show. What you're asking for is like talking about Schindler's List without mentioning Nazis or Jews.</br></br></br>  <br>Then let the thread fucking die.<br><br>But maybe I should help the Overlord threads out when they slow down, by talking about MMOs like I'm on /v/ and Occulus Rift. It's KIND OF related to the show, so why not?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have dead thread like Ushio to Tora than /plo/ thread like this or gate.</br>   Retards making this about 3D <br><br>fuck off back to your GATE threads. Can't you /pol/tards leave at least one anime untouched from your bitterness and inferiority complex?</br></br>  <br> threat of SJWs <br>I think most of you don't realize what this anime is actually about.<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo<wbr>_Metropolitan_Ordinance_Regarding_t<wbr>he_Healthy_Development_of_Youths</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> That being said I haven't seen the show yet <br>I wonder how many of the people screaming about the big bad /pol/ boogeyman haven't seen the show.</br></br>  <br> "threat of SJWs" is explicitly the premise of the show <br>Do you seriously think anybody watches this show to get a political commentary? Do you understand who is the main audience of anime?</br></br>  Threads like these are what makes me thank god for recursive post hiding.  <br>/a/ has been calling normalfags out and moralfags for this type of behavior even before /pol/ was a board, what we don't do is talk about how it relates to topical American politics.</br>  Oh it seems fun now, but the Betalord MC fucking ruins it.  <br>Did you even watch the fucking show: see <br><br><br>Do you even know what type of show this is at it's core?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, better shelter your eyes and ears so your liberal brain doesn't get deprogrammed.</br>  Sick and tired of /pol/ insane ramblings.<br>Just the other day /pol/ claimed that the 4th of Jew Lie is a Jewish ploy to rally the Americans into a patriotic stupor.</br>  You think this could be Ayame in disguise?  <br> GATE threads <br>We don't want them either.</br></br>  <br>All that wrong guess work.<br>I too despise SJW and how much this society, hiding behind "muh tolerance" is censoring everything that may be considered hurtful for someone. But you know what? /pol/ is just as bad as SJWs<br><br>I watched Shimoneta for the stupid fun, not for "muh deep reflection on society".<br>Sure, first thing it made me think was 1984, and I know that with NSA-kun knocking at the doors of our every device we're much closer to that.<br>But you know what? I don't need to aimlessly discuss it in an anime thread, nor I'm interested in reading about it.<br>There's a time and place for everything, and this is not the one for /pol/ to sperg out.<br><br>Go back to your confinement board.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  /pol/ is just as bad as SJWs <br><br>B-B-B-B-B-BUT /pol/ FIGHTS AGAINST THE DEGENRATES!</br></br></br>  <br>You're wrong because you're a dumbass = logical fallacy != you're a dumbass = premise.</br>  <br>You basically denounced the message on the basis of who the messenger is. That is an ad hominem.</br>  <br>Get in line</br>  <br><br> Pure girls who get increasingly lewd <br><br>This is my fetish</br></br></br></br>  <br>lol look at all the women that just kept walking</br>  <br>Women barely fit the loose definition of "human."</br>  <br>It's like Seitokai.

Maybe this anime isn't for you.</br>  <br>This.<br><br>If someone makes a funny joke about race/religion/politics/whatever then people openly laugh at it everywhere and post it all over the internet from 4chan to tumblr and reddit.<br><br>but just saying "So what's the deal with niggers?" Is not only not funny, it makes you look as if you jumped out of the 1950s.<br><br>SJWs? They're in their corner pouting and crying like always, they aren't a new phenomenon, only the name has changed and the place where they congregate.<br><br>Make a shitty joke, get a shitty reception basically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>You are an SJW yourself. You just seem to be in denial.</br>   ctrl+f /pol/ <br> 67 results <br>Muh boogyman.</br></br>  <br>Well meme'd /v/.</br>  <br> off topic shitposting should be allowed <br>Yeah you can go back to where you came from.</br></br>  Is this anime the DanMachi of the season?  The plot is retarded.<br>How is possible for teenagers that haven't masturbated in their entire life not assaulting each others?</br>  Lewds will save the thread.  <br> off topic <br>There's that word again.</br></br>  <br> implying the thread needs saving <br>I spotted the real virginfag.</br></br>    <br>Man talking about Obama, /pol/shit, racial humour and American politics sure is relevant on an anime board in a thread talking about an ecchi show with a side of commentary on the Tokyo Bill.</br>  <br>Are you using virgin as an insult?</br>  <br>Not possible. Children will randomly hump things if they never figure out masturbation.</br>  <br>Your conversation is so low level. This is why people hate summerfags. I come to /a/ for deeper conversations than this. In the future, if you're not willing to engage other people on higher level topics, then just don't post at all. We used to tell newfags to lurk more for a reason.</br>  <br>Where exactly do you think you are?</br>  <br>Yet nobody even talks about the bainposting because any image with a mask or a big person in it is automatically approved for it.</br>  <br>  I come to /a/ for deeper conversations than this. In the future, if you're not willing to engage other people on higher level topics, then just don't post at all. </br>  <br>Ignoring /tv/ memes has always worked in the past. It's only a matter of time with cross-boarders before they slip up and post a non-anime image that we can report.</br>  <br>Quoted for truth?</br>  <br>Just ignore him. It' just bait at this point.</br>  <br>Probably not, the censorship choker doesn't match hers.</br>   come to thread to talk about the show <br> full of off topic shit <br>Goddamn it /pol/.</br></br>  <br> Hear hear. Never heard of Shizuka Ishigami before this but she just skyrocketed to the top of my list of favourite voice actresses. <br><br>She's Nikumi.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like lewd Mirai.</br>  <br> can't understand the obvious political underpinnings to Shimoneta <br>I bet you are one of those kids who think that this is just another SYD clone.</br></br>  <br><br>How old are you, anon?</br></br>  <br>Don't bring your shit into everything about your stupid ass boogeyman.<br>This a board for talking about anime and not political underpinning.</br></br>  <br>Which is why it's amazing that people try to claim democrats are the true racists and that there is no virulent racism in the republican party.</br>  <br> we have to talk about the obvious political underpinning because it TRIGGERS me <br>We do not have to talk pol everyday, anon.</br></br>  <br><br>The problem is, racial humor is incredibly easy to employ, but incredibly hard to use well.<br><br>Nowadays you have to work to get away with racial humor. Ten years ago all a dude had to do was make a funny chi-nee voice to get laughs. <br><br>I think a lot of comedians are just mad their jokes aren't landing the way they used to, they have to work harder than taking on a lisp and telling faggot jokes or using "gay" as a buzzword or doing exaggerated accents, and you're echoing their whining because you were never as funny as they were and now, at last, you truly see the reason: PC people!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This is a political anime though. It has the clearest, most blatant anti-censorship message ever. Denying it is useless.</br></br>  <br>So is the panties girl really a lewd shameless pervert or one of those "virgin who acts lewd but gets embarrassed when sexuality is actually approached" characters?</br>  <br>People are stupid.<br><br>Everyone is racist. EVERYONE. Even the people dedicating their entire lives to combating racism. <br><br>Human beings will always have a negative gut reaction to things that are different than themselves. The most blatantly obvious difference between people you will notice is race.<br><br>If you make friends with someone who is a different race, I guarantee you it's because you found similarities between the two of you that overrode the initial "fuck this guy, he's different from me" reaction. <br><br>Problem is that more often and not both racial and cultural differences go hand in hand, strengthening feelings of dissimilarity and hostility instead of weakening them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The jokes are still funny. People are just afraid to laugh. People shouldn't be afraid to laugh in a healthy society.</br></br>  <br>VA&amp;staff in kanamara fes</br>  <br>Then go make your own thread on /pol/ about it.</br>  <br>hopefully latter, I wanna see her drop spaghetti everywhere once MC makes moves on her</br>    <br>Signs seem to point to the latter  which just makes her even better </br>  <br>Are you retarded? If the literal content of an anime is a political message than discussing that message is obviously part of discussing the anime as it directly influences, for example, if the anime is good or bad. This is like saying you might discuss Anne Frank on /lit/ but without mentioning anything nazi related.</br>  <br>Can you really read through this thread and tell me that ?</br>   show about overcoming censorship <br> they beep censor every dirty word themselves <br>fail.</br></br>  <br>You can talk about political topics to do with the anime, but when you bring /pol/shit here like half of this thread which is completely unrelated to the anime at all.</br>  <br>Then how about we talk about the Tokyo Bill instead of stupid American SJW shit? /pol/ you did not create the idea of free speech, people can talk about it without you feeling entitled to take over.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Epic fail, right anon?</br>  <br> &gt;we have to talk about the obvious political underpinning because it IS INTERESTING <br>Try again.</br></br>  <br>I hope you're comfortable discussing Monster Musume on /x/, then. SAO discussions should only take place on /v/, as well, and Aohana x Kikanjuu goes on /lgbt/.</br>  <br>See</br>  <br> Then how about we talk about the Tokyo Bill instead of stupid American SJW shit? <br>Because nobody knows anything about the Tokyo Bill because it doesn't affect us. That's not how discussions work, anyway.</br></br>  <br> reaching this hard <br>If your discussion is not specifically about an anime or manga in question then why would you discuss on /a/ of all places you fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>See</br>  <br>You are really pulling for straws here.</br>  <br>The point is that we don't have to discuss thing like /pol/ would on /a/. Do people all go "ayy lmao" in Monster Musume threads?<br><br>How does that justify /pol/ shitposting?</br></br></br>  <br>My discussion is specifically about Shimoneta, but people keep telling me to go to another board because "hurrdurr /pol/ stays in /pol/," even though there are /a/ crossboarders everywhere, there's a drawfag thread on every board, there's a streaming movies thread on every board, there's a vidya thread on every board, etc., etc. But /pol/ has to stay in /pol/ because you said so.</br>  <br>/pol/ has to stay in /pol/ because that's why it was created. To contain your autism.</br>  <br> But /pol/ has to stay in /pol/ because you said so. <br>You're so fucking new.</br></br>  Tell me why this isn't the best new girl this season.  <br>No it was off topic shit posting.</br>  <br><br>I've been on stage with people who go straight to rape jokes or mocking Asian accents, and the room goes cold, and it's not because everyone's afraid to laugh, it's because they all hate that guy and how hacky and cruel and BORING his comedic choices are. When you have nothing, you go to the /b/-style shock humor, and sometimes it works on the same level a class clown yelling BUTTS! works in fifth grade, but usually it's met with "fucking really? Jews have big noses and love money? Black people love watermelons? That's your cutting edge shit, that's what you want us to pay money to see?"</br></br>  <br>Heh, these are italians. We don't have balls anymore</br>  <br><br><br>/pol/ is one of the top five largest boards on this site.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would you have me tell you lies?</br>  <br>So is /b/.</br>  <br>How new are you?<br><br>/pol/ should always stays in /pol/. /a/ is not a political board.</br></br></br>  <br>So is /a/. Your point being?</br>  Welp guess I wont be coming to these threads since it is going to be pointless it seems.<br>Still funny to see /pol/ justify their shit posting.</br>  <br>don't even bother with them. They're past the point of being fixed.</br>  <br>What's your point? Things should stay where they belong.</br>  <br>/k/ isn't an anime board, but /a/ threads are allowed there.</br>  <br>ahh so you're a reactionary dickwad, good now I can trash this opinion.</br>  I &lt;3 /pol/  <br>is that isutoshi</br>  Don't tell me girls will legitimately want the MC's D in the future? I like dystopian, elementary school humor anime.  <br>You mean threads specifically discussing anime, and not weapons?</br>  <br>And that's let you go into off topic shitposting on a differ't board ?<br><br>And that has anything to do with /pol/ in what way ?</br></br></br>  <br>There was once a board called /new/ which was like a slightly more extreme version of modern /pol/ and had been more or less invaded by stormfaggots, half of the jew hate on /pol/ is ironic but /new/ was a lot more serious so moot got rid of it.<br><br>The people form /new/ started shitposting on other boards, and at one point /int/ was basically /new/2.0. So moot created /pol/ to contain the faggotry, it's just like how /mlp/ was created. So yes, /pol/posting should stay in /pol/.</br></br></br>  <br>How do you get "reactionary" from any of that, SJW?</br>  <br>Holy shit how can you not understand the point of that post?<br><br>A board being big does not give it right to shitpost on another board with it's bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>morning /pol/</br>  <br>It's time for /a/pol/ threads in regard to Shimoneta, which is probably one of the first truly interesting political-themed anime to ever grace /a/ with her presence. This is the year of the /pol/ crossboarders.</br>  <br>Yes a managa made by him called AIKI.<br>It's good.</br></br>  I think this show is funny and good and I'm looking forward to the seeing the rest!  <br>So you've never watched TLoGH?</br>  <br>Moot isn't here anymore, sweetums.</br>  <br>That is because /a/ and /k/ like each other.<br>/a/ hates /pol/ so it wont work.</br></br>  <br>You should probably kill yourself.</br>  <br>No, but relevance does. Shimoneta gives /pol/posting relevance on /a/. Just like how gun control threads give /pol/ relevance on /k/.</br>  Actually this anime is not funny but very sad because its very close of being reality.  <br>So all rules go out the window? Not like that fag did anything while he was here anyway.</br>  <br> cum jokes the anime <br> 400 replies <br> one of the first truly interesting political-themed anime to ever grace /a/ with her presence. <br><br>christ guys fucking kill yourselves</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, your shitposting is never relevant. Fuck off.</br>  There are still people who go to /pol/? How can you stand the shithole that place has become over the years?  <br>Reported to the Southern Poverty Law Center. Expect to receive your honorary Klansman hoodie in the mail within 2-3 weeks.</br>   gone for awhile <br> thread turns to shit <br>Holy shit /pol/ this stupid amount of shitposting.<br>I think I am going to just stay away from these threads.</br></br></br>  <br> isn't able to appreciate a story about a dystopian society where SJWs have gone insane with power grabs and legislated away fun <br> has the gall to insult other people's taste <br>No, you don't.<br><br><br>We are much better off without him. All moot ever did when he meddled with the site was fuck it up completely.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Fuck off you /pol/ retards, stick to your containment board.  <br>Why do you keep saying the same thing over and over ?<br>People keep telling you to fuck off and Saying the same thing over and over does make it anymore right.</br></br>  <br>The fuck? Did you not read the OP? This was the POINT of the thread. <br><br><br>No, thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Politics to do with the anime is not shitposting. Just like how gun control politics is /k/ related.<br>Posting /pol/ bullshit is and needs to fuck off. This thread is full of shit that has nothing to do with what the anime is about. /pol/ needs to fuck off.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off /pol/.</br>  <br>I only said that twice, in response to two different posts from what appeared to be two different people. By contrast, you and a few other SJWs have been kicking and screaming about me committing suicide for ages now to no avail. You know what they say about people who do the same thing over and over again even though the outcome is the same every time, right?</br>  <br> implying this anime isn't pro-degeneracy </br>  I don't see any problem about discussing related political issues within these threads, it's much like discussing about history in Strike Witches threads. Merely posting pictures of cute anime girls is pretty sad excuse or setup for conversation anyway.   can't talk about an anime with dirty jokes because it summons /pol/ crusaders who must tell everyone how "degeneracy" is ruining America <br> while simultaneously posting on the most degenerate site based off a Japanese website where you're a click away from the most degenerate pron <br>I don't get it.</br></br>  TL note: Chinpo means shit stuck your ass hair.  <br>where is the OP did it say "/pol/ can shitpost here" ?</br>  <br>And the show is about "sexual freedom".

Yen press shutting him down is just an excuse. Saofags do the translations because they genuinely love the series irregardless of waifus.</br>  <br>So...<br>In case Spyro drops it, do we have any alternatives?<br>Maybe a group of anons could take it up and share the PDFs here?<br><br>We should see if there are any people that would be interested in that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just pray for the irohafags to translate some stuff</br></br>  <br> Because spyro is a waifufag and is rapidly losing motivation out of butthurt <br>And there's this faggot.</br></br>  <br>Best bet is for an Irohabro to step up since they seem to be the most competent fanbase. Don't think Yukinoshits or Yuifags are any good at moon or OC.</br>  <br> group of anons <br>unlikely<br><br>but the weeaboo world is large, and I'm confident that surely someone will pick up the translation. Don't expect too much about the quality, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's just a theory though.</br>  <br> he can always post his translation in his site. <br>No he can't, he'll get DMCA's and C&amp;D's all day long.<br><br>He is best off translating offline and just posting a PDF link here when he's done the chapter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter why he drops it if he does, we should prepare.</br>  <br>Considering the lame lines he posted about losing motivation after the latest chapters, it's the most likely explanation. <br><br>Otherwise if he's just burned out, he'll come back someday.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't /a/ have their own ftp?

One Peace Books is releasing a new ShieldBro volume every month starting in October. <br><br>No idea why YP is allowed to get away with their pacing.</br></br></br></br>   40 minutes <br> 6 posts <br> no Spyro translations in sight </br></br>  8man the siscon in paradise  <br><br>Or hell</br></br>  <br>He doesn't look happy at all.</br>  <br>They both abuse him verbally, calling him useless siscon and gomii-chan, while stepping on him on a daily basis</br>  <br>I so want his siscon adventures and Komachi to finally meet Iroha. Fucking Wata should release more volumes.</br>  Stay hydrated, brothers  <br>And nobody translates those volumes</br>  <br>Iroha don't abuse verbally.</br>  <br><br> komachi meets iroha <br> calls 8man gomiichan <br> iroha has similar reaction to yukino when she heard komachi shittalk him and starts using gomiichan <br><br>sasuga watari</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Gomii-chan-senpai~" <br> "Don't call me that please" </br></br>  <br><br>Nah, just 'Senpai' is already his nickname for Iroha</br></br>  <br>You can expect me to translate it if it's anything Iroha related (expecting poor quality though)</br>  Spyro is going to join YP.  <br>i never understood why they never bother hiring people that did fan translation for dirt cheap and do quick edit job and release. they do a piss poor job and take forever translating on their own.</br>  <br>Fan translators want to leave in horrifics, Yen Press doesn't want to. Conflict~</br>  <br> horrifics <br>isn't it honorifics, or is this a meme I missed?</br></br>  <br>Why not? The people who read weeaboo shit don't want it localized to sound like some American shit.</br>  <br>It's a meme you missed. Much like "You're waifu is shit".</br>  <br>but they did, often so (at least in manga section). But the translator can't help but have to obey the publisher policy.</br>  <br> horrifics </br>  <br>Now this is a meme I like</br>  <br><br>It's horrific that they don't use honorifics.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Professional translators tend to do language localisation. You just need to read a book in your language and then the same parragraf in the original language and you will see how different they are</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's like with pottery it rhymes.</br>  <br>I like honourifics because its not something that is easily translated and is an instant indicator of relationships between two people. We dont have defined social standings to the extend of senpai/kohai. Calling someone -sama, -san, -kun, -chan, etc all show extremely different relationships. <br> <br>Like in this series, youd see Iroha only calls 8man senpai whereas if you leave all honourifics out, shed have a nickname for him as senpai (or bob or however retarded they bother to translate it). Just one small instance off top of my head.</br></br></br>  <br>They are trying to make it accessible for others who aren't into Japanese media. I imagine loads would take of to YenPress social media going "wtf is this "kun" and shit.<br>Though this would be easily solvable by including a glossary in their releases.</br></br>  yahari is dead what hte fukc  <br>This is the problem, they'll change all of that to Mr/Mister/Miss/Mrs or just to the person in question name. <br>As you said you'll never accurately know the relationship between 2 characters or the subtle change when they use a more friendly honorific or drop it all together.</br></br>  Yahari threads definitely won't die for a while. Even if we somehow managed to hit page 10, somebody will bump it for the heck of it.  <br>This kills the Irohafag.</br>  <br>I've saved the thread multiple times that way<br>The only way Yahari will die is if the mods kill it</br></br>  <br>Spamming Yahari threads would only encourage mods to purge them.</br>  Don't worry, I can not translate like Spyro does word for word, but I can give summaries.  <br> save <br><br>no you just trap us here, again again agin and again....<br><br>I hope you burn in hell  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And when they do I will finally be released</br>  Iroha confirmed?<br><br>What's this yen press stuff, did they pick up the novels?</br></br>  anybody have pdfs for the volumes in case he takes it down? i'm too lazy to copy and paste from his site.  fuck those YP scumbags. How the hell i can buy the fucking translations of theirs if I'm not Western and I dont have money? and we have to wait for years for those shitheads. DAMN ITTTTTTTTT  <br>Yes, and Spyro is probably ending his translation which means we'll get shitty translations in 3-5 years.<br><br>check the last thread some anon posted a mega link</br></br></br>  Someone should make a torrent and upload it to nyaa  <br> Spyro is probably ending his translation <br><br>Why would he? All he has to do is translate shit and make torrents for each chapter or just the whole volume.</br></br></br>  <br>Here<br/></br>  <br>Don't worry, some anon will scan the YP translations for you. That's how things work since ages ago.</br>  epub<br>https://www.mediafire.com/?89du4zd7<wbr>n3hny</wbr></br>  I thought we officially moved over to /djt/  <br>This. Can we just get a torrent?</br>  <br>It's a bluff.</br>  <br>DDL is faster.</br>  <br>DDL can also get removed</br>  <br>Well, I understand the loss of motivation to some extent, but it's not that huge of a deal. I mean, the people that matter and read the current fan translation are not going to wait 7 years for the official TL of the last 2 volumes when there's a fan TL of them available already.<br><br>You TL for the faggots on 4chan and some other sites, not for the normalfags who may buy the novels and read them first time like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.<br>Is this the latest version with the fixed translation from kyakka?</br></br>  Someone please post the link for downloading volume 11 raw.<br>Please spoonfeed me!<br> My picture says otherwise! <br><br> Does 4chan captcha system has a problem? It isn't giving me captcha to solve. When I click the box, it just gets checked. </br></br></br></br>  Good Irohasu, everyone!  <br>You need motivation in order to translate for free though. What's the point of wasting your time translating a book you already read and taking the risk of getting DMCA's and C&amp;D's? <br><br>And by doing it off-line, you would spend 1-2 months of your time translating stuff just for some anons saying thanks, while others criticize your efforts by saying your TL sucks or it's biased</br></br></br>  <br>Implying Nyaa hasn't removed stuff before.</br>  <br>We've became jojofags.<br><br>Same mindless discussions, which x would you let buttfuck you, etc</br></br></br>  So do you want to continue reading fan TL or not?  <br>Aren't most of us heterosexual males though?</br>  <br>So do you want to continue reading fan TL or not?</br>  <br>Sounds familiar.</br>  I can't find 10.5 PDF in the MEGA link, anyone had it?  <br>i dont even understand how you localize shit..... like if they said it red and three times faster would they say live long and prosper or some shit?</br>  <br>Take the torrent and put it in pirate bay and kat.cr as well then.</br>  <br>Except we can "hear" when characters speak. Also, at least memesubs left "Hikky", "Yukinon" and even chose more literal approach for "suki... nano". I doubt YP will do the same.</br>  <br> even chose more literal approach for "suki... nano" <br>Watched raws, how did they handle it?</br></br>  SPYRO!<br><br>YOU CAN ALWAYS POST PDFs AND RENAME THEM AS SOMETHING.jpg AND POST IT ON YOUR BLOG UNDER SOME CONCEALED SPECIAL TITLE!<br><br>WE CAN CONVERT IT BACK TO PDF.<br><br>YEN PRESS CAN'T STOP YOU FROM POSTING IMAGES, CAN IT?<br><br>SO PLEASE!

Does that mean we'll get three integral ending?

I read some where that 4chan was originally written in PHP by Shii or some sort. Did they change it later?</br>  <br>She'll win just fine. Winning her mom and oneesan.</br>  <br><br>That's actually what you guys get from a post that ends with yen pressing inside?</br></br>  <br> his own "I'm falling in love" <br>No. There's nothing wrong with that translation.

That he was perfectly capable of solving things on his own.</br>  <br>Exactly, she was extremely desperate to keep him from doing something stupid, hell she even went so far as to suggest they break the rules using one of 8man's old suggestions of lying about the votes.</br>  <br> not caring about 8man <br><br>She doesn't even care about her first and "supposedly" BFF whose keep reaching out to her but never got reciprocated</br></br></br>  <br> last part of chapter 1 of volume 11. <br> 8man remembering Iroha's birthday and mental gymnastics never <br>This is hell</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry if it ever comes to Spyro not being able to finish Vol.11, I'll make sure to TL all Iroha scenes.<br>I wouldn't even want to imagine what Irohasu~ withdrawal is like.</br></br>  <br>I do have the right to enjoy myself ,don't I?<br>Well, With little discussion going on and an uncertainty whether the next chapter will be released or not, it seems less enjoyable.<br><br> Finally, the lid's off! </br></br></br></br>  <br>You should also translate the rest.<br>Imagine the butthurt while WW flings shit at both Yukino and Yui.</br></br>  <br> she was extremely desperate to keep him from doing something stupid <br>If he betrayed the one thing she thought they had in common and her ideal of him then why would she go through that effort?

If she cared about him before it would make sense that she doesn't care about him afterwards. <br>Because she obviously cares about him, he betrayed her expectations, she betrayed his, that alone wasn't enough for them to stop caring about one another.<br><br> It was solved, the love triangle got dissolved. <br>Genuine 2.0 just made their love for him stronger but made the love triangle less violent.<br><br> All the same, she didn't want him around. <br>She didn't want him to force himself to do something he didn't want.<br><br><br><br>Yep</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>go to /djt/ and go nowhere fast</br>  <br>That isn't a good enough reason to tell someone to fuck off, he would leave of his own free will if he wanted to. She even told him with a smile. If this was as you guys said she would look sadder.<br><br><br> the love triangle less violent <br>It was never violent to begin with. If there was still a love triangle and he gave them a go ahead on being genuine about it I would predict that there would be more hurt feelings in the short term. It would preserve long term relations though.<br><br> she obviously cares about him <br>Then she wouldn't have intentionally hurt his feelings like. He never hurt hers before.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She even told him with a smile. <br>Fucking duh, she's autistic. news at 11.<br><br>Now, I wouldn't deny that she look like a bitch while doing that, but she had damn good reason to do so. And that's why it's so sad.<br><br>Her first rejection during genuine scene OTOH, I have no fucking idea. That was incredibly petty no matter how one would spin it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is she so flustered?</br>  Yen Press is our savior  <br><br>Do people seriously browse the threads? The only thing valuable there is the pastebin.</br></br>  <br><br>Yukino rejecting Hachiman at first during genuine was because she was upset about him claiming all the blame for what happened. She understood to herself that she was at fault as well, but Hachiman was acting like everything was his doing. It was like another social suicide for him from her PoV.<br><br>  After I finished, I looked at Yukinoshita. She squeezed the fists she had on the table even harder. <br>  “So you’re saying… you’re at fault?” <br>  “…Yeah, I can’t deny it.” <br>  Directly or indirectly, my actions were the cause of everything. That was an infallible truth. Upon answering her, she quietly lowered her eyes and bit her lips. <br>  “I see…” she said, her voice resembling a sigh and lifted her face. Her eyes that were slightly moist looked at me for an instant, but were quickly averted. After taking a moment to search for the words she wanted to say, she spoke with a cold tone. <br>  “…However, if you think the responsibility is yours and only yours alone, isn’t it something you ought to solve on your own?” <br><br>It's like Hachiman/Yukino interactions the entire series have to be viewed as these two loners struggling to reach out to each other on a level beyond words and failing. But they get closer every time they do it. They both assume things about each other and then judge them when they don't live up to that. They expect things from each other and act like they don't have to really talk to each other, but get disappointed anyway when it turns out that they do need to.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I am starting to suspect that Yukino is in love with 8man. In EP 12 she responded to Orimoto, she seemed very concerned with what 8man thought about Hayama and her, she acted like a dorky high school girl in front of her crush. In EP 13 she really wanted to give him chocolates but froze up, she reacted to the penguins, she seemed to really hate the idea of a forced friendship with Yui and 8man, and the way she acted to Yui giving him cookies made it look like it hurt her.<br><br>Reading her memorandum made me think of the questions A) why was she so focused on genuine and B) what could make her that embarrassed while smiling? I could be interpreting this wrong and it is 100% about friendship.</br></br>  <br>It's confirmed for being 100% friendship.<br><br>She's just confused because she doesn't know better, and has never had a genuine relationship (heads up; friendships are relationships as well you fucktards) with anyone.</br></br></br>  <br> 100% friendship <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br> It's confirmed for being 100% friendship. <br>There you go<br><br> not trusting your anon-sempai </br></br></br></br>  <br>The day I trust you fuckers is the day I die. You guys are the biggest lot of distasteful human beings on the internet.</br>  Who else didn't see the love triangle coming?  <br>Only you, Ooka, and Yamato, Tobe.</br>  <br> She even told him with a smile. If this was as you guys said she would look sadder. <br>8man already knows her smiles at that time were fake.<br><br> Then she wouldn't have intentionally hurt his feelings like. He never hurt hers before. <br>She had to hurt him so he would stop doing retarded shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice meme reply to a meme post</br>  <br>What do you mean anon? Didn't you see the infirmary scene? That was the meaning of platonic friendship right there</br>  <br>yeah I didn't.  I thought it was a harem for sure. </br>  <br>If that was friendship then why was she eye raping Yui's Hikki? <br><br><br>Iroha (big maybe) and Saki like him so it is technically one but they are so far behind it is funny that some people consider them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> That isn't a good enough reason to tell someone to fuck off, he would leave of his own free will if he wanted to. She even told him with a smile. If this was as you guys said she would look sadder. <br>You believe her smiles?</br></br>  <br> Yui's Hikki <br>Holy top kek, you surely mean Iroha's senpai, right?</br></br>  <br> Yui's Hikki  <br><br> implying she not allowed to rape her own man </br></br></br>  <br> you surely mean Iroha's senpai, right? <br>Not him but that's technically correct.</br></br>  <br>But more manga expressions makes her more intriguing. Also please, have you seen Megumi's LN illustrations?

Then she swallows her pride and accepts that given her current level, she is nowhere near strong enough to even pose as a minor threat to a full powered Teru, but someone else on the table:  Satoha  She then resolves to serve as support and give that person the opportunity to strike Teru down a couple of pegs. <br><br>This would show Yuuki's development as a character throughout the series. For someone who always fights in a cocky way and blindly follows orders, this would highlight her growth both in mahjong skill and personality. Yuuki would have had to take a crash course in humility and accept that her opponents are out of her league. Whilst her taking the backseat and coordinating with the other players will show that Yuuki is finally thinking for herself and weighing options for optimal results. It's a huge jump from her days of "MY LUCK AND RESOLVE WILL CARRY ME D'JEY xD!!"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or Fate 4:<br>Kiyosumi loses the semifinals and goes to the beach.<br>Meanwhile, Naruka shows her true powers and trashes Teru.</br></br></br>  <br>Yuuki will probably end up being the crucial linchpin that will give Satoha the right moment to score a critical hit off Whu-Whu-Wee Teru.</br>  <br>Go home Maya.<br><br>You're drunk. Your fucking captain worships Pagans. I'm surprised your team hasn't been stoned for heresy yet.</br></br></br>  Considering that Yuuki will be first East, if Teru is North then Yuuki will take the Subara role of ponning to skip Teru's turns. That should work well with her increasingly speedy style. <br><br>Of course, Teru's mirror might just be able to negate any pre-planned strategy like that. The perfect coaching tactic would be to instill the seeds of the counterplan in the vanguard's mind, so that they will discover the plan during the match. Teru's mirror might not be able to stop that.</br></br>  Whose idles are those   /ai/ idle activities   ?

You don't even know what's coming.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Did anything even happen in KD before the last 3 or 4 episodes? </br>  <br>Yeah I think I slightly overestimated things. Some part of me expected him to be competant.</br>  <br><br> Did anything even happen in KD before the last 3 or 4 episodes? <br><br>I think that's when they got more serious for the Decostone search, for a liberal definition of 'serious' in a very not-serious show. The final cour was full happening though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's an anon. Of course he's not competent.</br>  <br>Shush don't ruin his expectations of KD.</br>  Would it be asking too much of BNP to get another drama episode with all the girls fighting?

What else do we have this season?<br><br> Show about perverts being taken down by the decency police and all their goods getting burned. <br><br>Well, at least they're keeping it interesting?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean, non /ai/ shows? I don't follow.</br>  <br>Symphogear is something for everyone and if you haven't watched it you're missing out. SOMETIMES, there are excellent shows for Not-little girls.</br>  <br>I'm not sure it's suitable for a little girl such as myself, but I'll give it a go.</br>  <br><br> Show about perverts being taken down by the decency police and all their goods getting burned <br><br>So, modern day England?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's certainly not suitable for little girls.

They really wish to be like us white people and our inverted knees.</br></br>  With which one would you Du-Du-Wa Do It?  <br>Akari, then Sumire, then Akari.</br>  ah yes, a cup ramen tree. Of course.<br> I guess they're doing the whole character episode thing for now if this is Yellow/Sapphie's episode </br>  <br><br>It's a magical tree, nigga. All the ingredients in cup ramen can be found in nature so it makes sense for the tree to be magical-genetically modified to make it.</br></br>  <br>She speaks closer to a ninja than a commoner from Kansai, which makes sense. As for Kokone, I'm not sure Kobe has as strong a dialect.</br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7uV<wbr>GI8GKY3Q</wbr>  [ ]  <br>Sumire,all day long,every day of the year,every day of my life.</br>  Oh no    This new ending, holy fuck.  <br>Is there a clean version of this yet? I need the rest of the ED without the credits.</br>  <br>Feelchair when no Mikan gf to accidentally eat your intestines.</br>  <br>There's something really wrong with this artist.</br>  Please do a beach episode, Sunrise.  <br>Sumire and Akari at the same time.</br>   Seira became a Gatchaman.   <br>I haven't watched the first ep yet, but is she voiced by Ishihara?  Her voice makes my dick diamonds </br>  <br> Check wiki <br> Ishihara Kaori <br>Fuck, hurry up Cthuko.</br></br></br>  I don't like her VA at all. <br> &gt;lalalaaaaaaaa~ </br>  <br>I almost hate to admit this, but part of what made me watch Aikatsu was Ishihara. I'd been interested in starting /ai/ anime for a while but it was her that sold me.</br>  <br>Yeah I was happy to hear her voice again in the recent episode with the DreAcas. It's just something about it's genkiness.</br>  <br>Those are some nice Dreams.</br>  <br>Is the same VA when she sing? They sound very different.</br>  <br>No, Furi does Aoi and Seira.</br>  <br>Nah, Aikatsu have different singing VA's.</br>  <br>Her voice is pretty much the only thing about her that I like</br>  I love both Mikan and Lala.  I can't get Fuwari's song out of my head. It's so happy and cute. I hate her manager though.  Ded, like Scum-senpai... It feels like its been forever since he last did an inspection...  <br>I'll inspect you, Yayoi-chan.</br>    <br>Oh, my heart!!!</br>  <br>My heart belongs only to senpai.</br>  <br>How about your vagina?</br>  <br>That's something only a bad guy would ask. You're a bad guy.</br>  <br>Thank goodness Aromageddon and Fuwari were exempt from the lewdness of the new ED.</br>  <br>But girls love bad guy, right?</br>  Pshuu has transcended PriPara and entered other anime.  Why did the PriPara ED suddenly become so lewd? It's a show for little girls, and big friends liked it even before it became lewd.  Jesus christ Pink, I'm pretty sure this is illegal.  <br>Ah you're descending into the madness.</br>  <br>I kinda felt that way, too. It was shocking like, why would they feel the need to go so extreme? But after watching the ED a few more times, it's not really THAT lewd except for a few shots, like the 2 of Mirei and 1 of Sophie.</br>  <br>Pink is a massive slut.</br>  <br><br>Someone post the image with all of Pink's outfits.</br></br>    <br>The newspaper dress is the sexiest one.</br>  <br>Thanks. I wonder if anyone has done this for other JP girls with more than one outfit.</br>  I'm currently watching Rainbow Live and loving it, but I want my next /ai/ series to be a Jewelpet one. Is KiraDeco a good one to start? All I've watched of JP is Magical Change and a few episodes of Sunshine.  <br>KD is the only JP I've watched, but it was very enjoyable. Post impressions of RL as you go, if you like. It's fun to discuss stuff.</br>  <br>I'm 9 episodes into KD myself and I have no idea.</br>  <br>Twinkle is good, but I think it's the only one where humans get magic. Except Magical Change, sort of.</br>  I miss them.  does rainbow live cure depression?  I miss her.  <br>only until you finish it.</br>  I miss Ayami.    <br>Ultimately, it just exacerbates it.</br>  <br>She'll come next to you, one day.</br>  <br>Maybe once I'm dead.</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/ONhwwgigMeo  [ ]<br><br>Just watch it again  in english. </br></br></br>  <br>SO FROM NOW ON WE'RE RINNE.</br>  <br>I wish.</br>  <br>I wish all of these were ripped. Listening to shitty dubs might be good for rewatching.</br>  <br>I think most of them are.<br>I have the first episode dubbed.</br></br>  <br>He's a cop, of course he drinks coffee. It's what cops do when they're not busy meting out justice.</br>  pshuu  <br> eew <br><br>terrible.</br></br></br>    <br>Someone should stream them for /ai/ to watch</br>  There need to be more episodes with the idles in casual outfits.    This episode of Tribe Cool Crew was Ultra Happy. Looks like they're really gearing up towards ending this with one final cour and one last Dance Road.  is kpkn dead? It's been a while since they last uploaded an episode and I'm wondering if I should just go with doki   I'm totally proud of my Murrica Ladies. I hope Kaede is enjoying it too.

The dancers finally started complaining about Dance Road dragging on too long and said that they should at least get a glimpse of Jey in person by now. Almost immediately, Headphones Guy was like, "Well, okay, here he is then," and suddenly there Jey is (in holographic form). "Jey" talked to them and everything, but as soon as he disappears, Slim Johnny Bepp whispered to Headphones, "Looks like that was enough to satisfy them." Hm.</br></br>  <br>Suspicious, but I'm not sure it's necessarily in a bad way. There was also that pause Jey had right after the twins talked to him like he didn't have a prerecorded message ready. Crowd High is gonna be some real bad shit though. Lui and Moe have their scientists backing them up, but everyone else is going to start getting hurt. <br><br>The performances keep getting better though. I like the mini aura that Kanon now also has, and the Blossom Bullets one was really cool.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How about assassination plots? Anything happened after the one guy pretending to be a cripple who was going to use an EMP rifle?</br></br>  <br>Dat nail.</br>  <br><br>There hasn't been any more assassination plots since then. Although there is that guy who seems to be against Jey and got Lui and Moe to spread "Crowd High" (basically dancing that makes you, well, high).</br></br>  <br>You mean thighs.</br>  <br>And apparently contains hip thrusts so mighty it creates creates micro fractures in the skeleton and erodes tissue muscles.

I only just watched it just now.</br></br></br>  <br>No clue. I've stayed out of them to avoid spoilers and I still haven't seen episode one yet.</br>  <br>It varies. There are the people who legitimately hate Tomori or Yuu (exclusively, it's never both), the Key trolls who are easy to spot, that one Aniplex guy, but also some conversation that's not too bad. It should calm down a bit in a few episodes when the core fanbase is established, as it usually does.</br>  <br>Oh shit it's real.</br>  <br>If you want comedy, go for KiraDeco, if you want something more serious yet fun, go for Twinkle.</br>  <br>Picked up again.</br>   I won't let you sleep tonight.   <br>Please, spare me.</br>  <br>To be fair the MC gave me a bad impression, until he was served by Divine Justice as I realized he should have broken his neck in that one scene. I had even dropped it until the thread encouraged me to finish it, so I did. Imouto is an excellent girl. Also I hope Michon isn't ded.</br>  <br>She's not justice though, unless you mean in the sense of following a set of rules, not some higher morality. Not once did she say what he did was wrong or that she was right, she simply said it was her duty to bring him to their school, so she did. That's the only point I want to make, and the rest can continue in the proper thread.</br>  How do you guys even find the strength to watch non-/ai/ shows anymore? I was watching Kuroko but now that it's over I don't even feel like checking out anything this season.  <br>Well, it's a lot that I have absolutely nothing better to do.</br>  <br>This season is bretty good.</br>  Mostly because Mezashite subs it or it's related to something I was interested in before I found out about /ai/.  <br>I've basically given up on watching non-/ai/ shows for the most part, and the few I do watch are at least /ai/-like in some way (show by rock last season, symphogear this season). Little girls shows are too good.</br>  <br>Which shows do you recommend?<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm going to watch Shirayukihime because I read the manga a few years ago, but the other shows simply don't spark any interest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Symphogear as always.<br><br>Working!!! because Working.<br><br>Shimoneta to Iu Gainen ga Sonzai Shinai Taikutsu na Sekai is not for little girls, but it is REALLY fun in the dumbest way possible..</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the good stuff are sequels, but there's also Classroom Crisis, Shimoneta, and Game of Laplace  because of Leona-tier cuteboy MC. </br>  <br>I tend to half-watch first episodes while doing something else, or just flick through them. Which is enough to pick out things that actually appeal to me. Which usually isn't much.</br>  swimsuits   Throwing a respected, well established family business out of the window to get into the ephemeral and futile idol showbiz world <br>I empathize 100% with the dad</br>    <br><br>Jewelpet did in 14 episodes what Precure couldn't in 556.</br></br>  <br>That's not his problem with Ann's goals.</br>  Okay which one of you are responsible for this garbage-tier posting?  <br><br>Who is this cum plum?</br></br>  <br>I don't think any of us did that?</br>  <br> Kodomo no Jikan </br>  <br> not one little girl show on the list <br>Nothing to do with us.

The next episode preview shows many events that happen in Battle of Gods, like Goku in a blue and white tracksuit on Kaio's world and Vegeta training against laser bots in the spaceship.

Might I suggest you wait for the inevitable english dub?</br>   <br>I'm watching  The latin dub  because it's one of the few dubs that are actually really good and they're extremely faithful to the source material, not to mention they keep everything and even the intros sound better.<br>Already watched it on jap years ago so.<br><br>Is this your first time hearing the japanese voices?<br>Have you fucks ignored Dragon ball since Z?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I waited my ass off for Battle of the gods I cant keep waiting</br>  <br> mexicans and their dbz shit <br>Mexican grew with DB unlike burgers.</br></br>  <br>But did you never played the games?

His "ultimate" form in buu saga still lost.</br></br>  <br>It's more like turning more into a monkey<br><br>SS4 tried to copy this concept but for some reason it gave Goku pants, black hair and he lost the golden motif. Seriously, I have no idea why anybody thought that was a good idea</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, this is six months after Boo so he can still go to his highest state of Ultimate Gohan.<br><br>Another mark for Super against GT in that regard now that I think about it</br></br></br>  <br>It basically gets handwaved as "lol he didn't train so now he sucks more than Krillin, LOL NERD"<br><br>It pisses me off for a couple of reasons, for one there is no reason that he should be that much weaker, he slacked off for years between the Cell and Buu sagas and could still go SS2 (albeit a weaker version than when he fought Cell but he could still do it) but somehow, despite actually being even stronger at the end of the Buu saga he loses all of his strength in even less time. <br><br>It also reduces the amount of capable fighters in the show by one more, which pisses me off because it was already stale when all we had was Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Gotenks in the Buu saga and everyone else was too shit to do anything. Now we literally just have Goku and Vegeta as the only not shit fighters in the whole damn thing, it's so fucking stale having such a small portion of the cast being the only ones who ever actually DO anything.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is it that those that complain the most about DBS are either niggers or mexicans? Niggers always claim that DBZ started with Raditz going to earth while Mexicans don't like anything not AAAAAAHHHHHHHH from the DB franchise.</br>  <br>Holy shit this is great</br>  <br>I'd like to think that Elder Kai unlocking his potential, while giving him a huge power boost, degrades faster without training due to being a super natural power up.<br><br>Besides it doesn't really matter if Gohan can only go super saiyan or still have his potential unlocked, the gap between him and Beerus is so big it isn't even relevant.</br></br></br>  <br>that's his Ultimate form you idiot<br><br>quoting:<br><br> "as Ultimate Gohan, he surpasses Super Saiyan 2 and even Super Saiyan 3 (according to the Super Exciting Battle Guide; he is confirmed stronger than Gotenks in the manga/anime). Daizenshuu 2 states that Ultimate Gohan is still capable of becoming a Super Saiyan, but even without utilising the form he surpasses Super Saiyan 3 Gotenks in power, if Ultimate Gohan was to become a Super Saiyan his power would likely rise to levels above even Super Buu (Gohan, Piccolo, Goten, and Trunks absorbed)." </br></br></br></br></br>  Wait a fucking second, someone enlighten me please<br><br>Battle of Gods starts 4 years after the battle with Buu<br><br>Super starts 6 months after the battle with Buu<br><br>Both are canon<br><br>Why did they set the start of Super earlier than BoG?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try watching the original dragon ball in Japanese.

Badly animated, abysmally paced filler? Not quite.<br><br>The rest I can agree with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if it would be better if Super Saiyan had red eyes instead of blue to better represent rage</br>  <br>could have been launch</br>  <br> Complaining about Japanese kids about having Japanese jokes </br>  <br> blue hair launch was better then yellow </br>  <br>You don't know what you're talking about.</br>  What did Goku tell Chi Chi when he invited the God of Destruction to his home?<br> Hey Chi Chi, Beerus! </br>  <br> Hey ChiChi, I got us a pet cat! He's a god of destruction though so be nice </br>  Reminder that people who say BoG is filler slice of life crap with not enough action are shitters and it doesn't matter if they prefer DB or DBZ because they're simply wrong as it is easily the best movie we've seen for DB. Ironically the one of the fight scenes in that movie was possibly the best in the series and animated by the guy who did Krillin vs Goku for the Dragon Ball anime.<br><br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/2a8250d<wbr>28ad500f15c277a25e829699a.webm</wbr></br></br>  <br>I see what you did there.</br>  <br> BoG babies <br> it's different than Z so that must mean it's good </br></br>  What is the best subs for DBS?  <br><br>BoG has the same tone as Majin, Buu and Super saga. People who are mad at BoG's comedic values are simply wrong if they say it isn't in the spirit of Z nevermind the series.<br><br>By the way, who are you quoting?  :^) </br></br></br></br>  <br>As hard it is to accept, Dragon Ball isn't the same without the cel shaded animation</br>  <br>What the hell has changed? He's gotten a tad bit more mature, but that's really it.</br>  <br>The character has changed very little, but his strength in comparison to the rest of the universe has grown at an insane rate and the scenarios he encounters have gotten cosmic in scale to cope with it.<br><br>Goku doesn't need to be like a kid, he either needs to be out of the picture, or simply weaker.</br></br></br>  <br> He's gotten a tad bit more mature, but that's really it. <br><br>Kid Goku was a naive hothead, but after he grew up and trained with Kami he literally became more of a generic hero.<br><br>Kid Goku murdered the fuck out of the red ribbon army, as well as King Piccolo and his demons.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I think if you ask a lot of people they miss cel shaded animation. Digital painting is cool and can work very well (REDLINE) but most of the time the old cel shading method brought in some cool imperfections and effect that is too hard to replicate in digital painting.<br><br>Could be worse, could be CG like the fight through capsule city in that movie.</br></br></br></br>  <br>man that part where the cams panning around goku gets me so pumped</br>  <br> BoG has the same tone as Majin, Buu <br><br>It's like we didn't even watch the same show. I think Boredom of Gods was passable as a whole but humor in DB/DBZ had cohesive value and good pacing while BoG was all over the place. If I really wanted to blame something, it would be that all of this wasn't made 10 years ago to be honest.<br><br> Although BoG had some cool ideas like Vegeta's shenanigans the rest barely compares to the 40th WSJ special, and that's saying a lot. Extra points for bringing Pilaf's gang back though. </br></br></br></br></br>  What subs are you fags using? Only tried animerg or something. They're passable but with some sync issues. <br><br>What do you recommend?</br></br>  <br>Only the first episode is out; just download all of the releases and compare yourself</br>  <br>I understood more without shitty subs than with shitty subs on. Shitty subs were just distracting.<br><br>Don't even speak moonrunes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's your problem. I guess you watch instead of reading the manga? I'm going to go through Majin and Buu saga before I get to my point with Battle of Gods.<br><br>There was an editor switch after Cell games arc was finished and Majin saga started to resemble original Dragon Ball comedy. I mean, the terror of the universe was literally pic related and the reveal around it was fucking hilarious. Also not to mention the tournament fights with Trunks and Goten, the fusion mishap with Supreme Kai and Gotenks in general. It was still a retarded power level battle shonen by this point but it was a strong call to form for the finale to return make the final villain become a good guy which hadn't been done since Vegeta.<br><br>Overall, despite Earth being FUBAR it was really light-hearted compared to Cell, Android, Namek and Saiyan sagas.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I watched the anime and I own the manga, who do you think you're talking to? BoG's problem is that it resembled neither of them. It tried to be its own spin on DB. Some of it went good, some went bad. Super is not really trying to be good, but we're only on the first episode, so we'll see.</br>  <br>continuation<br><br><br>Battle of Gods for me was more of that in a feature film format. We already know the characters other than the two antagonistic figures we met in the film. We're introduced to a bit of mingling and characters interacting with eachother we've never really seen before outside of Toei non-canon bullshit and the events leading up to Beerus losing his shit were great and funny. <br><br>The rest of the movie is standard action schlock because Beerus threatens Earth like other series villains. However it has one of the few moments in the series where Goku actually has character development and becomes a little more selfless after the clash - even as a new character Beerus comes away from it all with a nice new perspective and new-found respect for our dumbass hero.<br><br>I cannot see the problem with the pacing other than the horrible sudden introduction of the legend of a 'Super Saiyan God' (was a lot better with Shenron than with Beerus and Whis.) The movie was honestly fine and well contained. <br><br>A lot of the comedy was lost on me in a re-watch for the American dub. Consider re-watching it at one point in the Japanese dub if you ever feel like giving it another chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Can I watch this without having fully watched the old series?  <br>yes</br>  <br>Yes easily<br>If you like shonens then this is a chill watch<br><br>all you need to know is its late in the series, the MC (Goku) is an adult with a family, theres a whole bunch of established characters and abilities, and almost everyone of them is irrelevant anyway so you wont miss much</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>continuation<br><br><br><br>Something about Super's first episode has me really excited but I'm sure it won't last for long. It's that the series is finally giving more care to relationships with other characters e.g. Piccolo and Gohan, some well deserved Goku actually trying to be a father before he fucks off to King Kai's planet again.<br><br>The show is still meant for children who are a single digit of age but it feels like wish furfillment and still has the same magic of the old Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z and the recent movie (not seen RoF yet) which all Toei originals have lacked. I guess it's something to do with Toriyama actually producing the stories and characters for these works and the Toei screenwriter he's working with since BoG being kinda cool.<br><br>tl;dr same tone, older movies (i.e. Broly) possibly think things like Uchiha Sasuke is cool or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toei non-canon bullshit <br>You mean like BoG?<br><br> events leading up to Beerus losing his shit were great and funny <br>It could have been done in a less bland way.<br><br> I cannot see the problem with the pacing other than the horrible sudden introduction of the legend of a 'Super Saiyan God' <br>I didn't even mind this, I have seen much more stupid junk before.<br><br>I see where you're coming from but you're really making BoG look better than it actually is. To me, it's not really worth a re-watch. But I'm no one to tone down your enthusiasm like this, so I'll just stop.<br><br>I didn't even see the American dub of BoG because I'm not American. Didn't even see my native dub to be honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>fans of older movies (sans Fusion)*</br></br>  <br> &gt;Toei non-canon bullshit <br> You mean like BoG? <br><br>Nah lad, done talking with you. It isn't just hype, he did work on the last 2 movies, OVA and Super.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Yo Son Goku and his friends return" was the only decent DB related thing to come out in the past 10 years.</br>  <br> &gt;Japanese voices are the best <br> literal tranny goku <br><br>nah</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Europe were in to DB way before mexicans and americans.</br></br>  So it's starting before BoG and RoF, but going through them reimagining them.....so are they also going to go through Yo! Son Goku etc. and bring in Tarbles??  <br><br>I love DB as much as the next guy, but you're sure you're not trying too hard to act as a special snowflake and treating perfectly standard stuff as a second coming of God?<br><br>Maybe the feeling of Funimation's DBZ (and its fanbase) was hammered so much in your head you're now realizing how DB and Goku's character was actually supposed to feel?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how they made goten a lot smaller than trunks. reminds me of how goku was much smaller than krillin and then grew so tall. I loved that episode where goku grew up to a teenager at the tournament with piccolo</br>  Question for sub anon,<br>after you make all these srt files for the different parts are you going to put them into one single srt file? so we can put the subtitles with the torrent version?<br>Also good job man</br></br>  <br>Goku was never smaller than Krillin<br><br>Wen they first met, Goku was a bit taller</br></br></br>  Does anyone know when the english dub will come out? I don't think I can handle Goku's voice  is this done under toriyamas direction? and if so, anyone else feels like he should finally move past dragonball and create a new series?<br><br>remember when he moved past dr slump? and how everyone got the hots for db? imagine what he could do if he actually left it behind for good.<br>and not just like with that neko majin miniseries which was basically another db parody. i mean, really leaving this whole fighing, muscles, glowing golden crap behind</br></br></br>  <br>go watch japanese kid goku and then go to super<br><br>you'll get used to it that way</br></br></br>  <br>I've watched DB in japanese, but it just bothers me that an adult male talks like a japanese woman</br>  <br> anyone else feels like he should finally move past dragonball <br><br>Do you seriously think Toriyama wanted to do more Dragon Ball aside for some funny one shots? Nostalgiafags gonna nostalgiafag, and there's nothing you can do about it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>In like 10 years<br><br>Stop being an autistic manchild and just watch it</br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't think I can handle Goku's voice <br><br>Then don't watch it.<br><br>It's not getting dubbed for anytime now.<br><br>Kai isn't even dubbed, a full year after release. It's going to be another year or two for Super at the least.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm surprised you didn't get used to it. Usually only ppl that go directly from the dub to hearing goku's jpn voice get bothered by it.</br>  <br>This is my first time watching anything Dragon Ball and I must say, I was not expecting that voice too</br>  <br><br>tbh I'd rather they just remix all the old OP.<br><br>new one is mediocore, kai OP was decent however</br></br></br></br>  <br>he was anything but annoying on namek, maybe against the ginyu force when he couldnt do anyhting but after his potential unlock he became more useful than vegeta in a lot of ways. <br><br>the only time he was annoying was during the saiyan saga and that was because he was like 4 years old.</br></br></br>  <br>thats not my point. <br>if he's signing contract after contract to produce more dragonball crap, thats all on him. you can't blame nostalgiafags about consuming that stuff.<br><br>move on to a new genre, leave the fanbase hanging and get a new one. others have done it. so why can't he?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I watched DBZ as a kid so from there I got used to Goku sounding more manlier, as teen I decided to watch the DB series in Japanese and was okay with his voice because it suited a kid. It's just weird.</br></br>  <br>he was always annoying and despite being the strongest we've known about (though goten had him easily surpassed as a child, adult goten and this timeline adult trunks should easily end up surpassing him really) he's never liked fighting much. so of course he will forever end up sissy son.</br>  <br> implying Toriyama's Bird Studio has more control over DB than Shueisha or Toei <br><br>haha<br><br>Even then, he's been compliant but he's not actually doing jack, just providing some hasty writing that everyone else will have to expand on. He's like "lol okay, here are some ideas off the top of my head". Not sure what you're trying to do by demonizing Toriyama as one big DB money monster. People even barely talk about the oneshots he did after DB.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck, Sabat's Vegeta sounds so much better in Kai. I forgot how terrible it used to be.</br>  If it weren't for the beaners, the English dub would take longer to come out.<br><br>Source:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MIQ<wbr>yCJAFUeY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry wrong source.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dtg<wbr>qv1ET39k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Still like my fanfic better than what they are offering thus far imo.<br><br> The Academy of Gods is introduced <br> The headmaster wonders about the inconsistent rate of desctruction and creation in Goku's universe, and why the earth still exists after it should have been destroyed mutiple times <br> The assistant of the headmaster goes to goku's universe to investigate the case <br> First, Bills hides from him embarrased of his failures to destroy earth, and Whis pretends him to be sleeping <br> The assistant goes first to Satan since everyone assume him to be the hero of earth, then to Piccolo since he was the first "higher" being intending to destroy earth <br> Bills tells goku and friends about the academy of gods and investigations <br> The headmaster wants a tournament of the gods to determine a new structure of the universe with new gods, and invites Goku, the Kaios, Dende and Piccolo <br> Vegeta becomes Super Saiyan God by training, since he badly wants into the tournament <br> The 2nd half of the movie is the tournament of the gods, with the final being God Goku vs God Vegeta </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i'm not. put down the fanboy shield for a second. if thats all he does, then its even worse.<br>if all he does for dragonball is throw some oneliners to his creative team, why doesn't he use the rest of his time to make something his heart is actually into?</br></br>  post yfw  <br>but if gods know that it is fighting and tournaments that let earths fate stray from what it originally was intended to be, why would they opt to decide its fate through jet another tournament.<br><br>why would the gods ever tell anyone on earth about this tournament anyways?<br><br>and why would freshly emerged god vegeta topple all contestants and make it to the finals? i mean, come on, people didn't become gods (and much earlier and for longer times) for nothing.<br><br>good work though, its not like plotholes aren't the salt in a dragonball movie soup</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>seriously, this sound so boring, wheres the tension ?</br>  <br>vegetas whiny bitching and crying before he magically transforms into yet another stage that goku had already reached long ago, yet makes him think he's finally superior to goku after all?<br><br>think of all that tension before he gets curbstomped like always</br></br></br>  <br>sorry but ive seen it so many time, you are not helping yourself at all, maybe instead of writing shit you should try something other? you sucks at writings, maybe start sucking dicks?</br>  <br>I'm not the guy who is doing that fanfiction thing?</br>  Does anyone have link to the site where you could read or download DB? /a/ set it up after another site went under.  <br> introduce mary sue <br> create wet dream <br>so if beerus is so afraid of godsue why not just blow up earth? it's like goku and co could stop him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm the guy who posted all that earlier.

DB is the best, small goku was his greatest most inspiring form. The only good thing about dbz was Piccolo, period.</br>  Friendly reminder to all that the manga by Toyotarô is an adaptation of the show, for which the plot was provided by Toriyama.

That "demon king" (魔王) is a real bitch to translate because there isn't any reference other than Satan in our culture. Other anime (like DQ's) having a guy named Demon King was reserved the Satan treatment. Not only that, France also went with Satan, and since France has been the one country with kept the closest contact to TOEI you can bet the Satan name was discussed with the Japanese.<br><br>Our first DB adaptation named him Ox-Satan, while the latter went with Al Satan, which just rolls better off the tongue and nobody actually knew what an Ox was. In the manga adaptation it was translated as "Bull Sorcerer" just to let you know how ass backwards translation can go.<br><br>Then whoops. Piccolo Daimaou came, well, we can't certainly call a character "Piccolo", even if it's the name of an instrument, because kids will keep thinking about "little". Then we have the infamous maou. So what do we do? We actually resume Gyuumaou's Japanese and switch Al Satan to King Piccolo. I know it's frustrating, but there were decisions to be made and they went with the most logical outcome. Again, France also did this so it may be really possible it was suggested by TOEI itself. In the manga they called him "Great Magician Piccolo" before the Evergreen edition came about, no consistency whatsoever. At least we didn't call our God Kami like everyone else did, using "Supreme Being" we kept the divine figure he had without mentioning God. If you want unaltered names you would have watched the Japanese version from the start anyway.<br><br> wrong moves in dbz before freezer <br><br>Yeah, apart from some really dumb errors (which WERE errors, if that lifts the blame), I'd like to hear a single technique which was translated poorly from the original.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When's the doujin?</br>  <br><br>I do like my dub Goku voice and I'm ok with Nozawa's Goku.<br><br>If it's so difficult for you to enjoy the series in sub the you are the one with the problem, not them.<br><br>Simply fuck off and wait until Super gets aired in your country.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who is doing the soundtrack for Super?  <br>Bulma wearing her old bunny ears and chi-chi wearing her old helmet blade thing.</br>  <br>When i stop being terrible at drawing comics.</br>  <br> Japanese voices are the best <br>fuck you i dont hate the jap dub but i like english more<br> Japanese music is the best <br> Faulconer music is shit because it never shut the fuck up and was mostly boring save a few nostalgiavision tracks <br>they are both mediocre aside from a few tracks, super sounds really fresh and decent so far<br> Funimation butchered all character names <br>fuck you<br> Funimation butchered the scripts and continues to do so even with BoG <br>fuck you Kai is fixed BoG is fine<br> Dragon Ball is better than Z <br>they are equal<br> GT is fucking shit and so are all the movies that aren't BoG/FnF <br>correct aside from very few of the movies<br> Short hair Videl is the best <br>New Videl is best<br> Super having SoL filler is a beautiful thing <br>agreed 200%</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This art is shit.
