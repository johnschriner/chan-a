Shigaraki's quirk is disintegration, he can completely destroy whatever he holds with his own hands (the special U.A. gate that kept out the press, Aizawa's elbow, Stain's knife) <br><br>He protected that hand because he called it 'father' before. That hand means a lot to him. It doesn't have a special quirk of its own: a dead hand can't have a quirk.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've been following Berserk and HxH for years now, I suffered already but I'm not imune to it yet.</br>  <br>So thats why he's a villain in the same vein of Bakugou, poor motherfuckers cant masturbate.</br>  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>251</wbr>  <br> http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/37<wbr>4251</wbr> <br>Finally.</br></br>  <br>THE 5 MINUTES ARE OVER<br><br>FINALLY</br></br></br>  <br> IIDA LIVES YES.  </br>  <br>Good, man.</br>  <br>Is it too late at night to summon Translatorfag?</br>  <br>We don't know that anon. The hands on his face + the hands all over his body might still hold quirks, we still haven't been informed.<br><br>If the author really does intend to make Facepalm the anti thesis to Deku, then it wouldn't be strange for him to somehow have multiple quirks (in the form of hands).</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like Iida's saying some epic shit.<br>What do you think GT and Deku are talking about in the beginning ?</br></br>  <br>Deko has no Quirk<br>Hands has many quriks.<br>its the opposite</br></br></br>  <br/>  Begin the SUMMONING!  <br><br>SPIRAL STAIRCASE</br></br>       bunch of shotas sucking each other's dicks <br>Its called Boku no Pico.</br>  <br>The Wheel of time. The One power and shit would look great animated + awesome sword fights, harem, and giant battles.</br>    Different studio for each tale  <br>I was watching the live-action adaptation and it was so terrible that I couldn't make it past the first ten or so minutes.</br>  <br><br>I think you've been reading too many trap doujins if that is what you interpreted from Ender's Game <br><br><br>oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be terrible. Incestfags would scream there's not enough Ender x Valentine content.<br>All the political net writing would be full of emoji. Yaoi fags would not even pick it up until shower scene. And you can bet your ass some retard would cram in 'floating with toast in the mouth in zero G' scene.</br></br>  <br> oh man Hyperion by someone like I.G. or Bones would be neato <br><br>They should do End of Hyperion, I think a diffferent studio for each tale would highlight the differences between storytellers<br><br>It would also not spoil a twist</br></br></br></br></br>  Farseer trilogy  <br>Movie wasn't THAT bad if you read the book before.<br>Shit went sanic fast though and they went full retard with the Formic fleet.</br></br>  <br>Branden Sanderson's Stormlight series would be neato.</br>    <br> Branden  <br><br> wtf. <br><br>Stormlight would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OH MY GOD. I read those when i was in like 5th grade yo. That takes me fucking back. I still have the little shitty amulet you get with the box set.</br>  This would make one epic space opera.    Just make the martians look more like dark elves and you have an awesome sci-fi series.  Just read this series, Time slowing, western style gunslingers in a fantasy setting would be pretty fucking cool. Plus weird giant metal abominations that widows with swords have to kill.   All of these scifi genreplebs <br>disgusting<br><br>I cast my vote for a series of collected short stories by Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe</br></br></br>  <br><br>Concur on this. Its single character centric enough to be fucking great as an anime.</br></br>  <br>hurr a raven made me kill myself</br>  <br><br><br>Jesus fucking Christ, why are book covers always so fucking horrible?<br><br>Really, it's just one image you need. One fucking painting or drawing. Not that hard, you incompetent shitheels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>Books 2, 3, and 4 should each get a 2 cour adaptation.<br>Then, after, they can make the first book into 2 or 3 prequel movies.</br></br></br>  The Witcher series seems tailor-made to be an anime.  I actually am surprised Ender's Game never got animooted in the 80s or whenever the nips were nutty for western SF.    <br>Right? When the stuff that's inside them is so great, the cover really just makes you wonder, what in the fuck?</br>  <br><br>next book when<br/></br></br>  <br> scifi genreplebs <br> Joseph Conrad or Edgar Allen Poe </br></br>  I just want my 2D Luna Lovegood  <br>Dont judge a book by its cover<br>˙͜&gt;˙</br></br>  <br>Exactly, thank you. I've never been able to understand this shit.<br><br>It seems that every publisher under the sun took that saying as a license to churn out shitty covers.</br></br></br>  <br>Little Witch Academia.</br>  <br>I laughed harder than I should have at this</br>  Pic related would be amazing, but I don't think enough nips read Narnia as kids to get hooked in.  <br>No they should do 1 and 2 side by side jumping back and forth between Ender and Bean..</br>  <br>That's why when i Said Wheel of Time i didn't post a cover. They are the furthest from what the book is actually like that you could possibly get.</br>  <br>Are you too stupid to process Conrad's style?</br>    <br>In a series full of absolutely shit characters, Luna stands out as a bastion of purity and moe.</br>  <br>Don't ever push Brandon Sanderson. That fuck writes like a god damned machine.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Here, have some Perrin Fan art.</br>  Anyone read this shit as a kid? Literally perfect for an anime adaption.  <br>Jesus Christ Superstar: The Anime</br>      <br>If he takes long enough, he can let some up-and-comer turn stormlight book 10 into 3 more novels!<br><br> He actually has a progress bar on his website. 8% through the first draft ;_; </br></br></br>  This would be perfect as an anime.  <br/>  Last to First Men and Starmaker.  I would love to see a proper adaption of Moby-Dick, but it honestly wouldn't translate well. Moby-Dick uses the written medium to its fullest potential. <br><br>Anything by Nathaniel Hawthorne or Mark Twain would be cool too. A lot of Le Guin's novels might work well as anime: The Lathe of Heaven, The Left Hand of Darkness, etc. <br><br>Also, Little, Big.<br><br><br>I read that book about a month ago and it was fucking terrible. I literally could not get myself to finish reading the last 40 or so pages, so I ended up dropping it, which is something I never do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you imagine the huge uproar this would cause if this show was aired in the United States?<br><br>I know this is completely unrelated to the thread, but man, fuck the west.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep in mind the other stuff he's writing too, I mean. He's already got an extensive universe going on with Mistborn and Elantris, AND warbreaker.</br>  <br>Why do people think Ender's Shadow is the second book?<br>It's the fifth.<br>All the shadow books (anything that's not the first 4) can be ignored.<br>The first book can be ignored too actually - It's really just an extraneous backstory.<br> mfw most people didn't even read the best part of the series </br></br></br></br></br>  I'd like to see an old-school sword and sorcery series get an anime, maybe Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.  Anything that's not the traumatizing English animation.  <br><br> Read series back in late-elementary/early-middle school <br> Even made an entire board-game about it as a school project <br> Found out there was an anime a couple years ago. <br> mfw <br>Now I really want to see the sequel series adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This book is garbage.</br>  <br>Wait. <br><br> anime <br><br>IT HAS AN ANIME?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> delicious brown elf version of Dark They Were and Golden Eyed </br>  <br>stop demeaning people's religious texts, anon</br>  <br>No, it's literal garbage. It has no idea what it wants to be.<br><br>Fuck, the Shaver Mysteries are better than Battlefield Earth. And least that sticks with a tone.</br></br></br>  <br>Only if they looked like this</br>  I'm surprised no one has suggested this yet.  <br>it was a (admittedly bad) Scientology joke, calm down</br>  Or a series set in the Sprawl. Molly Millions would be my waifu.  Shitty Cover Incoming. <br><br>Rangers apprentice would make a great coming of age/adventure story.</br></br>  <br>Defending bad science fiction is never acceptable.<br><br>Pic related needs a good adaptation. Fuck Will Smith.</br></br></br>  <br>Because that stopped being funny in 2007.</br>  Donkey Hoetay  This would be amazing too, though the scope might be too much for a single series.  <br>Can't say Asimov without throwing Foundation in that too. Those would be great.</br>  <br>Already got one.</br>  <br>I know, he's ridiculous. It's awesome to start with an author from the beginning and look forward to the rest.</br>  Prose Edda<br><br>Norse mythology anime where all the gods are cute girls when????</br></br>    <br>Fuck off, /co/</br>  with Alejandro Jodorowsky directing it    Snow crash could be good if it had a decent budget and a good studio  or just letting Trigger do it.    I want sword and sorcery.  <br><br> Does Not mention the king of that genre. </br></br>  The Room anime when?  Directed by Yuasa.       young Anno will never make any other Jules Verne adaptations   <br>The last books were so dull.</br>  <br>Snow Crash had a plot like an anime just because of how over the top it was <br><br> Hiro Protagonist  <br><br>it would work so well</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just assumed it was a given. Besides, I read comics and I've gotten enough Conan in that form for two lifetimes.</br>  <br>keke<br>He would probably ask Miyazaki himself to voice a character</br></br>   novels that would make good anime thread <br> always full of sf and space <br> always. this is like a universal truth, one of the few things that all of /a/ agrees on <br><br> severe lack of good sf and space anime <br><br>I don't understand this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Y.T. would be plenty of appeal to the lolicons</br>  <br>Isn't The Room basically a 'generic' NTR story if you take away all the comedy?</br>  Surprised nobody's mentioned Dinotopia yet.  <br>I'd like this.</br>  <br>we aren't japan anon</br>   still no bean meeting Ender in the future  <br><br>Why is the author such a slow writer. Even GRR Martin is a faster writer</br></br>  <br>Japan has extremely shit taste and science fiction is expensive to produce.</br>  <br> severe lack of good sf and space anime <br>It's not a question of that, it's just what we know would work.</br></br>  <br>japs have shit taste</br>  <br> America invades Canada for no reason <br><br>This was worse than GATE in terms of military circlejerking.</br></br></br>  <br>But if it would work so well, why isn't there more of it?<br> seems to be the closest to a real answer.</br></br>  Jeeves series except genderbent.<br><br>I want to see genki girl Wooster screw everything up while Rei-clone maid Jeeves come to fix them while throwing deadpan tsukkomis</br></br>  The Chronicles of Amber would be great. They could do so much with these books do to their setting. Plus, the MC would be the best MC. <br><br>All of Zelazny's books would be worth some sort of Adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Casuals are just circlejerking it because the guy writes Saga.</br>  <br>Every Foundation book was progressively worse than the last. But man, was the fist one good.</br>  <br>But anon, Megazone 23 is all you need for space animes.</br>  <br>Dude, Doorways in the Sand is my Favorite book. That and Damnation Alley would be worth at LEAST a movie adaptation. If not an OVA.<br><br>We dont talk about the bad 70's movie adaption.</br></br></br>  Made into a SoL with a cast of cute girls.  Perfume, but genderbent.  <br>Fuck<br>Yes</br></br>  <br>Doorways Borders on Literary perfection. Its such a good single book. One at the Pinnacle of Sifi that most people don't even know exist.</br>  <br>She's like 14 and not flat or innocent...I'd still fuck Y.T. though.</br>  <br>I'd love to see all the rages and butthurts from that.</br>  <br> &gt;bunch of shotas sucking each other's dicks <br><br>man for a guy who hates gays this much Scott Card is a pretty massive faggot</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Seems like we all know what we expect from Japanese adaptations</br></br></br></br>  Done by the Planetes team.  <br> Brave New World <br>They already made an anime adaptation of it but it wasn't a series but they should do a series of Wizards of Earthsea.<br>They should make an anime movie of the Old Man and the Sea</br></br></br>  <br>Beat me to it<br>Also 1984 or WE</br></br>  <br>I always thought that, he's supposed to be homophobic, but Ender's Game is full of naked kids and I even remember he having some gay as fuck intimate conversation with an indian guy or something like that.<br>Also he kills a kid with a kick to the balls.</br></br>  <br>I can imagine the Death Note levels of sure mindfuckery already.<br><br> "I planned it like this." <br> "But actually, I knew your plan already!" <br> "I knew what you knew, so I planned this instead!" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How good is this Adaption? I feel like i need to watch this.</br>  <br> Wizards of Earthsea <br><br>It's already a thing. Just not that specific sorry if memory serves.<br>https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tal<wbr>es_from_Earthsea_(film)</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Ctrl + F <br>  No Scott Westerfeld <br>Give me my steampunk gundam, Japan!</br></br></br>  <br>I liked the bizarre adventure aspect of Foundation and Earth and the quick pacing of Prelude but I can get what you're saying <br><br>Asimov at his worst is better than most sci-fi slop in any case</br></br></br>  <br> steampunk <br>Ew, no.</br></br>  <br>The movie does not do the book justice. The author was actually fairly disappointed with the end product by Goro.<br><br>Though I do agree it needs a complete retelling, possibly in multiple movie form to adapt all the books, and hopefully accurately this time.</br></br></br>  <br>I believe your thinking of that French guy who talked like a faggot</br>  <br>Children of the Mind was pretty shit.</br>  <br>I don't remember much since I read the book long ago, but I remember it being a guy that told him something about his religion before parting.<br>It was a really gay moment.</br></br>  The Graveyard Book could easily be turned into an anime.    <br>Oooooo another Alchemist anime would be neato.<br><br>The MC would be good for an Anime style show too.</br></br></br>  <br>  Alchemist  <br><br>Dont you mean demon summoning?</br></br></br>  <br> You must have no specific interests and just read what the hivemind has declared as good <br>This is why nobody likes literaturefags.</br></br>  <br>This shit is gonna be 10 books and from what I can tell each book is about 1 billion pages long</br>  <br>Does it already feature space weeaboos or would they have to be added?</br>  <br>I know how that reaction feels. I randomly saw it at Target once (as an Aussfag). It's totally bizarre how its existence just never came up.</br>  <br>Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow are pretty much the only books worth reading. The rest is just pure wank.<br><br> The first book can be ignored <br><br>I fucking hate you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Im currently watching it now. just started like an hour ago. Gonna binge this shit. I DON'T CARE HOW BAD IT IS THIS IS MY CHILDHOOD. <br><br> tfw its actually not horrible </br></br></br>  <br>I read that shit. Would make for a neat adventure anime, yeah.</br>  <br>seconded</br>    <br>Just skimmed through it. Pretty meh but still brought back a lot of memories.</br>  <br> Massive ridiculous circular textual sonata, the book <br><br>I seriously wonder if you could make and anime do with visuals what this does with words.</br></br></br>  <br>HOLY SHIT YEEEEEEEES.<br><br>This shit would be so dope.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw my brother reeding this a while back. It amazed me how much better written they are then the Mage's Apprentice crap, and the author actually knows his shit. I'd have never known otherwise.</br>    <br>Yeah, i think it was in the 3rd? Book? idk, but the MC got hooked on a drug. When i was younger i was like, Oh... Shit.... Because ive seen people get hooked on Real life stuff and it hit home. Made me sad yo. <br><br>But the Author being able to actually talk about Archery and the way Knights fought and stuff was cool.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I assume the books are much, much better than the existing screen adaptation?</br></br>  <br>Thats generally how it goes for everything.</br>  <br>The damn documental hyped me so fucking hard, too bad the OST wouldn't be by Pink Floyd</br>  <br>Oi fag, you picking a fight</br>  Anyone?  <br>So it's serious now?</br>  I would murder for this and the single player campaign up to broodwar  <br>Nah Man. Those, Especially the Icewind Dale would make fucking great shows.</br>  Episodic Witcher anime<br><br>PLS<br><br>Geralt is already anime as fuck</br></br></br></br>  I used to love these books.  Lol, The Xanth series would be pretty great. <br><br>It would do SO well in an anime, Right amounts of Comedy, Action, and fanservice. I mean, a good bit of it is semi erotic in a way.</br></br>    <br>2001: A Space Odyssey would be a great series</br>  <br>A-as long as there a tsundere character for Ce'Nedra.</br>  <br>It was okay, but in retrospect so was the original source material. Very enjoyable overall though.</br>  <br>Why would there need to be another adaptation?</br>  <br>If you throw in Piers Anthony books, you've gotta include the Incarnations series. <br><br> Skeleton bros unite  <br><br>The MC is literally Death. Would be great for an anime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The MC would be good for an Anime style show too. <br>If I remember correctly, the MC even grows his hair out in one of the books to make himself look more edgy, and then one of the other characters tells him to cut it because it makes him look retarded.<br><br>Would watch/10</br></br></br></br>  <br> Anything that's not the traumatizing English animation. <br>I sat down to watch this at the age of about 11, thinking it would be a cute cartoon about rabbits. It was not.</br></br>  <br>You mean re-adapt The Sentinel?</br>  I dont' know if you've read these stories but they're awesome and some of the best sci-fi ever made and apparently pretty popular in Japan, they're not even that hard to adapt except maybe the second and final novels, but I think they could work fi they made a 26 episode series focusing only some episodes on each, that or four ovas.  <br>Yeah, He makes sure his cloak is flowing in the wind behind him because his ego is huge.</br>  War and peace<br>Master and Margarita<br>Hero of our time<br><br>would make good anime</br></br></br></br>  <br> Wordsworth Classics cover <br>Go to bed, /lit/.</br></br>  The entire Warhammer 40k series   cute girl MC <br> talking cat thing <br> magical adventures <br>it's practically anime already.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING THIS</br>  <br>Wait, even the book is adapted from something else?</br>   ctrl + f Banks <br> 0 results <br>The shitfest after the end of Use of Weapons would be monumental</br></br>  <br>But Hyperion already has an anime adaptation.</br>  <br>FUCKING THIS</br>  <br><br>Make all the rabbits anthropomorphic and you got yourself a deal!<br>Fiver would look like this, but with more buckles and chains.</br></br></br>  <br>Was gonna post this if I didn't see it elswhere in this thread.</br>   Story about a magical shota in medieval Europe <br>It would make millions.</br>  <br>It started as a short story titled The Sentinel, both the book and movie 2001 were worked on at the same time. That's the reason for some of the differences between the book and the movie, Kubrick made some changes that didn't go back the other way.</br>  <br>Isn't the story still pretty "respecful" regarding them used figures ? If anything something that is into religions should like it more than others with all the references.</br>  <br>2001 had 2 sequential books, which also could be adapted, though. It never hurts to re-adapt a series that has aged and is less popular.</br>  <br> gothbunnyboy.jpg <br> buckles and chains <br><br>/lgbt/ and /y/ and /cm/ are calling you. Go back to middle school.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a damn tiny castle.</br>  <br>They did an adaptation of 2010, but it was nowhere near as Kubrick-y as 2001.</br>  <br>2010 got a movie, I don't think 3001 has yet.<br>If we're adapting classic sci-fi, why not Rendezvous with Rama? Get the people responsible for Planetes involved and you're golden.</br></br>  <br> If we're adapting classic sci-fi, why not Rendezvous with Rama? Get the people responsible for Planetes involved and you're golden. <br>This! Although, even though I would love to see this happen, I don't know if it would sell very well as an anime adaptation. It might be a bit too slow-paced for most modern audiences.</br></br>  Third book would probably work the best as an anime.  I can't be the only one who would want to see an Anime version of the Smurfs. Lots of volumes have great stories like the black smurfs and the smurf king.  <br>Also, Smurfette.</br>  <br>Hester and Grike's back story episodes<br><br>The amount of shit that would be lost when grike doesn't die from being run over by a town.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Proper sci-fi will never sell in Japan unless you add mechas or some rpg elements. Just look at the amount of fantasy anime we have this season, it's heartbreaking.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I want shaft animating. I imagine the flash backs to Ptolemy done in shadow puppet style and the demons being more trippy and Inu curryesqe the more powerful they are.</br>  <br>Would you be fine with it if they transformed every races into cute girls ?</br>  <br> War and Peace <br>This is so easy to imagine in anime form while actually reading it. The characters just fit so snugly into the style given how they are described and react to things.</br></br>    i'd like to see japan make these into a series, and i hope they wouldnt localize it too much, since japanese horror sucks   infinite jest   <br>+<br><br><br>Slight time travel codex error detected, reformatting underway.</br></br></br></br>  Its not the best fantasy. But Japan would have a field day with the antimagic poop knights, divine loli school, marketable fire dog.<br><br>At least it's better than sword of truth tho</br></br>  <br>I've already given up about Japan (properly) adapting good horror/scary stories into Anime.</br>  So for those don't know the shahnameh is the ancient Persian book of kings. <br><br>Shahnameh stories concerning Rostam the greatest Persoan hero done in hour long episodes maybe once a month with an art style similar to mononoke but with a pre Islam Persian flair would be a delicious feast for eyes and action.</br></br>  This would actually work pretty well, I think.  <br>BATTLE NUNS NEEDS TO BE A SHOW. <br><br>Fucking Sisters of battle would make one hell of an anime.</br></br></br>   :^)     <br>No it wouldn't</br>  <br>I think /a/ did pretty well not throwing this out sooner. Good job.</br>  <br>This actually sold alright.</br>  <br>I was forced to watch the second or third movie. It really was as bad as they say.</br>  I don't read but I'd like to see an adaption of a Lovecraft book.  <br>watch out for the crawling chaos</br>  I just want some stuff about Rome and Gates of Rome feels pretty anime some times. It reminds me of Hunter x Hunter sometimes except it stars Caesar and Brutus as kids.<br>I, Claudius would be nice too, but I don't think that would work well as an anime.</br>   Replace the apes with lolis.   <br>Well, in the commentary tracks they said that the only reason it got made is because some top dude of some Japanese channel really wanted it to get made, otherwise it would have never happened.</br>  <br> What is Bakemonogatari </br>  <br>Those tracks are interesting. More casts need to record themselves getting drunk for half an hour at a time.</br>  <br> some Japanese channel <br>The NHK. Basically, their ABC or BBC.</br></br>  How come no one has posted this yet? Lewis would love it.  <br>I feel like it's impossible to adapt lovecraft to screen. Showing us a shoggoth or nylarthotep takes away the terror. Unshown they're primal fear, shown they're Freddy Kreuger. <br><br>Uzumaki did about as well as you can with that style once the town itself began to go mad just due to concept of spirals. The spirals were never tangible they just remained a concept that caused madness and mutation. They would need to make lovecraft's terrors remain concept in a highly visual medium.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw Lewis was a lolicon <br>He would have made a great /a/non.</br></br>  <br><br>Ender's game would be shotalicious</br></br>  <br>There will never be a soyuzmultfilm adaptation of this</br>  <br>I wonder how many times we've been through this since the day it was released.</br>  <br> tfw I own a copy of that version. <br>The illustrations are actually pretty good.</br></br>  <br><br><br>What the actual fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>I've always thought it would be perfect. I mean it's got everything.<br><br> Dense chosen-one protagonist <br> Lecherous old master <br> Really-6000-years-old but still hot sorceress <br> Tsundere Princess love-interest <br><br>Really, all the characters are easy to understand cliches; How could it fail? It's even already been translated into moon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>seriously if that dude was any further in the closet he'd be hanging out in Narnia<br><br><br> I believe your thinking of that French guy who talked like a faggot <br><br>Gilles De Raiz?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure any studio would be able to do it justice to my mind.<br><br><br> grike <br>Amerifat please, his name is Shrike.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have it too. The illustrations are too fucking cute. Love it.</br>  <br>Reasons why Harry Potter should get a shounen anime adaptation:<br> mc is ''the chosen one'' <br> dead parents <br> qt heroine and bro character <br> rival <br> story gets darker as it progresses <br> old guy that acts like mentor <br> ok romance that isnt the focus <br> great fantasy setting <br> fight scenes and shit <br>It honestly seems like a cliche fantasy shounen that is just asking to be animated, so it shouldn't be a problem. The main problem is that there's 7 books to adapt. The movies have a duration of about 150 minutes each, and since it leaves out quite a bit of content, it shouldn't be too hard to do twelve 15 minute episodes for each book. Get on it, Japan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blood Meridian<br>The Sunset Limited as a one-off movie</br></br>  <br>Why is Billy Corgan there?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9uW<wbr>wvQKGjLI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br>Oh hells yeah this</br>  <br>On the Topic of Book covers: The German covers for Malazan are together with the Translation horrific.

You shitting me, FOR REAL? HOLY SHIT!!! Nah but seriously how, when, by whom, MU doesn't list any new chapters out.</br>    <br>It's the mood of the manga. Both Punpun and IB has the same kind of depressing mood and they pull it off well albeit in different ways.<br><br>Thanks though. I admit to not having read the rest of Inio's work, which is weird now that I think about it. I really loved punpun.</br></br></br>  What's that manga about a girl that's trapped in a dream?

Also, shit son whoever that Onizuka guy is I know he's pretty important just because he's in a bunch of colored promotional art work, can't fucking wait now, This made my day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The scanlator says he likes the arc so hopefully we'll at least get this 1 arcs worth of chapters<br><br><br>Thank you, this is some good shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, you'd think it's a popular enough series to find plenty of results in google, but there's none. <br><br>It's Yozakura Quartet.<br><br>Also I'm still upset they didn't bother animating this flashback.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Try Mahou Tsukai no Yome, or Magi no Okurimono (same author as CF).<br><br>Or try Kanojo wa Rokurubi.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks based anon.

I really liked Punpun and mostly enjoyed all chapters about him. But a good half of the manga wasn't about punpun and was instead about other characters I didn't care for.<br><br>I only cared about Punpun, yet I had to trudge through all these boring side characters.<br><br>Manga with a large volume count usually are subject to this kind of treatment, so they are undesirable or not worth it to read when all you want is to focus on the main characters. Its either that or just shitty fillers that mean nothing.</br></br></br></br></br>    I tried on panda thread, but no luck.<br>Can anyone tell me the name of this manga.<br><br>It's not really a hentai. It's about a high school girl in a post-war setting.

However, you simply liking to degrade yourself and enjoying the lowest of fujobaits is not sufficient reason for others to not look down on you. Social control necessarily includes to slap the wrists of those who act retarded.</br>  I kind of like the visuals for the opening, a shame the song is ass.<br><br>The show itself is okay, I guess. 3 episodes and all that.</br></br>  <br>Let's start with yours then.</br>  anyone read the manga?<br>what is twilight about?</br>  <br>ebin</br>  Was there an endcard for episode 1 or did Underwater not leave it in?

I bet you like traps.</br>  So what's the deal with this series? I was seriously disheartened by the first episode, I was pretty much on the verge or dropping this, but Anons kept praising it and saying it's the definite AOTS, so I decided to give the second episode a chance. What a mistake. I thought the fujobait would lessen after the initial exposition in episode 1, but it actually only got worse. Fucking hell, the very first scene is the absolute definition of female powerful bara wet dream.<br> Some bald buff ugly nigger is being a complete jerk and objectifying a woman that's passing by. Fortunately, he bumps into the uber strong white beautiful short bara who is about to fucking destroy the nigger but he doesn't because he is gracious and merciful, and frankly too strong to deal with suck small fries. <br>So pretty much 15 seconds into the episode and I want to barf. Some of the other obvious issues with this piece of shit series:<br> Glorification of prostitution. <br>The author just loves putting prostitutes on a pedestal, which is frankly disgusting. This is not something you can make light of, especially since women all around the world are suffering because of it. It's basically enabling women's suffering and sexual exploitation.<br> The main baddie is a PoC <br>Seriously? This bitch of an author should seriously check her goddamn privilege. Why are all the good guys pretty and white? Hell, one of the MCs is even blonde with blue eyes. Talk about racial stereotypes, golly...<br><br>Add to all that the excessive violence, the objectification of the males characters (all of them are pretty much female power fantasy), the blatant portrayal of women as powerless creatures in a patriarchal society, the constant sexual innuendos, as well as the all other typical fujobait tropes. Really, this must be one of the worst animes made as of recently.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's unpleasant to look at. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>im too lazy to post a bait pic so just imagine i did</br>  <br> marathoning <br> first episode <br>How do you guys even manage to do this without passing out?</br></br></br>  <br>You have issues, if the dude has only a bit, it's kind of sexy. It shows off his virility.</br>  <br> You have issues <br>Being heterosexual?</br></br>  <br>But Nicolas is Asian.</br>  Is there anyone in the credits credited with the sign language research? I'm wondering how accurate this all is.  <br>It's a manga adaptation, idiot.</br>  <br>The faggot doth protest too much. Get out of that closet.</br>  <br>Heterosexual people aren't afraid of men.</br>  <br>how the fuck are these pubic hair? seems more like belly hair. I got them.</br>  <br> "nigger" and "PoC" in the same post <br> misogynist attack on women and SJW-esque defense of women in the same post <br>I don't even</br></br></br>  <br><br>Finding male pubic hair to be aesthetically unappealing = being gay and afraid of men<br>OK.<br>I just don't like looking at aesthetically unappealing things. I figure if I'm going to waste my life away watching anime I might as well at least make it anime that's nice to look at. That's why I always watch any anime by Kyoto Animation, except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But the Free! guys don't have pubic hair, or pubic anything. They are ken dolls.</br>  <br>Your aesthetic sense is so shitty, you are a failure of a human being if the male form cannot be beautiful in some minor way to your eyes. Let me guess, you think other guys' dicks look nasty?</br>  <br> you think other guys' dicks look nasty? <br>Absolutely disgusting.</br></br>  <br>You are gay if you aren't attracted to anime men</br>  <br>Sorry to burst your bubble, but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men.</br>  Was the thread last week as bad as this one?  <br>It was 10 time worse.</br>  <br>Welp, maybe it'll get better later on when the shitposters get bored and move to something that attracts more attention.</br>  Daily reminder that this is undoubtedly the best pairing, and that everyone should hope this happens in the end.  <br> but the sexuality between women can be just as depraved as the sexuality between men. <br>It's at its most fun when it's depraved. Guys are just icky.</br></br>    <br>What if I find penises and vaginas equally disgusting?</br>  <br>Vampires</br>  <br>Cuties :3</br>  When do they fuck?  <br> Soldiers in some war 100 years ago took experimental addictive medicine that made them stronger, unfortunately it also affected their offspring and while they're stronger they also need to take the medicine on a regular basis, have mental or physical defects and only live about 30 years. </br>  <br>Yeah and they spend 2 volumes worth of pages every time he uses sign language to get everything in the Manga.<br><br>Good idea, retard.</br></br></br>  <br>That would never have happened if Umbrella was developing the serum.</br>  <br>You got it wrong. Shaving is gay, body hair is manly.</br>  <br>Yes, the Japanese Federation of the Deaf.</br>  Nina is CUTE.  So... the whore is never ever going to fuck someone again ? That´s like minus 3 points for me.  <br>Nico is like a cool older brother to Nina<br><br>It's pretty fucking cute</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does fuck someone  at the high point of her withdrawal from the TB meds Barry gave her. </br>  <br>so the first episode was really bad but I gave it another one, I don't see how this is going to get better, dropped</br>  <br> Umbrella was on the other side, they lost the war </br>  <br>Ditto. It's shit.</br>  <br>Which one will have to pay for it when they do?</br>  <br> Midget <br><br>Is Nic really a manlet? He doesn't look that short.</br></br></br>    Even Tsutchie can't save this.  <br>169 cm, or 5'5.5" in fat.</br>  <br>The happy trail is pubic hair.</br>  <br>Deaf Moe Muscle Manlet, very nice.<br> Captcha wants me to select the mountains. <br>How insensitive.</br></br></br>  <br> 1.69 <br><br>Poor guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Does being asexual suck? Or is it just whatever?</br>  <br>He's my height! I wonder how much he weighs.</br>  Is this worth watching? The characters look really hot  I want to fuck Nick  <br>He never really grew up, did he?</br>  <br> not knowing it was childish tripe the moment it was announced </br>  Why is a slanty eyed oriental midget called Nicolas?  <br>What's Iskandar doing there?</br>  <br>Likely an alias, or he was adopted by a family that gave him the name.</br>  <br>Disgusting sluts the both of them.</br>  <br>Because  it was probably his mum who was Asian and she was killed by his dad after she gave birth. </br>  typical toonami anime <br><br>Nothing wrong with that. The manga is rad too. Cool to see a good adaption of it. <br><br>Nina a miracle of the universe.</br></br></br></br>  What was that blank paper the doctor gave Nina?  I thought Nina was voiced by HanaKana.  It took me until Worick said 'baby' to realise he is voiced by Junichi Suwabe. It seems so obvious now.  <br><br>Underrated asshole.<br><br>I bet they fuck doggy style too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck, made me laugh.</br>  <br>Fucking hell he is so hot, makes me wonder why I've been fapping to girly twinky 2d boys all this time</br>  <br>He's qter as a shota to be honest.</br>  <br> Woric <br><br>I read that as Wojak</br></br></br>  <br>They're both extremely cute shotas but sometimes I forget I'm attracted to adult males as well</br>  <br>Alex is pure though.</br>  The yaoi hands are strong in this one.    <br> Nico x Nina is better <br> Nico x Worick is better <br> Scarface x arm is better </br></br></br>  <br>She  will be a great fuck in a few years. </br>  <br>I always get really anxious whenever a child shows up in a show like this.<br>Especially after what happened in Black Lagoon, and EVERYTHING that happened in Jormungand.</br></br>   'Gangsta' that look like football players <br><br>No.</br></br>  Wait, it's actually called Gangsta? It's not a joke name /a/ made up? Holy jesus  <br>No, Gangsta is just an acronym</br>  <br> Aoi Yuuki <br>Picked up.</br></br>   All those Nicholas ass shots in the second episode <br>Based Manglobe</br>  <br>We might have filled our damaged children quota with about every character's backstory and all the Twilights.</br>  <br>that made me diamond hard.<br>but he was wrong, she already is!</br></br>  <br><br> except Free!, because half naked men are aesthetically unappealing. <br><br>How is this aesthetically unappealing?<br>You a fag son?</br></br></br></br></br>  So everyone is actually speaking in english, right?  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>Yep. You can expect a decent dub for the amerifats soon.</br>  <br> ottermode is shit <br><br>Get hueg and swole like a bear or a warrior.</br></br></br>  <br>There may be QUALITY, but the ass shots look great.<br>As usual, Manglobe has the best priorities.</br></br>  <br>Worik? More like whore-ik?</br>  <br>I always thought it was Italian, it seems like the show is set in pseudo-Italy.</br>  <br>Nah, it's English. The signs are in English.</br>  <br> As a straight man, I prefer my men to be shaven clean </br>  <br>people speak english in italy. hope you know that</br>  <br>They don't only have signs in English, nice try.</br>  <br>He said  I want to  hold hands with Nina  </br>  <br>Fuck off Nina is pure</br>  Why does he wear eyepatch?  <br>Because he doesn't want to show people his disgusting fucked up eye socket.</br>  <br>Because  his papa burnt his eye with a cigarette. </br>  <br>If this is true, I'm gonna be sad</br>    <br>My god</br>  <br>I wouldn't lie to you, Anon.</br>  <br>It's fine  Nico killed all his abusive family </br>   black tag makes fun of pro tag for using a sword in an age of guns <br> uses his fists and random objects as a weapon <br>:\</br></br>  Could someone tell me what the fuck was going on here?  <br> Did he do that out of spite because Wallace bought out his dad or out of protectiveness/gratitude? I've always wondered. </br>  <br>it's a blank paper, it indicates to the emptiness of her personality, since she's a whore, it's a medical diagnostic</br>  <br>I keep seeing this shota demon, who is he?</br>  <br>Likely  both </br>  <br>Mikhail,  one of the tagged hunters that shows up in volume 4. </br>  <br>Not even</br>  <br> Volume 4 <br><br>Shit. No chances of him showing up in the anime then, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how quickly they progress through the arcs. The mangas later volumes are much more action intense so they can choose to draw it out or shorten it.</br>  <br> He already did show up, anon. </br>  <br><br>Well shit, guess I'll have to read the mango</br></br>  why does noto mamiko only get roles where she's beaten and violated now?<br><br>what happened to her career?</br></br>  <br>Yeah that was fuggin regarded</br>  <br>It wouldn't be nice if they just rushed everything though. <br><br>Kinda wanted to wait till the anime was over, but, fuck it. I'll read the manga.<br><br><br>Where?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Check out the silhouettes in the big black weeaboo slaying scene.  If it was just the one silhouette it wouldn't be clear, but he's very often featured with another lead character who matched up with the other person in that scene. </br>  <br>Dummy.</br>   Literal powerlevels <br>well this escalated quickly</br>  <br>lol this.<br>So a B ranked just got absolutely destroyed by an A. Didnt realize A&gt;B massively. <br><br>Where is the S rank</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should. Didn't Worick dream in this episode? It was in chapter 2 in the manga. Probably a change for the better though.</br>  <br>Ginger is the only S rank that we know of so far. S/5.</br>  <br>A/0 is meant to be the highest rank but  Nico is also called "faker" because he gained his rank by beating higher ranked people than him and he overdoses on that drug to give himself a boost/edge when fighting. In reality he's closer to a B/4 </br>  Do we know how long this one will be? One cour or two?  <br>I completely forgot about that they were in this scene in the manga.</br>    I love Mikhail but he seems kinda out of place sometimes.  What the fuck is wrong with these guys? Who straight up drinks this shit?  <br>He has brain problems.</br>  <br>Europe</br>  <br>During the '80s that shit was like champagne.</br>  fujoshit  <br> I said it again! </br>  <br>but his brother and mother didn't even do shit</br>  <br>this is so moe I can't stand it</br>  <br> Junichi Suwabe <br>I had no idea at all till he went full dandy either.</br></br>  <br> They might not have done shit but they didn't exactly try and stop the abusive father either. I mean, Wallace had bruises 90% of the time, usually visible ones and he was pretty much secluded from them. </br>  <br><br>Is it okay to be homo for SuwaJun?</br></br>  <br>No. It's okay if you're GAR for him, though.</br>  <br>S rank move so fast they almost teleport</br>  I would read an entire series about these two as shotas.  <br>Yes</br>  <br>Shota Nic is the fucking cutest, jesus christ</br>  <br>The B rank was B-2, while Nico was A-0.<br>So it's not just one power level, it's however many the highest number is +2.</br></br>  <br>He's only Asian on his mom's side.</br>  <br>Retard moe.</br>  <br>She's around. If they get far into adapting then you'll see them at the tail end of the broadcast.</br>  <br>me too I want him to hold me gently and mutter obscenities at me</br>  <br>Nic is made for cuddling.</br>  <br>It's superior nipponesian bait folded over a million times<br>there's at least 2^1 000 000 layers to the bait</br></br>  <br>Yes. Body hair's normal, shaving your nuts and stomach is fucking weird. Or waxing or whatever you fairies do. Flipping out over a man not having groomed his pubic area to your liking can only mean you're a giant fucking faggot.</br>  <br>So what were they doing if not fucking?</br>  <br>Epilating is superior to both.<br><br>Just saying.</br></br></br>  <br>Worick was having a shower and Alex was puttering about and answering calls.</br>  There is no excuse to make this into a proper anime now right?  <br>Same. They're so cute and I really like their character designs</br>  <br>Only the very beginning was good.</br>  So how about that naked Worick in the OP?  <br>Spin it around so Shouko-chan is a cold-ass killer for hire besides the regular stuff in the manga and you got something.</br>  What is the deal with Dogtags?<br>What is are the Twilights?<br>What are the pills for?</br></br>  <br>Read either the manga or this thread.</br>  <br> &gt;Twilight (黄昏, Koukon) is the title given to the children and descendants of those who used the Celebre drug. While Ergastulum was created to control and house Twilights due to an influx of them after the war, they are still a source of controversy. Anti-Twilight factions are prominent in the city despite pro-Twilight support from three of the four Big Fathers.<br><br> From birth, they are registered and controlled using tags embedded with chips that monitor their vital signs. Thus, they are also known as "Tagged". These tags also have their rank - speculated to be a measure of the Twilight's strength - with D/5 (the default) being the lowest and S/0 the highest. After a Twilight's confirmed death, they are automatically deleted from their category and their family registration. Every record of their existence is erased. <br><br> Celebrer can be administered via three methods: pills, injections or bullets. Twilights require a controlled, continued amount of Celebrer in order to stay alive, as it maintains their vital functions and negates pain. Failure to regularly take Celebrer results in withdrawal symptoms, including dizzy spells, nausea, palpitations and migraines. More severe cases include haemorrhages, convulsions, hypothermia, hallucinations, laboured breathing and other irregularities in cardiopulmonary activity--after a certain amount of time, death occurs. Because a Twilight must take Celebrer to control their withdrawal symptoms, it's assumed that if a Twilight has children, they will also be Twilights. </br></br></br></br> </br>  <br>They're for identifying fellow Twilights.<br>Humans and the children of humans who were experimented on in a government supersoldier program.<br>Medication, it gives them strength and stamina greater than the average human and it also prevents them from seizure and cardiac arrest that will occur if they don't take them. Basically meant to control them.</br></br></br>  I just watched the opening on youtube<br>is this Fujishit?<br>kinda looks like it from the op, just half naked men getting dressed</br></br>  <br>Do you epilate your pubic hair?</br>  <br><br><br><br>So basically, nanomachine</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Now leave.</br>  <br>But a anime movie is already confirmed....</br>  <br>Yeah its hardcore gay sex every episode</br>  <br> just half naked men getting dressed <br> hurr fujoshit <br><br>Go back to hibike thread faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br> getting mad on the internet </br>  <br>Yeah bro, it comes with a sensitive area cap for that purpose. (And for armpits.)</br>  <br>I really hope they go for anime original plot. The manga was pure, unfiltered shit towards the end.</br>  <br>i dont know be hes doind an illuminati sign at the end</br>  <br>You are the strongest person alive if true</br>  <br>Hibike is fujoshit too</br>  <br>This girl is so sexy</br>  <br>It helps if you do it under the shower. Hurts less than waxing too.</br>  Prostitute of not, I'd fuck Alex hard.  <br>It is.</br>  <br>Enjoy your AIDS.</br>  <br><br> Alleyway City  <br> The woman are useless <br> The men are beautiful  <br><br>I'd like this show more if it had an actual setting or world building</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already have it, so no big deal.</br>    underwater gangsta <br>Cinderblocks?</br>  Finished the first episode. The OP was disappointing, but I'm digging the music. ED is pretty dope, too. Bit of a slow start, but I imagine they've got some set-up to do, so I'll see how it pans out.    <br>It's a slum city because it was originally meant to be a quarantine for all the Twilights like Nico.</br>  <br>Yeah, the music is pretty top tier. Really chill.</br>  <br>Is every thread going to be full of posts like this? Why are straightfags so fucking retarded? If I want to avoid a series with female fanservice I just google it and check the tags/genre/reviews.</br>  <br><br>so it's set in Australia?</br></br>  <br>Might as well be.</br>  <br><br>Fucking this.<br><br>Let me just info dump to this cum dumpster she clearly cares. <br><br>is the manga this bad?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What chapter was this again?</br>   Nic's face   <br>Like a bad Elvis impersonation</br>  <br>Chapter 10, but it's not even on-screen, Anon.</br>  <br>Is that neymar</br>  <br>No wait, it's chapter 11.</br>  <br>Thanks for telling me, even if it doesn't show</br>  <br>are you deaf?</br>  <br>I think it was him giving her a clean slate.

Now fuck off.</br>  <br>Episode 2<br><br>623 notes<br>532 notes<br>509 notes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I dont browse Tumblr so i have no idea what youre talking about</br>  <br><br>it's symbolism. <br><br>Ergastulum <br><br> in ancient Rome, a private workhouse for slaves. Ergastula were built underground on the villas of slaveholders or, less often, in city dwellings. Slaves kept there were shackled and were overseen by other slaves. In ancient Rome, the word “ergastulum” sometimes referred to all the slaves on an estate. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Non Non Biyori &gt; Glasslip &gt; Gangsta  <br>The only homo action we get are lesbos.</br>  <br>Gangsta: Popular on Tumblr</br>  <br>you stay<br>I go<br>no following</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is up with people covering their face before they shoot someone?</br>  Just finished episode 2. Pretty cool, I guess. I like the slower pace and the long stretches between music -- gives the city a very desolate sort of atmosphere.<br><br>Fights could be better. Kind of remind me of Samurai Champloo in the way they're cut and arranged but not nearly as well-executed.<br><br>Too early to make judgments on characters and plot yet. I'll stick with it for now.<br><br>But fuck me that music is so fucking good. Easily the best thing about the series thus far.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's crying.<br>Also<br> wanting blood to splatter on your face </br></br></br>  <br>She was crying</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127852615 <br> They like anything with brown women in it, nothing new.</br>  <br>To be fair, Alex is pretty moe</br>  <br>And edgy fujoshibait</br>  <br> not getting mad when you see faggots like that <br><br>Anon, you might be gay.</br></br></br>  <br> blood spattering out of an entry wound <br>clearly you haven't been on liveleak enough</br></br>  <br> dropping on episode 1 <br><br>Holy shit this has to be bait</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't understand how you are not able to recognize his voice as soon as he speaks. <br>He has one of those voices.<br>Like OnoD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>why would i get mad when the anon just asked a question?<br>he even said he didn't see the show</br></br>  Every time Nicolas speaks my sides go into orbit.  <br>I think I'm in love</br>  <br>Nothing</br>  When was the last time we have had an anime this interesting and different?  Moe.<br><br>Anyone make a webm of Nic reaching for his missing tags?</br></br>  So when are we going to see the S/0's<br><br>I mean it's japan the moment you see A Ranks you know a master S rank will be there</br></br>  <br>The only known S/0 was the original Paulklee so doubtful we'll ever get to see one.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>   matching tattoos     <br> The only known S/0 is Adolph Paulklee the founder of the Paulklee Guild in Ergastulum. Currently the guild is being led by Gina Paulklee whose rank is unknown. As far as S ranks go, the manga's only shown/confirmed one and that's, S/5 rank Ginger, member of the guild, and the sleeping lesbo in  </br>  <br>How big is the powergap between an A/0 and S/5?</br>  Best boy when  <br><br>Drunk visit to the tattoo parlor when?</br></br>  <br> matching tattoos <br> isn't a fujoshi show <br> no homo </br></br></br>  <br> The manga hasn't really shown a full blown fight between an A/0 and a S, but you can only assume the gap is significant considering what Nic did to the B/2 with relative ease. </br>  Man, Alex is a fucking whore  Knowing nothing about the manga I was pleasantly surprised by how likeable the two main characters are. Cute loli nurse is a bonus. I sort of thought this was gonna be a shitty grimdark blood and guts type thing, and so far it is, but at least is has some fun elements.  <br>But B/2 to A/0 is quite a gap, but A/0 to S/5 is just one step.</br>  <br>anon you don't have a matching tattoo with your best bro?</br>  <br>Welp vol 7 of the manga went on sale in Nipland today, so maybe we'll find out soon.</br>  <br> She's so fast Nic was swinging his sword and she appeared a meter behind him. Erica and Mikhail ran when she appeared. She tends to end fights quickly so we haven't seen how powerful she is yet. </br>  <br> matching tattoo with your best "bro" </br>    <br>So basically it's like Deus-Ex all over again? <br><br>I kinda like that concept though.</br></br></br>  <br>She'd be a great fuck now.</br>  <br>Nicholas is the perfect blend of strangely cute and badass.</br>  Underwater vs Horriblesubs - quality of subs<br><br>/a/ go</br></br>  <br>Watch it raw</br>  <br>I like brown women</br>  <br><br>Why don't you go back there then?</br></br>  <br>On one hand I got drunk and branded myself with the rest of me company on my ass so I feel like I'm justified calling you a retard. <br><br>On the other hand the military is really fucking gay so I'm not going to</br></br></br>  <br>HS is using funi's subs, why are you even asking.</br>  So wait, is Big Boss superhuman too ? If yes do he reveal his power level ?  <br>you lose /u/<br>yuribait</br></br>  Another shit episode. Well, one left.  AOTS easily  Those lips. <br>Those titties.<br><br>So no more lewd from Alex?<br><br>Damn shame.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's too late.</br>  <br> HS </br>  <br>Those lips were made for blowjobs, and those tits for paizuri.</br>  <br>She dress like a whore, so I'm sure that there will be more lewd.</br>  <br>doujins when</br>  designs are too homo for me.  <br><br>It's funny because the first time I saw gangsta posted in a rec thread a couple years ago I immediately thought it was a new hentai by ShindoL</br></br>  <br> on your ass <br>How do you explain that to your boyfriend?</br></br>  <br> rec thread <br><br>At least call them One page or manga thread, anon. You can't use that word here.</br></br></br>  <br>Best boy is Delico-chan.</br>  After /a/ claimed this was fujoshit i started to notice the undertones<br><br>Why did you fuckers ruin this for me</br></br>  <br><br>No, I distinctly remember it starting as a thread asking for recomendations and it derailed into the average OPT of no source giving porn crops to troll the OP. That's why I assumed at the time Gangsta was ShindoL.</br></br>  <br> After /a/ claimed this was fujoshit i started to notice the undertones <br><br>THere are no undertones m8, if you perceive any it's because  you are a fujo </br></br></br>  <br>I'll just go back to my Monster Musume thread</br>  <br>Indeed, there are no undertones. Its straight genuine in your face gay show.</br>  <br>Weird. I rarely see rec threads now, since they usually get quickly deleted. I guess, mods were really asleep then.</br>  <br> Literally useless person with no redeeming qualities other than body. <br> Treated nicely and taken care of by two handsome men <br> Has to do nothing in return, or work for herself <br><br>Yeah. Definitely written by a woman.  nice self insert </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can see your panties.</br>  <br>She answers the phone and cooks and has a nice voice,  later on she gets a gig as a singer at some fancy whorehouse and it's implied she's going to stay there. </br>  <br>I love this attitude. 95% of series feature guys who have chicks fall all over their dicks and no one ever complains about it because as guys it appeals to us. But when they switch it up suddenly it's the shittiest thing to ever exist.</br>  <br> because it appeals to us <br><br>You are a woman.</br></br></br>  <br>N-NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>Just ignore him for fucks sake.</br>  <br>I mean actual fucking.</br>  <br>Perrier is good m8.<br> pls buy </br></br>  <br>Too soon mang</br>  NINA A CUTE.  <br>  fall all over their dicks and no one ever complains <br> because it appeals to us <br> /a/ <br><br>oh shut the fuck up slut-dere</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>NINA A GOOD FUCK IN 10 YEARS</br>  <br>Isn't she like 14?<br>You can make that 4 years.</br></br>  <br>Man this was only good scene and we will never get something like this again. That´s just cheating, i already got hooked up when i was just hoping for some more of this.<br><br><br><br>Why do whores always end up being a cabaret singer ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nina is 12.</br>  <br>Still legal in my country, was really being considerate of /a/mercans</br>  <br>She's the fucking secretary you moron. Later on, if the anime follows the manga, she answers the phone in the office, cooks, and helps with various jobs from delivery to  fixing up Connie's shop  Please stop being a retard and fuck off</br>  <br>Do you live in Eastern Europe?</br>  I can't be the only one who bops my head to the OP.<br>It's just so UNTZ UNTZ UNTZ</br>  <br>Go b8 elsewhere.</br>  <br>except no guys are falling all over her pussy, they are literally just babysitting her because fujo.

It's 12 down there? 16 where I live. I feel like that's the ideal age.</br>  <br>Ah. Still, fucking a 12 year old is pretty scummy.

Only thing I'm disappointed about is that this is handled by Manglobe. The story isn't that strong so the animation should be the appeal but it's only okay, nothing outstanding. There are some nice key frames but more than not lots of QUALITY. Well, as long as it doesn't get worse than this, I can deal.  <br>Lurk more.</br>   classes <br>fucking dropped.</br>  <br>So he'll be mostly irrelevant when tags are involved? Sad.</br>  Are you ready for the crappy ending of 2wei Herz?<br><br> Where Miyu is captured to another world. </br></br>  I can't wait for the doujin and lewd images from pixiv.  <br>Isn't there supposed to be a 2wei OVA?</br>  <br>It was delayed until July 25th.<br><br>Also the new season starts July 24th and new chapter of 3rei comes out July 26th.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm waiting for Gil myself.</br>  <br> All they have left is the fight against Gil <br>They can't do 13 episodes of this unless they go into 3rei</br></br>  <br/>    Who is the VA of Ko-Gil?  <br>It's 10 episodes again.</br>  Any chance of getting delicious Angelica animated?  <br>Best bet is just at the end where they world transfer over.</br>  <br>We should get a cameo of her and Thor-chan as they show up to get Miyu and the others to Ainsworth world at the end</br>  It's 10 episodes again, right? Do they have enough content?  <br>They can pad it out with some of the side chapters from 3rei.</br>  <br>If they make a cliffhanger end  and announce 3rei , yes<br><br>they used 16 of 27 manga chapter in the first part, they need to use Side chapters of zwei and drei (like Rin remember kid Shiro) and add more fanservice/extra Scenes (Like Luvia Butler v/s Bazet )</br></br></br>  <br> bigger bust than Leys <br><br>Oy vey<br><br> Why the fuck are Luvia's measurements still unknown </br></br></br></br></br>  Will we get this chapter?  I'm surprised you guys are so sure that SL would do 3rei. It's obvious that they enjoy animate the cute lolis / fanservice part of Prisma the most while battle is just side dish, 3rei is the opposite with pretty much non-step action so I doubt they even have the budget for it to not look like shit.  Why are all the best Type-moon not written by Nasu?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they went with an anime original ending to the series. Beyond what you said, 3rei is a big investment. It's as long as 2wei at this point and it keeps on going, so that's two whole seasons to factor in.</br>  <br>When is Gil going to appear? mid-seasonish? I don't follow the manga beyond spoiler pages in Fate threads but I've heard good things about the Gil alter (?) fight.</br>  <br>Endou Aya if they keep the old VA.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for them to exploit Kuro's underlying pranalust for Gil</br>  <br>They can make a original ending for zwei and if they make drei they can make a original start episode (like they need to check the zone where Illya fight gil)</br>  <br>I hope you're not talking about Prisma here. Other than fanservice for TM audience and pedophiles, this series has nothing else to offer. Flat characters, failed attempt at serious plot in 3rei, aweful humor.</br>  <br>He's the final boss of 2wei<br><br>Then he becomes a protagonist in 3rei and eventually peaces out because the writers didn't know what to do with him anymore</br></br></br>  <br> The first to tip a fedora </br>  <br>Aside from the beach shenanigans, the rest of 2wei is fighting against Gil, there's a couple of good fights, especially the one involving Bazett.<br>The fight people usually talk about is one of Ko-Gil vs an homunculus using his card in 3rei.</br></br>  <br>That is a good option, we won't be left with a cliffhanger and they can still start 3rei later if they feel like it. I prefer them to gather enough budget before touching 3rei at all.<br><br>However if they didn't go to the alternative world right after the fight then what would to Gil and his card?</br></br></br>  <br>He's been way for like one chapter, just give it time, I'm sure him and Kotomine are up to something.</br>  <br>I feel like they're going to make KoGil show up for more than he did in the manga, in terms of not being his Alter form and talking to Illya and the crew. I feel like they'll add a few scenes for him.</br>  <br>It's so weird that he just left like that. At the start I thought him and Kirei were scheming something together for sure but nothing came out of it. Part 3 sure have lots of anti-climax situations.</br>  <br><br><br>Man Ilya a cute</br></br></br>  <br>The first priority right now is info dumping, we really don't know a lot about what the fuck happened in that last fight. Then I'm sure some Gil and Kirei shenanigans will happen.</br>  <br> info dumping <br>I was really expecting this, but when I was rereading the manga I realize there's really not much to tell, Miyu has already given quite a lot of information during the 3 series.  Miyu's Kiritsugu is dead, for example. </br></br>  <br>Still better than drei. Shit goes more over the edge forgetting about sol parts and fanservice. I got into this for lolis not this holy grail bullshit again.</br>    Next chapter when?  <br> Flat characters, <br><br>You mean delicious flat characters.</br></br></br>  <br>26th.</br>  <br>That's an impressively-sized black knight greatsword.</br>  this and carnival phantasm are the only good things to come from the TM franchise  <br>Or they can just adapt as is since 3rei has a potential for more character goods.</br>  <br>Why does Miyu looks so serious there? She's surrounded by Illyas in slutty clothes, that's like her heaven.</br>  So well get<br><br> Episode 1: Beach Party <br> Episode 2: Attack on MudGil, end with him breaking free <br> Episode 3: Attack on MudGil pt2, with ZweiForm Illya <br> Episode 4: Drawback into the parallelworld <br><br>?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br> Miyu's puffy vulva outline  <br>Lewd</br></br>  <br>Miyu is without a doubt the lewdest Prisma.</br>  <br><br><br>Is this the first time takeuchi has drawn miyu?</br></br></br>    <br> not Kuro <br>Kuro is also a slut.</br></br>  <br> Mimi most popular among Illya's friends <br> Illya, Kuro, and Miyu head and shoulders above everyone else <br>All is right with the world.</br></br></br>  <br> Rin above Luvia  <br><br>Legit great taste from Japan for once.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Illya</br>  <br> best girl in a three way tie for last <br>Fuck you two, Japan.</br></br>  <br> two <br>Time for bed.</br></br>  <br>OHOHOHO Rin pleases studio staffs for votes!</br>  <br>Jesus Christ is her pussy trying to eat its way out of her clothes?</br>  <br>They skipped some shit from 2wei already though. I just want the Shirou beach episode, dammit.</br>    <br> Shirou beach episode <br>I'm sure they can still adapt that.</br></br>  <br>I think I'm getting my timeline mixed up. The beach is pretty much right after the first Bazette fight, right?</br>  <br>wont it be the first episode?</br>  <br>They already showed a bit of it in the trailer.</br>  <br>Most people are just waiting for the shit that happens after this season especially Shirou, Gil, Kotomine, and all the other husbandos<br><br>Although the Extra chapters are probably the ones people want the most.</br></br></br>  <br>Tatsuko doesn't have nearly enough votes.</br>    <br>They'll probably skip around some parts though. I'm pretty sure Shirou is not as prominent in the anime as he is in the manga.</br>  Who do you think they're going to pick to eventually voice Tanaka? I could actually see  Chiaki Omigawa  working out.  <br> Fate／kaleid liner PRISMAILLYA.zip  https://mega.nz/#!TwtU1LCJ!7_4QMbN3<wbr>YHZli4W_IaHXva4QNSfc4i8t8WjwO3PoRfo<wbr></wbr></wbr> <br>Complete up-to-date manga.</br></br>  <br> doujin-artist-turned-mangaka is more skilled than a longtime professional VN character designer <br>Takeuchi needs to step it up and move beyond his same-face problems already. It's been over a decade now and he gets more work than ever.</br></br>  Where was Miyu during UBW?  <br> to another world <br>Yeah, to a world of some actual fucking proper action. Ikuzo, motherfuckers!</br></br>  <br>Probably was never born or died in the fire.</br>  <br>wait so shirou the fucker had a lil sis called miyu that died in the fire and he forgot?<br><br><br>That would be some serious plot twist</br></br></br></br>  <br>We don't know. She's never mentioned anywhere outside of Prisma. She might have simply not existed.</br>  <br>Someone should abduct the writers of both fate and prisma illya and hold them hostage until they answered all of /a/´s questions</br>  Next ch is finally supposed to address Miyu and her Shirou's past right?  <br>Yep. Should be a doozy. It's got a lot to cover.</br>  <br>yup<br><br>wanna see more imouto-miyu</br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought in F/SN Shirou mentioned a Sister who died in the fire.</br></br>  <br>If he does, I certainly don't remember. Hardly anything on his life before the fire is brought up.</br>  <br><br>If memory serves, he was taking about walking through the park where his house used to be.<br><br>Fuck knows what route that was though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter because Miyu is basically the Type-Moon verse equivalent of xxxHOLiC's Watanuki; exist just to be the suffering substitute.</br>  <br>so Miyu is this?<br><br><br>fine with that</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't watch it for the plot</br>  will there be much luvia in this one? I'm hoping appearing in the ubw anime will increase her popularity.  <br>I should reread 3rei now that I've actually played a bit of the first Dark Souls. See what I missed.</br>  So, 2wei finished the Bazett stuff. Wasn't that pretty much the end of 2wei, with the whole Gil and Miynapping being almost directly after?<br><br>Also, they better animate the fujo chapter. Illya and Kuro's reactions to Mimi being a closet Fujo were priceless.</br></br>  Look  <br>And</br>    <br>Are they adapting the swimsuit shopping episode?</br>  <br>i hope so!</br>  <br>They showed it in the pv.</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TeV<wbr>W6O1C8g0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br><br>Crunchy made a lot of that sort of mistake in both Prisma and UBW. Apparently the word for "association" and the word for "church" are the same in Japanese, and the people translating this shit aren't actually that familiar with the Nasuverse.</br></br>  <br> association" and the word for "church" are the same in Japanese, <br>How does that make sense? They're different organizations.</br></br>  <br>教会 refers to the Church. 協会 refers to the Association. Both are pronounced "kyoukai".</br>  <br><br>Seems like a common mistake. Manga scans did the exact same thing.</br></br>  <br>Probably because "church" is a more common word in casual Japanese than "association."<br><br>Then again, anyone familiar with Bazett's character knows she works for the Association, not the Church.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is the person in the bottom left panel?</br>  Delicious.  <br>Rin.</br>    <br>Goddamn it Ruby.</br>  <br>This is obscenely lewd.</br>    <br>Illegally lewd.</br>   Psycho kid want to play detective <br> Murder is fun <br> Sensei is in love with me <br>Why is this allowed on TV?</br></br></br>  Why aren't there more cute boy MCs  <br><br>I want to break his boy pussy.</br></br>    Because he will be the final boss of this anime.  <br><br>Thank god I'm not the only one who thought he was nuts. Seriously, who the hell calmly walks away from a murder scene like that?</br></br>  <br>  who the hell calmly walks away from a murder scene like that? <br>Psycho kids and chuunis</br></br>  <br>dropped this bullshit since episode 1</br>  ep 2 was so bad <br>So some first time ever seen megane girl wanted to be a chair <br>Case closed , ace detective!<br><br>And some idiots on mal think this is good series.</br></br></br></br>  There were some good ideas in there, but it seemed too "anime-ish" for an adaptation of a classic horror novel or short story. So I looked the original story The Human Chair up and read the plot summary. It's a very different story, and the summary alone got my hairs to stand up when I got to the end. <br><br>I need to read this guys stuff.<br><br>Anyways, it looks like the anime is a mash up of a lot of his works told from the perspective of a boy who tries to solve the crimes. And if this show ends and the MC isn't revealed to be a reverse trap I'm calling bullshit. That's not a fucking boy.</br></br></br></br>   Wanna get rekt by this cock?   op song's good<br>everything else is p boring</br>  <br> mayonegg </br>  Those chairs actually looked pretty comfy.  Always pick up a show a bit late every season that makes me wonder how many gems I miss each season.  Pretty fun anime. Not sure why but it reminds me a little of Kyousogiga.  <br> So I looked the original story The Human Chair up and read the plot summary. It's a very different story, and the summary alone got my hairs to stand up when I got to the end.  <br>This is probably the biggest problem with Ranpo Kitan(well, aside Kishi's inconsistent and ugly decisions when it comes to visuals). When you read a novel about people being turned into furniture, it can be legit creepy. But in this anime it just turns out to be silly, starting from Kishi's comedy that just doesn't fit in there. <br><br>But it has insane boypussy so I keep watching</br></br></br></br>  <br> Seriously, who the hell calmly walks away from a murder scene like that? <br>/a/ is the last place I'd expect to find a reason to do a perspective check.</br></br>  This slut.  <br>It feels like the main cast characters were written by the edgiest teen-angst faggot they could find. Dropped.</br>  Because Edogawa Rampo is a national treasure, you philistine.  <br>I feel like a lot of you take things way too seriously. What ever happened to just enjoying a show?</br>  <br>babby's first mystery?<br>The gore is just there to upset the viewer. You're supposed to think shota is a weird fuck, thats the whole reason for the megane so that he can be like STOP HAVING FUN THIS IS MURDER ITS SERIOUS.</br></br>  <br>I uploaded a book with The Human Chair to the goddess last week, if you wanna read it. It's under /Novels/Edogawa Rampo</br>  Was Kobayashi a better character in the novels? Because he's annoying right now.  This kid knows he's seducing everyone, probably knows that glasses wants his boypussy too, but he doesn't care and just wants to tease. Can't wait for NTR doujins where he gets drugged and gangbanged, loving every second of it.  <br>thx</br>  <br> take things way too seriously <br>Where do you think you are?<br><br><br>Oh, I've watched plenty of mysteries. You're just defending this drivel because of boy pussy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw season's best girl is a boy </br>      <br>They just borrowed the names. It's safe to say this is an original anime.</br>  I don't care about your shitty mysteries. <br><br>Where's the porn?</br></br>  <br>My dick</br>  <br> no bulge <br>it's shit</br></br>  <br>The summary made my heart pound. What a great piece of storytelling. And instead, we got this.</br>  <br> Th-That's some kind of sexual reference, right? </br>  <br>You didn't suspect her?<br>The other students were only aware that the body was somehow dismembered, only the suspect knew that someone made a shape out of the parts.</br></br>  <br>Where's the dick?</br>  <br>He's tucking, like a true trap.</br>  <br>pixiv<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51288604</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>夏だね</br>  <br>Fresh delivery. I chuckled.</br>  Look how fucking cute he is, This is why it's allowed.  <br>reminder that nothing changes during summer</br>  <br>Go be a faggot somewhere else, Lulu.</br>  <br>I know, I just like the  meme .</br>    <br>Feels proper to me.</br>     Adults are idiots! <br> Police are useless. <br> Only us intelligent teens can solve the mystery! </br></br>  <br>Everyone is just siluets and don't even have characters<br>There no mystery and no fun</br></br>  <br> Police are useless. <br>Sounds about right.</br></br>  Is this implying murder in Kagami's future?  <br>To be honest I don't think anyone was expecting the teacher to be a pedo</br>  <br>Pants up, don't loot.</br>  <br>Odds of sensei winning?</br>  <br>Megane is gonna win you faggot</br>  <br>Generic edgy-shonen shit.</br>  <br>Sensei is dead.</br>  <br>So did the previous teacher.</br>  <br> previous </br>  <br>No, you autist. I'm referring to the dead one</br>  Sooooooo <br><br>The new teacher qualifies as a christmas cake, right? She's 32.</br></br>  <br>You're the autist. Everybody wants to fuck him. Man or woman, you simply aren't human if you don't want to.</br>  <br>Different anon, but not everyone is closet-homosexuals like /a/.</br>  <br> faggots on /a actually thought the new teacher was Akechi in disguise </br>  <br>Holy shit he's crazy</br>  <br>This, it'd be refreshing to watch an anime where the MC is 30-something and expected to be capable.<br>But hey, in this case we got a cute trap, so I'm not complaining.</br></br>  <br> not everyone is a closet-homosexual <br> denies being homosexual, effectively making him a closetfag <br>Embrace it anon, embrace the boypussy.</br></br></br>  <br>If you had no idea what his gender was you'd say 100 percent he was a girl.</br>  You will never be turned into a chair by the person you love.<br>Why even live?</br>  <br> wide hips <br> cute face <br> girly voice <br>And we're gay for liking female qualities?<br>Okay.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think I'd make a comfortable chair.</br>  Was I the only one who couldn't buy the bullshit about girls wanting to be to killed and turned into chairs? I'm sure you can find one girl that might be insane enough to do that, but a whole garage of them? It was shit and they could have come up with something better.  <br> it'd be refreshing to watch an anime where the MC is 30-something and expected to be capable. <br>Gangsta is airing this season. And it's shit.<br><br>But there's always Black Lagoon, and Baccano and the like.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Go watch GiTS and Psycho-Pass, son.</br>  <br>So you're saying it's fine as long as it's a feminine penis?</br>  <br>B-but I like big breasted American women, anon-kun.<br><br><br>I would. Can't change the fact that they drew him as a girl and gave him a female VA.<br><br><br>We all know that you're just attracted to his penis.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest everyone except Hashiba feels insane here. Sensei cuts herself, detectives are more or less crazy, Kobayashi is obvious. The ones who seem green to Kobayashi have normal mentality, until he sees something interesting about them such as sensei's cut marks. So there must be something about Hashiba too that doesn't make him boring to Kobayashi, maybe he has big dick.</br>  <br>I think you already hold the answer to that within your heart, Teiki-kun.</br>  <br>No, I'm not JUST attracted to his penis.</br>  Ep 1 was a solid 7/10 for me<br><br>But this one was so dumb and uninspiring.<br>It feels like they took all the things that make<br>mysteries good and shoved them out the window.<br>Awful characterization and motivations.</br></br></br></br></br>   teacher secretly wanted his boipussy <br> killer wasn't foreshadowed at all and only appeared in one scene before this <br> that fucking retarded motivation </br></br>    <br>I'm not sure what this anime is trying to be, but it's certainly not clever mystery solving, It's all going to be ass-pulls at the end of each second episode.</br>  <br>Precisely</br>  It's sure isn't perfect but we don't get good mystery detective shows that often, so I'm enjoying it for what it is.  <br> I'm not sure what this anime is trying to be, <br>Aside from fujobait?<br>I'm gonna stick with this, it's almost Another tier.</br></br></br>  <br>No silly on-screen deaths so far, though.</br>  <br>That explain everything</br>  why  Which character and fanbase do you think got BTFO in most brutal way in the series? Pic related is my choice.  <br>Because when ever they use that it's always followed by some nonsensical babble that doesn't make sense.<br><br>I've only seen it start to pop up in Yahari threads, It needs to be blacklisted from /a/ because every time you see someone use it, The post is a shit post.</br></br></br>  <br>Every girl except Chihiro in TWGOK</br>  <br>I wonder</br>  <br>Glorious Slaine suffering.</br>  <br><br><br>My niggas.</br></br></br>  Why doesn't Dawn wear panties?  <br>Because she is the best pokegirl</br>  Serena &gt; Hikari &gt; Haruka &gt; Kasumi &gt; Iris    <br><br>I want to hug her ;_;</br></br>  <br><br>Image dumping isn't discussion. Post this shit on /c/.</br></br>  The Gardening Club episode was pretty good. Which club will they help out next week? Maybe Kurumi will have a new item depending on which club the episode is about (Shovel for the Gardening Club, Baseball Bat for the Baseball club etc).<br><br>Anyways, what did you think of episode 1?</br></br>  <br>Maybe they killed her too and shes a vengeful spirit only Yuki can see because shes giving everyone else the cold shoulder for killing her.</br>  Since people seem to theorize that shovel is half zombie, have they taken more of the medicine with them after they left school, I forgot.<br><br><br>The only sane one  Rii </br></br></br>  <br> she's basically disposable goods at that point anyways. <br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Shovel arts, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids with the shovel squad on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills with the shovel.
