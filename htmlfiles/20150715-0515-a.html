The major bummer of e-hentai has always been how they treat tags like some precious special resource that takes tons of space, rather then something effectively free. Unlike the booru's for example EH hates having precision in tags, so it's fine if you want everything but if you want to drill down to get something specific it sucks. Since they have lots of stupid "defaults" rather then having a blank slate be a default it can be hard to eliminate things if you don't want those defaults.<br><br>Not that the booru's are perfect either, there's a lot of room for improvements in metadata in general. I'd love to see something next gen put together with full multidimensinoal graph plugin and the like. But for flat lists the booru's are a ton better then EH.

I would love to see how much of certain tags I have in my collection. My collection is getting pretty big so if want to change the way I organize I'll likely need to do it soon.

You drag and drop your collection and then set the tags by Ex url or searching by the filename. It takes a while to get everything tagged up at first if you have a large collection but it's well worth the effort in my opinion</br>  <br>I get disappointed everyday.</br>  do you think this is a fucking game?  <br>Yet despite that rule, I see so much shit marked with 'anal' for something that only shows up on one page, sometimes if at all, and half of the time it's something like a buttplug or beads.</br>  Why is "confined space" not a tag? You know those "stuck in a locker" doujins, all great.  <br><br>That's why something like smegma was given such a low presence because it tends to only be in a few panels, maybe 2 pages at most unless we're talking about a tank.</br></br>  <br>Apparently I once searched for furryshit because that showed up somehow. I should clear history and then kill myself.<br><br>I mostly browse the front pages anyway.  Don't need tags when you check often enough to look over all releases. </br></br></br>    <br>I wouldn't have to look up so much gay shit if tg stuff wasn't so fucking scarce.</br>  <br>That is not how you search the mind break tag.</br>  Am i doing this right lads?  <br>Use more direct tags.</br>  <br>Excellent<br><br><br>A fellow Asheman.<br><br><br>It is good taste though.<br><br><br>Cancer</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    How do you guys sort your collection?

There's new characters that add diversity. There's a fair amount of action and high tension scenes. I don't see the issue.</br>  <br>I only read the official translation, so I'm not done yet. But I don't see a problem with animating another 4-5 books.</br>  <br>For starters a Pokémon gen 1-2 anime based on the games Yellow and Crystal. 25 episodes each generation. Full shown gym leader battles with backstory and side quests like SS Anne (with theme included), Safari Zone, Silph Co., Pokémon Mansion, Cerulean Cave and Pokémon Tower in Kanto. It would end with Red beating an adapted league, like in the Ashnime but with the E4, rivals (Blue and Green) and other strong trainers, getting Mewtwo and going to train to Mt. Silver.<br>Next season would start with Gold, Silver and Kris getting their pokémon, fighting the gym leaders and showing the common troubles one had while fighting (Rollout, Fury Cutter, Kingdra, etc). Along the journey they would meet Kanto gym leaders and rivals from Gen 1, who would forshadow the ultimate battle. As for character development Silver will become a good trainer and eventually would team up with Gold to battle Lance and Clair. At the end, after beating the league Gold goes to Mt. Silver and Battles Red. After a long battle they are with their last pokémon. They both use their strongest moves while saying how good/strong their opponent is and the screen slowly goes black. A battery error message appears and then a NEW GAME option. The anime ends here.</br></br>  I would redo Oreimo as the author completely intended (not so fast Nekofags) with the better ending  <br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou anime <br>Oh, fuck yeah.

SnW ended fine as it is.</br></br>  <br>You forgot to watch the OVA.</br>  Anime set in WW1. Starts out pretty generic, even some moe in the form of MC's gf/sister before he gets sent off to the front. Then on the 4th episode, MC dies out of nowhere. Nothing dramatic or heroic either, just a random stray bullet to the head in the middle of the episode. <br>From there everything is designed to be a huge "fuck you" to the audience. One of the MC's friends becomes the new MC for a while, but he gets killed off soon enough too, and the focus changes to another pretty random guy. As the series progress it starts going full Eva, with characters losing their sanity and everything breaking down psychologically.<br>As the series progresses, make the artstyle as realistic and gritty as possible. No stylization for dramatic effect. Camera shots are long and static medium shots, music is kept to a bare minimum, and the constant sound of endless bombardment in the background. The audience should feel physically sick from watching the show.<br><br>Ending is the 3rd or 4th guy we follow around losing his arm in an explosion and getting discharged. He returns back to whatever bumfuck village in France he came from, suffering from shellshock and unable to adjust to civilian life. He ends up shooting himself in the bathroom.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd hire A-1 to redo Archer vs Shirou and post-epilogue answer.</br>  <br>Jesus, dude, that's horrifying.<br><br> I'd totally watch it. </br></br></br>  A movie for this<br><br>http://mangafox.me/manga/koukoku_no<wbr>_shugosha/</wbr></br></br>  <br> Mc has a harem of teenagers and a loli he rapes on a night basis <br> drink all the alcohol <br> casually torture some random guys with your bros <br>man the japanese sure know how to live it up</br></br></br></br>  Weight lifter woman, tanned and swole as fuck. Anime will be sad and lots of feels towards the end.  <br>Even better would be the side changing every time the focus changes.</br>  <br>Maybe have the guy who killed the current MC become the new MC</br>  <br>Frozen tear drop</br>  <br>ket-ai</br>  Oyasumi Punpun  <br>My nigga. Is this manga really ended? Seems lot of stuff still unresolved.</br>  A Promise of Blood anime.<br><br>It's already anime enough to work</br></br>  <br>3rd season of Majutsu Index, although I wouldn't trust J.C to do it.<br>Maybe OVAs and specials for series that had an abrupt end, mostly slice of lifes and romances.<br>Primarily though, more original drama movies and anime like wolf children and madoka.<br><br>If possible I would also fund a business to translate more games, visual novels and eroges, since there are so many i'd like to play.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Despera, or maybe Doos Ecks.</br>  This, of course.  <br>Yeah unfortunately. I feel like they could have continued it for a while, there was a lot of stuff they could have touched on but didn't, like another offensive in summer if it happened, what the fuck those dragons do, some of the other ruling families. What I am hoping for is they make a part 2.<br>In the meantime I'm gonna read this, apparently people keep saying its good.<br>http://mangafox.me/manga/gunka_no_b<wbr>altzar/</wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br> Yotsuba&amp; anime <br>It'll be shit and you know it.</br></br></br>  I'd consider the following:<br>Etotama</br>  Accel World s2  <br> PunPun <br>That wouldn't even work as an anime.</br></br>  <br>Despera is getting an anime though.</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  I wouldn't waste money on japanimation if I were a millionaire, but if I were a billionaire, sure.<br><br>I would hire Urobuchi and let him make his personal dream project. Let him choose the studio, the director, the VAs, who'll make the OP, ED and the soundtrack, everything. Tell him the anime will be publicly available for free online so he won't need to bother about time slot, censoring or anything else.

Yawning was a censor.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yep. And the miia tail shedding thing.</br>    <br>Your 3's are distracting me from the monsters too.</br>  <br>Wouldn't that not be until the episode after that? since that happens in chapter 7, and the current rate is 2 chapters per episode?</br>  <br> full moon and tail shedding in same episode <br>This is too much, I can't handle it.</br></br>  <br>She's a dream  not come true<br><br>;_;</br></br> </br>  <br> Smith not masturbating <br>IT'S SHIT<br>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT<wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>nop, centorea hand holding first, then full moon, sheding is on july 28th</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, my bad.

Now if this was a shower scene and she was changing the settings on the showerhead while on the phone, this would be a very obvious and different story...</br>  <br>Also Bath Time. <br><br>http://www.mangahere.co/manga/monst<wbr>er_musume_no_iru_nichijou/c005/5.ht<wbr>ml<br><br><br>Its a japanese trope that applies. Women make just as much a mess as men do if they do it right. And they need to clean up with tissues, or a towel, as much as men do.</br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Hm. I wonder if they'll have the omake next chapter too:<br><br>http://www.mangahere.co/manga/monst<wbr>er_musume_no_iru_nichijou/c005.5/<br><br>The infamous Leg Man omake.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>its not posible to censor Papi's full frontal nudity on the fountain without white light bullshit, they did what they could to keep it tasteful</br>  <br>Tissues wouldn't work very well. A towel on the bed would be different. This isn't exactly a show that pulls punches on the sexual innuendo.<br><br>If anything, this kind of misunderstanding is why it was removed in the anime.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> we should all stop posting webms because one guy can't play them. </br></br></br>  <br> one guy <br>You really underestimate the number of poorfags, don't you?</br></br>  <br> not even mentioning Papi navel <br>So this is the power of summer.</br></br>  <br>Who cares about nudity? Everything made it clear they don't want sexualization of a small girl.<br>Also that faggot never being aroused of her. I had a feeling that this series is one of those "don't feel attraction to smaller girls, it's wrong" type of shows, but now I just know it.</br></br>    <br>Papi letter one.<br>  <br>I just went with the scanlation version. It's technically "master of the house".</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm a poorfag and I have a good computer. Even my old cellphone can play webm without an issue.

They didn't even animate Papi flapping her wings when she flew. That said, the pace of both parts wasn't too bad. Plus, it seems that the 2 chapter per episode guess will hold.</br>  <br>Not everyone has the internet to torrent big hd files.

Plus, you can download 1080p rips from horriblesubs.</br>  <br> Streaming </br>  <br> They didn't even animate Papi flapping her wings when she flew <br>That's because they don't care about small girls in this big breast pandering ecchi show, so Papi gets the short end of the stick.</br></br>  <br>It has been two chapters per episode so far.<br>I haven't done side by side comparison, but I don't think there has been anything significant cut or really added yet.</br></br>  <br>If it's the same resolution and quality, the stream is going to use the same amount of data, if not more, than downloading it.</br>  <br>1.

I remember the earl going full homo on the noah traitor, who is slowly taking Allen's place.  <br>  Kanda is now a General <br>  Lavi is still being tortured so that Tykki and his brother (the one who is obsessed with Road) can get information about Neah from Bookman <br>  Timcampy (the cute little pet) is apparently dead <br>  Earl is going homo insane at Allen and we see some cryptic flashbacks involving Neah, Road, Mana, Earl. <br>  The Noah twins are fighting against that OP guy who protects the Heart <br>  Lenalee is irrelevant. <br>  Johnny is being annoying </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh and Past!Allen. Forgot about him.</br>  <br><br>yea you did, the 13th taking over his body is a thing, not to mention the whole escaping from the order/Apocrypha being an antagonistic innocence</br></br>  <br>Good thing her art looks good again. I might just pick it back up.</br>  <br>  Apocrypha <br><br>Ah, thats the name. He is the one fighting the twins IIRC.</br></br></br>  On the scale from 1 to 10, how broken Allen will be  DGM threadly reminder that Past!Allen is responsible for:<br><br>[x]Musician code along with the song<br>[x]Almost destroying Noah Clan via using 14th<br>[x]Turning Cross's life into shit<br>[x]Turning Allen's life into extreme deep shit<br>[x]Cross's death<br>[x]Lavi turns into wormslut<br>[x]Road made a contract with QB and become magical girl, only for getting Madoka's bless and gone for good<br>[x]Timcanpy's death<br>[x]Not!Shou Tucker raping everyone<br>[x]Turning everyone into gay<br>[x]Link's unrequited gay love <br>[x]Turning Kanda and Alma from straight to gay<br>[x]The manga switches to quarterly<br><br>[for later update]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Allen is pretty much finished now</br>  <br> tim <br> dead <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Tim got killed by Apocryphos.

Cross noticed that Allen lost his memory but never asking why</br>  <br> Searching for A.W: The man who has forgotten love <br><br>Hoshino's inner fujoshi STRONK</br></br></br>  <br>彼 can address Allen, too.

Mana being the Earl is like nuking on this poor soul's already broken as fuck heart</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't.<br>Shitty scans is still better than the animu.</br></br>  <br>I don't remember the anime was that bad. The directing lacks impact but the music was really good. The animation is acceptable.</br>  Fall lineup is fucking stacked   Yurus are graduating   I don't see K season 2 or heavy object.  <br>Those were two I was looking forward to. They'll probably add them in later</br>  <br>They're both on Anichart's list<br><br>http://anichart.net/fall<br><br>I just picked out the ones that jumped out at me as pretty big names</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where's it say that?</br>  <br>GUP Movie will be 2016. Book it.</br>   Diabolik Lovers S2 <br>Why.</br>  <br>I didn't know Asterisk was getting adapted.</br>  <br>this month and August will reveal more originals and sequel coming out fall season<br><br>yeah fall is going to be fucking stacked</br></br></br>   full of sequels <br> good <br>shit season</br></br>  <br><br>It has a release date already....</br></br>  YY S3<br><br>Literally all I need</br></br>  <br>its a good thing you know how to touch type because i can see your head is shoved firmly in your asshole<br><br><br>that digimon trailer made me cream myself and everyone within 10 feet.</br></br></br></br>  Aside from Owarimonogatari, I think this season is much better than Fall will eventually be.  <br> Digimon Tri movie 1 <br><br>How many months after until they release the BR?</br></br></br>  <br>Usually 4 to 6.</br>  can shaft be any more dense?<br><br>KIZU WHEN?</br></br>  <br> mfw I didn't know Noragami had a first season <br>Is it as good as the manga?</br></br>  If KyoAni has something for fall this will easily be the best season in a while.  <br><br>Didn't read the manga. It was pretty good, no complaints but nothing mind-blowing either 7/10</br></br>  <br> Ignoring OnePunch Man, Concrete Revolutio and Subete ga F, which has character designs by Asano Inio </br>  <br>One of the few actually good Shounen. I'll give the anime a go though, thanks</br>  <br><br>Nothing announced yet and they've usually done announcements at least an entire season ahead of time.</br></br>  <br>I actually think the anime is better paced. The pacing of the manga gets better, but not until way after where the anime got to.</br>  <br>It was nice, but it had a Bones ending</br>  <br><br>I enjoyed the fuck out of it. Good OP/ED, and based Kamiyan</br></br>  Maybe if Yuru Yuri S3 does well they'll realize  sabagebu needs an S2   <br><br>They will probably announce something at C88 like they did at C87.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ATf<wbr>Hbzg0nEs</wbr>  [ ]<br>Subete ga F would probably be AOTS if Owari wasn't there</br>  Noragami is getting a second season? <br>What the fuck?</br>  <br><br>Owari is fun b/c it's so fucking cliche, predicting a 2nd cour as AOTS in a stacked lineup is a huge stretch though</br></br>  <br>I meant Owari as Owarimonogatari , sorry I see now how it could be confusing</br>   GuP movie <br> Yuru s3 <br> Haikyuu s2 <br> OPM <br> &gt;Free! movie <br><br>Absolutely fantastic/10</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>If C88 has a KyoAni announce and a bunch of owari loli vampire/smug-chan porn I'll be able to die happy</br></br>  <br>Can't you fucking type "because"?</br>   More Monogatari shit <br><br>Holy fuck when will it end. There's going to countless thread as usual because you fucks eat this garbage up like you're drinking water.</br></br>  <br>Everything except owari seems like shit. Enjoy.</br>  <br>And it has been delayed 4 times since they first announced back in 2013. The OVA was pushed back twice. Date means jack shit. Look at God Eater this season.<br><br>That fat director is busy making Prison School too. Some mess up will happen and the movie will be pushed back again. Oh Shirobako BD were pushed back too. That director is known as the not in time Jioggly Jiggly Heaven director.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br>I love water</br>  Second half of AotY 2015 soon, can't wait.  <br>I personally enjoy mine with a lot less dialogue and an MC that isn't irritating as all hell.</br>  <br> Monogatari <br> end <br>Sorry about that anon.</br></br></br>  <br>In terms of light novels I'm looking forward to Heavy Object but not sure about your love for Asterisk. Just my opinion but I didn't like Asterisk at all. Haven't seen any threads on it either so I'm not sure what /a/'s opinion is.</br>  <br>Always Sunrise dominates in fall season<br><br>G-Tekketsu and Mai-HiME continuation/new series are going to be something special</br></br></br>  <br> All that shit taste </br>  <br>hell isn't irritating</br>  <br>Tried watching Monogatari but could barely finish Bake without a shit ton of effort on my part. When I moved on to Nise I just didn't have the strength to stomach it's shit</br>  Isn't Utawarerumono's new game getting an anime in the fall as well? I'm pretty hyped about that  Oh god I forgot the Fall lineup was going to be complete ass    <br>Are you ready for all the baneposting?</br>  Japanese chart, 1 week old.  <br>If I said yes would you die?</br>  <br> more YY shit <br>zzzz<br>OPM when?</br></br></br>  <br>fall</br>  Something is going on here  <br><br><br>It would be extremely painful  4u </br></br></br>  <br> new Lupin III <br> new Black Jack <br> Subete ga F ni Naru <br> Haikyuu S2 <br> Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry <br> Heavy Object <br> One Punch Man <br> Noragami S2 <br> Sakurako-san <br> Utawarerumono <br> Hokuto no Ken spinoff <br>Holy shit OP is right.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yuru Yuri is the only one that matters tbh  What source material should I start reading now so I can spoil showonlyfags in 3 months?  Wait, so am I supposed to watch Owari no Seraph or Owarimonogatari first?<br><br>Also where does Ore Monogatari fit into the timeline?</br></br>  Noragami was so fucking awful, how the fuck did it get a second season and an OVA?  <br> Also where does Ore Monogatari fit into the timeline? <br>wat</br></br>  Is Japan gonna announced more shows for fall season because if it's finalized then my ass is backlogging until winter  <br> Subete ga F novel (actual novel, not light novel) <br> OnePunch Man manga <br> Heavy Object light novel <br> Noragami <br>You have a lot of options choose</br></br></br></br></br>   Utawarerumono sequel anime <br>Shit yeah nigga  sucks I'm an EOP and we probably won't get the game in the west </br>  <br> More monogatarishit <br>Fuck</br></br>  <br>No, this is it, they totally aren't gonna announce more things until the season is less than one month away like they always do</br>  Does 2015 have nothing but sequels ?  <br>You don't have to watch it, anon.<br>I know I won't.</br></br>  <br>We probably will. Atlus localized Tears to Tiara 2, Aquapazza and Dungeon Travelers 2, which are all from Aqua Plus.

However, with her long slumber, she looks like a little girl on the outside. <br><br>That's the most anime plot synopsis I've ever seen</br></br>  <br>NNB and Baby Steps<br><br>I was going to pick up Working but haven't gotten around to watching the first 2 seasons</br></br></br>  <br><br>top tier naming scheme</br></br>  <br>Is your body ready for grown up Aruruu?</br>  <br><br>yes there's usually always a couple anouncements at comiket and fucking dumbasses always end up anouncing a show like 3 weeks before it starts airing.</br></br>  Shomin Sample sounds amazing  <br>I think it's pretty obvious that at this point we're not going to see Kizu until everything else has been adapted.</br>  <br><br><br>Carrier is also back.  best girl </br></br></br>  <br>when is Comiket 88 again</br>  <br>It looks like that studio has grown big enough to hire more animators.</br>  <br><br>Aug 14-16</br></br>  <br>Maybe they hired Aoi</br>  Where's Haikyuu 2?<br>Where's One Punch Man?<br>Where's K season 2?<br><br>Where's  Diabolik Lovers season 2? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not the whole chart</br>  <br> I didn't read the manga </br>  <br> Always Sunrise dominates in fall season <br><br> 26,886　　To Aru Kagaku no Railgun 2010/1/29 <br> 28,350 *5 Ore no Imouto ga Konna ni Kawaii Wake ga Nai [BD+DVD]: 2010/12/22 <br> 52,133 11 Fate/Zero [BD-BOX]: 2012/03/07 <br> 30,457 11 Girls und Panzer [DVD+BD]: 2012/12/21 [●] [Extremely supply constrained, later volumes 36-37k] <br> 27,568 Infinite Stratos 2 2013/10/30 <br> 37,861 Fate/stay night Unlimited Blade Works 2015/03/25 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>OST was funky as hell https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mD7<wbr>OlVs_pRI</wbr>  [ ]</br>   gochiusa <br>Mediocre at best<br> noragami <br>Nothing special, but not terrible.<br> asterisk <br>Shit<br> seraph <br>Shit<br> monogatari <br>Shit<br> digimon <br>Toei = Shit<br><br>Stacked with shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta up your autism meds anon</br>  <br>All shit.</br>  <br>K Return of Kings looks great,</br>  <br>Shit's crazy. It was like yesterday when we were all shitting on them during Ijime Connect.</br>  <br>Technically 2.5 shows.</br>  <br>Yeah, this is surprisingly very good and animation is top class.</br>  <br>stacked with shit you mean?<br><br> moeshit, shonenshit, haremshit, fujoshit, haremshit, moeshit, nostalgiashit, moeshit, shonenshit. </br></br></br>  <br> New Angela songs for Exodus <br> New Angela songs for K <br> in the same season <br><br>Poetry.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, sucks to be you.</br>  <br>4th movie when</br>  My friend said Mahouka will get a season 2 but I can't find it here  <br> incomplete list <br><br>Until I see everything I have to reserve my judgement.</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like another bunch of dumb kiddie fantasy shit like all the rest of it that's been plaguing anime recently  for example Owari no Seraph . Only Yuru Yuri is good.<br><br>Also yay more X-monogatari shit. Never seen that before.</br></br></br>  <br> Shomin Sample <br><br>First time I'm actively looking forward to a harem</br></br></br>  <br> K: Return of Kings <br> Noragami Aragoto and 2 more OVAs <br> One Punch Man <br> Seraph of the End S2 <br> Owarimonogatari <br> Young Black Jack <br> Subete ga F ni Naru (Asano as a character designer can only be a good sign) <br><br>I agree OP, shit is stacked.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh I might watch this</br>   all those harems <br><br>Oh boy here we go.</br></br>  <br>All I care about is the new Lupin</br>  <br><br>The best part is that they're all harems. Then they've got around two more shows slated after that and one of the shows in Fall is 2cour as well.</br></br>  I always laugh at the comments of these threads cus later on in the season people then start posting shit like "whys there no good anime to watch this season" and otger variations of it  <br> The one who led japan to victory in the world war II <br><br>nips absolutely buttmad almost 70 years later</br></br></br>  <br>It's the American equivalent of Vietnam, I guess.</br>  <br>For shits and giggles.<br><br>Even Sugita approves of it.</br></br></br>  A bad season once again, with the exception of OPMan.<br><br>"Anime was a mistake"</br></br>  <br> Diabolik Lovers S2 <br>FUCK YEAH I'm so happy about this. I hope it'll be as funny as the first few episodes.</br></br>  <br> Owarimonogatari <br>Oh, yes. YES!</br></br>    <br>Owari, Yuri, GuP<br>3/9, could be worse, certainly not 'stacked' though.</br></br>  MADOKA S2 WHEN???<br><br>REEE!</br></br>  your mom is fuking stacked fagot  <br>I think they're gonna save kizu for last.</br>  <br>Isn't Owarimonogatari the only thing left save for Kizu?</br>   OPM anime <br> GuP movie <br> YuYu S3 <br> Owarimonogatari <br>Future's so bright I gotta wear shades.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they'd fuck it up heavily.</br>  <br><br>We don't need S2.<br> Homura already ended the series perfectly in Rebellion. </br></br></br>  <br>Koyomimonogatari and Zokuowarimonogatari are still left after this.</br>  <br> I perceive our timeline as being the "real" (final) one, and as such I don't believe it's over yet. Someone's gotta fix the moon. </br>  <br> Moe shit <br> shit shonen <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>    <br><br><br> asano as character designer <br><br>Sweet Jesus the time has finally come</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The ost was fucking amazing.</br>   No Haikyuu S2. <br> No OPM. <br> Includes Seraph no shit Owari. <br>What the fuck OP?</br></br></br>  <br>There are other things than just moe and shounen shit. But I guess you're right, after all /a/ does have shit taste.</br>  <br>Wait, K got a second season? Im hyped.</br>  <br> another bunch of dumb kiddie fantasy shit like all the rest of it <br> recently <br>It's anime.</br></br></br>  Every single season, everyone shittalks the current season, and hypes up the next one.<br>Every single fucking season.</br>  <br>Poor souls.<br>I love this season. Along with all the sequels, there's awesome adaptations like GATE, Gakkou Gurashi, and Gangsta. Next season looks just as good.<br>Sure feels nice to enjoy my hobby.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean "stacked full of shit".<br><br>You won't even see the GuP movie until spring: Rebellion didn't get cammed, so no chance of GuP.</br></br></br>  Can someone tell me about Subete ga F ni Naru? It's been on my PTW ever since I've heard of it but perhaps someone here has read the novels. The only think that scares me is "A-1 Pictures".<br><br>Other than that, GochiUsa and Owarimono for me. Concrete Revolutio looks funky enough for me to check it out.</br></br>  <br>When can we expect new announcements? This month or the next?</br>   only care about 1/9 of the things OP posted <br><br>meh</br></br>  <br>Owarimonogatari literally translates to "End Story"</br>  <br>not yet.<br>it's not over yet!</br></br>  <br>I'd personally translate it as a "A Story of the End"</br>  <br>Yeah that is what anime is all about</br>  <br>In all honesty,fall looks like shit</br>  <br>Oh fuck I didn't even think of that. Well the PV looks outstanding anyway and I like some bane when it's not too forced.</br>  <br>CARRIER HAS ARRIVED</br>  yes  <br>The only good things there are Owari and OPM, everything else is garbage.<br><br>This season is by far better than the next one, sadly.</br></br></br>   Ougi is Koyomi <br>sorry</br>   Wake Up, Girls! Zoku-hen Movie 2 <br>It's almost time.</br>  <br> Tri <br> Fall <br>  </br></br></br>  BUT WHERE IS TEEKYUU 6? ARE THEY ENDING IT THIS SEASON? HOW CAN I ENJOY FALL15 TO ITS FULLEST WITHOUT MY 2 MINUTES OF TEEKYUU  <br>Knowing bones, they'll probably fuck up on that Noragami</br>  <br>Do they think they're old SHAFT?</br>  <br><br>New Gundam that gets revealed tomorrow will probably be Fall too.</br></br>  <br>It already got revealed.<br><br>I think it's winter, though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The whole year has kind of been rife with 2nd and often even 3rd seasons. It's no secret that most of the industry is badly out of ideas and extremely risk averse. Even a lot of originals play it as safe as they reasonably can now by stocking up on popular seiyuu to pair with event tickets and having some big name otaku writer's cred on board like a Maeda or Urobuchi for 3 episodes.</br></br>  <br><br>Not with A-1 in charge most likely. They'll probably just try to use the designs to fujobait and just wing it otherwise.</br></br>  <br><br>Not in a while in terms of disc sales really outside of the odd OVA and Movie release. Their M.O isn't currently conducive to pandering to otaku outside of Love Live and their tendency to do originals is a high risk one. They've got a solid lead on pretty much everyone who isn't Toei and TMS when it comes to mainstream appeal for daytime anime, but their late night anime profile has really dropped off since the days of Geass and 00. Now it'd sooner be the latest shitty LN or VN adaptation that's likely to dominate any given season.</br></br>  <br><br>Always nice to hear I'm not the only one. The brick wall I hit was that stupid ghost girl arc that I did manage to finish but had exhausted my will to continue by the end. I still find it hilarious that people consider this an uncontestable masterpiece and are massive pretentious douchebags over it given what it is.</br></br>  <br><br>It was virtually the only thing I could finish a couple winters back.</br></br>  <br><br>Those are honestly almost always the best bets these days. I'm at least interested in One Punch Man, Noragami, Sakurako, Lupin, Black Jack, Haikyuu and Heavy Object (tentatively since I don't normally watch LN adaptations anymore since they're kind of shit 95% of the time)<br><br>I consider a season with 7 potential shows to start of interest pretty heavy. I can't remember the last season where that actually happened even, maybe Spring or Fall 2013.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not as interesting as it sounds even if you have an ojou-sama fetish like I do.</br></br>  <br>But anon, thighs!</br>  That season looks like a true faIl season to me.   people actually like the K anime <br><br>This is a joke right?</br></br>  <br>So, I suppose this has been hifted for winter.<br>Fug</br></br>  <br>they look all terrible</br>  Can we have a mother fucking Berserk thread? <br><br> miura comes out of nowhere  <br> Makes Berserk a monthly manga again <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-08/berserk-manga-confirme<wbr>d-to-resume-as-monthly-series-this-<wbr>month/.90187<br><br>Lets talk about this shit. <br><br> there are people who call Guts edgy <br><br>Shame.</br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  I WANT PLATINUM TO MAKE THE GAME<br>FUCK KLK</br>  But Guts IS edgy<br><br>Edgy done right though<br><br>Also,<br> monthly <br> implying </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Edgy done right though <br>Pretty much this. <br><br> not having hope </br></br></br></br>  <br> no name <br> Hawk <br> now the Puck fucker <br><br>God save these threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>platinum would make a qte based berserk game which would be shit <br><br>let them ruin an already shit anime.</br></br></br>  <br>its happening ?</br>  I give it a week before Miura goes back to jerking it to idolm@ster  <br>!hawk finally killed herself.<br><br><br>Happening.</br></br></br></br>    old thread is kill<br><br>moving to new  ship </br></br>  Will there ever be more Hawaiian shirt Guts?   all these /v/tards <br>fuck you tane.</br>    <br>Why do you constantly post this shit?

The OST is also great.</br></br>  <br>I still think it was the best version of the Golden Age so far, even better than the manga. Though it's a shame some things were missing, like Wyald.</br>  <br>I liked it but I preferred how it was portrayed in the manga because of some things missing from it</br>  <br>I really enjoyed it, thought it captured the mood and atmosphere of Berserk great. Really nice OST, some of the scenes/art were really well done, too.</br>  <br>The anime got me into the manga. I even made an... amv out of the anime.</br>  <br>Didn't Miura outright say that he liked Idolmaster and that the blue haired one was his favourite?</br>  <br>Which one? Maybe I've watched it.</br>  <br>Yeah, he compared Chihaya to Casca and said something about the two being stoic. Apparently we were supposed to know his favorite idol just from looking at Casca.</br>  Daily reminder that Miss Luca is best girl<br>Purefags can go fuck themselves</br>  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ya2<wbr>5mRh-QRE</wbr>  [ ] <br><br>Took me an hour.</br></br></br>  So how do you scrubs think Berserk will end?  <br>The anime captured the heart of Berserk moreso than the movies did I think. The TV series sacrificed some things in order to focus more on Guts and the band of the hawk in general as characters, and show how their relationship develops with one another. The Movies trim this out in order to include Skull Knight and some other things that the TV series omitted (though they still omitted a good deal of thins that the TV series had, which was weird.)<br><br>The TV series seems really low budget though, even for its time. The animation was off a lot of time and while the OST is fantastic, there's only like 6 tracks to it. Though the happy side effect of this was that the show has a lot of quiet time which greatly helped the atmosphere.<br><br>Also, the dub wasn't too bad either. Griffith is fantastic and the proof of it is here: https://<span>youtu.be/bXYiFFM7WH4?t=66  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some of the JRPG party will die, Casca will be cured but will have no relocation of Guts or the Band of the Hawk.</br>  <br>Final scene is Rickert putting the Dragonslayer and Griffith's sword into the sword graveyard.</br>  <br> Casca commits sudoku after getting her memories back <br> Team Guts heads out from Elf Island after they get a powerup <br> It's been a thousand years, just like with the red eyed kid, time goes faster when with the elves <br> The Age of Darkness that's been said to be coming is in full swing <br> God Hand are ruling the Earth and are actually in their weakest since they're not weaving causality from their magic dimension <br> Skull Knight is kill, the God Hand are fighting each other for absolute dominion over humanity <br> One of Rickert's descendants is leading the rebellion for humanity <br> Guts joins them, things don't work out and people are kill <br> Guts despairs and awakens the Behelit <br> Since there are no God Hand in the weird dimension Guts has a one on one with the Idea of Evil <br> Literally kills God <br> all the apostle and God Hand revert to their human form <br> Guts doesn't kill any of them <br> the cycle starts anew </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not too bad anon</br>  Today is Yuyuesday.
