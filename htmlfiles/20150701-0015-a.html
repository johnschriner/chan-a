It only took them 15 years.<br><br>As long as that absolutely disgusting blue and orange casual shit he wears in the original doesnt make a comeback.</br></br></br>  <br>Shirou has shorter hair.<br><br><br>He's fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  Tsukihime a shit. A bit less shit than Fate though.    <br>Thank you lad</br>  <br> a bit more shit than Fate though <br><br>Fixed. Hell the original game is pretty terrible, only Kohaku's route stands well on its own.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't he have earings?</br>  <br>how can you remake something that was never made before</br>  <br>Back in 2000, earings were a fashionable item for delinquents.<br><br>Now, they are just for faggots.</br></br></br>    <br>That was the anime you doofus.</br>  <br>They're both pretty shit. Does it matter in the end?</br>  <br><br>because it's about the VN</br></br>  <br>B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> posting a blank image </br>    <br>Makes sense.</br>  <br>Harry Potter and the Gate of Babylon</br>  DUDE TSUKIHIME ANIME DOESN'T EXIST LMAO  Did they fix Arc's lack of long skirt and hair vents yet?  <br> Waver and El Melon's Imouto <br><br>Might be cool</br></br></br>    <br>Can she resist the Gland?</br>  <br><br>sorry my bad</br></br>  <br>They fixed her long skirt and outdated hair by removing them, yeah</br>  Why do all MCs with glasses look so shit? Do I just hate guys with glasses?  <br>I need more Clock Tower novels.</br>  <br>Hopefully not. I love it when you nostalgiafags get angry.</br>  Sacchin route? Where is she?  <br>what if the teacher get a route but sacchin not <br><br> thinking of shero </br></br></br>  <br>SO<br>FUCKING<br>AWESOME<br>BASED FUCKING ARIHIKO</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the second novel still gonna take place before the 5th War?</br>  <br>It's your inner jock</br>  <br> those arm and leg proportions <br>Is Takeuchi regressing? This anatomy seems somehow worse than some of his recent stuff.</br></br>  Know your place, Gray.  <br>Does Luvia let the Shero-dog fuck her?</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>When will they drop fate universe garbage?</br>  <br>I CALL FUCKING BULLSHIT ON THOSE GLASSES.<br><br>AOKO DOES NOT HAVE THE FASHION SENSE TO KNOW HOW TO MAKE FASHIONABLE EYEGLASSES FOR SHIKI.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So Flat will be now an actual character of Lord El-Melloi II Case Files? That's pretty good.</br></br>  The VN was shit, why are you so hyped?    <br><br>Faggots.<br>Her new design looks like shit anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>manga shiki is still better.</br>    <br>secondary here. Do Velvet and Blond big boobs have a connection? The only thing i know about Luvia is shes Rins rival pretty much</br>  <br>Some people thought it was good. People also think Fate is good. Shocking.</br>  Oh fuck.<br>I just noticed that these designs will probably also be used in the new HD melty game <br>I'M ROCK HARD, GIVE IT TO ME</br></br>  Nwe Apocrypha material.  <br>They met for the first time in Lord El-Melloi II Case Files and he is one of the top teachers in the Clock Tower, so she is kinda her student once she joins.</br>  <br>Who?</br>  ARE YOU ALL READY TO RAPE THE MAIDS<br>IN<br>H D</br></br>  <br> her student <br>his</br></br>  <br>She studies under him and stuff.<br><br>She also considers him attractive but not romantically appealing, according to Case Files at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh ok, I knew waver was at the clock tower but i didn't know he was teaching, now its all to obvious</br>  <br>She was shown awhile ago. You just forgot.</br>    Is it any better written than Fate shit and Kara no Kyoukai?<br><br>It looks better character and basic plot wise, but being Nasu this cant be good, right?</br></br>  <br>R A P E<br>A<br>P<br>E<br><br>HYPE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thinks that tsukihime get h scenes </br>  <br>It'll be all-ages m8</br>  <br>I want to rape the new teacher.</br>  <br>I'LL PROBABLY BE 30 BY THE TIME THIS IS OUT</br>  <br>He is the best teacher there actually. His main talent is not being a mage but teaching other people at being an awesome mage.</br>    <br>You know that the remake is an all age version right? No sex no blood. Only the equivalent of dolphins and dragons.</br>  Is that all the Tsukihime? I was told they changed Arc and Ciel's design again.<br><br>I disagree.<br>The skirt sucks but I think she's fucking adorable.</br></br></br>  you faggots know that takuechi stated that they not gonna do h scene anymore, mahoyo didnt get either  <br><br>It's not going to be translated into English ever. We still don't have Mahoutsukai translation 3 years later. At least we can look at some of the art?</br></br>  <br>Who is that Archer?</br>  <br>no, kara no kyoukai is the second best type moon thing, carnival phantasm being the first</br>  <br>Who is Gray?</br>  <br> modern Type Moon <br> sex scenes <br><br>ayy lmao<br><br>It will be an all-ages VN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>They retconned Aoko's randomly grabbed made on the spot old fashioned eyeglasses to modern fashionable eyeglasses.<br><br>Fucking Type Moon.</br></br></br>  <br>Rape transcends language barriers<br>Also I'm pretty sure people care more about turkeyhandle than mahou</br></br>    Reminder that we will NEVER EVER get translations of this. That's it, if it ever manages to come out.  <br>That paper he wrote in F/Z must have been the basis for his teaching standards then, considering it was about how mages dont need to be born into strong families to be strong</br>    <br>Unless they want this to sell as poorly as Mahoyo did, they should have H scenes.</br>  <br>Fate is good.</br>  <br>what the fuck?<br>Like, seriously what the fuck?<br>Who thought this was a good idea?<br>I've been waiting this long for a stripped down VN from 2000 with designs I mostly don't like<br>I'm done with everything, fuck it all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> personal real-estate of that size and design in Japan <br><br>Yeah right.</br></br></br>  <br>It ranges from shit to ok at best</br>  <br>Most of the big VN companies end doing this at one point. That way they can go more mainstream.</br>  <br>Wait for the kickstarter.</br>  <br> poorly <br> was 7th most selled VN 2012 <br>ok</br></br></br>  <br>Because the end couple is Alice and the boy.<br><br>And their romance will be tragedy since it was already spoiled by the complete material entry on Alice.<br><br>And Mahoyo is suppose to be a trilogy but Nasu is a lazy ass since I highly doubt Mahoyo Part 2 and 3 is ever gonna come out,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ, they sure made the mansion bigger.</br>  <br>Mahoyo had other issues<br><br>Like not having voices at all</br></br></br>  <br>all you would need is lots of money to buy the land</br>  <br>What is this?</br>  This will be shit how do they expect me to enjoy the adventures of Rapeman if he won't even rape anyone in it?  With the setting be replaced with a contemporary one?  <br>It ranges from shit to pretty fucking awesome.<br><br>My opinion &gt; your opinion</br></br></br>   No h scenes <br>what's the fucking point</br>  <br>Poorly compared to Fate and Tsukihime, right?</br>  <br>Nothing about H-scenes has been mentioned you troublestirring faggot.</br>  <br>He is still a really average mage though.<br><br>But he is number one in the list of people the female students want to fuck, so I suppose it's good.</br></br></br>  How can they remove the scenes?  they're pretty fucking important for kohaku/hisui's routes   <br>Maybe he force-feeds his victims hard boiled eggs instead?</br>  <br>Only due to Nasu's threats of canning the game if it didn't get enough preorders, newfag.<br><br>Mahoyo had a shit reception once everyone played it.<br><br>Nasu spent too much time showing off the VN engine rather than spending time on the story.<br><br>Seriously, all the Mahoyo hype was the so called super special VN engine from Type Moon like anyone gave a shit about their new VN engine in the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck you. I'm right, you're wrong.</br>  <br>Remake means they will rewrite the game, so don't expect it being the same because it will not.<br><br>It was even said that they will change some DAAs.</br></br></br>  Who hear /GotMotivatedTo ResumeLearningJapanese/ so they can be fluent enough to read the remake by the time it comes out?  The glasses honestly just look really wrong on him. They look like extra fluff. Hell 2 of the faces have his eyes actually looking into a space the glasses's rim occupies.  <br>Key still does sex. TM isn't nearly as big as Key in VNs.</br>  <br>It's not like they're copy pasting the scenario. Probably.</br>  <br>No anon. Never forget that:<br><br>My opinion &gt; your opinion</br></br></br>  <br>Kohaku was forced to clean Makihisa's floors really well to ease his pains. After a while this broke her. Also include something about spoiling a movie.</br>  <br>It had a shit reception the first day due to haters. Right now in EGS it has a good rating.</br>  <br>Shiki's old glasses really weren't that old fashioned.</br>  I liked the round glasses better  <br>Well since he's the protag you won't have to see him that often<br>And aside from the fun CGs, in most of the action CGs he'll probably have his glasses off so even then it wouldn't be that big of a deal</br></br>  <br> Magica Disclosure <br> Master TV <br>Naaasuuuu</br></br></br>  <br>But anon.<br><br>My opinion &gt; your opinion</br></br></br>  <br>If I start now how long would that give me? 10 years?</br>  <br>Key has sex sometimes, but Clannad was All Ages and that was their big hit.</br>  <br>understandable. So his situation is kinda like Shirou then, after surviving the holy grail war i would imagine the respect he gets at the tower is on par with being a great mage.</br>  <br>Going to be practicing kanji tomorrow, this update has given me hope again</br>  <br>AquaPlus and KEY are bigger mainstream VN companies than Type Moon and they also actually release VNs while you can't say the same thing about Type Moon.</br>  <br>And Clannad is their greatest seller and it does not have sex. Your point?</br>  <br> proper BG artwork <br>God damn it Nasu, get your shit on Steam or something already.<br><br><br> Takeuchi sameface strikes again <br>When will he stop drawing the same characters?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, Type Moon still has multiple projects going on, and it's not like Nasu isn't doing work. He wrote the screenplay for episode 25 of UBW.</br>  <br> Shirou with black hair and glasses <br>Really, Takeuchi?</br></br>  <br><br>I'm going to miss the eerie looking kinds-mono color picture backgrounds.</br></br>  <br> Nasu <br> Steam <br>dont give him more reason to make things worse, if he got releases on steam his lazy meter would sky rocket</br></br></br>  Is this an anime or visual novel remake?  <br>This. I don't know what to think about these kind of things.<br>muh atmosphere</br></br>  Keep posting OP, I'm already at the edge of my seat<br>PLEASE respond</br>  <br>Aoko didn't make them. She stole them from someone with better aesthetic sense.</br>  <br> and it's not like Nasu isn't doing work. He wrote the screenplay for episode 25 of UBW. <br><br>In between his playing Bloodborn you mean</br></br></br>  <br>something about Girls work?</br>  <br> She stole them from someone with better aesthetic sense. <br>from dirty red<br><br>VN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Grand Order is also supposed to be coming out in July, and he wrote for that too.</br>  <br>Do you think Takeuchi will made Anime by himself? <br><br>fuck me</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br> playing bloodborn <br>that's totally work related though, hes doing story research</br></br>  <br>Fine, just dont expect anything from Nasu wheh Dark Souls 3 is released.</br>  <br>It's dead anon. Let it go.</br>  <br><br>Touko wouldn't make such generic looking glasses.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Shirou can't let anyone at the clocktower know about UBW as it's a forbidden magic and if they find out they'll either seal him or dissect him for study.</br>  <br>It's okay though because Bloodborne is short as shit with the DLC being a ways away so I'm sure he's fine.</br>  <br>HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>Shit, I forgot about Dark Souls 3</br>  I didn't read Tsukihime. How many did I lost?<br><br> How long is it? </br></br>  <br>Change them how?<br><br>Like he knows they'll never show up otherwise so he's tossing them into Tsukihime?</br></br></br>  <br>Except it is common for students to assassinate each other so why would Waver want the attention of female murderers?</br>  <br>This kills the servant.</br>  ANIME WHEN  <br>it's one of my favorite VNs of all time. First time I read it I was fucking obsessed with it for months. I powered through it in like 3 days</br>  <br>Never!<br>I want to believe.</br></br>  <br>I heard TM stuff is pretty difficult, so good luck with that.</br>  how much would you recommend playing the VN before watching the anime? I dig the overall setting of Tsukihime but am a little bit tired of VNs because I overdid them in the last months. so should I rather <br><br>1. read it right fucking now because it's awesome<br>2. watch the anime<br>3. read it leater (maybe never) don't watch the anime <br>4. wait for the remake<br><br> please help, I don't want to be secondary scum </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In rewriting the story. The maids are still there but the story as a whole and the routes will be rewritten.</br>  <br>It's pretty not that good</br>  <br>not in your lifetime</br>   WHERE IS THE CHAIR REDESIGN   <br>I guarantee it's within 2 years of the remake's release.</br>  <br>There is no Tsukihime anime.<br><br>That's all you need to hear.</br></br></br>  <br> before watching the anime <br>No. Read the VN at your leisure but don't watch the anime.</br></br>  <br><br>Shorter than Fate by a longshot, but still very long. 15 hours or so for full completion.<br><br>If you liked Fate, definitely check it out. Just remember that it's very, VERY dated (hence why it's getting a re-make in the first place).<br><br><br><br>Same. Probably the second VN I ever read after Yume Miru Kusuri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>There is no Tsukihime anime.</br>  <br>The "Tsukihime anime doesn't exist" joke is there for a reason, anon</br>  <br>1<br>When you start reading it you'll be engrossed with it and keep going through each route.<br>I couldn't STOP reading it when I first picked it up</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> There is no Tsukihime anime. <br>that pretty much says everything, thanks guys</br></br></br></br>  <br>Read the VN at some point since there isn't and likely will never be an anime, and the remake may or may not be better or as good as the original.</br>  <br>It is said he can get all his students under his banner and reach a power shift in the Clock Tower if he wanted.</br>  <br>Stop spouting shit without a source.</br>  <br>No? They've said multiple times they still aren't sure on whether or not to go all ages or not because there are some integral parts that take place during those "sex" scenes.<br><br>On top of that<br> Vampire story <br> No blood <br><br>Sure thing pal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty. Did Takeuchi make that?</br>  <br>Why not do both.</br>  <br>I don't know about that much, but i was just meaning the fact that surviving the holy grail war earns you respect.<br><br>Im going to finish reading the VN some time soon, but i was wondering if F/ST realta nua is the right one to have, i dont know how to get to the menu where it shows what endings you have gotten.</br></br></br>  I can't believe just a small set of images can make me so giddy  <br>But he doesn't because he is ultimately apathetic which makes Waver a piece of shit in the end,<br><br>Students wouldn't need bodyguards if Waver actually acted like he cared.<br><br>But Waver isn't the teacher from GTO.<br><br>He only cares about his Japanese video games.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will it be voiced?  <br>In the last GO interviews they said they will never put sex again in their games.<br><br>Still, that guy does not mean what All-Ages in VN means. It means no sex, blood is fine.</br></br></br>  So nothing on Heaven's Feel?  <br>It's on production now. We would have to wait until Comiket or something like that for more info.</br>  <br> no more nasu sex scenes </br>  <br>It's been cancelled. ufotable are moving onto Hollow Ataraxia for more Luvia goodness.</br>  <br> nothing on HF <br>Sakura has worms. More at 11.</br></br>  <br>no fuck off wormslut</br>  <br>luvia has like 2 scenes in ataraxia</br>  <br>Do you have the quote on that?<br><br>It's a big book so maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>Ataraxia will never be a thing with UBW selling less than Zero, sorry.</br>  <br> PE<br>RU<br>SO<br>NA</br></br></br> </br>  <br>Thank god.</br>  <br>You don't want to imagine what if feels like to stick your dick into a variety of different deep-sea creatures?</br>  So this is the twink that beats two DAAs and rapes most of the cast?<br><br>Quit holding out and post the Roa and Nrvnqsr redesigns.</br></br>  <br>I'm glad for Nasu. If he doesn't feel comfortable writing sex scenes they shouldn't include them.</br>  <br>Oh Jesus.</br>  <br>fuck !</br>  <br><br>The only Luvia you will get is the Drama CD with UBW BD Box II and Lord El-Melloi II Case Files.</br></br>  <br>There might be, wait until the whole thing is posted, if it's posted.</br>  <br>I feel like there are going to be 100% less sharks in the remake and that's sad</br>  <br>I can't envision him being insane enough.</br>  <br>good one</br>    <br>I think odyseus is a safe bet</br>    <br>Then why did he make them have actual key plot elements half the time? Fuck the true end in KT is primarily more sex with Len.</br>  <br> and Lord El-Melloi II Case Files. <br><br>Anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>something like this</br>    <br>Hopefully there is something in here. I at least want an update sometime before winter.<br><br>Luvia in literally two scenes in HA, one of which I think is over the phone.</br></br></br>  <br>Supposedly Takeuchi is the one who wrote them. Or at least outlined how he wanted them to go</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> thick-framed rectangular glasses <br>DROPPED</br></br>  <br> Fuck you. </br>      <br>Because that's how eroge is. He was still uncomfortable with it and it was Takeuchi the one who came up with the actual ideas for the scenes.</br>  <br>Why are all the melty blood designs so perfect</br>  <br><br>in the next 100 years</br></br>  <br>[citation needed]<br><br>Nasu is not uncomfortable about sex, at all. Read Fate/Extra CCC.<br>Nasu is self-conscious about his ability to write erotica.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> UBW needed to sell over 100k for HA to happen <br>I really want to see it animated too ;_;</br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit he looks so washed out compared to melty. How did I not realize this immediately.</br>  <br>RAIDAAA</br>  <br> not knowing who Shiki is <br><br>fucking die you secondary scum holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What is these?</br></br></br>  <br>It was mentioned in BL by the guys who actually translate and give the information, so it's probably true. Still, they did not know if it was a joke or not.</br>  <br> UBW needed to sell over 100k for HA to happen <br><br>It's going to sell 70k in Japan alone. It's going to happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Not being uncomfortable about sex doesn't mean that he does not like writing it, at least when Tsukihime was being written.</br>    Fuck this shit, I thought that was Oreki from the thumbnail and Hyouka s2 was announced.    <br>He looks just like neo-Ciel.</br>  <br>Fuck you we've been waiting 7 years<br>7 YEARS</br></br>  <br>Who's this fluid druid?</br>  <br>I'd love to see the scan.</br>  <br>please don't use double negatives, that hurt to read</br>  <br>That fucking retarded archer design.</br>  <br> wanting a second season of a shit series instead of a well deserved remake </br>  <br> thickrimmed instead of huge round granny glasses <br>Takeuchi going wild with the designs, I can hardly recognize him.</br></br>  <br> That fucking ahoge <br> fucking glasses <br> What is his persona again? </br></br></br>  <br>Probably a good thing. Shiki has always looked like shit.</br>  <br>laid back delinquent</br>  <br>But anon they're not redoing the CGs and the sprites. They are going to rewrite every fucking line. Shiki won't be even a rapist anymore. How can you want that to happen?</br>   Arcade's skirt and intakes are gone   does anyone have that screenshot of shiki raping kohaku ?  <br>So be it, at least he'll have a personality.</br>  <br> which one? </br>   beeing this hyped <br>you guys can wait 3 more years for the villain designs</br>  <br>Damn, he looks extremely moe.<br>Wouldn't his field of vision be different with those glasses though?<br><br>Give him grandpa glasses like Mikiya has, it would be fashionable nowadays.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lol, that one bad end from the Ciel route</br>  <br>3 more years of replaying tsukihime, kagetsu, and melty</br>  <br>ORT</br>  <br>But Shiki isn't meant to have one. How the fuck am I supposed to self insert as him if he has a personality?</br>  He got the same treatment Shirou has gotten. Kawaii ass face and thicker super fluffied hair.  There is a Chibichuki chapter somewhere in this book and a lot of artist have featured manga and artwork in it. Will a please get it posted?  TOHNO GLAND STRONG AS EVER  <br>I like it, better than the old VN design. I still prefer the manga design though.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=yLK<wbr>3B7SySFs</wbr>  [ ]  IMPORTANT POLL<br>http://strawpoll.me/4784295</br>  <br>I was completely fine with all the other designs, even Ciel's who looks completely different. This on the other hand is way too much.<br>Shiki's not the same without his trademark giant circle glasses</br></br>  <br>are you shit talking about prisma fluffy shirou</br>  <br>He probably does who Shiki is, he's just saying that his redesigned just looks like a black haired Shirou. It's just a bad case of same face, which Takeuchi has always had an issue with.</br>  <br>But it's great?</br>  <br>THE HYPE IS REAL HOLY SHIT</br>  <br>Arcuied is not the same without her skirt, either. It's a remake, not a HD remaster</br>  <br>It is beyond me how wuss like Waver ever became that badass even considering his participation in the Holy Grail War.</br>  <br>Should i care if i only read the manga?</br>    <br>Another problem is that Shirou and Shiki have always had pretty similar hair, and that has gotten even worse now that they have both gotten fluffy-fied.</br>  <br>It's true suffering.</br>     Posting the shit Shiki   <br>Fucking shit she looks good with her drills on one side.</br>  <br>HYPE<br><br><br> There will be her H-scene with her hair down, right ? </br></br></br></br>  <br>Squats and oats my friend.</br>  <br> h-scenes </br>  <br>what's the matter? 2cool4u?</br>  <br>Hopefully we'll get h-scenes at all</br>  <br>Then he'd be designed by Nakahara, right? Though there's still the possibilty of another Indian Archer in Fragments.</br>  <br>which vol is this from?</br>   God Tier: <br>Melty Blood<br>Manga<br> Good tier <br>Carnival phantasm<br> This was made in 2000 tier <br>Original Tsukihime<br> What the fuck are you doing tier <br>Remake</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying he's not gay for Shiki?</br>  <br><br>Stuff that will be in Strange Fake 3.<br><br> Anyway, we're getting a third protagonist in the third volume according to Narita. <br> One of Faldeus' men apparently. <br> Zelretch can't directly act in Strange Fake since him acting will make the world line definite, but Narita is strongly hinting that Alcatraz will, and he's very connected to what Franceska's true identity is. <br> Some revelations on what was meant about Gilgamesh and Enkidu's "monster hunting" quote that was mentioned in one of the previews. <br> Gilgamesh being confirmed by Narita as having Clairvoyance like Merlin so so it seems like he can use it to see other parallel worlds, but it looks like the Throne of Heroes adjusts his memory and knowledge according to what world he's summoned in so he doesn't get confused. <br> Also seems to be some other hints about what the workings of the Greater Grail are actually based on from the thing I just mentioned. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Side mouth <br><br>You had one fucking job, Takeuchi</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just something he does now.</br>  <br>That was not remotely hard to read. The double negative is required for the semantics of the statement that that post is making to work properly.</br>    <br>Everyone is gay for Shiki no matter what their sexual preferences may otherwise be. That doesn't count.</br>  <br>Nasu should threaten him to not let him draw more sabers if he keeps doing those awful sidemouths</br>  <br>this is old</br>  <br>Why exactly did Shiki decide to carry his expensive fruitknife with him again?</br>  <br>Fuck off bot.</br>  <br>No that's new.

People seriously overblow this shit.</br>  <br>That legendary T shirt.</br>  <br>I really don't see it dude.</br>  <br> what Franceska's true identity is <br>But we already know!</br></br>  <br>She is not human at all.<br><br>Maybe she is Prelati though.</br></br></br>  I know there's more, quit holding out on me you son of a bitch  <br>You know what I want from nasu?<br><br>Something new.<br><br>I know it's too much to ask for, but I just want him to write a continuation of one of his stories.<br><br>Would beat the hell out of rehash after rehash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kohaku made him open it(the inheritance), and he was running late/made leave immediately so he didn't have time to put it in his room.</br>  <br> 褐色の肌と生気に満ちた瞳、そして深紅の大弓を携えた。伝説にうたわれる<wbr>弓の名手。かつて彼は、戦いのなか で数千人にも及ぶ人民の命を救うという偉業を成し遂げたという。 </wbr> <br><br>Ring any bell?</br></br></br>  <br>Nice blog.</br>  <br>What if he made notes into part of Turkeyhandle 2 and showed Shiki becoming Satsujinki</br>  <br>Nasu wants the same. That's why the Tsukihime remake is taking so long, because he doesn't give a shit about it but feels like he needs to throw the fans a bone.</br>  <br>That would require Nasu to stop playing Souls games using Saber builds while Takeuchi watches.</br>  <br>I'm only noticing differences in the hair. Shiki's is longer and has a little ahoge.</br>  <br>don't forget the eyebrows.</br>  <br>It looked better in monochrome</br>  <br>It might be easier to tell if their noses didn't look exactly the same.</br>  <br>I don't think arai gives a shit. So we either wait until someone else picks up the magazine, or hope that he decides to scan a couple more pages.</br>  <br>which already makes him a different person</br>  <br>Shiki's features are softer. Shirou's eyes are larger and his chin is a lot more pronounced. They have the same nose but that's because Takeuchi only knows how to draw a curved line.</br>  <br>Is it just me, or does Shiki's new design remind me of Potter Kun?</br>  <br>They look pretty similar to me. They're just positioned differently because they're making different expressions.</br>  <br>If she's a demon/vampire, why would she need to change bodies?</br>  <br>She still has a zipper in those.<br><br>Maybe she is just masquerading as a human and she has to change bodies for some unexplained reason.</br></br></br>  <br> Fate on Steam <br> Saber emoticons <br> Servant cards for badges <br> Profile background with gears <br> &gt;Achievement for finishing Sparks Liner High <br><br>Want.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disappear.<br>This shirt is an eyesore.<br>This shirt.

Why does Doflamingo has such great following anyway<br><br>I don't remember past villains having so many fans</br></br>  Final boss of an arc worship is cool and all, but when it gets to this point: http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Donq<wbr>uixote_Doflamingo where the wiki reads like a fan fiction, that's just not cool, anons.</wbr>  <br>Probably because he had so much hype behind him even as far back as Skypiea. He had a huge bounty, he shat on Bellamy and crew, said some cool stuff, controlled some Vice Admirals, Didn't get touched in the War, said some cool stuff there too and even post TS, he's been kind of a badass. Is he the epitome of perfection ? I don't think so. But he certainly deserves some of the attention he's getting.</br>  What were they talking about?  <br> huge <br> pink <br> cocky <br> secretly a family man <br> always smiling even when he's upset <br><br>could also be the aesthetic. The man wears a Vneck and capris under a featherboa coat and old lady glasses<br><br>could also also be the decadence</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Old times. Obviously.</br>  Fuck Oda, he actually believes Rubber is unaffected by Electricity. I couldn't even believe Oda would bullshit an opponent like that. One Piece gets shitter every time a boss battle happens. <br><br> Hypes of bad guy to be unbeatable and worlds ahead of luffy in power <br><br> MUH NAMAKA AND PROTECTING PEOPLE <br><br> Plot Armor and bullshit logic activates killing the OP villain.  <br><br>Just like a shonen, at this point I don't even care anymore. There's no point in even bitching, and yet the Japs made this the most popular anime of all time?

OP threads are generals since ages</br></br>  Why has one piece become awful?  <br>Because chopper stopped being a actual character</br>  <br>That image made me all warm and fuzzy inside.</br>  <br> less than 2 years <br> ages <br>Nah cunt, nah.</br></br></br>  <br> complaining about cartoon logic <br> complaining about plot armor for a protagonist of a battle shounen <br>please be bait or shitty pasta</br></br></br>  <br> not liking Armored Franky or Gear 4th </br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>because you obviously like edgy designs more than goofy ones, but then you should not even read One Piece in the first place</br>  <br> less than 2 years <br>seems like you really are new whore and you basically admited that you were lying, now fuck off</br></br>   You will never be part of Doflaminga's family <br> You will never have hot sweaty sex with her after a day of illegal traffic of weapons and pillaging. </br>  <br>6 months or 9, what's the difference, not that big a time. OP threads used to be on chapter release, and then maybe on sunday.<br>If you don't remember this, or actually prefer the cancerous general, then you're the newfag mate, not me.</br></br>  <br> Implying I want to be part of the biggest job fest of the entire series even for Doflaminga. </br>  <br> OP threads used to be on chapter release, and then maybe on sunday. <br>that was like three years ago or more iirc m8, what the fuck and I belive we had more threads back then not just on those days, but yeah not like now.</br></br>  <br> the biggest job fest of the entire series <br>that is Hodys crew though</br></br>  <br>Doffy and Mihawk look beautiful, Crocodile looks decent, everyone else are nightmare fuel.</br>  <br> that was like three years ago or more iirc m8 <br>Wait what? That can't be right.<br>Too lazy to check the archives myself though.</br></br></br>  <br> genderbent Shichibukai <br> Hancock is still the hottest </br></br>  What the hell kind of beast can withstand a kong gun?  <br>I even think more than that dude.</br>  <br>King Kong</br>  <br>Jesus Burgess.<br> tfw your memory is shit </br></br>  <br>No, they were made to be utter shit. Doffy's crew should have been incredible. Top notch. Not a single shitty jobber. But nope. I mean, I understand why they were jobbers but I still don't want to be a part of that.</br>   Sai gets to bang that   <br>I swear that this is becoming spam/bait/bs like that "Lucci pasta"</br>  <br> Jinbe:"Nice body" <br><br>well then. Jinbe potentially has some hidden depth</br></br></br>  <br>They met average expectations. You forget that most villains have garbage underlings and one-shot, one-kill fights are common.<br><br>It's not like the Strawhats even 1v1 the DonQuixote crew, famous New World pirates did most of the fighting/jobbing.</br></br></br>  Ok everyone! Its that time of the thread! Time for Sanji hate!<br><br>Sanji is the worst character in all of One Piece, all he is, is a beta white knight. He's the most disloyal member of the crew and he'd gladly betray Luffy and the other Straw Hats for a pair of giant tits. <br><br>Post timeskip he's gotten even worse, all he did was nosebleed over a bunch of mermaids. On punk Hazard he couldn't even kick down a door. <br><br>I can't wait until we see him lying in a pool of his own blood after jobbing to big moms crew. Hopefull we'll see him next chapter. <br><br>Oda should either give him an okama mode or kill him off</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd tap FemLaw tho. And She-Killer has nice boobs and sexy neck.</br>  <br> posting pasta that is not even stale but dead by now </br>  Okay, here is the deal: I want to reread Dressrosa, but I just noticed my go-to page for OP only has the latest 30 chapters due to copyright reasons. Where should I go for rereads?  <br>Download from nyaa.se and read in mangameeya.<br><br>Alt. bato.to</br></br></br>  <br>I'd say kissmanga since you can scroll down through pages instead clicking through.<br><br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/One-Piec<wbr>e</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, thanks!<br><br><br>Thanks, but I don't feel like downloading stuff. Just a habit of mine, and kissmanga seems less convoluted aswell.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is magnificent.</br>  <br>The most annoying thing has to have been that fucking golden ball that should incinerate Luffy completely since it was molten when it touched him.<br>Also, holy shit the horsepower and traction on Nami's scooter.<br>But I agree with the others, you are getting 3 autistic 5 me</br></br></br>  <br>He had the best lines during Marineford<br>Only reason I can think of, I personally think he's a faggot</br></br>   tfw we will never see him again   <br>him being a faggot might actually make him more popular.</br>  <br> on the visually appealing side. <br> psychotic but protective of his family. <br> Got some background to his character <br> Might not be the most complex character but just enough to question if he would've turned out differently in different circumstances <br> despite opinions of the final fight, he still comes off as a strong fighter <br> built up hype carrying over </br></br></br></br></br></br>  You know what I'd like to see? More logia users (or paramecia for all I care) that use their abilities to keep machines running or something. I don't mean that their ability has to be machine-related or anything, but sorta like Enel powering his arc, he just sits in the middle sending his electricity inside to keep it going.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127354642 <br> What happened to him anyway? <br>Clearly, he returned to Sniper Island, where he lives to this day.  In our hearts. </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127354642 <br>You can melt a rubber band with a fucking match, gold's melting point is like 1.1k °C. Honestly it was the only thing that bothered me that arc.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127355007 <br>Prove it.</br>  <br>Why did you make this post?<br><br>Does that symbol mean nothing?</br></br></br>   post yfw Vegapunk develops Seastone Logia   <br> Boning Fem!Doffy <br> Not boning Fem!Diamante <br>She's more flexible.</br></br></br>  <br>Well he "Needs" Her for...things and...stuffs</br>  <br>If I had the reaction image of that guy staring confused at the optical illusion I'd post that instead.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127355440 <br>Hahaha, it's funny because he's BANNED!</br>  <br> wanting to do anything with Fem!Diamante <br>I don't even want to imagine what she'd look like</br></br>  Post yfw Shanks took out half of Kidd-Apoo-Hawkings off-screen and befriended the other half.  <br> "So Vegapunk gave me this fruit, I now cannot Masturbate OR Swim, fantastic." </br>  <br>Well, they said they were going for one of the Yonkou, but it will probably be Big Mom. Maybe they helped the rest of the strawhats escape.</br>  hes going to die from the internal bleeding right?  <br>I forget, was smoker's bike in the manga?</br>  <br>At least it ain't Fem!Trebol or Fem!Pica (Gravely Voice)</br>  <br>If he isn't pronounced dead then oda is truly a hack</br>  <br>I think it will just be a copout of "strings fixed it and then it grew back together".<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127355793 <br>Yes, the symbol of tricks and memery.</br></br></br></br>  <br>did you already forget Pell?</br>  <br> Honestly it was the only thing that bothered me that arc. <br>it should not bother you at all since you should have noticed long ago that One Piece does not follow real life physics and laws</br></br>  So, Zoro actually did kill someone, hu?  I need u Nami  <br>Because his design is fucking amazing</br>   Real fight never <br> He won't be challenged till Shilliew or Mihawk </br>  <br>It would be strange for Luffy's first conscious kill to be one that does the tenryuubito a favor.</br>  <br>Vista<br><br>Also, come on, he was probably the most fucked up after every fight pre-timeskip, in every arc. I think he deserves this small break, though only if he actually gets to have a proper opponent in the next arc.</br></br></br>  <br>If you're a homosexual or a transvestite, maybe.</br>  <br>k.</br>  <br>Not even a b8 m8, I'm serious. He looks like he is about to attend the pride festival.</br>  <br> Big Fat Ugly Bug-Faced Baby-Eating O'Brien </br>    <br>L</br>  <br>I am neither but I think his design is pretty cool.</br>  <br>That's because you're a closet homo</br>  So, if Elizaberro got the mera mera no mi, would he have been able to charge up his king punch instantly due to the heat, and become a yonko killer?  <br>This page transribes Bartolomeo as "Balto Romeo".</br>  <br>If the punch didn't kill them, the wave of heat in front of it would give them a shock.</br>  <br>well, that sucks. didn't know that. if you don't mind mangastream translations then you can read it here too<br>http://www.mangastream.to/one-piece<wbr>.html<br><br>or bato.to has powermanga translations but they only have up to chapter 789. They translate slower, but probably have the best translations.<br>http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/one-p<wbr>iece-r39</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>No, it's no big deal. I just found it funny.</br>  Kaidou &amp; his crew are going to have to really shine to outdo this guy.<br>Not to mention he may be a broker now.</br>  <br>Just imagine hundreds of luccis. That's kaido's crew.</br>  <br><br>shhh you can't talk about him here.</br></br>  <br> that shit trigger discipline </br>  <br> He seriously thinks Doffy is going to die <br><br>I mean, I think Monet's dead and even I'm sure Oda's gonna bullshit some way for him to live</br></br></br>  <br>He's fought literally only three people so far (I'm not counting that bullshit against Hody) and Pica did give him a hard time, I mean its not like he one-shotted him, he did have to actually put on his headband again.<br><br>Wano is literally the sword island so he'll have to get a real fight there</br></br></br>      <br>pretty sure he has both hands, the hook is just a weapon</br>  <br>Kaidou arc is not gonna be anytime soon. Too early for Luffy to fight a yonko yet.<br><br>Next arc is probably Kuma. It been implied already that the straw hats are gonna fight him again in the new world.</br></br></br>  When?<br><br>It's now the most pressing plot item...after having a party.</br></br>  <br>Why has no one shopped a "ur" at the place of the BIG on the sail yet?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127360262 <br>I'm Canadian and I don't own any guns though.</br>  <br>Probably in a month or so</br>  English VAs for the Supernovas were announced if anyone still cares  <br>I saw. Levi is Law<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/sPyUUi38_U4?t=2m4s<wbr></wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Link pls</br>  <br>jesus christ<br>this is so awful <br>only the supreme commander is fine</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah and Yusuke is Kidd.<br><br>Honestly, I actually like his voice and I think that one would be better suited for Law</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt Zoro will ever fight Vista. I can't see Vista having a beef with Ace's brothers friend, all those Whitebeard fags care too much about family and stuff. Don't say he has to fight everyone to be the #1, he can just beat Mihawk and be the de facto top.</br>  <br>Because Vista is a bad guy!<br><br> No, really, that's an existing retarded fan theory, because he has a tophat and "evil" moustache, and only joined Whitebeard's crew to get the diamond fruit to be an invincible sword fighter and his now Blackbeard's henchman and in Zoro's fight with him Zoro will learn to cut diamond. </br></br></br>  <br>Urouge is the link between seeing Eneru again. I can feel it</br>  <br>Why would they fight Kuma? He has no agency beyond what the government tells him to do. Kuma will have a big role when the Revolutionaries or Vegapunk do<br><br>Wano will probably involve Kaido indirectly, with the big boss being someone samurai related or one of his underlings</br></br></br>  <br>jozu has the diamond fruit<br>do these people even read the fucking thing?</br></br>  <br>Could he kill Mingo?</br>  <br>Yes, he wants to kill Jozu.</br>  So, it's been a like two years since Law's shichibukai status was removed, will we get to know his succesor soon?<br>I mean, there are two unknown ones now, and I am afraid Oda is kinda running out of ideas for these guys, seeing how he gave the job to Buggy.</br>  <br>It's been 2 hours in story since we learned Doffy lied about his Warlord status. Nobody could be chosen yet, and nobody probably will be. Shichibukai will be disbanded before a new 7th could matter</br>  So now that release day shitposting is (mostly) gone, who else actually liked that last chapter?  So, Doflamingo was called the strongest of the shichibukai (I think when he showed up against Smoker), which means he is stronger than Mihawk. Mihawk used to tie with a yonkou, Shanks, though maybe Shanks did not use his haki during those fights, and only his sword.<br>What does that tell us?<br> powerlevels </br></br>  <br>Honestly all I could imagine was how it would look in the anime.<br><br>That said, anybody who can't feel for Kyros as he smiles and then finally sheds tears for the first time in a decade has no soul</br></br></br>  <br>when and where was Doffy ever called the strongest Shichibukai?</br>  <br> So, Doflamingo was called the strongest of the shichibukai <br>No he was not</br></br>  <br> read more mature stuff like Tokyo Ghoul <br><br>what the fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, it depends on what the original japanese phrasing was here, and if it can be taken as face value.</br></br>  <br>I'm quite sure that isn't insinuating he's the strongest, just that he's the biggest asshole</br>  <br>I think the stongest will be the 7th one that we haven't see yet.</br>  <br>Worst does not mean strongest, it can mean most cruel.</br>  <br>Yeah, probably.</br>  <br>It is in chapter 699, just in case any moon speaker feels like looking it up. Though I suspect it ro probably just mean "cruel" or "giant dick", as those other anons implied.</br>  <br> ドフラミンゴ？七武海？最悪な野郎じゃねェか！！ <br> Doflamingo? Shichibukai? Saiakuna yarō ja nē ka! ! <br><br>Usopp is saying that he's the worst as in he's a nasty evil bastard. Not the he's the strongest person in the shichibukai.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Agreed, it says he's the nastiest. Fucking translators.</br>  <br>Worst and nastiest are synonymous in English. Nasty doesn't read as well</br>  <br>Still, it's more appropriate than worst.</br>  <br>Worst is fine in that situation. I have no idea why anybody would think that would mean strongest especially since Usopp is the one saying it</br>  <br> Pica did give him a hard time <br> Literally never landed a single attack </br></br>  <br>Yeah but it's not like Zoro was able to easily deal with him like drunk fish guy and Monet</br>  What penguin was there on that island that needed a good boy gun to be put down?   this lil shitter never became nakama <br>MAKE IT CANON ODA</br>  <br>that's just because pica kept running away like a bitch. Pica couldn't do shit to Zoro and neither did anyone else post-timeskip. I hope he actually gets a challenge in Wano where there are real sword masters.</br>  How NIPPON DAMASHI are we going to go with Wano?  <br>Mondo nippon damashi.</br>  How BTFO would Lucci be if Luffy used King Kong gun on him?  You guys like dub cast announcements, right?<br><br>http://onepiecepodcast.com/2015/06/<wbr>29/the-eleven-supernovas-english-du<wbr>b-cast-revealed/<br><br>The Supernovas:<br><br>Trafalgar Law – Matthew Mercer (Levi, Jotaro Kujo, Chrom)<br>Jewelry Bonney – Laura Wetsel (no notable roles)<br>Capone Bege – Kyle Hebert (Kamina, Teen Gohan)<br>Basil Hawkins – T.

I really sympathized for him since he wasn't absolutely evil, he was only groomed by his current family to be who he is.<br><br>I kinda hope Oda pulls a Lordgenome with him and makes him a SH ally for mariejois if he's not confirmed dead in the next chapter. He could fuck shit up there since he hates them too.</br></br>  <br>Was wopple a world noble</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Doffy's own flashbacks indicated that he was always going to be an evil little shit even without his Family's help</br>  <br>A thousand good boys, you say. Hmm</br>  <br>Yeah this. Remember in 782 that even the family were surprised that he fucking decapitated his father's head and took it to Mariejois. Then when Law mocks Trebol telling him that Doffy is just stringing the seats along like puppets, Doffy yells at Trebol not to listen.</br>  So what happens thursday?  <br>Either realization that half the crew is missing, or a party</br>  Did all the doffyfags leave the thread finally. Did they all finally realize that their worthless character got permanently destroyed?  <br>Sabo's fight with Burgess needs to be resolved.<br>Doffy's body needs to be claimed<br>Fujitora could let everyone go or decide to take some people with him<br>Bellamy might still be dead<br><br>I'm really excited for anything that's not a party or Sabo showboating. I do really like the idea that Sabo tries to kill Doffy for his crimes and Luffy is ideologically opposed to the RA's extremism though</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those brief scenes of the executives finding a 10 year old Doffy and decided to pledge themselves to him need to be expounded on. It still looks like Trebol was masterminding something. Is he even alive?</br>  <br>Speaking of the dub, why is it so terrible?<br>I mean, I know dubs arent held highly on /a/ but usually actiony kind of anime are at least passable.<br>But its all just so awful. Everyone just sounds bored all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>that's because you're dumb<br><br> Hook <br> has Crocodiles <br> has poison <br> 'dies' under a giant clock <br><br>why the fuck wouldn't Captain Hook have a hook for an arm?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Since Kuzan lost a leg and has a lot of burn scars, what does /a/ think happened to Sakazuki's body after the 10-day battle?  <br>I can't believe I never got the Captain Hook thing before<br><br>Oda still hasn't shown the bottom left side of his face or his left side, so he could be pretty fucked up</br></br></br>  <br>Sucka didnt lose so nothing<br><br>Kuzan's wounds were probably Suckazuki being a shit and trying to kill Kuzan after he couldn't fight anymore</br></br></br>  <br>im also fairly certain that Mister 3 is Mister Shmee<br><br>there are probably more reference but i've never actually read the books</br></br></br>  So any ideas what this guy's been up to in those two years? Any chance of running into him in the new world any time soon?  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=63n<wbr>_5TyTVUA</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>We have seen him. And we saw him lose his cool.</br></br></br></br>  You're all faggots    What kind of slave would adult Koala be?  <br>Only Chopper has turned to shit, Luffy is fine and Frankys post timeskip design grows on you over time.</br>  <br> Implying Wano won't give him a challenge </br>  <br>The arc that made me drop One Piece 6 months ago.</br>  <br>I wouldn't classify it as terrible. Compared to the 4kids dub, it's definitely better.<br><br>While I agree that the dub is nowhere near the original version (after all, Oda designed several characters with their voice actors in mind), it does its job well enough. And honestly, the "bored"-soundedness is just an end result of the Japanese being able to emote more strongly than American actors. No idea how they do it.</br></br></br>  <br>He'll take off his shirt one chapter and reveal that half his body is simply igneous rock.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127370791   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VjQ<wbr>rA0usWMk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>i'm going to enjoy this scene a lot in the dub</br></br>  <br> one piece will never ever go back to what it was during and before water 7/enies lobby <br>when I die I want oda to lower me to the grave just so he can let me down one last time</br></br>  <br> he totally hit that rubber ass </br>  <br>I wonder<br>can kizaru infuse his beams with haki?</br></br>  <br>chopper's horn point isn't that bad and franky looks awesome when he uses his old haircut <br>what's wrong with G4?</br></br>  <br>I wonder<br>can Kizaru beams be melted by Jet Pistol?</br></br>  <br>Um yeah</br>    You know what, I've given it time and I really don't like Franky's post-timeskip design.<br><br>Before that I thought his design was awesome but right now it's just a jumbled mess of elements.<br><br>Not only that but his character got neutered as well, imho.</br></br></br></br>  Do you think there will still be people who think Riku is the bad guy after he becomes king again? Do you think there will still be Doffy supporters in the city who don't believe that Doffy was the villain?<br><br>Also, my bet that Rebecca will be the new Queen of the land and Riku will hand over his title or whatnot.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127370791 <br> those hickeys <br>is this the ultimate form of love?<br>If it's not hickeys in fanart it's bite marks.<br><br>I don't get this fetish at all.

Oda got off his ass and directed Z (and Strong World) himself</br></br></br>  <br>Characters are canon events aren't anon</br>  <br>can you source your info?</br>  <br>why not</br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about<br><br>Oda wrote the script and a bonus chapter for Strong World and came up with some character concepts for Z. That's it. Shiki is a canon character that exists in the One Piece world, but nothing that happened in the movies is canon.</br></br></br>    <br/>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/enc<wbr>yclopedia/people.php?id=31129<br>http://myanimelist.net/people/12867<wbr>/Nagamine_Tatsuya<br><br>Holy shit, I can't believe somebody is actually stupid enough to believe Oda directed two movies. Especially since the movies explicitly contradict canon. When the fuck do you think Film Z even takes place?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>This is drawn by Oda, right ?</br>  <br>There's no way oda would create anything where Kizaru would get that flustered but someone like Z</br>  <br>bullshit, we always have moments like that between arcs</br>  <br>this gif should be updated so it has Robin dancing with the SH's, after this arc she definitely belongs with the goofs</br>  <br>It's signed 'Takumi'</br>  <br>good catch</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>So Z isn't canon but Strong World is since Oda wrote the script?<br><br>THIS scene is canon</br></br></br>  <br> Oda wrote the script and a bonus chapter for Strong World and came up with some character concepts for Z. That's it. <br>Aohige clarified a while ago at APforums that Oda said himself in the guidebook that came with Film Z that he was the supervising producer/wrote the story and characters himself/wrote and oversaw character lines. If you want the specific page where Bluebeard states this I'd have to search, it's bookmarked on another computer of mine that's out of reach.</br></br>  <br>it's not canon just because it makes you wet</br>  <br>but Oda did that scene himself<br><br>He WROTE Strong World. How is that not canon?</br></br></br>  <br>D: Odacchi! Congratulations! They're doing another One Piece movie. But this time, it's your script, right? I'm really looking forward to it!! ...and, when I was watching the movie trailer on my computer I heard the word "Kinjishi" come up - but isn't that the flying pirate who broke out of jail 20 years ago that Sengoku mentioned in chapter 530!? There has to be some connection, right!?<br><br>O: Yes. "Kinjishi". Actually, I really wanted to have his name come up in the scene where Shirohige talks to Shanks in volume 45. But I thought at the draft level that I was handing out too much information and confusing the readers, so I took it away - but in my mind, I have determined that he is one of the legendary pirates who played a big part during Roger's time. Though I didn't think I'd make a movie about him. In any case, "Kinjishi" escaped from Impel Down, and now that 20 years have passed, he's finally starting to make a move, and that's what the movie is about. There's an announcement on page 192.<br><br>Strong World isn't canon, but Shiki as a character is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's say just the events of Z really aren't canon does that change the plot of OP as a whole. And vice versa</br>  <br>how does this prove Shiki isn't canon? It says right in your quote that Shiki was always meant to show up but Oda didnt do it when he wanted to</br>  <br>Shiki*<br><br>Strong World</br></br></br>    <br><br>Like I fucking said in the post, Shiki's backstory is canon, but Strong World the movie did not happen.<br><br>Here's a really simple metric: Is it in the manga, or an SBS? If no, it's not canon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It proves he is, you misread what that anon said</br>  <br>Neither Shiki (Roger rival) or Zephyr (former Admiral) lived up to their reputation.<br><br>Oda has to stop making Luffy take down these big shots, he's ruining everyone else's hype.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>saying movies can't be canon is dumb when Oda writes the movie himself</br></br></br>  <br>There's a couple timeline errors just with the amount of time the SH's have spent in the new world, and the new marine headquarters in the film is different than the one in the manga. That's about it that I can remember offhand. Not too big a deal but enough to make it not quite match up with the manga.</br>  <br/>  <br>Whether or not Strong World is canon isn't too big a deal, as it more or less fits in between Thriller Bark and Sabaody, but there's a couple of things that don't quite match up, such as Brook mentions that it's his first time fighting as a Straw Hat against the flying fish riders, Zoro seems completely unaffected by his Kuma injuries throughout the movie.</br>  <br>I see so then to resolve the issue Oda would either need to out right address the conflicts or make the two films in questions non-canonical</br>  Who the fuck is this girl?  <br>there's a pic somewhere of Rayleigh pestering Drake but I have no idea where it is</br>   mfw shanks has the time time fruit   <br>girl from skypiea</br>  Would Oda be willing to make a legitimate stoner character?  Just once i want a OP thread that doesnt devolve into faggotry. They already got gay marriage in the states. Cant you leave One Piece alone?  <br> I'd fuck iva </br>  <br>shanks can swim though</br>  <br> posting Rebecca <br><br>no. Fuck you</br></br></br>  <br>Id give anything in this world to bash your head in with a rock. Id let myself be skinned alive, burned, stabbed, anything at all, just to be given the opportunity to mutilate one fujoshit for ruining the only thing i have on this planet.</br>  <br>Not too bad, Matthew Mercer was one of the VAs I hoped would take Law's role. I was so afraid it'd be JYB.</br>  <br>Maybe he wanted to eat the gomu gomu no mi at that time?</br>  <br>I think you're beyond hope if One Piece is 'all you have'</br>  <br>he was going to sell it for 5 mil</br>  oda made it so obvious that nami will get the yuki yuki fruit in one of her mums fruit  <br> mfw Shanks has an ocean Logia </br>  <br><br>fuck me then</br></br>  what power does ben beckman have?<br>kizaru shit himself when he pointed his gun at him</br>  <br> law and levi have the same seiyuu <br> law and levi will have the english va <br><br>the lore is getting too deep</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really dont care. Id take any punishment or ridicule. I literally have nothing but a show. And id gladly do anything just to feel my eyes roll back in pleasure and drool drip from my mouth to slam a blunt 35-50lb stone against a fujoshits head until the cranium shattered.</br>  <br>haki-imbued bullets</br>  <br>Fishman Island, Punk Hazard, and early Dressrosa had them goofing off with each other.</br>  <br>I really dont see how your lack of a life(social or otherwise) means I can't like what I like<br><br>you a christfag or something?</br></br></br>  <br>Oda already made One Piece gay with characters like Doflamingo.</br>  <br>Would break the devil fruit pattern that Oda indirectly confirmed.</br>  <br>He was bluffing, Kizaru went ahead and ignored him with no reprisal from Beckman.</br>  <br>Don't forget the okama, that is what he really thinks of all you homos.</br>  <br> kizaru shit himself when he pointed his gun at him <br><br>m8, Kizaru was being flirty. He did the same thing with Marco</br></br></br>  <br>whats the pattern?<br><br>why dont the marines have sea stone bullets?</br></br></br>  <br>No im not. I dont even have a problem with homosexuals. Its just something about people taking away the pure shonen aspect about this show makes me wanna do it. Like catcher in the rye and john lennon. One piece was my comfort after i lost some things. And i cant even go to a thread for speculation without someone trying to force relationships that dont exist in a show that doesnt need them. I could honestly say if i ever met someone irl who was a fujoshit for OP, I would end up in prison. Its not even rational, but thats how its.</br>  <br> trying to imply being compared to bon clay is a bad thing <br><br>I'm not even gay, but you should at least read the manga before talking shit.</br></br></br>  <br>that's just a cover<br><br>Look at Bentham and Inazuma</br></br></br>  <br><br>why didn't blueno door-door to the raftel?</br></br>  <br>That's almost slightly reasonable for a mentally ill adjusted person having the urge to bash somebodies head in.</br>  <br>I suppose. You lose enough people, and find something to use as a crutch just to keep some hope, so you dont blow your own head off, then have people constantly smear shit all over it, and see if you dont wanna crack a few skulls.</br>  <br> taking away the pure shonen aspect <br> trying to force relationships <br><br>M8 you may want to consider you have other issues if you feel that something is being taken away from you or forced onto you by seeing a picture with two dudes being cute together<br><br>Seriously, are you from texas/bible belt or something? You should maybe ask yourself why other people enjoying something you don't enjoy upsets you so much</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujoda found his true passion with drawing cute boys such as Dellinger and Cavendish.</br>  <br>you should maybe seek help<br><br>If you realize its a crutch then you should know its stupid to inflict your mental bullshit on others</br></br></br>  <br>my my, where have YOU been recently?</br>  <br>Not from texas. I dont care about religion. I sont care about who wants to marry who. I just want luffy to find One Piece without becoming everyones bottom, or rayleigh coming out of no where to molest children out of character which doesnt have to do with the plot, or whoch MALE character isnt a WOMAN. I just wanna see shit get fucked up and some lasers and a t-rex in a hat without everyone tripping over a dick every five seconds.</br>  <br> is that you, anon that wants Dellinger more than Robin? </br>  <br>Or maybe people should stop corrupting the damn story with perversion</br>  I guess the thread is dead and the worms are festering now <br>good job /a/</br>  <br> being this defensive about being a fujoshi legbeard </br>  <br>Do posts like I want to fuck Nami bother you as well? Or is it just the homoposters?</br>  <br>then why are you here in this thread?<br><br>If you just read the manga and ignore what other people are talking about, you'd be much happier<br><br>seems like you're inflicting punishment onto yourself and getting mad when you see something you dont like.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah it annoys me. I just wanna talk about the fucking story, and every goddamn thread derails into debauchery and perversion, and its always the fujoshit tumblr/reddit posters that start it. Its old as fuck and annoying.</br>  <br>how is fanart corrupting the story? How is people talking about ships and shit corrupting the story?<br><br><br>this guy just has me intrigued. The bullshit coming out of his posts is unreal. Wanting to kill someone for posting fanart is kind of extreme</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can like like fan art, but i cant like bashing someones brains in? What if thats art to me? Who are you to decide what is and isnt art?</br>  <br>because it makes no fucking sense to the story<br>you are making shit up with no bases, if you are hellbent on annoying people go make your own fucking thread about fanfiction and fan art, stop shitting up these threads<br>not even the guy wanting to kill you but I agree with him with you fags being annoying as fuck <br>you are the reason stories get bloated with fan service and shit like that</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only kinda ship talk should be about the thousand sunny or laws submarine or some goddamn coating.</br>  <br>nah sorry, just a random who yanks everything you post that has Bellamy in it<br><br><br>that doesnt make it less extreme. Honestly I think you're just homophobic. I never see anyone posting shit like that when its girls or even the beastiality pics that have been posted here lately <br><br><br>says who? This thread is for talking about One Piece and that's what's being done</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> because Tumblr is in the filename <br>More like because you are tumblr.</br></br>  <br> because it makes no fucking sense to the story <br><br>what does it matter though? It doesnt actually affect the story, it's just fans doing fan things<br><br> you are the reason stories get bloated with fan service and shit like that <br><br>everyone likes fanservice, not just fujo so you cant pin that on just fujo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>your fan fiction is not related to one piece<br>you are just using characters designs and names from one piece and distorting them for your own fan fiction <br>go make your own fucking thread and stop shitting this one</br></br></br>  <br> D: Odacchi! I noticed an amazing thing!!! It is that if you show the Straw Hat Devil Fruit users in numbers, it will be the numbers from 1~10!! <br><br> Luffy→Gomu Gomu (5.6.5.6.), Chopper→Hito Hito (1.10.1.10), Robin→Hana Hana (8.7.8.7.), Brook→Yomi Yomi (4.3.4.3.) <br><br> (1.3.4.5.6.7.8.10), but there is no (2.9), so is the one who ate the Nikyu Nikyu (2.9.2.9.) no Mi, Bartholomew Kuma, gonna be a Straw Hat next? Please tell me!!! P.N. SHANKUS.LOVE <br><br> O: WHAAAAAT?! (shock) Gosh that surprised me! Why was I surprised?! NO COMMENTTTTTTT!!!!!!!! NEXT!! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ive been here longer than Tumblr has existed tho. The aspies only flare up because they see the filename</br>  <br>well that's a nice opinion you have but you trying to make up rules for what should and should not be talked about is what gets you ignored</br>  <br>Because i have a job, and i come to the threads after work. I just responded to what i saw the most of which has NOTHING to do with OP discussion. And no youre not talking about One Piece. Youre talking about Fanfic and Fan art based off of a fictional idea that doesnt pertain to the original story. As far as being homophobic, i am not. Im against deviating from the original story or speculation about the future of the original story. no where is there a romantic side story between the main characters. Luffy isnt interested. Neither is zoro. Nami wants money. Rayleigh is old and doesnt fucking care. I could go on and on but youll never get it because you want to corrupt and pervert something.</br>  <br> Why was I surprised?! <br>Why would he respond like that, that practically gives it away, he should have been at least a little ambiguous, now it's so easy to guess who will join.<br><br><br>Is Gin dead, or if not, will he ever appear again?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think they'd let him wear it in impel down if it wasn't a prosthetic.</br>  <br> . Im against deviating from the original story or speculation about the future of the original story. <br><br>see this is a personal problem of yours. It isnt actually against the rules to speculate on things in the story that can or may happen in the future. No matter how convoluted you find it</br></br></br>  <br> the cover stories will never be animated as filler </br>  <br> well that's a nice opinion you have <br>There's a board designed to contain hazardous people like you, since you aren't discussing jackshit I say leave this pace.</br></br>  <br>he might be dead but we'll probably see something of him or Krieg in the future. Even if its only a flashback to Gin's burial at sea/gravestone</br>  <br> &gt;not wanting to see speculation or deviation from the canon <br> &gt;goes onto a discussion board full of anime fans <br>alrighty then</br></br></br>  <br>If you'd stop haranging me about shit you dont like to see maybe we could have actual discussion instead of your opinion on what YOU think can be posted in these threads</br>  <br>Good fanworks, though increasingly rare these days, can adjust the characters but maintain somewhat of a resemblance to their actual personality. Too often fans kind of create these alternate personas in their minds that bare no traits of the original.</br>  <br>I'm telling you that if you want to discuss gayshit then there's a board for it, that's it.</br>  <br>Holy shit its a shounen. SHOUNEN. look it up! Do you look at shounen and just see the words romance novel? There is no fucking romance. How can you not understand this? You want romance? Go read rurouni kenshin or some shit. Hell go read some harem manga i dunno. The vision is so fucking clear in this story yet you gladly throw sand in your own eyes to avoid the truth: NO ONE WANTS TO FUCK IN ONE PIECE. THEY JUST WANT TO GET TO RAFTEL AND BE THE PIRATE KING AND FIND THE TREASURE. Holy fuck.</br>  <br>Bellamy a cute.</br>  <br>That's the worst part, it wouldn't be filler in amny way, over half of them have had a direct impact on the story, and the other half foreshadow future story events.<br><br>Toei is so fucking stupid, Ace was so popular they inserted him into Alabasta filler and Oda handed them a canon Ace side story.</br></br></br>  <br>you say the same damn thing for any pics with tumblr in the filename though<br><br>there have been times where im discussing something completely innocuous and still get told to leave because its 'gay'<br><br>you guys just complain for the sake of it and shouldnt be surprised when you get ignored</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda has no problem with the fans doing what they wish, he accepts he accidentally attracted a peripheral audience but says he won't ever consider their input on his story for teenage boys.</br>  <br> It isnt actually against the rules to speculate on things in the story that can or may happen in the future. No matter how convoluted you find it </br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Actually I think Sanji and Franky might definitely want to fuck m8. Uh but not each other. And not like dudes either.</br>  <br>i dont remember ussop having such long arms</br>  <br> there's nothing gay to discuss in OP canon <br><br>okay</br></br></br>  <br>this artist has a thing for long arms it seems<br>didnt really notice until you pointed it out though</br></br>  <br> can <br> may <br><br>Said it yourself, its not against the rules to speak of what can and may happen.<br><br>But it wont. Im sorry. I really am. It sucks really bad and im so sorry. But none of this fujoshit, or straight shit is gonna happen. Ever. Its gonna be a great story with literally zero romance except a "man's romance" which refers to Adventure, not a relationship or sexuality. And im so sorry for you. But that means youre speaking of things unrelated, which is against the rules. So please.<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you say the same damn thing for any pics with tumblr in the filename though <br>I'm I (or any anon) supposed to be nice from someone who comes from there?<br><br> im discussing something completely innocuous and still get told to leave because its 'gay' <br>People get's their files deleted on /e/ when there's penetration or dicks in general, because there's a boards for it called /h/, why would people not complain when you like gayshit, come from tumblr, implied fujoshit, when you are supposed to keep that shit away?<br><br> you guys just complain for the sake of it <br>We don't call your shit and then this will be a SnK thread.<br><br> and shouldnt be surprised when you get ignored <br>I'm surprised you haven't left yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It isnt actually against the rules to speculate on things in the story that can or may happen in the future.  <br><br>nothing about your post negates mine</br></br></br>  <br> I'm I <br>Wanted too write "Am I"</br></br>  <br> can <br> may <br><br>Reality:<br> won't <br> ever <br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm I (or any anon) supposed to be nice from someone who comes from there? <br><br>maybe stop believing in every boogeyman 4chan creates?<br><br> People get's their files deleted on /e/ <br><br>nothing I ever post gets deleted for being in the wrong place.

Are you even a fan? If you were you'd know there isnt a possibilty for any type of relationship gay or straight, because thats not what the story is about or has to do with. How dense are you? Are you just fighting reality?</br>  So, was Kyros, like, a secret the entire time? Because Oda did not implement his character into the original Dressrosa flashback.<br><br>I mean, we see the king, we see the king talking to Tank, but Kyros is nowhere to be found.<br><br>Do we just chop it up to Kyros being a toy and being erased from the flasbhack?<br><br>This arc was pretty good, but it seems like things were just strewn in.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you put that goalpost back RIGHT now</br>  <br> Kenshin is also a shonen you autistic piece of shit, fuck onepiecefags are the most cancerous motherfuckers in existence. I hope you get raped and burned alive with lighter fluid by a bunch of niggers.<br><br> Now broaden your fucking horizons and start reading some actually good series or fuck off of /a/ you casual scum.<br><br> P.S. being a faggot or a woman should be a bannable offense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fine. How does luffy being a bottom get him to raftel? How does rayleigh being a creepy pedophile explain rogers past? How about nami sucking cock? Does that explain the florian triangle? Law fucking Bepo? Is that the secret to the five moons in the story?....wait... NO!? NONE OF IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE PLOT!? HOLY SHIT!!! MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP POSTING FANART LIKE RETARDS!!! OH MAN!!! Never would have thought of it..</br>  <br>Never mind, I'm stupid.<br>I forgot that Kyros went and married Scarlet and left the kingdom.<br><br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Suggest one better you fat fuck and maybe i wouldnt have to be in this shit thread. Calling the kettle black you mongaloid.</br>  <br>I mean you can jump to extremes if you want<br>you can not like ship talk<br><br>but it doesn't mean One Piece discussion is plot only. There are plenty of interpersonal relationships to discuss and there's nothing at all wrong with that<br><br>Just because you dislike it, doesnt make it wrong to talk about</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2edgy4me</br>  <br>Yeah you're right, there isn't. When the characters are represented properly compared to their personalities in the story. You posted ZORO.... Hugging.... SANJI...WHERE DO YOU GET THAT FROM THE STORY!? theyre rivals at best and dislike eachother you... Goddamnit why am i wasting energy on a retard. Youll never get it... Just take this shit and go to another board<br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br> Berserk, Vinland Saga, Vagabond, Oyasumi PunPun.If you want shonen then you should read Nanatsu no Taizai, Jojo's bizarre adventure, toriko, one punch man, hunter x hunter(the anime is slightly better) <br><br> Now go fuck yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Berserk - im tired of boats. Muira is almost dead anyway.<br><br>Vinland saga - shit<br><br>Vagabond - nice artwork shitter<br><br>Oyasumi punpun - never heard of it but with that name? Nah<br><br>NnT - are you even fucking trying?<br><br>JJBA - already done<br><br>Torika - and you called me an autist?<br><br>OPM - you get a pass. Atleast you have some taste.<br><br>HxH - no seriously. Im the autist?<br><br>Stepitupsenpai.jpeg</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you've really talked yourself into a corner, im surprised you're still at it honestly. Your last few post have been "I don't like it. It doesn't make sense so don't post here" <br><br>You completely fail to point out how posting possibilities and discussing what-ifs is wrong but keep going at it anyway</br></br></br>  <br>And you literally didnt explain why it IS okay, being how it doesnt make any sense to the plot, and makes it off topic. You sound like someone being snide after losing an argument. Again.<br><br> for FAN ART<br><br> for anything related to homosexuality<br><br>This is why those boards exist. Go post that there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And you literally didnt explain why it IS okay <br>it isnt against the rules<br><br> it doesnt make any sense to the plot, and makes it off topic <br><br>feel free to show me the rule that says only plot discussion is allowed. I'll wait</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  choosing OPM out of all the series i've mention <br>  not reading oyasumi punpun because of the name <br><br> Yes you are pretty fucking autistic actually, you could at least give it a chance instead of simply dismissing it because of the name you stupid nigger you might even find yourself enjoying it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>because he doesn't know where it is, dipshit.<br><br>and doordoor fruit obviously has limits in the distance it covers, which is why Blueno had to ride the train to Enies Lobby otherwise the CP9 would have just teleported instead.</br></br></br>  <br>Fred Phelps please go and stay go. Shouldn't you be picketing a soldiers funeral somewhere?</br>  <br>Don't ask for suggestions, get spoonfed then shit on what you are given, faggot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, from what ive seen your taste is shit, double nigger.<br><br><br>Dont even bring soldiers into it you waste of life.<br><br><br>Ill shit on anything when someone insults me for having a favorite manga, then when i ask for something better all i get is a list straight from edgelord-r-us and babbys first manga you fucktard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> whiteknighting soldiers </br>  <br> Rejects suggestions by title <br> Calls something babbys first manga <br><br>But how do you know whats in it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well aren't you just a ray of sunshine, I think this is enough /a/ for you today.</br>  <br>  not wanting to see faggot fan art of one of the series you like now makes you just as bad as Fred Phelps <br><br> I swear to fucking god i didn't even hate you mentally ill abominations before but this shit is ridiculous you faggots are even whinier than Anita Sarkeesian comparing gamergate to ISIS. Fucking day of the rope when?</br></br></br>  <br> Defending Fred Phelps <br> Fucking day of the rope when? <br>What are you on? No, seriously.</br></br></br>  <br> throwing a fit because someone posts fanart <br> shit up the thread for two hours <br><br>you ARE kind of garbage, anon</br></br></br></br>  Welp I think we all know what it's time to do.  <br>  implying i'm the autist that was shitting up the thread  <br><br> Actually no i was simply pissed off at the whiny faggot saying someone is literally Fred Phelps for complaining about gay fanart.<br><br><br> <br> I never defended Fred Phelps you stupid fucking faggot are you literally incapable of basic reading comprehension?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just found out Vivi has the same blood type as Luffy, yet another parallel between her and Jinbe, I'm not so sure he will join.  <br> Actually no i was simply pissed off at the whiny faggot saying someone is literally Fred Phelps for complaining about gay fanart. <br>Fred Phelps is that kind of person, "IN THE NAME OF OUR GOD LETS GO BITCH ABOUT THIS ON 4CHAN.", not that the WBC would stand a chance here of course.<br><br> I never defended Fred Phelps you stupid fucking faggot are you literally incapable of basic reading comprehension? <br><br>I looked over what you said, and I realized I'm an utter toolshed, sorry about earlier.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Ill shit on anything when someone insults me for having a favorite manga, then when i ask for something better all i get is a list straight from edgelord-r-us and babbys first manga you fucktard. <br><br> It's not my fault that your favorite manga is casual normalfag shit even worse than the series i have just mentioned, with the exception of toriko maybe.</br></br></br>  <br>Their homes both need them for stability.</br>  <br>FI doesn't need stability now that it's under Luffys control.</br>  Just finished the episode where Kyros becomes human and lops of Doffys head<br><br>Fuck, I've re read the previous chapter 12 times now.<br><br>This is so exciting</br></br></br></br>  <br>it's nice to see someone enjoying this arc</br>  <br><br>I love this arc too. I've reread the last 20 chapters in a row about five times now. It's just so good when read all at once.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I kinda want Oda to do more Arc finales like Dressrosa, Alabasta, and Sky Island.<br><br>Where Luffy is either in the sky or the villain is in the sky for all to see.</br></br></br>  <br> Where Luffy is either in the sky or the villain is in the sky for all to see them as they really are. <br>ftfy</br></br>  <br>Please, don't post the rest. Artwork is seriosuly disturbing even for fujo standards.</br>  <br>dude I posted that 2 hours ago<br><br>I was going to post the set, i'd have done so already</br></br></br>   binge read one piece last week <br> try to watch the latest anime episode <br> that sound mixing quality <br> that static image battle scene <br>Okay, /a/. Now I understand why you don't watch this anymore and stick to the source material.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Enel pls go</br>  If you look at the last page of 791 it looks like Kyros is crying on Luffys face, which is funny because Rebecca is crying on his face, and Kyros and Rebecca are father and daughter.<br><br>Was this intentional?</br></br>  <br> when you realize luffy could take out all of cp9 in minutes at this point <br>More like CPjobber</br></br>  <br>Ahh the old timeskip bias strikes again. re-read anon and you'll see plenty of it.</br>  <br>One Piece anime is good literally at random points.<br><br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/post/show/15<wbr>877/animated-effects-explosions-fig<wbr>hting-fire-one_piec</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Toei is pretty much trash because they don't care about their fanbase, they only want money. But at least they aren't as bad as Togashi and are at least giving us SOMETHING.</br>  You can tell when they actually try with the animation when Luffy's attacks move all slippery like actual rubber<br><br>http://sakuga.yshi.org/data/b92a35a<wbr>a705db22076607b160b92d1f9.mp4</wbr></br></br>  <br>Honestly I still thought that was animated like garbage, its just like the Dragon Ball Z movies at the moment where the camera just moves all over the fucking place and makes a huge mess</br>  <br>So, ke knew how to get a fruit that already eaten ? just like BB?</br>  <br> newfag is the strongest </br>  <br>How is that animated like garbage? You can actually tell the characters are physically moving.<br><br>Do you know how rare that is for Toei's fight scenes?</br></br></br>  <br>same</br>  <br> Do you know how rare that is for Toei's fight scenes? <br><br>But that's exactly it, that's the best they can do and it's still crap. It could be way better but it depends on their director at the time since they rotate them around so much.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy's attacks move all slippery like actual rubber <br><br>It's funny because Doffy's attacks are doing the same in this webm.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This is exactly the least quality I'm expecting, but I guess keeping distance between the manga is more important to the studio.<br>Like seriously, instead of burning money on fillers, they should have postpone airing and use said budget to make more decent effects. I wouldn't mind that.<br><br><br>Ooh, Anon. You made me chuckle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Like seriously, instead of burning money on fillers <br>Funny thing is they don't do that anymore</br></br>  <br>Oh come on, what progress does 699 actually make to the story? Just to immobilise Luffy so Doffy can do flashback. I don't think that should require 20 minutes. I don't mean fillers that went outside the source material, but anything that prolong the episode for no other reason but to keep the anime from lapping the manga in general.</br>  <br>yeah that's obviously not how it goes anon.</br>  Holy fuck would you tumblr fags fuck off back to your cesspool please?  <br>oh god, the truth makes me laugh hard sometimes</br>  <br>you're right he obviously was in fucking panic that time</br>  <br>you can fuck yourself m8</br>  <br>what power does shanks have for that matter</br>  <br>I think people wouldn't argue about logic if Oda didn't justify Luffys protection and only way to win against Enel with pseudo logic.</br>  <br>the power to stop wars.</br>  <br>Shanks doesnt have a DF ability <br><br>He's either just that badass or he rubbed himself all over the One Piece when he made it to Raftel with Roger<br><br>I think Dragon has something similar</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> arguing pseudo logic in a shonen <br><br>that's worse though. Once you realize Oda is bullshitting a little bit, that's the point where you let it go</br></br></br>  <br>He might have swordsmanship skills on par with Mihawk and then some shit on top of that to elevate him from mere "badass pirate tier" to Yonko tier. I'm one of those people that hope he got a nice DF after he saved Luffy but then again it may be just insane CoC Haki that makes him so fearsome, who knows.</br>  <br>The power to loose arms against fodder sea monsters.</br>  <br>right, mabye we'll never see shanks crew fight but im not sure how without devil fruits there fighting style is usually non df users are swordsman or have some weird fighting technique i just couldn't imagine his crew doing that, yassop's supposed to be extremely strong but as a sniper i cant see him being that great</br>  <br>didn't he lose his arm to impact ruffy to give him the drive to be great or something?</br>  <br>I thought there was a rumour long ago that says Dragon's ability has something to do with wind.</br>  <br>Yasopp has probably insane CoA and CoO feats seeing that Usopp slowly goes down that way too. Some of Shanks Crew surely have DFs and I think we will see some in action too but just not that much in spotlight as the other Yonko. The most common theory is that Blackbeards crew fucks them up some time later in the story but it's merely speculation this early</br>  <br> rumour <br><br>well there are plenty of those going around. I wouldn't put much stock into them</br></br></br>  <br>that sounds pretty likely but it would be stupid as fuck, they hyped shanks up so much if i dont get to see one serious fight with him i will be pissed</br>  <br>yeah you may lay it out that way but it still seems very anticlimatic since we know he's literally one of the four strongest pirates in the whole god damn world<br><br><br>it's pretty much a fact that it has to do with wind, where it originates from is the other thing though. Some say it's one of the acient weapons, others say it's a dragon or a weather DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br>idk im pretty sure oda changes the feel of shit as he goes like with haki</br>  <br>If Shanks is a DF user, it will be awesome if it's gravity.</br>  <br>Well we still don't know what the fuck Uranus is</br>  <br>Fucking Fujitora is gravity</br>  <br>I'm sorry to dissapoint you but we kinda already have that gravity thing covered<br><br><br>Oda seems to have noticed that he made logia powers fucking invincible so he had to come up with something I guess</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh lord, silly me I forgotten that blind bastard.</br></br>  <br>How could you forget not-Zatoichi?</br>  <br>Also Shanks can swim</br>  <br>I reckon Lucky Roo has the Luck Luck fruit. Pic related, someone else can probably make a better version.</br>  <br>many say he may have some speed related fruit as he shot that bandit fucker in chapter 1 out of nowhere. Would also fit the One Piece theme very well, that fat fuck being the fastest man alive and all.</br>  <br>Keep telling yourself that, newfag fujoshitl</br>  <br>if you wanted more, all you had to do was ask man</br>  <br>I'm not gonna answer that, Anon.<br><br><br>Something higher than haki or DF, I wonder what that will be... Damn you, Oda.<br><br><br>In the games, he's capable of jumping high and even sometimes flight. I agree with speed, though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want sabo to disappear forever  <br>were never gonna see thatch just post best boy</br>  <br>best boy you say?</br>    <br><br>ur shit m8</br></br>  <br><br><br>GODDAMMIT BLUE BOARD YOU ARSE</br></br></br>  <br> Something higher than haki or DF, I wonder what that will be... Damn you, Oda. <br>Or just NO devil fruit</br></br>  <br>Blackbeard is the most sexual being in One Piece.</br>  <br>there's nothing nsfw about either pic I posted<br><br>cant vouch for the Blackbeard meme though</br></br></br>  <br>I believe Shanks is not a Yonkou at that time.</br>  This man is Admiral level  <br>The designs for chopper are kinda ruined when you do take into account his development from "I don't want to be a monster, don't come near me" to "for Luffy's sake, I'll become a monster". The older designs are a lot more fitting for a character that was so worked up about his weird and scary appearances, now its just goofy and cute, which is still a nice aesthetic but it really throws his new growth and resolve under the bus when you don't invoke the fear that made you timid in the first place.</br>  <br>/tips fedora</br>  <br>But anon, it was God who said it.</br>  <br>Because Kizaru thought he was scary<br><br>Just like everyone he mentioned during the war</br></br></br>  <br>Kizaru is the most courageous man alive, he fears everyone with a good reason, and yet stands up to them.</br>  <br> that picture of pregnant bonnie being railed by black beard </br>  <br>Will we actually ever see Shanks and his crew fight?<br>I'd appreciate it if Oda showed the fight between Shanks and Kaido during Marineford as a beginning to the Kaido arc.</br></br>  <br>Luffys skyride is reserved for the pink dragon.<br><br> all those colored panels of pink dragons </br></br></br>  <br>Luffy must like chasing a pink dragon.</br>  <br>I think it's supposed to be one of the mermaids. The one with the freckles.</br>  homos please leave.  <br>Ishilly?</br>  <br><br>Aside from Blackbeard he was like the most hyped villain in One Piece. Maybe even more than Blackbeard because Blackbeard has already made his move Pre-TS and got jobbed hard while Doflamingo stood pretty much invincible throughout the entire series until Luffy plotarmor took him down.<br><br>Man, next Luffy is gonna roll over Mihawk because lol Gear 5th</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ishilly's hair is curly. that's not her</br>  <br>Sanji already did.</br>    <br>The worst part is that this image is something that could actually happen. They've danced together before.</br>  <br> Blackbeard jobbed hard <br>yeah I don't think you're using that word right in this context</br></br>  <br>It's Pandawoman</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's Pandawomen. Not even joking.<br><br> http://duskchant.deviantart.com/ar<wbr>t/One-Ass-Pandawoman-262891166?q=fa<wbr>vby%3Ajane-in-the-box%2F50353047&amp;qo<wbr>=11</wbr></wbr></wbr> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> jobbed against Magellan <br> jobbed against Luffy <br> jobbed against Sengoku <br> jobbed against Garp <br><br>The only battle he ever won was against Ace</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy <br> fighting Mihawk <br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>What do you meant ''worst'' ? You can hate fujos all you want but leave Bon-chan out of it. That man deserves all the love he gets.</br>  <br>one day they'll dance together again</br>  <br>Dude, what ? Magellan was the only person he straight up lost to. And Magellan pretty much destroyed everyone. ''Oh no, Luffy punched Teach once, man Teach is such a jobber''. That's what I'm reading right now.</br>  <br>Don't you mean Fear itself is the Kami?</br>  <br>I don't think you understand blackbeards character m8</br>  <br>There's literally nothing other than kizaru throwing his hands up then ignoring said threat to support that.</br>  <br> implying dende isn't kami </br>  <br>He knows, don't worry<br>Oda doesn't have alzheimers like another certain bestselling mangaka</br></br>  <br>You mean Dende is the Guardian of Earth.</br>  <br>What's /a/'s place to get proper subs for this? I stopped watching at 600 and want to catch up  it will probably take me a week... </br>  <br>Have we ever gotten a past fight like that though ? I mean, I can see a casual remark by someone saying ''I remember Shanks clashing with him before he ended the war'' and Luffy being moe and touching his hat or whatever. I don't think we'll ever see the fight though. Same with Akainu vs Aokiji.</br>  <br>We won't see the fight/confrontation anymore than we saw akainu and akoijis duel.</br>  <br>all the hype, plus in the first half of dressrosa he wasnt taking shit from anyone</br>  <br> watch <br><br>Zehahahaha!</br></br></br>  <br>mhm</br>  where did the painting samurai that was with kinemon go  <br>You don't watch One Piece, you read it.</br>  <br>How strong even was magellan? <br><br>Seems like if you lack any kind of Intel on his fruit, you're fucked. Probably mid shichibukai</br></br></br>  <br>sue me</br>  <br>I'm trying to help you, you ingrate ignoramus!</br>  <br>  watching scum here, there aren't any<br>especially not yibis</br> </br>  <br>Anyone without proper CoA would be fucked. I don't know how Poison, any kind of it, reacts with elements so I can't speak for Logia's. Magellan could be incredibly strong, considering that he's the Warden of the place that keeps Shichibukai's. Admittedly, they're in cells but you get the idea. <br><br><br>He was pushing the Birdcage with Zoro and Kinemon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>what about "horriblesubs"? I found a lot of those on kickass... any page where I can find the last 100 episodes?<br><br><br>too late to change now</br></br></br></br>  <br> what about "horriblesubs"? <br>  I'm not helping you anymore and I'm not explaining why </br></br>  <br>That's really helpful, I'm sure you have a lot of friends!</br>  Will Shiki ever have a role in the manga  <br>He unironically said on 4chan</br>  <br>Doubtful. Very highly doubtful.

It was more notorious in the first season with those 7K in the first week.

The power of omnipandering</br>  <br>They'll put a code for the game in every volume, though, right? No reason not to.</br>  <br>The fact that it did worse than Amagi is just frustrating. I even enjoyed it but Amagi was a pretty fucking dumb series. Hibike was superior in virtually every aspect, acting, writing, style, plot.</br>  <br>Utapri S4 better be fun, the third was such a letdown.</br>  <br>The magic of Sanrio.</br>  <br>All first 3 vol. comes with different event ticket and code, so the drop won't be big til vol.4.<br><br>Hibike vol.2 and 3 also have event ticket btw, but both are recently added, i wonder is that because Kyoani actual expected higher sales before vol.1 numbers are out.</br></br></br>  <br>Amagi could at least be fun.<br>Hibike was such a dumb drama about melodramatic highschool girls being melodramatic and cringe worthy.</br></br>  <br>I liked the the 3 one it made me like those Quartet guys, I skipped the second one</br>  <br>Second one was pretty funny in comparison.</br>  <br>Wow that's right, and the ticket lottery runs for the first three volumes, Show by Rock will remain strong.</br>  <br> 11,148 Yahari <br>How much did S1 sold again?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I mean, I was hoping for another dragon or Human Instrumentality like in S2. Best we got this time was HEAVENS shooting a laser beam at the audience and obliterating them.<br><br>They just became... really kind of boring and normal.</br></br></br>   *5,275 Nisekoi: <br>Too much for this crap.</br>  <br>I get it, if you prefer wacky talking animals and shit Amagi would definitely be more enjoyable. I just like the fact that Hibike avoided so many genre tropes in pursuit of a more realistic depiction of the band. You call it melodrama, but my high school team was almost exactly like that. Teenagers' brains aren't biologically capable of not being melodramatic.</br>  <br>I thought the lowest was that loli anime that literally sold like 20 copies including the author</br>  <br> **,494 Etotama <br><br>it's not fair</br></br></br>  <br><br>I like this list here about the number one movies around the world this week:<br><br>Argentina Jurassic World <br>Australia Jurassic World <br>Austria Jurassic World <br>Belgium Jurassic World <br>Bolivia Jurassic World <br>Brazil Jurassic World <br>Bulgaria Jurassic World <br>Chile Jurassic World <br>China Jurassic World <br>Korea Jurassic World <br>Denmark Jurassic World <br>Finland Jurassic World <br>France Jurassic World <br>Germany Jurassic World <br>Japan Love Live! <br>United Kingdom Jurassic World <br>Greece Jurassic World<br><br>That's fucking great.

I used to play netball in a very competitive and high level team during school. We had people leave halfway through and betray us and we'd get bitchy over team positions.

It simply is. Japan doesn't hate it, they just don't know about it. It's literally who-tier. <br><br>Number 2: Early bd sales released before the first episode was even broadcasted means that potential customer just don't know if they actually should really be buying the bds at all. What they'll see on broadcast might be what they'll get on the discs, and if they're going to invest money in the bds (which are helluva expensive in Japan), customers will expect something even better than that. Bonus fanservice content, higher framerates, visible nipples and vaginas*, far longer scenes, tickets to shake hands with the voice actors and to visit some idol events, reworked scenes eliminating mistakes, better colors, stuff like that. <br><br>*It of course doesn't help that the cast mentions that the bds won't have decensored titties and asses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 17,626 Kekkai Sense <br>Higher than I thought.

They barely interacted in the anime.</br></br>  <br>sure. it's a little slow storywise in the beginning, but it picks up. <br><br>be aware there are male characters that interact with each other so by definition this is fujoshit.<br><br><br>for KyoAni anything under 8-10k is grounds for sudoku</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not talking about the profit. But the sales number.<br><br>And Hibike is noticeably better looking than Amaburi. Yet doing much worse. Who'll take the blame on it? Seriously, their decision-maker in the production should be fired. And it seem Ishihara didn't learn anything from Chuu2Koi flop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what I thought initially too.<br>But as it went along it kinda managed to develop its own identity.<br><br>It's a lot less grim than SNK and the comedy bits are FAR FAR better.<br>In fact, the author should probably stick to more comedic stuff, that's clearly his talent.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, 5.7 with an event ticket causing DVDs to sell more than BD is a good thing.<br><br>Gonna drop hard next volume. Question is how much.</br></br></br>  <br>Too shit</br>  <br>I meant "early bd releases". Made a mistake by writing "early bd sales released".</br>  <br> from Chuu2Koi flop <br>That's what happens when you introduce a character solely for drama and to shit on her.<br>Only females like that, as proved by free 2.</br></br></br>  <br> muh ShinganCrimsonZ X Plasmagica ships <br><br>Shuzo and Rom's thing is in the game but I suppose they could have let the other three guys interact with the girls more.</br></br></br>  <br>Ship first, ask questions later</br>  <br>Mostly because Kyoanifags act like it's going to sold like 15k+ in 1 months ago.</br>  <br>better visuals can't save a trainwreck plotline</br>  <br>Don't you like fun, anon?<br><br>You sound like a total stick in the mud.</br></br></br>  <br>I never said Etotama had bad CG, just that SB69 has better. It clearly had more work and budget done on that and the only reason it gets shit on sometimes is because the style is pretty jarring compared to what we're used to.<br>And keep in mind this was sourced from the Funi stream which you probably already know completely butchers the video quality.

I love the OP, but I feel the ED is a bit weird after the way some episodes end.  Give it uo.<br>moot is not going to come back.</br>  <br>Everyone knows that</br>  Possibly my favourite anime of all time.  <br>I wish they'd do a NA blu-ray release</br>  Made me want to go into space.  <br>Well, congratulations.<br>You are in space.</br></br>  There were some amazing moments and some parts I thought were kind of a mess (the last arc was heavy on that). But overall I enjoyed it, the high points were worth it.  <br>You know what I meant assface, actually going away from earth into space.</br>  <br>Sadly, I don't think it's ever going to happen.</br>  <br>If it's getting out of the gravity well, then sure, you're facing a lot of trouble. I'd sure like to do the same, but at the same time I wonder if it'd actually be worth it, at our current technological level.<br>It's hard work getting up, it's hard work getting down, and you can't stay there for too long. (ignoring the financial aspect)<br>In that light, it might be more practical to emulate with VR + air cushion.</br></br></br>  <br>The current ISS astronauts are there for an entire year</br>  <br>It's not healthy even though they keep up a regular workout.</br>  <br> The american astronaut has a twin brother who is also an astronaut. They are going to compare him to his brother when they come back. He's 50 too</br>  How did we go from this...  I watched not too long ago and I was a bit disappointed after the years of people hyping it up. Still liked it, just expected more.  To this?  Probably the only hard sci-fi anime series ever.<br>Also very gud.</br>  <br>Yelling is the most popular form of communication : the show.</br>  <br>I've seen a few people mention this and I don't get it. They don't yell that often and it's always well justified.</br>  <br>the manga is arguably better</br>  <br>Only David's JoJo can top Planetes in the yelling department.</br>  <br>I don't like the way the manga handled Tanabe very much. I think it's the pacing, but the relationship just kind of happened like it was on a schedule. Jumping straight from 'here they are meeting for the first time' to 'LOOK HOW CRIPPLING THIS SEXUAL TENSION IS' didn't exactly sell it for me.</br>  Unpopular opinions time:<br><br>I liked the show. Liked most of the characters.<br><br>Hated the protagonist.<br><br>He was an arrogant, selfish, depressing arsehole, and he never grew up at all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unpopular opinion </br>  <br>because it ruined the show for me<br><br>most dont seem to think he was that bad</br></br></br>  <br> most dont seem to think he was that bad <br>Pretty sure half of Planetes fans got fed up with MC bullshit. I sure did.<br><br>Anime orignal Laurel and Hardy suck ass too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really think he should've fucking begged Tanabe for forgiveness. He was the cunt of cunts towards easily the best thing to ever happen to him. The shit she went through because of his (granted, space-PTSD invoked) callousness towards her was ludicrous. She loved him with a purity few will ever experience and it was more than likely her first time ever putting her heart out there like that.<br>Well, at least he improved.</br></br>  <br> Pretty sure half of Planetes fans got fed up with MC bullshit. I sure did. <br><br>Reckon? I don't see that in these threads. I often see people excusing his behaviour with muhspacePTSD and muhshittyexperiences.<br><br><br>Improved? Barely.<br><br>I think the whole thing was handled poorly by the show, and eventually by the characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You copy?  What did everyone think about this scene?   Re-watching a series you liked   <br>If you liked it the first time why not enjoy it again?</br>   rewatch series you hated <br> realize it's the best show ever made </br>  <br>I usually find I don't enjoy it as much on another re-watch, especially if it's a series that relies on twists.</br>   rewatch a show you really disliked five years ago because /a/ keeps jerking off to it <br> end up enjoying it a lot </br>  <br>If its twists are its only merit than it's shit.</br>  <br> I liked this sandwich <br> I want to eat this same exact sandwich at a later date  <br><br>understand? there's a world of things to eat out there, and little time to try as many as possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you're also that faggot who skips OP and EDs</br>   rewatch Watamote for the first time since it aired <br> hate it so much that I can barely make it through the first few episodes <br><br>Is this some kind of a trick?

It feels okay but the payoff isn't there.</br></br></br>  <br>It's always a good feeling to re-watch shit I liked years ago because of the garbage we get today</br>   Implying there's anything wrong with that. <br>Why else would they sell BDs, you fucking retard?</br>  <br>Not him, but I certainly usually haven't liked series any less the second time I read or watched them.

Same with vidya, I can rewatch the WC3 cinematics a thousand times and never get tired of them.   <br>I've rewatched that one like 4 times.</br>  <br> Watch Kill La Kill up till the final episode <br> drop it on the final episode <br><br>I do this with a lot of shows.  I did the same for Kaiji </br></br></br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>Fuck off.</br></br>   rewatch series more than I watch new series <br>I've rewatched Geass, Hataraku Maou-sama, Bebop, Eva, Oregairu, and Working 5+ times each, usually drunk, and at least a dozen others 2-4 times, also usually drunk. I find that you notice and appreciate the smaller details the more you rewatch something, in addition to looking forward to the great parts that you loved so much, whereas with a new series there might be a few or even several shit/boring parts, wondering if it's worth continuing. I have Macross 7 and Hyouka just kinda sitting there on my HDD.</br>  <br>Watch Hyouka you faggot, when you rewatch it, you will pick up on all kinds of details you missed the first watch.</br>  <br>working 3rd season soon <br><br>now you have to add 12 more episodes on your rewatch list</br></br></br>  <br>Re-watching Chobits 10 years later was brilliant. The soundtrack is catchy and the Madhouse did some solid animation. The story itself is alright bar some discrepancies between it and the manga.<br><br>Hideki is the dumbass self insert that somehow knew that little about persocoms.

They're pretty damn good.</br>  <br> watch anime for ~7 years <br> learn kana and make friends with some japs <br> watch nico streams for a few years <br> start a kanji deck in anki, give up after ~100 kanji <br> year later start a core6k deck <br> couple months into the core6k deck atm <br>Atleast I can chat with japs and watch anime raw I guess</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Started by watching namasensei for no other reason than because it was funny. But then little by little I realized I was learning something and enjoying the learning. So I started studying "for real". I read Tae Kim a few times, and did just 1000 words in SRS. But SRS was so boring that I stopped. Instead I continued to "An Integrated Approach to Intermediate Japanese" and worked through that book. <br><br>After this I started reading VNs. Or rather a single VN, Rewrite. I should probably have chosen something shorter because it took me over 14 months to read it, even though I read every single day. It because part of my life. Then I finally finished it. That's probably my biggest Japanese achievement so far. And it was amazing what progress I made during it, even though I used no other studying resources during it.<br><br>This was just a few months ago. Now I am reading another VN, G-線上の魔王 while studying grammar on the side by watching nihongo no mori on youtube and other miscellaneous stuff. I am far from fluent, probably N2 level, but I have come so far that I am sure I will get there eventually. Quitting never crosses my mind because studying is simply fun. It's just a matter of time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>- Started with Kana, learned to read and write in two weeks. Spend the next two months writing people's names and shit.<br>- Rosetta Stone for a month. Learned shit like "kuruma", "hikouki", "hito" in Romaji.<br>- Spend about four months with a common phrases book and read it twice.<br>- Did RTK thrice. First time, I reached about 400 Kanji. Second time about 1000. Third time to completion of the first book. A year of this. Physical flashcards in the first try.<br>- After finishing RTK, I tried "reading" Tomoyo After by getting the overall meaning without knowing vocab, grammar or readings. Totally deluded that I was understanding it.<br>- Dropped the language twice out of frustation from the above.<br><br>That was before I discovered DJT and after seeing the no-bullshit-allowed philosophy and the guide, I decided to give it another shot. Two years later, I'm about N2 level.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> derp 1 month with kana <br> study with rosetta stone <br> spend a whole year on rtk <br>Rough dude. Did you do RTK correctly at least? I mean, if you did at least you know how to write now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Enrolled in first year Japanese at my university <br> Spent a year not learning shit (unless you count kana and 100 or so kanji something) <br> Didn't even know of Anki, DOJG or Tae Kim back then <br> Started Anki over the summer since I planned on taking second year Japanese (despite heavily sucking at it) <br> Got to 700 words &amp; quit <br> Resumed second year Japanese <br> Didn't really do much and only learned some basic grammar concepts like のに <br> Eventually passed the course decently since I had a better feel for studying Japanese. During the course, I started using Anki again since we had to learn about 500 kanji for the second course and I needed a way to memorize words <br> Resumed Anki full time with Core 6k optimized over the summer. I'm now around 3600 words | 1300 kanji in <br> About to finish my first VN &amp; starting other VNs right now <br><br>I've been practically wasting all my time in those 2 years except for the 3-4 months up until now, where I jumped from 100 kanji to 1300.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Started with Namasensei and a notebook<br>Quit<br>Used memrise, and realized that it was rote I hated.<br>Moved onto Anki RTK + Vocab<br>Figured that RTK was retarded after a month, and switched to straight Kanji + vocab<br>Figured learning kanji period was retarded after about a year and 1.?k mature and only had vocab<br>After about 2 years, and 6 thousand or so mature vocab cards, I figured Anki was retarded, and focused on reading to pick up the rest.<br><br>I never did pick up the rest(at least not to satisfaction), and while I can read LN's I couldn't go a page through DanMachi without using KanjiTomo at least once. Looking back, I only see the insidious death of my willpower/motivation. And while I read Japanese nearly everyday, I can't help but to wonder if this was all just effort that might have been better spent elsewhere.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sounds like you need to do both Anki and some formal study to feel in the cracks of reading. Reading alone will get you there eventually (in 5-10 years) but the process can be much faster.</br>  <br>Last time I did it, I did it quick as in I wanted to finish the damn thing and move on to something else. The radical and meaning knowledge stayed with me but I can now only write about 500-800 Kanji if I make the effort.</br>  I'm having a hard time finding an English source to tell me the difference between 行き　(ゆき / いき)    <br>ゆき is mostly only for songs and as a suffix. It's いき in most cases.</br>  <br>So I can primary disregard ゆき until I'm further along?</br>  <br> passed N2 with a good score after 3 years and 8 months of studying <br> while completing a BSc. Computer Science at the same time <br> can read most things I've wanted to read, given time <br> N1 preparation is going well, consistently getting 85%+ good answers on Kanzen Master <br> learning new words/idioms is easier than ever <br>Learning Japanese really made me into a happier person, I'll never regret putting time into learning this language. So much entertainment accessible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, like I said it's common enough as a suffix (e.g., 東京行き) and you should know that it exists, as it's fairly common. But it's not really worth worrying about, since most of the time it's going to be いき.</br>  I fucked up, I might be entering the normal sleep schedule again.

Reading it through seems really unnecessary to me.</br>  <br>Sort of wondering this too. Almost done with TK and not sure what is the best method to go about learning grammar from the DoJG that's not covered by Tae Kim aside from reading and looking up stuff. Maybe the DoJG cloze/abridged deck and use the reference to find the pages of each card I'm not 100% confident with and read through those?<br><br>I plan to mostly read of course; it'd just be something to do on the side for maybe an hour or so a day to solidify grammar that's a bit uncommon or hazy for me.</br></br></br>  I took my time working through core2k and TK over the last few months and I feel very comfortable with the grammar now. I know it is only a minute accomplishment, but I was happy to get all the non-listening N5 example questions correct today. Thank you for the help I needed to get going DJT! Now to seriously begin reading...  <br> college is way more time consuming than a job <br>Confirmed NEET</br></br>  How's 殻ノ少女 &amp; 嘘ノ少女's difficulty like? If anybody's tried either VNs.  <br>This might be an idea anyway, good luck and never give up.</br>  <br>Honestly, no grammar book is going to prepare you for reading, even the stuff in graded readers is way harder than the example sentences in grammar textbooks. Just start reading and use DOJG as reference books.</br>  Is it better to learn vocab with the Core deck or just add shit to Anki while playing VNs?  Hi there, Steve Kaufmann here. Today, I'm going to make what I consider to be one of my most important videos for language-learners. I'm going to talk about what I consider to be the BIGGEST MISTAKE that most language learners make. This is the biggest mistake, the biggest obstacle, the biggest hurdle, the biggest /thing/ that prevents people from succeeding and becoming fluent -- whatever that means.<br><br>And that mistake is that people stay with the BEGINNER material for too long. They stay with the beginner book, They stay with the beginner course, the beginner lesson, they never get beyond it. And it's quite unnecessary. If you buy a beginner book, which I think is a good thing to do if you embark on learning a new language, that beginner book? You can use it for a year -- but you keep on going back to it. You don't try to master it. You don't try to learn it, understand it, you don't have to learn or remember the dialogue, the vocabulary, the grammar rules, nothing! It's just a bit of initial guide, something that you go back to regularly. As soon as possible, you have to get away from the artificial environment of the beginner course, the beginner textbook, or whatever the teacher has you doing in class, you have go get beyond that.<br><br>You have to get into real language. Now, if I look at my own experience wich Czech, uhm, y'know I started I kept track of it, I started July the 23rd, and I was looking at it today and on August the 4th I started bringing in, uh, using LinQ's quick, yknow, bookmark, that quick import system, bringing in articles from Czech newspapers. That's uh, y'know, whatever it was two weeks after I started. Fighting way my way through these, of course, clicking on every word, saving the word to my database, reviewing them, not really understanding it, ah, kinda picking my way through maybe 30-40%? Most unclear instructor &lt;unintelligible&gt;, I kept on doing it!<br><br>&lt;cont&gt;</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think it would be interesting to plot over time the number of "is it better to learn by x or y"/"should I use x to learn"/"how good is x for learning" type questions vs actual questions about the language. I wonder if it fluctuates much. I feel like we get fewer actual language questions these days, but I'm really not sure.  <br>You know what fuck this it's going to be like five posts:<br>http://pastebin.com/x0pejxwa<br>Someone can edit this if they want. I just wanted to transcribe it.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it me or he is always saying that he is going back to a language or brushing up on one without ever really understanding it.</br>  <br>Yea thats probably what i am going to do.<br>But how can i make sure i translated / understood something correct without having a good english translation for it,thats something im worried about</br></br>  <br><br>He's right about classroom language learning being a joke, but I don't understand why people here think the learning strategies of an autistic savant are useful for normal people.</br></br>  <br>Autists have funny strategies because they're shit at learning. An autist's strategy will work for anyone. That only difference is that it's easier for them to continue doing things that they come up with on their own. Note: Generalizing autism here, this shit doesn't apply to &gt;130 HFAs.</br>  <br>This paranoia will kill you. A translation to check will help you, but it can also make it more difficult to understand Japanese on its own. <br><br>I mean, think about your native language. You or someone you know have probably had misunderstandings about words and what they mean, right? That's just a natural thing. If it's common enough, eventually you'll realize the problem and correct your understanding. In general, if you read a lot, your overall comprehension will move more and more to a correct one. <br><br>For the record, I'm not saying that you should never look up translations or something. If something doesn't make sense or you're confused about a meaning, look it up or ask someone (or move on if you think it's not important). But don't think that reading without an English translation to check will somehow teach you incorrect Japanese in the long run.</br></br></br></br></br>  頭をさすりながら、何事かと辺りを見回している。<br><br>What is this かと?</br></br>  <br>と functions in a sort of adverbial function here, describing how something happened. 何事 is like "something" or "some event", and か shows uncertainty.
