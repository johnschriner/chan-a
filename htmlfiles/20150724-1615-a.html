[ Gotta finish taking care of some stuff, so I'm gonna have to push this back an hour to 10pm CDT, so hang tight. Talk amongst yourselves, etc.  THE TIME HAS COME AND SO HAVE I  <br>Or rather, will come. In an hour.</br>  nice  I'm glad I made time for this today.  <br>So on time today!</br>  Would you believe I just thought to myself "I really should check to see if the liveTL is up yet" and at the top of page 1 here it was.    8th for Poseidon.<br>My body is prepared.</br>  Twinkle, twinkle, little star,<br>Ready for some NTR?</br>  <br>FUCK YEAR<br><br>I'm on time this time!</br></br></br>  <br>More than just ready, Anon.</br>  Its Time.  <br>Just for that.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QLb<wbr>CedNKuxY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>    <br> Ready for some NTR? <br><br>Ready for  the twenty-four-hour store .</br></br></br>  <br>I don't get what Caillou has to do with NTR.</br>  <br>Ready for  You to kill yourself holy shit I hate this fucking NTR fetish meme that has taken over this fucking website. This is worst shit that 4chan has seen in ages </br>  <br>Damn, son, did you get cucked or something? <br>Actually there's no way that could happen, so I'm guessing you're just pissed about other anons fapping to your shitty husbando huh?</br></br>  <br>But anon-kun, I was shitposting  ironically :^) </br>  <br><br>You know I am. It's almost  like I wish we'd go back to calling each other faggots like civilized people. Nowadays you go to any other board and it's "cuck cuck cuck" </br></br>  <br> No. But I respect the scat fetish shitters more than cuck faggots. </br>  <br> That's saying quite a lot. I don't really have a reply to that. </br>  <br>It was an attempt to bring sonic terrors into anon's reality.</br>  <br>What if I read NTR because I like Netori and fags on Sadpanda can't properly tag so I suffer through netorare to get to the netori.</br>  <br>Caillou has everything to do with NTR.</br>  What are we going to do for an hour, boku gang?  <br>Mope and wait for the return of Aereus "Seven Minutes in Heaven at the 7/11" to translate for us. <br><br>Aereus, what does it feel like to be a meme?</br></br></br>  <br>Is NTR a meme now ?</br>  <br>Closer to half an hour now, I've just been quasi-ironically shitposting. <br><br>You could post lewd tho</br></br></br>  <br>if you don't think this is the cutest moment in the manga you are lying to yourself<br><br>  hottest was when she slammed her phat ass on his dick </br></br></br>  <br> See the problem is that cuck fags are the new pony shitters. They literally inject their fetish into everything. This might literally not be a thread in the last year or so that hasn't had some faggot spouting cuck, ironically or unironically. it was funny when it was about moot, but now the actual fetish faggots are out in full force and you cannot tell who's shitposting anylonger <br><br><br>Then I feel sorry for you.<br><br><br>Yes. Refer to: Moot's departure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    You guys are going to  love  this chapter.  <br>I hate the "cucks" shit, it's fucking everywhere and also people who say "kek". It's so stupid and I don't find any of it funny. I have a friend who says kek out loud all the fucking time, I physically cringe a lot.</br>   I agree cuckposting was funny when it was about the space cuck meme maker former ceo of troll inc. but now the real NTRfags think they are in good company.   <br> Growing up isn't so tough <br> Except when I've had enough </br></br>  <br><br>Pretend to be KoG, apparently.</br></br>  Why cant i find any recent chapters anywhere?  <br>You need to look in the archive for the threads.</br>  Relevant.  <br>Why is Loki so fucking ugly.</br>  <br> トップケク </br>  To tide you over as I finish up~  <br>Love me some Eroe</br>        Wait, Chapter 70 is already out?  <br>Chapter 72 is out ain't it ?</br>  <br>Yeah it was done on Monday.</br>  <br>What about the text below "kiss"?</br>  <br>Well shit</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the point of it was that it's a better raw + cleaned<br><br><br>Aereus said on his site that it was absent from the latest issue of YJ</br></br></br></br>  <br> Aereus <br>Could you regularly release chapters? Pretty please.</br></br>  <br>I already translated that in last week's liveTL...</br>  <br>That may be a possibility. Typesetter and/or cleaner would help immensely tho that aren't shit.</br>  <br>Well shit, I thought that was the #71 cover.</br>  <br>How do I prove I'm not shit, if I wanted to help?</br>  Aww shit, I made it.  <br><br>Not sure how I'd feel about volunteering for that. Bokunomanga is still going, right?</br></br>  <br>Try typesetting/cleaning something and showing it to them.</br>    So exactly how far is the manga translated right now? In the treads I see people posting that it's at chapter 70 or something but all of the chapters that I can find are only up to chapter 56.  <br>Those are the fully scanned and cleaned chapters.<br><br>The Aereus threads are where you see they are.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Dwb<wbr>wvJOx4fw</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>No those are only up to 51, the one up to 56 are the shit ones that caused all that drama a while back, I think.</br>  <br>Live translations are at 71 "now", the actual releases are lagging behind.</br>  <br><br>Ok thanks, I just found the archives.</br></br>  Quick what video player do you use?<br>Windows Classic keeps crashing on me and fuckk vlc.</br>  softnes when?

Wow! That be expensive yo.</br></br>  will there ever be a bigger BTFO in Aikatsu?  <br>Don't you get it anon? Mizuki was only pretending she wanted to win! It's all part of the master keikaku.</br>  <br>Imagine the despair she must have felt  when it was all for nothing since Ichigo still didn't take Mizuki down from the top spot in the Rankings. It took another three months before she was finally free from that weight. </br>  <br>but how do you explain this face?</br>  <br>Diamond Happy&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Shining Line&gt;DuDuWaDoit&gt;Kira Powa&gt;Signalize<br>I'm still at DuDuWaDoit.</br></br>  No, it's perfect.  <br>JUST DU-DU-WA DO IT!!</br>  I want to fuck Lala.    <br>Actually not that bad.<br><br>It will look terrible though, I'm sure.</br></br></br>  Aroma nendo when?  <br>Probably before a kyupikon nendo</br>  <br> DVD <br>I missed that. A ripoff.</br></br>  <br>Worse than the existing DVDs is still pretty good.</br>  <br>Why are they sitting like that?</br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>Me too dude.</br>        This episode was intensely weird. Along with the fever dream episode.  <br>Kira Power &gt; Diamond Happy &gt; Shining Line &gt; Lovely Party Collection &gt; Signalize &gt; Du-Du Wa Do it<br><br>They're all pretty close though.</br></br></br>  I want to adventure with Peridot  <br>Diamond Happy = Shining Line &gt; all the others &gt; Du-du-wa Do It<br>I don't really even remember the first S2 opening that much. I remember being angry that Diamond Happy got replaced, then angry again at not liking S2 and started to skip the OP. It's the only /ai/ opening I've ever skipped. I'd probably like it now if I went back and listened to it.</br></br>  Not me. I like Kokone but<br> I want Yuu back </br>  And before I was able to pretty much start this episode, I creamed my everything.  I've been listening to Love Like Caramelize nonstop for the last few days. I think it's my favourite song this season.<br><br>Granted, that isn't much of an achievement - the songs this season aren't very good.</br></br>    They aren't sad for Yuu when she leaves though.  So fluffy.  <br>That's because Yuu is coming back.</br>  <br> the songs this season aren't very good. <br>Lovely Bomb, Chica x Chica, Passion Flower (sensing a pattern here) and My Show Time are great.</br></br>  It doesn't get better than this. <br><br><br>Those are alright but I don't think they compare to the better S1 or S2 songs. Also you forgot Light Pink Day Tripper.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's Aikatsu was also this season.</br>  There's a real problem with this episode that stopped me from properly enjoying it - where was Miyabi?<br><br>She was there last week. She's Kokone's partner in idlehood. The least she could do is turn up to her leaving party and see her off.</br></br>  The new Pucchigumi magazine came with a DVD that has some Aikatsu and Pripara CG performances. It also has a segment about Konami's otoca game. Here it is if anyone's interested.<br><br>http://amatsuka.com/anime/Pucchigum<wbr>i 2015-08 DVD - Performances.mkv<br><br>or<br><br>/msg Mao xdcc send #1523</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>I certainly did. Maybe I wouldn't have if it WAS ON THE FUCKING ALBUM<br><br>At least it's coming soon.</br></br></br>  <br> rainbows <br><br>Well at least it isn't more wings.</br></br></br>    <br>Someone photoshop Bane's mask onto them</br>    The whole full body pan shiny effect seems a little unnecessary when they're just in their normal clothes with backpacks.  <br>Must brush.</br>  <br>That doesn't look like a gentle slope at all.</br>  <br> no tagline <br> no pastebin <br>You are shameful /ai/<br>the guide:<br>http://pastebin.com/iDebHQu6</br></br></br></br></br>  But really: where was Miyabi? Did she leave between episodes?  <br>The staff remembered she wasn't supposed to be there.</br>  <br>Staff should also remember, that Yuu is Akari's precious friend.</br>  Please post cute Momona faces. I didn't cap any from episodes before 26 because I was watching mp4s I'd download for bandwidth and time saving reasons that turned out to be watermarked.  She sure does.  <br>Those high waisted shorts look amazing on her.</br>  <br>If you really ask exclusively about cuteness, then yes, a bunch I guess, like Otome, Madoka, Ichigo, Akari and so on.<br>Not sure if there are any better than her though, guess that is pretty subjective.</br></br>  <br>Normally, I really dislike them, but I have to agree with you here.</br>      <br>Gao gao~</br>  <br>I was at work all day. I'm sorry.</br>  <br>Really based episode director, everything was just so lewd.</br>  <br>What are they saying?</br>  <br>Why does she sit like that</br>  <br>Maybe her ass hurts.</br>  <br>Unfortunately this episode looked really bad. I wish the 2d art had as much attention paid to it as the CG.</br>  <br>It had some problems, but at least it was pretty lewd to make up for quality a bit.</br>      <br><br>Can boys be idles?</br></br>   [Paca] Jewelpet Sunshine - 20 [A0A8C25E].mkv <br><br>I think it's about time I watched the first eps of Sunshine again so I can keep up with this as it's released</br></br>    <br/>  <br>Not anymore.</br>  Bring Hiro back.  <br><br>He's gone anon<br><br>They all are.....</br></br></br></br>    I miss Otome. Why can't there be a show where she voices every character?  <br>There are no heroes left in man.</br>  <br>Why</br>  <br><br>Because Pretty Rhythm is dead.</br></br>  <br><br>Miyabi was only supposed to be there for the Unit Cup, but overstayed her welcome one extra episode for the wedding.</br></br>  <br>Just look at these legs. Goddamn.</br>  <br> overstayed her welcome <br>Not possible. I want her to stay forever.</br></br>  <br>Whose are the best?</br>    It's weird how Kanon had only heard of Mizuki, but didn't really know about her. She's the top of idle, queen of the world of entertainment. Kanon should know better.  One day, Mion-sama will return!  <br>She's too hipster for idols. There are probably other sources of musical inspiration anyway.</br>  <br>Miyabi is a guest, Kokone is a guest, Yuu actually belongs there.<br>I want Yuu back!</br></br>  <br>Once PP kills Aikatsu PR can come back.</br>  <br>Since you asked so nicely<br> Yuu back </br></br>  <br>Good luck with that.</br>  <br>Yuu is sort of dull and underdeveloped. I guess some focus on her would help that, but it'll never happen.</br>  <br>Ganbare!</br>  <br>She is not dull, you worm! And she can hardly get any development, when anime staff is actively taking the screentime from her.</br>    <br><br>They should have made a unit with Miyabi, Kokone, and Yuu.</br></br>  Well this was pretty damned goofy.  <br>It's the best episode, actually.</br>  <br>Drama episodes are normally goofy, but great.</br>  <br> Donuts </br>  <br>Such a qt</br>  <br>Please go away again.</br>  <br>Miyabi didn't even get to say goodbye before going.</br>      <br>look how short that skirt is</br>  <br>It's a 404</br>  <br>copy the link and paste in your address bar instead of clicking it<br><br>"http://amatsuka.com/anime/Pucchigu<wbr>mi 2015-08 DVD - Performances.mkv"</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Why replace what killed Aikatsu by what was killed by Aikatsu?<br><br>They'll just keep milking PP.</br></br></br>  <br> not making both <br>PP probably draws enough cash to do it.</br></br>  <br>But why invest in more PR when they can make another money island, to store future PP money.</br>  how come aikatsu never gets goodies like this  <br>Because they can.<br>That's how Tinkle got an OVA.</br></br>    <br>It's alive  in my heart. </br>  <br>I want to marry Mia</br>    <br>Thanks</br>  I guess it's Twinkle Akari's birthday today.  why is this allowed?  <br>Keep your mouth closed, Lala!</br>  <br> I miss Otome <br>Wanted to say this.

Is Yuu the new Shion?    <br>Yuu is new Hikari</br>  <br>Yes, but she's the butt of more jokes now.</br>  <br>Shion at least had episodes about her.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Shion is more butt than Yuu.</br>  <br><br>You sure have your mind set on butts.</br></br>  <br>I don't have enough Yuu butt.</br>      <br>RIP</br>    Something seems kind of weird about teaching children about "adult dates" that end with a "private party" in the bedroom but okay  <br>You've already seen how young they get married.</br>  <br>At first I read "An adult male might be nice".</br>  Bell is so cool!  <br>Naru a cute!<br>A cute!</br></br>  <br>If you say so.</br>    <br>Are those real? And speaking of those bottles, I've never even seen one before.</br>    <br>The director said on Twitter they had them in a meeting.</br>    :(  Not long until I'm done with the first season, what ever that means.<br><br>I hope there aren't 50 episodes of boring characters until I get to the sex goddesses from recent doujins.</br></br>  <br> I hope there aren't 50 episodes of boring characters <br>Who is going to tell it?</br></br>  <br>The second half of S2 is actually good though. The first half is disappointing for plot-related reasons, but still alright.</br>  <br>You know, birthrates. Sanrio is doing its part to save GLORIOUS NIHON</br>  <br>Don't tell him, maybe without the peer pressure he might be able to enjoy it.</br>  <br> Oozora Weather <br><br>If Akari gets into the Aikatsu 8 she won't do Oozora weather for several weeks will she?</br></br></br>  <br>She will keep doing it in my heart.</br>  <br>Do you even idols? She'll have to make time for it somehow.</br>    <br>The TV station will invest cash in sending a Camera crew and the Ozorotter guy, who probably has a family, out on a nationwide tour with her? Sounds ridiculously expensive.</br>  <br>It's really not that bad when you don't have to wait a week for an episode. Also, the DreAcas are cute.</br>  <br>They're cute in retrospect, but they were treated poorly. If they were all in Starlight everyone would love them.</br>  <br> And if Maria got ANY screen time at all, and if she didn't have the girl she replaced get her dress. </br>  <br> everyone would love them. <br>Not me, I didn't like them, sure, Sora had good moments and a song but that's it.</br></br>  <br>Sora is a mean girlfriend stealer.</br>  <br>Shut-up Yurika and eat your garlic hamburger filled with freedom.</br>  <br>I want to see someone else wearing Bohemian Sky.

I dont even hate Seira this time I just find it boring.</br>  <br>I never really minded all the ties and stuff, I remember I was always defending the show back then, but Aikatsu8 was just terrible.</br>  <br>I'd fuck you, anon.</br>  <br> Not as good as Mikan. <br>I want to pull her ponytail.

I've been off from requesting for like 3 weeks now, but I think I'll come back this weekend maybe. I just don't want to be greedy. If I get things I feel like I shouldn't ask for too much more so others will have a better chance too. I just want us all to be a little happier.

A lot of these anons have waifus from more obscure series that don't get to see new images of her just by checking a few pixiv artists' pages.

The little girl reminds me of when E.T was wearing that sweater.</br>  <br>No, I think it's rude to just give advice when no one is asking for it.

Since they haven't fixed it you need to say why it's shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  /r/ing girls in gags, please  <br>I tried. Hope this is fine?</br>  <br>New colorfag here. How do you choose your colors so that they fit with each other when you're shading?</br>  <br>Is 4chin kinda broken to anyone else? some images won't load</br>  <br>Do you really think they fit or are you being sarcastic? (It's too late, I can't tell)<br>Anyway, I can't really explain how, like I don't really have a specific method.I just randomly throw them together until I think it looks ok. <br>I do color on one layer most of the time, if that helps?</br></br></br>  Question for drawfags. Does someone not rerequesting after you said it's okay to rerequest make you feel good? Or do you feel indifferent to it.  <br>It at least makes me feel better than when someone rerequests but it could have several reasons other than OP being satisfied with your drawing so I guess it's nothing to be happy about.</br>  <br>That forest is absolutely beautiful  I really like the addition of the deer . Thanks a ton</br>  <br>I was being serious. I asked because I really like the way you painted the skin for the person and the shark, even though it's got a blue here and a purple there, it all seems to fit together. I was kind of curious as to how that works together, because it looks really good.</br>  <br>It's never happened. Because I'm better than average, for one, and second because anyone who ever actually rerequests gets anally raped by other requesters.<br><br>Because I generally put effort into my deliveries I would be annoyed if it did happen, because the only reason I could imagine for someone to do it is to purposefully offend me.<br><br>If I was terrible I'd be a little sad but not offended.</br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting this scene with Mimibro-tan and Mimi.<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/K8NW9qT.jpg<br><br>http://i.imgur.com/HfaN4FO.jpg</br></br></br></br>  <br>those are some good colors</br>  <br>Thanks a bunch then. <br>It's blue-ish at some parts because I color in the whole artwork with a color like blue and purple first, lock it and then just use a brush that smudges the colors well to color and shade. It's easier to keep it all in the same color spectrum this way, which automatically makes drawings look more harmonic altogether.<br>Link related: http://livepaintinglessons.com/gamu<wbr>tmask.php</wbr></br></br></br>  Give advice and/or tell me that i'm shit<br><br><br>got a tumblr/DA?<br>it's to give you credit <br><br><br> Happy Hanukkah </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that his mom?</br>  <br>Do you feel the same when it's an open request?</br>  <br><br>Delivered.<br>I've been working on this during my breaks, I hope you like it.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's his girlfriend.</br>  <br>Looks pretty good for just flatcolor. Is it going to stay like this or are you gonna add more shadow/lightning?</br>    <br>That is meaty.<br><br>Hope this means we get some chubby lolis later.</br></br></br>  <br>Noice. Not a fan of the fingernails though.</br>  <br>It's absolutely stunning anon, those feathers are just magnificent to look at too.<br><br>Thank you so much</br></br></br>  <br>Noooooooooooo.</br>  <br>Thanks!<br><br><br>The feathers are just a brush with some overlay effects tho... But I'm happy you like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really timid with the lighting. If you're going for rim lighting at least up the contrast. Also make it bigger.</br>  <br>Not sure what you mean by "open".<br><br>Like, "draw your own interpretation of X"?<br><br>Nah, I wouldn't care. More people who do that, the less of a faggot I feel like for trying it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks a lot, anon. I still don't really get it, but I'll look around and see if I can find anything besides that link. <br>I've just been coloring in base colors and then gradually darkening the shade like a gradient.</br></br>  <br>In general, a child's body isn't that different from an adult's, especially in anime. Heads are generally bigger, and they don't have developed shoulders and waists yet, but the other proportions are about the same.<br>In your drawing, her head's not actually connected to her spine. Her arm and leg bones are inconsistent in length, causing her to look lanky also.<br>I hope this helps.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks m8!</br>    There's nothing wrong with girls being big and soft!  <br>I hope you choke and die on a double dipped corndog ycake.</br>  <br>Is there a way to rotate the shape?<br><br><br>It is going to stay like that unfortunately. I just wanted to get something done for the day.<br><br><br>It was not meant to be rim light. But I can see why you thought that.<br> Also make it bigger <br>I was messing around on the size but it felt like I was making it too large and I was not digging it. <br>Also thanks for the advice!<br><br>Anyone know a program, or website, or something that can let me mess with light interacting on random objects?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> not liking health </br></br>  <br>You're just as bad as footfags.</br>  <br>I'm sorry... I'm really bad at explaining stuff, especially since English isn't my mother tongue.<br><br>I'm not sure if I understood you correctly, but personally, I don't think shading with only a darker version of the base color doesn't look too good in most cases. If you look at the shadows on your skin in real life, you can see it's more like the base color mixed with nuances of gray, blue and purple (more or less depending on the lightning source)<br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br>  <br>T-thanks?<br><br><br> Hope this means we get some chubby lolis later. <br>Still working on Bunny, im very slow since im multi-tasking.

Otherwise I don't know what you mean. <br><br>It's alright. I like flatcolors, I like the simplicity.<br><br>(I'm both <br>and  by the way, in case I got you confused)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It was not meant to be rim light <br>No that is rim lighting.</br></br>  <br> is something that I've colored before, for an example of what I was talking about. <br><br>In your image, did you achieve the results on the right by using the shading colors on a multiply layer? I just wasn't sure what you meant right at the end of the image. Also, how would you deal with a gradual darkening when shading?

Together, solo/staight, or like /u/ whatever is okay.  <br>The shading in the example pic isn't half bad, though I personally don't like when people shade white skin like that (looks a little like sunburn to me)<br><br>Yeah I did that with multiply. I usually shade on the same layer as the base color (pic related) but before you do that, using multiply and the same shading color for every area of the drawing helps you get a much better feeling for colors.<br><br> Also, how would you deal with a gradual darkening when shading? Use darker versions of the shading colors and blending, or just another color altogether? <br><br>I'd do the former to be honest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting pic related with a healthy patchouli knowledge, she's so fat she can't be loved.  <br>It's a good thing the threads are separate, you think the regular drawthreads are bad?

An anon before told me to not be afraid of using dark colors, and the skin, hair, and scales were all in the reddish orangish region, so I thought that the shading might look good if it were a bit orange. I actually also shade on the same layer as the base, since I find it makes blending the shade with the skin look more gradual rather than having defined spots of starting and stopping. <br><br>Anyway, thanks a lot for you help, anon. I'll be sure to try this way out the next time I'm coloring.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that Muse?</br>  <br>Those weekend threads are very angry. Its like 90% shit posting. I like these threads.

Too unnatural.</br>  <br><br>Yeah man your stuff is awesome, but sometimes you need to get more accurate breast sizes.</br></br>  <br>Boa can you please draw !</br>  <br>not that guy but he probably means that you change crosshatching patterns between values somewhat randomly, like the leg or the lower part of the hair.<br>I guess it's about consistency but you are on a good path.</br></br>   128353704   <br/>  <br>Hope you like it!</br>  <br><br>This is really nice! Thank you very much anon! Her pose is very dynamic and full of energy, her outfit suits her very well too! If I had one minor notice it is her smaller breasts.</br></br>  <br>So cute!</br>  <br>Post it.</br>  <br>Adorable. thanks.</br>  <br>Thanks so much!</br>  Requesting porn of Capitan Ginyu in Bulma's body  <br>No problem, she was fun!</br>  Requesting the Yuru Yuris in the club, celebrating Akari's birthday like 50 Cent and his crew in the song "In Da Club" .  <br>Das cute. Thank you for taking the time to draw her!</br>  <br><br>Good eyebrows<br>Good face</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's something I've been struggling for quite some time now since I don't really know what'd be a good way to do it. I feel like it's fine when I just set one flat tone or just take my time to build up the tones smoothly, but I feel like there's a more efficient way out there I haven't tried out yet. I also think I botch the hair's volume whenever I try getting clever or lazy.<br><br><br><br>noted<br><br><br>weekend<br><br><br>I guess I'm just being lazy. It does take a lot of time to make it consistent.<br><br>I was thinking he meant rendering the tones in a way that responds to the volume or texture (curved lines on a roundish shape, for example) but I dunno.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No problem at all, thanks for helping me practice!</br>  <br>Have you tried hatching hair purely along the grain? Using line thickness and density to bring out highlights and shadows?</br>  <br>I WANT TO FUCK REMILIA!</br>  <br> Most anons would be happy with getting a delivery with nice boobs </br>  <br><br>The way you cross-hatch is odd</br></br>  <br>So tumblr</br>  <br>you actually did it<br><br>i hate you</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks man, you made my day! Thank you for the work!</br>  <br>I can't say I've tried it enough since it takes eons and gets discouraging after a while. If you have any good examples that'd be very helpful though</br>  <br><br>I apologize for being vague. I was pretty sure you were just being lazy about it and knew what I meant (which you did) so I didn't provide detail. I was basically talking about the flow/direction of hatches that give volume/shape.<br><br>Here's some quick doodles, note that I haven't hatched for so long that these are pretty awful examples to follow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>(Also I would never hatch leather/cloth like that, the length and direction changes depending on material. Didn't even cover that)</br>  <br>Go to /co/, fag and stop vulturing.</br>    <br><br> using curved lines </br></br>  <br>you could separate those curves like the circle, like I said, pretty quick and shitty.</br>  <br>nah it's cool; that's pretty clear. I'll keep that closely in mind for the next delivery.<br><br><br>She was so cute I was surprised I hadn't drawn her before</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't, nor am I very good with hatching myself. <br>I have seen it before though.</br></br>  <br>It's okay, I'm going through a book about rendering in pen and ink right now, so I might figure something out soon enough.</br>  <br>Pretty cute.</br>    <br>Requesting a cute girl giving one of Sams characteristic cheesy grins.</br>  <br>Not sure if there are multiple drawfriends here, but nice work on the GTO request!<br><br>One thing I noticed is that you even did the "power bulge" bodywork over the wheels. Nicely done. Another thing I like is, without the color you can't tell whether the bumper is the Endura rubber one or the "Endura Delete" chrome/metal option. Just in case you didn't catch it earlier, thanks for doing the request. I really appreciate it.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you it's pretty cute</br>  <br>No problem! Thanks!</br>  <br>Sorry if you got offended by the pic posted i have no idea how it got there</br>  <br>Draw my left fagott p-please</br>  Continuing in a multistream with the coloring of tamamo while listening to a podcast about fucked up stuff on the internet.

Cool I will keep in mind the chrome detailing.</br>  <br>I'm heading to bed now, but if this thread is still up tomorrow I'd be more than happy to draw her for you, anon. If it's not, repost her in the next thread and I'll find her!</br>  Post transformations.    <br>That transformation felt way less badass than it should have been, probably because it was a rushed bullshit ending when Psyren was still ,basically, in it's infancy.</br>  H E<br>E</br>  <br>I still don't understand why this wasn't popular.</br>  <br>That's pretty fucking cool, OP.</br>    <br>Man, I remember having to do a double take when Ageha text changes cuz he lost his shit.<br>Chapter was so FUCKING satisfying.</br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah Psyren.</br>  <br>Because it was the bastard child between Gantz and Bleach.</br>    <br>It then deviated from 'Gantz for kids' to some random bullshit storyline about the future which caused Psyren's popularity to tank and ultimately get cancelled.</br>    <br>The best transformation scene for me will always be Wargreymon's shinka.<br><br>It has better computer animation than most modern anime.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do future arcs always have to suck? Reborn suffered heavily after it.</br>    <br>For appreciation.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FQU<wbr>cJMQX1RM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>I dropped Reborn when that faggot who was connected with the multiverse appeared.</br>  New one tomorrow.  <br>I'm not even angry, just sad at the potential that was lost. Psyren's MC's friends barely got developed and had to be hastily reintroduced (From fucking purgatory or something because they were barely in the manga even though they were the 'supporting' characters.) for the rushed final arc. <br><br>The Manga barely got started and the author had to fuck it up by trying to be clever, wasn't the story that the gantz wasteland they went was earth future or something? Fucking trash-tier plot.</br></br></br>  <br>This looks like something out of a PS2 game dude</br>  <br>It was made in 1999 using a kid's show budget. It's low poly, but the quality of the entire thing is pretty impressive.<br><br>There's the entire composition aspect, too. The music, the battles themselves, the effects. It's not just cool, it's motherfucking Wargraymon.</br></br></br>   You will never transform into a magical shota god     <br>shit, what is this from again?

The penultimate power up had Hendricksen completely silently wrecking shit left and right. Then he powers up again and suddenly starts shit talking (and subsequently losing his composure completely).

She wants her husbando to suffer.  She wants him to win tho.  <br> she keeps getting her hopes up for Souma getting expelled and then he survives <br>Not in the last few chapters though, she mellowed out quite a bit, even asking him on how he plans to beat Kuga if I remember right</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure she's only just getting to the point of sexual awareness period, let alone being attracted to any one male in particular. It will be a while before she develops and then acknowledges feelings for him. At best, she just sees him as an increasingly threatening rival.</br>  Chink scans never.  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-23/food-wars-shokugeki-no<wbr>-soma-gets-original-event-anime/.90<wbr>807</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>She asked him that several chapter ago yes. More startlingly, like 2 chapters ago, she told him to stop worrying about other areas and focus on beating Kuga.</br>  <br>Is it just me or has Tosh made several characters' flair kind of fluctuate over the months since the anime started? Like here Souma looks pretty boyish, but when he had the full page when he arrived back at the PSD after the stagiaire arc, he looked absolutely manly. Both styles are good I suppose, but there seems to me to be less consistency.</br>  How does Erinas butthole smell like  <br>Alice's farts probably smell gastronmically balanced and delicious</br>  <br>What does "original event anime mean?" An original short? An OVA?</br>  <br>Man she's in for a ride once she finds out about his dad</br>  <br>It means an SnS themed event in real life during WSJ's tour thingy. Could be an interview with the cast, could be a special screening, could be CD giveaways, who fucking knows.</br>  <br>I feel it's more about what he wants to convey each time, and that's fine for me.</br>  <br>I think that's what he's doing too.</br>  OTP  It's blatantly obvious she'll turn into the most generic tsundere possible when she finds out who Souma's dad is, enjoy her while she has a personality  <br>He isn't even a decent rival, so much that Souma barely gives a fuck about him.</br>  <br> enjoy her while she has a personality <br>Is conceited bitch a personality? I figured it was closer to a mental disease.</br></br>  <br>Would you buy a plushie of your qt rival?</br>  <br>Literal fucktoy<br><br>captcha: bicycles</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh, boy.</br></br>  <br>Even as a kid Erina wanted to fuck Soma's dad.<br><br>She wants it.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to hug this plushie.</br>  <br>Two week time skip does things to you.</br>  so what will happen next? Soma will beat Yugi in a Shokugeki and get his spot in the Elite10? then I guess we will get even more Erina, and she might actually find out who his dad is already.  Would she die ?  Hishoko is an angel.  <br>Erina is going to advance seats, I don't think she'll ever be below him.</br>  <br>That feels too early. Also the subplot where Kuga and Tsukasa have some sort of deal going on needs to be adressed. So I'm guessing Kuga wins, but barely, then gets rekt by Tsukasa in a shokugeki (maybe that was promised) then we get another arc, maybe two where Soma gets better and then finall Soma wrecks Kuga also in a shokugeki<br><br><br> implying endgame-posttimeskip-marriedtosoma-<wbr>momerina won't have short hair anyways</wbr> </br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd be sad. She takes pride in her appearance, even though she has never tasted love.</br>  <br>she looks like she has big ass sideburns with that retarded hair<br><br>give her a beard and she would truly look like a man<br><br>shes ugly</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> short hair <br>absolutely disgusting, and a surefire red flag for worst girl syndrome</br></br>  How long do you think this series will last? <br><br>250-350 chapters? more?</br></br>  <br> surefire red flag for worst girl syndrome <br>But that's wrong</br></br>  <br>The first school year will probably not be over by the time we hit chapter 150, especially if there's another meaningful event to weed out the rest of the undeserving first years before advancing to the second year.<br><br>This could potentially last into the 500s if it stays popular enough.</br></br></br>  <br>400 chapters.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128489613 <br> ... <br>Get the fuck out.<br/></br></br>  <br>It isn't even a Shokugeki for his seat, you dumbass.</br>  <br>I wonder what Takumi's fangirls think about Souma.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128489613 <br>Maybe because it is his first shounen ever?<br><br>Don't really see why that would be a problem or anything that should actually matter.</br></br></br>  <br>Souma and Megumi are probably the main enemies of the fanclub.</br>  <br>Not saying it matters, I just find it curious that Shokugeki no Souma happens to be the first shounen series of many of the posters in these threads.<br><br>Also I'm not sure why my post was deleted. /a/ mods today are deleting shit really needlessly.</br></br></br>  I feel bad for Megumi. If she ends up losing Soma to Erina, she won't have a guy to marry.  <br> That feels too early <br>We need to properly meet half of them before they leave in 4 months, it feels appropiate.<br>The deal with Tsukasa will probably be some fucktarded condition for a shokugeki which Souma will make him fail, so he gets buttmad and tries to wreck him in a shokugeki in front of the whole academy.</br></br></br>  <br>You really can't see why this wouldn't be a first shounen series for many people?<br><br>Hint:  It's because its a series about cooking and not about ninja's, swords, and magic. So its not your typical sounenshit that /a/ hates </br></br></br>  <br>Tosh's art is insane for a shonen mango</br>  <br>they probably are okay enough with him now since the knives that they wouldn't boo him during the inevitable souma-takumi shokugeki, but they'd still probably treat him disdainfully as takumi's rival. no heckling, but they might voodoo doll him or someshit. stuff like that.</br>  <br>I suppose that makes sense. I can honestly picture /a/nons looking at a series and disregarding it completely when they see in its description that it has any kind of fighting or magic in it. Many of them probably started reading Shokugeki no Souma thinking it wouldn't even be a traditional shounen.</br>  <br>350~450 chapters i say</br>  KUGA STATUS<br><br>[ ] NOT TOLD<br>[ ] TOLD<br>[ ] FUCKING TOLD<br>[X] MAPO TOLDFU</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It would be extremely painful?</br></br>  <br>souma's banter has always been super effective against kuga</br>  <br>It's not like Souma's ever really fought Takumi, so I don't think they'd care too much.<br><br>They must hate Mimasaka so much though.</br></br></br>  is there anyone that could win houjou's houjous?  <br>Yugi.</br>  what even was the point of takumi having a super-special-ultra-deluxe SECRET TRUMP CARD if it failed completely and spectacularly? might as well just not have given it to him at all, and instead set it up so that his "rebound" was based purely on innovation under pressure with the ingredients he had left, and it just wasn't enough.<br><br>intentionally giving him a gimmick and then having the gimmick get BTFO just shows takumi to be a really talentless hack in comparison to the top-tier cooks, because he can't figure shit out on his own.</br></br>  <br>megumi of course, houjou sounds like she'd be into that.</br>  <br>No she won't. At least not yet. Souma isn't challenging Kuga to a shokugeki for his E10 seat. She'll likely to advance next year when the the top 5 seats become vacant.</br>  <br>The real question is, will she hop over any of the current 2nd years in the process, or just remain in the status quo as 5th seat next year?</br>  <br>Most 1st years would have lost in that situation, Souma would have been wrecked hard against giganigga if he hadn't known his gimmick.</br>  <br>It wasn't so much about Takumi as about Subaru. To show off just how absurd his stalking predictions could be.</br>  <br>There's a lot of people who are willing to marry her anon.</br>  <br>That's not the point. The point is not that he was designed to lose, nor that he only was able to start a comeback due to quick thinking. The point is that you could do both of those things without introducing a gimmicky secret ace up the sleeve, it was completely unnecessary. If you're going to go so far as to introduce something like that, it should be a guaranteed win, since it's an emotionally-tied one-time-use trump card. If you're going to make it lose anyways, then the process of doing so should make Takumi look better in the process, instead of worse. Having him freak out under pressure and release his ultimate backup plan in a panic, shows him to be even more immature of a cook than before, particularly because his poor judgement was shown when it just wasn't enough to win.<br><br>You could still have all of the same plot/character development without the gimmick. Just write it so that he had a few more ingredients to begin with, and have him come up with some uniquely innovative idea under pressure. That's the same thing as what happened, but without using a gimmick to make it happen, so it comes off as more legit and less stupid when he loses.</br></br></br>  <br>It was more to establish that Subaru was such a badass he anticipated that Aldini would make at least one innovation and then make another one.<br><br>To be fair to Takumi, had he known Giga Nigga's gimmick he may have been able to pull what Soma did.</br></br></br>  <br>It really depends on Tootsuki's evaluation of her as well as other students gunning for a seat in the E10. If no other third years get into the E10 and Kuga drops out from their ranks she could get as high as fourth next year.</br>  <br>It wasn't even about that retard, don't listen to the other guys either. It wasn't about takumi's mental strength or giganigga being super hyped as a result, but about giganigga exploiting and corrupting the bond Takumi has with his brother. The gum on the mezzaluna, the insulting his brother's talents, the anticipation of the oil, the stealing of his mezzaluna, all were orchestrated to completely DESTROY takumi's bond with his brother. Giganigga isn't satisfied with merely winning by a landslide, he feels the need to emotionally cripple the opponent too.</br>  <br> implying she won't do side ponytail like Hinako or tie it up like a bunch of milf archetypes do. </br>  <br>Hot.</br>  <br>or she could just pass up kuga and eizan straight up, and be 3rd behind isshiki and nene<br><br>if some secret (to us as of right now) 2nd year makes it in as a 3rd year ahead of erina, she could end up as low as 7th too, with only 3 spots left for the current first years.</br></br></br>  Wasn't Erina's character song supposed to have come out recently?<br><br>Does anyone have it?</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!  <br>for some reason untie hair is my fetish.</br>  <br>She's only 15, you sick fuck.</br>  I WANT ERINA TO GIVE SOUMA  A LITTLE BROTHER!   <br>Perfectly legal.</br>  <br>You made me picture a cross-dressing Erina.

If you had actually said that I wouldn't have commented.<br><br> I knew you meant that, retard </br></br></br>   Raws incoming soon supposedly <br>I don't understand<br>it airs tomorrow right<br>that's not very soon</br></br></br>  <br>GET IN LINE!</br>  <br>someone post the gordon ramsay image about where's the subs it's raw, etc</br>  So they're skipping the Karaage arc?<br><br>The anime is going to adapt until chap 60, Shueisha will announce the second season for Spring 2016, r-right?</br></br>  <br>He's talking about the manga.</br>  <br> autumn election <br> in the spring <br>heh</br></br></br>  <br>what manga?</br>    <br>Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.</br>  <br> Shueisha will announce the second season for Spring 2016, r-right? <br>Not with those sales</br></br>  <br>wait really? I thought those images were just a fan work cause it looks like some porn I've read</br>  <br>It's a WSJ manga draw by Tosh. Please go read it.</br>  <br>That's because Tosh used to draw porn.</br>  <br><br>you should ask hayama that</br></br>  <br>BD/DVD sales really don't matter for WSJ manga when it comes to a second season. We'll probably get a S2 just because the anime boosted the manga sales.</br>  <br>wow never thought of that, he could probably tell from yards away whenever someone farts huh? not to mention the exact number of hours since someone has showered if they're near him.</br>  does an extremely aged loli smell good? rotting could be a weird preference  <br>virgin christmas cakes probably dump out tons of pheromones in a desperate attempt to attract a mate</br>  <br>It seems to do wonders for the quality, I think more should do it for the  experience </br>  Is this show gonna keep going after this season? It's kind of become my favorite thing ever.  <br>Yes.  in the manga </br>    <br>And then you stop and remember that he grew up in an Indian slum and wonder how on earth he could have survived those odors.</br>  <br><br> Teiki <br>Kill yourself, shitstain.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, probably. But you can always read the manga.</br>  <br>We'll see after this week's episode. We're hoping JC Staff just rearranged the arc.</br>  <br>It will likely get a second season. Maybe even a third once there's enough content from the manga to adapt. Not sure if they can go further than that.</br>  Where da raws at?  <br> Raws incoming soon supposedly, who hype for food cart comeback? <br><br>What? Raws are coming out this soon?</br></br></br>  <br>Chink scans in 8-10 hours.</br>  <br>Isn't the source a light novel with 14 volumes or so?</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>No, Shokugeki no Soma is a WSJ manga with 13 volumes and 3 LNs with side stories.</br>  We need a translator fag. Surely there's a chink on here that's a fan of this manga?  <br>Damn. At least ill have something to look forward too after work.</br>  <br>Are there any more LNs coming out or is it just those three?</br>  <br>I think we'll have more soon.</br>  <br>We have the Jifeng staff, they always give us spoiler pics.</br>  <br>I hope she gets character development someday.</br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>Erina's hair is super long.

I think not, we need one more bitch and we will have 5 end game pairings. Souma x Erina and Kurokiba x Alice are basically confirmed, Takumi x Megumi seems pretty realistic after that Drama CD. <br>Then, ehm, Hayama x Hisako? I mean, they had a pretty intense match, and he was basically a reason why she felt a need to left Erina and all that.<br>Nigga can fuck Stalker bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Takumi is already a bitch though</br>  <br>It's just the number you need for baseball.<br><br>Pitcher<br>Catcher<br>1st<br>2nd<br>3rd<br>Shortstop<br>Out right<br>Out center<br>Out left</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Souma x Erina and Kurokiba x Alice are basically confirmed <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br>Souma-Erina it's obvious<br>Ryou-Alice is semi-canon</br></br>  <br>  </br>  <br>Fucking lucky currynigger if that happens.</br>  <br>She can tie it all up really well when she wants to.</br>  <br>SHE'S A BIG GIRL</br>  <br>Is she wearing anything underneath?

He ended up keeping the colors for Manako and the multiple skin colors and eyes of Zombina and went with his own idea for the rest.</br>  <br>probably not going to be subspecies of zombies or dopplers</br>  <br>I wish they handled this part better in the anime, we never got to see sexy Papi belly up close like we did in the first episode.<br><br>Papi tummy best tummy.</br></br></br>  <br>Cyclops: 4 variants of Manako all using their text descriptions to hid their faces.</br>  <br> picking anything but "work in a lab with Suu as your chemical waste disposal unit" <br><br>It's like you faggots don't want to do SCIENCE!</br></br></br>  Ok, looking at the stalker points and how people on 2ch/niconico reacts to MonMusume seems like the adaptation is very popular. If Lerche is going to adapt like 20 chapters of the manga that leaves at least 15 chapters away and if the BD-DVD sales goes well we can think about a second season I guess.  We can all agree Zombie and Fish are worst.  <br>No fish is second best</br>  <br>Considering how well the series is doing I'd say a second season is basically guaranteed.</br>  <br>Murderfish will continue to be worse girl unless something in the newer chapters makes her somehow redeemable.</br>  <br>lets not get cocky</br>  <br>I checked a poll on Nico page and they said Monster Musume is like an Idol franchise.</br>  <br>I love how the print ads for the anime said <br><br>"They said it was a niche! They said it was a minor hit" They said it was only for maniacs! Well, we've sold over a million GNs and now an anime version is confirmed!"<br><br><br>Why? Seriously, Her low-grade insanity aside (they all have it basically), I like her.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> hating on Zombina </br>  <br>Only way she'd redeem herself is if she dies saving the rest of them.</br>  REMINDER<br>8<br>DAYS UNTIL THE FULL MOON.<br>Protect you homes and yourself. Always be prepared. Always be alert.</br></br></br>  <br>is that bad?</br>  <br>But I want to get cocky.</br>  TF are you there? can you please translate or doing a summary of what the VA's said here?  <br>I wonder if a full moon has a greater effect on canine based monstergirls?</br>  <br>I'm still disappointed nothing happened on that Blood Moon we had.</br>  <br>And this one too please.</br>  <br>Zombina is great.</br>  <br>But she can't be worst girl  because Miia is the worst girl. </br>  <br>That means Monster Musume is getting very, very popular and japanfags loves it. If he studio doesn't make an S2 or explode this on OVA's and stuff to sell is because they are retarded.</br>  <br><br>Well, you say she is the SUUperior Waifu</br></br>  <br>Listen here you little spic.</br>  <br>Suu?</br>  <br>how are the bd sales?</br>  <br> crab man's panic goes into overtime when they ask him for a second season </br>  <br>Not me, I find that kind of attitude childish.</br>  <br>I just want to make love to giant Suu.</br>  <br>Non-existent until September.</br>  I'm the only one who can't stop looking at this image? Miia looks so beautiful.  <br>I want to terrorize tokyo with giant suu</br>  <br>We have the stalker points, is on the top 5 of the highest reservations.</br>  <br> ear the same color as her skin </br>  <br>how often do the top five of that get second cours?</br>  <br>Throw monitor in garbage then unless you can unfuck your screen's color.</br>  <br>It really is a beautiful pic.</br>    <br> hating Zombina </br>  <br>is that kojima in the center</br>  <br>Junji gets all the bitches.</br>  <br>Darlings va</br>  <br>Did anyone ever ask Crabman if Miia's name for Darling is inspired by Lum?</br>  <br>So this is what a 3D harem looks like.</br>  <br>Purest of the purest.</br>  <br>I can't wait to get this</br>  So when will the #35 translation be available?

Let's see him do it again with 7.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, it's the same retard calling everyone a secondary if something upsets him</br>  <br> not able to make a decent argument <br> I-I was pretending! <br><br>C´mon retard, can you be more pathetic?</br></br></br></br>  Would Rachnera get upset / give you a weird look for squashing a household spider?  <br>No because she's not a spider</br>  <br>Nigger, the answer is simple.<br><br>  He survives thanks to Lala, who was actually stalking him all the time. That was explained long ago but animeonlyfags doesn't know that and instead of reading the manga they just come here and throw retarded questions. </br></br></br>  Daily reminder that you cannot come up with possible scenarios that deviate an inch from the source material, just for the sake of some interesting point/talk/discussion/fun/possibili<wbr>ty/etc without being called secondary, this is serious business.</wbr>  <br><br>Read the OP retards, you're not allowed here.</br></br>  <br>She'd probably kill it first, spiders can be pretty territorial.</br>  <br>Spiders regularly eat other spiders. They have little care for each other even when it could be a potential mate.</br>  <br> Catches a spider in her web. <br> Awkward face. </br></br>  <br>well, she gets kinda touchy about how her looks scare humans, and killing a fucking spider for no good reason might be a little upseting for reminding her of that fact.</br>  Give me your best images of Tio  <br>her limbs are far too skinny</br>  <br>Lala's made it pretty clear that she doesn't help him at all, and his ability to come back from damn near anything is part of why he's so interesting to her.<br><br>I don't think we've seen a full moon since the first one, but assuming things have been going on long enough for a second to have happened, it's probably safe to go with 'everybody goes to bed early that night'.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask Hound for that, but since he becomes a boring faggot I think he's not able to do that anymore.</br>  <br> Lala's made it pretty clear that she doesn't help him at all, and his ability to come back from damn near anything is part of why he's so interesting to her. <br><br>It's retarded Lalafag headcanon</br></br></br>  <br>You too have my pity anon for not being able to diffrentiate the genuine from the facetious.</br>  <br>Lala was a little tsun about that, you can notice the reaction and how she blushes when she said that.</br>    <br>I almost feel like you made that yourself.<br>Just chill, man.<br>If a question is easy to answer, it's easy to answer.<br>If it's complicated, yes, you can tell somebody to read the manga to find out, because it'd take too long to explain.<br>I think the main rule to have is to <br> JUST<br> TAKE IT EASY. </br> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather get sweaty all over and let Suu do as she pleases.</br>  <br>anon the manga already went over the issue<br>papi has no problem eating poultry, <br>mero has no problem eating fish<br>they simply do not see these things any more similar than a human a rat.</br></br></br></br>  <br>or carryover headcanon from the orginal comics</br>  <br>try reading the mang<br>a before posting</br></br>  <br/>  Is Lala purple or that tint is used just to convey she's really pale?  <br>Not the same anon but someone explain that pretty well the last thread.<br><br>The deal with secondaries is how they come to these threads and start asking things they can easily get from reading the manga, even in one day you can rush all the 34 chapters translated but they don't do that, instead of that they go full rampage and start a chain of shitpost every single time or even create new threads talking shit about MonMusume because they get BTFO from here. <br><br>The hate against secondaries is very justified, try to check Jitsu or GATE threads as a good example of what I'm talking about.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm not saving you... You keep coming back to life. And it's not to preserve your own life, but to make the others happy... <br><br>Seems pretty clear she's not keeping him alive from where I sit. Or did you think he was saying that her NOT saving him is retarded lalafag headcanon?</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not saving you... You keep coming back to life. And it's not to preserve your own life, but to make the others happy... <br><br>Congratulations, you're retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but in those cases you can justify it because they're food. In the other situation you're killing it because you're grossed out. Hence why she would feel weird about it because she shares similar traits. But most likely it's a non issue, but it's fun to speculate I guess</br>  <br>This fucking guy.</br>  <br><br>The original post quoted the passage saying Lala doesn't help him, followed by saying that it's retarded Lalafag headcannon</br></br>    <br>Okay, so you misunderstood him. To me, at least, it seems pretty clear he was saying 'Lala saves his every time' is retarded lalafag headcanon.</br>  <br>I see.<br>So it's not about people willingly curiously coming in, actually trying to learn more about the series.<br>They're just trying to be annoying.<br>Is that right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>oh wow thats cute mang</br>  <br> retarded lalafag headcanon <br>You say it like there's more than one Lalafag claiming that.</br></br>  <br> best girl hugs trash can.jpg </br>  <br>People who comes here for the adaptation are welcome here but if they act like retards and start all the shitpost they obviously get their asses kicked from here. <br><br>There is some people who ask themselves "oh this comes from a manga? I should read it" doing that those guys can comes here and talk with the old mangafags in these threads normally, but there is always like 3 or 5 retards spreading shit all over the place.</br></br></br>  <br>Do not bully the cry baby.</br>  Let go of the hate. Love monster girls. Thank the almighty Crabman  <br> The hate against secondaries is very justified <br>its not, you're just trying to stir up drama.</br></br>    Ok<br>It seems like the Anime will be two chapters an episode and at 12 episodes it will cover every chapter up till Lala comes into the house hold. The snake shedding chapter is chapter 7 and episode 3 ended at chapter 6 (so don't know why people think it was skipped) should be the first half of the next episode. Also don't see a reason to believe that they will skip Polt yet.</br>  <br>The fish was always worst girl.</br>  <br>polt and shedding will be skipped<br>you can bet your ass on it</br></br>  <br>Darling stronk.</br>  <br>I think he's saying in so much as dealing with only the new people who AREN'T in it just to enjoy the series, but for some other, more annoying reason.</br>  <br>Fuck you crabman, I did this yesterday and no monstergirls appeared</br>  <br>Try again today Padawan</br>  <br>Except the vast majority of the shitposting is coming from the samefag that starts every thread and starts shitting himself about "FAGGOT SECONDARY NORMIE FAGGOTS" whenever someone disagrees with him.</br>  <br>Hail Smith</br>  <br>We know it's skipped already, just look at the preview and the story section on their website. No mention of it</br>  <br>*Sumissu</br>  <br>The snake shedding episode segways into the intro of Suu episode (chapters 7 and 8).<br>Seems like it would be pointless to skip it and it is the next chapter after the full moon chapter. So far it looks like 24 chapters of the manga will be covered.</br></br>  Anime original scene incoming to fill in where the shedding should have been. At least it involves Miia  <br>A rose by any other name.</br>  <br>ARIGATOU CRABMAN!<br> pls, crabman, this would be my first time </br></br>  <br> Darling's face <br><br>She's having a dream.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Mero is just delusional. She can claim insanity.<br><br>Miia is a legitimately shitty character.</br></br></br>  <br>Did the blurred corners tip you off?<br>If it's not a dream, I don't know what the fuck.</br></br>  <br> polt skipped <br>pls no<br>why?</br></br></br>  <br>you damn well know why anon</br>  <br>To be fair, she hasn't had a lot of good experiences dealing with Rachnee.<br>She ties her up all the time.<br>At one point she even tied up her mom, too.</br></br></br>  <br>Hand-holding too lewd for TV.</br>  <br>skimmed the chapter, there wasnt really anything objectionable</br>  <br> lock up Suu <br>In what? Unless it's super sturdy and airtight, she could just ooze out of it.</br></br>  <br> At one point she even tied up her mom, too <br>Rightfully so.</br></br>  The Tio scenes where she's trying to be a girly-girl despite being &gt;7 feet tall are hilarious<br><br>Why isn't there more of this</br></br>  <br>Indeed, rightfully so.<br>But looking at it from Miia's perspective, I can see that she just doesn't enjoy having her as a roommate.<br>Being an extra contestant for Darling might as well be an extra with that.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I want to climb her.</br>  <br>Miia most likely dreams about getting her pussy slammed by Darling<br><br>Best girl</br></br></br>  <br><br> that top-left screen-shot <br><br>I don't remember that in the Manga. What scene is that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anime original</br>  <br>Papi and Suu do, even Cerea got on good terms with her. Miia is just a cunt.</br>  <br>It's actually  the series ending still </br>  <br><br><br>I doubt he meant that seriously.<br>That was a joking statement in reference to the fact that it would end the pressure he's under, not indicative of the actual choice he'd make were it an option.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Papi and Suu <br>Simple-minded. They just like she can make rides.<br><br> Cerea <br><br>Doesn't like her, buries those feelings to better serve Master.<br><br>Miia hates her and isn't afraid to say it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>stop being such a killjoy</br>  <br> Dullahan <br>I'm curious about the variants.</br></br>  <br>Cerea doesn't like Rachnera either</br>  <br>Hmm...<br>I got nothing, you may have a point there.<br>But dammit, Miia is still my waifu.</br></br></br>  The shedding scene is part of the fake director chapter that leads into Rachnea intro (he wanted Mia's shed skin) still think it will be included. Checked out the chapter 4 episode and it looks like it will cover chapter 8 and 9. So the may just be shuffeling some chapters around. Again they seem to be heading towards covering 24 chapters and not padding any single episode to a full episode (just two chapters an episode).   Rachnera sneezes <br> bukkakes all over Cerea </br>   128499194 <br> Anon </br>  <br> being in denial </br>  There's nothing illegal going on in this thread, right?  <br>i thought Mero's hair was completely pink</br>  <br>The only logical choice</br>  <br>Fuck the police</br>    <br>But what about Lala?</br>  <br>Only if the police is Smith</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>Papi and Suu might be simple-minded, but their affection is genuine. Miia hates everyone except Darling because she needs his dick only to herself.<br><br><br>She didn't before Rachnera forced her to be honest to her feelings. Then she said she could count on her.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't start.</br>  <br><br> Centaur <br><br>Wait, we got one?<br>Haven't watched the episode yet, but I've been in every Monmusu Thread this week since and I haven't seen it posted.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wins after Darling dies.</br>  <br>Dolphin has been hugged, chief.</br>  <br>d-does that mean  yandere potential? </br>  <br><br>IT'S GONNA' GET ROCKY</br></br>  <br> tfw no Lala in wedding dress </br>  <br>IN DA RAIN OR IN DA SNOW</br>  <br>N YES. </br>    <br><br>S2 OP<br><br> In 2 years </br></br></br></br>  <br> Miia hates everyone except Darling because she needs his dick only to herself. <br><br>I think she is kind of friends with Centorea</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with <br><br><br>but at the end of the day, it's Darling she wants. Nothing wrong with honesty.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> S2 OP <br> Starts pretty much the same as S1 except now with Lala <br> She's wearing a "what the fuck am I doing here" expression the whole time </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> transparent </br>  Here's something to consider: Mero gets a lot of shit for her fantasies, but Cerea is also guilty of this to a lesser extent. She wants to serve a master in a traditional sense, but she also has warped it into some fiction to rival the likes of ancient lore (and then there was that "running away together" thing when Lala first scared them). Or I could be wrong, I just thought I'd bring that up for debate.  <br><br> believing chuuni delusions </br></br>  <br>S-Shut up.</br>  <br><br>We're not even sure she CAN "mate".<br><br> She sure as Hell can try though. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Post it.</br></br>  <br>"Monster, monster, mon mon mon monster, now with Lala!</br>  <br>Miia seems to find her useful on some occasions, like when Rachnera showed up. I don't see much more beyond that, she's still a rival in her eyes.<br><br><br>They all want him, but she's the only one who's always thinking about the others as enemies. And in that image she was anything but honest.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Monmusu aren't the animals they resemble. They are women with some physical-parts of their body that happen to resemble animals.<br><br>We've repeatedly seen that no Monmusu has any real emotional connection to any of the animals they resemble.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Starts pretty much the same as S1 <br> not having a whole new OP that includes new monstergirl </br></br>  <br>As was said in the last chapter,  Mero is a princess. She says that “It’s just a small country among many”, but nonetheless, her mother, the queen has ordered her home, saying there are threats against her. Cerea bends a knee and apologies for any and all rudeness to her majesty, saying she always knew she was royalty. Papi and Suu are both wrecked at the idea of her leaving, until Rachnee points out “It’s just a visit, right? She’ll come back soon.” They all decide to go to the hotel her mother is staying at, which looks like a castle. After narrowly avoiding being drowned (it’s a hotel for sea creatures, after all), they all go to the beach (swimsuit issue, even Suu gets a wet suit so she can play in the ocean, although her head soaks up water and makes her tits pop out.) As Mero is told by her mother she must return for good, Miia and Cerea get orgasmic massages from the Eel people, while Rachnee is fishing with her thread, wondering why she’s only getting rays. Suddenly, an army of crabs boil out of the ocean, swarming the kitchen and chewing up all the fish (right as all the customers come for dinner, since the beach is closed). The fish-headed chefs panic, and Darling comes to the rescue, salvaging what he can, and ordering Rachnee to catch all the arys she can (“It’s so rare of you to ask me for a favour…”, she says). Using the remaining fish and vegetables, as well as rays Rachnee catches, he manages to feed an entire hotel’s worth of super upscale customers. When they look for Mero, it’s discovered that she was kidnapped by “0” <br><br><br>She's honest in her desire to get what she wants. Good for her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> also one of the best girls <br> one of <br>I believe you're mistaken.</br></br></br>  <br>Heil Schmidt!</br>  <br>Girls will be girls in this series, I think. They all like their crazy fantasies, Mero just has a taste for tragedies and Cerea has a high regard for tradition, with a touch of a rebellious side.</br>  <br>Please no, we don't need any more girls in his harem. Lala still doesn't really exist</br>  <br>There's a chance she wasn't being a chuuni there. We can't forget she's a dullahan, despite her personality.</br>  <br> zombie <br> worst <br><br>What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in MON, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Orc Gangs, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top commando in the entire Monster Ops: Neutralization. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across Japan and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of MON and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> In the other situation you're killing it because you're grossed out. <br><br>You're killing it because it's a invasive species with a bite that is actually considerably hazardous to humans, same as a wasp or a bee in the house.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Something I've been confused about, but when exactly did Suu start speaking? I know she got giant and got smart there, and then ate some poison shrooms and started talking then. Did she just keep talking, because I don't remember there ever being that moment of "oh hey, Suu's talking".</br>  <br><br> It seems like the Anime will be two chapters an episode and at 12 episodes it will cover every chapter up till Lala comes into the house hold. <br><br>Not necessarily. There are likely several chapters that won't be able to be well-compressed into 11 minutes of footage.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was the chapter Kurusu got sick.</br>  <br>Need a hug?</br>  <br> Good for her <br>Is it? It seems to me that she'll have to learn how to share Darling before harem end happens, so being that "honest" won't help much.</br></br>  <br>At least we know this chapter will get animated</br>  <br><br> Miia's shitty for being glad that the woman who has repeatedly tried to rape the man she loves behind her back may be leaving. <br><br>Yeah, she's a real cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Freeze her.<br><br>Like in The Blob.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There would be a fucking riot if they tried to skip it.</br>  <br>She seems to be picking up more and more speech/intelligence as the series continues. in Chapter 34 she was down-right devious.<br><br><br>Or poison everyone else. She is always "trying to learn to cook".</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean the girls that's not in his harem, faggot.</br>  <br>She's been contained by a trash bag before.</br>  <br>she and lala need to meet</br>  <br> Report and ignore secondaries shitposters, crossboarders, retards from other threads <br> Keep the thread clean <br>oh the irony</br></br></br>  <br><br> Miia most likely dreams about getting her pussy slammed by Darling <br><br>It's not even "most likely" anymore.

And then, for an unknown amount of time, the government KNEW these places and creatures existed but kept it secret from the public. I like to imagine this was like the Men In Black franchise of comics and movies, but with Monmusus instead of aliens.<br><br>Then, in 2009, the government goes public with this information. Apparently society DOESN'T freak the Hell out, and aside from a few sparse problems integration into human society goes well.<br>Then, 3 years later, in 2012, the story we get in MMnIN begins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if anon was a woman.</br>  <br>I think a better question would be is would I leave?</br>  <br>Haw-haw.</br>  <br>Well meme'd!</br>    <br>In other words, his one-shots are based on a true story.

Thanks.<br><br>If I am allowed to pose a question: Do you think in terms of innocence it has to do with the subject(Person attracted to the younger girls) losing their own innocence?

If they were clothed, it might have been something to appreciate at least, but still would only be a kiss.</br></br>  <br>That's sad, but Illya and Kuro are what matters to me most anyways.<br>A Tatsuko would be the best though.</br></br>  Jesus so many deleted post in this thread.  <br>This OVA isn't of the hentai kind, they can't go too far. <br>Also, Nature is lewd as fuck.</br></br>  <br><br> Replying to LRD </br></br>  <br> Bath scene nudity is not lewd </br>  <br>I see so do you find petite women attractive? I have seen anime where there are girls who are supposed to be 12 or 13 and they do not act nor look that age at all. Their voices in the anime are different from a prepubescent teen; their bodies are FAR more developed physically. Or maybe their diction implies a higher level of maturity that highly contrasts their actual age in the plot of said anime. In other words, similar to me, you are simply attracted to women who physically look similar to the girls depicted in the anime. The only girls who fit those criteria ironically might happen to be lolis?<br><br>Thank you for your insight.</br></br></br>  <br>I believe that's one of the script writers for the show. Remember C^3? She's the author of that and years later, is doing script work for Prisma in SL which coincidentally is the same studio that produced C^3.</br>  <br>Not him, but I don't think losing their innocence is really attractive.<br>I mean, they are always innocent beings no matter if they have sex or not.<br>Also, it is more a physical attraction more than anything, especially since in the 2D case they tend to "fix" the common "errors" real life children have, like an undeveloped waist for example.</br></br></br>  <br> they are under age <br> under age  <br> that is something I find obliterates my sexual attraction to people <br>Then you are literally mentally ill and/or brainwashed.<br><br>Now fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I will care when they show something as lewd as the specials.</br>  <br> namefag <br> acting like a complete newfag <br><br>0/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't. Everyone and their mother has seen it in public baths, on TV and the like, so it isn't inherently sexual.<br>Put them in their bedroom, and I'd agree this is lewd.</br></br>  <br>This really isn't that lewd. They aren't even kissing.</br>  <br> two women nude kissing and rubbing their tits in a bath isn't lewd <br> two women nude kissing and rubbing their tits in a bedroom suddenly is lewd <br>How does your brain works?</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not lewd if it's platonic sex.</br></br>  <br>Something you see a lot in people who have a physical attraction to boys or girls who are not physically mature is an attraction to innocence. It ties to trauma the patient experienced as a kid, often times causing them to lose their own innocence forcefully. It can be very damaging to a kid to become aware of the darker aspects of life before they are in a strong enough mental state to deal with the additional stress. Long story short that one event snowballs and the result is sometimes an attraction to innocence. It is a subconscious and conscious attraction simultaneously. The subconscious part of the equation is the trauma and the consequences of it.<br><br>Its an extremely touchy part of psychology because every case is different. Some people that sexually abuse children have completely different mental diseases.

Did you like it?</br></br>  <br><br>I like  it to be animated. </br></br>  <br>Her, Midori, and like Shuichi I guess. They all sorta dropped out of the main cast once auditions and trumpet solo melodrama came around. Obviously they were still there, but they just felt less important, you know?</br>  <br>Not that guy but Taki does look a bit weird.</br>  <br>They were only really in the main cast because Yamada need her 4-5 friendship group for the OP and ED.</br>  <br>He looks fine by me.</br>  Make way for real art<br>http://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/t<wbr>hank_you_tuba_kun</wbr></br>  <br>His legs look stumpy compared to the length of his torso, his back his is oddly hunched forward and the way his shoulder + arm is positioned looks kinda unnatural.</br>  <br>Yeah Reina does look good, its just her hair bothers me. Any minute now I think its gonna fall off in the pic. Sorry just saying, I tend to say things I'm not suppose to sometimes. I mean I like the art its just Taki needs to be drawn more lean and stuff. Fujoshi's are the best at drawing men. I seen a really nice Taki drawing by one.</br>    <br>There are a few small things wrong with the drawing.</br>  <br>But you care enough to reply on a Hibike thread.<br>What a losser.</br></br>  <br>i-it's too cute for you!</br>  <br>why everyone likes shuui</br>  <br>There's a part of his legs the drawing isn't covering for perspective's sake.

I liked how he was able to point out Asuka's "flaws" before the rest of the cast, and he had great chemistry with Kumiko. I preferred their interactions to Kumiko and Reina, which came off as like "unrealistic" I guess, I can't think of a good word.</br>  <br> taki's right arm isn't drawn to show that it's angling inwards so it looks too short <br> taki's legs are too short <br> taki's back is oddly hunched over  <br> reina's legs are angled too inward and start too far away from the center of her body </br></br></br></br>  <br>The artist is quite good at drawing Taki though<br><br><br>She's fixed that drawing several times.

Kumiko and Shuuichi don't get together until the very end, like right after Nationals. Season 2 is gonna focus on regionals, the second years, Taki, Asuka, new characters and Band Camp.

She has an attractive teacher next to her who lifts his shirt slightly to fan himself, and somehow that makes her feel hot/turned on.</br>  Emerald-chan  <br>Good question, anon. I can't choose between these two.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128487934 <br>Kyoani just enjoys doing yuri scenes. There is no ulterior motive. They don't plan on retconning the story and making them a couple. They don't intentionally plan on fucking with yuri fans by making them believe they're making them a yuri couple only to give them a het end. They read the novels, thought their scenes were nice, and thought "How can we expand on this?". You people are all making a much bigger deal out of it than it really is.<br><br>Can't you just enjoy the show without all this faggotry? Ironic that people here constantly complain about how yuri scenes detract from the show but 50% of all conversation is always yuri related.</br></br></br>  <br>The design is the of the same quality for all characters. What's of favorite type, I'm doubting between Natsuki and Asuka.</br>  <br> Plenty of scenes? <br><br>Only like 3 scenes. And its mostly Reina talking about him to Kumiko or Reina -----&gt; Taki or Reina angsting over Taki. Most of the scenes are dedicated to the second years and Asuka. but who knows maybe they will throw some extra stuff for Reina. But they will focus more on other characters.</br></br></br>  <br> Kumikos octopus hair &gt; ponztail </br>  <br> Ironic that people here constantly complain about how yuri scenes detract from the show but 50% of all conversation is always yuri related <br>Of course it is. Fifty percent of the show was yuri related. Which is an issue when the yuri doesn't go anywhere.</br></br>  <br>She is best.</br>  <br>Kumiko and Shuuichi have a much nicer and cute relationship in the novels. I'm just bitter they didn't show their true dynamic in the anime.</br>  <br>I hope KyoAni add scenes with Kumiko and Hashimoto.</br>  <br>We got the scene where Reina goes to his ofice early in the morning, and the scene where she asks him if he's dating the hot teacher.</br>  <br> Fifty percent of the show was yuri related. <br>It literally wasn't. Episode 8 had a slightly longer scene, but no other episode spent more than a minute of subtext scenes. And outside of episodes 8 and 11, no episode had heavy subtext at all, all of them require you to wear yuri goggles to consider the yuri scenes. <br><br>These threads just blew everything out of proportion by trying to overanalyze every single frame.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah with Kumiko next to her like when she goes to the office or observing her like when she pushes her to talk to Taki at band camp. <br><br>We never get scenes of them together alone. Kumiko is the main character and instead of focusing on the talk with Taki and Reina, she turns her attention to Hashimoto, who scares the shit out of her.</br></br></br>  <br>Its still going down in history as the KyoAni show with Yuribait. Thats all people talk about not just here, but outside this site.</br>  <br>Kumko isn't next to her though. She's awaiting outside and Reina talks to Taki personally.</br>  <br>I guess I'm considering most of Kumiko and Reina's scenes to be "yuri related," and I can see why people might not agree with that view (because obviously the actual yuri stuff is more confined), but I feel like their relationship is sort of colored by the subtext scenes. If you'd like, I can instead say that fifty percent of the show was about a relationship with (misleading) yuri undertones.</br>  <br>Its still not the main focus though. Since Its in Kumiko's POV.</br>  <br>Why does she cover her ears than if she isn't near her? Reina can't be that loud when?</br>  <br>So what? all of HIbike is from Kumiko's pov, but they clearly changed that in the anime.</br>  <br>Did they really? we don't exactly get inner thoughts from any other character, and only glimpse of what they are doing out side of Kumiko's eyes.</br>  You guys do know there is gonna be more Yuri subtext in the second season right? Especially with Yuuko/Natsuki and Mizore/Nozomi.  <br>I would definitely agree that Kumiko and Reina's relationship and the character growth Kumiko experiences due to Reina is one of the most important parts of the show, if not the single most important plot point.<br><br>But half the show being about them is still a gross exaggeration. It's enough to look at the screen time Reina had. She was featured prominently in the festival episode and the second audition episode, but I doubt there was any other episode in the show where she had more than five minutes of screen time (not just with Kumiko, but in general).</br></br></br>  <br>I am fairly frightened of the idea of Reina as a mom. She could be such a bully, especially over music.</br>  <br> second season <br>Nice one.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait for Asuka Love Story movie</br>  <br>Outside of 1-2 people like <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128488878  who use the word "degenerate" unironically, I don't think there are many people who have any problems with that. People are annoyed by "yuri bait", the relationship between Kumiko and Reina which will never be a romantic relationship, they're not annoyed by the idea of having yuri subtext. And annoyance with "yuri bait" is not an exclusively anti-yuri thing, either.</br>  <br> Asuka love story? <br><br>Don't even joke about her plot, Asuka really goes through a lot of shit in volume 3. The movie if anything will focus heavily on the Eupho Trio and since Its KyoAni Haruka, Kaori and their friendship with Asuka.</br></br></br>  <br>useless-chan<br>sorry novelanon</br></br>  <br>But you and I both know, the second years are gonna have a lot of focus as well as Asuka, and by the spoilers, Yuuko/Natsuki and Nozomi/Mizore are quite gay with each other.</br>  <br>That's why Asuka Love Story, a movie about how she could surpass difficult times through her passion for music you pleb</br>   tfw Asuka villain on next season   <br>Isn't it more about her daddy issues? Or how connected her and Kumiko are to one another?</br>  oct should come closer....  <br>Yes, I have never disputed that.</br>  <br>Asuka did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>This. I'm fine with actual yuri, I just don't enjoy shows giving non-romantic relationships romantic flavor that doesn't feed into anything.</br>  Post your favorite scene  <br>this was the moment when we realized that bestsuki was the best character, right?</br>   kyoani will use cg for the instruments they said   <br>Reina would be the cutest mom</br>  <br><br>Reina was bullied when she was a child due to her personality.

It was meant for this anon<br/></br>  <br>People do care about the canon stuff. Not now maybe, but once the anime starts, the second years are gonna be even more popular with the amount of focus. Natsuki also gets a lot of focus in the second and third novel, and she already has a lot of art on pixiv. Imagine how popular she'll get by the time KyoAni starts to put her in promo art, right beside Nozomi. since they are team Flute.</br>  <br>No she covers her ear because Reina is too loud, also she's beside her because Kumiko also notices how red Reina's cheeks become, you can't really see that kind of detail far away. And Novel anon also stated that Reina and Taki when they have scenes are always in front of Kumiko. They never have a real private scene without Kumiko. Maybe the anime will change that, but I we'll just have to see.</br>    I want to grab pigtails.  <br>bochou did nothing wrong</br>  <br><br><br>they will force yuri upon us next season and there's nothing you can do about it</br></br></br>  You will never open a cafe with Natsuki.<br><br>Why even make capital?</br></br>  <br> Why even make capital? <br>So you can pay people to animate more Natsuki.</br></br>  <br>w-wait<br>are you the guy who was making the kaori doujin?</br></br>  I want to cum in Asuka's mouth.

Doujins of kumiko pulling her hair from behind, when?</br>  <br>everytime</br>  <br>Sorry just saying, I tend to say things I'm not suppose to sometimes.</br>  <br>I mean, I agree too. The artist needs a more natural feel, but the pose is cute.</br>  <br><br>Link me.</br></br>  <br><br>What do you think about this art?<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's adorable, good lively characters and cute faces.</br>  <br>Shit. Western style is never good with animu.<br>The stick anatomy is the worst part of it though.</br></br>  <br> Doujins of kumiko pulling her hair from behind, when? </br>  <br>You'll get it but with this artsyle<br/></br>  <br>w-well we can always use imagination</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>goddammit</br>  <br>surprising</br>   tfw seiyuus ship Kumirei <br>feels good.</br>  <br><br>Seems like one autist spamming.</br></br>  Asuka reminds me of some of the girls I knew in band or theater  who were obviously lesbians but waiting until college to come out .  <br>Illegally cute.<br> doujins by this artist when? </br></br>  <br><br>seconding this<br><br>her art is really good</br></br></br></br>  This is the face of somebody in love  <br>Noway in hell is she a better artist than Nori</br>  Why didn't this show sell that well?  <br>What does Nori has to do with anything? god yurifags, are you so petty you have to compare everything? Anyways, her art is pretty cute and the way she draw the kyoani style is pretty accurate, can't say the same about Nori though. Just look at Reina and Kumiko's face.<br> Besides, I went and looked at her pixiv profile and she's a hobbyist artist. She's doing a good job so far </br></br>  <br>Who said I was a yurifag? God you anti yuri shits need to get over yourselves. I'm just saying that in terms of hibike art, Nori has the best ability and the art you're praising isn't anywhere near god like.</br>  <br>nice try to movement the thread but at this rate no one cares that much</br>  <br>Nori is godtier in every he does though, not only Hibike. He must be a professional artist.<br>Anyways, it doesn't mean ferufer's art is bad in any way. There's always going to be someone better anyways.</br></br>  I do wonder how people will get through the amount of yuri subtext in the second season with the second years, and how Reina becomes less important compare to Asuka.  <br>he is right though Nori doesn't have nothing to do with It</br>  <br><br>I don't frequent that much, I'm genuinely curious.</br></br>  <br>well they will react well?</br>  <br><br>It'll probably sell 9k average. That isn't bad.</br></br>  <br>Most people hate Asuka, so with her getting more focus compare to Reina, it will get ugly.</br>  <br>Well if that's the case Hibike wasn't a flop by any means, actually it sold quite well.<br> but for Kyoani standwards  <br>That's relative and shouldn't be used as "argument". What's definitive is that the production price to make Hibike was low compared to others studios, certainly the lowest between the major ones. <br>Just like this anon said  9k average wouldn't be bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Most people hate Asuka <br>You are just making things up. Do you even browse Hibikes threads, curious one?</br></br>  <br><br>9k might have been optimistic, but for comparison.<br><br>Nichijou 3,020<br>Tamako Market 3,818<br>KnK 4,503<br>Amagi 6,732<br>Chu2Ren 7,063<br><br>Eupho will probably outsell all of these, but it depends on how well the remaining volumes sell. The next recent KyoAni show that comes close is Hyouka with 10,044.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Wat are you doing Jun ?<br><br>Dont yousee the tombo is suffering.</br></br>  <br>She'll have no choice now but to question him about his relationship with Carrol.

So Jun has no problems getting touchy-feely with other girls? I thought it was only Tomo.  <br><br>He does Judo right? Or was it only Tomo that does it? Anyway if he does I imagine he's become very methodical and professional when it comes to Judo and doesn't think of it in the same way as normal physical contact. <br><br>Also Cotton Candy is growing on me immensely, too bad British girls aren't anything like her in real life.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IIRC Tomo does judo, he does karate with her father.</br>  Tomboys are for<br> Getting in fights with her<br>Playing sports with her<br>Watching kung-fu movies with her and trying to copy the moves<br>Teasing her and laughing when she gets mad and pouts<br>Letting her pin you so you can feel her body pressed against yours<br>Flipping her back over so that you can stare into each other's eyes<br>Protecting her from bullies even though you know she can handle herself<br>Cheering her on and always supporting her, win or lose<br>Throwing her a victory barbeque where you make all her favorite foods<br>Massaging their legs, shoulders, and back<br>Holding them close and telling her you love her<br>Reassuring her that she is the most beautiful girl in the world when she gets jealous of the more feminine girls<br>Accepting all of her girlish sensibilities, no matter how much she hates you finding out about them<br>Patting her head<br>Getting caught in the rain during a cross country run and having to huddle together with her under an abandoned bus stop waiting for it to pass<br>Holding her hand in public<br>Making her try on cute dresses when you're out on a date even though you know she'll never buy one<br>Buying her sexy black lace lingerie, only for her to wear spats over them<br>Tracing your finger over the tanlines she got during the summer and feeling how warm her skin is<br>Having her jump into your arms and kiss you after spending time apart over vacation<br>Introducing her to your parents<br>Marriage<br>Carrying her over the threshold of your new home to start a life together while she punches you in the shoulder and pouts that she can walk just fine herself<br>Gently laying her down on the bed<br>Whispering into her ear how much she means to you while caressing her toned body<br>Spending an entire night making passionate love to each other<br>Raising a new generation of tomboys with<br>Loving unconditionally as you grow old together</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br>These are the things that tomboys are for</br></br>  No....NO,<br><br>The god of NTR is shining his detestable urges onto me again.<br><br>Jun x Cotton..no,no.</br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 that picture of a tomboy getting beaten to death.</br>  Is this daily updated?<br><br>Weird.</br></br>  I wish this didn't go a page at a time.  <br>I thought I would hate it, but I ended up thinking that wouldn't be a bad pairing.</br>  <br>That's why you wait.</br>  No mangaka can go against the universal rule of tomboy losing.  <br>If he does I will kill him.</br>  <br>As expected of boobs</br>  <br>Why does this happen?</br>  <br><br>Luckily tomboys win in  H-manga .</br></br>  Tomboy = Canon<br>Misuzu = vanilla doujin<br>Cotton = NTR doujin</br></br>  <br>Tell that to adachi.</br>  <br>Bring in the jelly tomboy.</br>  <br> Misuzu = vanilla doujin <br><br> vanilla <br><br>That's not how you spell sadomasochistic.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Still mad that series got killed by exams.<br><br>She learned from that experience though but used it on a vastly inferior series.</br></br></br>  <br>I have been shown my horrible short sightedness.</br>  <br><br><br>Tomboy are for suffering</br></br></br>  <br>I never pay attention to this but I know it makes people booty blasted. Context?</br>  Misuzu is a girl<br><br>An evil one.</br></br>  <br>Edgy author on edgy series. Just that. No moral lesson, no likeable character, no interesting plot. Just edgy stuff.</br>  <br> no likeable character <br>Well except the one getting beat to death in these pages.</br></br>  <br>thanks to Tomo-chan and /a/ I've learned they're also good for NTRing</br>  CHILDHOOD FRIENDS ARE FOR LEAVING BEHIND  <br>Jitsu was latest episode confirmed it.</br>  <br>If you were expecting some kind of romance with osananajimi on jitsu wa you are deluded.</br>  <br>This is wrong though. It is actually a (very) dark comedy. The irony is in the main character who wishes to get a second chance at his childhood and when he actually gets that chance, he fucks it up even worse than he did the first time. The shows that his life is a wreck because of his own actions, not his circumstances. People like to joke about characters like Tomoko being terrible people but Kazuya really is rotten to the core. It's meant to be funny.</br>  <br>This is true.<br><br>If this is going down the realistic path then Jun will move on to a girl who's not his ideal. Men never get together with ideals, he'll likely get it on with Carol and live ignorantly ever after while Tombo cries into the sky.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=q9_<wbr>enSauFuk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That picture makes me sad. <br><br>Is too early in the morning to feel sad.</br></br></br>  <br> he'll likely get it on with Carol and live ignorantly ever after while Tombo cries into the sky. <br>And where does Misuzu fit into all of this?</br></br>  <br>She gets off on the NTR.</br>  <br><br>She lezzes out with Tomo</br></br>  <br>She gets it on with another guy who's not in the series.<br><br>Shinichiro = Jun<br>Tomo = Noe<br>Hiromi = Carol<br>no chance girl = Misuzu<br>cockroach-kun's bestfriend = Senpai</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm reading Medaka Box right now. There's all these great looking doujins on sad panda that I want to read but they have Kumagawa's screws on the cover. I took a peek at the tags for one of them, it was like a six part series, and NTR was tagged.<br><br>I am genuinely too scared to read them even though the art looks good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I forgot to add the atrocious character art.<br><br>Oh come on, man. You could at least posted the<br> "it's meant to be funny" <br>part. You said it was very dark comedy, yet you posted some edgy page. Why don't you posted the dark comedy one? Unless there isn't any of it, which is exactly like what I said before in here</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's just that fanwank of Kumagawa raping Medaka. Medaka doesn't looks like Medaka at all, so it's all fine to fapped for me.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Gundam-san will get with this guy.</br></br></br></br>      <br>That's 30 pages per month. It's excellent.</br>  <br><br> implying this isn't all a part of Jun's masterplan to convert cotton candy into a tomboy, so Tomo can finally bond with a fellow tomboy </br></br>    <br> it's your birthday <br> your best friend and her crush just hooked up a day before <br> you told her it's the best present you were ever going to get <br> the dining table is set for four people since you even invited that stupid Jun's best friend <br> since you kind of like him <br> no one came <br> clock strikes 12 MN and you sing happy birthday to yourself <br> tears fall as you eat the cake you baked yourself <br>It must be hard being Misuzu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There was only 2 other choices <br><br>A total psychopath <br>A harem ending</br></br></br></br>  <br> 2 other choices  <br>There was the Kaede route, Asa route, Sia route, Nerine route, Primula route (after completing Nerine's route) &amp; the later additions added more.</br></br>  <br> yet you posted some edgy page <br>Are you trying to say that you don't find that ridiculous, over the top expression on his face funny? I think it's hilarious how corrupt he is.</br></br>  <br>No? You could see clearly the artist/author didn't make it over the top funny with his face. It's a blatantly to show the reader how fucked up the MC is. <br><br>No ridiculous/over-the-top-makes-it-fu<wbr>nny intended at all. If they did intend to to that, they would gives some hint on the background to convince the reader that they being ridiculous on purpose. Which is based on what you posted, definitely not.<br><br>That's common sense in story writing stuff. Sorry brother, but I'm afraid I'm right with my post earlier.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Still a little mad that the reporter girl never got a route in the game. She was the second best girl in the entire game.</br>  <br> H-manga <br>That's the only thing that truly matters.</br></br>  <br> If they did intend to to that, they would gives some hint on the background to convince the reader that they being ridiculous on purpose. <br>That would ruin the joke. How many of those meme images do you own by the way?</br></br>  <br> That would ruin the joke. <br>Of course not, that's what separate a real dark comedy with blatant edgy show off.<br><br>And meme? really?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Elfen Lied is edgy. There is a difference.</br>  <br> Elfen Lied is edgy. <br>Yes. What are you trying to say?</br></br>  <br>That there is a difference.</br>    <br>Ok?</br>  Too much derailing in this thread. Post more tomboys.  <br>God, that picture hurts.<br> Thankfully, I never had any friends </br></br>  <br>She has to be getting off to all this.</br>  <br> Luckily tomboys win in H-manga. <br><br>I refuse to belive that. There must be an exception where the tomboy wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Just accept it, Anon. It makes it easier to bear the pain.</br>  <br>Does this count?</br>  <br>I dont understand that tan pattern.<br><br>And in that note</br></br></br>  <br>Competitive swimsuits for triathlons or stuff like that tend to have a bit of an extention to the legs.</br>  <br>wat is the best tan pattern.</br>  <br>Which series got killed?</br>  <br>Shirt and shorts seems more likely.</br>    <br>Wrong image but they're both good I guess.</br>  <br>Just look at her face there, anon, and it answers your own question. She gets wet from it.</br>  <br>She's so cute. I reread the manga and rewatch the anime just for her.</br>  Sometimes childhood friends win...  <br> She gets wet from it. </br>    <br>both Misuzu and Tomo are childhood friends of Jun, Tomo is also a friendzoned Tomboy. Misuzu will win Jun's virgin dick</br>  <br> Misuzu <br> friend <br>just because they knew each other doesn't make them childhood friends</br></br></br>  <br>denial</br>  Misuzu clearly has experience. Is she a total slut behind the scenes?  <br>What, you need to fuck to know bang = having sex?</br>  <br>what if it turns out that Jun and Misuzu had fucked previously and while Jun wanted to pursue a further relationship Misuzu said that she just wanted to experiment and doesn't really see him that way leading to their strained relationship?</br>  <br>It would be fun to watch /a/ burn to the ground because of this reveal</br>    <br>Did the author ever reply to that?</br>  <br>Completely ignored. He won't deal with /a/'s bullshit.</br>  <br>And Misuzu has realized that she has feelings for him but it would be wrong to bring that back up after he finally gotten over her so she's trying to get him together with Tomo?</br>  <br>Nah she just genuinely doesn't care about it and is simply trying to hook up Tomo with him in good (as to what can be done about a dense guy like Jun) spirit.</br>  <br> /a/'s bullshit  <br>???</br></br>  <br>pathetic and hilariously inept attempts to coax reactions from established figures</br>  <br>Na, just joking.<br>He's most likely haven't seen it. I'd imagine he gets tons of tweets, he couldn't read ours.<br><br>You could try and make multiple accounts and tweet him the same image, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would that bother him then?</br>  <br><br>Don't. He will get the mistaken impression that MisuxJun is what people actually want. Don't fuck up the one decent Tomboy manga in existence.</br></br>  <br>Ah, now that I think about it, it most definitely would. Forget the idea.</br>  <br> He will get the mistaken impression that MisuxJun is what people actually want <br> He will get the mistaken impression <br> the mistaken impression <br> mistaken impression <br> mistaken </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you mean mistaken?</br>  <br><br>Don't anger me.</br></br>  <br> That second panel Tomo <br><br>She's just perfect in every frame.</br></br></br>  <br>In Japan you do.</br>  <br>What exactly is her evil plan?</br>  <br> Don't anger me <br>What are you? 12?</br></br>  Reminder that I want to push Misuzu onto a muddy field in the rain and have sex while manhandling her as she insults me.<br><br>Also flicking her forehead at the same time.</br></br>  <br> mistaken <br>Nope, even if it means sacrificing a decent tomboy romantic manga, I find Misuzu more interesting in many ways.</br></br>  <br>seeing the world burn</br>  <br>Tomboys are for slowly distancing yourself from as you mature and want a real girl.</br>  Tomboys are a cute, and for loving tenderly.<br><br> Bleach has them by the bushels. </br></br>  <br>oh HSIT<br><br>Tomo is both a tomboy AND a childhood friend.<br><br>She is either totally fucked or it's a double negative = positive type of situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't Jun's friend come tho</br>  <br>He should fuck his daughter though.... wait didn't he try to do it in the previous life?</br>  I don't see the Jun and Misuzu thing. Like, at all.<br><br>It feels like people just want their NTR fetish kicks when neither is shown to be attracted to the other in any way.</br></br>  <br>I gag a little every time I see head canon shit about Misuzu actually wanting to fuck Jun in their deep dark secret pasts.</br>  <br>Every thread.</br>  <br>What, you've never read a good hate fuck hmanga in your life? <br>Heres a vanilla one:<br>http://exhentai.org/g/670541/370bab<wbr>9adc/<br><br>The NTR in Jun X Misuzu is just implicit simply because Tomo is aiming for Jun, but at its core its about this (hatefucking).</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>also a case where the woman is the one leading in the hate fuck http://exhentai.org/g/500589/0f796a<wbr>4849/ but also turns vanilla towards the half-end</wbr></br>  <br>when you see a Saki picture in a non-Saki thread...</br>  <br> hella </br>  <br>Holy shit, this serie is the worst trainwreck ever, why the fuck did he even do that.</br>  <br>  they would gives some hint on the background to convince the reader that they being ridiculous on purpose. <br><br>I don't think what you referring to ever happened in Franken Fran and it's still obvious as hell it's a comedy.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate all NTR. My fondness for Jun and Misuzu is in spite of the NTR, not because of it.</br>  <br>And where do you want to leave the titular character?</br>  <br>Childhood friends are usually the most annoying characters anyway.</br>  <br>They vary widely.<br><br>They're usually pretty shitty if their sole purpose is to go 'oh no I love MC-Kun so much but didn't realize it until now' and they have 0 personality of any kind other than that but they can also be god-tier if being a childhood friend just happens to be a quality instead of a defining trait.</br></br></br>  <br>Post the full one where theres the girl leaving the boy too and then the two rejects get together faggot</br>  <br> ran around the entire school looking for Jun <br><br>Why is Tomo so cute /a/? Why is she so under appreciated in her own series?</br></br></br>  I really like Cotton, she seems like innocent but confident girl.  <br> confident <br>She's been pretty insecure about Tomo and her "fiance" for the last 20 chapters.</br></br>  <br>So stupid?</br>   Tomo thinks Jun actually likes girly girls <br> next day </br>  <br> Why is she so under appreciated in her own series? <br>Because she's a tomboy.</br></br>  <br> she seems like innocent but confident girl <br>She's just too retarded to be afraid.</br></br>  so how many social retards does it take to make a good comedy, anyways? this one already has at least 3, if not more  <br>Haha. My nickname is Tombo.</br>  <br>That guy is a true masochist who knows what he wants. Good luck, you crazy bastard.</br>  <br>I need him to show back up right after this current arc is done.<br><br>Both because I genuinely want to see him interacting more with Misuzu considering he is a man of absolutely patrician taste and because it will also curtail the NTR posting a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>Is she actually being molested in this page or is it a misunderstanding? If it isn't a misunderstanding why doesn't she want that bald fucker to get his shit pushed in?</br>  <br>She doesn't want him to get arrested for assaulting some dude.</br>  <br>Unfortunate, but acceptable, losses.</br>  <br>because she wanted him to continue molesting her duh, feeling disgusting turned her on</br>  <br>Jun would be arrested instead for assault, especially considering he'd probably beat him half to death if he started with how strong and pissed he is.</br>    <br>You have literally every other series where the tomboy loses. Just let her have this one.</br>  <br>It's just her way of telling Tomo to get her hands off him.</br>  <br>But it would be the word of two people against one. Is this a "denial of crime" type thing that keeps Japan's reported sexual assaults low?</br>    <br>I don't have any other series with a Misuzu winning.</br>  <br><br>She's already won my heart, what more does she want.</br></br>  <br>You don't get to say he fell when he is covered in bruises. Jun would get arrested. They did the right thing.</br>  <br> punching someone that touches your girlfriend's ass gets you arrested in nipland </br>  <br>they call it unreported crime central for a reason</br>  <br>She wants your pain &amp; suffering. She wants dominance &amp; control over you.</br>  <br>It does in almost every country.</br>  <br>It's comedic in the same way Shindol is comedic.</br>  <br>But they did report the crime. Just because you stop a guy from beating the shit out of your assailant doesn't mean he got off free.</br>  <br>I'm not sure about you but I find women getting destroyed by monster cocks really funny.</br>  <br>I do too. It's funny. That's what I'm saying.</br>  <br>She's going to get with that one idiot and they're going to be perfect for each other.<br> implying you don't want to see Misuzu bullying him into submission </br></br>  <br>She doesn't bully people into submission, she says stuff to make people annoyed with her because she enjoys being treated rough.</br>  Author should provide tomos cups size already.<br><br>Misuzus too.</br></br>  <br>C for tomo, A for Misu</br>  <br>Does it matter? It's not like it's going to change how the characters look if he does.</br>  big boobs are moe  <br><br>Boobs don't make the moe, the girl makes the moe.</br></br>  <br>big boob tomboys are moe*</br>  <br>big boob brown tomboys are moe*</br>  <br> big boob genki tomboys wearing sundresses are moe <br>FTFY m8, don't want you to look silly on an anonymous imageboard.</br></br>  <br><br>Because they're cute tomboys, not because of the boobs.</br></br>  <br>They both do karate.
