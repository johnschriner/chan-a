The sculpt for their 1/8 Charlotte looks nice.  <br> moran <br>You first.</br></br>  <br>degenerate get out</br>  <br>you are right this one is better than </br>  <br>Miku is a good choice. Or better yet get a Luka</br>  The Houki Pouki from the same set has two colors.  <br>It's hard not to get at least one.</br>  <br> good Raita <br><br>Oxymoron.</br></br></br>  <br>The sculptor is not the issue<br><br> WAVE </br></br></br>  Aside from this scale which is also 1/8 they posted about danmachi so expect more Hestia.  <br><br>What others are being released</br></br>  <br>Some beach queens are decent.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128780135 <br>Read the guide.</br>  <br>You mean they are not absolutely garbage, yet they are overpriced garbage. They are tiny as fuck, and those prices are ridiculous on top of the shit quality.</br>  <br> being this new </br>  <br>I think that if you play around with mfc filters you can look at miku by addition date.</br>  <br>I only bought the ones I own in the after market cheap as fuck so they were worth it but I do see some are coming out now with quality 1/7 tier prices.<br>The problem with them other than their size obviously is there completely random quality, you can have two girls from the same series produced at the same time and one comes out looking good and the other like complete dog shit.</br></br>  <br> 1/4 luka <br>This will go nicely with miku.</br></br>    <br> acrylic shelves <br>How does this happen?<br><br>Or is it some kind of ever-so-slightly-frosted glass?<br> not sure that would be better or worse </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The price of BQ just rose up before everything else did.<br><br>BQ used to be 4k, when Nendoroid were 3k. Now Nendoroid are like 3.9k and BQ are 5.2k<br>(retail discount costs)<br><br>Really not much different. When 1/7 scales are in the 11k range, 5k BQ aren't really that close in price. It's pretty rare to find a really high quality scale figure in the 8k range these days. Probably the last ultra quality 8k figure you will ever see again is Alter's Mikan. Then you will have to compare 5k BQ to 9k+ scales.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They wouldn't drill screw holes through glass.</br>  <br>Then you forgot to mention the quality of wave figures also took a turn for the worse, unlike pretty much every other manufacturer who got better, at least enough to make the price increase bearable.</br>   some faggot already hotglued this pochaco <br><br>Sucks that my pocha is still in the mail, I wanted to hotglue her first.</br></br>  <br>k</br>  <br>Nope. The Nisekoi BQ are pretty amazing. Chitoge is super nice. Both her and Onodera sold out, got restocked and sold out again.<br><br>Pretty sharp contrast to the Megahouse 5k 1/10th scale figures which shelf warmed for a bit.</br></br></br>  <br>ANd nothing to write home about compared to the bqs that were released just because the price increase. <br><br>Also, doesn't help your point to be comparing them to megahouse statues, they are not even average for today's standards, and the smaller scales are jsut shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Restocks are no measurement of quality, Griffon does plenty of re-releases as well.</br>  <br>That is done all the time, although you are correct in that an assembly like that doesn't make sense for glass plates.</br>    <br> letting the nigger from /gif/ beat you </br>  <br> no new parform. <br>This upsets me.<br><br>Hopefully people buy the shit out of yuudachi on release and realize how nice they are. <br><br>If not at least momohime will be a last chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so bad I wouldn't throw it in the garbage <br>Don't want to insult the fucking bin.</br></br>  <br> Don't want to insult the fucking bin. <br> the fucking bin. <br>Yes because you show it so much respect as is.</br></br></br>  <br>ebin bro</br>  <br>Hotglue where?</br>  <br>They are nice? I will order one then. Thank you for your recommendation, anon. Shigure is getting one too. Pairing them up will be good.</br>  <br><br><br>I honestly like them more than figmas and Nendos. Bigger than nendos, joints don't look hideous like figmas, and they're as cheap as a nendo, really perfect to me.</br></br></br>  <br> joints don't look hideous like figmas <br>Are we looking at the same pictures?</br></br>  <br> joints don't look hideous like figmas <br>Yeah they look worse.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Go shitpost somewhere else.</br></br></br>  <br>Cu-poche's are less cute nendos with joints. And worse quality. The proportions are abysmal.</br>  <br> Posts the character that suffers the most from joints, and has no reason to be a figma in the first place. </br>  sold out at amiami.  <br>Actually I think these two are a better example of that.</br>  <br>No you shitpost elsewhere.</br>  <br>Parform and Cu-poche aren't the same things.</br>  <br><br>How long it took you to find one so covered that it didn't even look like a figma?</br></br>  Stop being faggots.

Just like pic related.</br>  <br>Some of the figures had to have already been planned before the show even aired. She probably won't have any staying power unless there's a second season, unless the LN and manga are super popular.

How fucked up am I? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well please enlighten me</br></br>  <br>No, some idol or something. The figure was announced 2 years ago so who knows if it'll ever be released.</br>    <br>Dolls are cute, dude. Dollfags being autistic enough to use expensive equipment for taking pictures helps, too. I don't have one but I'd like to get one some day.</br>  <br>I don't think I could collect dolls because of the maintenance that goes into them.<br>They can be cute as fuck though.</br></br>    <br>Dolls don't fall under jointshit. For dolls, joints are half the appeal in the first place.<br><br>I'd buy one if they weren't so goddamn expensive.</br></br></br>  Who cu-poche here?    how is a neet suppose too afford this? I wouldn't think they get that much autism dollars.  <br>I regret not getting Dekacchu Wo. Wonder if they'll ever continue the line.</br>  <br>They're pretty cute, but I have no interest in buying them. although I have to say Kuroneko's cu-poche is absolutely adorable and makes me want her.</br>  <br>It isn't even that expensive.</br>  <br>Yeah, they're really cute and I find interesting how well the Madoka Cu-poches combine with the Madoka RAHs</br>     The kokeshi doll that looks like someone is exclusive <br>God fucking damn you GSC!<br> Fuck you.   ;_; </br></br>  <br>I would say they could give nendoroids a run for their money, but I highly doubt they'll take off and get as many licenses and put them out as fast as nendoroids.</br>    <br>What's wrong anon? The GSC Online Shop ships internationally you know.</br>  <br>You've caught my interest.</br>  <br><br>Please, anon. <br><br><br><br><br><br>That's basically the thing that stops me from getting one, they are around 600$~ and is not that I don't have th money, is just that it feels like it's too much just for one thing. That said I'm sure one day I'll give in and get one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They have just begun, I think that they need more time and of course they should make characters from more IPs<br>Some of the characters that they have done by now, doesn't have a nendo counterpart or any aticulated figure at all<br>Like the Dark Magician Girl or the IM@S girls or the Destroyer Div6 girls<br><br><br> according to keikaku.jpg </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just a doll. Older exclusives were better</br>  <br><br><br>Planelegs pls go</br></br></br>  <br>Dispatched so far.</br>  <br> Planelegs <br>You lost me anon</br></br>  <br>Yeah I think it was a good choice to acquire IPs that don't have nendo counterparts to start with to set themselves apart from nendos, although they still have some characters like Aegis and the Oreimo girls that have Nendoroids too.<br>I'd love to see the line take off and give GSC some good healthy competition.</br></br>  <br>I agree with you<br>They even will release the character mascots, which I personally find really cute</br></br>  <br>Whats up with those bases though?</br>  <br><br>I feel you man, if a single dolfie did not cost more than what i earn in a month i would definitely own a couple of them.</br></br>  <br>Do you work part time, or do you just have a shit job?</br>  <br>Whats up with those bases though?<br>These figures have magnets in their feets and the base have a metal plate, so you can make stand on their own without the help of a articulated arm (they come with one anyway for flying poses)</br></br>  <br>third world country.</br>  Anyone have any of the Medicos Jojo figures? I order 2 from HobbySearch and was wondering, do the top and bottom flaps come taped up? My figures boxes look new, except that there aren't any tape on the box openings, and the bottom of one box has a little dent that looks like someone might have opened it. Also another figures foot seems to have been moved slightly to the right. Could that have happened during customs? I live in the US if that matters. Never order from Japan before so I am a bit confused. Don't want to open them and check because I am autistic about shit like this and like my figures sealed.  <br><br>Thrird world m8. My wage is actually in the top 40%.</br></br>  <br>Wow that's actually perfect in my opinion.<br>I always wished figures would do that instead of pegs and claws.<br>Wish all figures used those types, Might consider getting one now just to appreciate that magnet base.</br></br></br>  <br>which one exactly bolibia?</br>  Does anyone know why they aren't up on the ami international site?  <br>JAPAN ONLY<br><br>Elsa was available in HLJ the first time she was in PO, IDK if now will be there for PO</br></br></br>  <br>She is on HLJ but Anna isn't. I could just get her from BiJ or if I want to overpay, CdJp.</br>  <br><br>Argentina. After all the taxes the Dolfie would end up costing around USD 1200, and i earn around 1300 a month.<br><br>Not only we earn shit money, but they rape us with the taxes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Check out all the jointshit in /v/ buyfag threads.</br>  Which one?    <br><br>Right. Could be the photo and angle, but i like her face better.</br></br>  <br>I'm from there too(I earn 21K AR$), also any order above 1000 u$s can only be picked up through a customs broker.</br>  <br>Blue. Highlights her figure better and the blue/white contrast is more interesting.</br>  <br>Some figures really need to come with a yaranaika face.</br>  <br>Though I prefer the expression from the white one.</br>  <br>I've wanted them to make the Cu-poche mascots since they started using them as models for the clothes, but with no accessories or alternate hands and only one face, it's kind of a letdown.</br>  Can't wait to have this figure.  <br><br>The stuff about the broker is only if the original price is over that amount, that means pre customs taxation and does not include the 35% credit card tax. So it'd be safe to order a dolfie.<br><br>There is still the problem of them costing U$$ 1200 for us though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it includes shipping cost, not sure about how much it could be, an 1/4 is around 10K by EMS.</br>   brown hair   <br> but with no accessories or alternate hands and only one face, it's kind of a letdown. <br>Yeah, but they showed this in this past wonfes, maybe they have plans for a alternate faces set like the one made by GSC, At least that is what I think that this image means</br></br>  Found this on Amazon for $22. I say it's worth the price.    <br>i want to cum on this anime girl</br>  <br> Cu-poche Extra <br> Anne mood faces and ponytail set <br> Kirakira, depressed, "Wakya~!" faces <br>Hmm, could be interesting. Still sucks that everything has to be bought separately, yet the base figure costs about as much as other Cu-poches which come with multiple faces and accessories. The mascots seem like they're there to be marketed as mini dolls than anything else.</br></br></br></br>    <br>It's a fucking foldable plastic box that is worth maybe 20 bucks. Not 50 and definitely not 70. Anyone who pays for that is legit retarded.</br>  Guys guys I need your help, I spent the past 2 hours searching for this, used every keyword I can, "任務娘", "任務娘抱き枕カバー<br>", "zero戦", etc. and the closest thing I found was a bootleg on rakuten auctions.

He just does this shit as a hobby. He'd probably survive anyways.</br>  <br>Gills. He has the features of every beast is my guess.</br>  What exactly was your problem with Unlimited Blade Works? Specifically the anime, not the route. I'm a Nasufag in general so maybe I have low standards or something, but it seemed like a 10/10 adaptation for me. Struck all the right notes and even wove in some extra pieces to the route as a whole. But I see a lot of people give it shit. What for?  It combines all 3 routes from the game, and does a terrible job.<br><br>You're doing yourself a disservice by watching unlimited blade works.</br></br>  <br>I've heard this before, but after reading through all three routes and then watching UBW I honestly have no idea where you're getting that from.<br><br>What in the adaptation is combining the other two routes into this one?</br></br></br>  I had no problems whatsoever beyond minor gripes (Archer using hugefuck swords was silly, Shirou was rather too nimble and in the zone when fighting Archer/Gilgamesh when he should have been berserking).<br>On the whole part it was a stellar experience, capturing the spirit of the story with fluid and wonderful animation, so I give it the full 10/10.</br>  It was just disappointing compared to Zero.  <br><br><br> replying to copypasta </br></br></br>  <br>Are you fucking retarded? <br><br>The problem isn't the adaptation. The problem is  Nasu is a pretentious hack . Fuck the Nasuverse, that being said, ufo made a 9/10 adaptation</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>The source material is mediocre at best but Ufo did a good job adapting it.</br></br>  <br>Anon I think you might be stupid. I've never made this thread or a thread remotely like it before. I was asking because the last few times I went into a TM thread the consensus seemed to be people hated UBW, and I wanted to know why since I personally liked it so much.</br>    <br>I don't think there was anything wrong with it beyond really minor nitpicking. It was a fantastic anime, and personally I find it to be one of my favorites in general.</br>  <br>it had to much expostulation of the basics and yet not enough of the main story. hell most people don't even know why archer was there in the end.</br>  <br>They explained why Archer survived about as much as the VN did.</br>  <br>well one assumes he was from the changed future and thus lived longer or something. point of an adaptation is to fix such stuff</br>  <br>No, the canon thing is that he just tanked Gil and managed to live a little bit longer.<br><br>The anime changed things a bit by not having him project Rho Aias to protect Shirou, and shooting less arrows to help Rin, to make him seem less ridiculous.</br></br></br>  <br>The anime is about as good as you could hope for as an adaptation. Intrinsic problems with the source material prevent it from being a 10/10 or anything but it is a good shounen anime.</br>  Too much repetitive dialogue<br><br>Not enough weaboo fightan magic!</br></br>  <br> Shounen <br><br>The adaption was 10/10. Only autists will tell you otherwise. As for the route itself it does have a few issues but most people really liked it.</br></br></br>  It's popular. That's all.  <br>wasted opportunities, the last fight especially.<br><br>They passed on a time to go crazy with animation of weapons throughout history, they c/p'ed the same 5 swords over and over again.</br></br></br>  <br>How is the narrative dissimilar to shounen battle manga?</br>  <br>Shounen is not a genre. It's a demographic. No version of FSN fits that demo.</br>  <br>I'm aware of that, but usually when you say "shounen" on /a/ it has an understood meaning of "stories that would run in a shounen manga magazine typically centered around fighting". If you cut the ero content of UBW I don't see how it dosen't fit this description.</br>  <br>Well that's not really the correct way to define it. Lots of different shit can be shounen.</br>  <br>It isn't. It is a straight up battle shounen.</br>  <br>No it doesn't, you will almost always get called out for calling it shounen instead of battle shounen specifically, even if people know what you meant.</br>  <br>Pacing in the second cour and lack of Shirou's inner monologue in the first cour.<br><br>The first half of the first cour was too stretched out. UBW could easily have been 16-17 episodes and have good pacing. Good pacing would make the Shirou vs Archer fight more climatic as well.<br><br>There's also the lack of Medea's mythological backstory. <br><br>It's not a very bad adaptation but not a great one either. <br><br>Those two points that I raise are the biggest issue. There are other aspects I think the VN did a better job, like the Gil vs Shirou fight by not making Shirou do acrobatics and not making Shirou retreat. But these are not so bad changes. The Shirou vs Archer fight being in UBW isn't such a bad thing either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because there were many episodes in which the pacing was slow or just downright boring.<br><br>The source material was shit to begin with, Ufo can only do so much to make shit look good.</br></br></br>  <br> lack of Shirou's inner monologue <br>But this is what made Shirou so much better in the anime.<br><br>He looks more closer to the concept of a withdrawn, socially awkward kid with PSTD when you can't read his thoughts, rather than have him bitch and whine about everything he doesn't agree with like in the VN and be overall insufferable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is no problem with UBW, anybody who has a problem will get BTFO so just /thread.</br>  Poor directing. Say what you want about Nasu's writing, but he's great at setting up atmosphere, OST also had those few tracks that made great scenes even better. <br>Anime adaptation on the other hand was soulless, devoid of any emotion or interesting ideas to make transition from one medium to another more smooth. On the opposite, some of the changes actually made scenes worse, like that Illiya flashback with all the magic mambo jumbo no one needed to know, that dragged the episode and watered down one of the best scenes from VN. Or removing the H from H-scene, while leaving dialog and tension like they're gonna be fucking now, which made no sense, making the scene really awkward and too long for no reason, other than faithfulness for the sake of faithfulness.<br>The action scenes also lacked any tension. Shirou seems invincible in the adaptation, he's never shown struggling during fights, since every time there's always a plot device waiting to save him. VN handles that by giving you inner monologue that shows just how much pain he feels during even the simplest of projection and bad ends that actually induce the sense of danger. Anime decided to just make scenes as flashy as possible, with ridiculous ninjaflips and giant swords. But even though they went with visual stimulation rather than emotional, action scenes still ended up mediocre and unmemorable due to poor choreography.<br>The OST was also pretty much nonexistent and art from time to time was just ugly. Except Rin, she was ugly every time.<br>This whole adaptation just made me like UBW much less and when I first read VN it was actually my favorite route. So thanks Miura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a faithful adaption of garbage source material. Aside from that, I don't care much for the visuals, the music, or the editing.</br>  Which SCP would you fug.  682 and 173  Adding 166 as well.<br><br>But anyone would fug her.</br></br>  This would be the fucking cool but then I remember all the fucking scary SCP there are.  Can you fuck a box of pizza?<br>Because 458 is best SCP.</br>  <br>173 is damn scary.<br><br>And disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>As someone whose favorite pizza place closed down several years ago, I wholeheartedly agree.</br>  <br>Fuck, why cant that be real?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-458<br><br>Also, SCP anime would be great.</br></br></br></br></br>   You will never carry out Procedure 110-Montauk   I would Candy. 1548 will me along with the rest of the human race.  105 of course  I wrote the original, and yes I wish it were not so shit.   <br>You know, SCP-166 could be used as a way to determine if the universe considers trannies to still be male depending on whether or not they react to her.</br>  Why dont they just give 682 a picture of 096's face and let them kill each other?  <br>Because it would probably end up just like when they tried to use 173 to kill him.</br>  <br>What happened?</br>  <br>It's been a while since I read the log, but I believe 173 got driven into a corner, and 682 grew a few dozen extra eyes, then made them bulletproof when the researchers tried to shoot them out.</br>  <br>http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--<wbr>files/scp-682/682.mp3<br><br>Because 682 just won't fucking die. They tried crystallizing the damn thing and it didn't work.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br><br>But could 096 actually have died to either 173 and 682?<br><br>Because I think that 096 is actually one of the worst SCPs, especially because of all the photos that were spread around it in the world without people realizing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>would be a great idea.</br>  <br>If they really wanted to terminate 096, then I'm sure they would have done it by now.</br>  <br>076 vs 682 or 096<br>what happens?</br></br>  <br>/a/ would be the perfect recruiting ground.</br>  <br>Shit you wrote 105? That's one of the most recognizable ones now.</br>  <br>to be honest I like to concept, but looking back now I don't like the execution. I've asked some of the writers still around for a rewrite but they said people wouldn't be happy if they did.</br>  I stopped following this because there was a giant amount of shitty SCPs when it started getting more well known. Has there been any big developments in lore or anything lately?  <br>This. I remember following it about 3, maybe, years ago, but stopping because the influx of new users due to the game (Which was actually cool, it was pretty fun) and it was hard to filter out the shit.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128731007 <br>The author is adamant that it is not rape, and is much worse than rape.</br>  <br>What could it be?<br>Slowly cutting her, or taking her organs out and dancing on them or something like that?</br></br>  <br>Probably the more painful kinds of torture. Drilling into the bones, small repeated acid baths, things like that?<br>Nothing is scarier, as it were. It's never going to be explained clearly.</br></br>  <br>It's hard imagining something worse than rape that won't leave any permanent damage and that you can keep doing week after week for years.</br>  <br>"Permanent" damage has a different meaning when you have all the sciencemagic in the world including a reusable regenerative pendant.</br>  <br>Seconded</br>  <br> 076 vs 682 <br>Ended up with 076 having 60% of it's body destroyed<br><br> 682 vs 096 <br>Dunno, 682 would probaly win.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>why is 682 so strong?</br>  SCP-999 if it turns into a slime-girl.  <br>682 was also completely fucked up after the fight<br><br> why is 682 so strong? <br> Bad writing. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't mean it can't include rape.</br>  <br>Plot armor. Any number of SCPs should have completely removed it from existence already.</br>  <br>Because it's virtually indestructible. It's normally kept suspended in a cell flooded with acid. They tried to crystallize it, which was painful but ultimately not lethal. On top of that, it's just very strong and can grow stronger from eating.</br>  <br>Then they probably torture her until she is nearly dead and then heal her afterwards.</br>  <br>Nah, the joke of 999 is that he looks like an abomination but everyone finds him cute.</br>  Reading the SCP-231 article makes me feel like shit.  <br>That much is obvious. The question is, what kinds of torture?</br>  <br><br> All persons within the wave’s range collapse into crippling fits of laughter, allowing SCP-682 to escape and slaughter all in its path. Meanwhile, SCP-999 quickly rescues as many persons as it can, taking them to a safe place to recover from SCP-682’s "laughter wave" while agents suppress and recontain SCP-682. <br><br>Holy shit, SCP-999 is such a bro.<br><br>I really like SCPs that aren't unimaginable horrors, they get boring after a while. I like the camera one where it takes a picture of your truest desire and the other machine that gives you any kind of drink you want.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bookkeeper SCP is the best.</br>  <br>076 is just a really strong guy with respawn hax.</br>  <br>My favorite is the clockwork one that modifies stuff based on the input.<br>It's the coolest shit.</br></br>  <br>Stupid regeneration that breaks physics.</br>  <br>Same thing, to this day i still wanna know what happens if you put a monkey/human on it, the parts with it were all [REDACTED] or censored.</br>  <br>I like the experiment logs of that one and the greenish sponge sphere.</br>  <br>what number is that?</br>    <br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1230<br><br>Nicest SCP ever.</br></br></br>  <br>I want SCP-1230 to be my husbando. I'm gay for a magic book.</br>  <br>Yeah, that guy is boss as hell.</br>     http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-076 <br> SCP-076-2 resembles a lean Semitic human male in his late twenties. Hair is black, and eyes are gray, skin tone olive. Subject is 1.96 m in height and 81.65 kg in weight. Numerous tattoos depicting arcane and occult iconography are present all over the body (mostly in the form of leering demonic faces) and ranges from subtle to openly ostentatious. Subject, when encased inside SCP-076-1, is technically dead. <br>  <br> SCP-076-2's most unusual ability, however, is its ability to apparently materialize bladed weapons out of nowhere. Slow-motion video footage reveals that the blades in question are actually pulled from a miniature dimensional rift described as a "small hole in space." Where this portal leads is unknown, as is how SCP-076-2 is capable of generating said rifts. Footage of the blades in question shows them to be made out of a completely non-reflective black material appearing as a "black void in space." As the blades rapidly vanish after leaving the subject's possession, no structural analysis is possible at this time.<br>Wait a second, isn't this just Gilgamesh+Avenger?</br></br></br></br>  ID on all?<br><br>Gelbooru still is incomplete with that.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, he's basically Gil, but more hax.<br><br>He's actually Abel or Cain, cant remember.<br><br>Also, most SCPs are capable killing Servants.</br></br></br></br></br>  And why was 953 suppossed to be deadly or scary again?<br><br>She's basically a 2hu</br></br>  <br>Just finished reading the article<br>If only there were people so nice in real life</br></br>  Boy their shithole really went to hell. From what I see now anyone who has been around the longest now exists within a huge circle-jerk which is padded by "fans" and they have this whole group peer pressure shit going on to keep their crappy OC in while booting out any dissenters. <br><br>What's more is they have a monopoly on the entire thing by making it incredibly iconic. I remember back when the logo was half a cat, it being somewhat of a mascot. Where's the cat? <br>Now the place is fanfiction.net-tier garbage and nobody can reclaim its once former quality because if anyone were to create anything similar they'd be seen as a shoddy rip-off by their shitty subcommunity that has never watched the Friday the Thirteenth series. <br><br>Get out, /v/ermin.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Less hax. Mary sue awesome swords, not bullshit plot hack macguffins that can do anything that he needs at the moment.</br>  man what would be /x/ and  /lit/ 's reaction to this?  <br>How did Japan even know about SCP?<br><br>there's quite a bit of art on pixiv as well.</br></br></br>  <br>SCP was created in /x/<br>/lit/ would have your average reaction, some are good, other not.</br></br>  <br>http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/</br>  <br>Youkai are all deadly and scary. The Foundation would have a hell of a time rounding up Gensokyo.</br>  <br>/x/ has long since disowned SCP; go there and ask right now. As welcoming as they are of shitposting you'll be surprised at how quickly they'll tell you to shut the fuck up and leave.</br>    <br>SCP is pretty creepy though, anyone on japan with too much free time will discover SCPs.</br>  <br>results:<br><br><br>2hus cant be contained.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I only recognize 073, 076, 096, 105, 173, and 682.

My favorite is doctor bright's things he's not allowed to do</br></br></br>  <br>That's the fate of any community that got too successful/popular for its own damn good.</br>  So 073 and 076 are ancient astronauts or something?  Which one is the little girl that telepathically compels people to rape her?  <br>I thought that was from the Monster Girl Encyclopedia thing</br>  #11-18.  <br>191 is carrying the calculator and digital camera.</br>  They need to purge every humanoid SCP and animal SCP. The ratio of shitty ones to good ones is too high to justify. <br>Of course it will never happen because 90% of them are written by esteemed members of the community's hierarchy.</br>  <br> The camera that photographs your truest desire <br><br> Subject: SCP-173 <br> Photographed Activity: Standing in its container. <br> Photo Result: No change. <br><br>Either it's not truly sentient or  it's exactly where it wants to be.

They're emotionally torturing her.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not torture if it's for science</br>  <br>it's not rape if she can't remember</br>  <br>Then why do the doctors assigned to SCP 231-7 commit sudoku as result of merely witnessing the procedure.</br>  Is there a loli SCP?<br>Can't remember.</br>  <br>The scientific data is just too much for them to handle.</br>  <br>It'd clearly have to be much worse than rape to induce that.</br>  <br><br>I love the friendly SCPs.

(setting: 1:1) <br><br> Output: Male Hispanic, 42 years old, 100kg, 188cm tall. Subject was very confused and agitated. Subject attacked security personnel. Subject terminated. <br><br>Hahaha that poor fucker. No one should have to die a mexican. I thought this SCP improved things.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 1:1 <br> improve things </br></br>  That book that absorbs blood and keeps re-writing the past is so fucking creepy.  Is there an SCP ona hole?  <br>There's a dildo that causes you to melt from pleasure</br>  <br>Literally melt?<br>Why are the object SCPs so dangerous and confusing?</br></br>  <br>Not all of them are dangerous, but their confusing nature is what makes them require SCP. They are objects that cannot be explained though conventional means.</br>  <br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-297<br> When turned to the highest intensity setting (labeled "suicide"), SCP-297's vibration frequency swiftly increases to upwards of 200,000 kHz. If the upper portion of the device is touched to any solid material, SCP-297 will change frequency to one that causes a positive harmonic feedback loop in the object, causing the object to lose cohesion within sixty seconds of continual contact. This invariably kills organisms that it is exposed to. </br></br>  <br>Because all the other objects go to warehouse 13.</br>  <br> 108kg, 185cm tall to 100kg, 188cm tall <br> not an improvement <br>when will you learn</br></br></br>  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1478<br><br>These cactus are fucking assholes holy shit.</br></br>  There's a yotsuba doujin that have a SCP twist in it. Check it on sadpanda.  <br> Why are the object SCPs so dangerous and confusing? <br>Because "SCP" means "Secure. Contain. Protect."<br>The story is about securing and containing things, and to a limited extent protecting things.<br>If it's not dangerous or confusing, why the hell would it be there? Things that are both safe and nominal are not SCPs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Because "SCP" means "Secure. Contain. Protect." <br>SCP actually stands for "Special Containment Procedures," which is what the Foundation creates to contain the anomalous objects.</br></br>  <br>That's a bit of chicken and egg, isn't it? It's both.</br>  <br> If it's not dangerous or confusing, why the hell would it be there? <br>So the Foundation can protect it from abuse by other people. Can you imagine the pizza box exposed to the world? That would crash the existing pizza economies, if not the entire food industry. It creates matter from nothing.</br></br>  I didn't know stuff like this existed  http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-348<br><br><br> Subject: 6-year-old male, recently injured self while playing with friends (minor scrapes and scratches) <br> Brief Background: Parents divorced, currently lives with mother <br> Notes: Message appeared, I’m sorry, son. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn.</br>  <br>Iris was lucky to be transferred out by the time 076 went bananas again.</br>  <br> didn't know she was 2D <br> they went to ridiculous extremes to keep her from finding out <br> found out by accident <br> now showing symptoms of clinical depression <br>Fuck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminds me of that comic strip where an artist draws a generic loli and draws himself asking her what she wants, and she replies "I want to be real," with a smile on her face. And then he kills himself with a shot through the head.</br></br>  <br>That's a confusing item. You've violated the proposition.</br>  <br><br>Idea is basically if it survives it, it becomes immune to it which is why they don't use the last resort options right off the bat, like nuking it or sending it off into a black hole or some shit. Every time it escapes, they have to device a new powerful method to incapacitate it. <br><br>Also, bad writing and it becoming a meme that even the admins got fucking tired of. 682 was fun at first, but now it's overblown.</br></br></br></br>  /a/, would you work at the SCP Foundation if given the chance?  <br>No because I like being alive and not insane.</br>  <br>Depends on the facility. I don't want to be be anywhere NEAR anything Keter or Euclid.</br>  <br>Would it be possible to clone 682 and have the two of them kill each other?</br>  SCP-085 is my waifu. <br>Best part is, she's 2D, which automatically makes her perfect, and if I dropped her into a manga, it's even better.</br>  <br>There are a fair many Euclid objects that are fairly innocuous, and a few Keter objects that are extremely predictable, and only pose a threat outside containment.</br>  <br>As some nameless mook?<br>Fuck that.</br></br>  <br>No.<br>One of the two 682s overpowers the other and eats it, becoming more powerful than ever.</br></br>  <br>No thank you. I'm in desperate need of a job. But not THAT desperate.</br>  <br>I used Cabin in the Woods as a reference to describe SCP to people. <br>It just sucks that a lot of people haven't see this movie. It's an interesting blend of comedy and horror.</br></br>  <br>No. There's always a chance that you'll encounter a SCP that has unknown effects that will fuck you up.</br>  <br>682 kinda reminds me of Primate Murder from the Nasuverse, except I guess 682's preferences are more varied.</br>  <br>That movie was one of the highlights of the year for me.</br>  <br> warehouse 13 <br>Fun show, but could do with better cast and better writers.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if I was a fucking superhero on a good salary. Those poor grunts at SCP are literally stormtroopers in SWAT gear.</br>  <br><br>Is the movie scary at all? I wanna watch it but I am horrible with jumpscares and tense moments.</br></br>  <br>Definitely, but I'm a fan of shows that have ordinary objects do strange and creative things so it was watchable.<br>Lost Room is one case of doing it very well. Shame it died so early.</br></br>  <br>The movie starts off in a way where you know its going to be a parody (somewhat). Its has more of a monster movie feel than an actual "scary" feeling. It just takes a 180 halfway through and goes full pic related. It's pretty great if you ask me.</br>  <br>Just watch it. It's better to go into it as unspoiled as possible.</br>  And of FUCKING COURSE THAT I'D SPEND 3 HOURS LOOKING AT SCP LINKS, AGAIN, BECAUSE OF THIS THREAD<br>FUCK YOU /a/</br>  <br>So true. Both the game and the users it draws in are shit.<br><br>Series 3 are mostly pretty good. Not on the hub yet, but there's a new canon which introduces Sarkicism, basically a sorcery cult and the Flesh (has ties with SCP-610, so you know how that goes) that the Church of the Broken God actively opposes. Really wellwritten and captivating, especially if you are into occult shit like me. Other canons in the hub seems to have gotten a lot bigger, but I've only started reading the wiki again recently, and not checked all of them out yet. Anyway, links: http://www.scp-wiki.net/metaphysici<wbr>an http://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/meta<wbr>physician (the lowest part with "SITRA ACHRA" as the first tab)</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> You will never be a badass agent like Lombardi. <br> You will never be a badass driver like Dr. Gerald. </br></br>  the scp that's basically just a tape of a basketball game is one of my favourites. the concept seems so fucking stupid at first than quickly becomes fucking terrifying.<br><br>imagine being one of those poor digital copies with no way to escape your current situation. <br><br>anyway speaking of scp, I remember when i read it a while back some fucking cocksucker was busy editing some of the articles so that his faggy ass professor/doctor donut steel character showed up in it. is he still doing that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Who was that guy? The name of that character, I mean.</br>  <br>166</br>  <br>I would immediately kill myself if I found out I lived in a world like that.</br>  <br>Don't worry, there's probably something that will make you kill yourself for you.</br>  <br>What if you are the SCP item and 4chan is the mean of quarantining you?</br>  <br>Once I reach page 10 I be free</br>  <br>1733, right? I'm a sucker for loopy-type skips, but SCP-1733 and SCP-176 dwarf all the others. 1733 for its fantastic concept, 176 for the awesome tales asscociated with it.</br>  <br> every humanoid SCP and animal SCP <br>Quite the sweeping generalization you've got there.<br><br> Of course it will never happen <br>It will never happen because there are enough votes from various fags to keep shitty articles from being deleted, authors notwithstanding. I suggest picking good scps from this site<br>http://scp-nala.wikidot.com/statist<wbr>ics:split-ratings</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But then you saw another thread that interest you and the cycle continues.</br>  <br><br>... You do know that's D territory right?<br><br>You just said "You'll never act out an atrocious crime against decency, nature, empathy, another sentient being and yourself, then be promptly liquidated for the next batch of expendables."</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In a heartbeat.<br><br>I've got a bit of a martyr complex; I'm the exact kind of guy they wish they could have there.<br><br>I'd probably meet a bad end.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine that gives you any kind of drink you want. <br>Share and enjoy!</br></br>  <br>A cup of Joe, anyone?</br>  <br><br>The vending machines a favorite. Treats ranged from delightful and quirky to deadly and terrifyingly sickening.</br></br>  <br>SCP 040</br>  <br> Also, SCP anime would be great. <br>I agree.<br><br>Warehouse 13 sort of has a similar premise. Agents work to locate and secure artifacts that do weird things and are too dangerous to leave out and about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, knowing it'll end terribly like the movie doesn't sit well.</br>  <br>which movie?</br>  <br>The SCP movie, duh.</br>  <br>The Cabin in the Woods</br>  862 is actually pretty nice.  <br>862 is a safe class, of course it's nice.</br>  <br><br>I dropped it when the foundation killed the man-of-war. He was a fucking bro and they killed him because they're assholes like that.</br></br>  <br>The only reason I would be nervous about an SCP anime is because the cynic in me knows that they'd focus primarily on the humanoid SCPs and have them as the main characters.<br><br>If you're gonna make an SCP anime, it should be almost like a slice of life anime, with a different plot each episode, from the viewpoint of the D-class, taskforce soldiers, researchers, and RARELY an SCP. Also, the only recurring characters should be the shadowy 05 that you see maybe once every other episode.<br><br> And then have a major plot arc where everything goes to shit and they have to detonate the on-site nuke. </br></br></br></br></br>  I hate that everyone and their mother is expendable trash.<br><br>The foundation has their heads stuck so far up their ass that they are directly causing global warming because of their misplaced sense of duty.<br><br>They're removing everything that's fun and interesting about the world and are even hoarding beneficial items by outright robbing the original owners.<br><br>Fuck them and their glorified mafia organization.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this :_;</br>  <br>who is this man-of-war?</br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/yUpbOliTHJY?t=7s  [ ]</br>  <br>Ah, but that's part of the fun. The SCP foundation is only concerned with preserving the well-being of the human race, at any cost.<br><br>Which is worse: Global warming, or a pot that spawns a never-ending army of monsters?<br><br>I like the SCP foundation because it's the extreme version of "To be good, sometimes you must be evil."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's one of the scp's. It's a guy that has his fighting skills increase exponentially the better the weapon he is using.<br><br>A pocket knife is enough for him to fight an android on equal terms.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least they are not GOC. Fuckers destroy anything they deem anomalous.</br>  <br><br>Meh, I was never fond of fucked up systems and societies. I'm pretty sure that way of thinking is going to bite them in the ass in the long run.</br></br>  <br>Ohhhh, that mary sue? Didn't they make him kill himself by  giving him an SCP sword that makes you a horrible fighter and he accidentally cut his own head off with it ?<br><br>I'm glad he's gone.</br></br></br>  <br>682</br>  <br> GOC <br><br>What's that?</br></br></br>  <br>Welp. No wonder he got wiped, the wiki doesn't take kindly to superhero-like character, and that's not saying much.</br>  <br>What's the alternative? Let those eldrith abomination bite humanity in the short run?</br>  MOOOOMMMMM the chuunis got out of their containment board!  <br>Global Occult Coalition<br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/goc-hub-pag<wbr>e (read the "About" tab)</wbr></br></br>  <br>The Global Occult Coalition<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/groups-of-i<wbr>nterest#toc8<br><br>Imagine the SCP foundation, but instead of containing things, they try to kill them.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br><br>They've been living with/harassing humanity for thousands of years. The foundation is probably stifling human evolution by trying to contain them.<br><br>I say let the world have fun and interesting things once more.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's just a "lesser of two devils" thing. The Foundation is cold, not cruel.</br></br></br>  <br>They did nothing wrong. Abominations of nature should be purged.</br>  Fuck I read that as the Spurs Celtics Pistons broship.<br><br>Fuck /nba/. Just, fuck it.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure that you're post is the precisly the point behind some SCPs. Quite a few of them call into question whether or not the Foundation is actually doing the right thing.<br><br>That being said, there are definitely some SCPs that NEED to be locked away. Some are so powerful that they would destroy humanity with no chance of survival. Most Keter class objects come to mind. From there it becomes a slippery slope. How can you tell what SCPs can be let go and which have to be contained? These objects are so mysterious that you can't really measure their abilities to use as a basis for judgment.</br></br></br>  <br>Is 096 the humanoid who kills people who see its face?<br>They tried it already.<br><br>Because he has absolute plot armor.<br>They put him in a place where they fucked with the laws of physics in ways that they didn't even understand and it didn't work.<br>They put him in a story-made-real with an entity created with the explicit ability and desire to kill him, and it didn't work.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's ridiculous how some virtually invincible SCP's would willingly surrender themselves to the foundation and let themselves be locked-up indefinitely.  <br> Implying eldritch abominations are the only things anomalous in the foundationverse <br>There are plenty Safe scp object that do absolutely no harm to others. SCP-1609 is a chair that teleports to people in need of a seat, until they put it in a woodchipper, which turns it into a pile of splinters that teleport into people's lungs.</br></br>  <br>I can't think of a skip that fits your description, except SCP-343.</br>  GUYS GUYS. How do we  contain  Accelerator?  <br>That's because it's implied the ones running the organisation are not necessarily human, nor even of that world. Also quite likely the majority of the staff are under the effects of one or more SCPs without their knowledge.</br>  <br>Also the people taking part in it don't remember it either.</br>  <br> SCP-1609 is a chair that teleports to people in need of a seat, until they put it in a woodchipper, which turns it into a pile of splinters that teleport into people's lungs. <br>Oh my fuck.</br></br>  <br>Well, they have a girl who can warp reality by thinking about it contained by simply keeping her unconscious 24/7, so I'm sure they'd figure something out. Maybe try to get an undercover agent to spike his drink?</br>  I'd waifu the girl that secretes slime/acid through her akin, had to be taught English by the foundation, and eats by absorbing things like frogs through her skin.<br>Just need a full body condom.</br>  Why don't they just write "SCP-582 killed SCP-682"?  <br>It's certainly not an easy task. They may be forced to use an scp to contain him. Something mind-affecting could work, perhaps?</br>  <br>Why don't they just write "SCP-682 got tired of its bullshit and killed itself"?</br>  <br><br>This is why i don't like it when the Foundation (or rather the writers behind it) test SCPs with other SCPs. 682 works much better by itself, where it can truly be the ever adapting, impossible to kill crocodile. But once you start using other SCPs on it, the "hard to kill" becomes "easy to kill". Because lets face it, there's plenty of SCPs that could kill 682. like that one test with the bookend SCP. That should have worked. the only reason it didn't is because "no he's unkillable no matter what!"</br></br>  <br>The fight with the Korean esper girl was even more of a brown note. She was tearing it apart and then just fucking stopped. Or when God had a look at it and said it wasn't for him to fix.</br>  <br> 2015 <br> Still finding way to kill 682 <br>The consensus is SCP-682 will live, no matter how much of an asspull his method to survive is.<br>Asking "Wouldn't X kill 682?" has been a way to piss off users for like 4 years now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the consensus is that 682 is dead.<br>At least that's MY consensus.<br>God damn I really hate how prideful the users are on that website.</br></br></br>  Why deploy a tactical warhead in 076's containment if he can apparently be managed with just an explosive collar? Seriously, it seems like extreme overkill for no good reason.  <br> Also, SCP anime would be great. <br><br>By which studio?</br></br></br>  <br>KyoAni</br>  <br>That will be just borfest.<br>Let Shinbo direct it.</br></br>  <br>Here's a better idea. Rather than have a huge, complex containment site for him, why not just have his spawn point surrounded by industrial strength flamethrowers or some shit? Have them be weight sensitive so as soon as he spawns he gets roasted.</br>  <br>As an anthology series. Keter class type of cases by Madhouse, Bones,  Sunrise , the more subdued/ surreal ones by Shaft, safe, SoL by KyoAni.<br><br>Each episode will have Wakamoto as a Rod Serling type of open narration.</br></br></br>  <br>It's my headcannon that SCP-682 was created by some other reality-warping SCP and isn't actually just some strange mutant lizard.</br>  <br>Or they could just keep him sedated and restrained.</br>  <br>They could just flood his containment chamber with acid, like they did for 682. Even if he managed to swim to a wall and punch through a meter or two of reinforced steel even when submerged, he'd probably be halfway to looking like soup by the time he got out.</br>  <br>For quite some time they dont do cross-tests anymore, or rather discourage it.</br>  <br>Anything working under rules similar to Cendrillon's slipper curse in NT3 made him doubt his ability, so chances are that will work.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's how they are able to keep a relatively high quality in their site, instead of letting it devolves into "put your generic x-men, mary sues and other shitty self-inserts here" writing site. Many people see that as needlessly harsh and unwelcoming, but I think it's a pretty good thing.</br>  <br>True. The present scpwiki is very different from the old one, which sadly is still the foundation's image in the eyes of most people.</br>   put SCP-053 together with SCP-682 and leave them alone <br>Done. No more need to worry about how to kill the immortal scaly bastard.</br>  <br> Quite a few of them call into question whether or not the Foundation is actually doing the right thing. <br><br>Good thing about that ethics committee.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9Z0<wbr>YMJUaNrw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Terrific tale voiced by terrific guy.</br>  <br>I'm also fond of the UIU orientation, it's great at framing the various groups in the setting.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=pmF<wbr>sI5eKvsw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>She stopped because she can never fully accomplish a task, and 682 asked her to kill it.</br>  Does ANYBODY know the original context behind this picture?  <br>I thought it was just subway/bridge graffiti art.</br>  <br>http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-series-j<wbr>p#001<br>Can anyone here read moonrunes, and tell which of the original Japanese SCPs do not steal is worthy of note?</br></wbr></br>  <br>I wanna see if they compare</br>  The short work contest produces some pretty cool shit. Format screws are my favorite.<br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2521</br>  I have a question:<br><br>Just what is SCP-001?</br></br>  <br>No one knows for sure. There are at least three options.</br>  <br>That fucker scares me like nothing else.</br>  <br><br>13, to be exact. There's also the possibility of them all being red herrings.</br></br>  <br>At least we know it came from /x/.</br>  <br>There are several possibilities<br>I'm partial to the Seraphim</br></br>  So is the game any good? This is important.  <br>They made a Keter SCP into an idol as her containment procedure.</br>  <br>Play and see for yourself. It's free.<br><br>I can see its appeal and the dev did a pretty good job, but it's still shit to me, like most horror games nowadays</br></br></br>  <br>As expected of Japan.<br><br>I'd think they would put most of their pop culture as SCPs, so I'd bet they have an SCP about a ghost girl in a videotape.</br></br></br>  This is how endless eight should have ended.<br><br>Prove me wrong.</br></br>  <br>FUUUCK<br>That SCP still fucks me up<br>One of the creepiest ones for me simply because of the images.</br></br></br>  Is it just me, or is this fanfiction-tier bullshit?<br><br>http://www.scp-wiki.net/incident-23<wbr>9-b-clef-kondraki</wbr></br></br>  Who /1004/ here?  <br>Everybody is.</br>  <br>Clef is the shittiest, yes.</br>  <br>Those 'incident' stories were made in a time of SCP history when really shitty SCPs would have stories written around them on how they got 'decmomissioned', usually involving some over-the-top story which was fun to read, like Duke 'Till Dawn. As SCP grew in popularity, shitty SCPs grew in number an the staff couldn't keep up with writing decommission stories. And the members were basically cheering for things to get D'd, each story being more over-the-top than the other. At some point the staff realized they were becoming just like 'them', and they stopped writing D-stories altogether.<br><br>Clef became the way he is now thanks to all these stories, so he ended up being a Lethal Weapon-kind of character. Most Mary/Gary Stu self-insert researcher personas are frowned upon, although since Clef is a part of the past, most people kind of let it slide.</br></br></br>   OP pic is from DeviantArt, drawn by an American <br> SCP is completely unrelated to anime in any way <br> thread has been up for 20+ hours </br></br>  <br>Neither is your picture.</br>  <br> bumping <br><br>You could've just let it die.</br></br></br>  <br><br>http://ja.scp-wiki.net/scp-010-jp<br>This one is pretty good, basically it's a USB stick that lets users see the future.</br></br></br>  <br> hurr durr I'm so fucking retarded holy shit hurr durrrrrrr </br>  <br> she still keeps bumping the thread she doesn't like </br>  <br>So they let themselves get overrun by fanfiction trash? Seems normal enough for something that gets popular.<br><br>While I think the concept's good in a lot of ways, after a while, it starts to get stale. I've never seen anything unique apart from the older ones. Heck, most SCPs seem to come straight from anime. They even have plot armor and all that shit. Maybe that's why this thread was made.</br></br></br>  <br> she <br> That's the point anon, bumping this thread was part of my keikaku </br></br>  <br>Actually, the content regulation there does a good job of keeping the fanfics away, at some point they cleansed their archives using new standards and guidelines, easily deleting more than 50% of all their articles. Stuff like DINOSAUR THAT IS A GIANT AS THE UNIVERSE BUT WE CAN'T SEE IT won't last longer than two days when it gets downvoted into oblivion, and the people there actually do leave some helpful reviews on your SCP, even though everyone knows it's fully retarded, but they gotta keep the criticism constructive.<br>Maybe you're just looking at the Top Rated pages for SCPs, so newer ones won't have as much upvotes as articles that have been there for around 4 years, but there's still some good ones among them.<br><br> plot armor <br>The only plot armor SCPs I can think of are 682 and Kain, and those two are like the established 'power ceiling' of all SCPs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kain <br>Don't you mean Abel?</br></br>  <br>Not 343?</br>  <br>Yeah, I keep confusing those two<br><br><br>I rather meant the power ceiling as in: 'invincinble alien that can grow blades', as if it were an anime character.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are good ones, but they're far and few in between. Most are bad, especially the SCPs made from other SCPs. It's a good thing they had to delete those.<br><br><br>What about 105? She seems pretty hax.

I never intended for this to happen. I just wanted to make people happy.” <br>I want to protect it.</br></br>  <br>I'm no good at reading these, why do they need to keep doing that thing and keep SCP-231 alive?</br>  <br>otherwise Satan will be born</br>  <br>It's implied that the world would end.

Make it more special add random anime guests and what they would drink and or type what they want into the machine. Like serious what would Dio do?  <br>Not quite an anime, but UCAT in Owari no Chronicle reminds me a bit about SCP. It's on baka-tsuki.</br>  <br>Someone did a story on that. I think they became friends as in they hate everything else and will kill it before they have their never ending battle.</br>  <br>I don't get what the big deal about that guy is. Just knock him unconscious and keep him drugged. Maybe amputate a few limbs just in case he wakes up. Or cut open his head and make him a vegetable. Fucking done.

Three strong communist men must drink liter of vodka before enter. Two must stare at item, one must continue drink vodka. <br><br> Description: Moved to shed after wooden pen freeze and break during cold Soviet winter. Shed is also wood, but with paint sometimes. SCP-173 is extremely hostile, like red faced Americans. Is also coward. Neither will make move while strong Soviet men have watchful eye. No one blink, on punishment of beating with cold leather. Object enjoy snap neck, like American commando pig. If object allowed to move, all will be sent to cold Siberia for reeducation. <br><br> Personnel report sound of stone scraping when creature is alone. This is dutiful Russian work ethic. If sound stops, subject to be beaten with iron rods, like child. <br><br> Floor is covered in shit and blood, like normal Soviet household. Shed must be cleaned every two weeks. Kept much cleaner than most Soviet household. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=W0u<wbr>-__5wuEs</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>This?<br> Don't believe it when they say they're trying to save her. Why would they bother? They've got exactly what they want exactly where they want it. <br>Fuck, why can't there be nice things? What's the deal with absolutely having to have an article about a girl whose suffering from a procedure that is literally 'not rape, but worse than what you're imagining'? Seriously.</br></br></br>    <br>Many of them are good. My favorite is the one where the Foundation goes full meta, smash the fourth wall into pieces and devise a protocol that basically kill all the writers.</br>   <br> Following the unfortunate, and completely preventable, death of Agent Gallagher, any personnel found to have current or prior ties to the "furry" or "otaku" communities are to be immediately reassigned to other projects. - O5-██ <br><br>He truly deLIVEREd. May your sacrifice give much neded lulz to spc personell.</br></br></br>  173 is in for some butt-raping  <br>Don't get what the traction of 173 is. It's basically just a Weeping Angel that shits on the floor when nobody's looking.</br>  <br>It was written before weeping angels existed.</br>  <br>I think it was the first entry ever written, so it's a classic.</br>  <br>Wasn't it written in '08?</br>  <br>Was it written long before the site was launched in 2008? Because the Weeping Angels first appeared a year before that, in 2007.</br>  <br>It was written before the SCP site was a thing.</br>  <br>Wow nicely done <br><br>  I pooped a little after staring at it for 3 min straight. [Spoiler/] </br></br></br>  <br>Any translation?</br>  <br>She's a murderous bitch who derrives pleasure from disemboweling men and eating their livers. She also has superhuman strength and speed and can polymorph into a monster.</br>  <br>Just a piece of old relic. If 173 were to be introduced now it wouldn't get as much praise.</br>  <br>for years I was not aware scp came from /x/</br>   Note: SCP-590 is not to be named as anything other then Five Ninety. He is a tool to be used, not someone's friend, sibling, or child. Anyone found forming attachments to an SCP will be removed to a less people-intensive duty. <br><br> For some reason this entry feels really dumb. </br></br>  <br>Because she's a kumiho, who are psychotic bitches who get wet from seducing men and ripping out their livers for food.</br>  <br>590 is the younger brother of one of the scientists.</br>  <br>dont livers grow back though?</br>  <br>Not if you remove it completely, which a Kumiho is likely to do. And even if it was possible or she took only part of the liver, the massive blood loss from having your stomach ripped open a liver being torn apart would make sure you wouldn't be able to live long enough for it to grow back anyway.</br>  <br>would she at least kiss me afterwards?</br>  <br>Not to mention "convince a mother to roast and eat her own child" and "carry out acts of necrophilia upon Agent Ramsey's fiance in full view of said Agent"</br>  <br> carry out acts of necrophilia upon Agent Ramsey's fiance in full view of said Agent <br>thats kind of hot actually</br></br>  <br>And that's why Japan is superior, because at least Japanese 9 tailed foxes can be good sometimes. Korean ones are always evil</br>  <br>do kitsunes have the potential to be evil though?</br>  <br>Sounds like any 2hu, actually.</br>  <br>This is important</br>  <br>They're like Fae, they either play pranks on you, repay favors or ruin your life for shits and giggles.</br>  <br>but not evil enough to become a dark fluffy overlord?</br>  <br>I think there are tales of corrupted Kitsune, but those are really rare. Kitsune generally won't fuck you over if you don't do the same to them first. They're pranksters by nature, but not really harmful as they are generally smart and wise enough to know when to stop. Helps that they are often servants of the goddess Inari.</br>  <br>The specific Kumiho that's referenced in the SCP foundation is hinted to be "evil" because she had traumatic experiences with men in the past. Hence why female personnel can usually get close to her without getting shredded.</br>  What's the matter with these strange Doctors?  <br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;682  vs 096<br>682 won, in end 96 was covering his own face and while replite was no longer giving fuck. <br><br><br>You forget that waifufags plaguing board would just try to save or run off with that girl at first possibity.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong post, meant to link </br>  I always found the ones where the SCPs are actually trans/extra-dimensional beings/portals that warp time/space to be the coolest ones. I had such a blast reading through the logs of 093 and that one ship that looks small on outside but was actually like a trans-dimensional maze on the inside, especially the further you go down the ship..  <br>I like it just because of how it highlights the SCP foundation's dickishness bordering on psychopathy. At least for other entries like 231 there is some reason like the survival of humanity that makes them torture people or keep them in pain, for this one they're basically using a teenage boy who poses no threat to anybody as a tool at his painful expense, because fuck you they can.</br>  <br>Yea i can imagine that agent leaving a single death note on the desk:<br><br> touch the fluffy tail </br></br></br>    So is SCP supposed to be portrayed like incompetents who make MKUltra seem like an exemplary scientific enterprise, or is all that just coincidental?  <br>It's supposed to be written like a GOVERNMENT SECRET AGENCY that polices and imprisons wacky sci-fi shit.</br>  <br>"MK Ultra"?</br>  <br>Good song</br>  <br><br>https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl#<wbr>q=MK+Ultra</wbr></br></br>  <br>Well more like an independant TOP SECRET world-wide research corp.

MKUltra is just CIA being CIA.</br>  <br>On the other hand MKUltra was far less wasteful in manpower, finances, facilities, natural resources, geographic allotment, etc. And it didn't have thirty different fuckers out of containment and on a killing spree at any given moment.</br>  <br>Just because they're doing important work doesn't mean they're not atrociously bad at it.</br>  <br>Unless there is a further linked subsection that I missed (there isn't, I'm on it right now), it looks like the just use him as a healing tool for when they can't be assed to waste a pill of SCP-500. That's basically what I said in my previous post, what do you seem to think I'm missing?</br>  <br>It's kind of hard to do your job perfectly when that job involves containing reality warping and universe ending demons from other dimensions.</br>  <br><br><br>Well, the problem is that the Foundation's canon is "There is no canon". Consistency can be varied greatly with different authors and "eras". After all, the main core is just . There are specific canons born from a contest few years ago, but their contents are no where near that of the whole thing.</br></br></br>  <br>Even the smaller fry are handled ridiculously. Like Able (why's it not Abel?), who for some reason is contained with a nuke when he goes on a rampage, instead of just doing something cheap like throwing him in a hole he can't climb out of.</br>  <br>Abel is in an agreement with the foundation to help them capture dangerous SCPs in exchange for not wrecking their shit since he enjoys the thrill of the hunt.</br>  <br>I thought his containment facility was in a subterranean base beneath the waves. Basically a hole. A hole that can be flooded.</br>  <br>It is indeed. They also have an onsite nuke because that particular site houses several dangerous SCPs</br>  <br>So that no other SCP submission can be stronger or OP than it. It's basically exists so people don't try to submit similar SCP's.

She is cute, fit, easygoing and down to earth, and funny. The other Keions are great too, but the rest of them have more negatives than Ritsu does when looking at them as potential wives. Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. Ritsu may be lazy but she is nowhere near as bad as Yui is. Ritsu could be reasoned with and taught to do things. Yui would just forget to do everything I told her to do. Mio and Mugi will both get fat once their metabolism slows down in their early-mid 20s. Many would think that Mugi being rich would be a huge positive for her, but to me it isn't. Even though she would be kind about it, she would always expect more than what I could provide for her on my own. I also would not want to leech off of her family's money. Mio's personality is adorable but overall I prefer Ritsu's. Ritsu is just more interesting to me. Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. I don't want to deal with her tsundere bullshit for 60 years. Jun is a fucking shit. She deserves no explanation beyond that. Ton-chan would be a better wife than Jun would be.</br></br>  Friendly reminder.  <br>I want her to be like a boxer or MMA fighter or pro wrestler or something so she can be announced enthusiastically by a super deep voiced dude, "DA MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOGS!"</wbr></br>  <br>do not</br>  <br> Azusa may be the cutest but she would be the most high maintenance wife out of the group. <br><br> He wouldn't put effort into his relationship with his waifu and devote his life to her <br>You don't deserve any of the keions</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yui is a complete airhead that would drive me crazy because she would never do anything, ever. <br><br>She's the perfect girl for a neet like me.

They know that they don't always technically sound the best but everyone knows they exude some kind of magic on live performances.<br>I listen to their songs every day.

They are both top tier fap material though</br>  <br>I don't know what that means, but I'll keep it in mind</br>  <br>Honestly Anon... I'm not quite sure. I made it as far as college, a fucking ocean away from my old life, but I am still alone. I think what's really going to help is having somebody by your side, pushing you forward. Not even a girlfriend or anything, just a good friend who understands and cares for you. <br><br>I haven't found that kind of a person.<br><br> It would be quite nice to feel something strong for another person. My feelings are quite muted, it seems, and I guess I'm a masochist, but wouldn't that be better than not feeling anything for anyone at all? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mio strikes me as the kind of girl who becomes addicted to things like sex, drugs, and alcohol having not been exposed to these things in her teen years, the kind of girl who has several trips to the hospital for stomach pumping in her freshman year of university.</br>  <br>upvoted and liked</br>  <br>Yesterday you said tomorrow</br>  <br>That's natural born slut. The second she tastes dick she can't get enough of it and from then onwards requires a good dicking at least 3-6 times a week, and with increasingly more participants.

The "epic" Akari is invisible, isn't it? I imagine you little shit laughing so hard as you click it that you drop your MORNING COLA on the floor, but it's ok, your mother will clean it up in the morning. Oh, that's right. Did I fail to mention? You live with your mother. You are a fat fucking fuckup, she's probably so sick of you already. So sick of having to do everything for you all goddamn day, every day, for a grown man who spends all his time on 4chan posting about an cute girls anime. Just imagine this. She had you, and then she thought you were gonna be a scientist or an astronaut or something grand, and then you became a NEET. A pathetic meme-posting NEET. She probably cries herself to sleep everyday thinking about how bad it is and how she wishes she could just disappear. She can't even try to talk with you because all you say is "how did you make a thread without a picture?" You've become a parody of your own self. And that's all you are.

Here's a slightly outdated picture. I now have a second smaller shelf near my bed, so it's not so crowded.</br>  <br>I like to buy manga sometimes. <br><br> Pic related is only missing volume 1 of Akuma de Jyoshi. More stuff is on the way. </br></br></br>  <br>What are the two books to the right of History of Japan?</br>  <br>meant to <br><br>how embarassing</br></br></br>  Who can't wait for hardcover Queen Emeraldas?  <br>Hell of a collection you've got there</br>  <br>Princess Knight by Osamu Tezuka</br>  <br>Nono, to the left of those. The super thick one with the title in circle, it looks awesome. The one next to it looks intriguing too</br>  <br>Oh, oops. That's also by Tezuka. It's Dororo.</br>  <br> clean room </br>  <br>What titles do you have in those shelves?</br>        <br>This nigga got me covered.</br>      <br>Where'd you buy that kinda bookshelf. I just moved into a new apt and am lacking in furniture.</br>      Just got this one.  This shit is why I don't waste my money on manga anymore  <br>That one red SZS is tweaking my autism. Also, it's a shame how those fags from Kodansha put it on permanent hiatus.</br>  <br>It baffles me how English covers can't get it right.<br> The Japanese one going higher just because of the art still annoys me. </br></br>  <br> Locke &amp; Key <br>good taste anon.</br></br>  Would I be worse than the people who's collection is 80% One Piece/Naruto if most of my beginning manga is Haruhi related?  <br><br>It's because they don't use dustcovers. It's the only way to get a complete collection without bullshit like that.<br>English manga is lower quality than japanese manga, which is the 2nd lowest quality out there.</br></br></br>  <br>Not at all.</br>  <br>Haruhi is good.<br> Light novels, right? </br></br>  <br>Light novels, Haruhi-chan, Yuki-chan.</br>  <br>Well, at least you have the light novels, so yes, you are better than those.</br>  Missing Dorohedoro.  <br>Such taste, thats almost all the series I want but im too poor to buy.</br>  <br><br>I'm still pissed that those Lone Wolf and Cub/Samurai Executioner omnis are undersized.</br></br>  <br> Lone Wolf and Cub/Samurai Executioner omnis are undersized. <br>Oh, do tell?</br></br>  <br>They're like a half inch shorter than most manga volumes.</br>  Azumanga the best.  <br>sorry I mistook this thread for the latest haul one... but your collections are mostly pretty disappointing.</br>  <br> but your collections are mostly pretty disappointing. <br>Says the guy that posted Azumanga.</br></br>  <br>Oh, does the art suffer?</br>  <br>The Fruits Basket Ultimate Edition's art was pixelated on more than a few pages.</br>  <br>Let me have this joy, I only bought it today. Gonna get the 2nd vol next time. Btw do you have something against Azumanga? What is wrong with you.</br>  <br>I keep it on batoto</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;reddit <br>Don't post unless you invest. buyfagging is srs bsns.</br></br>  Is there any manga that even worth buying that isn't yotsuba?  <br>I would but all my manga is digital</br>  <br>I wouldn't say it suffers. It would just be better if it was larger. They went from tiny volumes to small omnis. I just don't understand it.</br>  <br> I don't actually like manga <br><br>Fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>azumanga daioh isn't very funny, and the artist puts minimal effort into his comics<br><br>every one of his comics is "osaka gets fun of for being young or for her accent" or "haha this person gets hit in the face"<br><br>and i remember one comic where one of them made up a charm where you could break chopsticks perfectly for good luck, and before a test she was breaking chopsticks. the problem is, this comic was the EXACT same frame of her breaking chopsticks, four times. how much effort do you think that took?<br><br>the only good part about azumanga was the "dad" jokes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>        Okay this is going to sound stupid but I gotta ask now or never.<br><br>As someone who has never bought manga before, how would you go about getting series that are like, only translated on the web.<br><br>I'd like to own a collection but there are a lot of things that aren't translated and stuff. I just recently found out that blu rays that are released in America actually have subs in them so I'm gonna start buying those too. <br><br>Is there something similar like that? <br><br>Like,  has non non biyori volume 8, and on amazon I could only find the first volume translated. <br><br>I don't know how this shit works I should just stick to online  ;-; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It all honestly depends on what series you're looking to purchase. Since you seem to want to purchase things that are in English, depending on the series you're interested in, you may be out of luck depending on whether or not an English publisher has decided to release a series here in the states.</br>  Maybe I should get a larger shelf and start collecting more.  <br>I mean honestly I wouldnt mind just having a collection just to have it. <br><br>I'd probably want to read them once though. Maybe I'll just be autistic and buy both Japanese and English if possible</br></br></br>  <br>Having a collection isn't necessarily as novel as it seems, and can be a serious bitch to get started. The biggest reason is that sometimes, certain volumes of a series, or an entire series that has been translated and released, will end up out of print. This means that the only way to purchase them is using something like eBay, and buying at ridiculous prices.</br>  <br>Just do some research into the big English manga publishers right now and see if they're releasing or have already released a series you like. It seems to me that the English manga market is on an upswing in terms of ambitions of licenses. Probably the biggest since Tokyopop crashed and burned</br>  <br>We have a thread on /a/ specially dedicated to that shit. Search for it on the catalog.</br>    1/4  <br>2/4</br>  <br>3/4</br>  <br>4/4</br>  I got this on sale in amiami some time ago  Old picture, but I've only bought three manga since then.  Torn over buying the OPM viz release. On one hand it's dirt cheap for an english release. On the other I don't know if I'd really read it again, and I have no idea where money for viz manga actually goes.  <br> All those children's fantasy books <br>I hear you, bro. No need to be ashamed.</br></br>  Really small collection, being a NEET doesn't help. There are many missing volumes here, in prisma illya case HLJ didn't have volume 2 and 5 in stock  Here's what just arrived 3 mins ago  <br>Nice buy, I want to buy them too, I really liked the anime</br>  <br>Yes I bought them for the same reason, they're quite good, all furiganas are included too. If you wanna know something more, just tell me.</br>    Berserk<br>GTO shonan 14 days<br>NGE manga<br>last few volumes of Stardust Crusaders<br><br>If they ever release Diamond is Unbreakable or Steel Ball Run in english i'd buy those too, other then that nothing I really want to physically own</br></br></br></br></br>    I've got all english volumes of Hidamari Sketch and Hunter X Hunter but haven't really bought anything new in about a year. Probably Hidamari volume 8 whenever Yen Press releases it.<br><br>No pictures because I'm a faggot and not home.</br></br>    <br>Get GA. http://www.bookdepository.com/searc<wbr>h/advanced?searchTerm=&amp;searchSeries<wbr>=38242</wbr></wbr></br>  Outdated pic, <br><br><br>I need to get that some day.</br></br></br>  <br>Really outdated pic.</br>  <br>Do you people also have fucked up Book Depository prices? I mean hell, the latest volume of Ajin: Demi-human is 18€ (20$). That's insane, the books normally worth half of that. Most of the books have somewhat regular prices but some like Ajin and latest JoJo are quite ridiculous. Is it just me or is it global? I heard one should often delete cookies for e-shops since some has algorithm of affecting prices but I clean them often… and prices like these are insane.</br>    Got that DxD  <br>Ajin v6 does seem to be a bit pricey, but it will probably drop below the MSRP closer to release, though if the series isn't selling as well as they want they sometimes bump pricing way up - Hidamari v8 is like $18 compared to earlier bolumes at $11.<br><br>The JoJos are expensive because they are hardcover omnibi.</br></br></br>  <br> all that Inio Asano <br>You getting Punpun now that it's finally being released?<br><br> Blue <br>I've been looking for a good English copy of that for years.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, getting Punpun for sure, and A Girl by the Sea as well when they out.<br><br>I got lucky with Blue, it was being sold "like new" by a 3rd party seller for $20. that was back in 2010 though and I haven't seen it very low since then unfortunately. Great manga though.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm still looking for the elusive Hidamari volume 4.</br>  <br> A Girl by the Sea <br>Forgot about that one, need to add it to the list.<br><br>I've almost wound up with German and Spanish copies of Blue. I always double check the ISBNs now because everyone uses the English stock photos, I learned that when I wound up with some German Oh My Goddess.<br><br><br>http://www.bookdepository.com/Sunsh<wbr>ine-Sketch-v-4-Ume-Aoki/97803160811<wbr>22<br><br>This one? They eventually did a reprint, they just never widely announced it.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I have a nice little collection here. I'd love to buy some more but the lack of shelf space makes it hard to justify.<br>Not pictured are the box sets of Death note and Bakuman.</br>  <br> A Girl by the Sea <br>It's the only one i'm missing too (pretty much every Asano has been localized here save for Dead Demons).<br>Just didn't like it as much as the rest.</br></br></br>  Be gentle.  <br> here <br>Where do you live? I hope we get more Asano in English, but I'd already given up on Punpun years ago.<br><br><br>Why are some series in reverse order?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please put Yotsuba, Watamote and Nichijou right to left.</br>  <br>Left to right I mean. <br><br>Mind to take a picture of your DVDs below?</br></br></br>  <br>Such a silly design, at least the Billy lets you stick in 1-2 more shelves than it comes with, and get rid of dead volume.</br>  <br>I really do need a bigger bookshelf, but I can't fit much higher or wider than that at my current place.</br>  <br>Are you from Australia? 17 $ from Brit Bong</br>  <br>If you are looking for cheap moonspeak volumes, then I usually will go to Book-Off. Kinokuniya has an excellent variety, especially online, but their stateside outfit is on the pricier end as far as manga is concerned. Some people use CDJapan, but I never have, so I can't really speak to their quality. <br><br><br>Nice work on Joshiraku, but why do you have them on separate shelves? Bretty good shelf overall really.<br><br><br>Looks pretty cute. How's the quality of the art inside?<br><br><br>Oh God what happened to Nano's hands? Also, wont putting figures on top like that put little dings in the edges of the dust jackets? Still, a good start.  Also, if you like Kaduho, then I suggest you try Kagaku Chop as well. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  All aboard the hype TRAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br><br>I could see why doffy shots himself in front of this horny version of whitebeard</br></br>  b u l l s h i t <br>u l l s h i t b<br>l l s h i t b u<br>l s h i t b u l <br>s h i t b u l l<br>h i t b u l l s<br>i t b u l l s h<br>t b u l l s h i</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is that his mustache or nose hairs  <br>Doffy better make it out of this alive.</br>  <br> That whole opening post <br>Way to kill the thread on entry faggot</br></br>  <br>That's him then?

It's spiraling out of control.</br>  <br>Kaidou a strong, independent yonkou who don't need no devil's fruit!</br>  Kaidou seems a lot more humble than he was made out to be  <br> avoiding the question <br>I guess that answer my question.</br></br>  <br> The Admirals are all super-tall <br>I thought they were about average sized from what I remember. Aokiji standing with Robin back at Enies Lobby, Fujitora fighting Zoro, Kizaru quitting after Beckman aimed at him. Super tall would be like Blackbeard.</br></br>    is Kaidou the same race as Oars?   still haven't seen Doffy without glasses <br><br>Why is this allowed</br></br>  <br>And a third one. Can't you see what you've become anon?<br><br>Let's try this again. Robin is 188cm tall. Now look at him.</br></br></br>    <br>No u!</br>   no one's talking about bro Fujitora   <br><br>These fags were just planning their little faggot plans about taking on Red Hair, despite Kaidou already fucking Kidd Raw, in drops Kaidou ready to tear them and Doffy a new asshole.<br><br>RIP in pieces Wizard of Oz alliance.</br></br></br></br>  So, Law vs Drake and Luffy vs Kaidou for the end game of next arc.  <br>You forgot Moria.</br>  Kaidou looks nothing like this.  Also seventh Shichibukai when?  <br>Look at this accurate portrayal of the Shichibukai from Arlong Park.</br>  <br>neither does big mom. and neither does most of the shichibukai when we first saw their silhouettes.</br>  <br><br>Luffy and law are bffs forever now and are gonna unleash the D all up in the new world.</br></br>    <br>Yeah but that was practically the beginning of the series<br><br><br>From what we've seen of her she reasonably resembles the one below Shanks</br></br></br></br>  <br> practically <br>We just saw Mihawk and none of those shadows looks anything like him.</br></br>  Kaidou is a fucking weakling... accourding to Law's talk.    <br>Third from left and middle look like him</br>  <br>sword looks nothing like his though.</br>  <br><br>yes, millions<br>now fuck off and got back to your bleach thread</br></br></br>    <br> Kaidou is a fucking weakling... accourding to Law's talk. <br><br>The same Law that was crying like a bitch after consistently getting out-rused by Doffy?<br><br>Bitch please.<br><br>To that end, I'm sure any retarded Doffyfags aren't stupid enough to even try to argue that Doflamingo stands a chance in hell against Kaidou, nevermind their retarded head-canon theories about Doffy planting some kind of bullshit mind-control device in the artificial devil fruits he was making for Kaidou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>faggot</br>  Ah I see this is the release day cancer containment thread  <br>Oda set it up for the next time we see Doffy<br><br>He doesnt have his shades anymore so unless Oda does some ultra-bullshit, we'll be seeing his entire face<br><br> inb4 there's a bandage wrapped around his head that also covers one eye </br></br></br></br></br>  Blackbard looks like a fuckboii compared to this guy. How did he even make it to Yonkou?  <br>But Scopper Gaban looks like that. Pretty sure Kaido is Scopper with beast hax.<br><br> immortal from last Ope Ope user <br> used as experiment for the giant shit by Joker and Ceasar  <br> ate tons of false devil fruits to kill himself </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Scopper Gaban looks like that. <br><br>please get out of here with these youtube-tier theories</br></br></br>    <br>Is Kaidou the same ancient race as oars/oars jr? wanting to die a bizarre hobby for one piece.</br>  <br> Blackbard looks like a fuckboii <br><br>well<br><br>yeah. He's like the Fuccboi poster child</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is the Sky Island held up by fucking baloons?  <br>HOLY FUKKING FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU<wbr>UUUUUUUUUUUUCK!</wbr></wbr></br>  Kaido came off as a sinister devil, now he kind of just comes off as a bit of a goof. I'm sure he will still be merciless (they can't undo him slaughtering Moriah's entire crew), but a lot less sinister.  <br> long pointy chin <br> shit eating grin <br> pointy nose <br><br>Are you serious? How do you not see the similarity? It was already announced KAido used to be in Roger's crew.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Last page loads in my browser </br>  <br><br>Hes gonna be a ¨I dont give a fuck I do what I want¨ type of guy</br></br>  Immortal..<br><br>So eating multiple fruits cant kill him</br></br>  <br>your criteria for who looks like who is kind of lacking<br><br>it's like you're saying Duval is Sanji because<br><br> blond hair <br> one sided fringe <br> swirly brow <br><br>they look nothing alike</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chinjao, Kidd, Law, Roger and even fucking Zoro have all been stated to be merciless killers and it gets brushed aside once they become friends with Luffy and we see the gags.<br><br>Kaido confirmed for Luffy ally.</br></br></br></br>  <br>also<br> It was already announced KAido used to be in Roger's crew. <br><br>source?</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>nothin' personal Kidd</br></br>  <br>Blackbeard was always a joke.<br><br>Jesus is a good example of why Blackbeard is a joke.<br><br>Look how many times Sabo punched and kicked Jesus before Jesus said okay this is a bad idea to fight without any haki, I'm gonna haki up my arms now.<br><br>And Sabo used fire directly in front of one of Jesus's eyeballs and burned it until it became completely white.<br><br>Oda would be a hack if Jesus did not go blind in one eye from that attack.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  mfw the Oz trio will never get to travel the golden road with Dorothy now  <br>hax devil fruits</br>  <br>not that guy or even reading the arguments but we've seen Kid mercilessly slaughter people<br><br>Not so much for everyone else</br></br></br>  <br>The wizard of oz theory was fucking retarded to begin with. Get that arlong park shit out of here.</br>  we all know Kidds gonna be the Kiba to Luffy's Naruto; his imminent jobbings gonna prove it  he's from wanokuni<br>his tattoo and mawashi</br>  <br>remember when people thought Sabo having amnesia would be too fucking retarded?</br>  <br><br>Roger? I thought he died before Luffy even was born.</br></br>   that Sanji and Co part  <br>I have no idea what's going on, less because of translation and more because I can't remember what they were doing last time we saw them.</br>  <br>No one here watches Naruto.</br>  <br/>  <br>it still is<br>Oda is becoming kishi</br></br>  <br>he and Luffy will be friends until he does something Luffy takes issue with. Then Luffy's gonna get his ass kicked</br>  <br>remember when people thought Aokiji being an undercover agent for blackbeard was retarded?</br>  <br>Oh good, it wasn't just me.</br>    KAIDOU RECEIVED THE IMMORTAL SURGERY FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER OF THE OPE OPE NO MI  <br><br>kidd is going to be luffy's whitebeard, except more ambitious</br></br>  <br> luffy's whitebeard <br>thats law</br></br>  <br>And remember all the people who said Sanji was gonna get captured by Big Mam?</br>  <br>and the time people thought Doflamingo was actually going to impel down?</br>  <br>no Kid is obsessive and nutso<br><br>He's going to be the Shiki to Luffy's Roger<br><br>Law will be the Whitebeard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good times, good times. Reminds me of the time people thought Uroge was chilling with Enel</br>  <br>Yeah, Kidd is confirmed weakest Supernova as well.<br><br>Lost an arm to Big Mom and requested help from Appo and Hawkins.<br><br>Appo is alpha so he doesn't need help from people but Kidd needs allies to survive.<br><br>Kidd deserves to be the first Supernova to retire from the New World.<br><br>There has to be winners and losers in the Supernova and Kidd will be the first loser.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Roger and whitebeard fought a lot. Luffy and law will probably never fight with each other outside of gags.</br></br></br>  <br>Sanjifags are delusional.<br><br>They kept saying Sanji will cook for Big Mom in order to let everyone go but Sanji was never important enough to do something like that.</br></br></br>  <br>Law=Whitebeard shit doesn't hold up anymore since Luffy and Law made an alliance.</br>  <br>Kid's been hyped to much to go down quickly<br><br>it'll probably be Drake<br><br><br>they dont have to be a perfect mirror, anon. But even Whitebeard and Roger used to chill together</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Appo has common sense so Appo will actually run away from Kaidou.<br><br>Kidd is too cocky so he will stay to confront Kaidou.<br><br>Hawkins is incapable of doing anything or making any choice without enough time to read his fortune cards.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Luffy and Kaido cross paths <br> everyone expects them to duke it out <br> some gag occurs and they both laugh <br> become best friends </br></br></br></br>  <br>or that time people where people thought Gecko Moria is coming back to kill Kaidou</br>  <br>Luffy vs. Blackbeard redux</br>  <br>see<br><br><br>Assuming they both have long lives ahead of them. There's plenty of time for animosity to grow or for Law to want something Luffy wont let him have</br></br></br></br>  <br>He has the same face, though</br>  <br> Kaido confirmed for Luffy ally. <br>They will be besties after Kaido finds out that Luffy beat Doffy for him and captured the unreliable fart logia scientist.</br></br>  <br>Who knows maybe after they go their separate ways they'll get into a conflict at some point in the future. I'm not saying they will have a death match but it'l be like a ¨you know I'll have to kick your ass right now for this, right?¨ ¨ok, this will be fun¨</br>  <br>Its almost like anons love coming up with retarded ass theories that keep getting blown the fuck out; like that one where Capone gets kidnapped by a close orbiting moon</br>  <br> There's plenty of time for animosity to grow or for Law to want something Luffy wont let him have <br>I highly doubt that with all the shit they've been through and the fact that Luffy just fulfilled what Law's been working towards for the past 10+ years.</br></br>  <br> Appo has common sense so Appo will actually run away from Kaidou. <br>but before making him mad</br></br>  <br>Well assuming Law is still going after One Piece, they have to fight over it eventually</br>  Lola's mom will appear  <br> but before making him mad <br>as expected of the Roar of the Sea</br></br>  If he's unkillable then the fight will end up as One Piece's version of Pain.<br> Don't be such an asshole <br> Ok </br></br>  <br>But it's true. Almost every scene of Appo has him running away.</br>  Honestly I don't care to much for Kaidou's new design. The fact that he is rumored to be the strongest person use to be intriguing, but now it's "well yeah of course, just like at him."  <br>Holy shit, I don't realized Hancock already being foreshadowed at thriller bark.</br>  <br>But Pain was killable</br>  <br><br>Law's character arc basically said he only had one life goal and that was getting doffy. Everything else was just a pretense or means to that end. Now that it's done law has nothing else to do except fuck around with luffy and his heart crew</br></br>  <br>I think he's gonna go after One Piece with Luffy, not against. With the way he smiled when Luffy said he's gonna be Pirate King, I think he was more accepting of that idea than not.</br>    <br>Do you know what chapter they talk about his conflict with Big Mom?</br>  <br>Isn't Apoo the guy who tried to take an admiral by himself?<br><br>If anything he's the biggest retard out of the three.</br></br></br>  I'm so glad the rumors about Sanji being dead all turned out to be false  for now   <br> Implying it's not Big Mom </br>  Sanji is going to job soon. Don't get excited.  <br><br><br>Honestly I feel that something like is going to happen. They fight, Luffy says some nonsense about how a man's dream never dies, and that Kaidou should stop trying to kill himself because dreams. After that they become friends.</br></br></br>  <br>That wasn't the part of the fight I was getting at.</br>  <br><br><br>I dunno. There's still the chance he's going after it alone</br></br></br>  <br> Mr.Kaidou and the retards three </br>  <br><br>Can you shits stop comparing One Piece to Naruto. <br> fucking Kid = Kiba <br> Kaido = Pain <br>Holy shit. Kill yourselves please.</br></br></br></br></br>  So the Kaido henchman had the Bone Bone Fruit / Hone Hone no Mi, right?  Poor moria couldn't do nothing to that luck but what if he takes Kaidou's shadow and put it inside him? who wins  <br>why kill ourselves while you, the asspained autist, lives on? Seems like we'd be doing the world a great disservice</br>  So we an all agree that Urouge was pretty based this chapter right?  <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/Ancwu_9KFTk  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I used a famous example that doesn't happen too often where the big bad is literally taken down by a moral speech. It was relevant, suck a dick.</br>  <br>It's totally different</br>  I really liked what the Kaidou intro did though. It solved a lot of problems with the story for me. For one, it showed that these magical super-pirates can occasionally lose battles. Secondly, it showed that the WG doesn't just let the yonkou do whatever they want - Kaido has been imprisoned multiple times.      <br> Urouge was pretty based this chapter <br><br>all he did was watch some nutjob hop off an island<br><br>literally sat there and prayed.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>He has never been imprisoned.<br><br>The ships to Impel Down all sank before they reached there.<br><br>And if Kaidou wants to die so badly, why doesn't he fight Magellan.</br></br></br></br></br>  I prefer the CP0 spoiler rather than this Kaidou reveal.<br><br>I feel CP0 is more relevant in this arc compared to Kaidou since we saw CP0 and they are suppose to be arriving to Dressrosa soon.</br></br>  <br>Kaido's massive army would solve that problem.<br>The main problems would be based around Shanks since he's pretty fucking normal with what looks like a small crew.</br></br>  <br> I used a famous example that doesn't happen too often where the big bad is literally taken down by a moral speech <br>Thinking Luffy gives a fuck about morals enough to talk-no-jitsu anyone. If Kaido pisses him off he'll just tell him he's being a fucktard and try and beat him up, that's it. If he befriends him, then it'll probably be through stupid jokes, food, or a common cause. None of that moral crap. This isn't Naruto, so a pain situation won't fucking happen. Stop comparing the two series when they approach things completely differently.</br></br>  <br>As is the job of a Priest.</br>  <br>It's more th at he's trying to find these non definite ways that may be able to kill him.<br>So while he wouldn't jump into a volcano or swallow a pill of cyanide he'd jump off of a sky island or try to tank an asteroid or fight someone.</br></br>  <br> &gt;side character </br>  1. if his immortality is Devil fruit based. why not just eat another one.<br>2. if its not devil fruit based. why not eat 2 of them<br>3. If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times?</br></br>  So who beat kaido those 7 times?<br>White beard and shanks?</br>  Kaido looks a lot cooler than I ever figured he would. How fucking strong does Shanks have to be to intimidate him into not attacking Whitebeard who was clearly stronger than Kaidou even in old age and poor health.  <br>yep. Nothing especially based about it<br><br>Buddhists gonna Buddh</br></br></br>  <br> Stop comparing the two series <br>But I'm not, you're the retard comparing the series. I'm comparing the Pain fight and the eventual Kaido fight.</br></br>  <br>3. Probably because he wants to die. So he got captured on purpose but escaped by accident.</br>  <br>Did Oda just imply that Kaidou managed to destroy seastone since Marines always capture pirates with seastone cuffs all the time but Kaidou always breaks free so that means seastone doesn't work on Kaidou.</br>  Fuck Kaido. seems like a gag bullshit with 'suacide' being his hobby. if you try hard enough it should be easy.<br>"Hmmmm I wana die, why not pick a fight with Mihawk, he seems like the type of guy who would take the challenge"</br>  <br> 1. if his immortality is Devil fruit based. why not just eat another one. <br><br>luck conspires to send him nothing but fake DFs<br><br> 2. if its not devil fruit based. why not eat 2 of them <br><br>see above<br><br> 3. If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times? <br><br>he wanted the Marines to execute him so he let himself be caught or stopped giving a fuck BECAUSE no one can do shit to him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Roger is weaker than Kaidou.<br><br>Normal marines with normal bodies and a generic looking uniform managed to execute Roger in Logue town.<br><br>You would think their spears would break upon contact with Roger's skin but these weak nameless generic marines managed to successfully execute Roger on the very first try.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe he doesnt have a fruit so they didnt use cuffs on him.</br>  Kaido's design is shit, I've seen fanart that was better<br>That said he feels like a great guy from the little we've seen of him</br>  <br>Don't know. dont have a fucking clue how it works. by my understanding if you can simply have some wiggle room you should be able to still use your DF if they aren't tight shakles. or what about clothing? does Seastone give off an aura?</br>  <br>Could have possibly been both. Depending on how old he is, maybe even a small chance Roger too?</br>  <br>Im also making a stupid assumption that its 1 person per defeat, so roger white beard shanks and maybe garp?</br>  <br>Where the fuck is everyone getting this "Luck" from? like its a guarentied thing? it seems more like he just has a uncontrollable hardening Haki</br>  <br>I don't think Kaidou has a fruit since the marine ships that captures him always sank and drowning is an easy way to die yet Kaidou seems to escape from drowning all the time.</br>  I wish it wasn't Kaidou, so that his "can't die/lucky as fuck" anm could go to usopp  <br>he probably told him he heard there was a beast a couple islands over that could kill him</br>  <br> Kaido's design is shit, I've seen fanart that was better <br>Please link. If the fanart is shittier than you have to seppuku yourself for lying.</br></br>   why do people call me kaido? <br> my real name is Kai D. O. </br>  <br>luffys not like naruto, if kaido tells him that his dream is to die he will say go for it, if its your dream</br>  <br>He jumped off skypiea, I think that's enough to show it's extremely difficult to kill him.</br>  <br>Didnt mean to link to<br><br>Just used it to open the reply tab and forgot to erase the link</br></br></br>  Why do people still read this crap? Even bleach and Naruto are better  <br> I'm comparing the Pain fight and the eventual Kaido fight. <br>Why make shitty comparisons when you know they're not gonna be the same anyway.</br></br>   that entirely obvious "No I don't want to be Queen" set-up <br><br>ID'S FUCKIN HABBENING AND THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT</br></br>  <br>Garp definitely, if he's been captured and tried for execution so many times I don't really know who else could or would do it. <br><br> inb4 Sengoku <br>Have you ever seen him ever do anything apart from the war where he had no choice?</br></br></br></br>  <br>More then likley just a really really tough Haki. only logical explination. Gulitones don't just break on your neck. especially if you are seastoned. Yet seastone has no effect on Haki as i can see it</br>  <br> big bad <br> beaten by words <br><br> big bad is invincible <br> only way to "beat" him (judging by current information) is by words <br><br>Are you autistic?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> Have you ever seen him ever do anything apart from the war where he had no choice? <br>I'll take, Sengoku not being insta spawned into fleet Admiral and working his way there for $500 Jerry</br></br>  Is that Mr. Prince Sanji finally or regular gay Sanji?  <br>So Kaido doesn't look like a monster? That's disappointing</br>  <br>Outside of a phoenix, only one other "unkillable" legendary creature comes to mind.<br><br>The Hydra.<br><br>It might be devil fruit unrelated though.</br></br></br></br></br>  Look more like green bull tbh.  <br> Where the fuck is everyone getting this "Luck" from? <br><br>did you read the chapter? Its not just physical things that affect him</br></br></br>  <br>Seastone does drain energy though. I'd be surprised if it's possible to have strong CoA in that situation.</br>  <br>dat metal arm</br>  <br> Kai D. O. <br> O = 王 = King <br> Kaido, King of the Beasts </br></br></br>  <br> only way to "beat" him (judging by current information) is by words <br>You honestly think Luffy is going to beat a big bad with words, instead of finding a way to defeat him like he always does? Are you fucking retarded or do you not read this manga.</br></br>  <br> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List<wbr>_of_legendary_creatures_by_type#Luc<wbr>k_and_wealth</wbr></wbr> <br>Apparently this is a thing.<br> Dwarf <br> Genie <br> Leprechaun <br> Sigbin <br> Yaksha / Yakshini <br> Sarimanok </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So why does O=王?</br>  <br> 30 <br> So who beat kaido those 7 times? <br> White beard and shanks? <br>those were games of ro-sham-bo. Kaido has never been defeated in a real fight</br></br></br></br>  <br>People like you make me want to hate Fucking Mr.Prince.</br>  Gonna say that the previous owner of the ope ope no mi used the immortal surgery on kaido and law will have to do some shit to reverse it  <br> implying she isnt going to become Dressrosa's Otohime <br><br>Luffy and co and whoever else will be sailing for Zou before Rebecca wakes up the next morning. Luffy's had enough of people hero-worshipping him so he'll sneak off while no one's paying attention to him</br></br></br>  <br>  If he is supposedly SO FUCKING STRONG how was he captured so many times? <br>He's very gullible</br></br>  <br>I'd say that's pretty monstrous-looking before the point of not looking like a human anymore honestly. It's pretty damn perfect for Kaidou imo</br>  <br>That would be nice, it would give his "im trying to kill myself as a hobby" a little more reason then hes just bored.</br>  <br>王 is pronounced O. Or Ō to be exact, a double wovel but it doesn't really make a difference.</br>  <br>He's certainly not going to beat him with fists and he's certainly had speeches about dreams before.<br>I still think it's going to be a case of Luffy being amazed by his fruit (assuming it's still zoan based) and wanting Kaido to join his crew.</br></br>   Kaido is just looking for a place to die <br> Whitebeard beat his ass <br> Shanks stopped him from going to war <br> Neither of them could kill him <br> Kaido just wants to start a war to find someone to finally kill him <br><br>That's deep man.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if Laws dies afterwards.</br>  <br>I'm suprised the zoofuckers haven't descended on this chapter just yet, there were like three furries in it</br>  K-kaido?  <br>I could see Kaido being a Djinn.</br>  <br>So the reason kaido and shanks didnt fight is that shanks told him the wars pretty much over and everyone who might be able to kill you is already too tired to do so and he just gave up?</br>  Kaidou only wanted to give Moria's crew the gift of death, he was only helping.  <br>Every part of his survival makes sense that its simply uncontrollable unbreakable lv 9001 Haki</br>  I can't believe it... It wasn't a temple...  <br>Probably.</br>  Luffy is going to give Kaidou everything he has and lose. Then, just as Kaidou is about to descend on him, a lone bumblebee lands gently on Kaidou and stings him. Turns out he was allergic to beestings<br>how mad would you be?</br>  <br> chapter starts off with gambling <br> kaidous literally just abnormally lucky and that's why hes seen as so powerful <br>that's some good theming actually. bravo oda<br><br>   yfw luffy will win by being luckier than kaidou </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>its one piece, guillontines can break on his neck if hes tough enough.</br>   last non-bb boss of the entire world finally revealed <br> he's another joke character that will do nothing but make fart jokes and dance with luffy <br>Cool glad I spent 20 years waiting for this.</br></br>  <br>Isn't Haki just willpower based?<br> Observation "I want to see everything" <br> Hardening "I dont want to be hurt" <br> Kings "I want Everything" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Garp should have honestly had more rank than he did because he's the only one chasing after Luffy once he started to kick shit up. Sure, everyone else at the time could fight and beat him just as easily but most of them just waited for Luffy to show up close enough to the HQ before deciding "oh, well he's close enough and punching out world nobles, guess we need to deal with him now"<br><br>I hope we see more Garp and Luffy interaction soon.</br></br></br>  <br>I doubt it, Luffy has a big D but KaiDo has a bigger one.</br>  <br><br>I thought he was a Sheep Zoan that was somehow able to grow his horn on his hand</br></br>  <br>he's lucky to have made so many friends :^)</br>  <br>it could also just be luck<br><br>he DID say his head hurt when he hit the ground</br></br></br>  <br> Kaidou sees Luffy as a strong adversary and wants to keep living to fight him so that he can die <br> tfw Law is completely useless against Kaidou because nobody want he does to Kaidou he'll keep living and fighting </br></br>  <br> Garp should have honestly had more rank than he did <br>They tried, he refused promotions.</br></br>  <br> Garp should have honestly had more rank than he did <br>Marineford baby? Garp turned down every promotion offered to him for the exact reason 'I can allready do as i please wih my current rank" Read the fucking manga dude</br></br>  So, With Geppo and Haki. is it safe to assume anyone Cp9 teir or above could do the exact same as what Kaido just did?  Why did Kaidou all the smile fruits? Making an army powerful enough to kill himself?  <br>Yes but from the looks if it they don't have much willpower lying on the floor drooling just because they're in seastone cuffs.</br>  <br> I will probably laugh if anything, but that'll be when I stop reading for a while </br>  <br>It was a 10,000 metres fall and he was completely fine<br>It's not luck, his body is just that tough</br></br>  <br>Only if its a dwarf that ate the bee bee fruit.</br>  <br>Roger was dying anyway so he didn't care about the execution (I guess).<br><br>We have no clue what's up with Kaidou though, maybe it's uncontrolable Haki, maybe it's a DF, maybe just natural luck.<br>Hopefully the next chapters will give more information about him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you're saying kaidou is pretending to commit suicide?</br>  <br>He wants to make World War II<br>Do you even read the manga?</br></br>  <br>Ace could beat prison guards while seastoned. and he was a DF user. Id say he could take on anyone below mangellan and hanebell</br>  Luffy, Zoro, Sanji and Franky could all fall from Skypeia without using any abilities besides haki and natural toughness and be perfectly ok at this point in the series. I don't see what the big deal is.  <br> He's certainly not going to beat him with fists <br>We'll see about that. You do know defeat =/= kill in One Piece right?<br> he's certainly had speeches about dreams before. <br>And? Has he ever lectured an Antagonist about his dreams before? If anything, it's more in the lines of "don't fuck with my crew/friends". Luffy doesn't force his ideals or dreams on villains let alone his own crewmates. And the villains in OP rarely change their ambitions/ideals and whatnot that easily either. <br> I still think it's going to be a case of Luffy being amazed by his fruit (assuming it's still zoan based) and wanting Kaido to join his crew. <br>This is definitely a more likely possibility. Less Naruto, and more Luffy-like.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate I know he turned them down, I just wanted him to not be some shitty vice-admiral which seems like anyone can be one at this point. I doesn't make me give a shit about them if they're all just expendable as fuck anyway.</br>  <br>still 'over 9000' haki should have prevented a headache. It didnt so my vote still goes towards Luck</br>  Why didn't Oda show Kaido's eyes.  <br>The design is fucking beautiful and he's not a fucking midget or something retarded like that.</br>  <br>Im saying the feat its self is accomplishable by alot of people. IF they are guarded. so its not exactly amazing that he survived the fall. someone ought to teach him about terminal Velocity</br>  <br> Roger is weaker than Kaidou. <br><br>Oh, wow, Oda sensei you are lurking /a/ and you are so graceful to share with us some information only you know?<br><br> anyway i think roger was the stronger person in the world, no fruit based, only raw power, at least, i hope it will like this. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Im not you Mate, Pal</br>  <br>his rank doesnt mean shit. you know hes a top tier character so what does his rank matter?</br>  The previous user of the Ope Ope no mi must hav eused the immortality on Kaido thus he cannot die these days no matter what happens to him<br><br>He will only get defeated if the current user of the Ope Ope no mi, Law, uses the immortality on someone else which will take away Kaido's immortality and make him defeatable</br></br>  <br>Luffy and Zoro, sure<br><br>Sanji? Maybe but I doubt it<br><br>Franky would straight-up shatter though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is definitely a more likely possibility. Less Naruto, and more Luffy-like. <br>Literally the same thing: beating him with words.</br></br>  <br> more Law shit <br>Just shoot me in the fucking head please</br></br>  <br>but he isn't guarded? unless he is pretending. so why even bring it up.</br>  <br>Not him but.<br>Roger was morst likley the strongest Haki user. Thats all strength is in OP universe. Willpower anon, Kaido's Haki just seems to be broken</br></br>  <br>He wants WW2 so he can find someone strong enough to kill him.</br>  <br>It's more a symbolic thing for me. I don't know why it bothers me, it just does. Don't judge me. <br><br>Ok, buddy</br></br></br>  <br>but that power has already been used on Shakky. Unless it was the user before even that one</br>  <br>I'm feeling that he just has broken Haki, like his body guards him regardless of what he wants. Oda has allready introduced schitzofrenia with Hakuba, pretty easy to make the jump, and makes nice foreshadowing for split personalities if cavendish shows up</br>    <br><br>It's going to be something similar in concept to roger's ability to "hear the voice of all things"</br></br>  <br>where did the shakky=immortal thing come from? because she looks younger than rayleigh?</br>  <br>No. It's really not. Pain was talked into thinking his life ambitions and ideals were wrong and changed his ways because of fucking moral speech. If Luffy befriends Kaido because he thinks his Zoan fruit is awesome, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place, and that has nothing to do with changing ideals or telling Kaido his dreams/hobby is wrong, no matter how fucked up it is. Luffy doesn't care as long as it's not getting in his or his friends' ways. <br><br>But I assure you, if Kaido does declare war and ends up fighting Luffy, Luffy will most likely beat him in a brawl rather than befriend him. Even IF he does befriend Kaido, it'll be after he defeats him.</br></br></br>  <br>That's CoO.</br>    <br> Pain was talked into thinking his life ambitions and ideals were wrong and changed his ways because of fucking moral speech <br>You mean he was beaten by words?<br> If Luffy befriends Kaido because he thinks his Zoan fruit is awesome, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place, and that has nothing to do with changing ideals or telling Kaido his dreams/hobby is wrong, no matter how fucked up it is <br>You mean he would be beating him with words?<br><br>Wow, it's almost like they're the same thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So much this, I knew it was coming but Oda simply refuse to stop sucking Law dick, and all those people who tought it was going to be a Drake centered arc.</br>  <br>can you fucking read?</br>  I think it's interesting that Kaido has such a big scar and yet cannot die<br>SOmething must have happened that caused his invinciblity</br>  <br> more Law shit <br>yes please<br> Just shoot me in the fucking head please <br>believe me I would if I could</br></br></br></br>  Westaboo no Oda does it again  <br><br>Law's fruit.</br></br>  <br>I can read the fact that in both scenarios the villain is beaten with words, can you?</br>  <br>the people's yonko</br>  <br> Kaido's Haki just seems to be broken <br>Again, what in this chapter is make you think it could be as you say?</br></br>  <br>at the very least, she's 40. That's assuming Garp was chasing her as an infant on a pirate ship<br><br>Does she LOOK like a 40 year old to you? She's likely Rayleigh's age or even older considering she was already a pirate<br><br>She looked exactly the same when Hacchan was a child https://<span>youtu.be/puIGppnqnjw?t=14m1<wbr>7s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> all those people who tought it was going to be a Drake centered arc. <br>literally nothing says it wont be except your headcannon based on what a faggot on /a/ said. kek</br></br>  <br><br>That's why I said similar in concept. It's some type of heightened armament haki that might be unique to him like rogers "hearing."</br></br>  <br><br><br>Only if Law dies for good right afterwards.</br></br></br>  <br> If Luffy befriends Kaido because he thinks his Zoan fruit is awesome, they wouldn't be fighting in the first place <br> they wouldn't be fighting in the first place <br><br> But I assure you, if Kaido does declare war and ends up fighting Luffy, Luffy will most likely beat him in a brawl rather than befriend him. <br><br>Here, forcefed to you nigger.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  law will make kaido mortal again and he will be so grateful he will become luffys nakama<br>screencap this</br>  <br> they wouldn't be fighting in the first place <br>So he would "win" the fight, as loss is being destroyed by Kaido.<br> if Kaido does declare war and ends up fighting Luffy, Luffy will most likely beat him in a brawl <br>You're fucking delusional then. He could barely beat Doffy, how would he beat the strongest man alive that can't die? Even falling from Skypiea barely hurt him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I just hope there's no devil fruit involved, the man has a completely unrelated devil fruit and is just really really really fucking lucky all the time.</br></br>  <br>such a tiny head on a big body.</br>  <br> So he would "win" the fight, as loss is being destroyed by Kaido. <br>What are you even talking about? I'm saying there's no winning or losing since they'd just be friends. Do you think Zoro or Law "lost" to Luffy because they became friends or something? <br> He could barely beat Doffy, how would he beat the strongest man alive that can't die? <br>You're reading a shounen manga bud. There will always be a way. Luffy could go gear 5 or awaken his devil fruit ability or tag team with 4 other supernovas or the armada he picked up in Dressrosa, I don't know. And again, not being able to die means nothing in One Piece. None of luffy's opponents have died, why would it matter now? If Kaido can get hurt, than that's all that matters.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Again, what in this chapter is make you think it could be as you say? <br>Every fucking page involving Kaido. you fucking retard. every fucking feat is explainable with Haki</br></br>  <br>i thought he looked like new aquaman but I'm fine with the rock</br>  <br>That'd be really odd then, 2/4 Yonko would be without a DF, that'd just go to show how unnecessary they are.</br>  <br>do it, explain</br>  Kaido for next nakama?  So Kaidou is Zeref?  <br>pretty sure, after this chapter is 99% confirmed, if you think at the chapter number it's more confirmed than before.</br>  <br> Spears break <br>Body too hard from CoA<br> Noose breaks <br>CoA on his neck and body weight<br> Torture <br>Nothing can peirce fucking CoA<br><br>How are you this fucking stupid? All of his feats are physical. If it wasn't mentioned that he was 'technically immortal' then everyone would brush it off and understand he has broken CoA Haki</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And again, not being able to die means nothing in One Piece. None of luffy's opponents have died, why would it matter now? If Kaido can get hurt, than that's all that matters. <br>You seem to be really caught up on the dying aspect, completely ignoring the fact he fell from skypiea and his only comment was "My head hurts". Luffy wouldn't be able to do shit.</br></br>  <br> Luffy wouldn't be able to do shit. <br>Again, we'll see about that.</br></br>  Things are about to get furry  <br>Probably something to do with the implications of eating a DF (for the after-life or something). Or maybe he's unlucky even trying to eat DFs.</br>  <br>So that huge fukkin scar on his body it's just for vanity? Seriously kids, i think everyone is excited as fuck for this chapter and you all are overthinking ad impute to him every, theory and delusional dream you have had during this 100 chapter of void.</br>  <br>Don't get your hopes to high anon, you're the same as those who thought Kizaru was a rokushiki master and that WB will be fruitless.</br>  He's a big guy  <br>When you're considered the strongest man alive I'm sure you'd have fought a vast number of strong people, such as the previous strongest man alive (maybe even in his prime).<br>And who knows, maybe it was when he was much younger.</br></br>  <br><br>Cheadle!?</br></br>   people actually thought Shanks was stronger than Kaido   <br>is that a nose or her blushing?</br>  <br>They both headed for Marineford but only one arrived<br>Shanks whooped his ass<br>If Kaido was that strong then he wouldn't get captured all the time</br></br></br>   tfw mysterious kitsune girl confirmed for Nakama   <br>Nose</br>      <br>Yes. Chopper needs a nurse</br>  so kaido is a little bitch boy who has been defeated AND captured numerous times<br><br>top lel</br></br>  <br>How could Shanks whip the strongest man alive's ass? He probably said "hey Kaido, go try jump off a cliff and see if it works out for you" and Kaido probably obliged.</br>  <br>You wanted Whitebeard 2.0 ? <br><br>There's obviously more to it than that</br></br></br>  <br> mfw reading this whole chapter </br>     Nobody talking about the impending incest   <br>Well considering Shanks rivals the world's strongest swordsman, has no fear of Whitebeard who beat Kaidou, and managed to prevent Kaidou from traveling to Marineford and is likely one of the 7 losses he's suffered. <br><br>Yes, Shanks is likely stronger than Kaidou, he's probably the weakest of the Yonkou considering how many times he's been captured and he's looking to be the first to go down, even an old and sickly Whitebeard did leagues of damage to the WG.</br></br></br>  <br>That's obviously a translation mistake, it's panda y'know.</br>  <br> trusting shit translation <br><br>I was more interested in the fact that Sanji didnt trip all over himself in the presence of that girl<br><br>I think Violet cured him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you will never be the inspiration for a badass anime character <br>feelsbadman.jpg</br></br>  <br> tfw you will never destroy rebeccas hymen <br>why live</br></br>  <br> Yes, Shanks is likely stronger than Kaidou, he's probably the weakest of the Yonkou considering how many times he's been captured and he's looking to be the first to go down, even an old and sickly Whitebeard did leagues of damage to the WG. <br>Why would the chapter explicitly that he is the strongest pirate alive if he's not? We don't know the circumstances of his captures for instance. He may have wanted to die, but as we know that doesn't work out for him.</br></br>  <br>Too bad she'll be from Wano and end up being tsundere for Momo.<br><br>Won't stop me from shipping her with Chopper, however. It'd be nice for the guy to get some character development and perhaps she might even trigger a "The 6th one" finally.</br></br></br>  <br>He means as his successor.</br>  <br>It's funny because Mangapanda was better than usual this week.<br><br>Yes, "shit" is better than "incomprehensible" for MP</br></br></br>    <br> Uh, hey where are you going? <br> I'M GONNA KILL THAT WHITEBEARD AND RUIN THE PLACE <br> Say, there is a really good suicide place just acros that island <br> REALLY, OH I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THAT <br><br>I doubt that Shanks actually even picked a fight with Kaidou in order to prevent him from reaching Marineford.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Past due, she's built for breeding.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind some sort of gag like that.</br>  <br>oh, they're a coming. Oda loves his gags</br>  <br>That's pretty Oda. I like it</br>  Is that one of those Shadows of Thriller Bark?  <br>Allrighhht, this arc's first sob story confirmed.</br>  <br>No doofus, it's an island. Just read the chapter.</br>  My god I've waited so long to see Brook. Digging his look.<br><br>Also, they guy he's shown fighting is a SMILE user right?</br></br>  <br>The question is, what the hell happened at Big Mom's ship? Did Sanji used his Mr. Prince gigolo techniques in order to escape from there?</br>  <br>Thriller Bark was both an island and a pirate ship.</br>  <br>They defeated Big Mom themselves and sunk her ships. Sanji or Brook is the new Yonkou</br>  Can Kaidou fly? How did he get to the Sky Island?  <br> Have a Big ass ship that can only be used as target practice for Sunny's laser beam and can only throw shitty cannon balls in retaliation <br> The Sunny can also fly to escape <br><br>I wonder what happened, anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Brook no longer has stupid king outfit <br> badass sunglasses <br>HYPE</br></br></br>   Sanj&amp;Co revealed to be in a strange location, fighting subordinates of Kaido who are looking for Samurai, Strawhats are also being stalked by a mysterious young girl with furry features <br> Kaido appears as a man who apparently has such obscene luck that death cannot touch him, has taken up attempted suicide as a hobby as a result <br><br>It's nice to have things happening again instead of just Luffy vs Doffy filler.</br></br></br>  Literally nothing happened this chapter and fanboys eat it up  <br>No, honestly, it's just an island's shore. It looks like that because the island is foggy as fuck.</br>  <br>Same way as Urogue probably.</br>  <br>He just jumped really high</br>  <br> Literally nothing happened <br><br>is this just code for 'nobody (important) threw a punch'? Not every chapter needs a battle</br></br></br>  <br> Kaido is Bambina <br><br>I can dig it.</br></br></br>  <br>Was Oda foreshadowing Brook's new look upon appearing?</br>   Brook, Sanji and Chopper are all back   <br> 10 pages of a new character showing up <br> holy shit best chapter evar </br></br>  <br> Sanji starting to attack Big Mom <br> Capone's commentary <br><br>They were in Big Mom's ship anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>you didnt answer my question<br><br>but clearly you didnt read the chapter so im not surprised</br></br></br>  <br> Not appreciating the journey <br><br>Do you want Luffy to be pirate king tomorrow?</br></br></br>  <br> tomorrow <br>Six years ago.</br></br>  <br><br> falling for obvious release day shitposters </br></br>  <br><br>Why is this surprising when Oda regularly changes the Strawhat's outfits?<br><br>It's like those people who unironically bitch about how much 'wasted potential' there is with Oda not using all of the time-skip hairdos for Robin and Nami, while stupidly ignoring the fact that Oda consistently gives them new hairdos and outfits, both during the series and color-spreads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>god dammit anon</br>  <br>Every Zoan from now on is a smile user.</br>  REKT  <br>You mean Spiral and his gang?</br>  <br> &gt;falling for obvious release day shitposters <br><br>At this point, I'm sure the baitfags are replying to themselves just to get a response.<br><br><br> &gt; <br> It's like those people who unironically bitch about how much 'wasted potential' there is with Oda not using all of the time-skip hairdos for Robin and Nami, while stupidly ignoring the fact that Oda consistently gives them new hairdos and outfits, both during the series and color-spreads. <br><br>Might as well throw in those who complain about Franky's hair style, despite the fact that he can literally change it at will.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's nice to have things happening again instead of just Luffy vs Doffy filler. <br>blackandwhitepicofahookandafish.png<wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>The main design get all the merchandising.</br>  <br>I wonder if he skipped legday too</br>  So does this confirm that Urouge is the strongest Supernova and will take Kaidou's yonkou spot as "the highest priest urouge"?  <br>He's gotta be a giant<br>Kid himself is like 2 metres tall</br></br>  <br>Why do I feel like I've seen this somewhere before?</br>  <br>Nice outfit, but why is he supposed to be another toothpick leg with a humongous body like Pica? Fuck i hate that design.</br>  <br>The zodiac foxy-girl from HxH?</br>  So uh... where the hell are Sanji-tachi? Is this Zoo? Are we starting an arc before we get to Kaido and Big Mom?<br><br>Where's Law's crew?</br></br>  <br>No it's something else. But I seriously feel like I've seen that head before.</br>  <br> an arc before we get to Kaido and Big Mom <br>Yes, it's called Wano and we've known it's coming since Punk Hazard.<br> Where's Law's crew? <br>On Zou, same as the Curly-wurly group.</br></br></br></br>  generic tattoos...generic muscles...generic size...generic scar...wow oda's character designs have really gone to shit...  <br>Oni Oni no mi, Oni's can't die and they are made of all kinds of animals. Even Oars looked like an Oni.</br>  I've just finished reading Jojo Part 5, and what the fuck happened?<br><br>It sure did deliver on the "Bizarre" aspect of the title. Holy fucking shit.<br><br>Also, eventually I just had to give up entirely on understanding anything that was happening on every Bucciarati fight.<br><br>Anyway, I'd rank the parts up to now as:<br>4 = 3 &gt; 2 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 &gt; 1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is that pic Spoiled?</br>  <br>Because  the real antagonist is not Pucci but Neo? </br>  Given enough time and planning, could RPS kid become the most powerful stand user? All he has to do is systematically take one stand at a time until he's the only stand user left in existence.<br><br>He could probably go for Aqua Necklace and Enigma first since Aqua's user can only throw  rock  and Enigma's can only throw  paper.  So he starts out with two pretty powerful stands.</br></br>  <br>You're the first person I've ever seen list Dragon's Dream as one of their favorites.
