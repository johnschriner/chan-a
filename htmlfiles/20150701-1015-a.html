Based  Y MO.</br>  <br>This one made me jump from my seat and go all 4koma guys last panel.<br>Such a great cover.</br></br>  Loved it.    <br>Some faces in that image look pretty bad, like they were done by that guy that's always distorting webms.</br>    Gee Knuckles-sempai drowning in pussy  If there's a season 2, what would you say are the chances Shuichi would end up with Kumiko?<br><br>I think the chances are high. I do not want a season 2, it would piss me off.<br><br>I wish KyoAni had just made it clear Kumiko had latent feelings for him.</br></br></br></br>  who on the B-team would you date?<br><br>Nightmare mode  no Natsuki </br></br>  <br>Asuka looks especially bad.<br><br>Hope they'll fix it in the BDs.</br></br></br>  <br>0% chance.<br>It's not an anime original, it's an adaptation.<br>Kumiko and Shuichi end up together in volume 3, not volume 2.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking cried.<br><br>I want to back Reina on the back and tell her she's special. Mai daughterfu.<br><br>Best girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, you know what I mean. If things keep going, basically. If KyoAni were to reach the point where a relationship would have been affirmed, would they affirm it?</br>  <br>Played in band in school for basically as long as that's possible, up until my second year of university, I quite liked a lot of it for band stuff but I think it was perhaps a bit too idyllic in some regards. Maybe that's because when it came to band for me, there were never a huge number of people who really wanted to be good. We WERE good and that was all. The exceptional players were popular, but not necessarily influential.</br>  <br>That looks like some WUG shit right there.<br>Thank you based Yamakan.</br></br>  <br> I want to back Reina on the back </br>  <br>second from left</br>  <br>Probably.<br>Shuichi as a character literally just exists to be Kumiko's love interest.<br>And Reina isn't relevant at all in volume 2 (besides her obsession with Taki), so it's not like she'd be an alternative.</br></br></br>  <br>why should it? it has nothing to do with the context of the show.</br>  <br>What an awful story.<br><br>Or more like, an awful supporting cast aside from Natsuki.</br></br></br>  So, was it dud gold?   "They had lots of sex afterwards."     <br>We pretty much agreed it's AOTS and if nothing surpass It on Fall it's the legitimate AOTY.</br>  GREAT SAKURAI COLLECTION  <br><br> the story is awful <br> because it doesn't ship my yuri pairing <br><br>you degenarates are ridiculous</br></br></br></br></br>  threadly reminder to not fall to the /u/ x hets made up banter and ignore the epic trolls  <br> kyoanifags unironically believe this </br>  <br>Did I mention a single word about yuri? Fuck off.<br><br>I'm frustrated that a shitty love interest ends up with a rather decent main character. I get frustrated by this very often with romance series, particularly harems. Shuichi is like a non-character, and his relationship with Kumiko/Kumiko's feelings for him are simply told to us and rarely shown.</br></br></br>  <br> no Makishima <br>I am disappoint</br></br>  Webm as promissed with higher bitrate for waifu purposes.<br>BEST GIRL<br>The other fagott is also top tier, but this one stole my heart  and dick. </br></br>  <br>Sound where, too glorious to be soundless</br>  <br>Now go back to your corner and complain about stuff being underrated.</br>  THAT WAS SO FUCKING GOOD HHNNNNNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG<wbr>GGGG</wbr>   kek euphonium <br><br>R.I.P kyoani.<br><br> I hope you comeback with amagi s2 </br></br></br></br>  <br>Somehow she looks too mature to be in that class. <br>Lipstick Oralist still better grill.</br></br>  I'm the only autistic faggot who noticed when this little thing change it's the color?  <br>Chubby</br>  <br>Megane</br>  I want one of those things with my initials from Natsuki together with her love.

I never touched an instrument but ive been on several sports competition and i have to say that the chills of this episode were real  <br>Kazuki character song:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kkx<wbr>d7ogFa2o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>First band song in the competition:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=M7n<wbr>vePt83_w</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>No makeup &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Makeup</br>  <br>well it helps that she's magically the exact same without makeup except no lipstick</br>  <br>Can I ask what that thing is? I forgot they mentioned it in the show</br>  <br>Can someone post just the bottom pic? I want to edit it into adult Kumiko</br>  <br>Ribbon chan, she's a bitch.</br>  <br>Makeup is always disgusting</br>  <br>just crop it, it's full resolution</br>  <br>Looks like a maccaron</br>  <br>Her cock.<br> Some emblem with their initals or something. </br></br>  <br>one of those stupid shits that japanese highschool girls like to strap on their phone, backpack, bag, keychain</br>  <br>Okay thanks</br>  <br>without</br>  <br>This is hot as fuck.<br> they screw up on purpose </br></br>  <br>Then they are really huge</br>  <br> Having this shit taste <br> Being a kyoanifag </br></br>  <br>AOTS of this season was Ore Monogatari<br>AOTS of next season will probably be Ore Monogatari</br></br>  <br>if they had animated that instead of what we got it would've been a lot more interesting to watch</br>  <br>Hazuki's voice is really annoying in the first song.</br>  <br>Reminds me of Seo.<br> And she's beautiful indeed. </br></br>    <br>That pout is damn cute</br>  <br>add sound</br>  <br> AOTS of this season </br>  <br>Bunch of little Taki senseis doing gestures</br>  <br>well yeah, I was specifying which season I was referring to in the phrase "anime of the season"</br>  <br>Jesus christ, Kyoani improved the character design by a lot</br>  do you still love me /a/?  <br>No.<br>But I'm glad they gave her a personality instead of just being Genki</br></br>  <br>She's always been best girl.</br>  <br>Nico what are you doing here?</br>  <br>The original designs were cute and original. KyoAni just converted them all into K-On samefaces.</br>  <br> vlc <br>but yeah, that's why I like her so much.</br></br>  <br>The original designs work well in printed media but not in animation, imbecile.</br>  disappointing finale<br>yurishit</br>  <br>Both started in the same season, so they go against each other in AOTS (unless an anime is split cour).</br>  <br>FAGOTT RETURNS</br>  <br>How would you know when you haven't seen those designs used in animation?</br>  <br>Reina looks like a fucking log with a plain face on that cover meanwhile she's breathtakingly beautiful in the show.<br>I also hate the Kyoani sameface syndrome, but damn.</br></br>  S2 when  <br>I hate that faggot, but that was so frigging cute hnnnggggg</br>  So... why did they make such a fuss about Kumiko playing or not playing that difficult passage? Sensei implied that if she was good enough, she would be allowed to play it, but they didn't make clear if she did - or was Asuka's nod the sign that they could play it together?  <br>they're supposed to be small but Natsuki made Ribbon's extra huge so it's hard to carry around.</br>  <br> breathtakingly beautiful <br> blank autism face girl </br></br>  <br>Never.<br>Amagi sold more.</br></br>  <br>looks like a huge red bong</br>  Easily AOTS.<br>I didn't think any ending could surpass Plastic Memories' this season but KyoAni did it.<br>Again.</br></br>  <br>In Kansai's contest, the one after the one they did.</br>  <br>I think I found Kanna's mom</br>  <br>The ending was easily the best part of the show. It's just too bad that the rest was so annoying and forgettable.</br>  <br>Give it a year or two at most.<br>They were really hinting at an S2 throughout the episode.</br></br>  <br>yes, how do you go from Tanabe to Knuckles?</br>  <br>Amagi will also get S2</br>  <br>Plothole Memories was shit mate.  I've yet to watch the ending because I don't feel like crying right now, though. </br>  where's that power ranking chart? Cause Drum chan ROCKED that performance  <br>Did you see what Kumiko did to Natsuki and Shuichi with her knuckles? He does that to them on a daily basis. But a little differently.</br>  <br>I actually wondered how those noises were made. I thought it was actual bells.</br>  <br>Its such a shame since I couldn't finish this week's episode out of boredom.</br>  <br>Nice bait</br>  <br>I don't know what the fuck you're talking about</br>  <br>The fuck you said about Ribbon you ape?!</br>  S2 never.  <br>she did play it, Hazuki's reactions were to everyone getting their parts right<br> Shuuichi's trombone part <br> Kumiko's new euphonium part <br> Reina's solo </br></br></br></br>  <br> posts one of five scenes where she shows emotion as opposed to the hundreds of her staring blankly/being a bitch to her bandmates </br>  <br>I'd pay to Kyoani if they would never make a sequel of this.</br>  <br>Was it just me, or did this group shot suffer from large amounts of QUALITY</br>  <br>What a faggot.</br>  is this what it feels to be euphonic?  <br>They can use the money to make official doujins of the lewd kind. This was only good for fapbait.</br>  <br>I'd pay you to kill yourself</br>  Why was Asuka so downcast the entire episode?  <br>Reina's autistic blank stare is a miracle of the universe.<br>Daughteru of the year.</br></br>  <br>In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of some phony God's blessing, but because I am enlightened by my own talent.<br><br>*tips glasses*</br></br></br>  <br> Midori... desu </br>  <br> I've been shitposting for 20 years and I still don't know what a kuudere/Dan-dere is </br>  <br>According to some animator on twitter making a 1 cour anime costs 180-200 million yen or 1.5 million dollars. We just need to find a rich guy with pocket change who likes anime.</br>    <br>Damn such a best girl.</br>  <br>It's a very long story anon. So long, If I tell it, you'll wanting a season 2.</br>  <br>No, girls with daddy issues are the worst</br>  Webm of the solo with sound please.  <br> the eye is brown above, blue below the glasses </br>  <br>just because she fits into a known stereotype doesn't make her likeable anon</br>  <br> improved designs <br> just pasted their characteristics on to kyoani sameface design </br></br>  <br> implying Rei wasn't autistic as fuck </br>  <br>So what? If we had a total solar eclipse everyday it wouldn't feel so special.</br>   biggest girl <br> plays the smallest woodwind in their section <br>also I wonder if the guy who likes braid-chan is happy</br></br>  <br>You have done enough greentexting and meme arrowing for the night, friend</br>  <br>Chuu2 got a second season, anon.

I cannot wait for the BDs  <br> taki-sensei's a fucking creep <br> loli-reina.jpg <br>literally what?<br>It's a picture of his wife you imbecile, look at the ring finger on the photo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko wouldn't be so frustrated if he said that from the beginning.</br>  I like Shuuichi.  <br>They built the tension really well in the first half</br>  How do you guys rate this anime?  <br>which episode?</br>  <br>Feels like a virtual reality game.</br>    <br> black ribbon <br>What happened to drum Reimu?</br></br>  <br>The whole episode had me on edge. The whole show may have been like a 7-8/10, but this fucking episode was 11/10 spectacular.</br>  <br>8/10<br><br>One of the best Kyoani shows in the last few years. I really liked the message and themes and how everything came together at the end. Plus it was beautiful holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Tenor sax has a super cool guy and trumpet has Kurosawa.<br><br>Then there is Grumpy-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>it reminded me of when I did competitions, good stuff</br>  <br>Is distortion-kun really fucking me over here now?</br>  <br>whiplash moment right there.</br>  <br>9/10</br>  <br> Zuka-chan voices irrelevant side character <br><br>Being Zuka is suffering</br></br></br>  Asuka confirmed for loving shitposting.  <br>It's honestly my AOTS. Probably not AOTY, but it's a contender.</br>  <br>9/10 easily<br><br>The last episode really elevated the whole show with how it paid off the hard work and struggles throughout the series with a great performance and advancing to next step towards nationals. It just felt really neatly tied together while still leaving room for more</br></br></br>  <br>This , androgyn-chan a cute.</br>    <br>Personal AOTS<br> Dropped a lot of shows this season though </br></br>  who?  <br>8/10 for now<br><br>might be 9/10 after a future re-watch.</br></br></br>  <br>that episode definitely could have used some more epilogue, it was disappointing for me</br>  <br>I saw a girl on a plane yesterday with a demure side ponytail and green eyes and I almost asked her if she liked fagotts.</br>  <br>Not quite my tempo.</br>   tfw girl friendship wins <br>Absolutely based. Thank you Kyoani.</br>  <br>Someone related to Reina probably since I thought it was her at first.</br>   all this shit taste in this thread <br> sperging over something as simple and everyday normal activity as playing instruments <br> "OH GOD I WAS SO HYPED I WAS HYPERVENTILATING" <br>Just end this summer please. I don't even mind the cold anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>SOLID<br>8/10<br>My AOTS</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty good overall, episode 8 and this one were masterpieces.</br>  <br>7/10<br>pros<br> art <br> music (occasionally) <br> cute <br><br>cons<br> forced drama <br> some characters annoying as shit <br> boring at times <br> typical shoujo stereotypes/plot <br><br>Overall a quality show and contender for AOTS because a lot of shows are terrible. It'll be forgotten soon by everyone besides Kyoanifags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the one with hearts on her hair</br>  <br>More please. If you have any.</br>  <br><br>Oboe´s tryhard friend</br></br>  <br>My heart was in my throat pretty much the entire time. If anything, empathizing that strongly with the characters makes you the opposite of autistic.</br>  <br> someone from a kyoani show since she looks like any other character in the last twenty years they made <br>fixed</br></br>  <br> I can't empathize with other human beings <br> This is fiction, why do you guys care so much?  <br><br><br>Do you enjoy anything?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, I was edge of my seat and anxiously scratching and touching my face for most of the episode.</br>  <br>Novel character, former member of the club who joins again later.</br>  Would a sequel be more serious or less serious now that they made Nationals?<br><br>And when is the next KyoAni festival?<br><br>I want them to announce Amaburi and Euph sequels.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure he enjoys shitposting.</br>  <br>Dat der trademarked KyoAnus style.</br>  <br>I feel sorry for you. Neither will happen</br>  <br> Do you enjoy anything? <br>Yes, I enjoy stories that are supposed to leave me in awe and not a bunch of teenagers playing flutes in a concert hall.</br></br>  I love Asuka!  <br>Sorry that it triggers you but the insposibility of getin gud and the competition aspect of the show got me really hard</br>  <br>As a good high test american you aren't meant to have such emotions.<br><br>These are pitiful highschool girls and of no concern for manly men. Must be autism.</br></br></br>  <br>I Can't Understand What My Lesbian Trumpet Is Saying</br>  <br> artifacts <br> tiny scaled <br>Why</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Is this a autistic kyoani circle jerk thread?<br>also this </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look again.<br>It's blue up at the top for the most part too.<br>That brown bit is just that extra eye highlight they have for this show with all the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay</br>  <br> come into thread about a show ending <br> expect people who didn't like it (and dropped it) to be discussing it </br></br>  <br>A character from later on in the novels.</br>  The next Kyoani anime will be inevitably worse than this.  <br> guy on the right <br>Who was that?</br></br>  <br>Anime isn't for you, friend.</br>  <br>I understand that it's like a sports show, but it lacks most what makes a sports anime "hyped". Look how they had to make mahjong shows using fancy effects that looks like shounenshit techniques. This show had nothing of that. It lacked visual enjoyment, other than the pretty faces and traced backgrounds.</br>  Kyon, what are you doing directing and storyboarding this episode. You should be working on Haruhi's third season.  <br>This is literally an underdog story about a group of kids who went from last place to nationals in the span of a year by working hard despite being made of amateurs, having lazy players, and having emotional baggage from the disaster of the year before. <br><br>Did you want the MC to beat up a big bad or something? Or are you just from austrailia, up really early to shitpost about this season's KyoAni show?</br></br></br>  <br>Flute-sempai who quit last year, came back in the novels and started a bunch of drama again.</br>  <br>I can hear /u/-fags screaming in agony.</br>  <br>That's a pretty good way to open a conversation.</br>   Lips-chan had a speaking part <br><br>fuck yes</br></br>  <br><br>He's scared shitless by Sakai though</br></br>  <br> I can't enjoy something if it doesn't have shonenshit power levels <br><br>What a fucking pleb</br></br></br>  <br>So I literally started watching this yesterday, but what do the LNs have in terms of Reina and Kumiko's relationship? I really doubt they were that gay in the original story.</br>  <br> People like a show, articulate reasons why <br> autistic  <br><br>Maybe learn the meaning of words before you use them anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's actually true, since  Cross Ange  ended. It made me realize why I started to watch anime and that recently I didn't enjoy it at all. I should watch older shows from my backlog. <br>Still, if you guys make several threads about this show and jerk off to how good it was, then you deserve a little bit of shitposting.</br></br>  <br>I could hear you screaming in agony during the whole series.</br>  <br>I actually expected people to give to give other replies besides "12/10 ending had me so pumped" and actually discussing about it without circlejerking to it ignoring any and all flaws it has. there was like 1 person though</br>  <br>A third of the episode was nothing but them playing and it for some reason felt amazing.</br>  There should be one more episode.<br>That was barely an ending.</br>  <br> Look how they had to make mahjong shows using fancy effects that looks like shounenshit techniques. This show had nothing of that <br>And thank fucking god for that. If you think tension can only be built with action scenes you should probably just stick to your shounen shit.</br></br>  <br>8.5/10<br>The first anime I completed in 3 years.</br></br>  <br> implying we weren't all just waiting for your inevitable downfall </br>  <br>Newfriends have their fun with a nice little show.</br>  <br>and her voice was pure sex too, sasuga</br>  <br>do you think those are articulate reason or are you just retarted</br>  <br>The build up towards the performance was just as good</br>  <br>Out of any recently aired shows, this one probably has one of the highest chances of getting an additional season, or at least a movie.</br>  <br> I literally can't into reading comprehension <br>I wouldn't enjoy this show if it had those effects. I'm just saying that it lacks everything that should make you hyped. You can enjoy it without them, but don't say things like "oh my heart was beating so fast I nearly collapsed".<br>Are you a little grill or something?</br></br></br>  <br> retarted </br>  <br><br>Are you this desperate for attention? Need some validation? Feeling like sharing your superior tastes? Name your top shows this season and your reasoning, green-text faggot.</br></br>  <br>Did you know that articulate is a verb?</br>  Is there a completed Kumiko noises webm?  Would've easily been AOTS if Plastic Memories didn't air this season.  <br>Too bad it's over and it never happened.<br>Hilarious.</br></br>  <br>What do you want to discuss? It was a bit silly in the middle with the romance stuff (I assume it was more fleshed out in the LNs), the audition drama was a bit too dramatic, and honestly half of the characters were really boring and could have used more development. Especially Asuka. <br><br>But it had a strong beginning, and a really strong end. I say it's an 8/10.</br></br></br>  <br>Asuka is perfection though.</br>  This show really wasn't anything special, no wonder it didn't sell well.  <br>No<br>No<br>No<br> this season <br>Didn't like anything this season other than Yamada-kun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you know it's also an adjective</br>  <br>1.

I would've liked a better balance instead of deceiving anime-only watchers.</br></br></br>  <br>This show didn't sell well enough for a second season because they pandered to you. Of course, novelfags (and you) know exactly how it ends so it doesn't affect me.</br>  13 episodes later and best girl finally appears.  <br>You wanted flashy visual cues for tone deaf people? Shigatsu did that not long ago.</br>  <br> Ribbon is Yano <br>Nice.</br></br>  <br>With the lips and the hair she kind of reminds me of a Rumiko Takahashi character.</br>  <br> Yamada-kun. <br>Listen here, fucko. I fucking love Yamada. I literally got an erection when I heard there was going to be an anime. It was, for a time, my FAVORITE manga ever. <br><br>But holy FUCK was the show so god damn bad.</br></br></br></br>  New OTP  <br>9/10<br>I has to be the best thing Kyoani ever produced.</br></br>  <br> This show didn't sell well enough for a second season <br><br>Stop saying this, it makes you look like a newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>They fucked up, she is a HO</br>  <br>I would rather they have no yuri implications and not try to bait other people into thinking it's something its not</br>  <br> You wanted flashy visual cues for tone deaf people? <br>No, I didn't want anything from the show, I wanted a little use of the brain from the viewers/posters in this thread.</br></br>  <br>Was that KanaHana I heard?</br>  Pleiades was better.  <br>all those secondary characters</br>  <br>I thought she was a good character, but they kept building her up as this incredibly scary person who you can't quite tell what's going on with her mind, keeping a cheerful facade and basically deflecting everything she doesn't care about. <br><br>But that only came up like 2, maybe 3 times in the show.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to call her Ryokuki</br>  <br>hibikefags actually believe</br>  <br>My bad. It's not getting a second season though.</br>  <br>it barely sold 6k with an event ticket, very mediocre if you ask me</br>  <br>I know that but it was still a good show for a secondary.<br><br><br>SHUT THE FUCK UP, SHE WAS THE ONLY REASON TO WATCH THIS SHITTY TRAINWRECK!.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This isn't how sales and funding work.<br>The end of the novels doesn't matter.<br>You're actually saying pandering to the lowest common denominator is a good thing. Wow.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's made by KyoAni.</br>  <br>How is it there are still magazine pics that aren't scanned.</br>  <br>lel, no. no one will be talking about this show in a couple of days, it's nothing memorable.</br>  <br>No. It was considerably better.</br>  <br>Let me guess, you're an Amagi faggot</br>  <br>4/10<br>Was more boring than any boring part of Hyouka. Kumiko and Reina were terrible characters.<br>Worst Kyoani post-K-on!.</br></br></br>  <br> ore-monogatari <br>Is this like semi-bait?, <br>Oremonogatari while fun to watch, and has likable characters is nothing compare to this, it's 7/10 at best<br>Stop being delusional anon</br></br></br></br>  Did you think they made it to the nationals then?  <br>The theme of this anime was neglected potential.</br>  <br>I'd say it's a 9/10 right now because hype, but tomorrow, or in a week, it's probably like a 7-8/10 for me. <br><br>This show feels like Aria in the sense that every season of Aria were good by themselves, but when you put all of them together the series becomes even greater than the sum of its parts.<br><br>I feel like Hibike similarly requires more seasons to compliment each other, to complete the experience.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter. /a/ think trainwrecks QUALITY shows are more "memorable" and thus better anyway. Fuck you.</br>  Sometimes I hate you guys.  <br>Nothing beats Sento.</br>  <br>This had me wondering why this feeling was so familiar, since as far as I can remember I've never walked onto a stage like this.</br>  <br>Newfags didn't watch that.</br>  <br>Why is that. Because there will be one in my eyes. Ot at least a movie. <br><br><br> 6k <br> mediocre <br><br>This is a very stupid thing to say, especially when anime sales are way lower than they used to be.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hi there newfriend<br>Where were you last 2 month?</br></br>  <br>Sento is already obsolete.</br>  <br>This. <br>I find it funny how the kyoani fags are trying to push this as AOTS when there's Kekkai Sensen or Fate in the same season</br></br>  Hibike! Euphonium : Zenkoku-Hen when?  So what was this Euphonium show about?<br>I forgot already.<br>I think they played in some band?</br></br>  <br>I really hope summer would end</br>  Which one of these instruments is he banging?  <br>Is she gud?</br>  <br> Fate </br>  <br>But they are. There's a lot more to remember, especially stuff that we talked about in the threads. What remains from Hibike threads? The het/yuri shitposting?</br>  Ok show, not great but it looks nice. Enjoy, because we won't be getting an S2.  <br>And that's all that show ever was, just a bunch of waifu pandering.<br>Go into any Amagi thread, literally half the people there are jerking off over Sento, and the rest are jerking off over Element girls.<br>The show was pure trash.</br></br></br>  <br>I guess I automatically have to think amagi or hibike is the best thing kyoani has produced. woe is me</br>  <br>I laughed, you missed the multiple 500+ threads.<br><br>Sento is the best character ever created.</br></br></br>  <br>Too obvious, IRC</br>  <br> Fate </br>   ITT: underage faggots whose only KyoAni shows are Amagi and Hibike. <br><br>Your opinions are absolutely worthless.</br></br>  <br>poor Latifa-chang no one jerk to her</br>  <br>Kekkai was shallow as fuck, with shit action.<br>Fate was entirely ruined because they fucked up the most important scene of the route.<br><br>So, no.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko and Reina were terrible characters </br>  <br>Look at this contrarian.<br>Euphonium is mature for mature people like you, right?</br></br>  <br>Hey,faggots. How does it feel to watch a drama about high school kids struggling for something, working for something and succeeding at something as a reward for their hard work while you all likely never got over your fears to do anything like that?</br>    <br> the show didn't sell well enough for a second season because they pandered <br>wow it's almost like you interpreted that as the complete opposite of what it meant</br></br>  <br>I wasn't really like her from the start<br>But after based novelfag told her surprisingly complicated background story i adore her so much</br></br>  <br>thats the same way any other kyoani threads are retard, but at least amagi didn't have to deal /u/ and constant shitposting about /u/</br>  <br>Nah, there's just been a few faggots who actually considered Amagi a better show, so I made a light hearted joke about it.</br>  <br>Pretty great</br>  <br>Feels like it can't be helped.</br>  <br> I prefer shit anime instead of actual quality anime because one had maymays and was "epic" <br>Kill yourself</br></br>  <br> implying I wasn't a euphonium section leader in my high school band that got top marks at state competition <br>not as many cute chicks though</br></br>  <br>maybe but they're still better and more unique than hibeshit</br>  <br> fate </br>  <br> I don't judge things on their own merit, a show is only as good as the shitposting it produces <br>Might as well just roll a dice to rate your chinese cartoons.</br></br>  <br>Sento best character in the universe. Yes, alien civilizations included.</br>    <br>I feel so relieved I was never part of anything like that, I would have buckled under pressure for sure.</br>  <br>I had to pause and take a little smoke before continuing</br>  Best KyoAni show is either Haruhi S1, Clannad, or Hyouka.<br>FMP if you're a nostalgiafaggot.<br><br><br>This show was a nice 6.5/10.<br>There was a lot of wasted potential though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Amagi fans love the water x fire yuri <br> Hibike fans get mad at yuri <br>Why is this fanbase so much worse?</br></br></br>  This show is just an inferior Yahari.<br>2/10 You can do better Kyoani.</br>  <br> actual quality anime <br>Where? Because this one certainly wasn't.</br></br>  <br>Like holy fuck it just looks gorgeous. It's art.</br>  <br> fate <br>1/10, are you even trying?</br></br>  <br>Take that Fujoshit out of here.</br>  <br> smoke </br>  <br>Sure they were.<br>But there's nothing worse than unique and creative things getting ruined thanks to really poor execution.</br></br>  <br>For what it had to work with, I'd say it did pretty well. A little too much romance, but it was in the novels, so what can you do?</br>  <br>Too bad I did exactly that.  I placed 2nd in the nation my senior year. It is both my greatest accomplishment and my greatest failure. </br>  <br>It's Kyoani, the best animators of all time</br>  Which Gurashi would you infect?

Can Lerche do it?  <br>Why don't they just all wear those unsnappable/tear-away track pants, then?</br>  <br>I really hope Lerche does the faces right, instead of just doing the generic shrunken pupils + sweat drop routine.

Meanwhile, we saw a fucking 50000 zombie horde in the comics. There's also the games and a new one about Michonne is coming out in a few months. Besides, I'm pretty fucking hyped for Fear TWD, which is pretty much the most interesting aspect of the entire zombie apocalypse - how it started, how people reacted and how the government reacted. If anything, we already survived the worst parts of the genre.</br>  <br> Walking Dead <br>shit, right? No one actually watches it, right?</br></br>  <br>Why not?</br>  <br>There's not much good zombie stuff out there, so TWD is pretty much the best we can get.</br>   Only DameDesuYo will sub it <br><br>Just fucking kill me</br></br>  I want the one with no mental problems.  <br>Isn't the TV show only a third into where the comics are?</br>  <br>You and I both know that fansubdb is horribly inaccurate before the season actually starts.</br>  <br>The show is around issue 77 while the latest comic issue is 143, so the show has covered half the comic.</br>  <br>How often do new issues come out?</br>  <br>Usually one issue per month.

I know about the zombies and so on but for how much suffering should I be prepared?

Plus no scanner. <br><br>Quite a few decent things in Forward too, if I'm remembering my series right. <br><br><br>Summer anime and people leaking out from other threads.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Manga Time Kirara Forward <br>This pretty much means it's guaranteed to sell decently if they don't fuck it up too bad right?<br><br>Kirara stuff usually does well, I hope this isn't the exception.</br></br></br></br>  I hope they don't fuck it up. This one is really nice. I expected it to be full on yuri action with lolis but was pleasantly surprised. It has its share of nice funny moments and some drama and Yuki is heartwarming.  <br>No not really. Hanayamata was Kirara Forward, don't remember how much it sold but it wasn't spectacular by any means. <br><br>The Kirara magazines have different audiences, so even though KinMoza that runs in Max sells well, this might not. Kirara adaptions have been pretty up and down in terms of sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon~</br>  <br>I see. <br>Damn there's a lot of different Kirara magazines, I never expected so many.</br></br>  <br>There used to be more but they scrapped a few, Carino (Mado no Mukougawa please come back) comes to mind.</br>  Probably far right, Side pony tail is cute as shit.<br><br><br> fang. <br>Oh here we FUCKING go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you read any manga at all? It seems like you always only watch anime and never read source material. You really should read Gakkou Gurashi's manga, it's very good.</br>  <br>Yes, please read it.

Just accept it <br><br>What the fuck are you even talking about? The chapters that get huge amount of discussion and threads are always hana centric...oh wait this is a falseflag/troll thread and the start of waves of them before the anime. Fuck this board.</br></br>  <br> fat with no tits <br> potato face head <br> best girl <br><br>hahahahahahahaha</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  <br>I like Hana but the latest chapters have kind of soured me on her. Maybe it's just because the situation dragged on for too long.</br>  I prefer tits and submissive girls therefore Meiko is my best girl. Her sweat would taste better than Hana's tea.  <br><br>OP Here<br><br>She's a close second.</br></br></br></br>  <br>no</br>  <br>What are you talking about?</br>   Angry cunt with urination fetish <br>Nah, I'll take a diamond-san</br>  <br><br>She's not the Prez though.</br></br>  <br>Wrong council, dummy.</br>  I think pissing is a shitty fetish, and gross.<br><br>But Hana is best girl, and I would let her piss on me. My love for her is boundless.</br></br>  <br>You better get your bitch ass down somewhere, niggah. Don't come here talking about that Hana shit.</br>  <br>No shit. Beside her, Risa, Kate, and Meiko are the only interesting females in the series.</br>  Kate a shit  <br>Nah Homie. You don't want that broad. She's got the signs of basic bitch. <br> This the gal you want. </br></br>  <br><br>She's a psycho bitch and a fag.</br></br>  <br>Bitch, yo mama took a gigantic one, and your faggot ass appeared on this planet.</br>  I should start reading it now, shouldn't I?  <br>That ain't gay, that's prison life, no lesbo.</br>  <br> silvio <br>Every time</br></br>    Every girl is best  <br>If you don't want to be anime-only fag, then yes, you should.</br>  <br>ahah I thought the same thing. I think akira used tha tname on purpose</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>Nah, hana is only better than mari and that really isn't much.</br>  <br>Man, cherry pop is flexible, and can work her tongue too.</br>  <br><br>Is that some kind of insinuation?</br></br>    Who will be the first one to give Kate the D and convert her into a good straight Christian Lady? Probably won't be kiyoshi since he'll probably be juggling hana, chiyo, prez and maybe even risa once v.prez takes andre away from her.  <br><br>Why would you want to convert her? She's perfectly fine as she is, being a psycho-bitch aside.</br></br>  <br>Maybe a new bad boy character appears and pair bonds with her like Bonnie and Clyde.</br>  <br>I'm guessing Joe, because he's the harem MC in this manga.</br>  I have a piss fetish and she still isn't best girl. All the girls are nice in their own ways except Kate anyways.  <br>Motherfucker, Kate's always crazy for some bedroom action. Besides, How is Mari nice on her own way?</br>  <br>Glad to see there's still hope with some pp.<br><br>Fucking caveman OP!</br></br></br>  <br>Kate is so insecure that it's insecute, put pictures of Mari into your shoelocker and tomorrow they'll be gone and replaced by Kate's nudes. Talk about how you want to sniff Mari's butt and suddenly there is the Prez farting around you and sticking her cheeks right to your face just to top her.</br>  <br>Why isn't that a counter trap?</br>  Loved the last chapter<br><br>It is so full of bromance</br></br>  <br>I think I've seen that girl on the top left somewhere or atleast the artstyle and for some reason it's giving me a boner.</br>  <br>Ootsuka Reika author of Mida Love and Dororicchu hentai tanks. You probably already read the Somersault! chapters</br>  <br>If that shit happened, I'll probably puke all over Hana. <br>Insecurity is what makes the girl easier to stick with you, after you let her know how pretty she is.</br></br>  <br>No need to worry, pal.<br>Cherry Lady's league got your back.</br></br>    People who deny hana greatness= people who think sakura was the best female  <br>But. Sakura is the best girl</br>  <br>finally got his own manga, eh? probably means we won't get any h content from him anymore.</br>  <br>which sakura are you referring to?<br>because I seem to recall hana being a tsundere and a popular shit sakura being also a tsundere<br><br>A TREND</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mida Love was pretty good though. specially this chapter. I just hope his mainstream manga gets translated though</br>  So I see Meiko isn't the only one who got her bust size increased in the anime...  <br> Has perfect, modest, palmable breasts <br> Anime gives her cowtits <br>I can't accept this.</br></br></br>  <br>and she wasn't even THAT flat, as a matter of fact her perky breasts suited her better.</br>  <br> he prefers Moeko to Meiko <br> he doesn't want to be submissive to her <br><br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter?</br>  <br>chapter 128 volume 13</br>  <br>Thanks anon.</br>  <br>Meiko didn't get her bust size increased</br>  <br>it's the flat fags trying to demonize mature female breasts.</br>  <br>She did in the mango tho</br>  <br><br> his </br></br>  <br>The pink shit one</br>  <br> no interview video <br> no floating images <br>yeah.

They aren't the best but they aren't bad</br>  <br>holy shit</br>  <br>Chiyo looks like a burn victim</br>  <br>That's what's bad about them, their adaptations are not impressive, they're predictable and mundane. I don't mind them adapting average shit but Prison School? I have a feeling it will be lackluster.</br>  <br>What are you talking about? Their adaptions this season were pretty good. Have you seen DanMachi or Food Wars?</br>  <br>have you seen dai shogun?</br>  <br>No but that's an example from a year ago</br>  <br>moeko is literally the worst girl</br>  <br>Both DanMachi and Shokugeki no Soma are pretty meh.</br>  <br>The adaption or the story/characters themselves? I haven't read the manga or whatever for DanMachi but I think everything beyond the actual story is good. Food Wars is a pretty great adaption though I can understand people calling it repetitive.</br>  <br>That's the source material's fault. JC Staff adapted them both pretty well.</br>  <br>SnS is great.</br>  <br>Didn't they add more Hestia?</br>  <br><br>You know who Tsutomu Mizushima is?</br></br>  It's over.  <br>my weaboo level isn't that high,what does it say?</br>  <br> For some reason they put white lines over the screen. <br> Heh, I guess that's how it is. </br></br>  <br>Yes, JC staff did the bare minimum. Shaft took the boring Monogatari LNs were nothing happens and turned them into gold, KyoAni took turds like Haruhi, Lucky Star or K-On and made adaptations that surpassed the source material. The problem with JC staff is that they put no effort into them.</br>  <br>So RAYS OF LIGHT all over the damn place for them blue ray sells, eh?</br>  <br>As in the anime scenes?<br>Fuck that. Now there's zero incentive to watch.</br></br>  <br> turd like Haruhi <br>But it was already good before it was adapted.</br></br>  <br> Not expecting censoring </br>    <br>FUCK!</br>  <br>I wonder. There isn't even much they could censor the first episode.</br>  <br>Mizushima tweeted a while ago complaining about how there were limitations not only on images and words, but on sound effects, too.<br>I guess he must have been trying to direct around these to avoid invasive censoring, but eventually the dipshits at the TV station must have done it anyway, prompting him to go out like that and say it's not his decision.</br></br>  <br> there were limitations not only on images and words, but on sound effects, too. <br> limitation on sound effects <br>What the fuck?</br></br></br>  <br> Hana Hook <br><br>Look at her works.</br></br></br>  <br>Can't submit the delicate japanese audiences to unko.mp3</br>  <br>Those armpits HNNNNNG</br>  <br>Somebody clean this pic!</br>  Anyone has a good hana wallpaper for vita?  <br>If this thread or another Prison School thread is up later i'll clean it up the best I can and post it</br>  <br>looking forward to it.</br>  Isn't the anime also airing on pay cable? If that's so, it might be ok there.  <br><br>You better deliver, Anon.</br></br>  <br><br>Clean this dude's.

Man, there is something magical about the first couple of volumes.<br><br>Also loli Hori is great.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>It was troubling for me as it was best boy saving worst girl from best girl.</br>    <br>It's definitely in the top 5 delinquent manga in my opinion.</br>  <br>Best girl is Toiro, that much is carved in stone, my friend.<br><br>Second best girl is the one who can see the future. I like Sera but she's just too fucking unstable.</br></br></br>    <br>Toiro isn't exactly the poster child for stability either though, we just know her reasons while we don't know what makes Sera what she is</br>  So many chapters translated in the past week.  <br>Just read all of this, it was good, thank you.</br>    Obligatory and beautiful  <br>just like my mexican soap</br>  <br>it seems to progress steadily</br>  Next chapter better have officer lady  <br>For Sera I think it's a mix of her father dying and her need for an enemy. Also she's a bit of an otaku and enjoys imitating what she sees. <br><br>Toiro on the other hand has more of a valid reason. She seemed very nihilistic to begin with which is because of what I assume continued acts of  rape  .<br><br>Until she breaks and your picture happens. <br><br>I really want Toiro to have a bigger role in this manga, but I can't see her having that with  her already dead. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hatarakanai Futari</br>  <br>Did any new chapter came up?</br>  <br>axed</br>  <br>Nothing @ google search, tittle please.</br>      <br>you could at least try to read the filename</br>               Don't actually read this   Nice happy manga with feel-good ending here lads, yep certainly no infinite despair.  <br>Why would you say that? Read everything by Mizukami, it's all entertaining.</br>  <br>There's so many things that filename can imply...<br><br>Unless it's actually called QP.

Want to make me pick up the LN. It's just that the manga ended on such a fantastic note that I feel that any addition will ruin it.</br>  <br>It at least had closure and explained most of it in a generally non-retarded way, though i am still mad at deus ex mama and the fact that MC had nothing to do with the defeat of the big bad.</br>  <br>Another great picture.</br>  <br>I keep putting off reading this because I want it to be all scanlated before I start but every time I see something from it I keep wanting to read it. <br><br>It's a shame they'll never animated it with based Daisuke Gori reprising the role of Edajima in it.</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br><br>Is it me posting about this manga that it has gotten more noticed here?

Second half was still fun, but it just felt a bit off to me. The elf MMO wasn't nearly as interesting as the original MMO, Kirito's fairy avatar sort of sucked and big titted sister wasn't nearly as likeable a sidekick as Asuna. It was nice to see Yui return and have a larger role though. <br><br>Death Gun arc is okay, but it's a bit disappointing that all the previous characters haven't really been doing much. Especially Asuna. I'm hoping she'll return to being the action chick she was instead of just the girlfriend who does nothing. <br><br>Also, what the fuck is up with Kirito's avatar in GGO? Hoping it'll be explained why it looks so feminine and how it's apparantly a rare character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> someone posts not-/a/ related pic <br> he must be a crossboarder!! <br>I've been here for 5 years, "oldfag", sorry not to fit in your delusions you have about /a/</br></br></br>  <br>this cancer infested /v/ and /g/ as well</br>  I almost killed myself during the S2 second arc.<br><br>I didn't learn from S1</br></br>  <br>/v/ has been cancer for years now, newshit.</br>  This scene was just bad and awkward. <br><br> Actual sex implication <br> Asuna confirmed slut <br> Virtual reality fucking period </br></br></br></br>  <br>2 YEARS OF SEMEN</br>  <br> Sleeping with your boyfriend makes you a slut </br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/filena<wbr>me/1429958174521.jpg/<br>I wonder why someone would bring 3DPD reaction images and their garbage memes to other boards and then pretend to belong to the board.</br></wbr></br>  <br> I've been here for 5 years, "oldfag", sorry not to fit in your delusions you have about /a/ <br>sure dude<br><br> All images and resulting discussion should pertain to anime or manga. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Is this real?</br>  <br><br> if you don't follow the rules you don't "belong" to /a/  <br>How does it feel being no fun allowed faggot?<br>Must be hard</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accel World <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Nope.

So it's not too farfetched for someone living in the VR world 24/7 to master all the tricks of the game and git gud.</br></br></br>  So who here got Progressive 2?  <br>I had mixed feelings about that arc.<br><br>Did they have to throw in all the drama to end the series on?</br></br></br>  <br> I can take out 50 other players alone just because I'm that good! <br><br>The gear she's using to dive is literally the best full dive gear that exists and she's spent more time in VRMMOs that the SAO survivors<br><br> Kirito can take out 200 players alone because he wields Excalibur <br><br>He ends up getting killed though. All he did was buy enough time for Asuna and friends to break through the party in their way and get into the boss room<br><br> this entire show is fucking fake <br><br>Fair point but they're bending the rules in order to help tell the story. Is it poor writing? Debatable</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can write pages upon pages of what I found wrong with the characters and story, but as far as an action show goes it was pretty decent aside from some of the scenes in the gun arc. Although there was so much unintentional comedy during those scenes.</br>  <br> Any words on S3? <br>One of the producers said he'd like to see it animated. I guess that's a good thing?<br><br> Are the latest books translated yet? <br>All of them are translated...

I know we still have EG, but it's like the series ends today instead of a new chapter. I'm not sure why.
