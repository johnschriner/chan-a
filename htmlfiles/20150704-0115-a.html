[ I hope Vergo and Monet will comeback to save Doffy for the claws of evil marines.  <br>I wholeheartedly agree with you.</br>  Isshou is probably the most morally upright non-civilian we've seen.  <br>I hope Monet comes back and joins the Strawhats.</br>  <br>You're supposed to say no, because Monet is dead and Vergo is in pieces, so we can start aguing and launch the discussion.<br>But still, thank you for agreeing with me. I pray they're all gonna be all right.</br></br>  <br>Captain T-Bone?</br>  All lower executives in the same cell otherwise Sugar will be raped.  <br>Because he's a civilian who got pulled into this.<br>I can't wait to see Akainu's reaction to everything that happened. It won't necessarily be a negative one (unlike the Gorosei's) but it would be very satisfying if it were and he ended up clashing with Fujitora.</br></br>  <br>It's quite obvious by now that the next cover story will involve vergo and monet on PH eventually making their way to dressrosa, and en-route chancing upon the marine ship detaining doffy and friends (or at least, everyone but doffy as doffy might get taken into separate custody by someone)</br>  <br> he ended up clashing with Fujitora. <br><br>they're buddies though. It'll probably the same way Sengoku's conversations with Garp tend to go.<br><br> You were supposed to bring them to Justice, Fujitora <br> &gt;Oh. I suppose I messed up, didn't I? <br> &gt;Sorry 'bout that. <br> *sigh* </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dellinger's not safe either.</br>  <br>The only faggots in One Piece are the Okamas though, but they're nice people. He's fine.</br>  <br>Dead people don't get cover stories</br>  Where is Sanji?  <br> It's quite obvious <br>No it's not, but it would be very nice if it were.<br>It will be probably be some random shit we don't expect though. Not that I'd mind  unless it's about Jinbei </br></br></br>  <br>Dressrosa just re-declared itself a pacifist country. Doflamingo isn't getting free because he'd be able to take over again in a day.</br>  <br>Do you think it matters in prison?</br>  <br> Dellinger ends up becoming the prince of NewkamaLand <br><br>Wow I never knew I wanted to see that happen</br></br></br>  <br>Shit, meant to reply to </br>  <br>He probably has an anus dentata, he'll be fine. Actually I'm more worried about the guys they're going to put in his cell.</br>  <br>He will like it, Sugar is pure.</br>  <br>Doffy would just pull a Crocodile and be 'uninterested in' Dressrosa anymore</br>  <br>Crocodile was only interested in Alabasta as a stepping stone towards bigger plans. With those plans dashed he's got no use for the place anymore. Doflamingo would still absolutely have desire to rule his rightful throne.</br>  <br>She's 22. Did her mind develop into an adult's or did it remain the same?</br>  <br>Someone draw this<br><br><br> Doflamingo isn't getting free because he'd be able to take over again in a day <br>One Piece is about Luffy crushing his opponent's dreams/ambitions instead of taking their lives. Doffy's not going back to Dressrosa. Ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait a minute, is Smoker the only one who could of informed the marines of Vergo being a traitor? Is there a chance they don't know yet?</br>  <br>There is a chance indeed but it's very small and practically inexistent.</br>  <br>speedreader?<br>akainu already mentioned getting an "annoying" report from smoker, that report definitely included vergo being a traitor</br></br>  Yesterday I came across a guy saying jokingly that admirals and important people are huge because it's Usopp telling the story of their travels and so it's exaggerating. <br>But what if it's really like that? Maybe not usopp telling the story, it could be someone reading the ship's log or something (but would impel down/MF be written down on the log?). <br>Do you think oda would pull off something like this at the end? Personally I think it's not gonna happen, but who knows. It could be pretty cool though</br></br>  <br>She is a childish adult.</br>  <br>Her whole character is being more mature than she looks.<br>What do you think ?</br></br>  <br>As if anyone would let him come back<br><br>Fujitora would kick his ass faster than he could say 'birdcage'. Whether he'd want to come back or not, the next time he mentions it, it'll be to say he doesnt care about the place anymore. Just like how he didn't 'feel like' fighting Kuzan on PH</br></br></br>  <br>The humans are big because they're big. Their physical heights have been mentioned by the characters themselves several times. People just grow that tall.</br>  <br>Well it isnt Usopp telling the story or he'd be the biggest, strongest member on the ship after Luffy</br>  <br>There have been instances that make me feel like One Piece is a story being told over in the future. Scenes such as pic related as well as the end of Marineford talking of future events portrays this, so it'd be cool if it were.</br>  <br>Now that I think about it, Vergo was probably the type of soldier Akainu liked too, ruthless and dedicated to absolute justice, or at least looking like it. He must have been assblasted.</br>  <br>Has anyone ever questioned the height of some characters? It seems to me they just take it as granted. An i don't remember anyone saying "I just grew tall". <br>But I know, oda uses hierarchical proportions, I just want to know if anyone in the manga ever thought there was something strange with huge people<br><br><br>Kek, you're right<br><br><br>I think it would be cool, too. But who knows? Maybe in 15 years we will find out</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that scene when Usopp uses a haki ability to help scare the shit out of a little girl just reaffirms why he's my favorite character.</br>  Doflamingo will be assassinated by CP0 to keep Mariejois' national treasure secret.<br><br>Trust me, my Dad works for Oda.</br></br>  Guys what if Oda dies before finishing One Piece  <br>Nami will get married to Tashigi.<br><br>Trust me, my Dad is Oda.</br></br></br>  <br> Usopp <br><br>That's God Usopp.</br></br></br>  <br>He said he already has the important parts of the story on paper. <br><br><br>Why you like Precure more?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oda's life support is One Piece. The moment it ends he will probably die, no longer needed in this world.</br>  <br><br> he fucked the farm girl <br><br>The bloodline lives!</br></br></br></br>  So now that it's basically over, who else absolutely loved this arc? I don't give a shit that it was long. It was fucking great.  <br>I liked it the whole way. Fourth favourite arc for me.</br>  <br>I wish we'd gotten to see more of Pica's personality besides him getting mad at being laughed at<br><br>I do love that so many characters were introduced this arc. You just KNOW Oda is going to flesh them out a bit and i'm looking forward to more Blue Gilly and Ideo</br></br></br>  <br>I wish Rebecca was useful</br>  <br>It had the potential to be a great arc but some parts dragged it down for me. But I still enjoyed it as a whole and think it is one of the better arcs of the series.</br>  Soon.  <br>I really liked it. I think they could have cut down on the gladiators and Rebecca sucked but that's really my only real problems with it. I really could not stop waiting for the next chapter (Unlike a certain fishy place where I stopped reading for a bit). All the flashbacks were well done too</br>  <br>It was alright but after I reread it without any weekly breaks this is most definitely in the top 3 arc list.<br><br>I don't know why im so excited to see the new bounties. <br><br>The anticipation is killer.</br></br></br></br></br>  So.. Chopper's family initially rejected him because his nose was blue?<br><br>Why the fuck do a bunch of reindeer care?</br></br>  <br> I don't know why im so excited to see the new bounties.  <br>Because it's been years since the last time they went up.<br>Because New World bounties after the 2 years will be very high.<br>Because God Usopp being recognized as Sogeking.<br>Because Soul King's official mugiwara bounty.<br>Because Chopper's bounty still being low.<br>Because Okamasanji bounty is coming.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to see Kaya jizz herself after seeing 2 different Usopp bounties.<br><br>God Usopp<br>Sogeking</br></br></br></br>  Can someone tl;dr this arc for me because I lost interest and wanna see if it turned out the way I thought it would without reading it  <br>Doffy ded</br>  <br>it was great, imo top 3</br>  <br>I dunno, couldn't a Pacifista already recognise Usopp as Sogeking on Sabaody?</br>  <br> monkey d luffy evolve to gorilla d luffy <br> 1 arm law <br> zoro is actually weak as fuck <br> new admiral is a pussy <br> robin is mad sexy <br> viola is mad sexy <br><br> rebecca is a cry baby bitch <br> usopp new power is broken <br> fairies exist <br> franky is a bro <br> doffy is over hyped garbage <br> kaido is actually a midget <br> new crew member makes unbreakable barriers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What big event is going to happen in 800? Will a big event even happen in 800?<br><br>100 = Reveal of Dragon<br>200 = Luffy manages to hit Crocodile<br>300 = Fairy Vearth is revealed to be the Moon, Skypiean war is declared over<br>400 = 'You gotta steal keys off CP9 members' and the pairing off of Strawhats and their CP9 opponents<br>500 = Reveal of Silvers Rayleigh<br>600 = Strawhats fucking around at Seabody before reuniting after the timeskip<br>700 = Reveal of Buggy as a Shichibukai (and a tease to the 7th one) and reveal of Doflamingo having the Mera Mera no mi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>and choppers bounty WILL stay low.<br><br>I mean he didn't do anything in this Arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Shouldn't Brook's bounty be very high? I mean, he should be an incredibly famous bad influence for thousands of fan in the world.</br>  <br>Upon a reread, the tournament actually goes too fast it feels.<br><br> tfw we haven't had bounty updates (excluding Luffy) since Enies Lobby way back in 2006 <br>Shit, its almost been a decade.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>some of these are not really big events, people really should stop assuming that Oda plans groundbreaking twists or reveals everytime he hits the next full hundred</br></br>  <br> Will a big event even happen in 800 <br>Big<br>Fat<br>Mom</br></br></br></br>  <br> Actually thinking Bartolomeo or anyone else from this arc will join </br>  <br> yfw Oda ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi <br> yfw it takes a 50 year hiatus <br> &gt;yfw it still finishes before Berserk </br></br></br>  <br>Reindeer are cunts.</br>  <br> actually thinking Binami won't join the crew </br>   look for info on the latest SBS because apparently it's big <br> Oda makes a joke about strict mothers and all translations stop, conversation devolves into "Oda is a misogynist pig" talk <br><br>Is there any place that reliably keeps up with this shit other than AP?</br></br></br>  <br>We already have a dead person on the crew.</br>  <br> Zoro is actually weak as fuck <br>Anon pls.<br><br><br>200, 400 and 600 doesn't seem big at all. So, going by that pattern, 800 is probably going to be something 'meh' as well.<br><br><br>He's an influence as a singer, not a pirate, right ?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I kind of want this to be true, but I kind of don't, but I don't know</br>  <br>It will happen in the next cover story.</br>  <br>You're so stupid lmao.<br><br><br> Anon pls. <br>hehe</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He's an influence as a singer, not a pirate, right ? <br>he's a very famous and admired singer who was revealed to be a pirate; this is being a bad influence at its finest</br></br>  <br><br> Will a big event even happen in 800? </br></br>  <br>They're right though, that answer sucks balls.<br>I can understand where he's coming from from a strictly literary standpoint but that doesn't make it less shit.<br>But to answer your question I just read it on the wiki. I usually go to reddit for the SBS translations but apparently they're having their own drama and I couldn't access their One Piece parts.</br></br></br>  <br>I honestly don't remember any of his songs but I thought it was about being lively and shit. And the most piratey thing he did was say Luffy was going to be the ultimate pimp at the end of his singing career.<br><br><br>I can see Big Mom's arrival or something along those lines but I doubt it's going to be as huge as people make it out to be.</br></br></br></br>  What will the next arc be?<br><br>Will it be a flashback arc about the sidelined crew giving them their own arc in the spotlight and show what they were doing?<br>Will it be about the same crew members we've been seeing going to rescue the others from Big Mom?<br>Some new unrelated arc?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obviously not going to be an unrelated arc. I think it's most likely going to be the same crew members going to meet up with Sanji &amp; Co.</br>  I stopped reading the manga sometime ago. I stopped at Fishman Island and have only caught up now. It's been bothering me now that if Law arrived earlier at Marineford, maybe he could've used Shambles on Ace if he got close enough. I'm not sure. I just needed to get that out of my system. Thanks.  <br>He might not have been strong enough back then and if he switched out Ace, Luffy would have gotten skewered.</br>  <br>i'd laugh if Viola joins the crew and Usopp's new power becomes overshadowed</br>  <br>I'm hoping it's a meanwhile arc with the other crew. I want to see the sidelined members. Especially Brook. I don't think we've seen enough of him and people are already talking about adding a new crew member. I mean he joins and then the crew immediately break up then the one Fishman arc then he's disappears the next arc.</br>  <br>Maybe Chopper in his 'human' form gets his own bounty, just by association with the Strawhats (as well as possibly 'He was also at Eneis Lobby')</br>  <br>He couldn't make himself too conspicuous back then. He was lucky Doflamingo was on the other side of the island playing with Crocodile.</br>  <br>Probably the Strawhats + associates making their way to Zo real quick to meet up with the Heart Pirates and tie up all the loose ends before going onto the next thing<br><br>I'm hoping that the next chapter begins with the Strawhats having to escape, so that it's made clear whether Fujitora wanted to let the Strawhats go or they just managed to get away while Fujitora was busy apologising and getting Doflamingo's crew<br><br>As for next arc I'm thinking either a Big Mom rescue the rest of the crew arc or they go straight to Kaido</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was obviously just a reference to Rudolf the Red Nosed Reindeer and how all the others shunned him for having a red colored nose.</br>  <br>So he would've switched out Ace and Luffy at the same time<br><br> is what I thought</br></br></br>  <br>Again, he just may not have been strong enough. Before the Timeskip, he was just playing around with little marines but after the Timeskip he could easily create big enough Rooms for Marine Ships. And honestly, why would he care about Ace ? He was a D, sure but he was tied to Whitebeard. Luffy was the free spirit.</br>  <br><br><br>Or he could have just switched akainu away</br></br></br>  <br>I'd guess the other crew are fine cause Big Mom is mother to that warthog woman from Thriller Bark Nami befriended. They meet and get on good terms then the Kaido arc dealing with the fallout of destroying his fruit supply.</br>  <br>The WG probably knows how zoans work,that the little pet they gave the 50 beli bounty is actually a zoan user, and will give chopper an appropriate bounty. <br>Whats more likely to happen is that the WG just misidentifies his fruit and assunes hes a reindeer man whos just some really ugly dude who can turn into a reindeer. Or for comic relief, the WG identifies his fruit as a tanuki or racoon zoan.</br></br>  <br>Sentoumaru knows that Chopper is the monster they witnessed. Since he's a marine now it's probably known to them, its just that no-one's got an update since Enies.</br>  <br> next chapter deals with sanji and the rest <br> starts with: meanwhile off the coast of dressrosa <br> the sunny floating between a sea of debris and bodys <br> a shadow standing at the the bow <br> nami, chopper, brook, momo, and ceasar cowering together in fear <br> barely able to whimper a single word "S-Sanji?" <br> the shadow starts to move "Sorry you had to see me using "That"" <br> he rushes back below deck in shame, his suit in his arms but otherwise completely naked <br> a single dress and a makeup set remain at the bow </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They're right though, that answer sucks balls. <br> I can understand where he's coming from from a strictly literary standpoint but that doesn't make it less shit. <br><br>You know-<br><br>  I usually go to reddit <br><br>Forget it, I don't even care anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A lot of people are resorting to coming here because le reddit is down.<br><br>I'm one of them.</br></br></br>  <br> I usually go to reddit <br>Oh for fuck's sake.<br><br>Arlong Parkers, tumblrinas, and redditors.<br><br>No wonder One Piece threads have been shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because they're friends with Lola doesn't mean they'll get off easy - Lola is likely not even on Big Mom's ship</br>  <br> 4chan threads are known for quality </br>  <br>Don't act like a piece of shit because better sites are down.<br><br>I can't believe I came back to this shit hole.</br></br></br>  OODDDAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  <br> better sites </br>  <br>Lola doesn't have to be on the ship. She gave the Vivre Card to them and wrote her name on it.</br>  <br> redditor vistis 4chan  <br> gets a hissy fit when told he is not liked  <br>jesus christ</br></br></br>  <br>Would it be possible for an admiral to resist Shambles??</br>  <br><br>You guys are still the same as ever.</br></br>  <br> actually thinking that person is from reddit </br>  <br> They're right though, that answer sucks balls. <br> I can understand where he's coming from from a strictly literary standpoint but that doesn't make it less shit. <br><br>I don't see the hang up on dead moms when there are a lot of dead/deadbeat dads as well. I'll try to list everything off the top of my head:<br><br> Luffy, no bio mom so far and doesn't know his father, Dadan is a good foster mother for a mountain bandit <br> Zoro no parents <br> Usopp's mom died of illness and his dad is a deadbeat nigger who was never there for his family <br> Nami has dead mom, guess you can say Genzo is a cool/dad uncle figure <br> Sanji has no parents but a father figure <br> Chopper's father figure died and his mother figure is still alive <br> Robin's dad died before her mom <br> Both of Law's parents died then his 2nd father figure died <br> Both of Franky's parents abandoned him then his 2nd father figure died <br> Scarlet <br> Otohime <br> Drake had an abusive shitty dad who died <br> Both of Ace's bio parents are dead, the person who he considered his true father kicked the bucket too <br><br>But apparently according to some translator there's a Japanese wordplay joke in the kanji for "adventure" and "mother" that I'm not getting that makes the answer more punny in Japanese.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I wish we'd gotten to see more of Pica's personality besides him getting mad at being laughed at <br><br>We did, it was the whole reason he attacked King Riku because Doffy told him the battle would determine the king, then he was telling Riku that his ideologies and being peaceful were pathetic.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't see why and how it could be</br></br>  <br> mothers are known to be overly protective  <br> fucking oda is a fucking mysoginist prick this place sucks balls why do you defend this cis shitlord </br></br>  <br> Reddit <br> Better than 4chan <br><br>Yeah nah not when it's riddled with tripfags, karmawhores and social justice warriors.<br><br>Also Arlong Park is just as cancerous you guys worship your admin like a god. Some of you tards even considred your admins fan fiction of Trebol to be canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was thinking Haki, but I'm not sure. I've read somewhere that you could resist Law's ability to a certain extent with Haki, but since I can't remember where I read that, I can't be sure how reliable it is so, as I said, I'm not sure.<br><br>I was thinking Law's skill is OP as hell, but you still need to create the Room and it eats up stamina (and life force!?!) so I guess it's fine...</br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo or Vergo had said in the past that Vergo's haki could resist being cut by Law. This is no longer the case with Vergo as Law has honed in on his skills and haki to a greater extent, however perhaps higher-level haki users would be able to.</br>  <br>Feels like too much stalling not to have something big on 800<br><br>the "fight" between luffy and doflamingo was doffy getting raped a bunch of panels and people pushing the bird cage.<br><br>I assume it's definitely yonkou related. I think showing all of the strawhats captured and a dead  lol yeah right  sanji would be a great last page for chapter 800</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What if Logias turned into their element inside a room ? Like, would Law have to transport each individual light particle or something like that ? I don't know how science works.</br></br>  <br>It was when Tashigi fought Law and Smoker told her her haki wasn't strong enough to fight him with his devil fruit.</br>  <br>Law has radio knife for logia users. They can't reform for a certain period.</br>  <br>In his fight against the sticky fruit which he thought was logia at the time he said that there is a certain point he can split them up where they can't reform.</br>  <br>That doesn't answer my question at all but, uh thanks. I guess. I was thinking what would happen if the User was not near him because, iirc, Radio Knife has been close-combat, right ?</br>  <br> fathers aren't known for being overly protective </br>  <br>Yeah it has to be close combat but you also have to remember splitting up is the worse thing for a logia user. Just gives you more target to hit.<br><br>See caesar vs luffy or more specifically vergo vs smoker.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy couldn't punch Trebol even with Haki. I remember Luffy wondering about that. And then Law split Trebol with his detached arm, right? Using Takt?</br>  <br>yeah<br> fishing trips <br> camping  <br> car trips  <br> hunting </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I suppose it depends on the User since Gas and Smoke are kinda mass scale compared to the Admirals. And I guess an Admiral would still evade the attack by splitting his own body or something. Thanks though.</br>  <br>That's cause he wasn't logia. He was punching regular goop not Trebol's body. Law split him cause he lucked and hit his real body under the goop.</br>  <br> taking trips means fathers arent over protective <br><br>what? the fuck is your point?</br></br></br>  <br>Ahh, I see. Thanks, anon.</br>  <br>that mothers are opposed to those "dangerous" things while fathers usually are not <br>women usually don't have that sense of adventure men have</br></br>  <br>Surely it depends on the person ?</br>  <br>both mothers and fathers are opposed to 'dangerous things' in regards to their kids</br>  <br> &gt;fishing trips <br> &gt;camping  <br> &gt;car trips  <br> &gt;hunting <br><br>do Japs even do these things?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>read all the posts and rethink your answer <br><br>well to me it seems that women are not that adventurous but who knows, maybe I am wrong but there is surely a reason fathers are more chill when it comes to those sort of things</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because of testosterone or something ? Or maybe it's a society thing ?</br>  <br>They fish a ton. Like it's a big past time.</br>  <br> that mothers are opposed to those "dangerous" things <br><br>I dont think women are opposed to those things so much as those are all male-typical activities that women have no interest in</br></br></br>  <br>What are you saying, it's in women's genes to be compelled to stay in that place called kitchen, it's the only place where they feel safe and useful. While men are all climbing mountains and adventuring and shit, hell, I'm /a/nons love adventuring and going in the outside world, more so than staying in front of their computer.</br>  not to derail the thread too much but women have a natural predilection to nurture. There is a reason they have a term called "soccer moms" They want to protect the kids as long as possible. And it's not a bad thing.  <br>ok buddy</br>  <br>I thought they were called ''Soccer mom'' just because they got their kids to the sports game and back.</br>  <br> a natural predilection to nurture <br><br>that's a parent thing, not a women thing. Parents generally get sick of their kids when they stop looking and acting like kids. That's a nature thing; we're all prone to wanting to protect cute things which is why we take in puppies and kittens so often but get rid of them as adults</br></br></br>  <br><br>This<br><br><br><br>It's bull, both men and women have that predilection to adventuring http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2<wbr>013/01/125-restless-genes/dobbs-tex<wbr>t<br><br>By the way Oda seems to forget he created many adventurous moms, like Nico Olvia or Bellemère.</br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did I hurt your feelings ? Sorry bro, still, you should take a stroll outside.</br>  <br>there is nothing about gender in that article</br>  <br>maybe that's a point to consider?</br>  <br>No way bro.

And they can put themselves back together on their own. So if Law passes out after you've been sliced, are you like that for good or will your body magically put itself back together?

It's just that there's more examples of the opposite. Maybe it's a cultural thing where absent dads and overprotective moms are more prevalent in Japan, and kids over there can relate better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and still nothing in those links is showing mothers keeping their kids in while fathers let them go</br>  <br>They are too, but are way more liberal than mothers.<br><br>Mothers wouldn't let you get hurt not dirty ever if they could.

Rest in peace, as I will see your sister off, as well.</br></br>  Why is she wearing Taiga's clothes in UBW?  <br>Eat your fish, Shinji.</br>  <br>She's happy he will be able to rape her soon.</br>  <br>I'm sure most people just think of it as "Sakura's outfit" and forget the small detail of where it came from. <br>I don't think I've ever seen Taiga actually wear that outfit, even in fan art.</br></br>  Why is Sakura feeding Shinji happily?<br>He raped her.</br>  <br>Sakura enjoys being fucked by Shinji and is happy she'll get to be screwed by him again, but he'll only be able to ram his worm in her after he's feeling better, so she's trying to help.</br>  <br><br> This scene is so fucking stupid. They look like two healthy, stable and sane siblings teasing each other.<br><br>They had the chance to turn this into something really sad and depressing (but believable) by showing that just because the show ends, doesn't mean every conflict is resolved and an ending doesn't necessarily equal a happy ending for everyone. But instead they took the Disney way out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nasu wanted to make UBW stand out on its own without having to connect to Heaven's Feel. Since they went the RN route, Shinji has never actually raped her, and we know Shinji becomes a better guy after UBW.</br>  <br>Because UBW, is the Shinji/Sakura route anon. <br><br>Which at least has the benefit of having a nicer Shinji, instead of Fate where Sakura is stuck alone with grandpa Worms.</br></br></br>  <br>I dl'ed Realta Nua instead of the older version, did I make a great mistake?</br>  <br>No, if you use the right patch, you can switch between censored and uncensored stuff.</br>   Sakura gets a pseudo incest end in UBW <br><br>The route that keeps on giving.</br></br>  <br>I got the patch from Beast's Lair.</br>  <br>You're good then.</br>  <br> I only watched Carnival Phantasm <br>What the fuck?

Any help?</br></br>  <br>調子に乗る</br>  <br> 調子に乗る <br><br>Agh, thank you! So then the な makes it a negative command? Something like "don't get carried away"/"don't get cocky"?</br></br></br>  <br>調子に乗る = to be elated; to be excited; to be caught up in the moment; to be carried away; to get cocky<br>調子乗んなよ basically means "Don't fucking get excited". The whole sentence would mean something like:<br> Don't fucking get excited because I'm also going with you. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, don't get carried away works better on second thought.</br>  As a newcomer who has lurked in /djt/ threads for a while: would you recommend doing RTK first and then grammar + a core deck, or just disregard RTK entirely and learn kanji from vocabulary?      <br><br>Thank you! But I'm still a little confused as to how this grammar is formed. Does this "んな" contraction happen regularly with negative commands in casual speech?</br></br>  <br>ん is a (failed) contraction of る and な. You can use it with verbs that end with る (ichidan or godan)<br><br>こっち来んな！<br>さっきから蹴んな！<br><br>it does this because る tends to disappear when you say things quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In certain levels, he's not a normal part of the cast.</br>  なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

Shouldn't it be "it has rained"? Isn't 降る one of those verbs?  <br>Because it implies he's above the beginner level that's he's set with this audio, and not on mount stupid, while simultaneously putting others down for not having practiced listening.

Or I mean, it obviously is not. But it seems like it should. Being similar to 降りる, 上る et.c. How do you tell?</br>  <br>Because he listened and realized that he can't even understand a children's story.<br>so he's trying to tell other people that they're in the same boat as him.<br>it's a fact that what he's saying is true.<br>but he's dumb as shit for giving this much of a fuck about it. find the transcript, anon, learn what they're saying, listen again, and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 9 out of 10 retarded japanese learners <br>what an official sounding statistic</br></br>  <br>B called C and A was negatively affected by it?</br>  <br>I think he means intransitive. Where 木の枝が折れている isn't "trees branch is breaking", but "tree branch is broken, and remains in that state." <br><br>I don't know all the rules to that, or if there are any rules. Just keep in mind that ている has a few functions. <br> ing 食べている "eating" <br> continued state　結婚している "married, and still am" <br> sequence of actions for movement verbs 行っている "went, and is there now" <br><br>At least that's how I understand it. I could be wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know of a particular rule or a resource that lists them. I think you just need to read a lot and figure out which is meaning is more commonly meant.<br><br>降っている leans towards "raining" to me, but I'm not a native.</br></br></br>  <br>This is another case of people wasting their time in this thread trying to be superior to others for no good reason.<br><br>It's two things in action: The "suffering" passive, and the common construction of に電話する "To call on the telephone"<br><br> AはBにCに電話された。 <br> Cに電話された <br>C was called<br> AはBに <br>By B, to A's displeasure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Passive, causative, etc. you fucking drone.</br>  <br>This sentence really does throw me off though. A being the subject　he's the one calling C right. And B is the one making him do it?</br>  <br>That's easier.</br>  <br>ている can mean that in verbs that involve a change, and if the object is still in the final state of the change. Like 降りる means to go from somewhere high to somewhere low, in other words a change. So if the person is still in the low place after having descended, you can use ている. But the change in ふる is not when it stops raining. It is when it begins raining. The change is going from no rain to rain. Therefore, to use ている one must be in the final state of the change, which is raining. Therefore "it is raining". If it had stopped raining, we would no longer be in the resultant state and ている can not be used. Only た.<br><br>If you want to say "It has stopped raining" using ている you must find a verb in which the change is going from rain to no rain. For example 雨が止んでいる</br></br></br>  <br>So pretty much the same as everyone else here who spend their time looking for ways to project and put other people down, exactly as you have just done?</br>  <br>No it's not. <br>Even less so for an English speaker. It is objectively more complex. <br><br>I wish Tae Kim never shut down his forum. You sycophants really need to fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just say that there are too types of verbs: action verbs and state verbs.</br>  <br>two*</br>  <br>You objectively have to learn more to know how to conjugate all the different verbs into past tense. I wish people would stop nit-picking Tae Kim as if that somehow made them better.</br>  <br>Watch out. C was indeed called. But not by B. He was called by A and the one who made him do it was B.</br>  <br>Conjugation is not the hard part at all. It's the mindset for a way saying things that just doesn't exist in the English language that's hard and that's exactly what the causative form is.</br>  Do many of you have speaking partners? I'm looking at the only link for it in the guide but I really haven't tried speaking japanese yet and don't feel like fucking up royally to someone I can barely understand.  <br>How many times are people going to fall for this one? It's unnatural Japanese, no one is going to speak like this because even natives think it's confusing.</br>  <br>Not true. No one is making anyone call anyone. Maybe you are confusing passive with causative form.</br>  New to the thread. Why is Rosetta Stone not listed as a learning resource? Just curious so don't sperg out.  <br>I fully agree with you, also the mix of 使役受身形 is really annoying as well. Conjugating verbs is just, well, conjugating verbs.</br>  <br>If you translate it literally it means Rain is falling. In english, the verb is "to rain" itself, but in Japanese 降る is the "falling" verb, which the rain is doing.</br>  <br>whats a roseta stone?</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Tae Kim makes some pretty huge mistakes in his guide though, at best misleading and at worst completely wrong.<br><br>For example something as simple and essential as the は particle. In his guide he states:<br><br> The 「が」 particle identifies a specific property of something while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. <br><br>This is horseshit and it made me misunderstand the は particle for like a whole year into my study, until I happened to come across this video and saw how much it conflicts with the info I got from Tae Kim: http://www.gwu.edu/~eall/vjg/08part<wbr>iclewa/08particlewa.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are far better resources that are recommended over it, for one.</br>  <br>Japanese isn't Spanish.</br>   tfw can't learn Japanese anymore <br><br>I kept starting and stopping and now <br><br>I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter.<br><br>College is over and so is high school so there are no girls or bros to use it on.<br><br>It'd take me three fucking years to get decent at it. By then I'd be 25, which is essentially an old man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>If you spent the time you wasted on that post learning instead, yes you could learn Japanese.<br><br>"You miss 500% of the slam dunks you never take" - Albert Einstein</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oNf<wbr>2BbLj5W0</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>This is mostly wrong.<br>Some verbs can go either way like 落ちている 飲んでいる and it has nothing to do with when the state changes. It depends entirely on context.</br></br></br>  <br>it depends what you want to learn Japanese for.. like if you languages then why not keep at and have fun. If you want to know Japanese to one day live in japan then you should for sure keep trucking</br>  <br>Yes, exactly, conjugation isn't difficult. That was Tae Kim's point. That the rules you have to learn to conjugate to past tense are the most complex in the whole language, and they're not complex at all.

You're all wrong because it doesn't even make sense in Japanese. The two に particles are awkward as fuck. Apart from my good friends mom here who is still thinking about the sentence.

I guess it gets harder then, but that doesn't deter me tbh.</br>  http://homepage3.nifty.com/park/asp<wbr>ect.htm<br>Here is a very interesting discussion about the various interpretations of ている.</br></wbr>  <br><br>Whats makes it bad, exactly?</br></br>  <br> I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter. <br>Isn't this a myth? I'm a business major and from what I've seen people will learn languages at any point if it means making more money via international partnerships. I'm talking people in their 30s and 40s.</br></br>  <br>So, it's like the complete opposite of what TK says?</br>  Aiming for N1 in December, but I feel like I have to improve my grammar quite a bit to make that happen. I've tried making grammar decks in Anki before but never managed to make one that works for me.<br><br>How does DJT use Anki to study grammar?</br></br>  <br>No it's absolutely 100% true, how could you think otherwise? Everyone knows that after you hit your mid 20s your brain turns into stone and is totally unable to learn new things. That's why everyone is totally justified in blaming their lack of learning on being "too old", it's clearly not an excuse in any way.</br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>Are you trolling, or?</br>  <br>well once you hit your mid twenties most people dont care about you anymore so it really does suck honestly</br>  <br>I'd post my autismbux.png if i was at home.<br>Where OP admits that he dreamed the sentence up and it didn't come from native media.<br>I fucking told him it's confusing as fuck even to a native.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I prefer to read native material while slowly go through grammar resources (JLPT textbooks, DOJG, Imabi, among others). If I need a grammar point clarified while I'm reading, I just refer to the DOJG or Google or this thread.</br>  <br>That's clearly sarcasm.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say he's right, but he's not entierly wrong either. This is always brought up in lingustic courses together with "language acquisition" and yada yada yada.</br>  <br>I grabbed the DOJG deck from the COR and went through it slowly, while still reading stuff in Japanese. That way I made sure I went through all the essentials, while still looking stuff up as needed when encountering them in "the wild"</br>  <br>It definitely is true to a certain extent.<br>Native Japanese speakers who wait until they're older to pick up English will almost always be unable to distinguish between Ls and Rs no matter how much they try.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that, and my friend told me she thought her Japanese was embarassingly bad for not understanding it at all. Heck even I didn't think about it being off and thought I could translate it.</br>  <br>Stop that shit, you want to turn this into DJT: Misinformation General</br>  <br> Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that <br>The authors of DOBJG sure did.</br></br>  <br>I got a copy of Rosetta stone for free so I started there for about three or so days. During those three, days I learned nothing about the fact that there are three different alphabets, nor did I learn about the many particles and grammar rules that make sentence structure so different from English. What I did learn, is how to say and read (but not right) Boy, plane, and "The dog is under the table" all of which btw only takes 3 mins to learn with anki flashcards.<br><br>So while there are many ways to go about learning Japanese, Rosetta Stone is not really an option unless you never want to reach fluency</br></br></br>  <br>Post the entire page.</br>  do not attempt to speak/write in kansai ben <br>You end up sounding like a stereotypical Chinese man speaking semi-broken English trying really hard to sound Southern</br>  <br>せやろか？</br>  <br>The whole L and R problem for Japanese speakers is true, and I've been Googling to see how age affects language learning ability, and as far as I can tell, it does get more difficult to become bilingual the older you get.</br>  <br>I'm practising for N1 aswell, I'm only studying with the Kanzen Master N1 grammar book right now.<br>1 lesson per day and there's 20 of them.<br><br>Nihongonomori is a good ressource too, it's somewhat easier when a person is explaining a grammar point sometimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone correct me if I'm wrong<br><br>But I'm under the impression that that style of learning is only effective if you don't want to read/write japanese, only hear/speak it.<br><br>In other languages the two might be very closely correlated since you don't have thousands of characters to learn,<br>but it's completely ineffective if you ever plan on reading/writing it.<br><br>and most people in these threads care about reading japanese above all the other skills, so rosetta stone isn't a good option</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't do this to me.

However if you're trying to build something on top of nothing it is going to be confusing at best and grossly inefficient at worse. We're not babies - we don't NEED to learn like them. Adults have the ability to think abstractly which is a powerful tool in helping to remember things (see mnemonics + comparisons), whereas babies / children pretty much HAVE to brute force memorize things via hearing them repeatedly.<br><br>I haven't used the program properly myself, so I can't comment on any specifics, so maybe look up some reviews yourself if you're interested for some reason.

In the car sentence, the friend is performing a direct action on the car, whereas in the Merry one, two passives are being stacked, which shouldn't be possible. Furthermore, in , (8) is completely different from (9) grammatically because in the former, 横に denotes a location, not another passive; thus, (8) makes sense whereas (9) does not.</br>  <br>For 2-3 days set your new cards to 0 and just review.</br>  <br>That one is a especially bad case because Aに電話する is a set expression that means "To call A on the telephone". That's why I said that  has two different uses of に in the same sentence. The first に is to mark the agent and the second に is part of the set expression. It's a bad choice of example sentence and just causes needless confusion.</br>  <br>彼は彼女に彼女の浮気相手に電話された<br>make sense.</br></br>  <br>It works for me.</br>  <br>Seems fine to me.</br>  <br>But I don't understand what purpose 彼女に serves in that sentence.</br>  <br>I think I'll do that actually.

Or archaic Japanese. <br>let's not get ahead of ourselves tiger</br></br>  <br>Okay. So your girlfriend is performing the action. The action being "you getting called by your girlfriend's lover"? What?</br>  <br>I'm just curious, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong by looking over the differences/evolution in time of the language.</br>  もしもしDJTくん僕の名前はバナアド  <br> you getting called by your girlfriend's lover" <br>Not that guy, but she called her lover. You're affected by the event, although you're not a direct participant.</br></br>  <br>The action is that she calls her lover (that's not the speaker so an adulterous lover). It's a bit tricky to translate:<br> My girlfriend called her lover and I was troubled by it. </br></br>  <br>バナアドさん、元気ですか？<br>ホモセックスしようぜ？</br></br>  <br>Do you mean "she got called by her lover"? Because in that case, I can sort of start making sense of it. So what it's saying is sort of like, "My girfriend, the rotten cunt, fucked me emotionally by getting called by her lover" And yet it still doesn't seem right because you're making it sound like direct harm to you was done by your girlfriend whereas she didn't do anything directly, she was just called.</br>  What's the different between が or は?  <br>No. She called her lover, not the other way around. The passive is to make the speaker seem negatively affected by her actions.</br>  <br> No. She called her lover <br><br>But this can't be the case. You would need to use を for that, like in the car sentence.</br></br></br>  <br>The other way around. Because 彼女に is first. Like the link from dobjg said earlier.<br>"My girfriend, the rotten cunt, fucked me emotionally by calling her lover"</br></br>  <br>There are plenty of resources for classical japanese, but the fact that you can't find (let alone read) them yourself means that they'll be useless to you at your level.<br><br>As for dialects, they're blurry and constantly changing.

At max Ill have to spend 10 minutes looking up words but often I only spend 2 to 5 minutes trying to understand everything. (I don't use the text hooker because the interface is ass.

You will also build willpower by resisting the urge to masturbate even though you're surrounding yourself with erotic materials. <br><br> The lewd scenes eventually started to appear, but I was determined to resist and protect my testosterone from destruction. It was my only way to stay passionate, energized, and focused on studying. My only way to learn Japanese. <br> Even reading the simplest things required every ounce of willpower I had. I wasn't sure how long I could sustain the effort without bursting apart. It seemed like the only thing holding my mind together was my one desire to learn Japanese. The intensity was maddening. After resisting masturbation for so long, even a basic eroge became a desperate struggle for survival. <br> I thought I had everything under control, but then the lewdest and most arousing scene imaginable seemed to appear out of no where to claim all of my Japanese progress and my testosterone. <br> Normally it would have been child's play to quickly masturbate and calm my mind, even though it would have come at the cost of my passion and focusing ability, but after resisting masturbation for so long it took everything I had AND MORE. <br> Then something just snapped. Something inside of me.  <br> "NO! NO MORE! THAT'S IT! I DON'T CARE!" <br> I didn't care anymore. I didn't care about the lewd women. I didn't care about masturbating. I only cared about reading. I only cared about learning Japanese. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Hey I am from 4chan <br><br>You guys crack me up.</br></br>  What does 付き合ってくれる人 mean exactly?  <br> willpower <br>nice meme breh<br>just pop an adderal</br></br></br>  <br>A parson who do something with you</br>  <br> Adderall without willpower <br>That's a recipe for passionately shitposting and researching weird shit for 12 hours straight.<br><br>Adderall without willpower is like shooting a nuke at a random location.

For otariids and some phocids like the harbor seal, mothers fast and nurse their pups for a few days at a time. In between nursing bouts, the females leave their young onshore to forage at sea. These foraging trips may last anywhere between a day and two weeks, depending on the abundance of food and the distance of foraging sites. In a match-to-sample task study, a single California sea lion was able to demonstrate an understanding of symmetry, transitivity and equivalence; a second seal was unable to complete the tasks. They demonstrate the ability to understand simple syntax and commands when taught an artificial sign language, though they only rarely used the signs semantically or logically. In 2011, a captive California sea lion named Ronan was recorded bobbing its head in synchrony to musical rhythms. The mating system of pinnipeds varies from extreme polygyny to serial monogamy. Of the 33 species, 20 breed on land, and the remaining 13 breed on ice. Species that breed on land are usually polygynous, as females gather in large aggregations and males are able to mate with them as well as defend them from rivals." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Rain Man pills</br>  can anyone tell me the Kanji on the left side of this i cant see them and this is the biggest pic i could get.<br>1 this girl is big.<br>2 This boy is tiny.<br>3 this is the story of the 2.(or does couple fit better)</br></br></br>  <br>I can't read it, but I want to shit post.<br><br>So it's basically LoveCom but ghetto and shitty.</br></br></br>  Minna~<br><br>Daijobū desu-ka?</br></br>  <br>Suck it, Zayn</br>  im just asking for a little help ive seen people do it with dragon ball all the time.  <br>Repeat it in かな、名ファッゴッと</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127514528 <br>plz no</br>  <br> かな、名ファッゴッと <br>I can use Google Translate, too!</br></br>  Any Nico Live suggestions?

I could see an election arc as the finale  with the MC winning at the very end as tweest. </br></br>   The manga is over 1000 pages of cute high school wife shenanigans  <br>God bless Japan and how hard they cater to my dick.</br>  <br>What's he doing?</br>  <br><br>She got bit by a snake and he's sucking out the poison</br></br>  <br>Checking for lumps. Breast cancer isn't a fucking joke man.</br>  <br>Well, if they did that, it would be open ending where no one wins. It would actually be kind of funny because Hayato does the cooking, cleaning, and general housework, so he is actually kind of the wife in the relationship with Ui.<br><br> Though it wouldn't work with Rin since she is the one cooking and cleaning after her sister. Though she admits that Hayato is better than her in some ways <br><br><br>Sorry to disappoint you, but Rin becomes a main character and cockblocks Ui with a ton of her own fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it would be open ending where no one wins <br>It could go both ways. Where he actually chooses one after he wins.</br></br>  <br>that looks way the fuck cuter than OP. Need to read this now for sure.</br>  <br>After being around Rin a lot he starts developing a huge attraction to big boobs. He also starts noticing her other qualities and that she isn't just a walking pair of big tits.<br><br>Which makes Rin like him more since behind his ogling, he actually cares about her.</br></br></br>  god if rin doesn't win i will kill myself<br>either that or her older sister</br>  <br>You know what? Good for this guy. It's rare we get a protag willing to suck on some available tits right out the gate.</br>  Picked up.  nigger the fuck aren't there subs yet<br>what is this shit</br>  <br>I was going to pick this up just based on the premise and initial synopsis, but this is a whole new level of adorable lewdness. Forget just picking this up, I might fucking BUY it.<br><br> captcha asks to select all images with cakes <br> itt </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for DDY if you don't want the streamrips that'll inevitably go up, though of course DDY doesn't have a translator assigned to this, it'll be a stream script edit with typesetting. RAWs are already up, so give it a day or two for them to work shit out and put their release out.</br>   all these people who aren't reading the manga <br>source material is usually always best so don't ignore it</br>  <br>Anon, I can't bury you over the internet.</br>  It's so sad that the one anime I've actually read the manga for before it's aired is a fucking ecchi.  <br>I can't wait for minamoto-kun monogatari good god that will be glorious</br>  <br>Looks like Rin has more fans than I thought. Here I expected to be the outlier. Like many, I started because of the antics of Ui and Hayato. When Rin appeared, I didn't like her, but after 40 chapters she is the only reason I still read the manga.</br>  <br> It's so sad <br><br>It's a nice thing to me.</br></br></br>  <br>That's getting an anime? Fuck me it's gonna need like a dozen seasons to cover that shit. Shit moves so fucking slowly.</br>  <br>Nigger, they've TL'd it already. <br><br><br><br>I've got one hand refreshing their website and the other lightly stroking my dick to keep it at half mast, waiting for the subs to come out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it doesn't have one yet. But I don't think it will be too long before it gets one</br>  <br> streamrips <br>It's one step short of uncensored hentai, neither CR nor Funi will have the balls to touch it. Only fansubs can save this show.</br></br>  <br>What is sad is that the crappy anime art doesn't touch the awesome manga art. Also, it is a 10 minute anime so it is clearly aimed to sell more manga, which is good side the manga sells poorly for such a good manga (in Japan)<br><br>The manga was close to getting cancelled, so this is nice.</br></br></br>  <br> 10 minute anime <br>fuck this shit<br>im out</br></br></br>  <br><br>newshit central</br></br>  <br>The manga is just so much better anyways.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is not allowed on this board...</br>  <br>no nipples are visible faggot<br>areola don't count</br></br>  <br><br>It's 8 minutes.</br></br>  <br>the hype is dead</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127469355 <br>Okay, but one of their TLCs could have just agreed to TL it.<br>Fansubbing isn't some sort of professional job -- things can and do change at a whim all the time.<br><br>This is how the conversation likely went:<br>"Okay so a simulcast still isn't up.

Pretty standard yet bonerific romcom. Ui (I swear looks like Shinobu from Love Hina) and Misato are cute.<br><br><br><br>I did see nakata yumi's works on sadpanda. was this (http://exhentai.org/g/20217/94a4e5<wbr>fc16/) one an alternative version of the manga before the supposed revamp, a mistagged work, or something else I'm not catching</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough of them are translated.</br>  I feel like this sums up most reactions to this episode.  <br>Hah.<br>No.</br></br>  <br> Would you have kids with me, then </br>  <br> Hah. <br> No. </br></br>  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Mori, how could you break an anon's heart like that.</br>  <br>Just scroll up, you'll see exactly how I did it.</br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why is this so goddamn funny. Holy shit I can't stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry Tyrone we will never see a proper Okusan series animated</br>  I can't believe people honestly prefer Rin to Ui. I'm not saying Rin is all that bad, but Ui is far cuter. Ui also feels like an actual character and not just generic tsundere #7586  <br>What I can't believe is people thinking Rin has any chance of winning only because she's the heroine rival.<br><br> Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced <br><br>Of course, it's a fucking love triangle but in the end she'll lose. Hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ui also feels like an actual character <br>Like an early middleschooler maybe.</br></br>  <br>No wonder she;s into anal</br>  Reminder they will never ever fuck in the manga  <br>Do Japanese women like having fat asses?<br> slim figure <br> cute hair <br> cute face with/without make up <br> THICK FUCKING ASS  <br>I'm already dripping, too bad this doesn't exist unless she has a black parent or something</br></br></br></br></br></br>   subs never   <br>Please, we already know DameDesuYo is pretty bad but translating an 8 minutes show is still a challenge for any subber.</br>    <br>So, you're not going to watch it then?</br>  <br>Will DameDesuYo is actually going to do a timely release for this? <br><br>They still haven't released Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika above episode 6 despite it's a 5 minutes show. Thankfully CR/HS exists for that show.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, they are pretty unreliable in terms of quality so I tend to avoid them but Anime de Wakaru was an editing/typesetting nightmare, which may be the reason why they ended up dropping it.<br><br>In any case, the anime will cover everything that's been scanlated so I guess you could read the manga and watch the raws.</br></br></br>  Where's the lactation  <br>This was actually the first show I watched raw. Felt weird and I barely caught half of what was said but it felt nice to see the start of the new season with everyone else.</br>  <br> dropping it. <br>They've always announced when they've dropped something. So more like permanently stalled.<br>Though it took them 18 months to do that show with the flags, so who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>Arata did something similar to 8 girls while the others watched</br>  <br>Picked up. FUCKING PICKED UP.<br><br> j/k I will watch this when the BD is released and only when this is decent enough. </br></br></br>   picked it up thinking it's just a cute, short anime about wife shenanigans <br> he touches her breast <br> that's okay I suppose <br> mfw it escalated to full blown breast sucking <br>I'm not complaining or anything, but god damn that caught me by surprise.<br><br>Off to reading the manga I go</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I will watch this when the BD is released <br>Why?

The context of the photo was from Chapter 40 of Okusama<br><br>Summary<br> <br>-It is Hayato's birthday, and Rin is at a loss of what to buy him<br>-She goes to her sister for advice, and her sister goes into a rant about how sex works, freaking out Rin.<br>-Rin sees Ui in the hallway, and Ui decides to help her buy Hayato's present<br>-Ui points out that Rin's greatest asset are her huge boobs<br>-So Ui forces Rin to the lingerie section and tries on Babydoll underwear<br>-Ui gets irritated that it looks so good on Rin and she tries some on too. It ends up being a disaster<br>-They both end up buying Hayato a shirt for his birthday<br>-He thanks Rin and Ui together, and Ui gets uncomfortable that Rin is getting closer to Hayato.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br> Beautiful people can't be perverts <br>That's bullshit<br><br>Proof:  myself </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup, Ui has big boobs (around E-Cup-ish), Rin has bigger boobs (G Cup)<br><br>The only reason why Ui looks small(er) is because she has Rin as her rival, when she really has big boobs herself.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I so want to feel my fingers sinking in them Rins</br>  <br>Oops, forgot to post pic.<br><br>Ui has big boobs too, Rin's just outclass her by 2 cup sizes.</br></br></br>  <br>was this on found on sukebe.nyaa?</br>  <br>Hayato did, and because of it he started getting obsessed with big boobs. To the disappointment of Ui who feels so inadequate next to Rin.<br><br> In volume 7 Rin and Ui find Hayato's porn collection on his computer, and to Ui's dismay, and to Rin's pleasure, they find that he has a big collection of porn featuring big breasted women. Since then Rin has been less shy and more aggressive in going after Hayato.<br><br>Which is why if you like Rin, the newer volumes is awesome because she gets a lot more fanservice.</br></br> </br></br></br>  how do we get this animation studio on a full episode ecchi?  <br>Call Xebec</br>  <br>Absolutely fantastic</br>  <br>Xebec are too damn scared to show nipple sucking as TLR proves. Call up Production IMS.</br>  <br>Yeah, so that's why even if Rin loses (almost certain), it is a great ride because Rin becomes a lot more aggressive and the series gets raunchier than the first couple of volumes.<br><br>Rin realizes that Hayato has feelings for her too, and so she uses her assets (big boobs) to her advantage when she can.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm not sure this is a series where they'll go for a single winner (if any)</br>  <br> Production IMS <br>Only if you want to wait months for the BDs to make anything visable.</br></br>  <br> wanting QUALITY <br>I haven't even watched Shinmai BDs yet, just don't think it's worth it.<br> That said I still like IMS because they did Twintails. </br></br></br>  <br>Someone should call PoRO to make animate and ecchi anime series.</br>  <br> TV anime with PoRoface <br><br>No thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Hayato is definitely has a thing for both Ui and Rin now. Ui notices that Rin is starting to get more attention from Hayato. Rin realizes that she has a lot of advantages with Hayato that Ui doesn't have. Rin is also a lot more aggressive in trying to go after Hayato.<br><br>So either having either a Ui or Rin end would be hard, since Rin has developed a huge following (pun intended) in Japan for the manga readers. There are also those who like Ui's personality more. <br><br>I see either a stalemate where no one wins. There is also the possibility where there could be two winners, since Rin and Ui have developed a good friendship, so "sharing" Hayato could be a possibility.</br></br></br></br></br>   Chapter 23 <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Come on, the winner is basically spelled in the title.</br>  <br>Are the raws available somewhere?<br> I think the fucking post stole my shipment again and it's still a month till I get back to Japan <br><br><br>It doesn't always work like that. Also, Ui can be his wife while Rin is his concubine</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They could always pull a big plot twist and have Rin become student council president.<br><br><br>Nope, I also subscribe to Comic Rex, so I am getting it from the newest issues. There is no Okusama in the newest edition. <br><br>Guess Yumi Nakata is busy doing cover art and promotional art for volume 8 and working on chapter 41 to publish it in this month's edition. I think Rin will be on the cover for volume 8, which is cool since the last time she got a cover, she got a really racy one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This is total otaku trash and i'm falling for it.  <br>To be fair, the lead character is an awesome guy and you can't help but want Ui or Rin to get him since he is such a good catch.</br>  <br>Pretty much every ecchi anime then with few exceptions.<br><br><br>Watch the OVA at least.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> yfw thats not a hentai </br></br>  <br>Ooh la la. You really know how to get my attention, anonymous.</br>  <br>What's wrong with their face? Their animation quality is good, so it's all good.</br>  <br> I see either a stalemate where no one wins. <br>Ui has the default advantage, has title of manga, is living with MC, is one with the promise. <br>When push comes to shove there is no way the MC will be picking Rin realistically.<br>The longer this goes on the saltier the fanbase is going to get, the author is a baiter.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It is a shonen, think about that for a second. It is aimed at middle school and high schoolers. <br><br>Which probably explains why Rin's boobs are far bigger than the big breasted rival in her Seinen Manga. I mean, Ui's boobs are bigger and the buxom rival in her Seinen series. To be fair, her seinen series is far more raunchy than Okusama.</br></br></br>  <br>I will gladly take the salty ending because it is a fun ride, Rin's fanservice is almost up to Ui level, so it makes it worth it. You can always pretend the last chapters didn't happen (like Negima)</br>  <br>Is that Rin?<br>The drawing looks a bit rough</br></br>  <br>No, that is the buxom rival in her Seinen series (which is also a love triangle)<br><br>I just wanted to illustrate that both Ui and Rin has bigger boobs in the Shonen series than her seinen one.</br></br></br>   Ayana doing lewd sounds <br>Yes!<br><br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>No, Rin puts all the other Nakata Yumi women to shame. That isn't Rin.</br>  <br>Stop lying anon.<br><br>We all know that you are not  a pervert, only beautiful </br></br></br>  <br>So big boobs confirmed as a fetish for children?</br>  <br>More like they gave Rin and Ui unrealistic proportions (at least for most women) while in the Seinen manga the sizes are a little bit closer to reality.</br>  <br>But you already had Ako doing lewd.</br>  meh<br>sucking nipples in Japan is like saying hello in occident</br>  <br>I wasn't expecting that, a bit lewd sure but not that.<br>I wasn't disappointed though, just surprised a good kind of surprised.</br></br>  https://www.mangaupdates.com/author<wbr>s.html?id=6244<br><br> Female </br></br></wbr>  <br>Is this her?</br>  <br>If it is then she's pretty good looking.</br>  <br> making a fuss over this shit <br><br>Qwaser did it first and better too</br></br></br>  <br> Qwaser <br>Too cowtits for my taste</br></br>  <br><br>Yup that's her, Former hentai artist, not manga-ka for Okusama Ga Seito Kaichou. She does a lot of fan signings in Japan and draws chibis of your favorite characters.</br></br>  <br>Oops, I means to say "now manga-ka"</br>  <br>Damn! What chapter is that in?</br>  Someone tell me twintail-chan gets lewd  How come spanish subs are already out but not english ?  <br>Nope, only the titty monsters Ui and Rin.</br>  <br>Well, go fuck yourself and everything, DFC-chan ;_;</br>  <br>Nigga is you serious.</br>  <br><br>Because you didn't search Nyaa.</br></br>   there actually are people who believe rin has any chance of winning <br><br>Really, guys?</br></br>   not reading her other manga in the meantime <br>I SERIOUSLY hope you guys don't do this.</br>  <br>I know DDY's subs tend to be Engrish-y but that's a harsh insult Anon.</br>  <br> No subs <br>Who do I gotta smack to get some goddamn English subs?</br></br>  <br>Texas has 2 times partner.</br>  <br> sensiblechuckle.gif </br>  <br>No real character development (well what do you expect for 8minutes), humour or storytelling about it, just a bit of unfunny hentai really, not even giving it 3 episode rule, dropped</br>   the other members of the student council get no lewds <br>this is dissapointing</br>  <br>They have like one or two chapters each. It's something.</br>  <br>From the title I was hoping this was going to be a middle aged man with a high school wife. I am really disappointed. I bet that shit happens in japan all the time why can't they just make an anime about it</br>  <br>Yeah, her name is not on the title.<br><br>She is fucked, not literally. They will probably introduce another guy to woo her over.</br></br></br>  <br>This reminds me of that hentai manga with the guy and his loli wife.</br>  <br>She has as many chances as  Onodera. </br>  <br>good trigger</br>  <br>Which was my jam.<br> fucking a pregnant loli wife <br>That shit is so rare to find</br></br></br>  <br>RIP.</br>  <br>I feel ya bro.</br>  <br>If it is anything like any previous manga, they will introduce some ran dome dude 80% into the series. Rin will ask him for help getting Hayato, she falls in love with him and BAM, Ui will have Hayato all to herself.</br>  Aren't the manga sales really poor anyway? If the anime doesn't help them I can't see it going for many more volumes.  <br>Yeah, it is suprisingly not that popular in Japan. If the Anime doesn't increase manga sales, it will get cancelled soon.</br>  <br>Just a bit</br>  Why does it have such high production value wtf.  <br>You telling me it should look like shit? I'm glad it doesn't.</br>  <br>Actually, I just saw on the Twitter that おくさまが生徒会長! Volume 1 is getting a reprint. So it might be helping sales already.<br><br>Which means the anime might actually give the the manga a second chance of life.</br></br></br>  <br>Arranged marriage is still a thing in the east.</br>  <br>The reprints are always planned pre-anime in order to have copies ready in case the anime gathers some interest. We'll have to wait for the actual sales reports.</br>  <br> wtf </br>  <br> Rin was always designed to be the rival. <br>Still she is going to lose and you know it.<br><br>I'm every girl fag though, so I don't care at all who wins here.</br></br></br></br>  That was a solid 8 minutes of my dick gradually getting more erect<br><br>No idea what the plot was but 10/10 AOTS</br></br>  <br>As has been stated many times, Rin was designed to add conflict in the storyline. If she wasn't there, the series would be 3 volumes long and long forgotten.</br>    I love President's voice.<br><br><br>What the heck, you monster.</br></br></br>  <br>wtf is wrong?</br>   last translated chapter is a possible NTR <br><br>kill me</br></br>  <br> meymeyarrows <br> Not hulk posting <br>I hate Summer so much.</br></br></br>    Longer version.  <br>Oh wow, volume 7. Where the hell did you get that one?</br>  <br>Fuck you, I read everything done by the author.<br><br>Pic related has even lewder scenes than Seitokaichou, too.</br></br></br>  <br>Better it gets cancelled and actually ends rather than going on their endless bait running with Rin.</br>  <br>It's 8minutes long....</br>  Holly shit, everything in this thread is so lewd  <br>Straight from the digital magazine in NicoNico.<br>http://seiga.nicovideo.jp/book/seri<wbr>es/17565</wbr></br></br>  <br>Goddamn, I like Rin too, but I rather have the series go as long as possible.</br>  <br>Each girl gets her chapter</br>   looks good  <br> has a good fashion sense  <br>She is wearing a school uniform!</br></br>  <br>Would you get in a kicking-pansu ogling relationship with her?</br>  <br>What about this part?</br>  <br>Was the next chapter the one where they are passionately kissing in bed?

His best friend ha a conversation where he is very jealous of Hayato and Rin's close relationship, but then he starts crushing on the flat, twintailed girl.<br><br>Go figure, be jealous of friend with big boobed chick, develops a huge crush of the DFC.</br></br></br>  <br> he goes for the lesbian <br>So instead he's removing another obstacles for MC and Kaichou, what a bro.</br></br>  <br><br>You seriously believe this ? Rin is gonna lose but the author won't pair her up with anyone by the end of the series.</br></br>  I hope the mom shows up.  <br>Truly a perfect woman.</br>  <br>Cute.</br>   not japanese brown nipples <br><br>C'mon japs</br></br>  <br>Stop watching shitty 3D porn.</br>  <br/>  <br>You sure? Ithink it's not far fetched.<br><br>Here comes another challenger for Kaichou that has been foreshadowed at early chapters. Wouldn't surprise me if the losers end up together licking each others wound.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon read the thread Volume 7 spoilers imply Rin has a shot and the two girls are friendly towards each other while knowing the other likes MC. If anything it may even end with the two girls sharing. MC guy deserves it, he's a good lead.<br><br>The kouhai will just get shot down the following chapter or two.</br></br></br>  <br>It just won't happen Anon, Rin is simply the heroine rival and she'll lose badly.</br>  Holy fuck.<br>This is going to be fun.</br>  <br>Yes that much is certain but just like any other Love Triangle series aimed for boys the losing girl remains single throughout the end. And i've read most of the author's work and Harem End is still pretty much an open door.</br>  Oh my fucking god.  <br>This series even has a lolimom? 100% amazing.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/739132/3d0333<wbr>b541/?p=1 this is some good shit i'll tell ya what</wbr>  My dick.  <br>who is that semen demon ?</br>  <br>She's  read the fucking manga you faggot </br>  <br>I already have The Nurse has black hair she's the closest thing i could think of</br>  <br>It is the nurse</br>  <br>Gundam manga so misleading</br>  bump limit  <br>No.</br>  <br>Didn't that happen with Okusama wa Joshikousei? Maybe the teacher was kind of young, but the spirit is all the same</br>  Shit, they work fast. no first date, no hand holding, no cuddling, no kisses even beyond a kiss on the finger.  <br>Yeah but at the end you'll leave with balls the size of Mars.</br>  <br><br> That was actually me. I jerked off a bit while trying to be the little girl, I hope you don't mind. </br></br>  <br>SFW image board you Twinkie nibbler</br>  This thread reminds me.<br><br> Koe de oshigoto episode 3 when? </br></br>  <br>Manga is over, so never.</br>  <br>How did it end and why?</br>  <br>You're breaking my heart here anon. breaking my heart and my balls.</br>  Degeneracy: the anime  <br>  it's over <br>You what nigga?</br></br>  <br> Literally "Liberals: The Manga/Anime" </br>  <br>I know, isn't it great?</br>  <br> being a liberal </br>  <br>Who is this euphoric virgin?</br>  What is the best manly anime and why is it pic related?  <br>why did you already answer your own question?</br>    There is zero manly anime   little girl wants to be a princess <br> gets suckered into joining airsoft club instead <br> becomes so tryhard and so obsessed with winning she develops PTSD </br></br>  <br>You posted wrong show.</br>  <br> Harem shit <br> manly <br>Try again</br></br></br>  <br><br>Because it's utterly and completely non-cynical. Whatever it does, it believes in it completely. That's the charm of the anime - It's sort of like the Apocalypse Zero manga, which is grotesquely violent...But the author is so clearly down with it, it comes across as an especially violent Saturday morning cartoon.<br><br>Seriously, just listen to this fucking song.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ACu<wbr>tTOlFyDE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>    He is wanted for destroying an entire city yet no one on the planet is sure what he looks like. His only weapon is a revolver and he has taken down enemies 20 times his size without any casualties. He is against suicide, supports love and peace and dodges bullets by sight. He is known as the Human Typhoon, Vash the Stampede.  MANime is the best. <br>Nothing beats some Fist of the North Star</br>  mad bull  Looks like she is still a loli after all. <br><br>I guess Gate is saved.</br></br>  <br><br>Left or right?</br></br>  <br>Rori is saved. Thank God for that, I was honestly worried since we didn't have a reference point until now.</br>  <br><br>How does she look like a loli?</br></br>  <br> pink panties <br>slut</br></br>  <br>I don't mind the new design. I'm glad her appearance is at least as she should be, that is, 13 years old. <br><br>Also, Rori is best Gate.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She's much smaller than the elf.</br></br>  <br>Are you blind? She looks like a little girl.</br>  <br>I she now? I'm not really seeing it, but whatever.<br>This is just a magazine illustration, and what we had so far was her official anime character design.<br>I will stop worrying when she will appear small in the naime.</br></br></br>  <br>No, she does not.<br><br> 13 <br>You mean 18.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> LolisRDead doing "that" again <br>Fuck off.

I am pleased.</br>  Why is she wearing modern panties?  <br>Goth loli sluts are the best, bro.</br>  <br> slutty pink <br> not pure black with lace <br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Fat ass, large breasts. pointy ears.

She was basically settling down with Itami as her companion for the rest of her natural life as a mortal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>961 years old I mean.</br>  <br><br>Balls deep in dat butt.</br></br>  <br>she voice like a middle age slut<br>not a 961 years old demigod loli</br></br>  <br> she voice like a middle age slut <br>That is what I meant. Ara ara old lady.</br></br>  A better thing to worry about is Why does Lelei look like a sailor scout?<br>Why does she have blue hair too?</br>  <br>Who cares about a loli when you have that elf on the right?</br>  <br> priestess of the god of death <br> pink child panties </br></br>  <br>There had to be at least one girl with an unnatural hair color, Rory was a no-go and the elf already has elf moe going on, so Lelei really was the only candidate.</br>  <br><br>Because she always had.

The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours...<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;24  episodes<br>YES! This means we get the Dark Elves and the Dragon hunt!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>24 episodes? No way. Past that.</br>  <br> Probably to the end of the japan visit. <br>The Japan visit was painful. The weakest part of the story. I rather they fast forward it a bit and don't spend more than two episodes.</br></br>  <br> What? The anime is airing in a little under 13 hours... <br>I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh.</br></br>  <br>Monmusu is on the 7th</br>  <br>I would guess so.<br>There's 5 books (adapted into 10 Light Novels), and Book 2 is the dragon fight.<br>So covering up to two books should be fine.</br></br></br>  <br> 18  <br>you mean 800</br></br>  <br> leaving your mouse on the screen and not hiding it in the corner somewhere <br>Literally the worst fucking people to breathe air that could be getting breathed by someone else.</br></br>  <br> 800 <br><br>She's like 980 or some shit.</br></br></br>  <br> I thought it wasn't till the 7th. So it's tomorrow huh. <br>Only on one channel. Western streaming won't be until the latest airing in Japan.</br></br>  <br>It's probably 3 episodes per arc and ending with the dragon. We'll probably see Yao.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about western streaming? Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Is neetball streaming Gate? I just checked and it doesn't seem like it.</br>  <br>I'll rephrase:<br>Who the fuck cares about streaming?</br></br>  <br>i do my computer is broken so until its repaired i'm going to need to stream</br>  <br>That's too bad, but here's the idea: just wait until it gets fixed and watch it in proper quality and manner.</br>  <br>but then i won't be able to shitpost in the threads</br>    <br> Not black lingerie <br><br>They have just one fucking job and they blew it.<br><br>Frankly this upsets me a litte.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> _master1200 <br>no</br></br>  <br>You will be.<br> Japanese army propaganda! 2 nukes weren't enough... <br> ELF RAPE RAPE ELF  <br> Rory is no loli, hurr anti lolicon propaganda! <br> generic harem shit <br>Or anything else you can think of.

Some scenes during that get pretty gruesome.</br>  <br>You can speak freely here</br>  <br>eh I suppose that's true. Fair point.</br>  <br>much better tbh</br>  <br> androgynous kuudere <br>to<br> generic blob with oddly colored hair #21,491 <br>This is not okay.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I think Rory doesn't have such a strict loli appeal that a non-lolicon can't enjoy her. <br>Now that I heard her voice, I am going to appreciate the gap moe of having an adult woman's voice coming out of the body of a young girl. Is there a fetish name for that?</br></br>  <br> Pink panties <br>And dropped.</br></br>   10h30m until it airs   Not enough appreciation of Tuka's ass up this is bitch. <br><br>Y'all faggots r GAY!</br></br>    <br>Her hair is blue, just a different shade in the anime.<br><br>All characters look much better done, or at least more modern, than in the manga. The manga art is shit, and lazily done. <br><br>Shading is bad, mouth and nose looks like snouth, and just not doing it for me. I coulg go on but again.<br><br>The girls in the manga aren't cute or anything at all. The anime at least looks good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree with this.<br><br>In fact, the hair color change makes me wonder if they weren't trying to make her look like Tabitha.</br></br></br>  <br>Old<br><br>Hag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh.<br><br>still, that specific shade of blue should have been avoided. It's too jarring.</br></br></br>  that doesn't look loli at all<br> fuckin blind faggots</br>  <br>How much rape does this have?</br>  <br><br><br><br>Nah they're gonna do the entire season 1. <br><br>Episode 1-13 = From start to slaying of the dragon<br>Episode 14-19 = Prince Zorzal's rebellion<br>Episode 19-26 = Defeats of Zorzal and closing of the Gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Enough to fill an Indian bus.</br>  <br>Any proof it's two cours?</br>  <br>Read the thread</br>  <br>Left, I really like rori</br>  <br>I think at one point group of bandits raped a girl, killed her, and threw her naked, decapitated used body towards her husband<br><br>I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though</br></br></br>  <br> I doubt that's gonna fly in the anime though <br>The body actually flew in the manga?</br></br>  <br><br>CIA in full force. Fuck yeah.</br></br>  <br>That's pretty hardcore</br>  <br> filename </br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if they did that. It is certainly possible, especially since they want to promote the upcoming novel sequel and they NEED to finish the main story in the anime for that. Guess it wouldn't be that impossible with 2 cour.</br>  <br>Search by MD5, retard.</br>  <br>Honestly there's a lot of padding in the novel, and in an animated medium it would feel too dragged out if they stick to it. Only reason manga is tolerable at the pace is because it's still a printed medium. <br><br>I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br>I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sure a lot of people will bitch, but I'm cool with that direction. <br> I'm a novelfag, but not a source fundamentalist. <br>Seriously, 2 cour was far more than I was expecting and as such I can't really complain.</br></br></br>  Yeah, if they can condense 5 volumes of Log Horizon in 2 cours, I can see 5 volumes of GATE in 2 cours.  <br>Unlike others here I'm not really surprised with the 2 cours. <br>GATE is Alphapolis's biggest title, this is their "make or break" moment. It's natural they'll put as much effort as they can on their big break.</br></br>   24 episodes <br><br>It's been a while since I read gate<br><br>What are the chances we'll see itami  punch the prince? </br></br></br></br>  <br>i thought shortstack chick did that?</br>  Gundam Seed Destiny of our generation.  <br>Itami punched him first, then when Prince retaliated he pulled the gun out.</br>  <br>I just hope they don't rush anything.</br>  This is a relatively peaceful thread so far.  <br>Can't believe I am looking forward to this.</br>  Can anyone improve on this image? I can put the text in a pastebin  <br>The only way you can improve on it is by deleting it from the internet. Sadly it has already been posted so you fucked it up permanently.</br>  I don't feel very excited for this. What are some A1 adaptations that are actually really good?  <br>Someone's sensitive</br>  <br>Stop projecting. That image will only fuel shitposting and you should know that.</br>  <br>Someone's affected</br>  <br>Yeah, make the damn text readable against the background.</br>  someone mentioned being unable to find gates original webnovel version in one of the previous threads.<br>i managed to find it on my computer today.<br><br>www.mediafire.com/download/zriujpo8<wbr>mqtfn2n/gate.zip</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot the biggest thing; "Gate is a work of fiction, so any and all arguments regarding the current state of the real nation of Japan (it's armed forces, relationships with other countries etc) have no relevance to the fictional universe in which Gate takes place."<br>And that comparatively to the majority of American films it hardly qualifies as a 'power fantasy'.<br><br>Also yeah, green text is completely unreadable, and links on images is stupid unless you use a link shortener.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> But they are unbeatable! <br><br>Daily reminder that flips has one of the best special forces that could outperform special forces from developed countries even with shit equipment</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, I'm in Japanese locale.</br>  <br>I have the same problem, but notepad seems to work.</br>  <br>Well, that solves it for me as well, thanks.</br>  <br>there are multiple japanese locales.<br>thats what i get when i set webbrowser to western locale.<br><br>$ file Gate.html<br>Gate.html: HTML document, UTF-8 Unicode text, with very long lines, with CRLF line terminators</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except they're like... double the size?</br>  <br>Wouldn't that be too fast?</br>  <br>Step up, senpai.</br>  <br>Haha.<br><br>But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes  like this guy's saying. This isn't your typical LN adaption.</br></br></br>  <br>But that's nearly two hours of screen time per book which is more than what they actually got and I seriously doubt the GATE novel is that long.</br>  <br>Also, it's a fucking web novel so I'm sure there's some form of dumb bullshit they could cut and nobody would give a fuck.</br>  <br>certainly bigger, but not double</br>  <br>Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> when a prince hostile to the Japanese launched a coup, gave support to a princess who they had more leverage over and would be less of an enemy to Japan <br> even though the JSDF cannot be legally used overseas in the role of collective self defense of an ally, and the public is protesting against Abe's attempts to reinterpret the Japanese Constitution to make it legal to fight alongside the USA overseas <br><br>REMEMBER <br><br>JAPANESE PUBLIC OPINION IRL IS HEAVILY AGAINST LIBERALLY REINTERPRETING THE SDF CHARTER WHICH THEIR PM HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people thinking A-1 won't fuck up   <br>Is 2 hours per arc enough? I think that 2:30 hours is the ideal length of a movie for me.</br>  <br>Fuck up is relative. <br>I for one don't think A-1 fucked up SAO. That was shit from the source.</br></br>  <br>I know a lot of mangafags complained about Nanatsu no Taizai. It was also a complete QUALITY fest in the second half, as expected of A-1.</br>  <br>Seven sins was fine. <br>sourcefags will complain no matter what.</br></br>  This is going to be a war strategies/political anime? B-boring.  <br>Let them complain. It's nothing compared to the turd anime One Piece had become.</br>  <br>Neither was Log Horizon.</br>  <br>LH was a light novel. I meant the format in that post. <br>but basing on the anime it seems like they will adapt the light novel?</br></br>  <br> But no really, that would be like burning through 5 Harry Potter books in 24 episodes <br><br>Stop and think about what you're saying here. <br><br>They adapted first 5 Harry Potter novels in to 5 movies, 157 minutes each. That's 785 minutes including the long credits. <br><br>24 episodes of anime is 600 minutes, including OP/ED.<br><br>It's not as outrageous a difference as you seem to think.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>You see those 9 colorful books on the top shelf? That's Log Horizon. <br>Log Horizon is most definitely NOT small books. <br><br>Now see the shelf below it. <br>The tiny little books on the left side are the GATE light novels, two of those equal one of the GATE books the large books you see to the right of the manga adaptation on the same shelf)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oops, off by one.. I meant see </br>    <br>What you haven't ever made simple mistakes, Sigmund?</br>  <br> Oops, off by one <br>Yeah, I see that.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing it's because they streamlined and cut content from the novel version. It doesn't really tell me anything. As for LH are they really that big? It seemed like Haruhi and Spice was longer than those.</br>  <br>My point is that you did not make a mistake.</br>  <br>The adaptation itself being really good? Hasn't really happened.<br>Stuff like Silver Spoon was serviceable, but simply because of the source's story,.<br>So while it won't be visually amazing, with at least the blessing of 2 cour, it'll be passable and cover new material. All we could really ask for.</br></br></br>  <br>Which episodes will be QUALITY?</br>  <br>I'll help out by marking them</br>  <br><br>But SIlver Spoon was really nicely animated throughout. A-1 vary massively. <br>My guess is that they put a lot of money into this so it should look pretty good like SAO, Shigatsu etc.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks but I know what's what. <br>I just didn't know those blue books were counted too.<br><br>I'm not confident enough in 5 novels for 24 eps.<br>There was a lot of material skipped for LH as well and it didn't seem long to me when I read it.<br><br>And judging by the art of the anime I think it's the light novels that will get adapted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm reading the mushoku manga, but it's hella slow. How the fuck does he manages to marry the 3 girls, the fuck? (childhood friend, royalty brat, and sensei)</br>  <br>Through years of hardships and impotence.</br>  <br>Got separated from the childhood friend by his dad to prevent crippling dependence by childhood friend<br><br>Traveled the world with ojousama and gave each other their virginities then ojousama left to go train in a cave for years (he thought she was dumping him because she's really bad at explanations and just disappeared one morning)<br><br>Decided to pursue higher education, reunited with childhood friend at college and got married. <br><br>Went on a quest to rescue his mom (leaving his pregnant wife behind) but some people died and he ended up depressed, sensei who he rescued "comforted" him and they ended up calling a shotgun wedding<br><br>Much later ojousama finally returns after having achieved maximum powerlevel just in time to rescue him from being killed by the Act 2 final boss, she marries him and basically rapes him on their wedding night</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a timeskip, or is this loli sex?</br>  <br>What the fuck, I haven't read so far but what. How the fuck are the other 2 okay of him having 3 wives.</br>  <br>Obviously a time skip retard.</br>  <br>juve period &gt;youth period&gt; young man period. Like 3 timeskips.</br>  <br>Osananajimi has her own self esteem issues (even though she's like a crack secret service agent and shit)<br><br>Sensei is just happy to share<br><br>Ojousama is confident in the security of their relationship even if he is married three times, (she also tries to get him to fuck the catgirl maid but he just throws the maid out of the room)<br><br>It's not like he just marries everyone he meets, he doesn't fuck his half imouto maid or the catgirl maid for example</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's kinda sad knowing Rudeus should be more mature than Itami since he's lived a longer life, but isn't.  <br>It could be that he settled down to his new world age and stopped thinking like an old man.</br>  <br> mfw eris gives rudeus erectile disfunction </br>  <br><br>Or you know <br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's been married, went through boot camps, commands a squad of trained soldiers, and a trained ranger <br><br>As opposed to<br><br>Life experiences of a 30-something otaku who's never held a job in his life, parasytes off his parents, and never dated a girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elf ass</br>  <br>The point was that pre incarnation Rudeus was a complete manchild who never really grew up, instead running away from reality into eroge and light novels and japanese animes. Hence why in spite of his supposed greater experience a lot of the stuff he says and thinks during Childhood and Juvenile periods exposes his immaturity. And why getting a second life grants him the opportunity to develop in a way that he did not in his previous life. <br><br>By comparison, Itami is a world weary soldier who went through a messy relationship that ended in divorce by mutual consent, animu and mangos is how he finds entertainment not how he evades engaging with society and work.</br></br></br>  <br>Were they divorced? I thought they were just separated.</br>  <br>They're legally divorced. <br>Although the manage to stay friends.</br></br>  <br> brown elf <br><br>are you telling me there's chocolate in this?</br></br></br>  <br>So Rudeus is one of us while Itami is a normalfag</br>  <br>Yes, used and slutty one at that.</br>  <br>even better<br><br>will she be present early?</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on how far they're gonna go. <br>If they're gonna do the entire First Season you'll see her fairly early on, like ep 10 or so.<br>If they're only gonna do up to the Fire Dragon Arc, you won't see her till well after the first cour.</br></br></br>  <br> pic? </br>  <br> One of those bitches are dead </br>      <br>holy shit fuck yes<br><br>thank you</br></br></br>   Pina doesn't wear extreme boobplate armor <br>I like it.</br>  <br>  pic <br>What is this?</br></br>  <br>Announcement that Crunchyroll picked it up for simulcast. <br>And it also revealed that this will be 2 cours.</br></br>  <br>tnx</br>  <br>Rudeus is who we are, Itami is who we wish we were.</br>  <br>Can't find this without the text. Help?</br>  <br> that pic <br>I feel bad for laughing.</br></br>  <br>That looks greatly more medieval or renaissance than roman. I am disappoint.</br>  <br>You also have to consider the format, it's not like a pocket light novel. Also, the light novel version, which is 10 volumes, is practically 400 pages each volume.</br>  <br>No it's not. It's under 270 pages. I just opened them to see. <br><br>Log horizon is about 350 pages, so Gate is significantly bigger, but not double. Like I said. <br><br>I actually own these books, dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's not just shadow </br>  where is chapter 47? what's those lazy fuckers doing?  <br>How do you know about it? Currently manga translation status is the end of slaying of the dragon.</br>  <br>Her wife looks like a landwhale anyway, good riddance.</br>  I kinda want to try to read through this again, but I kinda remember all the scanlations being piss poor. Are they still shit?  <br>the soldier chick?</br>  <br>The LN?</br>  Test test  <br>OK, cool, it give a possible that anime would go further than manga</br>  First episode airs today, who hype here?  People keep mentioning A/Z with this show, I'm worried.  <br>Cute girls, is it yuri?</br>  <br>No one</br>  Not exactly hype but I'm watching. Kind of a weird set-up for a love triangle with the main girl being an emotionless autist pilot, the guy being the older teacher and the other girl being the little sister of the guy.  <br> the guy <br><br>What the hell?</br></br></br>  <br>It has female Inaho with Asshime's VA.</br>  <br>Nope<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LyMW<wbr>hutoE6o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Well fuck I have no time for romcom garbage.</br>  <br>Their teacher.</br>  <br>go here first for livewatch<br/></br>  <br>The A/Z comparisons have kind of killed my hype.</br>  <br> no mention of the show's name in the OP post <br>why people do this</br></br>  <br>Because catalog search is capable of finding the thread just fine.</br>  ITT: guess who the best girl is in a show you've never seen<br><br>I'm gonna go with second-to-the-right here</br></br>  Going to be watching this pretty soon.

Something about a woman with a good-for-nothing who brainwashed him into becoming a good guy. I can't recall it clearly, there was something about how she had to collect toenail clippings of her son and husband, and I think there was a recurring centipede motif. I might be mixing things up, though.  Where did the anime go wrong?
