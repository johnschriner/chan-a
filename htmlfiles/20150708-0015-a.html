I don't think anyone picked up the series yet, but I am sure the raws are out since that issue came out like 2 weeks ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Every human is born with tits.</br>  <br><br><br>hmm well I hope it's comedy, because her works were actually quite funny.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do i get the feeling this is gonna get censored to hell like Terra Formars</br>  <br><br>Because it will. We're not going to see the fucking nipple, or the explicit lesbian scene (If it even gets that far).</br></br>  <br>from left to right having no idea who these characters are:<br><br>1) anal slut<br>2) who stands with their legs like that? looks like a bitch too<br>3) what the fuck is this supposed to be? stupidly huge tits, neck ribbon, leather boots - what a shit<br>4) stupid hair style and shorts</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because 99% of the shows are censored on TV?

How does she even stand straight?</br>  <br> who stands with their legs like that? <br>I do, I have a weak bladder and it helps me.</br></br>  First episode tomorrow. Let's keep this thread going till then.<br><br>Cautiously optimistic for Papa Bones.</br></br>  <br>Where will the episode end?</br>                <br>New xhapter up at Batoto</br>  <br>any chance he'll be matched by someone with high agility in the source of the adaptation?</br>  <br>Did you forget Volume 3 anon?</br>  <br>sorry potential secondary here</br>  <br> be matched <br>as of yet no, unless you count the servants</br></br>  <br>Yes, it'll probably be in the last episode of the show.</br>  <br><br><br>I see<br><br> as of yet no, unless you count the servants <br><br> Judging by what the anon said I assume one of the servants is going to turn on him? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sense of justice: -500 <br>Wasn't Ainz just a normal office employee pre-Yggdrasil or did turning into an Undead cripple whatever morality he has along with his emotions?</br></br>  <br>Yes it's   the penguin  </br>  <br>likely his setting on his Character, it also seem to have an effect on his overall personality, as he just regards humans as small animals.</br>  <br>Any fansub group planing to do this?</br>  Waiting for dat Albedo.  <br> you'll never have Albedo's mountains pushed against you </br>  So what are the spoilers for vol 9  The official book seems to have a few more facial expressions.        It's pages like these that makes me think they're really cutting corners on the skeletons.  <br>I wish there was more art on the different floors, that's not half bad as far as secret underground undead lairs go.</br>  <br><br>RIP Quality</br></br>  I wish someone would write a pasta about how the game stuff disappears after the first episode so we can direct the inevitable "Game? It's shit" comments to the pasta.   yet another LN adaptation about a vr game  <br>Literally who gives a fuck</br>  <br><br>Great.</br></br>  So I'm not sure how to feel about the OP.<br><br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>51028</wbr></br></br>  <br> Do you have a way of getting past all those undead? <br> ITS RIGHT HERE <br>goddamn it, this scene is so manly</br></br></br>  So, now that there will be inevitable anime shitposters, can we agree to have a nice LN only thread on Saturdays that chapter is released? I will missed the comfy spooky thread.    <br>Don't worry. Anime shitposters will decrease in quantity after the first episode. Because they would have hopefully dropped it by then.</br>  <br>I kinda liked it, but i hated de cgi staff.</br>  <br>I dont think thats the OP. It's more like just the song for the OP and combine all videos from the trailers and pv</br>  <br>I think I like it better than their Parasyte OP but it definitely grows on you I think. I only hope the visuals in it are better than the song.</br>  <br>Oh, that's what I meant. The OP song.</br>  <br>I think that's the OP but not the accompanying visuals.</br>  <br>What the hell is up with anime using CGI for everything recently</br>  <br>Cant wait to see Papa Bones and his bony adventures</br>  <br>It's a lot cheaper, I heard.</br>  <br>It's cheaper. Or so I hear</br>  <br>I want her to rape me and stomp on my worthless human dick with narbarel</br>    Can someone make the webm where Ainz sees Albedo's profile and then covers his mouth?    <br>I expected her ranger skills to be at least level 10, rather than a measly 5.</br>  <br>Hmm the small cuts showed us the Black Knight trouncing around and footage of the Primal Fire Elemental.<br><br>If they go for 3 episodes per volume, ch1/2, ch3 and cliffhanger on gazef, rest for 3rd ep. I'd wish they'd go for 4 to allow more pre-translocation world building and shit that got cut in the manga, mainly more of the interlude, epilogue and Ainz's negotiations in Carne.</br></br></br>  <br> ranger <br> use whip <br>Whats the point?</br></br></br>  <br>Looks like episode 1 will just end at the part where the guardians finish their bowing.</br>  <br>Probably something she picked up from her Tamer classes. Then again, she has another 70 levels unaccounted for so who knows what it really might be from.</br>  <br>Ainz guildmate set up the settings and level for all the guardians. They probably pick that class and level for certain skill, tracking or hiding.</br>    <br>Ainz only set up Pandora's Actor.<br><br><br>So they aren't going to rush it? That's good news, I guess.</br></br></br></br>          Where's it going to stream?      <br> young </br>  <br>well, technically she's only about as old as the others, give or take a few years.</br>     Not really interested in another MMO story but the skeleton MC might be cool <br> Decide to read the manga chapters since it's coming out tomorrow <br> MC is serious business and doesn't play around <br> MMO stuff is merely the introduction, story is fully inmersed in the setting <br> Minimal pandering, pretty much reduced to Albedo and Shalltear, not that it matters much when Momonga is undead (though I'm prepaed for it to go full harem anyway) <br> That black knight mode <br> That hamster <br><br>Picked the fuck up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the manga </br>  <br>Well she was born when Peroroncino created her so she couldn't have been alive that long. Plus, she only gained sentience a short while ago.</br>  <br> the manga </br>  Why does Ainz have such a large crotch guard? It literally goes down to his knees.   all the CGI in the preview <br>Ughhhhhhhhh.</br>  <br><br><br>I know there's a novel but this was quicker and I like the pretty pictures, I'll get to read the rest later.</br></br></br>  <br>Albedo has to protect the most important part of Lord Ainz of course, those skeletons aren't gonna make themselves.</br>  <br>Well maybe they actually could</br>  Well hopefully we can get like 20+ volumes out of this series. I also hope other players start showing up, I mean like bad news for Ainz kind of players.  <br>but the pretty pictures in the novel are prettier</br>  <br>The worst news for him is if there's drama within Nazarick.</br>  <br>Google is your friend.</br>  <br>Everyone seems extremely loyal to Ainz barring a certain beaked individual, and that one theory about a certain someone.</br>  So how strong is Pandora's actor?  <br>Wasn't he like 90% of whoever he transforms into minus their items?</br>  <br>Yes. He also has access to all of the gear of the old AoG members though. So at his top, he should 90% of Touch Me / the one World Magic member.</br>  <br>Potentially one of the strongest due to his versatility. Even at 80% he still gets the rigged option of copying Rubedo, Touch Me, and Ulbert all of whom are far above decked out Ainz.<br><br>Then again we have no idea on the limits of his transformation aside from the scale of power copied, nor it's mana costs for each use. He is however, one of the smart ones along with Demiurge and Albedo, so chances are he can make use of his abilities very well.</br></br></br>  Such a magnificent beast.  <br>I thought Ainz was pretty on par with the top in terms of combat ability in the guild. Especially sense he spent a fortune on the cash shop. Not to mention his special magic is just OP vs anything with a pulse.</br>  <br>Not really. Touch Me could definitely trump him, and he even mentions on of his other guild members easily beat him when it came to destruction type magic. He might have an edge with tactics, but he's specced for RPing purposes.</br>  <br>He never goes into too much detail on comparison on how to he compares to the average guild member; but he mentions he's on middle of the upper tier compared to the general player base since his shitty spec drags him down.</br>  <br>No, Ainz was considered upper-middle as far as the playerbase rankings were concerned, not his guild. And that was because Ainz was in a guild that allowed him to deck himself out in full divine whereas normal players would only have 1-2, which is around the same area if not worse than his guardians depending on which one. For example, Shalltear has 1 divine, however she also later gets 1 WC so she still outgears the average end game player.<br><br>Ainz build was so shit pretty much no one ever tried it, that's why his secret class stayed a secret in the first place, since it requires you to become a piece of shit just to obtain and it's trump card isn't even all that good if the enemy is prepared.</br></br></br>  anyone have the link to the google docs of the translated volumes?  <br>use google</br>  <br>it only goes up to volume 4</br>  <br>We don't really know the average of the guild, however Touch Me and Ulbert are among the 18 best players in the world. It's not even comparable to Ainz.<br><br>Amusingly enough, those two obtained their titles by becoming as good as the top 18 in the world yet because they won they gained special classes and equipment which only they could use so the gap only increased. Unless Ainz has a done of WC items all for himself that actually synergizes with his build he has no hope of being at the top.<br><br>Well, there's always the idea of decking himself with WC items, but if we're talking about Yggdrasil days the WC items belonged to the guild, not to Ainz.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>well yeah. That's all that's TLd right now.</br>  <br>Yeah, I remembered him mentioning his build was pretty much RP based and the only saving grace he got from it was the death sphere. I thought with his worldclass items it made up for it though. Kind of a moot point though, I guess when he can switch to a warrior with all of the treasury at his disposal if he wanted to. Looking at it at from this perspective though you really understand why he's fucking terrified of any of the guardians turning on him. He makes it seem like he could easily handle the one that did if it wasn't for his pride/panic mode is why I guess my opinion of him was skewed.</br>  Summary<br>vol.9<br>fking<br>when?</br></br></br>  <br>why<br>does<br>it<br>matter?<br><br>That's 5 volumes away.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought the best thing he got was the "All life seeks death" skill from eclipse class dipping that let him ignore death spell immunity for 12 seconds.</br>  <br>The best thing he got seems to be his trump card he used in the rogue guardian battle. If you don't prepare for it (Which he makes seems to ve extremely difficult to even do) it 's an insta win. Even if you are prepared it still fucks you over. The only downside being it's limited usage... Well, that and it's not ally friendly.</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Here's a quick summary  Ainz pwns shit </br>  <br>I'd give more credit to Ainz if it wasn't flat out stated that Rubedo makes Shalltear look weak.</br>  <br>Self rez item isn't rare at all. Ainz's version which IS rare can do it 3x in a fucking row without losing exp. Shalltear's can only do it once and it's been pointed out the self rez item isn't Divine Class, which is the best grade she has during the fight.<br><br>Anyone who's PvPing for real is gonna have a self rez. Well, not in the NW but that's cause NW is scrub land.</br></br></br>  <br>Touch Me and Ulbert "were" among the best 18 players in the world. If I recall, some time passed between the guild's peak and the end of the game. <br><br>There could have been new classes, races and players that superseded World Champion, if not more. We the readers are uncertain, but there can be the presence of others that would validate Ainz's paranoia, depending on how late into the game's lifespan was the guild's decline.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought he mentioned self resurrection items weren't common. Like it mentions hers was special too.. I might just be confusing it for ainz going on about his own. It has been awhile since I read it. <br><br>Wonder if we'll ever see someone actually designed for combat appear. If ainz is already an overgod in the new world what would they be?</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't matter, because the World Tournaments were apparently only held once, one for each class for each world. So 18 in total. It's a really dumb idea, but that's how it was. <br><br>While Ainz's paranoia is still valid imo, he's actually only in a real threat because of his goals. If he just wanted to stay alive, it's not a problem. It's a problem because he wants to stay alive with his npcs and be the Ainz Ooal Gown that his servants have embellished in their heads and the long term game plan is almost completely unknown territory.<br><br>I mean, he's a fucking human. Humans have a hard enough time planning their retirement. He's gotta worry for the rest of eternity in theory.<br><br>The only 'relief' he can take heart in (if he knew this knowledge which I don't think he does) is he's probably the last set of tranfers, since the game server's shut down so no one can come out of nowhere in the next 100 years or so and come out with even better shit and slaughter him like he is to everyone now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They weren't common. They were just more common than Divine class items. Remember, even a single Divine class item takes ridiculous amounts of grinding. In comparison to WoW and other MMOs where the average end game player who sticks around for more than 2 years raiding/pvp and would be decked out in most of the top end loot, in Yggdrasil those same players would have 1-2 divines throughout their 10 year career.</br>  <br>"cough"lich"cough"</br>  <br>touch me was THE top m8. 1vs1 him faggot, you won't<br>To that end, their guild was broken as hell man</br></br>  <br>On a scale of 1 to Elfen Lied, how edgy will this be?</br>  <br>Not him but there were 8 others besides him at the top buddy. One champion for each world. And the world champion only encompasses the warrior classes, not magic caster.</br>  <br><br>Who is Ulbert?</br></br>  <br>I don't know about edgy. It's a walk in the park for Ainz and his loveable family, the only things angsting are the small "furry animals" running around.</br>  <br>As far as papa bones knows, not very. What they keep from him is pretty disturbing though. Poor bipedal sheep.</br>  <br>It's edgy, but it does a good job of reasoning it. The denizens simply live in a dog eat dog world. The protagonist and his posse are mentally affected by their game settings.<br><br>Imagine some roleplayer in D&amp;D got transported into another world, and turned into his paper recorded character, right down to having the tendencies and good/evil alignment that was set up by him even if it goes against what he personally is like in the real world. But he also knows this, so there's conflict.<br><br>Well, his posse doesn't know it, because they are npcs and think it's natural.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The magic equivalent of Touch Me in the guild.</br>  So what's the radio show about?  Anyone know where exactly the drama cd fits in? seems like after 3 but before 4  <br>You mean the CD drama? If the anime doesn't cover it you'll wanna get it since it's side stories.</br>  <br> not getting the 1vs1 me joke </br>  <br>You are correct.</br>  <br>1v1 is srs bidness, you never went outside ironforge or org?</br>  I read what overlord is suppose to be about but why are people saying it's edgy?  <br>People die in very gruesome ways while others take delight in it. Happens a lot. The entire setting is a cesspool of crazies essentially.</br>  <br>Normal players at 100 hardly had 1 or 0 Divine items, only top guilds go above 1 for everyone.</br>  <br>I can deal with it. I guess the fact that it has a lich in it that interests me. should I read the manga or the LN?</br>  <br>And creator of Demiurge, also suffered from severe chuuni.</br>  <br>LN</br>  <br>If you want to know if it's for you and are in a hurry, check the first manga volume and then read the LN. Or just straight go into the LN.</br>  <br>Normal players weren't rankers, which is the context of my post, not casuals.</br>  <br>So far the only players to make it to the New World have been total scrubs that left behind Relic/Leagcy tier shit, your point? Majority chance.</br>  <br>His potential is far greater in this world than in the game. If he was truly pushed into a corner he would use the Guild Staff. In volume 4 it was said that he is still against using it because it represents his friends struggles. Also Ainz is capable of massacre on a much larger scale than in game to store Exp from the gauntlets. Given time he could summon a permanent Wiseman and Thanatos summon with no impact to his Exp.</br>  <br>The radio show was just VA's being host and answering submitted questions from the fans, iirc.</br>  <br>I assume they aren't keeping record of it?</br>  <br>I wasn't comparing Ainz to the NW. I was comparing Ainz in Yggdrasil to show why he's not top tier there, which is the context of his own opinion.<br><br>Of course he's a god in the NW. The only things that can hurt him now are Dragon Lords going kamikaze, Brain if he trains hard and gets super lucky or Certain Death if she gets lucky. Everyone else may as well roll over.<br><br>And I'm talking just hurting him, not endangering him. Ainz's biggest danger is Albedo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No idea if it has even aired or how many episodes there are. No idea if the website will also host the recordings for those that miss listening them.</br>  <br>Ah well true but that's given already by his own admission that he went with RP build, no matter how big guild backing or p2w item skills he has, he would never be on the same starting line like those that have very specialized builds.<br><br>Unless of course he has the element of surprise, adversary builds are not good against his and he doesn't run into hard-counter builds like that of Shalltear's.<br><br>And on a sidenote, the biggest weakness of their guild might as well had been their own timezone and work. Why not go in with specialized team or group on hours that will most likely have the majority of the guild online? Hazards of being stuck in single country/single region entity where timezones matter (like Eve-O)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> he would use the Guild Staff <br>The reason he's scared of using the Guild Staff is because of the old game mechanics. If the Guild Staff is taken/destroyed, the entire Guild is automatically disbanded and they lose their Guild Base. He'd honestly be more likely to bring out every single World Class Item and every single Guardian than to actually risk the Guild Staff in a dangerous fight unless he gets confirmation that that particular game mechanic is no longer working.<br><br><br> capable of massacre on a much larger scale than in game to store Exp from the gauntlets <br>Any other transported player could do the same.<br><br> permanent Wiseman and Thanatos summon <br>Again, any other transported player with a summoning skill could do the same.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The logical conclusion is Albedo going crazy enough to destroy the staff herself, so she can have Ainz all by his lonesome.</br>  <br>Is it possible that breaking the staff may also have some negative effect on all of the NPCs?</br>  <br>many of the NPCs service Nazarick<br>No guild staff = no Nazarick<br>No Nazarick = purposeless NPC<br>purposeless NPC = lots of headache, even rebellion</br></br></br></br>  Anri_sama got a LN!Lets aim for anime next.  <br>Alternatively,<br><br>Lose control of Nazarick.<br>Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown no longer works.<br>Treasury is now completely closed off.<br>NPCs become standard enemies and attack on sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  5 hours til airing.  <br>I read the manga and it was good. Speaking about the manga and anime here should be encouraged, but just using these threads to circlejerk about the Novel is disgusting and pretentious. If you want to do that then fuck off to /jp/ or /lit/.</br>  <br>Wait really?<br> tfw still no Reika-sama LN </br></br>  <br>Most likely the NPCs would be cut off ie now status/functions from guild being impossible, POP spawns won't work and management is impossible</br>  <br>http://mypage.syosetu.com/mypageblo<wbr>g/view/userid/556653/blogkey/118627<wbr>5/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> starts a thread on /jp/ <br> gets told to fuck off back to /a/ <br><br> starts a thread on /lit/ <br> gets told to fuck off with this weebshit and go back to /a/ <br><br><br>Heh good luck trying<br><br>I tried</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can fuck off since I'm not going to read the so far superior source. <br><br>Guess what, for half a year the majority of discussion has been on the LN and somewhat on WN.<br><br>Manga isnt discussed a lot since its pointless out of its release week and only bringing in rushed shit passing as adaptation whose only saving grace is the expressions.<br><br>Anime hopefully manages to be something that warrants discussion. Remains to be seen of it can justify it's existence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you can fuck off, because it's neither an anime nor a manga. Discussing a plot line that will come soon in either the anime or the manga and was shown in the novels is one thing, but circlejerking to the existence of the novel is basically derailed a already shit thread and has nothing to do here on /a/. This is not your board, so don't change what it is or should be about.</br>  <br>Do you know "kono light novel ga sugoi" ?It is published by Takarajimasha, Inc. And that page clearly names it and even says it is about to be published but that she will not delete WN.</br>  <br>It isn't yours, either. Discussing the source material of an anime or manga is always allowed.</br>  <br>Huh, I thought that's the name for yearly LN award or something. It's nice to see that the author won't delete the WN page since I'm still re-reading it for time to time.<br><br>Hopefully she's still going to update the side story too though</br></br></br>  <br> D-dont talk about the source material! <br>How much are you getting paid mate?</br></br>  <br>Yes, as I said in my post. You have no reading comprehension. Discussing the plot is bearable, but using a thread on /a/ as if it was /jp/ and as if this is the board for LNs is cancerous.</br>  <br> I can't read <br>Good for you.</br></br>  <br>This thread was never about the LN until you started forcing your own "rules." Are you just another anime/manga only fag that you can't stand spoilers?</br>  <br>He probably watches GoT and is salty over being called a showfag on /tv/.</br>  <br> forcing your own "rules." <br>How about you read the rules first<br><br> This thread was never about the LN  <br>How about you read it<br><br><br> GoT <br>kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Not those two anon but I don't get it. Other than the occasional anon who talked about other LN, all the overlord talk here is basically talking about the plot, just in more depth so that only someone who actually read the novel would get it. You're saying that you can understand if we're talking about the plot that's bound to happen in the manga/anime, which people here seem to exactly do that but with added more details.<br><br>How is that constitute as circle jerking? Does the somewhat peaceful discussion with almost no shitposting triggers you somewhat?<br><br>Also I'm pretty sure that LN with anime/manga adaptation is allowed on /a/. I remember one screenshot from mods that allowed it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Where did people discuss the LN? Its just the character pages and the official book and people talking about the characters.<br> It seems like you are new here. Source discussion always happens in anime/manga threads. See any type moon thread or index. If you don't like getting spoiled, then don't go in the thread.</br></br>  <br> See any type moon thread or index. <br> Cancer is okay when there is other cancer here already </br></br>  <br>Anime adaptations are the real cancer.

The ones that are used for ripping bluray .psg subs (bitmap graphics, as in not text) are pretty good at it.<br><br>It asks you for every unrecognized letter but if the font doesnt change, it's pretty fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Looking at Funi's releases for other shows this season, this could turn out even worse than usual.</br>  <br>Wait so there's a program for ripping subtitle from hardsub video?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4dO<wbr>OAEOaUmc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Background music for reading novel/manga</br></br>  Does Sebastian have a profile yet?   shalltear getting off on being a living chair <br>this bitch</br>  <br>Albedo gets so jealous</br>  <br> Human Race <br> has elf ears <br>Still cute though.

Episode 14 in 13 hours!   Kumiko muttered, trying to feign apathy as best as she could. Bathed in the rays of the setting sun, the dark brown loafers she just bought shone dully. The young man before her smiled as if embarrassed, and made a flimsy attempt in changing the topic. By the way you know, there's a really beautiful girl in my class. Upon hearing those words, Kumiko unwittingly gave him a good and hard kick from behind.  <br><br>Cute</br></br>  <br>Who are those again?</br>  Thank you based novelanon for your translations.  <br>as much as Reina wants. So all the life Taki has left.</br>  <br>That should of been in episode 1.</br>  <br>Is he inviting you to fuck him or to be fucked?</br>  <br><br>No, that would scare away the yurifags.

Otherwise the threads wouldn't have been shit.</br>  <br> Whatever your pleasure. </br>  <br>If only anon.</br>  <br> obnoxious baiting <br><br>Well this is Kyoani so it's to be expected. They should have at least made him apologize, in the anime he's oblivious to his past mistake and insensitive about it. I remember people talking about how he should have just apologized in the early threads.</br></br></br>  Novel spoilers incoming<br> &gt;After successfully taking the band to nationals, but failing at the very end and getting copper, Taki appears downtrodden after witnessing the students crying.<br> Later, when Kumiko says a formal goodbye for the summer she finds Taki alone at his desk, looking over his wife's photograph <br> They chat a bit, mostly about how the students are coping with this loss. They move on to where Taki reminisces how his wife always pushed forward, even in the wake of her illness she never lost her cheerful smile. <br> Taki appears to shake a bit when he mentions that his wife didn't appear weak even during her final hour, she kept smiling for him despite the pain and impending death. <br> He admits that he wanted to cherish her memory by doing something that she loved for the dream she kept. And in the end he let the students down, he let his wife's memory down. <br> Kumiko thinks that this isn't true, and tells him that the band would never have made it so far had he not encouraged them. She says something along the lines of his wife would be proud he had done something so great for her, and that he should continue to cherish her by keeping up the strength she had and not giving up. <br> Taki thanks her before she leaves with Shu <br> Kumiko notes that his smile looked similar to someone lifting a heavy burden. <br> The next morning the news spreads that Taki went an hero and lives happily ever in heaven with his waifu, laughing at all the silly gaijin pigs reading this. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> <br><br>Taki a best husbando.</br></br></br>  <br>Being called ugly didn't bother Kyoani Kumiko, so they didn't bother drawing out an apology.

Seriously their interactions got cut short and altered so many times. KyoAni isn't this bad with baiting, this is even worse than Free, since even that show has more subtext than baiting. Honestly if they didn't have the yuribait this show would of been much better, since the drama was interesting. Now everyone will only remember it for its bait.</br>    <br><br> Being called ugly didn't bother Kyoani Kumiko, <br><br>Yes it did. She's always pissed about him and he never did apologize.<br><br> Kyoani wants people to root for the /u/ route from how they handled that finale. <br><br>I don't think the finale had any yuri in it.

You should also notice that Kumiko was never depressed after her date, as in the novel. You should also realize that novel Kumiko is virtually a completely different character from Kyoani Kumiko. Kumiko is cynical, a realist, but as her VA puts it, when Kumiko comes in contact with Reina she is meant to act like a middle school girl in love.</br></br></br>  <br> They should have interlocked their fingers at the stomp scene, instead the brofist replaced it, and they chose to have the interlocked fingers scene go to Reina. <br>The context is completely different though.</br></br>  <br>That's totally weird.

The team sat around to discuss what the very last thing they wanted to show the audience, and it was that interlocked hand holding. They gave us the meaning of Shuichi and Kumiko's relationship in the adaptation by doing the action twice; Natuski offering Kumiko the brofist and then Kumiko offering Shuichi the same. Kyoani didn't just replace the moment that was supposed to be romantic, they moved it, showing where they wanted the romantic gesture to go.</br>  BASED  <br><br>My fuckin' nigga.</br></br>   TFW there's ReinaxTaki fanart <br>thank you based gods</br>  <br>But it will never eclipse the number of yurishit fanart out there</br>  <br><br> Kumiko was never depressed after her date, <br><br>Yes but She was bothered by it. Take a look at when Reina asked Kumiko if she was concerned about Shuichi in episode 8. Tell me if Reina just smiled because she knew that Kumiko is single. Or the time when Kumiko lost track of her thoughts when Hazuki talked about her situation with Shuichi in the swings. They didnt completely remove everything. And Reina's VA also mentions that Reina is chuuni and could explain why she's very strangely intimate with Kumiko. I dont think there's not much difference between Anime Kumiko and Novel Kumiko aside from her fixation on Reina which Kyoani obviously turned it up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But it's quality, and that's all that matters.</br>  <br>In the novel Kumiko held hands with both Reina and Shuuichi within two different scenes. Kumiko and Shuuichi held hands before their performance to calm each other down. Reina and Kumiko did it because they won. The thing KyoAni did, was altered the Kumiko and Shuuichi scene into a bro fist and Shuuichi being more confidant or something. Either way they changed the dynamics a lot between these two and toned down practically all of there interactions. Kumiko in general is a different character from her novel counterpart. Anime Kumiko seems to be more developed then Novel Kumiko.</br>  <br> Its in Spanish. </br>  <br>It looks awesome though</br>  <br>I want to believe. I really really do.</br>  This show will always be remembered as shitty yuribait.  <br> Its in Spanish. </br>  <br>do you understand spanish?</br>  <br>Even so there should of been more clues before episode 8, of the two and their relationship. Kumiko's obsession with Reina was so annoying for the first episodes.</br>   Waiting for Shuichi to show up <br> He does, gets encouraged <br> Oh wait, I'm supposed to mad at this wanker <br> Pouts <br><br>Kumiko a cute. Cute I tell you!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I dont think there's not much difference between Anime Kumiko and Novel Kumiko <br>At this point, novelfags have stated that it's pointless to assume that what happens in the novel must happen in the adaptation. The show is loosely based on the novel, taking a key plot point here and there but Kyoani has taken free rein over the character relationships. Shu and Kumiko is not an impossible end in the adaptation, but at how hard Kyoani has been pushing it, promoting it, advertising it - neither is a Kumiko and Reina. Just at this point, Kumiko liking Reina looks more likely.</br></br>  <br> It should be in Nippon.  <br><br>Has pixiv become the new Tumblr.</br></br></br>   Thought it was a yuribait show when it was airing from looking at the threads sometimes  <br> keep in my backlog until it finishes <br> finally watch the first 4 episodes <br>It was painfully obvious reina liked taki and kumi was still butthurt over shu'd immaturity and it was made much clear thanks to the posts here . <br><br>Did kyoani alter too much ? If so is it going to be another tamako love story ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> showing where they wanted the romantic gesture to go. <br><br>This is what yurifags want to believe.</br></br></br>  <br>I see a quite a few pixiv artists post their art on tumblr now.</br>  <br>It could be implied as romantic had the situation been a romantic one, but it wasn't. They were supporting each other, expecting the results and achieving their goal. That hand represented that and there's nothing romantic in it.</br>  <br>I've seen some artist that post their stuff in english, never in spanish though. Regardless, if the art is good there shouldn't be complaints.</br>  Still nice to see yurifags clinging to their delusions for a yuri end in the anime.  <br> What has happened to pixiv.  <br><br>No one is safe from tumblrfags. <br><br>Taki's legs look awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They woudnt even see it as romantic if it werent for the fact they got spoiled about Shoe supposedly interlocking fingers with Kumiko.</br></br>  <br>Man, the drawing is 10/10. I hope to see more from that artist<br> Gotta learn spanish now. </br></br>  <br>They didn't have to show that, even making their arms awkward so that they could interlock their fingers. When you direct something, you want the final scene to have impact.<br><br><br>As the final scene it wasn't that big or impactful.<br>I felt like they were implying this was just the start, not a romantic conclusion, it was more like a subtle hint of what comes next - the real conclusion.</br></br></br></br></br>  Taki-sensei got Shuichi's back.  <br> The legs are still fucking awful.  <br><br>You must be desperate for art huh?</br></br></br>  <br> I felt like they were implying this was just the start <br>of course, Kumiko practically says it.</br></br>  <br>They're desperate for anything at this point. They'd even take Taki x Reina art if it came from tumblrwhales.</br>  <br>You sound way too bitter. Perhaps you're a mad yurifag because there's finally decent Taki x Reina art.</br>  I wonder what type of shenanigans they get up to.  <br><br>Kumiko's attraction for Shuichi has been vague and downplayed. Interlocking fingers now would have been unaturaand forced. Obviously an open - end. Reina still has the hots for Taki and Kumiko still hasnt made a conclusion regarding her feelings towards shoe. You can keep maturbating to your hand holding scene.</br></br>  <br>Thank god het keeps the landwhales away.</br>  <br>Really? Nah I'm a Shuuichi/Kumiko fan. I don't really like Reina to be honest. Also I like good art, not tumblr shit.</br>  <br>That subtle scene in pic related with her eyes brighting up for a split second upon Shuuichi's arrival, plus that scene you described make her cute as fuck.<br><br>It's also hinting that Kumiko feels something for Shuuichi. The subtleties are there, and I'm glad that they are. It's refreshing to see people's interaction without obvious cues (blushing when near the person they like or acting like a piece of shit).</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh wow. All these delicious salty tears.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt Kyoani would throw this important similarity and symbolism away just to pander to yurifags.</br></br>    <br>Why would it be unnatural? They just did it because they were calming each other down in the novel.</br>  <br> not tumblr shit. <br>There's nothing tumblr like in that set. And I guess you won't like it even if it's a masterpiece as long as Reina is in it. So sad.</br></br>  <br><br>I mean it would be unnatural in the anime obviously. Shuichi was never tense in the first place.</br></br>  <br> Pander to yurifags <br> Implying yurifags don't have their own counter symbolism <br>What is "Muh red string of fate" anon?<br>What is "Muh interlocking fingers" anon?<br>KyoAni went across the pandering line quite a while ago.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just think Kumiko's dedication to Reina is adorable. She's so cynical, yet she's an over the top middle school girl in love when it comes to Reina. She would do anything for her, "I would die for you!" and her usual distant self becomes just a cute girl in love.</br>  <br><br>Those are nothing but yuri bait. They dont hold weight</br></br>  <br>I guess. Still the interlocking scene with both cuties being nervous would of been adorable. Besides it would of also BTFO the yurifags.</br>  <br> Its in Spanish.  <br>Its totally tumblrshit.</br></br>  <br> Your symbolism doesn't matter but mine does. <br>Okay, that totally makes sense. <br>I can't stay mad at you when I see your numbers.</br></br></br>  <br>It's nowhere to be found on tumblr though. And the artist doesn't seem to have one.<br>Anything that isn't japanese or english is tumblr to you?</br></br>  Which one would you fuck? You can only pick one.  <br>The Euphonium.<br>Hibike's are too pure for sex.</br></br>  <br>"Supposedly"? Really? The page is right fucking there.</br>  <br>Frottage.</br>  <br><br>You're probably still in denial about the yuri bait. You dont even need to get spoiled by the novels to know. Episode 10 already tells you that and the fact this is Kyoani.</br></br>  <br><br>I meant the yurifags woudnt make a big deal out it.

It's from the original source.</br></br></br></br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki.   <br> Still in denial <br>Let's face it. 90% chance canon hetero ending is coming through if we get a second season. But the way it is now their relationship sucks, it's bland and one sided. I'm not in denial, I'm just hoping that we don't wind up with such a crappy end pairing and that the Shuuman gets developed or they go anime original.</br></br>  <br>Can't we agree that the source material (regarding the relationships at least) and the anime are different enough to not be comparable?<br>I'm not sure you can discount multiple super intimate scenes as bait just because "Muh source material's different!!"</br></br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>08434<br>Literally every appearance of Oboe-chan in the anime.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Pretty good, but Noguchi has got the drills, every night.</br>  Which Hibikek would be the leglocking type?  <br>But Shuu doesn't get a lot besides two scenes in the second novel. Its all about the second years and Taki's past.</br>  <br>So far, I woudn't say.</br>  Sorry guys, I tried to get her to do her cactus voice, but they didn't allow us to take video recordings. However, she said "I'm sorry!!" with the saddest look on her face that I actually felt bad for making such a ludicrous request.  <br>But that's not TakixReina</br>  <br>Megumi Fujii</br>  <br>Perfect</br>  <br>That's so cute ;-;</br>  <br>How crowded was it? I didn't even bother going since they were the only two VAs coming.</br>  <br>You know it, mate.</br>  <br><br>Well, I showed up at 8:30 on Friday and was 45th in standby (no chance in hell). Saturday I showed up at 7:30, and the line was somehow longer. I pretty much bought her autograph (Yuki Yuna collector's edition 1) as a last resort.<br><br>The day of, though, I showed up twenty minutes before the session, and there were about ten people ahead of me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What kind of people did you see there?  were there lots of landwhales? </br>  <br><br><br>10/10<br>pls make moar</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if you admit there's nobody as beautiful as Taki</br>  <br><br>It really wasn't too bad. There were two cute girls in front of me cosplaying as Kumiko and Reina (complete with instruments). I'm tempted to go as Shoe1 next year to take pictures with cute UFOs, but going as him without an accompanying Kumiko would probably be awkward as fuck.</br></br>  <br>He's all right in my book.</br>  <br>I need more sugar</br>  <br>I saw cosplay post with a kumiko and a reina and...they weren't great.</br>  <br>He's super sexy, and if I was gay, I would want him to give me musical lessons everyday until we pass out</br>  Was Natsuki ever improved upon?  <br>That's just the reference an anon drew over another anon's drawing.</br>  <br>YES.</br>  <br>It's not discounted just because of source material. It's primarily discounted because of how it was portrayed in the anime. The two girls don't act the least bit romantic outside of those scenes. Reina still confesses she loves Taki-Sensei. Kumiko does not look the least bit jealous about it (which she would even if she didn't take it seriously). Episode 12 and 13, the last two episodes, don't even have a hint of romantic attraction between the two girls - and episode 12 once again strongly hints that Reina is absolutely obsessed with Taki-Sensei, to the point of making her look like a comic relief character. <br><br>Episode 13 has a very strong implication that Kumiko likes Shuichi (toned down from the novels maybe, but still a very strong hint). The hand holding at the end doesn't look even remotely romantic - they're not even looking at each other, and there is absolutely no romantic atmosphere - it's two girls at an emotional time being extremely happy because their hard work paid off and they won at this part of the competition. The only reason why this hand holding is even brought up as romantic is due to meta reasons - fans who really want yuri end wanting to believe this was a sign from Kyoani by giving them the hand holding that was supposed to happen with the canon couple. The argument itself is as desperate as the astrology arguments used before the episode 13 aired.</br></br></br>  I'm going to marry Kumiko!  <br> The argument itself is as desperate as the astrology arguments used before the episode 13 aired. <br>That shit was so funny</br></br>  <br><br>B-But red strings mean that it's fated r-right guys?<br>Seriously though, I will be happy so long as any romantic resolution (if/when it does happen) has enough meaningful buildup for me to believe it.

Kumiko starts practicing hard, so hard that even her nose starts bleeding. She's under a lot of stress and is exhausted. At this point, Kumiko truly starts questioning the world around her. She tells Reina she also wants to become special. She starts bringing her instrument home and playing there. She gets into a shouting match win Shuichi despite the awkward situation between them. And finally, she realizes she loves playing her instrument, that she loves music, that she isn't doing it just because people around her do it.<br><br>Look the final scene of episode 12 - Kumiko is happy and excitedly talking about music to her best friend. Reina is stressed and freaking out because Kumiko talked about Taki. Kumiko wants to be special for herself. Reina wants to be special for Taki.<br><br>Then there's episode 13. Here, Kumiko is no longer Reina's follower. They're equals. Kumiko no longer acts in awe of Reina, or looks up to her for guidance. Reina isn't even the one to comfort Kumiko before they play, while Kumiko is the one who helps out Reina with the ponytail, at her request. Their dynamic changed.<br><br>I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if season 2 Reina stays the same way volume 2 Reina was. It would only show how Kumiko surpassed Reina.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reina BTFO.</br>  <br>If your post is that long, you know that it's riddled with useless shit. If you save that post so that you can paste it later, you know that you have autism.</br>  <br> Currently Shoeitchy hasn't delivered on that. <br>Kumiko and Shuichi literally start dating off-screen at the end of volume (season) 3.<br>They're not going to immediately hook up at the very first episode of season 2.<br>There is plenty of time to develop it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? it's not like Reina would care. Kumiko will keep being her friend, and that's all she cares about in regards to her.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Nozomi to talk to Kumiko at the pool about Mizore and her's backstory. Also Natsuki idolizing someone is gonna be cute.</br>  <br>Actually I just remembered it and looked it up on the archives by searching "surpassed Reina", I never bothered to save it.</br>  <br>Just read it you fucking lesbo</br>  <br>Shuuichi is barely in the second novel save for another daijobu scene in the last chapter. Season 2 is gonna focus on Taki and the second years. If they do a season 3 its going to focus heavily on the Eupho trio and Asuka.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Character development. Kumiko is the better character.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't they just develop it off the bat? As a yurifag I wouldn't have cared if they just stuck with a faithful adaptation, but they didn't. Even with some "bait" I wouldn't have cared if Shu and Kumiko were the promoted romance, but they didn't. They charged past the line of "bait" and went for something that now makes Shu look bad in comparison. Even with another season people would still be thrown off by the sudden push for the couple that wasn't even a prominent aspect of the novel.</br>  <br>Reina's love is the cutest one though.</br>  <br>Reina was also barely a character before the festival.<br>Shuichi wasn't supposed to show up at all in episode 12.<br>I'm sure Kyoani is going to give us both more original scenes with Reina and more original scenes with Shuichi in season 2, even if they have nothing with the plot, just to add more screen time for them. <br>There is no longer a reason to downplay Shuichi like there was in season 1.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like Asuka's love for her father better, especially since she goes through so much just to play his Eupho.</br>  <br> They charged past the line of "bait" <br>But they didn't.<br>The only time it seemed like it would be more than just bait was immediately after episode 8 aired.<br>When episode 9 aired, it was already obvious it's just bait.<br>Then episode 10 clearly cemented it with Taki comment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure why you feel the need to copypasta a random anon's tenuous rambling about what the story meant into every fucking thread. Just because it's long doesn't mean it's well thought-out.</br>  I appreciate novelanon translating the novels, i just hope he doesnt get tired or burned out. I hope we at least reach vol 2  <br>It's fucking amazing you faggot. Try to find a flaw<br>protipc: /u/ fucking can't </br></br>  Natsuki/Yuuko OTP  <br>There's the same reason they've always had - they clearly don't care much for the character.</br>  <br>It's not him dude</br>  <br>But he's not a main character for the second novel. KyoAni needs to focus on Taki and the second years. Mizore and Nozomi's plot is the main one. They can't cut their scenes for Shuuichi. Maybe they'll add small hints between him and Kumiko, but I can't see them make original scenes for him. <br><br>They only made Reina relevant in the anime because she was an important character in the novel, since she was the one that awakened Kumiko's love for music. So her scenes made sense. The only thing I don't get is why KyoAni had to downplay the Shuuichi scenes.</br></br></br>  <br>Cute. Isn't that from the novel artist? I need Mizore/Nozomi art. I need it bad.</br>  <br>The entire thing is trying to read meaning into personal interpretations of individual scenes that was never part of the story's overall theme. It's pure posthoc justification.</br>  <br><br>well whoever it is i want me some Nozomi and Oboe drama.</br></br>  What's your otp, /a/?  <br>Oboe dedicating her solo to Flute.</br>  <br> Maybe they'll add small hints between him and Kumiko, but I can't see them make original scenes for him. <br>That's similar to what I'm thinking of.<br>They might give him a little bit of screen time, a conversation here and there. It's not going to be anything major.<br>It's like what they've done in episodes 11 and 12. Shuichi having troubles playing was completely anime original. And the whole plot point takes like what, 3 minutes in total across those both episodes? They can do stuff like that, no problem.<br><br>The same with Reina. She'll definitely not be as important as she was in season one, but she'll probably get a few more conversations here and there, since that's what people expect.<br><br> The only thing I don't get is why KyoAni had to downplay the Shuuichi scenes. <br>They wanted people to speculate on the yuri and talk about the show more, I guess. If they didn't downplay it, no one would take yuri seriously. But now that it's obvious Reina is into Taki, there is no reason to keep doing that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Azusa x Shuichi.</br></br>  <br><br>this<br/></br></br>  <br>Sorry, meant for this<br/></br>  <br><br><br> The story arc between Kumiko and Reina was Kumiko outgrowing Reina and leaving her behind. <br>In the novel? Reina didn't matter until the festival. In the adaptation, she's in the opening scene, she drives the inner conflict Kumiko has in the first few episodes. Then in episode 8 they finally get to connect with each other.<br> She's fascinated by Reina because Reina is different. <br>In the beginning it's actually Reina who was fascinated by Kumiko. Kumiko didn't want to upset Reina, she wanted her approval (i.e the vote, the panicked crosswalk scene)<br> The two befriend each other, and Kumiko becomes captivated by Reina during the festival. <br>At this point, Kumiko becomes Reina's follower, if not a worshiper.<br>Kumiko had been thinking of Reina since the first episode. On the show she likens following Reina to following the yuki onna, willing to chase something beautiful despite fear or better judgement.<br> The two develop a strong friendship and Reina even admits to Kumiko her innermost secret, that she loves Taki. <br>This isn't a deep dark secret.<br><br>1/2</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it'll mostly be casual, until the scene at Kansai. I don't know I just have a feeling they'll just downplay him again. <br><br>Reina is important in the second novel, but its only when Taki is involved, so her and Kumiko will have their scenes. <br><br>Kumiko though will mostly be around the second years and Asuka. So she'll be way too busy with the upperclassman to think about romance. Not to mention they'll be a lot of Yuribait between the second years, although is it yuribait or subtext concerning Oboe and Flute and Natsuki and Yuuko? I don't know.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Reina starts showing cracks, she doubts herself and this time it's up to Kumiko to comfort Reina. <br>This was Kumiko voicing how she felt about Reina in episode 8, a flashback where she sees Reina on the mountain and confesses how Kumiko's va puts it "Chuunibyou, middle school girl big love", that showy all or nothing dramatic love displayed by middle school girls.<br> Kumiko truly starts questioning the world around her. She tells Reina she also wants to become special. She starts bringing her instrument home and playing there. She gets into a shouting match win Shuichi despite the awkward situation between them. And finally, she realizes she loves playing her instrument, that she loves music, that she isn't doing it just because people around her do it. <br>This was just showing Kumiko has a love for music and for the euphonium she didn't think she wanted. As Natsuki put it, "You don't particularly like the things you're good at." Kumiko is good, but when she needs to be really good she realizes how much she wants to reach that point.<br><br>2/3 actually</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kumiko is happy and excitedly talking about music to her best friend. Reina is stressed and freaking out because Kumiko talked about Taki. Kumiko wants to be special for herself. Reina wants to be special for Taki. <br>The last scene was lighthearted, something to smile or laugh at.<br>  Here, Kumiko is no longer Reina's follower. They're equals. Kumiko no longer acts in awe of Reina, or looks up to her for guidance. Reina isn't even the one to comfort Kumiko before they play, while Kumiko is the one who helps out Reina with the ponytail, at her request. Their dynamic changed <br>Kumiko and Reina are very comfortable with each other and seek each other out at every opportunity. The "changing of dynamic" seems like a stretch, Reina put her hair up once before when they were taking turns carrying each other's instruments up the mountain. Instead of just tying her hair herself, Reina goes to Kumiko and relies on her to do it, showing that Reina isn't such a lone wolf anymore. At the final scene we see the throwback to the first episode. Reina originally cried tears of anger in fetal position, and stomped off after talking to Kumiko. In the second contrasting scene, Reina is crying tears of joy when she grabs on to Kumiko instead of grabbing herself, and the wordless exchange is followed by them holding hands and then tightening their grip on each other.<br><br>Instead of Kumiko outgrowing Reina in this weird 2deep4u analysis, it would be more likely Reina was growing out of her chuuni tendencies and Kumiko was growing into a chuuni. <br><br>3/3</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The opening scene is from the prologue of the first novel.</br>  <br>But Reina doesn't matter in the novel until the festival. Kyoani's version has her show up in every episode involved with Kumiko in one way or another.</br>  <br>Doujin fucking when?</br>  <br>She does matter in the novel. KyoAni just made it more important. Reina was basically the one that triggered Kumiko since the closing ceremony at their junior high. KyoAni just built up their relationship so that the festival scene wouldn't look out of the blue.</br>  <br> the festival scene wouldn't look out of the blue. <br>It would have looked out of the blue because Reina doesn't matter until the festival.</br></br>  <br>Brilliant.<br>taki/10</br></br>  <br>You just need to keep praising him and I'll give more~  it's quite late though so I'll go to sleep soon </br>  I watched one episode of this then got flashbacks to years of playing alto sax all of primary school and junior high, and now I have a few amazon tabs open.  <br>Thanks m8.<br>I'll think of some more praise.<br>Good night.</br></br></br>  <br>As soon as someone talented gets into them. So never.</br>  wish someone would pick up the mango. i need more hibike material  What's Kumiko thinking of?<br><br><br>Yeah, I mean did the anon actually do further work upon the drawing.</br></br></br>  <br> no i didn't </br>  <br> What's Kumiko thinking of? <br>How many children to have with him and with what position.</br></br>  <br> and with what position. <br>Missionary</br></br>  <br>That's the best. You get lots of pleasure while looking at the face of your lover.<br>Yes. It suits them.</br></br>  <br>Of coursh.</br>  <br>do it.<br>i pulled the trigger on a digital piano after a few years away from playing after watching shigatsu wa kimi no uso.<br>been playing consistently for a full year now and i love it all over again.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Most of these aren't really disagreements, they're just semantic arguments. Wanting approval instead of fascination, Kumiko comforting Reina in a "chuuni" way is still comforting Reina, etc.<br><br> Instead of Kumiko outgrowing Reina in this weird 2deep4u analysis, it would be more likely Reina was growing out of her chuuni tendencies and Kumiko was growing into a chuuni.  <br><br>This is the main gist of the argument:<br><br>Kumiko starts off as a "follower" and by the end is her own person who is willing to stand up for herself. She does what she does because she likes it, not because it's expected of her. She is her own person now. Her relationship with Reina isn't that she desperately wants her approval anymore (pre-ep8), or that she's mesmerized by her (ep8). Instead, at the end of the show, they're friends. Reina is not "above" Kumiko anymore.<br><br>Reina's growth is that she starts depending on another person (Kumiko), but that didn't fundamentally change her personality. Reina is still Reina.<br><br>That's what was meant by Kumiko outgrowing Reina. It's not that they'll stop being friends, or anything like that. It's that Kumiko changed a lot, while Reina didn't. Reina might still change if they make her open up more in the future (apology for smugness being a sign of it).<br><br>Just one thing:<br> This isn't a deep dark secret. <br>It is pretty important for Reina, considering how deeply she believes she loves him. I doubt she would be willing to admit it to anyone else at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I don't think I miss playing a woodwind, I kind of miss the memories of band with friends. I currently play the guitar and am looking to buy a vintage strat, so I don't think I can afford to pick up another expensive instrument. I probably shouldn't have quit band to focus on biology in the first place.</br>  <br>Oh, and I forgot to say, thats pretty cool anon. I love hearing how people starting playing instruments.</br>  <br><br>Kumiko is rather sadistic when it comes to Shoe and obviously he is a beta and a push over. I wont be surprised if Kumiko uses a strap on.</br></br>  Real men play the classical guitar.  <br>Real men play  nothing because they were too poor to buy an instrument and invest time into practice so they don't end up as worthless fuckups with no talent. </br>  <br>I played the classical guitar for a few months before switching to acoustic. It's not fun,it's awkward but helped me learn the fret board. My teacher spent more time filing my nails and kicking my feet into position than actually teaching me. She swore by sheet music and wouldn't let me look at tabs. 2/10 would not recommend, I would rather be a fake man.</br>  Anybody knows spanish?  <br>Some anon wanted me to read it, I did, and was unimpressed with the rambling bullshit. And if you take Reina's crush on Taki as fully realized love unironically then there is no hope for you.</br>  <br>I believe I stated that Reina deeply BELIEVES that she loves him.</br>  Hey, without hesitating anymore<br>I can believe of a future where I’m with you<br>More than any words, because you’re merely by my side<br><br>If I was once more reborn to come seek love<br>I’ll bring to you, a flower with a graceful color<br><br>Even if I’ve seen all the beautiful things in the world gathered before my eyes<br>It doesn’t compare to here where you’re holding my hand<br>Just by you smiling right now I can go on living<br>It doesn’t compare to here where you’re holding my hand<br><br>The place where I found love</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When I was in band in high school, most people rented instruments like in the anime, so there was no need to spend thousands just to play a big brass instrument like the tuba. People who played smaller instruments like flute and clarinet could buy cheap models for maybe around $150-200, but they were still relatively expensive for any high school student.<br><br>Not many people practiced outside of school either, but I was in the "beginner" concert band and never moved on, so I wouldn't know about the symphonic band or wind ensemble. All the freshmen/first years had to take concert band, so there was a mix of people who just started their instruments of choice or played since elementary/middle school. Of course, the people who took it seriously practiced a lot and took lessons, but a lot of people sounded fucking terrible by themselves because they barely ever practiced. Not even just the newbies sounded bad, but people who played early on in middle school played horribly because they never took their instruments home or took band seriously. We were kind of like what the band was in the anime before Taki came in, but we weren't rebellious about practicing during sectionals and didn't sound nearly as bad as an ensemble. We still did pretty well in the competitions because of the few who played exceptionally well and the amount of effort we put during in-class practices, though. From what I remember, a lot of freshmen, including me, quit after that, but I went to a school where it was normal to take 3-4 APs by your sophomore year.<br><br>Honestly, if you want to be proficient enough at your instrument at the high school level, 30 minutes a day is enough. Surely you had that extra amount of time every day, or maybe even now. Lessons and long practice sessions (2 hours at least) aren't necessary unless you want to be the best in your section. I regret quitting because schoolwork and general lack of enthusiasm boggled me down at the time, but it was for the best.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well that was a fucking mouthful.<br>Thanks to anyone who read all of it, I guess.</br></br>   Ui 2.0   <br>They never should have gotten rid of the ponytail.</br>  Which section and why?  <br>Agreed.</br>  <br><br>Crime againsts humanity.</br></br>  <br>Leave</br>  <br>UFOs obviously, 3 of the top 5 girls in the show in one section?

But IF she doesn't want to she'll just lie there with a bored look on her face, limp as a doll and avoiding any eye contact until you finish.</br>  <br>Yeah, this doesn't turn me on.</br>  Is she the girl who Taki chews out earlier in the anime?<br><br><br>What's with all the lies and slander you fucking commie.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to marry Oboe-chan.</br>  <br>I have no love for washed up, bitchy onee-sans trying to impose their misguided will on their innocent imoutos because of their own personal failings in life.

Music and geography matters also require research.<br><br>Reason why I'm updating by parts (pretty much first time I'm doing this) is because I think I'll be slow, and so dishing out content for discussion periodically (trying to do it weekly updates at least). Outcomes so far compared to anime are 90% the same, but the processes and events that lead to the outcomes are mostly different. So my personal opinion would be that the novel is really very different, as opposed to another anon who felt it's very similar.

Anons dislike her because no fun allowed.</br>  <br>Because she's a slut!<br><br>SLLUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT!</br></br></br>  <br>Because if I like her, she'll get KeyAIDS and die.</br>  <br>Because /a/ irrationally hates characters for stupid reasons.</br>  Probably because she's going to make the MC stop being an asshole and they probably enjoy MC as an asshole.  <br>The little sister was set up for getting the KeyAIDS though, I think others are fine as long as she's alive.</br>  Manipulative bitch   anime name is charlotte <br> none of the characters is named charlotte <br><br>ok</br></br></br>  Has she done something wrong?  <br> Implying Charlotte isn't the childhood friend that became bitter because NotLelouch forgot her </br>  <br>She's very pretty. I wonder if she'd like anal sex.</br>  <br>This is anime. The title relating to the content of the show in any way - or even making any kind of sense - is entirely optional.</br>  <br>A few things, yes. <br>But it was just now confirmed she's shit tier.</br></br>  <br>Ruined Kanye's entire life, although she'll probably blow him to make up for it.</br>  <br>Ruined our edgy MC dreams in less than 10 minutes then stole his imouto right in front of him</br>  <br>I love her voice.</br>  <br>Ghost blowjob?</br>  <br>She ruined the show. Nothing good if she around mc.</br>  BEcause she is a cunt bigger then the MC but she can get away with it because she has a vagina  <br>He ruined it by himself for cheating, or do you think he would have made the test?</br>  <br>I dont hate dead people.</br>  <br> because she has a vagina <br><br>This hasn't been confirmed. If the MC of Ranpo Kitan is a boy then I am not feeling safe until we see some full frontal nudity.</br></br></br>  So how long do you think before the whole government lab rats and the secret facility shows up in the plot?  <br>Edgy mc kinda rekt her when he said if she was going to play that she had to leave. The imouto is a qt3.14 and the white haired invisibility chick, forgot her name is still pretty good</br>  <br> interrupts the moeblob train <br> introduces characters with superpowers <br>This is OK. At least it feels like the KeyAIDS train has been delayed.</br></br></br>  <br> although she'll probably blow him to make up for it. <br>not until inevitable VN is released</br></br>  <br>So much this.</br>  <br>Her breasts.<br> inb4 pads <br>Also this isn't fujoshit.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she hasn't had any consequences for her actions yet while MC-kun has.<br><br>MC-kun has also not retaliated against her beatdown while earlier he was shown making trucks crash. Seemingly because she's a cute girl that should get away with everything.</br></br></br>  <br> watching fujoshit </br>  <br>Ranpo Kitan MC is canonically master of disguise and crossdressing as young woman. He`ll be able to disguise himself as woman even totally naked.</br>  <br>Or because it looks like a girl<br>Same thing</br></br>  <br>He didnt mention Gangsta, what are you on about?</br>  <br>I don't remember them being that big tbh<br><br><br>To be fair I went in knowing nothing except it was a mystery of some kind<br><br><br>I think we've all tried to master the "look like you have a vagina" technique</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She caused property and financial damage that created more cons in real life than outing MC's secret.<br><br>That flower shop, all those bicycle owners, etc got their property wrecked by that teleporting faggot tailing MC on bitch's orders.</br></br></br>  She's a goody goody, no fun allowed.<br>Basically the Azusa of the series.</br>  <br>And Kanye crashed a truck because he was horny, not because he was trying to capture someone with super powers.</br>  The long haired cunt is better  <br>Azusa was lovely.</br>   mc can't wreck invisibility moralfag <br>what a weak ass faggomaster</br>  She shot down Hachiman  <br> no fun allowed, unless I do it* </br>   female with dominant personality <br> messes with "muh based MC" <br>Do you really have to ask, OP?</br></br>  Because she ruined the chance that the show was just going to be about MC being a cool guy going about his day to day life as a badass  <br> Why is she so perfect? </br>  Because it showed how much of a pussy beta fag the MC really is.<br>He should refuse to go to that new school and posses that bitch girl and then kill her</br>  <br> take hold of Sonic <br> speed kick her into oblivion <br>is that easy</br></br></br>  <br>Could he even use another person's power? <br>Not just "Can he use it while he's in another person's body?", but also, "Would he even know how to activate their powers?"</br></br>  <br>She and Torpedoman destroyed the MC´s perfect school life.<br>Ok, he was a douche, but he was the viewer´s self-insert.</br></br>  But wouldnt it be easier to get a girl to like you to posses her and then have her hold your hand or something and then pretend it was her the one who did it?  <br>Do we?</br>  <br>It really bothers me that it seems as though you're not joking at all.</br>  <br>1. Take over her body<br>2. Strip yourself naked in 5 seconds<br>3. Run away<br><br>There.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would I be? Dont you know how anime girls work?<br>She would get confused and then think she actually must like him if she is doing all these lewd things unconsciously</br></br>  <br> he was the viewer´s self-insert <br>The real reason people hate her, and I hope we all know that self-inserting is only for the lowest kind of faggot.</br></br>  <br> not self-inserting </br>  <br>It really bothers me that it seems as though you're not joking at all.</br>  <br> not killing your ego and becoming one with the whole anime <br>Get on my level, faggot</br></br>  Special delivery for /a/.  <br>I'd rescue her and win her heart if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I'd walk her home gently if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Is there a return address?</br>  <br>ewww, someone left a bag of shit girl at my door. Oh well, at least they didn't light it on fire.</br>  <br>Not what I ordered. Please send her back.</br>   that tear <br>H-hot.

Her ass is pretty nice too.</br>  <br><br>Cereas voice needed more power, Snek voice was pretty bad. Rest was ok.</br></br>  Spoilers are out, manga kansou lives again.  <br>Sure, Grisha being from the outside makes sense, but that could have been inferred from everything we knows so far, so no need to spend this much panel time on Shadis/Carla/Grisha stuff for one measly piece of info we already strongly suspected.</br>  <br>I think it's more likely that Grisha was some sort of leader and Eren is his only heir.</br>   Inb4 Grisha is royalty from outside the Walls.   <br>Stalling. Remember when we all thought Historia would give answers about the wall titans and all we got was a sad backstory.</br>  <br>Wall Titans seem to be forgotten in general.</br>  Goodbye and good riddance to this Gaiden, it really soured toward the end. Hey, it's just like the original series!<br><br>It seems like the latest arc in Black Clover is ending. I'm going to give the series a few more chapters to get entertaining otherwise I'll be knocking it off the list until it does.<br><br>There's still no new series in the English magazine. I don't know if there WILL be at this point. If there is, I hope it's Straighten Up!, because apparently it's doing well right now and should probably last a decent while  Maybe it'll take another month or so for a new series to enter Viz Jump. I remember when Black Clover entered they did like two weeks of multiple chapter releases to catch up.<br><br>If you read Blue Exorcist/Ao no Exorcist, here is a DDL of chapter 69: http://www23.zippyshare.com/v/NtuB5<wbr>1C5/file.html<br>I don't know why you read this, but I won't judge you.

I'm not dissing it, but it's weird.<br><br>Like, if you really love Saber, I could see someone preferring Fate to the other routes, but you like Rin the most? What do you see in the Fate route that's superior?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Quite a lot actually. It and Sakura get at least as much fanart nowadays than everyone else. And it gets plenty of Japanese fanfiction too. The reaction to the route is much more positive than it was in 2004, both in the west and east. <br><br>Nasu mentions in Sakura's dictionary entry that she is one of the staffs favorites. With Aotsuki, Koyama, BLACK, OKSG, and more prominent members loving her.<br><br>That, and over the years, Sakura has gotten more and more fans and climbs up the complete character poll each time it's shown. Being in the top ten of every character in the company constantly (in an international poll no less) is impressive. She hasn't unseated Rin or Saber, but people that still harp about her being unpopular kind of miss the point. And that is with much less exposure than Rin or Saber get.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>just personal feelings. the Fate route is the most coherent and substantial one to me, though I'm not a Saberfag. I suspected Rin to fuck me over until the end because she got her special intro with the summoning of Archer, her dissapointment because she preferred Saber, those "vague" excuses why she wants to stay around. Tohsakas actions towards the end blew me away. though it's not the route centered around her I liked her best in this one. UBW seemed a little bit too forced with Archer and this whole Hero of Justice thing, I expected him to be an awesome Heroic Spirit but from the whole cast of servants he probably was the most lame one, in the end it was pretty much the nice but nothing special Tohsaka love route. HF was a little bit too much, I didn't like Sakura from the beginning but at least she has some development in character in this one, also Rider has a major role which is a plus to me.</br></br>  <br>Cut half of it and officially make it the Illya route.</br></blockquote>]
