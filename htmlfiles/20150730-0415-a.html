[ Several hours to the invasion of earth by Stardust, no YuYuYu thread, let me correct it  <br>Soon.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I was out of the loop for a while.<br>Do we have chara designs for the other four yet?</br></br>   Jap sword <br>Confirmed for the Tougo level of shit</br>  <br>only these two and Chikage Kouri revealed so far</br>  <br> Chikage Kouri <br>Please post.</br></br>    <br> that casual clothes Wakaba <br><br>Wonderful.</br></br></br>  Wakaba &gt; Chikage &gt; Hinata  <br>Guess we've got our OTP now, huh. From what I can make out of Hinata's description<br> Uesato Hinata  <br> Wakaba's childhood, as well as, best friend <br> Often taking care of Wakaba <br> Has a mild personality but actually really strong <br> Always protecting Wakaba's soul <br>And something about Wakaba<br> Serious <br> Has a strong will and body but easily fall for lies and such. <br><br>Chapter 1 will begin in 2015, 3 years before the real story starts. Wakaba and Hinata in those casual clothes are in 4 grade.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Outlaw Wonderland -zero- <br> Author: Tanaka Romeo <br>Sweet, I never heard of it but if it's Romeo it's worth taking a look. I hope we get scans for that too.</br></br></br>  <br>Some new info<br> As Wakaba is Sonoko's ancestor, this story will reveal many things about the Nogi household <br> Will also touch on the subject of how important a miko is <br> In Nowayu, the existence of Heroes is not a secret. The whole mankind are aware of Vertices' threat. </br></br></br></br>  <br> also touch on the subject of how important a miko is <br>Tougou confirmed for Messiah.</br></br>  <br>YuYuYu also kind hinted at Tougou is quite important as a messenger, further increase the chance that Yuuna got boosted into godhood</br>  I wonder how soon we'll find out what their Yuuna looks like and get to start speculating beyond wild guesses on what their connection is.  <br>I'm fully expecting her to look exactly like Yuuna.</br>  <br>If she does, we probably won't get an actual picture showing it till it's halfway through, and we'll never get to see what she's thinking.</br>  <br>Don't know how reliable this bit of info is but apparently   grade school Wakaba had to see her new friends getting slaughtered in front of her.  </br>  <br>Are you getting this from 2ch and/or other nip sites?</br>  <br>From here: http://otakomu.jp/archives/284065.h<wbr>tml<br>The spoiler bit is not included in the main article so I don't know if it's valid or not.</br></wbr></br>  Wait what's happening? I didn't follow the other threads.  <br>This is really old news so I don't know how out of the loop you are but, a new LN is being released. It's set 300 years before the anime when the vertex first attacked and the protagonist is Sonoko's ancestor, Nogi Wakaba, hence the name NoWaYu.<br><br>There was also a new LN chapter with the usual Yuushas set after Sonoko After and confirmation that there will be more stuff released with the YuYuYu team, though format was not specified.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, I thought it was an anime announcement or something like that.</br>  <br>When the new LN is getting released?</br>  <br>The newest LN chapter is the one where the Yuushas find the old diary in Sonoko's house, right? And it's only 3 pages long?</br>  Does the new VN already have a full translation patch?<br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Read the OP again.</br>  <br> no male characters <br>I'm glad they know how to keep policies that are working.</br></br>   Wakaba's hair style and personality are somewhat similar to Sumi <br> Hinata's Hinatas and personality are somewhat similar to Tougou  <br>This feels so weird.</br></br>  Definitely seems like this is going to be another darkness-absorbing LN so they can give Yuuna a happy ending in the anime. I hope they at least manage to reincarnate or something.    Chikage and Hinata's last names now are different than what we got about a month ago, right? Is it a mistake? Or will we have a story explanation?  <br>They got mistranslated the first time.</br>  <br> There was also a new LN chapter with the usual Yuushas set after Sonoko After <br>Can I get a link?</br></br>  <br>Yuuna remembering the girls who sacrificed themselves to let her return to her own time.</br>  <br> https://mega.co.nz/#!bEkXnSRK!UTcDo<wbr>kywlhMvp3u1qlL6DviKC80yigoPzAoPGARV<wbr>H3k</wbr></wbr> </br>  <br> Thanks. I forgot, wasn't there a blog with info on YYY compiled? I remember there being one with VN translations </br>  <br>Japanese names are a bitch. Even if you know how a name is written you don't necessarily know how it's pronounced, so people have to make guesses and sometimes those guesses turn out to be wrong.</br>  <br> http://otakomu.jp/archives/284065.<wbr>html</wbr> <br>Do they   lose their families as well? Are they living by themselves on Shikoku? Like the Inubozaki sisters do in the future? </br></br>  http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3930730756<wbr></wbr>  <br>They show them as both 14 and as 4th graders.<br>Looks like there'll really be a timeskip then.</br></br>  <br>The story begin at 2018 but most of the chapter being recalling on what happen in 2015, then towards the end it back to 2018.</br>  Spoiler time thread<br><br>ネタバレ】 ワンピース７９５話 『一の目』 確定<br>2015年07月29日18:12 【ワンピース】　最新ネタバレ・画バレ一覧 写真あり<br><br>The name of chapter is "One eye"<br><br>Fujitora did a dice gambling with Maynard. If the dice indicates "1", Fujitora wins.<br>Depending on the result of gambling, Fujitora decided not to arrest Luffy and Law tonight. Maynard is embarassed with it and still tries to persuade Fujitora. It seems marine managed to find the place where Luffy is hiding.<br><br>Fujitora says that Maynard is not manly since he continues complaining after the gamble ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  First for Robin  second for Robin  <br>How can one man be so<br>B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>nooooice</br></br>  I bet fujitora used his gravity powers to rig the dice  <br>Most likely, just like he probably did with the roulette. Zatoichi also cheated when gambling so it fits.</br>  who is maynard?  <br>Vice-Admiral, was inside the arena during the tournament, got his ass kicked by Barto.</br>  <br>He is the secret admiral who also goes by the name Spee D. Reader</br>  <br>Sounds like Fujitora is mad that he is the lone traitor faggot Marine who acts like such a faggot while Maynard actually wants to do his job to arrest pirates based on common sense and not something as stupid as basing decisions on a coin or dice.<br><br>I can see Fujitora getting ditched by the marines under him eventually since it is Fujitora that is banned from all bases and not people like Maynard.<br><br>Maynard has a snail phone as well since he is a Vice Admiral so high chances Maynard can not tolerate Fujitora's actions anymore and tells Akainu that Fujitora has no intention to do his job correctly and to send another Admiral to Dressrosa.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Saka-san pls</br>  What's up, /a/, vizanon here. Been a while since I've been able to visit a thread thanks to uni and travel.<br><br>Imgur here, as always, and up to date: http://vizanon.imgur.com/<br><br>Dumping the previous chapter now, since it doesn't look like any new spoiler info is coming in the immediate future.</br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw akainu himself appears right after the strawhats fuck off </br>  <br>Are you ready for all this exposition?</br>  <br>A quick recap first.</br>  <br>Doesn't apply to me since I read raws but bless you nonetheless</br>  <br>Robin is so beautiful. I wish she would kiss me.</br>  <br>beat up Bartolomeo's second in command, Gambia<br><br>got his ass whooped for it</br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br>I want to see more of Dragon's ship. It looks so cool.</br>  <br>anon pls</br>  <br><br><br>POST MORE ROBIN</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Fujitora.<br><br>How is it not common sense to arrest pirates at night when they can not fight back and are at their weakest?<br><br>That way, the marines have less risk of injuring themselves and higher rate of success.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gotta love how nonchalant Dragon is about Luffy being his son. He's definitely part of the family.</br>  Another fucking filler chapter? This piece of shit really wants to delay anything interesting until chapter 800. I would have prefered a longer Doffy fight over this unnecessary garbage.  <br><br><br>You do know Maynard is going to be the one to kill Blackbeard, right?</br></br></br>  <br>with pleasure</br>    <br>I'm not big on the anime, but I'm actually pretty keen to see this hug animated.</br>    <br>The best detail here is Franky's tears making his face spark. He's a true cartoon robot now.<br><br>And that's the end of it. Hoping for 19 pages this week.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Holy fuck.</br></br>  <br>Well, seeing how the bet was if Fujitora "wins" they wont go after the stawhats, it's likely that Fuji doesnt want to arrest the strawhats in the first place. Not everyone is a corrupt justicefag like Akainu.</br>  <br>Oda just need to keep inventing reasons for the Marines to act so beta and not do anything about the pirates.<br><br>Every chapter makes Fujitorafags who claim Fujitora is still a Marine lose their remaining arguments as well.<br><br>He is purposely not doing his job and has no intention of capturing Law and Luffy.<br><br>He also admitted to Fujitora on phone that he actually delays information to Akainu and will even edit out the content to suit his personal purposes.<br><br>I don't see Fujitora having a career as a Marine much longer.<br><br>And I doubt he is gonna be allowed to leave peacefully and will be killed by the Marines to get back the Devil Fruit they gave him.<br><br>And the offficial Marine executioner in One Piece has always been Kizaru and since Z did not die in the manga, high chances Fujitora is gonna fulfill Z's role to show how cold blooded Kizaru out of all the Marines since Kizaru did not cry at all while killing Z.<br><br>And I doubt Akainu is that much of an idiot to still trust Fujitora after Fujitora admitted all of that and does not respect the chain of command.<br><br>Akainu probably ordered backup to be sent to Dressrosa just in case Fujitora really does not plan to follow orders.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post yfw<br> Sabo is escaping <br> he sees the marines, thinks they'll be going after Luffy <br> attacks the Marines, everyone gets sucked in <br> all-out war <br> Luffy wakes up, goes to save Sabo <br> Marines have to release Doflamingo to help them <br> Doffy uses birdcage <br> Dressrosa nearly restarted <br>You can't get off Oda's wild Dressrosa ride.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why do people care for fanmade images that doesn't even resemble the original art style?<br>You can literally make every single character in the history of manga look good by changing proportions, body and the face.</br></br></br>  <br> He is purposely not doing his job and has no intention of capturing Law and Luffy. <br>That's like saying the marines stationed at that island where Luffy met Zoro and dropped Coby off at aren't marines for not immediately capturing Luffy.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off pirate scum lover.<br><br>A lot of innocent countries got destroyed thanks to Luffy's actions at Impel Down and part of the reason why Sengoku resigned.<br><br>Hannyabal was entirely right about Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Muh dick.</br></br>  <br><br>Same with Akainu not capturing Luffy the first time they met or later on at Water 7 after the Enies Lobby incident had resolved itself.</br></br>  <br>They aren't marines and likely got magma fisted like they deserved for trying to desert from the war since they were such Luffyfags.</br>  <br><br>You were saying, magma brat?</br></br>  <br>Fuck, not Akainu. Made a mistake there. Aokiji.</br>  <br><br> Akainu <br><br>You mean Kuzan.<br><br>Akainu would've killed them all right there and then.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Stay mad, Saka</br>  Not sure why people are surprised by fujitora's actions. It's obvious that his perception of justice is different from the traditional marines. Hell, he probably didn't want to be a marine in the first place. He's aware that the strawhats have literally saved 2 countries, while the marines basically enabled those tragedies to happen. I wouldn't be surprised if he just cleaned up after the strawhats as they steamroll the rest of the new world, like taking in kaido after the battle.  <br>here is your reply</br>  <br>Anyone who blindly follows the system is the true betas. Fujitora is alpha as fuck.</br>  <br>Fujitora would spare Jaguar.<br><br>Aokiji would not.<br><br>And Aokiji did not know that Luffy was Dragon's Son yet.<br><br>Akainu after finding out Luffy was Dragon's son prioritized Luffy 2nd to Ace.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   yfw doffy is called "Heavenly Demon", because he who was ones a Tenryuubito - and therefore living in heaven - came down to the world and turned against heaven becoming the gods natural enemy - a demon <br>Now why the fuck is Kuma called Tyrant?</br>  <br>People like you are why mexican drug cartel leaders easily so escape from prison.<br><br>We need to bring back the guillotine.</br></br></br>  <br>this is nice</br>  <br>Because, he crusades in the name of Jesus and conquers places for Jesus</br>  <br>Sorry but Fujitora is beta as fuck.<br><br>Bird Cage wouldn't have destroyed all those buildings if Fujitora wanted to stop it.<br><br>Fujitora ain't gonna be paying for Dressrosa's reconstruction efforts when he could have prevented such a thing from being needed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Whaaaat? Are you saying that an Admiral would ignore a mere pirate, even if they don't have an infamous man as a parent? Preposterous.<br><br>A pirate is a pirate. Luffy being Dragon's son makes him more important as a target, but it doesn't change his status as a pirate and how the marines should treat him.</br></br></br>  <br>He had a reputation for being particularly violent, I'm assuming it has something to do with his revolutionary days/government propaganda</br>  <br> comparing mexican drug carel leaders to someone who freed two countries from corruption.  <br>Okay</br></br>  <br>Kizaru ignored everyone else besides the Strawhats on Shabody because the Strawhats was his current job.<br><br>Kizaru could have seastone cuffed everybody but Luffy was his current target.<br><br>Same goes for Aokiji. Luffy was not his target at the time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, let's just conveniently forget the fact that he orchestrated the largest prison break ever AND practically declared war on the 41 countries.</br>  Fujitora is best marine  <br><br>41 countries that blindly follow a corrupt system including abusive nobles and slavery.</br></br>  <br>But King Riku is the most retarded person alive in One Piece.<br><br>He would be happy if his country gets destroyed again since he intends to be extremely pacifistic once again and even his citizens says its okay for Dressrosa to get conquered again since they love their extreme pacifism.<br><br>People like King Riku deserve the Darwin Award.<br><br>Luffy didn't save Dressrosa since Dressorsa did not learn their lesson at all and want to repeat their tragic mistake once again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Luffy still freed them from corruption though - the word 'save' wasn't used.</br></br>  <br>I just realized that we only have to wait till the anime to know if the crows really are  Moria </br>  <br>Not my fault you weren't born a noble.</br>  <br><br>Dressrosa was peaceful and prosperous for 800 years. That would have continued if it wasn't for doffy</br></br>  <br>But King Riku has the most twisted and corrupted idea of peace ever.<br><br>King Riku is even worse than being a hippy.</br></br></br>  <br> trusting the anime <br>kek</br></br>  <br>ignored? He was about to kill them all but then Sentomaru told him to go after the SHs, Law and Kid.</br>  <br><br> supporting corruption and slavery </br></br>  Threadly reminder  <br> Dressrosa was peaceful and prosperous for 800 years <br><br>No it wouldn't, idiot.<br><br>For 800 years, Gold Roger was not born yet.<br><br>After Gold Roger was born, Dressrosa would not have such luck anymore since the Age of Pirates was born.<br><br>Dressrosa would have eventually got Kaidou or Big Mom's attention even if Dofla never came to Dressrosa.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See you in ten years when Fuji's actions in Dressrosa initiates the downfall of the Shichibukai system, which in turn the downfall of a corrupt government system AND the exposure of it on a worldwide scale. Nigga just started rolling the snowball that'll eventually free the OP world from the CDs and WG. He'll shit on Akainu so fucking hard on a political level. And he's not even scared of Akainu's bitching. You know he could gravity slap Magmashit's bitch ass to the ground if he wanted to.</br>  <br>That's not Tashigi</br>  <br>superior ship is here now</br>  <br><br> not the best ship yet <br><br>Seriously though, what do you think the egg is?<br><br>Sea kings? Dragons?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitorfags are this delusional.<br><br>The only head being served on silver platter to Akainu is gonna be Fujitora's head and Kizaru is gonna be the one presenting it.</br></br></br>  <br>it's the one piece</br>  <br>  Someone with the will of D  <br> D are mighty beasts, not mere humans <br> they were incubating Ace </br></br>  </br>  <br><br>We all know that this is best ship</br></br>  <br> tells Akainu that Fujitora has no intention to do his job correctly <br><br>pretty sure Akainu understood that right away given Fujitora's answer<br>he didn't have translation problems like the rest of us</br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep dreaming, justicefag</br>  <br><br>Uranus.</br></br>  <br>That design is  out of this world. </br>  <br>how can the revs be surprised that MONKEY D.

Shanks is one of the strongest in the world, and buggy is one of the weakened (calm down with that God stuff). Even though they both stayed of the same, on the legendary pirate king's crew ship, they are total opposites in terms of strength. Is there a theory behind this?</br>  <br>Get batoto downloader, I tried the first link that came up on google and it works perfectly fine.<br><br>redsquirrel87.com/Batoto.php</br></br></br>  <br>why would anyone in a crew have the same strength?<br>that doesn't make any sense<br>also Shanks was already considered very strong when in Roger's crew (can't remember who talks about it)</br></br></br>  <br>ambition and willpower<br>buggy was shown to only care about treasure even while being with roger and shanks got that hat for a reason</br></br>  <br><br>The underage squad jumped me, no I feel completely worthless.<br>What will I become if these people don't like me discussing my gay ship on /a/<br>Oh how silly of me, it's not like it matters one bit.

Because everyone can discuss whatever they want here, as long as it's One Piece related.<br>So, what color are Dellinger panties ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What will I become if these people don't like me discussing my gay ship on /a/ <br>but how can you expect anyone to like you for doing that?<br>also  Dellinger doesn't wear any </br></br></br>  <br> but how can you expect anyone to like you for doing that? <br>Why am I supposed to care ? I don't want you guys to like me. I don't want to be a NEET pedo with no social life.</br></br>  <br><br>What the fuck are you doing here then.</br></br>  <br>I wrote a idea about that in a past thread. Basically I believe that Buggy - unlike Shanks - never reached the One Piece and is therefore like a regular pirate still focused on treasures instead of having fun like Shanks does. I also think that that's the real reason why buggy can't accept Shanks (and not just the "force feeding" of Buggy's DF). I think there is a good possibility, that Roger only took a few of his crew to raftel (including shanks, but not buggy) OR that roger's crew got split beforehand because of some significant reason and shanks just happened to be in roger's party unlike buggy and reached Raftel.<br><br><br>fuck off you tumblr-tier cancer</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not expecting the same strength, just not that huge difference.

SH? we just don't know?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Alright folks. Rebecca or Bellamy? Who would you rather have join? Personally I'd take the former.  <br>Bellamy is better than Rebecca in every possible aspect besides boobs.</br>  <br>Okay but the crew does really need some new boobs and doesnt really need much else.</br>  <br> "Please notice me, Doffy-senpai!" <br> "Save me, Soldier-san!" <br>Both are trash and they don't deserve to join the crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, Bellamy is at least semi-useful in clearing up fodder, if not major opponents. Rebecca isn't even good at that. That's the reason Nami was given such an AoE clean-up weapon, that's the best Oda make her do. He most likely won't do the same kind of character powerup again.<br>I'm also pretty sure this is why he didn't make Vivi join either. He just gave Nami that kind of powerup in the same arc, and gaining a new crewmember who's destined to be cuddled like that would have been repetetive.<br> &gt;inb4 Alabasta = Dressrosa </br></br></br>  so what to expect next chapter you ask? I'll tell you <br> todo and deku team up and still lose to stain ( but he respects them) <br>  endeavor aka no.2 aka world best dad aka world best husband. Swoops in and causes stain to retreat by the sight of a true hero(todo probably text him) <br>  iida becomes the Edgelord of the series(just look at his hair in every panel it's already turning edge) <br> iida starts to beomes resent and become jealous of deku. And slowly starts his fall to turn evil (one good guy per jump has to turn or be evil they have it written in the contracts) <br><br>And as for the poll it will look some around the lines of <br><br>1.todo,deku,kacchan <br>4.ochako,all might, easer head<br>7.red riot<br>8.froppy<br>9.momo<br>10.

But if all the degenerates flock to those two shows, it may improve the others.<br>Reminder that the circlejerk brigade of autistic yurifags are already calling YuYu AOTY, despite it not having aired yet. Most cancerous fanbase in years.</br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/tards <br/></br>  <br><br>moe =/= yurishit<br>One is harmless fun, the other an autistic circlejerk by tumblr tier ESL posters, calling it the best thing ever. Shitting up everything which isn't while posting deluded ships.<br><br><br> moefag <br>Moefags are fine. it's the yurifags who are cancer. They are basically ESL moefags who can only self insert as girls and shitpost in any series with males. Not to mention being purityfags and spamming yuri memes all the time, while posting deluded ships.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already better than shitty Summer</br>  <br> WORST. SEASON. EVER. <br>Just like the one before. And the one before that one. And the one before that one again. And so on and so on.</br></br>  <br>So this is the final season of Monogatari? 2 cours and Kizu and that's it? No OVA bullshit?</br>  <br> ESL <br>English as a Second Language?</br></br>  <br>Despite its name, Nisioisn keeps writing more LNs so its not the end.</br>  2 Devilman movies<br> mfw </br>  <br> Only monogatari look appealing. <br>Well, we deserve a little rest every now and then.</br></br>  <br>With no regrets</br>  <br>Go away education-fag</br>  <br>The chart is wrong, it's not a second season of Honoo no Kokuin, it's a separate Garo anime series that takes place in Heian-era Japan and has a female protagonist.<br>The image is just reused by the chart.</br></br>   GARO S2 <br> female protagonist <br> female GARO armor </br></br>  <br>did you miss all the moeshit generals that circlejerk all day long because they have nothing to talk about because nothing ever happens?</br>  Holy shit, we're getting so many fucking LN adaptations that a couple of them actually look interesting.   People giving Lance 'n' Masque a chance <br>Holy shit are you people mad?<br>Studio Gokumi is already a shit, but when it tries to have a male lead it becomes a triple shit</br></br>  <br>Monogatari, OPM and Noragami?<br><br>Enough for a pleasant ride</br></br></br>  <br> moe as genre. <br>Are you sure you know what moe means?</br></br>  the perfect insider looks good  <br> Noragami <br>That studio sucks at second seasons.</br></br>  <br> K Return of Kings <br> Noragami Aragoto <br> One Punch Man <br>And the best of all<br> Mother fucking Owarimonogatari </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is anime is getting worse as time goes on</br>  <br>Anime has always been bad. Anime is shit.</br>  <br> Watching Shounen </br>  <br>Was Mai-HiME supposed to make a surprise return or its one faggot who still believes it every year</br>  <br>Every season has forgettable anime, or flavors of the season being in the majority<br><br>This also happens in western media, look at movie releases and lists of new TV shows</br></br></br>  Even my normalfag friends are hyped for One Punch Man, how does this make you feel /a/?  <br>Weird, because my normalfag friends are also hyped for One Punch Man</br>  One Punch Man and Gundam for my junk food anime.<br><br>Yuru for my cute girl flavored junkfood.</br></br>  <br> Silver Link <br>Didn't they wanted to stop making anime and wanted to do more advertisement?</br></br>  No season will ever beat last winter on being the worst season ever.  <br>There's tons of crap as usual but some of it actually looks decent.</br>  <br>Last winter was much better than Winter 2013. Hell I remember enjoying it more than most of last year's seasons.</br>  <br>I agree with this guy. 2013 winter was awful.</br>  <br><br>Still butthurt about KLK?</br></br>  <br>The fuck do winter 2013 have to do with KLK? Aired aired 3 seasons later.</br>  <br>this whole year has been terrible anyway</br>  Honestly the season looked like shit a month ago but Monogatari alone redeemed it for me. <br><br>Then the additional announcements of Garo 2nd season &amp; the new Gundam, hell yeah. Hopefully some of the others will impress too.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I looked back and it was filled with pretty bad shows. At least it had chihayafuru s2 and ai mai mi.</br>  <br>Man 2014 was sweet <br>Robotgurlsz<br>chunni<br>Yadada dada daboo boo YAY<br>Konkon<br>screaming intensifying<br>WCW:NWO<br>Dando<br>noragami for what it was worth<br>tonari no fuckin seki kun<br>dfrag your ssd<br>Oneechan katickta<br><br>2013 <br>Kotoura-san was good for a laugh<br>Boku no Imōto wa "Ōsaka Okan was cool little short<br>Tamako Markets great and gubu filled time. <br>Tadaima wasn't too bad yeah?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> GochiUsa <br> YuruYuri <br> Noragami <br> OPM <br> Monogatari <br><br>Pretty good for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And the second half of AKB0048. And Mondaijitachi. There were a few other watchable shows, but that's about it.<br><br>It really didn't help that the fall 2012 carryovers ended being mostly disappointments. Sakurasou dropped off hard, Robotics;Notes was all build up for an underwhelming payoff. Psycho-Pass and Tempest had weaker second halves, but were still alright. SSY was great.<br><br>Last winter had much better carryovers, most of them either staying consistent or actually getting better (Yona, Garo, Shirobako, Shigatsu). Except for Cross Ange, that second half was awful.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks better than every other season this year</br>  <br>How about watching good anime regardless of genre?</br>  does anyone here know anything about the perfect insider? the character designs look cool  <br>Based on a 20 year old book.<br> 1995 was 20 years ago </br></br>  I can't help but to feel that Madhouse could do a much better job with the art. The ed is nice tho.  <br>One where she goes full crazy and overpowers Ainz to grab her favorite bone and insert it on her vagina.</br>  <br>I'd rather the maids.</br>  The stupid faces break muh immersion  <br> it doesn't fit because its skull </br>  <br>Ainz sticking a bone through his crotch to  bone  Albedo would make for a fucking hilarious doujin.</br>  Why did they have to ruin her character by giving her such a shitty VA?  <br>The VA is not shit.<br>It just doesn't fit.<br>Blame the one who casted her.</br></br></br>   I actually love that VA.   <br>This, bugs me too.</br>  <br>wow you have such shit taste</br>  <br>It fits per perfectly</br>  <br><br>OP is a cad</br></br>  Yeah, her voice is just fail  She is a midget turbodyke. Her VA suits her perfectly.  What I like about her is how aerodynamic she is<br><br>10/10 crotchface, would throw again</br></br>   MC is in love with a girl <br> Girl gets naked on top of him, confesses her love to him and wants to have sex with him <br> "EEEEHHH?!!!!?!?!?!! What are you doing?" <br>This fucking bullshit needs to stop. Does anyone honestly like this crap? I can't believe anyone reads that and thinks "Yup. Looks good to me."</br></br></br>  <br>Tanuki is pure and innocent.</br>   short <br> lesbo stalker obsessed with a beautiful onee-san <br>Her VA is perfect.</br></br>  <br><br>Time to sleep anon</br></br>  <br>And gay. Really, really gay. Why is that the standard for LN MCs?</br>  <br>Did you post the wrong pic or something OP</br>  <br>I would have raged had I not ran out of rage about a hundred animes with this shit ago</br>  <br>I don't think he really imagined it going down the way it did. Not all guys are into being raped like that, maybe he just really was  after her butt  after all.</br>  <br>He loves her for the pure, not the lewd.<br><br>Tender handholding and baby making, not rough crazy fucking.<br><br><br>In fairness it slowly grew on my. There are better fits, and it's not the best, but I don't really hate it after 2 episodes of it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In a lot of cases you would be right but you have clearly just missed the entire point of this show and it's characters.</br></br>  <br>You need to stop viewing the world through your "Any guy would have sex with any girl at the drop of a hat" lens. The MC likes her because he thinks she's sparkly pure moralfag. And then she did something completely the opposite of what he expected and was completely thrown off, to the point he was repulsed.</br>  <br>It is possible to be straight and innocent and male and a teenager, anon.</br>  <br>Otaku pandering, having a MC feel good about sex would drop the sales</br>  <br>Only interesting character in the Raildex universe</br>  <br> I can't believe anyone reads that and thinks "Yup. Looks good to me." <br><br>Something similar happened to your parents when you were born.</br></br></br>  <br>It's already selling like shit though.</br>  Her voice is what makes her sexy.  <br> rationalizing this shit <br><br>You may have been watching anime a little too long</br></br></br>  <br>Where's the meat cleaver?<br>Kuroko should just behead that slut, then find Sluthinus and flush her down the toilet.</br></br>  I guess it's true that you can use Arai Satomi as test to filter out plebs from patricians.  <br>I don't watch many LN adaptations so it got me.<br><br><br> He loves her for the pure, not the lewd. <br>And yet he stills starts falling for the sex terrorist before he knows she has a pure heart.<br><br><br>It's a parody about censorship. Let's not pretend any of the characters have any real depth or nuance.<br><br><br> You need to stop viewing the world through your <br>And you need to get a firm grasp on what teenagers and hormones are.<br><br><br>I guess that's a good point.<br><br><br>He doesn't need to be a womanizing whore, but when the one girl he's in love with pounces him "Ew get off" shouldn't be the reaction.<br><br><br>I know you're trying really hard to defend shit writing and pandering to literal faggots, but that wasn't the least bit clever.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> animes <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br><br> he was repulsed. <br>He was thrown off and wasn't given any time to respond before he was held down. He didn't really try to fight back, regardless of how it ineffective it would be. <br><br>After a week of being ignored I think he just wanted to know what the hell was going on.</br></br></br></br></br>  Don't talk shit about the voice of my waifu 's grandmother.   <br>Yeah bitch I said animes. What now?</br>  <br><br>yeah what's up with that scratched voice? seriously sometimes I just can't help to cough when I hear her</br></br>  <br> shitty VA <br>kill yourself</br></br>  <br>Apparently a raspy old grandma who's been smoking her entire life fits this character.</br>  <br>I agree with you on many points, but as I already said having a faggot guy as the main character is some sort of unwritten law for those type of anime.<br><br>To be honest though if he just enjoyed himself then the anime would be over by the end of episode. I mean let's say he enjoys it, he has sex with her, they start going out, then what? There wouldn't be any room for new situations.</br></br></br>  <br><br>its japanese cartoons you dip</br></br>  <br>chinese, dude, get your facts straight</br>  <br><br>please fuck off back to reddit</br></br>  <br> but as I already said having a faggot guy as the main character is some sort of unwritten law for those type of anime. <br>But it doesn't need to be. None of the jokes surrounding that plot point are funny, and the non-developments are just annoying.<br><br> To be honest though if he just enjoyed himself then the anime would be over by the end of episode. I mean let's say he enjoys it, he has sex with her, they start going out, then what? There wouldn't be any room for new situations. <br>I can't believe you're actually conditioned to believe "if romantic progress happens, then a series is over." What about the entire plot revolving around censorship and the government? Anna's mom? Educating the masses?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are dumb and incorrect.</br>  <br>Anti-lolicon tactics?<br>Isn't she the only loli?<br><br>Give loli grandma voice.<br>Can't fap to doujin when you hear that voice in your head when reading her lines.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know what she sounds like and I don't feel like downloading an entire episode just to find out.</br>  <br>Just try and stop me</br>  ITT: everyone is a manly badass who wouldn't get flustered at all if a 10/10 inexplicably loved them, just like every thread about japanese MCs.<br><br>Also, for the millionth time, its been explicitly set up that he's trying his hardest to be pure, and loves Anna for her purity. If you want to see anime character fuck, go watch hentai and fuck off.</br></br>  <br>She's just not suited for high pitched voices,<br>look at Hata from SYD, her voice can be quite enjoyable if casted for a role that suits her.</br></br>  <br> I'll just pretend to sound witty by calling out people and assuming that they wouldn't do something any hot blooded boy or man would do <br> I'm a fucking faggot who eats up the retarded excuses for non-development that LNs throw at me! <br>You are literally the worst kind of poster on this board.</br></br></br>  <br>No, I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be able to even air it</br>  <br>Seems like a good voice for dyke. What, did you want a traditional girly voice for a dyke? Th ha y would have been stupid.</br>  <br>She can totally do high-pitched: https://<span>youtu.be/oNKw-maLI1Q?t=7s  [ ]<br><br>Presumably, the director asked for her Kuroko/Hata voice and the mismatch is intentional.</br></br></br>  <br>your fault for watching shit anime.</br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure it's about not giving a shit about their loli as well.<br>No fanservice, not even panties showing through the pantyshose, nothing in a show where there is an almost full fledged sex scene with older girl.<br>They thought "oh that's a shitty loli, at least try to make something funny with her voice".</br></br></br></br>    <br> Th ha y would have been stupid. <br>Care to elaborate on that, retard? Or are you too illiterate?<br><br>Explain how her voice makes her sound like a dyke.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>These are all very valid explanations.<br><br><br><br>You need to stop posting. Go take a nap.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Would you a PERORIST?<br><br>  I want to murder whoever came up with that shitty pun. </br></br>  <br>If it was Anna-sama.</br>    <br><br> I'll pretend like I have a point by sounding angry and serious <br><br>I'm honestly not much of an LN person, but in this case, again, it has been explicity set up that the MC is actively trying to avoid lewd things. I'm sure that if he were a catholic preist or the like you would have no problem, but of course, since he's from an LN, the reasons given have to be retarded, right?<br><br>YOU are the worst sort of poster on this board, because you give absolutely no consideration for charactization whatsoever and just superimpose your own values over everything. Try actually thinking about things before shitting on them, and fuck off back to whatever shithole spawned you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Shit Taste: The thread  <br>I bet you fap also fap to MikotoXKuroko<br><br>AKA turbobitch and 100yo dike.</br></br></br>  <br>You need to stop eating shit.<br><br><br> it has been explicity set up that the MC is actively trying to avoid lewd things <br> The LN explicitly stated a paper thin explanation so the bullshit is ok! <br>Then why the fuck did he start developing feelings for the super pervert girl last week, and why won't he stop liking Anna next week now that he knows she isn't pure? Please, enlighten me with your brilliant explanation that isn't "Well the pants on head retard explanation is only so they don't have to actually develop things, they don't actually have to follow it in the context of the characters actions that don't jeopardize the status quo."<br><br> YOU are the worst sort of poster on this board, because you give absolutely no consideration for charactization whatsoever and just superimpose your own values over everything. Try actually thinking about things before shitting on them, and fuck off back to whatever shithole spawned you. <br>How about you get some fucking reading comprehension and critical thinking skills so that when actions and developments don't make sense, a simple "Well oh they said this so it's ok even if they don't follow it." isn't enough to suspend your disbelief, you idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  o***po  <br>It was practically rape</br>  <br>He didn't come, so it was rape.</br>  <br>She's cute, and has nice looking legs and thighs, I may have to pick this series up.</br>  <br>She has but one flaw: she speaks</br>  <br> Lesbian character <br> Not already ruined </br></br>  <br><br>Firstly, you're fucking stupid if you think that things aren't developing.<br><br>Secondly, I said that he is TRYING to avoid lewd things. He can't stop himself from liking girls, but he can (and would) get freaked out if one of them suddenly decided to mount him. Which is exactly what happened. His avoidance, again, is as much of a "paper thin excuse" as a priest's would be, which is to say, you just think he's a faggot because he's not you.<br><br> How about you get some fucking reading comprehension and critical thinking skills <br><br>Jesus fucking christ, listen to yourself. You're the one who's baselessly assuming that things make no sense before actually examining them. For the sake of your massive reading comprehension skills, I'll say it a third time: it's not a case of "Well oh they said this so it's ok even if they don't follow it", its a case of "well they gave a rationale for his behavior but he is developing and won't stick to it forever".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are too upset, you do know you're talking about anime right?</br>  <br>Oh wow</br>  <br>Now this is aspergers</br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm not nearly as mad as the other guy was, assuming that none of you are him.

I would. </br>  <br>To be fair, he thought it was going to be a stalker he had no relationship with, then he could see before she covered his eyes with her pantsu, then she realized who it was and got confused as to why she was doing something completely out of character.<br><br>He was more shocked then anything else.</br></br></br>  <br>Token loli, no fanservice, side lined, not relevant.<br>Don't pick the series if you aren't into big tits.</br></br>  <br>*Couldn't see</br>    <br>That wasn't the funny part you cad.

It's like if you were a devout Catholic and wanted to date that shy honors student who didn't have a thing for you at all, and then she randomly tried to give you a handjob under your desk in the middle of class or something while salivating.</br>  <br>This. I've loved her in everything she's been in up until now, but she just doesn't work in this role.</br>  <br> He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life <br>no, his dad taught him otherwise. He's been pushing himself to believe that.</br></br>  <br>The government's been telling him it's evil, and he's believed them. Treat him like a Catholic from an atheistic family, if you prefer.</br>  Better question. What's the point of this thing?<br>She's not funny, her voice is shit, she's not attractive and looks more like a meth whore than supposedly a quiet person.</br>  <br> She's not funny, her voice is shit, she's not attractive <br>Are we talking about the same girl?</br></br>  <br>Character's design is shitty.</br>  <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/dpmlhiyjki.web<wbr>m</wbr></br>  <br>Seen this on /f/ a lot, but I will still love whoever did this forever.</br>  <br>I want to give her a private lesson on reproduction</br>  <br>Would she still act all quiet and monotone in the bedroom or would she let it all out?</br>  <br>She'd be quiet first, trying to just understand it scientifically, then she'd lose to the pleasure from the dick and become a moaning whore addicted to cock.</br>  <br><br>Why are you still hanging around these threads if you hate the show, then? Fuck off from them.</br></br>  <br>I think it's more like her voice is featured too much in the ep and kind of plays out the novelty of it. Arai is fun as a side character since a hilariously weird voice gives such characters some well, character, that prevented them from being forgettable. Also she was most memorable going fucking nuts as Kuroko while she doesn't really hit the same extremes in this show since it's not the same character.</br>  <br>There's no easy way to say this... you have shit taste. With time and treatment, it may improve, but the more likely scenario is that you'll have shit taste for the rest of your life. I am so sorry.</br>  <br>Its obvious they did it on purpose<br>Maybe to prevent her from becoming a sexualized meme<br><br> implying you will still jack off to your obaa-san loli </br></br></br></br>  <br> prevent <br> that implication <br>If that's the case, then they did a horrible job.<br>By the way, please stop calling everything a meme or using a name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They really want people to stop sexualizing loli, and they are being successful at it.</br>  <br>Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays.<br>And I don't think that it makes sense to like Saotome for her loli traits, because after all the only thing she has is her size. I'll even go a bit further and say she isn't a loli at all. Tiny as fuck and amazing, but not a loli.</br></br>  <br>Or rather, scratch that, she's on her way to become a legal loli. How old is she anyway? Is there even a term for someone who isn't quite an adult but still looks like a loli? Legal loli or lolihag doesn't quite work in here.</br>  <br> Man, Japan can't do anything right nowadays. <br>That's true, and your pic is related, since it shows nothing, as expected from anything "loli service". It is nothing.</br></br>  <br>This. Anna didn't know what a dick even was let alone have enough time to figure out how to stick it inside her. Though that doesn't change the fact that she is now a stalker, despite freaking the fuck out about being stalked herself just the previous episode</br>  <br>She's supposed to be a disgusting looking little runt midget so her voice is perfect.</br>  <br><br>I like you guys.<br>I know /a/ has lots of alpha males who wouldn't flustered AT ALL when a beautiful and "pure" girl suddenly aggressively wants their dicks.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd probably be horrified and pass out from the mental trauma it caused.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128749959 <br>In all honesty I wish this meme would die</br>  <br>Well, you and I are a pussy by /a/ 'standard', then.</br>  <br>never change, /a/</br>  <br>Lol fag</br>  <br><br>Nigga you got to remember, if they even try to do that shit, the bracelets they're wearing are going to trigger and they're both going to be locked in prison for the rest of their lives or some shit.</br></br>  nani sore  <br>Wrong hag dude</br>  <br>Except this is probably the only time this has ever been done where it makes sense. Congratulations on being retarded.</br>  <br>OP confirmed for shit taste</br>  Don't worry people, this will hit the gutter soon enough.  <br> dat shit taste on /a/ <br>Can't wait for summer to end.</br></br>  <br>He's not in love with Anna, he's in love with pure, kind-hearted, pre-conceived image he had of her.<br>All that situation did was made him question if she's really the same person he thought he was in love with.</br></br>  Voice fits fine for me, reminds me of that one tiny fashion nigga from The Incredibles.  <br> They gave an excuse! <br> It doesn't matter if it only applies when it's convenient to keep things static <br> YOU'RE THE IDIOT! NOT ME! <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  THE ONE QUESTION I NEED TO KNOW:<br><br> People that read the LN, does anyone actually fuck or is this the same old haremshit that goes nowhere ? </br></br>  Is the show worth picking up? Is the MC a cliché harem protagonist?  <br> He's literally been told sex is evil his entire life <br>No you idiot, he's the MC because he had the upbringing where he knows that's no the case.</br></br>  <br> I-I''ll just imply they're completely asocial losers who wouldn't react in a situation literally any teenage boy would react in! </br>  <br>How the fuck do those things even work? You can't draw lewd pictures, but you can strip naked, put your panties over someones head then lick them from head to toe?</br>   shitty VA <br><br>I think her voice is great <br><br>I tend too like VA eith uniwue voice like hers.<br><br>Kike Judo for example</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except this is probably the only time this has ever been done where it makes sense. <br> LN gives a surface level excuse <br> It only applies in specific instances where the plot could accidentally move forward and isn't actually reflective of the characters at all <br>Sorry, I was just caught off guard because I honestly never thought people were stupid enough to accept characterization done that poorly.<br><br><br>It's not haremshit, just love triangleshit that goes nowhere.<br><br><br> Is the MC a cliché harem protagonist? <br> Super valiant white knight who saves girls and is selfless so people can self insert and pat themselves on the back <br> Rejects sexual advances <br>What do you think?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to remember that Okuma's dad was arrested and he was socially ostracized because of his Dad's lewdness and dirty jokes, so he does have a reason to be opposed to sex.</br>  <br>He knows on a fundamental level that it isn't inherently evil.</br>  <br>they're just bracelet shaped plot devices / plot holes. they work however they need to. I find them pretty stupid.</br>  <br>This is what MALtard influx will do to a board. Reminds me of the whining about Shinji.</br>  <br> I find them pretty stupid. <br>A contrived plot device that only conveniently works when the author needs it to? Yeah, that's fucking retarded. At least it fits right in with the convenient characterization that only becomes an issue when the author needs it to.</br></br>  <br>Artists are under stricter surveillance, because they are capable of drawing lewd shit. Normally they can't check logs of PM unless you are either committing a crime(using dirty words) or missing. At least until new law passes.</br>  <br>LN fag here, he does change to his dad's ways. Just let him develop.</br>  <br> This is what MALtard influx will do to a board. <br> People who have a problem with LNshit writing and MCs are MALtards <br>Why are you LNfags the worst fanbase on this board, and you do you always pretend to have some sense of seniority or sense of belonging here?</br></br></br>   162 posts  <br><br>the fuck</br></br>  <br> the fuck <br>Actually there was a lack of fucking.</br></br>  <br>Go back to reddit and bring your friends with you if you can't see how stupid this thread is.</br>  <br> LNfags <br> Redirecting people to Reddit <br>You are all the worst plague that's ever happened to this board.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The character literally talks like a grandma from 18th century, so the voice fits perfectly.</br></br></br>  <br> The character literally talks like a grandma from 18th century <br> Implying any of these retards know enough moon to understand shit like そのようじゃ。まぁ、わしよくも知らぬが isn't how a normal high school girl talks <br>ESLfags that read LNs don't actually know any Japanese.

EOPs aren't the problem, ESLs are.</br></br>  <br><br>Pro tip: The majority of people who watch anime are beta faggots and cucks. <br><br>Seriously. No real man would watch this garbage. Real men stick to manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't even care about this series but reading your autismal rant has been quite entertaining. <br><br>I've got a bucket of lego somewhere around here if you feel the need to arrange a few thousand bricks by height, weight and colour. Sounds like you might need a distraction from all of these social interactions. <br><br>Stay safe, anon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump all anime in with LN haremshit adaptations.</br>  <br>10/10<br><br>This is the best thing I've read in a while. I'll be using this.</br></br></br>  <br>This exact situation happened to me when I was 15. Yes, I panicked and pushed her off. I thought she was teasing me. I had never seen anime or manga or anything like that, so it's not that I was somehow influenced. I had been bullied a lot as a kid and fucked with many times. I grew out of it in a year or two after interacting with females more and realizing that some of them might actually find me likeable or attractive, but keep in mind, these shows are about teenage boys in a very outwardly repressed culture -- even those from other shows, not just shimoneta. It's possible that you just lack empathy.</br>  <br> I was gay from a young age so you lack empathy </br>  <br>But it sure seemed like that in  Maybe you should have worded it better to avoid being mistaken for ESL yourself.<br>Furthermore, I'm pretty sure being EOP is a problem, because they wouldn't be able to understand those nuances, leading to the stupid threads like this one.</br></br>  <br> ESLfag tried to claim native speaker wrote English poorly <br>Try learning how articles work before commenting on other people's language skills. If you couldn't understand my point it's because you lack reading comprehension and didn't want to believe someone who actually understands the source material was insulting you.</br></br>  Porn of Fuwa where?  <br>She sounded better in the manga</br>  <br>I appreciate you trying to actually discuss the series anon.</br>  <br> writing off inconsistent characterization as "development" <br> discussing the series <br>No.</br></br></br>  <br> implying the prude fibers in the PMs are not activated by the lewd energies and report the activity while simply undressing yourself doesn't get a reaction </br>  HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ</br></br></br>  <br>Is this like the 6th thread tonight already?</br>  Needs more LN translations  <br> AINZ <br> NAZI <br>Fuck off, i bet that bony guy has a nazi minions.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking wish /a/ was back to 15 threads a minute speed.</br>    I finally figured out what I don't like about Albedos armor. It makes her look like a heartless.  Someone post the gif in which he is laughing.  <br>That looks like a space marine for some reason to me. Must be the beer.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  tfw you will never pledge your loyalty to papa bones  I originally hated that the first 2 episodes were just explanations of everything, but now that we're 2 more in I'm actually glad I got a lot of the background info out of the way. Now I can just enjoy the show as they continue with a little new info each episode.<br><br>Also<br> Heil Ainz </br></br></br>  <br>But that's just a chair. Real best girl here.</br>  <br> Retards <br> Best anything </br></br>  <br>The literallywhofags have arrived</br>  <br>Even though I read the LN I only just realized why people keep calling her Chair.</br>  Originally wasn't even going to give this show a try due to the CGI in the trailer. Glad I did though because I am loving this fucking show.  Looking forward to Albedo getting Boned in doujins   <br> that <br> best </br></br>  <br>Not sure if this had already been made but I had a mighty need to make a stitch from the ending for a possible vertical dual monitor setup</br>  It's pretty ironic how most of the complaints about this episode is how Ainz being so OP means there's no tension in the series but I've yet to come across anyone calling him a Gary Stu. Apparently people DO know the difference between being OP and being a Gary Stu. Who knew?  If you think the best character is anyone other than PA or Albedo, you're solely mistaken. All others would probably turn on Ainz the minute their creators show up.<br>Automatic disqualification from the Best Character contest.</br>  <br>like 90% of the complaints about this series are people throwing cheap bait against the wall to see what sticks. the other 10% generally being op haters or lnfags (myself included) that feel a lot of the skipped dialogue is losing out on world and character building.</br>  <br>What if my favourite character is   Brain  </br>  <br>Good choice. He's going to outGazef Gazef himself pretty soon.</br>  <br>Only thing I dislike is the CGI angles looking like robots and the lack of intense sound. I expected the black hole to make noise, though I can accept that.<br>The manga reaction faces got my hopes up in certain regards</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The series is surprisingly easy to depend, especially considering the OPness of Ainz. I guess making the title OVERLORD guaranteed you'd know what the hell you were getting yourself into.</br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>The intimidation of the quiet black hole was pretty great though.</br></br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>clearly you don't understand how black holes work.</br></br>  I'm glad the next two episodes will give us a break from action on the scale of this and episode 3. The next time something on that scale happens will be the end of volume 2 and 3 right? So, say, episodes 7 and 13?  <br>I think things like this are so rare that I'm just savoring getting to see an intelligent evil lich in action. If the whole show was about him just floating around murdering weak assholes it would be a problem but they're obviously not going for that.</br>    <br>Looks nice, especially with him sitting in the abyss just waiting like he's the last boss of Nazarick.</br>  <br>The way I see it is 5 is adventurer meet up, 6 Battle with the forest king, 7 set up for zombie apocalypse, and 8 Devil May Cry: skeleton edition.</br>  <br>HEIL AINZ<br><br> I expected the black hole to make noise </br></br></br>  <br>Be happy that we are getting full chapters instead of individual parts like usal</br>  <br>I lost my shit</br>  <br>That was quick.</br>  <br>Shut it chair</br>  <br>She's gonna be a main character in the next few episode anon</br>  <br>Need a complete webm of him summoning the angel of bait holding a fish hook scepter. Then Ainz deleting it with a sage.</br>  <br> Talkin shit about Ainz's chair. <br>You'd best take that back about Nazarick's top Overlord approved seat.</br></br>  <br>but the best way to defeat bait is by ignoring it, not saging.</br>  <br> tfw my webm is getting popular in this thread <br><br>I wish Papa Bone would be proud of me</br></br></br>  <br>Good job, anon. Just wanted to spread your ingenuity.</br>  <br>Main character who fucks shit up because she can't follow simple instructions <br><br> implying saying Shalltear is best girl is bait </br></br></br>  <br><br>at least its better than defeating bait with "OP is a fag"</br></br>  So let me get this straight, other players landed in the past, and they were the ones that taught high level magic, well, "high", to people like the Theocracy? Does this imply the magic is inherently the same mechanic, just fully customizable here? Will Ainz start making his own spells?  <br> OP <br>that's like saying "omg he killed that rat! so OP!"</br></br>  <br>How much dialogue has been skipped? I've been following these threads on and off and kept reading that it has been adapted pretty well so far.</br>  <br>It has, but you have purists who feel like skipping anything at all is an unforgivable insult. Then they get all huffy and think you're shitting on the source material by saying it's fine to skip stuff, because they take it so personally. <br><br>They're already going really slow by taking 4 eps per volume, any slower and they'd barely get through volume 2 by the end of the cour.</br></br></br>  <br>Tons, the author is really generous with inner dialog.</br>  <br>Maybe magic is like engineering; all the parts have always been there, you just need to know how to put it all together.</br>  <br>Well, it's certainly possible that no magic existed before Yggdrasil players showed up and taught them long ago. What do you mean customizable though? As far as I can tell these guys are apparently casting the exact same spells Ainz is familiar with. And while they might be "inventing" spells it may just be them learning to duplicate untaught Yggdrasil spells that the original teachers didn't know.</br>  <br>There's magic Ainz doesn't know of. The contingency magic that murdered the one dude they were torturing.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, maybe I'll actually read the LN then, I think I have the mega link saved somewhere.</br></br>  People are saying that Demiurge misunderstood Momonga when he was talking about the treasures. What exactly did he misunderstand  <br>Even though that this is a faithful adaptation, I find it hard to not be disappointed when some core dialogue is left out.<br><br>For example, even an extra three minutes would have laid the background for what happens in Volumes 2 and 3. All Madhouse had to do was, say, have only one song play during episode 1, and remove the ED during episode 4.</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz said the world conquest would be enjoyable as a joke but Demiurge took it literally</br>  <br>True, but don't forget that while Ainz has an absurdly high capacity at 700 spells known, Yggdrasil has 6000+ spells in all so he might not be familiar with them all. Hard to say one way or another though the contingency magic and magic chanters inventing spells seems to prove what you say.</br>  <br><br>Should I just start Vol 1 or was it covered pretty well?</br></br>  <br>Start Vol 1.</br>  <br>Is that why he was also shocked when Ainz said it while they were flying?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Xu<wbr>kocjXhSs</wbr>  [ ]<br> "Don't you gimme your love and passion" <br> not "Won't*" <br>I can't help but be triggered by engrish in songs that have potential.</br></br></br></br>  So, is Stronoph, or whatever his name is, a reincarnated player?  <br>Yes</br>  Why do you guys like this show so much?<br><br>Seems kind of plain to me.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This was some bad translation. How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'?<br><br>Would have been better translated as 'Long live Lord Ainz'. Jesus these subs are bad and my Japanese skills consists of a few years of school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN</br></br></br>  <br><br>What if she actually does not want you to give her your love and passion?</br></br>  <br>I'll bite. No I think its literally don't, she doesn't want it. (She has ainz you insect)</br>  <br> that pic <br><br>I kek'd.</br></br></br>  <br> fucks shit up <br>Coming from a chairfag I don't think that means too much anon</br></br>  <br><br> inflexible <br><br>shit maid, can't even bend her over your desk<br>0/10 can not bang</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Now that I read that a third time, that actually makes sense. I still prefer "won't" through.</br></br>  <br>Standing up sex is best sex.</br>  <br>Albedo.<br>Shalltear.<br>Cocytus.<br>Papa Bones. <br>That's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz has a throne not a desk.</br>  <br>Personally, it's the character interactions. The Guardians are so loyal to Ainz that it's just terrific. Equally entertaining are the Guardian's relationship with each other. Episode 2 of the anime as well as Volume 3, the drama CD, and the last half of Volume 4 all display (to me) fantastic interactions. Fight scenes are pretty chill too.</br>  <br>Science is the study of our universes magic<br>Pretty cool when you think about it that way</br></br>  <br>I totally support Ainz taking Naberal as his wife after Albedo forces him to marry put a real ring on that finger. I mean heck, people already think they're doing the buisness behind the scenes.</br>  <br> Interesting Characters <br> Theme (MC is the OP evil overlord but evil neutral) <br> Skellington protagonist <br>   He chooses to use minimum force in order to carefully explore the world until the situation calls for it <br>Other than that, its Log Horizon except less about being a tactician mayor and more about being a conqueror.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> its Log Horizon <br>Wow it's like I'm really on Reddit......</br></br>  <br>I wasn't aware Overlord was about a socially retarded outcast, glitching raidbosses</br>  <br>Are you new?</br>  <br>It's pretty much the same wish fulfillment bullshit as Danmachi. Nice Skeleton aesthetic, though.</br>  <br>Ainz has already daughter-zomed the entirety of Nazarick. Only CD, and Chair Jr. have any hope now.</br>  <br> Danmachi <br>Oh okay, you're just spouting random shows that fall into a similar category.</br></br>   Heil <br>Does he have a nazi minion? If no then nope I ain't calling mr Bones that.</br>    <br>He created a a level 100 Nazi uniform doppelganger, does that count?</br>  <br>You know he does anon</br>  Will this show get an s2?  <br>Hopefully not, because its gonna be almost all lizardmen and then uncle insect rekting them.</br>  <br>If it sells well enough</br>  <br>He has a desk too.<br>Bitches love desks.</br></br>  <br>Considering he cares enough for the game and not being a normalfag like his other guild members are, not really far from the truth.</br>  <br>Well, it is in the OP</br>  <br>But anon chairs aren't supposed to be bent over desks</br>  <br>And he will do the Gendo pose on the desk in volume 9</br>  <br>He has a job, why would he make a rule for his guildies to follow, that he wouldn't? They all just left the game after being burned out from getting everything required to make the guild staff. Just because he kept logging into the game, doesn't mean he's socially inept.</br>  <br>Of course not, silly.<br>Chairs go under desks.</br></br>  <br>I would still like to see that.</br>  <br>It's fine, you can admit the real reason you want vol 4 animated.</br>  <br>It's Funi, right? What can you expect from a bunch of retards wearing traffic cones on their heads?</br>  <br>Why hasn't he bothered thinking about going back to his world if he had friends and family to go back to? He seems to care about the game than his real life which started the whole story to begin with, being fussy that people in his guild left him only realizing that they didn't leave without giving a damn about the times they shared. A normal faggot wouldn't have sperged and slam the table dramatically and would've just logged off. Arguably, he could still be socially inept when he has godlike abilities that earns the respect and fear of everyone around him.</br>  <br> Ains <br> Ainz <br> Nazi </br></br></br>  <br>MIND BLOWN. AINZ IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SET UP THE 4TH REICH.</br>  <br>Because he isn't in the game, he's in a different world.<br>And that world happens to be far better than the 22nd-century hellscape he came from.</br></br>  <br>His job is a soulless office worker job in a future world that seems pretty shit, he gets along fine in life but he cherished his guild and could never let go of that.<br><br>He's interested in going home, but there is absolutely no hint at all how to do that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't he specifically say that he has nobody to go back to?</br></br>  <br>Yes, in the intro in fact.</br>  <br>This was explained in, like, the second episode, maybe first. He said that he doesn't have family or friends outside of the game. All he does is wake up, work all day, then go home and plays the game until he sleeps.<br><br>He said that was a really shitty life.</br></br></br>  <br>He's never expressed interest in going home. He says in the first volume that he has no friends or family to go back to in the real world.</br>  <br>Yep, his family's dead and his only freinds were his guildmates</br>  <br>Then get his ass kicked by Zaryushu or Hamsuke.</br>  <br>He's a magic caster, he has to sage.</br>  I want to do illegal things to Narberal!  <br>It could be worse.<br>He could go down to an autoattack from Victim.</br></br>  <br>I need to commission somebody to fufill all the fetishes.</br>  <br>Yeah actually. He made a shapeshifting nazi accountant back when he was chuuni</br>  <br>Did you not read book 2?</br>  <br>Can Victim even auto attack?</br>  <br>His physical attack is two points higher than his magic attack, for what it's worth.</br>  <br>...It is literally its entire method of attack</br>  <br>You sure anon?</br>  <br>Pee on me! Or worse.</br>  <br>Definately.</br>  <br>Sure.</br>  So Novel readers does Ainz ever stop being OP( as in getting his ass whooped ever)?<br><br>kinda hope he is OP all the way through. seems pretty cool with all these different items and abilities</br></br>  <br>Well, he does put on an act of getting his ass kicked and has a rather close fight.</br>  <br><br><br>this artist is great.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's just that damn good, mang. Many of us, not only myself, started the anime, then moved onto the manga, then moved onto the LN to keep consuming the content of Overlord.<br><br>The last time I went so far for a series, was Haurhi's Disappearance movie back in '09 I believe, around there.<br><br>So yeah, fuck you kid, it's great.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>What a beast.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm in the same situation. After the second episode I started reading the LN. Don't know why but this series has seriously captivated me.</br>  <br> jews <br> anyone that doesn't please me for free is a jew <br>lel</br></br></br>  <br>They also translated "majin" as just "Demon".</br>  <br>Sometimes people do stuff that brings little to no profit for fun for themselves or others, shocking, right?<br>I know being jewish is hard, but try to pretend you're a human too.</br></br>  <br>Well they used Akuma as Devil, so what would be Demon?</br>  People that read the LN's, does he ever find another person from Yggdrasil, or even one of his guild mates?  <br>Unfortunately, it happens so rarely that it's hard to think of it as the rule, instead of the exception. The only show I can think of where people continually produced a show despite shitty sales is The World God Only Knows. Thank god for the fanartist who's doing all of these Naberal + Nazerick member though.</br>  <br>Nigga what? Are you talking about Madhouse or Funimation here?</br>  <br> Kind of </br>  Any request for webm, transparent, or stitches?  <br>I'd suffer through Lizardmen stuff to see Cocytus and the undead army, plus volumes 5 and 6.</br>  <br>But are you willing to sit through multiple episodes of almost nothing by Climb?</br>  <br>I almost want to say that the biggest segments of continuous Climb shouldn't take more than the first 12 min of the episode.</br>  Why skeletons are so great?   MAH WONDERFUL BEAUTIFUL DIVINE MASTER OF EVERYTHING ALL HAIL LORD SKULL ALL HAIL HIS REIGN <br> repeat 100 times <br><br>This shit is awful<br>Every single episode has basically been non stop sasuga oniisama.<br>Even Mahouka wasn't this terrible with cock sucking and circlejerking</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a archangel, he has some spells that come with the racial category, as well as job spells. <br><br>His most prominent ability is his  raid wiper nuke , but he should be able to fight by himself. He's probably stronger than most of the New World inhabitants by level alone.</br></br></br>  <br>Because there is  one inside of you </br>  <br>I'm still upset that there's no Cocytus Naberal.</br>  <br>Deliberately being overpowered isn't Gary Stu. Gary Stu is when you're supposed to be "normal" but you're blessed with plot armor.<br><br>For example, Kirito is supposed to be just another player but he somehow gets a unique Dual Wield skill in a video game and he gets to cheat death through willpower. That's Gary Stu.<br><br>Being at level cap and annihilating level 1 mobs is not Gary Stu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have a pretty good idea.</br>  Why do you keep calling vampire loli a chair?  Remember to thank your saviour  Is the LN translated?  <br>its an epic meme from the ln</br>  <br>Ainz uses her as a chair eventually as punishment</br>  <br>Is it really a punishment ? Wouldn't she love it?</br>  <br>You misunderstand, it's for when he wants to punish himself.</br>  <br>http://lmgtfy.com/?q=overlord+light<wbr>+novel<br>Be thankful! I-It's not like I want to help you or anything!</br></wbr></br>  <br> it's for when he wants to punish himself <br><br>How's riding a vampire loli a punishment ?</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine finding yourself in that situation only to realize that you no longer have a dick. Not that your lich-feelings would let you enjoy it, anyway.</br>  <br>truly horrific.</br>  <br>He could almost certainly conjure up a penis.<br><br>The problem would be motivation to do so.</br></br></br>  <br>Having to sit on worst girl is pretty punishing if you ask me.</br>  I just want to see Albedo get boned.  BANZAI  A peasant girl turned bloody warlord takes over your town, kicks down your door, and tells you she's chosen you to warm her bed for the night.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  Succubi shouldn't be this moe.  <br>Of course they should</br>  <br>Warm her bed</br>  <br> you can't spell banzai without nazi </br>  <br>ALL HAIL AINZ</br>  It bet that it will only take another three volumes to Ainz rule the world (or at least conquest the neighboring countries in one way or another).  <br> abestacuteandachair.jpg <br><br>Keks were had.</br></br></br>  <br>Because she lacks proper stirrups or handlebars.</br>  <br>So moe</br>  <br>Isn't she the character that appears more in the series along with Ains?</br>  <br>I'd take one brown elf girl to go please.</br>  <br>OORU HAIRU BRITAINZIA</br>  <br>That's an imp brah-thah</br>  <br>Tomayto tomahto</br>  <br>midgets and vampires aren't the same tho</br>  Wait, is there going to be chibi episodes being released as well?  <br> facehugger maid <br> bimbo maid <br> /k/ommando maid <br> katana maid <br> furry maid <br>What's the last one?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Lupus is Mikako Komatsu  This guy has some impeccable teeth for living in a medieval world. His teeth are on par with Guts.  <br>read the epilogue for volume 1, she's a Succubus, Imp is just her starting race(just like Ainz was Skeleton mage)</br>  <br>Maid specialized in giving head.</br>  <br> Bimbo maid <br>Calling an outer god a bimbo is hardly conducive to long life (she's a shoggoth/Ubbo-Sathla)</br></br>  <br><br>She's both, I think. And possibly something else.</br></br>  <br> furry maid <br>Don't be stupid.</br></br>  <br>she's got 30 racial levels, 10 of which are Imp.<br>the max level a race or class can be is 15, 10, or 5.<br>thus she's got at least 3 races, and at most 5.</br></br></br>    <br><br>So imp, succubus and....what?</br></br>  <br> Lewd Beast </br>  <br>I'd guess fallen angel, and Succubi don't traditionally have feathery wings<br><br>your numbers are only accurate if each race is maxed out, if her creator went full retard she could have 21 different races</br></br></br>  <br> Semen Demon </br>  <br> How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'? <br><br>It's actually surprisingly reasonably close going by original meaning.<br>The thing is, "Banzai" obviously completely lacks the Nazi-association.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anything about Ainz and Albedo please.<br>Or any stitchable scenes is fine too for collection purpose.</br></br>  I wonder if i show up guy from another vrmmorpg, like a not warhammer?  ainz-albedo dynamics remind me of these two  You wouldn't fug a npc right?  I love this anime, and I'm hyped for the next episodes, but there's something in the back of my head that tells me that this will become bad, like SAO did (first episodes good -&gt; rest bad)<br>Can any manga reader tell me if this will stay good?</br>  <br>This show is so fucking good. This has been a great summer so far.</br>  <br>aren't there other continents?</br>   You will never play Yggdrasil   So how does he fuck?  <br>Yggdrasil was pay2win as fuck, dude. It was most likely a terrible game.</br>  I don't understand why people fall in love with this series so much. Yeah, it's good, but it's not amazing. Just a solid 7.5/10.  <br>With his boner.</br>   Nigun's voice sounds so fucking familiar <br> Check his seiyuu <br> It's motherfucking Koyasu <br><br>You thought he was some second-rate voice actor, but it was HIM, DIO.</br></br></br></br>  <br> total level 62 <br> basic maths totals her levels up to 32 <br>Hold on a second here</br></br></br>  <br> others </br>  <br>Notice the "Others" listed at the bottom of her Job Level list.</br>  mfw this LN translation<br>Really wish I could into moon right now.</br>  <br>It's a 9 for me. Everything I would want out of this genre. It's really satisfying to see so much loyalty and admiration for the protag right from the jump for once. It's just somehow comfy too see a non-boy scout leader who still cares deeply for his followers. And of course, the sluts lusting for his boner.<br><br>Plus, the main character is a Lich. I fucking love skellies, Liches, Necromancers, and always thought they were misunderstood and made the villain too often.</br></br></br>   High Tiered Physical Nullification   <br><br>That's kind of lame.<br>Is it just so the author can throw in whatever he wants later or did the translators get lazy?</br></br></br>  <br>literally every single time these sheets are posted</br>  <br>Gorilla.</br>  <br> missing OTHERS <br>not all of her classes are listed, she's got 1 level of doppelganger and 62 class levels.<br>of those 62 class levels she's got at least 49 caster levels(every 7th caster level lets you cast one tier higher spells)</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.<br><br>Also, I don't know why the hell you'd think the translators got so lazy that they couldn't be bothered to write down the names of the other jobs. I mean, what? That's so irrational. Why bother translating the other names then?</br></br></br>  <br>If this gets to season 2 it has a small downtime but they payoff is totally worth it. Season 1 is mostly amazing though.</br>  <br>I would totally buy a figure of Mr Skeltal</br>  Am I the only who kinda doesn't like the name " Ainz ooal gown" ? Like, it's fine when they say "Lord Ainz" but whenever he says his full name I kinda cringe a bit. I honestly think "Momonga" was better. Hopefully it will grown on me  <br>Thanks m8</br>  <br> flying squirrel was better <br>que?</br></br>  <br><br>Where can I find the other profile cards for the other characters? Does Albedo have one?</br></br>  <br>Surprisingly relevant!</br>  <br>I keep thinking "own goal" when I see it, which is probably not the intention.</br>  <br>he was on GOMAD</br>  <br>Look it up on baka-tsuki.</br>  <br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA<br><br>The illustration archive.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>A spooky skeleton calls Flying Squirrel sounds scary as fuck.</br>  <br>Someone shoop Ainz's head to him.</br>  Muh OTP  ;_;   somebody post the LN art!  <br>I liked Momonga more at first, and was upset that he changes his name 4 episodes in, but apparently this <br> <br>Still, Ainz Ooal Gown is so 'Lich', it's growing on me pretty quickly</br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I think not, it seems to be character driven and MC that doesn't use sword in online game genre seems to be more effective in this type of shows. Thing with SAO is its too focus on the MC being too OP with his sword.</br>  <br> they were misunderstood and made the villain too often. <br> Implying Papa Bones isn't 100% villain material </br></br>  <br>He's a bro though. Don't fuck with him, bow down like the lower life form you are, then you'll be alright.<br><br> You will never serve Ainz ;_; </br></br></br>   that fucking battle hamster in book 2 <br>I don't know what I was expecting, but it wasn't that.</br>  <br>SAO didn't even capture that glorious MMO feeling.<br>This shit not only makes me nostalgic as a MMO player, it also riles up the D&amp;D faggotry in me.<br><br>Fucking double deal, man.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I felt so bad for her. Thanks based Sebas</br>  <br> SAO didn't even capture that glorious MMO feeling. <br>I have never been so disappointed by the execution of a concept as I was with SAO.</br></br>  <br>What a magnificent beast!</br>  So is this show One Punch Man and Log Horizon or SAO combined?  <br>If you say so</br>  <br>more like Bastard! and sao combined. now we just need heavy metal spell names</br>  <br>ops, I meant to say bastard and berserk</br>  I hope Papa Bones gets to rule the world.  Everyone is fucking level 100<br><br>Aintz is 100<br>Albedo is 100<br>Mare is 100<br>Aura is 100<br><br>You get a level 100 too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you're still here<br>Couldn't upload on 4chan, had to do it on imgur<br>http://i.imgur.com/Ylthjan.jpg<br>I'm not a photoshop wizard</br></br></br></br>  <br>It would be log horizon from the perspective of a dungeon boss</br>  <br>It's somewhat surprising how much emotion they are able to convey in a skeleton's face.<br>Is it the eyes?</br></br>  <br> http://i.imgur.com/Ylthjan.jpg </br>  <br>You get level 100!<br>And you get level 100!<br>Everyone gets level 100!!!</br></br></br>  <br>looks like shit. the color palettes are clashing</br>  <br> how much emotion they are able to convey in a skeleton's face <br>Literally none?</br></br>  <br>I agree, malice is exactly one more emotion than skeletons are usually capable of portraying. That is pretty impressive.</br>  <br>It sounded cooler when they chose the name.<br><br><br>Based sebas though.<br><br>Just finished the most recent translation, can't wait for sebas to wreck shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And Skeletons always have that happy smile on their faces. Pulling off such an ugly expression must be hard for the cuties.</br>  <br>It's definitely the eyes.</br>  People will definitely vector Momonga guild emblem and use it in their mmo guild logo soon or later. You guys should do it first instead.  Man this show is boring it's no fun when the MC just steamrolls everything  <br>Didnt all of his guild mates have their own emblem and flag?</br>  I for one welcome our new skeleton mage overlord.  <br>tell that to OPM, also the MC is pretty likable except when his thoughts start talking.</br>  <br>I was a fool to think this show wouldn't attract fight service faggots that just want le epic power level dick measuring.</br>  Why? Momonga sounds way cuter.  <br>Momonga is a jobber name.</br>  <br>You can see them at 20:10 ( 6 emblem ), and 20:47 ( 4 simple emblem ). I bet people will vector the big logo behind the throne.<br><br>Also I wonder if that sword inside shield logo in the left at 20:10 is Touch Me.</br></br></br>  <br>Momon emblem is his face right.</br>  You think they'd be friends?  <br>Why do you screencap your mpc player?</br>  <br>That's nice.<br>I could've done it better but I don't feel so well.<br>Thanks anyway.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm using Puu.sh, it's faster since I can link the result instantly.</br>  <br>You couldn't tell just from him talking? He changed nothing</br>  <br>A magnificent king indeed.</br>  Hell Flame? Someone should shop it to "flame posting".  What's the best/worst volume?  <br>3, 2, 4, 1</br>  <br> not do it in full screen <br>Nigga what ya doing</br></br>  <br>3 was the best for sure and while the first part of volume 4 wasn't that good, the last part made up for it so I can't even say 4 for worse.</br>  <br>3&gt;2&gt;4&gt;1</br>  <br>Waste of size since I'm not showing anything requiring detail.</br>  What is the rating for Overlord in Japan right now?  <br>3&gt;2&gt;1&gt;4</br>  <br>Best : 7<br>Worst : 4</br></br>  <br>If we're going by future volumes, 9 seems to be the absolute best so far. Ainz truly becomes  the Overlord and a king at the end of that. </br>  <br>Trash tier.</br>  <br><br>From what I have read so far.<br><br>3 &gt; 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 4 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 ½<br><br>Seriously, fuck Climb.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had a similar revelaiton when I went back and watched Excel Saga, as I had only seen the dub when I was weeaboo youngun, I feel as though I had been deprived. It's weird to explain to people who don't watch subbed anime how you can recognize a foreign VA.</br></br>  <br>No food additives, that shit fucks your teeth up and lack of proper diet.<br>Sure there would be some rot in just about everyones teeth but not to the point they'd look truly disgusting.</br></br>  Proof that Eve truly is the best girl. The fact that I got a belz from her a few days ago makes it even better  <br>Well VRMMO with freedom to create any class, with most shit like spooky skeleton death lord being ultra hidden sure sounds fun. I wouldn't mind throwing money at it.</br>  <br>Stitch of the pan showing the standoff between the Ainz and the Slane guys, please.</br>  <br>3 &gt; 2 &gt;= 4 &gt; 1 &gt;&gt;&gt; what's translated of 5</br>  Reminder  <br>That elf has som curse. Who would dres such a cute girl with men clothes.</br>  <br>I'm so glad I started reading the LN translation first before watching the anime. Ainz's human VA voice, while plausible, sounds too jarring.<br><br>Why can't more MMO-anime/manga/LNs be decent?</br></br></br>  <br>It's okay, her brother makes up for it.</br>  <br>Albedo is truly disgusting.</br>  Is the leader of Blue Rose actually a chuunibyou or is that a property of the sword of darkness she's wielding? Kind of like Toshi from Gintama?<br><br>I can't imagine a chuuni could reach adamantium... seems like something that happened after the fact</br></br>  <br>Chuuni.</br>  Is he in any kind of danger at any point during the story?<br><br>Watching a max level overpowered guy just trample over everything with everything at his disposal is getting kinda boring.</br></br>  <br>How hard are those 20 levels in "Other" races to notice? They are not revealed just so her True form remains a mystery, could be from Succubus to Arch demon to Donkey Kong for all we know.</br>  <br>Wait till vol 3 gets adapated</br>  <br> Watching a max level overpowered guy just trample over everything with everything at his disposal is getting kinda boring. <br>Sure because you've seen it all of 2 episodes.<br><br>Nigga just drop it. I highly doubt it's going to be your cup of tea.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even with cheating by using p2w items, he almost loses his fight in the third volume... he only wins due to even more cheating.</br>   I changed my name <br> to the same name! </br>  <br> implying watching Ainz and co. stomp fools isn't hilarious </br>  <br>He's in constant danger nigga. Nothing is more dangerous than being paranoid as fuck. Ainz's ultimate weakness is his self.</br>  <br>Ants don't have skeletons, silly.</br>  <br>This season is criminally fun.</br>  <br>No, to the point where he is willing to depower himself consistently to the point where he can just barely maintain absolute control of the situation.</br>  <br>He was momonga, so he changed his name to his guild's name to better spread it.<br><br>He only those those villagers it was ainz because it sounded more imposing</br></br></br>  <br>If your gonna do that than capture area, even so you uploaded the image all it takes to screen cap is alt+I.</br>  <br>His previous name was Momonga, you donk</br>  <br>The tension is in being sucked into an MMO and potentially fatally dieing. He's at no danger from NPCs but other PCs with similar abilities might be out there and could end him at any time. <br>But, not all anime gets tension from danger. In this case there is also the drama between the NPCs and the drama of being potentially permanently trapped in such a world. He's basically playing in it right now, not taking it too seriously. But it will get serious.</br></br>  <br><br>against what?<br><br>we just saw it wreck a top tier angel with no effort</br></br></br></br>  <br>The most dangerous person against ainz is himself</br>  Question for the readers: what are the chances that this is all a dream?    Japanese flying squirrel-sama!   <br>I'll kill maruyama/10</br>  <br> Ainz's ultimate weakness is his self. <br><br>Deep.</br></br></br>  <br>Himself<br><br>And Chair and gorilla</br></br></br>  <br><br>Alright you got me. I bet one of his guildies is going to show up and think he's a fuck nigga for stealing the guild name.</br></br>  <br><br>/a/ please.</br></br>  <br><br>  Chair <br><br>why do they fight? I saw it in the OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>That angel probably is low mid tier at best, they only think it's the strongest because they're ignorant. It's noted that there are angels that he would have to be on guard for and possibly retreat from but Nigan is too much of lil bitch to summon them</br>  Where's muh OP single YAYAYA  <br> top tier angel <br>It was a level 7 summon. There are 9 levels. To a lvl100 player, a level 7 summon is a punk-ass bitch, not a top tier at all.</br></br>  <br>He gets counterpicked</br>  <br>"Oh god I'm getting boned plz no shit"</br>  <br> She gets mindcontrolled </br>  <br>August 26.  I wish I could go to sleep for a month and wake up to OP and ED singles, 4 episodes, and 4 more chapters. </br>  Currently reading vol.3<br>If Shaltear really turns into a chair I am fucking dropping this.</br>  This is not being as good as promised so far. Does it evolve past Ainz being too powerful for the world and everyone on his side just loving him?   Shaltear turns into a chair <br>...what</br>  <br>She turns into a chair in vol 4</br>  <br>No. You should drop it and save yourself some agitation.</br>  <br>The purpose is to help locate other players provided they recognize it.<br><br>Mostly for his guild buddies, HE WANTS to be found</br></br></br>  <br>No sane man would love some fucking skeleton who is about to rekt the assholes of your country</br>   SPREAD THE NAME OF AINZ OOAL GOWN TO THE WORLD <br> grand display just and over the top shit just so he could find his old buds <br> ;_; <br><br>Why is this guy so fucking moe? <br>Ainz is perfect. Holy shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No.<br>Its actually really overrated.</br></br>  <br>Hasn't he changed his mind about this though. Didn't he realize that getting his name out there might not necessarily be a good thing, especially after Chair's incident?<br><br>Does he even know about PDL yet?</br></br></br>  <br>I still don't get it.<br>Does she turn into an ACTUAL chair or does she just let Papa Bones sit on her?<br>Because if it's the former, fuck this shit.  I hope I'm just being incredibly retarded. </br></br></br>  What is this chair thing about?<br>Why would he turn one of his top ranking subordinates into a fucking chair?</br>  <br>Even the most strongest skelly is lonely</br>  <br>Good news. It's the latter.<br><br>Bad news. You are fucking braindead.</br></br></br>  <br><br>She gets turn into a chair temporally as punishment.</br></br>  <br> She lets Papa Bones sit on her as punishment for attacking him when she was mind controlled. </br>  <br>Figuratively is the key here. Not actual IKEA product.</br>  <br>You're just being incredibly retarded.</br>  <br><br>Salaryman skeletons just want some love, man.</br></br>  <br>It might bring his old guild buddies who he still cared about from what I can see.<br><br>It might also bring about other players who are also stuck there, its a calculated risk</br></br></br>    <br>How many volumes is this temporary?<br>Does she get a fetish of being sit on?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>All is good in the world then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only a couple of paragraphs anon</br>  <br>10/10<br>it was years since I saw a good edit of that</br></br>  <br>Thats fine then.</br>  <br>As punishment.  even though she was pretty much orgasming constantly from having her Ainz-sama on her. </br>  <br>Constant orgasms can be painful.</br>  <br>10 levels standard magic plus Over magics.<br>incidentally that Angel is over level 50</br></br>    <br>I want a figure of Papa Bones!</br>  <br>The red valkyrie he fights in the OP is basically designed to kill him  by his best friend. </br>  <br>In anime world it only makes you ahegao and start blabbering<br> Hain-hamaaaaaa... </br></br>  New chapters were released, I don't understand why anyone would waste their time with the anime.   people thought the university girls were evil <br><br>It's called School Life for a reason. They need a school to live in.</br></br>  Reminder that all Gurashis are pure  Now what will be the next conflict? The uni girls realizing that they weren't just being cute with the bear, but that they're actually treating it as a human? The other gang forcing their way in? Or something else?<br><br>Also, I hope one of the uni girls comments on Kurumi always having her shovel around.</br></br>  <br>Left one had at least 10000 dicks.<br>Middle one had around 10 dicks.<br>Right one had no more than 1000 dicks.<br>Am right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Right one had 1000 different dildos and sex toys.</br>  Why is Yuki so shit?

Where exactly are they at right now? Is it on the other side of the university where the uni girls lived separate from the boys?

The uni girls are a faction that split off from the boys after a disagreement with how things were run.</br>  <br>dat ass</br>  <br>see </br>  So actually nothing happened. Bummer.  <br><br>The other girls said that she's their repairman. It's a pair of pliers and a wrench or something like that. <br><br> Could make a decent improvised weapon. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Drunk rape when</br>  <br>But there are girls too, more like those who want to fight can stay and those who are weaklings have to leave</br>  <br> So, from 1 to 10. how raped the girls will leave this place? <br>I am expecting the entire university to explode. The girls would be forced to retreat back to the bunker they went to last time. I expected the bunker was designed to give the girls an out, as otherwise they would have nowhere to go. Maybe one uni girl would survive and go with them, but I don't expect that.</br></br>  <br>We got to know the uni girls more and vidya references. We have enough HAPPENING in the anime so I appreciate that the manga is taking things easy this month.</br>  <br>  https://mega.co.nz/#!C9Q0iaiK!tn5HT<wbr>ILdpjDNGMejWLcasdbj5Lh0Udc3cFIsdSla<wbr>3rM</wbr></wbr> <br>thanks</br></br>  <br> So actually nothing happened <br>Hika's ass.</br></br>  <br>Thanks, have some animated Kurumi.</br>  <br>full body version when?</br>  <br><br>just check danbooru</br></br>  <br>Anon, you monster, now i have to fap and wait for a full body version that nobody knows when will come , fuck you</br>  <br>Well it's not about HAPPENING in the sense of shit hitting the fan, it's just about something happening with the characters besides fluffy sol stuff. Most of the stuff in the chapter can be easily inferred with the help of some indirect/efficient storytelling, the only thing we got from the chapter is that the uni girls seem to basically be good people and aren't planning shit.</br>  I don't want the uni girls to die.   you'll never get drunk with the uni sluts <br>What purpose is there in not being a zombie?</br>  <br>ENOUGH, Rii. This farce needs to END.</br>  <br> the only thing we got from the chapter is that the uni girls seem to basically be good people and aren't planning shit. <br><br>They're definitely hiding something at the least.</br></br></br>  <br>Glasses is so fucking scared of losing her comfy life she's gonna be planning something soon.</br>  <br> So actually nothing happened. Bummer. <br>The show is not an action series. The girls are trying to live as normal a life as they can despite the craziness outside. If anything the theme is they are all denying reality, because the alternative is going crazy for real and kill themselves. Like that one girl who walked outside because she couldn't handle it anymore.<br><br>The girls are trying to stay as happy as they can, because despair would kill them faster than zombies could.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Stop being such a massive tool, shovel.</br>  <br>I feel like they're being TOO obvious with Ruu being a bear. It makes me think that we're all just being rused.</br>  <br>I don't think anyone wants that but we're going to see at least one death.</br>  <br>Maybe but the last page implies they aren't being two-faced. If anything it might be a DARK PAST secret or some other shit, but nothing more than that.</br>  <br><br>Why did your posts remind me of Captain America?</br></br>  <br><br>What, you mean you guys don't already have the 3 and a half minute long, 1920x1200 resolution, 60 fps video?</br></br>  <br>They're going to do something in the next chapter, as indicated when glasses said "she'll start doing her best tomorrow."<br><br>Also, what does Hikari do? I'm assuming she's the one that guards their shit?</br></br></br>  <br> I feel like they're being TOO obvious with Ruu being a bear. It makes me think that we're all just being rused. <br>It isn't meant to be a secret. It is meant to raise the tension of WHEN the others would have to break in the bad news, or if Big Sister would deteriorate further.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it only 2 minutes and 25 seconds?</br>  <br>I feel the same about megu-nee in the anime.</br>   Kurumi is the primary hitter (can we call her Kuu already?) <br> Mii can hold her own in combat <br> Yuki can fight too if needed (can't we call her Yuu?) <br> Aki is probably the most /fit/ out of all uni girls <br> Hika can probly use engineering tools in zombie fight <br><br>What can glasses and Rii do?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mine's 3:38 long. Though I just realized there's another version on his website, but I don't think it can be shorter in length, because it's about the same filesize.</br>  <br>It's a five second looped webm. It's not even at 1920x1200 resolution. http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51591398</wbr></br>  <br>The tension isn't coming from us not knowing she's a bear and then suddenly revealing it, it's supposed to come from us noticing and always keeping in the back of our minds Rii's mental state and how everyone around her treats her.<br><br>It's damn good storytelling in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br> glasses <br>Maybe the uni girls all have weapons designed by Hika.<br> Rii <br>Go crazy</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait, scratch that. It is 2 minutes and 25 seconds like you said. http://www.kaitsushin.com/blog/</br>  <br> implying the car wasn't used by them to lure them in <br>they're evil alright</br></br>  <br><br>Those are samples. The full versions are in the mega link below the videos.</br></br>  <br> uni girls have weapons <br><br>Make sense, considering how the boys are STILL kept out of the Uni for so long despite having means to retake all the comfort, running water, and working generator/solar cell<br><br>Previuosly the gurashis were holding fort against zombies, this time they're holding against armed mobs?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well shit, didn't even think to check below the videos.</br>  I don't understand this picture.<br><br>Also, I wonder how the uni sluts survived at at all. Hika was responsible somehow, but they don't even have a decent shovel to whack zombies with.</br></br>  <br> having a WiiU </br>  <br>I don't think the boys know the girls have all that. I don't care how many weapons they have, If the boys really wanted to take over the girls they definitely could. They have a big manpower advantage.</br>  <br>Since I'm feeling nice, the password is inaka. I can't download the updated kurumiHD2 video for whatever reason, though.</br>  <br>I thought Splatoon needed an online connection to function in multiplayer.<br><br>Does this mean Nintendo servers didn't get affected by the zombies?</br></br></br>  <br>The zombies go home and play video games every now and then.</br>  <br>So many different rooms with TVs.<br><br>How luxurious.</br></br></br>  <br>Say what you want, but the Wii U has games.<br><br>All this Shovel and Megu-nee fanart makes me hopeful for good Mii-kun fanart next week.</br></br></br>  <br> Tofu Mii-kun. <br> Zombie = Bio = Tofu <br><br>What?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Japanese NEETs survived a zombie outbreak by being NEETs.</br>  <br>So shy girl is an engineering major.</br>  <br>Realistically, if you've barricaded yourself in your room with enough supplies not to leave for months on end, you're in a pretty good position when it happens.</br>  <br> yfw Yuki(stupid) or Rii(broken) accidently revealed to the outside that they have power and running water inside the Uni (maybe by setting up light show on the rooftop at night for "festival"/Ruu asked) <br> yfw it all TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DOWN TUMBLING DIWN </br></br>  Is it Miki or Mii-kun?  <br>Realistically, your home is not zombie-proof, with or without barricades.<br><br><br>This picture exists, yet there's still no Shovel Chiyo.</br></br></br></br>  Yuki has the best fanart.  Would the girls be getting raped in any other zombie story?  <br>2 girls in the left, 1 guy in the middle, and 2 guys to the right.<br><br>One of the women looks like she has long curly hair. Super high chances she is the univeristy nurse.<br><br>The other woman is wearing a track vest uniform so she might be in track team.<br><br>Two guys have baseball bats so they might be the baseball team.<br><br>Last guy looks like a military otaku but could be in the archery club.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do zombie stories ever rape?<br>I thought any sex was a death flag.</br></br>  <br>Cute and lewd fanart</br>  <br>She looks better without the ponytail.</br>  <br>The last guy is the crossbow dude that attacked them when they first entered the uni. The other 2 guys are most likely the helmet bros.</br>  <br>the guy is a harem MC</br>  <br>Only when they say "i'll tell you next time we see each other" after having sex</br>  <br>Oh, she's wet. Because of the hose. I see, very smart (lol).</br>  Well, an underground bunker for a university must have way more food and supplies and space compared to a local highschool so I don't think anyone is gonna run out of food anytime soon.  Gakkou Gurashi guest appearance on Wooser when?  <br>What's Wooser even about?</br>  <br> Realistically, your home is not zombie-proof, with or without barricades. <br>Funny enough I know many homes in Asia probably ARE zombie proof, just because there is so much concrete, earthquake resistant reinforcement, and metal barriers to prevent burglary. The main issue is there is not enough room to store food supplies, the population density means even more zombies per square inch, and you are probably a long way away from farmland.</br></br>  Have you already prayed to megu-nee today, /a/non?  <br>What a waste of a nice body, she died without knowing the all mighty D.</br>  <br>Now you don't know that at all.</br>  The next incident isn't coming from the zombies, but from the other group who will try to get in the university. I'm telling you.  <br>No but it would be extremely painful</br>  <br><br>She died pure. PURE!</br></br>  <br>Yuki gave it to her</br>  <br>She was gangraped by vorefags. She wasn't pure when they were done.</br>  <br>To be fair they only bit her in the arm.</br>  <br>Then explain this.</br>   Zonbi no ecchi!   <br>corpses rot away over time.</br>  <br><br>Cancer.

She only did anal. </br>  <br> Miki would have had the time of her life had she met megu-nee. </br>  <br>Now you know the truth, you're able to leave this hell and live the life you ever dreamed of, or just commit Seppuku, whatever you feel like it</br>  <br>I'd stop coming back here if there was a decent place to discuss anime. Lesser of many evils.</br>  <br>It's called friends.</br>  I just sat and read the everything up to the latest chapter, I now feel really depressed. I wish I could give all these girls a hug  <br>They all hate on Miki. The poor girl did nothing wrong</br>  <br>Then you're gonna stay here forever, any other place besides here is /b/-tear, and that's saying something, but here, have an eyepatch Mi-kun</br>  <br>Yuki is so cute, I can't get enough of her.

That was a long 13 minutes of despair.</br></br>  <br>Aren't you missing someone?</br>  <br>...Not really my type, I'm sorry.<br><br>Unless you were referring to Megu-nee. Megu-nee is cute, too!</br></br></br>  <br>What the actual fuck is this?</br>  <br>What is that expression supposed to be?</br>  <br>Something I really, really hope the anime will do properly.

What do you do?  <br>Continue browsing</br>  <br>Wonder why I have a basement, and why I'm in it.</br>  <br>Shoot crossbow.</br>  <br>Unzip my dick</br>  <br>Call the police and report them for breaking and entering.</br>  <br><br>Whip it out of course :^)</br></br>  <br>I have a basement?</br>  <br> 3P with Rii and Hika </br>  Rii's gonna die because of Ruu, won't she?  <br>I hope so.</br>  <br>Put on some pants only to secretly hope to have to take them off again.</br>  <br>No, my heart can't take it.</br>  <br>Ask to play cards.<br> strip poker </br></br>  <br>Yknow, hair down Aki is really growing on me. Anyone else feel the same?</br>  <br>Aki is the best uni slut.</br>  <br>I think this arc is going to be about bridging the gap between the uni girls and the other group, which will probably cover developing Kurumi and Hika's conditions, and then they'll have enough people to get to Randall.</br>  <br>There's only one thing to be done  NORMIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE GET OUT OF MY ROOM FUCKING NORMIES. </br>  <br>I think it's more likely that one of the Uni girls will die because of Ruu and that will snap Rii out of it.</br>    <br>Hello /r9k/, my old friend.<br><br> Just kidding, I don't have any friends. <br><br>Gekko Gouda Cheese episode 4 soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  Megu-nee, wake UP  Glasses is the best thing to happen to this show  <br>I can't wait for the Randall arc. It's going to be the best.</br>  <br>As someone who's apart of the water and celery master race I tell those fat whores with disgusting eating and drinking habits to leave.</br>    <br>I don't know, the best thing about this manga is them struggling to lead as normal lives as they can given their current situation. If it turns into a story arc about figuring out the truth of the incident or finding a way to save Kurumi I think it'll lost a large part of its charm.</br>  <br>Those girls are thin as shit, nigga.</br>  <br>Sure they are fatty.</br>  <br>The third of October can't come soon enough.</br>  <br>It's not even eight of clock anon. She doesn't have to go to school yet.</br>  <br>It might or might not lose its charm. Either way, the Randall plot has been heavily foreshadowed. Eventually, they're going to go there to investigate the incident, whether we like it or not.</br>  <br>There's a reasonable chance they aren't really normalfags. Hika seems like an engineering student and / or tech otaku. Aki might have been a normie, but she probably has been converted already.</br>  I want to get beaten down to a pulp by yuki  <br>I want to be Yuki. If I put on a pink wig and a cat hat, can I beat you down?</br>  <br>She's not Koume. She can wake up whenever she wants.</br>  <br>A cute hat and wig won't hide the fact that you're old, fat and disgusting!</br>  <br>No homo</br>  <br><br>But we're all cute girls here.</br></br>  <br>Kurumi and Miki's smiles will make up for anything.</br>  <br>I'm kind of unsure that Ruu is a bear, she might be something else.<br>Re-reading the part where crossbow-kun tries to shoot Ruu seemed kind of weird if Ruu was just a teddy bear.</br></br>  <br>He didn't try to shoot Ruu, he shot Yuuri because he told them to drop everything and she didn't.<br><br> I bet he gets a scratch and comes begging to the other group when he gets kicked out. </br></br></br>  <br>You're right, she's one of the lizard men that unleashed the plague in the first place and is mind controlling Rii.<br><br> She's the fucking bear, mate. </br></br></br>  <br>How long do we have to wait until we see yuki completely lose it? Or has she passed that stage permanently already? With the manga looking like it's still has a lot more to show I want to see more despaired breakdowns</br>  <br>Crossbow-kun wasn't trying to shoot the Ruu, what the fuck is wrong with you. He freaked out because Rii wouldn't drop it, he was aiming for her.</br>  <br>It works well enough for Yuki. She has hair sticking out of her ears, obvious old man in disguise.</br>  <br><br>Thats what I thought at first, but when Kurumi blocks his bolt and is approaching towards him, he was really hesitant to shoot her.<br>Unless he only had one bolt, but I thought I recalled him loading another.</br></br></br>  <br>He just saw what Kurumi did, of course he was hesitant to shoot again.</br>  <br>Of course he's hesitant, a potential zombie just made an impossible block and is now advancing towards him while rolling to intimidate.</br>  <br><br>That fucking matrix bullshit is the only part of the manga I disliked. She fucking threw a shovel at an arrow in midflight and blocked it, what the fuck.</br></br>  <br>She's gone full Alice.</br>  <br>indeed mistranslation.</br>  I want to fuck Aki.  <br>What does it say?</br>  <br>and also mind the text on the top left hand corner of the page.. (sorry that the image is rotated</br>  <br>"Is that, the legendary big five of Megurigaoka?"<br><br>Battle shounen arc incoming.</br></br></br>  <br> Is that the armed fighting faction? <br><br>something like that</br></br></br>  <br>No, shovel failed to block the arrow. The arrow simply missed. The shovel thrown out hurt Ri-san's leg.</br>  <br>Your blind anon. The arrow stopped in front of Rii, so it was stopped by Kurumi.</br>  <br>Where do you find the passwords for the rest of the stuff in the page?</br>  <br><br>yeah she threw the shovel<br>she is defenseless now</br></br></br>  <br>and,</br>  <br>It goes skidding off in the complete opposite direction she threw it, while the bolt stops. She blocked it.<br><br><br>She picked it up again.</br></br></br></br>  Is tolerance for the mentally ill a major sub-theme for this manga?<br><br>It showed Yuki was acting loony within limits of reason, and now Rii-san-chan has been traumatized and everyone's trying to help her along.</br></br>  <br>Look anon I know you don't have any so you wouldn't get it but that's what friends do for each other.</br>  <br>I mean there won't be anything on the level of classroom scene. She might despair for other reasons like people dying and such but the breaking down due to delusions is already a checked box</br>  <br>The passwords I've found are inaka, mikkago, nyaa, paradise, and kaitsushin. The first two are for the newer stuff and the latter three are for the older stuff. Just keep on trying until one of them works.</br>  <br><br>Lol what, he obviously shot "Ruu" (i.e. the bear). He was just trying to disarm Rii so he shot the place where she could potentially be hiding something, the fucking scene implies this by having him shot "Ruu" and having Rii step in to "block" the shot.<br><br>You two should reread that part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  <br> Look anon I know you don't have any so you wouldn't get it but that's what friends do for each other. <br>Yeah but now there's these new chicks and there's a good chance that they might shove Rii's face rudely into reality if they're not as kind, observant and tolerant as Miki was</br></br>  <br>Lol what? I think you need to reread it. He shot at Rii because paranoia gripped him when she wouldn't drop the bear.</br>  <br><br>see distance between the arrows' shadow and shovel's shadow. Plus the arrow is going down head-first so it have not been rebounce before it fall.</br></br>  <br>He literally explains that he shot because you can't trust anyone not to be infected / a zombie.</br>  She's dead already, isn't she?<br><br>It makes no sense they'd find her out there just like that.<br><br>And it seemed like only Yukki saw her.</br></br></br></br>  So the gist of the whole university matter is this:<br> big five started taking extreme measures to stop people from getting infected <br> the three girls at the university got bitten, used the serum and got superpowers like Kurumi, which is why they're able to hold their ground against them <br>So, battle shonen arc incoming?</br></br></br>  <br>True enough. But they don't know the bear is Rii's pretend sister yet, just that the girls call it "Ruu".</br>  <br><br>Look at where the emphasis is placed. This repeats in the first page of the next chapter and that also has a panel with Rii "covering" for Ruu.<br><br>He shot to disarm her and his bullshit explanation was just about trusting/mistrusting people, not about whether shooting the infected is mandatory.<br><br>Also the translation of that dialogue is fucked because the retard who translated the chapter was in full delusion about Ruu being real and interpreted the dialogue according to his headcanon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>See the fact that the shovel fucking spins out in the opposite direction it was thrown. The bolt collided with the shovel, rebounded, and fell. How do you think a shot that a page ago was aimed directly at her heart is suddenly falling to the ground some distance away, a sudden downdraft?</br>  <br> &gt;the three girls at the university got bitten, used the serum and got superpowers like Kurumi, which is why they're able to hold their ground against them <br>There is nothing to suggest any of this. All that's been said is that they had a disagreement and left.</br></br>  <br>The shovel touched the arrow, and the impact makes the shovel change direction and fly towards Rii, while the arrow falls to the ground. The panel shows you the moment right after the shovel and the arrow impacted each other.</br>  <br><br><br>Why no decent scans yet?</br></br></br>  <br>Seeing as the helmet bros and guy with crossbow were pretty paranoid about people getting infected, it's a pretty reasonable assumption that something more than a simple disagreement happened here.</br>  <br>Of course she's covering her, they're both standing next to each other and being shot at. I doubt she had the time to think about where exactly it's being aimed.</br>    <br>Maybe they just have the same policy as Yuki.</br>  <br> How the hell did you do this? </br>  <br>A disagreement about what to do with people who were very slightly wounded. The last page of this chapter shows Hika (I think) with a bandaid. I doubt it'll go battle shounen, but it seems likely that one of more of them have had some contact with the virus.</br>  <br>I agree. One of them might have been bitten, but there's nothing to suggest that yet. It just as well could have been that one of their friends was killed or expelled for suspected infection and they broke off because of that.<br><br> In fact, if one of them had been bitten and the other group new about it, there's no way the Uni girls would still be aloud to live in the campus with how paranoid the other group is.</br></br></br>  <br>If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel, then Rii damn sure had the time to see where the arrow was going. This doesn't even require thinking, it's instinctive. Try throwing something against a wall and have it bounce back, the position it's going towards is impossible to miss especially if it's below your eyeline.<br><br>The first anon thought it was weird Crossbow dude would shoot "Ruu" if it was just a bear, which also shows he interpreted the scene as him shooting there (the correct way to interpret it, that's what the panneling and composition is asking you to do). The explanation is very simple (he shot to disarm).</br></br></br>  <br>I want to cum inside this little delusional semen demon.</br>  <br> The last page of this chapter shows Hika (I think) with a bandaid <br>I think it's Aki.</br></br>  <br> If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel, then Rii damn sure had the time to see where the arrow was going <br>I don't think Rii had time to calculate anything. She just covered her "sister" by instinct.</br></br>  <br>Shovel is hopped up on zombie juice and going Alice on us.</br>  <br>"He's aiming for me, not the bear right next to me" is not instinctive. "I'm being shot at, I need to protect my little sister" is. What Kurumi did is pretty clearly impossible for a normal human, so bringing that up isn't really relevant. The entire conversation with Kurumi being angry and him saying that anyone could be infected makes no sense if everyone is aware that he wasn't aiming to kill or wound, and neither does the previous chapter's cliffhanger.</br>  <br> If shovel had time to calculate and throw the shovel <br>And why do you think that is?</br></br>  All hail Megu-nee.  <br>Why weren't my teachers this cute and sweet when I was in high school?</br>  <br> everyone is aware that he wasn't aiming to kill or wound <br>I never said everyone was aware of this, much less consider the situation rationally (not even the dude was calm there). They perceive hostility from him and he won't back up, but he didn't shoot to kill. The fact he didn't shoot to kill is not even the point of the scene, just something that we readers infer from knowing (assuming) Ruu is not real (otherwise he'd have shot to kill of course).</br></br>  <br> Having a Mega Drive <br>I found my waifu now</br></br>  <br>would you kiss an infected ?</br>  <br>A lot of your teachers probably had been like that in the past. It's a stage that lasts about a year at most before the cold hard reality of teaching horrible children finally grinds down their will.</br>  <br>Why japanese people keep tissues everywhere ?</br>  <br>Will I get superpowers too?</br>  <br>Fapping is their national sport.</br>  <br>Because they're not disgusting foreign barbarians who wallow in their own filth.  Depravity club were constantly reaffirming their comradery with eachother </br>  <br>Only if it was Kurumi.</br>  <br>Yes, in more places than just 1.</br>  <br> all that shit in your notification bar <br> over 100 tabs in chrome <br> the shittiest, lowest possible quality manga reader website <br> chink shit <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that person is anything like me then 100 tabs is perfectly reasonable.</br>  Next chapter can't come soon enough. I need the Gurashis being comfy.  <br><br>Wait, Ruu is real?</br></br>  <br>Are hese the girls that trade sex for food.</br>  <br>Aki is.</br>  <br>I'm actually getting kinda attached to Ruu, I don't want her to go away.</br>  <br>Yuki does all the speaking for Ruu and when she says "You're energetic" she's talking about Yuki. Ruu is confirmed for bear. </br>  Megu-ne died right? Was it off panel or something? Sorry if it's obvious but I want to know how she went.  <br>Gangbanged by a whole lot of smelly rotten zombie penises.</br>  <br>See </br>  <br>It wasn't outright said how, but it was implied she was bit while trying to get the others girls to safety in the broadcast room after the zombies somehow got through their barricade.</br>  So wait, Yuki is sane since they left the school? Like, since the moment she found a zombie while cleaning the classroom?  <br>We're never gonna know are we? Unless the anime shows it.</br>  <br><br>Yup. She is best girl.</br></br>  <br>Daft Punk and crew are letting the uni girls get away with monopolizing the comfort because the uni girls are all bit and are living off on the vaccines.</br>  <br>Yes. Didn't you notice that her monologue was a repeat of the chapter 1 monologue except she was seeing everything like it truly was this time? Almost like her character arc had come full circle and brought her delusions to a conclusion.</br>  <br>If they other group new the girls were bit, why would they just let them live comfortable inside school grounds when they could turn at any time? They would've killed or kicked the girls out ages ago considering how paranoid they are.</br>  <br><br>I somehow thought it was only temporary sanity</br></br>  <br>Didn't you notice that she hadn't mentioned Megu-nee until Rii brought it up?</br>  <br>Holy shit, that is sad.</br>  <br> temporary sanity <br>That's not how PTSD works, anon.<br><br>Somebody gets me the "I'm the best. Just the best" edit for Yuki.</br></br></br></br>    <br> no Megu-nee <br>Yuki has completely forgotten she's suppose to acting crazy.</br></br>  Did someone say Gomin? No?

That was the best scene in the manga so far. It was such a heart wrenching and pivotal scene too.</br></br>  <br>御免</br>  <br>Why is it so cute?</br>  <br>Because Yuki is gods gift.</br>  <br>心がー</br>  <br>god she's so adorable!</br>  <br>Why is autism so adorable?</br>  <br>It means moushiwakegozaimasin</br>  <br>ごみんなさい。</br>  <br> み </br>  <br>Did you just missed the joke? It's just above my post and you missed it?</br>  <br>based anon <br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Fuck me, that's why it's called the Fallen Club.</br>  <br>I think you meant 心臓</br>  How can you people trust the college girls?<br><br>They are cannibals or something, I just know it.</br></br>  Why isn't mangaupdates updated still?  <br>Because they're just shitty korean retranslations.</br>  Oy gevalt the new chapter is missing pages or what?  <br>No, there's not.</br>  <br>Shieet wait nevermind.<br>Pages were just ordered in a weird manner. I read the chapter starting from page 10 -&gt; 20 -&gt; 0-9.<br><br>KILL ME</br></br></br></br>    <br> no despair faces <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  How about we call this show gakgu from now on?    <br>Probably because whoever edited it didn't bother to zero-pad the page numbers.</br>  <br>This meme is funny, right?</br>  <br>They're bit.</br>  <br> playing Fallout3 at all <br>Seriously girls, you could die any day and you waste time with that shit?</br></br>  <br>Someone edit in the Miki's new despair face.</br>  <br>Which one is that?</br>  <br>It's hard to reconcile that idea with the fact they all seemed genuinely surprised by the emergency document.<br><br>They wouldn't be regularly injecting themselves without having received some information about the situation.</br></br></br>  <br>The one above the stache edit.</br>  <br>Realizing that there's a treatment and having a complete document showing the scale of the project from the people who made it are two different things. Since the split from the group was because of disagreements about what to do with extremely minor injuries, it's possible that a small enough dose won't turn you, will turn you very slowly, or even provide immunity through vaccination.</br>  <br>I think a better question is if the others know Hiki is bitten or not. She probably always went out alone, and if they never got vaccine then it's possible she kept it a secret, at least from the other girls. The rest of the university people might have seen her get bitten and are scared to go there.</br>  <br> Since the split from the group was because of disagreements about what to do with extremely minor injuries <br><br>Nowhere does it say that. Don't make assumptions and pass them off ass facts.</br></br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br> Yup... gathered all the people who could fight... <br> But even if you were a little hurt, you were dangerous. <br> But we didn't like that, see. </br></br></br>  <br> ass facts <br>Hika, pls. You found the food storage and stuff by yourself when all the armed dudes failed, it's obvious you were kicked out for being injured and then acquired zombie stealth.</br></br>  <br> I don't understand why anyone would waste their time with the anime. <br>Didn't read the thread because anime-only fag avoiding spoilers, but I would say Japanese to Korean to English translations are a pretty compelling reason to watch the show rather than read someone's guess as to what is actually written.</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>You do know that the Korean TL are only for the last 3 chapters, right? Everything covered by the anime is TL from Glorious Nippon Raws.</br>  <br> scared to go there. <br>That's dumb given they're the ones with the weapons.<br><br>More likely is the girls went full PTSD after the group went killmode on anyone with an injury, and they got exiled and expected to die or meekly come back.<br><br>Instead they got the electricity working and found food. There's probably now some mutual agreement between the two groups and Hika is likely the go-between.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just marathoned the manga. I doubt the girls were bit. Seems like the boys made everything safe pretty quickly. They said they felt bad for being holed up playing games so I think they don't know how to survive outside of the college.<br>Ruu is bear, obviously. Kurimi isn't kill because she hasn't shown any symptoms aside from the zombies leaving her alone until she speaks and having cold hands. It could just be nerve damage. <br>The theme of the series is keeping a brave face in dark times. That lets you predict pretty much everything that will happen.</br></br>  <br>Except only these, like, 4 newest chapters are from the coreans. Everything that the anime should cover are available in manga scanlation form translated from the japanese raws.<br><br>tl;dr, you're a real fag.</br></br></br>  <br>They're clearly utterly paranoid about infection. Weapon or no weapon, all it takes is one bite. Crossbow kid's crossbow didn't make him any more confident dealing with the School Life club, and he doesn't even have any real reason to think they're infected.</br>  Did they ever explain how Yuki got her hands on the moustache bear?<br>I'm pretty sure it was Sakura sensei's, but I don't recall her taking it with her to school.</br>  <br> That's dumb given they're the ones with the weapons. <br>If a single scratch can kill you, no amount of melee weapons will raise a bunch of courage kids' morale that much.</br></br>  <br>from what I read, there are no important translation-versus-original difference in the latest chapter.</br>  <br> courage kids' morale <br>Fuck you, brain. Meant college kids, obviously.<br><br>Also, if Hika can now block crossbow shots like Kurumi they have even more reason to be scared. It would also mean the uni girls know of Kurumi's condition since they saw her feat.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Why are you assuming Hika is part zombie? She has a scratch so she's infected? Bullshit. This is gonna end up just like the "College girls are evil" theory from last week.</br></br>  <br>I'm confused. Why would being infected enable Hika to deflect crossbow bolts?</br>  <br>she looks so fucken hot there</br>  <br>Why would a bear plushie need a backstory?</br>  <br>So I'm not the only one who feels that way<br> sweaty, hatless Yuki <br>my dick stands in silent salute</br></br></br>  <br>It's been around longer than Miki</br>  <br>You're expected to draw your own conclusions and think with the evidence you're presented. Every frame is important, and while we've seen more of the college girls, that doesn't mean they're telling the truth about the other group. We were clearly showed a bandaid around her finger. Could that be tricking the reader? Sure, but you should think about it anyway.</br>  <br>This nigger gets it<br>She just looks so much better without the hat and the added DESPAIR just makes it all the more sweeter. She hits best girl status for me when she rocks that no hat + despair combo</br></br>  <br>Just wondering whether or not it was a memento of Megu-nee's. <br><br>Pre-apocalypse, it was in Sakura's bedroom, she left it there when she went to school. Cut to present, and suddenly Yuki has it.</br></br></br>  <br>It looks like It's a popular character in universe, there were a lot of examples (Megu-nee's keychain, Ruu's outfit from Rii's flashback) so it might not be Megu'nee's bear but Yuki's.</br>  <br>I wonder if  Megu-nee's vibrator is inside it </br>  <br><br>The bike helmet boys had no issue with chasing after Miki and Kurumi with just a couple of baseball bats. Plus they're the ones who cleared out the university of zombies in the first place.<br><br>There's no way they're scared of three girls holed up playing video games all day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is what really doesn't make sense to me, we got one side of armed, belligerant boys and one of three geek girls drinking booze and playing all day in luxury.<br>How the hell are they not getting invaded by the male barbarians next door?<br><br>Unless they did something like bomb the whole university in case someone steps in uninvited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's still  inside Megu-nee. It's what distracted her from her hunger. </br>  <br>Makes sense. Thanks.</br>  <br>Why invade? They're not trying to conquer the city, they're just trying to survive. Even the girls don't think they're bad people.</br>  <br>1. They are the ones who got electricity, water and food. They may have threatened removing one or more of those if attacked.<br><br>2. An existing relationship between members of each group. Familial or romantic. (Likely Hika given her reaction).<br><br>3. Pity. The girls are/were damaged goods and need protecting.<br><br>Plenty of possibilities.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The girls seem to be living in a pretty better condition than the other group.</br>  <br>They should have access to the same resources. They're just too busy tryharding and not eating ice cream.</br>  <br>There's been literally no indication of their living situation whatsoever.</br>  <br>To the very least they had to guard their perimeter. The girls are just drinking off booze.</br>  <br>Why are they dressed like sluts? Shouldn't people in apocalypse world worry more about utility and survival than being slutty?</br>  <br>Didn't the boys say "Hey, don't go in there, it's dangerous!" when the group was driving towards the college girls area? Couple that with the "even if you were a little injured" bit, I think it's safe to say one of them is infected and the males think they'll catch it too or something.</br>  <br> Why are you shaking Ruu? Stop Ruu... we can't. You are my sister... </br>  <br>The girls  were all menstruating and the boys thought they'd been bitten <br><br>There, mystery solved.</br></br></br>  <br>Easier to move about, and less amount of material to wash.</br>  <br>I think all they said was "Wait!" when Kurumi and Mii were running away into the van, and then didn't say anything else. What's more of a mystery is why the girls were clearly looking out for other people during the day and even had a radio to contact them.</br>  <br>There's one shout of "STOP!" as they're just driving away (well before they start getting directions over the radio). Nothing after.</br>  <br> Didn't the boys say "Hey, don't go in there, it's dangerous! <br>No, they didn't. There was nothing said by the helmet guys implying that, and there's also nothing to imply that the ones chasing them belonged to the other college group. Stop trying to find a reason for Hika to be infected to satisfy your theory.</br></br>  <br> nothing to imply that the ones chasing them belonged to the other college group. <br>Except the fact that's clearly them in the groupshot? </br></br>  <br>No it isn't.</br>  <br> They have bats, that one guy in the group photo has a bat. They must be the same people! Right guys? This proves one of the girls is infected, right? Guys? </br>  <br> They haves bats <br> This must mean they're the same people! <br>Racist</br></br></br>  <br>Bottom right, exact same boy with the crossbow we saw.<br>It's them, dude.</br></br>  <br>We're talking about the guys chasing them with bats, dude. Not the crossbow guy, dude.</br>  <br>Turns out the guys might actually be good.<br><br>Suddenly, NTR trauma resurfacing...</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>One of the bat-wielders is clearly wearing the same outfit.<br><br>You're reaching too hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because there is a third group that the university girls just failed to talk about despite seeing the school live club be chased by them.</br>  <br>Yes, they are very clearly wearing the same outfit as in that very clear picture clearly showing the other group, which is clear and not at all completely obscured by shadow.</br>  <br>Not the same anon, but I don't see why you think this is such an outrageous assumption. Literally all we know about these guys is that they <br>1. Have baseball bats, which are pictured in both pages, and<br>2. They wear an open jacket/ loose shirt combo, also seen in both pages.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do you think the bat guys are from the college? They only showed up outside of the college when the school living club wasn't allowed in.</br>  <br>You're in denial.</br>  <br>You really think there just happens to be a third, completely unmentioned faction waiting outside the college gates?</br>  <br><br>She's infected because she's injured, you clod.</br></br>  <br>And you're drawing conclusions from incomplete evidence, i.e. full of shit.</br>  <br><br>Replied to the wrong guy, my mistake.</br></br>  The girls are definitely something. If not cannibals then probably something worse otherwise I doubt they'd just be left to their own devices.  Why is everyone so sure the other group is all guys? It looks more like 3 guys(crossbow-kun, and the Helmet Bros) and 2 girls<br><br>The middle right guy looks like the loose shirt Helmet Bro, and looks like he's wielding a bat in the silhouette, while the bigger guy you can't really tell his clothing, it also looks like he has a bat</br></br>  <br>Oh so now you're acknowledging the evidences, good good, one step at a time.</br>  <br>Why are you making the assumption that they're from some other third group for literally no reason? Despite that not fitting the scene of their introduction at all and being contradicted by the university girls?</br>  <br>I'm calling it now crossbow-kun is a reverse trap.</br>  REMINDER RADIO-CHAN IS ALIVE AND WELL  <br>There's a better scan of that somewhere with more detail, but I can't find it. It's not as pitch black a silhouette as the Korean scan makes out.</br>  <br> being contradicted by the university girls? <br>When did they contradict it? When did they say, "The guys that chased you were from the other group"? I'm just not making assumptions when things haven't been made clear yet, like everyone did with the uni girls being evil.</br></br>   2015 <br> still using cheek mouth </br>  <br>It's easier to animate.<br><br>No excusing manga/stand-alone images that do it though.</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Not evolving to have a mouth on your cheek </br></br>  KyoAni finds a way!  Sidemouth is one of my worst pet peeves.  <br>Did you notice the animes have huge eyes and miniscule noses too? Lmao</br>  Cheek mouth did nothing wrong  <br> not having a mouth on both cheeks </br>  <br>Now just fill in the blank</br>  <br>About that.</br>  <br> visible lips where they should be <br>She has a hole in her cheek, and no lower teeth or tongue at all.<br><br>Cannot unsee.<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> haha animation doesn't mimic reality perfectly xDD </br>  <br>Durarara!!x2 is a cancer because of cheek mouth.</br>  <br>Fucking hell</br>  <br>Finally! The elusive contact lens scene. I want to see this animated. Do they just expand when on the eye? Do they have gigantic lens containers?</br>  Is that time once again, /a/?  <br>what the fuck's going on in this picture</br>  <br><br>Actually it's two people there.</br></br>  Cheek mouth was a mistake.  FUCKING WHY   this thread   <br>10th time I've seen this, and I'm still confused as hell.</br>  <br>Please save us!</br>  <br>The only part that is really fucked up is her waist and legs, which seems to be backwards.<br><br>Other than that it makes more or less sense</br></br></br>  <br>The art also got worse.</br>  <br>Fuck, did I accidentally take Quaaludes myself? I'm not the only one seeing this, right?</br>  <br>It's like a Picasso thing</br>  <br>The artist forgot to consider the anatomy of the neck; her head is in the wrong position</br>  <br>Based KyoAni does it again!</br>  <br>how can you know this little about anatomy <br><br>have you seen a human being before?</br></br></br>  Budget<br>Each episode would cost double if animators had to do lips.</br>  <br>Guaranteed QUALITY replies.</br>  <br>It's like this. Her chin is almost touching her chest.</br>    <br>Quality thread?<br>Quality thread.</br></br>   being too dumb to understand stylization   <br>oh fuck I lost it.</br>  Mistake or intentional?  <br>This would be a really good image if it weren't for that third leg.</br>  <br>2 Vaginas.</br>  <br> Plot twist: It's actually a Monster Musume character that's part centipede. </br>  <br>Shit I can't find the reply to this image</br>  <br>That isn't a third leg down there, it's her huge hairless balls.</br>  <br> plot twist, it was just her enormous feminine cock tucked inside her ass </br>  <br>MIYAZAKIIIIIIIIII!</br>    <br>I don't get it. What was the mistake that's being encircled?</br>  <br><br>I could have sworn simpsons did a gag like this, where homer puts on a ridiculous sized contact lens for his cartoon eyes, but google is failing me.</br></br>  <br>You're actually talking to the original artist.</br>    <br>Dunno. Maybe they were running short on money for the last few movies. Or maybe the one guy who knew how to draw mouths progressively lost his motor skills over the years, and the one guy who could draw noses died in a car crash.</br>  <br>Cheeky.</br>  <br>Kyoani seems to randomly switch between drawing it correctly and drawing cheek mouth. It's confusing as fuc</br>  <br> The circle is the mistake. It wasn't added in, it was there when it aired. </br>  <br>Shading got severely shittier too.</br>     cheek mouth in manga     <br>It has nothing to do with money, their character designers just gradually tried to ape Takeuchi's drawing style more.</br>    <br>So they're just idiots?</br>  This guy must be living the anime life!  <br>Now blame otaku for it.</br>  <br>Based KyoAni is based!</br>    <br>Well the mouh is correct</br>  <br>Intentional. It's obviously symbolism.</br>  <br><br/></br>    <br>Thank you anon.</br>    <br>I'm not seeing it.</br>  <br>Piccolo blasted the moon apart again?</br>  <br>Is "it" her fucking ear?

Real proportions are shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>S-shes just sitting on her purse</br>  so is this stylized or just bad animation?  <br>Both.</br>  <br>I don't need an infographic to unnderstand the picture.<br>Have you considered that maybe you're just a bit dumb?</br></br>  <br>I don't like moeblobs either but its not bad enough to warrant this shit</br>  <br>Stylized but also likely has a pretty low budget, so that's the best they could do.</br>  <br>It's sakuga.</br>  yaoi  <br>Nope doesn't help at all</br>  <br> a shortstack Japanese girl will be 5ish <br>Stop using the word"shortstack" when you mean "short". Shortstack means that the are lso stacked, either in the tits or ass, which has nothing to do with their height and head size.</br></br>  <br>Blowing 3000 drawings in the first 5 minutes or so is hardly low-budget.</br>    <br>7-8 heads is highly stylized herculean/comicsmusclemacho type. K-ON's proportions are alright, especially in the anime itself.<br><br>And no side-mouths are not QUALITY, it a type of stylization, you're free to not like it but it doesn't make it wrong.<br>It's fun how people never find anything to bash KyoAni with so they resort to badly done promo art and "muhmoeblobs" wich are issues all the studio have.</br></br></br></br>  <br>NON-EUCLIDEAN HENTAI!</br>  <br>It's even worse than that. The eye sockets are too low for the ones on the one's on the right.</br>  <br> 10 fps isn't low budget </br>    <br>It's badly done stylized animation.</br>    <br> what is frame modulation <br>Also, that is a lot by anime standards. An entire Toei TV anime episode has that drawing count on average.</br></br>  <br>Side mouths are QUALITY. Come the fuck on. It's anatomically retarded and only done out of laziness. Please don't defend side mouth. I don't care about studio flame wars, but side mouth is fucking dumb.</br>  <br> It's easier to animate. <br>Explain further. I can not begin to comprehend how this is savingany substantial amount of time or effort, especially in the digital age.<br><br>Then go ahead and explain why it shows up in manga.</br></br></br></br>    <br> side-mouths are not QUALITY, it a type of stylization <br>KyoAni-fags, everyone.</br></br>  <br>This is what 3Dpigdisgustingfags want to believe.</br>  <br> especially in the digital age. <br>How is that relevant?</br></br>    <br>Fucking hell, every time</br>  <br>He never said anime was a mistake, dipshit. It's a fake quote.<br><br>Now, in that documentary whatever, he does talk about how otaku ruined anime on the technical side, which is definitely true.</br></br></br>  <br>if you're too stpid to understand while extra detail which requires more care to get the proportions right to look good requires more man hours and hence more money then you'll never understand.<br><br><br>there isn't a good reason wy it happens in manga except that the author isn't good at drawing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> more man hours and hence more money <br>Animators are paid by shot, and inbetweeners by drawing.</br></br>    <br>I don't get it. What's the problem?</br>  <br>You aren't even explaining the worst part: the neck and head.</br>  <br>Why<br>  actually it looks kind of cool. </br></br>  Do you people not realise that sidemouths have to exist in the 2D dimension otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell the characters facial expressions half the time  <br>Are you retarded? The actual amount of effort it takes to animate all that extra detail is near non-existant. It's like making bacon with your eggs.</br>  <br>This is some SHAFT tier shit</br>  <br>What's the problem here?</br>  <br>Anon's never been to Japan, and doesn't know about how their roads are steep as shit.</br>  <br><br>I'm fine with cheek mouth as long as there are no lips in the front</br></br>  <br> lipstick doesn't cover the lip <br>Oh goddamn.</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck keeps a wooden crate in his room?</br>  <br> two dimension dimension <br> expressing emotion in visual art is impossible without resorting to shitty drawing techniques </br></br>  <br>Just don't let the clothes confuse you.</br>  <br>That's a breadbox you fucking muppet.</br>  <br>I'm talking about  you dork.</br>  <br>If animators were great at drawing, they'd become real artists instead.</br>  <br>Wow! Great comparison friend!</br>  <br> not keeping a giant wooden crate full of guns and explosives in case the jerries or gooks decide to invade your property and endanger your family that you defended with your own blood and sweat </br>  <br>  using SHAFT to demonstrate good animation </br>  <br> be ivan the terrible <br> have one non-retarded son and heir <br> his pregnant wife is wearing revealing clothes <br> get angry and beat the shit out of her so she miscarries <br> your son complains to you about you beating the shit out of his wife <br> get angry and beat the shit out of him so he dies <br> "OH NO WHAT HAVE I DONE WOE IS ME" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the dumbest thing I've heard all week.<br><br><br>Now try animating it. That painting, at the very, very least, took a full day. It likely took more than a week.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So I guess big eyes are QUALITY too then ? I mean they're anatomically retarded too, what about that fang some character have ? Ahoge ? Oh and how about gravity defying boobs ? I bet they only do them because they are too lazy to figure out how physics works.<br><br>It's stylization. "I don't like it" isn't an argument.<br><br><br>Digital tools change nothing since they only impact on filming and coloring. Drawing is still done by hand, and often still done on paper in japanese studios.<br><br>Mangaka have to draw the mouth only once, so they can afford to make more realistic and detailed drawings. Even then, a lot of mangaka actually use side -mouths as well.<br><br>Not having to care about getting the perspective right save a lot of time. But it's really more about stylization. It's like fucking Peanuts. Snoopy has both of his eyes on the side of his head and nobody is bothered by it because they aren't fucking autists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ivan was Muslim?</br>  <br>no, just terrible</br>  <br>My point is drawing and animating a proper mouth that actually looks like a fucking mouth in profile is possible. It manages to be done in anime too.<br><br><br>There's no excuse for sidemouth other than being a talentless lazy piece of shit</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fuck, I laughed.</br></br>    <br> Side mouths are QUALITY. <br>You're a fucking retard. Are big eyes QUALITY too? No, you're just challenged.</br></br>  <br>The painting was just a reply to the utterly retarded notion that "2D" is somehow limited to the point where you can't even draw anatomy slightly resembling reality. Animate the painting? Draw the same scene, simplify the skin and texture detail and shading. There's absolutely no reason to completely fuck the shapes.</br>  <br/>  <br>I know you're shitposting but it's impossible for an animation for a weekly series to be perfect.</br>  <br>More time on unfinished shot means more risks to not meet the deadline, wich means that'll have to, at best, hire reinforcements at a cost or, at worst, go past the deadline and pay compensations.<br><br>So yeah, you want your animators to be able to work fast, really fast.</br></br></br>        <br><br><br><br>How. Why</br></br></br></br>  <br>That motion looks so off.</br>  <br>Maybe you should go over and tell them, then.</br>  <br>That's because realism doesn't work well in 2D animation. There's a good reason why Disney's animation style didn't go down the path of strict realism.</br>  <br>vaganias and such</br>  <br>It's CGI. It looks off because it was animated at a low framerate.</br>    <br>Nope, it's hand-drawn.</br>  <br>no, it's because it's uncanny valley cgi</br>   non-artists trying to use logic and reality to refute a design choice that reads to the human mind <br><br>ok</br></br>  <br> That's because realism doesn't work well in 2D animation.  <br> realism <br>Nigga<br>That's not how it works<br>That's not how real people move. That very well may be rotoscoped, but that's some stupid "acting motion" like they use in video games. The character is over-animated, like they're in a stage play or a PS1 FMV, which clashes with the police drama where everyone else is moving normally.<br>On top of all that, the director seems to have forgotten that this isn't an Oshii movie, and as such they can't keep the framerate necessary for good "over-animation," they just have a jerky mess.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"muh style" is no excuse for shit anatomy in terms of just putting shit where it goes. Big eyes? Stylistic, fine. Thin limbs? Stylistic, fine. As long as it's all in proportion. <br><br>Mouth sitting in the side of cheek? No, nigger. No free pass there. That's just bad art.</br></br></br>  <br>Any anime studio that uses Cheek Mouths regardless of the circumstances shouldn't be around.<br><br>That trope should have died in the fucking 80s, can't believe modern day 2015 studios still use it to try and save money or time. They don't care about anatomy in anime already but now they want to do this cheek mouth bullshit?<br><br>No, I'm sorry, just no. I'd rather they made a valor attempt at doing a regular sideview mouth animation of characters than cheek mouth bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> non artists trying to defend laziness because they're so ignorant they think it's a stylistic choice <br>If you read like any book, interview, etc, animators freely admit to it being a time thing. You got to be getting your information off of /r/anime or some dumb shit like that</br></br>  <br><br>I hate how they drew profiles in UBW.</br></br>  <br>go away /v/</br>  <br><br>It's hand-drawn. Okiura's known for ultra-realistic and smooth animation.<br><br> On top of all that, the director seems to have forgotten that this isn't an Oshii movie, <br>Ahem.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And an entire anime done in stickmen on a blank white background would be a stylistic choice. Newsflash, fuckwad. A stylistic choice can be shit art.</br>  <br> Trying to pawn off his opinion on someone else. <br><br>Half of what you said made zero sense at all, you're biased and have no fucking clue how framerate effects realism.</br></br></br>  <br>No it's not. It reads and is aesthetically pleasing, even. Maybe not to you, but to pretty much everyone else. The Girls Und Panzer character sheets explicitly state to use sidemouth instead of realistic mouth, and that shit was pretty popular on /a/.</br>  <br> you're biased and have no fucking clue how framerate effects realism. <br>I'm not the raging idiot who thought that was "realistic," so I'm not really the one with the problem.</br></br>  <br>First off, it's not rotoscoped. It's animated by an animator who is known for his realistic animation. Frankly, I think it's pretty interesting work. I like how the character movements feel solid and three-dimensional unlike in western animation where even the more realistic styles of animation have some exaggeration and subtle squash and stretch.<br><br> the director seems to have forgotten that this isn't an Oshii movie <br> GITS: Innocence <br> not an Oshii movie <br>Really now?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah because not enjoying cheek mouth and being a real stone cold dude about my high expectations in animation within an anime automatically makes me a /v/-tard.<br><br>You're probably the type who would enjoy anything regardless of how little a shit the people who animated it gave.</br></br></br>  <br> mass appal is a measurement of quality <br>Fuck your opinion. It's worthless and shit.</br></br>   this thread   <br>But it isn't. Realistic mouth gives off a different vibe. Sidemouth is more cartoony looking. Have you exprimented with both?</br>  <br>Bloom County did it in 1988</br>  <br>Judging by the head tilt, it obviously takes place in Homura's world.</br>  <br>What isn't?</br>  <br> muh opinion is better because I have good taste <br>Whatever, dude.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait, this is an Oshii movie? I genuinely thought this was Arise.<br><br>Is there some sort of eplanation as to why it's moving at ten fucking frames, then?<br><br> First off, it's not rotoscoped. It's animated by an animator who is known for his realistic animation.  <br>That's depressing.<br> unlike in western animation where even the more realistic styles of animation have some exaggeration and subtle squash and stretch. <br>That's because squash and stretch are the most fundamentally important parts of motion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You literally resorted to argumentum ad populum to justify why shit art isn't actually shit. You're a certified fucking retard.</br>  <br><br> complains about lack of realism in 2D <br> posts a heavily stylized and unrealistic reaction image <br><br>Oh the ironing</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This appears every time in these threads, yet it's actually possible in real life. One anon explained how you can have shit like this on a non-photoshopped photo using an overpass as an example, but I didn't screencap that so I can't provide a reference.</br>  <br> ANIME IS ART DOESN'T NEED TO BE REALISTIC AT ALL!!!!!!!!!! JUST LIKE PICASSO! </br>  <br>But the clothes ARE confusing.</br>  <br>He complained about lack of consistency nignnog.</br>  <br>Rhino awareness.</br>  <br> Any anime studio that uses Cheek Mouths regardless of the circumstances shouldn't be around. </br>  <br> Reaction Image is used to define someone's taste. <br>Oh how churlish can you.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Did they just forget how to draw noses?</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because the argument is what makes good art, which is subjective. All you've done is state that it's shit art without bringing any sort of reasoning to support your claims. At least I've provided the fact that it must have some sort of appeal and reads to the human mind due to its receptivity by many people. I was refuting the idea that sidemouth, as indicated by OP's image, while being "illogical" still reads to the human mind.</br>  <br>with side mouth, they don't have to also animate the jaw/chin moving too. they just have to animate the 5 or 6 or however mouth flaps and they're done. thats at least the reason i figure why its done in anime.</br>  <br><br><br>Perpendicular triangles with wigs on them.</br></br></br>  someone post the fucking noses from WIXOSS. I'm at work  <br><br> something that's never acceptable in one form is acceptable in another <br><br>It's called being a hypocrite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have any proof of it "reading to the hum an mind" whatever the fuck your dumb ass means by that as opposed to this just becoming the medium standard because the animators can get away with it due to the consumer having no choice other than abandoning the medium (which is just not going to happen)?</br>  <br>You mean Heaven?</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  <br><br>Oh god, why a such thing even exists?<br><br>Could it be that they are animated characters, and don't need to be exactly anatomically correct? No, it can't be that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Is there some sort of explanation as to why it's moving at ten fucking frames, then? <br>Because even Innocence doesn't have the budget of a Disney film. The film still relies on a lot of limited animation.<br><br> That's because squash and stretch are the most fundamentally important parts of motion. <br>It's a good guideline, but I don't think it's always necessary in animation. I find Okiura's style to have its own unique appeal, and it's not like he always avoids smears/squash and stretch anyway.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K9z<wbr>GVfN0DA0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>There are other animators that do realistic animation too, though not always on the same level as Okiura's. Unsurprisingly, they've also worked with the latter on multiple projects.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=m6E<wbr>igpn-fSE</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QMU<wbr>e5Vkh1K0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, everyone watching it and having no issue with it. Hence, my "ad populum" argument.<br><br>If it came off as girls with deformed mouths sticking out of the sides of their faces, then there would be an issue. Guess what, it doesn't. It's well-received and people like the aesthetics of the show. What does that indicate? It reads fine and is an acceptable, if not good solution to the design.</br></br></br>  <br> reaction image dictates you're taste <br> Liking realism should prevent you from using simplistic images in post <br> something that's never acceptable in one form is acceptable in another <br><br>I suppose in your case any anime you hate but still watched makes you a hypocrite?<br><br> This new. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're right which is why we need all anime to be like this<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=j0V<wbr>YVQQLI2Q</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I mean fuck realism anime isn't real why would you put effort into making realistic animation and art you fucking autists this is good enough.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's actually not only in animation, you have this shit in manga and VNs too. If people didn't like it, they wouldn't buy the serialization, games and BD boxes and would profusely complain about it on the internet, see TTGL episode 4 and the adaptation of Aku no Hana. <br>And tons of artists replicate this stylization daily, both in fanarts and doujinshi. Do you really think they would draw the same fucking thing they hate when they are free to draw whatever they want ?<br><br>It's popular because people like it, not because some jewish animator conspiracy force people to buy their BDs full of side-mouths.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>g8 b8 m8</br></br>  <br> Because even Innocence doesn't have the budget of a Disney film. The film still relies on a lot of limited animation. <br>Now explain to me why the first movie had a nomral, movie-quality framerate.<br>Then go ahead and tell me how hentai gets away with it.<br> It's a good guideline, but I don't think it's always necessary in animation. <br>It's important in expressing motion, especially if the work is recorded with a low framerate. Look at the early days with Steamboat Mickey.<br> There are other animators that do realistic animation too,  <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=m6<wbr>Eigpn-fSE</wbr>  [ ] <br> video starts with a normal-sized clown getting out of a toy car <br>Keep in mind I'm not bashing Okira; I'm saying there's no excuse for that scene specifically to be that ugly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>「Heaven」?</br>  <br> Yeah, everyone watching it and having no issue with it. Hence, my "ad populum" argument. <br><br>Due to initial investment in the medium and the standard being, holy shit, get this: the medium standard because the animators can get away with it due to the consumer having no choice other than abandoning the medium (which is just not going to happen)?<br><br>The consumer is satisfied because this is the only thing he is getting. What do you expect people to do? Riot in front of animation studios? Quit anime? Jesus fucking Christ stop being such an idiot. There's obviously distate for it, as evidenced by this thread and the internet in general, and quality animation is held up to a higher standard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> see TTGL episode 4  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2007-04-27/co-founder-takami-akai<wbr>-steps-down-from-gainax</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> I have no idea what sarcasm is please rape my face <br> black and white fisherman meme <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>This is it, after years of allusion I've finally solved it. Thank you blessed anon</br>  <br> RASEN KAIDAN </br>  <br> It's popular because people like it <br>It's popular because It's easier to animate.</br></br>  <br>Mezzo Forte is an OVA with sex scenes. Calling it hentai and trying to use it as an example of what hentai is like is just dishonest. Please try to be better than that.</br>  <br>That would be true if there wasn't any anime with more realstic faces aroud. Except there are.<br>So people do have choice to only buy these. They don't. Why ? Because they don't have any issue with side mouth, it gives a cartoony vibe and make cute things cuter.<br><br>Checkmate.</br></br></br></br>  <br>These black and white bait pictures are getting out of hand.</br>  <br>i was wondering, is under lip lipstick actually a thing or is it just a japanese geisha meme?<br><br>i have never seen a woman anywhere wear only lipstick on the under lip except for geishas that have like red under lip lipstick and white over lip lipstick.<br><br>its so fucking weird that every time i see it i cant concentrate on anything else but thinking about why they only have lipstick on one lip.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now explain to me why the first movie had a normal, movie-quality framerate. <br>Innocence isn't any less smoother than the first movie, if anything it had more scenes with notable animation.<br><br>That Mezzo Forte webm gets away with it since it largely depicts fast motion, rather than a scene with slow and deliberate acting.<br><br> video starts with a normal-sized clown getting out of a toy car <br>So? His movements in the sequence moves with convincingly realistic weight. Context doesn't matter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except there are <br>And more often than not they receive high critical praise in comparison to seasonal garbage. Do they dominate the market? No they fucking don't. Why? Because they're fat too few in between all the standard garbage that floods it out which is much cheaper to produce. Do you expect your average anime enthusiast to survive off one quality animated movie per year?</br></br>  <br>No, you're right.<br>Mezzo Forte had half the budget of Innocence, was roughly 2/3rds the length, and twice as good looking.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>http://webm.host/6afba/<br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And more often than not they receive high critical praise in comparison to seasonal garbage. <br>Name them.</br></br>  <br> Because they don't have any issue with side mouth <br>I do have issues with sidemouths. I'm just not autistic enough to completely drop a show based on a simple detail.</br></br>  <br>God damn it JoJo, get out.</br>    <br>Let's just get this over with.</br>  <br>Him and everybody else except you? <br>Edgy.</br></br>  <br>is that a clamp manga?</br>  <br>Having lipstick (or any kind of definition really) on the lower lip implies the girl has full lips, however if you go all the way and add lipstick to the top lip she becomes "sexy" as lipstick is associated with mature women.<br><br>So the idea is that it adds sex appeal while still keeping the character youthful and cute.</br></br></br>  <br>Now explain this.</br>  <br>Boku no Pico<br>Pico x Coco x Chico<br>Bible Black</br></br></br>  <br>Yup, that's what Im talking about. Horrible art style appeared, people complained, shit happened. If people didn't like side-mouths they'd do the exact same thing, directors would take note and animators would use realistic mouths. They don't because popular stylization and ease of use.<br><br><br>What about mangas, VNs and doujinshis then ? Is it easier to animate to ? Maybe it's both ?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This chart was made by someone who has no fucking idea what they're talking about.</br></br>  <br>*citation needed<br><br>There are many who like the style, as well. Stop making the claim that so many people find this to be an issue. Obviously that isn't the case, since it's ongoing and animation companies haven't felt any pressure to make the change in their animation. Sure people will nitpick other issues in their anime, but sidemouth is rarely brought up. You're full of shit if you think people care to the extent that you think. You're in the minority...other people either aren't bothered by it or like it, which is why it's so widespread, even in things like fanart.</br></br></br>  <br>It's the evil mirror Sakura.</br>  I'm trying to watch the Psycho pass movie with te anon subs but....<br><br>THE FUCKING ENGRISH<br><br>SO GODAMN DISTRACTING<br><br>I tried reading the subs outloud to distract myself but it's just too fucking awful. Why did they even bother forcing the obviously monolingual japanese voice actors to speak english? Why not Japanese and pretend its another language? American movies do it all the time. It's obviooiusly inferior to having foreign characters speaking the actual language, but definitely is better than whatever the fuck this shit is. It's unlistenable it's so distractingly bad.<br><br>It's *kind of* close to the subs but is still incomprehensible, but still vaguely sounds like english. So I'll stop reading the subs for a moment because "oh its similar", but then a second later i realize again that its totally retarded shit and then miss details on what's happening.<br><br>WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!!??!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Sucks to be you</br>  After zankyo no terror i am not afraid of engrish at arr.  <br>Yer kidden</br>  <br><br>It wasn't that bad. Seki can't do engrish for shit and it was hilarious hearing Kogami say mercenaries. They were just trying to be cool not having the whole world speak japanese. Once japanese people (usually akane) showed up, their translator watches took over.</br></br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic gave me PTSD.</br>  <br><br>Proust makes no sense even when pronounced correctly.</br></br>  <br> Why did they even bother forcing the obviously monolingual japanese voice actors to speak english? <br><br>Yo, there's lots mericans dat speack inglish not so gud.</br></br></br>  <br>Just mute it at those parts</br>  <br>i understand ebonics twice as well as engrish<br><br>hell even like islander english or hawaiian english which makes absolutely no sense<br><br>that engrish was just english sounding gibberish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> english sounding gibberish <br>Didn't sound Murikan to me.</br></br>  <br>Who cares burger. Be happy they give a fuck about your english and actually tried doing it</br>  <br>u right cheeky cunt bastard<br><br><br>heh i suppose</br></br></br></br>  <br>THey were so bad the guy making the subs got the Engrish wrong</br>  <br>He said that he intentionally tried to reinterpret some of it.</br>  <br>no wonder established subbers wanted nothing to do with this<br><br>not even subbing, more like decoding ancient mayan or some shit</br></br></br>  <br>Kiniro Mosiac was fucking terrible too</br>  Is the movie possible to watch for someone who dropped season 2 at like ep 4?  <br><br>Nope.</br></br>  <br>Kamiyan, Gil and Hanakana engrish was funny. I enjoyed that.<br>Joseph's engrish was really bad though, but it's mostly for just one scene. <br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br>  at least we got more anterctic dorops  <br><br>And akane perspective.</br></br>  This film might as well get an English dub.  <br>She didn't get the kogami dick, AGAIN.</br>  <br><br>I was visibly upset when she shared his room at the base and he slept on his fucking chairs. She even made that cute pouting face.</br></br>  Just let people infer from context when another language is being spoken. The vast majority of Planetes was 'actually' in English but they didn't feel the need to make the cast Engrish it up.  <br>I was seriously expecting her to jump kogami when she woke up at night in that scene.</br>  <br> WHY DO THEY DO THIS?!!??! <br><br> go abroad <br> people don't speak the same language <br> use lingua franca <br>Sounds logical to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I tried reading the subs outloud <br>what the fuck?</br></br>  I think kogami was expecting that too  <br><br>Damn not robo dutch and his mercenaries had to ruin everything.<br><br>I was expecting a lot more gore and violence as well because urobutcher was involved with the writing but I guess he was put on a tight leash.</br></br></br></br>   terr me avout kogami, wai does he wear the hair?   <br>Just watch the other episodes (there's only 11 episodes in total) or read the episode summaries if you're that concerned. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_<wbr>of_Psycho-Pass_2_episodes</wbr></br></br></br>  How the fuck did they manage to find a Vietnamese for voice acting and not an English native  <br><br>Getting weird vibes from ginoza. He knows he's sexy and he seems mad at kogami because he doesn't want to be with them but akane still likes him and because of that she can't see ginoza as a man. He's become progressively hotter.<br><br>Also I have the weirdest boner for shimotsuki. I just want to destroy that smug bitch.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I wonder what ginobuns will look like in s3.</br></br>  <br> Hey Akane, I killed your grandmother <br> Also you're a shit  <br><br>smug cunt needs to beaten again</br></br></br></br>  <br>I did like how Akane's last line in the movie was basically telling Gino that she can carry her own weight and that she doesn't need protecting from Kougami.</br>  Because it sounds cool for Japs.  <br> S3 <br><br>Pls no. Season one was great, but after that they ran out of ideas. Season 2 was awful, movie was nothing special.</br></br></br>  <br>They tired to do a Blood the Last vampire thingy?</br>  <br> I was expecting a lot more gore and violence as well because urobutcher was involved <br>This doesn't take you back to a certain visual novel? I found it quite endearing.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he'll get jacked for akane. I love the heibo ponytail.<br><br><br><br>I hated her so much but as she developed during season 2 I actually started to like her despite her flaws. She is definitely a bitch but she toughened up like akane did and now she rivals her in terms of intuition and also serves as a foil.<br><br><br><br>Ginoza wants to carry that weight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I dropped s2 in middle because i couldn´t handle listening to Hanazawa anymore. <br><br>So she is speaking engrish in here ? Fuck best to avoid it.<br><br>Isn´ t Sawashiro in it ? She speaks decent english.</br></br></br></br>  <br> that face <br>my sides, I was half expecting a 'HAAAAAAAAAAAAH? NANDA TEMEEEEEE' from her</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he'll get jacked enough to turn into Big Boss. That's s3's plot for you.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm pretty sure they would fuck that night but unfortunately mercenaries had to attack.</br></br>  <br> She speaks decent english. <br>Despite that they'll still force to japanify her english</br></br>  <br>Fuck, why are they doing it ? They did this shit with Akio as well.</br>  <br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5TX<wbr>Tpik5wf4</wbr>  [ ]<br>Reminder</br></br></br></br>  <br>Movie was fun and entertaining. I would like them to continue until they resolve Akane and Kogami's character arcs.</br>  <br><br>I guess the seaun military guys getting slaughtered by drones qualified, but I meant more gore and violence in terms of plot. People died in disgusting ways but it wasn't really as disturbing as some of the murders in season 1 or the torture in season 2.<br><br><br><br>I love her bitchy attitude. She would definitely fight back and make it more exciting.<br><br><br><br>I don't know what they would do in s3. Akane won't join sibyl but she won't resist it or argue that it should end itself. Although it didn't feel conclusive, saying that sibyl would keep evolving at the end of the movie pretty much summarizes what will keep happening. Sibyl takes over humanity while akane keeps it in balance. Nothing could possibly happen that would make her resist sibyl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and now she rivals her in terms of intuition and also serves as a foil. <br>No she doesn't. Mika didn't deduce shit, Sibyl told her everything from the start.</br></br>  How would you give the show a conclusive and good ending? Apart from having kogami and akane doing the do at last.  <br>Sybil is introduced to more countries.</br>  rip in piece best grill  <br> Akane and Kogami doing the dew <br>The series is obviously building up towards a Spike Vicious type of scenario, they're not going to fuck they're going to kill each other.</br></br>  <br>  I don't know what they would do in s3 <br><br>Every week sybil is trying to do something dumb and/or evil and Akame has to lecture Sybil about why it's dumb and/or evil, then Sybil grudgingly accepts her reasoning and moves on to doing something dumb and/or evil next week.<br><br>In the end it turns out Akane is a robot that's meant to replace sybil</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe a Spike and Faye. Then again, S1 already kind of did that.</br>  <br> Akane is a robot <br>That plot twist wouldn't have too much impact.</br></br>  <br> Spike and Faye <br>They were never Spike and Faye. Akane insured that Kougami survived by throwing herself into the fray. She couldn't stop him from killing Shogo, but she sure as shit stopped Shogo from killing him.<br><br>Fuck, Faye was a useless cunt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you know what I mean, anon.</br>  If they make a season 3, I hope they get Urobuchi write it, nobody wants the shitfest that was S2 again  <br>Well, all Production IG needs to do is look at sales of the movie, sales of season 1, and compare them to sales of season 2.</br>  <br>Why is shiberu even listening to akane anyway?</br>  <br><br>Her intuition is what got sibyl paying attention to her in the first place. If akane didn't become retarded due to kogami being involved, she would have immediately realized that sibyl was using the military to expand. She knows better than anyone else how sibyl works but took the bait regardless. Shimotsuki mocked her for this and even akane couldn't retort. She just took her dominator and got mad at sibyl for being realistic.<br><br><br><br>Sibyl isn't dumb, it just lacks the human perspective because not enough people question it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She generally tends to be right. They don't have to act like sneaky jews when being transparent gets them ahead anyways.</br>  <br> Her intuition is what got sibyl paying attention to her in the first place <br><br>So it hasn't actually grown at all, gotcha.<br><br> She would have immediately realized that sibyl was using the military to expand. She knows better than anyone else how sibyl works but took the bait regardless.  <br> Shimotsuki mocked her for this and even akane couldn't retort. She just took her dominator and got mad at sibyl for being realistic. <br><br>And then Akane made Sibyl change its policy while Mika twiddled her thumbs and promised to act like a good Sibyl goy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mika is just a dumb pawn, she's useful to Sybil because of it, nothing more</br>  <br> my ears are being assaulted</br>  Why did they have to hold a small military parade to kill Akane and Kogs?  <br>It's really hard to do. Whether Sibyl loses or wins depends on the people, a single character shouldn't bring it down because it will be against the the themes of S1, it will also be a bad ending for the majority of the pampered citizens of Japan. <br>If by any chance the people don't want Sibyl anymore, it will be unrealistic if it's just a few years from the end of the movie and being very far in the future will mean milf Akane and sage wizard Gino. Which is definitely interesting. <br><br>If they didn't bring down the system, then it will just be a rebellion that ends in failure, if Kogami stages that or just gets to be gray fox to Big boss, the ending will probably be too predictable and anticlimactic. <br>Another option is for it to end in a compromise, where the rebellion somewhat succeeds and Japan is split into two. <br><br>I think they'll just say fuck it and make a prequel, it's the safest bet.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  On a scale of 1 to ZnT's Five, how bad is it?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Js<wbr>h8eCcVI0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Why was S2 considered bad? It was fun. They had only half the amount of episodes that S1 had to polish the plot too.</br>  <br><br>A prequel is definitely interesting. I want to see how Sibyl was implemented and what came before it, how the citizens initially responded to it.</br></br>  <br>it's considered bad because everyone inevitably and logically compares it to season 1, which was much better.<br>personally I think season 2 is ok for a bunch of wacky fun, kinda like the fast and furious movies.</br></br>  <br>I actually hated s2 the first time I watched it, but I rewatched it lately without comparing it to s1 and it's not as bad as I remembered.<br><br>Maybe it was bad because everyone kept waiting for Kogami to show up and he never did.</br></br></br>  <br>Half the amount of episodes, and even that was too much. It could've worked as a couple of OVA's I guess.</br>  <br><br><br>The black merc guy is definitely a five, <br><br>as for the rest it's probably a range of 3-4.5 with like one or two speakers being a 2 (but only because they didn't make them say any complex words)<br><br>I'd say 4-4.5 would be the average</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> oh no! the rocket gonna blow me up soon! <br> better sit still and smile like a retard </br></br>  <br> this is fine <br> I'm ok with this </br></br>  <br> I won't be used in the future anyway <br> T-thanks Urobutcher-sama </br></br>  <br>Sorry mate you can't outrun gigantic explosion (unless you're John Rambo or John McClane) and moving 3 meters away from epicenter won't really help much.</br>  <br> Why not Japanese and pretend its another language? American movies do it all the time <br>"By the way, your Russian is superb"</br></br>  <br> Why not Japanese and pretend its another language? <br>The funny thing is they even had a gimmick to justify talking in Japanese, but they didn't use it.<br><br>You gotta keep in mind though, Japanese people think English is the hypest shit.<br><br>I don't know why<br><br>But they fucking love it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I don't know how to put it into words, but mika isn't as unintelligent as you think she is. She might be dumb for not challenging sibyl like akane but she isn't unaware of her position.</br></br></br>  <br> Why was S2 considered bad? <br>Freankenstein-kun and Darkness-kun weren't half as awesome enemies as Makishima and ChingChong.<br>Kogami was missing and while Akane matured and kicked ass, her interaction with Ko was much more fun than her interaction with inspector Bitch. Gino got sidelined and used as a bait for cheap sympathy when shoot-first-identify-victim-later-k<wbr>un chunked his almost girlfriend.<br>S2 focused too much on slaughter and too little on the main plot - introduction of collective psycho pass.<br>Also S1 had a huge advantage since it did the whole world building and character introduction.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know how to put it into words, but mika isn't as unintelligent as you think she is <br>You're fairly effective at selling out your ideals, friends, and family to save your own skin, I'll give you that Mika.</br></br>  <br>Animation and art went dowm the shitter<br>Plot went down the shitter (but Urobuchi has only ever shown that he can follow through exactly once; and that wasn't for lack of trying)</br></br>  Why do I have a feeling that 99% of the people crying about Engrish aren't even native English-speakers themselves?  <br> imminent impact <br> seriously thinking running away will safe you <br><br>that's the fun thing about explosions, you can't outrun them.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm a slav.  I watched the movie yesterday and while I could hear and understand why anons call the English bad I didn't mind too much. I though native speakers would mind more since they are accustomed to 'normal' non buthered English.</br>  <br><br>I feel like you haven't watched the movie</br></br>  <br>Of course an American wouldn't have any problems with butchered english, am I right?</br>  <br> 'finally, death embraces me' <br>I wish we had more backstory on them. The mercenaries had some potential, but they were just canonfodder.<br><br>Hora!</br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed the engrish, I figured they wanted to make a definite distinction between nations.<br><br>That being said, if the roles were reversed I would have enjoyed and laughed too.<br><br> You should really watch the movie though </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I was always under the impression that she was asshurt from her friends being murdered so she became an inspector to protect others. I'm still very confused about sibyl revealing itself to her and most of s2 for that matter. Why did sibyl think mika would reveal its secret? I don't understand how misako exerted so much control over the 200 other sibyl members and acted independently. Akane convinced them to judge the group and eliminate the good members who soured the group, but mika didn't seem to want that responsibility.</br></br>  <br>Why would Americans have a problem with butchered English?</br>  <br> I was always under the impression that she was asshurt from her friends being murdered so she became an inspector to protect others <br><br>Remember she warned her friend about Oreo, but then stayed away from her friend when her friend got more involved into Oreo's business?<br><br>Mika has always had a talent for sensing danger and being enough of a slimey selfish asshole to get away from it.<br><br>Now if she was just a coward I think people would like her, but she's also a jealous bully who reacts to guilt by doubling down on her awfulness.<br><br>She is, quite frankly, a terrible person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Has anyone had and resolved an issue where VLC keeps telling you that it can't play an .undf file type, and there's no way to fix it? I'm assuming since OP started a thread referring to the anon subs (the one I torrented), it was working for him at least.  <br>Sadly, I think most people irl are like Mika. She's a pretty realistic character.</br>  <br><br>How is it selfish to avoid danger when you have no power of your own? It's not like she could kill oreo or report her with any substantiated proof. At least now she has a dominator and sibyl on her side. I used to think she was terrible back when she was denying kamui's existence and when she didn't intervene at the treatment facility, but something about her feels right and I don't know what it is. I can't help but feel that akane is a hypocrite because she criticizes sibyl for forcing people to accept it and not respecting the fact that humans gave it power, yet she has no issues with the system existing even though all new people are basically forced into the system.</br></br>  <br> but something about her feels right and I don't know what it is. <br><br>I guess you just really like killing Grandmothers, Anon</br></br></br>  Should I watch the Extended Edition or BDs if I'm watching S1 for the first time?  <br>extended edition contains spoilers</br>  <br> yet she has no issues with the system existing even though all new people are basically forced into the system. <br><br>Akane has clear issues with the system existing, but she's not going to just blow it up and let everyone in it suffer the consequences.<br><br>That would be the more arrogant thing to do, actually, to act on her own and destroy the system, thus making a decision for millions of people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, okay thanks. How bad are the spoilers?</br>  <br>pretty bad, ruins the fun of it. I'd recommend you watch the BD, then try to search for a compilation of the extended scenes on youtube or something.</br>  <br><br>She didn't have an alternative. Togane would have killed her if she didn't comply. I just don't understand why she investigated such dangerous information in the first place. Sibyl doesn't want to get rid of akane, only the toganes want to.</br></br>  <br> VLC </br>  Movie in a nutshell...<br><br>* Akane ga Kill<br><br>* Kougami rekt by Akane and everyone else<br><br>* Mika a shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Help me /a/<br><br>How do I convince (trick) my normalfag/dudebro friend to lend me his XBone so I can play the VN?<br>He doesn't know I'm a weeb because I hide my power levels.</br></br></br>  <br> it's not my fault <br> it's not my fault <br> it's not my fault <br>It's time to stop posting, Mika.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you're a normie surely you can just save up for an Xbone?<br><br>If not just trade him your PS4 for a bit or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Kougami rekt by Akane and everyone else <br>This is getting blown out of proportions. <br>Akane won because Ko was surprised she's there.<br>Kogami was dong fine against 2 mercs at once until the papa cyborg joined. <br>He even managed to punch the guy in the face after being tortured for who know how long which surprised the rest of merc bunch.<br> Mika a shit <br>I agree but she got like 3 lines in the whole movie so it was kind of inconsequential.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So what, she was just supposed to die?
