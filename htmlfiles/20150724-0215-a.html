[ http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/666<wbr>92<br><br> Japan is laughing at us again </br></br></wbr>  Are they?<br>I can't particularly tell what they're saying at all.</br>  <br>They're laughing at us because Gangsta is the most highly rated anime in the west this season, even though it's dogshit.</br>  <br>A lot of the comments seem to be about Akagami no Shirayuki-hime. What are they saying about that?</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>They are saying it figures a show like that would be popular in the west, but all I see are compliments for Gangsta. Then they're mostly curious as to why Gakkou Gurashi and Monster Musume aren't rated higher.<br><br><br>They're calling that one shit though.</br></br></br></br>  The only thing worth laughing about here is Japan's declining birth-rate.    <br>Why is Yuno so mean in that image?</br>  <br>Not their inherent shit taste?</br>  <br>Yeah, this is what I thought was going on. All I saw was them saying that Gangsta has a western atmosphere, so it's expected.</br>  <br> Akagami no Shirayuki-hime <br> They're calling that one shit though. <br>For what reason?</br></br></br>  <br>I may be an old man but I like Akagami.<br><br>Akagami? Never heard of it. It even airing?<br><br>Curious I checked their homepage but when I saw "series composition: Akao Deko" I immediately closed the page.</br></br></br></br></br>  They're also wondering how we're dealing with the puns in shimoneta  Gangsta is the best show this season. them nips be trippin   I thought Westerners liked zombies, why isn't Gurashi higher? <br> I guess they just like gangstas more </br>    <br>II don't know what anyone translating it to, as I never checked it out but, someone should tell them "poorly".</br>  ＞ｂａｋａ　ｇａｉｊｉｎ　ｎｏｔ　ｒａｉｋｕ　ＲＡＢＵ　ＲＡＩＢＵ   they can stomach the garbage that is Seraph because of Shinoa huh <br><br>LOL</br></br>  <br>Yaraonfags hate shoujo, shoujo is always under their radar, they like muh dark, ecchi, twist, waifuwars etc</br>  <br>A lot of people hate shoujo. I don't see why you're giving them specifically shit for it.</br>  <br>Their favourite is TUEEEEEE rite.</br>  <br>Yaraon commenters are surprisingly anti-LL despite Yaraon being almost 50% LL articles.<br><br>muh sutema, basically.</br></br></br>  I told them to buy more Gakkou Gurashi.  <br>No shit, Shinoa is perfect.</br>  <br> MAL <br>I'd be making fun of us too.</br></br>   MAL   <br>maybe on /a/ but since that yaraon talk about MAL rating, MAL doesn't hate shoujo</br>   Bones Shoujo <br> Charlotte <br> Gate that low <br> Gangsta above Gate and Gurashi <br><br>They ain't laughing about me, m8</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They aren't wrong.</br>  <br><br>what are those miniature limp dicks saying?</br></br>  <br> LOL </br>  I bet they would call /a/ hipsters for having Pleiades as AOTS last season.  <br> MAL <br> having good taste </br></br>  <br> japan laughing about taste <br>kek, they're the last nation on earth to talk about taste</br></br>  It seems like they're telling us to buy the DVDs for gangsta since it won't sell over there  <br>pleiades is good tier anime, don't you ever harsh qt astronom mages</br>  <br>  Not counting sequel <br>Yaraon knows how to misleading<br>94.

I'll accept uncensored hentai when they stop drawing horse pussies.</br>  <br>They publish articles in a blatantly sensationalist manner, and also stealth market (sutema) shows. Specifically Aniplex titles.</br>  <br> Jap gal say american boy no thanks <br><br>Isn't like 40% of Japan's males NEETs who don't go out anymore?</br></br></br>  I don't suppose they paint all anime fans as fat virgin otaku basement dwellers too?  I tried to post  using google translate  that MAL is shitty site<br><br>I don't know if I'm just making more a fool of westerns</br></br>  <br>No, yaraon is japanese Sankaku Complex, japanese reddit is 2ch and if you don`t even know it you should go back to /v/.</br>  <br>Insufferable otaku have to pretend to be better than someone.</br>  <br> japanese reddit is 2ch <br>Enough of this fucking meme</br></br>  <br>Gangsta is ok and far from being shit.</br>  <br>Maybe trollish as Sankaku but not SJW and normalfaggot-ridden like Kotaku</br>   us <br> MAL </br>  <br>Yeah.<br>I saw that.<br>You're better off posting in english.</br></br></br>  <br> implying there's a difference </br>   128 <br> lol <br> &gt;/out/ <br><br>Tell me this is just you shitposting elevens and that they do not have the exactly same posting habits</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have extracted the resources out of some games and I have seen perfectly drawn pussies with beautiful rugae and a cute cervix.<br><br>What a fucking shame.

I mean it comes on at 3AM. But I haven't seen it so if you so say.</br></br>  They aren't making fun of MAL though.<br><br>A lot of them says that it does makes sense for Gangsta, that they are surprised that Charlotte and Gakkou Gurashi top this well and it'd be cool if we'd buy the shows.</br></br>  <br> They have simple taste, which is why they like kid's shows like symphogear <br><br>Elevens with their shit taste don't understand the genius that is Symphogear</br></br></br>  <br>and that will also make you implied that Yaraon has good taste</br>  <br>Sorry, I don't have firsthand experience in chinese imageboards. You however seem to uphold the standards of traditional western shitposting.</br>  <br>very predictable shittaste from MAL, just newfags think that such shittaste is unexpected, westernized anime attracts the worse type of retard.</br>  <br> Wakako-zake 6.17 <br> Kurayami Santa 5.94 <br>Why can't these people appreciate shorts?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Just like here.</br></br>  It's MAL so anything below 8 is bad.  <br> Gangsta. 8.28 <br>SHIT TASTE<br> Akagami no Shirayukihime 7.86 <br>GOOD TASTE<br> Charlotte 7.82 <br>SHIT TASTE<br> Overlord 7.82 <br>SHIT TASTE<br> Gakkou Gurashi! 7.76 <br>GOOD TASTE<br> Shimoneta 7.76 <br>SHIT TASTE<br> Monster Musume 7.73 <br>SHIT TASTE<br> GATE 7.72 <br> Rokka 7.71 <br>GOOD TASTE<br> Prison School 7.63 <br>SHIT TASTE<br> Ushio and Tora 7.63 <br>GOOD TASTE<br> Himouto!

Gangsta probably wouldn't be first but it's up there.</br>  <br> Gangsta. 8.28 <br>How can taste be so shit?</br></br>  <br>How ironic.</br>  <br> Overlord 7.82 <br> SHIT TASTE <br>Are you one of those guys who thinks that Overlord is a SAO ripoff?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Is pretty unpopular for a fujoshit marketed shounen since those tend to sell like hot pancakes it also gets barely any fan art in both pixiv or Twitter<br><br>Judging by how Kekkai became popular among fujos instead they prefer more subtle approaches when it comes to their pandering</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck.</br>  <br>Your mother.</br>  <br> being surprised that they eat up harems </br>  <br> Gangsta <br>Boring show with no substance, only muh action scenes<br> Charlotte <br>It has Maeda's name on it, so it was bound to get high scores despite being dogshit so far.<br> Shimoneta <br>Absolute trash "comedy" that's 90% unfunny sex jokes.<br> Classroom Crisis <br>An actually good show showing idealism vs. realism and good corporate drama. Gets low scores because MAL hates good anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think they know the the MonMusu manga is pretty popular over here, which is why they might be surprised.</br>  <br>Gaijins aren't allowed to post.</br>  <br>I don't even know if you are saying it's good or bad.<br>It isn't, just like SAO.</br></br>  <br>i gave monstershow benefit of the doubt, downloaded it and noped the fuck out 2 minutes in after seeing a dude get constricted by a giant snake while sleeping. im a full grown man but that shit gave me nightmares.</br>  <br>SAO isn't bad though.</br>  <br>They probably prefer the manga since the anime actually made the story straighter.</br>  <br> Gangsta <br> 8 <br><br>What the FUCK? Yes they can laugh</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's basically furfag/horsefucker shit, but in anime format.</br>   yaraon <br> eating up the same "little girls with a dark tweeest" anime <br> laughing at others shit taste </br></br>  <br>I was going to call out your ignorance and shit taste (outside of Charlotte), but that Classroom Crisis gave me a chuckle. 6/10</br>  <br> because MAL hates good anime. <br><br>Nobody gives a shit about Classroom Crisis over here, does it mean we do have shit taste as well? Sore wa shokku.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's horrible.</br>  <br>It is though. From the very beggining. Through and through.</br>  <br>Gurashi is good.<br><br> YYY was incredibly overrated though. </br></br></br>  <br><br>Everyone dropped the show on the first episode but it's gotten really good. I'm sure the other 5 anons who are watching it will agree with me.</br></br>  <br>Do you really have to ask?</br>  <br>Just like Overlord.</br>  <br> &gt;eating up the same "little girls with a dark tweeest" anime <br> implying there's anything wrong with that <br><br>Outside of their insane addiction to Love Live, Yaraon is a carbon copy of /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br> does it mean we do have shit taste as well? <br>I don't know how new you have to be to not be aware that /a/ has shit taste as well.<br><br>Anyway, Classroom Crisis is good.</br></br></br></br>  Implying if /a/ scored their anime, the ratings and ranking would be any different.   Japan literally wonders why moe and monster girls aren't out selling death note 2.0 <br><br>Well. Give us any of the following; yuru yuri, yuyushiki, kokkuri-san and moe ratings will rise. <br><br>Give us a monster girl quest anime adaption and you can get Horo 2.0 on the rise as well. Someone should really make me a CEO of anime or something I just solved all the western problems nippon faces.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would spam votes to Symphogear or Gakkou Gurashi to avoid that.</br>  <br>I'm saying that Overlord is nothing like SAO, it's actually good and deserve to be ranked high.<br><br><br>Nice shit taste.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They have simple taste, which is why they like kid's shows like symphogear <br><br>Is this dumb shit serious?</br></br></br>  <br>Mass spam would happen and all the voting would be skewed.</br>  <br> They have simple taste, which is why they like kid's shows like symphogear <br> Do they buy discs? No? Then who cares <br>This is funny because out of 39anime I'm watching this season I'm buying only Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not though, it does its job very well for the genres it covers.</br></br>  <br>Anon 2 here, I agree.</br>  <br><br> manga is pretty popular over here <br>I seriously thought that it was maybe 5 vocal fans that kept those shitty threads alive<br><br><br> Same<br/> </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's why the proxyfags are here to save the day.<br><br>Besides.<br> thinking Gangsta would be at the very top if it was an /a/ poll <br>Hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Give us a monster girl quest anime adaption <br>Please don't.</br></br>  <br>Which is what I said. Did you even follow the chain?</br>  <br><br>Strawpoll has a captcha version now, not to mention using google's poll.</br></br>  <br> I seriously thought that it was maybe 5 vocal fans that kept those shitty threads alive <br><br>This is how you spot a newfag.</br></br></br>  <br>It is pretty popular as a whole judging by how it represented in media, of course the anime is not as popular as Kekkai anime, but Seraph manga still sold better than Kekkai, you can't judge popularity based on disk sell or fanarts alone there is those people who doesn't have money to buy the expensive BDs or have time or like to draw.</br>  <br> It isn't 100% set inside a school/academy <br> it's probably a kids shows then <br><br>Sasuga nips</br></br></br></br>  <br> it's actually good and deserve to be ranked high. <br><br> typing this while talking about others having shit taste </br></br></br>   people go to MAL for anything other than reverse searching what the english title would be   Yeah Japan is the one who thinks Psycho Pass is a good anime.<br><br>Doesn't give Kokkuri-San an S2.<br><br>Abandons Saori Hayami.<br><br><br>Fuck JAPAN.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't call it really good yet but it's shaping up well. Each episode was better than the previous so far.</br>  <br>Mate you're on 4chan do you think that could possibly stop anything?</br>  <br> Classroom Crisis <br> Good <br>Thanks for the laugh anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Akagami no Shirayukihime and Charlotte would undoubtedly near the top.</br>  <br>What, you mean the harem genre? Because that would be shit like Tenchi. MMO? .hack, Log Horizon, and even Overlord is better. Romance? It's shit tier in that department.<br><br>So again, what does SAO do very well in?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry anon it has been years since the release. I am sure it is safe to mention it on a korean picture website.</br>  <br> buying anime </br>  <br>Lelouch, you are in no position to insult them.</br>  <br>Then you probably weren't in the threads because a lot of people agree the anime was in fact gayer, not to mention how the manga markets Shinoa as the third most important character in the series(she has the second most screentime after MC), while the anime markets Guren and Ferid above her in importance just so they can market them to fujos in posters</br>  <br>I use it to check voice actors</br>  <br>It does all that shit very well except the romance garbage, never said it was the best though.</br>  <br>Yeah, we're all hackers on steroids here amirite? Now get out of here and go make a script to bypass the captcha, anon. Godspeed!</br>  <br> complaining about going on mal while posting tumblr garbage </br>  <br>You don't have to be a hacker to be a loser and fuck over the voting system</br>  <br> senpai-I mean Japan is trolling us so fucking hard <br> and we eat it up like Japan has any sense of taste <br> they actually bought kokoro connect BD/DVD'S <br><br>Japan is a nation of cucks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes it works out. I have a bunch of anime that's out of print. If I so chose I could sell them for a nice profit.</br>  <br>Little girls with a dark twist is a fun type of show though.</br>  <br>It is literally the worst MMO based show, and the harem is shit because Asuna wins but it still pretends the girls have a chance.<br><br>I guess it looked pretty good, that's really the only thing it has going for it.</br></br></br>  <br> does MMO very well <br> special snowflake gary stu solo gamer <br><br>Correction. It does wish fulfillment very well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I use the lists to remember what episode I'm up to.</br>  Japanese aren't answering to our shit posting, what do we do?  <br> It does wish fulfillment very well. <br><br>Then it's a good MMO.</br></br></br>  <br> Seraph manga still sold better than Kekkai <br><br>They both sold about the same and sold out in stores<br><br>And that just means Seraph is popular among normalfags and Chuunis, hardly the target audience they were going for considering they don't buy BDs</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tumblr memeing <br><br>This is the weapon of the enemy. We will not use it. Moot has faith in us to do better.</br></br></br>  <br>Better than thinking that you're supporting anyone by buying Crunchyroll Premium.</br>   yaraon <br> MAL <br>Nothing matters.</br></br>  <br> not buying anime <br>I also buy manga and LN.</br></br>  What's the japanese equivalent of MAL? We can laugh at their shittaste too.  <br>Sorry to hear that.</br>  <br> us <br><br>That includes......?</br></br></br>  <br> ...... <br><br>You, for sure.</br></br></br>  Gangsta isn't bad though. Overrated as fuck but I wouldn't call it bad  <br>Well, MAL likes it so it's safe to assume it's bad, perhaps we should start false flagging and making threads like we do with Steins;Gate, AnoHana or Clannad.</br>  <br>What, did you lose your periods or something?</br>    <br> no non non biyori <br> gakkou gurashi that low <br><br>I am glad western market is irrelevant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I read plot synopsis of shows there and keep my backlog up to date. I read some of the reviews also but most of the time the reviews are not helpful.</br>  <br> lose your periods <br><br>Oh right yeah period, the symbol not the biology one, yeah got it.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying /a/´s placements would be diffrent from MAL's or AB's. </br>  <br>Symphogear is an anime for kids by kids.</br>  <br>If you look at post 94 in that thread you'll see that the guy left a lot of stuff out, maybe just to shitpost.<br><br>Junjou Romantica 3　　　scored 8.50<br>Durarara!!x2 Ten　　　scored 8.30<br>Non Non Biyori Repeat　　　scored 8.21<br>To LOVE-Ru Darkness 2nd　　　scored 8.16<br>Working!!!　　　scored 8.02<br>Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX　　　scored 7.79</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it has bewbs and panties and suffering.<br><br><br>No, faggot, OP didn't count sequels.</br></br></br></br>  <br> They're laughing at us because Gangsta is the most highly rated anime in the west this season, even though it's dogshit. <br> at us <br> us <br>Gansta is theated like shit it is on /a/. MAL != "us".</br></br></br></br>  <br>But Hibikek is the AOTS and I am not even a yurifag.</br>  <br> sequels <br>Guess what, unless the new season is utter shit, only those who liked the first and/or second one will watch the new one, meaning high scores are a given</br></br>  <br><br> It's meant to be trite shit! <br><br>Fans are terrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, they're doing something very wrong if it's not meant to be shit.</br>  <br>No shit, but how the hell are Japanese able to find that out?</br>  <br> MAL != "us" <br><br>Good joke.</br></br></br>   Last season was so bad that Kyoani, Gainax car ad and Bones' corpse are all AOTS   <br> Gainax car ad <br><br>The five guys who watched it screaming AOTS don't count.</br></br></br>   one guy thinks foreigners should've had monster musume as a favorite <br> another one thinks it should be gurashi <br> another thinks its overlord <br><br>They are not actually far-off.<br>Also, do they have the 'mainstream' mentality there?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Bones' corpse are all AOTS <br>I really hope you are talking about Show By Rock! m8.</br></br>  <br>It's not meant to be shit <br><br>It's over the top and funny, GX also has some great fight choreography and a budget. People like Symphogear because the first season started out as some grimdark MS with suffering death and people vomiting gallons of blood. Then midway through the season the studio changed and it turned into a sentai show that didn't take itself seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>This year, I think I might be able to stop watching these Chinese cartoons</br>  <br>Anime to them is like dr.who to us. Even if you don't watch it. It is so engrained in the culture that you recognize the name.</br>  <br>I forgot that even existed, so no. Kekkai Sensen lacked everything that makes a show like that good.<br>The ONLY good thing, oozing with style, was the ED.</br></br>  <br>GX is definitely the best symphogear so far.<br>Watching it reminded me of watching A's years ago.</br></br>  <br>Pleiades was legit good though, it even had the old scientifically-accurate shtick that Gainax liked</br>  <br> is like dr.who to us <br>Dr. who?</br></br>  <br><br><br>S2 &gt; s1 &gt; s3<br><br>Fight me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After the terrible last couple of seasons, I almost did. This season though, is hitting all the right places.</br>  <br><br>A's is far better, though.</br></br>  <br>Sure thing.</br>  <br>Dog Days syndrome?</br>  They are not laughing at us, they understand and a lot say that they are fed up with low level, vaguely ecchi comedy too.  <br>im not surprised that Gangsta is doing well in the west. Just like how Cowboy Bebop bombed in Japan but was anime of all time in the west, same with Black Lagoon.</br>  <br>Tell me one thing you didn't like about it</br>  <br>There is slight difference between Gangsta and Cowboy Bebop and Black Lagoon. Last two werent complete shit.</br>   MAL    tfw forced to hate Gangsta since normies like it   <br>No they're all shit<br>Or they all aren't shit<br><br>Pick one</br></br></br></br>  <br>I couldn't make it trough the first episode. It was unoriginal and really childish. I have nothing against shows targeted at children but it was for the wrong kind of children.</br>  <br>The characters were completely bland especially Subaru and Minato, Aoi was annoying, the first four or five episodes were really slow and a chore to watch, it didn't get interesting until episode 10.</br>  <br>Cowboy bebop is over hyped shit and black lagoon sold well because a girl is drinking beer. <br><br>Gangsta will sell well for the same reasons. That OP of dancing hookers and drugs.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because you think they are shit, doesn't mean it didn't make a fuck ton of money in the west.<br><br>Gangsta reminds me a lot of Black Lagoon, so again it surprises me none that it does well in the West. Cowboy Bebop shares a lot of things that both shows do as well in terms of character types, people they surrounded with, etc. Though I will agree Cowboy bebop does a lot of this but is done a lot better.</br></br></br>  <br> Just like how Cowboy Bebop bombed in Japan <br><br>It didn't though.</br></br></br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>Compared to how it did in the west? It did.<br><br>Thats why CN was able to pick it up dirt cheap.</br></br></br>  <br>S2 was kind of a joke with the cartoony evil Sugita voiced villain.<br>GX started with a bang with the alchemist faction dolls fighting the sympho girls. My only complain is Miku turning into a stay home wife instead of becoming one of the symphogear user.</br></br>  <br> sell <br>They are popular but they don't sell<br>Expect negative numbers for Gangsta</br></br></br>  <br>They are not laughing, but only praising Gangsta. A lot.</br>  <br><br> genuine Gangsta fags </br></br>  <br><br>Top pleb.</br></br>  <br>Oh good, I though I was reading it wrong.</br>  <br>Is Gangsta really that good though?<br><br>The only thing that was really interesting there is the fact that one of the MCs is deaf and the scientist dude. Other than that, it's been really fucking tepid.</br></br></br>  <br> it didn't get interesting until episode 10. </br>  <br>That anon can't into moon see they aren't saying it's bad<br>Also<br> Cowboy Bebop <br> bombed </br></br></br></br>  <br>I can guarantee it isn't childish at all, and while I wouldn't call it dark it become quite melancholic by the end <br><br><br>Fair enough, I wouldn't call them bland though since they all had nicely fleshed out personalities and issues <br><br>The show was low-key and slowly moving with no giant outbursts of emotion or drama</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're actually retarded.</br>  <br>I don't understand what I'm supposed to see interesting here<br>I understand you like the series but it was really bad</br></br>  <br>im the 2nd anon you quoted there. I'm not trying to defend it at all. I enjoy it, I think its "alright" and something fun to watch when I want to turn my brain off.<br><br>All I was saying is that its no surprise its popular in the west because it shares a lot of the stuff that is popular in other titles like it, all of which are also popular in the west.</br></br></br>  <br>I should have said too the ending was fine but I didn't really enjoy the series overall.</br>  <br>It's not the best thing I've ever seen, obviously, but as it stands there's no reason for me to HATE it at all. It's worth watching.</br>  <br>Like /a/ already said, it's overrated. That's pretty much it.</br>  <br>its just kinda "meh" - if you liked Black Lagoon you will like Gangsta</br>  <br>You're probable better off reading the manga. During all the years I spend here I've never once heard anybody talk shit about the Gangsta manga. Seeing so many people dislike the anime was a surprise, actually.</br>  <br>Maybe bombed is an exaggeration, but Japan still didn't love it as much as the west did.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon. Anon is pretty retarded when it comes to reading. That or troll.</br>  <br>Its not. Its just like when retarded Gaya kids hyped Deadman Wonderland to be best thing since Naruto. Its just normalfags jumping on board because think its "westernized manime" while its shitty boring manga from same magazin as Btoom! written by talentless hack whore.<br><br>Everyone who read manga knew it`ll be shit from get go. Manglobe doing adaptation does not improve it.</br></br></br>  <br>its meme hate. any /ak/ thread pre-anime had it as a recommendation.</br>  <br> I've never once heard anybody talk shit about the Gangsta manga. <br>Because no one read it. When people read it because an anime adaptation was announced, there were a lot of people who called it out as a mediocre series in summer 2015 anime threads.</br></br>   MAL <br> lol <br>Whoever wrote this, do you really think that they give a fuck about a/'s stupid sectarism?</br></br>  <br><br>I liked Black Lagoon's characters better. <br>Unfortunately, I'm still completely indifferent to the characters in Gangsta. Everything is just so fucking bland.</br></br></br>  <br> All I was saying is that its no surprise its popular in the west because it shares a lot of the stuff that is popular in other titles like it, <br>As pointed before, there is small but important difference - unlike other "popular at west" titles you mentioned, Gangsta is shit.</br></br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>Gangsta is NOTHING like Black Lagoon. Jormungang would be like Black Lagoon, Gangsta is really bad Samurai Champloo.</br>  When are the mods going to delete this thread?  <br>So far I only think one is interesting- but the setting is pretty much the same as Black Lagoon. Its no surprise where the influence might have come from.</br>    <br>I watch it only for alex.</br>  <br>Why talk about shit? There is a lot of shit manga /a/ does not talk about.</br>  <br>Should I read Gantz manga?</br>  <br> kokoro connect <br>Why not? Inaba was lovely.</br></br>  <br>VA drama.</br>  How can anyone who thinks Love Live is the best anime ever tell others they have shit taste?  Why does almost no one appreciate the hidden gem that is Makura no Danshi?  <br><br>It was in New York Times best selling list for a while</br></br>  Has there ever been an anime or manga mentioned on /a/ that wasn't shit?  <br>Because there aren't many homosexual on /a/.</br>  <br>No, I mean when it had threads or came up in discussion you would never see anybody saying it was bad. <br>Might've been because the actual reader-base was small but I'm not too sure, you'd see it get recommended often and it was pretty well known.</br></br>  <br>We need a shitposting containment thread.</br>  <br>Not the same if you exclude the setting, the type of company they run, the type of setup of how the city runs, the cops involved in the underside of the city, etc<br><br>Jormungand is nothing like Black Lagoon at all - I don't think I can really think of anything super close to Jormungand.<br><br>Anyways - Until Death Due Us Part anime when or Gunsmith Cats full series?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They just can't appreciate the cute pillowboys</br>  <br>Because it's trash.</br>  <br>It's not cute, it's gay.</br>  <br>Do women actually find a face like that attractive?</br>  <br><br><br>You guys clearly don't know what good anime is when you see it</br></br></br>  <br> shitting on symphogear <br>alright that does it</br></br>  <br>I do, Gakkou Gurashi finished airing a few minutes ago.</br>  <br>makura no danshi is on monday</br>  <br>I don't hate hate it, I was just really wondering if that face is considered attractive. It really creeps me out.</br>  <br>No. You're only supposed to watch it for the seiyuufagging.</br>  If MAL is wrong, What should I watch this season then?<br>I need guidance pls</br>  <br>It's certainly not attractive, it's just plain creepy</br>    <br>Everything /a/ hates because /a/'s taste is shit</br>  <br>Pro tip anon - don't come to /a/ for serious advice. Do the old /a/ recommended rule of 3 and go from there.</br>  <br>you watch everything because you're a manchild</br>  <br>Himouto is the only good anime this season.</br>  <br>I think everyone is considering Japan's abysmal taste.</br>  <br>Boku no Pico<br><br>You should just watch what you want to watch and stop letting other people's taste dictate your own.</br></br></br>  <br>Himouto is not the only good one</br>  <br>Is this ASMR?</br>  <br>Nice shit taste fam tbh.</br>  <br> just one guy shitting on Symphogear <br> everyone called out Japan for its shit taste </br></br>  <br>Fam? No idea what that means.<br>I can't help liking ushio to tora, because I'm obviously a complete pleb.</br></br>  <br>"Japan has shit taste" is becoming a self fulfilling prophecy.</br>  <br>English not your first language is</br>  <br>it's just plain creepiness</br>  <br>should be a picture of japan's landmass next to it in the dictionary</br>  <br>Well, yes</br>  <br>Himouto is /v/ tier shit</br>  <br>His post is understandable you faggot</br>  <br><br>Symphogear is garbage.</br></br>  <br>"/v/ tier shit" means nothing on /a/. Everything /a/ hates is /v/ tier shit.</br>  <br>Your post was /v/ tier shit</br>  <br>He didn't say nor imply that it was not understandable you faggot.</br>  <br>So is yours.</br>  <br>What about this one?</br>  <br>completely chigau</br>  <br>fgt</br>  <br>I wish jormungand would continue... but it ended well in both anime and manga so I guess its ok.</br>  <br>ago.</br>  I don't see the problem. I laugh at you guys all the time and I'm not even Nip.<br>Most of /a/'s taste is better than MAL and almost identical to Reddit but still laughably terrible.</br>  If there is one thing you could change about MAL, what would it be?<br>You may not say something like "I'll delete the website"</br>  <br> Kurayami Santa 5.94 <br><br>AOTS right here</br></br></br>  <br>But I like Chaos Dragon, I think their OP and ED are the best of the season...</br>  <br> Foreigners sure do love bomb victim anime wwwwwwwwwwwww <br>RIP</br></br>  <br>What the hell is wrong with you</br>  <br>Make them not have shit taste</br>  <br>The way the lists are made so something like Aria counts as 3 series or Pokemon as ~15 series instead of just one series.</br>  <br>Japan has the worst taste in girls.</br>  <br>How else will I pad my Completed score and enlarge my e-peen then?</br>  <br>Which implies you go to reddit thus making you loose all the non-existent credibilty you had in the first case.<br> 5/10 </br></br>  <br>*Gakko Gurashi</br>  <br>This, the top anime shouldn't be a list of Gintamas</br>  America is still laughing at Japan decades later.  <br>I'll never forget Pearl Harbor.</br>  <br>I didn't like the ending so much, the artist was told to wrap it up, goddamn it.</br>  <br>Just say you watched each recap episode.<br><br>Even better watch the 30 GB release of hundreds of short films from 1930-1960</br></br></br>  <br>You could just add shows that you haven't actually watched, if you only care about e-peen.<br>At least this way you at least have the option of having a proper listing system, in addition to doing what I said earlier and inflating your e-peen.</br></br>  <br> You may not say something like "I'll delete the website" <br><br>I'll delete the website</br></br></br>  <br>nobody fucking cares about how much you've completed, you can shitpost however you want, bud</br>  <br>I would delete the website.</br>  <br> 30GB release of hundreds of short films <br><br>Wait.

Gangsta has been a lot of fun so far.</br>  What kind of sex drive does a vampire loli have?  anal nymphomaniac.  irrumatio  <br>stake through her heart or decapitation</br>  <br>huh? anta baka?</br>   For a vampire, the act of feeding becomes highly sensual, regardless of his or her gender or sexual orientation. This applies to the victim as well. It is an extremely intimate experience, perhaps the most intimate experience either participant will ever experience. For the victim, a vampire's bite brings exquisite bodily pleasure, comparable to or even greater than the height of sexual release.   <br>at least post the pixiv file number or something bro</br>  <br><br>Wasn't the original Dracula kind of a pervert?

Can't they just live together in peace? If it feels so great, there should be plenty of humans begging for vampires to feed on them.</br>  <br>i read karin, it's fine</br>  <br>Because it's very easy to suck someone dry?<br><br>That and humans are nothing more than lower creatures. Why coexist when you can dominate and manipulate?</br></br></br>  <br>If you rule over humans with an iron fist, they're going to resent you and try to fight back.<br>If humans see you as an amazing orgasm provider and are fighting each other for the right to provide you blood, they're not going to be any kind of a threat to you.<br>Any smart person would try the latter instead of the former. It's much easier and safer.</br></br></br>  Blood and semen have a lot of the same properties.<br><br>In many ways, Vampires are just classier succubi.</br></br>  somebody post Mina please  <br>Machiavelli said it is best to be both Feared and Loved, but if you have to choose just one, always choose to be Feared.

Soon.  So, homos. 3 episodes of almost every show has aired, how does this season treats you?<br>What are you watching,  what are you watching for boys only,  and how do you like it?</br>  <br>I'm watching Akagami for the boys and solving problems with fantasy science.</br>  <br>I'm sorry if I sound like a newfag, but what are these threads? what do we post in them?</br>  Dayum.    <br>Oh, I'm now into this</br>  <br>Is it similar to Akatsuki no Yona?</br>  http://2emegymnopedie.blog77.fc2.co<wbr>m/blog-entry-486.html<br>Soon, yes.</br></wbr>  They say I should say this here<br><br>Rickert a handsome.</br></br>  <br>Other than red hair and cute boys, no. It's a relaxing fantasy setting with some mild drama, action and career advancement that sidesteps some of the more annoying elements of shoujo like endless misunderstandings and boring rivalry.</br>  Posting best tenkai<br><br><br><br>Haven't heard much about him lately is it because he's working on a game?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A fighting game apparently.</br>  Why is shota Grey so cute?  Reminder boys can't like other boys! I actually like the "if I were a grill" situations.  <br><br>Will it be on EVO next year?</br></br>  <br>Dropped a load of shows already, watching gangsta only for boys, also watching Akagami, Charlotte, Gakou Gurashi, Miss Monochrome, Non Non Biyori, Rokka and working.<br>Shit season for homo (game of Laplace is trash)</br></br>  <br> reading Fairy Shit </br>  <br>Source on this? Google images and iqdb gave me nothing</br>  <br>I started watching this raw a couple of days ago, in episode 13 now. I like the characters but the script could be better and the action parts get a bit boring though the 3DCG is fine. It's fun and the boys are cute but better director might be cool. Ceylan is the cutest also Guren feels somewhat unique MC for this kind of show since he's calm and good bye instead hotblooded idiot.<br><br>Also why is the most athletic boy a chubster</br></br></br>    <br>Not really. Main couple is set from the start and the development is natural, the 'rival' would prefer getting fucked by Zen and have a threesome than separating them, no misunderstandings or silly jealousy, cute boys, the development of Shirayuki's court herbalist career is interesting, Zen always respects Shirayuki's decisions and never tries to force her to anything  he apologized when he kissed her the first time because he didn't ask for permission and did it without warning .</br>  <br> you will never teach Hinata finishing moves </br>  <br><br>Yeah even children shows can be interesting to watch if it has a good director. Sadly this is only worth watching for the boys.</br></br>  <br>It's not a fighting game, it's a visual novel. It seems to have a few minigames in it, though.</br>  <br>The director is same as World Trigger's, I noticed the same blandness everywhere though I watched only the first episode of WT. It's a waste of nice characters because this show is bad at conveying emotion or pretty much anything, like the episode where Ceylan is about to move out and then it was all ruse.</br>  <br> you will never molest Momo </br>  Currently rewatching Ghost in the Shell SAC, the boys are delicious  Who's this fluid druid? I hope we see more of him  <br>I think it warrants saying men.</br>  <br>Fair enough</br>  How's Owari no Seraph? Does it have any homolust? And is it good?  <br>Bad, yes, no.</br>    Boy of the season.  <br>Ok thanks, I'll pass, it looks blands as hell</br>      <br>This season is like a bad dream. <br>At least there is still Soma</br></br>  <br>Where are people getting these previews anyway?</br>    <br>The website<br>http://www.classroom-crisis.com/sto<wbr>ry/</wbr></br></br>  <br> Klaus cooking <br><br>d'awww</br></br></br>  <br>The first episodes was good and had lots of shota's homolusting. The character design is cute, especially if you are into gakuran and military clothing. Later anime turns into shonen shit and waifu pandering, also characters start to act retarded. <br>It is 6/10, not good but I've seen much worse.</br></br>  <br>Sensei pleases old men for money</br>  Ive always wondered, why the picture of Mugen?  <br>Read the manga, the anime cranked up the hetero.</br>  <br>There will be lots of him. Also read the manga.</br>  <br>Because someone used to make recurring troll threads calling Mugen gay</br>  Chapter 15 of Birdmen was released a few days ago in case you missed it. I'm glad there are many of you enjoying it so far, but I feel I must let you know that  it only gets more hetero from here.   <br>Guren's relationship with his dad was pretty adorable.</br>  <br>I'll read the manga once the anime is over, luckily the first volumes are out in my country</br>  Apparently the reason why Levi and Erwin aren't in the live action SnK movie is because other Asians can't pronounce the "vu" in their names. What the actual fuck.   tfw can only enjoy toddler shows with child characters now <br>Is this how you reach perfection?</br>  <br>Why is Hide so perfect?</br>  <br>I don't like this season like I loved the previous one but I still has lots of show with cute guys that keep me entertained like<br>Akagami no Shirayuki-hime, Aoharu x Kikanjuu (I still hope it will turn out as good as Ouran did), Charlotte (for the MC),<br>Durarara!, Gangsta, Gatchaman Crowds S2, Game of Laplace (I had too high expectations for this one, so I'm disappointed), Working!!! (with more focus on other characters including boys that that red head). Also from previous season there are Ore Monogatari!, Shokugeki no Souma and  Kekkai Sensen. <br><br>I'm thinking about picking up Classroom Crisis for boys.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a fighting shounen, 90% of them are super-hetero. Not sure why anyone would expect different. The only consistently homo shounen genre is sports and all the best sport series are still hetero as fuck.</br>  Bisexuals boys are best boys.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/tumblr/</br>  <br>Because Captain was busy that day.</br>  <br> So, homos. 3 episodes of almost every show has aired, how does this season treats you? <br>It's one of the best seasons in a while.</br></br>  <br>Some people have hard-to-meet expectations.</br>  <br> innocent looking guys in BL revealing they've had experiences with girls before <br><br>I don't know why.</br></br></br>  <br>There's absolutely nothing wrong with hetero as long as it doesn't devolve into haremshit or trashy fanservice, which probably isn't the case.</br>  <br>Was the second episode as cringy as the first one?</br>  <br>It's a decent season so far, at least better than I expected. Nothing really stands out, but there are some fun or interesting shows.<br><br>The only thing I'm watching exclusively for the boys is Laplace, because it's pretty shitty every other aspect.<br>Actually, even the boys are shit, but at least some of them look good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's like the bro from harem anime but in a seinen.<br><br>Feels good when your favorite battle shounen is 98% homolust.</br></br></br>  <br>It was okay but senpai doesn't molest you</br>  <br><br>Amon &gt; Hide<br> tfw Fagayama is in top 5 of all TG characters polls while Amon isn't even in top 10 </br></br></br>  <br>Soma is great. Rinne's not bad either, though I don't watch it for the boys really.</br>  <br> Amon <br><br>Fuck that robot thug.</br></br></br>  <br> Amonfags </br>  I'm ready  <br>Overlord<br> Black clover </br></br>  <br>Genos looks a bit like Ramza.</br>  <br>Saitama doesn't give a shit<br>A SHIIIIT</br></br>  <br> reading fairy tail  <br>Who hurt you to end up like this</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Guren, Ceylan, and Toxsa are top tier<br><br>Chookie e shit</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who do you think will voice Bokuto?</br>  <br>Why is he so perfect?</br>  Why do the hot ones always leave us first?  <br>Yonaga.</br>  <br>Thank God for based Soma.</br>  <br>Don't even joke like that.</br>   checks whole thread <br> no mention of Arslan <br><br>Has everyone but me given up on Arslan already?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Never watched it in the first place because they removed the little brown boy.</br></br>  <br>I haven't, I'm just disappointed we got QUALITY and flying horses: the show.</br>  <br>Is Genos a homo?</br>  <br>Ono Yuki</br>  <br> friendly/athletic/white-haired bishonen/rival/aniki/cute animal theme/fixes worst girl/subtle ZR <br>It's almost too much.</br></br>  <br>No, I'm just waiting for Kaitou.</br>  <br> they removed the little brown boy. <br>Who? The only thing Arakawa and anime did was introduce Etoile earlier, rest is faithful to novels. There's plenty of brown boys<br><br>Who thought Liden was good for Tanaka x Arakawa adaptation</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dropped it because of shitty character's designs and I already watched Yona so I didn't care about another princess loosing her throne.</br>    <br> not being Amonfag </br>  <br>He cares a lot about his sensei.<br>Even if it's not reciprocated.</br></br>  <br>I fucking love tunics.</br>  <br>Wakabaryou de, Kimi to<br><br> buy shota doujinshi <br> no dicks getting shoved into little boy butts <br>What's even the point?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I know I should be watching for the man meat, but I am actually concerned about the quality of the drawn food.

I have to eat before/while watching it because I get so hungry.</br>  <br>That episode was so much better than episode 1</br>  <br>High Speed movie is going to make me use several pairs of socks.</br>  <br>Rokka, Charlotte, Classroom Crisis and Joukamachi for the guys only. The rest I picked up for other reasons. Overall I can't really complain.</br>  <br>This week's makura's design was a solid 8/10</br>  <br>What are they wearing?

Am I going to have to pick it up for this guy?</br>  <br>No, it's boys with scary eyes talk you to sleep aka Makura no Danshi.</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>  <br>I can't even remember their interactions in the manga. Have any idea what chapters they're in together?</br>  <br>33, 37, 49, 56, especially 59, 64. I think some people paired him off with Miyako at first, but then Seo's brother was introduced. I hope the mangaka has the balls to make them a proper pair, especially since they're getting merchandise together.</br>  <br><br>Well also that whole chapter about unknowingly texting eachother has yet to be revealed, so that's something to look forward to seeing. <br>Then it'd be really obvious where she would take it from there.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks. I'll half to reread.</br>  <br>They'll find out who they're texting when Nozaki finally understands Chiyo's love for him.

Takeo asks Suna if he likes him after.</br>  <br>rei no otoko<br>hen-ai</br></br>  <br>How rare to find someone doing the same thing. Last episode I saw was the Mizuki and Kumo flashback. The Christmas episode was also great.</br>  <br>Forgot to mention Suna doesn't confirm or deny after being silent.</br>    <br>Thank you.</br>  <br>Shit contribution to the thread. You must watch Fairy Tail.</br>  Dandelion has a surprisingly good husbando candidate.  <br> defending tumblr </br>  <br>He looks so generic.</br>  <br>Is that incest pandering shit?

At least two incests.</br>  <br>They didn't actually, they were just seriously upset that all the rival kings ust was just the director's doing and didn't have the writers' approval.</br>  <br>Good.

The sword penetration in the anime was more homoerotic to me?</br></br>  <br>Considering each of the "couples" has a running gag and the author has admitted to Mayu being Mikoshiba's counterpart (he was made male because Mikoshiba can't interact with females properly), this is highly likely.</br>  <br>I like Mikorin with Chiyo better.</br>  <br>They swapped  souls </br>  <br> Japan <br> doing canon gay in a modern shounen </br></br>  <br>But anon, incest is wrong!

I just agreed that the texting was probably going to end up as their running gag.</br>  <br>Not trash like prison shit, no</br>  <br>I meant to reply to someone further up the reply chain, sorry</br>  <br>But those boys are ugly shits.</br>  <br>The only relevance Munakata has in that picture is killing Mikoto. The last thing Mikoto 'sees' before dying is Tatara('s butterflies) while thinking about Anna's 'most beautiful red' line.

It was her decision and she seems satisfied with her choice.  <br> She wasn't forced to marry him <br>How do you know that?<br>She got pregnant of course she was forced.</br></br></br>  they are both shit now  <br>But Goku is an awful person and a worse husband.</br>  That's definitely not why she liked Gohan, though.   Talking shit about Chi Chi <br>bitch please</br>  <br>What are you talking about? She liked him because he had a pure heart and did his best to help those around him.<br><br>If all she wanted was some muscleman who goes around fighting people then she would have hooked up with one of them ages ago. Don't forget that her father runs a ring a the allegedly best human martial artists on earth.</br></br></br>  <br>Implying videl isn't just as bad now</br>  <br>Loli Chi-Chi is the best. Adult Chi-Chi is kind of a cunt, though.</br>  <br>She's fat.</br>  <br> Making your little girl to go around town dressed like that <br>Literally asking for it.</br></br>  <br>This. <br>OP is clearly an idiot, probably projecting his own feelings onto a cartoon character.</br></br>  <br>Gohan did like to fight though. She even caught him fighting criminals.<br>Gohan doesn't like fighting for his life, but he actually seemed kind of excited for the World Martial Arts tournament. He even looked forward to the training.<br>Gohan just wants to focus on his studies so he's cut down on the training, because any worthwhile training is something that takes All day apparently   Gohan had to take off school to train for the World Tournament  </br></br></br>  <br><br> This Chichi is absurd, the Old Chichi is absurd, the better Chichi is the one during the last tournament against Piccolo, and if she wanted more links with her husband, should should continue to fight instead to appear and old woman even if is more young than Bulma.</br></br>  <br>arent loli's meant to be chubby ?</br>  <br>I don't really think its right to say that he was genuinely excited about the tournament, he wasn't really excited about the tournament itself as much as just seeing his friends there.</br>  What if Gogeta SSJ4 is actually Super Saiyan God 4 Gogeta?<br><br> SSj4 / Basic Saiyan = Black Hair <br> Super Saiyan God = Red Hair <br> Super Saiyan God 4 =    Red Hair  </br></br></br></br>  <br>*And by Super Saiyan God 4 i mean Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan 4</br>  <br>Why did his hair turn red, anyway?</br>  <br>Thats what this theory is based on, Anon. We've got no answer.<br><br>This one would be an answer.</br></br></br>  <br>I really hate what Toriyama did to her character. I really would have liked to see her keep up with her fighting/training in her Dojo. I don't care about strength specifically but I really liked her tomboyish attitude. Now she's just a bland, no personality generic housewife and I really don't like it.<br><br>It's similar to how I feel about 18 being shafted in the Revival of F movie with such a sad excuse for why she didn't get to fight even though she's way stronger than Krillin.<br><br>Toriyama is just shit with female characters in general, they either just get shafted and sidelined or forgotten entirely (Sorry Launch).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Now she's just a bland, no personality generic housewife and I really don't like it. <br><br>You really don't know women. Every time you hear women being professional or careerists and such? That is all an act. Because all women want to be wives. Being wives is THE retirement package for a twat.<br><br>After she's a wife she has gained a sucker/slave to provide for her so the mask comes off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You sound like you have issues dude.<br><br>Maybe you should see a therapist, seriously, talk to a professional about your girl issues.</br></br></br>  <br>But she's the one treating nerd Gohan like her personal fucktoy.</br>  What if Videl and Gohan were having sex and when he came he accidentally released a kamehameha wave from his dick?  When you think about it, Gohan was the polar opposite of Videl's father. Her father was arrogant and prideful, he took credits for the achievements of other and was an all-around attention whore. On the other hand Gohan saved the world but didn't bring any attention to it. He fought crime but preferred to do it anonymously while living as an average guy. Considering that Videl hated her father it's no surprise that Gohan had qualities that interested her.  <br> After she's a wife she has gained a sucker/slave to provide for her so the mask comes off <br>Videl is the breadwinner though. Gohan is living of Videl's fortune</br></br>  <br>That doesn't even make sense.</br>  Why do people like the Artificial Human arc so much?  Goku should have ended up with Bulma  <br>Goku fired a kamehameha wave from his feet.<br>I don't see why it doesn't make sense that Gohan could make one with his dick.</br></br>  <br>Because shit like Terminator 2 was popular then.</br>  <br>Toriyama's editor was the president of the Goku/Bulma fanclub and even support Toriyama when he decided to let Goku grow up but Toriyama trolled him</br>  <br>So, I have that guy to blame for taking my fun adventure and turning it into power levels?</br>  <br>Torishima? He was opposed to the idea of Goku growing up, and then Toriyama warned him that he wouldn't continue the story if Goku couldn't become an adult.</br>  <br>I read it was Shueisha's big guys the ones against Goku growing up but Toriyama's editor supported the idea for having a Bulma end. Apparently, he liked romance and he always pushed it on shounen titles</br>  <br> as much as just seeing his friends there. <br><br>I just realized that most of Gohans friends are just Goku's friends.<br><br>Poor guy only had Dende (and this little dude was also constantly busy being Kamisama) until he went to highschool and met Videl and the other two whattheirfaces, Pencil and Ereaser?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Projecting thia much <br><br>Anon, I think you have a problem.<br><br>Also, It's Videl the one who's providing Gohan.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Toriyama is just shit with female characters in general, they either just get shafted and sidelined or forgotten entirely (Sorry Launch). <br><br><br>No one can be as worse as Masashi "Hack" Kishimoto</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, god form is weak to be comparable to ssj 4.</br>  <br>If we are talking animal instinct level kinda shit then you've got a point anon.<br>Chi Chi as an example. Women instinctively try to get the best genes for their children and try to insure that they survive to make grand children.<br>She married and had kids with the most powerful man in the world who took out Frezia and Buu. Given how powerful Gohan is with how he handled Cell she has techially done her job from a nature standpoint<br>When it comes to Videl she's got Gohan who is probably one of the strongest people on the planet. Once she has kids with him he'll probably want to stick around due to how shit of a father Goku was to him.</br></br></br></br>  <br>SSJ4 got cut by falling glass in GT</br>  <br>Krilin and the rest of the gang are like Gohan's cool uncles while Piccolo is his non-shit dad.</br>  <br>That's not the point. You can't just accidentally Kamehameha.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Fkb<wbr>xNypK6ds</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Man I love this OP but 0:13 bothers me more than it should<br><br>GOKU of all people just had a heartwarming and memorable bonding moment with his son, and Chichi bitches him out for it.

The only thing that's stopping them from writing a new plot device that boosts the rest of the fighters up is Toriyama.<br><br>Remember that brief moment in time when Piccolo was the strongest Z-fighter? I miss that. The rest of the Z-fighters don't need to be the one to defeat the Big bad but they at least need to feel like they're not useless, and at this point everyone except Goku and Vegeta sure as hell feels that way.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There should be no problem for Buu to replace the others as battle support, Piccolo could fuse with another nigger to become supporting cast, 18 is good housewife so she will not come to fight.

He'd have to be both a time traveller and an SSJ to be the one in the legend. Which he wasn't.

He also designed that story's version of the Tuffles and Freeza's ancestor.<br><br>The Dragonball 30th anniversary site's timeline considers Bardock being thrown to the past manga canon.</br></br></br>  <br>I will fight you.<br><br>Broly is the best movie villain, and could have easily been best villain overall if they bothered giving him any character.</br></br></br>  <br> It wasn't made by Tori neither did he had any say in it. <br>Are you really going to take seriously the statement of a man who barely remember what his characters are supposed to work?<br>The SSJG was bullshit, but okay I can take it. But that Vegeta and Goku could transform at will without the help of the other saiyans just because they were training is bullshit, the epitome of power levels' bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> Would you like Trunks x Pan? <br>Fuck that, from all the DBZfags that's what I hate most.<br> I'll take ToraMai, it's cute enough. <br>The only decent thought Toriyama has had.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself. Broly was easily the worst movie villain, cause his bullshit legendary SSJ thing shat all over the accomplishments of the main cast by saying they weren't "real" super saiyans.</br>  <br> Broly is the best movie villain <br>The best villain is Cooler. Also the best DBZ movie is the return of cooler. All characters are useful in their own way AND for once Goku doesn't save the world by himself.</br></br>  <br>Shitty headcanon time.<br><br>They're probably been living off Chichi's dowry. And Chichi probably has a lot of sisters/maybe some brothers. Makes sense that she's not the heir to the Ox King. But instead his favourite.<br><br>Ox King probably left his castle and shit to his eldest, and went off to hang out in the woods with his favourite daughter and favourite son-in-law.<br><br>It's probably a shameful display to ask her sisters for money, so Chichi wants Goku to work instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it's probably one of the better DBZ arcs. I honestly feel like Android arc and Cell arc should have been more seperated because the androids were such enjoyable villains on their own without a giant bug lizard going around drinking people. That whole story just felt kinda...cluttered.</br>  <br><br>tfw parents were exactly the opposite.<br><br>I guess gender is also a factor...<br><br> Mum's favourite child is the girl, dad's favourite is the boy. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ox King and Gohan are basically Krillin and Goku. <br> You'll never get to see them train together. <br> You'll never get to see a 50 years younger Roshi teaching his first students. </br></br></br>  <br>Let's be honest. Mai has been mentally a 12 year old since she was introduced.</br>  <br>Nah, it fits into the 'you changed the past but something even MORE fucked happened' this is Future Trunk's existence.<br><br>And you need a bigger threat to redeem 18 -- it's how Toriyama does redemption arcs. See: Vegeta and Frieza, Buu and Kid Buu.</br></br></br>  <br> Because it's probably one of the better DBZ arcs. <br>Freezer was DBZ's greatest villain, the androids were interesting villains, The Great Saiyaman was a funny arc and the end of Buu's arc was memorable.</br></br>  <br>Sayiaman was the Slice of Life arc. Buu was the funny arc for most of it.</br>  <br> Cooler <br> Not Garlic jr. <br>Although I'm pretty biased just cuz he looks very "dragon ball"-y.</br></br></br>  <br>That whole final part of DBZ was a breath of Fresh Air. Cell Saga kinda dragged on and after Tenshinhan stalls Cell it kinda hammers the point home that the humans aren't useful for much more than recon.<br>Buu Saga as a whole just didn't seem to take itself too seriously so I just never really felt dragged down reading it.</br></br>  <br>I think Xenoverse implies that the Supreme Kai of Time shot him back 1000 years to save his life because she has the hots for him. Whether that's considered canon, or part of any canon worth talking about, is debatable.<br><br>Of course that makes Bardock a pretty shitty person, having nearly killed his people twice, as well as the original inhabitants of planet Vegeta.</br></br></br>  <br> Faulconer  <br>Vastly overrated soundtrack that has piss poor editing (tracks just cut in and out constantly everytime a character opens their mouth) and quite often plays when it is inappropriate due to a lack of silent moments. Discards all of the unique wuxia atmosphere of the original soundtrack for a shallow "hardcore action" atmosphere.<br><br> non grandma Goku voice <br>A voice role that was never correctly portrayed until Kai was dubbed 10 years later, that went through several revisions out of order, making the character sound very inconsistent. Also is overrated due to dubfags' irrational hatred of the true voice of Goku in the original language (that Toriyama himself picked and said was "inseperable" from the character) that they invent reasons why the original is bad and the dub is better like "hurr grandma voice" or "hurr not manly enough".<br><br>Meanwhile, dubfags turn a blind eye to the countless scripting issues of the DBZ dub, caused by a mixture of bad translations and a meddling executive. Often, they even spurn the more accurate and better produced Kai dub (which is a good dub of a flawed product that lacks the cohesiveness to DB in the soundtrack and the voice acting that DBZ had).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You really want to deny Trunks this piece of ass?<br>You really want to deny Mai a life of comfort after all the shit she has been trough?</br></br>  <br>But we know that when Mai grows up she probably won't look like this anymore since none of Toriyama's girls look as nice anymore.</br>  <br>holy shit man take a chill pill</br>  <br> Trunks x Pan <br>Nigga those are GTfags, Pan is too fucking young for Trunks either way.</br></br>  <br>DBZ's original english dub was a mess. I've quickly taken a liking to Nozawa's voice. I think it captures the childlike and more hickish nature Goku has that none of his voice actors really try to get. Sean has a decent goku when he's being laid back but he should really add in a bit more of a flair with some "Ain't" or "Yo"s in his speach to kinda sell Goku's way of speaking.</br>  I will never understand how it is possible for americans to like that censored piece of shit with that stupid soundtrack and that forced action hero voice  <br> forced action hero voice </br>  <br><br>Not in my experience. The first kid is the practice baby from the mother's point of view and the protégé from the father's point of view. It always goes: <br><br> First kid is father's favourite. His heir. Is expected to take life lessons to the face and become successful on his own. <br> Second kid is mother's favourite. Her baby. Lessons learned from the first born are applied and kid is supported more significantly. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sorry, forgot to mention the also forced action villain voice <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LPU<wbr>vkfZiN9k</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Gohan goes SSJ2 <br> Couldn't even touch him <br><br>Is he as strong as a Super Saiyan 3?</br></br></br></br>  <br> That speech <br>Did you niggers really needed Goku to be Superman?</br></br>  <br> All of them competed in the 22/23 tournament. <br><br>and Tien was the only one who ever won and that was over 20 years ago AND he beat a kid</br></br></br>  <br>No he didn't.</br>  <br>Americans have a love/hate relationship with chinese cartoons.

Only their full-breed monkey fathers enjoy spending all their time fighting and training, the kids only care when lives are in danger.</br></br></br>  <br>I gotta ask, I know Americans had a dub that fucked the scrip, so in the American dub never shows Gohan not liking fights, being a crybaby?<br><br>I mean, all murricans act like something was stolen for him and that being a nerd is out of character for him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>That 1999 Funimation didn't know what they were doing.<br><br>Post 2010 Funimation on the other hand, does a much better job here:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=75g<wbr>UJ_4SyY0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All hail the spanish dub.

They want him to surpass him in terms of wanting to fight when he is a natural pacifist.<br><br><br>The main problem is that most American DBZfags started watching during the Namek arc. They missed the Saiyan arc when Gohan was kidnapped, crying, and was scared to fight.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I think they're geeks so they project on Gohan and see Goku as their father. That's why Gohanfags fucking hate Goku and blame him for Gohan's "mediocre" life, just like they blame daddy for their own fuck ups</br></br>  <br>Even on Namek Gohan was hesitant and basically needed Someone to hold his hand every step of the way.</br>  Pan is 1/4 Saiyan and not related to Vegeta. So technically, she could mate with Vegeta to make a 3/4 saiyan kid, right? Goku could also mate with any daughters that Vegeta and Bulma produce in the future.<br><br>The saiyan race must be repopulated.</br></br>  <br>well that was acceptable at least<br>it doesn't excuse the stupid soundtrack though</br></br>  <br>Goku see himself like a human rather than a saiyan and if Vegeta was interested in repopulate his dying race, he'd rape countless women a long time ago. Hell, even Nappa proposed to mate with human females for creating strong offsprings like Gohan but Vegeta wasn't interested.</br>  <br>Nah, Vegeta and Goku only care for punching each other.<br>Also I bet Goten will get with Maron and Tunks already has Mai, Pan probably will fuck Uub.<br>The saiyans are no more.</br></br></br>  <br>5/8 saiyan.</br>  <br>The soundtrack was unchanged from the japanese version you idiot</br>  Can we all just agree Chi Chi is the prettiest Dragon Ball  <br> americans are so obsessed with defending their dub they haven't even heard the OST of DB <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hjv<wbr>e9s90DRU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>It may just be because I'm older but Chi-chi in super does things to my dick.</br>  <br>That's the same song they used in the original Kai numbnuts</br>  <br> Kai <br> original </br></br>  <br> kai  <br> original </br></br>  <br> so obsessed with american dubs that he doesn't even know the kai soundtrack was untouched </br>  <br>But no one said original.

She's the daughter of like...the two strongest humans.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I totally agree with this.</br>  <br>You think she fucked SSJ Goku at least once?</br>  <br> 18 <br> strongest woman in the world (and likely universe <br><br>Not since FemWhis showed up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Frieza is probably a girl.</br>  <br> He's credited as overseen the manga version <br>That was a mistranslation by a shitty scanlator, it was supposed to credit him for having made Dragonball in the first place.</br></br>  <br>She would have to have fucked SSJ Goku when Goten was conceived, since the only time they would have had time to fuck would've been after his training at the time chamber with Gohan, and they were both SSJ those couple of days as part of their training.<br><br>  Goten could have also been Gohan's son if you catch my drift </br></br></br>  When are people going to stop bitching about Kaiosama's jap VA?<br>Nobody ever complains about the narrator or Babidi's voice, but suddenly he voices a quiet character in a quiet way and he's shit</br>  <br>Isn't he Roshi and Dr. Brief too?</br>  All this Chi-chi talk made me feel like drawing her.  <br>Put Goku's dick in her mouth.</br>  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>No, you dumbass.</br>  <br>Actually, yes, he is.</br>  <br>Yanami has never played Kame Sennin, you dumb shit.</br>  <br> My first doujin fap was about her </br>  <br>I tried.<br> http://i.imgur.com/CujQNvU.png </br></br>  <br>Well done m8.</br>  <br>He did in Dragon Ball</br>  <br>No he didn't. Kohei Miyauchi played Kame Sennin from his debut until his death in the late Buu arc.</br>  <br>Explain.</br>  Short hair and GT Videl is fucking shit<br><br>Twin tails Videl is Ubermensch master race</br></br>  Do we really need to debate who is best girl?  <br>Because the personalities of 17 and 18 were awesome. Also, they were the careless overpowered teens that most of us wished we could be.</br>  <br>Fucking no your power level would be like twenty at best. Which is gutter-shit tier.</br>   I'll take some pride in the fact that it took Beerus the Destroyer to kill me! <br><br>...And Buu. And Cell. And Zarbon. And Frieza, who actually did kill you.</br></br>  <br>Well the dragonballs weren't going to exist after Beerus was done with Vegeta so it was a fact.</br>  <br>Oh, and himself, since he committed suicide.</br>  <br>BECAUSE YOU GOT GOHAN YOU LUCKY NIGGER</br>  <br> Makafushigi Adventure <br>My nigga.<br><br><br>Fuck off dubfag.</br></br></br></br></br>   mfw no one ever brings up We Gotta Power as the best OP <br><br>I know it's not as iconic as the others, but it'll always be my favorite.</br></br>  <br>Cell and Zarbon never killed vegeta m8</br>  <br>They couldve, easily.</br>  <br>Zarbon left him for dead and Vegeta only survived because Freeza wanted him to. Cell just couldn't be fucked to waste time killing him.</br>  <br>Neither did Buu, Vegeta Allahu akbar himself.</br>  <br>Is Beerus in the game? I want Beerus.</br>  <br><br>Cmon guys think DBZ is all about letting characters live long enough for them to be strong enough to kill you.<br><br>It happens to multiple characters in just about every arc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are Dragon Ball characters in this? Z is kind of lame in comparison.</br>  <br>Yeah, as an adult finally reached the stage where I can understand the adult reasons she had to act the way she did. Fearful New Mother Syndrome and etc. <br><br>I still wish DB era Chichi shined through a little more in her though.</br></br></br>  <br> thinking Dragonball and Deebeezee are different franchises <br>Murrica pls</br></br>  <br>Everyone knows which is superior though.<br><br><br>Protip: it is dragonball.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know that the Dragon Ball and Z distinction exist in Japan too as far the anime are concerned. It's a pretty usual distinction when you consider how different the two are. Almost everthing about Dragon Ball is better, even down to the art and animation.</br>  <br>Videl's new hair is the worst thing to happen to the franchise</br>  <br> as far the anime are concerned <br>And the anime is never considered "the franchise" in Japan. You see the logos used on merchandise and video games and shit, but the franchise itself is always referred to and discussed as "Dragonball". No one in Japan considers "DBZ" a separate thing.</br></br>  <br>And yet Bandai and Toei treat it that way for licensing purposes when it comes to merchandise like video games, for instance. If the distinction didn't exist, this would be done.</br>  <br>Z's music is better</br>  <br>Nah, I prefer DB's music too.</br>  <br>wouldn't* be done</br>  <br>But Z's is better.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=QRI<wbr>4NGXvxLA</wbr>  [ ]<br> Though Kai's is the best </br></br></br>  When will people realize that almost every "childish" thing Goku ever did as an adult was made up by Toei? In the manga Goku is mature and intelligent.  <br> You see the logos used on merchandise and video games and shit </br>  <br>They did that for Kai too. It's just the logo related to what they're selling.</br>  <br><br>Here's a simple example that you should be able to understand. The Pokemon franchise is collectively known as Pokemon in the US. But, within in that there are different series. For the anime, you have different subtitles that correspond to different locations and stories. The distinction between Dragon Ball, Z, and  GT  is the same. That's why when a game follows kid Goku and his adventures, it's labeled as Dragon Ball. If it follows adult Goku and company, it's labeled as Dragon Ball Z.Get it?</br></br>  <br>The DS RPG adapting the Saiyan arc was called "Draognball Kai" in Japan, even though it had a bunch of shit from Z filler and even fucking Broli in it. Various figure lines released at the time were also branded "Dragonball Kai", including those featuring movie villains.<br><br>When Kai was the new and hip thing, the "Dragonball Z" logo was completely retired in Japan and all merchandise relating to shit between Raditz and Boo was branded as "Dragonball Kai" merchandise.<br><br>That's how it worked. That's how it still works. "Dragonball Z" is purely a merchandise brand in Japan, the franchise itself is always called just Dragonball and the post-Raditz stuff is never treated as a separate series outside of merchandising.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Dragonball Z" logo was completely retired in Japan <br>No it wasn't.</br></br>  <br>WAS, you retard, not IS. They brought it back once Kai flopped.</br>  <br> Kai flopped </br>  <br>Kai flopped like a motherfucker. How new are you?</br>  <br>Full Power SSJ maybe.</br>  <br><br> Trunks and Mai as a thing <br>I love Mai but FUCK NO! I want him to fuck Pan because Saiyan eugenics.</br></br></br>  <br>no, she is the reason men cheat. Just look at her.</br>  <br>Goku is the worse husband, thank god she was spared that fate.</br>  <br> She likes Gohan because he was the cool fighter who defeated Cell <br>But she was totally head over heals for his dorky personality as well. Don't make her sound so shallow.</br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>18 is a cute.</br>  <br> It's similar to how I feel about 18 being shafted in the Revival of F movie with such a sad excuse for why she didn't get to fight even though she's way stronger than Krillin. <br><br>What was the excuse? I thought they just forgot to put her in the movie.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think you mean characters in general not named Goku or Vegeta.</br></br>  <br><br> You can't manually recreate that kind of impact. <br><br>You can't? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/unAIS4hBOWE  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying post cell wasn't written mostly by toriyama's editors </br>    <br>His original child design was pretty cute.</br>  <br>I want Chi-chi to act and talk more like a hick. I mean she's basically had the same middle of nowhere fight crazy upbringing Goku had. I think it'd be fun to see her with a looser grip of social conventions like Goku and Krillin have.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out.<br><br>Worst ship ever. <br><br>It took 15 years to gain a proper following too and GTPan is a shit.<br><br>Hell, both her and GTTrunks is shit as well.<br><br><br>ToraMai is the new trendy thing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Those lyrics <br> That imagery  <br><br>I watched the entirety of Dragonball to the end of Z over the last few months in preparation for Super. <br><br>When I saw this ED I teared up a little bit and had to just sit there for a moment. <br><br>That dumb little kid grew up to be a pretty cool guy, dammit. <br><br>  Now if only he would stop abandoning his family at every opportunity/ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not canon, though.<br><br>Everytime Toei just want to do their own thing, Toriyama contradicts him.<br><br>In tge BoG origial plot, the reason as of why the Saiyan were ruthless, was because of a virus and not their upbringing (And that it was Proto-Beerus' fault).<br><br>Toriyama changed that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What the hell is this bullcrap? Dinosaurs are still alive in Dragonball.  <br> toriyama forgot </br>  <br>Actually no, Videl fell for Gohan well before learning that he was "the golden fighter". She knew what she was getting into, also supposedly a lot of Gohan's research is on the subject of ki, so he's still very much a fighting freak, just a book ned variation.</br>  The other thread is nearing the bump limit, so I guess this will be the livewatch thread.<br>Episode 3 airs in exactly 1 hour from now. <br><br>Everyone is alright anon, everything will be  diejobu </br></br></br>  It airs on TV Tokyo right?  <br>Die好き!</br>  <br> 1 hour from now </br>  <br>The manga art seems nice.

Why would they change that anyway? It's the big reveal of vol. 1.</br></br>  <br>Already dead</br>  <br>Will they kill the dog today ?<br>I hope they change some part of OP again.</br></br>  <br><br>I think he meant "is she a zombie or dead?"</br></br>  <br>Well the grave on the roof has her hair ribbon on it, so I think they already killed her in the anime (unless it's an empty grave)</br>  <br>It has that ribbon from the first time it appears in the manga, too<br>It's WAY too shallow to be anything but a symbolic grave anyway</br></br>  <br>Oh, I didn't notice it in the manga. She is probably in the basement then</br>  <br>So are you exited or annoyed?<br><br><br>Found it weird how Kurumi screamed when she killed the zombie last episode.

Last week it didn't for me but one in the links beneath worked, yet everybody was in the connectcast chat. What gives?</br>  <br>I had the same problem, dunno why.</br>  <br>get in linux</br>  <br>another channel i dont even know, and nothing even works on this shit cc</br>  So when will shovel-chan get bit  by Zombie Megu-nee  and had to be put down?  <br>connectcast.tv/linux2ink</br>  <br>Maybe it isn't</br>  <br>thanks</br>  What channel is it on BETV?  <br>It says it is offline<br>What the hell?</br></br>    <br>+1</br>  <br>Really, faggot? I never even heard of this channel and found in in 5 seconds using what was said in this thread and google. Why spoonfeed retards that can't even do that?</br>  <br>It's not</br>  <br>Thanks fag now its gonna go offline</br>  <br>It doesn't work like that, faggot</br>  All this Megu-nee is bad for my heart.  So this is just gonna be a fucking flashback episode, huh? Guess we'll have to wait for next week for the bathroom scene.    <br>I don't understand <br>I keep refreshing it but it just says the channel is currently offline.</br></br>   Anime original content <br><br>For what purpose<br>How far is this adaption going to reach</br></br></br>    <br>Should have really expected that when it's titled "Back Then" or whatever.</br>  <br>Thank you based spoonfeeder</br>   megu-nee episode <br>What a waste of ep3. They should have delivered the exciting parts as soon as possible.<br>That's why it will fail.</br></br>    <br> Complaining about the anime expanding on canon </br>  <br>Some channels are fucked up like that, no idea why. Maybe it limit viewers.</br>  Oh snap it's this moment  All that blur.  Did the bathroom scene not happen?    <br>They better still do graduation. I'm fine with anime original content, but not at the expense of the best manga scenes. <br><br>They'll still have room if they cut out the mall, but I'm starting to think that between the Kurumi being bit arc, whatever they're gonna do with the dog, and a potential mall flashback they won't have room for helicopter of graduation.</br></br></br>    <br>This episode is just a flashback to z-day told from Megu-nee's perspective. Expect bathroom next week.</br>  rip stream  <br>It's not entirely anime original though, is it? I mean they didn't show anything in the manga, but I remember a few lines about when this happened.</br>  <br><br>Thus it came to pass.</br></br>  <br>That was just the first half though. Bathroom might be in the second half, would make sense to make the first part Megu-nee centered.</br>    <br>This ep is chapter 4 + a flashback to the outbreak it seems. It kinda fits though. They're expanding a lot on Megu-nee's character for next episode, at this pace though they won't make it to graduation for sure.</br>  Rip GG.<br>The anime will fail hard. Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3.</br>  Fuck this shit.  <br>Who would kill the stream. CC allows anime, only thing that could happen is this thread could be deleted for advertising/</br>  that bedroom eyes  <br> Because they didn't deliver that basement arc in ep 3. <br>You want them to adapt the basement arc now? That wouldn't fit at all with the pacing and would be sorely out of place without developing all the characters first.</br></br>  Screen getting distorted big time.  Are we going to do this every single episode?<br><br> WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH </br></br>  gay  <br>It's your delusions breaking.<br>The stream never existed.</br></br>  <br>Is this your first day on /a/ faggot?</br>  Wasn't a terrible episode, but was kinda lackluster. I appreciate the expanded setting though.  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  <br>so yuriii!</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH   Kei in the preview <br>wat</br>  WHY ISN'T THIS EXACTLY LIKE THE MANGA WAAAH  Next week is fucking Kei.<br>They're not gonna show the bathroom scene till episode 6 at this fucking rate.<br><br>GG GG</br></br></br>    <br>The viewers wanted to see it delivered in this ep.<br>It doesn't sell as is so they needed to do something about it.<br>Now many people will just drop it and bam it will fail the sales.</br></br></br>  They really want this series to flop, don't they?  The first half was extremely boring and unnecessary. Why even cut out plot parts if you're replace them with this shit.<br>At least we got a bloody shovel this time, I guess.</br>  <br>MIKI A BEST</br>  It was alright. I think I've become too accustomed to episode 3 of any given manga being the episode where they drop the hammer.<br><br>It's pretty clear they did this episode to make it  seem like Megu-nee is actually alive.  If they did the twist this episode, it wouldn't have as much impact for anime-only watchers as it would now.<br><br>KEI NEXT EPISODE (wait, what)</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're retarded</br>  <br>Still best girl</br>  <br> no neet comments about the zombie apocalypse flying through the screen </br>  <br> any given manga <br><br>Anime, obviously. Are we actually getting the mall episode next week? Flashbacks on top of flashbacks would be a bit too much I think.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's see anon<br>Be sure to be here when the sales data is released</br></br>  SHUT THE FUCK UP FAGGOTS, Gakkou is still AOTS stop hating on new things that develop the setting more  Bathroom + Kei flashback next episode.<br><br>Mark my words.</br></br>  <br>That's Youtube.</br>    <br>There may not be mall anymore.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> getting this buttflustered that manga fans are comparing the adaptation to the source material <br>Go back to reddit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you fuck off back to MAL or whatever</br>  <br>Seems like too much for a single episode. I have no idea how they're planning on going with the show at this pace. I don't dislike it though, in fact I thought animating the rooftop scene was very nice.</br>  <br>Thank you anon!</br>  The last scene had Megunee writing in the basement. Must find it earlier in this adaptation.<br><br>They're shuffling things around enough that mangafags won't be bored with a straight adaptation at least.</br></br>  <br>"It's different, therefore bad." is not a criticism that should ever be entertained.</br>  <br>Anime original end, the heli gonna rescue them.</br>  <br>It should just have followed the manga<br>It's always like this when they mess with something just werks and fuck up it hard.<br>You knoe no one gives a fuck about megu-nee or her relationships with her students<br>People were in it for the suffering and it didn't deliver it at ep 3.<br>Also they fucked up Kurumi's character quite a bit by making her butchering the senpai just like that.<br>What a disappointment.<br><br>FUCKING DROPPED</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So It's confirmed that before the outbreak happened, Yuki was bullied and depressed. Adds a lot more weight to some things in the manga such as Yuki commenting how bullies are bad.<br><br>I'm calling it right here, Yuki will be the one to save the school life club by using past rage/stress from bullying after seeing the uni girls/bikers 'bully' the club, drawing first human blood.</br></br>  So are thy gonna just skip Miki's character arc? I know she isn't the most relevant one of the main four but still, she's a cute character.  <br>Well, if the scene with Megu writing in the basement was based on this moment here, then bathroom is pretty much right after that.</br>  <br> this entire post </br>  At least we know now how sempai got into the roof with them.<br><br>If it was a 1:1 adaptation we'd never know.<br><br>Think about that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe there is a small change that this will be one of those split cours. They usually don't announce this from the very beginning. I don't know how much manga material there is, though.</br>  <br>No one is bored watching the shit even if it's 1:1 adaptation source material.<br>It's like you don't know anything about the animefags</br></br>  <br>If my opinion as a mangafag was relevant for the author, I'd have prefered to be a straight adaptation considering wha he has done so far. I don't know he thinks what he has done so far was a good idea, but hopefully the sale will give him a hint.</br>  <br>Did you even watch the fucking preview?</br>  <br>Maybe because this isn't a straight adaptation we'll find out how Megu-nee got infected.</br>  <br>You mean the sales of the manga that have more than doubled after an almost entirely anime original first episode?<br><br>Yeah, maybe that was a big hint for him.</br></br></br>  All the changes aren't all that bad. I just hope they don't fuck up pic related.  <br>No, the anime sales.</br>  <br>I don't come from anywhere else though anon.<br><br>People haven't been saying it's bad because it's different though. You sound like one of those retards that think any criticism is shitting on something</br></br></br>  <br>You know that the anime sales are barely relevant so long as the manga gets a big boost (which it has), right?</br>  <br>Yes it is. Changes are always bad and should never be accepted.</br>  If this anime aired 10-12 years ago then people would like the changes, because of the novelty it delivers I think but now it is no more the case.<br>The changes are triggering the people.<br>And tbh they are a bit not good...</br></br>  <br>I'm aware, but I can see how this is going to be irrelevant to the nips as soon as the anime ends, and therefore the manga sales will come back to usual.</br>  <br> And tbh they are a bit not good... <br>Is English your first language?</br></br>  <br> tbh <br>Nice meme.</br></br>   I don't really like the small changes they put into the anime but it is still watchable. The manga is still better but I'd continue to watch the anime nonetheless because I got nothing else better to do; just an opinion of mine. <br><br>Any changes to the opening? I missed it.</br></br>  <br>Disgusting mangafag.</br>  <br>It could also be that the anime will sell good. You usually don't see high pre-order numbers during the first weeks unless it is some really big hype like Fate stuff or something. Barely anybody even knew GG before so it will take a time until people start consider buying this and they'll probably wait anyway to see how well the adaption works. Maybe it will rise when the important/suffer scenes will happen in the upcoming episodes.</br>  muh subs when?  <br>Well it wasn't Taroumaru since they still have him.</br>  <br>There'll be about 40 chapters out when the anime ends, but the best stopping point is in chapter 30, so we'd need a snail's pace and lots of original content to adapt less than 2 chapters per episode for it to last that long. Which is exactly what is happening right now, so you might be on to something.<br><br> split cour <br> second half airs in winter <br> ends at graduation <br> by that time there's almost enough material out for another cour <br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As far as I see barely anyone even complains about the changes themselves. Most anons only fear the shortness of the anime (one cours) and that they won't be able to adapt the important stuff that happens later.</br>  <br>I'm not saying it won't sell well, it's just that it won't be a big deal if/when it doesn't because it's already a success at what it was made for.<br><br>It's not as if it's an anime original that's relying on anime sales.</br></br></br>  <br>Reason for spoiler tag.</br>  <br>There's much more animefags than mangafags.<br><br>Deal with it.</br></br></br>  <br>7am PDT</br>  <br>The sales won't go back to "normal", people who bought 6 volumes won't stop there just because the anime is over.</br>  <br>They'll have to deal with Zombiemaru now that Megu-nee isn't alive when he turns.</br>  I don't get why people hate the changes.<br>Why would I want to see the exact same thing I already read? It's not like seeing it animated will make the story any better. In fact, considering the animation, it would only make the anime guaranteed to be worse than the manga. At least, even if it turns out worse than the managa, you won't be bored seeing the exact same thing you already read.</br>  Doujin of cute girls raped by zombies before getting eaten when?  <br><br>I wonder if the author left some bits out expecting it to become an anime at some point.

Actual gore.<br><br><br>It's literally being written by the mangaka.

Hopefully it works out.</br></br>  <br>They want to keep her from PTSD a little more</br>  I don't know why some people think there won't be a graduation, it's the perfect stopping point even if they're not thinking in producing a 2nd cour/season.<br><br>They might shorten some stuff before but there's no way they won't be ending the anime with that.</br></br>  <br>This, just look at that fucking hack of George Lucas.</br>  <br><br>That's why they have editors.</br></br>  <br><br> People hate changes when they're for the worse <br>No, they hate it when it changes or removes the scenes they were waiting for, regardless of how the actual changes were made. Not saying it isn't a legit reason to be upset, just that the quality of the new content doesn't factor into it.<br><br> Kurumi's "good night" to the zombie <br>The only new content that bothered me, besides Miki being there from the start. Everything else is fitting in well, and today's was a solid exposition and build-up episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> skipping all the blood and gore <br>Shouldn't you be shitposting in a GATE thread?</br></br>  Someone pointed it out above, but I don't think people got the message. The anime needs a good stopping point, and the only good one is chapter 30.<br><br>It may seem like that's a lot of chapters to adapt, but the manga is actually surprisingly sparse in serious plot content between chapter 1 and 30, certainly not enough for a properly paced 1:1 adaptation over 12-13 episodes. For example, the entire Mall arc is 6 chapters, but can easily be done in a single episode.<br><br>So, you either get anime original content or a 1:1 at a snail's pace. I'd much rather have the former.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lolwut?</br>  <br> Lolwut? <br>Go back to the shithole you came from.</br></br>  <br> I am so dense, I can't understand how scared she is even though she's fucking pissing herself while someone is protecting her. </br>  <br>The manga portrayed that scene way better in terms of atmosphere and showing how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up. Having Megu-nee there reassuring her through it all ruins the whole thing.</br>  <br>You make me, buddy</br>   Symbolism <br><br>bravo vince</br></br>  <br><br>You know 30/13 means approximately 2 chapters per episode<br>They could fucking adapt it easily.</br></br></br>  <br> how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up <br>She never realizes it in that scene. The entire time she thinks it's a ghost from the trial of courage.</br></br>  <br>Megu being dead is already obvious. The anime isn't hiding it. The fact that you see her clinging to someone that is not there to protect her is much worse.</br>  <br>I agree, but there's no way to know whether it will work out until the show's over.<br><br>Relevant content wise, there's the mall and Miki/Kei's backstory, Megu-nee and the bathroom scene, the whole basement and infected Kurumi arc, helicopter, and graduation. Anything else I'm forgetting?</br></br></br>  <br>But they aren't. After episode 3 they've adapted 4 chapters.</br>  <br> 2 chapters an episode <br><br>The chapters are really short for a monthly manga.</br></br></br>  <br> Miki/Kei <br>1 Episode<br><br> Megu-nee bathroom <br>1 <br><br> Infected Kurumi <br>2 (3 an absolute limit)<br><br> Helicopter <br>1-2<br><br> Graduation <br>1<br><br>That's 8 episodes maximum. Add that to what we've already done and we still don't even make it to 12.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She always knew deep down, her facade and playing delusional only pushed it away so much but it was always there in some way<br><br>Not my point, so what?</br></br></br>  <br> The manga portrayed that scene way better in terms of atmosphere and showing how Yuki realizes that world's fucked up. <br><br>How is it not your point?</br></br></br>  <br><br>What I was talking about that they could have adapted it to anime easily in 1:1 sense. They could add extra scenes without changing shit much as well.</br></br>  <br>It isn't. I didn't say a thing about Megunee being dead or anything or how audience understands she's really not there. It's not as obvious as the manga.</br>  <br>Are you serious right now? You are complaining because it isn't obvious? Do you want a mexican soap opera camera zoom-in to character's faces to know what they feel?</br>  The anime is making Megu-nee more of a character at the expense of others because it's going to actually have an ending to the story earlier on, so Megu-nee obviously has to be more prominent.<br><br>I thought this was obvious</br></br>  <br>Miki one on one real talk with Yuki, but that's also short and could even be done in the same episode as the mall flashback. Though that itself might take 2 episodes, especially if they keep Kurumi's visit to her home and take their time with scenes including Kei.</br>  I just want more transltaions of the manga  <br>There's nothing to translate until tomorrow, calm your tits.</br>  Best girl of season.  wait a minute  When's Shovel gonna go bonkers and stop fighting because she thinks the shovel is senpai?  <br>Megu-nee also had the bear on her rear view mirror.</br>  <br>Miikun shouldn't exist yet.<br> Kill it with fire </br></br>  <br>What's Ruu doing there?</br>  <br>What am I waiting for?</br>  <br>The next episode.</br>  <br>Kurumi is love<br>Kurumi is life</br></br>  <br>Next manga chapter</br>  <br>You cheeky cunt.</br>  <br>Ayaya looks like she's not wearing pants at all.</br>    <br>Ruu doesn't wear a pink ribbon</br>  <br><br>I don't know, you should kill yourself right now.</br></br>  <br>Flinging shit isn't gonna help further your argument.</br>   feel when just watched the raw and understood everything <br><br>guess not having to wait for subs is cool.<br>starting to see the fruits of my study</br></br></br>  <br>Subscribed</br>  <br>thanks :')</br>  I'm really afraid they'll go for an anime original end where Yuki is the only survivor and gets picked up by Helicopter-kun at the end.<br><br>Please don't make it happen.</br></br>  <br> Megu-nee  will be the only survivor.</br>  <br>Yes I do<br><br> zombie cum inside Kurumi <br> girls save Kurumi before zombie takes a bite out of her <br> by time the girls check if Kurumi is okay, she turn into a perverted lesbian zombie and sexually assaults the girls </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That'd only happen if it was adapted by Bones.</br>  <br>Twist: It's all in Megu-nee's head.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Gakkou Gurashi! - 03 [720p].mkv     <br>Shovel is already a zombie though.</br>  <br> perverted lesbian futa zombie <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br> everything is just a never ending chain of delusions <br> the person who is behind all of the delusions at the end   is the viewer </br></br>  <br>She's holed up in the basement bunker alone, imagining what it would be like if she had saved the others.<br>Her weak presence in the club is due to her being unable to properly associate herself with them, even in her mind, not after what she did.</br></br>  <br> season ends <br> finish watching the last episode <br> look outside window <br> zombies everywhere <br> check /a/ <br> the last post was made at the start of the season </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying there wouldn't be zombies shitposting daily because that's what they remember doing </br>    <br>That's why in her delusions she views herself as a zombie.</br>  So, do the zombies eat people or just bite them?<br>If they are hungry, it would make more sense to eat them, but they just seem to want to bite.</br>  <br>Can zombies solve captchas?</br>   pretty much every thread is filled with mostly mangafags, constantly comparing the manga to the anime.

But the round just started.</br>  <br>Hisa sets a new goal for Saki: Winning<br>End Chapter 2.<br>Taking a break now.</br></br></br>  <br>My personal opinion about the seating is that it used to be regular positioning and clockwise, but was reversed so the arm of the discarding player blocks the next player a bit, giving the others time to react to the discard before rushing into their next draw.</br>  <br>One could say that if you decide that your objective is breaking even, then you win when you break even. <br>Which means that Saki has always been winning, in her own way.</br></br>  <br>I think that Saki is pretending to be scared to psychologically manipulate Kyouko.<br>All of Saki's little frightened poses are a little contrived.</br></br>  <br>Saki was staring daggers when she walked into the room.</br>  <br>seeing in the dead wall (and where the fourth tile of a kan is) doesn't explain +-0.</br>  <br>I think it's more of just her having a really bad poker face.  And being freaked out by Kyouko playing with her feet under the table </br>  <br>Don't forget, by taking her socks off, she's returning her psychological state to when she was little. They're probably serious reactions.</br>  <br>That's Ikuno's tactic.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128416492 <br> All self-respecting anons should ignore this blatant /u/ astroturfing. <br> self-respecting anons  <br><br>anon, please. we all know there's no such thing here.</br></br></br></br>  Since we just reread Chapter 2, let's recall how Saki played Kyouko the first time.  It's been a whale.<br><br>Look at yuu. Fatty. Fatty fat fatso.<br><br>No wonder why you stay all day under a kotatsu.<br><br>How'd you get so fat, them fatty fingers can't even grab the tiles<br><br>Go cry and eat some more cake, fatty fat wide load</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>... and this little pose telling how she "feels" about it.<br>Saki is putting on a show for everyone. [Hands up + teary eyes = fake] But she is in total control.</br></br>  <br>Saki is the shark in the piranha tank.<br>Wait, that doesn't make sense.</br></br>  <br>Teru go to bed.</br>   not Saki: Tanoshii <br><br>Let it toki!</br></br>  I guess that by now eveyone's accepted Rinkai will be in the finals, right?  <br>No, I believe in Magical Demon Slayer Kyouko.</br>  Is it true that Sagimori resembles Ritz?  <br>supposedly</br>  What do you girls expect from shinohayu? will it have a stronger connection with the main series besides the pros? will Shino go to valhalla?<br><br><br>Yes, manga Ritz. If 3d Ritz resembles manga Ritz I wanna invite her to my house so she can fuck my sister.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Right about here was the final moment when Ritz could have been stopped. After this event, she's just been growing more powerful, eating more and higher quality food. Now she's truly unstoppable.</br></br>  <br>I hope that Shino provides a missing link with the Saki-Teru-Goldfish backstory. Shino has a playstyle which is a blend of Teru and Saki. I wonder if they actually met, or if Shino was only an indirect influence.</br>  <br>Nothing can stop Ritz. Except laziness.</br>  Is Ritz actually a lesbian or just pretending to be a lesbian?  <br>This part gives me the creeps.<br>It's doesn't look like they're going to help the person on the cart. It looks like they're going to do evil medical experiments. The person on the right is dressed like a mahjong pro.</br></br>  <br>forgot the pic</br>  <br>Fucking Gilgamesh was Goldfish's dad.<br><br>Also, Hayarin's mom owns a candy store. Teru and family can pay visit there.Both Hayaya and Teru have a tornado arm and play the stupid idol on camera.<br><br>Awai loves sweets as well and I noticed she and Kanna tend to wear star themed clothes and artifacts, though making a connection right now feels a bit over the top.<br><br>Threads ago, someone suggested Shiraitodai and Shino's school might be in the same position during the nationals. About to win for the third time, I think that would be cool.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that the mahjong pros got pissed when Shino's mom beat Niemann, and forced her into some medical experiment on mahjong mental skills. Maybe Goldfish ended up in the same experiment after (almost?) drowning.<br>Shino's intuition may be right.</br></br>  <br>Also, Goldfish wants to build an aquarium, and...</br>  <br>Yue is an expert on fish.</br>  <br>I'm not sure what it says about Saki that her reaction to "aquarium" was "sushi".</br>  I want to fuck Yuan.  <br>You may force some parallels between Shiraitodai and Shino's school.<br> Before autism hit her Teru appears to be a confident sweet girl like Shino. <br> Overconfident blondie asshole  <br> Mamma who takes care of the fools <br> Fish lover <br>Only issue would be Hayarin that doesn't resemble Takami at all besides TITS.<br><br><br>"I will eat everything you love"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank Yuan.</br>      <br>Cute girls playing mahjong along with a slowly growing sense of foreboding.<br><br>Also falling in love with side characters only to watch their dreams get crushed.</br></br></br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  So, any leaks yet?

She and Miho are still the best pairing for the series. </br></br>  do you know what time it is, /a/?<br><br>Harvest time. <br><br>And the OVA release day?<br>Triplets (and Aislinn) time.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Post some of that bountiful harvest, then.</br></br>    <br>http://may.2chan.net/b/res/34571497<wbr>8.htm<br><br>NSFW warning, and still too little pics of her.</br></br></wbr></br>  The early chapter dump encouraged me to reread some of the earlier parts of the manga.<br><br>Something I noticed was the article Saki's dad shows to her at the end of chapter 3.<br><br>Teru is smiling. The Teru in the picture gives off a completely different vibe than what we actually got.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, I did save a few. Google translated the thread for a laugh, as expected it's mostly gibberish.</br></br>  <br><br>Teru always had that "merchant's smile" for the presses.</br></br>  ITT: We give Aislinn what she deserves.  <br>Oh, there's an even bigger shot on chapter 4.<br><br><br>It's just hard for me to imagine her cheerful. Though I guess that might just be Saki threads and Biyori jading me.</br></br></br></br>  Life is full of reasons to be happy, like pudding and...more pudding?  <br><br>Flashback Teru seems like such a gentle sister. Makes you really wonder what happened to cause the falling out.<br><br>Also, the uniform in those pictures is way different from the uniforms we got. Since it lists her age, she's definitely in high school so that should be the Shirotodai uniform.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Sumire call her out on it after their press conference? Teru's as fake as can be when the press is concerned.</br>  <br>My memory's quite foggy, but I do recall something like that.<br><br>I guess I'll just see when I get to that chapter again.<br><br>Though the fact Teru is good at acting two faced seems ironic when you consider her motif.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What about her leitmotif?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ph3<wbr>PM6fRGwY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Early manga Saki really is drastically different. This is her right after she threw a game to Yuuki in chapter 4.<br><br>That look of maternal contentment in letting another person win. Such a drastic difference from the demon.<br><br><br>That's literally just a final boss theme, nothing two-faced about it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When the final boss is the first encountered, there is no need for a second level.</br></br>  You can clearly feel Ritz's designs morphing as the series went along. That shadow Koromo looks terrible.<br><br>I wonder if the nopan thing was something she always intended from the start.</br></br>  Huh, Saki's always had a penchant for long skirts and Nodoka likes maid cosplay.<br><br>While the long skirt thing turned up again, it's a shame we've never gotten Nodoka cosplaying again.</br></br>  Saki with her eyes wide open in panic and caution is an expression you don't quite get nowadays.  Saki was originally a story about Saki realizing her love for her friend Kyoutarou. She would chase after him, while he chased after Nodoka. Mahjong was merely a sub plot.<br><br>Then Ritz was ron'd be a triple yakuman online. She never felt anything like it. She needed to express the feeling of tanoshii through manga.</br></br>  <br>Actually look back up the thread, we got Saki panicking recently as well.<br><br><br>That face is a far cry from the fact I just posted. I really think she regresses to a childlike state of mind when playing mahjong now.</br></br></br></br>  Huh, Fujita was the first to cuck a deadwall draw from Saki in the manga.  And possibly the first instance of crying and scared Saki in the manga.<br><br>Fujita pro was really intimidating early on.</br></br>  Guess that answers my earlier nopan question.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> Lesbian <br><br>Yuriproject doesn't think so. Why else would they drop it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Teru's a wall. Not even her sister can reach her, let along her friends. At her school her behavior's probably more transparent as it appears that she doesn't many fans there, those girls at the hallway are all Sumire's fans according to Ritz. <br><br>Makes you wonder what kind of relationship she had with goldfish cause her death probably trigerred her autism, or if Awai's the actual goldfish resurrected via voodoo magic as she got answers just with a gay stare. <br><br><br>iirc her motif was "sunshine", or related to weather conditions like a teru teru bozu, that's why she's protrayed calm and collected at the rooftop where she can feel the wind in peace, and also the reason why she has a tornado arm in attack mode (bad weather). Her mirror power was because she's part of Amaterasu. I'm not sure though, I'm five yakumans behind my tanoshii certificate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They probably have no taste, or are all secretly straight or something.</br></br>  <br>When the official anime page drops the yuri tag you have my permission to bitch.</br>  <br> chupame la concha <br>Sí por favor.</br></br>  <br>demon killing</br>  If Saki reversed the genders so it's mostly guys would it be as popular?  Post the mahjong guide fags.  <br>Maybe even more popular. Gotta get that fujo dosh</br>  <br><br>What do you think you are, some kind of comedian?<br><br>Well, your jokes aren't funny.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the same kind of fans for sure, but still decent sales because fujo strong. <br><br>Or just genderbend half of the cast, each pair has one girl that you can point out at and say "yeah she wears the richii stick in the relationship".</br></br></br>  <br><br>That's Shiromi as a man??</br></br>  <br>during a free day at the nationals, she tried the maid uniforms of Touka's maids.</br>    <br>Look at Touka, driven mad with lust.<br><br>Who will protect Nodocchi?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Soon those revolting blobs of flesh will be mine.</br></br>  <br>Hajime sweat drop is removed (or barely visible?).<br><br>And if I remember correctly they censored her in the third panel in .<br><br>Hmmm, I need to rematch the episode, didn't find screenshots online.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Touka, what are you going to do with that large bag?</br></br>  Here comes the pain  Saki gets possessed with the soul of her dead friend when she becomes evil saki.  <br>Holy crap Ako is flat</br>  Why can't I tsumo? Don't I win now?  <br><br>KILL THE DEMON</br></br>  <br>No multiplier means that you have no yaku. A list of the yaku can be found further down in that site.</br>  <br>Dont worry anon, Sakisan will come through near the end with a line asking if Kyouko knew if she was really playing the game or being played by the game follow by a big hand finisher</br>  <br>You have nothing worth points, aka yaku.<br>For example having all your tiles be of one suit is worth some points.<br>Or having all your combos involve either a 1 or 9, if both of your tiles were nines you'd be shitting points right now.</br></br></br>  <br>Dammit, the thing just said I win with four sets and a pair. So I actually have to win, and get some yaku junk? Would be nice if the game actually explained stuff.</br>  <br>It's about not losing.</br>  <br>it said you can call stumo <br>you can only call stumo on Fully concealed hand.</br></br>  <br>Yes. The yaku determine how many han your hand has, and thus how many points you receive for winning with it.<br>A general rule is to keep your hand closed (don't call tiles) so you can call riichi, unless you can call to form a yaku. Most yaku only exist when your hand is closed, and the others can be open or closed..</br></br>  <br><br><br> Saki <br> Yuri <br><br>We've been over this girls. Tacos is with Sugar. Ritz agreed. Don't bother Yuri Project about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Sugar? She's stealing my sweets? This shall not be allowed.</br></br>  What does Toki drink?  <br>Teru's so perfect. <br><br>Dragon juice.</br></br></br>  <br>Most yaku exist in open hands, but some of the most common or get their han value down or are invalid with open hands.<br><br><br>The game is quite simple, if it's just about winning a hand.<br>You have 2 rules for all and any hand be able to win.<br>1 - The hand must be valid and be ready.<br>I mean, that thing about four sets and a pair (there are two exceptions for this, but don't mind now). About the "being ready" part is what we call "tenpai".<br>2 - The hand must accomplish at least one yaku.<br>The easier way to explain what a yaku is, is comparing it with "poker hands", as even those are called yaku in japanese. For now, just keep in mind that yaku is some kind of a special pattern that gives points (multiplier) to your hand.<br><br>You may call "ron" or "tsumo" when the first rule is accomplished. "ron" is what you call when you win your hand through the discard of an opponent. "tsumo" is what you call when you win your hand by self draw.<br>But, you can't win if the second rule is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it time for more mahjong lessons?    Toki, do you ever feel like you're being watched from far far above?  Let the thread die for now. We'll make a new one when leaks come out.  <br>Saki Chapter 3!<br/></br>  <br>Saki being Saki.</br>  <br>Saki plays for moral victories, not real ones.</br>  Why does Saki spit when she talks?  <br>Hisa setting new rules to further handicap Saki.</br>  <br>Saki has everyone's attention.</br>  <br>Double riichi for Saki.</br>  <br>Ippatsu tsumo win for Saki.</br>  <br>Nodoka strikes back.</br>  <br>Not playing against Hitler in mahjong and thus the inferior mahjong animu, for one thing.<br><br>Also no pantsu or some bullshit and I fucking hate that.</br></br></br>  <br>Nodoka wins another hand.</br>  <br>Nodoka pulls far ahead of Saki.</br>  <br>As in Chapter 2, Saki needs another miracle to break even.</br>  <br>Here it comes.</br>  <br>Can you handle the excitement?</br>  <br>Saki gets another kan, and...</br>  <br>BOOM!

Welcome to the glossy future.</br>  <br>According to the experts Saki takes place in 2050 where iPS, demons, aliens, super powers and no panties are the rule. We were born too soon.</br>  <br>not childhood friends?</br>  <br>No anon, we were born in time to raise that next generation of mahjong players.</br>  <br>Saki x Nodotits OTP. I will fite you.</br>  <br>When I miss the leaks I check the futaba catalog and there's always a thread in baidu with more or less the same pics.<br><br><br>I like Himematsu because of its metaphoric balls. Experienced teams usueally put the overpowered turbo dykes as vanguard and captain.<br> Teru and Awai <br> Jindai and Kasumi <br> Toki and Toki's tighs <br> Satoha and Nelly (Satoha ain't monster but damn she's likely the strongest "normal" in the series so far) <br><br>Himematsu put the unexperienced bomber and her bully in those positions. In a better world they get a spin-off.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Quite a feature don't being a monster and yet being the 3rd better high school player in Japan.</br>  <br>Nodotits is boring as fuck. Anyone else x Saki is way more interesting.</br>  Is Awai supposed to be a good mahjong player? Or is she just there for looks since Teru typically takes someone at the table down to 0? Because she had such incredible stupid fucking play and is a big cause of the Shitchigas advancing.  <br><br>I just think that those two could have fun together, that's all.</br></br>  <br>She's supposed to be. Actually, she's supposed to be the second best player in Shiratodai, but... yeah.</br>  <br> Is Awai supposed to be a good mahjong player? <br>Yes, you may say that it's just like in Nodoka's case. Cute face and popular with the people but you also get confirmation from people like data freak FutaQ.<br><br> is she just there for looks since Teru typically takes someone at the table down to 0 <br>Teru used to be captain, their current strategy is new and pretty sure she trust Awai, if that trust is emotional beacause a new goldfish thing or well grounded we might see later. <br><br> big cause of the Shitchigas advancing. <br>Achiga won because plot demanded their victory. The captain round was more of a clusterfuck because Ritz rushed the conclusion so every captain got a horrible development. Ryuuka got worst treatment imo. Remember the anime got announced around chapter 3<br><br>Fuck, I pray every day a big earthquake doesn't hit Japan in the next 20 years.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We are living in the dawn of a new age.</br>  <br>Achiga was a mistake. The only reason it exists is so Ritz could shoehorn her favorite pair of boobs even more.<br>The show would have been more interesting if it was from the point of view of Shiraitodai.<br><br>There's a lot of things that they could expand on for Shiraitodai, unlike Achiga.<br><br>- Teru/Sumire's past victories<br>- Internal matches to select the teams<br>- Awai's backstory (how she got so close to Teru, etc)<br>- How the fuck Seiko got on the team<br><br>And that's not even touching Teru's motivations/feeling regarding Saki.<br><br>Instead, we got Achiga, which didn't have much going for them.<br><br>- They were Nodoka's friends<br>- Shitrue got rekt by Grandmaster</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Achiga was a reboot that used cute easily marketable characters to get back interest in the series. <br>Shiratodai is sadly not that type of characters. Yes Teru is cute but she's not for that sort of role.</br></br>  <br>The only uncute characters in Shiraitodai are Sumire, who's supposed to be the cool type, and Seiko. No idea what the fuck Ritz was thinking on that one.<br>Harvest Toki is literally the same as Bowling Toki. Awai and Teru are cuter than any of the characters in Achiga. <br><br>Plus, they're not shit at being friends like Achiga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Harvest Toki has glasses!<br>And she drinks tea!<br>Completely different to Bowling Toki.</br></br></br>  <br>It's hard to explain but Achiga design and characterwise works much better than Shiratodai. <br>Do you know what I mean?</br></br>  <br>They look more like protagonists, I guess.<br>Seriously, Shiraitodai just give off this "boss battle" feeling. Too bad they didn't live up to it.</br></br>  <br> didn't live up to it <br>Teru. <br>Also the fact that Shiratodai got mostly beaten in the semis means they'll mean business in the finals.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant Shiraitodai as a whole.<br>Teru inspires equal feelings of fear and awe, like a good final boss should.</br></br>  <br>Shouldn't a number of those be saved for the main story?</br>  <br>Having the Shiraitodai team selections alone would have made a more interesting story than Achiga.</br>  <br>As a fan I agree, but in reality that wasn't the point of Achiga in the first place.</br>  <br>Shiraitodai in general is just an interesting school.</br>  <br>I don't understand how some teams have dozens of players fighting for spots on a team, while other teams (Kiyosumi: ) accept walk-on newcomers.<br>Yet still, on the big clubs they still have bad players in the starting five.</br></br>  <br>teru's team is full of burdens<br><br>it's even worse than kazekoshi's pile of training weights</br></br></br>  <br>Because there are renowned 'mahjong schools' that people tend to go to if they want to play mahjong in high school at high level. Kiyosumi wasn't a mahjong school.</br>  <br>Just having the show be in Shiraitodai's point of view alone would already have made the show a lot better.<br><br>- The main team actually losing to some no name scrub<br>- Kuro peeing her pants would have been more bearable. In the main show, her reasons for not discarding dora was brought up only during the match. For a main character, that's pretty bad. But for a side character, it would have been more acceptable.<br>- Since we won't see any of Achiga's training, their ass pulls wouldn't really be ass pulls.<br><br><br>The point of Achiga was for Ritz to expand on Nodotit's past. Her childhood friend(s) could have been in any school and it wouldn't have made a difference. Replace Seiko with a new character (Nodotit's friend) and it would have been better than Achiga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> on the big clubs they still have bad players in the starting five. <br><br>In Shiraitodai case it's because they have several teams and they pick the best team, they don't form the best possible team from all the available members.<br><br>Also I wouldn't call Sumire, Awaii, and Harvest Time weak. Even Seiko has an useful ability.<br><br>Senriyama? Toki, Sera, FunaQ, and Ryuuka are good players, and Izumi is according to her previous results a strong first year player - but she got destroyed in her match. <br><br>Rinkai? No weak player, perhaps Hao since she doesn't know how to play well riichi mahjong.<br><br>Himematsu? Well, here I don't see any really weak player, but also no really strong player. That's probably the weirdest team of them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thing is you can't have something like the main rival team's backstory for a spin-off. That shit's too relevant and saved for the main story which is what we are getting. Yes Ritz's pace is snail speed but that's a different issue. <br><br>And if we got achiga as a no name team just dumped in the semis we will have to bare their flashbacks in the finals. Their backstories are fine but they also pale in comparison to what Shiraitodai can offer like this anon listed <br><br><br>Hello my name's Ichigo, please adopt instead of buying, Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Achiga's backstories aren't really necessary in the finals since most of them are show in the semis already.<br>And look, Shiraitodai didn't get any back story, and most people here already like them.</br></br>  <br>Is that Nodoka in Tsuruga's uniform?</br>  <br>Does that look like a K cup to you?</br>  Just remember that there's a 100% chance of the Shinohayu anime being announced during the next thread.  <br> Nodoka <br>That's Chachanon aka Ichigo Sasano, the girl that was hit by Hiroe's Honrouto. This is Nodocchi.</br></br>  <br>Prepare to be disappointed then.</br>  <br>I know.<br>If it's not on the 25th our next chance at a new anime I guess is the 10th anniversary next year.</br></br>  <br>I'm having trouble visualising a K-cup.</br>  LEAKS ARE COMING <br>Should we make a new thread?</br>  Next Biyori is  cats .

She's perfection personified.  Th cutest.  <br>Looks like it's time again</br>  Of course, there are limitations to how many pictures can be used as only 3 episodes are out.  <br>But that doesn't change the fact that these results confirm that Nao is girl of the year.</br>  I gotta hand it to Key. They managed to make a punch feel real and enjoyable.  <br> run right past her <br>frigid</br></br>  <br> Girl of the year <br> Not Isla <br>What are you talking about?</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a penis?</br>  <br>Those are lungs</br>  <br> Isla <br> Girl <br>Giftias are not people, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>What a hottie.</br>  <br>Isla had her time. Nao actually has a character.</br>  <br>She was more human than /a/ will ever be ;_;</br>  This scene did things to me. Dat voice, dat body movement, dat face, all perfect.  <br> Key animates the punch </br>  Imouto is the cutest.  <br> Horriblesubs </br>  <br>Go back to your own territory </br>  It's not every day that such a great female lead comes into anime, but it's not every day that Nao appears in an anime.  <br>will pa works ever get their credit</br>  <br>Sorry, just had to correct OP. You'll have to wait for imouto to die before the cutest title passes down.</br>  <br><br>I gotta hand it to P.A. Works. They managed to make a punch feel real and enjoyable.  this time with feeling </br></br>  <br>Woaw there pal. I think you're mixing up annoying and cute. Nao is perfection in a bottle, and the title of cuteness comes with it.</br>  <br>I kind of expected her to be more stoic and have a different voice judging from the first promo image. I'm still not used to her character.</br>  Now, I don't usually post pictures, but Nao I have to.  <br>It's ok /a/non, perfection is still perfection no matter who looks at it.</br>  <br>Is something supposed to happen?</br>  <br>But she is stoic /a/non, she is...</br>  For use when needed.  So when is she going to go invisible whenever not Lelouch embarasses her when she inevitably goes dere?   that part of the OP where the singing gets slightly surreal and Nao is wagging her finger <br>2cute4me<br>Anyone have a gif/webm of that?</br></br>  <br>That's not even a punch, he just backhanded her, haha. Nigger what the heck.</br>  <br>As for the part of the song there is this https://<span>youtu.be/TcEbnFTY4R8  [ ]</br>  <br>Wish it was looped better but beggars can't be choosers. Thanks, /a/non.</br>  <br>Here's a gif for your troubles.</br>  Nao is cute. Im going to marry Nao.  <br>A gif with a shitty loop</br>  <br> Implying Nao would ever go out with someone like you </br>   tfw you will never have delinquent Nao as a gf <br> tfw you will never be roughly persuaded to have sex with her <br> tfw you will never be involuntarily involved in her delinquent mischief </br></br>  <br>I'll take him after he gets rejected.</br>  <br>Nao this is a story I could get behind.</br>  <br> Implying you have a chance with her </br>  <br>Why is she such a bitch?</br>  <br>Getting rejected by Nao is no reason to hate her.</br>  Sorry /a/, but buying this is the closest you will ever get to being with Nao.  <br>But what did she do with those photos of herself?</br>  I wonder when the ESL guy is gonna appear.  <br>Gave them to me</br>  Well you know Maeda will try to make you cry so Nao is definitely getting the Keyaids.  <br>Don't say such things. Nao is perfect and won't die, making happy little babies with Yuu.</br>  <br>Maeda has not killed a main heroine since Air, Nao will be fine.</br>  Please guys, Nao more bullying.    When will the MC NTR Nao with Yusa?  <br>Nao is pure. She would never do that.</br>  I want to ____ Nao    <br>is that charlotte?</br>    Sides of perfection    Gotta feed Nao  <br>Apples look perfect in Nao's hand.</br>  God I fucking hate Nao so much. What an inconsistent cunt of a character. Only redeeming part about this show is speedbro.  <br>I wish I was that apple.</br>  <br> Her character is too human like and doesn't fit into one stereotypical set. Waaaaaaaa! My animu. </br>  <br>Don't worry /a/non, Nao still accepts you. Have some cow tongue.</br>  <br>I'm mad at her because she is a cunt anon. Not because she isn't some generic tsundere or moeblob.</br>  <br> bawww the heroine has a strong personality instead of being a kyoani blob doormat, waaaaa <br><br>Deal with it, hipster.</br></br></br>  <br>Does anyone have a copy of that image in a higher resolution?</br>  <br>Although I can see where you are coming from, I don't think her personality is overwhelming enough to be considered a "cunt." She has the personality of most girls you'd meet in the real world, which is why I enjoy her so much; she's like a breath of fresh air in anime. I highly recommend that you go outside and interact with real girls and see what I mean, if you can even manage to get off of your chair and get a girl interested to stay in a conversation with you.</br>  <br> She has the personality of most girls you'd meet in the real world <br><br>I think you might be the one who needs to go outside man. I have met a lot of fucking bimbos and retarded sluts, but this bitch is a whole new level in retarded inconsistencies.</br></br></br>  <br>Learn to reverse search</br>  <br>ty anon</br>  <br>don't feed her, she'll think she's people</br>  <br> Bases his reasoning on the one time he heard girls talk in junior high <br>I don't know where you grew up, but either you have never had girls as friends or you are a shut in who bases his views on how women act based on harems and ecchi anime. I've traveled to and met girls in several countries. Although I've spent a little over half of my life in the US, I've haven't stayed in one place for more than 4 years, traveling from State to State since I was younger. Outside of how girls act in front of strangers, believe it or not, they are human and have complex emotions and personalities for different situations. The "fucking bimbos" and "retarded sluts" are much smarter than you or me but are just in situations that's more complex than you or I could understand. I'd love to discuss this more, but it's hard to explain humans to someone who hasn't interacted with others since middle school.</br></br>  <br>That's not very nice</br>  <br>Don't thank me, thank google.</br>  <br> like an actual human </br>   All these gifs <br> 2015 <br><br>It's like you don't actually love her</br></br></br>  Nao is the best girl of the season by far.<br><br>I'd really love to fuck her sweet butt.</br></br>  <br>FUCKING TUMBLR SHIT</br>  <br>How can I love a 2d girl? They are only meant for admiring.</br>  <br> Only knows this because he browses Tumblr <br>I actually got this image from a thread the other day. However, it shouldn't matter what website an image is form as long as it is art.</br></br>  I can't wait for the invisiblity doujins  <br>I don't browse that garbage site, but I recognize the terrible artstyle anywhere</br>  Looks like even the physical aspects of wind fail when around Nao.    <br>Is Nao into indecent exposure?</br>  <br>I rather like the art style, but that's just my opinion.<br>Additionally, I reverse searched the image and didn't find any tumlr links, faggot.</br></br>  <br>If I think it's tumblr shit, then it's tumblr shit</br>  <br>Based /a/non, you've done it again.</br>  A true friend  <br> I think, therefore I am. </br>  Wait, why do people have an issue with Nao? Because she bullied the MC, or what? He deserved some bullying.  <br>Thank anon who gave me the high resolution image</br>  You guys actually like this meloshit or just the character?  <br>Beause /a/ is full of insecure guys that need weak female leads to make them feel masculine while for 24 minutes. <br> ITT: A bunch of guys that don't interact with girls </br></br>  <br>I like the anime and characters. It's a breath of fresh air while all the other anime seems to be trying to fit into one type repetitive category with both their genre and characters.</br>  <br>I'm gonna need to save this for future purposes.</br>  <br>For public use</br>  Sometimes, Nao reflects on how many haters she has.  And then she realizes haters don't have shit on her.  Plus she's just a fictional character so she can't really react to haters unless her creators made an OVA with her doing a comedic reaction to the hate       <br>She's entertaining, which is what really matters.</br>  <br>Are we kanon now?</br>    <br>where the fuck do you live?i mean here in asia there some bimbo and slut but not until that stupid,</br>  SEMEN DEMON  Nao a cute  <br>Don't bother. He lives in the world of animu</br>  <br>She certainly knows how to summon my demon</br>  <br>the way the took out that gangster was stupid as shit. they just went up and choked two guys and nobody fucking noticed.<br>i really hope this doesn't turn into angel beats.</br></br>  <br>Who is this boner tamer?</br>  <br>Charlotte</br>  <br> Implying you would be calm in a situation where a girl appears to be breaking all rules of physics <br>Calm down macho man.

No thanks then<br><br> this is why I like her <br>Then stop watch anime, go out, date some real girls, and stop making shitty threads like these exist</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Funny that no one went to check on her but instead continue to chase the man. The punch was unrealistic that she is still concious considering she just flew.</br>  Waifu of the season scum.  <br> the shittiest <br>ftfy</br></br>   /ai/ - Idle Activities   Sumire is boring, they said.<br><br>Sumire has no personality, they said.</br></br>  <br>I love that hairstyle on her.</br>  <br>They should replace her with Sumire-Gelato.
