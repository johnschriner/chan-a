[ Ninja high-tech wristband  <br>and some Kishimoto scetches.</br>  <br>that's really cool</br>  <br>Is this from the exhibition?</br>  <br>most likely yes</br>       trying this hard to post ''new materials'' just to have a thread <br><br>Good job fooling the stupid mods, Narutards.</br></br>      <br>Is that a byakugan?</br>  I really hope bort won't be too much of a faggot like his old man  The Last BDs are out on Wednesday.<br><br>I haven't watched yet.</br></br>  <br>Nope.<br><br>That finished shot can be seen in the trailer and his eyes are blue.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br>How long until a decent rip?</br></br></br>  <br>Hopefully it'll be out this weekend.</br>  Is that a duel disk?    <br>can't wait for my LE box to arrive</br>  When the fuck is the BD of The Last coming up? I'm not listening to Korean dubs.  <br>Do Ninja have Children Card games?</br>  <br>They look better than the SP designs, that's for sure.<br><br><br>Looks like some kind of workaround using scrolls to enable shinobi to use all five elements. It's actually kinda cool. Apparently that fat guy with glasses we saw is the head of their special weapons program or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but they have  NINJA INFO CARDS </br>      <br>Might as well post the rest. Looks like the 2nd phase of the exams will take place out in the desert. Possibly in Sunagakure.</br>  Still pissed that neither Bolt or Himawari didn't get the byakugan despite it being the strongest trait.    <br> despite it being the strongest trait <br> implying <br><br><br>And this looks like the gay ballroom where nardo and sauce talk about the aliens.</br></br></br></br></br>  And here's another promotional thing for the movie. I don't know why SP continues to use those faces for the dads, though.    More merchandise. Apparently Bort's got his own gold coin minted as well. I wonder who's on the back.<br><br>And what the fuck is a vintage car from the early 20th century doing there?</br></br>  So are there gonna be ninja robots? Does this mean Robo Naruto from the game is now canon?  <br>I hope they'll show off the new village long enough for us to take everything in. It's one of the most interesting aspects of the movie.</br>  Here's a better look at that movie postcard we've seen floating around.  Here are the colored versions. They look pretty good.    <br>Why does naruto still have so much paper work if he simply could create shadow clones to help him with it?</br>    <br>Wonder if that's the "Thunder car" that has been mentioned in the novels a couple of times.<br><br><br>HHnngghhh. Sunflower is adorable as heck.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Are they continuing Naruto with his kid as the new main character?<br>Will they stop doing that stupid ninja running?</br></br></br>  <br> that fucking onesie <br><br><br>How many nardos does it take to screw in a light bulb?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Smarthphones in the last <br> Then that Molde T. <br>Maybe niggers are into Tuning</br></br></br>  <br>Looking closer I don't think it has anything to do with the movie. They just put it there to save space I guess.<br><br><br>10/10 is probably my favorite of all the designs.<br><br><br> Will they stop doing that stupid ninja running? <br> incredibly popular with autists and chuunis alike and saves budget <br>You wish.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lee looks fucking atrocious, as expected. <br><br>Also he's going bald.</br></br></br>  <br>They turned him into Ginger Hitler FUCK</br>  <br>Konohamaru looks... surprisingly decent. Truly a chip off the old block. He's also the one to teach Bort Rasengan, so there's that.</br>  <br>this is actually kind of cool</br>  <br>I like Metal and his design. Seems to be a fairly serious boy judging by his range of facial expressions. Hopefully there'll be a moment with his dad.</br>  <br>He looks like a the average filler ninja or Iruka 2.0</br>  <br><br><br>Shikadai looks a lot better. Looks like they fixed his eyes a bit, too. They look less girly now.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does he have creases near his eyes? Isn't he like 20?</br>  <br>Who the hell is the mother?</br>  <br>Up next is Salad, and judging by that pose  she's looking for a big guy. </br>  <br>Lee always looked atrocious ever since Gaara buried him.</br>  <br> That smug </br>  <br>30</br>  <br>He's got the eyes of  a Ninja prostitute. </br>  <br>Why is Sasuke tsundere</br>  <br>Jesus fucking Christ. <br><br><br>Only plebs age.<br><br><br>Fuck if I know. It's another one of Kishi's mysteries.  For some reason I'm betting on Ayame, the ramen shop girl. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pink Shit.<br><br><br>Smug Shikadai is best Shikadai. <br><br><br>It's the only form of dere he knows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We've already seen Suna Metal City, but here's a better quality pic.</br>  <br>I want ponytail Sakura</br>  <br><br>Looks like something a heavy metal autist would wear.<br><br>pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with this guy?</br>  <br>Best design of all the girls</br>  <br>Look who finally decided to show up? And still looking as fat as ever.</br>  <br>I dont like it she looked better as a genin, chunin.<br><br>Lookes like the girls shrinked and the guys got the extra cms from them.</br></br></br>  <br>And here is Emo-kun's other half. Kind of impressed by his range of emotions this time around. <br><br><br> My name is Not Important... <br><br><br>He's a sandnigger. What did you expect? Did you even see Gaara?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's the winner of the Most Likely to Try on His Mother's Underwear Award</br>  <br> Kind of impressed by his range of emotions this time around. <br>But he's done all of those emotions before?<br><br>Aside from orgasm face.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's lost some weight, actually. Or stretched out. Also, she's got more of Karui's features, now.<br><br>I really like her design.</br></br></br></br>  <br>And here's the other non-Konoha kid we've seen. Is it just me or does he look like a Jew?</br>  <br>True I do like just about everyone's gen in designs, but I think Tenten's is great. And for being ninjas they look like they have no muscle mass whatsoever.</br>  <br>Best boy.</br>  <br>Is that confirmed Killer Bee's child or just the kid he trains?</br>  <br>He's a Kumo nigger of course he looks horrible</br>  <br>Shika - Ino - Chou has the best character designs.</br>  <br>Once again, more stuff we've seen before, just with higher quality.<br><br><br>For some reason her back profile looks skinnier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He has a big nigger nose. It's not a jew nose.</br>  <br>And now the ayylien. But seriously, Mitsuki is pretty good. I like him.</br>  <br>I like it</br>  <br>And now the last of Team Konohamaru. You can measure a character's relevance by how many different expressions and profiles drawn for them.</br>  <br>Wanst he son of kakashi and some random bitch from the village of the rain?</br>  <br>She actually looks good</br>  <br><br>It's beacuse the shoulders are more open on the back, and there's a lot of clothing bulk in the front.<br><br>She's a QT. That view on the upper right, man. I wanna see her animated already.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't blame you. Her design looks like it'd be easier to turn into a "slim" version of Chouchou now.</br>  <br><br> escrima sticks <br><br>OH FUCK NIGGER</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's a better look at Natasuke. Katasuke? Fucking nipponese.</br>  <br>I want him to lick my pee pee</br>  <br>And here's our resident faggot villain of the day, Momo. <br><br><br>They don't look like swords, that's for sure. Hopefully this movie will have plenty of taijutsu shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks like fucking Orochimaru and Kabuto's love child</br>  <br>Any info about this guy? His desing suggest either being Killer Bee diehard fan/student or death of Killer Bee</br>    <br>What the fuck kind of sandals are those?</br>  <br>The sharkan shooter has finally been revealed.</br>  <br>Are you telling me he isn't?</br>  <br>Presenting: the Ninjatendo GameBolt.</br>  <br>I wonder if he'll be the Sakura or Sasuke of the team</br>  <br><br> ninjas are dead <br> ninjas don't have to be your audience </br></br></br>  <br>Tengu?</br>  <br>Orochimaru's even wearing a similar outfit.</br>  <br>Byakugan + Rednnegan<br>It doesn't get any cooler.</br></br>  <br>The new Konoha vest looks terrible. <br><br>It looks long and really loose fitting, and has no pockets of any kind for gear.</br></br></br>  <br>They look uncomfortable as fuck</br>  <br>Saved my best for last.<br><br><br>He looks more like an Orochimaru to me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No need for a lot of gear when you have these.</br>  <br>Disagree. It actually looks like it might actually be able to protect somebody this time. <br><br><br>Momo's a pretty girl. Learned to walk in high heels.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're right, but something had to give to more definitively give off the idea of 'armored plate', which is what they did, by adopting the protector plate+riveted shoulders design.</br></br>  <br>Hopefully he's more laid back like he was at the beginning of the manga. He was still super serious in Gaiden but that was probably because he was on a mission.<br><br><br>Hinata always looked terrible with long hair.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why must Hinata always hide her tits?</br>  <br><br> bolt and himawari confirmed to be the kids with "That wierd mom" who dresses strange </br></br>  <br>Every character looks worse than their manga version.</br>  <br>Protect? When you are figthing with bullshit powers the best defense is dodging.</br>  <br>Did she got a boob reduction surgery?</br>  <br> Ninja's priviledge and you </br>  <br> bottom left face <br>is sai trying to be yao ming?</br></br>  <br>Himawari, Bolt and Naruto drank all the milk.</br>  <br> Yaranaika? </br>  <br><br>MILF + puberty = sticky sheets and sticky sheets = more laundry</br></br>  <br> Hopefully he's more laid back like he was at the beginning of the manga <br>He's in charge of the rambunctious Bort so I expect some comedic input from him.</br></br>  <br> what are kunai and shuriken </br>  <br>The only ones that have to worry about that are low tier ninjas aka the canon fodder they are better dead.</br>  So, do Naruto and Hinata's kids have the byakugan?  <br>Momoshiki is a guy.</br>  <br>Geta.<br>Although the single-toothed variety we see here is slightly less common than the bi-tooth variation Jiraiya wore.</br></br>  <br> he's going bald. <br><br>No. that's jut the terrible hairtyle he's always had at a bad angle. We see him doing handstands in the manga and he isn't bald.</br></br></br>  <br>baggy clothes</br>  <br> baggy clothes <br>I wonder if Himawari is hiding any secrets of her own under that yellow hoodie.</br></br>  <br>Fuck that new Konoha vest is /fa/ as fuck</br>  <br>This is why no one likes us.</br>  <br>No, must be the work of ninja seal or some kind of space ninjtsu. Or even the work of a enemy stand.</br>  <br>Jokes for trash tier shinobi</br>  <br>Hinata is really good at hiding her power level</br>  <br>I just can't look at this character and not think "shikamaru".<br>That's actually a bad thing to be honest.</br></br>  So who else thinks Kinshiki is gonna kick Sasuke's ass?  <br> Sunflower ZR <br>How wonderful.</br></br>  <br>They'll fight to a draw the first time, then Kin'll get BTFO before Momo can go Super Saiyan or whatever the fuck is happening.<br><br>I'm glad that Kishi is putting his big dumb alien climax in another dimension at the end, after the Chuunin Exams "finishes", which is what most of the movie seems to be dedicated towards.</br></br></br>  <br>That outfit is pretty cute, but isn't she a bit old for shorts?</br>  <br> ZR  <br> brocon imouto <br> Salad is the childhood friend <br>All we need is for Kishi to hand the series over to an incestfag and we're good to go.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Exactly what I'm afraid of.<br>Sasuke is actually "too good" for other villains, he's probably far stronger than Naruto at this point.<br>I just hope we get to see what Kinshiki's glowing club thing can do.</br></br></br>  <br> but isn't she a bit old for shorts? <br>You're only as old as you feel, anon.</br></br>  <br>Didnt you read the manga? They both got grew rusty and out of shape they are weaker than in the war</br>  How do I adopt a daughter?  <br>Kishi has said Naruto and Sasuke are equals even now.</br>  <br> standalone picture of her butt <br>ayy</br></br>  <br>Eh at least we're not /mlp/</br>  <br>more like sitalone</br>   Boruto and Himawari are the only known descendants of the Hyūga Clan who do not possess the Byakugan. However, according to Masashi Kishimoto, he intended to give them the Byakugan, but forgot to before releasing chapter 700 <br> but forgot to before releasing chapter 700 <br> forgot to </br></br>  <br> he's probably far stronger than Naruto at this point <br>According to the character bios they're about equal. Kin can fight Sauce to a draw with his glowing dildo bat, and that's about it. We don't know anything else about him.<br><br>Honestly the third act will be punctuated by big dumb explosions and overly complicated techniques that do absurd amounts of damage. It'll be more entertaining watching Bort scramble around trying not to get his ass blown up until his two daddies can give him the opening he needs so we can end this stupid alien farce once and for all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but you're all quite close.</br>  <br>What has Sasuke been doing since the war ended?<br>he's been on a mission.<br>He must've devoted a large amount to training so that he doesn't fail his mission.<br><br>Naruto has been doing paperwork and presumably only helping his son train.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now why would they need something like that?<br><br><br>He was joking. He could not give less of a fuck about the Byakugan and its users.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was laughing that entire interview so more likely he did no give a fuck.</br>  <br>Fuck off normie. Go to discuss anime to your shity stream pages.</br>  <br>Eh, who knows.</br>  <br>The bios say they are equal. Deal with it.</br>  <br>Read the fucking manga retard.</br>  <br>There's much worse threads on /a/.<br><br><br> He must've devoted a large amount to training so that he doesn't fail his mission <br> 12 years fucking around in a forest doing nothing <br> scan the other dimensions every now and again to see if anything's there <br>Shut up Sakura</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Sneak preview in 6 days, and it looks like there's a few new images from the movie floating around. Think we'll get a new trailer soon?  <br><br/></br>  <br>Maybe it's just like with Guy and Lee, Metal isn't actually related to Lee at all.</br>  <br> Metal isn't actually related to Lee at all </br>  <br>What woman in the series has those eyes?</br>  <br>So the SN foursome and Mitsuki are the main characters?</br>  <br>Then Sarada would have referred to him as the son of the sixth and not as some foreign exchange student.<br><br>Unless Kakashi truly is embarrassed about losing his wizard powers.</br></br></br>  <br> no byakugan </br>  <br>No, only jobbers and jobber villains get the byakugan</br>  <br>Yeah, pretty much. Salad and Mitsuki probably fuckoff as soon as Momo and Kin show up and don't appear again until the end. Hopefully we'll get to see what everyone else is thinking while the battle rages. I mean, their teammate basically just went on a suicide mission with Salad's dad. Hinata's probably scared shitless for her son and husband, and Konohamaru might not take it so well either.</br>  <br> Bolt flashing his ass. <br><br>What is wrong with this child?<br><br>Sauce and Nalt don't look as homo as before.</br></br></br></br></br>  So rather than Sasuke/Sakura/Naruto Ayylien/Sarada/Boruto will be Oro/Tsunade/Jiraya down to Sarada becoming Hokage and Boruto being 2cool4school his entire life.  <br>Phew. For awhile there I was worried they were trying to retcon Hinata's bust.</br>  <br>You need to show skin to be flashing some one.</br>  <br>This all started with the homo lust of naruto and sauce. <br> Not homo. </br></br>  <br>Sarada and Mitsuki will chase Sasuke and Boruto, mark my words. Sarada because "stupid Boruto, muh dad, muh 7th Hokage" and Mitsuki seems the character that does things because they're "omoshiroi".</br>  <br> What is wrong with this child? <br>Doesn't want Salad to hog all the attention.</br></br>  <br> will be Oro/Tsunade/Jiraya down to Sarada becoming Hokage and Boruto being 2cool4school his entire life <br>No clue. See, this is the first time we've gotten a Team 7 that wasn't defective/completely insane.<br><br>Salad will likely become Hokage, and if Bort's serious about changing his dad's era he'll probably be on dat ass as her Danzo. Mitsuki might try his hand at mad science or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sarada and Mitsuki will chase Sasuke and Boruto <br>I don't know how that'll happen since Sauce is the only person with keys to the extra-dimensional car. She'll probably stay back and help Pink tend to the wounded. Mitsuki will fuck off to god knows where and they'll all reunite at the ending to celebrate Bort's first murder.<br><br>It'd be cool if they had their own little three way  deadlock  but I just don't see it happening.</br></br></br></br>   special book to be released when you arrive at the movie theatre that contains the day Naruto became Hokage <br> The day Naruto became hokage <br><br>Finally some proper closure to this shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It ends with him banging hinata</br>  <br>Sasuke should really think on bringing a medic along. The kages are definitely going to need one after they get tossed aside in favor of Boruto and his two daddies.</br>  <br>Fitting that it's the last Nurudu thing Kishi draws. <br><br><br>This.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I'll laugh my ass off if she tries to come along and gets brutally put down by Sauce, then told to go help her mother out with any casualties.</br></br></br>  <br> the five Kage got absolutely rekt by Edo Tensei Madara Uchiha <br> 3 of them are even weaker this time <br> expected to take on an enemy to rival Kaguya <br>Place your bets, anons. How long will they last? 1 minute? 2?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not a narutard but it's really interesting seeing how their tech develops</br></br>  I am completely lost will all these movies, side mangas and shit. Is Kaguya still the strongest character in Naruto or are these new movie villains stronger?  <br>we don't know yet.<br>Probably not, though.</br></br>  <br>they are gonna be pounded offscreen</br>  <br><br><br> through the wonders of technology suddenly Lee has all five elements along with the Eight Gates </br></br></br>  <br>They're the people Kaguya was amassing an army to fight. They're probably about as strong as her, but you have to consider<br><br>1) there's two of them<br><br>2) naruto and sauce don't have their sun and moon hax anymore</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Namikaze genes beat out Uzumaki genes. Minato bloodline 2 stronk.</br>  <br>meanwhile ninja iwata was killed in the ninja world war by madara</br>  <br>10/10 style.<br><br>Ouch.<br><br><br>I wonder if Metal will get one. He's probably a taijutsu-only pleb too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then again, it might be they are weaker than Kaguya but there are _MANY_ of them, not just two.</br>  <br> I wonder if Metal will get one. He's probably a taijutsu-only pleb too. <br> implying he won't be a metal bender and use steel fists </br></br>  <br>Apparently Momo can transform.</br>  <br>Naruto took a katana through the kidney and, according to Kurama, that wasn't even CLOSE to actually 'hurting' him. That's 'Madara-taking-a-sword-through-the-<wbr>forearm' levels of pain tolerance.</wbr></br>  <br><br>the trailer already shows him as an angsty little bitch who ruins his sister's birthday cake (likely because his dad who is the fucking leader of the entire village was too busy)</br></br>  <br> implying he'll make it to the third round <br> implying he won't get BTFO by Bort and co. </br></br>  <br><br> This rebellious runt gets in fights all the time but is always sweet to his little sister Himawari </br></br>  <br><br>these animators still don't seem to understand he doesn't have blue eyes.</br></br>  <br>Boruto looks like the only one actually enjoying himself. Sasuke looks like he was forced to come and Naruto is feeling awkward about it.</br>  <br> implying it wasn't an accident </br>  <br> destroys birthday cakes <br> pushes Salad around <br> confrontational and arrogant <br> not somehow best boy  <br>anon pls</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sleeve dangling in the wind <br>There has to better way to hide that.</br></br>  <br>It's not like he couldn't just get another arm or something.</br>  <br>Looks more than ever like Bruce Lee.</br>  <br> Blues Lee <br> Burusu Lee <br> Bruce Lee <br> Rock Lee <br> Metal Lee </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying it wasn't an earthquake. </br>  <br>According to UNS4  He can use a Human sized Susanoo arm </br>  <br>I honestly think the only reason Kishimoto left Sasuke armless is to give him that 'yolo i don't give a fuck i don't need it' vibe.<br><br> It didn't even slightly work </br></br></br>    <br>It's a cake. It's not like he hit Himawari or he's pissed off at her.</br>  <br>At least Sasuke can't hog all the arm rests</br>  <br>also related</br>  <br> those eyes <br>Jesus fuck they were always horrifying. And only Lee had them.</br></br>  <br> no cupholders <br>What kind of backwards ass society is this?</br></br>  <br>These sort of life changing events always end up having unintended consequences.</br>    <br>Konoha hasn't figured it out yet, man. <br>Or maybe they have a cup no jutsu, or something.</br></br>  <br>You know, I really didn't like Neji to begin with, but I was pretty devastated by his death.<br><br><br>  He has a false arm created just so Sarada can't have an arm rest, and never uses it again after the movies, except when it can inconvenience his daughter. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Do nips do cup holders.</br>    <br> Smartphones and laptops <br> Model T <br> No Cupholders <br> Entire cities <br>I have no idea how their technology fucking works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;This rebellious runt gets in fights all the time but is always sweet to his little sister Himawari <br>I really like that. Reminds me the chemistry of the Elric brothers. Ed always being a little shit while also being excessively protective towards his little brother. <br>He evens has the same daddy issues as Ed.</br></br></br>  <br>How the fuck does that works?</br>  <br> More like team die amirite. </br>  <br>tenten</br>  <br>Looks like a form of chakra modulator that has been modified to allow the moulding of chakra with one hand, like Haku did. So if a shinobi is captured and his hands are tied, if he can remember the alternative hand seals, he can still perform jutsu.<br><br>Alternatively, it looks scroll-related - perhaps the shinobi can store miniature scrolls in the wrist brace for quick, off-guard jutsu using that requires few hand seals.</br></br></br>  <br>People have murdered over less severe things in this universe.</br>  Am I the only one who haven't seen The Last yet? I've been waiting seven months for this movie, holy shit, when will it be available for download?  <br>Hell, Bort still has a CRT monitor and a game system from the early 2000s.</br>  <br>If that's not reason enough to act like a little shit, I don't know what is.</br>  <br>He's also a blonde manlet. Shortest kid of his generation. Not as short as his father was at that age, though.</br>  I don't even know why I thought that a new beginning might make the manga about ninjas again.  <br>Tomorrow, you faggot.</br>  <br> Happy birthday to the ground! <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gAY<wbr>L5H46QnQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>It did. For 2/3rds of the movie, which is probably the longest Kishi's gone without ruining something with powerlevels. <br><br><br> Tomorrow <br>Nice. I need to watch it again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny just how much butthurt this image has caused ever since that trailer released.<br><br>We'll probably get a little bit more of that scene in the next trailer.</br></br></br>  <br>it was always about wizards you dumb shit.</br>    <br>No, at the start it was about ninjas with powers.<br>Now it's about arch-mages.</br></br>    <br><br>I wonder if there'll be one for the new Team 7.</br></br>  <br>So were they the weakest team in the Leaf's history?</br>  <br>Just got past the chapter in the manga (again) of Asuma dying.<br><br>Watching Kurenai just crumple when Shikamaru gives her the news is legitimately heartbreaking.</br></br></br>    <br>The anime actually does that arc better than the manga. They saved up their animation budget, and they also add a lot of ambiance, with shots of Shikamaru wandering around the village, seeing children playing and stuff like that.</br>  <br>One of these things is not like the other ones.</br>  <br>Nah, Ino Shika Chou was definitely the weakest from the past generation.</br>  <br> housewife <br> housewife to the Hokage <br> teacher <br> fucked a cat lady <br> their combined victories can be counted on 1 hand <br>Yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This picture reminds me of JoJo for some reason.</br>  <br> Water Dragons and waterfalls <br> Not a mage. </br></br>  <br>Wow, look at hinata's face.<br><br>She can't be doing with this, ended up in the team with an insect fetishist, a fucking loser and the most useless jounin in the village.</br></br></br>  <br>Is that a bijuu arm?</br>  <br>Goddamn creepy ass Sand niggers.</br>  <br> every day is insects and the smell of wet dog <br> Kurenai taught them jack shit and spent most of her time getting railed by Asuma  <br> always came back smelling like cigarettes </br></br></br>  <br>it's whatever you want it to be bby</br>  <br>So is anyone going to get promoted this time around?</br>  <br>I actually thought they were pretty competent during part 1. You know, doing ninja stuff like scouting.<br><br>Actually, every team looked more competent than team 7. Nobody in team 7 could do anything remarkable and what little abilities they had didn't work together.<br><br>Then they learned to explode cities with a single punch.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>On the bright side Netori might be fun to play as in UNS4.</br>  <br>A mate sent me a link to the scene of Shikamaru screaming in his house and I gotta say it didn't really do it for me.

The toes are too short and the body of teh foot is too large, particularly the heel and the ball of the foot. <br>It's a female foot, so try to make it more slender, as well.</br></br>  I want to protect that blush.  <br><br>Who is this cute boy?</br></br>  Is Riu just stupid or a literal retard?  <br>Once he's a literal  corpse  next episode, that won't matter anymore.</br>  <br>But he did the right thing.</br>  <br>No. He was just super optimistic and naive.</br>  <br>Well, it was either that or giving VAPE the pretext to actually start killing people.</br>  <br>And now he has shown them that they can basically demand everything. Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes?</br>  <br>When you think about it, it reinforced people's disdain and hate for VAPE, making the red-haired guy's plan less likely to succeed.</br>  <br>No? He was portrayed as the good guy. Even if he dies (and he won't die), he'll go as a well beloved martyr and vape will be the bad guy.<br><br>Didn't you see the obvious OPINION-SHIFT on the people which were all turned against Vape? Rui's nobility touched them.</br></br></br>  <br>Exactly. Whatever Rizumu does now, he'll lose. Rui put him in a no win situation.<br><br>People will no longer support him and he comes across as weak willed psycho who breaks his ideals while Rui comes across as too pure for this sinful world who is strong in his ideals. <br><br>He's just cornered and made himself everyone's hateful enemy not to mention he assaulted someone LIVE. He can be arrested with evidence now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Too bad he is about to be burnt to a crisp by Tsubasa  <br><br>I just finished the first season of this and it was very good, how is the second fairing up so far?</br></br>  This anime is why you should kill anyone that vapes.  <br>It hasn't really gone anywhere yet, Hajime gets some unusual focus cuts to imply that maybe something is wrong with her and the new Gatchaman is a qt hothead.<br><br>It's fun though, new OP is great.</br></br></br>  <br>This. There's a reason hostage negotiations include having snipers ready to take out the hostage taker.</br>  Do you think Joe was 100% right?  <br>Joe is always right</br>  <br>Why didn't Joe die in the first season?</br>  <br>He got his note tore off, but Katze didn't stab it.</br>  <br>Will he die this season at least?</br>  <br> joe <br> The guy who is always proved wrong <br><br>Anon... when the antagonist and joe make a point, expect it be the opposite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crowds is about RuiRui suffering, not Joe. Joe gets the happy ending.</br>  <br>Because female audience would drop it.</br>  <br>Joe is my least favorite character and the show would improve for me if he died  I'm a grill btw </br>  <br>Joe needs more Bird Missiles for a happy ending.</br>  <br>OP has amazing visuals.<br>ED is not as good as the previous one but passable.<br>First episode was a good first episode. <br>Second was more exposition heavy.<br>And now we got to the Rui suffering in half the time of the previous season!</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, Joe is always right. If Joe saids the sky is green then the sky is green.</br>  <br>i hope he die</br>  <br>This, Rui is pretty much series' messianic figure, of course he'll be proven right in the end, Joe is just some capefag wannabe.</br>  <br>If he does die it would probably be near the end because he is one of the more popular characters (according to pixiv anyways). Maybe he is still depressed deep down but not enough to be suicidal. Joe is the only male eye candy so the female audience might go down. Carrot doesn't count because he is a cunt and Rui is eye candy for both genders.</br>  So who sponsored all the tablets they were giving for free to everyone?  <br>Except he's not entirely right.</br>  <br>That reminds me of some experiments in social psychology.</br>  <br>As much as I hate carrot, he does have a point. There are good people and there are shit people. Something Rui doesn't seem to understand. Joe doesn't really want to be a messiah. He just wants to protect people. He doesn't seem to like much attention. Out of all the gatchas he is the one that appears less in public. Joe understands that there is evil people out there. I don't know how the show is going to prove Rui right.</br>  <br>Well you have to use the public funds for SOMETHING</br>  <br>It's the power of being attractive</br>  <br>Rui is naive in his idealism but carrot does not have a point. Crowds are a tool just like any other. A bad person can take a knife and go stabbing spree, a bad person can take a car and drive it into a crowd, that's not a reason to ban knives or cars. <br>There is always a risk, it's simply a matter of pros outweighing the cons.</br></br>  <br>Me too. I hate cross dressers like him.</br>  <br>You won't be able to anon. We all know what route Tsubasa will go.</br>  <br> his accuracy with the darts matches how accurate his words are <br>DEEP</br></br>  <br>The show already proved Rui right last season, when him giving out the crowds to everyone didn't turn into a massive bloody clusterfuck. You can either love or hate how optimist the show's worldview is, but it's part of the suspension of disbelief. Hajime has that worldview too (the boys who won't give up their seat on the bus are probably tired, the wife of the man who was speeding with his car had just gone into labour) and she is always shown to be in the right.<br><br>Anyway, Rui has clearly looked up Rizumu and deduced he couldn't have been that bad (in fact, if he really were evil he would have gone along with Katze's plan as soon as he had his chance), so it's not even about Rui naively believing that there are no evil people.<br><br><br>Yeah, I'm not sure. What other motivation could they have?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Senran Kagura is the best Gatchaman.  So did Rizumu not have the balls to use his Crowds right away, or was he just not interested until Rui's idealism rubbed him the wrong way?  <br>Maybe he was busy studying. <br>I'm pretty sure he is a decent person who snapped, possibly after losing someone to the incident in Tachikawa. (How long have the red crowds been active, anyway?)</br></br>  <br>I don't get it that's what I said. I mean Rui believes everyone is good deep down in their hearts which is not true.</br>  <br><br><br>Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you. That's the basis of their concept. <br><br>Rizumu destroyed his credibility to have a point when Katze cheered up for him and became a knife-wielding psycho.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity. That's why villains are always attacking him or try to corrupt him. His resolution and his pain are important for the outcome of all. First season, it was about Katze and Hajime tug-fight for Rui, this one Rizumu and maybe Tsubasa join the fold for it.<br><br>He's like the mecha pacifist princess, only male.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Joe can do no wrong.</br>  <br>Alcoholizing Sugane was pretty wrong. Remmeber when Sugane was an earnest diligent boy. Now he's a drunkard.</br>  <br> mecha pacifist princess <br>All he is missing is a song, but I think the White Ash lead singer's got that covered.</br></br>    <br>Why is Utsu-tsu the most underrated girl on the show?</br>  <br>Hajime is way more of a senran.</br>  <br>Word<br><br><br>It's good because Sugane enjoyed it. Joe can't do no wrong. Sugane knows Joe is best boy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tsubasa will fuck Rui. <br><br>Hotblooded hero mc gets peace princess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish, but<br> Crowds <br> romantic development <br>Choose one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have enough dick to please Rui.</br>  <br>She's more manly than anyone in the cast. Even Paiman is girlier.</br>  <br>Because if they tried that shit again, then it's no longer the Gatchaman's fault for any other deaths that occurred. No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. Now it's up to Vape to prove they can honor any other agreements from that point on. And until then, it would be no quarters from everyone else.</br>  <br>Hotblooded hero mc who fucks up the peace princess Honorable Sacrifice doesn't deserve shit. <br><br>Anyway Sugane and Joe saved Rui first, Tsubasa needs to respect seniority.</br></br></br>  <br>No, not really. The moment Tsubasa intervene, he won. Now he can say he meant every word he said, but because the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations, they are the ones that broken the agreement. They are the ones that can no longer be trusted. Any further deaths will be on their heads now.</br>  <br>Hajime needs a tragic backstory to be a Senran</br>  <br> No one will be sympathetic to their cause anymore once they broken their trust. <br><br>But Gelsadra absorbed everyone insight and they were against Vape.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Sugane and Joe have each others.</br></br>  <br><br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br> Rui is said to be the character who reflects the future of humanity <br>Where was this said?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sugane feels the need to apologize for everything he does <br> Joe turned him into an alcoholic <br><br>Nice and healthy.</br></br></br></br>   mfw Rizumin and Tsubasa have reversed eye/hair colors   <br>That's because no one has died yet and they haven't learn what the full details of the discussion. If someone had died and Rui could have prevented it, it will cause massive backlash. They all saw Rui willingly give away his Note, that means he accepted whatever deal VAPE has proposed. Now that the agreement has been ruined by Gel and Tsubasa's intervention, they now share part of the responsibility for any other deaths.</br>    <br>Fuck, it's true.</br>    <br> the Gatchaman tried to attack him during negotiations <br><br>I doubt stabbing somebody to death is "negotiating"</br></br></br>  <br>You should have found the back of Sugane's head for good measure.</br>    <br>Being manly != having a dick</br>  <br>Rui willingly gave him the Note and told the others to stay away. Rizumin's plan probably required someone to come and stop him since he knows if he actually stabbed Rui to death through the Note, it would only make him into a martyr and spurn the populace into fully adopting Crowds. Rui and Hajime probably knows this and didn't interfere because they know Rizumin can't follow through with it for the reasons above.<br><br>By having someone come and intervene, no matter how it looked, they now share responsibility in any eventual deaths as well as prove that just because Rui believed in him, doesn't mean other people will. The same applies to the Crowds system. There has to be trust between everyone for it to function properly.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, if Rui could call lying in a pool of his own blood a "fight"...</br>  More Rui suffering next week?  <br>Maybe next time he should communicate his plan with the rest of the team.</br>  <br>It's not like there was much time. The rest of the team should trust him to make the right decision and respect his wishes.</br>  <br>From Tsubasas perspective it did look like he was dying for nothing.</br>  <br>Tsubaka.</br>  <br>Never discuss about Symphogear and Gatachaman at the same time.</br>  <br>Utsubasa.</br>  <br>When OD, Hajime and Rui all say not to interfere, it's a good sign that you shouldn't interfere. But I think that's the point they're trying to make. Both Hajime and Tsubasa has a tendency to rush into things, but one does it based on logic and reasoning while the other based on instinct and emotions. It's a nice contrast between the ideology between the two heroines, while providing a parallel to Rui and Rizumin. There's no right or wrong ways, just different ways of doing things.</br>  <br>O.D. had *just* finished explaining everything to her.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways <br>I get what you are saying, but even if you act on emotions and instinct alone you still need to respect other people wishes. Especially if it's your first day on the job!</br></br>  <br>Will Rui´s elephant say "Tuskete"?</br>  <br>And ultimately, she was prepared to accept the responsibility of defying other people's wishes. OD told her as such and she accepted. She couldn't stand suffering, even if it's the logical thing to do. Kinda like the sacrifice one to save many mentality. Logically, it is a good trade-off, but she just can't accept such a sacrifice and willing to bear the burden of saving that one life.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways, <br><br>But in the end Rui's way will be the 'right way'</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, in the end, it will be a compromise. Rizumin will become co-admin of the Crowds system or something.</br>  <br>Probably but next episode they are going to portray her way as bad.</br>  <br>Doubtful. It's a bit too early for that. They'll probably raise Tsubasa and Gel on a pedestal for a while for saving Rui's life and ask why the other Gatchaman didn't help. Build both of them up as the true saviors before having them come crashing down and causing Gel to turn evil in the process. Then understanding and hand-holding happens, and suddenly everyone fights as a team and an understanding ending occurs. Oh, and Katz probably goes crazy at one point because someone had hurt Hajime.</br>  <br>Why would Katze go crazy about someone hurting Hajime?</br>  <br>Because it's clear that he likes her. He's a massive tsundere when it comes to her. No amount of his bullshit works on her, she saw him in his real self and still accepted him. It's true love.</br>  Next episode is called 2-6-2, so we'll probably hear more of Rizumu's ideas.<br><br><br>Agreed. It works with the presenter saying he liked the two of them and with the titles of the episode being marketing terms (or so I've heard?)</br></br></br>  <br>2:6:2 is what, a bell curve?</br>  <br><br>I think so. First time I've heard the term.</br></br>   2-6-2 <br> Under the Whyte notation system, a steam locomotive that has two leading wheels, six coupled driving wheels, and two trailing wheels. <br>Wait what? Probably not it.</br></br>  <br>The thought of Katze being protective of Hajime instead of delighting in her suffering and the world burning around her is dishearteningly boring.</br>  <br>They're essentially the same person though. No one will be able to understand them more than each other. He might want her to adopt his viewpoints, but losing what amounts to his soulmate? Never.</br>    <br>I can't tell if you're a retarded troll or a just a retard.</br>  Is Rui transgender or just a crossdresser?  <br>Just a crossdresser.</br>  <br>Hajime called him a boy and he didn't correct her.</br>  <br> Who stops them from taking hostages again and demand the other notes? <br>Hajime.</br></br>  <br><br>Creators confirm he's just a crossdresser. I think OD's gender is unconfirmed though.</br></br>  <br> O.D was born and raised on a distant planet between a native and an Earth human. O.D gained their NOTE through some unknown event. One day, Berg Katse appeared and had the people of O.D's planet turn on each other. O.D found Katse and fought him in their Gatchaman form and while they managed to damage Katse, they ended up destroying his home planet. Katse had thought that O.D was dead when they really just went to Earth.  <br><br>I guess I really should finish S1</br></br></br>  <br><br>I always thought OD was just a gayy lmao.</br></br>  <br> &gt;O.D was born and raised on a distant planet between a native and an Earth human. <br>So there's other humans in space? What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Maybe it was a Gatchaman who traveled.</br>  <br> There's no right or wrong ways, just different ways of doing things. <br>What you say is correct but it doesn't mean you're right.</br></br>  <br> red crowds and blue crowds? I don't care, I just want to protect everyone even if that doesn't answer your question! <br> he's fighting for his principles? I don't care, I just want to protect everyone even if it makes his sacrifice completely pointless! <br><br>Truly the worst Gatcha. Does that everyone she wants to protect include Rizumin? Because if it doesn't she's just a hypocrite full of shit that only wants to save people she handpicks. That's not really everyone.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Truly the worst Gatcha <br>Joe is a faggot but at least he has a reason to exist. Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change.</br></br>  <br> Joe is a faggot but at least he has a reason to exist. <br>What reason? Make Sugane an alcoholic?<br><br> Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change. <br>Sure. There wouldn't even be a S2 because everyone would be dead.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Utsutsu is OD's daughteru. He needs her.</br>  <br>"Utsuutsu shimasu" is an extremely important line, you know.</br>  <br> Utsutsu could be straight-up removed from the series and nothing would change. <br>True, but that would be a terrible decision. Plus, Hajime got some cool dialogue from scenes with her.</br></br>  <br><br>Also be sure to watch the ep0.<br>Looks like they had to fit (again) 15 minutes or so of extra content outside the 12 eps to make things clear.<br>At leat they did it in advance this time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still have no clue about how that single line gets subbed with tons of different meanings depending on what people are talking about.</br>  <br> What reason? Make Sugane an alcoholic? <br>Sugane's character in general (including making him an alcoholic), and getting beat up like a bitch by Katze.<br><br> Sure. There wouldn't even be a S2 because everyone would be dead. <br>I can't actually remember any time she healed another Gatchaman. The only scene I remember of her using her healing powers for some practical purpose was the one in the tunnel from S1.<br><br><br><br><br>I don't really hate her either, she's cute, but she's also by far the most useless character. It's like she exists only because they really wanted a loli in a swimsuit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Last time it was because they didn't have it ready on time, not because they ran out of time.</br>  <br>She healed O.D and Joe and is pretty obvious she's the one healing others in the background. She'll probably save Rui from certain death too. If you think Joe is useful for Sugane's development I don't understand why you can't see Utsutsu was good for other character's to see Hajime's influence, like O.D or Joe. Joe was motivated by Utsutsu wanting to help others with her life in the tunnel.</br>  <br>She exists to show how Hajime changed everyone and also to, you know, heal Joe, Sugane and eventually Rui after they were beat up by Katze? That tiny little turning point of the season.</br>  <br> because they didn't have it ready on time, not because they ran out of time <br>Those are the same thing.</br></br>  <br>Not really. Running out of time means 12 episodes weren't enough, they needed more. Not having the episode ready on time means they could have done it in 12 episodes, but they didn't have the episode ready when it was due so they filled half of it with a recap. If they came up with episode 00 that suggests 12 episodes weren't enough for Insight.</br>  <br>Correct me if i'm wrong, but wasn't ep12 of S1 a regular 20-ish minutes one? <br>Because then either they planned to get a longer slot and didn't get it/have the content ready on time or they actually underestimated the runtime of the plot they planned.</br></br>  So is this episode the reason Rui's shadow is X? I don't expect him to die, but maybe he'll become more integrated with X?  <br><br>The impact Hajime had on her was far smaller than on most other characters, and I don't think Joe was really motivated as much as just empathetic towards her. I guess healing people in the background is a legit feat though, a bit plot device-y but definitely important.</br></br>  They ran out of time for the animators to actually animate. Tatsunoko Pro has really shit schedules. Did you guys miss half of the animation for the Yatterman Night finale being missing and the animators apologizing on Twitter and telling people to wait for BD?  <br>Geez Hajime, how does your director allow you to have two frames in the opening?</br>  <br>It was regular length. They didn't have ep 11 done in time, so they added a recap for half of it. This pushed half of 11 into 12, so there had to be a director's cut so we could see what was supposed to be in 12.</br>  <br>OD seriously puts my straightness to the test.</br>  <br>MmmmmMMmmmmm it's almost like she is not alone in there</br>  <br>The other anon explained it all. In order for episode 12 not to be cut off completely they tried to fit in as much as possible by cutting bits here and there but it was worse that way in my opinion. Everything was confusing and some of the international releases don't even come with the director's cut so there's people who never watched it. It would have been better to try to get another timeslot for it later on or release an OVA and end episode 12 with a cliffhanger.</br>  I want to leave it to Sadra  <br> Did you guys miss half of the animation for the Yatterman Night finale being missing and the animators apologizing on Twitter and telling people to wait for BD? <br>No, but that didn't have any holes in the plot that will need extra content, it's just that they didn't make in time with all the needed cuts and had to work out with what was avaible.<br><br>It's kind of strange to think the same Tatsunoko delivered a nearly flawless YZQ just few months after Crowds S1 and a year before Yatterman.<br> Tablets magic <br><br><br><br>I see, i completely forgot about the recap in ep 11.<br> It would have been better to try to get another timeslot for it later on <br>Just as Kekkai Sensen then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I actually really like Tsubasa.<br>Am I the only one?</br></br>    <br>Hell no you aren't. Where'd you get that idea.</br>  <br>She needs to get a bit of her shonen protagonist hotheadness sorted out, but otherwise she's alright.</br>  <br>Unconfirmed-gender aliens are fair game. I'd do it.</br>  <br> Joe  <br> not looking at Sugane like he just spiked his drink <br>The style reminds me of Kinako but there's just no way.</br></br></br>  <br> Rui and Hajime are supposed to be advanced human beings more enlightened than you <br><br>Does this have something to do with Rui being Gatcha 100 and Hajime Gatcha 101?<br><br>Maybe anybody after 100s is suppose to be a new kind of human.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hajime gives Rizumu her Note with Katze inside and then Katze drives him insane by his endless shtitpost. It's a perfect plan.</br>  <br>is this some kind of new BD cover?</br>    <br>Where'd you get it?</br>  <br><br>Found it: it's from kinako's twitter : https://twitter.com/kamabokoita<br><br> Guy that I was thinking the cover of the old wants Design Works Once old folder watching  <br><br>I think it's one of the first sketches for the Design Works cover</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>OD is confirmed as non male by the director. When he's asked what sleepwear and what underwear do his male characters wear, he mentions Rui's and Katze's (with Sugane's and Joe) but omits OD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, her ero Twitter is locked. What a shame. I wonder if she has porn Gatcha art there.</br>  <br>Interviews.<br><br>When first season started, Rui and Hajime were called "new human beings" that heralded the future.<br><br>Before season, they explained Rui's symbolic role and why Katze and Hajime basically fought over his heart. When he chose to believe in himself, the plot solved itself.<br><br>Right now, Rui's not believing in himself, despite his actions, because he got troubled and isolated from the Gatcha and there's a new antagonist who is unsurprisingly predatory on him. They'll always be predatory on Rui because he's the one who holds the key to the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Guy that I was thinking the cover of the old wants Design Works Once old folder watching  <br>My sides.<br><br>"I get nostalgic when I look at old folders. I was thinking about the Design Works's cover at the time"</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thank you anon.</br>  <br>I always thought they were so predatory on Rui because he looked like such a perfect rapebait fuccboi that even straight males don't care.</br>  <br>...Close enough.<br><br>Thank you!</br></br></br>  <br>What sleepwear DO the guys wear?</br>    <br>Utsutsu had an arc in the first season, she's also OD's daughteru, and has lesbian love with Hajime and potential straight love with Rui.<br><br>I'll be mad this Tsubasa bitch replaced her.</br></br></br>  <br> those hips <br><br>How can a boy have those hips?</br></br></br>  <br>That's purposeful. Rui was female originally. He's always been the show heroine among the heroes.</br>  <br>The song that plays when Rui's alone and Katze is creepy on him is a song of a leopard stalking his prey. No shit.</br>  <br>They are predatory because Rui's role is of main heroine. They just changed his gender.</br>  <br>My moonreading abilities are still green but if it helps, I couldn't ask for more.</br>  <br>I can't believe OD ditched based Baracchi for that green fat faggot.</br>  Friendly reminder that green faggot will have part of the blame for Gelsadra taking over humanity.    <br/>  Tsubasa is right  <br>This is "Why couldn't you protect this smile" in gif form.</br>  <br>The eye twitches are so good.</br>  <br> blood not changed to white color <br>Why did I even expect anything good?</br></br>  <br>This scene deserves a webm, not a gif.</br>  <br>I'm sure OD knows the dude is a cunt, he's just there for show.</br>  <br>Hes such a bad trap you can always tell its a boy no mater how many tricks he uses. <br><br>But doesn't that oddly also make hing a far better trap?</br></br></br>  <br>Anon i would do it if the scene didn't make me feel so uneasy...

I'd assumed we'd have public LQ raws out by now, but it doesn't look like it, from as much as I've seen or heard.<br><br>I've ordered my magazine, and while I'm hoping it'll get to my place before Thursday, most likely it'll be delivered while I'm out of town, which means no HQ raws/live TL for a good week and a half, sadly.<br><br>However, once I get everything in, it should only take a day or two for the chapter itself to come out, so you don't have to worry about another three-month delay.<br><br>I shouldn't have any kind of delay for next month, though. Hooray!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I propose a water (or jelly) filled bladder in a daki shape. When shall we begin?  <br>Thanks for the update.</br>  <br>TF   where did you buy the magazine? actually I can only find expensive shit instead of the price when the adaptation was just a myth  </br>  <br>I used to import it from Amazon.jp + a forwarding company, but the forwarding company took so long to process things (2+ weeks?!) that I switched over to CD Japan not too long ago, and I've been really happy with their shipping times.<br><br>Usually I get the magazine in 3-4 days after I order. They've been really helpful when I fuck up and send it to the wrong place, too.</br></br></br>  Rachnee and Cerea are best girls  An ogre is blending into this thread, can you spot her?  <br>she's like an onion</br>  <br> Yes. <br><br> All girls are best girls though. </br></br></br>  <br>Nope <br><br>  mero a shit A SHIIIIITTTT <br><br>  sorry TF I know you self insert on her  </br></br></br></br></br>  Obviously Lala is best.  <br> Rachne and Cerea  and Suu  happen to be even better than the rest. <br><br>Hi-res when?</br></br></br>  <br><br>High tier: &gt;2 legs<br>Mid tier: 2 legs<br>Low tier: &lt;2 legs</br></br></br></br>  <br>/r ing mermaids are quick to recognize lewdness, i know you have it</br>  <br>Do not trust this poster.

From what I heard from Cerea's when I skimmed through it, it was something about helping you fall asleep.

Go on lang8 and write anything you'd like. It's really easy to make "friends" there, get their skype and type away. This  is also a good advice, though I'd argue that it's still far less effective than directly speaking to someone while forming your own thoughts. Unless you're really fucked up in the head making a Japanese friend with whom you could speak via skype doesn't sound too hard. There are plenty of people asking for English &lt;-&gt; Japanese exchanges.</br>  <br>My best friend wants me to learn japanese, because she fucking loves japan and japanese things and I guess saying japanese words to me sometimes.<br><br>I like giving in to her demands so<br><br>Where would I even start casually learning how to read and write daily japanese words and phrases for practical use?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nothing happens. what am i doing wrong.</br>  <br>I was thinking of using iTalki or something, but I'm pretty much broken.

Most of the discussion of Japanese media here is confined to porn manga and VNs.</br></br></br>  <br>well I didn't really mean "full" as in having all the skills<br><br>I just meant that people here aren't learning only parts of the language so they can pick up common phrases in anime/manga<br>we are learning the full language. Even if we don't care to build conversation skills</br></br></br></br>  <br> the discussions would be of much higher quality <br> /jp/ </br></br>  <br> If there were so many /a/ regulars in these threads then there would be much more anime and manga discussion. Most of the discussion of Japanese media here is confined to porn manga and VNs. <br>That's just because watching raw anime is much more difficult than reading raw VNs. People aren't going to be doing the former until they have studied for 2+ years and have likely left this thread. It is also because anime is already subbed so you don't NEED to learn japanese to watch anime. But neither of those mean that the people here aren't watching anime as well.</br></br>  <br>If you are serious, you can learn it in less than a week. I learned Hiragana and Katakana in 5 days. <br><br>Just sit down at your desk with a Hiragana chart by your side and start writing down as many symbols as you want. I started with 25 a day, but you can do 10 or 15.<br><br>あ　い　う　え　お<br>か　き　く　け　こ<br>さ　し　す　せ　そ<br><br>Just write down those fuckers until you are tired. <br><br>Then go to http://realkana.com/hiragana/ and train your recognition. Repeat that and you should be fine. It's boring, but I don't see other way to do it that fast.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thinking of moving to Japan for a while in order to learn by immersion. Anyone have any tips for me before I go?  How am I supposed to learn Katakana?<br>I already learned Hiragana, but why do I need a whole nother alphabet of bullshit.</br>  <br>ugh</br>  <br>Don't, skip it and learn romanji for katakana words.</br>  <br>How am I supposed to learn upper case?<br>I already learned lower case, but why do I need a whole nother alphabet of bullshit.=</br></br>  <br><br>This. Don't listen to the trolls that tell you that you need to learn it. They're just pissed they went and did it and it was for nothing.<br><br>Mostly anything that needs Katakana is actually written in English anyways.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You need to actually learn, even if you're there. Just being there alone (or even worse, being there and only conversing with other foreigners) won't teach you anything.</br>  How much of Tae Kims guide do i need to read before i start reading literature and jap media? I realy hate reading grammar so i just want to start reading manga and watching anime  To all the regulars of /djt/, I never thought I'd say this since you guys are pretentious faggots constantly arguing about learning methods but, I love you guys.<br><br>Summer is rough.</br></br>  <br>It depends on how much you want to suffer. I recommend at least the basic section. Watching anime will take some time, but you can start with Yotsubato right now. Just download the free reading pack for Vol. 1 and give it a try.</br>  <br>Fuck off im doing my reps<br> Love you too /a/non now get back to study </br></br>  <br><br><br>I try to repeat the pronunciation for some example sentences of Core 6k. I'm going try to do that more. <br><br>As for Lang8, I tried using it. I guess I'll publish more posts over there. People usually correct stuff, but never had luck of finding a language partner.</br></br></br></br></br>  Did anyone use or is currently using Tobira? I'm liking that shit, but when I get at the practice sections, the book asks stuff about the text like:<br><br>袋入りラーメンとカップラーメンとどちらの方がよく食べられていますか。そ<wbr>れはどうしてですか。<br><br>And I keep staring at the page like a moron. If I open notepad (because I can't handwrite) and spend a couple minutes, I can come up with an answer, but most of the times, it is utter shit.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Try to correct people as well (Japanese people that is), that can be a good conversation starter. Set a nice profile picture and be friendly, act nice, even if it feels out of character.</br>  Has anyone here tried this deck http://japaneselevelup.com/japanese<wbr>-level-up-rtk-mod-anki-deck/ and if yes was it worth it / good?<br>I like the concept but so far it's been slightly frustrating, showing words with only half of their Kanji and letting you guess what's missing is kinda odd. If only there was furigana it'd be fine but there's not, and I don't really feel like adding that to 1900 cards.</br></wbr>  <br>Well, I'm kind of a leech over there I'd say. I get corrected everytime, but very rarely correct stuff for people. I'll try doing that more. Thanks for the tip.</br>  <br>Do you ever get contradicting corrections?</br>  <br>Well, I don't know if that's contradicting, but there were times when two people corrected a particular mistake differently, or one considered something all right, while other corrected it.</br>  you can't be serious who the fuck typed this  <br>Someone smarter than you, apparently.</br>  <br><br>When I first started I never corrected anyone's post because I was too scared. Now it's sort of working out pretty well.</br></br>  You are now tasked with translating Spurdo pictures into Japanese. How do you go about it?  <br>ファッグ</br>  <br>Looks like a transcription error. CoRくん probably didn't see this while fixing typos, since it's in the new deck (yours is outdated). The sentence has "映画" instead of "英語" in the original entry in the DoJG. Doesn't really take long to fix and there aren't a ton of typos like this, so it's not really a big deal.<br><br> Also, reminder that you're supposed to read the entries in the DoJG as you go through new cards in the deck. The deck and reference page are meant for reviewing, not learning. </br></br></br>  <br>I also don't correct people too much because I learned English playing video games and my grammar is terrible. I feel more comfortable correcting Portuguese, but there's not that much people learning it over there.</br>  <br>挨拶はきちんと<br>よく寝て、よく食べる<br>悩んだら相談！</br></br></br>  <br>x that much<br>* that many</br></br>  <br>DJT is for people who have grew out of /a/, it's basically its own board.</br>  <br>see, that's how shitty my English is.</br>  <br>nah man your english looks like a native wrote it. a lot of native speakers make mistakes way worse than that. some of them don't even use capitalization!</br>   i couldnt request a simple line or three translated into english and romaji in this thread could i?   <br>no, you can't. fuck off</br>  <br>This is actually a pretty good idea, here is a test for beginners</br>  <br>Well, thank you.

This is my fifth time taking a go at Japanese and I haven't even once gotten through all of the hiragana. It just kicks my ass. Anyone know any good advice for this hurdle?
