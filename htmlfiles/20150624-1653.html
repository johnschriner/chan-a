It looks like an elephant who got it's trunk cut off.    Why did he say that if he hadn't any snarky comeback?    It's clear symbolism that Gil himself is just a dinosaur, and that he needs to make way for people like Shirou.    It's an /sp/ meme the city of you</span>     Kek    Does anyone have this without the Ilya attached?    Nah, I just made this because I'm an Ilyafag who really hates Gil.    I wasn't expecting that, and was pleasently surprised. Please let this be a thing.     It's yours, my friend.     Thanks Lori.     Do the students there go to Uruk High?    It looks like the UK to me.     Gil admitting Shirou is strong</span>  Why the fuck would he even do that? He only shows respect to people worthy of respect, and he makes it quite clearly Shirou is not one of those people.   The line just felt so out of place.           He likely starts to change his mind when he has to pull Ea out. Either way the line's in the novel too.    Because he lost. In the VN he did as well, difference was he turned tail and ran before being put down like a bitch with the grail trying to killsteal him from Shirou.      Even if it was in the vn, it was still a pretty poor line. Gil was already going to lose to Shirou, no need to suck his dick even more by having him actually admit Shirou is stronger.      Gil was showing a modicum of respect for Shirou by the end. He even admitted he lost right to the guy's face.  Gil is the type of person who actually kind of starts to fly right when he has someone who can keep him in check. Look at Enkidu.      It's just him admitting defeat. He's still honorable enough to give credit where credit is due, and he still thought he had a chance to survive. He's an arrogant dick but he had no choice but to be humbled when getting so utterly dominated.    Think of it more as Gil trying to find solace in the fact that he lost. He's only saying he's strong to make his lose look better.        what goes around comes around.mp4</span>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-nc<wbr>rDHH3z7g</wbr></span> [ ]    Go up on the wall of Uruk and walk around, examine its foundation, inspect its brickwork thoroughly.

Ten years after UBW, Rin, Shirou and Waver basically fight off the Mage's Association by themselves in the process of permanently destroying the Greater Grail. That's the extent of the details we know, but it is mentioned that the Mage's Association considers being able to create a Reality Marble grounds for an immediate Sealing Designation (read: killing you and studying your body for magic science).     I will never understand the uncalled for hate retards give him.   <span class="quote">&gt;You know, it really hurts to have your hymen torn</span>  I wasn't here when the episode aired. What did people think of this episode? I personally think it deserves a 20/20 but I guess I'm biased.    Initial reaction was people freaking out, with a few people getting autistic about Shirou being able to jump so high.   Why was Archer still alive?   "Yup. There's a limit to what I can do here, so I'm thinking of studying there for about five years.</span> I hear that my dad did the same thing. And it's natural to go to the highest institute of education if you want to be a proper magus, right?"  We know in the very least the next five years or so will be spent at the Clock Tower.       Why would he be dead?    Meant to green text the second line.    9.5/10 They didn't explain how Archer could still be there  and unless I got bad subs Shirou didn't do the chant  Still, that's only taking .5 off from fantastic         It's the Kamiyan    How long into the first term before Luvia falls for Shirou?     Okay thank you     He did the chant, but it was the Japanese version (he does the same in the VN). It technically was bad subs since they didn't use the official Engrish version.    A series of events that started with her delivering a important essay that she wrote led to she and Rin falling from the London Tower. They survived the incident thanks to the intervention of Shirou Emiya, and in the aftermath received the nickname of Mary of July (Luvia) and Poppins of July</span>  Fairly early, I assume.     How did Shirou get so strong? Rather, why was the manga version of UBW so "unique" when it came to the character designs?   Is this for real?    How did Shirou get so strong?</span>  Power leveling with Archer.  Also holy fuck I forgot how bad that manga looked.        that fat man face saber</span>    so wide    Thanks, I'd forgotten there even was a Japanese version    so much gain, /fit/ would be proud    He also gets a part time job as Luvia butler.    Who in Association can even face an older Shirou? He's shit against servants but a common magus will have to get lucky to survive a rain of a fucking noble phantasms and opponent who holds anti-magic swords in hands while moving as a fucking Sanic.     Wait, I meant the Fate version of the manga. I forgot how the original manga changed routes from UBW back to Fate halfway through. The designs used still make me wonder why it went that route.    Shriou gained a lot of muscle in this adaption.       I love it. Shirou should be buff as fuck.    Older Shirou is a toss up. We know he'll likely make plenty of strides later on.  Off the top of my head though, Bazett would take him down in his current state.      Bazett? Probably anyone that didn't come in a howling charge? There's so much fuckery we don't know about, it would probably be easy      Wait, I meant the Fate version of the manga. I forgot how the original manga changed routes from UBW back to Fate halfway through.</span>  Seriously? Glad I never read that. Bait and switch like that would piss me right the fuck off.      Are they gonna go with the Manga Shinji and have him make up with Sakura? That would be so nice.    It pissed me off when I first learned of it a few years back. I thought that UBW would finally have it's own adaption until it suddenly shifted back into Fate.    From what i understand unless he faces a dedicated battle mage as an adult, or ain't backstabbed by some mind magic, it's not even going to be a battle.  For example, what could Tokiomi or fast wheels even do against Shirou who has enough mana to UBW? Launch fireballs when he moves at servant-tier speeds and can deflect them with his swords? Trying to turtle in mercury blob when he can rain it down with noble phantasms?  He's not the absolute top tier, but his special ability for sure makes him a pretty scary opponent, especially if he gains more combat experience.        Well, good things come to those who wait, I suppose.  Funnily enough UBW does have a manga now, though.      It makes sense I guess. I'm happy that all of the other routes for Fate are being adapted. I was getting a bit tired of always getting adaptions of the Fate route every single time.    That happened in the VN too, right? I remember Rin saying she saw Sakura visiting Shinji in the hospital and he was acting different( better)     Damn scans when?    using Caliburn</span> in UBW</span> Wow, good fucking job.      You learn your mythology Gilgamesh isn't the founder of anything. He's the 6th or 7th king of Uruk      A lot of people liked it.    First thing I read was Fate. I still hate the shit out of Gil for being such an obnoxious cockmongler.     He built walls and shits mang.      It technically was bad subs since they didn't use the official Engrish version.</span> The English chant is not a translation of the Japanese chant. It's a completely different poem. One of the same purpose, but a different story nonetheless.  They aren't the same. If anything the big mistake was how Crunchyroll subtitled the chant using Archer's English chant when Rin was going through the chant in her dream. Crunchyroll completely messed up and subtitled the wrong chant.  At the very least they didn't mess up in this episode.       Shirou comments on how Shinji acts now like when they first met which was 2 years before the abuse started    He probably doesn't want to be a magus anymore.    Because he lost to a nobody and he had to justify it somehow to not get his sense of self broken. Are you guys retar... this pathetic place gets worse by day    Do you have a template of this?    Not that guy but here.     I know this is comedy and all, but isn't that their goal since day 1? They both want Angry Manjew to be born but for different reasons, that never changed. Kirei wanted his answer and Gil wanted to kill humanity.         Oh god what the fuck is going on.      Saber lived as a man, and now she looks like one.     That would be great if we didn't already know that he was a spoiled brat as a kid, who wasn't exactly quiet about saying he hated Sakura since she was adopted, but "liked" her because it made him feel superior, and because he didn't know she was the heir yet. He treated her like a second class citizen and got buttmad when it turned out he wasn't the heir. For however much that is worth in that house.  Shirou tends to put Shinji with odd rose colored glasses even when he knew of some abuse. It's why when it gets completely shattered in HF he berates himself over how naive he was.  Then you get into Hollow and his and Shirou's friendship gets more one-sided. He refused to ever step into Shirou's house for no reason whatsoever, when Shirou walked across town to visit him, that scene in Hollow was the first time he ever entered Shirou's place. Plus, most of the character repeatedly say Shirou is Shinji's only friend (not just male friend, his only friend). It seems more like a friendship convenient for Shinji.  Even Nasu saying Shinji socially assassinated people who tried to take advantage of Shirou raises eyebrows if you look at it objectively. Wouldn't a real friend try to help you value yourself more, rather than just slandering other people to help you, then taking advantage of your kindness himself?           those gain.</span>  I am dying.      Gil contributed the least out of the kings of uruk.  All Gil ever did in the end was built a wall around one of the temples in Uruk.  He isn't a founder of anything and he did not flourish the civilization of Mesopotamia.  Are Gilfags treating their fanfiction like facts?            This is honestly one of the funniest things I've seen in a while.      So are the other 5 Kings before him stronger?   The only thing that came to my mind at that moment.   The person who invented written language to unite people, the person who invented the concept of architecture, etc    no need to suck his dick even more by having him actually admit Shirou is stronger.</span> Gil was a coward. When he gets sucked into the black hole he's all like "Come on Shirou, help a nigga out!"     What about them?    tumblr</span> Leave now.     They act like actual kings    Do you mean they were the previous kings of Uruk?    Thinking about it, since the ancient language can control modern people in the Nasuverse, why doesn't Gil use that to fuck around?    Because Servants are under the Babelfish effect.    Can't you see the link between Enkidu and Shirou you dumbfuck.    Dependa on your definition of "strong" Gilgamesh is "surpassing of all kings" partly because he got raised as co-ruler of the underworld after his death    Since the Epic of Gilgamesh is just the first written story, would the hero in the first spoken story told by cavemen be stronger than him?   Actual power during life is a big fucking deal, Anon. Even without any boosts from age or whatnot, Gilgamesh (and Enkidu for that matter) was still retardedly powerful during life.    What about dinosaurs? Everybody loves dinosaurs, there's T-Rexes everywhere even today.    Same voice actor, actually. Probably not an accident.    mage goes full Night At The Museum during the holy grail war</span> I want it     This.    The person who invented written language to unite people,</span>     GIRUGAMESH    Daily reminder that secondaries mad tears will continue to fall during this year, when Illya fucks him apart in prisma.   In fact, it makes no sense that Gil is defeated so easily, but Shirou is the hero, and the hero has to overcome in some way the villan (and let's face it, is a good battle).  In each cas, I like that Gil admits defeat, although he is a jerk, it's still a heroic spirit. In video games he is quite fun to have him as servant. He's a character who needs a friend who supports and guides him, in which case he can becomes a hero.  left alone is too eccentric and lazy and end up doing shit.        And in Heaven's Feel, when Sakura eats him.    I'm a newfag about Fate. What role has Gil in Heaven?    He warns Sakura and gets eaten later.    Pretty much the same as in other routes -bothering Sakura- only this time certain someone snaps and offs him a lot sooner.    Pulling out Ea is an acknowledgement of strength in itself.     So why in Fate route did Kirei and Gil just kidnap Illya and use her as the Grail (her intended purpose after all) but in Unlimited Blade Works they came up with this hairbrained scheme to rip out her heart and stick it in some other magus?     Gil for some reason completely changes his objectives between the Fate and UBW route. In Fate he doesn't give a crap about humanity being filled with mongrels so he goes with Kotomine's plan. In UBW he doesn't give a shit about Seiba and just wants to raise hell on earth.    He pulled out Ea AND admitted that Shirou was stronger than him, I don't know what you don't understand about Gil learning he was wrong in his initial assessment of Shirou.    For some it is difficult to accept that Gilg, despite everything, has an honorable side.    The bait is strong in this one.     Using the Grail means giving birth to AM, it was the same in every route, but the reader saw the full picture only in HF. Fate isn't even difficult, you just need to pay attention.      We know Gil has an honorable side. <s>In F/Z, he let Waver live because Waver chose to live on as Broskander's servant, rather than fight him and die as a Master.</s>     He never got to pull out Ea. In the anime, he never even says Shirou is stronger, but he does concede that he's won because pushing Gil as far as he did means defeat in itself.    Yeah, like in Heaven's Feel when he went to kill Sakura because she was killing too many people.    Gil loves humanity a lot, sadly, we are garbage compared to the humanity he protected.    She didn't deserve it. I'm glad she's happy in Prisma.    Part of which is his own fault.    Gilgamesh is old as balls, and when you're old as balls everything seems worse than when you were young.    "Back in my day..."</span>   So if Shirou actually rested a bit in F/SN and didn't get the shit beaten out of him every single day and let his circuits recharge, would he have had enough mana to cast UBW on his own? Will he ever be able to cast it on his own?   So if Shirou actually rested a bit in F/SN and didn't get the shit beaten out of him every single day and let his circuits recharge, would he have had enough mana to cast UBW on his own?</span>  Yes, I believe so. Fucking Rin was just like him taking a stop off at the Pokemon Center to get a recharge.  It's stated that Fate Shirou, the Shirou who didn't learn to summon UBW, would be able to get the basics in 10 years, and master it in another 10. UBW Shirou already has the basics, so he'll probably be a complete master by his mid 20s.        If by that you mean "lived in fear of all their neighbours" then yes. If anyone from the indus valley wandered over they would have fallen over pretty fucking quickly.  The civilisations all around them were much more capable, as were the roaming nomads that would fuck them up at random, and during the period before Hammurabi, the gods were what mattered, the kings were just "shepards" Hammurabi was the one that proclaimed himself both father and shepard, that was only you know, 1000 years after gilgamesh.      Your doing God's work Anon.   Gil a shit.   Archer trained for years his Magic Circuit and his abilites. We see in Fate that Shirou hardly projected one weapon and that fucked his shit up everytime. In UBW, he did what he did thanks to all that knowledge he stole from his future self. And in HF, he skipped everything and ended killed himself.    only 36 NPs</span> Lancelot is trash     The entire theme of UBW is imitations being able to beat originals</span>  So what does it say when Shirou imitates and beats himself?     Gilgamesh is such an awful king, the more I think about him being the "King of humanity" the more it pisses me off.   Masturbation    Not Lancelot's fault his master is a shit, and not using him correctly.     flipped england how <s>deep</s>      Just sit safe in the knowledge it was literally never true, and Nasu just didn't do any research at all.      King of heroes not king of humanity.    Gil being defeated so easily is more of a result of ufotable's adaption implying Shirou overpowers Gil in both skill and power.  In the VN, Shirou only won under very specific conditions and even then it was pretty dicey.      Heroes implies he does heroic acts that benefit humanity. Gilgamesh from the Fate universe is a piece of shit. Also he should he more manly/masculine and not a pretty-boy.    Considering that his entire "epic" is just a tale of city against country, not much heroism.      Despite what everyone else says, I fucking love the original manga. The beginning art style is shit, but by later volumes it makes Shirou look as /fit/ as he should and quite honestly looks all right.      I never understood why people disliked the anime. In my opinion, it was a much better DEEN anime that tried to merge the routes together.  Also, they drew LE, which is even better.      disliked the anime</span> I mean the manga.     Shirou, while being fit, is described as looking small and somewhat boyish. He even has a bit of a complex over it. The manga got it way wrong.    is described as looking small and somewhat boyish.</span> Yeah, but the art says otherwise. Shirou isn't small or boyish at all, even if he isn't as buff as the manga makes him out to be.      I cleaned Last Episode up a while ago, but I never had the opportunity to dump them. Should I?     Do it    But the temple of Ishtar is full of whores. Sounds like a high school to me.     On it.  Shit, I'll have to resize since all of these are over 4 mbs. I'll start from the beginning again.      Shirou's back looks heroic as fuck in this.    Art of cloak Shirou when?      The anime made Shirou look worse against Gil, not better.      Merlin defied everyone's expectations.    Shirou has his PTSD face here.   Looks like a faggot.         He'll take your dick and put it on a little girl.    And that's the end of that. I always feel happy whenever I see this last page.    But anon, I already do that myself.    Shirou overpowers Gil even in the film, but in that circumstance, Shirou fights with a copy of Excalibur and Gil forgets to harness his power, insisting on wanting to do a sword duel.   Apart from the cutting arm, what happens in the novel?      Wut? In the tv anime, Shirou goes full Ninja, with showing off a power equal to Gil as control and speed of his swords.    Implying Gil protected anything.</span>  Uruk society was so perfect even before Gil was born, that the concept of professional soldiers had not existed yet and instead of sending an angry mob of villagers against Enkidu, Uruk just sent a prostitute.  The only protection Uruk ever needed was against the rapist manchild that was Gil.        Heroes implies he does heroic acts that benefit humanity.</span>  No it doesn't you faglord. A hero in the classical sense is just someone who does amazing shit. It had nothing to do with being morally good. Gil's rebellion against the Gods was the first act of heroism in that sense.  Also, Gil did benefit humanity in his time. That's why he's designated as Chaotic Good. He was an asshole who did whatever he wanted to his people but they were safe and secure and had everything. Unlike "so good and saintly" Saber who ran her piece of shit country into the ground.          Since the Epic of Gilgamesh is just the first written story</span>  It's not the first written story.  Also, the king under the mountain that Gil met was Prototype Noah and of course, he is stronger than Gil.  Prototype Noah can refuse to go to sleep for a week while Gil is unable to pull off a week of no sleeping in the Epic.          It's not the first written story.</span>  Yes it is. Any literature older than the Epic is not a story.      Gilgamesh killed a few divine beasts here and there to protect humanity with but he also ran his country into the ground like Arturia and fucked up by ending the AoG. Andersen calls him out on all this in CCC.    He goes "full ninja" because he's being pushed back by GoB at certain points. You can clearly see him landing farther away from where he started. When he falls toward Gil, he's unprotected after Rho Aias fades and could've been picked off by any sword that zoomed past him if Gil conveniently didn't miss every single shot (that he also never countered), and they stress his momentary hesitation as another reason for how Shirou even got to slice off his arm in the first place. He wasn't pressuring Gilgamesh throughout the entire fight like in the VN.    Are you pretending to be retarded?    Gilgamesh killed a few divine beasts here and there</span>  But those were his problems and some of the beasts didn't bother anybody and just stayed in their spot and it was Gil that came to kill them while they haven't killed anyone, themselves. because they were just meant to be guards not wild beasts that attacked anybody that they felt like or destroyed property on purpose.  It was Gil that risked the safety of Uruk with his ego.       Enkidu was a Faker too, why did Gil like him?   This. In the VN Shirou closes in very quickly and there is no weapon that GoB shot that Shirou's UBW didn't counter.  And the grail swallowed Gil while Shirou was about to finish him off.     One thing I liked about the anime's version of the fight was how they turned Shirou's narrative into dialogue, like saying how Gil is just an "owner" not a "warrior" to his face, was excellent   Using the Grail means giving birth to AM</span> Kind of.     that pose</span> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=std<wbr>Y7NMWhLc</wbr></span> [ ]    Who would win an insult fencing grailwar?   Probably the dog.    Shirou's hair is basically like Guts' when he does UBW. It makes me so happy.    Underrated post.   Because Enkidu didn't borrow someone else's ideals nor was he really a "faker" considering he was "all things within creation" to begin with. Enkidu's purity also probably has something to do with it.    I meant to respond to this post.     Servants only? Archer, Lancer and Fake Assassin (though some might be immune to his sarcasm) would probably make it into finals, not sure who would win though. Certainly not Gil, his entire vocabulary consists of mongrels and mad dogs.    Thinking that argument is valid</span> Iskander survived 80 when it was said it was the same for all the other Servants, hence quote proved wrong.     Gilgamesh was keeping count and was annoyed about having to use them. Against more threats like Cu and Shirou, he was raining down hundreds and thousands. Lancelot a SHIT    Do you think Gil would be angry that his vault is full of retarded looking monsters?    <s>They blew it up in S2</s> <s>Gilgamesh confirmed for S3 Villain</s>     purity </span> I'm sure Gil experienced many pleasures from Enkidu's shape shifting abilities.     The max known output is 80, Gilfag. He was serious against Iskandar.  Gil thought 16 would do the job but we know how that ended up for the King of Jobbers.      you will never have a qt trap loyal only to you</span>    The max known output is "thousands" against Cu.

Was pretty intresting although I don't remember much.   Can we have an RIP moment for Shirou's baller black and white jacket that finally met it's end in episode 24?

There's a pretty fucking big difference between using 80 and using a thousand right at the start of a fight that then proceeds to go on for 12 more hours.

It doesn't matter what 2 different authors considers alot when we do get an actual amount</span>  Actually that is infact, the only thing that matters. If Nasu doesn't think 80 is a cool enough number to use and instead exaggerates it then that doesn't mean that's the amount he actually uses. The text is not final, what's final are artists statement and interpretations.      just because he says a thousand doesn't mean it is a thousand</span> Straight-up denial. The fact that it was never changed and is in the actual release means that it's final.    <br/>   Denial</span>  read  and   You are implying Shirou can instantly count the exact number of one thousand. This is clearly and hyperbole as calling 16 "countless". Furthermore you are implying someone weaker than Diarmuid can hold off a thousand NPs while being held back by a Command Spell.           Cu </span> weaker than Diarmuid</span> lmao      If it was anything other than swords you'd have an actual argument, but Shirou being able to count and instantly identify a thousand swords is more than within the realm of belief. Cu is fucking ridiculously strong, one of the strongest Lancers that can even be summoned by the grail to begin with.    Comptiq 2007-06 issue - Fate Dojo Q &amp; A: Q: Cu Chulainn and Diarmuid are both Lancers, but who will win in an honourble battle? Diarmuid received more backup from his Master (prana supply), thus in terms of pure firepower, Diarmuid was stronger. </span>  RIP Gilfag.        Implying it meant literally swords</span> Gae Bolg prototype is clearly there</span> Even more proof that it was just hyperbole.      Literally only because of his master.    this somehow means he's stronger than Cu</span> Fucking stupid. . Cu was able to go toe-to-toe with Gilgamesh for 12 hours despite having Kotomine as a Master. "Firepower" doesn't equal strength at all.     in terms of firepower</span> Diarmud still had shit NP and was a huge pussy     proof</span> Sure are using that word loosely as hell. They specifically mention a thousand swords, and Gilgamesh showing off Gae Bolg wouldn't be odd in any sense of the word considering he identified who Cu is.     kek. I meant purity as in purity of the heart but...Enkidu has a true neutral alignment so who knows if that still stands. You'd think out of the two that Gil would be the true neutral one but alas.   I hope Rick is good at running then.       That means that a weaker Kotomine that is also giving less mana to lancer than he should makes a weaker Cu than a Kayneth using Sola Ui mana to power Diarmuid. In equal mana terms Cu is probably stronger. i don't give a shit about Gil      He was still stronger than FSN Cu.   I guess Diarmuid can handle Gil for 13 hours then.   Doesn't change the fact that he is still stronger than Cu.          Shirou and Kiritsugu's Arturia is weaker than Rin's Arturia. She's still strong though     Equal mana yes, probably, but we are talking about FSN Cu.    Again, having more firepower =/= stronger. If you're seriously claiming Deermud has a fucking chance against Gilgamesh then you're severely overestimating the shitty Zero Servants.    now i fear how strong was Cu having Bazett as Master   And now the VN is deprecated.    ran his country into the ground like Arturia</span>  Anon, Arturia raised her country out of the fucknothing it was when she took the throne into one of the greatest kingdoms of all time. It was the betrayal of Lancelot that destroyed Camelot.       He does have better stats than Kotomine's Cu, but he's not better as a Servant.    But England doesn't make up all of Great Britain, just a bottom portion.    Diarmuid was stronger.</span> Learn to read.  Google firepower, this is the meaning  1: the amount or strength of military weapons that can be used against an enemy  2: effective power or force  Too bad, Gilfag.             Pedophiles really hate gil     Is there any info about her skills as a magus? From what I've seen she is competent for a muscle wizard, but mostly relies on having shit engraved with runes and on fragarach. Hard to say if she'd make a good "master". She'd still probably roll over everyone.     Since when was Gae Bolg a sword?   Gilgamesh is quite capable of launching more than 80 noble phantasms at once from GoB, doing so is his ultimate super move in CCC unlocked when his origin is unleashed.   If you just mean physically stronger then possibly, if you mean actual capability in fights then no.     It's a blade on a stick, which Shirou counts as a sword for the purposes of UBW (you can see it in Archer's swordspam in the VN when he kills Caster)     I'm referring to him bringing out a thousand swords and Gae Bolg, not Gae Bolg being one of them. Gilgamesh has always liked taunting his opponent, so it's not something he'd be unlikely to do. It's specifically written there so any claims you make about it being an "inaccurate amount" is just false assumptions rather than the actual text.    It said sword, not blade. Nice try Gilfag.   Shirou said a thousand swords appeared, not a thousand swords and Gae Bolg. At least you tried. Regardless of how many he showed he was never said to throw all those. He showed hundreds to a fucking Shirou Saber.       Her family is old as fuck and is from a high class lineage, she must be a very good master    It was more Morgan's scheming, but honestly the fall of Camelot was just a little bit of everyone's fault. Or destiny, if what little translation of GoA is to be interpreted correctly.    Well Gil did want to make sure he beat Saber into submission.    At what point are you going to realise that the words are not final, they are not the end all and be all.  It's like I'm arguing with someone from the 1400s.      Lancelot was said to stall Numeral boosted Gawain for hours who is clearly far beyond anything Cu could even hope to be, yet you see Gilfags saying Lancelot would die from 32.    [x]Save Illya    He went into a 12 hour fight with Cu and brough out a thousand right away. It wasn't just a display of intimidation but to actually kill him. The instances you're talking about are when he just shows them his power and then fucks off.    Exactly, which is why the "thousands" there isn't final either and is an hyperbole. The whole sentence was an hyperbole.    No wonder he's so mad at humanity.    He'll hate it even more if ISIS ever gets to it.    Oh... you weren't arguing for literal thousands... okay then.    Showing off =/= throwing them.  Fate/Zero:Act 16 Part 9 As soon as their owner gave the order, countless primeval Noble Phantasms would shoot in unison toward Saber. She had literally become the target of a thousand arrows.</span>  Yet he never threw all of them. Also, the word countless is there, guess what else was called countless.  Fate/Zero:Act 4 Part 2 A countless number of Noble Phantasms rained down on the road of the warehouse town, which already looked like it had received carpet bombing.</span> This was talking about 16.             Let's not forget Lancelot's master is pretty occupied suffering from the worms that are eating him alive.    I hope Rick gets to trashtalk Gil.    Forgot one last part about Act 16 As her left leg had been previously pierced through, she could not even dodge.</span> So, if her leg wasn't pierced, she could dodge "a thousand" arrows.      I do seem to follow.    How is that not showing off? Comparing him whipping out a "countless" amount to an actual quantifiable number doesn't mean that just because countless didn't actually mean infinite somehow makes 1000 not mean a thousand.    Wait, the jacket was just a collar'd version of his shirt. What makes the jacket not terrible compared to the shirt?     Gawain, even boosted, can't possibly match the firepower of 32 noble phantasms fired from GoB. As Nasu explains, Gilgamesh has the power of an army, which individual heroic spirits cannot hope to directly match.     It's his fault for abandoning his mage duties he would've handle the worm treatment a lot more better, and Sakura paid the price for it.    Equivalent to EX in almost all stats</span> Can't handle 32</span>  Gilfags being as retarded as always. Even worse, Gawain Galatine is fucking Anti Army.       How strong would blondie be if he actually got up his lazy fucking ass and learned how to dodge?     Illya route confirmed</span>     He showed them off just like against Cu, but he was never said to use all of them in any case. Worse, the word "thousand" is clearly an hyperbole as somehow it would mean that Saber can dodge a thousand arrows yet she is barely able to dodge Lancelot bullets.  The fact is, Gil has never been shown to use more than 80.      Shirou projects a way to save Ilya from dying on a multiroute level</span>    an actual amount is clearly a hyperbole</span> Sure it is anon, you can keep living in your dreamland where Lancelot and Iskandar were considered actual threats rather than a minor annoyance and someone who he respected a person respectively.     Thousand swords</span> Gae Bolg is now a sword.</span> Keep living in your dreamland where Gilgamesh can throw more than a barrage of 80, Gilfag.       Protip: any stat multiplied by three is ++, not EX.   Also, congrats for completely missing the point. No matter how powerful a noble phantasm that a heroic spirit has, it's still just the one individual Servant. Excalibur is vastly superior to Galatine in every way, but even Saber can't beat Gilgamesh, because he doesn't just fight like a single Servant, he launches multiple attacks from all directions. That's what Nasu is referring to when he says Gilgamesh is like an army, and that's why Lancelot could not have handled the next wave of noble phantasms.       being this retarded</span> Gawain has high stats in every category and they get tripled under the sun. Excalibur Galatine is comparable to normal Excalibur on its own.     What if Gil fought seriously?</span> Serious Gil is like a unicorn. You've heard of it, you can probably sort of picture it in your head, but you've never seen it and you never will, because unicorns don't exist. It's like discussing a fight between two boxers and suddenly suggesting that the fight would turn out differently if one of the boxers was the Incredible Hulk.     2015</span> still believing in ancient JIDF propaganda</span>     Lancelot could not have handled the next wave of noble phantasms</span> It's true that he could not match it, but he could get out line of fire of those attacks thanks to that A+ agility and fine an opening since you know it's Gilgamesh who always under estimates his opponents till it's to late. The real question if Kariya is able to maintain Lancelot in battle before dying like with the Saber fight were Lancelot almost won.      Protip: any stat multiplied by three is ++, not EX.</span> 240 goes above the Grail scale, meaning EX.  multiple attacks from all directions</span> Love how Gilfags like to say this shit when he has only shown the ability to do this in non canon scenarios like the UBW anime or Illya.  Lancelot could not have handled the next wave of noble phantasms.</span> Yet Iskander handled 80.            Literally everyone is bullying Gil during FSF, I'm certain Rick will get a shot at the Gilgamesh roast.    he has only shown the ability to do this in non canon scenarios like the UBW anime or Illya.</span> It should be obvious he can, and since when UBW isn't canon but for some reason Zero is.  Yet Iskander handled 80.</span> He couldn't. Even then, that fight was the opposite of Gil fights with Shirou or Lancelot, he actually respected the oponent and went all out just because he wanted not because he needed.        It's really great, Gil is shit when things are going his way.    It should be obvious he can</span> It should be obvious Hassan can beat serious Gil. See? I can do it too.  since when UBW isn't canon but for some reason Zero is.</span> Anime = not canon  He couldn't.</span> He did, no Battle Continuation, still alive after being showered by 80.           Anime = not canon</span> multiverse lol     Then F/Z LN isn't canon either only FSN and HA VN are since they are actually written by Nasu    It should be obvious Hassan can beat serious Gil.</span> It is different, in this case you are talking bullshit; in the other, we were already shown that he clearly can. The thing is that for some reason you see the anime as non-canon when Nasu already said that it is 100% canon.     If you with the bullshit mutiverse argument it's even worse for you case, since Julian pretty much said Lancelot &gt; Gilgamesh and EMIYA.   Being written by Nasu has nothing to do with it. If Nasu considers it canon, it is. If the anime is canon then. The 32 comment is invalid since it wasn't mentioned. Invisible Air B STR Saber can somehow cut Heracles. Heracles is confirmed to be able to defeat Gilgamesh if he let Illya die. Gilgamesh accepts defeat against Shirou.  Seriosly, I can keep going but it's only going to make Gil look worse. That would also mean the DEEN anime is also canon.             If you with the bullshit mutiverse argument it's even worse for you case, since Julian pretty much said Lancelot &gt; Gilgamesh and EMIYA.</span> Okay then I agree. I'm not that anon by the way.     You're right, he's a terrible person. Who wouldn't want worms inside his body voluntarily?    But the F/Z LN isn't canon to the F/SN VN and F/HA isn't canon to the F/SN VN nor F/Z.    that Saber</span>  No wonder they called her KING Arthur      in this case you are talking bullshit</span> Just as you are.  we were already shown that he clearly can</span> In non canon scenarios.  The thing is that for some reason you see the anime as non-canon when Nasu already said that it is 100% canon.</span> He never said that, but ok, let's play your game. Now the 32 comment isn't even made, and somehow Saber can cut Heracles without Excalibur. Good to know that bullshit is now canon.           Heracles is confirmed to be able to defeat Gilgamesh if he let Illya die.</span> Gilgamesh accepts defeat against Shirou.</span> This are in the VN as well.  Invisible Air B STR Saber can somehow cut Heracles.</span> It wasn't Invisible Air B, it was Prana Burst A.        Wait a second Nasu said Prisma is Ilya's route so that means. Lancelot &gt; Gilgamesh and EMIYA. confirmed.    So what's happened to Gil?  Has his existence been obliterated by way of the grail hole?  Or has he returned to the heroes realm or whatever?       This are in the VN as well.</span> Heracles comment is never made. Gilgamesh only says Shirou is stronger than he is inside UBW, but never says "you won" as he did in the anime.  It wasn't Invisible Air B, it was Prana Burst A.</span> Watch the anime again, I'm not talking about the kill, I'm talking about the cuts. Heracles had cuts all over his body and was bleeding far before the Prana Burst.         Search for the UBW BD interviews, there Nasu explicit says that the anime is a different continuity than the route, but still canon. This isn't even something to be discussed, everyone knows that everything is canon except Prisma which is like another multiverse.      Nyah Shirou wasn't trying to go superhero on Sakuralot at that point. Gil Miyu was too emotional and didn't spammed enough swords from GOB before she almost got hijacked by Gil.      Search for the UBW BD interviews, there Nasu explicit says that the anime is a different continuity than the route, but still canon.</span> He only says things happened differently in the anime, never said it was canon.  This isn't even something to be discussed, everyone knows that everything is canon except Prisma which is like another multiverse.</span> Nasu said that was considered the Illya route, stop trying to save face, Gilfag. Go with the multiverse argument, and Gilgamesh instantly looks far worse than he already does. I'm trying to help you here.        Julian comment, it didn't matter how serious those 2 were, Sakuralot was still going to fuck them up. Shirou didn't even realize what was going on before he got wrecked. Sakuralot was so fast he couldn't react to his weapon getting stolen or him being cut.    AND MANGA.    So only F/SN VN is canon?  <s>fine to me</s>  I'm not a Gilfag I don't give a shit        I understand with Shirou since he's running on nothing.  If Miyu was completely jacked by Gil, well Sakuralot would have been blown away.      Nasu said that was considered the Illya route</span> So now, Prisma is canon? What do you even consider canon apart from the VN and, apparently, Prisma?  Also, I am not a Gilfag, if anything I prefer Illyas and Shirou a lot more.        Not that anon but I don't think you know what canon actually means.    If Miyu was completely jacked by Gil, well Sakuralot would have been blown away.</span> That's not what Julian said. Julian was daring them to throw more NPs as it wouldn't even make a difference.  So, stop making up bullshit, Gilfag.       Not that anon but I don't think you know what canon actually means.</span> Knowing Nasu with lazy habit he made Prisma Illya's route you gotta accept it.     So now, Prisma is canon?</span> He said something about it, but it was more of a joke, unless you support the multiverse argument, of course.  What do you even consider canon apart from the VN and, apparently, Prisma?</span> Zero LN and Hollow Ataraxia.        Zero LN and Hollow Ataraxia.</span> Fair enough, I will argue that Extra and CCC are also canon, but I guess it's up to you if you see them as canon or not.     It looks like an obese king sneezing.   http://gigazine.net/news/20150621-f<wbr>ate-sn-ubw-event/  Just want to remind people that episode 24 had cut content.  </wbr>   Just look what happened last time he was humiliated by everything from random grunts, vampire dragons, and computer programs.  As long as he's in the position of a challenger, he isn't likely to lose.      Returned to the Throne    That shit is only a bit stronger than Excalibur in terms of pure power though.    It's a bit stronger than True Excalibur, which we haven't seen to date since it can only show its real power like that when the Earth is in danger.  You don't seem to get it while saying "Lame, Excalibur is the best", Ea was buffed recently, therefore Excalibur was buffed in GoA to stay consistent, but it's not comparing normal Excalibur to full power Ea..  The Excalibur that is a bit weaker than this hasn't been seen entirely.        FUCK I CAN'T UNSEE IT    How was it buffed recently? It seems like you are just making up bullshit.   <span class="quote">&gt;all this lancelot is strong</span> He is fucking weak, but he is stronger than he actually is since he is in berserker class. Actually he is one of few servant that become better in berserker class. Iskandar is strong</span> He is a shit servant and a shit Rider. Who the fuck thought his weak ass bull is a better ride than his horse? The actual legend says his horse is as strong as a pegasus, if only it can fly. Diarmud vs Lancer</span> They have same speed, but diarmud has 2x multiplayer (+). In term of fire power, diarmud is better as it said. But Cu beast-like fighting could be a problem since he also have runes and better spear. Also remember diarmud fight like most lancer but only Cu fight focusing on thrusting, that how skilled he is. I don't care who will win despite their stat but I don't think diarmud can survive Cu's Gae Bolg. Do you think just because you're faster than someone you can win? Think about you fighting a boss in a game.         No, that's Ea's full power. The swings Gil used to counter Excalibur in Fate were only slightly more powerful, but even then Ea was not fully charged. At full power, Ea's damage exceeds all common sense and destroys Gaia's Supreme Reality Marble, subjecting the target to absolute annihilation.     Nice fanfiction.  Ea is a citybuster at best.       Play CCC or F/HA, I don't have time to waste dealing with your ignorance.     what nasu said is fanfiction</span> Nice headcanon.      Keep crying Gilfag.  Maybe you should be the one who needs to play F/HA.       Who the fuck thought his weak ass bull is a better ride than his horse?</span>  It was Zeus Bull  It's much better than you seem to think.  Fighting with two weapons comes with a lot of weaknesses as it does comes with a few plus marks. It's like in Tales of Symphonia when Kratos thought Lloyd was retarded when he said "Well one sword is good, and two swords means its like x2 as strong with x2 chances to move, right?"  You lose focus, can't put as much power or defense in, etc. Even if you're a master its a fighting style with some good and some bad.            Isn't that just a doujin though?    It's published by Type Moon.     Gilgamesh accepts defeat against Shirou in the VN too, they just changed "I cannot defeat him here!" into "In this moment you are strong!"     It's an official enough manga, but not really a big one.  It's more like different authors do something each chapter I think, or its a comedy?  It launched to promote or cash in on UBW anime.          </span> Aren't all of these the exact same person?     &gt;what nasu said</span> is that Ea's destructive output isn't really much greater than Excalibur.  Ea can rip the fabric of reality, hence the Anti-World attribute, but its actual destructive range isn't anywhere near capable of destroying the world.      All of the Extra manga are probably ranked higher on the scale, as a way to say this isn't very high up, but it is official.  Zero percent heroine points  Rito, no   That delicious Tiger</span>  http://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/<wbr>4041028833/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?ie<wbr>=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;smid=AN1VRQENFRJN5  This is it, right?  </wbr></wbr>            Art looks delicious <s>character look better than in the actual show</s>          What he needs is a good punch in the face, followed by being disemboweled with a chainsword        Can someone please tell me where Lady-Lancelot is from? This looks really interesting     Don't expect anyone to get that, people born in the 00's are posting here.     It's Sakura using the Lancelot card in Prisma.  This Sakura is fucking batshit insane.       I need to know what's going on here    Season 2 when?   Hopefully never.    reddit: the anime</span>  Hopefully never.     Cute trappy vampire when?   reddit: the anime</span>  I don't get it how did that anime earn that meme?       Welcome to /a/    When there's more material? The anime adopted all of the novels except for the sixth which was one huge flashback (if it can even be called that).    IRCfags spammed it and tryhards repeated it to fit in.    That was the best one.   Also, they didn't adopt the mermaid arc or the Flugel arc, though the former was pretty boring.      It adapted 3 of 6 novels. Half is not all.     Never, it ended on original content    fit in</span>  Reddit please leave.     ITT: people who care about internet demographics   Hopefully never.    How did the brasilian get this adapted in the first place?    Hopefully soon this Fall.    By being half japanese.   Didn't the guy who did this got caught tracing?   I assume it's the tag given to anime that reddit hivemind likes and /a/ hivemind doesn't    It's popular without being objectively bad on the same level as something like SaO, therefor /a/ doesn't like it    Is it me or are anons getting worse with this shit by the day? The list of off-limits phrases gets bigger every fucking day.    Brazilian ken-sama had proud 1/128 japanese heritage.    No we dislike it because reddit likes it. There are hundreds of anime worse than ngnl that we like but they hate.   never, writer dropped the manga and the anime. quit shitposting.    No one gave a shit. NGNL too entertaining.    From what I recall it was fake, and they accused him because the gaijin that sell better than a lot of nips is shamefur.   It's seriously amazing how fast /a/ turned on NGNL despite many anons enjoying it for the fun and otaku pandering. Trolls trolled how reddit liked it, but reddit likes a lot of shows and yet somehow NGNL is special to deserve negative attention because of it.   I still like it, fuck the /a/ hivemind.    Just let them do it. NGNL is entertaining as fuck and I sure enjoyed it, and still am. Only a month to go till volume 7. Let's see if it has some promising announcement.      but reddit likes a lot of shows and yet somehow NGNL is special to deserve negative attention because of it.</span>  Which just condemns your silly defense mechanism (waah /a/ hates my shitty show only because Reddit likes, that's the reason, not the show itself!) Like you said, there are plenty of decent shows that reddit likes      Never ever, The teasers at the end were more or less a nod at "BUY THE NOVELS"  Just let it go.   otaku pandering</span> You mean fanservice?     Not soon enough    Because the more time that passes, the more things Reddit says, thus the more things /a/ takes notice of, leading to them mark everything they relate to reddit as off-limits. Even if a certain phrase or meme originated from here to begin with.    It adapted the first 3 volumes, and included a scene from the end of the 6th. I heard that scene at the end was anime-original, and the author liked the twist enough to add it to Volume 6.  Supposedly.  Basically, S2 probably never.        You dun goofed OP. NGNL is one of *those* shows that you're not allowed to talk about on /a/. Just like SAO, AoT, AKG, they are fun to watch but objectively shit. But you're not allowed to talk about them on /a/, sorry.      SAO: Tryhard &amp; edgy AoT: Tryhard &amp; edgy AKG: Tryhard &amp; edgy NGNL: Fun  One of these is not like the other         objectively</span>    NGNL</span> not Tryhard</span>     dropped the manga</span> Good thing the source material is a Light Novel, and is still going, even if slowly. Someone in a previous thread said Volume 7 is like in July or something, if I remember right.      http://www.mediafactory.co.jp/bunko<wbr>j/book_detail/1298</wbr>   Only good thing: KayanoxMatsuoka ship   It never took itself seriously. It knew it was stpid and over the top, and never tried to be "muh serious adventure"     Which anime's did earn the title of Reddit: The anime? I can only think of S;G and NGNL     Didn't the guy who did this got caught tracing?</span>  There were all sorts of false attacks on the author. Everything from "he's a convicted felon" in brazil to plagiarism and art tracing for the books. The accusations were shown to be fake and started by various online accounts. The various instigating accounts were deleted. Other anti-NGNL campaigns were started including a boycott NGNL campaign because the author was Brazilian Japanese. So why didn't ShindoL get a lot of flak for being american japanese and moving to Japan?  The reason is that prior to World War II, many japanese that disagreed with the Japan StrongK patriotic approach were either forced to leave (for personal safety reasons) or voluntarily emigrated to other countries primarily Brazil which has a significant japanese community (the biggest outside of japan). Those japanese are discriminated against to this day for their non-patriotism and non-loyalty to japan for WW2. Remember,even though japan lost WW2, those japanese who didn't support japan for WW2 are considered scum. Even in the usa, those from that time period who were against genocide of native americans were considered unpatriotic scum. While that is not the case today, if you earned that scum label from back then, it would still follow and haunt you to this modern day. That's how it was and is in Japan for NGNL's author.        muh serious adventure</span> Well, if Season 2 ever happens, that will change for at least a bit. Volume 6 goes all serious mode, and "&gt;muh feels" level shit. Of course Volume 6 is a flashback from before the 10 commandments.      Just like SAO</span> I see sao threads all the time.  so, sao is shit. but X is best girl</span>       It never took itself seriously</span>  Steph drama</span> Sora disappears</span>       Steph drama</span> please, she was hammering her head into the wall or got abused by the MCs every five minutes, it's hard to take anything about her serious. it's like clown rape.  Sora disappears</span> woah, a little bit of character development happens. doesn't negate the fact it's a pretty lighthearted and fun show. think nanoha. abusive mother cloning her daughter and a military that sends children to do a job that warrants orbital bombardment. and yet it's a fairly happy show.          Season 2 when?</span>  MadHouse is known as a single season anime producer. It typically produces as well as creates the animation for a story. MadHouse's owner is a media network and prefers new shows rather than 2nd seasons. Please note that a cour is not a season although a lot of /a/ seems to think they are the same. Card Captor Sakura was aired as one season although it had multiple cours. Mahouka was one season with two cours.      Those japanese are discriminated against to this day for their non-patriotism and non-loyalty to japan for WW2. Remember,even though japan lost WW2, those japanese who didn't support japan for WW2 are considered scum</span>  THIRD BOMBING WHEN      I pray everything it won't happen. A normalfag studio doing NGNL adaptation was horrible enough one time.  Really, butchering the loli fanservice for the adaptation almost completely, and not putting effort purposedly whenever they didn't cut things out is tragic enough if you are a lolicon. Reason enough for me to hate it for sure, and sadly more and more adaptations follow its example.       a lot of /a/ seems to think they are the same</span> Newfags are the ones who think like that.

Catch up anon.  woah, a little bit of character development happens.</span> Oh it shows anon, it shows.  Of course its a fun show, but to not think it's not a bit tryhard.           This is by far, the worst version of Alice in wonderland I have ever seen,  2nd season when? </span> never, I hope.     I want to believe in S2.  Also, both volume 7 and volume 2 English translation releasing next month.     Volume 7: July 24th English Volume 2: July 21st     We need more Miko art. That fox is underrated.     If we get S2 she'll be featured regularly.    My mind automatically substituted that card in her mouth for a condom...

I, for one, hope to hear a S2 announcement at the MF summer festival.    Izuna and Sora are cute and best girls.      Too bad for this shit eating censorship killing anything even remotely delicious about the lolis.    and Sora</span> Yeah, I know Shiro hardly did anything (joint protag my ass) but stay in his shadow, but this is still a bit strange to say.    Where did the anime stop? I want to pick up where it left off.   Obvious typo for Shiro instead of Sora.  What? Half the games were won because of Shiro. Or rather, because of [Blank]. One game focused entirely on Shiro since Sora trusted her to complete it.      Retarded reddit meme needs to die</span> Wants a second season</span> Make up your mind.      one game</span> Yeah, THE one game. Still she was little more than Sora's gimmicky side pet or something, not a realy character at all, zero presence.      the moment you stop giving a shit about others is truly the best feeling   <span class="quote">&gt;some people actively defending lolicon butchering that is NGNL anime adaptation</span> Why is this allowed?   I hope, i need more Shiro and Izuna goodness.  also NGNL=Reddit: The anime</span> Naruto and AoT=Best shit ever</span> So glad /a/ is totally not turning into reddit 2.0        NGNL anime is on the same level as Naruto and AoT.

The real answer, also hope they never make another session I doubt it could come close to the first    I seriously hope no one will actually believe LRD trolling and shitposting right here.  Nevermind Sora wouldn't have won half the game without Shiro filling in the blank in their duo, one of the best, if not is the best scene in the show is Shiro vs Izuna and then Shiro and Sora vs Izuna.

My mind automatically substituted that card in her mouth for a condom...</span>  Ragnarok Online could create that misinterpretation. My priestess normally carries a [Blank card] in her mouth. Yes, it actually is Blank (pun intended). Anyways, there is a cardlike item with a pinkish circle design on it. From a distance it looks like a condom in a package.     What went right?  It balanced fun with serious.  The giant robot designs were fantastic.  While the protagonist was edgy as fuck, they grounded him in humanity with nunally and actually tackled the consequences of the imperialistic mindset quite well.  "Only the strong survive" "I refuse to accept that. What about Nunally? Should I just forsake her..."  Really griping.  All character motivations in S1 makes a lot of sense.  Pacing was great.  Lelouch didn't ever stop actually being a strategist. They kept actually using different strategies like underwater attacks and stuff. It had a large cast, but they were all very memorable, and played their own important role.                   /Thread    JIBUUUN WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO  for starters    it was endorsed by pizza hut  Everything.  Only haters are ultraNEETs on /a/ mad its mainstream on the internet     Lelouch and Suzaku  The early robots and the final robot fight  C.C. and Kallen.  The music  The ending.           <span class="quote">&gt;im gonna make everyone hate me and then commit sudoku with suzaku</span> surely this will bring about world peace</span> brilliant strategist     And it worked faggot    Giving people a common foe does provide unity and that's a good startin point to improve the status quo, plus it gets rid of his personal baggage in the process.   It wasn't about world peace per se, at least not in any permanent capacity. In fact, Zero still exists so the masses still need to be saved from war and oppression from time to time.      barely see anything after his death</span> it worked</span> Okay.      You mean the signing of the world peace treaty by Nunally was nothing.   The world literally decided to give every country autonomy and to stop fighting.     It created my waifu   Because, as we all know, the signing of a peace treaty guarantees that peace will last.    Why the fuck do you think Zero 2.0 exist?   my only complaint is every geass except for lelouch and rolo are retarded i will erase your memories</span> lelouch can do this anyway with way more options even got fucking god to do what he wanted i can see the future!!!!!!!</span> he dies a minute after saying this to someone lelouch used his geass on and mariannes geass is just not even worth mentioning  isnt having zero to deter any more war no different than schneizel using the fleias?          At the end of Code Geass. Zero did stop all wars. He didn't do it permanently but did it in a way so that the people he trusted would be put in powerful positions and set up the world so that war wouldn't break out again.    Considering Zero's take lacks lethal nuking not really.    and zero gives you a slow death with a shank to the heart    Balanced the characters designs Didn't overdue mechas Strong MC with a clear goal and motive Didn't waste time with too much fanservice Didn't waste time on too many filler episodes, and the "filler" episodes that were there always moved some part of the plot directly or indirectly People reacted to situations like you think they would, aside from table humper OST was probably among some of the best in anime Lelouches power, while strong was limited in interesting ways making it not a trump card like other shows do   and most importantly the show knew how to write in the use of cell phones in the plot              Makes me wonder why people give R2 so much shit     Zero can intervene in wars without dropping nukes on people, so that's a very different thing.   Charles was obssessed with the past so that's why his Geass ended up being the power to rewrite memories.   The future sight thing was weird, I'll admit.         Because a lot of the new characters didn't belong and served no real purpose.    Rolo was kinda shitty Valletta's coming to lelouches side was kind of stretched  Suzaku's character design got a bit sloppy A whole city of geass users was kinda dumb(I really liked it when it was just a few people, it made it feel more important and special)  Overall I enjoyed R2 just as much as the first season, but it did have somewhat more faults        <span class="quote">&gt;Character has a cough</span> Survives</span>  Legitimately one of the most surprising twists in any anime I've seen.      i will erase your memories</span> I never got why lelouch didn't use his geass on rolo to make him his slave after he went to assault the Geass lab in china. There was really no reason not to have someone who could stop time be your ally i can see the future!!!!!!!</span> I think it's because he wasn't expecting someone to try something that stupid, and I think the lancelot just was stronger than his nightmare so as long as he got a hit in it wouldn't matter        Rolo was very hard to like, but in a way he works out as a monster with enough of a heart to remind Lelouch that his battle wasn't over yet and life should serve a purpose (even in sacrifice).   I never cared for Villetta although I did think her subplot was unnecessary after all.   V.V. was using Geass as a weapon and didn't give it any "special" significance beyond allowing him and Charles to complete their plans.        Ohgi, is what went right.  One thing that bothered me about R2 is that once all the knightmares were able to fly the battles just turned into 'spam lasers in this directions' fests. The season 1 battles were cooler because they showed more strategy and planning like spoofing IFF and shooting through walls.    I thought it was a nice change of pace from having him be explicitly shown to die. He could have fallen over a month later and die a natural death. It wasn't like he had to die on screen.     I liked the battles in R2 ep 1-2, 4, 6, 17, 18, 23, 24 and 25. The rest were too boring.    By then Lelouch was too angry at Rolo and wanted to kill him rather than exploit him (or the rest of the Geass cult) properly.    The first time watching R2 I really hated rolo. The second time I didn't think he was that bad    Still don't get why he choose to literally off the Geass cult when they could've been potential assets for his plans.    Did you watch the show? He went on a rampage and tried to destroy geass after it caused the death of Euphemia.     Like the other guy said, Lelouch was originally going to try and take over the Geass Order. Shirley's death was what threw him off that plan.     euphemia</span> shirley    Lots of things.  Infact basically everything went right except Schniezel wasn't a good enough villain after Charles.  Oh also Orange instantly forgiving zero and pledging serving him after all the humiliation he suffered at his hands was stupid as well.  Orange should have remained an antagonist to Lelouch.         after it caused the death of Euphemia </span>  I take it you never watched R2 it seems.     Suzaku's kick that spins on an unknown axis.   Orange became way more interesting after siding with Lulu, fuck that cliche shit. But also:  Schniezel</span>  Still can't get over how the fuck he was tricked by a blatant recording of Lelouche.        Kallen's tits CC's ass Cool robots Lelouch Style. Lots of style.        Yeah, the whole Ohgi/Villetta thing was just more trouble than it was worth.    jeremiahs loyalty to marianne was explained in picture drama 4.33  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tbd<wbr>OATlhCDo</wbr></span> [ ]  i still think its inadequate tho         It's certainly less sudden than in the TV show with that extra information, so it's a partial improvement.    I think it was the pizza hut   I always thought of the show as taking place in a futuristic medieval Britain, so loyalty to families, especially the royal family is that important.

I want to bully the Elementario   I'd put my hand in warm water while asleep if you know what I mean    <s>Yes.</s>  Muse is the most mature and empathetic, Sylphy has a broad range of skills and is good at multitasking, Koboli has potential but is clumsy and lacks self-assuredness, and Salama is basically still a kid.

Muse isn't fake, she just hides her feelings and tries to be positive for the group. And Sylphy is probably the most focused of the fairies, she plays around but she gets her job done.   I'm not really sure about Koboli though, but she's better than Salama, no doubt about that.      Muse let's invasive thoughts get the better of her.   Sylphy is too wild for a child.

Sure, she can do some of the things she's requested, but her immaturity makes her totally unprepared to take care of a child. I was actually surprised Muse didn't give her a good spanking.    No, she was just about to comitt murder, can't trust her.    It was for the greater good.    Everyone has invasive thoughts, but the second you have that knife and think about killing your pet you stop right there, not until you have it on your pet's neck; can't trust her.

I kind of liled the fact that he fell in love.  Liked* shit, why am i even posting this through my phone   He sold out.   Chihiro best girl. Get fucked Ayumifags.   Because he didn't fall for the girl they wanted him to fall for.    It went against everything he stood for.    I'm just going to leave this here    Should i finish the godesses part on the anime adaption? Does it end where the manga ends?    Because it was a shitty romance    Not op, people think it' s the best part. I agree, you should watch it   Chihiro was the obvious choice out of all the girls if people just think about it for a minute. She was the only girl who fell in love with Keima without him putting up a fake act unlike the rest of the girl. Chihiro was also the only girl Kiema can't get a read of mainly because she doesn't have an archetype like the other girls and thus Kiema have a hard time predicting her action.  Shit was obvious, yo.     <s>You now realize Keima put himself on the attack on the bench not because he needed to for his conquest, but because he had a raging libido.</s>   <span class="quote">&gt;chihiro</span> love </span> ahahahaha  chihiro</span> genuine</span> love</span> ahahahahahahahaha          This was my favorite manga at one time, but then I read one of the author afterwords or some shit like that, and I knew this was going to have a shit end I stopped around the time Kami went to the past or some shit      There's nothing wrong with Chihiro, it's the route taken to reach this ending that was horrible.     The deciding moment (at least for me) was when Chihiro was out of the Goddess roulette. At that point I thought, ok, if the author is going to pair Keima with anyone by the end, it is most likely to be her.  Also because at that point one would realize that she was not in love with Keima because he had done a conquest earlier. She had forgotten all about it, and fallen in love with him - again - on her own. That subplot had been cooking up for a long time behind the scenes, and the author hadn't been building it up for nothing.  In hindsight, very obvious.       The manga started going downhill when the other goddesses go introduced and he had to re-conquer the girls and shit.   Interesting thing is, the whole plot had been more or less planned out at the beginning. Even the final time travel arc, which I thought was the weakest part. There were some clues pretty early on in the story. Funny thing is I can't remember what those were even though I wrote here about them several times around when the manga ended its run.   dem tenrifags still being delusional to this day. kek   He fell in love with the wrong girl.   Because they mad that best girl won again.  Best girl won   The obvious choice was no one. It made no sense for him to go out of his way to date someone. How the fuck is it even going to work when he plays games 12 hours a day. A normal life doesn't fit Keima.    What is character development?    It's not like the events of that arc made him want to stop conquering girls.    Not what we got. Character development isn't a character randomly doing a 180 on all his views at the end of the story. Galge are his life. He cant give it up any more than an addict can give up cocaine and you cant really expect Chihiro to put up with that shit.   The ending was just lackluster in general. I don't even care that it was Chihiro. After the shitshow that was the last arc, it did absolutely nothing for me  Plus, Tenri did not deserve to get shit on that hard     It wasn't a 180. It was what he wanted from the start. Why do you think he cried when he rejected Chihiro first?  Galges are his life but that doesn't mean he never wanted to be a normie.      I don't know about others but I got glad at the ending.    So Chihiro game Keima the one thing he cannot find in games: a new female archetype and possibly the hardest route ever.   <s> Precure thread </s>  I want to pafu Pafu's pafus.

So what happens when we get to a series you hated?   Sounds like a pleasant character.

Kappa have nothing to do with the turtle mystical beast.  Seriously go watch Hyakko.

It's just not the same kind of flower as the others'.    The entire theme of Heartcatch was flora life aka Flowers. Some of the Cure's motifs and names weren't directly flowers but their powers played into the who making flowers grow deal.    Saban Banzai!   Alright. The name "Yuri" is certainly flower-themed, but I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily, and I don't see any lily on her costume.  Her civilian form is more in-theme than her Cure form, I think.   Itsuki? Cologne?

I honestly don't see the dress being much like a lily</span> Wisteria    Yuri is a finicky flower which needs lots of fertilizer to grow.  I think the "flower" label to Heartcatch is a mistake when it's theme is more about botany.   For some reason, the Japanese seem to catch the more obscure flower/plant name references that are largely lost in the western world. Erica is one of them, and might be the reason they named her that.    Hmm. At least the colors are kinda half right.    I know, I know.

It wasn't in the first three pages of Google, though.  Point conceded.     Has anyone made a mega chart with all or most of the Cure's VA's other popular roles?   Just like Non Non Biyori episode one.    It was a rebuttal of the idea that an open-front dress is specific to a lily.  It's not.  It's pretty common in dress design.  Picture related, she's not a flower princess so you can't even get confused about that.            Might need an update.

Actual moonlight?    "We have cures with the power of the sun and the moon."</span>  So yeah.      If there can be a Sawashiro Cure, anything is possible.    I've never told you about her, Haruka... My sister...

I just said I have no idea who you are!</span>                               Her powers have nothing to do with the moon so go figure. Everyone of her special attacks has a fucking rose in the background with petals and her basic attacks are purple energy whips and blasts which can count as moonlight if you want to split hairs like the anon who started the whole thing.    Moonlight is as beautiful as 100 lilies!   How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif? Someone argue with me to increase the post count!     My favorite was Electro Woman and Dyna Girl. Could that be worked into a Precure show?    How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif?</span>  It's because she's Dutch.      Electro Woman and Dyna Girl were completely tech based. That would be like making Batman a Precure.    How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword if she doesn't have an actual sword motif?</span> Because someone at Toei doesn't want to call a spade a spade.     In some other languages, Spade and Sword mean the same thing.    Well, yes. The playing card suit of spades is a stylized version of the swords found on tarot cards.    Thanks for ruining the joke    She got the label from daddy.    How can Cure Sword be Cure Sword</span> Because her dress is a lily.     Big Brother           Stupid sexy Cure Sword, stop making me want to watch Doki         Doki is good.  Just understand that sometimes the studio wanks Mana a bit too hard.  But other than that, it's mostly a good season.        Didn't at one point she go <s>fucking overdrive and make duplicates of herself to beat the final boss at the end? <s>That was pretty fucking OP.</s> </s>        Nevermind that shit! Why they call the girl Cure Peace when she spends the entire series kicking monste ass? That's ain't peaceful at all. Beat the shit out of monsters and representing peace. That's like Ghandi getting some street thugs in a head lock. You loose the right to call yourself the symbol of peace. Then you got Cure Black. How is she Cure Black? Is this some Rachel Dolezal shit? I'm flatter you want to be Cure Black but it what it's cracked up to be. Look at how the Black Ranger gets treated. Black Panther. Once you go black you get put to the back of the group photos with like you Shin from Kamen Rider.         Cure Black</span> Shows up an hour late to crossover battles</span>     Then you got Cure Black. How is she Cure Black? Is this some Rachel Dolezal shit?</span> I chuckled.        What's with all the /b/ images in here tonight?       /wooo/ /m/ Chris Rock Not sure what /b/ you see.        There's some weirdness going on with their attacks, which are mostly flower-based but then you have the forte/fortissimo thing going, which is technically Italian but gives it away as purely musical with the f/ff visuals. They all have non-finishers that break theme, though.   Moonlight is mostly the lily motif, though, from her name Yuri, to (some) lilies blooming in moonlight, to the dress, to her heart flower being the (white?) lily. There are a few different readings for flowers in the Japanese interpretation, none of them fit perfectly; In the west, their association with funerals parallels the fact that everything she loves dies, but probably wasn't an intentional thing.  The violet rose thing is confusing, though. They're all over the background of her powers, and it's the backing flower for her solo purifying ritual. That said, Sunshine has a sunflower for hers, despite Itsuki's heart flower being the peony. (Blossom and Marine's purifying backers are the sakura and cyclamen, matching their respective heart flowers.)         There will never be a Precure who brandishes a sledgehammer like Triple H.   How cute! Today we get a little glimpse at these lovely cat's childhoods. Poor Hummy never managed to get the same growth spurt, but I don't think she minds.   What about Cure Rosetta Bitch can only speak Japanese     They all have non-finishers that break theme, though.</span> <s>Butt Punch</s> is exactly what comes to mind when I think of flowers.  (Blossom and Marine's purifying backers are the sakura and cyclamen, matching their respective heart flowers.)</span> I feel like more effort went into Blossom and Marine as a cohesive unit, and that effort paid off. They were great. The added Cures didn't ever really jibe as a team when compared to the initial duet.   Tsubomi needed Triple H to sooth her flare-up after the butt punch.           Kanade</span> I was waiting for a chance to use this.     She should be Cure Cut    The Easter lily symbolizes purity, which is why it's often displayed at funerals. It's also a lily variety that's native to Japan.  I never really got why her image flower was the blue rose. I guess having it actually be a lily would have been a little TOO on-the-nose.      I guess having it actually be a lily would have been a little TOO on-the-nose.</span>  It's a little girl show. They're allowed to use the obvious.  The one who had yet to bloom was TSUBOMI who became BLOSSOM.        So most people will recognize calling that the Peach Bomber as a Smash Bros reference, but it's actually a much (much) older gag than that, being the Japanese name given to fighting game moves where - typically only girl - attackers butt punched their opponents well before Smash existed. Thing is, the "peach" part isn't a reference to the butt, it's actually a reference to the vag (because of its appearance).   I'm actually not certain whether those lilies are used in Japanese funerals, isn't that a wholly western tradition?  Oh, I also forgot to mention that she's wearing a fricking blue rose on her lapel. I have no idea what's happening anymore.         The Japanese are weird about that. Mostly they like to be subtle but sometimes they like to on the nose. I think some creators/character designers want you to work for the reference.   New Chapter soon  Pastebin: http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87     god tier design</span> god tier stand design</span> good backstory and was literally the start of the SBR</span> outran fucking horses on foot</span> had a ton of mystery and intrigue about him</span> ended up being a stand of the week pawn of Diego's with just a downgraded Echos act 2</span>  What the fuck Araki, this had so much potential.           still mad, i thought he was going to win   Quick! Make up a stand that can beat King Crimson!   Diizu Naatsu    hint that Norisuke is the stand user</span> hey the Japanese guy uses the Japanese sound effects, that's really clever</span> NO IT'S THE FUCKING NATIVE AMERICAN</span>  Easily the worst part of part 7.       Hey guys you ready for the new episode on frida- oh....  Well at least we got that part 4 teas- oh....     the world    My soul will not rest until something gives me hope for a Part 4 adaptation.    We can still be hyped for the new chapter and the new EoH demo    There's no PC version, who cares.   Is he called "Gappy" because of the gap in his teeth?   PC version</span>    People who own a console :^)    Yes    soon</span> implying we'll even get it this month</span>     No, he's called Gappy because he once tripped in the gap between a train and the station platform.    I hope Josuke's seiyuu writes the feem toon and sings the feem toon for part 4, I only watched Hamatora because he sang the ED.    downgraded Echos act 2</span> IASW was far superior to act. It could make multiple sounds at the same time and the things it made were alive even without diego meddling. Really I don't know what you guys expected him to do if he didn't get involved there he would just be off screen the entire like poco.    I have a question.  In stardust crusaders when polnareff confronts dio and he keeps getting reset back to the start of the stairs, am I really supposed to believe that dio is stopping time, walking over to polnareff, picking him up, carrying him a few steps and then placing him back down gently?      anime is over</span>  we are finally discussing Jojolion</span>  Wow I thought the anime posters would never leave         Just because they don't have scans immediately doesn't mean they won't get it at all   Fridays will finally be 500x less autistic       Yes, that's exactly what's happening.    New Chapter soon</span> HOW FUCKING SOON I want to see the AU Shit Hair so much.          Fridays will finally be 500x less autistic</span>  no more speedwagon posting</span> no more hype train posting</span>       I've already read the chapter so it's not that I'm being that impatient, it's just that it has happened before.   Where can i read Jorge Joestar?  Pocoloco's design is so good, he's barely affected by Araki's changing art style.   He's sexy.    Reading the older chapters I really hate how ugly the new crosshatching look. It looks really lazy and sketchy in comparison.    Speaking of Araki's changing artstyle, what part is everyone's favourite style?    Not finished translated yet and the translator is not releasing it bit by bit. It'll be all in 1 go.    Might have been a new/shitty assistant for a while. The crosshatching in Part 7 looked perfect.    I like how late part 1 to part 3 looks but I don't really have a favorite.   Superior jojos thread  never?   ever     It's just UJ printing quality messing up the more delicate shading. All the other parts have tank scans.     Late Part 3 to mid Part 4, along with most of part 2, looks great in that classic style that JoJo has.  Mid Part 7 is probably my favourite look. Really evocative and memorable. Part 8 is drifting away from that a bit too much.      post jojo characters irl   The 10th volume of Jojolion that comes out next month could have a flyer about it    who's this girl?      I honestly think a chapter or two with just sandman and pocoloco would have made SBR the best part uncontested, hell they could have fought sloop john b, who got second place in the race but no design for the character    I want to see the AU Shit Hair so much.</span> it's been on the chinese blogs for a week now     Part 2. I like my burly fabulous men more than scrawny fabulous boys.      I feel you, anon    kek oh my    RiffRaff's Codeine Conquest    Mid-7. Current 8 is great too, Karera is one of the most consistently good-looking Araki girls ever.  Part 4 had a nice sweet spot somewhere in the middle, but it was on the brief side and I wasn't a big fan of the early or late styles.     IT'S HERE  Just finished part 4 Why is the pose famous if he never does it?    True suffering    did you miss this page    Mid part 4, the time where Araki started going easy on the muscles and body size, and haven't went crazy with lips and noses.    link pls    The guy who works on the scanlations tweeted out that they don't have the raws yet so i'm not suspecting the chapter until at least Friday, assuming they get the scans today or tomorrow.   Nice try      Oh hey, I remember the page but not that panel, can't believe I missed that.  Suppose I expected it to make a bigger impact on me, and be a big panel or something, that's no excuse though     I'm almost here, but not yet.

Sicilian Italians are dark as fuck.    Near the True Man's World.    he looks like michael jackson in this pic    Jo3ke</span> Let's not do that. His name is Josefumi.   That color must've gone to the other body. The corpse's eyes were bright too.        That feeling when you look at Magic Boy BT and then the latest JoJoLion chapter, you'd think that the two were made by completely different artists.  Some years ago people were posting gifs explain Stands and other abilities from JoJo, many were edits from this gif.  Any idea of were I can find them?     is this what Joshuu would look like with a pomp?     NO. THE WORLD HAS A BODY. IT CAN MOVE THINGS YOU AUTISTS.      downgraded Echoes Act 2</span>  No he wasn't. Echoes could modify the properties of objects by drawing sound effects on them, but he couldn't create effects in mid air that he could use for whatever purpose he wanted.       Nah man, He's Josefumi Kujo the other half of Gappy    someone on the internet made a joke and i don't like it!</span>    speaking of Jobin, did he really not know who Jo2uke was?    Joshuu might not even be able to make a pompadour since all his hair seems to come from the top of his head.    Even Dio is shocked.    He knew Kira and the Rockman Duo    I like the Dio theory better,  Dio picking up Polnareff gently and speaking to his frozen body join me again while placing him down gently and running back to his spot and starting time again and rinse and repeat.     How do I become hard on hoes like Josuke?   No, he's really confused once he figures out he was tricked and now he suspects his own dad of being up to something.   He knew Kira</span> Did he? I don't remember that ever coming up.        He will never be a bro jo will he?    Get adopted by a rich family    Find one girl you truly love that loves you back and disregard all others    I know it's Josefumi but I like Jo3ke, it's cute.    Such a cool looking stand shouldn't have the ability of another one. Diego The world gets a pass     Why didn't he just say 'oh Karera, My memory got fucked up by a stand during the earthquake.' She would've been on his dick like white on rice, spilling info all over the place.  That's all he had to say.     My mistake he knew about Kira.  Cuz his papa knows about him too.      I don't know, the Internet?   I like french fries I like french fries I like french fries  But not fried chicken       Man, Double J is one hard motherfucker.   i wonder if will we be calling Gappy, Josefumi after the new chapter?     Karera says she's all about living in the moment and doesn't care about the past. I wonder how she'll react when she finds out Secchan isn't Secchan after all.    I am pretty sure Josefumi was nick named Jojo and Josuke is another way of saying Jojo. So he'd go by Strictly Jojo to avoid confusion     If he knew Kira then he would've known why Josuke tricked him as he looks just like Kira. Jobin had no idea who Josuke was at all and didn't even think it was about the fruit shit.  Now unless Jobin is retarded I can only assume he was secretly teamed up with the rockmen for a cure and Norisuke secretly teamed up with Kira and his con artist friends for a cure but they didn't inform each other of that.  Josefumi was likely going to try to steal the healing aspect of the fruit the rockmen had so their secret plans ended up intertwined without them knowing.       She'll be like noooo!!!!! My nightmare came true Secchan and Kira did fuse!!!!    When did we see the other corpse? In the first chapter? I don't seem to remember.    The guy himself is still Josuke. Araki is being rather blatant with his themes so he's definitely his own new person and not just either of his halves.   Some /a/non posted a cleaned up version of this, anyone happen to have it?   this is the same man that previously was walking down a corridor while stopping time every few steps to light some candles on either side, all for effect. You're goddamn right he's carrying him down those stairs.    They found it near the wall eyes after the Fun Fun Fun fight. It was identified as Kira, but it was actually a second fusion made of the parts of him and Josefumi that aren't in Josuke.    His stand is picking him up.    True because they don't know that their maid is Kira's sister    Shit Hair 2.0   For some reason I'm glad to see Kira still loves beating the shit out of schoolboys, even in death.  Could DIO smash this pumpkin?   tfw no Dead Man's Answers</span>    Hwas crying cause he saw the beating his girl took and he wasn't around to defend her    He didn't acknowledge her injuries or ask her about the shit she had gone through. shit bf     Got more of these?    Gappy</span> Christ, I wish this fucking nickname would die already. His name is "Johsuke" as written in English on the tank covers.      NO WAY,ARE YOU SURE?    johsuekeh is my favorite johjoh   r/ the image of joseph smiling next to the "one life partner"  any one got a link to the script   Explain further.    I bet you call Jotaro's mom "Holly".    Mid Part 3 to early Part 5. But I do like the Current Style(Mid SBR to Present).   Will Josuke have the most amount of pussy of any JoJo by the end of this part?   In the manga they said that Joestars only have one partner. Joseph is smiling because loljosuke    <span class="quote">&gt;Part 4 had Josuke, Jotaro and Joseph in it</span> Part 8 has Josuke, Josuke (Norisuke) and Josefumi</span> All them Jojos in Morioh, man.     Kars   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090749</span> What?      plus those half jojos, Jobin and Joshuu   When did this, become more beautiful than THIS?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127090749</span> Sexualized cartoon depictions of little boys. But I don't see what this has to do with anything    The art started gitting gud at mid part 4.    Thanks    the early and mid part 7 pictures show a really ugly johnny    Don't let the other anons lie to you. The stairs were actually made of some kind of solid cold fire and Dio was using his firebreathing powers to make new Stairs and confuse Polnareff    Maybe a couple.    He only wants one and I don't imagine any of them other than maybe Karera would be alright with sharing.    the giant bara deer look did give funnier poses and was generally more homoerotic but really it was sort of silly. I unno which I prefer more the CUHRAZY poses or the more realistic anatomy.    You sure about that?    Technically always since part 7 onwards Araki based his designs and anatomy directly off of Greek/roman artwork.   What will I do on friday nights now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?   Are they friends now? Didn't Tsurugi try to kill him and kidnapped/molested his gf in a dungeon?     part 3 wasn't that good in anime form  part 4 would probably be better as an anime but who knows      rewatch the part 4 commericials and cry    tsurugi was being manipulated      now that JoJo Part 4 has been confirmed for never coming out?</span>  Are you retarded      He's only nine so of course Josuke would be a bit friendlier towards him to make up for telling him to turn on his dad.

Kujo,Jotaro</span> Jotaro is easily the joeist jojo     If it happens it'll probably be 2 1/2 or 3.    The two Josukes are so Jojo they don't even need surnames to be Jojos.    Probably three.

Reading Part 5 now.  <s>Is there any villain who doesn't keep pulling stuff out of their ass to pad out their fight?</s> <s>Ghiaccio can go die in a fire</s>      Kyo conjectured it, but since Gappy is so keen on finding out who he is, I'm assuming he thinks he's this other person.

It's surprising how many people don't realize this, it's not like Araki is being subtle at all about it.    Honestly, I'd rather that be what it was since that means Gappy is his own character, not someone like Weather Report, who changed completely after he regained his memories.   jojo scanlators are slow   I agree. I didn't mean that as a bad thing at all.    It made sense, with weather report, he had his memories stolen, and maliciously at that, he should be pissed.    <s>Pucci takes sex pistols from Mista and later causes his death,</s>    Yeah but Weather Report became almost completely uncaring of his allies post memory retrieval.    Speaking of Pucci, has anyone ever seen what happens in All-Star Battle when he uses his Whitesnake powers on a non-Stand User, like Jonathan or Kars?    Probably nothing different happens.    If you're the same anon from before, I'm surprised you didn't toss in a <s>Mista dies</s> joke somewhere in there.    Yeah, nothing different happens. Another lost opportunity for CC2.    Does norisuke IV's birthname use the same kanji as part 4 josuke?</span> No, it uses the same one as Jobin and Joshuu.

If it happens it'll be 48 episodes as well. Part 4 is like 20 chapters longer than Part 3, and remember Part 3 needed filler to fill 48 episodes.   How much longer is Jojolion going to go?

So why are we trying to look for an old character in Josuke?  Can someone explain what happened during Johnny get shot while Gyro vs D.i.s.c.o? Why the witness saw three different shooter?

Part 7   Can someone put up the Chris Evans pose photo please, its my favorite pic   Only Josefumi uses the 仗    How does that make sense if Part 3 was 5 cour? Part 4 is the longest pre-SBR part.    Remember that in Japan, the last name is said first. So Jotaro would be called KuJO JOtaro    Don't forget JOshua bar JOseph (Jesus)</span>     Really far, but enjoy the ride SBR is. It's amazing.    THIS</span>  We should, not, NEED a team of people to properly dub part 4 in Duwang when its announced. Anyone fluent in Jap and or got time on their hands willing?      <s>sup bro</s>    you ok retard?    Josuke. And Josefumi since he's practically identical.    I thought the blood was from Yotsuyu until I saw blood on Gappy's knuckles.    Joseph obviously   Josuke would be pretty handsome if he didn't have a piece of cow shit stuck on his head.       What a weak stand. All the JoJos are turning in their grave   wow so kira and kira died fighitng each other...i guess that is a spin on part 4  Which characters are most likely to have tried fucking their stands?   Anyone????????????????      Yeah nobody knows what happened during that arc. That's a bigger mystery than the second coffin in my book.     So: Part 4 josuke and josefume: 仗 Part 8 josuke:定 the part 8 higashikatas (joshu, jobin, norisuke iv's birth name [josuke], and presumably the birth names of norisuke ii and iii): 常         dub</span> You mean sub, right? Duwang subs would make more sense     yes, typo my bad. But we need a team fucking dedicated to that shit. I would literally pay if the BD had duwang subs.      three separate johnnies in separate locations    If I knew how to do that sort of thing, I would.   Explain Jojo and all its related concepts in one sentence to someone who has never read a manga before   It's the generational story of the Joestar family as they fight bizarre enemies.    I think it would better fit if it was  "It's the generational story of the Joestar family as they fight bizarre enemies using a variety of bizzare powers."      dat yo</span>    Weird motherfuckers fighting weirder motherfuckers    Read the title of the manga    Bizarre people with ghosts fight other bizarre people with ghosts  Also everyone is fabulous     Why didn't diego turn funny into a dinosaur?

Yeah, this anon gets it.    Are there fan arts of Kadera or yet?    have 4 balls or two pairs     Really nobody? I thought /a/ has the most hardcore jojo fans here.    He is one of the most ugliest characters Araki ever made, but I still like this guy.

He's the most Asian looking one of the family side from his father. Also, he's an self-serving jackass most of the time so it fits.    Yes.    british human bugs bunny</span> you fucked up     groped Yasuho</span> proof or never happened    I'm about to start reading part 4.   What should i expect for?     Fatty dies.

I'm gonna be honest with you anon, almost ever character in JoJo can beat that fat bastard. Why? Because he isn't the smartest member of the gi niu patrol. Even the big rip off dumbass asshole who almost killed Vegeta was smarter than him.    He is like kid Anassui.    Tsurugi gonna start murdering people too?   So is number 3 done yet?   Only if he sees his girlfriend cheating on him.   So when will the final BD for Part 3 come out?   I kind of like these descriptions.    can I do three?       Sure.     3 is not done yet but some anon said he'd do it, but that was about a week ago.    Acho was such a great character. And double wu was such a great stand.   I got a message saying /a/ wanted to do an /a/ sings for the Jojo finale. Is that still on?  when jojo's colored adventures gets to this I hope keep the mudas going out of the text boxes   God Kira was so fucking cool    Is this it anon?   Part 3 was weak in general but the crew was pretty enjoyable I guess.  I doubt David will drop the rest of the parts. If anything, animating Part 7 and 8 in the future will be up for debate    Why do people talk about Jorge Joestar so much? What makes it so special in the Jojo-verse?   36 Kars on mars.</span>    Dude, I can't maintain a meaningful relationship because that's how I am.  You don't want any part of that shit.      There's a part where a Kira uses the spin to power a rope to blow Lisa Lisa in half, and then he dances with her upper body.    I can't tell which parts are true and which parts are made up by /a/nons while they're drunk, on weed and LSD, and sleep-deprived at the same time.       Fuck please respond.  I know its long but its some crappy edit that links the ending of episode 47 and the beggining of episode 48 with Roundabout playing as the ED.         It's Flashpoint wacky JoJo edition.    It's all true.    I do not speak nip, so I wouldn't know. It COULD be all true for all I care.       you're out with a qt who loves you when you see this  what do     He already has with NotWhammu.    The illustrations from the book are online. Here's PB Dio with his stand, The Passion.    notice that there's a weird "hand" like quality to the way araki draws feet    still thinking irene and steel ball run are in the same universe</span>    We all know he can't draw feet.     We still don't even know what the plot is.    OH MY GOD, JAHHHHHH! is my favorite Anthology song.  What's yours?     KillerQueen already can.    well, I'm ashamed     Since the anime is over, how would you rate the adaptation of David?  I give it a 8/10, it was good, some parts looked like ass, and as an adaptation, they didn't have to be 100% loyal to the manga, but it was nice to see the manga animated.    Chapter 44 when?   this is what I came up with     Looks good, keep going.     umm ok    I'm confident they'll animate the first six, but like you said anything after that is a guess. DiU and SO are long, but doable. Steel Ball Run is a different beast altogether due to it's length and arc structure. As long as the do the rest of the per-reset parts, I'm happy. I really want to see Morioh fully animated    Those aren't the illustrations. The in-book illustrations are done by Araki. The ones on the website are just sketches related to the book that the author himself did. Could be the entire plot, could just be random shit.    Araki only drew the cover, nothing inside.    All the books in the VS JoJo series had interior illustrations by Araki though.    Except for Jorge Joestar.    This made me really sad, Anon. Sad that they didn't use Roundabout and sad that the journey is over.   if they actually make more parts in the anime 4,5 etc. will they use the VAs from All star game? I really like Namikawa voices Giorno   Really? Because guys here really hate how he does his Stand cries.    Not that anon but I thought he nailed it    I hope not. Josuke's VA doesn't suit him at all.    The main JoJos, probably. But from what I could tell with ASB, CC2 didn't consult with David Pro about casting judging by the voice changes in Part 3. Though from what I can tell, the anime cast now do the characters in the next game.  If they keep Josuke, Okuyasu, Kira, Rohan, and maybe Koichi, I'm happy. Really the first three are the most important. Oku and Kira are perfectly cast.      You bastard  <s>;_; why couldn't it have ended like this. no sono chi no sadame</span> no get back</span>  </s>      Who else could they cast as Koichi?    I just love Romi Park so they better keep her.    keep coloring, anon-kun?    I think he needs more intensity in his mudas but otherwise he was perfect much better than romi was.   no raw yet?  Hey, lover, I got a sugarcane That I want to lose in you, Baby can you stand the pain Hey, lover, sugar don't you see? There's so many things that you do to me Oh baby! (hey, lover) All I want to see is the love in your eyes And all I want to hear is your sweet love sighs (hey, lover) All I want to feel is burning flames Tell me, tell me, baby, that you feel the same Tell me that you feel the same way I do Tell me that you love me girl We'd be so lost, in our mouths, the best, I feel it everyday (every way) You feel so wrong, be alone, if you just follow somebody someday Soft and wet Soft and wet                  That's the real reason why she was introduced at all.

Get rid of that grey. All of it.     ok   Let's take a break from history and geopolitics.  Orimoto will change the way that shipping wars are fought!  Old thread:       I want to kill this fucking cunt  <s>he's already dead</s>    Reminder that Haruno is a loser who has nothing better to do than fuck with high school students  If Yukino was Raoh, who would Orimoto be  <span class="quote">&gt;5 seconds faster</span> Guess you win?   Good Irohasu~, everyone!   Reminder that Haruno was right and 8man betrays himself when he sacrifices himself for the sake of preserving the status quo.     IROHA OR DEATH R O H A  O R  D E A T H                  He realizes the reason he fell for her, and he hates himself for it now.   So did Orimoto realize she was walking into the Lion's den?  As a Yukinofag I apologize for my brethen's faggotry, have a yuri    So what the hell is Haruno's game?   Best case scenario is she's acting out a more twisted "love" for her sister than even Yukimom is by trying to control Yukino.  Worst case scenario is she's a jaded bitch who just wants to watch the world burn.      yfw 8man is actually the Joker</span> You have nothing to threaten me with... nothing to do with all your strength.     SORE ARU    studying actually matters and it is what everyone is focused on</span> We're talking about the Japanese system here. Studying is actually important in HS and less important in uni.     Truth. They work their asses off in high school to get into a good university where it's basically a four-year long booze-soaked fuckfest while they live out the adolescence they were deprived of.    four-year long booze-soaked fuckfest</span> No, not exactly right either. But they can take it easier.      the reason he fell for her</span>  What reason would that be? She's an insufferable cunt.      Only true ending   The snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a full moon floated fat and white as a snowball. The stars shone cold and distant. As I made my way across the corridors, the school seemed an alien place, where every door and window had grown icy teeth, and all fields had vanished beneath a white blanket. The dressing rooms were behind the soccer field, a spacious room cluttered with showers and benches and lockers jammed full of shirts and shorts. I had always found them uncomfortably crowded. Not tonight. The chill was palpable.  “Winter,” I said. The word made a white mist in the air. Then something slammed me in the chest between the ribs, hard as an androphobe's fist. It drove the breath from me and sent me lurching backwards. What… Who… A football was sunk almost to the stitching in my chest. No. No, that was how my sister died.  He stood in a pool of shadow by a locker, fit, broad-shouldered, clutching another ball in goalie gloves. “Hayama?” My classmate set the ball down. "This pains me, Hikigaya. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes… but you were threatening to undo all her mother’s good work, to reconcile Haruno and Yukino-chan, bind flags to your little main girl, unite the Service Club under genuineness. So…”  “I am sorry.” Hayama wrung his hands. “You are suffering, I know, yet here I stand going on like some fucking cunt. Time to make an end to it.” The soccer captain pursed his lips and gave a little whistle. I was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through me. I glimpsed movement, heard the clacking sound of steps on stone. A child emerged, a pale girl in a pink apron, no more than sixteen or seventeen. Another rose up from the showers. The girl who had spoonfed me before was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced children with amber eyes, mostly girls. And in their hands, the daggers.                   She's amusing. Laughter is one of the few genuine emotions.    Made for each other.    She's nice to everyone  8man doesn't even SPEAK a lot to classmates, so he feel something special with Kaori.   In reality, Kaori just see him as random classmate she doesn't particularly get attached to.  Like, that's the entire point of nice girl rant. Cruelty born of kindness.          No this time.    DA-YO-NE.   does Zaimokuza appear at all during volume 11? Or has the war for Hachiman become too serious for everyone's favourite chuuni novel author to be mentioned?  Yuckyno a shit. A SHIT.  Iroha a best. A BEST.  The soccer competition seemed pretty heated. I didn't pay too much attention to sports in general, but it was clear the match for prefectural champion was probably going to go down to the wire.   It was all part of that youth that I despised so much. These pointless battles for a trophy that would end up drowning in dust within a few years, lost in memory to anyone who cared. Then why was I here? Only because of Isshiki's request.  "This is a formal request by the student council to the Service Club! Let's cheer on Sobu High at the championship!"  Yukinoshita was going to decline, but Hiratsuka was in the room and thought it was a good idea. So here we all were, sitting in the front stands of the local soccer pitch. Hayama and his team seemed in top form, but even they were struggling against the other school, the defending champions. Yukinoshita noticed me rubbing my hands together and handed me a thermos. Max Coffee. My savior.  "Thanks, Yukinoshita." She merely nodded, her eyes focused on the game. Yuigahama to my left was doing the same, cheering loudly whenever it looked like we were making an approach, and screaming when we were on the defense. I couldn't ever see myself this worked up about a sport I wasn't even participating in, so I was content simply to watch in silence. Isshiki was with the student council's official cheering section, which seemed appropriate enough.            It seems like after the cooking event, things get really heavily focused on just the service club and a few peripheral characters like Haruno, Sensei, and Komachi.    <span class="quote">&gt;Yukino sits in the clubroom in her chair, chained </span> Yui has a big kitchen knife in her Hand</span> Yukino tries to scream</span> Yui gives her a fist into her mouth, pulls Yukinos tongue out, and cuts it off</span> Yukino cries but can't make sounds</span> Yui continues pulling out Yukino eyes one by one </span> Then takes out her teeth one by one</span> Yukino is still alive and has a seizure</span> Yui stucks her knife into Yukinos heart and takes it out</span> She puts it in the dustbin</span> 8man comes back from the toilet</span> Sees Yukino face without eyes, tongue and teeth and pukes</span> Yui comes nearer</span> "Hikki, something really bad happened.

You will live within me now, ahahah"</span>                           A whistle, and everyone in the crowd oohed. Penalty kicks. I took a drink of my steaming coffee and passed it over to Yuigahama, who took it gratefully and sipped. I could hear a voice just slightly louder than the rest.  "HAYATO! YOU CAN DO IT!" Miura was screaming at the top of her lungs at the front of the cheering section, with all the rest of the class group cheering with her. I didn't see how central Hayama was to any of it, since he only had to kick 1 out of 5 balls. Only a 20% maximum contribution to the effort.  A whistle. First round, both in. Second round, both in. Third round, the other school missed. The crowd went absolutely nuts until the fourth, at which our school missed. Tied at 3 penalties each, it all came down to the very last kick. Hayato was up and he made his kick effortlessly, the enemy goalie completely misplaying and jumping the wrong way. Then it was the final ball...  Well, of course it would be a miss. The crowd roared, and Hayama was being carried to the podium. He lifted the trophy and I gave a small smile. There, that was my contribution to team spirit. He walked down the sideline, raising the trophy and allowing people to touch the trophy. Everyone was standing up and reaching over the banisters, trying to lay a finger on the prefectural championship trophy. He paused at Miura a bit, and gave her a small smile.  Then he got to our group. He looked at Yukinoshita, then gently placed the trophy on her lap.  At that moment, all the smiles died.              Brothers?  <s>How's the war? Keep killing each other.

After we got off the ride, Yukinoshita was staggering on her feet so she was resting on the bench that was immediately outside the exit.</span>  When I made it back to the bench, Yukinoshita seemed to have bought some kind of thin oblong plastic pouch when I wasn’t around and was putting it away in her bag. After she noticed me, she closed her bag and placed it on her lap.</span>  Yep she bought the picture.       Why does he wear the Bola tie? is he a western fan?     incredible samefag, friend     Better than Cuckino     Probably Haruno said it looked good on him once.     He's just that alpha.

SO FUCKING CUTE    Iroha is cuter   YU MI KO     A SH IT      No, it's actually stupider than that. They're trying to paint her getting actual character development as making her a horrible person. My guess is it's (mostly) the same faggots who sperged out about how cold and distant Yukino was between the StuCo election arc and Genuine.   Why does Hikki dream of lolis?   this delusional</span> Im not even mcmad    Deep down i know Iroha will lose, but she's by far the best gril   HAAHH?!    Don't bully Yumiko.    ahn?

This came so much sooner than I expected that it has me a bit worried.

On the other hand, maybe Iroha's getting the Hitagi treatment where the romance mostly takes place offscreen.     I'll fucking kill you.    So it'll end like Onani Master?

Iroha's actually pretty shy when it comes to genuine flirting. Her dialogue slows down to reflect her rising arousal levels as she talks to 8man about the chocolate.     yes, thank you anon.    <span class="quote">&gt;Irohafags insist that 8man is interested in her</span> not once has he ever looked or desired her goodies</span>   I always wondered why she always went on and on about his eyes.

That's why she wants to either take it all or leave at once    No, he got temporarily mesmerized by her skirt while playing table tennis on their date in 10.5 <s>Unfortunately for her he wasn't paying that much attention because she still lost miserably</s>  The more damning evidence is that 8man hasn't made any efforts to get to know Iroha better like he has with the other two girls.      In the closet, or she loves them both. Yui's a lot less open about her feelings than the club seems to realize.    have you actually studied in japan? there might be less reading and memorizing stuff but they actually have plenty of projects and activities to keep them busy.    It started off just as her playing playful like usual, as seen in the anime. Her attitude shifts when 8man says he liked it though.     These both always make me laugh, god dammit. Thank you, anons.     They have less reading and memorizing? I was under the impression they have significantly more arbitrary memorization than places like the US.    Something like this, then?  <s>I'm not sure what gets bigger when I see this. My boner at her expression, or my heartboner at thinking of the aftercare that comes next.</s>      Yukino is the most non-genuine girl in this show. She just needs someone to talk to mommy for her since she's too much of a pussy to stand up for herself. She'd fall for any guy who's willing to carry her baggage for her.   <span class="quote">&gt;&gt;- Do you hate that level of sweetness?</span> &gt;- ...I don't.</span> &gt;- Ah. I wasn't talking about the flavor though</span> &gt;She was almost touching her lips and sligtly turned to me, searching for the answer with her eyes. I tasted the sweetness in my mouth and gave Isshiki the words she was waiting for.</span> &gt;- Even so, answer is the same</span> &gt;- ...Is that so. </span>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAA  WHAT THE FUUUCK IS THIS  </wbr>          The more damning evidence is that 8man hasn't made any efforts to get to know Iroha better like he has with the other two girls.</span>  If anything that means Iroha is not someone that important for 8man as he never try get know her better.      Yukino shouldn't be protected,  she need to learn to solve her own shit.     he's trying to outsly her i see    Yeah I meant that part as an agreement with the anon I quoted, but providing a more concrete basis for his claim.     I've been waffling back and forth for some time on Haruno's motivations between "benevolent onee-san looking out for her sister" and "psychotic monster hell bent on exposing genuine as a lie because she doesn't believe in it".  I guess what I think now is that due to past issues they've gone through, she's constructed an elaborate image of Yukino in her mind since childhood. That of a helpless little girl who does nothing for herself but stand behind someone stronger than her to show her the way. That image is of course not inaccurate, but Haruno isn't necessarily able to see how much Yukino may have changed since then because Haruno needs herself to see Yukino that way.  When Hachiman started to really become important to Yukino, some of Yukino's old demons resurfaced alongside it. Haruno instantly spotted it and went on the attack. Note in the first season, during the culture festival, Yukino asks Haruno to help them perform while Hachiman looks for Sagami. Haruno refuses at first but Yukino stands up to her and Haruno is honestly impressed. She tells Yukino she has changed, but Yukino says to the effect that she had already been that kind of person, Haruno just couldn't see it in seventeen years.         I agree, I was just saying Yui doesn't have that problem.   <span class="quote">&gt;look down and frown</span>  Is this like her finishing move or something?    Something that more sinister than trust is expectation. That was what makes Yukino is not genuine because she place expectation toward 8man just like her mother place expectation to her.    BDs never</span>   sorry for being this guy but where can i read the volumes  Oh god fucking damn it, look at what happened. I knew I should have taken it easy, look at all the SHIT that cam out of my ASS.   Even Feel tried telling us about just how much she changed in his eyes. That nigga can't stop admiring her anymore and he shot himself in the foot pretty hard on that younger girl / komachi conversation in the club. Also some anons said that he couldn't stop looking at her in that scene in the novels, but we don't know that yet.      NEVER FORGOTTEN!    You should call a plumber.   Am I the only person who didn't see the love triangle coming?     How come I'm such a hopeless Yukinofag? I'm more of a dog person tbh    MC + 2 main girls love triangle in an LN</span>  WOAH O A H         Some people just can't help it, Anon.    I've always preferred cats myself, but I'd rather die than abandon this precious angel.    You're a dog person and you're into dogshit. Why the confusion?   <span class="quote">&gt;Last illustration of volume</span>     Because we dog lovers are fast to recognize the genuine. Just like Yui recognizes the thing Yukino and 8man have for each other.    I know how you feel. I'm usually more into characters with actual personalities, but I can't help but love Yukino!    They are on a date. What?    Dogs aren't genuine though. Pack mentality is programmed into the brains. Cats on the other hand only do what they want. If they like you then it's because they like you, not because you're the pack leader.    I fucking love you, anon.    Your passive aggressiveness isn't welcome here.   I was expecting something from these 2, in this volume   nigguh please, cats sometimes act tsundere as if it were some sort of instinctive behavior while dogs are easy as hell to read    This bitch didn't even make chocolate or teach anyone to make anything, why did Iroha invite her? All she did was act like a bitch.   Yukino won  The Iroha faggots were going overboard with the spoon scene, but 2ch says it's 8man shooting Iroha down.   A shit. A SHIT.    I was quite shocked when I read those spoilers too, because we've never seen 8man deliberately flirting with anyone like that before. I kept trying to find excuses and stuff like that to downplay that quick exchange of words and thoughts but I couldn't find any reasonable one. That's a huge flag between both of them, if anything. But it worries me that Watari would write something like that when the (still) obvious outcome is Yukino and the main focus is still Yukino.  Basically I don't know what to think of it.        She's cute but no, she hasn't won yet.    stay mad   Watari didn't mention anything about volume 12 being the final volume in his afterword.  How would you feel if volume 12 is in fact not the final volume?     1 more year of suffering.    Kill myself    calling out autist trio for friendzoning each other</span> the only person pushing 8man to take action</span>  Yeah, what a cuntbag. In other news, Iroha has no feelings for 8man.       That only means I'll be stuck with this shitty general for a longer time.    Fuck off    Got a link for that?    What does the text say other than that talk about the pleasure of being cummed inside?    I'm glad it isn't. It would probably feel rushed to solve everything in one volume when we still don't know even what the fuck is Yukino's problem.      General dies with anime, there will be occasional LN thread but that's only when Spyro descend from heaven.    She was invited because "Haru-san-senpai desu~" is fucking adorable from both Iroha and Haruno.    If there's a volume 13 Iroha wins, since that's going to be her birthday.     Gets called to help students make chocolate</span> Does nothing but stand to the side with Hayato and make the Service Club act all awkard</span> 10/10 would ask alumni for help again.       vol 12 he ends up with winner winner chicken dinner vol 13 he drops all contact with butthurt losers the rest is all about him learning how to be a boyfriend Komachi crashing their dates and other lovey dovey shenanigans.       What does Iroha gains from being friends with Haruno?    Why did people think it is the final volume?    This girl needs to die    http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>anichara2/1435023502/l50</wbr>    Nothing, she's terrified of Haruno too.    You tell me, Satan    She knows he likes pretty onee-sans. And if they're on good terms with eachother she'll let 8man fuck her everyother weekend and have threesomes on his/her birthday, christmas, and valentines.     It was a montage. I'm sure Haruno and Hayama didn't just stand there the whole time.    http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi<wbr>/anichara2/1435023502/l50</wbr></span>  trust me that's fake. I've read all the novel and nothing news about iroha after chapter 4 6-7-8 is haruno vs yukino, sleep over, aquarium date, Yui fullfil her baking request by giving Yukino a edible bag of cookies. 9 is about the club, yui confess, yukino request ....      Aye, probably FEEL skipping around HARD    What baking request?    They're setting up the college edition of the Service club with Haruno and Iroha.    nothing news about iroha after chapter 4</span>  Iroha is a supporting character. Good.      Yui fullfil her baking request by giving Yukino a edible bag of cookies.</span>  You mean giving 8man right?      Yui request Yukino teach her how to bake (ss1)  she already win LOL ( i hope so)  She did give him in chap 6? and it's poison, 8 man nearly puke. He ask her if she use mirco wave to bake this shit.... Then Cuckinoshita give him a leftover bag.         What's fake? The spoon scene or Hachiman turning her down?    trust me that's fake. I've read all the novel</span>  I don't believe you.     Where the fuck is Spyro? How can he be absent at a time like this?    He seemed pretty worn out last time I saw him on these threads.  He's probably crashing.       LOL</span>  Kill yourself!      After the chocolate event, it's all about the Club, komachi high school test etc.... Not sure if Hachiman turn her down offscreen though.      Actually now that I remember he said he had to go on travel.      Sleeping, translating, avoiding shitposting. Usual Spyro things.   Now that's alpha.   LOL</span> i</span> ... and used after a period for a total of four dots (two times the error)</span> Cuckinoshita</span> Am I Haruno? Why am I hanging around high schoolers?          Probably killed himself because Yukino didn't win.   Were there yahari thread in the hiatus between S2 and S2?   I fucking hate how they did the last scene in volume 10. They made it look like 8man was more averse than he really was. In the LN they were being playful, Haruno offered some advice and 8man took it seriously. In the anime he looks like he's just getting mad and wants to leave.    Why?    Kill yourself.    Are you saying the spoiler is fake or the claim that 8man is "shooting Iroha down" is fake?  Because pic related is pretty damn conclusive in Iroha's favor and it comes with artwork.   It's not surprising. Romance not involving the club isn't directly relevant to the story. If Iroha does hook up with 8man it would be Monogatari all over again.         No because there's no time between S2 and S2     LOL </span> .....</span> cuck</span> Kill yourself        Is it that guy with the biased as fuck translations? I hope he never comes back    i dont know LOL   Irohasu~  In all seriousness, my heart goes out to all Irohafags.  Because it is still very, very clear that Yukino is going to win at this point.     the claim that 8man is "shooting Iroha down" is fake</span>  She dont even appear since then.      :3    Is it that guy with the biased as fuck translations?</span> Stop regurgitating shit  If Spyro stopped you better say goodbye to good LN translation       Kill yourself, autist LOL    LOL</span>    LOL</span>  Fuck off!     YAHALLO   Who trusts this LOL translator?    We've known about the illustration since before episode 12 aired. And nothing's "pretty damn conclusive" when the translation that Irohafags have been screaming about was posted with no japanese text or anything else to reference it against.    Irohasu~    What's your point? If 8man is flirting with Iroha for her last interaction in 11, then that means it'll be the status quo between them in 12.  The scene is, very clearly, not a rejection. At least if you can read it.     neat.   Except he translated chapter 2 of 10.5 completely intact. Sometimes I wonder why he still managed to put up with you fags.    <span class="quote">&gt;2 girls chasing after MC for 10 volumes</span> new girl chases him for 2 volumes and takes him away</span>  Where are the austistic Yuckynofags and dumb Yuifags now?      How much for the shipping?    Yukinofags are all the same, honestly. Lying shitbags with no lives just wanting to hurt others. He's biased as shit he can die for all I care.    implying he's an Irohafag</span> I'm sure he's probably talking about Yui's 'suki nano' translation.

How would you react?         yui confess</span> Her confessing to 8man or her telling someone else she likes him?     Nice falseflagging faggot    Not shitposting like the Irohafags do every thread.     1000 yen I think     I'd go read the actual chapter on kyakka instead of a faked epub chuned out by a desperate Irohafag.    with no japanese text</span> Here, I'll even highlight it for you. You can fuck right off if you think I'll typeset almost 2 pages worth of text just to humor you.     I wonder if that means mines is shipped as well.    Reject what? It's just like the Anime, FEEL cut off Hachiman inner thought and Iroha 2nd question.  That's all, next day Yukinon apologize Yui and 8man for Yukimom event.     攻  　　　　　　　 │  　いろはす　│　ゆい  　　　　　　　 │  策士───┼───頭使わない  　　　　　　　 │  　ゆきのん　│　サキ  　　　　　　　 │  　　　　　　　 受   か？             I can buy the kindle edition, can't I? It would be downloaded in no time and it's cheap.     bothering to rank Saki</span> I'm impressed     yukino on the schemer side</span> You fucking what    I just want Saki to be happy.  Hachiman just needs to explain what exactly he means by 'genuine'. Obviously the girls don't know. I mean Yukino even asked him and he didn't answer.  I suggest he convey it with an interpretative dance.     You forgot she could manipulate people to do things for her without lifting a finger?    I'm referring to 's claim that 8man "shot Iroha down", which would mean a rejection.  8man answers her second question positively in the spoiler.      You can't honestly expect everyone to take a spoiler at face value when there's no hard evidence to back it up. Until either Spyro chimes in as a trusted authority or someone transcribes the text that corresponds to the passage about the spoon so people who can't read moon can compare it, you're going to have to suck it up and deal with skepticism.    She could but doesn't do it. Or maybe she's so good we don't even notice it.     You anti-Irohafags are the true cancer of the treads    You Irohafags are the true cancer of the threads</span>  FTFY      waaaah, stop raining on our parade with your logic</span>    Reminder: the "genuine thing" 8man isn't remotely complicated.  His whole monologue about wanting to understand but not be understood and "sour grapes" is nothing but the monster of logic spewing sophistry in his struggle to grasp an inherently emotional ideal.  It isn't a specific relationship or type of relationship.  It isn't exclusive to either platonic or romantic love.  It is nothing more than being honest with the people you care about. Telling the truth even when it might hurt them, and trusting them to stay with you and work through whatever pain may come so your relationship comes out stronger in the end.            Irohafags don't insult other girls unlike Yukinofags and desperate Yuifags, and we love her enough to post enough about her a lot. You shitters complaining about it are the true cancer     If it isn't complicated why did Yukino ask him to clarify.  And why does he repeatedly state he doesn't know what it means.       Someone already has and if you can't be bothered to check the thread or the ones before, you can fuck off too.  Hell I'll throw you a bone. Here it is in Jap   「えいっ！」  「先輩、こういうの甘いの、お嫌いですか？」   「・・・・・嫌いじゃねぇけど」   「はぁ。別に味の感想聞いたわけじゃないんですけど」   「それでも、答えは変わらんな・・・・」   「・・・・そうですか」  「参考になりました。じゃ、ちょっと行ってきますね。葉山せんぱーい！」   「甘すぎだな・・・・・」   You can go find the eng TL in this thread and the last, etc. and compare and see that's the TL is correct.                       Fair enough, I'll wait. It would take a really audacious nip to scan 5 pages of fake LN with official art while lining up with both the anime and said art though.    It's already been confirmed.   Any antifags are the cancer of this thread, just ignore them they when they shitpost, although in this case it isn't shitposting, it''s just an Anon with doubts.       Why isn't she making any progress on her food?    Definitive proof that Yukino steals away 8man as he reluctantly dates Iroha.    Fuck off Yukinofag I'm not a cuck like you    That's exactly what I was talking about, now was that so hard?    You could've just read and looked for it in the pages leak, but why would you care since it seems you're too lazy to read them or can't even read jap.    posted a picture of a shit</span> accuse others of shitposting</span>  u wot nigga      Reminder that sensei wins if 8man does nothing      I'll be glad to see you guys gone once the anime ends      Tits too big for Yukino, can't save.     After she gave Yukinon the cookie bag. She confess about how she is a selfish girl, want everything.......then she tell them if everyone know what other is thinking, then things will not stay this way anymore, it'll change.  Hachiman just stay there and listen, he didnt speak a single word. Yui pull Yukino hand, and ask her what's her problem that's she hiding form those 2. Yukino said she dont know Yui said that's our answer Yui said if she wins she going to take everything, She want everything stay this way, unchange. Every one just say what they're thinking, no matter the consequence, everything wont change. Just like a sweet lie. Hachiman still hasnt said anything, Yui ask Yukinon if it's alright with her? Yukinon: I-I....... I think it's alrig---  Hachiman feel like that isnt like Yukino at all so he decline Yui method "Yukino problem she must solve that herself"  Then he begins his "Genuine and lies " talk, too long dont want trans. He dont want to lie to his IMPORTANT person, so that he want GENUINE, he want the TRUTH Yui said it's just like him and smile. He cry again (yeah cry after genuine talk again, and he feel embarrassed) After that Yui and Hachiman look at Yukino, waiting for an answer Yukino knows, take a deep breath and said she hasnt agree with anything, dont decide people feeling by yourself. Yui smile and nod "that's right". Yui and yukinon look at each other, smile. 8man thought these 2 are telepathy or something. After that is Yukino request. Scene end with a sunset and 8man wondering what genuine look like, we'll know about the request in Vol12.                    a shame that they won't animate the moment Iroha wins    What are your guys' interpretations of his last line? Is he saying she's too sweet after all? Is it "too sweet" with positive connotations? Is Watari leaving it intentionally vague?   比企谷いろは  一色八幡  Oh, I like these. Straight from another thread where people were saying that it was Hayama who got ignored.  http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>anichara2/1434150709/</wbr>       Looking at that thread it might be how they're interpreting the part about the けど.    Yui said it's just like him and smile. He cry again</span> God damn it 8man.    I don't think Oregairu is popular enough for /a/ to have good threads in years from now.  Will there be LN threads, or do I have to go ahead and make a forum myself?     want everything</span> What is everything?  She want everything stay this way, unchange.</span> Everything being unchanged isn't what she truly wants. Is she trying to stop a romance between 8man and Yukino?  That scene is great character development 8man to Yui</span> Be genuine 8man to Yukino</span> Solve your own heart              Typeset anon here and I'm working on it.    people were saying that it was Hayama who got ignored.</span> When was that? When Haruno brought up his chocolates?     In a few years we're going to have White Album 2 come out. It's going to be blast with that.    You sure you didn't mean this thread? http://hello.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/<wbr>anichara2/1435023502/</wbr>     okay, now these are spoilers I can believe   Why did Orimoto's eyes look like this?   White Album 2</span> D-demo... genuine...     So more than the actual fucking book?    Have you done http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50993569  Yet?  </wbr>    realized she got friend-zoned bc he gave her the star instead of the heart, which makes her want to try for the 8inches    Yes, normie. That's why you buy in bulk.    The thought of the 8er makes her moist. Isn't Orimoto kind of skanky? She is only interested in 8man after she realizes he is covered in bitches and is an edgelord.    pretty typical, yeah. There's cheaper shipping but good luck getting your fucking copy before August.  speaks the truth, buy moar and mitigate the cost of shipping per item.    Oh baby.   He cry again (yeah cry after genuine talk again, and he feel embarrassed)</span> Hahaha... Oh wow...     Crap, three long pages. I haven't, but I guess if there's a translation I'd do it. Please include SFX. Maybe use http://thejadednetwork.com/sfx/?    second biggest slut after Haruno. 8man has market value now, clearly, so she ditches the fags at her school and makes a play for the guy swarming in banging bitches.    He cry again (yeah cry after genuine talk again, and he feel embarrassed)</span> What a fucking pussy.    What do people meant by the "Iroha or death" anyway?   So literally nothing happens in volume 11?  The fuck. Its just continued circle jerking.      Every one just say what they're thinking, no matter the consequence, everything wont change. Just like a sweet lie.</span> I don't get it, why would it be a lie if they're all saying what they think?  Anyhow, what exactly did Yui confess? She just said a bunch of vague things.       Iroha Akubar, fgt   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127098827</span> How did I mess this up so badly? Disregard.  They just might be reading too much into it, like some have pointed out.</span> Overall it doesn't sound like a turn down at all.</span> Fixed        So Yui still being Yui after all.   She only know solve problem by keeping status quo that's why she reveal her own method to hear how both 8man and Yukino response to it. Basically she create situation where three of them try to open up their own mind about each other issue and how they look their situation.  Really In the end Yui is the nicest one of three member.         They're being ironic. Iroha's popularity is a symptom of the show going nowhere; people see an outlet for their intrigue in this new character.    8/8, got a giggle out of me    I did the TL but several of the SFX are not standard and I can't make heads or tails of them.    Is she nicer than Orimoto?     I figured he was going to break out the water works again after this scene started getting spoiled earlier today.  It's like the service club is a relationship that evolves through stages. There's the initial stage where they all misunderstood each other but got along nevertheless that lasted until the student council affair. Then there was all the tension as they realized they didn't really understand each other. That lasted until the first genuine talk. Then they started to try to understand but it still eluded them. Things got progressively worse until this scene, which is probably the last big turning point. Thus the note of optimism in the final chapter title, though it also may refer to Haruno and Yukino.       Threesome ending become more likely now.    Yes    If they're all saying what they think, thing will change, that's what she think. She want everyone keep acting like nothing happend.So that's why she said she want everything. She want Yukino tell her what's her problem      8man and Iroha flirting</span> Yui confirms Yukino is the cookie guy</span> 8man tells Yui to be herself</span> 8man tells Yukino she's not getting the main heroine rescue treatment</span>  Quite a lot happened. What I'm wondering is how 8man telling Yukino to figure her own shit out was really any different than when Yukino told him to solve his own problems. He might be getting manipulated by Haruno.          Cried again</span> Sasuga windows     OTP TOT PTO       Last time he cried her scored lots of potential ass, does it work again of is he hurting that end?     Yui confirms Yukino is the cookie guy</span> What? I thought 8man was the cookie guy.     Cookie man is actually Sable     Well according to anon's spoilers it seems like it has a definite positive effect.  I wonder if Iroha was secretly listening to this moment too.       If you have a Japanese IME it should be easier for you to search it in the SFX site. I think the site accepts romaji.  Sorry, but no SFX TLs makes my typesetting for me a living hell. Please and thank you.     Why are they so melodramatic?  https://kyakka.wordpress.com/yahari<wbr>-light-novel/volume-11/chapter-1/ As always doing God works  Based SPyro  </wbr>   at this point I'm not sure if posts like this are actually someone who believes shit like that, or if it's just someone trying to carry on the bit.    It's logical, the moisture of his tears made his eyes less disgusting. +1 charm if you may.    because meme drama    That's the part I don't understand. She wants to act as if nothing has happened, but also wants them to speak their minds out? If they speak their minds out, there's no way they'll just be able to pretend they didn't. So, if Yui doesn't want things to change, wouldn't she rather the other two not to say what's on their minds?       GOD EXISTS    The fire has grown out of control, it seems. What a delicious scene to read.      God he translates fast. I really have to hand it to him.  Although I think it'd be wise if he read the whole book before he began translating. Maybe he did and just blew through it blazingly fast.       She gave Yukino the bag of cookies didn't she?

Yui gave 8man the cookies, not Yukino.         CHURCH OF SPYRO RECONVENES YET AGAIN    Maybe he did and just blew through it blazingly fast.</span> Probably pissed of shitposters and impostor.     I just finished faping and now I see this. Based god     God exists and his name is Spyro    It's only part 1.  There's like 10 parts to a single chapter.      THE SKELTAL ARMY REJOICES     That is chap 6 , She gave 8 man the cookie and he's nearly puke. He said if she use the Viber cooker to bake it? And in chap 8 She gave yukinon to fulfill her request to Yukinon - Teach her how to bake.      How is he so fast what the fuck?    This makes me a happy skeleton.    Oh fuck I forgot it's already the 24th in Japan.    Nips already eat lunch now   <span class="quote">&gt; “You know what I mean……?

That's why she reveal it to 8man and Yukino to heard how they response to it.Because even she telling herself she is fine with their current situation. she knew it willnot same to other two. She wants three share their own thought and choose what kind relationship they actually wants and How they makes it happen.       That makes sense. Surprisingly cunning from the girl with the 'normal brain'.     He's omnipresent    Yui</span> Normal brain</span>    I still chuckle every time 8man calls Oouka a virgin.   Spyro leaves Friday and I remember hom typing that he wanted to at least translate some of the volume before he left. I guess he did get his copy early, afterall.    Yui is actually clever when it comes to normalfag things, and seeing as 8man and Yukino began to distance away from being reclusive loser, it's a good chance to strike them and bring them out of their half-open shell.    Out of the 14 sfx I know 13 of them. I managed to get the last one now because the author combined two at the same time, I finally realized.  If you'll do it I'll post it.      But what's the point to it? I mean, correct me if I'm wrong but what you're saying is the following: "Yui wants them all to speak what they think, and then pretend they never said anything."  Is that correct? Because that doesn't make much sense, and is actually rather counter-productive. Why would you want to tell others what you think (and hear what they think) just to pretend nothing happened? If you wanted to pretends nothing happened, why simply not keep things a secret?  Or are you saying she told 8man and Yukino of that silly idea, just so that they would speak their minds out regardless of what they did afterwards?            She's a misunderstood genuis.    "Yui wants them all to speak what they think, and then pretend they never said anything."</span> No, I think Yui want them to ignore it if they want to and go back to the oh-so-comfortable status quo.  Essentially she challenged them. Because she know they hate lies.        Not the one you are responding to, but I think what she told them was how she really felt, knowing it would lead them doing the same. And that communication would help them find a way. Yui's always about communicating. Just like the first genuine talk. She's like "Hikki you're finally going to talk to us".   She's always been the bridge between the other two. And she does it again here.      <span class="quote">&gt;God, I’m not going to make it!”</span> “It’s okay, you still have time! Just keep going! Don’t give up!”</span> I casually looked over and a caste of girls sitting at different seats, either the second or third group from the top, was knitting some kind of muffler or sweater. It’s almost like I was listening to a conversation between a light novelist and his editor. Look, normally, you’re not going to make it. It’s almost Valentine’s Day and your progress is only at about ten percent. Rather than putting effort into making it on time for the deadline, it’d be more productive and realistic to try to extend it instead!</span>  Poor Watarin      8MAN = PAN-SAN YUKINO = GENUINE   YUKINO 8BOWL FUCKING CONFIRMED <s>FUCKING CONFIRMED</s> <s>GET HYPE</s>        Because she want to help yukino with that's method. And 8man againt it     the bitch winning the 8bowl</span> Why would you do this Watari      Ah, so Yui is going against what she wants? Yui wants things to stay the same. She wants everyone to ignore their issues and pretend they aren't there But, because she knows 8man and Yukino want the genuine, she told them how she felt to bait them into speaking. Is that how it is?        Nigga why you wasting time shitposting when Based Spyro has granted us manna from heaven?    Yes      Damn sly bitch      Because he isn't a hack-iroha-faggot like you     Not him but I read Spyro's manna in like 2 minutes.  So waiting for the next one.       It doesn't take 5 minutes to read what he translated so far   Patiently waiting for translations.   Bruh, that's like a 2 minutes read.    But there’s also the saying: “If winter comes, can spring be far behind?”</span>  Haruno end incoming.      he thinks I like the lesser of two bitches</span>    No she gave the cookies to 8man in front of Yukino in chapter 8, like I said I read the whole chapter in moon.  I'm guessing you got this idea from reading the chink's summary because that guy got it wrong as well.      How is he not when he made Iroha on purpose?   What was all that shit about Yui and Yukino not being friends earlier?  Anime ep 12 = chapter 5   Can you make a summary of all the relevant things that happened in this volume?    better chocoLATE than never</span> well done, spyro hopefully commiefaggots taking notes      She's a plot device.    Sure, I'll work on it. Might take a while, but I think I can finish before the next episode airs.   Well you know the problem that plagues the service club isn't gone just because Hachiman made another tearful speech about genuine that moved them.  And I don't think what Yui said regarding her feelings was a lie. She said it knowing it would be rejected and lead to Hachiman and Yukino talking through things, but it was sincere all the same.  So the fact remains that romance will kill the service club. Or at least Hachiman/Yukino romance will. Barring more character development from Yui of course.       In the form of a love interest.    Okay. Only people who love Yui will like it, it is very Yui heavy and sorta out of character.  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=50993569 Text in () are instructions or comments not meant to be on the comic  Page 1 Panel 3 sfx *creak*  Panel 6 Okay, it'll be sunday.

He'd make a great ally in changing the world.    So the fact remains that romance will kill the service club. Or at least Hachiman/Yukino romance will. Barring more character development from Yui of course.</span> Yui never really specified that 8man and Yukino going out would make her leave the club. Perhaps, she's just assuming things if they all start getting closer (especially considering how complicated 8man and Yukino can be, due to their issues), or that Yukino may just drift away if she (Yui) and 8man become a couple.      Oy, what the actual fuck it this shit. This isn't funny you nigger. Tell me those are wrong translations or fake spoilers.    <span class="quote">&gt;tfw I will never be a 2d boy and steal Komachi from 8man.</span>  This "genuine" stuff is a cancerous obsession.

Daily reminder : Best Friend forever, Just like Watari and Eguchi Takuya Saika will win in Vol12, Yui+Yuki yuri, Iroha NTR 8man</span>    Yukino is a side character and lacks popular support. The best she can hope for is winning the Hayama or Yuibowl.   If Yui and Yukino ever duel it out they should have contests on how better to please the 8. That is the plot of a doujin I have in my head if I could draw.   Quit you're bitching, you won the series a year after he left. I am a Tigers fan.

I wish that were true m8    Yui's #1 on 2ch, which is pretty much the only ranking that actually matters.    tiggers </span> LOL  But the chicken and beer fiasco that was Bobby Valentine set this fucking team into the abyss.   2013 was a fucking fluke year, even we don't deny it.   Everything has been shit since that clown came around.          What is Yui doing to Yukino in this pic?

He’s asking whether or not the death and decay that come at the end of something always mean that a rebirth is around the corner.</span> He’s hoping that’s true, because he can feel himself decaying.</span> Yukino - death and decay</span> Haruno - rebirth</span>  GET READY           Yui* things    Yukino is #1 on the LN readers ranking though.    here, breathe in some cyanide gas</span> thank you Yui</span>    <span class="quote">&gt;8man telling Yukino to solve her own problems</span> Thank Yeezus. No white knighting, no save a ho-ing.    Who was it then ?    2ch, which is pretty much the only ranking that actually matters.</span>    Even as an Irohafag, I suspect he's going to reverse his position soon.  No matter how I look at it he seems to just be doing the same thing Yukino did prior to the GENUINE speech, but maybe a translation will give us more context.       Dank Yuri</span>    Yamato. The other two guys are made to sound like violent douchebags, while he gets to enjoy a slight bump to his reputation as a player. Of course he's the rumormonger. He couldn't help but use it as a chance to make his stock rise.    Too bad the volume ends with them promising to solve Yukino's problems for her.    For LNs the Kono Ranobe wa Sugoi is the ranking that matters the most, though.  Rankings in 2ch are as good as rankings in Reddit or 4chan for Western things.      He's telling Yui    He thinks some ranking where first place doesn't even have more than 400 votes matters</span>  what a cuck       Haruno moved into Yukino's home, called Yukino out for having no self.</span>  Sleep over at Yui's home, Yui's mom a qt. 8man nicknamed her Gahamama.</span>  Girls talk, Yui ask Yukino for a date.</span>  Threesome date at aquarium.</span>  Yui told 8man she is not a nice girl, Yukino admitted she has dependency issue. </span>  After the date Yui gave 8man a bag of cookies, then this  happen.</span>              Can't wait for Miura end out of nowhere.  even after the volume end the valentine day hasn't over yet. Guess we have to wait for another volume to see whether the Iroha ship sinks or not. (If she wont try to do anything before the end of the day then no matter what happen later her ship sure will sink like the TItanic)   move aside plebs, best gril coming through    Basically He telling Yui to be herself.  And she is smiling upon hearing that.      Did 8man actually flirt with the slut or was it taken out of context?

And reddit is an accurate representation of modern young adults too. Which this place is not.           She did seduce him while touching fish at the park.    It's not specified so it's whatever you believe until Watari says otherwise.    Yui never really specified that 8man and Yukino going out would make her leave the club.</span> having this shitty of a memory</span> remember that yui stopped attending the club when she thought yukino &amp; 8man were going out     is this the best written series of all time  <s>because yukino's repartee is giving me a hard-on</s>     Hope everyone moves along, leaving chance for OMK ending.

And it's okay for me to be here.</span>  Omedetou </span><s>Haruno</s>                I meant Iroha. Did they really flirt with each other or what.    Yes and that was ages ago when they weren't nearly as close as they are now. Next are you going to argue that 8man thinks Yui's a slut because he called her that when she came to the club room for her first request?    Yeah, almost at the beginning of the series, when she wasn't nearly as close to Yukino as she is now.    Sure, if you overlook the other 8 billion romantic comedies that this one has formulaically copied.  Seriously, if you think Yukino has witty banter or sharp insights on the human condition, you're better off watching some shitty bible sermon on basic cable.      yes, i dont think Spyro can stand that though. Might take a week to recover.    holy shit I cringed    And reddit is an accurate representation of modern young adults too.</span> It really isn't. The people there are as opinionated as people are here, and they also believe they're the centre of the world as much as 4chan and the Tumblrshits do.     K, I'm wrong. 1st place isn't more than 500 votes    fuck my life, I fucking hate Iroha and I'm sick and tired of her getting all the flags. And now this? Just fuck it dude. Thanks for the honesty, though.     Who? Iroha?  Yes they did, the translation was mostly correct. However it mistranslated a crucial part.        cheeky.    However it mistranslated a crucial part.</span> elaborate please, don't give me false hopes.    <span class="quote">&gt;there won't be a doujin with 8man fucking the Yukinoshita women</span>   Spyro is traveling holy shit, if he can stand this for years I don't see why he would quit now.    Brothers!    The translated passage sounds just enough like it that Irohafags flipped their shit about it for an entire thread.  So the actual answer is "no"      Yui told 8man she is not a nice girl, Yukino admitted she has dependency issue. </span> 8man hate nice girls</span> Yui ending confirmed.      less than 500 votes</span> That's even worse than Saimoe isn't it?     What makes you think any of the other girls deserve the flags that Iroha has made for herself?    You know, With all the Kawasaki motorcycle jokes, I think you guys are missing out on another great pun with your usual greeting.    Everyone was too focused on eel innuendo.   I don't want to sit here wondering for months what happens. Just tell me /a/, who is going to win? Not who you want to win, not who your waifu is, just tell me who will really win.       That is not a good thing that she's getting all these flags. It may be just to make her fall more painful.   Where? Do you mean that sentence with 嚙み砕く?       Open end followed up by a Vita VN with a route for everyone.     This.     Also have to ask when will she die soon as it has been implied through S1 and S2 her health and heart is seriously fucked    Yukino if he can save her, Hiratsuka if he fails to save himself.   IROHA OR DEATH   &gt;Sleep over at Yui's home, Yui's mom a qt.</span> Good good, more milfs.     if he can save her</span> he just told her in no uncertain terms that she has to save herself</span>     Yukino will win and then they break up in the epilogue.    Yukino if Watari wants to play it safe  Yui if he's planning on keeping the focus on the service club members but wants to tell a story that hasn't already been told a dozen times before  Iroha if he doesn't mind the end looking like a borderline asspull (or he gives her a lot of development in vol 12)  Any other girl if he feels like going for the asspull  Friends/Loner end if he's still as jaded as he was in high school.           What happened to that guy who said Yui wasn't possessive, she would not suffer, was falling out of love with Hikki, and that there won't be any love triangle? Has he publicly apologized?   Not him but I recall at one point people misread 甘いすぎだな as 甘いすきだな.  That said the line was really ambiguous either way.      Where? anime thread? as i remember LN thread is basically Yukino thread   They have their own magazine, it is not your average poll, what do you think the score beside the vote are? even publisher GAGAGA used that poll to make Oregairu CM         I'm talking about the 「・・・・・嫌いじゃねぇけど」  The translation took out the けど part, that's why some nips interpret the scene as a Iroha rejection.   However it could be they just read too much into it.           I'm going to watch it and enjoy it and there's not a damn thing you can do to stop me.   <s>Thinly veiled Gate thread</s>     Im in iwakuni and some of my jgsdf friends wish this thing didnt exsist, i dont blame the its probobly just going to be propaganda.

O WOW an outdated warcraft so cool. When ever i see those on base i laugh.    Oh. Do you mean the tank? Wasn't sure where you were going with that post.   But yeah, the JSDF in this story is being supported by the US with hand me downs.      That's fair enough but you have to admit the nippon-strong propaganda is laughably bad in places. The scene where every other nations special forces are just a bunch of incompetent idiots comes to mind.   <span class="quote">&gt;Dragonball creator Akira Toriyama stated that Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is weaker than a Super Saiyan God.

Beerus is a terrible name and you should feel bad about it.    Post your favorite reaction images this season.    This thread and  are doing me wonders.  It's kinda from this season      Buyfag thread, read this before asking questions http://buyfag.moe  <span class="quote">&gt;everyone is generally negative on nendos</span> All I have is 22 nendos and that Parfom Aegis.

Blood relation isn't important for nee-sans but it's important for imoutos</span> It's either one or the other fuckface, you can't have separate standards for both. Fucking hell this is why nee-san fags are scum.      I didn't realize that Sora wasn't allowed in imouto threads. To think, she's not an imouto even though she's constantly referred to as such.      blood relation is essential to the whole thing. I'm not sure you're actually have the same interests, maybe you just like older childhood friends, like you said.     Twin sister who walks the line. Her fierce loyalty is her best feature and if she works on her faults she would be perfect.     Her entire arc is about her working on her faults and overcoming the most egregious ones.
