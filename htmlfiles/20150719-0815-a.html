Makes me wish she had her own Atelier game and could be a super cute alchemist all the time! I appreciate the art, thanks again!</br></br></br>   try to draw a waifu <br> misplace reference <br> go to look for them in the thread <br> they got a delivery long ago <br>why me</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just finish it anyways</br>  <br>Just search on the archive, fucktard</br>  <br>Draw another waifu.</br>  So, how the fuck did Hibiki forget the song she's sang like, literally everytime she's activated Gungnir? Or did she lose her voice?  So apparently Carol's seiyuu used to voice minor nameless background characters in previous seasons.<br><br>Glad to see they recognized her talent.</br></br>  Not enough people listened to her song.  <br>We're too busy listening to Nana's.</br>  <br>Her one song?</br>  <br> I'm talking about the OP. </br>  She didn't forget. That was just &gt;Commie<br>She just can't sing it when Gungnir doesnt support it or something.</br>  She lost her determination to fist.  <br>She's having the Symphogear User version of ED.</br>  I think this is almost entirely confirmed now.<br><br>Autoscorer = mechanical musical doll<br>Activation with stolen memories = building a sample library<br>Symphogear GX = Idols vs Vocaloids<br><br>All we need is for them to get their own songs and it'll be a lock.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She looks so bullyable.<br><br>I want to steal her hat and tell her alchemy is shit.</br></br></br>  Did they retcon it being broken in half in G because they didn't know they'd be making a new season?  <br>This fucker would've ended this season in one episode.</br>  low Determination to fist  <br>Maybe she glued it back together.</br>  <br>It grew back</br>  Gungnir is supposed to be used to TEAR DOWN your opponents without any remorse. It's for MANLY girls, not whiny bitches.  <br>You're really asking this when the episode just revealed the bad guys power themselves by feeding on people's memories?</br>  <br>This is one thing. The relics were originally used as super weapons to kill people; it definitely wasn't a tool of defending.</br>  <br>Hibiki is just a female Touma though.<br><br> Such Misfortune vs I am cursed.  <br> Goes around correcting people's lives and punching them <br> Crazy white haired enemy turned protagonist helps out.  <br> Gets mentally fucked over by an overpowered loli.  <br> Has a harem of hot chicks <br> Has a foil of someone trying to fuck up the world with a power similar (Fiamma with ihs Right hand/Maria with Gungnir) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She lost her way man. Gungnir is not having any of this shit.</br>  <br>Giving back Gungnir was a mistake<br><br>- Maria</br></br></br>  迷いはないさ拳に包んだ<br><br>There's a fucking reason Gungnir isn't letting her sing the song. Her actions and thoughts are the complete opposite of the lyrics. Maria was right, Biki needs someone to slap her shit before her hesitation gets someone killed.</br></br>  <br>Phonic gains.</br>   killing the noise in the last moment even after having her gear destroyed <br>Truly the best sword.</br>  <br>Got one right here</br>  <br>How did she knew it back in episode 1 without anyone teaching it to her?<br><br>It's just something the users should know instinctively, it just comes to them. And now it's not, because Gungnir's had enough of her shit.</br></br></br>  <br>You're an idiot for thinking Commie's line was accurate.</br>  <br>Mariafags are the worst</br>  Did they fuck to pass the time on the long plane ride to Japan?  <br>I'd assume they slept at some point. And on a private jet like that there'd probably be only one bed, if any.</br>  <br>But Ogawa was there too, do you think he watched?</br>  <br>I thought she also voiced Chino.</br>  <br>Ogawa is a girl too.</br>  <br>Airplane seats can fold back to make a bed.</br>  <br>Gekisou Gungnir is still my overall favorite Symphogeah song, so not really.(even though I do love Nana)<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=AV5<wbr>3-z37pm4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>The song wasn't in her heart</br>  <br>Yeah, Chino and the oppai loli goddess.</br>  <br>Meant to reply to </br>  <br>Just accept that Hibiki is the useless one now. She's going to sit at home and cry while Maria is saving everyone with Gungnir.</br>  <br>That picture just screams "HIBIKI, SHOW ME YOUR WAR FACE."</br>  <br>They're also the most delusional</br>  <br>Not the useless one though. She's useless along with Maria.</br>  <br>She's voiced main characters in other shows, but going from nobodies to main role in one show it kind of cool.</br>   Heavenrend <br>Why is this allowed?</br>  Is it me, or the staff and voice actors have great fun making this anime?  <br>Airgetlamh Maria &gt; Gungnir Maria</br>  <br> HIbiki is the useless one <br> Not just building up tension for a renewed Bikkie to come along and prove why she is the greatest.  <br><br>Do you even into dramatic tension?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you can't do anything about it, faggot.</br>  <br><br>Also:<br>Dolls' dancing = MMD</br></br></br>  Blue=Green&gt;Yellow&gt;&gt;&gt;Red   H&amp;D   <br>Pretty sure Nana absolutely loves this show.</br>  <br>I can complain about it on 4chan, bitch boy.</br>  <br>I do, because it's the same shit as last season.</br>  <br><br>We're just fed up with all the "Maria is useless" shit we had to deal with up until now. Now you're getting it right back into your faces. Deal with it.</br></br>  <br>Some of the fancier jets have specific accommodations to have beds set up in them.</br>  <br>Sounds like we're still several episodes away from that, though. Hopefully someone else  Maria  gets to kick ass in the meantime.</br>  <br>I fucking lost my shit when they had that drawing in the anime</br>  Hibiki a shit. A SHIT!  <br>No. They just pretend to so people buy it. They just care about the money.</br>  <br>Damn, we got a badass over here.</br>  <br>That does look like a lovemaking cave.</br>  <br>And it was the same shit in the season before that. <br>What's your point? Symphogear is cyclic in how it deals with it's plot. <br>It's amazing how Chris and Tsubasa haven't reverted personality-wise.</br></br></br>  <br>Go home Commie dev.</br>  <br>Shit=Shit=Shit=Shit<br><br>What's even your point? You can rank shit all you want, doesn't make them gems.</br></br></br>  <br> We <br>Speak for yourself, I love Maria and making useless jokes about her was just a way of expressing my love.</br></br>  <br> 浮かばない <br> forget  <br>I hate commie.</br></br></br>  <br>It just isn't as badass the third time it happens. Especially when you can see it coming a mile away. In fact I wish they would just skip all the bullshit and get on to the original stuff but I know it won't happen.</br>  <br>Hibiki will get good mid-season and it'll be fine from that point onwards.</br>  <br> both crowded onto the bed <br> turbulence <br> Maria is now on the floor </br></br></br>  Biki a shit.  <br> They're too into it to care and continue on the floor </br>  <br>Maria would be on top of Tsubasa to prevent either of them from falling off.</br>  <br>Maria was hit by the same bullshit. She'll continue to take the wrong path to get shit done just to continue to have her be a counter to Hibiki and keep Hibiki on the right track. <br><br>Symphogear is definitely running on a "We're not sure how many seasons we're getting so we can't really plan ahead" and the writing suffers for it</br></br></br>  <br>Kill urself my man</br>  <br>Now she's going to watch Miku get mouth raped right in front of her</br>  <br> turbulence <br><br>Tsubasa can't be that rough can she?</br></br></br>  <br>Wait a minute, that Noise...</br>  <br>What should it be?</br>  <br>She's gotta vent the 4 years of frustration somewhere.</br>  I dropped the series with the first season after episode 9. It just didn't live up to the hype. Does it get better? Should I go back and finish it?  <br> Does it get better? <br>No.<br> Should I go back and finish it? <br>Yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you didn't like it by then you probably won't like it now honestly.</br>  <br>Are we getting another season filled with retarded cliffhangers that are resolved 2 minutes into the next episode?<br><br>Because while that made for fun threads, story telling wise it was fucking stupid.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm expecting her to force her way over this hump and with the help of Dáinsleif end up going too far in the opposite direction so as not to get paralyzed by fear of hurting others again. She'll end up hurting herself even more and we'll see a return of berserker Hibiki. Probably end up needing Miku and friends to drag her ass out of it.</br></br>  <br>Whether you finish it or not is up to you. <br>We can't decide for you and 99% of people here are going to have a positive opinion of the series so we'd recommend you continue it but our opinions are biased.</br></br>  <br>What answer other than "Yes do it" are you expecting in a Symphogear thread?</br>  <br>Just finish season 1 an decide.</br>  <br>She's been with Chris, the one who is really rough around the edges. She's picked up on her wildness.</br>  <br>Yes, its a great brick joke. That drawing was fake concept art for a samurai noise that Nana drew as a joke. Now its her character's depiction of what the noise she fought looked like.</br>  <br>Should I be jealous of or feel sad for Maria that she has to endure all this built up Sakimori frustration?</br>  Will they overcome the need for LiNKER with their gayness? Will one be reckless and end up jamming?  <br>Yes because Chris and Tsubasa having their gears dismantled was solved within two minutes of the next episode</br>  <br>Chris would be a docile kitten in bed though, you see how she reacts to anything remotely lewd.</br>  <br>She just got to see her naked. How can you feel bad for her? She probably even touched her.</br>  <br><br>they'll probably get alchemically made LiNKER or some shit around the time alchemy fixes the other relics.</br></br>  <br> fake concept art <br>It was the "design a noise" contest they had during the Symphogear 2013 Live.</br></br>  <br>But it's not really third time. In first two seasons she didn't want to fight, punchede enemy once and somehow everything was Fine. Now Hibiki is tired of going through this shit again, so she can't even tranform. This should happen sooner, but we're finally getting proper character developement for Best Girl.</br>  <br> implying she doesn't love it <br>They can fight for dominance in bed.</br></br>  Would you let one of the dolls kiss you even if it meant death?<br><br>I would.</br></br>  <br><br>Ayahi is so cute.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing that image is burned into her memory now.</br>  <br><br>Just be glad you are watching it while it airs. I can't imagine how bad it must be for people that marathon it later.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, someone has to pilot the SONG sub while Genjuro goes out to save the day.</br>  <br> we're finally getting proper character developement for Best Girl. <br><br>Thanks God we're finally getting another Chris arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Where are the ones for 2nd and 3rd episodes?</br>  <br>The sub has ranged weaponry. It makes sense to send out Genjuro and Hibiki to melee some motherfuckers while Chris takes control of the boat and wastes all the ammo.</br>  <br>If you're watching Symphogear you shouldn't care about story telling.</br>  <br>I don't even see what they could do for another Chris arc, her character is pretty much wrapped up at this point.</br>  What happened to the invisibility relic that the FIS helicopter had?  <br>The only path left for a tsundere to take: deredere or yandere.</br>  <br>You should care, you should also understand that it's going to be retarded.</br>  <br>Erased by Miku.</br>  <br>SSJ had been destroyed by lesbeam in S2E10.</br>  <br>I imagine since it was invisible they couldn't see it, so they lost it after the frontier sank.</br>    Why retreat? They could have killed all the gear users right then and there.  <br> Everybody walks the dinosaur </br>  <br><br>yeah, it's the relic Miku was equipped with, so it's gone.</br></br>  <br> Glad to see they recognized her talent. <br>She probably gives a mean blowjob, yes.</br></br>  <br>Make it a really short season.</br>  <br>If you're watching Symphogear you should also learn Japanese because commie a shit.</br>  <br>"The words won't come out" or if you want to be hyper literal and remove any room for doubt "The lyrics aren't welling up inside me and flowing out naturally like they always do."</br>  <br>That relic was Shen Shou Jing. Miku turned a defensive relic into a goddamn gay cannon.</br>  <br>Remember what Maria said after Phara retreat?</br>  <br><br>That's not what they wanted.<br>Main objective was to destroy the gears.</br></br></br>  <br>They're probably aware of the tropes.<br><br> have chance to kill protags <br> knows that the most common thing to do is to retreat and let them get stronger <br> also knows that if they try and finish them off this early, protags will either get a macguffin to save them at the last second <br><br>Carol knew it wasn't worth wasting her time since it ends the same either way.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I seriously had 0 problem with the plot of season 1. <br><br>The character development was tight. <br>The pacing with good. <br>The sense of scale progressively increased.<br>There was foreshadowing for basically everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chris cool senpai arc. Chris learns to cook arc. Chris complete's Genjuro's training arc. Chris "dies" like Brad in Wild ARMS 2 then comes back with a fucking railgun arc.<br><br>The possibilities are endless.</br></br></br>    <br>Then they could have called the TSAB and let professionnals deal with this threat.</br>  Is there some final or duet version of Apple?  <br>Okay, but why leave the gear users intact? For what purpose? So they can come back later with even stronger powerups?<br><br>Refresh my memory</br></br></br>  <br> Chris cool senpai arc. <br>Currently this is the most possible arc.</br></br>    You wouldn't a homunculus would you    <br>I'd make her a vagina.</br>  <br>Try to make your own speculation first.</br>  <br>The relic just resonates with the song in her heart.<br>Now that she has doubts in her heart, the relic won't do shit.</br></br>  <br>Why would you ever program your creations with a moral code? That's where you fucked up Carol.</br>  <br> Try to make your own speculation first. <br>I can't. It seems paradoxical to me. That's the point.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe Carol is just like "kill only if necessary".<br>The dolls need memories to function and they can only get them by killing people. Well okay, it's necessary.<br>The Symphogears can be destroyed easily without killing the girls? Then just destroy them, no need to kill them if not necessary.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Miku plz?</br>  <br>Holy shit this. Season 1 was a fairly well told story all things considered. Of course I'm one of the few people that actually liked the first few episodes of S1.<br><br>G was just more insanity and tons of "le epic moments and epic threads let's spam reaction images." Which admittedly was fun, but I'd prefer for GX to actually attempt to tell a decent story, I do actually care about these characters and their development.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Maybe Carol is just like "kill only if necessary". <br>Aren't the symphogear users a threat to their plan? In that case it should justify their deaths. Heck, they might not have even needed to kill so many people to awaken all their fighters if the symphogear users were just out of the picture entirely.</br></br>   Ver showed in a flashback with Fine <br> Everybody saying that they can't fix the relics without Ryouko <br> They also don't have Linker for Shirabe and Kirika <br>Just accept it, bring back Ver to produce Linker and fix the relics.</br></br></br>  How did she get up on this rock?  So how many prominent characters will the redhead kill? It will be at least one.  So, if Fine ever comes back again, do you think they'll bring in Sharur as a plot relevant Relic? <br><br>Fine is clearly Sumerian, and Sharur is the only weapon from Sumerian Mythology that's famous enough to get its own Wikepdia article. Its a mace.</br></br>  <br>Phonic Gain.</br>  <br><br>Symphogear always was and always will be a massive trainwreck, a pretty funny one at that.</br></br>  <br> kill only if necessary <br>She's trying to destroy the world. That will kill everyone.</br></br>  <br> bring back Ver <br>They'll bring back Fine.</br></br>  <br>Ghost Serena carried her.</br>  <br>Maybe Carol is just leaving the relics broken so that she can get the Sympho-girls all together and vulnerable so she can wipe them out in one clean sweep. <br>Maybe she needs them alive to get certain information in their brains for the eventual memory taking.</br></br>  <br>It's weird that they're hyping her up because it's not like the dolls that are already awake couldn't easily kill every one of the gears.</br>  <br> trainwreck <br>Stop this. The Symphogear train never wrecks even when it goes off rails. It's running on water at this point and everyone loves it.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know, I'm just trying to find at least some in-story reasoning for the blatant "villian doesn't kill the good guys when she has the chance because then she would win" self-sabotage-trope.</br></br>  <br>S1 was never a trainwreck. It was simply good and fun.</br>  Kirika finally got a decent henshin. Also, it looks like Shirabe will be mirrored on the other side eventually. Anyone else looking forward to their duet?  <br>So it won't betray you duh.</br>  <br><br>Isn't the point here that he expected a trainwreck but got something awesome?</br></br>  <br>I think it's more like Carol needs gear users' power according to Carol's attitude and reactions.</br>  <br>Presumably the same reason she was demanding Hibiki transform rather than just killing her immediately.</br>  <br>I'm not. DMJii is shit-tier.</br>  <br> Kirika/Shirabe dual henshin <br>Please god this is all I want.</br></br>  <br>His image contradicts his post.</br>  <br>Is that how they're going to overcome their LiNKER weakness? By singing/fighting together?</br>  <br> Okay, but why leave the gear users intact? <br>No one who makes decisions is allowed to have an IQ in the double digits unless you have a handicap like Ver's insanity or Genjuro's flock of weaklings who need him to do everything without leaving HQ.</br></br>  <br>As I remember it, transformation sequences are up to the animators with the simple order to "make it look cool".</br>  <br>Season 2 started coherently enough. You got nice scenes with Chris adjusting to new non-edgy life. The villains plan was reasonable. <br><br>But then you get to the end where everyone was fight eachother for randomly even though literally everyone except Ver had the same objective, stop humanity from being killed by the moon. <br><br> Oh my god, we have to defend Shirabe from the mirror energy blast before it erases everything it touches! <br> Wait nevermind, it only erases gears and it wouldn't have hurt her in the slightest <br>There was shit like this repeatedly thoughout the entire season.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Which Euphonium would you blow into?  <br>All of them except Contrabass.</br>  <br>Yold ya I love me the redheads - middle gal, please</br>  <br>The one that's not a slut or a whore.<br>So, none of them.</br></br>  <br>The hell?</br>  <br>You don't blow a Contrabass, so I won't blow it.<br>I'll gently use my fingers to play her strings, if you get what I mean.</br></br>  <br>Taki</br>  The Princess of Euphonium.  <br>Gotou's girlfriend.</br>  <br>tuba</br>  <br>Midori so I can make fun of novelanon for fucking his waifu.</br>  Don´t you hate when Lelouch occasionally have good taste and likes the same girl as you?  <br>But girls don't have dicks.</br>  <br>That hair is brown, not red. Are you blind?</br>    <br><br> both hands on the same shoulder </br></br>  <br><br>I have not gotten around to watching this show yet but meganekko and the one in the white one-piece on the bottom row are by far the most attractive.</br></br>  All of them but mostly trumpet, MC eupho, eupho-senpai and best girl eupho.  <br>He likes Midori? Isn't she mostly useless/irrelevant?</br>  <br> the one in the white one-piece on the bottom row are by far the most attractive. <br>Regrettably she is a total bitch.</br></br>  <br> cut off at the feet <br>fuuuuuuuck</br></br>  I want a doujin where Kumiko eats out Reina and she says<br> In this moment, I am euphonium </br>  <br> Regrettably she is a total bitch. <br>Explain</br></br>  I didn't watch this yet but I can tell that ponytail girl is best girl.  <br>You've never had a background character as your favorite character?</br>  <br>The answer is still Natsuki.</br>  <br>She's in love with a man 18 years older than her</br>  <br>The one with the glasses is a legitimate sociopath and the one the white one-piece is an autistic chuuni.<br><br>But they're still the two best girls and  is a fag.</br></br></br>  <br>Correct answer</br>  <br>And that's a bad thing?</br>  <br>I don't know YOU tell me</br>  <br><br/></br>    <br>You're talking about the one with the cap right?</br>  <br>That slut.</br>  <br>As long as he is nice and cares for her,his age is irrelevant.</br>  <br>He doesn't care yet she still goes after him. First class austistic wouldn't rate as best girl.</br>  <br>Yup, the other one look like a semen demon.</br>  <br>  /a/ is so naive to the real world its pretty sad. </br>  <br>Well I guess I have a thing for autistic girls then.</br>  <br>Natsuki is best girl! You have good taste my man.</br>  Do you feel healed?  <br>My grandad was 20 years older than my grandmom. They loved each other very much.  ;-; rip in peace </br>  <br>none</br>  <br>He cares about her, its just he's not interested.</br>  <br>Which one of them would make the best single mom and which one of them would make the worst?<br><br>Pretty sure the worst would be Natsuki. The child would probably starve to death, or she'd forget the child in the supermarket or something.<br><br>Best would probably be Midori. Asuka and Reina are also strong contenders, but they would probably be helicopter parents and the child would have an awful time growing up with a control freak mother.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When has he cared about her?</br>  <br>I would blow air into Reina's ass.</br>  <br>When she was a kid, he cheered her up by playing music with her. He also does seem to respect her as a musician and thanks her for the confession, even though he clearly put the distance between them as teacher and student.</br>  <br>Wow that's really deep my man he sure do cares a lot</br>   using girls in the metals section <br><br>Who is directing this travesty?</br></br>  Isn't Kumiko a lot closer to Taki at the end of the novels?  <br><br>What's her secret?<br><br>How can she be so erotic?</br></br></br></br>    All the third years, Natsuki, Kumiko, and Reina. In that order. Then in reverse order. Then in a big pile.  <br>She has a good mentor</br>    Holy shit, this is the biggest trainwreck I've seen in years. Disregarding for a moment the nonsense plot, the whole directing is completely rubbish. No sense of flow, no aesthetics, it's just random pandering scenes pieced together in a desperate attempt to make some money from the degenerate otaku. Don't even get me started on all the bloom and blur, the terrible CGI, all the forced animation, etc.<br><br>ＦＵＣＫＩＮＧ　ＤＲＯＰＰＥＤ</br></br>  <br>I know pasta when I see it, but I don't actually recognize this one.

Crisis averted.</br>   waiting for Asenshi <br>You fucking skeleton bitches.</br>  <br>Skeletons, you say?</br>  It's finally over. Ending was satisfactory, but the overall show was still shit.   ignored the show since day 1, because fuck "hurr an ep every 2 weeks" <br> now can watch through it in one go </br>  I'm amazed you made it through the end. Congratulations.   Chibi Usa goes off to help Sailor Moon <br> Other senshi mention that they should probably go with her <br> Queen just shakes her head "no" <br><br>Inner senshi get shafted yet again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm amazed myself. I wanted to drop it halfway through the first cour, I stuck with it because I wanted to fully see how the adaptation would turn out. <br><br> "We got close to a perfect adaptation of the manga so what is there to complain about?" <br><br> I fucking hate MAL.</br></br></br></br></br>    Knew when I saw ep 1 it would be a pale shadow of the original. Both openers have exactly the same plot but direction/cinematography of the original is miles ahead.      <br>Now that Crystal has ended, maybe in another 20 years we will get the reboot that Sailor Moon deserves. It can still follow the manga plot but with some elements or allusions to the 1992 anime plus the seramyu and tokusatsu which in itself was following the manga plot but differed later on.</br>      <br> another 20 years <br><br>Everything about that would be fine but I just don't want to wait another 20 years for it.</br></br></br>      <br>Rejoice, at least your children can watch it.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br>        <br>If it did happen, by the time it came out my children would probably be too old to give a shit.</br>      why did this turn out so shit but dragon ball super turned out good?  <br>No idea. Toei dropped the ball on this and Saint Seiya.</br>  <br><br>Because Toei doesn't give a shit about any properties other than Dragon Ball.</br></br>  <br>That's why Tri will fail. I already lost all hope for it when it turned from tv series to movie series.</br>  What arcs did the anime cover, put the show on hold around ep 10 because the directing got very bad and the pacing got shit on hard.  <br>Dark Kingdom and Black Moon. Don't bother watching the rest though.</br>  <br> It's finally over. <br>There is a "See you soon" at the end and a planed announcement though</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Hey, were these characters in the show? Cool.</br></br></br></br>  At least the Black Moon arc was better as a whole. Black Lady is still best girl.  <br>Crystal is an ONA. It has a lower budget. DBS is on tv with a higher budget.</br>  <br>When is this announcement supposed to be?</br>  <br><br>They haven't said. It'll probably be a few weeks or months.</br></br>  I don't get it. The director, producer, and composer had all done great things before (and even together, with Suite Precure.)<br><br>It has to have been some sort of higher-up decision to make the show the way it was. Probably the same people who decided to make Tri into a handful of movies and give DBS a hundred fucking episodes.</br></br>  <br>This man. I liked it, and it made me like Chibiusa more than I did before from watching the old show and reading the manga</br>  Venus and Tuxedo Mask were literally the only likable characters in this mess.  <br>they got shafted the whole time in this show<br><br>not even the 90s show did that as bad as crystal</br></br></br>  <br>Missed out on the announcement of a planned announcement, but yes I was aware of the "see you soon" at the end. When I said "it's finally over" I was referring to the fact that this travesty of a show was over...for now and whether a second season was coming was up in the air based on what I had read earlier. The rumor I read that a second season was in the works was called a mistake at the time. I guess that is not the case now.</br>  <br> ONA <br> Lower budget <br><br>No excuse. There are other ONAs that were produced in the past that look way better than this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>i think toei is focusing on DBS so their budget has to shift <br>when they finish that you can bet sailor moon crystal s will come</br></br>  Were there any songs at all other than the OP and ED?<br><br>By this time in the original series, we had insert songs like Ai no Senshi, Eien no Melody, Koibito ni Hanarenai Kedo, etc.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much just run of mill background music and for more dramatic moments they played a children's choir.</br>  My dream would be to see a 90's style Sailor V anime.<br>I think expanding the story would work as well as it did with the 90's anime.</br>  <br>why was the background in crystal so lame and unispirsing <br><br>the original series upbeat 90s jazz and pop sounding music were great <br><br>why couldnt they hire back that composer?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he's dead</br>  but he is a skull in every other iteration    Finally the show which don't exist ended.  <br>Doubt it. It seemed as if Toei didn't even want this remake. They probably hoped fans would forget about the anime and shat out the cheapest possible series to calm them down at the end. Toei only cares about currently hyped endless series, sadly.</br>  <br>the constant delays should have tipped us off really</br>  <br>Does it even make sense for them to do s2? I guess s1 sold like 50 BDs or something. Or did the ONA have high ratings?</br>  <br>It had more than 2k preorders before the show even came out. They didn't lose money on it, but yeah there really is no reason to make an S2.</br>  <br><br><br>If Toei put more work into it, by the time they got to Stars, people would be asking them to adapt the musicals, Sailor V, or new story arcs.<br>They really goofed on what could have been their greatest cash cow of the decade.<br>I still hope Toei finishes it though. It would be more of a disappointment to end after the Black Moon arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  i only watched the first 13, was the show in its entirety worse than the original sailor moon?  <br>It's supposed to be more like the manga.</br>  <br>Oh God. Oh God what is that. <br>This is a frame from Crystal? Jesus Christ I'm so glad I dropped it early.</br></br>  <br>yeah i know i read the manga but its not necessarily better</br>  <br><br>All Crystal did was show just how flawed the manga really is. The shittenou got an even worse treatment in it.</br></br>  Who is this seacat?  Why, that's Furudo Erika of course!  <br>&lt;Good!&gt;</br>  <br>Blimey! I've been duped!<br>The image you posted clearly depicts Kinzo in Erika's clothing!</br></br>  <br>It was actually Furudo Erika with Kinzo's mask all along!</br>  <br>Say it in red, witch of LIES.</br>  <br/>  <br>B-bakana!</br>  <br>I'll say more<br/></br>  <br><br>That's blue</br></br>  <br>You don't have to tell me that.</br>  <br/>  I remember when Umineko roleplay threads were a thing in 2009.<br> Don't bring them back. </br>  Don't mind me, just posting best GIRL.    <br>Don't try to fool me with your tricks!</br>  <br>Seems like you entered a logic error!</br>  <br>Eh, I'm too lazy to do that kind of stuff~<br>But please, keep fearing us.

I did find parts 5-8 but I can't seem to find the first parts anywhere. Would you guys mind giving me a link, or at least pointing me in the right direction? I'm a complete newfag with VNs and haven't managed to find any downloads for the few VNs I've tried to look for in the past.<br><br>Pretty please?</br></br>  <br>How much do you desire it?</br>  <br>Battler - the noisy faggot.</br>  <br>Moderately.</br>  So I guess that's a no then.<br><br><br> Polite sage for being a requestfag. </br></br></br>  Seems the beta PS3 version of EP1 is being released tomorrow. <br>I'm pretty excited for a full 1080p reread.

I wouldn't call anything by R07 god-tier, though. Well, maybe Tsumihoroboshi. </br></br>    <br>Huh. I guess I shattered the illusion of the golden shitposter.<br> Not even End of the Golden Witch? </br></br>  <br>Rosa has a gun, all your arguments are invalid anyway.</br>   Ryukishi will never write a collection of solve-it-yourself mysteries like we had in EP8 with Bern's game <br>That's everything I want from an Umineko fandisc.</br>  <br>W-what is rosa doing to Erika?</br>  <br>I'd take anything as long as Erika is involved.</br>  <br>maybe in the golden land.</br>  <br>End was my favorite ep of Umineko, but the series as a whole didn't do it for me in contrast to Higurashi.<br><br>It's true that Umineko was a more "adult" and ambitious work, and even if the execution was pretty solid, I'd say there were times when I felt the narrative too bloated and disjointed. EP5 was the point where I stopped caring about how coherent were the different layers. And maybe that's why it was my favorite episode.<br><br>Higurashi, on the other hand, was far more enjoyable. Maybe it wasn't the post-modernist and groundbreaking experience that Umineko tried to be, and thus its merits are less, but for me R07 was better when didn't try too hard and dedicate to a more linear plot.<br><br>Also, my attachment to the characters was greater in Higurashi, probably due to the nature of the gameboard-style of Umineko.<br><br>Eh, I think I wrote just convoluted shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like the PS3 seacat pirate logo more than the manga one</br>  <br>shooting her. Or at least trying to do so.</br>  <br>Am I the only one who imagines the gun as Rosas penis forcing it in erika?</br>  <br>I guess it's not for everyone, eh.<br>Have you read RGD? It's very linear and straightforward.</br></br>  <br>I agree with you completely. I just like that picture.</br>  Fuuuuck a friend of mine who was reading umineko quit at the end of two because the existance of witches makes everything pointless in his words. I wish he would at least read up to virgillias explanation  <br>Is your friend 12 years old?</br>    <br> virgillias explanation <br>What does she say?</br></br>  <br>To be fair, according to unofficial sources that was pretty much the general reaction from people, so r07 had to ease things down at ep3</br>  <br>She pretty much confirms that magic isnt real :^ ) and what are you even doing in this thread you mongoloid, go finish Umineko</br>  <br>Oh, I've read it. I just forgot what she told us.</br>  <br>Funny, I'm currently re-reading Umineko with a friend, and at first he didn't buy the magic scenes in EP2, but then shit started to hit the fan, and he doesn't know what to trust now.<br><br>Anyway, Turn has that purpose, to make the reader believe in witches. Even the gameboard and partly the meta end in a very "depressive" and infuriating note, and the point of the Tea Party would be to encourage the reader to don't give up.<br><br><br>It's on my backlog.<br>I'm currently reading Steins;Gate, Clannad, and Cross Channel, but since I already watched the S;G anime, I guess I could stall that and start with RGD. /blog<br><br>I have yet to read Higanbana too, how long is it?<br><br>Also, a guy released a Sui patch for Higurashi Rei, with that two arcs that weren't translated now in English.

Throw some pipelines for oil, gas and petrol, and you're looking to make an absolute shitload of money doing damn near instantaneous trans-pacific trade.<br><br>The author seems to make the same mistake that a lot of non-Americans do, that the US needs the special zone to exploit the resources, when in reality, aside from some rare earth elements the US can get most of its resources from the US and Canada. What the US would actually be interested in would be preventing the resources in the Special Zone from impacting the price of US exports, or making sure all trade is done in the Dollar so it can continue to pursue loose monetary policies without experiencing runaway inflation. The biggest problem with this is that the Japanese Gate appeared in Downtown Tokyo instead of Yokohama or something where you could clear out the neighborhood it appears in and throw in a decent rail yard and logistics depot.</br></br>  <br> spacebattles <br> pasta <br>help me decide i don't know what it is</br></br></br>  <br>What's with that smug rabbit being everywhere ?</br>  <br> passed out half naked Tuka in the background. <br>I've always been a Piñafag but holy shit.</br></br>  <br>Jeez, the empire traveled pretty far, just to fuck some bunnies.</br>  <br><br>Hearing people talking about and comparing military technology from their amateur perspective is really the most cringey part of these threads</br></br>  <br>I see Persia and the medusa girl on a magazine above her head.</br>  <br>Honestly, if this were realistic at all, several blocks of Ginza would be eminent-domain'd and a sq-km area would be sealed off by the military for commercial and other purposes and the subway running underneath would be repossessed and forced to run transport routes.<br><br>The way it's portrayed in the manga is more like a tourist curiosity that you can almost walk up to.</br></br></br>  <br>Would you?</br>  <br>Probably would, but still.</br>  <br>as expected by an elf, she can't stand alcohol during the obligatory onsen trip in Japan</br>  <br>Not sure if soft angora cat down is worse than shaved human armpit skin with hair stumps and goosebumps.<br>Sidenote: blowjob from Persia aftermath probably could be worse than fapping with suede glove<br>Also, there are purring big cats' vids on youtube, it makes you immediately want bringing one home.</br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING SPOILER THIS KIND OF SHIT.<br><br>MY BALLS HURT JUST BY LOOKING AT THIS.</br></br></br>  <br>/ak/ is pure fun anon, don't wish those other assholes on us.</br>  <br>I was underthe impresion that dark elves where the sluts and the lighter elvenfolk merely were rape bait?</br>  <br>Do I have to choose between rabbit tats and dark elf?</br>  <br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>An elf's an elf anon.</br></br>  <br>I don't like you because you're dangerous.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, I don't really understand a lot of things about how they're doing this invasion except that it's necessary to maintain the scale and pacing of the story.

Or does that mean none of our parents love us since they let us fend for ourselves when we're of age?

Last episode was borderline, but I feel much better dropping this show knowing how bad it really is.  <br><br>Welcome to Key, Aniplex and modern best selling "original" late night TV anime formulas aimed at otaku collectors where it's literally all just pure product that has barely left the conceptual phase as opposed to actual functional television with proper storytelling that you're supposed to watch and be interested in over the course of a season. Your average fucking kids show has better and more sensible storytelling these days and I'm glad I'm not just a brainwashed otaku so that I can actually see and laugh at this fact.<br><br>This is why I barely give a shit about the sort of stuff that's popular and talked about nowadays in the anime scene and just watch the shit that's actually good, interesting and have direction and sense of flow with characters that have proper arcs. You know, the sort of shit people barely care about anymore cause they just buy in completely to all the marketing hype behind the late night shit and can't realize that most of these show are hot garbage.</br></br></br></br>  Will Sanic win the idol?

AOTS this, girl of the season that etc. etc. It doesn't take fucking much really so yeah if it's a meme that I think it's kind of pathetic and lame I can only hope it catches on as much as this whole everything is AOTS because some dumb reason thing that's all the rage now.</br></br>  <br>Please stop replying to him, he's a known shitposter from Stalker/Aniplex's shows threads.</br>  <br>It's just perspective</br>  <br>Can't even burn marshmellows</br>  <br>Maybe they'll just show a pic of it hanging out with the redhead during an ending reel for the series or something, if Yusa isn't taking care of it (though that's doubtful since idol and all).</br>  <br>I wonder what happens in the VN if you choose Yui's route<br>Hinata get's ntr'd?</br></br>  One should just drop this instead of wasting ones time. It's like those fools who went through rewrite, hoping that it would ever get good, but it never did.  <br><br>I love you /a/.</br></br>  <br>No faggot, you literally recycled copypasta in that post so it's meaningless shit. Kill yourself</br>  <br>I'm not so sure.</br>  <br><br>I thought the most popular show of the season was that Gakkou Gurashi thing which I admit I've yet to even watch because I probably have no interest in it. Well in any case good job being butthurt that somebody dropped your latest mass marketed rehash of the Key formula that is already showing signs of being rushed and having no real story structure or sense of purpose 3 episodes in.</br></br>  <br>You become the Keybro instead and act as his wingman.</br>  <br>I heard there's no romance in Yui's arc. At least for Otonoashi. Plays out similarly to the anime, I think? Haven't played it yet though.</br>    <br>Those dogs do get pretty big and remember that moeblobs tend to be pretty small.</br>      <br>what car is that supposed to be?</br>  <br>oh shit</br>  <br><br>Just because somebody makes a post longer than a sentence doesn't mean it's a copy pasta. Why is /a so fucking utterly pants shitting retarded that it thinks this? People want to talk memes then that's clearly a good one to start. Remember kids if you type out your actual thoughts instead of just a collection of memes and one liners your just copypastaing.<br><br>Jesus fucking christ, no wonder nobody thinks much of anime fans, they're fucking dumb now.</br></br></br></br>  I hate Nao voice.  <br> Pringles </br>  <br>That bit was great, good acting from Ayane Sakura.</br>  <br>can't unsee it now</br>    <br><br>I like where this is going.</br></br>  <br> Misa <br> moeblob </br></br>    Does this semen demon have a special ability? Place your bets.  <br> Germ Shep heigh - 65cm <br> Average Nip = 171 <br> Crouchin so halve it = 85 <br> Moe so deduct anither 20 <br>Seems legit according to Otaku economics<br><br> Just because somebody makes a post longer than a sentence doesn't mean it's a copy pasta <br> nd this is the best MC because the personality and wicked sense of humor, and nihilistic <br> Not a meme <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They pet the dog?</br>  <br>Looks like it might be one of those tiny old Citroens with the canvas roof. Probably isn't though.</br>  <br>Her only ability will be causing MC to suffer.</br>  <br>Of course, that shit's cute as fuck.</br>  <br><br><br>Thanks anons.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit I remember that was fucking boner inducing, got the name?</br>  <br>She doesn't die even if she's killed.</br>  <br>She's the personification of Charlotte, she'll become a comet in the last episode and leave.</br>  Pray for speedbro.  <br>Is she living her life correctly?</br>  <br>Her ability is to be revived after dying from KeyAIDS.</br>  Realism and logic fags BTFO  Does this mean that there is no chance that Misa has had sex using Yusa's body?  <br> Super Puffy Vulva™  ability.</br>  <br>http://exhentai.org/g/771574/a24f22<wbr>6bcf/<br><br>Have fun.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>No, just because she believes she's correct doesn't mean she's right.</br>    <br>Thank you, damn man. I'll pay you if I could.</br>    This part was so dumb.  <br><br>Fuck off retard, go back to your containment board.</br></br>  <br> Using your innocent idol little sisters body for sex <br>That's just all kinds of fucked up</br></br>  <br>She can make people forget things and she isn't the MCs sister. She made him forget his brother and the experiments they did to him.</br>  <br>Kisama!</br>  <br>Thanks a lot.<br><br><br>And hot as fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>11/10</br>  <br>It's going to get way dumber once we get to the evil science bunker.</br>  <br><br>Generic slut bitch.<br> Typical cliche Licho female character hitting man<br>Is prostitute is the worst of the season</br></br></br></br>  <br>Put glowsticks in his hand. It's only like four frames, please.</br>  <br>And so we have edgy teenagers, the Kyo Ani shitposter, and the BR shitposter all at once.<br><br>We can wrap it up and call it a thread now.</br></br></br>  <br>good</br>  <br>She can predict the future.</br>  <br>Well, it's not happening anymore. Hopefully.</br>  <br> Kyo Ani <br><br>Aniplex, rather. I'm tired.</br></br></br>  <br>Are her predictions the opposite of what happens?</br>  I only watch this for Nao and Sakura Ayane.  <br>And what's nice that happened? He stabbed himself.</br>  <br>He met a cute idol.</br>  <br>Which character is Sakura Ayane?</br>  <br>It was annoying for him to tell his sister about hat. Can't say it was really good.</br>  <br> ate OISHIIII curry <br> got to stand next to Nao-chan <br/></br></br>  <br>The demon that possesses Nao.</br>  <br>Generic slut bitch.<br> Typical cliche Licho female character hitting man<br>Is prostitute is the worst of the season<br>self-inserting</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter, he'll get to hang out with a cute teen idol.</br>  <br><br>Not a meme, just true for how people react. She'll get some sort of half baked sob story to go with her later to make her more waifuable but I'll be extremely surprised if there's anything remarkable about it and if it doesn't just get like an episodes worth of development tops.</br></br>  <br>Come now, does this look like a demon to you?</br>  <br>Idol a shit.</br>  The most useful guy around.  <br> This was the best part of the episode.</br>  <br> exhentai.org <br>Why a panda appears when I open the link? D;</br></br>  <br>Yes. Demons can be pretty, you know.<br><br> I'd love to meet her, her voice is charming. </br></br></br>    Did Maeda forgot Charlotte is supposed to be cold and distant with other people and only open up later to the other members of the Student Council?<br> Because so far she has been acting more like a delinquent/psycho bitch than someone who puts up a kuudere persona.</br>  <br>She voiced Iroha from Yahari</br>  <br>It's an old troll you dimwit. How new are you?</br>  <br>*Nao</br>  <br>She's only kuu when she's alone, on duty she's whatever the fuck she needs to be to get the job done.</br>  <br>With that voice, she probably smokes like a chimney and runs a telephone sex line in her free time.<br><br> I'd love to meet her too. </br></br></br>  What would sex with Nao be like?  <br>Her name is Nao. And Maeda created her, so she is not "supposed" to act in any other way.</br>  <br>Just google image search and leave us alone.</br>  <br>Yeah.  A semen demon. </br>  <br>The show is over and dead now. Please don't mention it on this board again. Thank you.</br>  <br>Pure the first time, super kinky every time after that.</br>  <br> But that's how he fucking described her in that magazine interview that someone posted yesterday.</br>  So /a/nons, are Liltotto and Giselle really kill in the Kuboest way possible, or was that just Jugo looking into the future?  Is Askin the strongest Sternritter (excluding Haschwalth and Yhwach)?<br><br>The fact that he acts like a coward and downplays his power on purpose makes me think he's an absolute powerhouse much like Urahara.</br></br>  <br>He seems like he's more of a strategist who's squishy so he avoids direct combat.</br>  <br>He's in Yhwach's group of elite Sternritters nonetheless.</br>  <br>He probably isn't, unless he was carried into the Royal Realm by the debris.<br><br><br>Ishida is the strongest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>True so you have to figure he has something up his sleeve, something really tricky. <br><br> Ishida is the strongest. <br>When did Ishida become so strong? He couldn't even take out the 8th Espada and he got taken out easily by Tsukishima but now all of a sudden he's strong? I actually like Ishida and I'm glad he might end up playing a prominent role soon but its still kind of BS.</br></br></br></br>   Worst adaptation of this summer   <br><br><br>this joke is becoming more and more boring since everyone use it.</br></br></br>  <br> And this is the big reveal in the manga. Truly a great scene that the anime ruined. <br><br>It was. Especially when you consider the scene it left on before in the previous chapter.<br><br>The reveal in the anime was just flaccid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Especially when you consider the scene it left on before in the previous chapter. <br>How this scene has anything to do with Alium's reveal?</br></br>  <br> Uses the wrong scene intentionally <br>Great job! <br><br>That sure does make the anime not awful.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uses the wrong scene intentionally <br>But it's not. This is the last scene of chapter 4.</br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything buyfag related.<br><br>http://buyfag.moe</br></br>  maybe one day i'll finish gundam. then i can move onto zeta  <br>Then you can watch the true masterpiece, ZZ.</br>  https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order<wbr>/detailPage/item?itemCode=101386728<wbr>2&amp;ref=list<br><br>Version 2 coming too I bet.</br></br></wbr></wbr>  I got something a little different from the usual buyfaggotry in the mail today.
