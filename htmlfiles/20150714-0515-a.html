[ This anime is terrible not only in story but appearance. UFO dropped the ball on this one.  And already is better than unlimited shit works. Based ufo finds a way out of type shit stories and characters.  <br>you no liek heavy shadings?</br>  <br>Not with those sales it isn't. Funny enough UBW is less generic than this piece of shit.</br>  <br>Stay deluded type shiteater.</br>  <br>The story is pretty generic tho UFO could have picked a better series than GE.</br>  <br>You don't even need to be a type shiteater to understand that this show is shit. Stay buttmad faggot.</br>  <br> UFO <br><br>what?<br><br> fate <br> good </br></br></br></br></br></br>  HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK  <br>this</br>  <br> fate <br> good <br>Better than this shit, yes. Are you too stupid to understand my point?</br></br></br>   God Eater <br> A psp game <br> A monster hunter clone <br> A monster hunter clone got an anime <br> A clone got an anime(full series) before Monhun <br> Out of all the monhun clones this one gets anime <br> Not toukiden soul sac or freedom wars <br> God eater <br><br>Yeah, it's pretty shit. Like no joke, the source material was bad too, but his is just shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UFO <br><br> what? <br>The studio making it newfag.</br></br></br></br>  See you next week  <br>Could you explain why or are you seeking attention?</br>  The visuals, aside the awful character designs(I know it's video game adaptation so their clothes must be as terrible as possible) are the only good thing about it. And obviously they aren't keeping the quality on that level forever, this episode had EIGHT freaking animation directors and that's really bad sign along with the delays.  <br>To be fair GE was the most successful monster hunter clone that isn't Monster Hunter itself. Freedom wars bombed upon released and Toukiden was niche even in a niche genre.</br>  <br>Since when were aliens a studio? Ayy lmao</br>    <br> a glorified generic harem school setting powerlevel shounen <br> less generic than anything <br><br>lol fate kids</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>ユーフォーテーブル</br></br>  To everyone complaining that this got an animu before your favourite hunting game did<br>Go cry to the makers of said game. Studios don't choose what they adapt. They are hired by the makers of the source.<br>Bamco are the ones who decided to hire Ufotable to give GE an anime.<br>Why? It could be as simple as wanting to advertise the franchise<br> BUT IT'S NOT POPULAR <br>If that's true, that's precisely why it needs the advertisement.<br>And why Ufo over any other studio?<br>Ufo animated the game openings. The animu art style is the same one they used for the opening of the latest game (God Eater 2 Rage Burst).<br>Now, stop complaining that GE got an animu before your precious MH or whatever other franchise</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, don't tell them. Their tears are delicious.</br>  Why don't you guys like this exactly? I actually thought it was cool as fuck and the soundtrack is pretty nice so far as well.  Why doesn't Bamco localize GE2 RB and Resurrection? Are they idiots like Konami? Plus that anime would pull in a lot of people.  <br>I don't mind the visuals, but all the dramatic slow-motion shots were kind of overbearing, and the show was jumping all over the place towards the start. I'd almost go so far as to say it had worse directing than the first episode of Chaos Dragon.<br><br>Other than that though it was fine, I guess.</br></br></br>  Time to go back to making TM adaptations, Ufo. It's the only thing you're useful for.  I am disappointed in this show.  <br>Butthurt MHfag detected.</br>  <br> fate <br> better than anything <br><br>Lel</br></br></br></br>  I like the style though.  There's no way to have a God Eater thread without somebody bringing up fateshit isn't it?  <br>Are you butthurt or something?</br>  <br>But Lerche and Silver Link are better at those too. Even Shaft had a better opening.</br>  GE is a much more profitable franchise than fateshit so its no surprise the anime looks way better. Based Bamco bucks.  They said to expect a god tier Action and Art!<br>Instead<br>a fucking Shit tier Anime</br></br>  <br> Not with those sales it isn't. <br>I wonder why there is no DVD version for this. There is only BD version on Amazon.</br></br>  More like, Ufallible. <br><br>Cause this anime was a mistake.</br></br>  <br>Wait til the already shit UBW out sell GE,anon. Like it or not but when it come to anime Fate shit can milk more money than GE especially when Bandai Namco and ufotable already shoot themselves in the foot with this adaptation in NIp.</br>  Prison School AOTY Confirmed?  <br><br><br><br>Reminder that UBW will still be an anime talked about a decade from now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair the GE anime was probably an expensive advertisement for the game, like most game/manga/LN adaptations and isn't expected to sell that well</br>  <br>Some shows are BD only now, Love Live S2 had no DVDs too</br>  <br>Yes, Niseokoi is shit<br>I don't see how that's relevant to God-tier Eater</br></br>  <br>Soul Sacrifice wouldn't make a very good anime anyways. And you just know it's going to be a buzzword magnet here in /a/ in the off chance it does happen.</br>  <br>I actually question that. I even wonder if Fate will make it to its 20th anniversary. Will TM even be as popular as it is now 10 years from now?</br>  <br>TM is probably at its peak of popularity right now. Think about it, barring the winter season, there's been a TM show on the air since 2014. We went from 2wei last summer, to UBW in the fall, to UBW in the spring, to 2wei Herz this summer.<br><br>Keep in mind between that two new LNs started (Strange Fake, Case Files), a new manga started (an adaptation of Heaven's Feel), and a big new mobile game is supposed to come out this month.</br></br></br>  <br>All of those games are shit and a MonHun anime would be awful.</br>  <br>Don't forget they're also remaking Tsukihime (although we all know that we'll die of old age before that comes out)</br>  Factual reminder: Fate/Zero is still paying for anything ufo does within the next 5 years.<br><br>I'm glad there is at least ONE good adaptation ufo has done so they can attempt to do things that aren't TM. God Eater is fine and it's a single episode. Stay mad Fatefags that this isn't HF and won't be until next year.  Zero will be paying for HF as well since UBW won't even sell 1/4 of what Zero has. </br></br>  <br>Of course<br> Tsukihime VN remake <br> Tsukihime anime adaptation, one movie for each route <br> Fate/hollow ataraxia anime adaptation <br> Fate route anime remake <br> Mahou Tsukai no Yoru anime adaptation <br> New VN <br> Adaptation of this new VN <br>The ride will never end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zero did 100K, right? First BD set of UBW did like 37K, so that's already above 1/4th.<br><br>Keep in mind too, this is just 5 years after the exact same storyline was done as a movie.<br><br>Shit, a little unrelated, but I just realized FSN did what Dragon Ball is pulling now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most of the budget for God Eater and the upcoming Tales anime probably didn't come from ufo's own pocket but Banco's anyway.</br>  <br>They're having production issues because Kondou had the brillhant idea to do this right after UBW, so expect some QUALITY scenes.</br>   All this shitting on Fate just to stand out from the crowd <br>Neo-/a/ is so kewl and edgy</br>  <br>How is not liking Fate edgy?</br>   Anime based on vydia has shitty plot <br><br>Alert the press</br></br>  <br>I don't know, something felt sort of off about the movement, even for CG. Like they were purposefully trying to make everything move slightly slower than normal or something.</br>  <br>Going by Twitter, it seems some Nips are actually interested on buying this in DVD format.</br>  <br>But that's the one interesting thing about the show.<br>I just think I'll skip this. I like fuckhuge weapons but the episode wasn't anything worth posting about.</br></br>  <br>The characters aren't CG though, only some enviroments and the Aragami</br>  The official God Eater anime drinking game:<br><br>Take a drink every time time slows down or speeds up.<br><br>That's it, you don't need any more rules.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Any trailer from the series is enough to kill you. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=16T<wbr>VwHBGvYg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> would be <br><br>A-anon, I'm SO sorry...<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MmT<wbr>xzZFsmb4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>     still treating a studio like a brand rather than considering the staff within them <br>Also God Eater is being funded from Bandai not from Ufotable's pocket, exactly the same as UBW and Zero being funded from TM.</br>  <br>Guess what else got an anime?</br>  Reminder that this girl is Russian <br>And like to <br> drink vodka <br> being a badass  <br> and is influenced by putin's dick </br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure putin is dead by 2074</br>  <br>Putin's probably an Aragami or dead at this point, besides, 2D Russians are always best girls</br>  Looks good to me.  <br>putin is immortal</br>  <br>Why are you not shitting on this show? Come join the circlejerk, faggot.</br>  <br>If this girl doesn't win the award for most fetishes in one design then no one should.</br>  <br>You fool. You know nothing.</br>  <br>MIND CONTROL</br>  <br>GE2 Alisa is better with the ZR.</br>  <br> miny skirt <br> leather clothing  <br> straps <br>Are u sure she russian</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked the hat better, but I guess the beret is fine too</br>  <br> based on Japanese video game ...  <br>and that is how far in the description section I needed to read into before knowing I'm not watching it<br><br>nips really need to find some original authors jesus christ</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>type-meme bubble will burst one day people will realize they hate how the image or the waifu and husbando are reused to death because they cannot come up with original character designs</br></br>  <br> Underboob <br> Armpits <br> Midriff <br> Short skirt <br> Suspenders <br> ZR <br> Thigh high boots <br> Foreign / Exotic hair color <br> Gloves </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Its better if you watch it in  30 fps   <br>Fool, you forgot the hat and the asymmetry.</br>  <br><br><br>How the fuck is this girl Russian she looks like a American slut</br></br></br>  <br>That's boring, it's a video game adaptation what else would expect.<br><br>I hope these Ufofags stop being so new and retarded though.<br><br><br>They've been 14 years strong with intense sameface. Also if you ignore the Seiba clones their character design is varied.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> contract work <br> thinking studios get a % of the profit from show <br>Where all you fuckheads making these stupid assumptions even come from?</br></br></br>  <br>She came from the Russian God Eater Branch.<br>And her hair is too light of a shade of blonde to be an American anime characters</br></br>  <br>She said she's from Mother Russia.</br>  <br>So are there more than one city located in the world if she is from the Russian branch</br>  <br>Wouldn't they get a cut depending on how the production committee works though? Aside from the payment upfront of course from Bandai or TM.</br>  <br>Why would they get a cut? Out of the good graces of Aniplex</br>  <br>There's a whole bunch of other branches too. In GE2 there are America, Singapore and Rio de Janeiro branches.</br>  <br>I thought that's how production committees work, but it varies depending on the contract. <br>Sometimes they'd get nothing, but other times they'd get a cut of the BD sales.</br></br>  This is how I see the anime turning bout<br>Basically we have to watch a boring MC surrounded by interesting characters but however the MC gets better treatment because he special.<br>And while he's doing everything and the other character will get sideline cus they not the MC</br></br>  <br>yea I don't understand the art style choice. Its horrible.</br>  <br>we could ufotable coudl do better. Go watch ufotable's god eater trailer for the GAME, not the trailer for the anime and it look great. Character design was great in that. The anime however look horrible</br>  <br><br>They just went with the latest game's OP's artstyle. <br>Sorry that you hate it, but it looks great</br></br></br>  <br>So it's just like UBW?</br>  <br>ufotable shouldn't waste their time on godeater but do Witch on a Holy Night and Tsukihime next</br>  <br> Tsukihime <br> Implying they won't have them adapt the remake once it's out <br>You're gonna have to wait a long time<br>Also, Ufotable decides nothing. They are hired to adapt stuff (In GE's case, by Bandai Namco and in Fate and KnK's case, by Type Moon)<br>Why do you faggots act like studios decide what they adapt?</br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that we could have had this instead of the abomination that we are having now:<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2q<wbr>xxVPfDAHU</wbr>  [ ] <br><br> tfw no other GE OPs will ever be as good as the first one <br> tfw no more Over the cloud <br>ufotable have really let themselves go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Abomination <br>It looks great and unique. Sorry that you dislike anything different from standard animu art style</br></br>  <br> Different = Special and Good </br>  <br>In this case, yes<br>If you say otherwise, you have shit taste</br></br>  Hope there's a GE2 anime later  <br>I don't really care about the art, it looks OK in its own right. However, the direction and fights were utter shit, not something you would want from the first episode.</br>  <br>Newfags.<br><br>The same thing happened with Shaft before</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather have the game just come stateside already.</br>  reminder  <br><br>ufo have the lowest presence in the production committees for both GE and TM stuff. Meaning their investment is pretty much the time they spend doing these projects instead of other things. They may get a small % of BD sales, but most of their expenses get paid upfront just by doing the project.</br></br>  Why does everyone hate how this show looks? The story so far is pretty generic, but it looks really fucking good. Are people that pissed off at the 3DCG?  <br>Just done with it. It was pretty much 20 minutes of absolutely nothing but Ufotable trying to mimic CG rendering with actual 2D. Needless to say they managed to make the bland and insipid setting filled with bland and ininspired characters even more retarded. What exactly was the thought process that lead to this thing?<br><br>Nice tits though.</br></br></br>  <br> this episode had EIGHT freaking animation directors <br>This is funny considering that animation wise, pretty much nothing was remarkable.</br></br>  <br>First one was shit Burst and RB were better</br>  <br> but it looks great <br>You sure have shit taste or really bad standards.</br></br>  <br>Nah it's fine. It isn't clunky like I thought it would be from the screenshots, it's pretty smooth actually.<br><br>Will probably be my AotS</br></br></br>  <br>Because it looks like shit? Like seriously are you faggots blind?</br>  <br> AotS <br>HAHAHAHAHA<br>Even if you consider the shitty art acceptable, the story is shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Keep you autism in /v/ MHfag</br>  <br><br><br> typing out laughter on the internet <br><br>you were the special one in school weren't you?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because you hate CG right? It looks better than most anime nowadays, CG or not faggot.</br></br>  <br>Great counter there faggot.</br>  Worse than blade&amp;soul anime? Shit was terrible  <br> It looks better than most anime nowadays <br>There's people that think this is the case. How terrifying.</br></br>  <br>People have different taste I suppose, but let's just ignore the shitposters and enjoy the animation if you like it.</br>  <br> hating on CG done well except for some still frames outside of combat <br><br>GJ, you autistic cunt</br></br></br>  I think the way it looks helps it stand out differentiating itself from the crowd, without it I don't think I'd be very interested in it because a lot of it is very generic. <br><br>I did laugh at the smoking Dante guy though</br></br>  <br> I did laugh at the smoking Dante guy though </br>  <br> CG done <br>Are you talking about the monsters you retard? Cause those are awful.</br></br>  <br> I think the way it looks helps it stand out differentiating itself from the crowd <br><br>So making itself look like shit makes it special and unique so it's better?<br>Hilarious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still better than what they could have done with 2D. They caught the detailed designs from the game perfectly<br><br> Shit <br>That's where you're wrong<br>You're calling it shit because it's not the same generic art style most other shows use<br>And yes, it's hilarious that you think it's shit</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How can you say that after one episode? That's like Statler and Waldorf levels of criticism. Better than GATE's first episode and I don't see everyone calling that show terrible.</br></br>  <br> FW bombed <br><br>no it fucking didnt, it was the 3rd best selling hunting game<br><br>1st being mh itself then GE then FW</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really, is there any reason why you are defending this pile of shit? Are you a marketer?</br>  The visual is...let's say outstanding compare to other show but can't say that it's good. The pacing and directing is god awful though. The MC design is very shitty and really off compare to another character, I have to say that this faggot was such an eyesore for me.<br><br>The only good thing about this first episode is...well, nice boob.</br></br>  <br>How did you find out?</br>  Ufotable is a terrible studio. Just look at how generic and forgettable UBW looked despite its massive budget. Even KnK had boring animation.<br><br>As for God Eater, its terrible chuuni but I like terrible chuuni. If it tries too hard like Fate does, then it will be shit. If its more fun, it will be great.<br>I don't mind the artstyle, personally. I like different.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone told you that you have terrible taste and should consider killing yourself?</br>  <br>Hipsters do believe it.</br>  <br> I don't like UBW so I have shit taste <br>Reddit, plz.</br></br>  <br>Right maybe bombed wasn't the right word. It didn't do as well as they expected how about that. It was marketed as a Vita flagship before release by Sony themselves, initial sales was decent, but it went downhill from there and reviews was mostly negative, especially about the initial difficulty and post-story content.</br>  Why are people comparing GE to UBW?<br>Are some of you really that casual?</br>  <br>sorry i forgot that you're a blind mongrel<br>my bad</br></br>  <br>Seems like /a/ is full of those retards now.</br>  <br>Made by the same studio.</br>  <br>Some butthurt fags that wanted this to be better than UBW but its failing so hard.</br>  Budget Eater is the name of the show do you think they had money after unlimited budget works  <br>they patched it and now they're still gauging interest for the new one<br><br>they did make kouken male group too<br><br>its also one of the better "hunting" games core gameplay wise too, <br><br>I dont know why people compare it to MH when its more of a Lost planet clone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't know I had to quote your retarded self to make it clear but then again you are a retard.<br><br> its terrible chuuni but I like terrible chuuni. <br>You literally like to eat shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm defending it because it was good and I loved it. I'll defend stuff I love from rampant shitposting and hate. Sorry for liking what you dislike<br>Maybe when you grow up, you'll learn that people have different tastes, kid</br></br>  <br>It can be terrible chuuni but not be shit.<br>Kind of like all of Trigger's works or TTGL.</br></br>  <br>Some fags went to the UBW threads and posted how this was eating all the budget and how it was going to be better. So it got the attention of the UBW crowd.</br>  <br>Yes. Because money for UBW came from Type Moon<br>Money for God Eater comes from Bandai Namco</br></br>  <br>I am impressed that there's shit eaters like you.</br>  <br> Because money for UBW came from Type Moon <br>That's Jewplex,anon. Believe it or not but TM don't have that much money...to be honest they are quit poor.</br></br>  Its kind of sad of God Eater will be praised by casuals who think UBW is great and has the greatest animation and Ufotable is some god-tier studio while here its going to be shitposted to death by several parties.<br>Personally, I think its going to be "so bad, its good" tier.</br>  <br><br>That's like comparing Red Garden to Strike Witches (Gonzo) or Kanon to Haruhi (lol Kyoani) because they were both made by the same studio. That's caveman logic as they're two completely different shows.</br></br>  <br> Its kind of sad of God Eater will be praised by casuals who think UBW is great <br>Nah I am seeing the opposite. The faggots who hated UBW and the director are eating this shit.</br></br>  <br> That's caveman logic <br>What can you expect by the GE fans? They all come from /v/.</br></br>  <br>Just look at ping pong</br>  <br> I like what you dislike <br> thus, I'm a shit eater <br>Wow, you sure told me.<br><br>How is telling the truth being a casual<br>Ufotable have been great lately. <br>And UBW was great and had some great animation (excepting maybe a couple of episodes) <br>If you think anyone who doesn't share your opinion is a casual, you are a retard</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The faggots who hated UBW and the director are eating this shit. <br>Some people will like it just to spite Fate, yes. But my statement was more or less a guess since I don't browse any other site from here and can only guess at the casuals who post here.<br><br><br>You'd have a point if Ufotable made any notable anime aside from TM shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I had no strong feelings about UBW one way or the other. It was okay. God Eater's first episode isn't as good as UBW's but the premise is more interesting. Also the rest of the supporting cast looks more interesting as well. The character designs look more interesting, setting is more interesting, etc.</br></br>  <br>I like GE ever since I played Burst, and I've never been to /v/. Fuck off with your boogeyman</br>  <br>yeah japan, we have white haired ZR sluts all over russia, believe it!</br>  <br>ufotable doesn't have a clue as to how to direct nor how to write a story on their own.<br>hence, why God Eater is trash, and why UBW's direction was garbage.</br></br>  <br>It's a giant monster hunting game. Before MH giant monsters are exclusive to big boss fights in RPG, MH is the one that made that kind of fights into it's core game play. I never really played Freedom Wars so I can't judge, but based on the trailers most people seen it's a giant monster hunting game, so comparisons to MH is inevitable</br>  <br> And UBW was great <br>Its subjective, but I found no redeeming qualities in UBW, both anime and the visual novel.<br> great animation <br>High budget, but terribly lackluster. Its like they animated it, but that's it. They didn't try or had any talent behind the animation.</br></br></br></br>  <br> but the premise is more interesting. <br>No it isn't it's post apocalyptic world #9489748578457<br> Also the rest of the supporting cast looks more interesting as well. <br>Hurr durr bigger breasts = more interesting<br><br> The character designs look more interesting <br>They look stupid like all game designs.<br><br>Are you from /v/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Say what? I was hearing nothing but praise for this director before this shit aired what happened?</br>  <br> High budget, but terribly lackluster. Its like they animated it, but that's it. They didn't try or had any talent behind the animation <br>What kind of shitpost is that?<br>So it was good, but it wasn't? Because they didn't "try"? What? I don't understand</br></br></br>  <br>some part of /a/ really hates God Eater for some reason. Maybe it's the artstyle which some people love and some hated with a passion. Maybe it's the lack of waifu on the first episode (my money is on this).</br>  <br><br>No I'm an /a/sshole. Probably been here longer than you as well. However, I do post on /v/ occasionally and no one really praises God Eater there. I'm willing to bet all these people complaining about the direction and story haven't even played the game.</br></br>  boy, I am glad I didn't know the hype behind this, or the fact that it was some popular video game, because it seemed acceptable for me and enjoyed it  <br> the premise is more interesting </br>  <br>Shitposts happened. <br>GE was one of the most hyped shows of the season, so faggots have to shitpost about it. <br>Also, the screening cancelation, and posterior 1-week delay of the first episode's actual airing<br>Another reason for shitposts is that it looks different, and many retards think different=shit</br></br></br></br>  <br> for some reason <br>It's edgy kids who don't like things that are too popular hence they shat on Unlimited Blade Works and also God Eater since the same studio animated them.</br></br>  <br>Its as if you paid some god-tier artist to paint a simple picture and he drew it and didn't put his own style or spin on it. Its just your standard picture. Its nicely drawn but terribly boring. They didn't make it interesting to look at.</br>  <br>You're still a retard no matter what Yukko.</br>  <br> enjoying things <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br><br>You sure convinced me with your greentexting and that SAO image.</br></br>  <br>We'll see, I'm partially convince it's the lack of waifu though. When Alisa comes out for real people might be claiming her as the next top waifu.</br>  <br> not enjoying shit <br>It's like your IQ is in the three digits.</br></br>  <br>That means that Ushio to Tora is the best looking show this season.</br>  <br><br>I'll tell you exactly how this is going to go.<br>Once Alisa shows up more people will begin to accept this show. However, there's going to be some really obnoxious hate for her at first if they go by the game as I think they are. Once she gets her character development though everyone will start claiming her as waifu and suddenly the shitposters will be replaced by "I wanna cum inside Alisa."</br></br></br>  I enjoyed the game<br>But you guys should know better than to expect anything from a game-to-anime adaptation</br>  <br>I felt that the art syle made everything feel a bit too static. But I'll continue watching it happily because this Alisa girl is pretty hot.</br>  <br> implying you don't need to have reasonable intelligence to be able to appreciate things outside your comfort zone or aim to entertain in a variety of ways <br>Not saying God eater is good though, I didn't like it at all.</br></br>  <br>She makes my dick DIAMONDS<br><br>I don't really understand the hate this is getting.<br>MC wasn't nearly as edgy as he first appeared, the frame shifts and skips were artistically intriguing and the time lapse was nice too. The artstyle is pretty neat and something new and the music was fine. <br><br>Only complaints are the CG monsters, but they always suck, and the lack of any sort of creativity with dialogue or story. The only other anime I can think of off the top of my head is Chrome Shelled Regios and we all know how that went.

Some people, even when aware of their personality flaws, cannot let go of them ever.<br><br>Character development should be about making characters round. Showing that there's more to them than what meets the eye. They've got their good side and their bad side. They've got their virtues and flaws. They may preach one thing, but at times act opposite to what they talk. Etc...<br><br>Good and memorable characters always have flaws and keep them.<br>Hell, people talk about Lelouch a lot in these threads, but he had plenty of issues he never worked on and several times made the stupidest mistakes due to those flaws. And that was part of what made him a good and likeable character.<br><br>Character development shouldn't be there to turn a character into a moral-teaching, but to turn it into a person, and people are not perfect, and that's precisely what makes people interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I don't think just flying through the air really fast counts as teleportation at all.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/mal/</br>   (You)<br>Yes I take pictures there already have images, then I do not need to look for, or take picture of the anime is faster and practical.<br>MAL - which has the highest concentration of yurifag, moralfag and normalfag</br></br>  What was the key-sickness again?<br><br>I can only remember Clannaids.</br></br>  Charllot  I'm honestly surprised how much I'm enjoying this, thought it was gonna be pretty mediocre, but that first episode was great same for the second.  <br> doubting based Maeda <br><br>He is the most renowed VN writer for a reason</br></br></br>  <br>and fujoshits</br>  Charlotte is some kind of weird spirit girl which came from a comment.

The reason Yuu cheating his exam.<br><br>He's poor. Must support himself and his sister. So, probably via cheating and get a top grade, he could get scholarship for himself. This also probably the reason he respond strongly about his expulsion.<br><br>2. The "save the girl from the truck" incident<br><br>If we see it without cutting any scene, He improvised that plan on the spot. It seems the plan just occurred to him when he sees the truck driver and think that's a perfect chance. Hence he glad that he make it. It could be worse, of course. But that action was in the spur of the moment. Though we should still blame him for his reckless action.<br><br>3. Nao seems to fond of Yuu's little sister<br><br>Especially when Nao patting the little sister's head. This occured to me after watching episode 2. Probably she sees Yuu's little sister's situation resemble herself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He's poor. Must support himself and his sister. <br>Their living expenses are being paid by their "uncle".</br></br>  The blackmail, blatant abuse of powers, and other antics from the Student Council continue to give the series a light-hearted atmosphere,  <br> Key <br>No friend, you do not even l and Visual Key.<br>Yu uncle sends a certain amount of money, but if he had to study without a scholarship, the money would be shared between the college and food, and the money that Uncle sends the wrong to buy a decent meal.<br> Seriously you guys too lazy to read the Visual Key</br></br></br></br>    <br>Nice thumbnail.</br>  <br><br> has the ability to post any image instantly on /a/ just by thinking about it <br> they're all thumbnails </br></br></br>  <br>Well met my good sir, for I too, am an ant like you.</br>    Soo are there subs yet that don't translate his power as "teleportation"?  <br>But he said teleportation himself.</br>  <br>Maybe he can just see through one layer of cloth?</br>  <br>Please note that 瞬間移動 simply doesn't mean anything else than teleportation.<br><br>Considering Joujirou is a joke character, I'd say him calling his power 瞬間移動 is just a part of the joke. <br><br>And all this was of course already discussed before.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he?</br>  <br>No, he said 瞬間移動. It can refer to multiple things and teleportation is one of them.</br>  <br> It can refer to multiple things <br><br>No.<br>http://www.weblio.jp/content/瞬間移動<br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/瞬間移動</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just proved yourself wrong. The term itself translates to "instantaneous movement". How this is movement happens is not exactly defined.</br>  <br>Can Shirou trace photos?</br>  <br>It says Teleport and Teleportation right there.</br>  <br> le autismo </br>  <br> Google Translate <br>As always, the one arguing about the correctness of the subs the most are the ones that don't even know Japanese.<br><br>See <br> それに瞬間移動という呼称を用いる例はあまり多いとは言えず <br><br>So when it gets called 瞬間移動, there must be a reason. And it all being a simple joke is the obvious one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Basically she lost her virginity early due to her dead big sister's insatiable cocklust. <br><br>so just like Maya too</br></br></br>  <br>It's not the best part.

I don't know if I ever will. </br>  Didn't really join any homodachi threads for the last season.<br>What did you guys think about Yamada?</br>  <br>Rushed</br>  <br>4 years</br>  <br>Shitty adaptation and the hair colors gave me eyecancer. At least with the manga I can pretend that they have regular hair colors.</br>  <br>5 years</br>  Soon.  <br>Coming up on 4 years soon.</br>  <br>Who will voice them?<br>Do you think the guy who voices Haru in Free is suitable for Akaashi?</br></br>  <br>I'm sure her face when was all our faces when.</br>  muh dik  Do you like suprise homo?  <br>Tanuki is not brown enough.</br>  <br> twins <br>I'll listen if there are some stereo sound shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>I'm a little surprised they've only showed anime Yachi so far, but I guess there are a couple months to go.

I just looked at the "Iwatooshi X Tanuki" on the side.</br>  <br>Disgusting slut.</br>  <br>モブ = mob. It says mob x Tanuki, Iwatooshi.</br>  I finished the manga today and the end was great, it's a shame that the anime didn't adapt the last volumes. Masa and Yaichi's relationship was so much better here, I loved  when Yaichi finally opens up to Masa and begins to tell him about his past. and Masa giving up his samurai status to save Yaichi's life  . One of the best male friendship stories I've read.  <br>look harder</br>  <br>I for one enjoyed it. I haven't read the source material though.<br><br>Came for the homo, stayed for the  hetero .</br></br></br>  <br>7 years now.</br>  <br>Forgot pic.</br>  <br><br>Why is Mugen the mascot of these threads? oh god.</br></br>  <br>Whoops. I'm a retard. Thank you for helping me realize that this doujin does appeal to my interest.</br>  <br>I dropped the anime to read the manga. And now I'm almost dropping the manga as well.</br>  Swordboys anime when?<br><br>dem hands</br></br>  <br>As much as I'd like to see animated swords, there's just too much room for them to fuck it up.</br>  <br>Hopefully never. Kancolle was terrible enough.</br>  <br>The manga has always been not that good. Author needs a better editor, her writing is too hazy. But the male witches are good, their seventh witch is hilarious. And Kurosaki is best boy.</br>  <br><br>  no  </br></br>  <br>Soon, but it's going to piss you off as much as the Kancolle anime pissed the shipfags off.</br>  <br>How exactly do you determine the true length of time? It seems a stupid question, but I was a teenager when I first met my husbando, and the term hadn't come into use yet. There were a few characters I got attached to when I was younger, who dominated everything I produced and collected for short periods of time, but I have no such feelings for them now. My husbando is my husbando because he was the one I never lost interest in, who I'd always be happy to see and, I'll admit, wrote the most embarrassing things about compared to any other. It's just those years of stupidity that make it hard to decide when to say I truly tied myself to him. Or should I just think of it as when he first stole my heart?</br>  <br>I don't think I'll ever find one.  ;_; </br>  <br>2 years</br>  <br>I'll pick it up again once Kurosaki wins the Miyamurab owl. Which is to say never.</br>  <br>Ask the pharaohs who created the first homo threads.</br>  Anyone else watching this?  <br>The hell is that thing on the right?</br>  <br>How would you like your Swordboys anime?</br>  <br> That hint of asscrack on orange <br>Is teal dying in a pool of blood, though?</br></br>  <br>Cute swords doing cute things.</br>  <br>What made the Kancolle anime bad?</br>  <br>Turtlenecks are godtier. Why doesn't every character wear one?</br>  <br>That's something you'd have to ask the appropriate thread.</br>  <br>Focus on one main girl.</br>  <br> socks <br>Disgusting.</br></br>  <br>Chuuni and shota are the only ones who don't look like sluts.</br>  <br><br>Whats wrong with them looking like sluts anon? isn't what they are there for?</br></br>  <br>Cute swords doing cute things and going on adventures.<br> Male harem would be nice too. </br></br>  <br>I wanted more of Hibiki.</br>  <br><br>This is the only correct answer. Forced angst and seriousness would suck and there's no way the budget would be high enough for multiple good fight scenes.</br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>Prepare to be disappointed.</br></br>  <br>Sluts are always shit.</br>  <br>Sluts are made for loving. Except maybe binoculars. That one looks like a bio hazard.</br>  <br>QUALITY, too much focus on the main girl, butchering characters, a lot of things really.</br>  <br>I appreciate that in theory there's something for everyone. Even though they kinda missed the mark with those character designs.</br>  <br> &gt;he took it without a second thought <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>Why is hairclips in there twice?</br>  <br>Shhhhhhhhh.<br>Let me dream.</br></br>  <br> spoiler <br>I hope you're not implying you'd want them to make it an otome type adaptation or anything or the sort.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing he meant a male harem with a male harem lead. Like a BL game.</br>  <br> spoiler <br>Even if harems weren't awful, it'd be a harem around a female saniwa and therefore awful.</br></br>    <br>Two years.</br>  <br>What are those pillows with their heads called?

The twitter post was in moon so I didn't really get a proper understanding of what was going on with them. <br>I really hope they get a shot in the GSC online shop.</br></br>  <br> villain uses polite language <br>Bonus points awarded</br></br>  <br>I hope they don't have a different skin tone than the uniformed ones for the sake of faceplate swapping.<br><br>When does S2 start?</br></br></br>  Which sword would you polish?  <br>I noticed that too. I really, really hope that is a mistake.

Thanks for reminding me.</br>  <br>Yes. Mappa delivered.</br>  <br>I know, I wanted him to take it in the ass too.</br>  <br> It's good to know that not all of the Pedal statues will be completely shit looking.</br>  <br>It's really tragic that Union Creative picked up Pedal.</br>  <br>In that particular image anon.</br>  <br>At least while he was young and needed the money, right? That can't be too much to ask for.</br>  <br>And in general.</br>  <br> At least we have GSC to make sure the tragedy doesn't repeat with other series.</br>  <br><br>oh anon</br></br>  <br>He mentions that he has okama clients, maybe they fucked him</br>  Why doesn't this guy just write BL already or just come out as being a shotacon/likes to draw delicious male bodies?<br><br>It's sad that his works get axed and then he has to draw other generic shit, his newer original work seems like it might be fun.<br><br> tf can't read moon so don't know what the hell this is on his blog. </br></br></br></br>  <br>that delicious thigh</br>  <br>I want to stick my hand between those thighs.</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>How old was Sugane when Jou saved him?</br>  <br>I think it was 10 years ago.</br>  <br> Sugane was 10 <br> Jou was 20 <br>Jou is pretty thirsty for Sugane.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know if I'm reading this right but it looks like he made some BL that's going to be in ゆうやけ Vol:1, which will be sold next month at Comitia.</br>  Anybody reason anything good lately on sad panda? Here's a new one for all those chubby chasing shotacons out there.<br>http://exhentai.org/g/831949/4d7137<wbr>cfc5/</wbr></br>  <br>3 years<br><br>The best.<br><br>I'd say after you confess/propose to your husbando, for that's the time you actually get down to it and tie yourself to another. The teenager years would be the "crush" period, where you had a few, but only your special one made it further into your heart.<br><br> anniversary <br>I wanted to ask if you have a set date, since I'm not even sure of which month we got together, it just happened and I didn't write down the day.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> all those chubby chasing shotacons <br>b-but I thought I was alone...</br></br>  <br>For a place that constantly shits on yaoi/homolust in their Chinese cartoons, I'm also surprised to find that homo threads are a staple that is around for years and doesn't get much shitposting</br>  <br>I'll never own it, just like these Brothers booklets. Nips are so lucky in a sense.</br>  <br>Anons are too pure so they need sluts to teach them how to hold hands properly. Also with sluts anon shouldn't be afraid to get too rough since they love it and sluts are experienced enough to make anon cum baskets. Sluts are the best.</br>  <br>But you can get those on Booth, and it's cheap as fuck. <br>Now I feel kinda bad for him since they're huge but barely cost anything. Popular artists would charge well over 1000 yen for 80 pages. <br>Truly doing it out of love.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Gay Rugby being cancelled is still one of the gravest travesties in manga in the last 10 years.<br><br>I understand the eternal butthurt of Mx0fags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody's alone, anon.</br>  <br><br>D: All of the above.</br></br>  <br>Even if I wanted them I have no money for them.<br><br>Booth? You mean that thing on pixiv? It's digital only right? I'm seeing it now, it's really cheap. <br>I'd get it to support him even if physical is superior.<br><br>His drawings are perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Booth is for both, but these are physical.</br>  <br> those goddamn thighs </br>  <br> Bokuto not involved or even peeking through the window </br>  <br><br><br> I'm glad that there are so many anons who appreciate a good pair of gams.</br></br></br>  <br>he is touching himself in the shower meanwhile</br>  <br>He's holding the camera.</br>    <br><br>Fair enough</br></br>  <br>Source? I can't read the moonrunes on Google.</br>   bodyswap showing the guy's lewd inner faces alongside his outer reactions <br><br>Welp, now I've got a new fetish.</br></br>  <br>Again with the shit images anon.</br>  <br>Does that happen often in this manga?</br>  <br>Whoa</br>  <br>Didn't notice that.<br>Here's the other one <br> armpits oji-san </br></br></br>  <br><br>Salaryman, shota and brown are the only good ones.</br></br>  <br>Why does his face look 10x lewder than the girls?</br>  <br>Because boy sex faces are a novelty</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  I think I'm starting to love the artstyle, it's kind of fresh and Eren 2.0 is sexy as hell  <br>Kota seems like he wants it in the boypussy from MC.</br>  <br>The artstyle is nice. Too bad the writing is crap.</br>  <br>I don't know what this is.</br>  <br>God Eater.</br>  <br>Oh, the jacket is a giveaway then. I forgot that was airing.</br>  <br>Wish they won't switch Kota's outfit to his hipster wear so soon, the trainee uniform kind of suits him better.</br>  <br>mayonaka no giten</br>  <br>I reckon if he had used this artstyle on Gay Rugby it would have lasted longer.</br>   Servamp anime adaptation announced <br>Hoping it won't be Funi simulcast.</br>  <br>Which studio?</br>  <br>Good to know.</br>  Nagisa a semen demon.  <br>Karma a best</br>   think this is going to become just another romcom show <br> instead I get a show about tough businessman which is my fetish </br>  <br> *Karma a shit <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>In the future every show is a funi simulcast.</br>  <br>Usually I think long hair a shit, but I really hope Nagisa won't cut his.</br>  <br>no its not you dumb landshit</br>  <br> landshit <br>And trying to make the insult more insulting backfired on you and destroyed its original meaning.</br></br>  <br>He will when he graduates. All good things must come to an end.</br>  <br>Might as well kill myself before it happens. Too bad that actual sub groups most likely won't be subbing it.</br>  <br>You could always try learning moon, anon. At least give it a shot before you an hero.</br>  <br>I might just buy this. Is there any reason I should feel bad supporting mediocre English pseudo-anime homo VNs?</br>  <br>The CGs are hot, that's all that matters.<br>The scenes themselves are painfully short though, blackmonkey should learn a thing or two from k-drive.</br></br>  Ass of the season  <br>Is it worth watching it for the boys?</br>  <br>If you like the teacher and the boy in suit's designs, yes. Story was rather amusing too.</br>  <br>This bitch doesn't count as a boy. I was severely disappointed. Couldn't his voice actress at least made an attempt to sound less like a squirrel?</br>  <br>No, it's shit</br>  <br>I'll be giving it at least 3 episodes.</br>  <br>Not even a boy. Literally<br> draw a girl <br> call it a boy </br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm watching it because I really like the setting so far but the cast is also nice. It bothers me a bit that a CEO candidate is like 16 years old but I guess I'll get used to it. It's corporation drama now but I have no idea whether it will have actual podraces later or what the teacher is going to do to prove himself.</br>  <br><br>They're just faithful to the books' spirit. Original Kobayashi was a young boy so beautiful he was able to imitate women in the cases and he could be count as the original shotacon icon. He also acted pretty much like a girl because he was an idealized boy character.</br></br>  <br>Too bad most of the public raws which available on Nyaa are actually worse than CR and Funi video.</br>   The only full homo show is ignored <br>Where is the Junjou Romantica hype?</br>  <br> Hype <br> Nakamurashit </br></br>  <br>I'm forcing myself to watch it for nostalgia, if you could even call it that. <br> barely no animation at all <br> storyboard literally copied straight from the manga <br> character designs as ugly as always <br> these guys have lived together for 3 years as lovers and they still can't have sex normal way without some weird rape roleplay <br> also the boyfriend still has some weird problems, actually tells MC he doesn't need friends because they might want to fuck him, and MC is totally okay with this <br> the same plotlines recycled from the past, MC meets some nice guy who wants to fuck him and the boyfriend gets jealous, meanwhile boyfriend has some business partner who this time is his cousin but he wants to fuck him and hates MC for that <br><br>The only thing that keeps me watching is that the Egoist couple is in the OP and I don't remember that being so bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is the manga any good=does it plenty of pretty boys?</br>  <br> Egoist <br>From what I remember reading the manga years ago before I dropped it, they were good for about 2 chapters before the standard nakamura forced drama set in.</br></br>  Is Yamamoto Kotetsuko a hack? Almost all of her manga featured or are featuring a love rival plot line right now.  <br>I enjoyed her first few series, but at this point she's just recycling plots and characters almost verbatim. It's pretty bad.</br>   oyaji bearded dudes will never become popular <br><br>why life</br></br>  <br>Oh man those  two  whores and their vaginabones.</br>  <br>Use  and  to decide for yourself, it has almost all the relevant characters here.</br>  <br><br>Fuck off. The only Nakamura welcome here is Asumiko.</br></br>  <br> tfw less than a year since it was official </br>  <br> like the trunk of an elephant </br>  <br>The show is pretty cool through. The FeMC isn't a coma patient for once.</br>  <br><br>Please this.</br></br>  <br>Sad how the most homo show of the season is a shit and that the subject of the homo affection doesn't look remotely like a boy.</br>  <br> tfw I haven't finished Gatchaman because of that annoying girl with the shrill voice <br>Is it worth it to watch for Sugane and Joe?</br></br>  <br>I'm not a huge fan of Joe or Sugane but its still worth watching for Ruri.</br>  <br>He is so sexual.</br>  <br><br>I'm only watching this show for megane-kun blushing like a slut every time the trap talks to him.</br></br>  Had this been linked in the thread already?<br><br/></br>  <br>It only has pretty boys. It's like a Zero Sum manga, except without all the shitty drama and even more pandering.</br>  <br>6 years.</br>  Would you?  <br>No. All swords are ugly as shit.</br>  <br> calls other boys ugly <br> posts a HQ <br>Is this some sort of meta joke</br></br></br>  <br>All guys in that game look overdesigned and weird as fuck. What's wrong with your taste?</br>  <br>Rushed adaption anons have been looking forword to for years. Nice to see animated homo kisses. Good seiyuu cast though.</br>  <br><br>Wow this isn't japanese? This is literally the first time i've seen good "anime-style" art from outside the country.</br></br>  <br><br>Based Monkey</br></br>  <br>Tan Jiu isn't so bad either.</br>  <br>China is in Japan.</br>  <br>It's been hours but I just wanted to say I love Saraiya Goyou. After watching the anime, I  bought  all the volumes. That lady knows very well how to portray human relations.</br>  Delicious, delicious collarbones. Episode 2 really had a shitton of fanservice.  <br>2,5 years.</br>  <br>Hasn't the homothread always wanted this?</br>  <br>The boys look a little bland, but still miles ahead of the Free! chin monsters</br>  <br>TR has a big variety of boys and artists. Also, looks aren't everything where there are voices and personalities. You're full of shit or you are shit if you say you can't like a single sword.</br>  <br>Source where? It's a fake.</br>  <br>I've been tricked.</br>  It's time.    <br>I didn't give a fuck about the shitty adaptation because I got to see Yamada animated and it made my love for him even more real</br>  <br>Is that supposed to be an example or a reaction?</br>  <br>I like it, the hair has volume.<br><br><br>Blazed. The facial structure looks a bit fucked in the right bottom pic.</br></br></br></br>  So am I the only one in love with Kiyoshi?  <br>Kiyoshi best prison.</br>   I'm The Protagonist Of A Harem Manga But I'm Gay So My Life Sucks <br>IT'S GLORIOUS</br>  <br> he has an actual male crush <br>Based<br>I can tell the oneshot is going to end in rage though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>that ugly style<br>it's shit.</br></br></br>  <br>It was wonderful. I hope it continues more than a one shot. It made fun of all the harem troupes in a few pages.</br>  <br>Did some group finally pick it up or did you read the raws?</br>  <br>He is pretty cute.</br>  Boy of the season.    <br>Wrong</br>  <br>It's in the thread crosslinked back up this thread</br>  <br>Can't wait for them to animate the cellphone rice photo.</br>  <br>Never seen The Ravages of Time?</br>  <br>You fucking bet I would, who is this anyway?</br>  <br>I'm gonna marry him</br>  <br>I like Teru better, and i'm not even a shotacon. I want him to be my king.</br>  <br>Lurk more then.</br>  <br>  shitting Maki </br>  <br> Tsunderes are ineffective against gay people </br>  <br>The nipples ruined the whole thing</br>  <br>Because secretly /a/ loves that shit.</br>  <br>I know I'm a slut so I'll never have a husbando. I'd never be able to stay faithful to a guy for more than two years, tops.</br>  <br>My fellow slut, how goes the trawl, who are your eyes fixed upon, who catches your gaze?</br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>  <br>That doesnt look like shota.</br>  Its nice to see a show balancing yuri undertones with homo undertones.  <br>I heard this show is shit. How bad is it?</br>  <br>Delicious.</br>  <br>It could be significantly worse. Its nothing special and its fairly generic but I wouldn't say its bad. Almost everything about it is average.</br>  <br>How are the boys, then? Do they make the series worthwhile?</br>  How many times do you think he got raped during his brief stay in jail?  <br>It's eighty bucks. Pirate that shit.</br>  <br>Some people don't like it because it ended up being a show about business and capitalism instead romcom</br>  <br>Jail isn't same as prison<br>Rape doesn't happen in jail</br></br>  <br>It happens, just not nearly as often.</br>  What are you homo anons hoping to see at WonFes?  Will this animated Drama CD subbed in English?  <br>SB69 stuff and Native Aoba. Also obligatory Clear nendo and Noiz scale.</br>  <br>Migoto said they might do it. Hope they do.</br>  <br>Haruka is a waifu and she's mine only.</br>  <br>Show My Cock boys would be nice, yeah. R figma from the previous Wonfes revealed wouldn't hurt.</br>  Will you watch the sextuplets anime?  <br>The cast kinda bothers me when they're supposed to be in elementary school</br>  <br><br>If it get subbed.</br></br>  <br> SB69 <br><br> Show My Cock <br>I'm hoping too, anons.

I certainly wouldn't complain.</br>  <br>For the seiyuu.</br>  <br>I thought that was the basis of that Dokonjo Gaeru live-action series.</br>  <br> Also, is the manga still getting translated? <br>Probably not without a miracle.</br></br>  With legs like these, who needs boobs?  <br>Nice try, Kumiko.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wKs<wbr>waXC1FwU</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Someone needs to cosplay this pose.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  legs &gt; eyes &gt; butt &gt; boobs  <br>butt&gt;legs&gt;boobs&gt;eyes</br>   Sapphire smiled innocently.

Kumiko is nothing special there.  <br>Why have only one feature, when you can have all of them...</br>  With this goddess around, what's the point of other characters?    <br>please let's make threads every 2, 3 days</br>  feet  I'm still upset at how KyoAni shafted Hazuki.  <br>Obligatory.</br>  <br><br>She wasnt a man character in the first place</br></br>  <br> in the OP <br> sings the ED <br> listed as a main character in the novel and anime websites <br> not a main character </br></br></br></br>  <br>midriff=armpits&gt;legs=tits&gt;ass&gt;shit&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;feet</wbr></br>  Nao remembered the defeat yurifag and /u/  Not this warning to yurifag and /u/ in 2016 we will have '' Hibiki Love Story ''  <br>I agree wit this. I'll make a thread tomorrow..</br>  <br>Absolutely right. She was a woman character.</br>  <br>hold your autism anon</br>  <br><br>Midori had it worse she barely had any screentime compared to Hazuki. It's Kyoani baiting people thinking it would be similar to keion.</br></br>  Kumiko loves hot dogs as much as Shuichi, if you know what I mean.  <br><br>I don't understand this meme.<br><br> deliberate intentional yuri fanservice <br> HAHAHA /u/ BTFO <br><br>That's literally like saying "HAHA STRAIGHT MALES BTFO" whenever there's a pantsu flash.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Still the best.  <br>You could have been by my side for this Aoi.</br>  <br>Does Kumiko shave her legs?</br>  <br><br>Aoi x Haruka would have been great.</br></br>  Those bloody legs.  <br>this</br>  Any chance of an OVA or two?<br><br>Or else Asuka gets it.</br></br>  <br>One OVA, coming out on December 16.</br>  <br><br>What happened to her smile, /a/?</br></br>  <br>Wait, what? Where is this from? I don't remember this scene.</br>  <br><br>Ep 2 flashback.</br></br>  <br>Sweet, any details?</br>  <br>No, but there's speculation it's going to be a beach episode based on some promo art.</br>  <br>Sweet, I can roll with that.</br>    Just finished this and now I'm sad.<br><br>Anyone have the archived thread closest to when the last episode aired?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much all threads had "Hibike! Euphonium" in the subject line, except the ones made by a retard who named them "Hibikek". There were like 15 threads a week, so go read them and have fun.</br>  <br>Charlotte, stop hijacking the thread!<br>Oh wait, her name isn't Charlotte.<br><br><br>I can imagine Kumiko going commando in that pose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember the thread immediately after the live stream went by the misspelled title of "Hibike! Epuhonium",</br>  <br>I can imagine Kumiko saying, please cum inside the UFO!!! Just before climaxing.</br>  <br>Fag please stop degrading the thread</br>  <br>Wouldn't sand get in their instruments?</br>  Mamoru Hosoda's Bakemono no Ko made more than 600 million yen in its first weekend.<br>Hosoda is bigger than Ghibli at this point.</br>  <br>The family drama is incredibly corny but quiet enjoyable, the evil AI using facebook to take over the world plot is irritating. Guess which one takes up the bulk of the movie.<br>Also suffers from "If these characters took a second to explain anything to each other the main conflicts would be fairly easy to resolve" syndrome.</br></br>  So how good is the movie anyway?<br><br>Can Hosoda write a young male protagonist who isn't an unlikable shit yet?</br></br>  <br>As if any of this guys works is as popular as something like SAO or Naruto worldwide. <br>No idea why people have such strong opinions for something like this.</br></br>  Contrarianism general?  <br> Also suffers from "If these characters took a second to explain anything to each other the main conflicts would be fairly easy to resolve" syndrome. <br>Humans are complicated. I know it's hard to grasp for NEET hikis around here so just trust someone who is forced to deal with loads of people on daily basis.</br></br>  What's going to happen to her /a/?<br>Why is she being made out to be the underdog?<br>Why did the anime skip over and downplay every scene that indicated 8man likes her?<br>How will she fix her self esteem issues?<br>What were 8man's intentions when he asked her out?</br></br></br></br>  Yukino best girl  <br>Just the best</br>  <br>So in the end it resort to she doesn't need to do anything at all. She truly useless just like in anime.</br>  <br>Keep hating</br>  <br>At least she knows how to construct proper sentences.</br>  Way to undo Vegeta's character development.  <br>I'm sure someone out there is working on a dubstep soundtrack that will suit your tastes better</br>  So this is the best DB song, right?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZJi<wbr>Rm8NvpJA</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>How to spot amerifats<br> link them the best original DBZ soundtrack <br> they will call it shitty because they are used to Faulconer shit that sounds like random phone rings playing at the same time </br></br></br>  <br> Making Goku young again? <br>I think I read somewhere that Toriyama really enjoyed that idea and wished he would've thought of it before</br></br>  <br> The Prince of All Jobbers </br>  Chapter 13 of the first GuP Anthology. <br>GuP proving again that EVERY garupan is best girl.</br>  <br>starts with an analysis of the movie trailer (no new info I think though)</br>  <br>the real live locations that showed up</br>  <br>all the standies that are scattered trough the town</br>  <br>almost all of the standies are tied to a store, which tend to sell a number of sometimes exclusive merchandise.<br><br> Pravda vodka <br>now that's a new one</br></br></br></br>  <br>some more merchandise.
