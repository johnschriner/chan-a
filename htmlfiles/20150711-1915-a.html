[ Expectations for chapter 36<br> Boring SoL </br>  <br>Why? Because he screwed up against the clowns?</br>  <br>IMAO</br>  Will Takeomi fill that Yoriko's womb with his quality semen? <br><br><br>He is getting the desk job just like Seidou? fucking Ishida.</br></br></br>  <br>he is going to burn the ccg down to the ground. just you wait and see</br>  <br>He's suffered to long. I wouldn't blame him.</br>   Watch anime where character on the show eats/drinks a certain thing <br> start eating/drinking that same thing on a regular basis  <br><br>Does anybody else do this? Pic related, ever since Gangsta started airing I've been drinking Perrier at work on a daily basis.</br></br></br>  <br>I just buy cheap carbonated water in bulk from Aldi and down 1.5L bottles on a daily basis.</br>  <br> carb on carb <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>did you try going to a conbini?</br>  <br>I went to them regularly, but always to buy other shit. I checked for yakisoba-pan in a few, but I have no idea how I didn't see it anywhere.</br>  I bought Rum Raisin once.<br><br>I didn't like it.</br></br>  Why do I get the feeling that she's just as batshit insane as blue snow?  <br>wut<br><br>is this a VN or some shit</br></br></br>  <br> curing a man's despair with more of the poison that destroyed him </br>  <br>Now i'm confused lol Then ayame is pure right?</br>  <br>I don't want to sound like that guy but that's just gay. I can tolerate girls being stronger than guys when it's played for laughs, but this is just a no-no.<br>I mean this makes Shinji Ikari look manly.</br></br>  <br>I don't understand what the hell is happening on this page. How is she able to throw him to the floor and tie him up so easily it is portrayed as instant? He's an athletic guy.</br>  Would you shave her anon?<br><br>Also, god bless Lerche for the best adaptation this season.</br></br>  <br>Wrong, Lala clearly has some influence to keep him alive since he has received critical injuries in the past that even will power wouldn't be able to save yourself from. <br><br>Also if she was just there to collect his soul (where you don't need to be in proximity too, as seen from the fact that Lala was no where near Darling with all his near death experiences in that issue.) Why did she show up looking exacerbated at the hot spring after Darling was put on ice by the Yuki? <br><br>It ain't all Darling saving himself, but he helps.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>they are so pleb tier even normies are starting to like them</br>  <br> Suuigi? <br><br>Good enough for me!</br></br></br>  <br><br>If Suu didn't have the mental-capacity of a child, she'd be a candidate for "best".<br><br>But as of now, she is merely good.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And what are you? A black knight? <br>Ya caught me. <br><br>Hopefully Lala gets the next arch after worst girl. Don't want you want to see Dullahan land?</br></br></br></br>  Arc can defeat anyone in the Fate series, prove me wrong  oh wait you can't   Couldn't beat Issei.  <br> power level scales accordingly to enemy <br><br>pretty much<br><br>arc can kill servants</br></br></br></br></br>  What do you dudes think of Watamote?  <br>London in be please</br>  <br><br>how can a show be cute? <br><br>Tomoko is cute, yeah, but the show? I'd hardly say that's possible</br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Watamote is mai waifu</br>  <br><br>Grandpa, go back to sleep, we're not fishing so there's no need to pull out that kinda bait</br></br>  anime is pretty cringe by itself, but this made it look 10 time worse  What did you think?<br><br>Also we get it sourcefags, nothing could ever compare to the quality of your glorious literature.</br></br>   tried reading the LN <br> expect some edgy lich goig muh evil <br> gets a lonely paranoid man trapped in a lich's body that constantly do his best to make sure his former buddies that he misses alot's creations is safe unharm <br><br>Everytime i see Papa Bones reminscing about the old days, it breaks my heart.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Beatoriichee</br></br>  <br>He was already a thousand-year-old, undead creature in his heart before the series even started.</br>  <br>If the other anon already stated it then why do you feel the need to chime in</br>  <br>Why do Japanese men even want to become salary men?<br>Is that why unemployment is so high right now, Young men realize it isn't worth it?</br></br>    <br>Mii-kun disagrees.</br>  <br>Thats the point, the SoL (delusions) was there to be mundane as possible to indicate the quaint, normal and peaceful lives that they will never get back.<br><br>Their SoL facade is literally the only thing keeping them sane. <br><br>When they leave the school, their sanity levels are far less stable when they were at school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thats what a lot people are saying and what the original impression was. Chasing the dog served no purpose other than to show us the school through Yuki's eyes but the thing is we have the potential to see that throughout the course of the show and also its really not all the important in the grand scheme of things.</br>  How far into the plot do you think the anime will get to <br><br>Graduation? They already speed things up with mi kin already being part of the gang</br></br>  <br>Normally I'd agree but the thing is none of them are mentally stable or in normal circumstances. Yuki is delusional, Miki has a history of quickly sinking into depression, Yuuri is suicidal and starting to hallucinate, and Kurumi is half dead. The chances of something bad happening with the gun before a conflict with another group are fair and the chances of something happening after and great considering the additional possibility of a causality or despair.</br>   /ai/ - Idle Activities  as an expression of the human mind reflects the active will, the contemplative reason, and the desire for aesthetic perfection. Its basic elements are logic and intuition, analysis and construction, generality and individuality.  <br>You've never Nep a NepNep?</br>  <br>Never have. Never will.</br>  <br>You're losing out on pure concentrated happiness  except that one route that goes full PR. </br>  i'm happy that ichigo doesn't disappear right away but what about aoi?  <br>Fondly remembered, Sumire's Catch phrase is "As Aoi-sempai would say 'Odayaka Ja Nai.'"</br>  what is it about Haruhi that gives her that raw sex appeal?      Not gonna lie, I was glad when Kyon called her out on her shit and almost smacked a bitch.<br><br>She really did need a dose of reality, because she can tend to treat people like her personal playthings</br></br>    <br>Honestly that was one of my favorite parts of the whole series. Just really fucking cool to see 3 dimensions with the characters.</br>  Episode 2 ETA 9 hours.<br><br>Leaked OP:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7hk<wbr>MDd3v-8s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>    <br>Charlotte really really likes a certain rock band so that might just be it, but it might be a plot point later.</br>  <br>Yeah, I think the theme for Kanon should be "past" or something.</br>   Yumi turns out to have a power <br> It's the power to resurrect herself <br> That truck wouldn't have really killed her </br></br>  <br>It's a post-rock band.</br>  NEXT G COMING SOON  <br>I'm not saying Code Geass isn't mecha show, but mecha aspect doesn't have much focus. Isn't the manga actually completely non-mecha and they replaced the robots with sword fights? Because with that setting it's easy to do that.</br>  <br><br>CGI would be fine if they had the right studio in charge of it. Probably won't happen since GUNDAMU fans are afraid of change</br></br>  <br>Studio orange is busy with Fafner and that harem anime adaptation for Fall.<br><br>And the intern studio is probably busy with Origin.</br></br></br>  <br>There was already CG robots in Unicorn, granted OVA/movie is different case</br>  <br> Wanting more CGI mecha <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  ITT: Series that made you reevaluate your life's direction  <br> sarcastic <br>You suck at this.</br></br>    <br> rage comic <br>hah sick sarcasm bro<br> tripfag <br>oh, maybe not</br></br></br></br>  <br>Boku no pico</br>  <br>Singapoor, yes!</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>She will be drawn edition.<br><br>Previous thread &gt;</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not.<br><br>What exactly is that chibi thing on the third image? And how do I add something like that to my phone?</br></br></br>  <br>Glad you like it mimibro~ <br>I don't mind at all so don't feel bad! <br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>We should be friends.</br>  <br> 3DPD <br>Why would you feel compelled to post that here?</br></br>  <br>It's okay, there's a couple of us, I don't really mind if other people request, though.</br>  How could anyone have been surprised when Gon acted like an hypocrite? He's been that way since the exam arc, when he didn't have a problem with using someone else's death at his advantage (and was actually hoping for it) but only if it wasn't one of his friends.<br>Even Zepile noticed that he doesn't give a shit about right or wrong as long as it doesn't concern or benefit him directly.</br>  After spending these last couple weeks watching every episode of the 2011 anime, I still don't get why they kept the OP the same for the entire thing. I rarely skip them even when watching many episodes in a row, but I couldn't manage it after the first arc was over, especially considering the shifts in tone that it doesn't match.<br><br>On the other had, I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it.</br></br>  Was there a reason why Gon never interacted with the King?  <br>I think it was a bit more complicated than rage and hate. He really didn't know what to feel, and was experiencing conflicting emotions. Ultimately he came up with the decision that both him and Pitou were at fault for what happened to Kite.<br>The words he said to Pitou before his last blow didn't really seem hateful or angry. I really can't tell what he was feeling.</br></br>  <br>God, I love this page. It really feels like his hand is sticking out of the page and pointing right at you.</br>  <br> I didn't think much of Hyouri Ittai at first, but ended up loving it <br><br>Same here. Especially the second version used in the Chairman Election arc. This shot with them in the suits was cool.</br></br></br></blockquote>]
