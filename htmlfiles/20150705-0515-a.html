[   <br>This is yoshinari we're talking about http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=<wbr>3234048</wbr></br>  Did they had a sexual intercourse?  <br>No. Tanikaze is loyal to his tentacle waifu.</br>  <br>For 3 days.</br>  I just watched the directors cut of episode 12 to prep for insight. Are there really no decent BD releases of the first season? It's been a while already.  What a fucking way to start the first episode off with, holy shit  K2 did nothing wrong!  H O L Y S H I T  <br>my brain isn't working, what happened?</br>  <br>They just blew up part of a mountain.</br>  Rin is the cutest!  <br>You can be innocent and still have a massive gargantuan willy.<br>Yuya and the other Yuclones definitely have the biggest shlongs out of the MC's.</br></br>  <br> those biceps <br>Jesus Christ.</br></br>  <br>That's not Serena, that's a man,</br>    <br>You best not be talking shit about a Ruri.</br>  best girl confessed  Charlotte hype thread? Charlotte hype thread.  <br>Damn why does Glasslip seem so better to me in retrospect than it actually was during when it was airing?</br>  <br>It's too bad the content was worthless and they seemed to overuse the dramatic stills. It's like a girl who's only cute so long as she shuts up.</br>  The MC feels like Lelouch's and Kanye's love-child.<br><br>I like him.</br></br>  <br>it was quite decent Sol, but as drama and apparent mystic fiction it just went nowhere - though yuri and incest subplots were decent. Maybe given one more cour it could have ended main plot too - or maybe author simply did not know what he wanted to write in first place.</br>  <br>It would look better, if not for all those fucking stills.</br>   [Commie] Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX - 01 [A9903EC2].mkv <br><br>It's finally time</br></br>  <br>So it's still gay as fuck. Got it</br>  <br>Definitely sounds less like "I RIDE HER EVERY NIGHT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN"</br>  <br>No it's still gay.</br>  <br> forcing innuendo on a banter scene </br>  Hibiki please  Who is the most dense character ever seen in an anime/manga?  <br>no she doesn't</br>  <br>True, but he gets redemption at the end, pity I don't think they'll ever animate it.. dem light novels and manga though</br>  <br>yep</br>  <br>But he's a pro teaching noobs now, didn't you see his battle against Shota?</br>  <br>Kampher MC</br>  You're always super special.  <br>But he's still part of the Anti-Committee, even if he doesn't have OP powers. He'd help out by gathering intel and forming plans of counteraction, same as Daru and Kurisu.</br>  <br>But he isn't some kind of super hero, he is just a creepy perverted Otaku who faps to Seira and can't even protect his own sister.<br><br>What can he even do?</br></br></br>    <br>Pretty much the same as Daru then. But Daru is considered the most useful member of the Anti.</br>  <br>What a shit anime this was</br>  Why are reverse traps so pure?  <br> 23â–¶ <br> &gt;draw a girl call it a boy <br>why is this allowed</br></br></br>  <br>Subscribed</br>  <br>In reality though he's just a fucking weedy asian boy who grew out his hair and cross-dresses in public.</br>  <br>I want to watch this for the trap, but that first episode was so fuckin dumb.</br>  <br>3D is always impure.</br>  So, the new BBCPEX having a Remix Heart story mode thing made me remember this thing actually existed. It is any good? Did Mai ever get his body back, or did they at least fix his taste buds?<br><br>If they didn't at least do that, they said the only thing he could eat before was Noel's cooking, and because of her doing everything in the games and not being able to tend to Mai, good to say Mai's a dead person.</br></br>  What are the odds that some time hole or something will happen or some other BS that can excuse making some of the XBlaze cast playable?  <br> masturbation is much less frequent among women than men </br>  <br>What I found interesting is that while men are more likely to masturbate if they aren't having sex, women are less likely to do so.</br>  Has Mori say rather or not the next BB game will still be sprites or go the Xrd route?  <br>He has said that the next game will have over 30 characters. And it's coming out next year. No way they're changing the engine.</br>  New cutre tomboys adventures chapter is out  <br>What will her life be like once they do start doing each other?</br>  My hearto  <br>the single friends that take care of their children</br>  <br><br>She likes playing games with people.
