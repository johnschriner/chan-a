Let's see if we make it there.<br><br>Info:<br>  EVOL vs. Genesis OVA will air on tv before LOGOS' first episode, stay tuned <br>  LOGOS first episode will be a 1 hour special just like EVOL's <br>  May'n is singing the OP song Yamaidare Darlin' <br>  Aquarion Shush is a thing and is real <br><br>Character and world info below.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    AKIRA KAIBUKI (aka retarded haircut) <br>The MC.

He has a stubborn personality, and is quite bold in his manner of speaking. However, he gets nervous when talking in front of lot of people, and can't address himself correctly.

In a relationship (???)<br><br> TSUTOMU DOMON (the meme man) <br>A guy aspiring to be a comedian. He has a slightly gloomy atmosphere. He's sort of a manufacturer/maker (mechanic?).

He doesn't worry about following traditions, and is always after the "New Laugh".<br><br>  KARAN UMIGAMI <br>A child actress.

All other languages spheres are watching over their fate.<br><br>NESTA<br>A big IT company with great influence over the languages spheres. Its philosophy is based on the control of the information of the letter each human possesses. While it provides a variety of internet services, in the recent years they have been trying to gain control over the heavy industry and genetic research, while also trying to expand their business. Their headquarters are located on the Nishishinshuku NESTA Tower.<br><br>Asagaya<br>The place where many writing masters of the Voice of Genesis used to live.

In reality, it is the Voice of Genesis Element's training institution of the japanese branch of DEAVA. Here, they train a variety of talented ones in both voice and character.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder that <br> OSORE LIVING YOUR LIFE DON'T GIVE UP NOW KEEP MOVING ON  <br>is gone</br></br></br>  <br>the friendzoned bishonen</br>  <br>that image is edited, her hair is not actually green.<br>Oh, that's Maia.</br></br>  EVOL remastered BD box pictures<br>1/4</br>  <br> SUBETE KENZAKI <br> I will riot for him, probably. Fuck that ugly mc. He will fucking lose tho </br></br>  <br>2/4</br>    <br>4/4<br>2ch comment on the 30 min. drama CD:<br> Kagura is forced to crossdress, much to the disgust of the female cast.<br><br>Zessica cosplays as a flight attendant, her uniform has underboobs.<br><br>2ch said the whole thing was gross.</br></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  And new Jin/Yunoha figures.  <br>I liked this girl because she didn't wear underpants.<br>Too bad she was in a shit anime.</br></br>  <br>Hold up the OVA is actually airing on TV? I heard the public wouldn't see it until LOGOS's first DVDs/Blu Rays come out.<br><br><br>What are the chances DEAVA is still a school and our protagonists are going to be forced to attend?<br><br><br>Don't worry. If the OP is shit you can always edit OSORE LIVING YOUR LIFE DON'T GIVE UP NOW KEEP MOVING ON to play over it when subs come out.<br><br>What are the chances of gg come back to save us?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus fuck kill yourself</br>  <br> They reduce the original meaning of the words, distorting them until they're destroyed <br><br>I see, someone was actually reading medaka Box</br></br></br>  <br>That sounds awful, so it's exactly what I'd expect from this show.</br>  <br>I expect a top tier OP and insert song from LOGOS, continuing the trend from the previous two shows.<br><br>Of course, along with a convoluted plot line, dropped characters and plot points, a rage-inducing romance, and more allegories like doughnuts.</br></br></br>  This is how many 12,000 years after EVOL?  <br>No clue. How would you react if this turned out to be set between Sousei and EVOL as a plot twist?</br>  <br>Maybe? They kinda tied everything up in Evol though. This could take place in an alternate continuity altogether.</br>  <br>I wouldn't like it. I don't really like exploring past events.<br><br>I'd much rather  than this be a direct sequel to EVOL though.</br></br></br>  <br>So what you're saying is there's no Pierre.<br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>   OVA before the premiere. <br>Oh boy, I can't wait for dog mechs and EVEN MORE SCREAMING EACH OTHER'S NAMES.</br>  <br>Pierre best Aquarion</br>  <br><br><br>It's probably an alternate universe since that seems to be Kawamori's latest fetish.</br></br></br>  <br> between Sousei and EVOL as a plot twist? <br> people were complaining that Amata wasn't fighting fate <br> Zessica route was literally the non-fate related route <br> LOGOS makes it so that Pollon reincarnated into bad hair MC before Amata <br> notZessica is Zessica's past life <br> LOGOS ends with MC and notZessica promising to meet each other again  <br><br>Isn't it fantastic? You can still make it all about Zessica and still make her lose.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a girl from nesta. Nesta works in genetic research. They made a Zessica clone to fight for them.<br><br>That or she's little girl Toma.</br></br></br>  <br>That sounds absolutely fucking stupid.  Fund it. </br>  <br>I'd say no considering reincarnation cycles seem to take 12k years in this series, but established facts never stopped them from changing whatever they damn well please before.</br>  <br>What if Maia is Pollon?<br>He also had silver and red hair.<br><br>MC can be Reika.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Shushu mech <br>Good, good.</br></br>  <br>But shush is a cat. What's with the rabbit?</br>  <br>What are the chances of notZessica winning the aqualion?</br>  <br>This is literally the only reason I'm watching this.</br>  <br>  that seems to be Kawamori's latest fetish <br>?<br><br>What did he do like that recently? DYRL was one, but that was ages ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's already being paired up with the MC in the merchandise, alongside Apollo and Silvia and Mikono and Amata.<br><br><br>The Fool is also into alternate universes. The EVOL vs. Genesis ova is also alternate universes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Let's hope this shit actually gets subbed in a timely manner. Any word on simulcasts?</br>  So EVOL OVA will air today?  <br> I expect a top tier OP <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=R9a<wbr>c12AYpDo</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>What do you mean by remastered? Did they actually add more stuff/touch ups to EVOL?</br>    <br> SHIROBACO </br>  <br> those suits <br> dat exposed armpit </br></br>  <br><br>Was Kawamori a fan?</br></br>  Who's subbing this? Which group are you gonna go with?  <br>hopefully gg will pick this up.</br>  <br><br> gg <br><br> ;__;7 RIP in peace </br></br></br></br>  <br>Indeed</br>  Won't it be a special episode? Cause "OVA" and "TV broadcast" aren't compatible from what I learned ages ago.  <br>Mal/ann classifies it as Special</br>      <br> Simulcast: FUNimation <br>No other group has said they are doing this and Funi hasn't said when the simulcast is going to start either.</br></br>  <br> Shirobaco cafe <br>Is this a double reference?</br></br>  <br>Copy/pasting from /m/<br><br>So apparantly the OVA was shown in some theatre or something because someone's leaking info.<br><br>Supposedly.<br><br>Dog Aquarion is actually Solar, not Evol.<br><br>Amata is basically fired as MC and Kagura takes over as Evol's pilot.<br><br>Frog Aquarion. Yes based on Yunoha's frog with Jin's soul in the doll. Supposedly it was so dumb nobody in the theatre could stop laughing for it's entire appearance.<br><br>Not Jin and Yunoha are from Showa era Japan, but get pulled into Evol's time because of time fuckery thanks to some artifact book or something. That's also why Apollo and co are there.<br><br>Mikono finally gets the be the head for once.<br><br>So it's pretty much just dumb silliness and JinxYunoha feels, along with one final desperate attempt to make Mikono liked (it didn't work). Amata they apparantly gave up on completely, as he's barely in the thing supposedly.<br><br>But supposedly it doesn't make Evol any worse than it already was. If anything it's a throwback to the first half of nonsense before the srs set in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Will it finally be Zessica's year?  <br>what rabbit? it's clearly a cat</br>  <br>Every year is Zessica's year. Someone forgot to tell the showrunners, though.</br>  <br>The character deigns for this show looks awful. What the hell happened?<br><br>Crea better be in it.</br></br></br>    <br>Fat.</br>  <br> SHIROBACO <br> An anime cafe <br><br>gg</br></br></br></br>  <br> childhood friend <br>Yeah fuck you too, I'm not watching this.</br></br>  Stream where?  <br>I guess it will air on MBS. Is any channel streaming it?</br>  <br>usual place, summer</br>  <br> Koda will never come into your thread and start shit posting because you were complaining about how fucking late the Jormungand subs were </br>  <br>If I were actually summer, I wouldn't be aware of the fact that /a/ likes to livestream shit.</br>  Starting in 1 hour. Episode 1 airing is 30 minutes earlier than regular schedule because it's 1-hour special.  <br>I can already tell cowtits is going to be worst girl.</br>  <br>She's the Mikono equivalent. Worst girl is a given.</br>  WHERE ARE THE FUCKING SUBS AT?  Is the OVA actually happening? No one streams that shit  <br>No, it's on MX.</br>  <br>It was shown at an event and will be included on Logos BD vol.1</br>  Stream where?  2 mins<br><br>get in here faggots</br></br>  What's the stream nowadays?

Wait is it gonna be OVA and then 1 hour special?  <br>Aww yes.</br>  DOG VS DOG NIGGAS  BAHAHA WHAT.   Gepard form still useless   I honestly never gave two shits about the Yunoha/the-fucks-his-name's romantic subplot.  MIKONOSAAAAAAAAAN  Based Fudo what the fuck did he say  It's time.    <br>Eh.</br>  <br><br>you can't have 2 Fudous appearing at the same time</br></br>    OSORE  Fuck I missed most of speial  Apollo and Kagura punching each other is the only good thing about this special.  <br> samefag.jpg </br>  OSORE    MIKONO SAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN    ITS OSORE TIME  OSOREEEEEE  <br> EVOL is Love backwards </br>  Feels good frog, I mean cat    KIMOCHIIIIIIIIIIII  Well, that just got real silly real fast.  wat  <br>I didn't notice it until the end of EVOL and then in  Wixoss  I didn't notice that  LRIG is GIRL backwards  either.</br>    KAERU SO DEEP  ICHI WAN NEN TO NI SEN NEN MAI   Getting on this ride again. <br>Why are you doing this to yourselves?</br>  TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS COME TO AN END ONCE AGAIN  T W E L V E T H O U S A N D<br>W<br>E<br>L<br>V<br>E<br><br>T<br>H<br>O<br>U<br>S<br>A<br>N<br>D</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because it can't be worse than Evol.</br>  <br><br>It's not even started and I want out already.</br></br>  <br>The thread is dead bro, nobody else gives a shit.</br>  <br>The ride could be fun.</br>  <br>Apollo ist still the better dog than those faggots Kagura and Amata.</br>  Old wounds were opened.    <br><br>Shit.</br></br>  <br> it can't be worse <br>It can always be worse.</br></br>    <br>Apollo being a bro</br>  Logos starting.  GOD FUCK ME WHY WON'T IT JUST DIE<br><br>WHEN WILL THIS RIDE EVER END</br></br>  <br>6 months from now.</br>  <br>That's what they said about Fuuka and KNIM, and look how that turned out.</br>  Is that some Kotomine up in this shit?  <br> implying this is the last Aquarion </br>  Real rides about to begin.  <br>I thought it was one cour?</br>  Remember the Great NTR Weekend Spectacular? Where three shows ended on friday, saturday, and sunday, each with NTR?  <br>27 episodes,, actually.</br>  may'n a shit  <br>I only got on recently and I didn't think Evol was as bad as peopole say.</br>  OP is average as fuck  <br>May'N is great, but this is underwhelming from Kanno.</br>  <br>WOO!</br>  <br>Can we expect this one to end /u/ way?<br><br><br>You know one of them is gonna be a filthy recap montage.<br><br><br>I can't even remember EVOL OPs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think EVOL's a lot better when you know what you're getting into, what to expect with the second half.</br>  God fuck this OP is so shit.  <br> I only heard about it from /co/ side at the time </br>  DON'T BELIEVE HIS COOKIES  missed the op. was it good or bad?  <br>Actually 26 + 1 OVA (which was streamed earlier)</br>  <br>Come to think Korra is worse than Evol</br>  Why are the characters so ugly.   MC got penishair    idolshit <br> jew noses <br><br>This is going to be a long 6 months.</br></br></br>  Not a fan of the art style and designs.  MC looks like a total faggot.  ARE YOU READY?  <br>shit</br>  Bland girl is first girl.  Top tier reflexes  Mad skills    Is it just me, or is notMikono basically Hajime as designed by Xebec?  Has another 12,000 years passed already?  <br> nipples </br>    New MC is THUG AS FUCK<br><br>Confirmed for being  Zessica </br></br>  <br>I don't mind the art style outside the character designs, which I expect I'll get used to eventually.</br>  YOROKOBE  <br> the Mai-Hime movie won't even be out in 12000 years </br>  h-how's the robot? is it good?  W-We'll get an Akino insert song, right?  Right? ;_;     <br>This would be amazing if this show was about zessica winning after 12000 years.</br>  Messiah?    <br>JUST</br>  shirobaco s2 confirmed  <br>Gee Bill, how come Mom lets you have TWO imoutos?</br>  Jesus christ what is this.  <br>Implying it's not.</br>  <br>I want a PA Works mecha animu</br>  new zessica  <br>As soon as I'm convinced that I can't spin it that way in my head somehow, I'm dropping it.</br>  Timestop  <br>You know that can't happen  ;_; </br>  This new stream site is giving me cancer the quality is so bad why did cc die.  omae ha mou  <br>Yeah, I'm basically watching some pixels move around with dialogue I don't understand.</br>  Is the MC autistic?  These new vectors look so bad    <br>THAT ASS</br>  Even though EVOL was horrible and disappointing I really loved the character design. Why did they take a new designer?    <br>So your tastes is just shit</br>  Them new character designs don't look that bad in motion.<br><br>MC still looks like a blazing faggot though.<br><br>What's up with the new vectors too. They look like a toy from the 80's. And I'm not talking about the cool ones either.</br></br></br></br>  her ride got NTR'd    <br><br>Just chuuni.</br></br>  <br>I'm willing to bet that guy on the left is going to be the prime SUFFERING character of this series.</br>  <br>Eh, not him, but a lot of shit is way more tolerable if you go in expecting something awful.</br>  <br>He's Zessica's childhood friend and is in love with her. He's the loser, the new Zessica.</br>    I miss AKINO  <br>He's getting NTR'd by the Yusei ripoff</br>   No orgasm music when they gattai'd for the first time. <br><br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br><br>Glorious.  The twist is that he was Zessica's reincarnation all along. </br></br>  Wait, are you guys all watching the OVA?<br><br>There's no fansubs of it as far as I can see.</br></br>    Aquarion using only two vectors? Complete blasphemy<br><br>dropped</br></br>  <br><br>Aired 20 mins ago.</br></br>    What's with the kanji letters?  Is it this shit for anyone else?  <br>IT'S SHAPED LIKE A HEART<br>OH WOW<br>SUCH AMAZING SYMBOLISM<br>BRAVO AQUA LION</br></br></br></br>    <br>Yes.</br>  But why scrolls?   forcing a girl for gattai with you <br><br>LEWD</br></br>  Fudou is the new villain?  <br>Please let Zessica be the MC. I don't want her to suffer anymore</br>  <br>http://anidb.net/perl-bin/animedb.p<wbr>l?show=anime&amp;aid=11151<br>This one, right?<br><br>I hope they release the BD or something.</br></br></br></wbr></br>    <br> new <br>But he has always been the villain.</br></br>  Well, that was fucking underwhelming.  Fucking NTR    <br> I hope they release the BD or something. <br>It's included on Logos BD Vol.1.</br></br>  <br>Only the op<br>the rest was as always<br>mc a fag though</br></br></br>  <br>Unless someone picked up on something in moon, we still don't know where this is in relation to Evol, right?</br>  It looked like shit compared to EVOL's 1 episode.  <br>Is logos being handled by people who haven't touched anything aqualion? Because the OP is beyond bad. Doesn't even have to be Akino, May'n has a powerful voice too but they're making her sing meme pop instead.</br>  <br>Just like The Fool</br>  <br>The enemies are buzzwords?</br>  What's up with Japan and gary stu protags recently?  <br>See<br><br><br>Aquarion was, and is always stupid, but they sure know how to time Music for maximum hype.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh fuck I still haven't watched the first 2 seasons. Better get started on that.</br>  <br> Is logos being handled by people who haven't touched anything aqualion? <br>It has the same staff as The Fool</br></br>  <br> The Fool <br>DROPPED EVERY EPISODE</br></br>  <br>The song was Kanno, I think. Which is disappointing as fuck.</br>  The music was one of the best parts of Aquarion. Where the fuck are the catchy tunes     Shit OVA <br> Shit new series <br><br>Glad I didn't pick this shit up</br></br></br>  Wait, I thought this was an hour-long deal, but now they're redoing the OVA?  Hold up why is Neetball streaming the OVA again when we were supposed to get the first two episodes of LOGOS today?  <br>Forgive me Zessica bros. I was blind all this time, I was blinded by Mikono Zettai Ryouiki and I never realised Zessica's Butt was this hefty.<br><br>I've made.... A terrible mistake.</br></br></br>    Wait. Was the OVA the crossover between the two Aquarions?<br><br>So when is the one where they extend EVOL's finale?</br></br>  Those mouths though.  <br>One hour special meant the OVA and first episode of LOGOS.<br>Also now neetball is reairing HQ version</br></br>  <br>It's in the BD Box</br>  <br>That's just an extended final episode, not an OVA.</br>    <br>It was a crossover between the two Aquarions and the alternate universe of Japanese Jin and Yunoha.<br><br>Extend finale in in the BD box.</br></br></br>  What did the extended final episode add?  <br> when we were supposed to get the first two episodes of LOGOS today? <br>Uh...no? The OVA and teh first episode of LOGOS were part of the premiere which is why LOGOS has 27 episodes because they included the OVA in teh broadcast order.</br></br>  <br> Mikono crying alone <br>I like where this is headed.</br></br>  <br><br>I see. I was mislead then because I heard we were getting the first two episodes just like we did for EVOL. Guess it's time to play the waiting game for subs then.</br></br>    <br><br>Only good thing about this whole premiere thing.</br></br>  I actually kind of enjoyed most of the first episode, except for not using an insert song for the first gattai. That was a weird decision.  now we wait for subs.  <br>That fucking shit taste</br>  I know they used Go Tight as an insert song in EVOL. I wonder if they'll use OSORE and Paradoxical Zoo as insert songs as well despite that fact that the latter had lyrics specifically tailored for the characters in EVOL.  <br>Who was that blonde to the left of zessica</br>  <br>Stop asking fucking stupid questions. Buy the BD Box and find out yourself if you care so much.</br>  Musical timing and direction is the only thing Aquarion does right and this time around, they couldn't even do it right.<br><br>I'll give it till the second or third episode but the show ain't hitting it with me.</br></br>  <br>I want to touch Fluffy's hair.</br>  <br>Is there any group subbing this aside Funi which still haven't said when the simulcast is going to start?</br>  <br><br>Side character. I think she was the same character who was part of that side character love triangle drama that was happening in the sidelines when EVOL aired.</br></br>   that episode <br>They'd have been better off playing the ichimannen chorus the entire time, because at least that would have kept me awake.</br>  <br><br>How is that a stupid question, also<br><br> buying <br><br>Where do you thing you are?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Several days until Funi rips. Even more for a decent fansub. Enjoy your Funi summer.</br>  <br>gg</br>  <br>Is it as boring as the PV implied?</br>    <br><br> GG <br><br>Oh well, better than waiting 5 days.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The character design can be shit, but those tits are so perfectly drawn, that brought my dick to question his own existence.</br></br>    <br>Is it [K]?</br>    <br>Me in the red shirt.</br>  Does anyone else think that Satelight may be stretching themselves too thin this summer? They've got no less than three series being broadcast at once right now - the last 4 episodes of Yuuki-chan, Aquarion, and Symphogear.<br><br>I really hope we don't have to suffer from QUALITY because of this.</br></br>  I was kinda expecting Fudo to appear, I'm disappointed.  <br>Nobody cares. We're just waiting for Macross Delta</br>  <br>Satelight goes hand in hand with QUALITY no matter what.</br>  <br>Why is everyone calling her Zesica, when its obviously Yunoha?</br>  <br> We </br>  Which on is Zessica in this generation?<br><br>And which one was Zessica in the first Aqua lion generation?<br><br>My boner requires this info of me</br></br></br></br>  <br>No one cares about Yuki-chan anymore, Symphogear was always QUALITY and shit, this is not genuine Aquarion so no one gives a fuck either.</br>  <br>Yunoha would never be that shitty outside of the OVA so no.</br>  <br>Funny you mentioned that because Gohands used to be under Satelight before they went independent.</br>  <br> Has a savior complex. He threw himself into the whole conflict without regards for danger. </br>  Who's the Andy equivalent in this series?  <br>Aquarion MC is more like a megalomaniac.</br>  Aquarion is nothing but NTR and shipper drama.    Remember, Amata ended up being the reincarnation of a dog.<br><br>Ergo, NotZessica will actually be Myx's reincarnation or something</br></br>  <br>They did alright with three shows while EVOL was airing (Symphogear and Mouretsu Pirates for the first half, AKB0048 and Pirates for the second).</br>  <br/>  <br>I think you've spent too much time reading Evol threads and not enough time watching the show.</br>  <br>New character designs are shit</br>  OP<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=iPW<wbr>ALAa9ZhM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Symphogear <br>The show that had massive QUALITY issues?</br></br>   People are still making EVOL comparisons     I just arrived, what did I miss? How was the crossover special? Did it had anything worth watching? What did Zessica do?  <br>Wasn't a lot of that early on, and mostly due to Studio Encourage?<br><br>I only ever watched S1 on BD, I don't know much about the TV airing besides QUALITY walk.</br></br></br>  <br>Kimi no Shinwa and Sousei no Aquarion were way better. They actually had beats that were memorable<br><br>This OP is just generic shit</br></br></br>  <br>Its actually Yoko Kanno song, but is imho disappointing.</br>  <br>Please tell me there is hype as fuck music accompanying this.</br>  <br>The crossover was shit, Apollo had some great moments, though. Zessica was pretty much irrelevant.</br>    <br> Wasn't a lot of that early on, and mostly due to Studio Encourage? <br>There was QUALITY when Satelight took over</br></br>  At some point MC and pocky dude will duking out over notZesssica. <br><br>Male childhood friend of heroine against MC, now that something you don't see everyday.</br></br>  <br>Depends on how much you liked Yunoha/Jin, I guess.<br><br>It was honestly more boring than anything, at least until Frog Aquarion when it just got really silly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's just like my American RomComs!</br>  Was the ED any good? Gekkou symphonia was awesome  <br> Frog Aquarion </br>  <br>She's fat</br>  <br>This is gold.</br>  <br>If it weren't so fast, it'd be much better.</br>  <br>Pocky guy will become evil. Look at the final group shot in the opening, he isn't there. He isn't part of the main group. I bet he will be the Mitsu of this show.</br>  <br><br>I don't give a shit about Yunoha/Jin.<br>But was it at least fun? I ain't having more MIKONO-SAN or Fudo bullshit.</br></br></br>  Shipping wars when?<br><br>I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS</br></br>  <br> I ain't having more MIKONO-SAN <br>Too bad.<br><br> Fudo bullshit <br>Yes, but from the good Fudo.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it wasn't.<br>  I ain't having more MIKONO-SAN or Fudo bullshit. <br>HAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHAAHAHAHAHA</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>None, they already let you know Zessica wins this time.<br>Anyone rooting for notMikono and pocky dude is delusional.</br></br>  Only now do I realize that Zessica made Evol fun.<br><br>The plot for this show is so obvious I can't get hyped.<br><br>MC ends up with NotZessica, Neo-Mikono san and Childhood friend kun gets friend-zoned.<br><br>Knowing this series, NotZessica is Mikono's reincarnation, and NeoMikono is Zessica's.<br><br>This is why we can't have nice things</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shipperfag please.</br>  <br> Knowing this series, NotZessica is Mikono's reincarnation, and NeoMikono is Zessica's. <br>I'd be pleased if this is true just to see /a/ and /m/ cry again</br></br>  <br> Knowing this series, NotZessica is Mikono's reincarnation, and NeoMikono is Zessica's. <br>NOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...<wbr>.<br><br><br>Notto this shittu again</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  You retards do realize that if couples are content in their present lives they won't reincarnate right? Which is why we never got reincarnations of Pedro, Li, the two dorks and the twins. Amata and Mikono won't reincarnate and neitehr will Yunoha and Jin or the other couples in EVOL  <br>Isn't Amata a reincarnation of Apollo?</br>  <br>He's right, though. Promotional merchandise is pairing up NotZessica and MC alongside Amata and Mikono and Apollo and Silvia, the previous' shows official couples. She's winning this time and they're letting people know from the beginning.<br><br><br>Not like they gave a shit about reincarnation rules before.</br></br></br></br>  <br>As well as Kagura but EVOL revealed that Apollo regretted saving the world at the end of Genesis and he told Silvia to meet up with him in 12,000 years anyways.</br>  <br>He was. Anon is just talking about shit they have no clue about.</br>  <br><br>Well, damn.</br></br>  <br> She's winning this time and they're letting people know from the beginning. <br>So what?</br></br>  <br> Not like they gave a shit about reincarnation rules before. <br>This is true.<br><br> Reincarnations don't act like the person they were in the previous lives...yet Apollo is a dog because he acts like one </br></br></br></br>  <br> I'd be pleased if this is true just to see /a/ and /m/ cry again <br>In order for that to happen you have to actually make those boards care about Aquarion again.</br></br>  <br><br>You're forgetting this show will retcon anything it's convenient at the moment.<br><br>I mean, as far as I know Celiane had clearly no interest in Pollon, yet we're supposed to think they are the most perfect couple in the world just because their reincarnations basically got pushed into liking each other.<br><br>And Yunoha should have moved on from Jin's death but they have clearly dropped that development in order to milk them as a pairing.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If she's winning, she's not Zessica's reincarnation.</br>  <br>DEM BIG BANGS</br>  I expect none of the things I liked about the original, and all of the things I liked about EVOL. I am prepared.  <br>Neo-Mikono and Chilhood friend kun have singers as their voice actors.</br>  <br>Wouldn't surprise me if Kawamori pulled it off.</br>  <br>In Aquarion is always obvious the main couple. The other ones rooting for the other ending are delusional.</br>  Will Zessica win the Aqua Lion this time?  <br>You'll still be disappointed.</br>  <br>You tell me</br>  <br> happy <br>But she looks so dead inside... Why the fuck Amata such a faggot?</br></br>  <br>Maybe they'll pull another Kagura/Zessica and pair them up at the last minute to convince everyone pocky dude and fat mikono are happy together and not totally dead inside.</br>  <br>It ain't his fault Kawamori got shit taste in waifus.</br>  I just want the silly to come back.<br>Fucking stripping, god damn babies, banana onsen bullshit, fujoshit powers, and a whole load of other hilarious shit.</br>  Bark bark bark  Zessica was too pure hearted and naive. She did not know about the vile tactics Mikono had put in place to awaken Amata's Oedipus complex.<br><br>She never stood a chance.</br></br>  <br>It's the director from the fool, which was a snoozefest. Don't expect exciting things to happen like in the first half of evol.</br>  <br>Don't forget the original was silly as shit too.<br><br>Fudo, goddamn exploding lesbian beams, etc</br></br></br>  <br>But is it INTENTIONALLY silly and dumb or do fans just assume things? I remember the original series and everything was played straight based on Funimation's translations.</br>  <br> It's the director from the fool, which was a snoozefest. <br>Hilarious because that was easily the best anime of the decade, I'll take a hundred The Fools over a single Kill la Kill</br></br>  This girl kinda looks like White Zessica with long hair.  <br>Is she an android?</br>  <br>Aquarion without silliness isn't Aquarion.</br>  <br>And this is from another scene, probably the same girl.</br>  I don't like this new design, I want the Oreimo character designs back ;_;  <br> INTENTIONALLY <br>Yes, it's intentionally silly.</br></br>  <br>Genesis was, especially the OVAs</br>  <br><br>Who is she?</br></br>  The best parts of EVOL was the high school comedy drama episodes.  <br> meant to say wasn't <br><br>Didn't detect any silly from that</br></br></br>  OP 1080p: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wcssr</wbr>  <br> Hilarious because that was easily the best anime of the decade, </br>  <br><br>She doesn't look like anyone from the previous series.</br></br>  <br> Kill la Kill as the comparison <br>Fuck off.<br><br><br>  I remember the original series and everything was played straight <br>Anon, the original series had an entire episode with no purpose except gattai-as-sex innuendo.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fool <br> best anime of the decade <br><br>Those some are some fine ass lures anon because I took the bait hook, line and sinker.</br></br></br></br>      <br>  Zessca climbs to Amata <br>  Amata gets a boner <br>  Mikono: MO, AMATA-KUN! <br>  Mikono leaves to fap to Kagura <br>  Amata has to apologize later <br>  Zessica gets jelly <br>  Rinse and repeat </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anon, the original series had an entire episode with no purpose except gattai-as-sex innuendo. <br>And?<br><br>That wasn't bait</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone post the drawfag fanart with long haired zessica</br>  <br>And that is clearly intentionally silly.</br>  <br> That wasn't bait <br>So, just your shit taste? Alright.</br></br>  <br> No AKINO <br><br>it's shit. SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII<wbr>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> Andy saddigs a hole to bananamilk China while Suomi distracts us with her ponytail. </br>  <br>The Fool was awesome though<br><br>Didn't seem like it</br></br></br>  <br>Why the hell couldn't just turn the whole thing into a high school comedy.<br><br>the shit plot with the angels and doomed universe is just lame potato.</br></br></br>  MIKONO-SAN<br>MIKONO-SAN<br>MIKONO-SAN<br>MIKONO-SAN<br><br>Repeat for 25 episodes while Mikono rides Kagura's dick.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What would be worse then?<br>NotZessica winning the MCbowl, which means Mikono wins again, or NeoMikono winning, which means another bland as fuck moeblob will win again?</br></br>  <br>It's Zessica's fault she didn't dress more modestly, like a real mommy milf.</br>  <br>That megane blowing random shit up with orgasms whenever she got excited was something beyond silly.</br>  Now that we know he's the dog's reincarnation instead of Apollonius', why should I care?  <br>But muh SRW.</br>  <br>I for one hope the Homo angel got bored of all the drama and all the losing, and now he just schemes behind the scene to create entertaining drama high school.<br><br>In fact he should be the new principal of the school.</br></br></br>  <br>Why can't NotZessica actually be Zessica all along?</br>  <br>Nah, that's not going to happen.<br>That would mean Mikono-likes won't win the dogbowl.</br></br>  <br>NTR'd for 12000 years...</br>  <br>The whole thing with angels and the doomed world was irrelevant all along because everything was reduced to the main couple fucking.<br><br>Really, no one in evol gave a shit about the altair-vega war or what the fuck was the whole genderbend thing and most of the world was left unexplored. None of the characters gave a shit about anything but their little love drama. They should just have made the whole thing into a SoL romcom and save the robots for a better show.</br></br></br>  <br>Now that he knows Apollonius isn't coming back, I'm curious what's actually even driving the new series.</br>  <br> They should just have made the whole thing into a SoL romcom <br>But... but we'd lose Darrrrk Zessica ;_;</br></br>  <br>But he's inside Fudo now so unless the exteded version of EVOL's ending changes that or they retcon it he's irrelevant now.</br>  <br><br>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMG<br><br>I just realised they look exactly alike.<br><br>Everybody prepare yourselves for Homo angel.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Aquarion was stupid. The silly kind of stupid and that was great. Unfortunately, they went too stupid by the end of it. The wrong kind of stupid.  <br>Why don't I see one mention of best girl?</br>  ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>wcwq8</wbr>  <br>She's irrelevant in the special. Thankfully.</br>  <br>Well there goes the hype I had...<br> At least they didn't do some bullshit kagura pairing though </br></br>  Wait until the gimmick fights, that is the only reason I watch Aquarion.  <br>That's why you should be thankful, that's the only reason any of them would be relevant.</br>  This man is your friend. He fights for nationals.  I wonder how many students fell in love with him after the concert.  <br> wearing a tux <br> not even bothering to fix your sloppy bedhead <br>0/10 would not go to the ball with</br></br></br>  novelanon, how do the final pairings look at the end of the novels? I'm guessing Kumiko x Shuichi the only confirmed? Is anything else implied?  The anime ended.<br>Stop making more thread.<br>Fuck off.</br></br>  Kumiko has two right hands.  kyoani please make a new season for vol 2-3 and a movie for vol 4  <br>She's just got it bent awkwardly</br>  <br>is a 12 episode season enough for volume 3 and 4?</br>  <br>On a scale from mad to mad how mad are you?</br>  <br>he's so fucking gorgeous he'll kill me</br>  <br>If it's just bent awkwardly her thumb would be on the side facing the camera.</br>  <br>Her hand is the one on the right<br><br>Can tell because she and Reina have different skintones</br></br></br>  <br>Did you really think your post would matter?

They are like the fucking animals rioting after a football game.<br>Nobody cares. I liked both.</br></br>  novelfags, please tell me that mizore is at least liked by her sectionmates<br><br>the fagotts can't just circlejerk the whole time, right? they've got to take care of their cute kouhai, right?</br></br>  Why'd they make her look like a villain?  <br>his fit is terrible as well and too lazy to even get a conductor baton.</br>  <br><br>lol</br></br>  <br>They zoomed in on the hands to indicate its Kumiko's and Reina's. Enough already.</br>  <br> KyoAni <br> Draw <br>You have no idea what you are talking about.</br></br></br>  <br>Batons are for the weak.</br>  <br>Shes actually the main character</br>  so everyone else acknowledges their love already?  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wKs<wbr>waXC1FwU</wbr>  [ ]  <br>She's not the villain she second main character. out of all the characters. Asuka was on the cover 3 times with Kumiko.</br>  <br>Enlighten me, expert.</br>      <br>What he means is that Kyoani just films live video and then uses filters to make it look like anime.</br>  <br>I'm starting to think this is a running joke from them.</br>   *74位/*77位 (**4,670 pt) [*,*89予約] 15/07/15 血界戦線　第2巻 (初回生産限定版) [Blu-ray] <br> *99位/*98位 (**2,673 pt) [*,*43予約] 15/12/16 響け!ユーフォニアム 7 [Blu-ray] <br><br>REKT</br></br></br>    <br>No.<br>Bathe in your ignorance.</br></br>  <br>They didn't. She just looks like a very depressed, cynical person.</br>  <br> No fun allowed <br><br>fuck off</br></br></br>  <br>yeah a one cour season is enough.<br><br>a movie for vol 4 with pulp fiction style directing would be fucking awesome tho.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't blame her being cynical her life sucks.</br>  <br>I want to protect that smile.</br>  Why is KyoAni so fucking incompetent?  <br>Behold those who insult Taki-sensei.</br>  <br>The movie should be about Asuka and nationals. Second novel needs a whole season.</br>  <br>That's what they get for baiting yuri. Second seson should only feature Reina's crush. Stoic girls who turn moe when they're around their man sell like hotcakes</br>  <br>lust lazy</br>  Pick your first and second section choices.  God damn KyoAni really does suck at hands. A1 pictures can do better than them.  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Where is best girl?</br>  <br>There is literally no reason to pick anything other than Eupho and double reeds.</br>  Second novel actually has an even more yuribait Though not just with Kumiko Reina. The second year quartet is apparently gay.    <br>The fuck happened to peace-chan's eyebrows. She used to have smaller ones.</br>  <br>Buchou and fagotts in that order.</br>  I don't understand /a/'s obsession with KyoAni and this show.<br>In Japan, it wasn't even one of the top 5 anime of the season. Not even Japanese otakus care about this show.<br><br>It's like you faggot only watch KyoAni's anime and nothing else.<br>Seriously, there are millions of better shows out there but you faggots never talked about them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Crappy mspaint job, but you get the idea<br><br>Pretty easy to tell because Reina's skin is whiter</br></br></br>  <br>I like Asuka.</br>  <br>At 2ch there's not a more popular anime than Hibike</br>  <br>Still doesn't make any fucking sense.<br>Look at Reina's hand. Her thumb should be facing the screen in that position.</br></br>  <br>＞why didn't you talk about other shows in your hibike threads</br>  <br> hibike vol. 7 in the top 100 <br> only kekkai vol. 2 in the top 100 <br> kek </br></br></br>  <br> Not even Japanese otakus care about this show. <br>Except they do. Just like here on /a/, 2chan has a hibike thread 24/7.</br></br>  <br>Literally no one uses 2ch anymore.</br>  <br>They zoom in on the hands at the end. Why the would they just do that if its just Reina's. Just ignore the idiot. KyoAni can't draw hands.</br>  <br>Reina is clasping Kumiko's left hand with her right, both their thumbs are pointed towards their own bodies<br><br>Makes perfect sense<br><br>You can try it yourself, unless you only got 2 left hands</br></br></br></br></br>  I live in Japan and nobody cares about Hibikek.  <br>Neat.</br>  <br>They go through 5 1000+ post threads a day when Hibike airs<br><br>That's faster than /a/</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody cares about anime in general even in japan</br>  I bet she gives the greatest head.  <br>No one ever got gold for having fun.</br>  <br>This shot? You can tell the difference in skintone apart even clearer<br><br>Reina's on the left, Kumiko's on the right. Exactly as I drew here </br></br></br>  <br>Contrabass would be fun. You don't have to deal with smelly reeds and spit either, just pure string.</br>  <br>Do you know it's like chatroom right? <br>Also while it has more posts, they barely  buy the BD. </br></br>  Too bad I couldn't enjoy talking about my favorite girl throughout the season.  <br>Greasy hands.</br>  <br>What did you do to make your hands so greasy?</br>  <br>And people here do? Let's be real.</br>  <br><br><br>I tried to make it clearer</br></br></br>  <br>Do you know their threads all have unique IDs so you can tell each person only posts maybe 4-8 times on average? <br><br>Good job moving the goalposts though</br></br></br>  <br>I know that I'm just telling the retard who says its only Reina's hands, to remember the zoom in part, which clearly indicates its both of their hands.</br>  <br>Sure if you cherry pick. But if you take close ups of hands of any KyoAni show since Nichijou, you'll see how wrong you are. The hands in Chuu2, KnK, and Amagi, were very well drawn. Hibike had good hands too when they were close-ups and not playing instruments sometimes.</br>  Do I need LOW TEST to enjoy Hibikek?  <br>Fuck, I forgot the image</br>  Natsuki-senpai is a wolf  <br>You gotta be a high test alpha male like Goto to enjoy RIKO</br>  https://twitter.com/kekkaisensen<br>50k followers<br><br>https://twitter.com/anime_eupho<br>41.8k followers</br></br></br></br>  I want kyoani to make a show about the art club. That could be really beautiful.  <br>Jeff Goldblum on suicide watch.</br>  <br>Sweaty + Conbass is like the usual combinations in the bands I've been on (or seen)</br>  <br>It's called Myriad Colors Phantom World</br>  <br>I thought that was harem chuuni shit. Is an art club in the background like the lit club was in KnK?</br>    <br>Gotou is a beta bitch.<br>She denied dating him in public because she was so embarrassed about him, and all he did was complain like a baby.<br><br>Even Shuichi the wifebeater is more manly than he is</br></br></br></br>  <br>Huh, I didn't have that problem with cello.</br>  <br> Shuichi the wifebeater <br><br>excuse me</br></br></br>  <br>He physically assaulted Kumiko in public.<br>I can only imagine what he does to her in private.</br></br>  <br>She probably wanted to avoid awkwardness like getting asked if they're doing it just like Asuka did. They're both private people and Asuka is a loudmouthed faggot.</br>  <br>Shuichi is a total fuckboy. Didn't even see the brofist signal what a complete square<br><br>Bet he misses high fives too</br></br></br>  Identify these legs  <br>It's harem bullshit alright, but you can even see drawings in the cover.</br>  <br> asked if they're doing it just like Asuka did <br>When Asuka asked "are you doing it already?" she was referring to making their relationship public. I think so.</br></br>  <br>That ass though</br>  <br>Taki sensei was so cute in the last episode.<br>I'm sorry I ever doubted him.</br></br>  Just finished rewatching the whole thing<br> mfw <br>why does it have to end ;_;</br></br>  <br>It also looks as if she were clasping her own hands</br>  <br>Chuubas on the left. I don't know about the rest but part of me thinks they're the horns.</br>  <br>I can't.<br><br>Sasuga KyoAnus.</br></br></br>  <br> not tensing up and trying to look ahead when with love interest </br>  <br>She looked sad. I don't know anything about the novels so I don't know her tragic back story.</br>  <br>Actually it looks pretty awkward either way.</br>  <br>Where's Kumiko's hand at then?</br>  <br>The cheering scene was too adorable.</br>  <br>She's using it to support herself.</br>  <br>In Reina's underwear.</br>  <br> tensing up around your love interest <br><br>Beta confirmed</br></br></br>  <br>Her private life would just have less drama  and physical pain  if Kitauji lost.</br>  <br>Why doesn't this guy just fuck Reina already?<br><br>She clearly would spread her legs wide open for him if he so much as ask.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying Reina doesn't spill spaghetti everywhere when she's near Taki <br>that's how love works, anon.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the lovely image</br>  <br> she was referring to making their relationship public. <br> I think so. </br></br>   Left &gt; Right   <br> Implying everyone on this entire site isn't beta. </br>  <br>Goddamn, she's got nice big tits. Look at that curve from her neck to the peak of her chest. How old is she? Man, they grow quickly these days. She's gonna be a good wife for Taki.</br>  <br> Taki going shh after getting caught up in the moment <br>I didn't want to like him but he's making it very hard now.</br></br>  <br>I wonder the same.  I wonder how their interaction will change once she confesses. </br>  <br>The way the hands are shaking indicates that one of them clasping the other one tighter.</br>  <br>I can make a video of myself doing the exact same shit</br>  <br> how old is she <br>WHAT IS THE POINT OF ASKING THIS IN A HIGH SCHOOL CAST SHOW?<br>I mean it, really. Girls on average finish growin by the age of 14-15.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the point is why would you?</br>  Threadly reminder Reina is old enough to marry  Taki.   <br>What the hell are you even talking about. This is last scene before everything fades to black.</br>  <br><br>It's obviously one another so shut up already. You can tell by the fucking skin tones that Reina's hand in on the left and Kumiko's is on the right.</br></br>  <br>Uh, isn't she supposed to be a lesbo? <br><br>I can't really tell. <br><br>I don't watch this show, but you have some threads with people saying she'll be a couple with the brown haired girl and you have other threads filled with people saying she'll fuck the glasses dude.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to have sex with kumiko  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127466747   <br>Relax mang here have this drawing it might ease your nerves a lil bit</br>  So we all agree Hibike is AOTS right?  <br> not recognizing pasta from the first sentence </br>  <br>As expected of GodAni. The ending was a masterpiece</br>  <br>The two girls are chuunis so they just come off as lesbos, they both have guys that they like. The other girl even hooks up with her guy later in the novels while this one spends rest of the novels obsessing over her teacher.</br>  Today at uni I saw a guy, prolly an adviser, who wast at least 20 years older than me but damn, he was like fine wine. <br>You can do it Reina. Go for your old, fine man.</br>  Where the fuck is FFF's release for 12 and 13?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127466747 <br>Just realized I haven't seen this post in quite a while.</br>  That yabai. Wet.  <br>Class s is chuuni now?</br>  <br>what was going trough her head at that moment?</br>  <br> you fagotts don't even know </br>  I want to eat out that ass while Reina is watching it.  <br>Even when aroused she still has the blank stare. This turns me on more for some reason.</br>    <br>See? These moeblob bullshit invites these newfags in. <br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  bueah  <br>I'm still waiting patiently. I wish people who waited had their own threads.</br>  <br>Can you imagine her having sex?</br>  <br>It is when it makes them sound like Rikka and Deko.</br>  I want to watch this but I've been a freelance trombonist for 7 years now and I know I'm gonna go full-autist over all the parts of the show where the writer inevitably didn't do their research.<br><br>I mean, fuck, just seeing a wind symphony with only 2 euphoniums to 5 trombones is triggering my autism. What's the point of having the euphoniums if they have to overblow their instruments just to blend? Why only 5 trumpets? Why are there only 2 tubas and a double-bass when there's so much tenor and alto voicing?</br></br>    <br> freelance trombonist for 7 <br>Its ok anon, no one will judge you here for being unemployed.</br></br>  <br>Will there be another card in an OVA<br>there are only 53 people but 55 places <br>who are the two missing people?</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't seen any bandfags complaining in these threads. They all say it's very accurate<br><br>Maybe you can be the first to find a flaw</br></br></br>  <br><br>For what it's worth, I'd be interested in hearing about all the parts they got wrong.</br></br>  <br>That one has the people cut by auditions removed</br>  <br>Taki card?<br>I think the max is 55, but there's nothing against having less.</br></br>  <br><br>Why is Kumiko opening a can of red bull?</br></br>  <br>She's also got a condom in her mouth <br><br>Obviously ready to go all night</br></br></br>  <br>It's a school band, so the kids are gonna play what they want to play for the most part. It's not like you're picking from a particularly large pool of applicants, especially since they're a slacker school to begin with.</br>  <br>What's the "proper" instrumentation? I figured it didn't matter since it was just a high school band.</br>  <br><br>go where at night?</br></br>  <br> freelance trombonist <br>That's a cute way of saying unemployed.</br></br>  <br>Everyone cares.</br>  I want to believe.  <br>To bed anon. Where do you go at night?</br>  <br>But she won't be able to sleep if she drinks red bull.</br>  Would you watch it?  <br>please do not trample on the dead like this</br>  http://anime-eupho.com/product/ost/<wbr><br><br>im looking forward to their rendition of Rydeen.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Reina's love wins over death.</br>  <br><br>Only if he impregnates them all with his drum stick.</br></br>  <br>no because hetshit</br>  <br/>  <br>No because that boring shit has been done to death.</br>  <br>She's dead Taki.<br>Dead.</br></br>  <br>What if Asuka shows up halfway through, and steals his bitches just has was setting up all the right flags?</br>  <br>I go on /a/.</br>  <br>She already has a bunch of girls after her. I don't think she wants anymore.</br>  <br>The worst feeling is seeing the banner of it and a 300 post Naruto thread in the catalog at the same time.</br>  A master pouter. <br><br>Fucking Shuichi, lucky sod.</br></br>  <br>Imagine Taki's face when he's told his wife died.<br> I wanna draw it </br></br>  Even if the anime downplays their relationship, the OTP still stands strong. And if Kyoani doesnt plan on continuing the series they're basically telling yurifags to buy the novels and get fucked hard.  <br><br>What does it feel like to get ignored, 'gehd', tongue clicked,stomped and kicked by Kumiko, /a/?</br></br>  <br>BUCHOU<br>E<br>S<br>T</br></br></br></br>  <br>Only if the imouto goes yandere and use the other girls heads as drums.</br>  <br>But the second novel has tons of yuri. The best kind of yuri, not this shit Kumiko x Kousaka crap.</br>  <br>What's the yuri in novel two? Natsuki and Yuuko?<br>Or Oboe-chan and her friend? Are those two legit gay? Or does one of them have subtext with Kumiko?<br><br>Anyone posted any explains of yuri scenes from novel 2?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>i'd appreciate Kumiko and Reina's relationship if it werent so over the top and obnoxious. It's just so inconsistent to the point you're wondering if it's all bait. The way they keep making them do and say super intimate things and then have Reina lust for Taki-sensei is just ridiculous.</br></br>  <br>You're blowing it out of proportion because you've been influenced by these threads too much.</br>  <br>Its all subtext anon. There are no carpet munching lesbos in this series.</br>    <br>But does Taki WANT to marry Reina?</br>  <br>Novelanon said Mizore basically fell in love with Nozomi. And plays Oboe for her.</br>  <br>He does. What he thinks he wants is another matter, but that's irrelevant.</br>  <br><br>No, other people feel the same not just /a/nons.</br></br>   <br>Mizore is unstable. I would not say she "falls in love" with Nozomi, as much as she puts every bit of her emotional energy into her friendship with Nozomi. It might look like love, but she's just latching on to the only thing she has.</br>  There's is f/u/ck/u/p who's trying to convince in her landwhale posts that Reina's love for Taki is nothing but a simple schoolgrill crush and I swear for everything that is holy that I will find you and I will kill you  <br>Internet anime communities in general are overrun by shipperfags who blow everything out of proportion.<br><br>There was yuri bait in episodes 8 and 11, but it was nowhere near as bad as people make it out to be, and the other episodes make it clear you're not supposed to take them seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw one person wondering why a clarinet did the tuning for the band when they have an oboe.</br>  Natsuki will never give you her bedroom eyes.  <br>They all have electric tuners anyway.</br>  <br>please don't tell me you're actually taking it seriously. it's the same as young girls wanting to marry their fathers.<br><br>taki's heart belongs to the grave, and reina will grow up and find real love</br></br></br>  <br>Just imagine if we didn't get spoiled and didn't know he has a dead wife. We would have gotten countless threads laughing about how Reina got NTR'd.</br>  <br>Doesn't she have Yuuko?</br>  <br>that is incorrect.</br>  <br>I wondered the same in that scene.</br>  <br><br>But it is bad. You simply dont say I could die right now, slide down one's finger on someone's lips, hold her face and look deeply into her eyes, kill me if i abandon you, and talk about love confessions.</br></br>  <br>It's hard not to.</br>  <br>The whole point is that Reina's super sophisticated mature girl act, is just that, an act. Peel back the layer and you see that she's prone to same things that all silly little girls are. Including crushing on older dudes.</br>  <br>Is not an act you cuck she literally doesn't give a fuck</br>  Damn that was an excellent show I gave it a 9/10.    <br>You don't get her character. She gives a whole lotta fuck. She wants to be the very best, like no one ever was. She just doesn't show it.<br>The genius of her character is that while she appears to be a kuudere, as the show goes on you realize she's really competitive and burning with passion underneath.<br><br>This need a new term. something like 'hot' or 'burning' dere in opposition to a kuudere. A reverse reiclone if you will.</br></br></br></br>  <br> kyoani will never animate her <br>what a waste</br></br>  Shuichi got good.  <br>what a waste indeed</br>  <br>Shinka?<br><br>I love that smile Taki gave when he nailed the part he was struggling with.</br></br></br>  <br>because it's a club, the kids pick what they wanted to play. It's not like they're a properly organized and paid band. They only have one oboe player and it becomes a fucking disaster when they're in trouble of losing their only oboe.</br>  <br>she's still dead though, you can't be ntr'd by a ghost  inb4 ghost banri </br>  so what do you guys think about Taki sensei now that the show is over? He was a hardass but he led them victory. Also dead wife.   Wishes don't come true unless you wish out loud <br> We're definitely going to the nationals <br><br>Fucking loved this scene, this girl has grown so much throughout the series</br></br></br>  <br>Shit he did? Didn't even notice. I'm a dumbass.</br>  <br>I hate him.</br>  are you ready to worship your new overlord?  <br>The subtle physical expressions in the series were great. In the final performance it captured the feeling pretty well, more than just being technically accurate in animation would have.</br>  <br>I want AsukaxNozomi hatesex doujins.</br>  <br>but why is it okay for a guy to go for the sensei end then?</br>  <br>give me peace chan or give me death</br>  <br>Because we are all fujoshi here.</br>  <br>it's not okay<br><br>the boundary between a caretaker and their charge should be held sacrosanct</br></br></br>  <br>Moefaggots getting rekt again</br>  I was alive when KyoAni created this classic.  <br>you're witnessing the 2nd coming of Kyoani</br>  <br>this show sucked though. you wont remember a single thing about it beyond the two episodes where they performed.</br>  <br>A classic that barely sold 6k with an event ticket attached to it ? <br>Come on, everyone will forget this by next season</br></br>  <br>Holy shit that Reina midriff.</br>  <br> sales determine quality <br>Yeah, we all know that Free!, IS, and Monogatari are masterpieces.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127464077 <br>Both are shit, faggot.</br>  <br>Don't feel bad, it was pretty subtle. Just rewatch and enjoy.</br>  <br>Monogatari and free are better than Hibike quality wise though</br>  <br>You do if you have a relationship like Kumiko and Reina do.<br>You misunderstand their characters.<br><br>The whole point behind Reina's character is that she's socially awkward but wishes she was special and tries to act the way she imagines special people do.<br>The whole point behind Kumiko's character is that she has problems opening up, she tries to avoid drama and goes with the flow, and that she's privately a sarcastic, cynical person.<br><br>That explains why they act the way they do, and why their opposite personalities attract each other. Reina became aware of Kumiko's cynical personality in middle school and that made her intrigued about Kumiko. Kumiko was worried about Reina hating her since she accidentally opened up to her, and that's what initially made Kumiko obsess with Reina, while also being attracted to Reina's "loner/different" attitude (something she secretly aspires to).<br><br>They're both attracted to each other and wish they were friends. Reina acts and behaves in an over the top, extravagant way she imagines a mature, sophisticated adult does. Kumiko is free to be herself around Reina and let out her real, teasing personality. They're very close to each other, but in the end, it's all just banter. Neither of them takes it seriously or thinks of other as a romantic interest.<br><br>Kyoani loves yuribait and they made those scenes appear as romantic as possible, but I doubt it was ever their intention to trick you into actually believing that they might be a couple. It's just fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I'm going to marry Kumiko!  <br>It's complicated. I don't like how harsh he is but he does reward with praise when it's earned. I don't like how distant he is with that constant smile but I do know that he feels deep affection for others. He really loved his wife which I find really moving. At the very least I like him more now then when I did when I first saw him.</br>  the ED felt like I was watching the credits for a game  He let Ribbon bully him all over the joint, He needs to get some balls.  <br>with or without ponytails?</br>  <br>it was a nice touch</br>  I want to watch their shenanigans. <br><br><br>Shuichi, please. You haven't even graduated high school yet.</br></br></br>  <br>B team spinoff series never</br>  <br>Good, no one wants to watch the slackers and the losers.</br>  <br>I do. I want a comedy centered around them.<br>Every episode they might show us the tryhards with their bullshit drama for a minute just so we can appreciate how better the B team has it.</br></br>  <br>What do they actually do? in the show it was mentioned they were preparing their own piece but we never heard it.</br>  <br>And you never will.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>We'll support you, Reina.</br>  <br><br> but I doubt it was ever their intention to trick you into actually believing that they might be a couple. It's just fanservice. <br><br>Red string of fate motherfucker. They want to bait people into watching, simple as that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>in the novel, they perform after the A-team does, which technically means they never perform because the 1st novel ends after the A-team performs  they lose anyway though <br><br>The purpose of the B-team though is to play music at the school events, like the school festival while the A-team goes to concerts.</br></br></br>  <br>There's only maybe 10 people in the B team though how does that even work</br>  <br>lol, they purposefully hid everyone else's hands, and the one visible hand they drew has the wrong chirality.</br>  <br><br>How do the nips react to this? western fans obviously view this as romance and considers them gay. Might be a cultural thing</br></br>  <br>Their "attraction" to each other.<br><br>Pretty sure it stood out how Kumiko is the only one that clapped for Reina AND she Stood Up to boot!</br></br></br>  Deepthroat specialist.  <br>It's in the ED.<br>OP and ED literally don't matter. The same ED had Hazuki and Midori as the other two main characters.<br>Hell, look at previous Kyoani EDs. Did you watch Hyouka?</br></br></br>  <br>Nakagawa Natsuki-chan no euphonium.</br>  <br>they've got one of each instrument, they just pick an easy song to play</br>  <br><br>I remember Hyouka's ed but it wasnt blatant as Hibike's. It wasnt as touchy or physical but the red string says a lot.</br></br>  Reminder that true homo end did happen.  <br>Fuck, I always mistake her with the other short haired meganekko from the percussion section. Which one was the one embarrassed because Knucles-senpai had his zipper open?</br>   want to watch B team play shit <br> not a spin off of all male characters of the band with Motherfucking Tanabe as MC <br><br>Gay</br></br></br>  <br> not Knuckle </br>  <br>I want a spin-off about these challenging each other.</br>  <br>Dude, what? It was a billion times more yuribait that Hibike's. Hibike's just had the red string. Hyouka's had Mayaka and Chitanda lazily and sensually rolling around on the bed, holding hands with interlocking fingers, holding that orb together and leaning onto each other while romantic music is playing.<br><br>The point was, despite that ED, Mayaka and Chitanda literally do not exchange more than two words with each other through the entire anime, even if ED makes them look like lovers. You shouldn't take stuff from Kyoani OPs/EDs seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>the freshmen is the one who gives Tanabe blowjobs between practice.</br>  lmao bitch nerd wife is dead  what went wrong?  <br> Hibike's just had the red string. Hyouka's had Mayaka and Chitanda lazily and sensually rolling around on the bed, holding hands with interlocking fingers, holding that orb together and leaning onto each other while romantic music is playing. <br><br>Hyouka is just your standard fanservice crap,this set-up is pretty common in all media. The red string is much more suggestive because of how it's connected and associated to romance. Sometimes less is more.</br></br></br>  <br>Everything.</br>  <br>Someone called her ugly.</br>  Why the heck was Hazuki so irrelevant? She should have had more screentime, she was clearly best girl.<br><br> Sequel movie where Kumiko wins the Shuuichi when? </br></br>  <br>Where do the boobs come from?</br>  <br>The natural reaction of anyone would be to look down at his crotch. Kyoani failed.</br>  <br>Reina died in a terrible trumpet accident]<br> also fixed your pic </br></br>  Its just me or the final song sounds straight outta a video game soundtrack?  <br>Oh ok, so blowjob-chan != I'm-going-to-shlick-hard-to-Tanabex<wbr>Noguchi-chan.</wbr></br>  <br>I can't remember the instrument second from the left played. Fifth from the right is really familiar but I can't remember what she played either.</br>  <br>Fifth from right played trombone and is my crack OTP with Shuuichi.</br>  <br>Did you draw the frame freehand?</br>  <br>Nah, just used the magic wand tool on the image above it</br>  <br>If he's a friend, why was he using Ninjutsu on the girls?</br>   Ohaiyo.   <br>It's kinda jaggy at places...</br>  <br>Oh yeah that's right. I'm going to guess second from the left is a clarinet since there were a lot of those.</br>  <br>Trumpet, Clarinet?, Horn, Percussion, Tuba, Flute, Trombone, Trumpet, Euphonium, Alto Saxophone</br>  <br><br>Mu crack ship is Shuichi and Azusa. They're past bandmates Andthey play both the trombone. It's perfect</br></br>  <br>More like oyasumi.</br>  <br> inb4 season 2 is about Azusa trying to take Shuichi away and that's when Kumiko realizes she loves him </br>  <br>they can bond over what a rude and awkward girl kumiko has turned out to be</br>   tfw it's over <br>I'll miss it. s2 when</br>  Who the fuck is Azusa?  <br> Movie <br> Hopefully </br></br>  <br>Was hoping they'd show that last shot without the damn credits blocking but no such luck.</br>  <br>I want to have casual friendly sex with Mamiko and then have some pillow talk where we discuss how much of a bitch Kumiko is</br>  <br>already got you covered<br> yfw the fagotts got to hold the certificate </br></br>  <br>The girl one year lower than Yui and friends.</br>    <br>Tanabe not being close to the other guys basically confirms he and glasses are a couple.</br>  s2 never    <br>Who's taking the picture?</br>  <br>A photographer, probably.</br>  <br><br>Well they'll probably do somethig about Azusa being depressed</br></br>  <br>this girl who has a million shots in the last episode for no reason until s2</br>  <br>Bless you, sweet child.</br>  <br>Someone shop Aoi in the picture.</br>  <br>I barely recognized Kumiko there with her ponytail.</br>  God dammit. I want them animate Asuka's arc.<br><br>Shit's gonna go down. At least animate that and then give an anime original movie to close it.<br><br>PLEASE KYOANILORDS</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, I feel so bad for her.</br>  <br>Did you edit this yourself?</br>  <br>Christ, what's wrong with Asuka's face?</br>  <br>somebody else did</br>  <br>oh, i was about to congratulate you on an excellent job but nevermind</br>  <br><br> Azusa is depressed and seeks company <br> bumps to weiner boy <br> they talk and bond <br> even teaches him how to play better with the trombone <br> Kumiko sees them so close and intimate <br> kimi to natsu no owari </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br> Kekkaisensen <br> established material <br><br> eupho <br> unknown novel which was animated <br><br>TOP KEK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope she gets some sort of happiness in her life.</br>  <br>Never forget</br>  <br><br>Where's twintails trombone girl? cant see her.</br></br>  <br><br>Had the scenes on the left been original, it would've made me jump off right into nostalgia alley and play ff8 and it's shitty draw system again.</br></br>  <br>It's all right it's fixed now.</br>  <br>Why?</br>  <br><br>Fuck KyoAni make a god damn S2.

You won Gold in two years in a row and on your way to Regionals. Got good at a completely new instrument and passed the audition. He got the part he was getting difficulty with before the competition. He reconciled with his childhood friend/crush.  <br>Reina still presents a significant threat to him, though. Even with no-homo, he still has to compete with her for Kumiko facetime.</br>  <br>Reina is actually the biggest kumiko x shuuichi shipper</br>  <br>Bet he went out and bought two wieners to celebrate right after the competition</br>  <br>how is smug??? next to the one holding the card</br>  we can never see interaction between kumiko and reina any more...  <br>You can learn Japanese to read the novels or wait until they're translated if you want more.</br>  I have a complex feeling. I want to see 2nd season but it will be more hetero anime. It will dissapoint me  <br> no one uses 2ch anymore <br><br>This is the pinnacle of bait.

So does taki wife has long or short hair?  <br>She doesn't have any hair, because she's dead.</br>  <br>They really needed one more episode for this shit</br>  <br>one more season*</br>  <br>and two more movies</br>  <br>Why are her eupho and Ribbon-Chan's trumpet silver instead of brass-coloured?</br>  <br>Her eupho was a gift from her dad.</br>  <br>I mean in a more technical sense. Are those instruments really made from an alloy with contains largely silver and are therefore distincly more expensive than brass ones?<br>How does that change the tone quality?</br></br>  <br><br>Two more seasons, one for second and one for third volume. Enough OVAs to cover every single volume four short story. Autism! Love Story, anime original movie where Reina finally wins the Takib owl.</br></br>  <br>My dream</br>  <br>Kekkai Sensen is a bad show.</br>  <br>I love her enough to transcend the 2d/3d barrier.</br>  <br>Because she has a 4000$ professional ufo.<br><br>Ayyyyyy lamma oh.</br></br></br>  <br> That's yurei-baiting. </br>  <br>Ok, I looked it up and it semms that it's just a very thin silver plating that does not change the tone quality at all - I assume it is just a vanity modification then.</br>  <br>Certainly not Sapphire-chan, since she's talented, sociable and comes from a very rich family.</br>  <br>Reina and Mizore</br>  <br> It's harem bullshit alright, but you can even see drawings in the cover. <br><br>I can't even imagine which KyoAni director would take on that series</br></br></br>  <br> Character songs <br>Meh, I want the background music and brass band pieces.</br></br>  <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>07136<br>Fucking finally.</br></wbr></br>  <br>There are silver bands and brass bands, it's just an esthetic thing.</br>  <br>Did he get any pussy in the end?</br>  Just finished watching this and i have a question. In episode 11 Hazuki mentions Taki told all the people who didn't pass the audition to prepare a piece. What was ever the point of that? I wouldn't think Taki would go and waste time listening to their piece and taking up practicing time.  hetfags absolutely B T F O  Daily reminder that Asuka is a wreck.  <br>Its important for them (those in the secondary band) to continue developing as musicians, if for the simple reason that people must replace those who are graduating, and if a few people in the "B" team can step it up and be able to be in the first band the next year, while having something to work on, that's a lot better than just having them all sit around.<br><br>I think most bands that are large enough to cut people do this.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh man. If this just gets half as crushing as Haikyuu S1's ending was, this will be a genuine gold.</br></br>  <br>It's not even an "if" matter, a significant amount of the band is third years, so lots of spaces will open up and the B team will be likely to fill a lot of them</br>  <br>Why do soccer teams still bother having the other team members besides the main 11 players practice?</br>  <br>With the band, I think it was more that they still needed the audition failures in case someone who had made it came down with some life-threatening condition and urgently needed an organ transplant.</br>  Reminder that left fagott is best girl  <br>He just has to ask and Reina would give him all her girl holes.

Nobody actually gives a shit about anything else, it's all Kyoani this, Shaft that, Muh ufoTABLE, over and over every season while actually good shows pass them by and then they turn around and say everything else is shit and squabble over whichever of those trendy otaku centric studios shows is the AOTS with nothing else even allowed to enter the equation. It's the saddest fucking thing ever, like even Japan barely gives a shit about these studios these days, none of them have even created anything on their own lately. The closest you can come is Shaft with Madoka and even then that's like one fucking show that'd be 5 years old in a few more months. ufoTABLE would be nothing without Type Moon and Bandai Namco hot licenses to work through and Kyoani has barely been a factor since K-On and to date has made one anime totally from in house, Munto which was terrible.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not liking KyoAni seasonal Masterpieces </br>  <br> watching fairy tail with food </br>  Anime fandom has been stuck in the late 2000s since well, the late 2000s. The only studio that's managed to have consistent hits pretty much multiple times every decade is Sunrise and one again they find themselves on top yet utterly invisible outside of Japan. Meanwhile while Japan even murmurs about what's going to happen with studios like Shaft and Kyoani going forward for whatever reason the Western fans continue to act like they're king shit. It's fucking bizarre. Like ask an average Japanese person what they're favorite studio is and they'll say Ghibli, Sunrise, I.G, Toei, Madhouse or something like that but ask a Western fan and good luck hearing anything other than Kyoani, Shaft or the latest trend ufoTABLE. <br><br>The West now has a really skewed and limited view of the anime thats coming out. Yes moe shit is popular in Japan among otaku dominated overwhelmingly by Love Live right now but god help them at least the country popular still finds time for good decent shit like The Wind Rises or Yamato 2199.</br></br>  <br> mediocre:the chart </br>   mfw people shit on Golden Time   Mio Honda is perfect.  <br>Does P know the idols he produces are turning men into lolicons?</br>  <br>That's a lot of butt she has there</br>  <br>I'd rather be the L@LI MASTER</br>  Uzuki is cute!!  <br>Nice songs especially Tsubomi<br>But Syuko gets two songs while Arisu has none?

Yamoto comes back next arc, right?  <br> Most probably Back In Black <br>Nope, not this time.<br><br>Have you got used to the two-parter episodes? Well how about a three-parter! More Nancy bondage, Darkninja doing cool things after being beaten, Frieza and literal cancer, all in a single episode!<br><br><br>She's guaranteed to come back in the anime, though we don't know when.

Keep a lookout on Nyaa this weekend for BD ISO, I don't know how to encode but I'll just throw up the disc image.  I haven't watch this since Episode 4.

For which I would charge $30 or $40, because that's more than half the work for me.</br></br></br>  <br>What I meant is that a "sketch" is pretty vague. On the other hand it seems like I misinterpreted what you meant, thought you were a commissionner who wouldn't pay more than 5 bucks for a sketch, not a drawer making commissions.</br>  <br><br>Oh they did.

The trailer looked more like EM.</br>  <br>Coolman229 please.</br>  <br> EM  <br> not BTFO </br></br>  <br>I'm not interested in the movie because none of the characters I like are in it.</br>  <br>fuku-shuu pls.</br>  <br>I guess we should let him have fun and post his shitty fanarts. It's all he has left. <br><br><br>Watch the trailer in HD and pause it. It's definitely not Eren. Plus the actress that played Mikasa said she doesn't see EM as romantic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same. Although I got a little interested after Isayama was mentioned. I might watch it to have good laugh though.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the kiss, but the trailer in general. The kiss looks kind of forced and Eren will probably go full rageturd on him or some bullshit like that.</br>  <br> EM were screaming each other's names and Eren was jealous after Shikishima kissed Micucksa.</br>  <br>Maybe the story will be better than the actual manga</br>  <br>Is it karma for chapter 70 now that Eren is the cuck?</br>  <br>Well at least shippers get the romance fantasy they've always wanted.</br>  <br>The guns already make me sceptical.</br>  <br>Eren's too busy holding hands with Armin or Historia to care what Mikasa does.</br>  <br>But it doesn't Mikasa, who is stronk, didn't push him off and even closed her eyes.</br>  <br>Why would he? It's not like Shikishima was raping his sister.</br>  <br>She doesn't have her strength in the movie.</br>  <br>Maybe Eren will push him away. We already saw a pic of Eren arguing with OC guy. She also makes a strange face before it happens.</br>  <br>I was talking about movie Eren getting buttmad. Historia's not even in the movie because no aryans.</br>   an OOC 3DPD movie had to be made to give EMfags what they want <br>How sad.</br>  <br>[citation needed]<br>Eren is still a titan, and she's still the first of her class.</br></br>  i hope my fellow ymirbrothers will follow me in mass suicide if Isayama actually dares to continue going this het road with EH  <br><br>Why are so many people saying Eren was jealous by the kiss? What part of the trailer showed that?</br></br>  <br>He was seen arguing with Donut Steel later. But it could be a different scene entirely.</br>  <br>Mind posting pic? And that's Kiko overall face, really.</br>  <br>If she was in the movie he would tell her how amazing she was while Mikasa is getting kissed by some shitlet OC.</br>  <br>The EMfags and LMfags got everything they wanted in the movie.</br>  <br>But she is. Her name in it is Hayana or something like that.</br>  <br>Too bad she's not and now Eren is stuck in kebab cuckland.</br>  <br>Yes, a shitty adaption. Feels good being an EHfag.</br>  <br>The scene where he goes in to punch the OC guy. You can see the background is the same scene.</br>  <br> google hayana shingeki movie <br> get indian porn star in results </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>   Series with actual plot <br> everyone is talking about shipping instead </br>  <br> My nigga </br>  <br>You can't really see the background of the kiss scene, and they are with the clothes all the movie, probably.</br>  <br>I'd say wait until the actual chapter comes out but there'd probably be shitposting anyway.</br>  <br>Who cares? It's an OOC adaption anyway. Don't waste time in analysing something insignificant.</br>  <br>I doubt Eren would punch someone above him in rank for kissing Mikasa.</br>  <br>Still related to the series and allowed.</br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br>It's Hiana.</br>  <br>Maybe movie Eren is different. He's a shitty plot device in the manga after all, he could actually have character in live action.</br>  Whats EM and LM?  <br>Glowing titty.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Eren x Marco and Levi x Marco</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>  Are you guys ready for some troubles?  <br>I thought that was movie Annie since she's apparently canon with movie Bert.</br>  <br>The ships eremikadefensesquad and ackersexual fight each other for.</br>  <br>Lili or whatever is annie.</br>  <br><br> canon with bert <br> not with armin <br><br>What is this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it true that his name is  Remus? </br>  <br>That's Lili.</br>  <br>Annie is Lil. Bertholdt isn't in the movie.</br>  <br>How is punching someone for a kiss considered having character? If they were going to change him that much they were better off changing his name and calling him an OC too. The whole reason why certain characters had their names changed was to avoid pissed off fans so why would they have a main character named Eren in love with Mikasa? You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character.</br>  <br>I really hope we actually get his name next chapter.</br>  <br>Then who is Colossal</br>  <br>More than ever.</br>  <br>Armin.</br>  <br><br>No idea, haven't heard it yet.<br><br><br><br> inb4 his last name is Jaeger </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's also a rageturd in the manga.</br>  <br>His name is Chaz.</br>  <br>Not Bert is Fukushi.</br>    <br> You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character <br>Says who? Mikasa looks pretty OOC too.</br></br>  <br>Why is Annie kissing Krista?</br>  <br>He still wouldn't be obsessively jealous of Mikasa and punch a guy for kissing her, even in the manga. His brain just isn't programmed to care about shit like that.</br>  While we're on the topic of troubles, who had it worse?<br><br>Nick or Mike? <br><br> I vote Nick because he was a god-fearing man who didn't afraid of anything </br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch the movie to know. She even do the cruel world speech and all.</br>  <br>Because short blonde girls have to stick together</br>  <br>Maybe that's the only OOC part about him.</br>  <br><br>That's not Krista its Reiner.</br></br>  Will we get something like this again this month, brothers?  <br>Damn, Nips are really really ugly people compared to their anime characters.<br><br>I guess you were right when you said that anime is based on white people.</br></br></br>  <br>Just that he didn't punch Levi, they were just talking.</br>  <br>Maybe he would. Who's to say he wouldn't react that way.</br>  <br>Nips are on average very ugly.</br>  <br>We didn't see the whole scene. Just a pic of him arguing with OC guy.</br>  <br>Does Ackerman talk count?</br>  <br>If they didn't care about characters looking OOC they would've put manlet in there and actually used his name. So far movie Mikasa has said the same lines she said in the manga so I don't see how she's OOC.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Again, pic pls?</br>  <br>So much our dreams of going there and becoming English teachers and live the dream of eating ramen and sushi and bento and buying Shingeki no Kyojin merchandise all day long.</br>  <br>Shonkishima grabbed his fist.</br>  <br>Bert getting NTRed is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>I was thinking more about the lines of eh moments. But EMfags getting BTFO would be nice too.</br>  Which characters other than Levi weren't in the film?  <br>I fear Isayama is going to toss EH's relationship away.</br>  <br>Do you even read the manga? Eren didn't get the whole Marlo/Hitch thing and he didn't even realize Jean was in love with Mikasa even after he practically said it to him. Eren doesn't care about romance and wouldn't care about someone kissing Mikasa. He'd probably just tell them to hurry up so they can get on with the mission.</br>  <br>Probably, since a new arc is starting.</br>  <br>That's not gonna happen. Though they might not interact this chapter.</br>  <br>BRAY, Erwin, Connie, and Marco.</br>  <br><br>Truly the purest form of justice.</br></br>  <br>*BRAYH</br>  <br>Who the fuck were in the titans then?</br>  <br>Everyone, except EMA.</br>  <br>Will Historia give Eren a good luck kissu?</br>  <br>i'm just wondering how this asshole beat the armored titan</br>  <br> the kids look like chimpanzees <br><br>Hetfag fanart always delivering the worst quality possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Historia is obviously going in the next scouting, so I don't see they being separated soon. She's still part of the top 10.</br>  <br>EH child looks like it has downs.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't even care about the Hetfaggotry, just liked the crazy AA kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Connie is in it though. So is Annie.</br>  <br>She is the queen. She cannot do this anymore, she has to wait in the orphanage for Ymir, her true love.</br>  <br>Mr. Hanji was in it.</br>  <br>Maybe the OCs?</br>  <br>After the reader learned about their connection it would make sense if they had a scene together. There's not much to discuss though. He could tell her he's an Ackerman too. Knowing how Isayama handles awkward moments it has the potential to be pretty funny.</br>  <br>Ymir is kill and Historia isn't a lesbian anyway.</br>  <br>Eren's more focused on Titans than on women. That's why Annie is the perfect girl for him.</br>  <br>I and the EMfags will probably die if that happens. Me from hapiness.</br>  <br>That's not an OC, that's the guy based on a Japanese general responsible for the genocide of Korean people. They changed his appearance / name so the movie sells better in Korea.</br>  <br>No, they're changed with Lil and Souda(?)<br>Like how Levi is changed with Shikishima and all</br></br>  <br>Annie likes Armin.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br>She has to take care of people inside the walls. They'll probably barely interact from now on, since the political arc just ended.</br>  <br>Oh, so he's Pixis? I thought he was Erwin.</br>  <br>Me too, from keking.</br>  <br>That means they aren't in it.</br>  <br>They can share each other. I'm sure none of them would object.</br>  <br>It's ok, they don't have to interact anymore. We'll get the surprise 9 months later.</br>  <br>She will carry their child and wait for Eren's return.</br>  <br>Yeah. I was saying they aren't in it.</br>  Dumping best couple.  <br><br>nice</br></br>    <br>Most of the people who lost their homes might go too, since Wall Maria's fixing is certainly by their point of view. And Historia wouldn't stay on the background doing nothing, she proved it with the chicken titan.</br>  <br> Mina/Annie <br> not Hitch/Annie </br></br>    Annie is a slut.  <br>Chicken titan was a personal thing.</br>  Arminfags are the worst shitposters, I wish they would just die.    <br><br>EH confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Anyone have that comic where Hitch challenges Historia to a contest for Annie's attention?</br>  <br><br> worse than Ymirshits and Hisfags <br><br>You're kidding right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump me in with Ymirfags and Arminfags.</br>  <br><br>Wow thanks. I didn't expect anything from this, but this Japanese perception of what Germans are like actually gave me cancer!</br></br>  <br>That was in Chuugakkou right?</br>  <br>You are still cancerous.</br>  <br>Historiafags did nothing wrong.</br>  <br><br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br> the main shitposters in every single thread since chapter 60 did nothing wrong </br></br>  <br>Just having fun like everyone else.</br>  <br> main shitposters in every single thread <br>That's Ymirfags, dumbass</br></br>  <br>There's no such thing as a non-shitposter in these threads.</br>  <br><br>Ymirfags, Hisfags. What's the difference?</br></br>  <br>Yes, they did.</br>  <br><br>Says the Hisfag.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>That would be the netherfag, and that since way before ch 60.</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/a/gZSnO</br>  <br>What exactly did Historiafags do that makes you so butthurt? Act the same as any other characterfag here?</br>  <br><br> netherfag <br><br>You mean allahfag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but thank you.</br>  <br><br> Yes <br><br> There also more annoying than Ymirfags, at least they give up after posting some shitty tumblr art </br></br></br></br>  <br>What.</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Marry me.</br>  <br> There will never be anything this good in the actual series </br>  <br> Annie's nose </br>  <br>Why is Chuugakkou Bert such a miracle?</br>  <br><br> Y-yes <br><br> Also holy shit I forgot what happened to Slutty? </br></br></br></br>  <br>You should just stay in /u/ then.</br>  <br> caring about Wesley </br>  <br><br>I don't b-but did he died or something?</br></br>  <br>Wesley is probably still shitposting here, just without the avatarfagging and soc shit.</br>  <br>He and his twin Dick are back to /co/ now.

Because Levis's an asshole. You can see it by the way he talked to Annie and how he treated Nick and Historia.<br> cravat <br> humanity's strongest <br> name who relates to Mikasa </br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't acting smug at all. He's just a manlet placeholder with changed personality.</br>  <br>Weren't there character descriptions of the movie cast or something and the only thing Shikishima has in common with Levi is that he's the world's strongest and fujos got mad because he's not cool and aloof anymore?</br>  <br>Haven't seen these.</br>  リリ    At what time dreamfag delivered last month?  <br><br>That is absolutely fucking disgusting.</br></br>   ID:HBWv1IEB <br>Dreamfag's ID on 2ch.</br>  <br>Prolly late, it's 2nd only, we have to wait 2-3 more days anon.</br>  Anyone else HYPE?  <br>You do know that IDs change all the time, right?</br>  <br>I know, browse boards with ID.

It's nice to keep the ID in mind, but it doesn't mean that if someone claims to be Dreamfag it's not him.</br>  anons say that Mikasa's kiss scene looked forced.<br>But if the person was Eren instead of the OC character will you still say the kiss scene was forced, or completely ignore the comment you stated.</br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8879656.html<br>Looks like Isayama enjoyed Mad Max</br></wbr>  <br>The kiss was not forced, Mikasa didn't react negatively from it.</br>  <br>Why people overreact about this movie? I found it meh.</br>  <br>I was replying this to the anons that through the kiss scene was forced.</br>  <br>That's because you have mediocre tastes.</br>  <br><br>Mikasa has a frown on her face and you can see that it's Shikishima that pulled her towards him. If that was supposed to be Eren I'd also think that she didn't want the kiss. or that she at least had no intention of kissing whoever's kissing her.</br></br>  <br>Did you seriously claim the live action movie is decent? Did you seriously claim that any live action movie is decent?</br>  <br>It's mad max.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're the one who does if you think this shit movie where everyone is a Nip and replaced is any good.</br>  <br>Do people here really care that much about this</br>  <br>Nevermind then, I suck cocks.</br>  <br>We're talking about Mad Max faggot.</br>  <br>Yeah I misread. Mad max was okay figures Isayama would like it.</br>  <br>What is Old Boy? What is Snowpiercer?</br>  <br>That is Kiko overall face though. And Shikishima don't pull her, her head stay in the same place, he just put his hand behind her head.</br>  <br>Pay closer attention, he not only places his hand on her nape in order to pull her towards him but he also forcefully drew his lips towards hers. You can simply tell that Mikasa was taken by surprise.</br>  <br>You guys sure go autistic for a scene that lasted less than a second.</br>  <br>I don't even care about EM or LM, it's just that LMfags take this scene as confirmation when that's not even the manlet in the first place.</br>  <br> lips open <br> eyes closed <br> doesn't show surprise. </br></br></br>  <br>LM is fucking retarded. It is the definition of forced pairing just because they stand in the same panel together and on top of that they have zero chemistry aside from fighting together as clones. I don't even like Mikasa or the other two involved but EM makes more sense.</br>  <br>No one here is saying anything about comfirmation, only a few fags who says the kiss was forced and fingerpoint.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>Of course, LMfags are tumblrwhales.</br></br>  <br>So why so much insecurity that you feel the need to keep saying it was forced, when it makes much more sense and he's not Levi?<br><br><br>Nice comeback retard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not the one calling it forced. I'm just saying I think LM is retarded but I expect such retardation from people who like Manlet or any of his pairings.</br>  <br>What is with the fujo obsession with anorexic manlet?</br>  I feel really bad for the EMfags. They're not taking this new direction gracefully.  <br>I'm loving all this obnoxiousness from someone who browses tumblr.</br>  <br>Why use the japanese title?</br>  <br> all these LM fanarts of Levi just as tall or taller than Mikasa <br>Kek, is manlet standing on a stool?</br></br>  <br> I don't know what to say, so here's some ad hominem <br>Have you ever been on google images?</br></br>  <br>EH?</br>  <br>That's his titan form after injecting himself with the serum.</br>  <br>I wonder what the fujos see on Levi, and I mean it. Do they really picture him like a tall, slender dude?</br>  Did they reach that cabin yet?  <br>Thanks for fixing the picture anon but he's way shorter than that<br><br>The top of his head should reach her nose at most</br></br></br>  <br>Mikasa is kneeling.</br>  Why do LMfags pretend Shikishima is manlet when it has been made clear he's an OC character whose only common point with Levi is that he's humanity's strongest. If they wanted to have manlet in the movie, they would have, just like they kept EMA and Hanji. I understand you want to validate your ship but Shikishima kissing Mikasa in that movie does'nt equate manlet doing it.  <br>Why are you so defensive? <br> If they wanted to have manlet in the movie, they would have <br>No, they wouldn't have. Can you imagine the shitfest had they named him Levi and kept the kiss scene?</br></br></br>  <br> Shikishichi kissing Mikasa in that movie doesn't equate manlet doing it <br>Not a LMfag, but who cares? They all look the same.</br></br>  Can we all agree that Levi is one of the worst characters?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>You know is bait, anon. The movie is going to be shit but people still are going to watch it because minor irrelevant romantic conflict.</br>  <br> that manlet face <br>Absolutely perfect.</br></br>   reading wiki stats <br> bimbong is 4'9" &amp; 92lbs <br> mfw </br></br>  <br> Comparing the best, most intelligent and most Alpha male poster in this thread with a pathetic Ymirfag who wants to become a woman. <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

Explain how Bert and Annie only exist to push other characters' development, I can understand with Ymir and Historia but I doubt that's the only reason she exists.</br>  <br>Annie, Bert and Ymir are pieces of shit but that's what makes them good because of their other redeeming qualities. Some balance in a character's personality is great. Like how Annie wanted to teach Eren, Bert grows a spine when Reiner or Annie are in danger and Ymir helps people.<br><br>Though of course you realize that and that you're a mere shitposter, so what's the point in confirming what you already know deep inside.</br></br></br>  <br>But Bimbong is 15.</br>  <br>That's the point.</br>  <br> Ymir and Historia but I doubt that's the only reason she exists. <br>True, she is also a red herring (Ymir-sama), but that makes her character only worse since she still has 0 depth. Hell, even Isayama himself basically confirmed that she is the shallowest character he has in his repertoire.<br><br>  Explain how Bert and Annie only exist to push other characters' development, <br>They have 0 character outside of them pushing the aforementioned respective character ahead in the plot. We know absolutely nothing about the Jew other than the fact she also has a dad (another worthless red herring) and that she is a strong independynt womyn. Her only purpose in the series was to trigger Eren's "development" (if you can call it that).<br><br>Bert is the most pathetic of them all since he is literally absolutely nothing other than the guy who ruined Reiner's living the good life because he was jealous that Reiner was happy and shit. A worthless subhuman who deserves his head to be beaten to a pulp. If he existed in real life, he would be this thread's Ymirfag.<br><br><br>See this piss poor rationalizations? <br> "B-but they also do dem good things!!" <br>It is blatantly obvious that anyone who disagrees on the two most factual facts of the series (1- Jean is the best written &amp; 2- AnYmBert are the worst written characters) have never read a single (well written) book in their lives and they don't even have the slightest idea what defines a well written character.<br><br>To you mongoloids, "a character that I like = good character".

But I don't understand why you posted a picture of Erwin.</br>  <br>You might have brain damage but at least you can write posts with more than 10 words so I'll take you.<br><br> Her only purpose in the series was to trigger Eren's "development" <br>Since it's obvious that you never read a book or another manga in your life, Annie still has open plot threads, even if that means she's going to serve as shifter bait.<br><br> Bert is the most pathetic of them all since he is literally absolutely nothing other than the guy who ruined Reiner's living the good life because he was jealous that Reiner was happy and shit. <br>Did you ever read the manga? Bert even let Reiner stay in his delusions, something that according to you made Reiner happy. He claims he's pathetic and he might be a subhuman but that's what puts him apart from the rest of the main cast and actually it fits well with him being the colossal titan. Better than some cliche evil overlord with a masterplan for sure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Legally she is a dwarf,</br>  <br>Now I know this is bullshit bait</br>  <br>Well now their queen is someone who should be sitting in a booster seat, not a big girl throne.</br>  <br> Bert even let Reiner stay in his delusions, something that according to you made Reiner happy. <br>He let him stay happy only until Blurt himself got too unhappy. He is literally a worthless piece of shit who's "if i'm not happy your not happy either!!  BabyRage ". Ryner would probably get a promotion for his acts of heroism in Utgard.<br><br> Since it's obvious that you never read a book or another manga in your life, <br>Ok that just has to be bullshit bait. Why am I even responding to you?<br><br>Notice that you haven't even tried to refute the claims that you don't know what a well written character is, because you know that you don't got the slightest idea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dwarfism is a genetic disease and implies disformed limbs compared to a regular human. Historia's limbs have a normal ratio, she's just very small.</br>  <br>Jean is also just the typical jerk with a heart of gold. Nothing really special.</br>  <br>Well she still has time to grow anyway. She's only 15.</br>  <br>Levi objectively got more character depth than the three shits. You can actually almost see some reasoning behind his uprearing and his current character (even though it's still edgy unrealistic anime shit).</br>  <br> soldier Reiner delusions: the post </br>  <br> You can actually almost see some reasoning behind his uprearing and his current character <br>Not really, except you're talking about the fujobait spin offs.</br></br>  <br>How is Ymir any better than the manlet?</br>  <br>Speaking of dwarfism, I bet none of you mongoloids who don't understand that Jean is the best character (etc) have seen Twin Peaks (or if you did, you didn't get it / didn't like it). That's just another of the differences between highly intelligent adults (me) and teenagers who don't read books other than the new "OMGShakespeare!" book series, that's probably really hot with you (google it).</br>  <br>I do everyday</br>   Eren is taller than me <br><br>Should I kill myself?</br></br>  <br>If male, definitely, for Christ's sake.<br><br>If female, depends of how good you look, if below 7/10 then yes.</br></br></br>  <br> always looking for opinion from Erwin or Hanji  <br>That's some real depth there anon</br></br>  <br>I don't worship bland fujobait plebs like Erwin.</br>  Isn't Historia supposed to be modeled after that famous AV actress who's also 4'9"?  <br>Post her pics rite now.</br>  <br>Historia is literally just the design of the MC from his one shot.</br>  <br>I am speechless. I literally am staring at this post with an open mouth.<br><br> a character asking for smartperson's opinion because he's not a smartperson means that the character is dumb <br><br>JUST</br></br></br></br></br>   people replying to that idiot again <br>Really?</br>  <br>Historia looks like your generic wide eyed bmbo.</br>  <br>It's because deep down we realize that "that idiot" is smarter than us and the fact that we can't argue against him properly makes us losers unable to sleep at night.</br>  <br>Anything 170+cm for a girl is giantess-tier</br>  <br>Generic appearance sure but Historia hardly even acts like a bimbo.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> admitting you're that idiot </br>  <br>Indeed, but Islamshit is not capable of rational thinking or good taste so he likes that.</br>  <br> but Historia hardly even acts like a bimbo <br>Yes she does actually.</br></br>  <br>But if she's 8-9-10 she can still live. Some people have a fetish for giantess.</br>  <br><br>Bortfags can't control their borthurt. I wish they would go back to their tumblr hugbox</br></br>  <br>He thinks character development means well written.</br>  <br>He is supposed to be a high ranking officer. Clearly you can just be ass kicking all the time,using the noodle would be beneficial as well something manlet clearly doesn't have</br>  <br>What Jean had barely counts as character development, /snk/ assumes that character development means doing an 180 degree turn in personality.</br>  <br> playing the religion card again <br>Pathetic. This proves that I won.<br><br><br>True, after all we special persons (that is you) know that "well written = what I like!".</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>My bad, she's not an AV actress but a former idol. She's practically famous for being 145cm (4'9") Her name is Mari Yaguchi</br>  <br>As a matter of fact, I have. And I'm going to again later tonight.</br>  <br> he <br>She just admitted she is a Levi fujoshit.</br></br>  <br>I don't know why I was expecting a white girl.</br>  <br>Exactly this. I am a girl.</br>  <br>"bland"</br>  <br>I don't care what it is.</br>  Just watched the trailer.<br><br>I guess Mikasa getting kissed by literally who is just bait for EM fags to watch this shitty movie.<br><br>Majority of nips are EM fags so I guess this shit will sell well at first.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is Erwin not bland?</br>  <br>Using swords now makes a character deep? You learn something new every day.</br>  <br> Majority of nips are EM fags <br>Maybe the normalfags who have never read the manga nor even watched the anime, but the majority of readers are ELFujos.</br></br>  <br>Majority of nips who watch/read snk are fujoshits actually.</br>  <br>Majority of the nips are fujo shippers</br>  <br>If your criteria of being interesting is "badass who cuts shit up", Mikasa and manlet are by all rights the most fascinating characters in this manga.</br>  <br>Never gets old.</br>  <br>Only official fujobait is Levi. The rest is just opinion.</br>  <br>Yes, bland, he's even blander than the manlet.</br>  <br><br><br>Not counting delusional fujoshits of course.</br></br></br>  <br> If your criteria of being interesting is "badass who cuts shit up" <br>That's the only thing Erwinfags ever talk about, of course it is. They don't even know what bland means.</br></br>  <br>That's true, manlet has more going to him than being a strong commander.</br>  <br>Using x words now makes a character bad?<br>Bland is not what Erwin is, maybe your taste is bland.</br></br>  <br>Maybe you should direct that post to yourself, Erwin is bland.</br>  <br> that played Mikasa said she doesn't see EM as romantic. <br><br><br>and later that week she was attacked by a buttmad shipper who tried to shave her head</br></br></br></br>  <br> gets shit done  <br> gives no fucks  <br>A sad sack yes but not bland</br></br></br>  <br>Except that he is, he's just the "badass" commander. The worst thing is that he's also a Gary Stu.</br>  <br>maybe it's because she knows EM doesn't have a chance of happening</br>  <br>You contradicted yourself. You can't give no fucks and be sad at the same time. He's bland compared to the rest of the cast, maybe barring Mikasa. I think even Miksasa has more to her than Erwin even if she's all muh Eren.</br>  <br> He's just  <br>And that's the only thing you can say.</br></br>  <br>Manletfujo pls all manlet has going for him is being STRONK. I was hoping he would be push back into the background like Utgrad but oh no give that dumbass the serum and in our faces once again</br>  <br> You can't give no fucks and be sad at the same time <br> You can't be x and y! <br> What is character depth </br></br></br>  <br>Erwin is the most bland male character in the manga.</br>  <br>He's a badass commander who has done more for the SL than anyone before him. His intelligence is unparalleled by anyone else in the series, and he orchestrated the plan that removed the fake, corrupt government. He has "Humanity's Strongest Soldier" at his beck and call, and everyone - EVERYONE - listens to him, for a reason.<br>He's far from bland.<br><br><br><br>Eren gets a scratch and Mikasa goes BSOD. She can't even compare. Erwin's badassery goes far beyond cutting shit up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing more to say about him.</br>  <br>So he isn't allowed to be a human?</br>  <br>He's right though, Erwin is just a badass and only Historia could beat him is Sueness levels. The difference is that Historia is a complex character and Erwin is not.</br>  <br>I can't be x and not x at the same time, thanks for proving you don't know what you're talking about.<br><br>If being bland is being human then he is.</br></br></br>  Stop h8, post best boy  <br>Everything you said means he's only a badass. You went to great lengths to say something so simple.</br>  <br>Try to make an argument and then we can have a nice discussion. <br><br>bland<br>adj. bland·er, bland·est<br>1. Characterized by a moderate, unperturbed, or tranquil quality, especially:<br>a. Pleasant in manner; smooth: a bland smile.<br>b. Not irritating or stimulating; soothing: a bland diet.<br>c. Exhibiting no personal worry, embarrassment, or concern: told a series of bland lies.<br>2.<br>a. Dull and insipid: a bland little drama.<br>b. Having little or no distinctive flavor: bland cooking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   trying to get character depth  <br> from Isayama  <br>When are you guys going to learn that Isayama is a shitty writer that can't do character development.</br></br>  <br>So Erwinfags are allowed to hate on other characters constantly but when the criticism is placed on him you fags whine.</br>  <br>TELL ME, who is a good mangaka-writer?</br>  <br>I thought we were talking about character depth, not what bland means in general. As a character he's bland, meaning that his traits are more like bullet points than real human traits. Example, strong, serious, determined, that's all.</br>  <br>I don't hate any characters maybe have a dislike for Eren sometimes and Manlet.</br>  <br>And you're sitting there acting like "bland" and "badass" aren't completely opposite words. Have you ever walked out of a theater and said "Wow, that was so badass! I was bored out of my skull!"?</br>  <br>Pls don't hurt his feelings anon</br>  <br>Sorry but it's more than coincidence that every other character gets shat on constantly except for Erwin.</br>  <br>So youre actually going to defend Isayama?</br>  <br>Ok, wise one. Give us an example of "real human traits."</br>  <br>A badass character is bland if being badass takes up 90% of his personality. Yeah he's bland and that doesn't mean he's boring. Although in Erwin's case he is both.</br>  <br>So manlet is badass too yet he gets called bland. What makes Erwin any better? Just because you find him more attractive or some dumb shit like that?</br>  <br>Maybe reacting realistically to his surroundings for a change, instead of staring with a blank expression no matter what happens. The only exception was one panel and then he went back to expressionless.</br>  <br>It's not really coincidence if you think about it. It's quite easy to pick on the ones with the most hardcore fags behind them that would take any and I mean any bait.</br>  <br>Oh we're back to the fingerpointing as always? I never said I'm a manletfag. I think Levi is bland as well, just much less than Erwin. You can see that he's affected by everything that happens to him and doesn't just play everything cool.</br>  <br>No one said you were a manletfag.</br>  <br>There's always an instant reaction when someone says something negative about Erwin, and the place is full of Erwinfags. He's right.</br>  <br>Erwin is the most popular character here.</br>  <br>Erwinfags aren't used to the hate because they're generally the ones doing it.</br>  <br>Strong? He can't beat everyone, he was tortured and lost an arm. He is constantly fighting inside, not sure if what he is doing is the right thing or not. Also, he doesn't try to do anything by himself, he uses people around him if is necessary.<br>Serious: how can be that a trait more than an attitude in the context? Or you want a "funny, crazy-like-me!" Commander doing so awkward things! I bet you thought Pixis giving Eren alcohol was super hilarious and deep.<br>His determination was in risk, and we realised during his chatting with Zacklay and Nile.<br>Erwin knows he is weak and tries to cover it, he knows he is gambling and can screw up any time, knows he depends on other people and just hopes they keep loyal. I can't see where is the bland thing.<br>It's ok if you don't like him, actually I don't think Isayama is that good about characterization, but then I can tell Armin is more bland than Erwin, and pretend is an absolute truth.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They also barely get baited, because most people feel indifferent about him.</br>  <br>I've only cross 2 or 3 of them never a large amount. But saying 'bland' and 'Gary Stu' of course it's going to get a quick reaction. People have been saying this about him for quite some time. But if its his turn for the hate then ok go right ahead every character will be on people shit list eventually</br>  <br>I got a leak for you right here bae<br>*unrars dick*</br></br>  <br>He does react when there's a reaction to be had. We've seen him smile genuinely, and we've seen him creepy-smile. We've seen him be playful and we've seen him screaming orders. He has lots of expressions. But also remember that most of the time we see him, it's in an official capacity. Usually, he's at work, and is doing his job professionally. And when a situation happens around him, it's his job to think it through and come up with the best course of action. He's not expressionless, he just needs to think a lot.</br>  <br>So everyone feels indifferent to just one character as opposed to the rest of the cast?</br>  <br>But at least it just discussion and not  yumir, allahfag, muhEH, shitlet is shit </br>  <br>Because there is no valid reason to hate best boy.</br>  <br>But the Ymir is a allah fag you see Ymir was migrated from the Middle east to the walls. <br>But the walls didn't accept allah fags so Ymir went to the Nordic nations to change her nationality.<br>So they allowed her in the walls.</br></br></br>  <br>Say this one more time and I will end you.<br><br>She is an African godless heathen. Allah does not get worshiped by MtF degenerates.</br></br></br>  <br>But the a story the truth<br>Even Eren Yeager descendants was born and bred during the Holy Roman Empire but when the Titans arised the empire fell.<br>However once the walls were created Eren descendants for told the beginning of Eren future of creating the nazi party.</br></br></br>  Who nuHELM here?  <br>what is that</br>  <br>Me.</br>  <br>Historia × Eren and Levi × Mikasa</br>  <br>I like the old HELM</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>Yes there is. Some of those reasons are what people use to hate Levi.</br>  <br>Why do you like a group of three guys and only one girl (Levi). Make room for the superior HElM.</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I don't like either HELM because I don't like the manlet or Erwong</br>  <br><br>Anything with the shitlet or Eren in it is automatically shit.</br></br>  <br>They still love you.</br>  <br>This.</br>  Aaaaaand<br>dropped<br><br>Kishi just had to go and ruin it, didn't he</br></br></br>  <br>Well, she isn't an edgelord nor is sexually obsessed with one.

They just slip between the bars like the snakes they are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What happened was that Sasuke left with Taka, Sakura followed them and invited herself along like a rude houseguest. She and Karin competed for his affections, Sakura "won" and they fucked. <br> But they've still never, ever kissed. <br>This series keeps finding ew ways to disgust me. I don't even like Sakura but this shit is just horrible.</br></br></br>  I guess entrusting Kabuto with 200 juvenile sharingan clones is slightly less irresponsible than just giving them to Orochimaru.  So this is the only way he could think of reviving the uchiha clan without a huge timeskip and sasuke fucking every girl he sees.<br><br>I'm not too mad about this.</br></br>    <br>right? so many war criminals, getting away scott free</br>  <br> Still jealous for our joy. </br>  <br>meanwhile<br><br> Are you always going to play with Boruto here? <br><br> Yup!!! <br><br> The living room and kitchen.

They're literally "staying together for the kids?" And they haven't even kissed? I don't know about you, but that screams "loveless marriage of duty" to me.<br><br>Best part: 4 pages or so from the end, they've all had dinner together and Sasuke's about to leave the next morning. Sakura and Sarada are seeing him off.<br>Sarada asks if it's going to be a while before she sees him again, and gets a patented Uchiha forehead poke for her trouble and a "til next time".<br>Sakura smiles, then leans forward, blushes and looks up at Sasuke expectantly. Pic related.<br>Now, I've seen that exact look before. That's the "I'm waiting for you to kiss me" look. I've seen it, not recognized it for what it was, and missed my opportunity. Later, I saw it, recognized it, and went for it. It's probably one of the most surest signs she's into you.<br>Sasuke says "well, time to go" and bounces. Sakura looks dejected and thinks "dammit he blew me off again".<br><br>Sasuke fucking anyone is incredibly out of character.<br>So Orochimaru had to revive his clan for him.<br>Sasuke's lazy as fuck.<br><br> If there is actually new material to discuss </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  How can a good character fall so low?<br>Sarada was amazing; now she is negative in a metric scale.<br><br>She was going to be interesting, both in background, what she represented for the story (ie. an uncomfortable truth) and her possible powers (Uchiha+Uzumaki).<br><br>Now she is the status quo, the retarded the didn do nuthing wrong.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was actually the first time we heard Kaguyas voice was it not?</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br>I will miss the edits.</br>  <br>I feel bad for the pink shit now, thats just cruel now</br>   karin saying that she gave the glasses to sarada <br><br>Holy shit, how convenient.<br>This is like, the worst writing of the century.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Kishi's wild ride.</br></br>  <br>That's not even the tip of the shitberg.<br>If all it was was Sakura and Sasuke boning outside the village, Sarada being born in one of Orochimaru's hideouts because fuck it, when labor hits you take what you can get, and Karin was her midwife, then there was literally no reason for anyone not telling her what was up.<br>I mean, even if they didn't know themselves why there were no records, Sakura is the premier konoha healer. There has to be genetic samples of her to match against Sarada.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh? The twists we fun, but by the third time it's fairly obvious that it's all a red herring<br><br>It's like people never got used to Kishi after so many years</br></br></br>  <br> red herring <br>That phrase does not mean what you think it means.<br>A red herring is an answer to a plot question that seems plausible at first glance, but when you look deeper into it, it's full of holes. The real answer is something else that's completely sound.<br>This is the opposite: the supposed answer was completely sound and would have explained everything, and the actual answer explained almost nothing at all.</br></br></br></br>   cuckfags mad all around me   <br>http://naruto.wikia.com/wiki/Naruto<wbr>_Project<br><br>"A "secret" will be revealed on July 29th."<br><br>P.S. Pretty good time to announce the new season.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>So if Sasuke and Sakura are married and Salad is legit their daughter... what was the reason for them not having a single wedding or sasuke with baby salad picture?</br>  <br> A red herring is an answer to a plot question that seems plausible at first glance, but when you look deeper into it, it's full of holes. <br><br>What? A red herring is something that is meant to be misleading from the truth.</br></br></br>  <br>This whole "Adding nonsense words to the end of my sentences as a form of characterization" thing Japan does is really weird</br>  <br>Kind of pointless to say you're dropping seeing as it's just about over.</br>  <br> &gt;Implying Naruto will ever be over <br>Its just like dbz.</br></br>  <br>Kind of pointless to say you're dropping it seeing as it's just about over.</br>  <br> what was the reason for them not having a single wedding or sasuke with baby salad picture <br>Sasuke wet work</br></br>   Boruto Manga announced on July 29 <br> Kishi will oversee project <br> SD writer is now the main author. </br></br>  <br> one of the highest selling manga of all time <br> ending <br>Kishimotos wild ride will never be over. Even if he wanted to, SJ will "convince him" that continuing the story is best. The same thing happened to Toriyama.</br></br></br>  <br>They don't actually love each other. The marriage is for the sake of responsibility and appearance.<br><br>That's exactly what I said. It's misleading because it seems like it's the truth, but it's actually not because it doesn't answer any of the most important questions.<br>A red herring in a murder mystery would be the guy who clearly hated the victim and antagonized him whenever he could, but couldn't possibly be the murderer because 1) the victim was stabbed with a knife until he died and 2) for hours before and after time of death, the asshole suspect was sitting in jail for drunk and disorderly conduct.</br></br></br></br>  Sasuke Karin Sakura threesome?  <br>have you felt it /a/?</br>  <br>If it's not already clear: the lack of birth records for Sarada is a good red herring, because it signals that something is indeed fishy but it's not what you think.<br>The highly suspicious behavior of the doctors is a bad red herring, because they looked like they were harboring some big secret but they actually weren't. It was nothing scandalous at all. A good red herring would have them harboring some big secret that wasn't something you were expecting, like say "sakura and sasuke are your parents, but sakura didn't give birth to you because you came from a test tube".</br></br>  Sageru  <br>I just fucking hope that its over for good</br>  <br> That's exactly what I said. <br><br>No, it isn't. Don't try to twist it. A red herring is something thrown in to intentionally mislead from the truth, not your definition of a plausible answer but riddled with holes. The term is derived from people dragging a fish across a hunting trail to throw dogs off the real scent. It is intentional smoke and mirrors so that readers don't guess the truth. A red herring has nothing to do with actual plausibility. <br><br> Sakura being shady whenever her true parental status is brought up <br> Karin's picture covered up by Sakura's in the family frame <br> Sarada's glasses looking like Karin's <br> The umbilical cord DNA test <br><br>Those are red herrings. The clues are red herrings, not conclusions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, he red herringed the shit out of me. I knew it was too good to be true. That level of writing is above him. He could have just left those two pages out, but noooooooo.</br>  <br>Maybe they didn't want her to go and look for uncle Mengele-maru and his wacky lair of human experimentation</br>  <br>Yes. damn, I expected a ara ara voice but she just sounds like a grandma, disappointed.</br>  I grinned at how cool this was. And then it was just downhill from literally the next page.  <br>The rest are pretty solid, but this first one<br> Sakura being shady whenever her true parental status is brought up <br>There was literally no reason for her to be shady at fucking all. Sakura knew for a fact she was the mother, so why would she be shady about it? Couldn't she have done a DNA test like Suigetsu did? Surely they have such equipment at the hospital she fucking runs.<br><br>They didn't have to tell her she was born in Orochimaru's lair, though. Do you really need to know the exact hospital you were born in? They just needed to say "you were born while your parents were traveling together and there wasn't a hospital nearby".</br></br></br></br></br>  Why the shit are so many Madara fangirls? Every single fucking video with Madara is filled with Madara fangirls soiling their panties. Why?  Sakura was clearly asking for a kiss, Kishi why the fuck didn't you give it after clearing up the Sasuke + Sakura = Sarada bullcrap?  <br>Dammit Bobby.</br>  <br> SD writer is now the main author. <br> the new Naruto manga is primarily comedy and light hearted </br></br>  <br> fangirls for an immensely powerful, evil, callous villain <br>Wow, I never would have guessed.</br></br>  <br><br>MUH EMO DADDY DICK<br><br><br><br>Kishimoto, master of letdowns.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  sasuke should have told sarada "you're my daughter after all" when he saw her sharingan  <br>would watch and enjoy the shit out of it</br>  this cringey trash rag  <br> They didn't have to tell her she was born in Orochimaru's lair <br>Fair point, question is how much about her fathers past does she even know? Maybe people thought that is Sakura wasn't telling her how Sasuke tried to murder everyone half a dozen times that they to should refrain from telling her. <br><br>In reality they didn't tell he so we could have some family drama.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought only power level fanBOYS were obsessed with "Can anyone beat..." Madara.</br>  <br> Last chapter of the fucking epilogue <br> Dropped. <br><br>OP, how do you even...?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That pasta is a joke, Madara is bottom tier in the grand scheme of powerlevels</br>  <br> OP, how do you even...? <br>I don't even have friends to go to bar with.</br></br>  <br>well it was fun while it lasted.</br>  <br> Expecting Kishi to pull through  <br> After the first time </br></br>  <br>Well, you were wrong and dumb. It happens.</br>  I was praying "now please, Kishi, don't give us a final scene where we see Karin that say to Suigetsu it was all a misunderstanding", and this fucker did it.<br><br>Like, holy shit, what the fuck was the point of this "blood doesn't make the family" bullshit ?<br><br>I expected an actual good reason that would tie everything. Like Sasuke DOES end up making the "error" of fucking Karin. Then he discovers his actual wife Sakura can't give birth for reasons. And then Karin somehow gets an illness that kills her at the birth of Sarada, and knowing that she decide to entrust it to Sakura who would understand.<br>Like that, Sarada wouldn't be Sakura's child in blood but it wouldn't mean the latter has been cucked.<br><br><br>What was I expecting, it's fucking Kishi, of course he dropped the balls at the end.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>getting drunk at home is cheaper</br>  <br> Fair point, question is how much about her fathers past does she even know? Maybe people thought that is Sakura wasn't telling her how Sasuke tried to murder everyone half a dozen times that they to should refrain from telling her. <br> In reality they didn't tell he so we could have some family drama. <br>THAT should have been the focus of the Gaiden - Sarada coming to terms with her father's past and her family's legacy. They could explain why Sarada seems so distanced from Sasuke in promotional material for the Boruto movie.<br><br>Women are attracted to power, period.<br>When's the last time you saw a female celebrity marrying someone the tabloids could only describe as a "longtime friend" or "hometown sweetheart"? They have to do it all the time for male celebrities and female nobodies. Fuck, that was the last royal wedding. Kate Middleton was a nobody.<br><br>Yeah but Kaguya isn't a dude, and Hagoromo and Hamura are all old as fuck.<br>And it's not entirely a joke. He was stomping everyone for a year.<br><br> kishimoto <br> sticking to his morals <br>Please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> dropped <br><br>lol see you in the next chapters of the new one</br></br></br>  Is it fine to allow Kabuto to raise an army of impressionable young children?  <br> Like, holy shit, what the fuck was the point of this "blood doesn't make the family" bullshit ? <br>he has a habit of trying to make a point and then contradicting it, <br>like the whole hard work beating talent thing that the story itself actually worked against.</br></br></br>  <br> not being a Madarafag </br>  <br>not only did Orochimaru get away with everything, now Kabuto, too?</br>    <br> he has a habit of trying to make a point and then contradicting it, <br><br>He didn't contradict it though, Sarada decides that Sakura is her mother even while thinking that Karin is her biological mother. <br><br>The epilogue is just there to give the viewer peace of mind</br></br></br></br></br>  Maybe I'm not understanding this correctly but I thought Orochimaru said that the glasses kid WASN'T genetically Sakura and Sasuke's child. Now they canonically fucked once and only once and just happened to have a kid that looks nothing like either of them?<br><br>The final moral of Narto is that having children forces people to become families whether they want to or not? That's pretty shitty.<br><br>What was the point of this epilogue other than to show that there's no punishment for villains in the Nartoverse at all?</br></br></br></br>  Why is Nardo and Sauce even concerning themselves with these pleb issues?<br><br>Their powers are on the level of godhood.<br><br>They should let the new generation solve their own problems, it builds character. If you always step in to help your kids they will never learn for themselves. Let the kids have their own adventures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but that's like the princess marrying the pauper despite all the social and political obstacles in their path, then it turns out the pauper was the long-lost prince after all, so it's all okay.</br>  <br>It's not fun at all</br>  <br>goku was a terrible father but I guess his kids ended up alright</br>  <br>Well, after they dropped charges against the fucking uchiha clan, those two must have barely even been an afterthought.</br>  <br>The fuck? Sarada looks exactly like Sasuke, don't let her having emotions fool you.</br>  So any ideas what Kishi's next work will be?  So why did they give the children who just killed their father to Kabuto out of all people? Shouldn't that guy be in jail?  <br>Any Uchiha on the path of edge is cause for alarm.</br>  <br>fuck off lolbertardian</br>  <br>Well, pretty much the only way to escape Izanami is to basically say you're sorry and repent.<br>And Sasuke isn't in jail either.</br></br>  <br> If you always step in to help your kids they will never learn for themselves. <br>Reminds me of Goku's philosophy during the Cell saga. But yeah, seeing the kids doing the dirty job would have been far more interesting, but hey, it's Kishi, we know he only cares about Nardo and Sauce.</br></br>  <br>Shit writing should be a pretty bad habit for an author...</br>  <br> what the fuck was the point of this "blood doesn't make the family" bullshit ? <br>As long as Salad never finds out it sorta still stands<br>"I consider you my mother even though I know you're not but you actually are"<br>The bond is still the relationship even if they are actually blood related</br></br></br></br>  Come the fuck on kishi, it's so glaringly obvious that Sakura isn't the mother  <br>its not shit if it makes him lots of money</br>  <br>Anon is just fucking retarded and he's saying they never kissed. It's never said in the manga but it's clear they fucked, ao they kissed too</br>  <br> allowing your kids to face their own challenges so they can test their own abilities in a real setting and grow and explore their world instead of helicoptering over them and keeping them from knowing any struggle and making sure they grow up weak, dependent and parochial <br> libertarian <br>If that's what that means, I guess I am one.</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing.<br><br>He announced yesterday he's retiring.<br><br>Probably he'll do a couple of one-shots from time to time.<br><br>But that's it. Anything after the Boruto movie will be regarded as GT-tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yes the conviction is what counts <br><br>It's basically a Frog Prince story, the hurdle the character overcomes turns into a blessing later on</br></br></br>  <br> shit that doesn't make any sense <br> cool </br></br>  <br> clear they fucked, so they kissed too <br> sauce leaves again for 12 more years <br> doesnt even kiss cuckura bye <br><br><br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   watching the new episode <br> new ending is shit <br> the start the gai flashback with filler shit making kakashi seem like a little edgelord <br> next episode filler about shouta gai stalking shouta kakashi <br><br>Why is the studio so incompetent?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was obvious Anon.<br><br>I called it last week: https://archive.moe/a/thread/127186<wbr>861/#127204317</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>they're dragging the shit out of the anime</br>  A lot of mad idiots in this thread who actually though Kishi would make Sasuke cheat on his wife. <br><br>Everyone with a brain knew the entire drama would be a misunderstanding</br></br>  <br> not liking ramen guy <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aAr<wbr>4O_zE8Pw</wbr>  [ ]<br>how can you not like the new ED?</br></br></br>   Sakura got cucked <br><br>anti ss fags blown the fuck out as usual</br></br>  <br>It's not the animation, the song is 1/10</br>  which has worse writing, manga/anime or AAA games?  <br>Then why did Sakura, last chapter, not tell Sarada if they'd kissed or not?<br>Why did she look dejected that she'd even asked?<br>Why does Sakura look expectantly at Sasuke, and then look sad when she's rejected?<br>Why does she think "he blew me off again"?<br><br> It's basically a Frog Prince story, the hurdle the character overcomes turns into a blessing later on <br>Except in a Frog Prince story, the frog explicitly tells the princess "I used to be a prince, but I was cursed by a witch, kiss me and I'll turn back into one".<br>The pauper turning out to be a prince is just a deus ex machina to make everything okay, I mean did you really think we were going to have female royalty marrying male peasantry? Please.<br><br> He announced yesterday he's retiring. <br>Source please<br><br>Yeah, I guess we overestimated Kishi.<br>Misunderstandings are truly the lowest form of drama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She never kissed him. And she never will.</br>  <br>Did they change madara ending?</br>  <br>Yes its this now </br>  <br> All this hindsight bias <br>Is it so wrong that part of me hoped that Kishi just spazzed out so hard on writing that he just went full circle?</br></br>  <br> "I used to be a prince, but I was cursed by a witch, kiss me and I'll turn back into one" <br>The kiss is the key point here not the fact that he turns into a prince. <br><br>The princess has to find her resolve and kiss the frog, the same applies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm actually surprised Kishi is cashing in that much from his work, I would expect him to be bled a lot more dry by his editors and the salary from his staff. So hey, good for him. But I bet that what's making the cash roll in isn't his writing.<br><br>Also, shit remains shit no matter how much it is bought for.</br></br></br>  <br> hindsight bias <br> 100% DNA match on the umbilical cord  <br> hindsight  <br><br>Brush up on your biology</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much everyone was fearing that. Except he then continued by saying "blood isn't the most important", so that means it wouldn't be to troll Sakura but talk about an interesting theme.<br>Kishi proves again he can't even follow his morals.It would be like the rabbit who ends up beating the turtle at the race.</br></br>  <br> FLOW <br> 1/10 <br><br>Also it's an ending with a FLOW song and Takeuchi Ramen dude as POV character.<br><br>Pls kill yourself if you don't like it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The kiss is the key point here not the fact that he turns into a prince. <br> The princess has to find her resolve and kiss the frog, the same applies. <br>Yes, because she's taking a risk on a stated possibility. Either he really is a prince or he is not.<br>In the kind of story I mentioned, the possibility of royalty doesn't actually come up until someone runs in with the heretofore unmentioned birth records.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Also it's an ending with a FLOW song <br>yes and it's complete shit you ducksucking monkey</br></br>  <br>Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck I had completely missed that little detail. Would have bet it was a translation error anyway but fuck that's stupid.</br>  <br> Pic related <br><br>Why of course, he already has his Cashcow, it actually smart of him to back off and enjoy it for once.<br><br>But besides that, after seeing how this gaiden and the movie are in his own words, "the best he can write", then he definitely is doing good if he retires and just makes the occasional one-shot.<br><br>Any long serious work coming out from his ass is doomed by default because of<br>his writing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kishi proves again he can't even follow his morals. <br><br>But he does follow his moral. Sarada makes up her mind and considered Sakura while still thinking that Sakura was not her biological mother. Sarada didn't make up her mind after she learned the truth. <br><br>The epilogue is just there to show that Sasuke is not a cheating asshole. <br><br>If the epilogue did not exist the story unfolds in the same way and Sarada makes the same decision. You are not judging the characters actions from his perspective but from the perspective of an omniscient observer.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kishimoto's Fables<br> rabbit took his nap right next to the finish line, rolled over in his sleep and crossed it - he'd planned for just such an eventuality, suck it tortoise <br> fox was right, those grapes really weren't just sour, they were poisonous <br> country mouse is an inbred hick with diseases, city mouse is educated and healthy </br></br></br></br>  <br>She says "now you'll just make me wait again"<br>It's fucking comedy relief, even the way kishi drew her being depressed. How are you so blind by hate for a fictional character that you don't see that? it's like i'm on fucking tumblr or something. Grow up <br><br>Jesus christ you people just try too hard. LET IT GO, it's over and your cuck meme died already fucking underage fags.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not you fucking retard. Not my problem you have shit ears</br>  <br> The epilogue is just there to show that Sasuke is not a cheating asshole. <br><br>See <br><br>Also.<br>  Sasuke <br>  not an asshole </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being this butthurt about liking your shit song <br>kill yourself</br></br>  The whole gaiden all we got of the best girl is 1 panel. ONE. WHY KISHI. WHY?  <br> Misunderstandings are truly the lowest form of drama. <br><br>Prison School.</br></br></br>  <br><br>There was no 100% anywhere on that page, faggots. All it said was "match".<br>Reminder that humans and chimpanzees are 98% genetically similar, two unrelated humans are 99.9% similar, and a parent and child are 99.99% similar.<br><br>What exactly is she waiting for, anon? What was she expecting by going up to her husband, leaning in, looking up and giving him puppy-dog eyes and blushing?<br>What the fuck could she possibly want other than a kiss?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah Izanami is basically a jutsu that turns you into a good guy. They should have used it on Madara.</br>  <br>kek</br>    <br> Yeah Izanami is basically a jutsu that turns you into a good guy. They should have used it on Madara. <br>More that it makes you do something incredibly out of character, such that you come out of it a truly changed person.<br>If you used it on a good guy, he'd probably have to do something heinous and come out cynical and pessimistic and possibly evil.</br></br></br>  <br>Kishi proves again that fucking retards shouldn't be reading manga.<br>Sarada doesn't know her biological mother is Sakura, Sarada just doesn't give a fuck about Karin and the one she calls mother is the person that was always with her.<br><br>The fact that we know she actually is Sakura's daughter is our point of view only</br></br></br></br>  <br> The fact that we know she actually is Sakura's daughter is our point of view only <br><br>Which doesn't makes the slightest sense. It's retarded and you know it.</br></br></br>  <br>quads confirm<br>marrying because "i guess we have to" with a mostly absent father is totally the way to go<br><br>You'd have to be an idiot to think she didn't ask Sakura for a DNA test.</br></br></br></br>  <br> See pointless shitting on Sakura even making her barren  <br>I see it but I don't care for it, the narrative structure is sound. Sarada gets her arc and makes her choice. <br><br><br> two unrelated humans are 99.9% similar, <br>You don't test the entire human genome you dumb fucker, you test for certain markers, specifically allele length. <br><br>Jesus you are dumb</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fucking kek</br>  <br> He announced yesterday he's retiring. <br>Please gibe link</br></br>  So Sakura never sees sasuke and can't even get a kiss when she does. This is worse than what we assumed after 700. How can SS even like that?  <br>Really wish they expanded more on that jutsu.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br>But Ino got like two pages</br>  <br> Which doesn't makes the slightest sense <br>For the nth time the epilogue is there to show that Sasuke is not a cheating asshole and for viewer peace of mind</br></br>  <br>They're like Sakura and have abysmally low standards on relationships and common logic, so they take what little scraps they get.</br>  <br> Sasuke gets a free pass after all the shit he did <br>lolol shit writing<br> Sasuke does amends for all the shit he did and goes on dangerous missions for Konoha <br>lolol shit writing</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, we don't need that pesky ambiguity</br>  <br> Naruko  of course.</br>  So as of Gaiden:<br> Angel Tier <br>Hinata, Himawari, Karin<br> Redeemable tier: Salad <br> Meh Tier: The rest <br> Pastes her own pic over her friend's, never been kissed and destroys her own house because her daughter reminded her that her husband doesn't love her tier: Sakura </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Except it does you /v/ meme spouter, I don't give a fuck if your cuck maymay was blow out of the water. <br> Things are not the way I want them to be so it' shit!!!!! <br><br><br>The entire point is that she DOESN'T, that's clearly the entire fucking point how retarded are you?<br>Sarada DOESN'T CARE if Pinkshit is not her biological mother. She loves her because she doesn't have the need of blood to consider her a mother.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> angel tier <br> karin <br><br>karin a slut faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh God what's wrong with their face.</br>  <br> your family finally has its first warm reunion in years <br> GOOD FOR YOU, SALAD. WE GO HOME NOW. </br></br>  <br>Tobirama fag here. Madara is still kinda cool  Please forgive me Nidaime-sama </br>  <br> no kids <br> obviously won't have sex with anyone but Sasuke <br> aka virgin <br> slut </br></br></br></br>  <br> no Konan, Temari, Shizune, Madara or Orochimaru <br>I'm a Hinatafag, too, but the girls I listed deserved a spot in Angel tier</br></br>  <br> Sarada DOESN'T CARE if Pinkshit is not her biological mother. She loves her because she doesn't have the need of blood to consider her a mother. <br>It would be a better story if she came to that conclusion and we either a) found out that Sakura really isn't her birth mother but it doesn't matter because love or b) didn't find out either way, but it doesn't matter because love.</br></br>  <br>Well he IS on a mision to save the world against fucking ALIENS</br>  <br>We really don't need marital drama ambiguity</br>   Salad still thinks Sasuke cheated on Sakura <br> he's never around for her <br> treats her mother like she's invisible <br> would obviously prefer to raise Naruto's kid <br><br>dad of the year DOTY 10/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really Sasuke? A sweater vest?</br>  <br>The point still stands. <br>Sarada doesn't know Sakura actually is her mother, only we readers do.<br><br>What you fail to understand is that what matter is Sarada's character, not what the readers know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> didn't find out either way <br>That's exactly what happened though</br></br>  Did the anime show Gai Vs Madara yet?  <br><br>Fucking saved</br></br>  <br>But we needed parental drama ambiguity that ended up being fucking nothing?<br>Why not cut out all of this entirely and have it be about Sarada finding out that Sasuke used to be an internationally wanted criminal and her family is a nightmare?<br><br>Soon</br></br></br></br>  THERE IS LITERALLY NOTHING WRONG IN BEING CUCKED  <br>Me too.<br> Draw a sexy semen demon <br> Give her a granny voice <br>Why is this allowed?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait I just realized<br> Sasuke taps Sakura on the forehead <br> She considers that better than a kiss <br> He then taps Sarada on the forehead and leaves Sakura hanging <br>Isn't that sort of the same as if a father made out with his daughter then left without kissing his wife?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>They showed a little bit today then immediately started a flashback about Gai and his dad. The flashback is good for feels but other than that it was boring.</br></br>  <br>LITTLE SENJU DICKS<br>BIG UCHIHA COCKS</br></br>  <br>So, next episode then?</br>  <br>i fucking lol'd hard</br>  <br><br> The next episode is more flashbacks <br><br>Looks like it, they're creating so much hype for this fight, if it's a letdown I quit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all kisses are romantic <br>Spoken like a true autist. Did your mother never kiss your cheek or forehead, and do you not know about, almost all of Western Europe?</br></br>  wait, if Sakura was pregnant during one of her trips with Sasuke and Sarada was born outside Konoha, how long was she away from Konoha?<br>assuming Naruto is now actually knowledgeable about pregnancies, does this mean he never saw Sakura being pregnant with Sarada, if he also questions Sarada's parent's identities?</br>  <br>You're being dumb, people are simply pointing out the writing is lame and terrible as usual for Naruto.</br>  <br> sexy semen demon with a granny voice </br>  <br>I can't see what could possibly go wrong.</br>  <br>I dropped the anime a long time ago, but for that fight alone, 'm gonna watch it.</br>  <br>I'd actually be fine even if somebody else took over Kishi for a Boruto sequel</br>   entire gaiden is about sarada accepting that her real mother is the one who cares about her, not the one who gave birth to her <br> turns out sakura actually gave birth to her and the whole karin thing was pointless <br><br> entire gaiden sarada cast doubt in sasuke love for sakura, last chapter showed that he really loves her <br> turns out he refused to kiss her when he departed and we are back to point zero <br><br> main villain couldn't stop talking about itachi and akatsuki <br> he decided that the best way to revive both woulld be fighting the two most powerful main the world <br><br>I don't understand.<br>What kind of moral, message or lesson Kishi tried to give in this short story? Everything he says he contradicts shortly after.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Karin said the two of them fucked on the trip, so they were probably away for about a year. Naruto really never did see her pregnant.</br>  <br>But best girl was the MC of the gaiden</br>  <br> not being able to distinguish between character POV and your o <br> I don't understand. <br>Well yeah you are dumb</br></br></br>  <br> Dat Hyuga Vacuum Palm.  <br><br>No guesses to which team I'll be using if I get this game.</br></br></br>  <br> Salad still thinks Sasuke cheated on Sakura <br>She doesn't, the first thing Sakura does is tell her she's her biological mom.</br></br>  <br>He didn't announce shit.<br><br>He said a while ago he's taking a large break and then he'll continue to do manga, maybe a monthly one.<br>I mean I understand the dude, he's been doing it for 18 fucking years now. That's like half his life. <br>He must be fucking tired of Shonen Jump and the editors cockblocking him too</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shits and giggles</br>  <br>And she doesn't believe her but chooses to don't care anout it.<br><br>How much of an IQ do you need to understand a fucking cartoon aimed for 11-17 years old you spastic retard</br></br></br>  <br> gamakichi dropkick <br>I need this</br></br>  So, what was the deal with all the akward faces everytime Sarada asked who her mom was? They acted like her birth was some kind of taboo, but it was nothing at all. They could have just told her "I was there at your birth, Sakura is your mom". Instead we got this cliche misunderstanding story like it's Japanese Frasier.  <br><br>is there anyone in that game playable that could beat uchiha madara?</br></br>  <br>The TL I saw was that Sakura somehow got knocked up from Sasuke and Karin travelled with her to find him before giving birth in oro's cave. Must have been on the road a good 6-8 months looking for Sauce.</br>  <br>Read the damn thread<br/></br>  <br>Or making Sarada a test tube baby. (Yeah, it's a bit more dramatic, but Kishi loves that shit from what I see).<br><br>With both Karin and Sauce having no idea because Oro is Oro then when they discover Sarada, both along with Sakura deciding the kid need an actual family.<br><br>It didn't have to end in "cuckening".</br></br></br></br></br>   tfw we'll never get a Madara flashback in the anime <br> we'll more repeat Obito flashbacks instead </br>  <br>Kaguya</br>  <br>He just wanted to draw his new waifu doing a bunch of cute faces while showing her ass.<br><br>He probably had no idea about what plot to write about so his assistant told him about the retards that were asking him if Sarada was Karin's kid even after seeing her refer to pink as her mom.</br></br></br>  <br>Your ideas make too much SENSE anon. Kishi did what he did to keep the readers on the edge of their seats.</br>  <br>Eight Gates Guy..</br>  <br>Karin.</br>  <br>Yeah but he wanted a SasuSaku ending for the gaiden. That's it</br>  <br>Salad being an Uchiha clone/experiment or test tube babby that Taka rescued from Oro/some other fuck obsessed with the Uchihas and brought back to Konoha would have made a whole lot more sense, and been better storytelling.<br><br>I guess Kishi felt too sorry about making Sakura a kissless virgin though.</br></br></br>  <br>She'd fuck his spicy Uchiha dick off.</br>  I fucking knew it. <br><br>I'm pretty sure Kishi made this gaiden solely to ridicule the retards who thought Sarada was Karin's daughter simply because they both had glasses. The message is that they're as silly as 10 years old kids.</br></br>  <br> dropped <br> at the end last chapter </br></br>  <br>Except Sakura and Sasuke having sex and eventually having a baby is better than that sci-fi movie crap and it's simpler.<br><br>Stop being buttblasted because your cuck thing didn't turn out</br></br></br>  <br>Do you have source?</br>  <br>Everybody knew it. Same for Obito. It's just about HOPING IT'S NOT THIS SHITTY OBVIOUS OUTCOME.</br>  <br>Why is it shitty?<br>Obito being tobi was the most rational thing, Sasuke having a daughter with his WIFE is the most rational thing</br></br>  <br>My thoughts exactly</br>  What are we upset about again? The Gaiden basically proved that Sakura and Sasuke have a broken marriage  <br> wife  <br> hasnt seen her for years <br> most memorable thing is him poking her in the head before leaving <br> didnt even know what his daughter looked like <br> rational </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aw, cheer up, SSfag. You got your...uh. Well. Sasuke had dinner with Sakura. He didn't even stab her once!</br>  <br>No the point being, Sakura thinks getting tapped on the forehead is better than a kiss. Then she watches Sasuke tap Sarada on the forehead and then left her hanging</br>  <br><br>What determines quality writing is what the readers know, and what the readers know that the characters know. Not just what the characters know. If what the readers know is that the whole plot of Gaiden was a pointless drag then whatever Sarada got out of the "lesson" is not the same as what the readers got out of it, which is more important. And kind of the point of writing any story.<br><br>Sarada lives with the fact that biology doesn't matter. Why does that have to change for the reader?</br></br></br></br>    Sarada could have been an Uzumaki, trained by Naruto in Uzumaki techniques.<br><br>She could have been the new Kurama host after Naruto died in a possible arc, continuing the Konoha traditions of Uzumaki hosts.<br><br>Sarada could have been the person to break the genjustu that Sasuke cast over everyone on Konoha, making them see what an asshole he is. The most important being Naruto.<br><br>She could have been the next sucessor for the sage of the six paths, having indra and asura chackras in her, having sharingan and uzumaki power.<br><br>She could have been the female mc of a possible new manga.<br><br>She could have been the most perfect waifu to have graced the shonen lands.<br><br>She could have been to one to finally kill Sasuke, in an oedipian tale. (Also steal his eyes)<br><br>Let us hold a minute of silence, in praise of someone who could have been great but turned out to be Sakura with freaky eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Except Sakura and Sasuke having sex and eventually having a baby is better than that sci-fi movie crap and it's simpler. <br> better than that sci-fi movie crap <br>In just the gaiden alone, we have alternate dimensions and cloning people in test-tubes.</br></br></br>  Overall I liked the story, the absolute best part was seeing Kabuto be the one who runs the orphanage. That got me right in the feels.  <br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA <br><br>No.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura thinks getting tapped on the forehead is better than a kiss. <br>No, she told Sarada that getting tapped on the forehead is better than a kiss.<br>As we all know, parents never lie to their children, for any reason. Especially not because they're insecure.</br></br></br>  <br>son i am disappoint</br>  How can Boruto compete with his father? The only thing that makes naruto strong is Kuruma. He calls Kuruma for every little shit. Imagine naruto trying to face Obito without it, that's Boruto.   implying /u/ didn't happen   <br><br> fuck my life </br></br>  <br> uzumaki genes <br> uchiha genes <br> and kurama <br>FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK<br>But wait, would they need jinchuriki anymore? Now that we know the biju are just misunderstood, what's the need for hosts?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> salad is actually sakura and karin's magic science kid </br>  <br>wut?</br>  <br>Of course he didn't know what she looks like. he's been saving the world for like a decade against NINJA ALIENS.<br> Most memorable thing is him poking her in the head <br>And that makes sense because for Sasuke that's the biggest way of showing <br>Affection, his brother poking his head must be the ONLY happy memory of his childhood.<br> And Sakura likes when he does it too.<br>It's romantic</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So... is Orochimaru a guy?</br>  <br>The only thing better than Sakura being cucked is Sasuke being c/u/cked.</br>  <br><br>Two of the worst characters in anime history getting a happy ending is better than something actually interesting?<br><br>Who let tumblr in here? This thread is gonna 404 quicker than a black Sasuke during a pregnancy test now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He just likes making people uncomfortable<br><br>Orochimaru and Kabuto were the best part of this whole thing</br></br></br>   the NTR dream is dead <br><br>This entire rollercoaster for nothing</br></br>   fake drama so people would read this mini-volume shitshow where NOTHING HAPPENS <br>You'll niggers fell for the most red herring bait for a while. The only consolation is no one here paid for it.</br>  <br>Sage-mode</br>   Chouchou was somehow the best part of the gaiden   <br>I never said it wouldn't be a SasuSaku ending if that happened, though.<br><br>Sasuke and Sakura would still be Husband and Wife and Sakura would still be the mother by merit and Karin and Sakura would still become friends.</br></br></br>  <br> Uzumaki techniques <br>You mean the ones that Naruto doesn't know nor ever cared to figure out?<br><br> killing Sasuke  <br>Naruto spent over 500 chapters being in love with this asshole until the very end and people actually thought that the gaiden was meant to show him in a negative light?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody can kill Naruto, there's not suck a being.<br>Not even Sasuke could do it and damn if he wasn't trying. Naruto kicked his ass without killing him like he wanted too, he changed his mind and he made Sasuke admit total defeat. All that after fighting 2 days straight in a war</br></br>  <br> saving the world <br> wandering round in the woods looking for aliens but not finding anything <br> totally capable of getting in touch with Sakura and Salad despite this but chooses not to bother <br> the forehead poke was only used when Itachi was gently pushing Sasuke away. itachi bringing their foreheads together when he died again meant closeness. pic related </br></br></br></br>  <br> You mean the ones that Naruto doesn't know nor ever cared to figure out? <br>Yeah, we probably will never see Naruto go into the records to find all the Uzumaki moves. That building with the masks was sealed up anyway.</br></br>  <br>Orochimaru can be both</br>  <br>I read it for Salad and to see more of what's been going on with the characters after the time skip. I knew from the beginning of all this shit drama it would end this way.</br>  Sakura doesn't use glasses. Her mother- shown way before shippuden- didn't use glasses.<br>Sasuke doesn't use glassses. No one of his family used.<br><br>Why Sarada use glasses?</br></br></br>  <br>Namikaze genes too strong</br>  <br>Sakura's parents NEVER appeared. Fhat Anime and movie filler</br>  <br><br>We knew all the time the outcome was Sakura was the biomom.<br><br>That we were still kinda hoping he had the guts to do something not predictable for once, well, that's another thing.<br><br>Many people were calling the "MISUNDERSTANDNGS" end by a mile since chapter 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That did oh-so-much during the fight vs Obito. Am I right anon? 2 rasen-shurikens and it's over. Damn bro, much strong, such power. <br><br>Kishi knows this and made Boruto a shitter that won't be Hokage, since just having Sharigan makes you strong.</br></br></br>  <br> Her mother- shown way before shippuden- didn't use glasses <br>We've never seen her parents in the anime, because she doesn't come from an Important Family.<br><br>Either she just happens to need glasses, or they're just a fashion statement.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kishimoto designed Sakura's parents, though<br>they also appeared in springtime manga<br><br><br>my parents dont use glasses, me and my 2 siblings are shortsighted</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kishi liked the idea of having a cute girl with eye powers wearing glasses</br>  <br>Naruto probably knows every Konoha jutsu now anon, he was a beast at 17 years old and he only had time to learn shit. I'm sure he learned his own clan's jutsu, he just doesn't need to do a thing considering that when he gets bored of evil shenanigans he motherfucking glares at people and they piss themselves.</br>  <br> springtime <br> canon <br>Even if he designed them, that doesn't mean they're canon.<br>  he was a beast at 17 years old and he only had time to learn shit. <br>He had 3 years to learn from one of the best ninja in the world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You should have seen this coming. No way Sakura wouldn't turn out to be the true mother in the end, this is a fucking WSJ manga. You're all deluded for thinking Kishimoto would go through with this in the first place.</br>  <br> a year later sasuke returns, feeling ready to try being a dad and husband <br> karin already moved in and stole his girl and kid <br>c/u/cked</br></br></br>  <br>He could have learned it in the timeskip, also by having access to techniques only allowed to hokages.<br><br>I can't believe the nigga never bothered with remnants of the Uzumaki, specially after knowing the suffering of people like Pain.</br></br></br>  <br> hasn't seen his wife and kid in years <br> ignores one and barely touches the other <br> love </br></br></br>    <br>I think Sakura mother appears very early in the manga, when she is leaving her house or something like that.</br>  <br>He's too good for this manga</br>  <br>That just happened because Kurama didn't let him fuse with the toads like he's SUPPOSED TO.<br>With the toads it's fucking unlimited.<br><br>Not that it matters since Naruto has six paths senjutsu too and that's way superior. Boruto can't beat him<br><br>Where do you people come from? Have you read the manga?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>without Kurama's influence, Sage mode have<br>-no interference with Kurama so he can fuse with the toads<br>-infinite Sage-mode<br>-anti-genjutsu as well as having genjutsu experts on his shoulder</br></br></br></br>  <br>change "angel tier" title with "irrelvant tier" and I agree</br>  <br>Did they fucking get Yutaka Nakamura for Naruto?</br>  I think Kishi was a genius. Exposing dumb people with this obvious plot.<br><br>The uneducated as well, with the 100% DNA Match.</br></br>  <br> I think Sakura mother appears very early in the manga, when she is leaving her house or something like that. <br>Nothing like that ever happens. They never appear in the manga, ever. Kishi designed them for anime filler, and said that he'd liked to have had them in the manga but there wasn't room for them</br></br>  I know people have mentioned this before, but don't you think Boruto is going to be pretty weak at the end of the line? If we take as an example Naruto and pretend he had parents and no tailed beast, all he would've gained from his experiences is possesing the ability to use the rasen-shoryuken and sage mode. <br><br>So let's say this Naruto with no beast goes vs. edgelord Sasuke with Eternal Mangekyō Sharingan and Rinnegan, do you think the no tailed beast Naruto would beat him during the final fight in the series?</br></br>  <br>I think the Uzumaki storyline was dropped in favour of ending the manga quickly after the terrible final battle. <br>Kishi made a big deal of pointing that Karin was an Uzumaki and that never went anywhere. Naruto never reclaimed any of his history or met his one remaining blood family member, who bears a striking resemblance to his mother with her red hair, violent temper, chakra chains etc.</br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=v5G<wbr>cGAnBoes</wbr>  [ ]  <br> the uneducated <br>I don't have a fedora picture, but I was tempted to google one just for you</br></br>  So did Sasusaku fags like this ending or where they pissed off with how their OTP was treated?<br>It seemed like Sakura had a pretty rough deal with a husband like Sasuke</br>  <br>Boruto also has the advantage of being related to 2, not 1, illustrious families.</br>  <br> six paths senjutsu <br>You say that as if it's not related with the tailed beast, you fucking idiot.</br></br>  <br> How can Boruto compete with his father? <br>Kishi</br></br>  <br>And he learned from Jiraiya, he was just a kid and couldn't learn every complex jutsu in the world. Also Jiraiya didn't have a large roster he mostly used toads and Naruto can do that easily.<br><br>Naruto was really strong after time-skip, you're wrong in comparing him to Sasuke because sasuke was experimented on by Orochimaru. That's why he was stronger<br><br><br>Only her feet or something like that. We never see her face</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They will never go that far imo. Sasuke vs Naruto in part II will remain the highest level combat in the series.</br>  When did Naruto actually become shit? I mean it was good for a shonen manga up to the timeskip, if you disregard all the filler of course. Then it was good for a while still and then turned into DBZ. Can anyone pinpoint the arc when this happened?  <br>so Hanabi has a troll moveset and a serious moveset just like Tobi?<br>I dig it<br>also Hyuuga are Konoha strongest</br></br></br>  <br>It's because of Ashura you retard.</br>  <br> locking Sharingans <br> Sauce can only do this with Salad </br></br>  <br> Sasuke was experimented on by Orochimaru <br>When is that explicitly stated? Sakura's guess doesn't count.</br></br>  <br>That's the danciest looking shit I've ever seen.<br> no regular ultimate jutsu, just the team <br>That's not complete.<br><br>He didn't learn any jutsu at all. Can you name a specific technique after that he didn't know before?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After Pain/5 Kage Summit. <br><br>When Naruto learned Kurama chakra mode.</br></br></br>  <br> Sarada loves mommy and daddy and is meant to be a combination of the two them <br><br>After all the cuck drama they should be wanking over this</br></br></br>  <br>It started with Naruto vs Pain. Underwhelming giant rasengans spam fight with some bullshit redemption and resurrection.</br>  <br> The uneducated as well, with the 100% DNA Match. <br><br> Sakura is the biomother <br><br> 100% <br><br>Are you sure you are not the uneducated one?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru it's like Naruto version of Slaanesh</br>  <br>The Pain arc. The final War arc was even worse than that level of shitty, too.</br>  <br>I found the 100% DNA match really fishy too, but ended up dismissing it as Kishimoto having no idea how genetics work.</br>  <br>The first. Most arcs and main characters had shit lessons and development.<br><br>It's why everyone memes about the villains, or like a supporting character.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke only got Rinnegan because of Hagoromo Chakra.<br>Sage-mode Naruto with Pa and Ma Toads should be equal to Eternal MS Sasuke</br></br>  <br>He simply made him resistant to poison.</br>  <br><br>It was stated as a match, there were no percentages for the millionth time, stop making shit up to affirm your self-righteous autism. No one is exposed except Kishi for predictable writing.</br></br>  <br>Not the same guy, but I believe Sasuke has that, how will Naruto with no Kuruma beat Sasuke then?</br>   genes <br> genes <br> GENES <br>Is anyone else reminded of MGS1?</br></br></br>  <br>Sasusakus don't believe on the "bonds over blood" moral. For them, all that matter is blood. Kishi knows it and that's why he made Sakura the bio mom.</br>  <br>Tsunade says so. Tsunade is used as an exposition character.<br><br>The training was not about learning complex jutsu, it was about learning how to control Kyubi tails, which he did until the 3rd.<br>He also got better at taijutsu and chakra control in general, also he became more intelligent and matured a bit.<br>He was a kid, no 13 y/o kid learns super complex sealing jutsu and you know it, not when he can't control his damn chakra</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Absolutley false. Naruto was very weak against genjutsus before the bijuu bullshit.</br>  <br>Not the same anon, but I'm going to tell you anyway.<br>You have two parents so your DNA can never be 100% equal to either your mom or your dad separately. It's a mix of both their DNA.<br>Your DNA is only a 100% match of your own.</br></br></br>  <br>Pain arc.<br> introduced CHILD OF DESTINY and destiny &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; hard work message <br> terrible DBZ ass magic power fight <br> Hinata tries to suicide/gets her love confession ignored <br> muh pain <br><br>And then it was all downhill from there. TRaka vs. Killer Bee fight was gr8 but I don't remember where that was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasusakus are furiously schliking right now</br>  I have a question, if Orochimaru did all those experiments to never age and all that shit, why didn't he just ask Tsunade?  <br><br>You should study a bit more, before speaking.<br><br>Suigetsu used something from "Karin", it gave a 100% match. Meaning, he actually tested something from Sarada (the cord) and the test was useless to prove Karin as her mother.<br><br>If it was a lock of hair and the result was around 50%, then it'd have been definitive.<br><br>That Sakura says in the same chapter that a child is half of both parents and you fuckers still fell for it says a lot. You shouldn't be reading this manga, it's too advanced for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her normal moveset doesn't look that goofy. Just a lot of twirling.<br><br>It was kind of the same in the PS2 games except she fell over a lot more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be honest, taking away his tailed beast power, Naruto wasn't much better than Sakura at the start of Part 2</br>  <br>nanomachines when?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zcp<wbr>GIVbPYrI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Sage-senses &gt; Amaterasu<br>ShoulderToads &gt; Genjutsu<br>Sage Clones &gt; Susanoo</br></br></br>  <br>No. <br><br>Genjutsu doesn't work against jinchuuriki if the tailed beast wants to, Kurama wouldn't let Naruto die even if they weren't pals.<br> And even if he wasn't a jinchuuriki the toads would just prevent him being fucked by genjutsu</br></br></br></br>  People, there is no way Sasuke will ever lose to a no beast Naruto. The only reason, which Kishi admitted, Naruto could spar vs. Sasuke was because of it. <br><br>If you're too assblasted and want to quote me, don't, just google what Kishi said, but it's pretty old so good luck.</br></br>  <br>Toads can disrupt Genjutsu as well as deal them since they're connected to the host.<br>On the other hand, I don't think Sasuke can deal with sound base genjutsu since even Pain can't deal with it</br></br>  <br>Naruto learned to control the Kyuubi during the training with B, before it was always a consequence of his anger, Kakshi and Yamato stopped him several times from losing control.</br>  <br><br>I stand corrected.<br><br>I got confused and mistook what he implied by people saying a completely different thing about the percentage.<br><br>But the point I was trying to make was that in the original raw page there was no percentage in the screen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Read <br><br/></br></br>  <br>For a Japanese reader though, Karin having the cord meant either it was hers of she was the mother. It's super personal and symbolises the bond between mother and child. It's really fucking weird for Karin to have it because it should be in Sakura's care, unless she and Sakura are secretly /u/</br>  <br>He learned to put Kyubi under his mercy with B.<br><br>He learned how to get access to it with Jiraiya.</br></br></br>  Basically if you don't have something broken, forbidden, or straight up haxxed. Your worthless in Narutoverse. So Naruto needs Kurama  stop being delusional sir.  <br>False again. Kyuubi didn't shit when Itachi casted the genjutsu to Naruto during the Gaara rescue arc.</br>  <br> Implying Sage clones, Shoulder Toads and Sage-senses can do jack shit against Sasuke's edgy megazord <br>Susanoo was broken as fuck and was the main reason for the manga's descent into power level bullshit.</br></br>  <br>burden of proof goes to you since I'm pretty sure you're either pulling that out of ass or misinformed</br>  <br> It's really fucking weird for Karin to have it <br><br>It's Karin, for fuck's sake. You should be used to it by now.<br>Sarada is half-Sasuke, why wouldn't she keep it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They had three fucking years. Are you telling me it was all Kurama, all the time? Are you telling me that at no time Naruto said "hey, that cool thing you just did, how'd you do that?"<br>And why the fuck did Naruto still not know anything about elemental jutsu? He could have at least learned how they work. Just from memory, we've seen him use fire and earth jutsu. Yeah, it's not Naruto's best affinity, wind, but he could have at least given him a crash course of what it's all about.<br><br>Right after Sasuke v Itachi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Kishi created Karin to give Sasuke a girlfriend just in case he decide to make a narusaku end. Despite Kishi's claims, I seriously doubt he was sure about the endgame couples</br>  <br>Only applies to his Hagoromo version, before that his Susanoo's not even close to Madara's.<br><br>Also Gigantic Sage Rasengans would break his Susanoo</br></br></br>  <br>If Nardo had received Uzumaki training + techniques he might have had a chance without kyuubi, but yep. Next to an Uchiha he'd have been mincemeat.</br>  <br>And he can't it's been proved already when Kabuto fucked him and Itachi and they had to look at each other eyes to release themselves. <br>They're not immune to sound genjutsu, not even Itachi Sue.</br></br>  so, is it shit?  It's  gangsta.   <br>used girl 0/10</br>  <br>nope</br>  <br>Do I need to listen to good rapists like Puff Diddy, Fifty's Scent and Little Wine to truly appreciate this anime?</br>  Chaos Dragon is airing soon. A young boy and young girls are fighting against evil together in a fantasy world. This is very unusual. I've never seen this before in an anime.<br><br>So /a/, how excited are you for the upcoming AOTY, Chaos Dragon?</br></br>  <br>Heh.</br>  Jesus Christ that picture quality.<br><br>Have 0 expectations, hopefully it'll be good.</br></br>  I already want to make some sweet sweet  hand holding  with neko-chan.  <br>Oh come on now, anon. At least troll the show after it airs.<br> Urobutcher best girl. </br></br>   playing the originality card <br>We're talking about anime here, where 90% of all shows are generic as fuck.</br>  <br> A young boy and young girls are fighting against evil together in a fantasy world. <br>But it's not about that, at least the original wasn't.<br><br>It's mostly about a guardian deity going berserker and a group made by people from different countries having to destroy it, each of them with their own agendas and wanting to make the killing blow due to it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like this one better.</br>  <br><br>Next time you should actually read about what the show is about instead of making it up.</br></br>   Chaos Dragon <br><br>Sounds like some shitty mobile game</br></br>  <br><br><br><br> drones defending a shit show before it even airs <br>Will this show have the worst fanbase of the season?</br></br></br></br></br>   two more hours <br>Damn that's actually pretty early.</br>  <br> drones shitting a show without even knowing what it is about and being called on their ignorance <br>I don't know if it will have the worst fanbase, but the bait guys are being incredibly bad already.</br></br>  <br>The only reason to watch this shit at all is Narita character, and hes not even gona appear in first episodes.</br>  <br>The original was called Red Dragon due to the titular dragon being part of the main plot in the tabletop rpg campaign. It was renamed for the multimedia project.</br>   tfw ur DND sessions with ur bros will never be adapted into an anime <br><br>I have such a good character too...</br></br>  <br><br>Fox loli is best girl. If she dies, I'm going to be mad.</br></br>  <br>Lou and Swallow are also pretty fun really. Both three actually knew how to roleplay, unlike Shimadoriru and Kogyoku.</br>  <br>Come on now, anon. No need to be uppity so soon. We can all shit on the show after it airs.<br>Call out the fanbase after it has been established. Shitposting 101.</br></br>  <br>Forgot my pic.</br>   Nasu <br>Picked up.</br>  <br>Wasn't Slayers based off of a D&amp;D session the mangaka played in?</br>  <br>Wouldn't be surprised, DND gives a lot of ideas for games/anime/shows.</br>  What the whole session shown was that "most popular writers" have absolutely no imagination and shallow and predictable self repeating garbage.<br><br>Nasu was being Nasu, Urobutcher was being Butcher. Only Narita actually shown any talent.<br><br>Thanks got it did not have Kamachi and Kawahara. Having Kirito and Touma in this would have made it even more unbearable.<br><br>Should have done Nishio, Narita, Sigsawa and Gotoh.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Main girl voiced by Sawashiro Miyuki <br>I'm in.</br>  <br> Starting soon? <br><br>But the episodes have already been out and it sucked ass</br></br></br>  <br>Narita was actually really predictable too, crazy stuff is his style, and Kaguraba wasn't even that pivotal to the plot outside of him infodumping and telling them his past just because.<br><br>Also, what people wanted was exactly that. Seeing how those authors and the quirks would play in a tabletop rpg campaign.</br></br></br>  <br>People usually want to see them translated and decent quality and without cuts.</br>  <br> Kamachi <br><br>Reading his other works, I find that his non-Index protags remind me more of Hamazura than Touma.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm watching this soley for her.</br>  <br> solely <br>You sure?</br></br>  <br>But she dies in like the first episode so the shota can power up.</br>  Urochan didn't appear in the first ep so I'll skip it  <br>But she does.</br>  <br>I think you meant Record of Lodoss War. Which by the way was about a boy and an (elf)girl fighting evil in a fantasy world. This was very original, I never saw something like it before Lodoss.<br>The fun part is, I can actually say that without the slightest bit of irony<br>Slayers seems way too random for that to be the case</br></br></br>  Is it being subbed by Crunchyroll or Funi?  <br>Lou appears in the first episode anon. Actually, all the caracteres appear.</br>  <br>*characters</br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/dai<wbr>ly-briefs/2015-07-01/funimation-bri<wbr>efly-listed-chaos-dragon-on-site/.8<wbr>9942<br><br>Enjoy your eye cancer.</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  I'll give it the five episode rule, I think. Won't drop it until I see how all the characters bounce off each other.<br><br><br>I think DDY picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>You should do it because she does. They introduce her character in episode 1 and she is seen talking with her sword about what is happening.</br>  Wait, white hair is a boy?  Picked up.   <br>Yes they did.</br>  Can someone post the old and new design comparison  <br>We should make one not just with the main characters but with the NPCs too.</br>  <br>Looking at everything Funi is subbing this season...<br>Yep, I'm definitely going to be watching fan subs for most things I'm watching.<br><br>The heck is CR simulcasting this season?</br></br></br></br>   Chaos Dragon novelization by Sanda (following the anime's version of events) coming out 7/16. <br><br>so that means chaos dragon not gonna follow the WN</br></br>  <br>We already knew that since the announced the anime details.<br><br>It's going to be the same story with changes here and there, and that was basically what the first three episodes were. I would say they changed like 50% of the whole thing.</br></br></br>  So,anywhere I can watch it besides the chink stream ?  Someone mind spoon-feeding me what I'm getting myself into?<br>This is an adaptation of a WN? That doesn't sound too promising.</br>   Nasu+Urobutcher   <br> dies <br>What a waste of a cute loli with good designs.</br></br>  <br>Literally a google away.</br>  <br>I won't go that far to call it a WN, its a TRPG campaign record.</br>  <br>No, it's a re-imagination of a transcription from a tabletop rpg campaign with Narita, Nasu, Urobuchi, Shimadoriru and Izuki Kougyoku.</br>  <br>I think she did not die in the original but she was definitely irrelevant.</br>  <br>It seems neetball does not stream it, so I don't know.</br>  <br><br>Alright then, in case anyone of you didn't know, here is the stream site we watched the pre-air.<br>http://www.douyutv.com/meizhi#</br></br></br>  <br> way too random <br>I dunno, that seems to be par for course for many D&amp;D stories I read about.</br></br>  <br>Neetball will stream it, it's not even start yet.</br>  Is connectcast offline or is it just me?

Always gets a giggle out of me.   CG dragon   <br>That's Swallow, Nasu's character. He has a curse that breaks everything he uses but also triples its power.

Prepare for the shitposting.  <br><br><br>Red Dragon is insane and an asshole, that's what happens.<br><br>It basically forces Ibuki to sacrifice what is important to him to get his power.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Red dragon is a table top rpg like dungeons and dragons which is the show's base.</br>  picked up  <br>Red Dragon is Nil Kamui's guardian deity and it's tied to Ibuki's family (the imperial dynasty basically).</br>  Looks pretty bad.  looks like shit  <br><br>Gotcha, I'm guessing we're going to be seeing more of that silly CG. <br><br>This show looks fun if you don't take it as serious as it presents itself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Average with some parts being above average.</br>  <br>isn't this basically copying that edgy manga with ''hero retribution''?</br>    <br>It's a fantasy show based on a tabletop, you have to take as what it is.

This show is too weird.  I was hoping we'd get a slow season with less shitposting.  </br></br>  Wasn't honestly that interesting yet. When do the entire cast get together? Ah fuck. I didn't want to but I guess I'll give it the three episode rule.  <br>I guess that all the original anime characters will die.<br><br>And  Ulrica too. </br></br></br>  <br>I wonder why they decided to make Kouran all evil here. In the original tabletop they weren't specially evil, at least not more than Donatia. They even weren't invading Nil Kamui.</br>  <br>I wouldn't be too optimistic </br>  <br>Probably next episode.</br>  <br>I prefer traditionally animated red dragon Nakata</br>  <br>[x] rape the maid</br>  <br>Doesn't matter,  the antagonist in Kouran would die out in two episode. </br>  <br>Best girl.</br>  <br>You will never get that with Silver Link. They even made a fucking Pegasus CG.</br>  <br>notNasu and notGen will get their focus on 3rd episode</br>  <br>I guess because Kouran kinda did nothing in the TRPG. I don't remember any actually relevant Kouran character beside Lou and the Holy Mother.</br>  <br>Good taste.<br><br><br><br>The second one had more scenes with them too.</br></br></br></br></br>   expected Record of Red Dragon War <br> got Prism Illiya </br>  <br>that's not EihAss</br>  <br>The firelock girl is form Kouran.</br>  <br>I don't think the show has enough fuel for that. <br>However, I do think it might just have enough fuel for waifu shitflinging threads once anons catch wind of Uro-chan.</br></br>  <br> waifu shitflinging threads <br>That's fine though, since it's all in jest. <br>Most of the shitposting will be in Gangsta &amp; Prison School threads I think.</br></br></br>  Oh fuck me I missed the stream again. I'm not desperate enough to watch the eyecancer rips from the pre-screening yet so I'll just have to ask.<br><br>How was it?</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, I suppose they will use her (and the Holy Mother) as a Kouran character that is not just evil.</br></br>  <br>If I had a nickle for every time I heard that I could fund my own anime.</br>  <br> Okay when are we getting DDY &amp; Funi subs? <br>DDY: @ Air, Funi: They haven't officially announced it and removed the series page from their site.</br></br>  <br>I didn't expected Gansta thread to have that much shitposter. I hope it's just because it's the first anime of the season to air.</br>  <br>No, its because its shit.</br>  <br>Really different from the original, at least about everything concerned with Ibuki, but fun to watch.</br>  <br>Can you name at least one non-shit anime that aired as the first title of whatever season that ended up being surprisingly good?</br>  <br>And probably God eater, since the original game is pretty dark.<br><br><br>Red dragon do nothing wrong.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Very silly, but I had no idea what was going on.<br><br><br>It's because it's bait for 'mature anime for mature people like myself' kind of people. <br><br><br>That looks like it's in production hell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's because it was first show to air</br></br>  <br>Starting now to 2011 shows that aired first in ther seasons (exluding kids shows/shorts):<br>Tsukimonogatari<br>Free!<br>Shinsekai Yori<br>Kingdom<br>Dog Days<br>KoreZom<br>Panty and Stocking</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel like I want to scream out and shitpost how EDGY it all was but you know what? It's like I'm not in the mood. Maybe because I know that it's based on a TRPG that it makes me not take it seriously and just chill out while watching it. Shit feels real fucking peculiar, I tell you.  <br>No, its because manga is shit and anime is inevitably shit too. You have to be /v/ crossboarder ignorant of source wishing for MANIME not to understand such simple truth.</br>  <br>And all of that edgy was added for the anime. Original Ibuki just had spirit powers and that was all.</br>  <br>That's not how it works. Shows that are first to air don't get tons of shitposting by default. <br><br><br>Yeah it looks like a show you shouldn't take seriously in the slightest.<br><br> spirit powers <br>So what happened instead of that sacrifice thing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>nope GATE because /Pol/</br>  <br> So what happened instead of that sacrifice thing? <br>That's all new. In the original, Ibuki, Eiha and the Revolutionary Army tried to talk with the Red Dragon and were almost totally wiped. <br><br>Then Ibuki and Eiha went to Nil Kamui's Parliament and joined with the rest of the party to begin the quest to subdue the Red Dragon.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Just how much happened in the first night anyway? I can only assume that it's all just setting building, character introduction and what not. </br>  <br>Wow they changed a lot.<br>Do you think it's for the better?</br></br>  <br><br>As edgy as it was, it's still much better than Ibuki accidentally made the Red Dragon burns everyone because Ibuki was too scared to speak to the dragon. Shimadoriru (Ibuki's player) got choices but choose not to speak instead, shit was so stupid<br>.</br></br></br>  <br>So that's why I never heard about the sacrifice before. I just assumed that that happened because of PC's mistake or his backstory but I doubt about the latter one.</br>  How was it?<br><br> Was fox-loli everything I was hoping she'd be?</br></br>  <br>Aoharu x Kikanjuu because haters will call it Fujoshit and fans will defend it since its fun.<br>Aquarion Logos - because inevitable shit.<br>Gate - because pol.<br>Ushio no Tora - likely to be THE most trolled show, no contest, since people are not allowed to have fun.<br>Charlotte - 2nd most trolled after UnT.<br>NNB - /u/ cancer will manifest itself there<br>Himouto - MANIME fans will troll this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I heard Ibuki and Eiha's players weren't really that good TTRPGers.

Might get retarded /u/ cancer though. Why would UnT be trolled?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mostly that. It ends when they meet up with Kaguraba and the full party is complete. <br><br><br>I don't really know at this point. The original felt more natural, but maybe it wasn't that interesting and suited for an anime. This is a re-interpretation after all, so changes are to be expected.<br><br><br>I think they did it to make Ibuki relevant since the very beginning and gave him a character arc. In the original, Shimadoriru only started to get good halfway the story. Same with Eiha.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, and by everyone I mean some Revolution army soldiers and Eiha. Eiha revived though.</br>  <br> Oh that makes sense. I guess it's just a matter of making things in the anime a bit more interesting with more action and conflict to start shit off. </br>  <br>Given how Lou, Swallow and Kaguraba seem more or less unchanged (even with Lou genderbending) I thinking that's the case.</br>  <br>The girls aren't even cute.</br>  <br> What the whole session shown was that "most popular writers" have absolutely no imagination and shallow and predictable self repeating garbage. <br><br>Or maybe everyone has their own styles, hmm?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you even serious?</br>    <br>True, I don't think the anime mentioned that Nil Kamui is kinda a special place with magic streams and sometimes people can revive under very specific conditions.</br>  <br> Cute girls + high school + cute hijinks = ¥¥¥ <br>But not many shows with that formula are selling well, m8.</br></br>  <br> They mentioned it in episode 2. </br>  They're really abusing the stills. Granted, I didn't see QUALITY anywhere and that fight at the end looked a little well-animated. Does the animation get better? Pre-screenfags?  <br>The fight against the spider girl in episode 2 was better. The fight against random grunts Swallow also in episode 2 was average.</br>  <br> Swallow <br>Swallow had</br></br>  <br>That's good and all, but there are some titles that air much later than the rest (see KoreZom).

Eiha is 10, Lou is 26 and Swallow is 25.<br><br>And Kaguraba is Unknown.</br></br></br>   all the characters aside from Narita aren't even together yet <br> LOLI IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD <br> GONZO-tier CG <br><br>I bet a lot of people are going to drop this during the first few episodes.

Hilarious.<br>Must have been expecting way too much from the show.</br></br>  <br>rip</br>  <br>FLOP<br>L<br>O<br>P</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's pretty bad right? I kind of expected worse actually. <br><br>Who's funding this?</br></br></br>  <br>Nico nico ratings for you.</br>  <br>The stuff they added weren't very good. I expected the rating to be bad, but not that bad.</br>  <br> pretty bad <br>That's literally drop dead bad. You can't get any worse than that. Actually, you can but it's still pretty fucking bad.<br><br>But it's niconico so who cares?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not bad, it's fucking average. It's like a fucking 50/50.<br><br>But yeah, it's nico nico, nobody cares.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seikasha and sega(?) or whoever fund the smartphone game.</br>  <br>So, Very Good 22,5%, Good 19,5%, Average 29.3%, Bad 15.4% and Very Bad 13.2%?</br>  <br> Implying we have expectation whatsoever. <br>In Eiha/Lou we trust, others are redundant.</br></br>  <br> Look at these wonderful maids here.....Every single one of them makes me picture being called trash..... <br>Is Nasu confirmed M?</br></br>  <br>In Lou I could understand, but literally everyone else in the party is far better than Eiha.</br>  <br>Wow, that's the worse rating I've seen in years.</br>  <br>They are upset they killed a loli.</br>  <br>Pretty much. I never take niconico seriously anyway, you gotta look at the BDs instead.  It won't sell. </br>  <br>Nico ratings are usually very lenient though and are often high.<br><br>But yeah it's nico nico, so it doesn't matter<br><br><br>I wonder what expectations they had for this. <br><br><br> You know if Meryll looked at me with that face in the bottom-right, I can confidently say that I'll stick to all my deadlines <br>Where's my Tsukihime remake &amp; Melty HD Nasu?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So why exactly did they turn a semi serious epic fantasy into teen genderbend protagonists LN like shit?<br><br>Red Dragon seemed somewhat interesting. This however..</br></br>  <br>Can't wait for masked Lou.</br>  <br>They have event tickets, so it will probably sell enough to make the thing borderline profitable. That and serving as an advertisement to the mobile game, being that probably the most important thing.</br>  <br>Don't ask me... I hyped so much upon reading the original campaign. But this show isn't anywhere close.</br>  <br> Nico ratings are usually very lenient though and are often high. <br>It totally depends on what they are expecting. Some of them probably saw Gen Urobuchi and expected the second coming of Christ or something similar.</br></br>  <br>.jpg.jpg</br>  <br><br>It's a bit soon to say. At this point in the campaign literally nothing happened yet.</br></br>  <br>It's pretty surprising since I remember the pre-screening event have a 66% on very good instead.<br><br><br>Meikaku Shit Actors had a real fucking bad rating for that one episode. You know the one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I wonder what expectations they had for this.  <br>Making people to play the game? It's not like we're going to see any second season anyway.</br></br>  <br>Probably because episode 2 and 3 were far better than episode 1.</br>  <br>It was a LN to begin with based off the game and had teen protaganists as well, what are you talking about. It's also still semi-serious.<br><br>Also the original design for the butcher is fucking horrible.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not surprised everybody this is getting lots of mixed reactions.<br>Seems like the kind of series that's slow on the uptake. I mean, it was a really lackluster first episode.</br></br>  <br>Lou is probably still the same age even after being genderbent.</br>  <br> the original design for the butcher is fucking horrible <br>Don't you love yourself some emo scrub ?</br></br>  <br> But yeah it's nico nico, so it doesn't matter <br><br>They usually don't matter since highest ratings don't mean the highest sales, but low ratings usually mean low sale figures. Especially if it's bad ratings from episode 1.<br><br><br>VVV and A.Z finale were way worse.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only teens are Ibuki and Eiha, the rest are in their twenties.<br> <br>Even the loli with dog isn't a loli.</br> </br></br>  <br> A.Z finale <br>Glad I drop it before second season.</br></br>  <br>Did you know that there were people in nipland hailing this as an upcoming masterpiece a month back?<br><br>So yeah, they came in with too high expectations and were left fucked.</br></br></br>  <br>They will probably stabilize in episode 2 and 3 to something similar to the pre-screening.</br>  <br>So they were being idiotic. It doesn't surprise me.</br>  <br>Much like the western fanbase, they probably just saw Urobuchi, Narita and Nasu's name and called it a day. I don't think anybody realized that they were just playing the game and not actually writing a story together.</br>  <br>Probably did as part of the "big name" mentality.<br><br>Most people drop expectations (though not too much) as soon as they find out it's Silver Link, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Still, this is fairly under the radar to most of the western fanbase.</br>  <br> that they were just playing the game and not actually writing a story together <br>This. <br><br>It isn't even that good of a story.<br>The appeal of this is seeing the quirks of each writer shine through their characters and see how they play it out with each other during the duration of the story. Anybody expecting anything else is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That's no excuse. Record of Lodoss War was pretty good story-wise.</br></br>  <br>Ninja slayer had worse</br>  <br>No it wasn't, it was as generic fantasy as you could get. This is more or less the same, actually this has a better and more developed setting than Lodoss ever had.</br>  What do you think happened in the Ireneverse? <br><br>do you think we'll ever see it again?<br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br></br></br>  <br>the final fight of part 5 was for the arrow, GER's just icing on the cake, i know it sucks but i think that's the way araki intended</br>  <br>i know, but i'll make an exception for the boss since it's the closest thing to diagnose him with</br>   127484385 <br>he's always there and is hinted as a main villain but gets properly introduced after diego gets shat on</br>  <br>this one: </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xmA<wbr>DpBu_ZCA</wbr>  [ ]</br>   It's time.   <br><br>She has some god-tier tastes</br></br>  <br>None of them, maybe chuuni for the lulz</br>  <br><br>I wish I could into twitter to check her artworks for good.</br></br>   genki Osaka boy doing bad attempt at being fashionable <br>10/10</br>  <br>Chuuni or twins</br>  See this.
