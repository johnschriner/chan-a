[ What hairstyle is this?  The "girl we all hate, ostensibly, but secretly wanna fuck so hard we dislocate her hips" style.  <br>But we just had this thread.<br>Snake is adorable. And I'm not even a snakefag!</br></br>  Wait a minute those lips...  <br>himecunt</br>  t. semen demon  <br>still shit</br>  <br>Himecut with a lot of gel.</br>  it's not a hime cut, it's missing the step  Shy Slut  Tapeworm dreadlocks  Reminder that the best nadeko doujin will never get translated  Spaghetti.  Nadekoneko.<br>That's fun to say.</br>  <br>the please tear my ass apart hairstyle.</br>    <br>Best girl cut</br>  Perfect.  <br>does that count as ahegao face?</br>  <br>Strips of shedded paper</br>  <br><br>This is accurate</br></br>  <br>I don't hate Nadeko. I love her.</br>  Are there any good Nadeko figures?  <br><br>I concur.</br></br>    <br>Last in line</br>  Also seen here  <br>weird way to start your shit taste thread</br>  Time to fuck  <br><br>Why are you posting worst girl in a Snake thread?</br></br>  <br>A snake thread is by default a worst girl thread. Doll isn't even relevant enough to hold that status.</br>  <br>Popular enough for people to put her somewhere in their rankings of the girls is relevant enough to qualify her for worst girl.</br>   fw she had the only good arc of S2   <br>would fuck until broken/10</br>  <br>I don't think that anon was posting Snake. It looked like Doll to me.<br><br>The real question is why are people posting Snake ironically? Do they not know that if you act like an idiot then idiots will think they are in good company and that will be the only people you attract.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I pretend to like Nadeko? She's best girl and deserves all the love I give her.</br>  <br>So you unironically post Snake? Oh you poor soul.</br>  Snake is worst girl.<br><br>t. knower</br></br>  <br>Only the Nendoroid. The others are shit.</br>  Slut  So...this is a snaekposting thread?  <br>tfw no snek gf</br>  <br>I don't know which one this is, but the Anon who got it said he likes it.</br>  <br>This a snaekposting thread, then.</br>  <br>I want Nadeko to stab me with her fang spear thing while we're making love.</br>  If Snake is worst girl, then how come she a best?  <br>From our previous snaekposting thread we posited the following possibility: is Nadeko actually in love with Tsukihi instead of RRRG? Discuss.</br>  <br>It's the "all this semen makes my hair stuck together in clumps" hairstyle</br>  Snaektlemen, I ask you: which one in your snaektlemanly opinion is better from Nadeko's songs? Renai Circulation or Mousou Express  <br>Although I would like it to be yuri, it really seems like it's just a sisterly love. <br><br>Mousou Express is the best song of all the Monogatari OPs. Circulation is a close second.</br></br></br>  <br>The truth in this simple sentence gave me a raging boner.</br>    The only good thing snake has done is give the Monogatari fans some that they all agree on to hate, and she has given us some of the best OP's     doki doki   <br>But I love Nadeko.</br>  <br>We love Deko. No matter what you say that won't stop being true.</br>  <br><br>Looks like shit.</br></br>  <br>If you really loved her then you would not use such shitty gifs.</br>  <br>What else can you expect from snakeniggers?</br>  <br>I use the best I have.</br>  Nadeko-chan is a good girl.  <br>You're too nice to bully. I won't bully anymore.</br>  <br>Who is this cremaster disaster?</br>  <br>You're so kind, Anon. I bet you're kind enough to be a bland harem protagonist that girls inexplicably like for no other reason.</br>  <br>You're wrong with what I meant. I'm just in a bad mood and I respect your attitude. That's all.</br>  Yankee Nadeko is best Nadeko.  <br>That's fine too.</br>  <br>I'm in a good mood. Here is a nice webm but can you please delete that piece of shit that you linked before please?</br>  <br>Honestly, her and kaiki are the best things about this whole shitty series.<br><br>You could recut it into something actually good and that only takes 12 or so eps by focusing on them.</br></br></br>  <br>Just remove everything except Otorimonogatari and Hitagi End from S2 and you have something pretty good<br><br> Monkey too if you count that as part of S2 </br></br></br>  <br><br>Love her with your dick.</br></br>  <br>Hooooooo boy, hope Karen-chan's sleeping or something.<br>Anyways, more snaek.</br></br>  <br>You think we snakefags don't want to? We know our girl is a teaser by nature so of course we'd pump her full if given a chance.</br>  <br>bacon head, according to Volcano High</br>  <br>I'll save it, but I'm keeping the other one because I like having one with just the kiss.</br>    <br>Haa?</br>  reminder that snakefags ironically understand her character the least of all monogatari fans  <br>H-haaaa...a?</br>    <br>Enlighten us, oh great all-knower. We strive to understand the snake better, every day.</br>  <br>Angry Nadeko is unbelievably sexy.</br>  <br>Omaerra!</br>  Double Snake.  Snake &amp; Crow best pair  <br>Wallpaper double Snake.</br>  <br>You're doing God Nadeko's work, anon.</br>    <br>I just found out that guy did this one too.

Bloody Nadeko turns me on so much.</br>  Snakefags are nothing if not dedicated, I can see.  <br>She's just letting out some stress. Nothing wrong with that, anon.</br>  <br>Snake-eateeeeeeeer.</br>  <br>Anyone have any more Nadeko with Kaiki?</br>  <br>I have this.</br>    <br>You got a wish, anon?</br>  <br>If they understood her they wouldn't be Snakefags.</br>    <br>Why must you hate on poor snake?

That's what I would wish for.</br>    Tsukihi-mode!  <br>Blood despair mode!</br>  <br>kami cut, get it?</br>  P-please be gentle, anon.  Somebody familiar with the LNs answer this for me please: does Nadeko have any more relevance after her Medusa arc, or is she over Araragi now?<br><br>Kaiki's advice, while sensible, felt rather anticlimactic after Nadeko went full yandere over him.</br></br>    <br> She makes an effort to call him Koyomi-san after that, which Tsukihi notices. Bird helps her draw manga gladly as well. </br>  <br>Well, his advice fell on deaf ears until he pulled his trump card.

Else the Death Knight actually looks bearable despite the CG.</br></br>  <br><br>I didn't think the death knight was supposed to be that fucking big. I thought it was going to be slightly larger than the soldier.</br></br>  <br>Well at least the Deathknight is a big guy.</br>  god damn Enri a cute .A CUTE!  <br>I thought executioner full armored Albedo was cuter.</br>  <br>I hear she takes a level in badass later on. Volume 8? Anyone have her stats from there?</br>  <br>Here you go. Not translated though</br>  <br>Still mad she doesnt have big ass towershield on her.</br>  <br>Ge-General? Shes been leveling like mad commanding those goblins.</br>  <br>Right? Like how the hell did he bulk up so suddenly after death?</br>  <br>I always thought the corpse was little more than a catalyst for the Raise Medium Undead spell, not that corpse itself became a death knight.</br>  <br>So we're getting Death Knight and basic new world infodump next.</br>  <br>Which of his 700+ spells is this?</br>  <br><br><br>Farmer lv 1<br>Sergeant lv 1<br>Commander lv 2<br>General lv 2<br><br>I dunno.. it seems agriculture might not be her true calling.. Just a thought</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The LN says the Death Knight is around 230cm tall, which is tall but not fucking gigantic like the one in the anime looks.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah it's big. 230cm tall in the translation. And it generated a foll set of equipment it might as well bulk up the base body.</br>  <br>Ah, that makes sense.</br>  <br>It's not a spell. It's a class special ability.</br>  <br>Well, they got the "It no longer looked human" "It was more like a beast" part right.</br>  <br>X cum y. Basic latin.</br>  <br>From Wiki:<br>  If Death Knight is summoned normally, it will cease to exist after a short time  <br> but if it is summoned in combination with a corpse, the Death Knight seems to become a permanent existence.  <br><br>You're probably right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do we know how many of his spells the author has described yet?</br>  <br>He used a good chunk of them in vol 3.<br>Shark Cyclone a best.</br></br>  <br>And the biggest bonus is that Ainz has that 4/12/20 for his high/mid/low undead summons per day. <br><br>Said limits don't apply if he uses corpses and just mana. Though it's not said anywhere how much his massive mana pool supports per day. 50 low-tiers? 200? 500?<br><br>Thus he needs his corpse supplies and experiments on how strong "base" he can use for low/mid/high tier summons. <br><br>If Sunlight Scriptures fairly experienced mooks allowed the undead to reach ~40 iirc before experiencing, I really doubt human bases in general go higher than low or early mod tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>700 spells from 16 different systems, so I doubt we have seen each of those. He seems to favor certain systems though as he was support in-game.</br>  <br>Was Iguvua one of those tests?</br>  <br>before expiring* thanks brain.</br>  Post the best and your favorite Ainz magic/spell. Use spoiler tags if it's not in the 4 volumes translated so far.<br><br>Personally, I'll go with:<br><br>Best:  [La Shub Niggurath]  I hope he uses it more than once in upcoming volumes even though it's so heinous a spell.<br><br>Favorite: [Falldown].  Shalltear  never saw it coming.<br><br>I like [Grasp Heart] as well. Ainz knows what's up.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most likely, though if I remember right his char sheet, he had a monster base, no? And 41 probably refers to him being 41. test sample.</br>  So do they revive a human later on in the story to serve the tomb? Or are they all so below their level that it wasn't worth it?  <br>He at least used Wail of the Banshee but I was hoping he'd use something more classic like Finger of Death/Power Word: Kill in the early volumes.</br>  <br>Hmm, let's see.<br><br>Best: Are skills included? Because I'd go with  The goal of all life is death <br><br>Favorite: Sharks Cyclone. Sharknado. Hell yeah.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will they make Narberal cute?</br>  <br><br> Forgetting Perfect Warrior <br>Momon would like a word with you.</br></br></br>  <br>The human would have to quite impressive to get his/hers seat in Nazarick.<br><br>Only 2 (up until 9th vol) are there, one has the seat as per Ainz wishes and the one might have to run away from Empire.</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, he can't use magic in that so no.</br>  I hear this shit is based on D&amp;D's system.<br> Are there any muscle wizards? </br>  <br>Doesn't look like they'll be censoring much, if at all.</br>  DO NOT OPEN<br><br>IT MAY CAUSE HEART ATTACK</br></br>  <br>Could be the perspective, but yeah, the DK looks taller than the houses in the background in one of the shots. That's beyond 230cm.<br><br>That being said, every character looks taller in the anime than they really are. Ainz is 177, yet looks massive. Sebas too, at 181,</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people pretend to like Narberal?</br>  <br>New world denizens have "Martial Arts" which matches weeaboo fightan magic in D&amp;D.</br>  <br>Muscle wizards don't really exist in D&amp;D anon, unless you count monks.<br><br>And it's not EXACTLY based on D&amp;D, but there are certain similarities you'll notice. It helps that the "spooky-skeleton-summoning necromancer" archetype was basically invented by D&amp;D.</br></br></br>  <br>Do we have their character cards?</br>  <br>None so far, the strongest attacker NPC "humanoid" for Nazarick is Inner/Outer Ki master and such among being dragonic and monk/martial king. Probably the closest match.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's good. This story needs some real gore in certain parts to get across the mood.<br>I was watching GATE the other day and I found the lack of violence when they invaded Tokyo to be a bit off-putting.<br><br><br> smugpapa.jpg </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Afaik nope.</br>  <br>To be honest, I find it a bit silly in the books when the author basically describes how they're "activating abilities", like it's a fucking MMO. I mean okay if it's a specific magical spell, but a warrior who has learned a certain technique wouldn't refer to it as a "special skill" to be "activated". Perhaps it's just the translation?</br>    <br>They call the melee skills out loud for activation in raws/audio drama too. Not all though like Brain's Field and few others.</br>  <br>Their Martial Arts are fueled by concentration/focus rather than mana. I just assume it's a kiai thing to bolster concentration.</br>  <br>Yes they do. It's a broken build with cancer mage and festering anger.</br>  <br>Do we have the character cards Cocytus and Sebas at least?</br>  What would mean "Create Greater Item" in proper english?  <br>"Create [Greater Item]"</br>  Thanks to that one anon who linked the mega earlier for me. <br><br>I've been reading the LNs and I'm totally hooked, though I'm a bit peeved at how nonchalantly Ainz apparently tortured those knights to death for information. I get it, they weren't good people, and sure, he's a lich now, with limited empathy for his fellow humans, but still it was just bit too quick a transition in my opinion. And while he seems to be aware of the mental changes, he doesn't even mention how it might have been disturbing his previous self. All he thinks is that "damn, shouldn't have killed them so fast :(( might have gotten more info!"<br><br>Perhaps it's more fleshed out later on, but at the moment it feels like a bit too radical a change without being addressed at all. Would have appreciated a torture scene where Ainz rationalizes why it's necessary, to illustrate how he's changing.<br><br><br>That's kind of fine honestly. Standard fare for anime characters to yell the name of their skills outloud, but it was more that in written format, it looked weird how they apparently also call it a "special skill" to be "activated". If I learn a judo throw, I wouldn't ever say that I'm "activating" it, I'm rather performing it. Again, perhaps a translation issue.<br><br><br>Well sure, like I stated above, I don't mind them yelling it out. It's more how it's worded in the LNs.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How about "Create: Great Item"? I feel uneasy with "greater item", is it just me?</br>  Why she are so perfect?  <br>Greater sounds better.</br>  <br>Well they're item tiers so it feels okay to me. Greater being high probably and so on.</br>  <br>No idea man.</br>  <br>it's greater because there's usually a baseline that things are described as greater or lesser than the baseline.</br>  <br>I'm only familiar with 3.5e, is this something new in 4e? <br><br>To be honest, D&amp;D has too many supplements to have a complete overview over every last prestige class combo, but at least with the base classes, it's not very easy to make.<br>(Of course, as a high level wizard you might as well just polymorph into a dragon and "muscle" your way through that way.)<br><br><br>It's a pretty common jargon in RPGs. <br> Minor <br> Lesser <br> Greater <br> Major <br> etc. <br>Take 3.5e's "create greater undead" for example:<br>http://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/SRD:Cr<wbr>eate_Greater_Undead</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But it is in fact a special skill to be activated. It's like magic but for fighters.</br>  <br>No, cancer mage abuse is 3.0 because Book of Vile Darkness is a 3.0 book.</br>  <br><br><br>This bitch is going to be calling forth mongol hordes by the end of the series isn't she?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Oh well, it's just that I can't come up with a good translation in my native language.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Imagine picking up a Greater Ring of Cunning.<br>Now imagine picking up a Great Ring of Cunning.</br></br>  <br>What's untranslatable? Your language doesn't use comparatives?</br>  <br>I love the faces in the anime. It really conveys how deranged some of the characters are. They're almost Hellsing-tier in how exaggerated they are.<br><br><br>Yeah, I guess it's like chi in kung-fu or something. Given the medieval european aesthetic, I think I would have preferred physical skills to be simply stuff you do with your swords though. <br><br><br> Book of Vile Darkness <br>Ah, that would explain it. Still not a base class, and you'd need to get pretty creative with the rules to make it work: There's no baseline "muscle wizard" class in D&amp;D.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  She gets the title of Warlord Enri the Bloody in Volume 9 apparently. The goblins keep calling her "warlord", and the Nazarick member assigned to defend Carne credits Enri with her kills.  </br>  <br>What is your native language? <br><br>Probably not a good idea to translate it anyway, D&amp;D was originally written in english after all. Everything sound really dumb in Norwegian for example.</br></br></br>  <br>See Tome of Battle for where martial arts draws from<br>http://tcdftp.drshnaps.com/Kojiro/T<wbr>ome%20of%20Battle-OEF.pdf</wbr></br></br>  <br>Yep, it's now clear.<br><br><br>Well, "greater" would literally translate into "superior", and saying "superior item" sound awkward.<br><br><br>French, and D&amp;D is properly translated in it but I just can't find a nice match.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As long as you remain logically consistent and any references to lesser would be the equivalent of inferior than that could work?</br>  <br>I'm aware that there is precedent for this kind of thing in D&amp;D, but I still think (relatively) low-level warriors who as far as we know don't have any kind of special training aside from just experience as soldiers, use "physical magic" like this. <br><br>Though it's more about how it's presented. If you've learned how to charge someone, you don't "activate your charge ability", you just charge them. It just sounds a bit silly, like if I were to "activate my [open door] ability" every time I'm opening a door.</br></br></br>  My sides are forever lost.<br><br>How can papa bones be so based, holy shit?</br></br>  <br> D&amp;D is properly translated in it <br>Then what is for example the spell "create greater undead" called in french? You could probably look that up.<br><br> saying "superior item" sound awkward <br>I don't think so. It simply means that it's an item of superior quality. (Superior to a common, or baseline item.)</br></br></br></br></br>  Is there any info on how big the world is? Like how many continents and general geography?<br>Or are we riding the back of four elephants here?</br>  <br>The part where he was so disappointed about Hamsuke only for his companions to be the complete opposite always makes me laugh no matter how many times I reread it. It's like he can't comprehend how anyone can be so impressed.</br>  <br>There was a map in volume 9. Let me see if I can find it.</br>  <br>His internal thoughts are fucking hilarious.<br><br>Bit annoyed at the formatting for dialogue though. The first fucking rule is to have a new line per speaker, yet here it's all just cluttered together in the same paragraph. Makes it hard to read.<br><br> "yeah, this is fucking retarded" "oh i totally agree man" "...how can we even read this properly" "who is even speaking now?" "i can't follow this at all..." "is this the same sentence??" <br><br>It doesn't help that the author is fond of ellipses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>this pleases me<br><br>Also, if you're interested in an Overlord themed Pathfinder game, add me on skype. We currently have a DM and 3 players. dien.zora</br></br></br>   Papa Bones emerging from the portal <br><br>spooked</br></br>  <br>I fucking hate it sometimes when they just refuse to write proper speaker attribution in the narrative and just shit out lines of dialogue.</br>  <br>Based on the setting, or the actual characters as well? Or just similar in theme perhaps?</br>  <br>ayy lmao</br>  <br>It's surreal when a character has a randomly generated name you've been using for years but I don't think I'm ever going to live this down the next time I login if this shows up in the anime.</br>  <br>Yeah, but it would have worked out alright if they AT LEAST would make line breaks for each new speaker.<br><br>I suspect it's just the translation though. Perhaps moon runes have different rules.</br></br></br>  <br>Kajit is pretty common though.</br>  <br>That could work, yes, but in the case of the anime, hearing "Create Greater Item" and reading something like "Create: High Quality Item" would somehow break the 3-words flow.<br><br><br>It's translated into "Create Dominant/Dominating Undead".<br>Using "dominant" here make sense but a "dominant item" that's a no-no.<br>At least in French it does sound awkward. We don't use this word like that, the only exception I know is WoW translating "Greater Bounty Spoils" into "Superior Spoil".</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently(My first few weeeks were nonstop morrowmind jokes while i wondered wtf was going on) but I did that without realizing they exist so every time I see them talking to Khajit in the book my brain gets paranoid on if everything is going meta.</br>  <br>so when it comes to making an heir he'll cast Create Greater Penis?</br>  Ainz-samaaa  <br> lamprey <br><br>NOPE NOPE NOPE</br></br></br>  <br> Using "dominant" here make sense <br>Eh, I dunno about that. Perhaps it works in french, but in english "dominate" really isn't a good word. The undead isn't "dominating" anything, and being "dominating" is hardly a good way to describe quality, unless it's fucking unreal tournament player.<br><br>Anyway, I suggest you stop translating english into frog, nothing good can come of it. :^)  Seriously though, anything is better in the original language it was created for, from poems and tabletop games to anime and movies. I play VtM with some friends and we speak english and use english terms in-game instead of norwegian. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but he'd probably need to cast Create Greater Semen, too.</br>   clementine's face <br><br>I fucking hope they animate that tongue.</br></br>  <br>f-for you</br>  Just finished reading vol 6. Why is she and the unnamed rogue the best characters?  <br> Just finished reading vol 6. <br>oy, volume 6 isn't TLd yet and we would appreciate it if you kept that shit in spoilers.</br></br>   Read volume 4 <br> All that backstory for the lizardmen  <br> Prepared for maximum despair to the nth degree <br> In the end it all works out for everyone and even individually you get a happy ending for almost everyone <br><br>Can't say I don't feel cheated</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She really is a cute  chuuni .</br>  <br>Let's discuss what Albedo's "true shape" is.<br>Apparently a lot of people assume it's a gorilla, simply because of Shalltear's insult, but I don't think that necessarily follows. Just because Albedo used an accurate insult (a lamprey) doesn't mean that Shalltear would do the same. Consider that Albedo is a grown woman while Shalltear is just a little loli. From Shalltear's perspective, all adults are kinda like overgrown apes, right?<br><br>Given that Albedo is most certainly a "semen demon"/succubus/imp, I'd actually argue that she doesn't possess a different form at all. She clearly has horns and wings, which can't be disguised. (The excuse used by Ainz to not bring her along to the city.) Her "battle form" is clearly just having armor on, which would be cumbersome if her "final form" was radically different in shape or size.<br><br>Finally, yes Demiurge has shown his ability to turn into a weird frog-bat hybrid, and he's also of the imp race, but that might be just a regular shapeshift ability, not something specific to his race. I very much doubt Albedo will turn into an ugly frog-bat at any rate.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really hope Clementine gets reanimated as a Wight in service of Ainz Ooul Gown. I mean, they have her corpse.</br>  <br>You have to consider it from the viewpoint of how author uses focus/concentration.<br><br>Sure you can swing your sword and do charges and what not, slashes and all that but the 'martiall magic' they use allosws them to boost these actions with focus/concentration.<br><br>Same how Fortress, X-fold Slash of Light, God Slash, Vertical Slash are basic moves in sense but expending their focus/concentration (instead of mana like in the game) allows them to break their limits set to them by tgeir bodies/gear.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is her at maximum power</br>  <br>Not that happy.<br>Dozens of lizardmen were killed.<br>Only named lizardmen who survived were Zaryuusu and his albino bitch.</br></br></br>   “Narberal Gamma! Display the power of Nazarick!” <br><br>Holy shit, I have never felt this good while reading something. My imagination hasn't been this active since I was a kid.<br><br>This line sent a fucking chill down my spine.<br><br>I'm fucking glad I picked this up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not a very good succubus if you turn ugly as fuck</br>  <br>She's also going to become potionmaker's grandson's lover after the battle.</br>  <br>Sure, but that's intangible. EVERY action requires a certain amount of concentration, so there's no real qualitative difference to the naked eye. I just don't see how these characters know so much about exactly where the line is drawn between regular moves and "special skills".</br>  those Hellsing faces are really lovely  <br> no boobs <br>FAKE AND GAY</br></br>  <br>I honestly doubt Albedo is a succubutt<br><br>I mean she looks like one and is a slut but that's just from gap moe, her true form is likely a big buff demon considering she's a tank and the guild liked minmaxing the hell out of their npcs</br></br></br>  <br> She will never love you, want to serve you, and be yours for anything you could possibly ask </br>  A little sooner than usual but,<br>Obligatory kinniku pic</br>  So, to level up, is it necessary to kill an enemy or is training the skill enough?  <br>Well exactly, which is why I think she doesn't actually transform. Not all heteromorphic races need to be shapeshifters after all.<br><br>I guess Shalltear's "true vampire" race is what makes her all lamprey-like, while "regular" vampires are non-lampreys.</br></br></br>  <br>Zaryuusu intended from day one to thin out the lizardmen numbers and even the most bleeding heart of them all Lulu was on board with that plan.<br><br>So I can honestly not think of any negative thing done to the lizardmen from their point of view outside of the chiefs dying.<br><br>They united and bonded in a way never before, they are now able to grow as a people incorporating all their various "advancements" and now have the support of the single greatest super power on the planet, they've thinned their numbers, and they are totally down with subjugation as far as I can tell since they like the idea of the strong taking over.<br><br>Yeah a bunch of warriors died but it was a relatively minor thing and even in the final battle with Cocytus the only lizardmen who died were the chiefs and the old guard who wanted a last hurrah anyway.<br><br>Fuck even Ainz said he'd revive the only other two lizardmen of importance if he felt like it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're the first one to actually say it's hard to follow. The " space " has been enough for myself at least. The original japanese has every single line as paragraph and 1.5cm space between every line. Even if it's just 2-5 words. <br><br>Nobody writes English like that. Though I agree there should be line break between dialogue but it's not hard in the end. Individual differences may vary.<br><br>Are you a speedreader by chance? I used to so that and it would cause me to clear 100-200 pages in hour without problems but as such small details never stuck to memory completely.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Dominant" at least in this context and in french it fits well, the meaning of it wouldn't be "dominating" but "powerful".<br><br> anything is better in the original language it was created for <br>Yeah but I believe that in france, most of our D&amp;D players play in french.<br>Also I don't really like letting some untranslated words here and there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad it's not worthy of the phrase display the power of Nazarick.<br><br>She put on her maid gear and one shot the dragons with relatively boring magic after teleporting around for a little bit.<br><br>I was expecting her to turn into a fucking monster and then nuke them the first time I read it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> her true form is likely a big buff demon considering she's a tank <br>Nigga, do you even inverse ninja theory/plate bikini? Less is more in animu and vidya gaems.</br></br>  <br>Mm, I just imagine the tangibility from how their actions break laws/limits set to them.</br>  <br>No homo, but both Demiurge and Mare are sexy as fuck.</br>  <br>It's never mentioned. It's assumed it's XP based, so however they got xp.</br>  <br>Both are apparently needed in the New world.</br>   Gorilla is constantly being too lewd and yells at everyone <br> Demi fucking lies to Ainz all the time and is a sneaky little shit <br> Chair is a dumb fuck up who has to be killed on her FIRST mission <br> Bug cannot think for himself <br><br>MEANWHILE<br><br> Mare and Aura always get shit done regardless of how hard or how much grunt work they have to do <br> Victim takes one for the team <br> Gargantua threw that rock pretty good that one time <br><br>You people forget who the competent guardians are</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well she has atleast 20 levels in racial levels other than imp, thats 10 more than someone like Shalltear with full Lamprey bloodlust mode. Like most Heteromorphic races she most definately has a demon form that is most likely large and ugly (considering Tabula-sans tastes). For now we can only take Shalltears word from it if it really is Gorilla.</br>  <br>She has only 1 level in racials so sadly no transformations for her other than changing her face and humanoid shape.</br>  <br>Dont forget our hero and savior Sebas-san.</br>  Is volume 4 all about those lizardmen? Somehow i don't give a fuck about them and just wanted to read more about main characters. It feels like some kind of side story.  <br>Well, finally. Someone else could see that even though Nazarick made the first move, things ended up way better than the Lizardmen could hope for. Plus Ainz gets his Lizard army, Cocytus gets to learn to think for himself and the Lizardmen are safer than most people in the New World. It was a win-win situation for almost all involved.</br>  <br> Though there was the occasional woman who would brazenly send him a sultry gaze to his face, Sebas paid them no mind.  <br> With an upright back and steady eyes directed straight ahead, his feet did not falter for even a moment. <br><br>Ball'n Sebas.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry but thats what LNs are going to.<br>They focus on some 3rd party before they get curb-stomped by Ainz&amp;company.</br></br>  <br>None can stop the dragon swag.</br>  <br>You mean later novels are like that too?</br>  <br> You're the first one to actually say it's hard to follow. <br>I don't doubt it, but that doesn't mean it hasn't been annoying for people.<br><br> I agree there should be line break between dialogue <br>Yes, that is the standard way of doing things. I have no idea why the translators didn't just make a single line break, even for themselves.<br><br> it's not hard in the end <br>It works, but there's exactly ZERO reasons not to have line breaks and it's just annoying when you're trying to following a conversation and suddenly you're unsure who's saying what. This is even worse since, like anon said above, the author very seldom notes speaker attribution. Especially in situations with more than 2 characters present, it makes things confusing.<br><br> Are you a speedreader by chance? <br>Not sure what you mean. Do I read fast? I dunno, it's all relative. The bad formatting certainly slows things down though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's where Victim and Gargantua first show up, Cocytus also does things.<br><br> Shalltear is used as a chair.<br> Just like the boss of an evil organization stroking a cat on his lap, Ainz patted the head of Shalltear who was acting as a chair as he said “It’s not me”. <br/></br> </br></br></br>  <br>Dunno.<br>First chapter of volume 5 is completely focused on some faggot from Kingdom.</br></br>  <br>Her expression does things to my penis who be this semen demon?</br>  <br>None focus almost exclusively on the Lizardmen like volume 4 does. Mostly, it's introduction to this character. We get to see what makes them tick. Their motivation. Then we get to see how and they die.</br>  <br> who be this semen demon <br>Just some random hug pillow.</br></br>  <br>The point is that they have no way of knowing exactly what those limits are. I don't have a problem with them going "oooh momon-san is INHUMANLY strong!", because it's just an expression, but realistically, there's no way for these mooks to know where the line is drawn exactly, hence they can't differentiate between "limit-break" moves and regular moves. It would be more of a sliding scale.</br>   At the same time, he said quietly to Clementine: “I forgot to tell you… I am very stubborn.” <br><br>This fucking guy.</br></br>  <br>Meant for <br><br>Volumes 5 and 6 or so involve Sebas and a certain character. There's also Kingdom, Momon, Ainz, Demiurge, Pleiades and Adventurer action.<br><br>Volume 7 deals with the Empire and Nazarick is invaded.<br><br>Volume 8 focuses on Carne Village and Nfirea and stuff.<br><br>Volume 9 picks up from where volume 7 ended.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mm so far the author has never used to spoken sentences to be from the same speaker in chain, iirc at least.<br><br>So it's always either one guys spoken lines being paused by narration, internal thought or actual speaker change with "ainz" "demi" or "ainz" narration "ainz".<br><br>And no, raws rarely give you idea who is speaking with: And do Ainz shouted: "Boo!". You just have to read it from context.<br><br>And only few characters have speech quirks in the original language as laid out by dialect or by the use of sentence finishers like ~ssu, arinsu and so on. <br><br>Only Shalltear and Hamsuke and Uncle Cocytus come to mind. And these are even harder to emulate in proper English.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Clementine, she's a hug addict</br>  <br> constantly being too lewd <br>No such thing, anon</br></br>  <br>oh boy, you'll be hyped with all the other swag shit papa bones will do.</br>  <br>How big a hug addict are we talking about?</br>  <br> most Heteromorphic races has a demon form that is most likely large and ugly <br>What do you base this on?</br></br>  <br><br> Spine-crackingly addicted. </br></br>  <br>She would die for some tight hug.</br>  <br>  Papa Bones accepts one of his children's girlfriend. <br>  Criminal organization kidnaps girlfriend. <br>  The might of Nazarick is unleashed. </br></br></br>  <br> author very seldom notes speaker attribution <br>This is really just a problem with translating from Japanese to English.<br><br>For example, Cocyutus in japanese speaks completely in Katakana, Shaltear speaks with a weird dialect I believe was used by courtesans, and so on.<br><br>Translating the character's dialogue into English usually means having to ignore characteristics like dialect, the choice of first person pronoun, and so forth.<br><br>tl;dr in Japanese it's easy to understand who's saying what, blame translations</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the author has never used to spoken sentences to be from the same speaker in chain <br>It's still fucking messy. Do you enjoy a billion quotation marks in a single paragraph? Two quotation marks with nothing but a space in between is awful form.<br><br>I don't even mind speaker attribution that much, but line breaks? Come on, that's pretty fucking basic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> dialect I believe was used by courtesans <br>You mean best girls.</br></br>  <br>so far the discussion has been :<br><br> Players are the Supreme Beings <br> We design our Nazarick <br> Dm plops us in a world we can't meta game <br> ???? <br> Conquest <br><br>Sorry I took forever to respond., I had to leave and do things.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   hate rreading on my computer <br> want to print the LNs  <br> broke as fuck </br></br>  <br>Yet something that would make such things more easily digestible is  FUCKING LINE BREAKS FOR DIALOGUE, GOD DAMN </br>  How many LNs are translated so far and where can I find them?  <br>Wasn't Overlord translated from Jap to Chinese to English?</br>  <br>Up to book 5<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!61NGTRRK!F2aC<wbr>e8c5r6cCfr3Wer4TaA</wbr></br></br>   That feel when no Papa Bones and Uncle Cocytus to take care of you    book 5 only has 54 pages <br>w-what</br>  <br>v1 m8 not yet fully translated.</br>  <br>Thanks, man.</br>   But when do they blow up the moon?

Was it too slow-paced? Did you dislike the characters?<br><br> why didn't you like it? <br> because I didn't enjoy it :B </br></br></br></br>  pls post flying skeleton  <br>It sure is slow paced, but I don't necessarily mind that, I read other detail heavy stuff.<br><br>Maybe my expectations for it was a bit betrayed?<br>Thought I am gonna read something over some evil Overlord taking over the world, crushing heros and stuff.<br>But is actually some fag acting superior, pretending to not give a shit about humans but still saves some and so on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thought I am gonna read something over some evil Overlord taking over the world, crushing heros and stuff. <br>That's your problem, I guess. Ainz isn't some villain going around killing humans indiscriminately. He has a purpose and he's very methodological about it and only really kills people if they get in his way. In that sense, he isn't a purely "evil" character who kills for the lulz.<br><br> But is actually some fag acting superior, pretending to not give a shit about humans but still saves some and so on. <br>But he really doesn't give much of a shit about humans. He only helps them when he can benefit from it in some way. What, you wanted him to kill all humans without reason? Him saving some doesn't mean he's still human mentally. He's not a hero but he's also not an uncontrollable pychopath either,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Thought I am gonna read something over some evil Overlord taking over the world, crushing heros and stuff. <br>But he is taking over the world,  one village at a time.

From behind those sounds there was also the sound made by someone walking in high-heels. "<br><br>He makes foot noises</br></br></br>  When's this guy going to stop acting like a faggot and act like the Skull King he looks like?<br><br>Appoint a headwife, and mistress.<br>Bear a heir to the throne<br>Raise your flags<br>Rally your forces<br>Lay waste to the surrounding area in an orgy of blood and conquest.<br>Wait inside your tower for the yuusha to come.<br><br>Holy fuck,it's this limp dick has no ambitions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See <br><br>Reality bending legs. Or maybe sanity eroding?</br></br></br>  <br>wat, that was albedo right.</br>  <br>Or would it be a feature of his Divine class robe set? ie it hides his waist and legs from view. All kinds of cosmetic things and effects were possible with enough high-grade data crystals.</br>  <br>Did they mention the legs being invisible? I thought they felt disturbed simply because he was sitting on some slut</br>  <br>No, he mention shoes and staff sounds, followed by high-heels sounds. No need to say it twice if it was the case</br>  <br>What is Mare going to do with that toothbrush?</br>  <br>But he does have legs though, we see them when he wears the armor.</br>  <br>His main objectives are finding his friends, protecting Nazarick, and protecting his "children", not world domination. If they weren't his responsibility he'd be out adventuring probably.</br>  <br>Because running a country is tedious as fuck and he's not into "hurrdurr we evil now" nonsense like how you want him to be.</br>  <br>those are basically computers aswell</br>  <br><br> Skull king <br> Employs demons <br> Name of the anime is overlord <br><br>So this anime isn't about a dud finding out he's lvl 100 in a game-that's-real and decides to lay waste in an orgy of blood and conquest?<br><br>THEN WHAT IS THE POINT. FUcking red herrings, making me waste time when I could be rewatching something beter.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He gets nothing from ruling a country so he's not going to bother doing it, unless he gets something out of it he's not gonna do it, that's just how he works, that and he's paranoid as fuck.</br>  <br>I understood the meaning but I'm still an idiot so I couldn't help but laugh when I read that.<br><br>Funny, cause we all know Mare is the real cum ranger.</br></br></br>  <br>witness our bloody warlord</br>  <br>He does do evil skellington things, he's just not being stupid about it because he thinks there could be other lvl100 players and transplanted raid bosses that would slap his RP build silly.</br>  <br>She needs some warpaint on that face.</br>  <br> making foot noises without legs <br>Spooky</br></br>  <br>See <br>and<br><br><br>You might as well drop it. I don't think it'll be what you expected.</br></br></br></br></br>  So in the raws, is there any mention of lizardmen after their battle?  <br>Few mentions and so on but not a full-fledged chapter (this is 5-8 mind you).</br>  <br>A head is more than enough</br>    chapter 8 when  <br> She </br>  <br>are the 5000 goblins permanent?</br>  <br>Hopefully not, otherwise food logistics are going to be tough.</br>  <br>Probably. I feel bad for the guy that has a crush on her.</br>  <br>She need to please every of them ?</br>  <br>He must feel pretty damn useless.</br>  <br> &gt;Gargantua threw that rock pretty good that one time <br><br>Best Guardian hands down.<br>Second best level 100 after Sebas-tan.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Demi fucking lies to Ainz all the time and is a sneaky little shit <br> No. He actually think Ainz is aware of what he is doing, since there is no way he could fool a Supreme Being.<br> Ainz thinking that he actually knows what Demiurge is doing makes the situation even worse.</br></br></br>        <br>I'd agree that the bipedal sheep thing is a mistake on both their parts but he's straight up just fucking lying about the bone throne. <br><br>There's no way you can interpret that as playful teasing or a jest.</br></br></br>   Waiting for Momonga to land, Mare hurriedly ran over. His skirt fluttering in the wind. A little bit could be seen. No, Momonga totally did not want to see, he was just curious about what was worn underneath. <br><br>It's the small details like these and the Shalltear carpet inspection thought that makes re-reading the volumes so amusing.</br></br>  <br> When did he lie about it? He made a joke thinking Ainz would get it, which both of them thought he did and that was it.</br>  <br> blaming a Succubus for being Lewd <br>that's like complaining that the sky is blue or that water is wet.</br></br>  <br>Blue is a shit-tier color though. And water would be way more enjoyable if i didn't have to dry stuff off all the time.</br>   Ganging up on one skelly. <br>What kind of monsters do this?</br>  <br>Wait, did they just reuse the random scrubs from the opening scene of Episode 1?</br>  <br>Ainz really looked like a normal skelly before and then turned into what we know and love today.</br>  <br>Humans, they need to be put on a leash.</br>  <br> Why are they using the same guys who attacked Nazarick during the anime-original scene at the beginning of Ep 1?<br> Were those niggers really that salty about not killing Ainz that one time?</br></br>  <br>Clearly they were still mad at Touch Me all that time later</br>  <br><br>It might be the same guys.<br>In the time Ainz joined and be came leader of a guild they never bothered to upgrade their equipment.</br></br></br>  <br> Well, they were stupid enough to attack the most difficult dungeon in the game with just FIVE faggots, so it wouldn't be weird for them to do that too.</br>  <br>he Started as a Skeleton mage and ranked up a couple of times until he became the Overlord he is today</br>  Where would you choose to live in the New World, if you had a choice?<br>The Kingdom, the Empire or the Slane Theocracy.</br>  <br> Theocracy since they are actually competent and have all the cool shit.</br>  <br>LN bounces a lot around time. It's possible they were trying to do the same thing here, but just didn't indicate it at all, so the viewer gets the impression that the opening scene happens before the rest of the show.</br>  <br>Don't you have to a member of their cult that worships the Six Gods or something. I don't want to worship no Six Gods or nothing.</br>  Tfw won't wake up tomorrow as a Dorf Paladin, sailing on a boat to Northrend with my guild;_;  <br>Considering players in Yggdrasil could customize anything, they probably liked their armor's aesthetics enough that they upgraded the stats but maintained the same appearance.</br>  So in this game your guild can make a dungeon for other players to fight through?  <br>pretty much. But they're more like guild bases that can be invaded. Although I suppose the two are interchangeable.</br>  <br>Yea, apparent your guild base is more or less can be up graded and outfitted to be dungeon when other guilds try to raid.</br>  <br>we'll never get a game like this. I would kill the directors of K-On for a game like this.</br>  <br> Guilds could buy a HQ and customize it.<br> Other guilds or groups of players could attack it and steal your shit, so customizing it to protect it from that was a good idea.<br> And then Ainz Oaal Gown took it to another level by using all their game and IRL money to make a legit dungeon, and one who was never cleared till the end.</br></br></br>  Food for thought  <br>The sparkles are a nice touch.</br>    <br>Where's Aura on there<br><br>She's the only one who isn't fucking retarded</br></br></br>  <br> Aura <br>Sorry, only woman can be best girls</br></br>  <br>In this case the guild HQ was originally a normal dungeon, but then the AOG took it over and expanded it.<br><br>You get a total of 700 experience levels with which to make NPC guardians (for example, 7 100-level NPCs), but if your guild item gets destroyed (the staff in this case) the guild is destroyed.</br></br></br>  <br> Blue is a shit-tier color though. <br>Butthurt redfag detected.</br></br>  <br>Gotta be clear the 700 levels were for the base aka last floor guardians are all independent of it.</br>  Shalltear is mine.  <br>So the maids are all level 100 as well, then?</br>  <br>nah, they're like 30-60ish. <br><br>Sebas is 100 though.</br></br></br>  <br>*brushiebrushiebrushie*</br>  <br>Nah but there are like 20 of them<br><br>Sebas and albedo for 200 of the levels<br>6 maids ranged 40-60 then a ton of low level guys like penguin and mushroom barkeep</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Pandora's Actor? Does he count?</br>  <br>  tfw Ainz Ooal Gown was his way of getting revenge on the assholes that harassed him when he started playing for being a skeleton. </br>   Read the novel <br> The translation is absolute, utter trash, quite possibly run through google translate <br><br>Jesus tapdancing Christ who is this Skythewood and why is their awful fucking translation the one spread far and wide? You can't even get past the first sentence of the description without running into a goddamn error.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was touch me who started the guild.</br>  <br>Dead eyes.</br>  <br>the two started it together</br>  <br>Feel free to improve it.</br>  <br>there were 9 originals that started the guild.</br>  <br>The Nine started it.</br>  <br>Out of all the treasures and weapons of Nazarick, you choose a chair to take?</br>  <br> Thinking Sky was the original or even the sole translator for it. </br>  <br>Maybe because he's the only one actually translating it?<br><br>Personally, I'm capable of forgiving editing errors. This novel seems really poorly written to begin with. I hope you aren't mistaking problems with the original writing with problems caused by translation? Because the translation isn't bad by any stretch for a rushed early draft.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah when they replace him with her sometimes I really just want to kill myself because my autistic head cannot wrap around what is clearly trying to be said.<br><br>Guess you should learn moonspeak</br></br></br>  <br>You know how some people translate stuff to learn japanese<br><br>Sky is some Chinese guy translating to get better at english. Quality jumps in volume 2 though</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>The way that Ainz tells it, it looks like Ainz and Touch Me were together for a while (maybe a day, maybe a week), before starting gathering other players. <br><br>And once they weren't just a few 'friends' playing together, they created a guild.</br></br></br></br></br>  So how powerful are the lizardmen compared to the human characters shown so far?<br><br>Because I actually found the stat cards for them and I'm trying to figure out how strong people like Brain are in comparison.</br></br>  <br> Is it Tuesday yet? <br><br>The weight, is killing me softly.</br></br></br>  <br>Then why it wasn't Original Two, Three? Instead of Nine.</br>  <br>No. But Saturday is tomorrow.</br>  <br>Gazef and brain are stronger I think</br>  <br>no other furniture has a built in ona hole.</br>  <br>Because they were nine guys who created the guild. Once they were in a guild, they starting accepting more members, thanks to them appearing in a different leaderboard (guilds), and not some random players. <br><br>They could have met Tabula, Ulbert and the others started to stick with them. <br><br>My guess is that Touch Me liked to help people and Ainz was the first or one of the first to stick together with him after he saved him (Ainz only refers to Touch Me when talking about how he was saved from human players). As they traveled through the game, more non-human players stick to them, and once they were a big enough group that they thought that having a 'formal' guild would be the best for the team,</br></br></br></br></br>  full op when?  <br>Average Lizardmen warrior is stronger (they can beat strong low-tier skellies), but their heroes are weaker than human heroes. <br><br>Gazef is lvl ~30, while the strongest lizardman is lvl 20. Also, Gazef is not the only Adamantium level fighter of the human world.</br></br></br>  <br>Let's see.<br><br>It is said that Gazef could beat Clementine with his full armor on, who was said to be superior to Narberal in fighting. However, Clementine with her actual gear (before it was taken back by Black Scripture) is superior to Gazef and thus I believe Gazef = Narberal approximately. This places Gazef at around the 50-ish level.<br><br>Brain is weaker than Gazef, but ambigiously so. He is obviously a decent match for him but would lose in any situation, even without armor on. Because he could defeat Shalltear's vampire brides and because Shalltear was more impressed with the leader of the Black Scripture, who could defeat Solution Epsilon (level 50), than Brain, he is probably between level 30 and 40, if not lower.<br><br>The lizards, by comparison, are level 20 maximum. In other words, I have reason to believe that Brain could probably take on the elite team by himself if he tried.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Actually, I thought there was a quote comparing Clementine to the battle maids, but I can't seem to find it...but there is no way Gazef or Brain are inferior to Hamsuke, who is level 30. Gazef should at least be a match for the battle maids.</br>  <br> mistakes Mare for Aura <br>Leave it to narbfags to be this fucking retarded.</br></br>  Was expecting a more fantastic kind of mask, but I guess a CGI Death Knight is okay  <br>I desperete wanna know wat kind of underwer he wears under that sirt.<br><br>Also, wat kind of underwear her ister and albedo wear.</br></br></br>  <br> Touch Me </br>  <br>Yeah, more and more I'm reminded that despite it's problems, the manga has better designs overall.</br>  <br> implying he's wearing underwear. </br>  <br> Implying I was trying to put reverse-traps in my post <br>Dream on anon.</br></br>  <br>so touch me was already world champion when he saved momonga?</br>  <br> Gargantua threw that rock pretty good that one time <br>Not going to lie, it was a good rock throw.</br></br>  <br>Why do people cream themselves over Touch Me? He seems like a bro, sure, but not very interesting as a character.<br> lol moralfag <br>Well, he might be interesting if he somehow came to confront Ainz and what he was doing. But retrospectively, he just seems like a bog-standard paladin.</br></br></br>  <br>are we sure that was him? I don't remember them calling him by name.</br>  <br>Nope, he earned it later on considering they formed a guild before leveling up.</br>  <br><br>Best family one could ask for.</br></br>  <br>they show him with the white armor when saving momonga</br>  <br>The biggest question remains though: What exactly do narbfags see in her? I mean, she's pretty lackluster in nearly all departments.<br><br>I remember reading about how you guys said she "would be everyone's waifu after a few episodes", dropping smugloli and tittymonster but now that I've read the LNs, I can't see it honestly. She's pretty retarded most of the time.</br></br></br>  <br><br>see<br>possible I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, but thinking on it, we never actually find out what the world champion armor looks like. The stuff we see Touch Me always wearing could really just be his normal armor.</br>  <br>She outclasses all of the girls in sheer amount of screentime which I assume is a big factor.</br>  <br><br>vol 3, chap 5<br> The World Champion was a special class granted only to the victor of the official martial tournament. As for the prize, the champion was given one piece of special equipment from the administrator. <br><br> Touch Me had chosen that white armor as his prize. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I remember...you guys said she "would be everyone's waifu" <br>If by "you guys," you meant me, then yes.<br> She's pretty retarded most of the time <br>Her smugness, her cold nature towards humans and just how quickly that turns into being overwhelmed when confronted by her superiors are the best parts of her.<br><br>Oh, and she's easy to bully.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You never see bog standard paladins anymore. It's always Edgy McEdgerson, Supertwink, or douchebag#5.</br>  <br>I'm 99.99% sure it's him.<br><br> Vol 3 epilogue Ainz says it's a rare chance for all the guardians to gather and he's the only nigga that's 30 meters tall. </br></br></br>  <br>Thanks to you I can't imagine Gargantua as anything but a giant Killer Croc from Batman until i actually read about it in a novel or see a picture.</br>  <br>Quality over quantity for me. And it's unlikely to keep up for the entirety of the story.<br><br><br>Alright, guess you have a thing for retards. Nothing wrong with that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He tells Albedo to get Gargantua going right before they leave and it's never brought up again so it has to be him.</br>  <br><br>hmm, fair enough.</br></br>  <br>There's a reason for that. It's played out with Kenshiro and Kamen Rider, where it's just them vs. the big evil guys. In stories where the MC is more ambiguous, it tends to go awry. Just look at how annoying Suzaku was in Geass.</br>  Maids  <br>Whose maids are these? They're cute.</br>  <br>I also like that his description is literally just a Dragon Quest golem to the point where the lizardmen observing could almost call him cute if he didn't throw a giant fucking boulder over their last line of defense.<br><br>Really the entire proper Ainz entrance in volume 4 is hands down my favorite thing in the entire series.<br><br> Lizardmen celebrating their hard earned victory over a very real threat to them  <br> Watch as hundreds of skeletons armed with magic gear that probably surpasses their FOUR sacred treasures line up <br> Ainz freezes the entire fucking lake so he doesn't have to walk in muddy marshland <br> Gargantua appears out of nowhere and throws a boulder big enough to crush all of them right then and there <br> Just to be used as a fucking platform to sit comfy  <br> The seemingly godlike skeletons that could have probably used 1/100 of their total skelly forces to crush all of them turn into fuck stairs <br> Ainz and guardians acting like the most OG fucking endgame baddies ever <br> That ultimatum <br> That Cocytus true warrior battle <br><br>God I love volume 4 so much</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hence his need to tuck the skirt lower all the time. I bet he is hung like a horse for real.</br>  <br>I'm not sure I can really see Suzaku as a Paladin and it's not like my previous examples aren't overplayed as fuck too.</br>  <br>City of Heroes/Villains had something like it.</br>  <br> I bet he is hung like a horse for real. <br> tfw every time I think of him I remember my favorite shota artist.  <br><br><br>not nearly as in depth though. I miss that game.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I'm glad Cocytu and Demiruge are rather level headed.<br>Shaltear and Albedo seem to have a tendency of going 0 to 100 really fucking quick.</br></br>  <br>They're the non-Pleiades maids of Nazarick, homunculus maids and their leader is the Head Maid Pestonya, High Priest with the stitched towgether/split dog head.<br><br>Sebas is the head butler and his servants are most likely homunculus too and they wear the silly masks and don't seem to speak ever. Apart from Mr. Toilet Cleaner who is joke assistant to Sebas.</br></br></br>  <br>Homunculus maids of Nazarick</br>  <br>I think that part was a lot of people's favorite scenes in volume 4. we're all probably going to shit ourselves in glee if and when volume 9's ever translated.</br>  <br>You get really touching moments with Albedo but she's used way too much as comic relief or to just be there to yell at everyone that she loses her appeal when all the guardians get together.<br><br>Demiurge is usually calm and collected so when he legit got fucking pissed at Ainz going to fight chair alone it shows how much he really cares as opposed to Albedo who usually just screams.</br></br></br>  <br>So there's the Pleiades Six Stars and the Pleiades Seven Sisters with different leaders, right?</br>  <br>To be fair, a lot of people would drop their spaghetti too if they were suddenly forced to accompany their god 24/7, address him like a commoner, and watch people not show the proper respect you'd expect for a guy who can presumably conquer the world single handedly.</br>  <br> he wouldn't want a spaghetti dropping shapeshifting qt3.14 who is easily bullied as a bride <br>I don't know where to start anon</br></br>  <br>The only difference is that seven stars/sisters includes Lastborn but we don't see what the fuck she does so it doesn't matter.</br>  <br>Worse, Ainz picked her because he mistakenly thought only Albedo detested humans. It seems like 90% of Nazarick NPCs hate them.</br>  <br>that sounds fun and all <br>i have never played an rpg like that with a dm and all though i have been meaning to try it</br></br>  <br>No, Pleiades Six Star and Seven Star are merely formations. Seventh member is under lockdown and can't be moved by anyone else than Ainz.<br><br>And said Lastborn is the actual captain of the squad, Yuri-nee being vice-captain in her absence and they're lead by Sebas as commander? iirc.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Got it. Thanks, kind anons.</br></br>  <br>Sure, but if your fucking god tells you to do something, that should override any other thing you assumed beforehand. If he tells you to throw shit at him and call him names, then you don't question it, you just DO IT.<br><br><br>Not into bullying<br> Rather into being bullied :3c </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She does bullying too, anon. She's very well-rounded.</br>  <br>So who doesn't hate humans in Nazarick? I know Sebas doesn't, but who else?</br>  <br>yuri alpha</br>  <br>Yeah, but she's weak as fuck, is kinda stupid and doesn't laugh maniacally like a super villain. She's also not yandere.<br><br>Albedo is clearly the superior bullyfu.</br></br></br>  <br> level 2 commander and general already unlocks the full potential of a shit tier item, which goes from 19 goblins to 5000 goblins <br><br>So what happens when a level 15 commander/general uses a level 100 summon item? Does he get 10 world eaters or something?</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure Albedo would be better bullied.</br>  <br>Hate? Well, let's see:<br>Sebas (obv.)<br>Pandora's Actor is nearly neutral so he doesn't care<br>Same goes for Aura and Mare<br>Yuri Alpha is fine with them, I will assume Lastborn is as well (she's human)<br>Entoma eats them, but she doesn't care otherwise<br>Shizu also doesn't care<br>Cocytus doesn't care but respects warrior humans (e.g. Gazef, Brain)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Solution doesn't hate humans. She loves them  to be inside her belly being slowly digested </br>  <br><br><br>From top to bottom<br><br>Sixis<br>Phile<br>Rumiel</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah. He picked her up because he knew Albedo would automatically go berserk so he picked the one he deemed best at infiltration (shape shifting is useful as fuck after all) while forgetting to double check her personality.</br>  <br>Yes, but that goes for all the Nazarick NPCs since they're all doormats. I suppose the ultimate bullyfu in Overlord would be Clementine, but alas...</br>  <br> Weak as fuck <br>Anon, she defeated two dragons with ease, pls no bully (but seriously powerlevels have nothing to do with waifus)<br><br> Kinda stupid <br>She was picked over Albedo based on Albedo's failure to not act out against humans. I would say that Albedo is about as intelligent as her and also as prone to acting out<br><br> Doesn't laugh maniacally <br>Smugness is best.<br><br> Not yandere <br>If that's your fetish, go for it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's too many maids in Nazarick. Whose fault is this?</br>  <br>Ought to have gone with Solution instead. All the disguising abilities of Nerberal and way more charming! Also great for quickly disposing of evidence if you had to murder someone in a pinch.<br><br><br> powerlevels have nothing to do with waifus <br>A weak waifu cannot bully, and as such that statement is entirely false.<br>  I would say that Albedo is about as intelligent as her <br>HOW DARE YOU!?  okay you're right about this one. <br> Smugness is best <br>Smugness a shit. Also, chairfu is better for that.<br> If that's your fetish, go for it. <br>Right back at ya. It's a good thing this series covers nearly all bases, something for everyone.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too much dosh to spend and data crystals farmed, same reason they expanded down to 10th Floor from original 2/3 and could invest into custom npc's more than mere 700 levels.</br>  <br> chairfu is better for that <br>I would agree if not for the fact that every single time she was smug she got BTFO for it</br></br>  Man, that first episode of MC all alone in his guild halls gave me WoW feels<br><br>...Is FFIV any good?</br></br>  All this MMO world makes me want to play a powerful customizable RPG, any suggestions?  <br>Bones was bluffing when he said he froze the lake so he wouldn't get dirty, he was doing that to show off.</br>  <br>4 is okay.</br>   Think the Papa Bones meme is just grasping at straws about how much they suck his dick and how he's the authority figure <br> Read the LN <br> All the pure sadness and anger he has over being left alone  <br> At the start his devotion to the NPCs is more due to respecting the legacy of his guildmates and remembering his glory days <br> Even focuses on the fact they are his friends' creations and views them like the possessions of other people he shouldn't be fucking with <br> After the scene in the mausoleum where he comes "face to face" with his long gone allies he mans the fuck up <br> That moment when he finally joins the guardians in their merry making <br> From that point he switches over from constantly referring to them as the children of his guild members to his children  <br> Actually tries to help them grow instead of just using them or protecting them <br><br>On the flip side<br><br> Think the constant dick sucking from the floor guardians is stupid and boring about 100% loyalty <br> All those subtle moments in the dick sucking from Demiurge showing anger for the first time for potentially losing Ainz or Albedo breaking down over being left alone for good <br> Cocytus being terrified of Ainz leaving him for being a bad boy and the horror at the idea of him being without purpose <br><br>Oh my god the abandonment issues are so strong I love it so much. Beyond all the dick sucking and murder and over powered lvl 100 NPCS they're all just really frightened children who fear losing the one person who never left them and Ainz himself had to get over the fact people in his life had to leave him but he doesn't want that to ever happen to them again.<br><br>What a horrible dysfunctional fucked up family Nazarick the best.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Whose maids are those maids? </br></br>  <br>It's good but it cost's $15 a month and the UI is a real clusterfuck in my opinion. For a fantasy MMO, I think you would be better with Tera, ESO or WoW.</br>  <br>If we're talking about just guardians and not floor guardians then Pandora's Actor is also part of the competent side, and some of the others as well.</br>  <br>He also wanted to test the range of the terraforming spell but it's still the presentation that counts.</br>  <br>Skyrim with mods<br> Not even kidding, it's by far the most customizable </br></br>  <br>Cecil a shit, a SHIT<br>Four Fiends ftw<br>Rydia best girl</br></br></br>  <br>The manga artist who made the maid outfits was fucking obsessed with them.</br>  <br>It was originally 6 floors.</br>  <br> Rydia best girl <br>My fucking nigga.</br></br>  <br>She's a mage that was told to only use lvl 3 magic. The dragons would have been one shot if papa bones hadn't told her to supress her power level</br>  <br>Are Papa Bone's guildmates ded?</br>  <br> you could do better with WoW <br>Are you for real?</br></br>  <br>You are aware that you're talking to someone PRAISING Narberal?</br>  <br>You should show Ainz how it's done anon. We'll be waiting for you on the news.</br>  <br>No but he basically comes to term with them being "gone" as he looks at their ugly as shit "gravestones" and uses the gear they passed on to him to beat the shit out of Chair.</br>  <br>It wasn't playful teasing. It was just Demiurge's settings that makes him insult humans like trash. <br><br>Ainz just hasn't caught on to all his npcs mannerisms yet, even though he thinks he has.</br></br></br>  <br>Is the it the fact that she has levels in General that allow her to use the Goblin Horn more effectively or just her levels in general? I don't know about the spoilers for that part.</br>  <br>Ah, well memory can be faulty at times. I stand corrected.</br>  <br>Considering how this scene in the LN was not described in detail what so ever Madhouse just got lazy.</br>  <br> Is the it the fact that she has levels in General that allow her to use the Goblin Horn more effectively or just her levels in general? <br><br>I know what you're trying to say but that's a really funny way of putting that.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's hard for people to see that all the dick-sucking actually covers some deep-seated fears. The more the dick-sucking, the more scared that person is. Demiurge is probably the one guardian I never expected to be that scared of losing Ainz. He seems so self-assured and calm all the time, I never would have expected that of him.</br>  <br>I'm just not a big Final Fantasy fan. I like the games but I am generally meh towards it.</br>  <br>Gazef isn't even heroic level. Clementine is stronger than him she just doesn't have the decked out gear since she left the Black Scripture. She was the strongest non-awakened human as far as we knew since there is no mention of it when she brags to Ainz, no mentioning the blood of the gods and what not while Kid Captain goes on and on about it.</br>  <br>He's probably the most competent, I think. Outside of Sebas.</br>   Am I the only one who was upset the adventurers got killed in book 2? They seemed like bros, yet are never mentioned again. :( It's never to late to get more bros, Ainz-sama. Also, you used to be a human, so show some sympathy you dick-ass skeleton man.   <br>Such is life. We knew what we were getting into from volume 1.</br>  <br>Was Brain actually weaker than Gazef by the time the story starts? He was weaker than Gazef ages ago, but he was training every damn day whereas Gazef had to run around doing knight shit and getting migraines through politics.<br><br>Other than Gazef's superior offensive attack technique I don't think Brain lacks anything from Gazef even during the fight with Shalltear.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon, maybe you should skip volume 7 when it's translated if you feel this way.</br>  <br>Wait to read up the other volumes, you're gonna be full rage mode then</br>  <br><br>This seems familiar..</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure we've only seen him with his world champion armor so that would indicate you're wrong.</br>  <br> Also, you used to be a human, so show some sympathy you dick-ass skeleton man. <br>Sympathy for anyone outside of Nazarick's in the past, dear anon. I was also upset for a while but, well, just don't get attached to any side characters anymore, You'll be happier that way.</br></br>  <br> Was Brain actually weaker than Gazef by the time the story starts? <br> Nope. Clementine states the strongest people in the Kingdom that could beat her and he was one. </br></br>    So what's the deal with Blue Rose?<br><br>All I've seen is the group shot of them and the weird rogue looking one being in love with Momon.</br></br>  <br>they were mentioned in the first chapter of volume 5. They do missions and shit.</br>  <br>They're Adventurers whose leader's pretty close to the Kingdom's princess.</br>  <br>It's either the levels in general or commander or both. I forgot which. But I doubt Ainz would let those consumables go even if they are lowbie mobs. 5000 goblins is a very convenient tool no matter how you go about it.</br>  Holy shit the pacing is shit slow.  <br><br><br>Nah, I'm okay with it I guess, I just dislike potentially interesting characters getting killed off for shock value in series like Game of Thrones, etc. It's just a lazy way to shock readers and cut the character development arcs off short in most cases.<br><br>On the other hand, Overlord is about very different things, I accept that fully. Personally I think I'd prefer Ainz to be a bit more conflicted about being a dick-ass skeleton lord, I think it'd flesh out the character and make him more interesting but I understand it's not exactly high art they're going for, more like "LOL a cool lich going around murdering folks with his fine-ass bitch harem :D:D". Fortunately, I can appreciate that as well. No tears, only skellies now.</br></br></br></br></br>  Next week's a pretty good place to end the 3-episode rule thing. Those who aren't into it after Carne Village probably won't like it even if they watch more.<br><br>Brace for the "MC's a Gary Stu. Dropped" memes.</br></br>  <br>but episode 4 is where it will be at.</br>  <br><br>I don't know how any who is at least familiar with the series can think that.</br></br>   playing HM&amp;M3 and playing Necropolis <br><br>Fuck yes.</br></br>  <br>Technically he's more competent. Unlike Sebas he has never fucked up like allowing a girlfriend to get kidnapped right under his nose. <br><br>Pandora is supposed to be nearly as smart as Demiurge, yet because he's powered by Ainz's personality he's always cautious and double checks his orders with Ainz allowing no misinterpretation.<br><br>And let's not forget he's the only guy who can copy all 41 members as well as possibly Rubedo giving him unmatched versatility. Ainz may have just been praising PA to calm him down but it's damn true the guy is a special existence when it comes to Nazarick's operations in the new world.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The transition could have been better though. When he first arrives, Ainz shows some concern about the welfare of humans. When he nabs the theocracy dudes after the angel fight, he just goes straight into super-villain mode instantly. I think his descent to evil could have been handled more gracefully.</br>  <br>Leader is a teenage noble and Chuuni who is played by the Princess on a daily basis<br><br>She started it when shehulk saved her and because her uncle was part of another adamantium ranked team<br><br>The two twins are assassins who were rescued by the noble<br><br>The final Mage is actually  Landfall, a legendary vampire who got subdued by players hundreds of years ago . She's easily the most dangerous of the bunch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Necromancy 100%. <br>Necropolis is so broken.</br></br>  <br>Ironically Skyrim probably would be one of the best to go Overlord modding, even if you'd have to work real fucking hard on the spells since the combat system is garbage.</br>  <br>Good. ADHD pls go</br>  <br><br> just own a tablet <br><br>Gee. Not that hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dominions 4 is a more proper Ainz sim to be honest</br>  <br> I just dislike potentially interesting characters getting killed off for shock value in series like Game of Thrones, etc. <br>What? The Swords of Darkness was a good way to show Clementine's capabilities. Sure, she lost but compared to the other people in the world, she was actually pretty damn strong. It was another way to show the levels in the series.<br><br> Personally I think I'd prefer Ainz to be a bit more conflicted about being a dick-ass skeleton lord. <br>Except Ainz is as pragmatic and selfish as they come. He has a very narrow view of his goals. He's not in any position to worry be concerned about people outside his immediate family. What difference is he being conflicted going to make. People will still be dead. He'll still kill people. I personally find it good that he's not runnignaround moping about the fact that people he knows get killed or that he needs to kill people to fulfil his goals.<br><br> but I understand it's not exactly high art they're going for, more like "LOL a cool lich going around murdering folks with his fine-ass bitch harem :D:D". <br>While I agree that the novels aren't exactly high art, there's obviously a lot more going on than "LOL a cool lich going around murdering folks with his fine-ass bitch harem :D:D".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It does mention that because he is a skeleton, his emotions are dulled and he struggles to consider himself human anymore.</br>  <br>If you didn't like the first three episodes,I highly doubt Momonga going all Overlord on the Theorcracy's ass is going to change your mind.</br>  <br>Honestly, PA would probably the best choice for a lot of missions. He's probably the least likely to fuck things up or do things for fun that leads to fuck ups.</br>  Really, it's best to think of all the guardians as just children. Grown up, strong as shit children.  <br>He's not a dick. He simply doesn't care. Are you a dick for not giving a shit when you step on ants while walking the street? Are you a dick when you see roadkill but don't feel pity and sadness? He's biologically incapable of feeling empathy for them, everything relies on his memories and not his actual current self.<br><br>You may as well ask the guy why isn't he fucking bitches left and right now that he has a harem.</br></br></br>  <br>I took it as, in a situation where he could be conflicted over things/people that aren't directly related to him, his goals come first. His increasingly inhuman thoughts wouldn't allow him to feel anything more than disappointment that they were killed. I don't know how else the author could have made his current mental processes clear than in a situation where a normal human being would have felt way more than he did.</br>  <br>That's exactly what they are though. Nothing to think about. Their technical life span is less than a year since they've become real people.</br>  <br> Aura says she's 76 years old. <br> Actually less than a year technically. <br>My sides.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably written like that in her bio.</br>  <br>She's a growing girl.</br>  <br>Possibly or she's counting it based on gametime instead of RLtime.</br>  <br>From what I can tell they still remember everything that happened in the game. So they have a rather weird world view where their monster creators talk about their regular lives with each other.</br>  <br>I think people are having trouble with that because he used to be a human. I think they can't understand how a human, whether or not it's conscious or not, can give no fucks about other humans. The fact that Ainz isn't angsting about it outside of that scene he acknowledged what was happening to him makes it harder for them to swallow.</br>   Albedo has her Ainz and knitting <br> Demi has his carpentry <br> Aura has her burgers <br> Shalltear has her fake alcoholism  <br><br>Mare and Cocytus need hobbies</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Game lasted 10 years <br> Thinks a character created in a vidya game can possibly be older than the game itself <br>My sides.</br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything<br><br>buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>Everything about this is perfect except the face.</br>  <br>I need this</br>  <br>This looks like impending hotglue</br>  <br>I have found a new fetish. bikinis too small for their tits.</br>  <br><br>I FUCKING LOVE short shorts.</br></br>    <br>There's nothing wrong with the face.</br>  <br>Kojak a shit. Clear when?</br>  Seems like there's an exhibition in my city that has GSC, Alter, Volks, and the smaller manufacturers turning up. I'll post pics if any new prototypes happen to be shown tomorrow.  <br>Weird to see batman and superman, but seems interesting</br>  <br>I have that Miku, love her.</br>  <br>Reminds me I gotta pick up Aoba but I cant bring myself to pay 7k+ for a nendo.</br>  So it was mentioned in the previous thread. What's the deal with Chicago customs? They don't give a fuck over there or something?  <br>You should have preordered those nendo nipples when you had a chance.<br><br> I didn't preorder him either, but I found him on Rakuten for 40usd later. </br></br></br>  <br>What's going here? Chicago customs? Now that I think about it, my parcels always land in Chicago for customs.</br>  <br>I don't know. Referring to this last thread. As far as NY customs go, I haven't had any problems albeit I don't know if I'm on any kind of watch list.</br>  <br>I've only ever had things go through NY customs but I've never had a problem. On the other hand, I never order anything lewd or even loli, so there's no reason for them to stop anything. I haven't really heard of anything getting stopped at US customs though in recent memory.</br>  <br>finally a good fig of mai waifu. They ever list a price or we still in the dark?</br>  <br>Nothing yet.</br>  <br><br>That post makes me curious now, also none of my parcels haven't been open over the years as well</br></br>  <br>That body is too delicious. It should be a crime to be this delicious.</br>  Is this safe in Canada? I'm worried.  <br>yeah totally</br>  <br>nope i hope you get jailed</br>  <br>Any other Canadians getting her? I'd feel a lot safer to know I'm not the only retard.</br>  <br>She's not naked. Even if she was, it's nothing sexual.

She looks pretty naked in it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not Sonico.</br>  <br>She uses her wand thing as a buttplug and it wraps around to cover her pussy.</br>  <br> nothing sexual </br>  <br> it's nothing sexual </br>  <br>shut up and help us jail the canadian<br><br><br><br>yeah it's really fine to me<br>i'm from canada and i will be getting this by the way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nothing to do with being extra paranoid. But more with being fucking retarded.<br><br>Loli IS illegal in Canada. Period. No matter how you fucking try to deluded yourself this it isn't customs won't give a flying fucking shit. It is illegal. Fucking Period. <br><br>You order it at your own risk, stop asking "hey guise is this specific loli legal!?"</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will this be going up on amiami, or exclusive on some other site?</br>  <br>Get it! I'm sure you'll be fine!</br>    <br>No dick means it's not pornographic. It's safe.</br>  <br>There's what looks like a strap on her hip and chest. Maybe a micro bikini or something.</br>  <br>How big is the risk? Can I pull the old "I dind order nuffin"</br>  <br> via 9gag </br>  <br>How many people in these threads have been caught though?

I am emotionally distraught and I have no clue why. I mean I understand what happened but jesus christ.  Also it was good how they made me hate all of the characters at the beginning of the end just so I didn't kill myself after I watched that ending.   That is the intended feeling you're supposed to get from the ending.  <br> ........ <br> just now having watched Eva <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Also who the fuck is this guy and why did he make shinji literally gay at the last minute</br>  <br>I could have lived my whole life not watching this shit and been completely okay with it</br>    he doesn't get eva and says stupid shit about it <br>  he couldn't care less if he hadn't watched it <br><br>yep, it's a casual</br></br></br>  <br> I mean I understand what happened but jesus christ. </br>  <br>That's Adam. He didn't make Shinji gay. He made Shinji feel better that his dad didn't love him.</br>  look at all these fags unironically liking NGE  <br>I realize now that I said who the fuck is this guy and not who the fuck does this guy think he is, my bad.</br>  <br>Quite possibly one of the greatest achievements in cinematic history and normies will never understand it.</br>  <br>you ignorant</br>  <br>OP hasn't realized that its a mostly positive ending yet.</br>  <br>Also I am not saying that I hate it because I think it was really good.

Going to watch them for the first time.  <br>1 is good, its more or less the same thing as the first few episodes. I personally enjoyed 2.0 as I think it gave Rei and Asuka more personality but it splits opinion. The ending of 2.0 and all of 3.0 go full retard though.</br>  <br>is it normal that I forgot what happened and instead keep thinking he is in sea of blood after stabbing asuka all lonely and shit?</br>  <br>They're action flicks, don't expect much from them.</br>  <br>Every time I rewatch it I find something nifty and interesting that I missed.<br> the first angel looks very similar to an empty plug suit <br> it's more likely that Yui is the one floating in the background with "fly me to the moon" playing during the credits </br></br></br>  <br> liking 2.0 <br>It was literally a fanfic and pandered to fans. Typically people who don't appreciate anime or normies tend to like 2.0 more than 3.33.</br></br>  <br>its pretty shit</br>  <br>1.0 and 2.0 are good. Like the first half of the original only more interesting with a quicker pace.<br><br>It's different, but not in a bad way.<br><br>3.0 is a disaster. It's a bad movie, no it's not even a movie it's a flick.<br>It took what could be a good movie series and turned into crap.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't like the Shinji/Rei stuff, thought it was pretty retarded. I did like Rei actually trying to be a person though.</br>  <br>So well-adjusted people who aren't disgusting otaku such as yourself appreciate 2.0?<br><br>I suppose you aren't wrong, and it sounds like what happened. 2.0 is the superior film.</br></br></br>  was anyone else reminded of akira?The end of Akira and the end of NGE series are a lit alike. Where Kanaeda is floating through the white abyss surrounded by the debris of skyscrapers and city architecture, bombarded with thoughts of when he was a child and other surreal visions, reminds me of episode 26 greatly.  <br> not liking joint character development in a series that's entirely about character interaction <br><br>Opinion discarded.</br></br></br>  <br>If you thought 2.0 was doing a credit towards the development of the characters of Evangelion then you didn't get the characters from NGE to begin with.<br>Rei is supposed to be creepy, weird, not even human. Asuka is supposed to be a bitch that you want to kill. Shinji is supposed to be a piece of shit pussy, not the hero he tries to be in 2.0  and 3.33, okay I'll give you that. <br>If you really break down 2.0, it's the equivalent of a fanfic you'd read from someone who finished watching NGE and EoE for the first time. 3.33 goes back to the roots of the series. 3.33 isn't perfect, neither is 2.0. I just find it difficult to understand why people say 2.0 is better than 3.33 then in the same paragraph will say that they love NGE or EoE.</br></br></br>  <br>Even though it goes against the entire fucking point of Rei as a character?</br>  <br><br><br>Since when did 4chan die. Why are these posts not being flamed to all fuck? Are you all 12?</br></br></br>  <br> dat projection <br>Nah, breh. Just dumb people or people who don't get anime.</br></br>  <br>Except none of that's true.<br><br>You sound like one of the people that didn't get Evangelion and got caught up into waifu wars. Hating a character like Rei isn't rational, anon.</br></br></br>  <br> people who don't get anime <br>People who don't get japanese cartoons? Really?<br><br>As if there's something special to get aside from other film, or japanese cartoons are somehow superior.<br><br>Stay fat otaku faggot.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What? Is your only response "ur a waifu fag"?<br>No, man. They fucked over both Rei and Asuka in 2.0. I love all the characters in the Eva series. Stop projecting.<br> I will agree with you that what they did to Misato in 3.33 was disappointing. </br></br></br>  You can appreciate the films, and the initial shared content, but that they have to be considered their own.  <br>You're projecting so hard you could give a power point presentation about why you're so mad by simply standing in a dark room.</br>  You have something to say about Eva, and are using needless ellipses, in July of 2015?  Anno getting married and becoming happy was anime's biggest mistake  <br>You don't have to argue over it. Just let the discussion die.</br>  <br> If you thought 2.0 was doing a credit towards the development of the characters of Evangelion then you didn't get the characters from NGE to begin with. <br>What do you mean by this?<br><br> Rei is supposed to be creepy, weird, not even human. Asuka is supposed to be a bitch that you want to kill. Shinji is supposed to be a piece of shit pussy, not the hero he tries to be in 2.0 and 3.33, okay I'll give you that. <br>Meh, sounds like you didn't get Evangelion at all and is just projecting some lunatic narrative over the movies that doesn't even fit the original.<br><br>2.0 could be construed as a fanfic on the grounds that it's different yet features the same characters, but that doesn't make it a fanfic. It's official, and it carries itself well enough so you can't use the derogative meaning of the word "fanfic".<br><br>NGE is better, but 2.0 and 1.0 are both find beginnings for a movie series based on the former. 3.33 is just shithouse.<br><br>Last I checked the roots of NGE wasn't skipping introspection and flying space battles and gay piano. Nice try but it's obvious you're just another of the pathetic waifufags that probably jerk it to asuka like shinji did in EoE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After reading that I don't consider your opinion worth a dime. Learn to analyze a film or story objectively instead of just doing it by heart, in other words what sort of waifu you have. Your heart is filthy as is your appraisal of these movies.</br>  <br> Asuka is supposed to be a bitch that you want to kill. Shinji is supposed to be a piece of shit pussy <br>Completely wrong. They were characters with flaws due to the extent of their hedgehog's dilemma that were resolved in EoE. You are supposed to sympathize with them, not hate them.</br></br>  <br>Not going to take someone seriously who actually implies anime is something you have to "get" as if was some sort of non-normie secret club. Go cry about how the normies ar ruining everything fatty.</br>  <br>Oh you're one of those guys who's only valid criticism against 3.33 is "I didn't get the timeskip."<br>Flying space battles isn't a bad thing. NGE had action, EoE had action, 1.0 had action, 2.0 had action, now when 3.33 has it it's bad? Be objective.<br> As for gay piano, don't be dumb. That's in no way gayer than Kaworu literally asking Shinji to fuck him and then showing Shinji crying at the end of the episode about how much he "loved" Kaworu. </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it goes against her character; she's meant to be a blank slate but the experiences she has makes her question otherwise. I think its interesting seeing someone with no idea on how to interact with people trying to figure it out and act on it.</br>  <br>You don't even realize how retarded you are.<br><br> b-but it pandered to fans! <br> only non-fans (i.e normies and non-anime-fags) liked it <br><br>Yeah, sounds to me like 2.0 was a fine movie and you're a butthurt dweeb sad about lousy shipping BS.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "ur just wrong because I say so so I give up I'm the winner" </br>  <br> 3.33 shipped harder than NGE where Kaworu says he wants to fuck Shinji, Shinji cries about how he loved Kaworu, and 2.0 where Shinji goes out of his way to save Rei and then share a romantic moment where they grab eachother's hand while Rei looks into his eyes with tears swelling up in them <br>I just hate it when people pretend to know anything about Evangelion when they don't.</br></br>  <br> Oh you're one of those guys who's only valid criticism against 3.33 is "I didn't get the timeskip." <br>I don't know what the fuck you are talking about, learn to actually argue and not defecate using your keyboard like you just did.<br><br> Flying space battles isn't a bad thing. NGE had action, EoE had action, 1.0 had action, 2.0 had action, now when 3.33 has it it's bad? Be objective. <br>Here's how you're not being objective:<br><br>Flying Space battles and all that other crap I mentioned occupy more of the total running time of the movie than NGE's action does. THis is being objective, and you can't be objective but just a generalizing cunt who is just pretending to have an informed or intellectual opinion when all he has is waifu butthurt. Yes, I include Kaworu in that too because he's the most shallow "waifu" out of them all.<br><br> b-but gay piano isn't as gay as some other bullshit I wrote <br>So fucking what, I never said it being gay was a problem. We could indeed have upped the gayness by a factor of 100% if we could have integrated it into the story in a proper, believable manner that doesn't violate everything to make it happen. <br><br>In other words, everything else than what a forced-in gay piano scene was.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Referring to yourself of course, I don't see how that blurb of meaningless greentext in any way forms a coherent argument.<br><br>My tip: fuck off. You're the reason shit anime (and any other media you consume) gets shoveled out by the dozens, because you have no brains, no critical mode of thought and absolutely no standards. (No, your favorite ship or fetish is not an acceptable standard).<br><br>Just by existing, you are lowering the collective bar of humanity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't know what the fuck you are talking about, learn to actually argue and not defecate using your keyboard like you just did. <br>Good argument. You really changed my mind with your spicy hot opinion.<br><br> Flying Space battles and all that other crap I mentioned occupy more of the total running time of the movie than NGE's action does.

Yes, I include Kaworu in that too because he's the most shallow "waifu" out of them all. <br>Enough. This isn't a waifu issue. This is an issue with the overall development of the characters. As for the action, perhaps you need to rewatch the series, EoE, fuck rewatch it all. EoE had a shitload more "action" than 3.33 and EoE was fucking incredible. Stop being silly.<br><br> In other words, everything else than what a forced-in gay piano scene was. <br>You were implying it was a shipping issue. I'm saying it was more shipping and relationship forcing in NGE where Kaworu literally asks for Shinji's dick.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His counter is literally just waifu bullshit with nothing concerning actual criticism, not a single concrete points he can show me or the rest of this thread, just "waah muh misato."<br>His, or yours for that matter, is not worth a dime.<br><br>Spinning some sort of fantastical narrative about what a viewer is supposed to do rather than analyzing the work itself and accepting what it realistically is works like a giant warning sign.</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally no argument other than "you're dumb" </br>  Has the Reifag autist invaded another thread again?  <br>Shinji just wanted someone to love him without him having to go through the trials and tribulations of developing a relationship with people himself. He was afraid of developing that sort of intimacy with others since he understood the kind of pain that could come out of it first hand (his mother dying before his eyes, his father essentially abandoning him), Kaworu offered him an easy solution, and he took it even though Kaworu was a guy. He didn't care, he just wanted that level of intimacy regardless of who it was with.</br>  <br> Good argument. You really changed my mind with your spicy hot opinion. <br>It's a fucking good argument and your dumb retort just shows it.<br><br>Instead of formulating your previous argument in a way that actually makes sense, you try to be witty and pretend you can make a point. Try again.<br><br> Enough. This isn't a waifu issue. <br>It obviously is. Your arguments use points that obviously don't match reality, and the only direct complaints concern waifu bullshit. Be honest.<br><br> As for the action, perhaps you need to rewatch the series, EoE, fuck rewatch it all. EoE had a shitload more "action" than 3.33 and EoE was fucking incredible. Stop being silly. <br>Are you trying to fucking bluff me?<br><br>We're three fourths trough Rebuild now, and for your information that part in NGE has us delve into the minds of several of the characters and focus on interaction between them.<br>All missing in Rebuild's third quarter.<br><br>The lack of said development and introspective substance makes it objectively undeniable that Rebuild pound for pound features more action and waifu bullshit.<br><br> You were implying it was a shipping issue.  <br>I was not. I mentioned it in the same sentence as the flying battle scenes. You either have no reading comprehension or are a tumblr-triggered idiot who reacts to certain words and spouts pre-formatted answers.<br><br>Step your game up or step the fuck out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Possibly? I haven't been reading the textwalls. Just seems like a Misatofag and an another person arguing.</br>  <br>Serious question, why does no one seem to understand the end of evangelion?<br>They set it up in the best ways a medium can where the end doesn't make sense until the end where all the information is released, but it didn't feel like a meaningless stream of info and rather it was learned at the same pace as the characters.<br>When I first watched I already knew the meme of "what the fuck did I just watch" and none of the plot, but even if I didn't, the last two episodes of NGE set up that non-sequitur feeling already, and the by the end I wasn't confused at all<br>Is it really 2deep for some people? Because it was a fucking kiddie pool in my opinion</br></br></br></br>  <br>No other response is needed to a post that is essentially the same. My post wins out because at least I ask him to reformulate.</br>  <br>Most people watch anime not expecting anything anywhere near as psychologically heavy as Eva turned out to be, so it's understandable why a lot of people would find this anime jarring and confusing.</br>  <br>Some are memeing, others, genuinely retarded.</br>  2.0 sure gets a lot of pointless criticisms from dumb Evangelion fans. Obviously it's not perfect, but every single post I read has little to nothing to do with understanding a movie's flaws as much as it is complaining about waifus. Even the waifu stuff that's wrong with 2.0 nobody complains about because it just backfires at them.  <br> It's a fucking good argument and your dumb retort just shows it. <br> saying "ur dumb" is a good argument <br> twice <br>Holy shit this is hilarious.<br><br> It obviously is. Your arguments use points that obviously don't match reality, and the only direct complaints concern waifu bullshit. Be honest. <br>I won't address this because you keep wanting it to be a waifu issue. I didn't just mention Rei and Asuka. Look at the old posts. Everyone got fucked by the rebuilds. Enough.<br><br> Are you trying to fucking bluff me? <br>Rewatch the series and EoE, particularly EoE. EoE is nothing but action action action for about a good hour until near the end during Instrumentality. My overall point is that there is a lot of action in the entire universe of Evangelion so it's a dumb argument to say it had too much action. And I agree with you that NGE and EoE is better than the rebuilds.<br><br> I was not. I mentioned it in the same sentence as the flying battle scenes. You either have no reading comprehension or are a tumblr-triggered idiot who reacts to certain words and spouts pre-formatted answers. <br>Again the "ur dumb" without making any points. Can you 2.0 fags step up your game? This is getting pathetic.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So basically people expect box gundam but get a show worth a damn and it shocks them?</br>  <br>Ok, bucko.</br>  <br>Just about.<br><br>Either that or they expect funny faces and then get shocked by quality.</br></br></br>  Scanlation Thread<br><br>What are you cleaning/Redrawing/Typesetting?</br></br>  Why is wild words so great?

By standard font I mean something like  Calibri with no capslock .</br>  What makes a font good anyway?  <br>Readability and close approximation of the Japanese typesetting</br>  <br> Calibri <br>Something like this is always a bit too bland for any kind of work, unless you specifically need a bland font for something, and I can't see that ever being a requirement for a primary dialogue font, though it may sometimes be necessary for signs, etc. For dialogue and such, you should mostly try and stick to comic fonts, though the exact kind of comic font can change depending on what sort of manga it is. For example, a style over substance action manga needs very different fonts from a slow paced SoL.</br></br>  <br>Why is WW so used then? It's neither. There's more readable fonts out there and most Japanese typesetting isn't supposed to have that comic-ish look. Kana has serif for starters, even if kanji doesn't. Actually, both have serif sometimes. Did someone in fan scanlations started using WW because it was used in American comics and everyone went along with it?</br>  <br>This  plus being suitable for the sort of manga you're working on, though to a degree that comes with<br> close approximation of the Japanese typesetting </br></br>  <br> Did someone in fan scanlations started using WW because it was used in American comics and everyone went along with it? <br>Pretty much.</br></br>  Does anyone else accidentally cum while working on hentai doujins?  <br>I think it's a very readable font and I think comic-ish fonts are fine to use to approximate the Japanese typesetting because of the difference in how fonts are used in Japan and the west but I think the main problem with Wild Words is that it will sort of work for most purposes but it will inevitably be mediocre or a little subpar, and so using it is just half-assed typesetting. As for<br> Did someone in fan scanlations started using WW because it was used in American comics and everyone went along with it? <br>Pretty much, it was used by a lot of the typesetters in Manga Project so it has basically been the standard since almost the beginning of scanlation.</br></br></br>  <br>My problem with comic fonts is that they don't always feel right. They work with cute characters saying cute things, shounen characters doing shounen things, but an old man in a seinen comic? I don't know, it feels wrong. On top of it Japanese can use a lot of different fonts sometimes, so not only you have to use comic fonts for every character to keep it consistent, you have to use different looking readable comic fonts that work well together. Wouldn't this be easier to achieve by using more standard non comic fonts? It doesn't have to be Calibri specifically, of course.</br>  <br> Wouldn't this be easier to achieve by using more standard non comic fonts? It doesn't have to be Calibri specifically, of course. <br>Well, it depends on what we each consider to be a "comic font". My idea may be broader than yours. I agree with what you're saying in a sense, but I think you need to just be careful not to use fonts that are a bit too bland. If you check out a few font guides there's usually a few fairly simplistic fonts that can work for the kind of purposes you're talking about, but if you want to experiment, just try not to use fonts like Arial or Calibri. You want fonts that look natural in the middle of a page of art, not ones that look best suited to walls of text in documents or novels.</br></br>  <br> Photoshop </br>  <br>I guess the more readable book type fonts may end up looking out of place if everyone is used to seeing bold/wider comic style ones. Some of the book type fonts also have those extra flairs on characters that stand out when scaled up, or sometimes they are just too round and plain.</br>  <br/>  <br>The ones I've done were pretty uninteresting to me.

Am I right?  <br>dem legs</br>  <br>I want to do dirty things with her.</br>  I wasn't even trying to get boner this episode. Dammit Rori. <br><br>Overall, a good episode, although the cgi dragon is lame.</br></br>  <br>So fucking lame, why can't they show her panties in anime? Do they have to use these stupid physics to cover her up?<br>Fuck this. A-1 is really apologetic fucks.</br></br>  <br>Why do you need her panties when you have her voice to fap to.</br>  <br> liking lame pantyshots </br>  <br><br>It's the difference of being awkward and apologetic, or being proud and glorifying about a girl.<br>Fuck you for promoting censorship.</br></br></br>  <br>I find it way more entertaining to see all the different ways the actually cover up her panties. Besides, that's not why I like this series. Go watch K-On or some shit if you want that.</br>  <br> Go watch K-On or some shit if you want that. <br>Excuse me, are you retarded? K-On has no panties.<br>Also </br></br></br>  She's even better than I imagined, All hail Rory Mercury.    <br> being a loli hater satisfied by censorship <br>As expected of Lelouch.</br></br>  She's shit on the anime  Can we all agree that elf is the worst?<br> Muh PTSD </br>  <br>Jesus christ Rory's design is fucking awful, this shit is Kuroneko yandere mode and nothing more than that.<br><br>The novel designs are much better than this piece of shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Agreed, and to be safe, A-1 censors her needlessly.</br></br>  I prefer anime design over old looking manga design<br>Rory is pure sex</br>  <br>Bullshit, anime Rori is much less loli,<br>can I say 'TOO OLD' hahaha</br></br>  <br>That's obvious, and you are replyng to bait.</br>  <br>So you preffer a 15 years old girl who use gothic dress and looks like shit.<br><br>You're a pedophile and a retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. Should had stuck with the original.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128217141 <br>Really?</br>  <br> So you preffer a 15 years old girl who use gothic dress and looks like shit. <br>More like 13. 15 is too old, and you are a retard with a shit taste if you like faulty older girls, kill yorself and go back to MAL.</br></br>  <br>This is captive combatant torture.<br>Must report to Amnesty International.</br></br>   actually drawing an anime character with visible lips <br>stop it</br>  No wonder Hardy wants her so bad. I would also get myself a Goddess of Love  <br>It is absolutely best for a man to become her servant after death.</br>  Bozes is the best girl.  <br>Heresy</br>  Anime Rory a best.  <br>Drill&gt;all</br>  <br>Doing stupid shit to hide panties is just as fucking weird and lame as doing stupid shit to show panties</br>  <br>YFW you will not see real drill hair girl IRL</br>  <br>Rori &gt; Persia &gt; Drill</br>  what kind of name is Rory Mercury seriously  Delilah best girl you faggots  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>There is nothing wrong with liking little 2D girls you faggot</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>Epic troll.</br>  <br> Risa voicing these two on Fridays <br><br>Boner please.<br><br>My dick can only get so hard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Delilah a shit<br> I got this letter that makes no sense, is clearly forged, and would jeopardize my standing while ruining everything for everyone else even though the entire purpose of my organization is to have a better life as a monster girl <br> BETTER DO WHAT IT SAYS AND KILL THE GIRL </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br> mental illness <br> defend <br>No need to defend. I'm proud of it since objectively more perfect and not rotten.</br></br></br>  I don't even like loli characters. What the hell is this?  <br>Anyone who likes the autistic novel version is autistic themselves.</br>  So i've read somewhere bf4 that in the end mc stays in this land and all 3 girls go to japan,and the portal can never open again,Is that the truth?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>I think the real mental illness is trying to draw a connection between 3D little girls and 2D loli.</br>  Do I need to watch Steins;Gate before this?  <br>I haven't watched the episode yet but from the concept/teaser art I liked the original design way better.<br><br>Then again, its really her facial expressions and personality that make it, so maybe the redesign will be alright.</br></br></br>  <br>It's inversely proportional to how shitty the CG dragons look.</br>  <br>There are two fucking episodes out. Just watch Steins;Gate along with this as it comes out, dipshit.</br>  <br>Not being able to separate reality and fiction is a key indicator of mental illness, so yes. <br><br>There's no difference in the "loli is CP/pedo/child rapist!" comparison and "You watched a Hollywood movie, now you'll be charged with murder."</br></br></br>  <br>The dragons could use more frames.</br>  <br> We won't ever get her spread eagle nude and showing off her pubes in the anime <br>Why live</br></br>  <br><br>is it a coincidence that Rory in japanese sounds like loli?</br></br>  <br>How does one sound like a lewd 12 year old?</br>  <br> Likes 2D girls looking like kids <br><br>You're a sick bastard.</br></br></br>  <br>The warrior bunny's pubes could be even better to touch than nopubes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128221263 <br> So you're proud about being a pedophile? <br>Why not?<br><br> go back to jail you degenerate fucker. <br>charge me with a crime first, retard :^)</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it worse than Chaos Dragon?</br>    <br>If she was sitting on me I would not be able to contain the boner.<br><br><br>You have great taste anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to do the anal with rory's ass</br>  <br>Best girl is finally here.<br><br>I don't dislike her design in the anime at all.</br></br></br>   pantsu shown in the magazine posters <br> no pantsu in the anime <br>Man, I don't mind fanservice or not, but trollphysics are always annoying.<br>Rori a best.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm not usually into loli but she makes me want to do technically legal things to het</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128220111 <br>faggot</br>  <br> porn will use her bleh anime design instead of the glorious goth loli LN/manga version </br>  <br>hardy must be one hell of an otaku</br>  <br><br> Tuka in a sweater <br><br>dick status: muh</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously, she's as much as a loli as Hestia is one, she's more of a petite woman than anything.</br>  <br>I don't get why anyone would think she's a loli. She has literally 0 features of a loli.</br>  <br>  deleted <br><br>You killed him anon</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty much only because she was said to have stopped aging at around 13-15 years old. Which doesn't means anything by Anime standards.</br>  Reminder that Magic&gt;guns.  <br>please leave wizard anon.</br>  A-1 Pictures couldn't even <br><br> show the part where Rory makes those bandits dig graves. <br> even mention the rape.  <br> even explain why she just went and killed them  <br><br>How are they going to deal with Zoral? Turn him into a snot nosed beta?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Guys, what if. Stay with me here, combine the two. Eh? Anyone?</br>  <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Da slugga!!</br>  <br>Like this ?</br>  This thing<br><br>I've seen it before what the fuck is it?</br></br>  <br>I agree this part was really lacking, 2 minutes for that wouldn't have killed them. It's quite important as to show who she kills and who she doesn't. Though I guess the fact kids knowing and liking her makes it a bit obvious.</br>  <br>It better then adding fucking white/black bars to everything.</br>  <br>Original design, do not steal</br>  <br>Gargantia?</br>  <br>Patamon fucked an Eevee</br>  So is Rory's height in anime?  <br>*what is</br>  Disappointed by this episode tbh.<br><br>I feel they're missing a lot of the gravity that the JSDF's actions are having on the general populace, as well as the general fucked-up-ness of the surrounding area now that it's become mostly lawless.<br><br> Bandits raping and pillaging cut <br> Gravedigging cut <br> No one else willing to help the stuck cart cut <br> Reactions to the JSDF rushing the fire dragon cut <br> Reactions to the JSDF fending off the fire dragon cut <br> Last scene didn't show the kids and old people being relieved <br><br>It just feels like the anime is way more lighthearted than it should be at times, which makes me worry about upcoming events like the Italica Crisis.<br><br>That being said, at least Rory and Lelei were enjoyable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I've heard somewhere it's like 5'3. I might be mistaken but it seems about right.</br>  <br>Tiny. She can basically stand up straight inside the hummer.</br>  <br> 5'3 <br>Nigga, adult men are 5'3 in Japan, try again</br></br>  <br>It's anime though and the men seem pretty tall</br>  So can we all finally agree that the anime design is better than the manga design?  <br>Agree? This is 4chan we don't agree here.<br><br>But everyone on the anime side are not autistic.</br></br></br>  <br> can we all agree <br>Over my dead body.</br></br>  Is this going to become a full harem? Or is it just the elf, sorceresses and goth loli?  <br>Call her a loli one more time...</br>  <br><br>I can't wait for that upskirt page to be animated.</br></br>  <br>Just the 3 girls and only the loli want the MC</br>  <br><br>Why?<br><br>Is going to be censored</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>time of upload this image again</br></br>  <br>Is also a dark elf and to a really minor extent his ex wife later on. Harem hijinks are really minimal though.</br>  <br><br> literally a superior form of art </br></br>  <br> Her name is literally loli </br>  <br>There's also the nigger that becomes his slave (willingly of course) and some novel fag mention that the red-haired princess would apparently join the race too.</br>  <br><br>I imagine a old man drawing this scene</br></br>  all this fighting between manga and anime designs<br><br>just be glad it is not the original LN designs</br></br>  <br> just be glad it is not the original LN designs <br><br>It's not that bad</br></br></br>  <br><br>So despite those long legs she is short as loli?</br></br>  <br>Pretty close to the LN designs.<br>Unless you mean Novel designs.</br></br>  <br>Those are regular book covers, LN versions are this</br>  <br>Looks good. I don't see what the complaints are.<br><br> Just minor stylistic details.</br></br></br>  <br>My eyes are being assaulted.</br>  <br>140cm Range</br>  <br>I dunno why I always think mc will end up with pina.</br>  The LN are translated?<br>I couldnt found em</br>  <br>Oh man fuck Rory look at them tittes.</br>  <br>Holy shit her VA giggled way too much in all of her scenes.</br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br>The best.</br>  <br>Are you offended or raped?</br>  Goddamn, watching the episode made me feel like Im making up scenes but apparently its the studio cutting off parts.   tfw a loli will never sit in your lap   Does anyone know where this step scene is? I can't find it.  <br>Got it.</br>  I hate her voice.  <br> IT'S NOT THE MANGA <br>that's basically it</br></br>  <br><br>The anime design is bleh because its all done to be easier to draw. Less layers and frills and shit. The anime design is very clean and neat, but also just takes stylistic choices like the awful bunny ears</br></br>  I love axe users!  <br>This. Her VA was trying way too hard to sound seductive.</br>  <br><br>the gay is real</br></br>  <br>And she succeeded.</br>    Modern military rekting medieval period fags was the only reason I didn't drop this show. Hopefully we'll get more of that.  <br><br><br> Hating Taneda, Risa ero voice </br></br></br>  <br> magic enhanced sniper rifle <br>No more cold bore shots!<br><br> magic enhanced machine gun <br>No more silly "burst fire", belt dumps all day erryday!<br><br>But wait, there's more!<br><br>Higher magazine capacity thanks to magical hammerspace!<br><br>higher muzzle velocity thanks to magical gas seals!<br><br>Colder running engines that cannot freeze in the cold thanks to magical temperature regulation!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In case you're unaware, the initial release is based on the low res web release. When the tankobon comes out, it gets scanned and a final version gets released.</br>    <br> named after Freddie Mercury <br><br>Gee, I have no idea...</br></br></br>      <br>So when will she star singing half-naked?</br>  <br>The very point of tech&gt;fantasy is denied the very moment you put a loli character that can beat several humans and put fight on a dragon.<br><br>And better we not talk about when she wrecks elite corps on her own.<br><br>Is not that I dislike her character, in any other anime would be best gril, but here she spoils all the premise of the series.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the problem? She did it well.</br>    <br> Makes magic engines <br> Doesn't use magic to increase compression ratios <br><br>More horses is better horses man</br></br></br></br>  <br>One character out of 12 possible ones automatically dump the premise of the show?<br><br>I don't think that's how it works.</br></br></br>  Do they fit some planes through the gate at any point?  <br>her vagina is canadian?</br>      <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Hey look, a CG-eep.</br>  <br>Is she immortal or bulletproof?</br>  <br> K-On has no panties. <br>This is technically true, though there is a somewhat significant plot point that is the result of a panty shot.</br></br>  I like her redesign outside of the stupid ear ribbons.<br><br> Gothic lolita a shit. </br></br>    <br>you have shit taste, the redesign is meh and her voice was better in the manga</br>   Fires rocket <br> No 'bak brast clir!' </br>  Best waifu for MC.  <br>that's when the healthy villagers get to another town</br>  <br>Immortal.</br>  <br><br>This elf is for  ______ </br></br>  <br>Rape.</br>  <br>diplomatic relations</br>  <br> trips </br>  <br>The take them in as big parts as they can.

Maybe add black bars or lens flare?  <br>They included the one shot of a murdered refugee but yeah it definitely could have used a bit more setup.</br>  Why did my RSS download this twice?  Why did Rori kill those guys?  <br> it definitely could have used a bit more setup. <br>There's been 3 episodes of setup. Lots of people been dropping Gate like hot shit because of it.</br></br>  <br> Why is she so perfect? <br><br>Man, this design is really pretty.<br>10/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's actually a pretty nice person, and she killed those bandits and deserters because they're assholes that preyed on regular people.<br><br>That's why she asks the kids in the convoy if they're being force to go with the JSDF, if that little boy had said yes, she probably would've slaughtered them.</br></br></br>  <br>This. If she was just some mass murderer, those kids wouldn't have ran up to her excitedly.</br>  <br> tech&gt;fantasy <br><br>That's not the point of the show at all. <br><br>Hardy could rape Japan along with the entire Earth if she wanted to. And just wait until manga or possibly anime get into the stargate part.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>LN Rory</br>  <br>According to her religion she's allowed to kill as she pleases, and so are the bandits.<br>My understanding isn't that she was killing the bandits to punish them from a religious point of view, but merely doing so because she could, according to her religion.<br><br>Besides, every time she kills people, it feels like sex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Second saga might be ocean Gate with Atlantis and battleships.</br>  <br>There's a second saga???</br>  <br><br>Well, she is the future goddess of  love  after all.</br></br>  <br>Isn't that pic completely unrelated to Gate in any way?
