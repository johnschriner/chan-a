[ Why are all male anime protagonists virgins?  <br>so the nerds that watch it can self-insert more easily.</br>  <br> male haremshit protagonists <br><br>ftfy</br></br></br>    What's the point of being a protagonist if you can't offer your virginity to a worthy partner?  <br>being raped by a man != losing your virginity</br>  Only virgins get magic powers-  <br>What's more important for a self insert fantasy, that the MC is a virgin, or that the girls are all virgins?</br>  <br>He fucked Casca.</br>    <br>It only works when both are.</br>    <br>This and they also happen to not be sluts.</br>    <br>Because who the fuck wants to have sex? You are aware that women are the original sin? We'd all be chilling in the garden of eden had it not been for those whores tempting u and they continue to do it. The Virgins (like myself) who don't engage them attract them more because they like a challenge when ruining a man. If you truly want a lover, find a feminine boy (pic related)</br>  Thanks for reminding me of the exact moment I dropped that show OP.  <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/edgy/</br>  because OP is virgins   tfw sex is not nearly as amazing as anime and hentai make it out to be   <br>It does actually and he fucked Casca.</br>  <br>What's it like then?</br>  <br>Salty coins</br>  <br>Please tell me what it's like. I'm dying to know, I use the Hot Towel Pussy trick to simulate it.</br>  <br>Tell me, /a/ - are you a virgin? I, for one, am not, but sex haven't been a mind-blowing experience.</br>  No time for bitches on the quest for justice  <br>Like using saran wrap as a condom and masturbating.</br>  <br>its been so long i hardly remember. but it certainly wasnt like this.</br>  <br>I'm not, but I didn't have sex in a long time, so I might as well be a virgin.</br>  Because literally everyone in Japan is a virgin.<br>Thier stupid fucking retarded culture made it so that every male is beta as fuck.<br>So beta that it's cringeworthy. <br>That's why Japan is declining.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you did it wrong?</br>  <br> We'd all be chilling in the garden of eden had it not been for those whores tempting u <br><br>adam and eve would have had eternal life and you and I wouldn't have existed</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't there a saying that if you haven't had sex in seven years, then you're a virgin again?</br>  <br> otaku shit on beta protags <br>not realzing there beta themselves and would act like shit haremshit protag</br></br>  <br>SHUT UP, DON'T RUIN MY DREAMS. IT'S THE BEST EXPERIENCE ON EARTH AND WHEN I FINALLY EXPERIENCE IT IT WILL BE JUST THAT, YOU'RE JUST A CYNICAL ASSHOLE TRYING TO BEAT MY HOPES DOWN SO I WILL REMAIN A VIRGIN FOREVER. I'M 19 AND I STILL HAVEN'T HAD ANY SO FUCK YOU, IM LIKE A DOG IN HEAT 24/7. SOONER OR LATER IF I DON'T GET ANY I'LL TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE, I NEED IT, IT SHOULD BE THE MEN WHO DECIDES WHO THEY FUCK LIKE IT WAS IN THE PASSED, FUCK PEOPLE AND THEIR "MORALS". <br><br>THAT'S WHY THERE'S SO MANY SHOOTINGS HAPPENING, YOUNG MEN AREN'T SEXUALLY SATISTFIED AND GO BERSERK. IT'S WOMEN'S JOB AS ANIMALS TO APPEAL TO OUR NEEDS, WERE'S KILLING EACH OTHER.</br></br></br>  <br> Hot Towel Pussy trick <br><br>Explain.</br></br></br>  <br>*they're</br>  <br>Projecting much?</br>  <br><br> beta  <br>The word you're looking for is omega<br>Beta is right next to alpha, while omega is the opposite</br></br></br></br>   not a virgin <br>Dandy<br>Goku<br>renton<br>Spike<br>Adam blade<br> characters that died a virgin <br>Kamina</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, sex is just overrated. It can be good, if you're willing to become experienced. It can take half a dozen times or more before sex starts to get good, and even then it's not that amazing.</br>    <br>Was Dandy not a virgin? I guess it hinted at that he fucked a hypercube.</br>  <br> half a dozen times <br>I think you just suck at it.</br></br>  <br>You soak towel in a good amount of warm (not to boiling) level, once it's at your desired temperture you rap it as if it was a subway sandwich, close the opposite end and stick your dick in the hole. The warmth and moist inside is now simulating a pussy and you can pound away while holding the town and your hard cock and imagine something beautiful &lt;3</br>  It's getting pretty /r9k/ in here. <br>Better report it.</br>  <br>Perhaps, but sex certainly is something you need to practise a lot on. It doesn't get great within the first couple times.</br>  <br>Yeah, seconding this one. The only people who think sex is important or buy into shows that run on lewd fanservice are just people who haven't had it. I'm not saying that as an insult, it's just a disappointment. The entire experience is massively overrated because of how hard society pushes it. I get off better and frequently with my hand. And I don't have to worry about cuddling or getting my hand pregnant either. I can just watch my fucking anime in peace.</br>  <br>Did you read this somewhere, or did you actually came up with this?</br>  <br>Hate to shatter your virgin fantasies, but<br> vaginas are not warm <br> they're the same temperature as your dick <br> dumbass </br></br></br></br>  <br> projecting  <br>most of u faggots cannot stare people in the eyes,me I will stare at anyone in the face no fucks given</br></br>  <br>Also seems like the guy who blow all his money on space hookers</br>  <br>You can't even type properly. <br>I highly doubt anyone you fuck you.</br></br>  <br>I think the sex can only be good if you're strongly in love with the person you fuck<br>My that's only my virgin guesses</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, that's an insult to me a virgin. Who the fuck are you to say what sex is like for everyone u biased dickhead.</br>  <br>I guess not cause people casually hook up all the time.</br>  <br>no hes got a point some times its pretty other times its just awkward</br>  <br> typing properly is related to having sex </br>  <br>I came up with that, but when I told the people i'm friends with at college they knew about the trick so I guess great minds think alike.<br><br><br>Fuck off, not every girl is the same and for your information you didn't shatter any fantasies I have. I at least showed i'm more creative than you. Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's certainly gets better. If the girl is in love with you it's usually easier to turn her on too.</br>  <br>You better be right about this.</br>  <br>You're probably a guy in your 20s giving your dick a beating with a deathgrip every single day while watching hentai. Being with a real woman is going to be a disappointment for you.</br>  <br>Mansluts lose their magic powers.<br><br>It's true. Women suck men dry. That's why MC's always fight them off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a guy who had a lot of sex.</br>  <br> not every girl is the same <br>Literally every human has roughly the same body temperature, dumb fuck.</br></br>  Because only normalfaggots want anime with non-virgins in it and normalfaggots don't buy shit.<br><br><br>Get lost normalfag.</br></br></br>  <br>My first time was pretty pathetic, but if it's not getting better around the 3rd time or so I feel that you're doing something wrong.</br>  Because no one wants used goods, duh  <br>This, should the time ever come, be vary, if the woman actually ever want's to do it again with you after not cumming and therefore kind of weirding her out/hurting her feelings, cease all masturbation everything will be fine after a while.</br>  <br>You dumbass, there's a reason different people have different hot spots on the body, where heat is determined in the body is subject to the individual. Yes overall we have roughly the same temperature but that doesn't mean where more of that heat is concentrated. I knoe many people with cold hands or arms and many with arm hands and arms. The heat in the body is channeled differently from person to person. You cannot ruin my facts or fantasies now fuck off.</br>  <br>From what I've heard, it not being that great during the first couple times is more common with women, is that true? Some will never even achieve an orgasm despite being experiened.</br>  <br>You can't let the women steal your precious bodily fluids.</br>  <br>Bitch I'm hot. You can't take this away from me.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>STOP RUINING MY DREAMS OF HAVING PERFECT SEX, FUCK YOU NORMAL FAGS, GET OUT. <br><br>Sex is glorious, that's how we all got here, someone fucking enjoyed it you /a/ssholes</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You're misunderstanding. It got better, but still not what I would consider the amazing mind-blowing experience society loves to make it out to be. My point was that the art of great sex takes time and patience.</br>  <br>Are you new enough to think he's serious</br>  <br> giving body extremities as an example <br>Body extremities are not INSIDE OF YOUR BODY LIKE A VAGINA IS.<br>Why am I arguing with a virgin who fucks towels anyway. <br>Put your dick in an ice pack for awhile and then a pussy might feel warm.<br>Actually, that's a really good idea.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice generalization<br>A lot of good anime has non-virging characters rs</br></br>  This thread is pretty sad, even for /a/.  <br>I would have destroyed Sarashiki. Ichika is fucking gay.</br>  <br>Speaking as a woman here, a guy I slept with was a virgin at 24, and he told me that he "couldn't really feel anything." when he was inside me and even said it again after the deed was done. His dick was average sized and I've only had a sex a couple of times before him. Needless to say, I never gave him another chance after saying that to me.</br>  <br>Anon do not worry sources on /a/ dictate that having the ability to type properly means you will have sex.</br>  <br>MODS</br>  <br>Don't even listen to them. Sex is amazing unless you're an awkward beta nerd who fails at sex.</br>  <br>L O N D O N<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably Self inserting but honestly who goes out to lose their virginity except insecure fucks. Is it too romantic to think you should save it for someone you truly love?</br>  <br>GET OUT WHORE<br>DIE ROASTIE</br></br>  <br>LONDON<br>O<br>N<br>D<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not just tell him things like they are instead of giving him the delusion that sex is going to feel amazing?</br>  <br> implying any of these anons have had sex <br><br>Everyone on /a/ is a virgin, anyone who says otherwise is just a liar or a crossie straight from /b/. This is absolute truth.</br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious that the first times you will suck at it man, it will get better.</br>  <br> Why am I arguing with a virgin who fucks towels anyway.  <br><br>Yeah why are you? You fucking Normie, first off you make it seem as if pussy is dead cold, which it isn't, the average fucking temperature in a pussy is 99F or 37.3C that's pretty warm to me and thus i'm right. Fuck you, and how dare you try to prove me wrong on 4chan, especially /a/. This is my home, and we would not be friends in real life. In fact if I knew you, i'd probably punch you in the face and fuck you with my towel dick.<br><br>Choke on a fat one, oh and if you reply to me again, i'm calling your mom a bitch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pls be in London</br>  <br>It does feel amazing, you just suck at it.</br>  <br>This scene caused many a weird boner</br>  <br> honestly who goes out to lose their virginity except insecure fucks <br>I get this, but would you admit to being a virgin at the age 25? I doubt you would.</br></br>  <br> His dick was average sized  <br>How long exactly?</br></br>  <br>I'm a virgin at age 29 and almost a wizard. What now?</br>  <br><br> Actually falling for such an obvious bait. <br>Sasuga.</br></br></br>  <br> the average fucking temperature in a pussy is 99F <br>Guess what temperature your dick is?</br></br>  <br>NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO</br>  <br>Are you perhaphs new to 4chan?</br>  <br> His dick was average size <br><br>Women seem to have different ideas about average size.</br></br></br>  <br>That's incredibly sad and uncommon.</br>  Spike definitely was not a virgin. I mean, he cucked Vicious. That was like, most of the plot. <br><br>Pretty sure Yang Wenli was not a virgin also. <br><br>Gene Starwind totally fucked tons of girls.<br><br>Chinese Electric batman also not a virgin.<br><br>...Kamina probably died a virgin though. Space Dandy - also probably a virgin.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what? That's a lot of concentrated heat, Warm Dick + Warm Pussy equals Warm delicious sex. You cannot change my mind. I'm right, you're wrong. So fuck off.<br><br>Your mom's a bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad I'm uncommon in a world filled with such disgusting filth.</br>  <br>Not that person, but 15-16 cm could be considered average, yeah?</br>  <br>That's incredibly sad and common on /a/.</br>  Is this the crossie thread?  <br> not being a slut <br> sad </br></br>  <br>There seems to be a lot of guys becoming wizards these day. So i don't really think its that uncommon.</br>  <br>That's what soon-to-be wizards tell themselves, yes. So, why did you decide to never have sex?</br>  <br>I'm a pretty pathethic guy, I watch anime/cartoons most of the day ,read manga, play video games, argue with you fags for hours about monster girls and power levels, make up excuses to not go to uni and even order most of my food.<br><br>I'm also very cute though, which has led to alot of dissappointments for women.</br></br></br>  <br> the first is either your worst or the best you'll come to relies that </br>  <br>Put that on your fucking tombstone you virgin. Hell let them say that at your funeral!!!!<br><br>YOU'RE PROBABLY THE OLDEST VIRGIN IN THIS THREAD!!!!</br></br></br>  <br>I looked it up, 14 is average.</br>  kuso thread.  Speaking as a 33 year old virgin, the whole wizard power thing is a lie. I waited all this time for nothing and now it's too late. I'm going to die a pathetic and unloved virgin.  <br>I'm a romantic who thinks sex should be saved till you're married and since I never found a girl that wasn't a whore, I just never bothered with it.</br>  <br>This, soon being a non-virgin will be uncommon</br>  <br> 14 is average <br>No wonder girls say that can't feel anything.</br></br>  <br> the whole wizard power thing is a lie <br>It's like believing in Santa.</br></br>  <br>31 wizard here. I had my chances and turn them all down, no regrets. All my high school buddies gave me shit but in the end I'm staying up tell 6am everyday drinking and watching anime while they deal with sleep depravity, get bitched at by their spouse, and deal with asshole little kids all day. I don't regret it one bit.</br>  <br>Which is interesting, because mouths are warm.<br>Thought about it for a second, and I think it might be because most of a person's body is lost through the head?</br></br>  I'm a 12 year old virgin, i'll probs die before I get to taste the y.delicious fluids of a woman's body.  <br>You're just doing it wrong. You don't know how to harness your power.</br>  <br>Sounds like you're really loose</br>  <br>I don't understand</br>  <br> I'm a romantic who thinks sex should be saved till you're married <br>The thing is, what if you're sexually incompatible? You have never been out there and experienced anything, you know nothing about how to please your woman and the wedding night is going to be awkward and sad.</br></br>  <br>Just like everything else in life. I'll deal with it if it ever happens.</br>  <br>Santa is a lie. Everyone past 5 knows it.</br>  I like feminine boys, they're easier to get than women and they are ool as guys so you can play games, eat and have your best friend as your fuckbuddy, also fucking a girly guy while pumping his dick is just pure bliss.<br><br>Get on my level you girlfags</br></br>    <br>I could understand if she was a mother who had born 4 children. The guy probably masturbated day and night and wasn't thinking. I get it, the real thing is underwhelming.</br>  <br>BECAUSE YOU ARE WATCHING A SERIES AIMED AT CHILDREN.<br>Stop watching Shounen series, watch Seinen.</br></br>  <br> /b/ <br> not-virgins </br></br>  <br>I don't think so.</br>    <br> 23 years old  <br> Never had sex <br> Masturbated a billion times  <br> Convinced I've ruined sex for myself </br></br></br></br>  <br>sounds like me, but the ruined sex part is bullshit.</br>  <br>Who gives a fuck, it's not like 3DPD has anything to offer.</br>  <br>i dont think this counts</br>    <br> I think it might be because most of a person's body is lost through the head <br>Okay that was really funny. <br><br>To answer your question, it only feels warm if your dick is feeling cold that day, since it's an extremity.<br>Even in that case the mouth will warm your dick up to the same temp within a few seconds.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Same but I'm only 20</br>  Join the army they said.<br>It'll be fun they said.</br>  Shooting cosplayers and fucking goth lolis sounds pretty fun to me.  <br>But the paperwork though.</br>  So when do the Americans join?  The army sucks dick, seriously, it's even worse without gothlolis and elves.  Down this 30 foot drop into shallow water where you'll die of pneumonia in a couple days if the fall doesn't get you.<br><br>Fuck you.</br></br>  <br>In manga he pushes her into the well just as the dragon swoops by and chomps his head.</br>  <br>He was just doing his bit to remove Elf</br>  <br>Is there any civilian eng/staff in this show?  need to selfinsert hard </br>  <br> This is your new home </br>  <br>During the 'back to Nipland' arc.</br>  <br>Shut up Trashman.</br>  <br>Well, rest was roasted to the ground and elf survived so there's that. <br>It might not look like a good idea but the alternative was certain death.</br></br>  <br>The only occasion they appear in the currently released Manga chapters is when they attempt to kidnap the girls when they visit Japan (So that they can coerce them into dealing with them ). In the end the kidnapping is prevented and a crapload of foreign agents (US, Chinese and Russian) get kicked out of the country.<br>They never appear again.<br>Unless a novelfag has spoilers for something ahead of the Manga.</br></br></br>  In this moment, I am truly happiest.    <br>It was literally the only safe place in the village, unfortunately elves don't build emergency underground shelters incase of dragon attack.<br>Also water was not shallow.</br></br>  <br>She was only floating a few inches from the bottom.</br>  his hair turned white? How? From the slaughter?  <br>HIS WAIFU IS DEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD</br>  <br> just as the dragon swoops by and chomps his head <br>Well about that</br></br>  <br>Common anime trope that extreme terror turns your hair white.</br>  <br> anime trope <br> anime <br>You need to widen your horizon. You are coming across as really uneducated.</br></br></br>  <br>The dragon wasn't supposed to show up for another 50 years, they were caught by surprise.</br>  <br>I was pretty disappointed at how they made him look like a whiny bitch instead of showing Pina threatening to burn his kingdom to the ground if he didn't give her info on the JSDF.</br>  Remember that in this, Japan:<br><br> offered a full cessation of hostilities and a return of valuable PoWs without the usual slave taking and crap, making the Empire think they will be merciful <br> in their very next sentence demanded reparations worth more than all the gold in the Empire, a sum that the Empire could never possibly pay back. <br><br> demanded and gained access to tracts of land that are rich in diamonds, signing an agreement to share the diamonds with the locals, as well as gold and silver. <br> didn't tell the local government about all the other valuable minerals that they could find there besides gold and silver, which could be worth billions back on Earth, so they could scam then out of it all without paying the locals a penny <br><br> after the negotiations and official cessation of hostilities, stumbled on some captured Japanese citizens in captivity, who they somehow they didn't already know were still unaccounted for and they never bothered to ask the Empire before then. <br> responded by bombing the Imperial Senate with JASDF fighters as a show of force with no warning, rather than going through diplomatic channels <br><br> violated Article 9 of their constitution by using JSDF to kill fire dragon and interfere with coup d'etat in foreign gateworld countries using an unconstitutional amendment to JSDF law of the kind that IRL a majority of the public is opposed to <br><br> decides that a policy of isolationism and alienating half the world is acceptable because they have a whole new world that they can rape for resources to become self sufficient </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Extreme situations can do this to people in real life.</br>  <br> anime trope that extreme terror turns your hair white. <br>Yeah, like that guy on "Ito" From Stephenu Kingu.</br></br>  Remember Kurokawa has sex with whores and she pay them in condoms and check ups   we haven't seen the real mastermind behind everything yet   <br>None of those actions are unreasonable.</br>  <br> slubunny <br> a mastermind <br>Anon pls stop trolling.</br></br></br>  <br>Or uncommon.</br>  <br>I thought they made it pretty clear that the only thing they and their allies wanted from the gateworld were natural resources, so I fail to see how this is a bad move on their part.</br>  <br>Of course it'll be fun anon their own recruitment propagan- I mean Patriotic Service Announcements say so. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mBi<wbr>cFXijh9s</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.youtube.co/watch?v=3V42<wbr>SyYYcvI<br>https://www.youtube.co/watch?v=U5nB<wbr>4PIl2cE<br><br>Also  it is your patriotic duty to protect Nippon from Chinese influence, the Special Region ain't gonna colonize itself! </br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welp, I never expected fantasy harem power wank story to display such realism as far as diplomacy is concerned.</br>  I want to fuck her, hard, and lovingly.  <br> fantasy harem power wank story <br><br>I have no idea what gave you that impression. Because there are female characters around the MC?</br></br></br>  <br>It's more of a modern weaponry wanking than harem wanking really.</br>    <br> Common anime trope that extreme terror turns your hair white. <br> Common anime trope <br>I see muricans do this to.</br></br></br>  <br> I am a serious soldier  <br> Just check out my bikini armor  <br> Please take me seriously </br></br></br>  <br>If you are hit by a torpedo while on a ship, and you are close enough to the source of the explosion, but survive it, then the shock will be powerful enough to actually make your hair go white.<br><br>It's a fact.</br></br></br>    <br>She actually is a decent soldier it's just that the anime makes her out to be a nice and innocent girl when she is actually pretty ruthless.</br>  <br>It has more to do with her being a lot more mellow in the anime compared to manga.</br>  <br> MC is otaku who happens to be special forces member and he gets covered in bitches  <br>I wonder. <br>It might not be the focus but you can't deny the overabundance of female creatures clinging to Itami.</br></br></br>  <br> It might not be the focus <br>Good point. So it's about something else then?</br></br>  <br>None of those girls is actually into him though, they just said that because they wanted to avoid any backlash from Bozes torturing Itami.</br>  <br>And then she hits him.<br><br>Pina simply has bad luck with this.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok. so let's fix that.<br> Welp, I never expected fantasy power wank story with harem elements that aren't the focus to display such realism as far as diplomacy is concerned. <br>Good enough or would you like me to use some other wording?</br></br></br>  Moe  <br>Over the course of several stressful years sure. Overnight, not really</br>  <br>I can imagine what is going on in her mind.</br>  <br>You might want to point out that it's written by a right wing nationalist.</br>  <br>Depends on the length, really.</br>  <br><br>Yea she should've known that Bozes had a short temper.<br>Though honestly Pina is also at fault since she decided to whore Bozes out just because she didn't wanna lower her head and apologize, ultimately they both suffer from being way too prideful just like all nobles do.</br></br></br>  <br>It can. I've read about one guy's biography who was a ship captain during WWII and had his ship hit by a torpedo.<br><br>His black hair turned white in an instant due to sheer shock caused by the experience.<br><br><br>On the other hand Itami himself is plagued by bad luck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I joined the army, but there were no qt girls, no gates, no goth lolis or elves or whatever the fuck lusting after my dick  <br>Why was she wearing that anyway?</br>  <br>Pride is one of the fatal flaws. Sometimes you have to swallow it and get your shit together.</br>  <br> His black hair turned white in an instant due to sheer shock <br>These records are all very old.<br><br>In reality it takes weeks at least.<br>The only way for hair to turn gray/white overnight is if you have mixed hair (main color plus gray/white) and then you lose your healthy hair.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You might want to read the rest of the comment you sperged about and notice the half assed series description wasn't the point.</br>  <br>Sucks to be you. I was doing cute chairforce things with my chairforce buddies while the grunts get smoked by their chief group.</br>  <br>Post more of the girl on the right</br>  <br>You are confusing Anonymous with Anonymous.<br>It's an easy mistake to make. We share the same non-name.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Look fags, it happens in anime, it's an anime trope. Happening in other mediums doesn't negate that. It's not an anime specific trope but it's an anime trope none the less.</br></br></br>  Do they rebuild that old man as Robocop?  <br>So who gave her that CBRN suit and why was she wearing that? Did someone tell her to do that?</br>  <br>All the rotting warriors on the former battle field spread hazardous gasses, bacteria and insects.</br>  <br>maybe she just wanted to have fun</br>  <br>And having noses is a Japanese trait.<br>It may be technically correct, but you are still coming across very uneducated.</br></br>  <br>/k/ get out</br>  Leilei is cute. CUTE!  <br>Tell that to all the nobles in the Empire, cause they all suffer from this shit.<br>Pina and Bozes only get over it after their trip to Japan.</br></br>    <br>In real life too people hair turn white during extreme stress, so if we follow your logic people dying is also an anime trope.</br>  <br>Yo, this is a huge change, how is it allowed?</br>  <br><br><br>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. anime whet</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, would stalker be the same with lolis?</br>  <br>Well, nothing is perfect.<br><br><br>I want it, but we need to be realistic here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If I recall, this isn't quite the case. Apparently, what really happens is that your hair falls out, and the only hair left afterwards is white hair.</br>  <br>While he may be special forces, he still performed the worst. He's also 33 years old, he never wants to work much and everything that has happened to him has been simply luck.<br><br>Also he only has two girls actually wanting his dick. Not a harem at all.</br></br></br>  <br>What a cop out, other anonymous. I was hoping to sling some insults in the general direction of that different anonymous but now you took all the joy from it.</br>  <br>I feel like her actually walking around a hazardous area could have been shown, the mask used as a running gag after all.</br>  <br>She understands the suit can protect her from danger, so obviously someone gave it to her, briefly explained its purpose and showed her how to put it on. But why? And why did she think it might be dangerous?</br>  <br>Because they wanna give her an innocent and kawaii image for people to fawn over, instead of representing the ruthless and perverted person that she really is.</br>  <br> wearing nbc stuff <br> having fun <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone has noses.

Are you saying those maids are into the MC?</br>  <br>What else are they going to sanitize and simplify for the audience?<br><br>Replaced more world building infodumps with an anime-original bathing scene in the recent episode.<br><br>Notably, mentioning the fact that the dragons they were harvesting scales and claws off of were just "target practice" for the JSDF, or that the reason they wanted to harvest them in the first place was because it was a viable and major source of income. Which segued directly into Itami's sudden mission to Itasca being due to being given orders to assist in helping the refugees establish a currency (the last bit not being really mentioned at the end of the episode).<br><br>So really, among other things, I expect Tyuule's hard sex scene to be replaced with whipping and beating, and if they get far enough, her intended gang-rape scene changed to her going S&amp;M on the would-be torturers, and at the end, get injured but live and get a Furuta happy end.<br><br>Noriko will also have been whipped and tortured rather than a rape victim.<br><br>Kuri's beating up of Zorzal's guards and Zorzal himself will be entirely off-screen with full sound effects while the camera pans to all the horrified expressions of the Imperials present, only showing her gun firing the short time she uses it.<br><br>The hot springs episode will cut out most of the early CIA vs JSDF bits in favor of more panning of the girls while they're bathing or half-drunk, as well as focusing more on Rory while the fight is going on in the 3-way melee.<br><br>About the only scenes I expect them to keep is Delilah's backstory (censored and implied since it's just short flashbacks) as well as the prostitute bit (their sheer clothes censored to full opaque).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yea I expected them doing shit like that, just like how they've toned down on the violence and how they'll probably cut the rape as well, but honestly I find them butchering Pina's personality pretty disgusting.</br>  <br>It's not even that common in anime.

That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make anime out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just the fact  she indirectly made Itami immortal with her blood pact and her wanting to spend the next 40 years until she transcends to godhood with him among her other character traits just makes her fucking perfect <br><br>If Rory loses I'll be very surprised</br></br></br>  <br>She is pretty great.</br>  <br>Really great.</br>  <br>You know, the US army has a bad habit of getting into sticky situations, doesn't it?</br>  Will you give her your daikon?  <br>Simply the best.</br>  <br> draw the wheel away from the ground <br>Nice, now it's floating.<br> add a tiny tiny arrow that is barely recognizable as such <br>What's the bike standing on?</br></br></br></br>  <br> otaku, ranger, with his own hiki waifu that happens to acquire loli demigod and showers in attention of monster girls and other female beings while using genius elf mage like a pillow <br> not wish fulfillment <br>heh</br></br></br>  <br>almost anything would be wish fulfillment according to you<br><br>next!</br></br></br>  <br>The whole "losing your humanity" deal worries me.

Bozes sheer nightgown will be made plain opaque toga and less revealing. Same for the prostitute attire.<br><br>3. Catgirls and bunny girls will be more kemonomini than slightly furry. Sole exception is Deer girl.<br><br>4. Emperor's spiel aimed at Imperial Japan omitted in favor of expanded anime-original content involving a longer earthquake scene (Akusho, Alnus, and Itasca). May also cut into Kuri's one-sided assault on Zorzal's guards, if not also her one-sided assault on Zorzal.<br><br>5. Cutting out other infodumps and plot build up in order to animate the 4-komas into the main story, such as catgirl Meia's hiring and working at Alnus civilian PX store, Myuute's work ethic and unexpected singing, and the usual misadventures of Rory, Leilei, Tuka, Pina, and Bozes (the former 3 over figmas and bicycle riding, the latter 2 during baseball and ping-pong).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kamikoda is a glorious bastard</br>  <br>You know, you don't have to post if you don't have any counter arguments besides 'it isn't so because I said so'.</br>  <br>Basically, she won't be able to feel.<br><br>She won't be able to feel emotion anymore, be it love or lust.<br><br>She wants to become the deity of love when she transcends so maybe she'll get some sort of cop out/asspull that will allow her to retain her ability to feel emotion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only she would become tall and busty in the process.</br>  <br> Basically, she won't be able to feel. <br> She won't be able to feel emotion anymore, be it love or lust. <br>Like Itami said, then what's the fucking point<br>I feel bad for him once he's trapped with her for eternity.</br></br></br></br>  Is it just me or are the anime designs way better than the manga designs?<br><br>Pinya made my dick diamonds as soon as she appeared on screen in the anime, but her manga design is lacking.</br></br>  <br>fucking racist torpedos</br>  <br><br>I don't really think it would be an asspull seeing as Hardy, a current God, desires to make Rory her wife even though she isn't supposed to have said desires or feelings.</br></br>  <br>I disagree.</br>  <br>The point is to make the most of the time she has left where she can still feel and express those emotions.<br><br>Like I said though, I expect, or rather hope, she'll get an asspull/change of script of some sort where she retains that ability.</br></br></br>  I know that a lot of stuff in the manga can't be on tv , but I really don't understand what this director is trying to do.<br> serious political scene <br> Japanese PM getting grilled by reporters <br> several days later, in the special region, bath scene! </br></br></br>   Centurions riding on tanks while holding their banners. <br><br> Vanguard taking a page from VC2's Fencers and providing anti-arrow defense for gunners. <br><br>I didn't realize how much I want this to be animated.

If so then that may be when Guts gets off the boat.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12855175 <br>Fucking nips and their noble ways</br>  <br>The hundred pages was refresher</br>  <br><br>The holy trinity?<br><br>Santa<br>Jesus<br>Ronald Reagan</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ronald Reagan </br>   Rickert repairs a firefighting machine <br><br>This is called Chekov's Gun.

He's not in Falconia.<br><br>Prediction: He's leading the assault on Elf Island.</br></br>  <br> Griffith is already on the top, what does he gain from more sacrifices? <br><br>Strong hints and shit say Griffith = Anti-Christ and that he and/or God Hand want to bring about the end of the world.</br></br></br>  <br><br>This shit is WAY more interesting than anything that has been happening on the boat. I sped through Sea God arc and was bored by it all. No drama and it has no bearing on the over all plot. Falconia stuff is great. We're seeing Silat play a major role in the story for once, Rickert is in danger, and Rashkas is gonna fuck things up.</br></br>  <br>Sea God was character development (JRPG party leveling up) and posed more questions about The Boy. <br><br>It was satisfying for me.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The main conflict was Mermaid girl, the Island and the fight with Sea God. I cared for none of it. It wasn't very good horror, and the interactions between Isidro and Mermaid girl were boring. Whole thing felt like filler or padding out the story and isn't needed.</br></br>  When was the last time someone was raped?  <br>When did this last hiatus start</br>  <br>One whole year of no Berserk is rape.</br>  <br> wanting anyone else in Guts party to suffer as the band did </br>  <br>This is a popular misconception. The Devil doesn't want to bring the end of the world. In fact, he is against it.</br>  Griffith wants to be the hero of his own story so much, it's cute. I hope he kills Guts and that scheming sandnigger so he can happily lead his big family to peace and prosperity.  Berserk Saga part 2 when?<br>Even though they fucked up a few things in the Golden Arc I want the Black Swordsman arc animated</br>  <br>It just came out today. I'm impressed someone gave a huge fuck and uploaded ASAP.<br><br>I don't mind waiting for a new chapter.  I'm slightly behind anyways </br></br></br>   new Berserk chapter <br> new Farmland Saga chapter <br>Oh i love this</br></br>  <br><br>Movies bombed HARD. We're never gonna get more. They may have not broken even.</br></br>  <br>Disagree. You could say the same about most of Enoch.</br>  <br> Reincarnation of evil <br> Happy ending </br></br>  <br>Why can't a competent animation studio just pick up from where the TV show left off and keep doing its thing? I want out of the Golden Age.</br>  <br>Maybe one day after the manga ends.<br> Hahahahahahah. </br></br>  <br>Why is she so fucking cute? I can't stand it.</br>  <br>It was truly magnificent. Seeinjg the humans working together with the apostles was really something special, and it'll be really hard to see that stuff happening again in such a massive scale. It was also the conflict where Irvine showed his apostle form for the first time, which was awesome.</br>  <br>Ok, I don't get why literally everyone on /a/, or in fact even in my real life friends say Berserk is godly.<br><br>At first I though it was it was created a long time ago, thus human minds automatically think "Old but Gold", but then I started hearing more and more about it and I began reading.<br><br>I honestly on't see the appeal, like help me out here. I think it's just an edgelord manga with things not for the faint of heart thus 4chan likes it. I can't see passed the yelling, raging and bullshit that goes on, easily avoidable situations plays out so stupidly. Is there something i'm missing? Aside from that the art is just glorious, I feel that's the only main appeal to this edgelord manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The next time we'll see squads of human soldiers and apostles fighting together in formation is when Guts storms Falconia for whatever reason.<br><br>Hawk Lancers riding tamed griffons with a flying apostle captain, backed up by human archers and perhaps a sorcerer or two calling the spirits of the fallen to attack directly or possess footsoldiers to empower them. Shit's gonna be legendary.</br></br></br>  <br>We haven't seen necromancers yet have we?</br>  <br>Guts was doing the hot apostle that killed Corkus in the very first chapter.<br><br>Which begs the question: which apostle or astral creature in this series would you want to make your monster waifu?<br><br>Personally I wouldn't mind making the pseudo harpy with owl eyes for tits apostle my monstergirl waifu.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isma is important. Next party member and waifu.<br><br>I have to imagine the next time we see Guts, they are getting off the boat.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to see Apostles get fucked up. Especially the ones that took Guts' arm and eye. <br><br>I also really want to know what more of the sane apostles sacrificed. I consider Ganishka a sane one. He sacrificed a human and was the most powerful one to date, could the others have sacrificed something not human like the egg?</br></br></br>  <br>Berserk takes a very appealing concept and spins it into a well crafted story with a core cast of well developed and well used characters.<br><br>But that's just my opinion. The series may just not be for you. To me it seems you're just lookingat it with an overly cynical eye, trying to find things not to like, but that's just my owm bias speaking. There's really no such thing as a perfect story that everyone likes, so if you just don't like it don't waste time dwelling on it.<br><br><br>Not really. One of Schierke's spells called on a spirit associated with battlefields and death I think, and there's Griffith's communion with the dead, and the effect the brand has on spirits, but no straight up raising a corpse army as of yet.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Borkoff is a neo hawk so yeah.<br><br>And it's possible other apostles sacrificed something not human. I think the only real requirement is that it has to be of great value to you. Something that's like cutting out a part of yourself and offering it up.<br><br>That said, humans have been involved in every sacrifice. Even Egg's "world" included the people gathered at Albion in the deal. Though none of them were branded directly, they were indirectly sacrificed.<br><br>Ganishka sacrificed his son whom he barely knew, but I think he still loved his son as he saw a lot of himself in him (which is partly why he feared him.)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judging that last we heard they were making great headway toward Skellig Isle thanks to their mermaid escort, I'd say so.</br>  Humans and apostles working together under Griffith just pissed me the fuck off and made me hate that retard Sonia. Jesus Christ, I want Sonia to try and lecture Guts and he just gives her a backhand.It'll probably be Scheirke to do that anyway. I just want pages of Guts fucking shit up and everyones jaws dropping because of a human swordsman doing this. I just love that shit.<br><br>God it pissed me off. Apostles are fucking evil pieces of shit that lust for human blood. How does Griffith plan to suppress that? Just kill every apostle? We have never seen a Godhand kill an apostle have we? Ganishka wasnt really killed per se was he? I wonder what the policy is with Godhand and dealing with apostles. Apostles can kill apostles but are Godhand allowed to kill apostles? I really wonder how apostle transformations will work now that the Godhand are in the world. Just create a separate dimension for it to be done?</br></br>  <br>Apostles aren't mindless.monsters. They are capable of holding back. Many have even been shown capable of love, happiness, regret and compassion and a whole LOT of fear. They aren't rabid beasts, they're more like sociopaths.<br><br>Keeping them in line shouldn't be too hard. You just have to establish a power structure and give them something to fear. They rightly fear Femto and see him as their patron and God. Not only that, but the most loyal apostles are also the strongest. You saw what Zodd did to Wyald. Apostles fear death and openly defying Godhand Femto is too dangerous to do on a whim.<br><br>With that in mind, he is also placating their lust for violence with a gladiatorial arena for them to fight and rip and tear and soak in the suffering.<br><br>I imagine those that just aren't fit to hang out in Falconia are sent off on missions outside of Falconia often, much as Wyald was kept busy in other lands and remote areas when he bent knee to Midland as a knight.<br><br>That answer your question?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Could be. If there's an assault on Elfhelm I'm also sure Zodd would be part of it. He's always involved in the critical missions.<br><br><br>I also think there will also be another huge battle as epic and massive as the final Ganishka battle, this time involving the astral creatures in Fantasia. <br><br>I don't quite see Guts leading such an army though, doesn't seem his thing. One thought that occurred to me is that just maybe the SkullKnight might. He seems to have a bigger connection, however strong with the astral ever since the days he was alive. He used the Berserk armor created by dwarves; he knows quite well the Elf king and elven places in general; and Flora was for him much like Shierke is to Guts, so another window to understand the astral. He seems more aligned for such a task all things considerd me thinks.<br><br> Hawk Lancers riding tamed griffons with a flying apostle captain, backed up by human archers and perhaps a sorcerer or two calling the spirits of the fallen to attack directly or possess footsoldiers to empower them. Shit's gonna be legendary. <br><br>I think Zodd would possibly lead a flying apostle force, much like he did against Ganishka in Vritannis. He's the strongest flying apostle after all. As for necromancers, while not necessarily as in the art of ressurecting or summoning the undead, on the second chapter of the manga we see Guts battling dead corpses, but just possessed by wicked spirits it seems. Just similar effect. Also, skeletons raised in Fantasia (pic related).<br><br>Personally, I'd like to see Locus and his demon Lancer division pitted on the battlefield against an equal number of awesome Dullahan lancer knights, like this guy in the same pic. Btw, is there anyone else who also wants this same guy to become an actual character in the story?<br><br>And REAL dragons against the flying apostles, while Irvine and his Archer division try to shoot them down from the ground in a massive chaos fuck. Hell yes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, fuck apostles. I want Guts to rip them to shreds and stick the DS up their ass.</br>  <br>Also Ganishka was most certainly killed, though not directly by Femto. The wings of darkness manipulated spacetime and redirected the Skull Knight's slash to split Ganishka's vulnerable human core in two. There's no two ways about it, the Kushan Emperor is dead.<br><br>I don't know if the Godhand can execute apostles as they wish. I would assume so, as I've seen nothing to suggest otherwise. Apostles are.told to do as they will, I would assume it's much the same for the angels of the Godhand, except they are usually locked in the nexus and their ability to directly influence the mortal realm is limited.<br><br>Also I would assume the Godhand can still be summoned. the behelit should still work.

For that reason I enjoyed it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So what i guess are 'filler' or side show episodes are fun but not the plot or character interaction?</br></br>  which shipgirls would you want to make a mothership?  <br>Not Tenryuu</br>  <br>Kaga-san</br>  <br>I did it.</br>  <br>Zuihou!</br>  I remember when Akagi was the fatty.  <br>Well I mean the curry episode just stood out above the rest since I wouldnt have needed a hang over to enjoy it. Its about the fleet holdng a contest to see who makes the best curry and Nagato is the judge. Follows Loli Division 6 as they try to be the underdogs rising to first place against the odds. <br><br>The rest of it is not anything too special, but like I said its a good show for if you just need to watch something you hold no expectations for because thinking is too much effort in your current state. Which is why its my favorite hangover anime.</br></br></br>  well someone on the anime staff clearly wants bucky.  <br>That disgusting lower abs</br>  Daijoubu  Is Re legal  <br>If Houshou-san was my mother, things would be different here.</br>  Isokaze is doing things to me again!

However, like many have said, the curry content episode was enjoyable despite being halfway through the show. The final sortie (last two episodes) is drawn out and it gets seriously dumb by the time it's finally over. <br><br>Overall, it's mediocre, I wouldn't recommend it unless you absolutely are dying for more KanColle material. Also, you'll mostly only see characters from CarDiv1, CarDiv5, DesDiv6, Kongou and Sendai class, and the main three (Fubuki, Yuudachi, Mutsuki). Most of the other girls are rarely relevant and you either see them infrequently or not at all.<br><br>I would recommend downloading the OST, however. Miiro and Fubuki are absolutely fantastic.

Turning to the bottle night after night.</br>  <br> They wanna remake Midway so they don't fail horribly <br> They *still* don't decide to concentrate their forces in Ep 11 and abandon Operation AL so the squadrons aren't all separated from each other and leave all their main carriers exposed <br> They didn't nag Shokaku or Zuikaku to hurry and get fucking ready and participate too <br><br>i thought the people that made this game/show were military otaku</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if we'll ever get any more loli bosses, hopefully in the next event.</br>  <br>Well, I did it.</br>  <br>The people who made the anime didn't even fucking do the AL/MI event.</br>  <br>The devs know their shit, it's just that the animation studio was crap.</br>  <br> no one ever sinks   after Kisaragi <br> curry contest <br> Fubuki does squats and oatz to get Kai <br> shoehorning characters <br> the entire battle of Midway is changed thanks to   Fubuki changing their fates <br><br>I don't know what to tell you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Protect Zuihou!  <br>Ay yo turkey quit talkin' mad shit<br>just cuz yo big ass sister was taking your hits.<br>I was first in the flames<br>I'm the phoenix in the fire<br>You just a bird witout wings<br>in a mother fucking pyre<br>Before you get real proud of a career's worth of blootin'<br>You had best pretend you were a carrier worth shootin'</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to hug Tenryuu and tell her how much I love her</br>  <br>Nice, I was hoping someone would come up with an ingenious rap response. That was great.</br>  <br>Rap owns. Kendrick Lamar is GOAT. Post approved.</br>  <br>They didn't even bother coming up with a reason for why they had to recreate Midway. The official purpose for the operation was to learn more about the Abyssal's origins and objectives, but none of them seemed to give a shit about the first one they found that could talk. They could have skipped the entire fight if it was so dangerous. It's not like we ever saw or heard of them posing an immediate threat to anyone. The Abyssals did nothing wrong; they only ever defended themselves.</br>  <br>Well the whole shoehorning Fubuki to be Akagi's destroyer seemed to make sense, seeing how IRL Fubuki was apparently Yamato's escort. With the whole butterfly effect and all that, maybe Admiral-san is the genre-savvy god-head that tried to change things from the very beginning.<br>And yet Akagi is the one that has freaky premonitions...</br></br>  would you do a lewd army dog?  <br>Akaga a shit.<br>Dragons a shit.<br><br>Seriously, they deserved their firey death near Midway atoll.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When I said shoehorning, I meant more of Taihou showing up to send out some planes and say "BTW TTK IS OK" and then do absolutely nothing else. What was the point?<br><br>Fubuki showing up to prevent Akagi from sinking was to be expected. As soon as we saw the premonition, there was no doubt some greater force would prevent it from happening. That force being Fubuki throughout the entire series.</br></br></br>  <br>It's a shame that they focused so much on the battles. All of them were boring but at least the ones in the earlier episodes didn't bothered me that much since they weren't the focus of the episode. That completely ruined the last 2 episodes.</br>  <br> Kancolle <br> small c <br><br><br><br>Absolutely not.<br><br><br> Episode 6 <br> fun <br>So are kangaroo courts I guess.<br><br><br> I wouldn't recommend it unless you absolutely are dying for more KanColle material. <br>I would not recommend it even if you are.<br><br><br><br>Fubuki did nothing wrong.<br><br><br>Shoukaku</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The Abyssals did nothing wrong. <br>What were the right thing they did?</br></br>  <br>Would rape her into oblivion</br>  <br> Fubuki did nothing wrong. <br>Fubuki a shit, she's only ok when she's on crack</br></br>  <br>Sink Kisaragi</br>  <br> inb4 but Kisaragi didn't sink </br>  <br>Becoming my cumpdumpsters.</br>  <br>The problem is that Tanaka/Diomedea was never prepared for (and could never have made) a serious plot that would compromise some of the deliberate ambiguity they've fostered for the benefit of the doujin community. They didn't try to do any worldbuilding, anything about the abyssals, or anything about the shipgirls themselves outside of vague premonitions of events that were already confirmed via shipgirl memories canonically, which means the end result was so safe it was sickening. People may not like the Shimakaze doujin, but at least it's trying something different--it shows a little of what's going on in the world immediately outside that of the immediate shipgirls. At that manga's Admiral has a face.<br><br>I really don't like the idea that they make a pure SoL or comedy, but if they want to make a serious plot they're going to have to take a risk, like the LN series and some of the Manga.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You guys are real crazy.</br></br>  They're liking chinese kancolle, heh.<br>http://may.2chan.net/b/res/34616537<wbr>3.htm</wbr></br>  <br>Does Ritou count as a loli or what?</br>  <br>Rap is a shipgirl's soul.</br>  <br>They're for passionate sex.<br><br>Kaga is the new idol of the fleet.</br></br></br>  <br> They didn't nag Shokaku or Zuikaku to hurry and get fucking ready and participate too <br>I stand corrected<br>Fuckinnn magic</br></br></br>  <br>At least for me, a loli is a girl who looks 12 or younger, Ritou looks about 14 so she's not a loli like Hoppou.

I'll translate one chapter then</br>  <br>Surely there's an atago one of that</br>  <br>Okay, have fun at the fireworks.</br>  Three battleships  <br><br><br>it seems to be a common issue.</br></br></br>  <br> no childhood friend <br> no traditional outfit <br> no loveinterest <br><br>for what purpose?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no loveinterest <br>To find one</br></br>  <br>Makes me sad about the flat carriers.</br>   Poi   <br>Would just get ntr by me.</br>  <br>Oh you silly guy</br>  <br>I hope you find a good man</br>  <br>I want to cuddle the fluffy.</br>  <br>None cares about Akagi anymore.</br>  <br>I'd like for Unryuu and I to rub our bare feet together while we cuddle.</br>  goodnight /∀/   actual taste <br>what is this place</br>  <br>Personally I wouldn't want to do the feet rubbing thing, but that's because my feet are gross. But cuddling and maybe rubbing legs would be nice.</br>  <br>I'm sure all the players that just finished B10 care deeply about her and the bauxite that seems to have disappeared.</br>  <br> Kaga present but not spammed <br> no Ooi spam  <br> tasteful waifus being posted  <br><br>This is an unusually good thread.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>try donning a sidetail, Akagi</br>    <br>Sharpen your eyes a little</br>  <br>What an upgrade.

If Unryuu is the fluffiest/comfiest CV, who else would be in your fluffy/comfy fleet?  <br> useless <br>I guess you dont want shinano then, shame on you.<br>Also define "useless".</br></br></br>  <br>But she is hai hai</br>  <br>Agano's tummy looks like it would be soft and comfy.</br>  <br>Ushio<br>Atago<br>Kaga<br>Agano<br>Unyruu<br>Iku</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Agano.</br>  <br>Hatsuharu and Murakumo for sure, those three comes to mind when I think of fluffy.</br>  <br>The Agano sisters would be good for a fluffly fleet, choose one or all. Tenryuu too. Souryuu could be a good choice for second CV too. <br><br>Who is the comfiest/fluffiest battleship, though?</br></br></br>  <br>Hotel.</br>  <br>You mean the Inn</br>  Which girls would look good on the dancefloor?  <br>An hotel is obviously more comfortable than an inn.</br>    <br>Mykaze.</br>    <br>I want a story about her losing both legs and how she deals with the fact that she will never dance again.</br>  Shibafu's art style is best art style.  <br>Is Sakawa fluffy?</br>  <br>A best!<br><br>I realize there is an increase of artists who getting quite close to the Shibafu style. <br><br>Which is quite the mix between 80's, Fumikane and a quite unique way of coloring.</br></br></br></br></br>  why do people forgets bauxite queen so easily  <br>The pride of the Agano class heavy cruisers.</br>  <br>heavy light cruisers, you mean.</br>  <br>No, but she's super cute.</br>  <br> smile </br>  <br>Something is wrong with her left foot</br>  <br><br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>You're a horrible person.</br>  <br> dat flaming bandana tail </br>  <br>She broke it, it's her damaged art after all.</br>  What's the most adorable ship class? Yasen? Brain problem sisters? Heaviest light cruisers (and their cute little sister)?  <br>Okay, one lost leg is enough.</br>    Why won't MC just rape the smugness out of Takagi?   MC cums inside her <br> "guess you'll have to take responsibility now" <br> shotgun wedding <br> forced to take up two jobs <br> MC is miserable while Takagi leeches him for life and divorced him when he goes bankrupt <br><br>It's all part of the plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Latest Release(s) : 160d ago   <br>The scanslators are lazy fucks. Still waiting High Score Girl from them.</br>  <br>well hes the one tied up, that isn't quite how rape works</br>  <br> High Score Girl  <br>Nah, I'd rather it just end where the english translations stop. Why continue only to be stuck in a middle of another arc forever?</br></br>  I finally started watching this, /a/, after hearing people say for ages how it's better than 'Z'. Three seasons in so far and...<br>What the fuck, this is kinda boring. Goku never has ANY sort of challenge. None of the fights have been interesting, none of the tasks he has to perform seem hard and there's no suspense.<br>I'd would say this show was designed for a younger demographic than even 'Z' if not for all the adult jokes.<br>The jokes, while initially funny, get old after a while.<br><br>PS, why is Goku's penis shown so much?</br></br></br></br></br>  naked boys are funny?<br><br>idk it's been a while since I've seen the original show</br></br>  <br>Being better than DBZ doesn't mean that it's a masterpiece.</br>  DBZ is literally only fighting and training, and every arc unfolds in the same damn way every time. <br><br>DB is a lot better mostly because it focuses more on adventure. Also, the fights are more interesting to me because they don't feel as worn out.</br></br>  <br> DB is a lot better mostly because it focuses more on adventure <br>I can see why that's the case, but the fact that episodes have to be 20 minutes long really ruins the adventuring side of it for me.<br><br> Also, the fights are more interesting to me because they don't feel as worn out. <br>Do they ever get any better than "watch Goku get confused for a second before deciding he wants to win and subsequently winning without effort"?<br>Like I said, only up to season 3.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  People who say that Dragon Ball is better than Z are hipsters who haven't watched the Red Ribbon Saga recently. <br><br>It gets much better and stays that way when the 22nd Tenkaichi Budokai starts. It'll still drag on though (like any serial manga adaptation by Toei), it's too bad Kai skipped it. You should read the manga if you're not really adverse to it, it's much better.</br></br>  <br>b- but i liked Red Ribbon Saga<br><br>I think a big part of what makes Dragon Ball appealing is that Toriyama has a lot fresher designs for what the bad guys and monsters look like. As Z gets on everything becomes humanoid and repetitive, so it loses a bit of that fun atmosphere.<br><br>I mean, half the fun of these shows is just watching the main character beat up wacky-looking monsters/robots/demons/aliens</br></br></br></br></br>  Crotch-patting never got old, unexpectedly.  Is this an accurate depiction of a vicious vampire?  <br>Of courshe.</br>  Shinobu is nightmare fuel.  I am trembling in fear just looking at this image.  <br>what kind of monster are you, thats gruesome<br>mods pls</br></br>  <br>How can anyone stand to watch that garbage?

Even the 3D ones.  <br>No, it's a shitty moeblob and pedoshit bait.</br>  <br>The best vampires are the ones you let your guard down around.</br>  Is this not a vampire?  On occasion.  <br><br>People don't watch either show for cute.</br></br>  <br> mfw my imouto is a vampire </br>  <br>You know what you must do.</br>  <br>I watch it for the dialogue.</br>    <br> How can anyone stand to watch that garbage?

Is this an accurate depiction of a top tier waifu?  <br>No but this is</br>  <br><br><br><br>Only if you enjoy immature and needlessly violent idiots.<br><br>Shinobu a real top-tier. Supports you in your fights. Encourages you to better yourself. Explains her intentions when they aren't understood. Doesn't try to take your thunder when she thinks you can handle something, even though not helping means she suffers more. Plus, if you give her enough blood you can pick which maturity setting you like the most for sex.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't eat the bait anon.</br>  <br><br>Depends if you count that as a full vampire due to the depowering.</br></br>    The cutest vampire.  <br>DollxBat doujin when</br>  <br><br> ononoki goes down on shinobu <br> shinobu loving it <br> ononoki starts fingering shinobu <br> shinobu squirms in pleasure <br> ononoki says "Unlimited Rulebook" <br> shinobu is kill </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Was my story too erotic?</br></br>    <br>That looks delicious.</br>      JESUS FUCKING CHRIST<br><br> in a shinobu thread <br> my shinobu fig gets delivered way ahead of schedule </br></br></br>  <br>post better pics</br>  <br><br>If my Camera could transfer massive size into quality I would.

Wont be pulling her out for awhile either so can't post pics of her out of box. I'll post her in a later Shinobu thread when I'm pulling her out.<br><br>Sorry, all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>how about focusing the damn thing?</br>  <br><br>She's contemplated sucking your blood.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=O0m<wbr>cAL8oBk8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It doesn't work that way. That IS focused. The box material itself just fucks it up.</br></br>  got some figs  <br>If you spent some time learning how to use the camera properly instead of shitting into jugs, maybe we wouldn't be making fun of you. <br><br>But you haven't, so we are.</br></br></br>  <br><br>You're hardly making fun of me. You're just whining that my phone camera doesn't produce gold.</br></br>  <br>Very much so</br>  Can't wait for Comiket and a first PV.  <br>reminder that she has bigger boobs than cat</br>  <br>Reminder that she would still be more attractive that cat even if she didn't have bigger boobs.</br>  P3 Dio vs Alucard - who wins?  <br> she would still be more attractive <br>Her whole fucking kingdom killed themselves because of how pretty and lovely she was.</br></br>  <br>I thought that her beauty was just portrait-of-her-in-every-home tier and it was her whole "inner beauty" that made a mountain of corpses from people who felt unworthy to live in her presence.</br>  <br>Well yeah, that's why I said she was pretty and 'lovely'. That's the 'inner beauty' part.</br>  <br><br>There is also a part in the LN where she<br><br> loses the link with Araragi and reverts to her Kiss-shot form, however in the end she chooses to have the link repaired so she'll be able to be with him and protect him till the end of time <br><br>Gotta be hard for Hitagi to know his boyfriend is a Lolicon who carries a sexycute loli in his shadow 24/7.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Alucard </br>  <br>He´s not wrong though.

I have a date with my boyfriend tonight.</br>  Sup guys.  <br>Sup</br>  We need more vampires in anime.  <br>At being a horrible character who steals from kids because he is an edgelord and bored?<br><br>You betcha, he is a bad guy all along, unless you trust someone who lied to you several times, you have to be litterally retarded here or incredible naive and dumb person.<br><br>Its like beliving in a politican who lied to you several times.<br><br>People are glad he is dead because he stole money from people for his own selfish reasons, he just broke up hitagis family for fun as evident by hitagi wanting to kill him for it.<br><br><br>and still does, most likely they killed nadeko or got gaen to exorcist nadeko after they beat the shit out of her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Karen-chan, back to bed!</br>  <br>You haven't read/watched the whole thing, have you? Even the anime shows that Kaiki had reasons other than just trying to dick people over.</br>  <br>what episode did she wear that first?</br>  <br>No he didnt, show me where where he isnt the narrator/liar.<br><br><br>You never have a reason to do what he did.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Taking Karen-chan seriously. <br>TopKek.</br></br>  <br>People hate him for a reason, I mean would you let someone fuck your mother aswell to break up your family if she is in a cult instead of you and the authorities try to help her?</br>  <br>I've been internetless for about 2 years, did the Kizu movie come out yet?</br>  <br>Holy Donuts Trinity</br>  <br> using the smug face plates <br>Excellent taste.</br></br>  <br>Whats wrong with stealing from children? are you a bigot against butt boy here who defends his homosexual clown boyfriend?</br>  When Araragi has sex with Shinobu, it must be mind blowing  <br>Faggot</br>  <br>That's a faggot.</br>  <br> They both feel the pleasure from the other on top of their own <br> This causes the pleasure to magnify for each which only continues to be shared <br> They both cum within seconds of starting. </br></br></br>  <br>Good thing they are vampires so they can go again and again.</br>  <br> vampire regeneration means they can keep going for hours regardless </br>  <br>Ask again when it's 2017</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br><br>It actually seems like to me that only she gets the shared feelings and emotions, he never seems to get them from her or realize it even exists unless she mentions it.<br><br>The real questions come from stuff like does getting a blowjob from her make her feel like she's getting a phantom dick sucked.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hating fun </br>  <br><br>That doesn't answer my question though.</br></br>  <br>You didn't ask a question.</br>  <br><br>Does having her suck your dick make her feel like she's getting a phantom dick sucked?</br></br>  <br>Go back to jerking off dolphins, Jotaro.</br>  <br> start to stick it in her <br> she starts laughing maniacally with a voice deeper and more masculine than yours </br></br>  <br>1:53<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=D84<wbr>MoMloGv8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  Why is Karen such a degenerate?  <br>SEMEN DEMON<br>E<br>M<br>E<br>N<br><br>D<br>E<br>M<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes. Now we need to exterminate both her and that hamster from another show airing this season.</br>  <br>He sounds like a horrible character.<br><br><br>Well both are genocidal maniacs.<br><br>She killed her followers, then from what ive understand from /a/, killed of all of humanity because she was angry.<br><br><br>She might be attractive, but she is an unkind person...since you know, she exterminated the whole fucking human race?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you haven't watched a series don't try to discuss it you fucking retard.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128546205 <br>KAREN-CHAN PLEASE GO</br>  <br> based nakata </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128546205 <br>You straight-up admitted you haven't seen the source material. Now fuck off until you know what you're even trying to discuss.</br>      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128546507 <br><br>If you watch the anime you'll realize why Kaiki did what he did, and he is actually a pretty good guy.<br><br>If you watch the anime you'll realize that Shinobu didn't kill all of humanity just because she felt bad, and it was a very particular set of circumstances in an alternate universe.<br><br>If you don't watch the anime, don't try telling people they don't know what they're talking about, because they're probably just trying to keep from spoiling it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Definitely.</br>  <br>The most vicious of them all</br>    <br>Truly a terror.</br>  <br><br>It honestly should be illegal to make a character as perfect as Shinobu. How are real women supposed to compete with her?<br><br>No wonder the Japs aren't breeding.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lolis are for faggots</br>  <br>Nothing is too precious to sacrifice in the pursuit of perfection. The Japanese birth rate is an acceptable casualty.</br>  <br><br>I just hope they don't die out before I'm gone. How are we supposed to enjoy our chinese cartoons if they stop making them!?</br></br>  <br>If they die out it will be because they have reached the pinnacle of what they were capable of handling.</br>  <br><br>If they die out then that simply means we will need to breed a new race to create our anime. Imagine what could happen when gene splicing becomes more viable. We could have people that never die who make anime forever.<br><br>A true utopia for all. Except the slave race.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Before they dissapear they'll just built robots and super computers that can make the best chinese cartoons imaginable. It will be glorious.</br>  <br>Oh yeah. AI has been getting good lately hasn't it.</br>        <br><br><br><br>  Razor sharp sword underneath her hair. <br>  Moves sword, cuts off all hair. <br><br>Stupid picture is stupid.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thats smug</br>  Who do I go for if I want to watch Tsukimonogatari?<br><br> http://pastebin.com/bqJqpP57 <br>Says to wait for Commie, although their website doesn't say they're working on it.<br><br>I'm guessing just watch the coalgirls sub?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Crunchyroll, nigga.</br></br>  <br><br>Coalgirl sub was pretty damn good. No complaints here.</br></br>  <br>No he wasn't, there was no indication for that. What source are you using as narrator?</br>  <br>In short, he was just doing it for the same reason he stole from those kids, he was bored. Infact if you look at the person who is telling that information, its that doll girl, but she has no way of knowing that, he even stated that outright.<br><br>Even without hearing his fake voice, you can tell he was lying about that aswell in terms of narration. A liar that is lying? such a suprise.<br>He's the worst villian of anime in the decade with no personality or character. Unless you count homosexual edgelord that thinks that "STEALING IS A WAY OF LIFE MAAN!" as a character.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He broke apart her family because it was going to fall apart anyways and he wanted to take the blame and hatred instead of having her hate her mom.<br><br>He threw his life on the line for Crab and Ararararagi even though they bullied him into leaving the town, for barely anything.<br><br>He met up with monkey and helped her out on a few things and offered to help further if he could.<br><br><br>He's definitely no hero, but he isn't a villain. He's an antihero at best, chaotic neutral at worst.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone have a .webm or gif of Araragi doing Tsukihi's OP dance in Tsukimonogatari?</br>  <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=BSp<wbr>cLWwU9O0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Not one on hand but you can make one from this.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He broke apart her family because it was going to fall apart anyways and he wanted to take the blame and hatred instead of having her hate her mom. <br><br>what.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Crab's mom turned into a crazy cultist fanatic and was ruining everything. By causing the family to break up he got crab out of a situation where her mom was literally bringing rapists home.</br></br>  <br>No the family was not going to fall apart anyways, nor was it ever indicated he wanted to take blame and hatred instead of hating her mom, thats insanity. Thats just an EXCUSE for his psychopathic behavior. Remember he lied to those kids and stole money from them basicly just because he was bored?<br><br><br>You were conned by a conman, she nor anyone else would not hate their mom for that but the cult, it was obvious.<br><br>The chance of joining another cult is extremely low after another fell, so he just lied again.<br>He is a unreliable narrator, especially since its known he is a liar and thief. You dont trust liars and thieves, they would lie just to benifit themself, especially psychopaths like that.<br><br><br>He also tricked her that he would cure her of the crab spirit, and stole her money, that said he didnt put his life on the line either for them, but because he wanted money and power, and he took it most likely from gaen and highly probable he thought he could control such a power for his own sake. He couldnt exorcise crab's spirit, thus he couldnt with a god like that. He was in the exorcist squad just to trick them out of money.<br><br>he is no hero, nor a anti hero, but a villian and purebred psychopath.<br>He is burning hell thats for sure and is lying to the narrator, this is highly evident that the only reason he would risk his life with the connection to gaen/kanbaru would be because he knew to con those exorcists (he did with gaen) and thus would think they are even more gullible to get more money from.<br><br><br>The latter is also part of a con based on his previous behavior, there is no reason to help him based on his psychopathic behavior towards innocent people let alone children.<br>Conman also tend to gain trust, but he didn help her out, but he can offer "advice" that would not work anymore then it would for crab. Conmen and liars are just that.<br><br>People are glad he is dead, good fucking ridance, horrible person and character who ruined it for several people.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What part of that was confusing anon? That's exactly what happened.</br>  <br>Take note that crab already talked about this in bake, she wasn't stupid 2 years ago either, if she managed to break free from said rapist means she took precautions so it wouldnt happend to her again, without making her mom suffer for it.<br><br><br>Most likely like those other conmen, they were reported to the police and arrested, same with the rapist, the difference is that the flamboyant faggot was considered the worst since he broke up her family and she wanted him to let his guard down so she could stab him.<br>The amount of people that are trusting him would be like those who trust L ron hubbard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> the family was not going to fall apart anyways <br><br>Oh yes. The family where the mother was literally giving away EVERYTHING causing the family to live in poverty, while she brought rapists to the house to assault her daughter was a 100% stable family.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're just fucking pissy because he hurt crabs feelings. Learn to read how Kaiki acts. He lies to the narrator in a very easy to predict way. Telling half-truths while dancing around the subject matter. It's very easy to tell what he's actually thinking.</br></br>  <br>Have you heard about legal disputes about people who own everything in a household? thats why scientologist cant take everything thats nailed down in a family where only one is a scientologists. Those laws exists in japan aswell<br>the other joint owners (Article 255). Transfers or other changes in ownership shares require the consent of all owners (Article 251) unless otherwise agreed.He was lying about the rest, since he was the storyteller, why would anyone trust the word of a liar? You dont.</br></br>  <br>Who'se source are you using here? a liars source would lie about it being half truths, that is infact his own words, a conmans words and liar's word who steals from children is not a reliable one I would say. If you think so then your are entitled to your opinion, I however would not trust that word. I would think he lied about the entire thing and instead from other pieces of the story that others told was true instead and can puzzle toghether what really happend.</br>  <br><br>Oh yes. Monogatari is 100% accurate to the legal restrictions of the country. That's why the police showed up and arrested Kaiki when he was scamm- Oh wait, they didn't?</br></br>  <br>He didnt hurt her feelings, he stole from her and stole from children and hurt others aswell. From his behavior, its very likely he has conned others aswell.<br>Or tell me, what was the purpose to steal from children? to teach them a lesson?<br><br>Would you allow someone to steal from your family, just to teach them a lesson not to trust people? I mean jesus fucking christ no, you wouldnt, I wouldnt, no sane person would.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Would you think someone who was willing to place a lethal curse on someone is deserving of pity?<br><br>How about people who would've tried to put love charms on other people which is literally brain washing.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the legality that the father of crab can use, he is not stupid in the same way anymore then tom cruise's wife is, who is trying to get her child back to her.<br><br><br>It can be nisio's writing, but even so logicly with the laws there and the fact that people do uses said laws in japan (not neccesarely for cults but for other reasons like marriage disputes) means he fabricated the story.<br>Crab is not totaly stupid, she is decepted as very smart, she would know it was the cult fault obviously, but also know that he is a conman and liar and would lie about anything "I put screws in their heads to teach them a lesson because care for them!, not because i enjoy their suffering due to some adrenaline rush!"</br></br></br></br></br>  i'm just here to say the story ended the worst way possible...<br><br>Lolicon MC should ended with loli vampire who loved him so much that she sacrificed her freedom so he would be safe from harm and Hitagi should have ended with best girl who is obviously Kaiki.</br></br>  <br>Even if a lovecharm somehow would be horrible, since it would affect emotions, and people can experience love but not act on it, in that theoratical situation, exceptions like nadeko does not overrule the majority of children who had their money stolen from them. It was basicly taking candy from a baby.<br><br><br>I think the only other time I felt so much revulsion for a character was that boa hancock from one piece when she kicked a kitten.</br></br></br></br>  <br>By the time Shinobu voluntarily "sacrifices her freedom" it isn't a sacrifice because she's just going back to literally the best days in her life. Before then it's not voluntary.</br>  <br><br>So you think the majority of children were good people who used spells like "Make my friend happy!" and weren't "KILL MY RIVAL!" in a town where kids will beat people over the back of the head with a pipe?</br></br>  <br>So you dont think they were good in justifiable revenge for taking justice for tricking them? he stabbed him though, thats why even a small middle school kid can inflict such bleeding. And rightfully so, he was a horrible person. Like an excecutor who kills a murderer, its justifiable revenge and justice. <br><br><br>Or perhaps you would let something like that happend to your father or mother? I wouldnt.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It was a pipe/crowbar. Unless the guy had a fucking katana.</br></br>  <br>Or a knife to make it bleed. A pipe would cause blunt trauma but not a hole so that it bleeds from the first stab.<br><br><br>Take a dead pig and try stabbing it and then try smashing it with a pipe.<br>Regardless, he deserved everything of it, it does not help that its a harem anime where he meets the other girls and even fucking invites cat over to his hotel.</br></br></br></br></br>  Gather around fellow donkeys because our daily dose of hyper oats is still raw.<br><br>Any word as to who's subbing it?</br></br>  your mum  <br>lel</br>  I miss shogo   DAIZ HELP   <br>Don't turn this into a DAIZ summoning thread.</br>  Eagerly awaiting  more Akane porn   <br>A guy on the other thread said the subs on spanish were up anyone knows where?<br> Inb4 my ass </br></br>  <br>My ass.</br>  Maybe more groups would be willing to sub it if season 2 wasn't fucking terrible.  <br>Season 2 wasn't written by Urobuchi so it never happened.</br>  Funimation panel at Otakon tomorrow. They might announce a release date for the movie.  Colonel Wong, I'm MWPSB  <br>OGAMI?</br>  DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAIZ  Will anonymous deliver?  <br>fucking hell doing subs must suck dick<br><br>how long does this shit take?</br></br></br>  <br>Doujins never get scanned for this series.</br>   people actually buying sybil tech <br> america not nuking japan again for defying FREEDOM </br>  <br>No, but it'd be nice to think so</br>  <br>Actually, all the rudimentary sub timing was done for me, because I converted the .sup file into an .ass file, so it took the existing timings from the Japanese subtitles.<br><br>But yeah, I've been at this for like six hours now. I'm finally more than halfway done. I also need to sleep, though.<br><br>Also, Unshou Ishizuka should never attempt to speak English again unless he's trying to say "OH NO", "OH MY GAH", "OH SHIT", or "SON OF A BITCH"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>You're a real human bean, Anon.</br></br>  <br>OP here. You're doing God's work anon.</br>  <br><br>Where were you when Anon literally saved anime?</br></br>  <br>I am mesmered by people that do this, appreciated.</br>  <br>not anon, but its a great way to study Japanese.<br><br>also, a lot of the time you can compare your translation with others, to see where you or they went wrong.<br><br>also its a great mental exercise trying to translate jokes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are credit to team</br>  <br>Unshou's in the Psycho-Pass movie?</br>  <br>Her  hymen  = intact.</br>  <br>Yes, he's one of the main antagonists.</br>  <br>I love how Akane doesn't give a fuck about /lit/faggotry</br>  <br><br>Nemdiggers.</br></br>  <br>I don't think anybody except hardcore Black Liberation folks have even heard about Frantz Fanon.

Authors try and make their shows seem smart by dropping names and then barely giving any background at all to the arguments they proposed.</br>  <br>Frantz Fanon makes sense in the movie.<br><br>1 in that it's a Black American referencing him<br><br>and 2 in that there's a significant plotline dealing with slavery.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope one day I can be like you anon.</br>  holy shit my boy on this thread is gonna step up with subs! thank you sir. thank you    <br>Can expect this by sunday/monday?</br>  Who's looking forward to Shinya's return?<br><br>Additionally  AM I THE ONLY ONE AROUND HERE WHO'S TIRED OF WAITING MONTHS FOR THE FILM? </br></br>  <br>Subs otw, just one more week tops.</br>  <br>bless you anon</br>  <br>Did coalgirls say that?</br>  <br>THANK YOU</br>  <br> x265 <br><br>Well shit, I can't play these kinds of files.</br></br></br>  <br>Our hero.</br>  <br>Originally they weren't going to do the namedropping and quotes for the movie.

It made me feel so empty inside    Any speculation on why Megu-nee's hair is cut in the journal writing scenes?

Now I can understand the OP from the last thread still being mad as shit.  Kyosuke rejecting all the girls and breaking social norm just to be "lovers for a limited time" and "enjoy themselves to the fullest" (which by the way never get to see) until both graduate? Then we get one kiss and they break up?  What the actual fuck? The ending was really unsatisfactory and I'm buttmad. The only thing that relieved some butthurt is this trivia from the wiki  Based off of the interviews with the author, it seems that Kirino and Kyousuke's relationship with each other truly has not ended. <br><br>-----------------------------------<wbr>-------------------------<br><br>Some minor questions the LN- and Mangafags maybe able to solve:<br><br>S02E08:  Kyosuke is wounded for some reason and being treated by Kirino. How did that happen? <br><br>S02E12:  Ayase goes back home from Kyousuke's apartment and someone takes photos of her? What was that about? <br><br> Why was Kanako part of his harem? They rarely interacted together and I never saw any hints? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Makes sense that only people from a different universe think Kirino is worst girl. Also rip Pete.</br>  <br>You're right about one thing, kirino is alot different without all that edge</br>  tfw no imouto  <br><br>If you had an IRL Imouto who is as perfect as Kirino you would understand her.<br><br>My own Imouto was good at school, good at sports and was hot as fuck, and she treats me even worse than the way Kirino treated his brother.<br><br>The only way your little sister will lok up to you is if you are her hero, being the pathetic person Kyosuce became in his late teens is a recipe for imouto hate.<br><br>Kinino is best girl because she somehow made Kyosuke become the man he was meant to be, instead of the lame faggot he was in the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, I love tongue action.</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>    <br>would you mind Zangyaku-san as a ninja?<br>http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/<wbr>Ninja_(Final_Fantasy_III_Job)<br>one of the designs that would let her hairpin be visible<br><br>thanks for taking requests phalanx</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>OR here.

Nor OR by the way.</br>  bootleg thread  Not really /a/ but still the greatest bootleg ever  <br><br>I'm laughing so hard. This looks like ironic shitposting condensed into a novel.</br></br>      <br> mfw </br>  What does /a/ think of this movie?  <br>Don't advertise anime review channels on 4chan.<br>If you think he makes good points, use them in your own argument and link to the video as a source (if you really must)</br></br>  <br>That just seems disingenuous, but I'll keep it in mind.</br>  <br>This guy completely missed the point.<br> they don't grow <br> they don't go back to the aunt <br> it's treaded like a sad unavoidable end <br>The point of the film it that it was all unavoidable and that the older brother is guilty for not humbling himself before his aunt like a good jap. <br>That's the point of the film anyway, again I hear that's not the novel's point but I can't read runes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> unavoidable <br>Avoidable. It was all avoidable.</br></br>  <br>Ya, so why would we care about this guy? Basically it's a story about some guy who's prideful and arrogant to the point where he manages to kill both his young sister and himself. What am I supposed to get out of that? There's no story there, and there's no character development. So why am I watching this? So it can make me sad?</br>  PHALLIC GUN!  <br>I, the new King. Had never died, foolish /a/non. Now, Obey my rule.</br>  <br>More like new GAY, obey this "unsheathes dick"</br>    It's ogre  <br>Thanks Doc</br></blockquote>]
