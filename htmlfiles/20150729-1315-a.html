How long do you thing will it take them to start releasing episodes?  Rimi best SciADV  <br>The series won't be out for a year at the very least, the VN isn't even out yet.</br>  <br>Does the VN actually have a date yet?</br>  <br>I'm very happy they celebrated both her birthday and death day. But the parting messages are heartbreaking  ;_; </br>  <br>It's had a release date for a while now.<br>You missed the videos?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=y0P<wbr>iPld3_lg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br>November 19th this year on PS3 and PS4 in Japan. Anime will probably come 6 months to a year later or so.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, and Vita.</br></br>  <br><br>Cool, thanks. I sort of stopped following S;G news after Phenogram and only started paying attention again now that I'm replaying the original on the Vita.</br></br>  <br>But that's wrong<br>She's not the worst, though. The other girls in her game get to fight for that title.</br></br>  Rip worst girl, at least you weren't Luka  <br>RIP Kurisu. Your birthday was fun.</br>  <br> year later <br><br>No way, it was announced together.</br></br></br>  <br>They were announced at the same time, that doesn't mean they're releasing at the same time. There's still the Chaos;Child anime to get through first as well.</br>  <br>Did they even mention any schedule for C;C anime?</br>  <br>I don't mean they're releasing at the same time, I doubt they would, but a year is overshooting it by a lot. 6 months is realistic I think.</br>  <br>It won't take a year, but it won't happen simultaneously. <br><br><br>C;C is still a ways off because they didn't have a studio narrowed down until close to the PS4 release. Expect it to happen in early 2016 at the earliest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That sucks. Not only is it only on PS3/PS4 and scheduled for English 6-12 months after the Japanese release, but it's not even on PC. Actually having the ability to play the game is so much better than watching it on youtube.</br>  For reference, Robotics;Notes started airing 3 months after the game came out.  <br>Why would it be on PC? There hasn't been a SciADV game on PC in 5 years.<br><br><br>They were developing the anime in tandem with the game back then, that's not the case with Zero.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What  said.<br><br>I think it's going to be something like a winter release for the Chaos;Child anime along with Steins;Gate 0's VN during its airing, and then Steins;Gate 0's anime sometime next year.<br><br><br><br>Yeah, I don't think we'll be getting any more PC releases for SciAdv, sadly. Just gotta hope for an English release.<br><br><br><br>For reference, Chaos;Child took 6 months and Steins;Gate took 1 year and a half. They obviously planned Steins;Gate 0 from the start though, so 6 months after the VN is definitely reasonable, but I'd still give it a maximum of a year after the VN's release.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And by "along with Steins;Gate 0's VN during its airing", I mean before its airing. Mistake.</br></br>  <br> Just gotta hope for an English release. <br>Steiner seems pretty hyped for fucking something, which I imagine means C;HN + more</br></br>  <br>They announced the anime together with the game. What's your source on the Zero anime not being developed together with the game?</br>  <br>The original was ported to PC. I don't really care for the other Steins;Gate games. How come they've stopped porting? Playing this sort of stuff on PC is way better than playing it on a console, and plus, there isn't even many controls that would make it hard to reconfigure.</br>  <br>You really should stop imagining</br>  <br>I should clarify that my panic/excitation has nothing to do with the Science Adventure GAMES.<br><br><br>The original was ported 5 or so years ago. They stopped because they're simply doing just fine with consoles over there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're afraid of pirates</br>  <br>That sucks, my slight hope for R;N was looking real as well.  I suppose light novels are still cool. </br>  <br>The trilogy that was the basis for Zero has been out now for a long time, they could easily deliver both together.</br>  <br><br> nothing to do with the Science Adventure GAMES. <br><br>Occultic;Nine LN/VN translation confirmed?</br></br></br></br>  <br> They stopped because they're simply doing just fine with consoles over there. <br><br>I hate when companies port the original game to a certain system and then refuse to do the same for the rest. They're just playing with my heart strings, aren't they? Best case scenario I find a friend, spend money on the game, and then borrow his PS4/PS3.  I have no friends </br></br></br>   4 days of july left <br>Don't let me down Pqube.</br>  <br>Buy a vita TV, it will suffice for Sci.ADV games</br>  <br> we'll have more information at the end of august </br>  <br>even though the chances aren't high, like, at all, I'm still putting off importing C;C because of this. They'd better hurry up before no LEs are left anywhere</br>    <br> tfw you sent Steiner a picture over twitter of your import copy of C;C in delusional hope that we'll see a C;H announcement at most <br>I want to believe</br></br>  Calling it now, it's gonna be Robotics;Notes or Zero.  <br> scheduled for English 6-12 months after the Japanese release <br>What are you on? There's no planned English release at all, just like every other sciADV title, and if there is ever gonna be one, it'll take ~6 years to come out, like Steins;Gate originally did.</br></br>  <br> GAMES <br>Epigraph LNs confirmed for publication.</br></br>  <br> Science adventure GAMES <br>Obviously this is miss direction, sciadv has no games, only visual novels.</br></br>    <br> R;N <br>maybe in a world where people are clamoring for it. 0 is probably off the table because 5pb said they were going to try to do it themselves</br></br>  <br> 5pb said they were going to try to do it themselves <br>When? ...With what wording?</br></br>  <br>I'm clamoring for it</br>  <br> 5pb said they were going to try to do it themselves <br>No, they didn't.</br></br>  <br>Could be some of the manga, he did say he was trying to sort that out.</br>  <br><br><br>I think he's talking about this: https://twitter.com/5pbgamesUSA/sta<wbr>tus/613420318762254336<br><br>Not really a reveal or confirming anything. I hope they do end up working on it though, or at least some company picks it up within a reasonable time. What with the Steins;Gate name being so big now, it seems pretty inevitable.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>He ain't talking about that. He already said that his hype has nothing to do with sciADV games, and he wouldn't have been so cryptic if what he was hyped about was just an off-hand remark that holds no weight.</br>  <br>5pb USA isn't even a branch of 5pb.<br>It's just a front for a media group.</br></br>  <br><br>I meant that anon, not Steiner or whoever.<br><br>He probably said "0 is probably off the table because 5pb said they were going to try to do it themselves" because of that Tweet.</br></br></br></br>  If 5pb does Zero themselves I hope you're prepared for a translation on the same level as their official movie subs.  <br>Didn't think the subs were too bad, actually</br>  <br>They weren't good. They used an Italian manga translator to do them.</br>  <br> wish on a monkey paw for all the sciadv media to be translated and released in the west  <br> all done by zakobot <br>That is the true fear.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is zakobot if you don't mind my asking?</br>  <br>Just some cunt.</br>  <br><br>Look on youtube. He's been a jew about hoarding sprites and rips for himself as well as being a poor quality subber.</br></br>  Is it me or are the character sprite animations in the S;G Vita port really low quality compared to the PC port? It can hardly be called animation, more like crudely switching between frames, while on PC it's really smooth. Really noticeable in things like the mouth movement.  <br>Maybe so. I sort of half-noticed it, or rather, I had forgotten that the PC version was smoother.</br>  http://ask.fm/SciADV/answer/1295949<wbr>32279<br>Guess it's not Epigraph, then.<br>Though we did kind of jump to a fast conclusion there.</br></br></wbr>  <br>If this means what I think it means, great! I'd love to see some side content come over other than the  mediocre  Steins;Gate manga.</br>  <br>Steiner might've gotten excited for something unrelated to his localization work.</br>  <br>Well, the implication is that it's not public knowledge.</br>  <br> tmw I asked this question specifically to BTFO everyone who jumped to a fast conclusion ITT </br>  <br>So that's why they're celebrating it on Zero's website.<br> Those bastard. </br></br>  <br>Steiner said sciADV games, not visual novels. I don't think stoner could make such a mistake or has ever said games when referring to the series before. <br>Don't believe his lies<br>don't hope in anything <br>For best effect, listen to nothing</br></br></br></br>  <br>So I went back and looked at the PC version. It seems like it has the same number of animation frames (closed, half-open, and fully open), but it never transitions directly from closed to fully open so the transition does appear smoother. On the other hand, the Vita version appears to match more closely with the audio due to allowing that direct transition.</br>  <br>Too early.<br>Wait for October for the OP.</br></br>  I kinda want to go into the VN and get screenshots/videos of all the stuff related to Lukako's issues, so that can be used to show that Lukako is not trans. Problem is that I'm too lazy to track all that shit down (though the majority of it is probably in chapter 8), so anyone else interested in helping me? I already have screenshots of some stuff from chapter 2 about Lukako's upbringing, and I think there's another mail convo in chapter 3 or 4 about it too.  <br>It's been gathered before if I remember right, let me see if I can find it. Not that logic and proof means anything to the degenerates that insist he's trans.</br>  <br>Nope, can't find it.</br>  <br> degenerates <br/></br>  <br>Not him, but I remember it being mentioned in an article.</br>  <br><br>Wait nevermind I found it.</br></br>  <br>That's what I already have, I was saying I wanted everything related to it in the VN.</br>  <br>Huh, I thought that was all of it.</br>  <br> Don't trust his lies </br>  I want to play Chaos;Child so badly. Just the anime won't cut it for me. I've heard it's really good too <br><br>Chances of it getting localized from PQube since PC version never?</br></br>  <br>Ask again at the end of the month when we know what's actually going on.<br><br><br> When has he ever lied to us? </br></br></br></br>  <br>ANNOUNCE WHATEVER IT IS ALREADY</br>  <br>Slowly, but steady, some of us are starting to realize that learning moon may be a necessity.</br>  <br> Chances of it getting localized from PQube since PC version never? </br>  Best Chaos;Head Girl?<br><br>Best Steins;Gate Girl?<br><br>Best Robotics;Notes Girl?<br><br>Best SciADV Girl overall?<br><br>Best character song?<br><br>Go.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 404 KB <br>Chaos;Child confirmed</br></br>  <br>Lukako has a fucked up family.

That's where he got the pin.</br></br>  <br>Okabe makes a joke about how her dad is hiding a dark past, and Lukako replied that he used to be in a rock band.

Like how Chaos;Head was referenced several times in Steins;Gate with Ayase and Knighthart  <br>Yeah, it was extremely intertwined. Even the anime kept some of it because the plot required it.<br><br> The Committee of 300, the shadow organizations from Chaos;Head and Steins;Gate is present, and working together, with poor LHC-tan being used to supply black hole bombs.<br>You won't recognise the NoAH from Chaos;Head (the machine that could emulate giglomaniacs). The Noah IV creates a giagantic illusion towards the end.<br>Remember Nae, (Braun's daughter) from Steins;Gate? She's grown up and working for JAXA. Voiced by the same person too.<br>And lets not forget the story's true hero, Daru, who's offscreen super hacker skills save the day. The only reason they managed to beat Kimijima in the end was thanks to Daru. Kurisu and Takumi also make cameos.<br/></br></br></br> </br></br></br>  <br> And lets not forget the story's true hero <br>Who got completely cut from the anime.

In the VN you can "follow" Kurisu, Takumi and Daru and read their tweets as the story goes on.</br>  Is it true Sena from C;H met Okabe?  <br>Yeah. Steiner has it translated somewhere.<br><br> Okabe did nothing but rant his delusions at Sena, and she took him seriously for a second before leaving when he couldn't see her Di-Sword. </br></br></br>  <br>They met one week before the Third Melt.

Something about them being in college?</br></br>  <br>you heard wrong.<br>Unless you are thinking of the manga or that Ragho doujin</br></br>  <br>Its been over 4 years since k-on ended, why can't you just accept that it's over?</br>  Do not sexualize the K-Ons.  <br>I would never</br>  <br>they can't be, only representations of them created separately</br>    underrated for sure   also K-on is pretty neat. <br>Indeed. A pretty neat earner for KyoAni, proving that democracy was indeed a mistake, given as KyoAni is soulless dross designed to appeal to the lowest of urges, with no artistic merit to speak of.</br>  why the fuck do so many artists draw yui as a fucking hambeast?  I want my Yui train  <br>why not get a yui statue? I'd rather have that than a fucking train</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <br>Meant to reply to </br>  <br>touche</br>  how come no one is fucking here?<br>We haven't had a k-on thread in a week, you'd think there would be lots of people here</br>  <br>netflix and chill</br>  What did Sabo tell Dragon after regaining his memories?  <br> hey did you know I'm the brother of your son? <br> uh...? </br></br>   ワンピース795話 <br> we finally see Sanji and others on the LAST PAGE </br>  <br> why did you give your son to the WG if you are a revolutionary </br>  <br> why did you give your son to the WG <br>Wat</br></br>  <br>Why did Garp have Luffy with Dragon alive?<br>It is not as though Luffy's childhood was stable or his island safe, seeing as he was raised by mountain bandits and the island was burned, and one of his brothers shot by the tenryubito.<br><br>I think the most obvious question is why didn't Dragon raise Luffy like he did Sabo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>confirmed that Luffy will lose an eye in the final battle</br>  <br>Maybe he thought it was safer since Garp could keep an eye and Ace was around and the whole village loved Luffy. Maybe he wanted Luffy to become a Marine so he could have someone on the inside. Maybe he's super irresponsible.</br>  <br>Zoro</br>  <br>I hope Dragon is actually an evil motherfucker or at least very morally ambiguous<br><br>Bad Guy WG vs Good Guy revolutionaries isn't that interesting but that's how it's shaping out to be. <br><br>Hopefuly Luffy won't like what Dragon is doing and will forge his own path to changing the world</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Obvious Zoro is obvious. Luffy will die before the final scenes</br>  why does he have to job? he's my favorite marine, and hes almost as bad as king jobber sanji now a days. at least he put up a better fight vs vergo than sanji did I guess.  <br><br><br>Why would Zoro need a eye patch after the one piece is found? What difference would it make since he just keeps it closed anyway?</br></br></br>  <br>he's not a very good fighter anymore but he'll have a big relevance considering the marine's future</br>  <br>Fashion sense</br>  <br>What if it's a scene from when he gets old?<br>What if there really is something special behind his closed eye and he overuses it and has to use an eye patch to keep it even closed?<br>I don't know anon. But the only one I can think of right now would be Zoro because of his eye.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Zoro <br><br> It doesn’t really matter if you know or don’t know the thing called the One Para Column, but this appears to be last of behind the scenes talk. The last story to tell is more of a behind the scenes policy, rather than a behind the scenes story. So what is a "pirate"? If you ask someone with artistic talents to draw a pirate, you will normally get a sketch that looks like this... or this ....  <br><br> Indeed, a pirate. Very easy to understand, but if you take off the eye patch, there's a big difference to one with, and one without (the one without looks like a normal middle-aged man). So then, that means, eye patch = pirate. It’s just like, afro = champion type thing... so have you noticed yet? Well, you probably haven’t. That in One Piece, there has not been one single pirate with an eye patch! ... yes i know, who cares right? But this is my secret "behind the scenes policy". It’s not like every pirate has an eye patch!!! ... right? You can totally draw pirates without an eye patch!!!! <br><br> And with that thought in mind it all began; the story of a normal looking boy's pirate story. <br><br> I thought, if there's an image in everyone's head about what a pirate is, then I thought I would write/draw about the process of the boy getting there. But its not like I dislike eye patches, so in the final scenes of One Piece, there is one pirate who appears with an eye patch. <br><br>It's Luffy<br>Why the fuck would Zoro need to wear an eyepatch when he's been getting along fine just by keeping his eye closed?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why can't Luffy keep his eye closed as Zoro?</br>  <br> yfw when luffy uses two eyepatches as fashion because he loses both eyes instead of sunglasses or shit like that </br>  I think Usopp is the most likely to lose an eye. Especially since he's the Sniper and unlocked CoO.  <br>Usopp will probably get his eye shot out by Van Auger but still win.</br>  <br>Luffys style is that of a pirate<br>Zoro resembles more of a samurai <br><br>Zoro with an eye patch would look off putting.</br></br></br></br>   tfw Bisoromi Bear-Sama is gone   <br>This disqualifies any straw hat who is not a normal human.<br>Only Usopp is stated by Oda as<br> the closest to a normal human <br>When he joins Luffy's crew he was actually about to start his own journey as a captain but Zoro said get on the boat.<br>Usopp then said (and Luffy agreed with all crew present and not objecting that should luffy die, Usopp is captain.</br></br></br></br></br>   There are at least 15 notebooks that include Oda's ideas about Dressrosa arc. <br><br>That guy really does work 24/7 even when he is on a break doesn't he?</br></br>  <br>Mangakas doesn't sleep.</br>  <br>At first I thought that sounds like a bit of a longshot but if you think about it there could be a little bit of foreshadowing for this.<br>Recall the first chapter where Luffy tries to stab himself in the eye to prove he's tough?<br>Then there's the volume cover where he has one eye closed.</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy was likely an infant when he gave Luffy to his grandfather. Cant be toting a babysling while overthrowing the government<br><br>Sabo was old enough/strong enough to fend for himself by the time Dragon fished him out of the ocean</br></br></br>  <br><br> "I just remembered, I love the D." </br></br>  <br> Zoro resembles more of a samurai <br>por que no los dos?<br><br>he already wears a bandanna. It would look good with an eyepatch</br></br></br></br>  <br>CARLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<wbr>OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOS</wbr></br>  <br>Luffy will die before One Piece ends.</br>   yfw Sabo is actually a D.   <br> le everyone is a D. meme xdxd </br>  <br>So is Tanjihado Loluflamingo.</br>  <br> My name isn't Sabo, I turned the D around when I was young, my name is Sah D. Ou </br>    <br> por que no los dos? </br>  <br>yes?</br>  <br> everyone who ever had a D in their name ever is a D </br>  <br>Nami is the daughter of Portgas D. Rouge's sister<br><br>Zoro is actually the son of gol d rogers younger brother who took the name of his wife because he didn't want to be connected with him obv<br><br>Sanji is actually half-giant, his real name is Jaguar D. Sanji<br><br>When bBook set sail 50+ years ago he had a son at home, his real name is Marshall D Brook and he is blackbeards granddad<br><br>Franky is actually a cousin of Law, Trafalgar D Water Franky. <br><br>Only Chopper, Robin and Usopp are no D's. :^)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only Chopper, Robin and Usopp are no D's. <br>anon none of them has a D it fits</br></br>  <br> Trafalgar D Water Franky <br>More like Trafalgar D. Cutty Flam</br></br>  <br><br>That much is obvious. He actually has no interest in changing the world, even if it does happen as a result of his actions. Every time he ended up benefiting someone other than himself and his crew, was because he held a personal grudge against the Big Bad because they did something to someone he liked.<br><br>The Revolutionaries are by definition geared towards the needs of the (supposed) many vs the needs of individuals. Luffy would never sacrifice himself for a goal (other than his own obviously), but only for a person he cares about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Usopp's real name is Jeffrey D. D. Osu.</br>  <br>you can blame Roger for that<br><br> those idiots of the WG are calling me Doflamingo now, can you believe it? <br> &gt;hmm? That's not your name? <br> No it's Donquixote D. Flamingo <br> &gt;D, huh? What's that D. stand for anyway? <br> You wanna know? Fuffuffu! Then i'll tell you. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> yfw franky wrote his name wrong as kid and it's actually Cuu D. Flam </br>  So why did Oda introduce sacrificial immortality if it won't be used?  D. D. D.    <br> luffy, law and   x drake  have to take on kaidou together <br> law is mortally wounded <br> TORA!! <br> don't you worry mugiwara, I- I just used you <br> NANI!? <br> back when we were at marineford I performed the immortality operation on you - reducing my life too three years, that's why you survived. I knew that you would one day take down the shichibukai including doflamingo <br> TOOOOORAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA <br>I would hang myself while linking /a/ a livestream link</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Diez D. Drake?</br>  <br>My god anon how dare you. I don't want that to happen but it felt like a spoiler reading it.<br>But both Jinbe and Luffy were mortally wounded, and both lived.<br><br>Law is a heart thief. He controls his enemies literally by keeping their hearts.<br>So to me it seems obvious the way Law grants "immortality" is, he swaps his heart with yours.</br></br></br></br></br>  I haven't been keeping track of One Piece since Chopper was introduced. Have they found the One Piece yet? Is it even relevant anymore?  <br><br>My god anon how dare you. I don't want that to happen but it felt like a spoiler reading it.<br>But both Jinbe and Luffy were mortally wounded, and both lived.<br><br>Law is a heart thief. He controls his enemies literally by keeping their hearts.<br>So to me it seems obvious the way Law grants "immortality" is, he swaps his heart with yours.<br>So he either already did this with Monet or Luffy's heart will get shredded by Kaido.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Have they found the One Piece yet? <br>yes they found it the series is ending in august.</br></br>  <br>They are half the way to the One Piece.<br><br>We still don't know what it is.</br></br></br>  <br>no and yes</br>  <br><br>What is the point of the One Piece at this point, how is it still relevant?</br></br>  you have ope ope no mi<br>you make self immortal you die<br>but you immortal?</br></br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!   BB had the Ope Ope immortality operation performed on him by the previous user <br> now has two hearts <br> can use two devil fruits <br> irregular body structure </br></br></br>  Is Oda preparing to have the top 6 of the worst generation duke it out? Kid, Hawkins and Apoo vs Luffy, Law and Drake?  <br> halfway <br>That was Fishman Island.<br>Alabasta ended in Paradise and it was:<br>Mock Town<br>Skypiea<br>Long O Ring Island<br>The Train Station<br>Water 7 and the still mysterious Aqua Laguna and PLUTON blueprints.<br>Ennies Lobby<br>Ghost Ship/Florian Triangle<br>Thriller Bark<br>Saboady<br>Impel Down<br>Marine ford <br><br>I really hope we have 10 arcs left but shit seems more rapid in the new world than in paradise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not relevant. The One Piece is the anicent weapon that'll unite all the seas and release all the devil fruits into one surprise ALL-ALL no MI Fruit. It would also absorb all the Haki from every Haki User to power the machine.<br><br>That's literally the end.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like it'll be over when they get to Raftel.<br><br>That's just when all the history and overarching plot reveals will come out. They still need to restore the world's magnetic fields, get rid of the Calm Belts, and break the Red Line before shit will be fixed.</br></br></br>  <br>Well yea if you prefer fanfiction to the acual story.<br><br>I don't think Roger's great treasure is a weapon.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah because one arc took two years excluding the previous build up arc</br>  <br>That would go against the "risking your life for your dream" thing that Oda seems to value above all else.</br>  <br>That is just perception anon. Time seems to go by faster the older you get because every day is a smaller percentage of your life. Although that hasn't stopped this arc from being eternal.</br>  <br>Dressrosa is the buildup arc for the end of the story, though.<br>Everything about dress rosa is about the yonko, the marines, the WG, and the revery.<br>Specifically, an arms race with Doffy selling shit to all sides.<br><br>The arms race is for the final war which follows or even coincides with revery three months from Doffy defeat.<br><br>Fuji speech on TV will affect revery too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> above all else <br>Like when Zoro sacrificed himself to Kuma?</br></br>  <br>Do you know what build-up arc means? It doesn't mean foreshadowing, it describes a previous arc with direct relation to the actual bigger arc, see<br><br>Jaya - Skypia<br>Water 7 - Enies Lobby<br>Impol Down - Marineford <br>Punk Hazard - Dressrosa</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Have spoilers come out yet? I've been watching  dota  all day long.  <br> Sacrificing my life means nothing if the SH can continue their journey toward their dreams <br>Kinda, I guess ?</br></br>  <br>I'm referring to the story arc in literary terms, not the wiki's arc system.<br>Even under that definition though Dressrosa is absolutely just the little garden of this saga which won't end till Kinemon's conflict is resolved.<br><br>For example Laboon, Whiskey Peak, and little garden were all buildup to Alabasta with Vivi being introduced at Laboon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Lawhats didn't form to kill Doffy they formed to kill Kaido, and taking out Doffy was just an essential step.</br>  <br>Dressrosa is more important and longer than alabasta, so year no comparing it to little garden is retarded at the first place there is nothing that suggest tha kinemon is the main factor that describes the current saga instead of kaidou, big mom or someone important on wano. Afterall the baroque works saga was not named after vivi, but after the organisation of a big shot</br>  <br>spoilers won't come out til tomorrow</br>  post yfw Bellemy joins the strawhats  <br>That's the difference between an saga, a arc and a build-up arc. The Saga SHOULD be about kaidou while dressrosa still is an actual arc and Punk hazard was a direct build-up arc for dressrosa</br>  <br> dressrosa isn't just a segment of the "Luffy and Law take down Kaidou" arc </br>  <br> I don't know the difference between arc and saga <br>Look ist up</br></br>  <br>Water 7 is actually longer than Enies Lobby I'm pretty sure. <br><br>EB was actually more like a conclusion arc to Water 7 that went on for way too long.</br></br></br>    <br>Arc and saga are words that exist and have their own meanings outside of the context of One Piece.<br><br>Inside the context of One Piece, arc and saga don't necessarily refer to a specific thing because the source material is in fucking japanese.<br><br>Are you ESL, or just autistic?</br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder Shanks will BTFO Kidd and his allies, and will make them serve him rum everyday  <br>  <br>Inside the context of One Piece, arc and saga don't necessarily refer to a specific thing because the source material is in fucking japanese.<br>Are you actually retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks will lost another arm.</br>  <br>please show me where in the one piece source material it is specified that alabasta is an arc and baroque works is a saga, and that the words arc and saga refer to specific story patterns</br>  <br>It is important but only in that it gives us a lot of the pieces for the Great War and Revery. Only in that it is buildup for Kaido/big mom/akainu. Only in that it shows us Luffy's strength max, so that when he gets owned by Kaido it seems impossible Luffy could win.<br>Dress rosa is longer than Alabasta but Alabasta introduced:<br>Poneglyphs <br>Roger's real name<br>Fire fist Ace<br>Shichibukai<br>The ancient weapons<br>Inanimate objects with devil fruit<br>Dr. Vegapunk (not sure if his name was dropped though could be wrong)<br>Logia<br>Steroids<br>and poison</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard</br>  <br>It's the Yonko saga, Dressrosa is a really long arc but not the main one of the saga which is going to be yonko resolution, not shichibukai working for a yonko resolution. Not that anon.</br>  <br>Nah he was intro as a silhouette at Drum. Also I forgot Krieg used poison gas. Still, also the only person who can read glyphs joined the crew at the end of it.</br>  <br>Initial<br>D<br>D<br>D</br></br></br></br>  <br>Logia were already introduced with Smoker<br>Gold Roger's real name was mentioned in Drum<br>Steroids and poison aren't important plot points<br><br>But other than that yeah</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>and Bepo.</br>    <br>Thanks for the correction but multiple royal families had secret royal steroids so they are relevant.<br>Poison is relevant because poison can also be a fatal disease.<br>Smoker wasn't a very overwhelming logia like croc but you are technically correct.</br></br></br>  <br>Lets face it. Only reason Kidd's crew is going after Shanks is because Hawkins cards predicted that their survival rate is the highest against the Red Hairs verses the other Yonko. And that's only because Shanks is a chill guy and will probably give them a little beating and then laugh about it and party with them afterwards.</br>  <br>I disagree with that being even the main reason.<br>Shanks is the most desirable Yonko to defeat because looting his ship and even just asking him how to get to Raftel could have good results.</br></br>  <br>We don't know that it hasn't already been used. She's a prime candidate if you ask me.</br>  <br>I want it to happen</br>  <br>Dammit, every time I see Doctorine my head changes her symbol to the 4chan clover</br>  <br><br>Is it impossible for Blackbeard to be Pluton?<br>The Blueprints Franky burned in front of Spamdam said PLUTON but when Franky talked about what he had to people in confidence it was stated as the<br> countermeasure <br>To PLUTON, rather than the weapon itself.<br>This has always confused me because sometimes the manga says frankly has plutons countermeasure and others it says the weapon itself.<br><br>How did Blackbeard know Luffy was at Water 7 after Skypiea is my main question though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Dragon was too busy with revolutionary stuff when Luffy was born probably. Plus he's mentioned in some of his appearances that he approves of Luffy's choices in terms of finding his own way in the world. It's very possible he wanted Luffy to grow up and form his own opinions on things and also new that while Garp would want him to be a Marine he would also be too busy to raise or influence Luffy that much (which is indeed what happened)</br></br>  <br>I think you're confused. It was stated that Pluton was to be used as a countermeasure against one of the other ancient weapons in case the government or someone else revived one.</br>  <br>Makes sense, I'll re read it.</br>  <br>You didn't answer the main question.<br>It makes no sense that Blackbeard could know where Luffy would exit the sky.<br><br>But on to other shit, check out this 330 year old skull that Robin found from the ship that fell from the sky and read what she says about his smile.<br><br>Then remember that Luffy found a treasure chest in this boat that fell from skypiea which had been in that place while roger was alive.<br>Roger undoubtedly found this boat while it was in skypiea, and learned his own family history.<br><br>Unfortunately the exclamation pointed treasure chest was never opened, but at least luffy found the map of skypiea.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  posting canonically gayest one piece character  <br>You mean Delly</br>  <br> canonically gayest one piece character <br><br>you mean fanonically<br><br>Gayest award goes to Whitebeard</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is the ship.</br>  <br>that quote is bullshit. Just because you can't imagine a new color, doesnt mean there arent any more</br>  so how did those people on the island find out tanjihadou laluflamingo were former tenryuubito? did he literally tell someone he used to be one?  <br>The quote never said that things humans can't imagine don't exist, it just said all things they can imagine are possible.</br>  <br>Pluton is a ship man</br>  <br>it says that anything your imagination can create can exist in the real world, not that only things you can imagine can exist<br>reading comprehension</br></br>  <br><br>Here is the exclamation marked treasure chest that got eaten by the sea turtle.</br></br>  <br>So it is Water 7 then, because the saga ended with Iceberg telling Franky Water 7 would be converted to a ship.</br>  How different would the Dressrosa arc have been if Akainu sent Kizaru instead of Fujitora?  <br> read what she says about his smile <br>Are you talking about how he had rubber oil put on his teeth after his death?<br><br> Roger undoubtedly found this boat while it was in skypeia and learned his own family history <br>Okay, first, the boat was floating around in exile on a cloud island or something in a place where it couldn't get back. I'm not sure how Roger could have found it.<br>Second, in what way is this tied to Roger's family history? I see no indication of any of this. Roger is from the East Blue, this guy is from South Blue.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora did nothing. <br><br>Kizaru doesn't give a fuck about anything so he wouldn't have done anything as well.<br><br>I like Fuji but with Kizaru the arc would've been 3 times better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kizaru would've gotten shit done<br> laser beams gladiators that try to join Luffy's side <br> Sabo tries to hold him off but get kicked with the speed of light <br> Law and Luffy would probably try to escape, the two of them could barely take down Dofla, so Kizaru would've been out of the picture. <br><br>I still don't get why they don't just send kizaru to destroy the ships of the supernova.He could just uasaka no magatama them to oblivion.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> rubber oils <br>Or he was a rubber man till he died.<br>If it can literally fall next to luffy I think roger would find it too. He found skypiea.</br></br></br>  <br>More pages dumpin no order though.<br>All the other skulls miss teeth by the way.</br></br>  <br>i like how this one really happens by the rust user at ennies lobby</br>    <br>I love that page so much, only because of how Robin can decipher something as simple as a skull and extract a ton of information. Ohara's researchers were ahead of their time. Damn the fights, I want Oda to release a book on all the information regarding One Piece's world. Just an atlas of stuff explaining certain areas and the like. Some people just can't appreciate One Piece for what it is.</br>  <br>Coating the deceased's teeth in rubber oil is a custom of a specific region of the South Blue. That's how Robin finds the name of the ship, which is later confirmed in the page you posted .<br><br>If he were a rubber man, that would be a hell of a coincidence. Also, if his teeth were rubber, then either they would still be rubber (which is not the case), or they would have ceased being rubber upon his death, in which case they wouldn't have been stayed in the same condition and deteriorated.<br><br>And yeah, I don't expect Roger to have found that ship, and there's absolutely no proof that he did. I'm just not sure where you're pulling this from.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fujitora would've gotten shit done if we wanted to, too</br>  <br>Also, the log pose pointed to the sky only after/while this ship fell from it. Before that it was pointing normally.</br>  So once Luffy gives the hat back to Shanks, what is he going to do about his Crew name and Jolly Roger?<br><br>Cant very well go on being known as Strawhat Luffy after that.</br></br>  <br>Shanks is going to die at the hand of the Kid alliance.<br><br>He can't give the hat back.</br></br></br>  <br>Fire Fist and I sodomized your son.</br>  <br> ship with a treasure chest falls from the sky, then your log pose immediately points at the sky thereafter, and you get a map of skypiea  <br> not a hell of a coincidence <br>Ugh</br></br></br>  <br> implying Shanks wouldn't just give the straw hat back <br>Would be petty of shanks if he didn't</br></br>  <br>Ahos need not reply</br>    <br>didnt Shanks say to return it though? It IS still his hat. One he got from his deceased captain no less</br>  <br><br>He'll learn to awaken his power and make everything smoke.</br></br>    Who is the most autistic character in One Piece?  <br>Imagine this. After a big fight Shanks is dying, Luffy returns it and then Shanks immediately gives it back to him. And then when Luffy finds the One Piece he will pass the hat to the next strawhat.</br>  <br>Getting the map is not a part of the coincidence. The ship was on Skypiea.</br>  <br><br>Wanze</br></br>  <br>Luffy, he has Dragonball Goku levels of autism at times.</br>  <br>Hard to say. Going by the internet's definition, a lot of characters are autistic.</br>  <br>Vegapunk.</br>  <br>You're making a theory (Roger found his history) based on two baseless theories (Roger found the ship, the Saint Bliss guy was a rubber human) and another unproven theory (Roger was a rubber man).<br><br>It's highly unlikely Roger even found the Saint Bliss, and even if we're assuming he could because coincidences happen in One Piece, there's no evidence that he did.<br><br>The ship crashing down next to them giving them a map of Skypeia is a hell of a coincidence, sure, but it for sure happened.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro:*unseathes katana* shishi sonson Pssht.Nothing personnel kid</br>  <br>The map being completely untarnished while the sword disintegrated as it unsheathed is a pretty lucky coincidence.<br>So is Luffy of all people being the one to find it.<br>The falling ship coinciding with the change in magnetic field is the only reason they got the map as well so yes it is.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel like he just said it to make some sort of promise that they'd meet each other again. I think seeing Luffy again is more important to him than getting his hat back, and I'd think he'll know that the strawhat would be important to Luffy by then too. I don't know, he might take it back, but I don't see him doing that.</br>  <br>that's too predictable</br>  When will the rest of the Sun Pirates be killed so Law can join the Strawhats  <br>Where did I claim Roger was a rubber man? I just claim this ancestor was as all other skulls on his ship had missing teeth and he was murdered so there was no one to put rubber oil on his teeth and manicure him after death.<br>You drew the roger was rubber on your own.</br></br>    <br>Roger hears the voice of all things and found all the great treasures because of it, and there was a treasure on the ship, and the drawn map was clearly NEW compared to all other artifacts on the ship.</br>  <br>Nah. Actually I think Luffy is very in tune with other's feelings and naturally knows what they need to hear or do to make them feel better. Like how he handled Laboon for example, though he's an animal. Definitely not stunted when it comes to social interactions.</br>  This manga is so goofy and over the top.  So why can't I stop reading it?   <br>It's the only manga of which I reread a random arc/chapter every month. Most of the time because of Kumagawa.<br>  The first time I saw Kumagawa and the thing that made me want to read MB was that doujin with him and Naze... </br></br>  <br>Fuck you say lil nigga.</br>  <br> 2012 <br> oldfags </br></br>  <br>"They could have done something like.." post is never good. Just ignore every post that goes like that.</br>  <br> Sadly enough the Medaka herself was just too much of a Mary sue <br>Which was the point of the whole fucking story.<br>From your ideas and understanding of medaka, I can safely say you think this is a mainstream battle shounen.<br>It isn't.</br></br></br></br>  Time for the new one  <br> he missed her pantsu flash <br>Fucking Charlie Brown.</br></br>  <br> Latest Release(s) <br> v.2 c.17.5 by Ciel Scans (163d ago) </br></br>  <br>I went through my list lasy night to find out what has been cancelled and its just awful.

Best marathon read I've had in ages, took me way too damn long to start this  <br>To clarify, it gets about 18 pages once every two months in a little bonus booklet that comes with the magazine since the author has an ongoing monthly in the main magazine.<br> I buy the magazine but I haven't got a few chapters in between the newest one and where scans left off. </br></br>    <br>The dancing one, right? It's in my backlog. I should download it one of these days.</br>  <br>The one about the vampire imouto, right? It's not as good as Takagi.</br>    <br>The author sadly disagrees, given he decided to prioritize Kyoko.</br>  <br>It's not up to the author to decide what series runs in the main magazine.</br>  <br>I like vampire imouto more.</br>  <br>He started both series at the same time, and pitched Takagi as a short bimonthly and Kyoko as a longer monthly.</br>  <br>Yes, it's only 11 chapters by now and it's from the same artist of OMK and Molester Man. It's really cute, you'll probably like it.</br>    <br> it's from the same artist of OMK and Molester Man <br>I wouldn't have thought. he's really come some ways, it's been really clean and professional.</br></br>  <br> it's from the same artist of OMK and Molester Man <br>I wouldn't have have guessed.</br></br>    <br>Source? All I get is some guys twitter when reverse searching.</br>    <br>Is there no way to fund a continuation of Double Arts? Would spend 30$ for that.</br>  I just want someone to finish translating SE  <br>No amount of funding would persuade the author to abandon Nisekoi.<br><br>So we have to stop Nisekoi first.</br></br></br>  Which of these are appropriate for a young girl such as myself?    <br>picked up.</br>  <br>By itself that page isn't much, even confusing. In context, that page was awesome and was a perfect twist</br>  <br>We just need to find a way to convince Los Zetas that Nisekoi is somehow infinging on their turf, and that would stop it.</br>      <br>Now post sharpie in pooper.</br>        <br>Fuck, my heart skipped a beat when I thought they started translating again. Thanks for reminding me OP, now I feel more empty than before</br>  <br><br>This is porn right?</br></br>  <br>Yup</br>  <br>Too sad to put into words</br>  <br>I don't know what manga it is, but that artsyle belongs to Noujou Junichi. Kuraudo looks the same.</br>    <br>Chapter? I don't remember when this happened</br>  <br>This part hit me hard. I think it was the only thing worth continuing to read after the time skip.</br>  <br><br> tfw Sesuji no Pin is doing awesome in the TOC rankings <br>So far it placed 4, 5, and 2, not counting the color pages.

You can only go through so many loops before you go insane.<br><br>All she would have had to do was lose hope once and it was all over, that is why it was amazing she made it through as many loops as she did.</br></br></br>  <br>Man those cards. Did you kneel to your chosen princess yet?</br>  <br>Wow, I had no idea they did this for anime too. Or is it just for Madoka?</br>  <br>That's the thing. She can turn back time, but she can't change anything. Despite improving her skill to crazy levels, the time lines never really improved, and Madoka's fate only became more heavy. QB explains this in episode 11.</br>  <br> building an Arc Reactor with a Box of Scraps <br>In a CAVE!</br></br>  <br>Of course i kneel to her and post her on every magica thread from start to end! I love her and all her forms. Also that is an impressive super drill</br>  Handsome.  <br>The problem is that Homura is a natural fuckup. Holy shit, does she ever fuck up. In almost every single time line, she manages to do something that requires Madoka to bail her out. At TV series finale, it was Madoka again that cleaned up Homura's mother of all fuck ups. Despite it was her constant time-looping that made Madoka powerful, she was all ready to give up at the very end, almost wasting all of that karmic destiny. It was Madoka (again), that came to learn the truth and made one of the wisest wishes made in that verse and saved the magical girls. In short, no matter what Homura did or how much time she had, she is guaranteed to fuck up because that's her nature. She was just fortunate enough to have dependable Madoka to clean up her mess afterward.</br>  If only she had stolen a fucking nuke to kill that one last witch.<br>Then we could have had a scene where she walks away from the explosion removing her sunglasses, making everything happy forever.</br>  <br>It is a nice super drill.<br><br> that Homu scared of needles <br><br>Also super cute.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you moron, a nuke wouldn't have worked. That witch was immune to conventional damage. It required magical powers to defeat it. Madoka in the first timeline managed to defeat it and she was at her weakest then.</br>  <br>But a nuke is a magic of science, anon. I'm sure everything would be allright.</br>  <br>all of the other witches could be killed with conventional means, this witch could be as well, it would just require more force.</br>  I want to do science with homu  <br>To be fair it is fairly likely that it took Madoka to go allahu akbar on the witch's ass given how there was no soul gem on sight. If Kyouko's explosion is any indicative it is a suicidal but viable way to get things done.</br>  <br> Then we could have had a scene where she walks away from the explosion removing her sunglasses, making everything happy forever <br><br>Also killing everyone in the process, including herself and Kyouko who would be innocently eating stolen apples a city away. I would rather be dead than being a meguca, so I guess it's still happier.<br><br><br> Madoka in the first timeline managed to defeat it <br><br>We don't know that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> nuke <br> not scientific magic </br></br>  <br> do I get my Homu hating license yet <br>The problem is the system of magical girls and how they always end in despair. That's why Madoka had to make a paradox wish that overthrows the whole thing.<br><br><br>There's no proof Walpurgisnacht was ever defeated until the time loop where Madoka one-shots it and turns into Gretchen.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw Kyouko stole my heart </br>  <br>I know you're joking, but don't you dare say nuclear power is magic again. It's an insult to SCIENCE!</br>  <br>You forgot golf club.</br>  <br><br>Not necessarily defeat, but injure Walpurgis enough for her to turn tail out of the city. Or their fight lasted enough time for the night of the witche's appearance clock away and thus her time there to run out.</br></br>  <br>And bow.</br>  <br>If assuming the bow and arrow power set that Homura got in the tv series is the same as Madoka, then it is more than likely that Madoka simply taunted the witch into using a powerful attack and reflected it back but burnt out her soul gem. The fact that Madoka's corpse was still intact is a testament that she had managed to stop the witch somehow.</br>  <br>Eh, I find the last one to be impossible to happen since the witch would be wrecking the city in the meantime, rendering any attempt to stall for time futile.</br>  Why didn't Homura end the pathetic life of Mami with ultimate fire power? Why all small arms? Because Mami uses toy like muskets?  <br>You say that.<br>But do you know how strong a Black Hole is?<br>I'm pretty sure if Homura learns how to make a black hole gun and then make the black hole vanish she'd change a lot of shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I want to do sexual reproduction with homu</br>  <br>That's some weird roundabout theory you have there. Just accept that you can't win. Witch system a shit, all hail Madoka and Homura for destroying it.</br>  <br>Listed already on the first reply. Impressive<br><br><br> dat Stinger Homu </br></br></br></br>  <br>Angry mini-nuke Homu is funny.</br>  <br>Is Homu a nazi?</br>  Good night everyone.  <br>No, they end in despair because the wish that they made is not what they actually wanted. That's the point, adolescent girls are rarely honest with themselves. They are constantly regretting that they wasted their one wish for something that they didn't actually wanted and now has to spend an eternity of fighting. A depressed magical girl is more likely to make mistakes and cause fuckups. Not to mention upon their death, they are full of regret from it all which causes them to become witches. Madoka did more than cause a paradox, she consoled the girls upon their death, to get them to release all of their pent-up frustration. The universe isn't the one making the magical girls despair, they themselves are.</br>  <br>It listed weapon she used in Rebellion<br>Maybe her usual weapon already busted by then, it's a hundred iteration alright<br><br><br>QB sure know how to make Megucas pissed</br></br></br></br></br>          is homura more american than meridoka?      <br>The weapons she stole in each timeline most likely vanished instead of carrying over, so that she couldn't bring stuff from one timeline to another (other than her consciousness). Otherwise she could just put together a film or something with a previous timeline Madoka to convice her past self in each following timeline to not contract under any circumstances.</br>    <br>You tell me.</br>  <br>Yes, she has big FREEDOM soul</br>  Say it with me /a/<br><br>President Madoka</br></br>  <br>president homu incoming</br>  <br>Or she never thought of that because she's a dumb kid</br>  <br>So, she must break into JSDF arsenal in every timeline?

But you forgot her magic shield that allows her to stop time.</br>    <br>She only does it with Madoka</br>  <br>Yeah, and she also had to set up stuff such as those torpedoes in every single on of them since she had no means to launch them by herself. It then required her to lure Walpurgis into their line of fire, which took the knowledge and experience built over several timelines of where it would first show up and then the weaponry she could use to push it back towards the designated area.

She got rid of Sayaka's memories and her ability to tap her witch powers. It makes sense because what she stole from Madoka was her power as the law of the cycle, so basically magical girls still exist but come time for them to expire they have to answer to Homura now not Madoka anymore. I wouldn't be surprised if Homura arranged the world so that soul Gems disintegrate and leave the girls behind alive, so that only she was the eternal devil god and no one joins her in vaginalhala.</br></br>  <br>What if Madoka recovered<br><br>What if Akuma Homura's demon powers were hampered</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on whether she even has a separate magical girl forme now. She technically is no longer a lich since she need not be with her dark orb at all times and can summon it from nowhere when she needs to. Her devil forme was not human sized in the one time we saw it, so it may not be something that she turns into for combat or whatever. And then there's the issue of what use fighting would be now that she is a reality warping devil.</br>  <br>Pretty sure the dark orb is stored in that mark on the back of her hand.<br>We still don't really know what the hell it does though.</br></br>  <br>So where is Homura's soul?</br>  <br>She broke her own soul gem, so who knows. I imagine that like Madokami (who also destroyed her own soul gem after it turned into Super-Gretchen), she's transcended the whole soul gem thing and is just herself now.</br>  Is Homu a Nietzsche?  <br>So wait, can you cock that handgun by simply pushing the thumb part of your palm into the grip?</br>  <br> airsoft </br>  <br>You for got step 8: get disgusted looks at the range</br>  Homu  <br>Kyouko, that's not nice.</br>  <br><br>No. That's a grip safety. It works by preventing the gun from firing if it is not being held.</br></br>  Fluff  I have no MadoHomu fluff. That's not where their relationship goes, generally.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128713033     Best couple best fluff  <br><br> there are people voting for anything other than Mami's mammies </br></br>  <br><br>I think Homu would like putting Kyouko's hair up like Madoka.  Then forcing her homulust on her </br></br>  <br>Who needs fluff anyway?</br>  <br><br> First reply <br><br>Good job, /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So what if I want to vote for Kyouko?</br>  <br>Someone has got to vote for her.<br> madoka winning </br></br>  <br>What are the numbers? I can't see them.</br>  <br>15 15 10 4 3 2 1 0 0</br>  <br>I thought Madoka was winning.</br>  <br>Someone voted for mami after I said madoka was winning</br>  <br><br><br>you guys are huge pervs</br></br></br>  <br>Ha!<br><br><br>But I voted just to vote!</br></br></br></br>  <br>N-no<br><br>I'm surprised homu doesn't have more votes.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128716572 <br>But homuhater, that wasn't a stat and it wasn't fun either.</br>  <br> nuke <br> in the middle of a city <br><br>Murrica is at it again, it seems.</br></br></br></br>    <br>lookin a little topheavy there eh applechan?</br>  Mammi's master race.

Until then it's prettymuch just a happy reiterating series of a few conversation topics over and over again</br>  <br> true enough </br>  <br>ostensibly we're talking about a series with so much about it to discuss that we'd never run out and yet here we are at the end of the umpteenth conference on the matter of whose chest is most appealing</br>  <br> Fluff. </br>  <br>K-kyouko's</br>  <br> 14 <br>+12 years of experience without aging<br>Effectively making her 26.</br></br></br>  <br>We should be talking about whos Mahou shoujo outfit is best instead</br>  <br>The beautiful Sayaka-chan is number one in my heart.</br>  <br>Obviously Sayaka-chan.</br>  <br>Hers is one of the best. I can't decide between mamis, sayakas or kyokos.</br>  <br>by a mile. She at least got the outfit fit for a hero</br>  <br><br>A bit of pixellation on the image there. Perhaps waifu2x could do a better upscale?<br><br>http://waifu2x.udp.jp/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sayaka a poop</br>  <br>No, Sayaka a best.</br>  <br>Sayaka's cape is the best feature.<br><br><br>This image is ridiculous.Sayaka can just heal herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br>inb4 sayaka failed because IncrediblesNoCapes.gif</br>  <br>Apparently it references the powerlevel charts released after the movies, where Sayaka's the weakest one. Poor Sayaka-chan.</br>  <br>well she was clearly the weakest even from the series. Mami, despite her early death, was clearly no joke and could have killed Homura</br>  <br>Suddenly feeling nostalgic, I loved that joke.<br><br><br>Sayaka is the speed and power type but the level in her skilll is low but she has a better defense system and faster recovery.</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair she was a beginner around veterans.</br>  <br>Sayaka wasn't the power type, that was Kyoko, and she wasn't exactly out speeding Kyoko either.<br><br>Sayaka was the paladin, unfortunately, that is not the role to take in this series.</br></br></br>  <br>No, they're actually both the same (being close-combat types as well) only that Kyouko has better skills and greater power than Sayaka but has a low defense.</br>  is homu the widest magica?  <br>Agreed. I have sympathy for her, but I can't believe how many people swoon over a character like that.</br>  <br>was easilly the most relatable for me</br>    In the movie when Mami swings in upside down to grab Madoka for the Homulilly fight she totally gropes her boobs. No wonder Homura hated her.  <br>was sayaka old homuhater?</br>   implying rebellion is canon     <br>As watching Homu's older loops in TV series, yes. Sayak bullied popr moemura. Sayak's bullying was why she even started to steal guns and use them.</br>  <br>Is Mami's skirt revolting against the gravity?</br>  <br><br>Impressive level of samefagging, OP.</br></br>  <br><br>magical girl skirts do so they can protect the girl's decency.</br></br>  <br>Everyone's skirt seems to magically cover everything. Except Sayaka, because she's a baka with an uneven skirt or something.</br>  I don't understand how people don't get Rebellion. It's like they have no concept of how much suffering Homura went through for her friend, and how much Madoka cared for her. They also fail to understand how much Madoka sacrificed, and how much she didn't want to have to make that sacrifice. They also don't understand that Madoka's wish was fundamentally flawed, and without Homura to fix things, they would have regressed back to the way things were. People also don't understand that Rebellion was ultimately a fulfillment of Homura's original wish.<br><br>Madoka goddess still exists, as does now Madoka human. They are linked, as was shown in the final shots, but Homura has the power to keep them apart for the most part. All she did was split Madoka into two being again. In a way, you could say that she undid the massive amounts of karmic destiny that she gave Madoka in the series by removing Madoka's god-self from her body and mind. So Madoka's wish is completely maintained, nothing changed there. Ask yourself, had she not done what she did, what would have happened? The Incubators, using their new technique, would have started creating witches again, destroying the sacrifice that Madoka made. Homura has stopped the Incubators from interfering, which was a major problem to begin with. And you will recall that girl Madoka said in the movie that she could never bear to be apart from everyone, so Homura was recently reminded of just how great Madoka's sacrifice was, and she could not allow such a sacrifice to possibly go to waste at the hands of the evil Kyubey. Oh, and now she gets to spend eternity with Madoka. So that's a plus for her.<br><br>That should clear some things up for some of you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Asymmetry is cool.</br>  <br>Do you think Kyouko would ever sneak a peek up Sayaka's skirt when they were jumping around the city as magical girls?</br>  <br><br>It is the canon ending of the series and I suggest you deal with that.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't even need to peek it up since Sayaka deliberately exhibit it to everyone.</br>  <br>She was moving in a pendulum-like trajectory, so it makes sense for the wind to push her skirt against her legs and defy gravity this way.</br>  The final battle.  So guys, who's the strongest NasuVerse character?  <br>ORT or one of the other TYPEs</br>  Well actually lets exclude the TYPE's nad leave it to beings on earth otherwise the TYPE's would be the winner.  I'm working on Heavens Feel and I'm at the point where Kotomine is surgerizing her, but I have a question: Why does Sakura feel guilt towards Shirou? I mean she's the one that got raped, does she blame herself for being impure and wanting him, or what? Or am I thinking in the wrong context and she feels guilty because she kept her being a master from him?  <br>It's the latter of what you're thinking, the master thing</br>  Takeuchi's libido.

Shirou is the most likely to beat Gilgamesh than every other servant or human, his ability is almost the exact same as Gilgamesh's along with gilgamesh arrogance on using Ea at the last scene, he ended getting overwhelmed and destroyed because of his arrogance.</br>  <br>i thought Angra Mainyu was weak</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I'm gonna go with Type-Sol or maybe Type-UY Scuti</br>  <br>From Nasu its Arcuied then Ryougi followed by servant tier characters like aoko, dark sakura.

Prove me wrong.  <br>30% was Arc(normal) when she's using 70% of her power to suppress her blood-lust, 6% is after Shiki cuts her into little chunks iirc.</br>  The White Princess. She is the Ultimate One.  <br>I thought the 30% was post Shiki-gibbing?</br>  It's ORT until a stronger TYPE shows up.  <br><br> None of the Necos <br><br>What a shit ranking.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>ORT.<br>Conditionally? <br>Tohno fucking Shiki</br></br></br></br>  <br> Type Pluto <br> implying Pluto is a planet </br></br>  <br>THIS<br><br>Lancelot ftw</br></br></br>  <br>After losing 1 arm Giglamesh should have gone all out on him instead he decides to keep acting like a fucking rtarded</br>  <br>She was already using 70% of her power before the events of Tsukihime as the growing strength of her bloodlust just increased as time passed since she was created close to 1000 years ago. Shiki cutting her up decreased that remaining 30 to around 7 percent after having to stitch herself up again. Then as her arc proceeds, she loses even more energy trying to stop Shiki from getting killed by Roa Shiki.</br>  If there is a Type Moon, does that mean there is a Type for every moon of Jupiter and Saturn?    wouldn't Void Shiki be potentially stronger than Types?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Her face just says "Fuck with me.

For example, Star Platinum is Rank A in Developmental Potential during Part III: Stardust Crusaders, but is given Rank C during Part VI: Stone Ocean, as Jotaro has had many years to hone Star Platinum's power, but it's Rank C position means there was still some of Star Platinum's abilities Jotaro hadn't discovered.<br><br>For a Stand to gain an E-Ranking, it means that either their stand user discovered all of their Stands abilities, or the Stand came with very few abilities and thus cannot grow any more than it has.<br><br>So since Heart Breaker is basically one ability that is God, it's less that the stand has no utility but that the user has mastered its use. So having E rank Potential with this stand is actually more broken than a higher rank.<br><br>GGWP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dat name tho</br>  Stand Name: 「I Break Mirrors With My Face In the United States」<br><br>Stand Ability: [Air Manipulation](http://powerlisting.w<wbr>ikia.com/wiki/Air_Manipulation)<br><br>Power - A<br><br>Speed - B<br><br>Range - A<br><br>Durability - D<br><br>Precision - B<br><br>Potential - B<br><br>Description: The power to manipulate air.

I envy these people, for while their tastes are simpler, they are also more pure.<br><br>Some of us, though, keep noticing story or character elements that would be really interesting if developed or explored, and while they never are the series keeps bringing them up occasionally, as if to tease you, and just as soon as you realise, the moment has passed. I can't speak for other people, but I'm here because I'm in too deep now. This is why anyone who feels the same is hype about the YH manga, since it executes things a lot better, like allowing the characters to be actual characters.<br><br>On the matter of Ichika being dense, he wasn't, not at first. As of the first novel or three, Ichika actually had a surprising intellect and a sharp wit, as well as an actual character. He was also pretty levelheaded, especially regarding women. At some point in the novels, the author got lazy and reduced him (and everyone else) to their base harem archetypes and left them there. The anime was pretty much like that from the outset. The YH manga, incidentally, retains a degree of this characterization.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Literally just google 'Infinite Stratos Yuuki Homura'.

We finally get to see the tempest. And is that...some other variant Rafale Reveive?</br>  <br>Left looks like it was taken out of ZOE.</br>  <br>When you're done, look for his non-h IS doujin, it was pretty good as well.</br>  Could someone please post the webm of this scene?  <br><br><br><br><br>Since she pilots the Tempest she ought to be the 3rd Mondo Grosso winner aka Italy-chan right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br> Italian  <br> Looks Chinese  <br>I'm so fucking done.</br></br></br>  <br>World Purge OVA</br>  <br>They don't need to be from the country, take Tatenashi for example.</br>  <br>Other than looking like Rin how does she look Chinese at all.</br>  <br><br>This?</br></br>  So what's happening in Volume 10?  <br><br>Thank you anon!</br></br>  <br>Rehash of second season anime's ending with extra content here and there.</br>  <br>So those are the third year IS students.</br>  <br> Extra  <br>I say the introduction of 2 new characters is a little more important than that.</br></br>  <br>She was always cute.</br>  <br>How is Ichika not drowning under those breasts?</br>  <br>Is he crying? Why is he crying? We need this translated.</br>  <br><br>Rather, who is that? I thought it was Charl at first, but it doesn't really look like her at the second glance.</br></br>  <br>Those 2 new characters were mentioned before when Tabane sent those drones to IS Academy for the second time where everyone had to pair off in double team fights.<br><br>If I recall, one of them is American.<br><br>However, Rin's roommate has the superior American girl while this third year American girl's character design is missing the Converse Shoes that Rin's roommate wears.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Maya</br>  <br>It is Yamada Sensei.<br><br>Yamada Sensei is hiding Ichika under her breasts while she takes off her glasses.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed</br>  <br><br>Ah, thanks.</br></br>  <br>Is Chifuyu straddling Ichika while she is drunk?<br><br>Her other hand seems to right on top of his stomach.</br></br></br>  <br> Madoka supposedly looks like the spitting image of Chifuyu when she was 15 according to Ichika <br>I'm calling bullshit. How the fuck do you go from being as flat as Rin at 15 to this?</br></br>  <br>Oh damn, Pikachu is stacked.</br>  <br>Tabane technology, it worked for Houki.</br>  <br>Why is Ichika crying in Pika-tan's lap?<br><br>At least, I think it is Pika-tan?</br></br></br>  <br>Nohohon confirmed for winning the Ichikab owl.</br>  <br>Ichika's massages.</br>  <br>Why are they so beautiful?</br>  <br>It is, it looks just like her from Choco's other pages.</br>  <br>Cecilia comes off as so much smugger in Choco's art.</br>  <br>Daryl Casey is a 3rd year, Forte Sapphire is a 2nd year.</br>  <br>Some of the illustrations shown did not happen in the second season like the third year high school students or the appearance of the Italian IS pilot much less Ichika bathing with Maya and Chifuyu.<br><br>And the Second Season had Madoka teaming with her coworkers against the cast while the LN has Madoka fighting everyone by herself with no help from her fellow terrorists.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, she's Chifuyu's rival.</br>  <br>Fucking hell that's just too much<br><br>And not a single one of them is going to win</br></br></br>  <br>Chifuyu dropped out, though.<br><br>Chifuyu's real rival has always been Tabane.</br></br></br>    <br> And not a single one of them is going to win <br><br>But Chifuyu's in that picture, /a/non.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm starting to hate season 2 even more now, especially since they removed the bathing part.</br>      <br>Season 2 should have followed the novels.<br><br>Why did 8-Bit make anime original content instead.<br><br>And during that season, why did 8-Bit decide to produce and air 3 anime all in the very same season as well.<br><br>8-Bit hasn't gone full retard since then. Guess they learned their lesson but at the cost of making IS even more retarded than the source material.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  They should produce more IS OVAs and have the OVAs retcon IS Season 2.  <br>All the villains have the fancier, nicer looking ISes while all the good guys have the most vanilla looking ISes.</br>  <br>Not to mention all the Ran they cut out. They could make an entire season with what they cut out from 4-8</br>  <br>B: 91cm</br>  <br><br>I kind of want a reboot, but not very sure of it at the same time...</br></br>  <br><br><br>Looks like Chifuyu may have fought Madoka instead of Ichika fighting Madoka.<br><br>If I'm looking at the illustration correctly since I think that is actually White Knight we are seeing there and not Ichika's IS.<br><br>And in the end, Chifuyu rejected Madoka?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> gosh, anon. you're such a loser </br>  <br> Cecilia and Rin's trip to the water park <br> Student Council <br> Cecilia training and fighting Madoka <br> Charlotte's date with Ichika  <br> Using the IS to race and eventual Golum attack <br> Houki's date getting ruined by Ran <br>Yeah, they could. Make it happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Still best.  Shame no one did proper scans of the illustrations for Volume 9 since no one wanted to rip out the illustrations from their copy.  <br>Man, Cecilia got shafted hard in S2.</br>    <br>I'd like to shaft Cecilia.</br>    French girls are best girls.  <br>I'd unite her kingdoms if you know what I mean</br>  <br>Every time.</br>  <br> dem houkis <br>Damn!</br></br>  <br>She looks so deformed, like she's melting.</br>  <br>Charlotte's spirit lives through Akane.</br>  <br>Are they new harem members? They're holding hands, they could be gay for each other and be part of the cast.</br>  <br> they could be gay for each other and be part of the cast <br>One can only hope so. The harem is already too large as it is.</br></br>  <br>They're looking at each other and holding hands. I think more is going on</br>  <br>couldn't 8-bit technically make a 3rd season or OVA just with the content that they cut out of Season 2?</br>  <br>They actually could.</br>  So, how accurate is this?      One of the anime I've fapped most to.  <br> it's time to oil up.jpg <br><br><br> Daryl <br>Once again showing off his awful naming sense.Can't tell if suppose to be tomboy or lesbian, probably the latter. Other girl is literally who. Also the dude who scanned the pages must have ate a frosted donut right before he's got shit on his fingers.<br><br><br>Once the flat characters suffer again.<br><br><br>Jesus christ the man will never learn, will he? Hoping the new girls are only there for the sake of being at the scene at the time, don't need new girls when you've barely developed the primary girls outside of Houki, Chifuyu and Kanzashi(even if she was just "muh Nee-san").<br><br><br>I like that 1000-yard stare in Ichika's eyes, it's like he's never known a woman who'd nuzzle his head in her chest without beating the shit out of him for doing so right after, maybe Nonohon-san will win the Ichikab-Owl after all.<br><br><br>Literally can't tell if that's supposed to be Charlotte or the new girl, going to assume the former since her chest is smaller, but I want to know the story of why she's there and someone is lying dead in the hallway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      Oh, A little side note. There's an IS Doujin featuring World Purge arc by Ryusekido coming up on C88 by the way.<br><br>Not the best artist out there. And it's only 20 pages long featuring five girls. But at least it's full color.<br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=manga&amp;illust_id=51513789</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Have my long version, anon.</br></br>    <br>Thank, brah</br>  <br>I can't tell if you're blind or retarded.</br>  <br>Oh sorry, I didn't notice that bikini.</br>            The big problem with IS is that the author tries to tease the audience without delivering any results.<br>He doesn't even do a very good job at teasing. It's more like:<br>"So, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, fuck you! You aren't getting it."</br></br>  <br><br>Brit arse a best.</br></br>  I want to impregnate Charlotte.  <br>get in line</br>  <br>Is she eating the shit Cecilia cooks?</br>  <br><br>I can tell Kanzashi's on left, but who's on right?<br><br><br><br>I can tell that's Tabane on left, but who's the one on right attacking her?<br><br><br><br>Judging by the latter's "wings" not being attached, it's definitely White Knight. See pic.<br><br><br><br>From the look of things, did Madoka lose?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Forgot pick. Here.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Apologize for that. Too many files and a bit of sleepiness. Here's the correct one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I can tell that's Tabane on left, but who's the one on right attacking her? <br>Chifuyu</br></br>  <br>I'd let her parent me if you catch my drift ;)</br>  Has anything notable happened between Houki and Ichika since the latest volumes. Don't give a shit about spoilers.  <br> wanting more houki development when she already had a lot </br>  <br>Anime-Only fag here. No large real development.</br>  <br> SHOW MUST GO ON in corner <br>More like the charade if you can even call this series that at this point.</br></br>  <br>It's Charlotte, you can tell by the ribbon in the hair.</br>  <br>Actually I think it's the new girl. Pretty sure Charlotte's ribbon is tied lower but it doesn't help the new girl also has to have a ribbon in the near exact same spot either.<br><br>That being said thank you based Choco for reinforcing busty, beautiful blondes.</br></br></br>  <br>New girl has different bangs. It's Charlotte.</br>  <br><br>So I don't suppose anyone knows why there's a hand by the door...</br></br>  <br><br>I'm tempted to say that it's Charlotte due to the lack of her IS in necklace form.<br><br>Otherwise, the fact that I can't tell the difference is indicative how similar it is.<br><br>Yumizuru must be running out of character ideas. Which shouldn't a problem if he just STOPS FUCKING ADDING NEW GIRLS IN.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I think it's the new girl, notice how her ribbon is shaded, while Charlotte's normally isn't.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Neither. She just flexes her vagina muscles and the hair disintegrates.</br></br>  <br><br>Seems legit enough.</br></br>  <br><br>Go right ahead, I'll be two rooms down the hall with Maya.</br></br>  <br>I don't especially disagree with what you say, the series is pretty much going nowhere since he changed of editor but whay exatly you don't like in the linked image?</br>  I'm starting to like Cecilia. Help.  <br>Probably the QUALITY</br>  <br>No one can help you stop having patrician taste.</br>  <br><br> dream world where her greatest desires are made real <br><br> Ichika absolutely dominates her and then tries to rape her <br><br>Why is Houki so lewd?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Alas, the only worthwhile parts of season two salvaged. <br><br>Shame it got butchered the way it did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> asshole-sounding like dialogue from Ichika <br><br>So they're basically fucking the clone...or their idealized version of him... not sure how to call it.</br></br></br>  <br>So it's NTR then.<br><br>Welp. Pack it up. Nothing to see here.</br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious that you didn't read the source material.</br>  <br><br>Are you seriously trying to claim that Houki is not a slut?</br></br>  <br>Considering the author is going out of his way to emphasize how pure Houki is, it is safe to say that she is not a slut.</br>  <br>Yes, Honne is the only one who eats and enjoys Cecilia's cooking. Though in volume 9 Cecilia starts to show improvement on cooking but only easy things that can be followed by directions.</br>  <br>New girl has dark hair and that would be shown in shading. This girl clearly has blonde or lighter hair and her hair isn't tied into a braid like Forte. <br>She's sleeping so she could have removed her IS necklace to sleep and the hair style is the same. <br><br>Maybe she finally decided to pull a Laura and go sleep in Ichika's room which looks like it's next to the girls'. <br><br>Also, for how popular Charlotte is, she hasn't done a lot for the last two volumes since the anime ended so maybe this is a way to fix that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "So, you'd like that, wouldn't you? Well, fuck you! You aren't getting it." <br>This is a good way of putting it, though sometimes it feels to me a bit more like:<br> "Hey check this out, I actually can put effort into my writing. Hah hah! Too bad for you that I'm not gong to bother though" </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I guess, now that I look at it, Forte has a bigger bust.</br>  <br>Can you imagine how terrible it would look if it was based off of Choco's art?<br><br>Though what it really needs isn't just a reboot, it needs a reboot where the author puts in some effort like he did initially rather than phone it in. Either that or for him to just give up the rights to someone gives more of a shit.</br></br></br>  <br> Also, for how popular Charlotte is, she hasn't done a lot for the last two volumes <br>Has anyone though? (besides Houki, obviously)</br></br>  <br>I'm hoping it'd be Homerun if it ever came to that.<br><br>I remember in one of the author's notes, Izuru said Homura did some things better than he did.</br></br></br>  <br>Sword had some moments.</br>  <br>They could do what Homura is doing and adapt some of the Choco changes while keeping the designs Okiura.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, I guess there was her inexplicable hospital bedroom scene from V8, plus the followup in 9 where Ichika delivers some outright falsehoods about how great she is.</br>  <br> I'm hoping it'd be Homerun if it ever came to that <br>We all are, anon. We all are.</br></br>  <br> I remember in one of the author's notes, Izuru said Homura did some things better than he did. <br>As I recall, he also said he'd have to step up his game in response. I guess we'll have to wait and see if he did (all signs point to no).</br></br>  <br>It's a shame really, she had a lot of great story potential. She's still reallyyyyyy popular though.</br>  <br> New guy blonde girl wanted to sleep with Ichika, and knocked out Laura and threw her in the hallway so she could do so <br><br>There's a scary decent chance this is what happened.</br></br></br>  Oh yeah, so I heard you guys want to waste more money on this series.  <br>It got painted.</br>  <br>I agree. Watching S1 I was struck by how good her and Ichika's chemistry was, at least in comparison to the others, and she got a big chunk of the season devoted to her. Plus, the nature of her initial relationship with him was interesting, and they had a few things in common that explored them both a little. Her being knocked back in line to be a largely interchangeable haremette was a shame.<br><br>Hell, even S2 (terrible as it was) couldn't quite move away from her character stuff. Her bit working alongside him was a neat moment, as was the brief thing with her childhood. (listen to her drama CD if you haven't already, it's a goldmine for that stuff).<br><br>...y'know, thinking about it, her character kind of revolves around him. But then they all do. And it strikes me that this doesn't have to be a bad thing. They're all (to varying degrees) damaged people looking for something to latch on to.<br><br>That's a really interesting and clever hook for a harem type series, and could've led to something spectacular if Yumizuru had bothered his arse rather than play it safe. I mean, I guess I can't blame him, but fuck; what a disappointment.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That's a really interesting and clever hook for a harem type series <br>Nigga wat. That's bread and butter for harem series. Messed up girls latching onto average everydudes because "you were nice to me".</br></br>  <br><br>These were announced at WonFes right</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I mean deliberately, rather than that being unintentional subtext caused by shitty writing. Like making a point that the only reason these people are behaving this way is because they're messed up and need professional help.<br><br>A harem series that ended with nobody ending up with the protagonist because they all realised they were only chasing him to distract themselves from their real problems (and a lead who wants no part in a romantic relationship) would have been something I've never seen before.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, along with Azone Rin</br>  <br>I hope the other Dolfies get restocked</br>  <br>What happened to you, Hayate? You use to be really into this series and even defended it at times but all your posts this thread have just been negative and cynical.</br>  <br>It's just haremshit dude, don't blow an artery trying to analyze it.</br>  <br>Infinite Stratos just got to him, I suppose. Perhaps it's the inevitable end result for us all.</br>  <br>That's just it though; as a rule I don't analyse things, I prefer to take a work at face value and I have no patience for 'deeper meaning' or any of that bullshit. Then I watch/read IS and it keeps hinting that it could have a bit more depth and not delivering. I put my thoughts in order about this stuff back when all I'd done was watch S1, and everything I've seen since then only seemed to confirm those thoughts.<br><br>Also, I know it sounds crazy, but harem doesn't have to be bad. There's plenty of room for entertaining story or engaging characterization, it's just that most works don't aspire to be anything more than cheap T&amp;A. Which is fine too, just not in such quantity.</br></br></br>  Holy shit. My thread from last night I thought was going to slip into oblivion has survived. <br><br>I'm impressed guys.</br></br>  <br>IS threads sometimes cling to life, like an elderly relative that just won't croak.<br><br>This time it was because of the scans though.</br></br></br>  <br>That's only because of the volume 10 scans.</br>  <br>It's a very love-HATE relationship.<br><br>I love it because it gave me pic related.<br><br>I hate it because Yumizuru has proven time and time again he is a twat in every sense of the word with the delays and whining on Twitter. He has released a whopping 3 volumes since S1 first aired 4 years ago. 3.<br><br> Ishibumi has released 10 volumes of High School DXD. <br> Kamaxhi.exe has released 10+ volumes of New Testament <br> Hell even Kawahara has released a bunch of stuff for SAO and Accel World <br><br>See the pattern here?<br><br>The dude captured lightening in a bottle once and has done absolute jack fucking shit with it. The first few volumes were a bit of a mish-mash because he was still world-building, but even now there's still very little indication that the world of IS is in anything resembling a "female-dominated" society.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's a very love-HATE relationship. <br>For me it's kind of like an abusive relationship. I started with it because I was convinced there was good in it, and I don't leave because I'm convinced I can still see it every now and then. But mostly, it just batters me with a lamp.<br><br>Yumizuru may be a twat, but Homura clearly cares about the material and he's been the one putting out the most content recently. The sound stages were good too, as was the 4koma.<br><br>Basically, every IS work produced by someone other than the original creator is actually pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>And that is one thing sad about IS. There is so much potential there and it is all left to the wayside. No mention of the political upheaval, the change in society from technology, or how fucked the world because the IS can only be used by women. But hey we got some great waifus.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget potential character drama ignored in favour of reducing those characters to harem archetypes. What I wouldn't give to have snarky Ichika back.</br>  <br>I'm holding out because 9 and 10 haven't been translated and all we have go by is images and they don't tell a complete story. <br>I wish Teh Ping didn't give up so easily or at least looked for help before calling it quits. But he's strange and I think IS just isn't for him. <br><br>I do however wish IS to end, I feel for a harem it has gone on long enough. You can only do so much with a harem which I feel is why he introduces new characters every other chapter to fill in roles to keep it going. But 10 is a good spot to start winding down and ending the series. If he hates it as much as people believe he does, he would try to end it but I feel publishers give him enough money to keep going. It's hard to turn down a ton of money.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just want it to quietly die rather than live like an Alzheimers patient, huh? Well, I can't blame you. <br><br>I think there's still time to decide to have an actual story (be it plot or character driven), but he's certainly left it a while to really start with that.<br><br>What it comes down to is that judging by his early work on the series) he could certainly have written such a story from the get go. But he lost his passion for it and was reduced to shitting out whatever drivel he could be bothered to to keep the money coming in. <br><br>About the best you can hope from him is that seeing the quality of Homura's work lit a fire under his ass and drove him to do better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   They switched to CHOCO <br><br>I want to see IS as illustrated by  Raita </br></br>  I guess its too much to have an ending where the government encourages Ichika to breed all of them, even his sisters, in the hope he can pass on whatever allows him to pilot an IS to more male children.    Hayate, you still here?  <br>I had no idea the manga was a reboot. I'll check it out, but why'd they decide on a reboot?</br>  <br>Publisher switch.</br>  <br>Because the art for the original manga was trash.</br>  <br>Fuck no, I just imagined it and it's fucking ugly.</br>  <br>Oh when you said reboot, I thought literally the world was rebooted</br>  <br>I'm always here.</br>  <br>I just want to ask, why is Cecilia such a slut?</br>  <br>I got to say, I admire your dedication doing that as long as you have.</br>  <br><br>Wasn't she supposed to be some kind of badass in season two?<br><br>What happened?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She became a slut.</br>  <br>S2 happened.</br>  <br>I say that one of the reasons Homerun Ichika is so good is that he's very much alike the early LN Ichika. If the anime &amp; entire LN had Ichika be the same as his early LN self, it'd be plenty better.</br>  <br><br>serves you right for listening to noveltroll</br></br>  <br>She was shown to have no morals when she poisoned/blew-up her betters.</br>  <br>It wasn't a troll, she was suppose to fight Madoka while she was in Silent Zephyr because it's Blue Tears' sister unit. She gets her ass beat and then she trains and learns to bend her laser beams and fights her again.</br>  <br>Kanzashi happened.<br><br>They rushed a bunch of shit so they could introduce her, including most instances of anything that could be considered character development for most of the girls (save Houki of course). S1 was 3 volumes of content. The first half of S2 was 4-6 with a bunch of stuff skipped (Ran, Ichika being part of student council, you name it) so they could get Kanzashi in and make money off of her being the nerdy anime-liking girl.<br><br>So shit like Cecilia training to bend beams was skipped, and instead of winning albeit a Pyrrhic one against Madoka like she did in the novel, she had to job in the anime so not only could Kanzashi diffuse the bomb, but so Ichika + Houki could stop the big bad and end the season.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not take spoilers. It's true. She has a fire everything at once move that's like a 1 shot kill that damages herself also and can bend lasers.</br>  <br>Kanzashi a best girl, though.</br>  <br><br>They cut it to make room for the episode about Char's pantsu</br></br>  <br>That episode made it AOTS.</br>  <br>But I liked the Valkyria Chronicles art.</br>  <br>Why is Houki so violent?<br>Why is Tabane so crazy?<br>Why is Rin so flat?<br>Why is Tatenashi so Mary Sue?<br><br>The world may never know.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I almost purged that episode from my mind, why you do this to me.</br>  Devil's Advocate time<br><br>Praise something about season two no matter how much you hated it overall<br><br>I for one thank it for giving us a new round of doujins</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br><br>it gave us foxgirl shrine priestess Houki<br><br>Which I think we can all agree is best Houki<br><br><br><br>Because I refuse to suffer alone</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder if there will be a another season of this.  probably not    <br><br>I'd rather a reboot at this point with a different studio</br></br>  <br>Stonking great tits.</br>  <br><br>These two</br></br>  IS is interesting as messy rom-com stuffs that are mostly equivalent to side-stories or short-stories are much more focused compared to any other drama or actual story development, unlike any other armor-featured series <br>It works for me but  I welcome anyone who can convince me that this is not the actual selling point </br>  <br> Chifuyu-nee will never ride you fast and hard <br><br>Why live</br></br></br>  Ichika's a good guy, better than I remember. I don`t remember this from the anime though, it`s been 4 years, afterall.  <br><br>He did protect Houki from the bullies in the first season. So he's pretty nice despite being dense.</br></br>  <br>Original content from Yuuki Homura. Just like how Akahoshi Kenji show Cecilia's past.</br>  <br><br> not accidentally grabbing his raging boner <br><br>Missed opportunity</br></br></br></br>   Such a lovely child cannot be a girl <br>Best doujin.</br>  <br><br>I'm for any doujin where Ichika gives it to Char i9n the butt while still thinking she's a guy</br></br>  <br>Homura is a Houkifag though.</br>  <br><br>So?<br><br>The creator is too<br><br>Just be glad the show runners were all Char-fags</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should be a Charfag</br>  <br> Just be glad the show runners were all Char-fags <br>Why did they make such a disservice to her in S2 then?</br></br>  <br>It's not as bad as you make it sound.

Even with the changes?</br>  <br>maybe but how would they continue it on a remotely decent note with all the cutting done? that and I think IS has fallen out of favor even with japan. S2 more or less highlighted the flaws of vols 4-8 than their strengths.</br>  <br><br> best girl not even shown <br><br>Do you even Blade Dance?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You sure? He's always been the nee-san type considering how many h-manga involving incest he's drawn. I think he likes Chifuyu more.</br>  <br>From the looks of it, I don't think the nips really cared for that aspect. Not many series reach the 20k threshold, especially with all the changes that season 2 brought.</br>  <br>Oh and accurate numbers.<br><br> 23,566 *1 IS: Infinite Stratos 2 [BD+DVD]: 2013/10/30 </br></br></br>  <br>Not denying he has favorites, but he doesn't let it get in the way of the writing both the manga and his other IS doujin stuff (non-H). Otherwise he wouldn't have bothered with that Tanned Rin short doujin.<br><br><br>Twilight sold alot, does that make it a good story? NOPE.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The nips are weird, you've all come to the conclusion they buy this just for their favorite girls right? Though that can apply to other series.</br>   new Blade Dance novel <br> new IS novel <br>Is this real life?<br>New Haruhi novel soon?</br></br></br>  <br>Ah fuck yea this was a terrific picture</br>  <br>there's limits to that, especially with how S2 was basically the Fake russia season. Then again there's a reason why the phrase "japan has shit taste" is largely said.<br><br><br>It still hasn't come out yet? perhaps it's just as well as that has definitely fallen out of favor.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there's limits to that, especially with how S2 was basically the Fake russia season. Then again there's a reason why the phrase "japan has shit taste" is largely said. <br>But Sword-chan is fucking great.</br></br>  <br>As a girl herself, she isn't exactly terrible, the real issue is all the sueness surrounding her.<br><br>I also realized part of why S2 might have sold: they might not have known better, that sort of thing happens with adaptions: the original content gets obscured. That and/or hope that it went in a better direction than the novels.</br></br></br>  <br>Char is the most popular, everyone loves her, just focus on her and it prints money.<br>But no, they fucked it up and ruined Char just to spite us and gave us a lackluster spin off manga to rub it in.</br></br>  <br>Well, it did take 9 years for Crest of the Stars to get a new volume.</br>  <br>Waaaaaaaaaaaaah<br>Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaah</br></br>  <br> gave us a lackluster spin off manga <br>Hitsuji Takako is a Charfag himself, seeing that he was doing Charl doujins before he was tasked to do Sugar &amp; Honey.<br><br>You said it yourself<br> Char is the most popular, everyone loves her, just focus on her and it prints money <br>to play it safe and not kill the golden goose, put out a Charl spin-off done by a Charl-fag.<br><br>I guess that's how low the people behind IS thinks about its fans. After all, they did put out a VN where the best end is just a reset end. A fucking cop-out compared to Toradora or OreImo where the MC can hook up with someone else other than the titular character in the epilogue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if the new game will fix that or if they're just adding new mechanics like the massaging and Tatenashi and Kanzashi routes.</br>  REMOVE BROOM  <br>Damn, Char sure has a serious case of back rash.</br>  <br>I wouldn't get your hopes too high.</br>  <br>Tatenashi and Kanzashi already have routes in the first game. It's just that there's a hierarchy/priority system in place that you will go to the route of the girl with a higher placement if you maxed out the affection of two or more girls.</br>  This is Kanzashi.  <br>Broom a cute! (when she isn't trying to smash your head in)</br>  <br> when she isn't trying to smash your head in <br>But that's everybody aside from Kanzashi.</br></br>  <br>that varies depending on what material; LNs? I can believe that.</br>  <br>Everyone was tons more violent in the anime though.<br>Violence level goes anime &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; LN &gt; Yuuki Homura manga &gt; 4koma &gt; Charlotte manga</br></br>  <br>Tatenashi hasn't done that either, or at least not directly.</br>  <br> what is the ending of Electronic Brain World </br>  <br>I don't think the 4koma incarnations were more violent than Sugar &amp; Honey.<br><br>Unlike in Sugar &amp; Honey (where one of the girls seem to placed as Charlotte's rival), the 4koma has them getting along quite well.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh... remind me what happened again.</br></br>  <br>“…You woke up?”<br><br>Eh, huh? Somebody’s on the bed next to me.<br><br>“…”<br><br>I opened the curtain without hesitation, and saw Tatenashi-san, putting on her shirt without wearing a bra.<br><br>Boing, the busts are still as nicely curved as before—<br><br>“WAAAAHHH!? I’M SORRY! I’M SORRY!”<br><br>I hurriedly pull the curtain back, but it’s too late. The lance of the IS ‘Mysterious Lady’ immediately stabs over.<br><br>“I, chi, ka, kun~? This onee-san won’t allow for anything like this, you know…”<br><br>“I’m sorry, I’m sorry! Tell me to do whatever you want me to do, so please forgive me!”<br><br>The lance immediately stops.<br><br>“You’ll do anything?”<br><br>…Geh, I’m dead.<br><br>“Y-yes, anything that can actually happen in reality…”<br><br>I affirm tentatively. At this point, the tip of the lance is already pointed 1cm away from my neck.<br><br>“Th-then—”<br><br>I hear the sound of a gulp…eh?<br><br>“P-please…do perverted things to me too…”<br><br>…<br><br>……<br><br>………<br><br>“Eh…?”<br><br>“I-I heard it from Kanzashi-chan! You did all sorts of lewd things in the computer world at your own whims, right? I don’t allow it! The student council doesn’t allow it! The student council president doesn’t allow it!”<br><br>“N-no, erm, that’s the trap set by the hacker.”<br><br>“Yo-you still want to argue? You’re trying to argue back? Are you trying to argue back?”<br><br>Wh-why is Tatenashi-san being so angry? Speaking of which, I think there’s a huge misunderstanding created here…<br><br>“Erm, Tatenashi-san, please calm down…”<br><br>Or else my neck’s going to be stabbed through by the lance.<br><br>“How do you expect me to calm down!?”<br><br>It hurts! The lance reaches over and pokes at my skin.<br><br>“Uwah! An-anyway, please keep the lance!”<br><br>“Ah, sorry…”<br><br>Her voice soon calms down, and her lance disappears into light particles.<br><br>“…”<br><br>“…”<br><br>What follows is silence on both sides.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I only watched season 1 of the anime.<br><br>Does his sister also fall in love with him?

I know nothing happens but nothing really happens in IS either.

I think Homerun is trying to tell us something.  <br>Oh man. That sly motherfucker.</br>  <br>Saved.</br>  <br>That he traces his own work?<br>Or that he pushes that incest ship like a USS Ronald Reagan-class tugboat?</br></br>  <br>Bitch, I'm the mayor of Flavortown</br>  Replace Ichika with a confident, manipulative alpha male and this series would be a billion times better.

Don't ruin her by trying to make her a guy.</br>  <br>What about this kind of gay?</br>  <br>This is fine.</br>  <br>no idea perhaps some sort of absurd rebelling against the harem tropes running amok in canon IS.<br><br>Though Char's very much a top notch package, and making a girl like Char isn't easy as yuo can't just slap a bunch o niice traits together and expect it work as you might end up with ASUNA that way.</br></br></br>  <br>hypocrite</br>  <br> Charlotte is the most beautiful girl in IS. <br>Considering she can convincingly disguise herself as a guy, I highly doubt that.<br> Don't ruin her by trying to make her a guy. <br>She was introduced as one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Considering she can convincingly disguise herself as a guy, I highly doubt that. <br>Pretty boys are in vogue.<br>If you want an actually butch Charlotte, look at Daryl.</br></br></br>  <br>I support all ships.</br>  <br> Considering she can convincingly disguise herself as a guy, I highly doubt that. <br>Ran compared her to a super model when she saw her. So I doubt your doubt. <br><br> She was introduced as one. <br>Novel it's easy since there is barely any art. In the anime, everyone called it the second Charles was introduced.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I like how Choco gave Charlotte thicker eyebrows to make her male disguise ever so slightly more convincing without making her look ugly.<br><br>Choco has a lot less sameface compared to Okiura in general.</br></br></br>  <br>They didn't say a manly guy, but "Charles" was pretty enough to attract girls and likely screw up some guys.<br><br><br>depends on what areas; though Choco varies up the hair more.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ran compared her to a super model when she saw her. So I doubt your doubt. <br>Considering Ran is a straight girl, I doubt her ability to judge the looks of other girls.</br></br>  <br>Not really as a straight person can see how another person of the same gender being attractive, the rare part is the girl (rin) taking it well.</br>  <br>It's different for girls, they acknowledge each other's beauty.

Why would you care what they think, let alone visit them enough to know this?</br>  <br> Japanese girls are somehow the tallest, most well endowed, most beautiful, AND the most athletic members of the cast <br>Truly Yumizuru's nationalism knows no bounds. Except for Kanzashi. She got the short end of the YAMATO DAMASHII stick I guess.</br></br>  <br>She's meganekko moe though</br>  <br>Why does Japanese girl have blue hair and red eyes?

Not a fucking perfect Mary Sue more beautiful than Virgin Mary like everybody else. And she isn't a violent cunt either.</br>  <br>What? Kanzashi is instantly superior just for not being a massive and incredibly grating sue.</br>  <br>At least she isn't a special snowflake named after an incredibly overrated sword</br>  <br>Katana is a generic term for swords in Japanese though. She isn't named AFTER a particular sword, her name is LITERALLY sword.<br><br>Which is worse, really.</br></br></br>  <br>Still a better name than broom.</br>  <br>She's just a useless sack of shitty writing traits that exists only to be worfed all the time. The best part of volume 8 was her getting shot and not mugging for attention for a whole entire chapter, a record since her introduction.
