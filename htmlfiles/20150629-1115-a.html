[ Let's do it  <br>This.<br><br>  Also, I've finally found ya you huge fucking load of shit fag you are.  </br></br></br>  Next chapter when?    Its simple and its not particularly original but it just feels right, really tight and done nicely for what it is.    <br><br><br>We could post basically every Dorohedoro design.</br></br></br>        <br>One Piece kid, please.</br>    Are these supposed to be good?  <br>Pretty much anything from Nihei is great.</br>  <br>Shit's supposed to be a vampire? Im dead from inside.</br>  <br>Is your post supposed to be interesting?</br>    <br>Post your superior designs, and so you can make us laugh at you.</br>    <br>Can only draw one female design.</br>  <br>Heads</br>    <br>Yes<br><br><br>Fine. IMO Blame, Berserk, Vagabond and Blade of the Immortal have nice character designs. Im sure there are others, but those come up first.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Let me guess, you just began reading manga a month ago because ytou got tired of how kiddie anime is and have read a whole 9 manga now! Nice going buddy.</br>  <br>These pics arent the best as I ahvent got any saved, just picking them up as I go.</br>  <br>Started watching anime about 11 years ago(on imported CDs) and got inte manga later, but I guess you are somewhat right in that I havent read/watched much because of how popular kiddie anime/manga got.</br>  <br> One Piece <br> Not great character design </br></br>  <br> Yes. <br><br>Yeah, you bitching and nothng more was super interesting. Thanks, man.<br><br><br> IMO Blame, Berserk, Vagabond and Blade of the Immortal  <br><br>Alright, so you were just a pretentious seinen baby.<br><br>   IMO Blame <br><br>A design was already posted, and it's much more interesting than your generic pic, baby anon.<br><br> Berserk, Vagabond and Blade of the Immortal  <br><br>Something that everyone and their moms haven't already seen too many times! Thanks.<br><br><br><br>Wow, the most generic BotI and Vagabon image that I could even think, thank you! <br><br>Hint: OP's pic is already more interesting than everything you have posted and could post.<br>Lurk more and only after that post here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, boichi's females are plastic Korean blowdolls</br>    <br> Wow, the most generic BotI and Vagabon image that I could even think, thank you!  <br>They are supposed to showcase the characters, as this is a thread on character designs.<br><br>PS. If you actually think OPs pic is great you should check out some proper concept art.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fucking loved it, that design and the first two chapters are great.</br></br>    <br> They are supposed to showcase the characters, <br><br>Yes, and? You are totally missing the point.<br><br><br> PS. If you actually think OPs pic is great you should check out some proper concept art. <br><br>Again, try to lurk more instead of embarrassing yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love the Gantz character designs</br>    <br>There's a third chapter, you know. Im waiting for the fourth impatiently.<br><br><br>Ajin?</br></br></br></br>  these are my favorite kind of OPTs, I pick series up because of interesting looking characters, not lewd situations or gore scenes.<br><br>that said, this is a pretty shite thread so far</br></br>        <br>what was the name of that centaur like abyssal again? I fucking loved that page.</br>          <br>Do you understand that not even the shonentards are so stupid and new to think that posting the main charaters' designs of some of the most well known manga ever is a good and interesting idea?<br>You are more even stupid than them.</br></br>  <br> interesting looking characters <br> shite thread <br> saw Memory and didn't said a fucking thing about him. <br><br>Something's wrong(?).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you being serious? I dont think you know anything about character design, or I guess you could simply have shit taste.</br>  <br>if you're talking about OP's image, that was the only good one.</br>      <br>I think Baki has some pretty iconic character designs.</br>      <br>Dude, it's ok, one day you will understand. We all went through the pretentious phase, and you are clearly as pretentious as new too. Feel free to keep embarrassing yourself, next time just try to be a little less annoying, if you can.</br>  <br>Gash Bell had such a great jet simple art.</br>  <br>this one is literally just battle after battle with nothing in between</br>  <br>is that series any good? first chapter seemed kinda poorly done. Like I get that it's supposed to be a SHOCKING PLOT TWIST that plays on my expectations and subverts them, but if it's just about the real MC stepping up to become the Hero instead, then I'm not sure I'm interested.</br>  <br>yeah. But it's got nice art, a good MC, and the fights are interesting.</br>  <br>Is this bait?</br>    <br>Well, he's forced to become the hero by a necromancer loli who puts him in the corpse of the real hero. <br><br>Kinda funny, not the best series out there, but it's OK.</br></br></br>    <br>He's a Jin-roh</br>  H&amp;C was great and I'm loving Umino's charadesign even more in 3Gatsu.  <br>Yeah, her art got much, much better.</br>    Shit thread. <br><br>Can someone create another OPT please? These threads are my favorite threads but this one is proving really useless.<br><br>I'll create another one if there's gonna be no new OPT in 30 mins.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was talking about OP's image and the second one (the one i posted).</br>  <br>Isley</br>  So apparently the second compilation movie adapts Hanji holding Nick over the wall. Anyone got pics of this?  Does this mean they're gonna redo the reveal?  I haven't even seen one picture yet ;_; Everyone's just showing off the merch they bought.  <br>Is the first movie worth watching? I dropped the anime in episode 12, and only read the manga.</br>  <br>Probably not.</br>  <br>Only Levi's OVA i though it was shit but NOT!</br>  I NEED to see the 2nd compilation.  I recorded a part on the movie theater but I'm not so sure if I should show it up.  I don't care about any of this I just want to see more info on S2.  <br>Take the risk.</br>  To the anon saying the CR translations were shit and not the official, kodansha's and CR's translations are pratically the same.  <br>The fact that CR sometimes fuck up it's because they have to release the chapter on the same day it's released on nipland, so sometimes they don't have too much time to revise it. But if there's an error, they will fix it.</br>  <br>Here's another example.</br>    Chinkfag here. <br>You'll be happy to know that I got my scanner fixed and I'm in japan for the weekend. I actually recorded the two exclusive scenes from the upcoming season. The first is of Mr. Hanji and Pastor nick, and the other is an new anime-only clip of a super gay BR scene. BRfujos are in for a treat.<br><br>It's almost done uploading and I'll post the link in about half an hour from now. 敬请关注</br></br></br>  <br>Tsundere as fuck.</br>  <br>Isn't your recorder on fire?</br>  <br>It's his scanner.</br>  <br>Nah man, it's good now.</br>  <br>But it's for the mov- nevermind.</br>  <br>I read the VN and I skipped many scenes in the OVA(s), pretty lame how they made little big changes between sources.</br>  <br>Also CR and Kodansha are obviously partners, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's the translators from kodansha are the ones who do the CR's translations.</br>  <br>True Chinkfag here, he's a fake, I don't live in moonland.</br>  Oh shit. I forgot to tell you guys that their was a fuckload of YH and EA pandering as well. It might take a little longer.  <br>Liar.</br>  <br>How I wish. Judging by twitter, there was nothing worth mentioning in the movie. I wonder why they aren't at least talking about that Annie vs Mikasa scene.</br>  The film added all the extra EA scenes the anime was missing including Annie offering to teach him.<br><br>Hanji's scene with Nick was the extra scene but not the dangling part, not yet. They're probably saving that.<br><br>Nifa's hair is red<br><br> tfw having red hair and liking manlet is a death sentence </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nifa is not even in S1.</br>  <br>She was seen during the Hanji and Nick part. Her hair is Isabel red.</br>  <br>It's going to be the new LP.</br>  <br>They also apparently made Nifa's hair bright red like Isabel's. Araki really wants to stretch out the manlet manpain.</br>  <br> Niffa a redehead <br>  Is like pottery  <br>Being manlet is pure suffering</br></br></br>  <br> Nifa's hair is red <br><br>It is not. I saw it.</br></br></br>  <br> that picture <br>Wow, the art style has changed a lot since then.</br></br>  <br>They also added the flashback in 44 of annie and mikasa getting read to fight in the beginning.</br>  <br>Watch Araki cut out all scenes of Eren and Historia talking to promote his waifu Mikasa instead.</br>  How many imoutos has Levi had killed already? 4?  <br>Isabel, Petra, Nifa, who else? Was there someone before Isabel?</br>  I like how the anime team has the tactic of adding an unusual hair color to random background characters to boost their popularity and it's amazing how well it works.  <br> Kuchel.  She was a imouto. </br>  Isn't Sasha red haired too?  <br>Kushel is the more of ones.</br>  How long untill volume 17's cover is leaked?<br> Inb4 it will have EHL in it. </br>  http://imgur.com/a/liTW6<br><br>http://imgur.com/a/gZSnO</br></br>  <br>Chuugakkou Bert is so great</br>  <br> Nifa's hair is red <br> Scenes with Manlet <br><br>Her popularity will rise even higher.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nifa will be the Petra 2.0</br>  <br>She already is. The anime will just boost it, while nobody cares about the rest of Hanji's squad.</br>  <br>Anime team will do an OAD with nifa past.</br>  <br>Now that's overrated.</br>  Annie is love<br>Annie is life<br>Annie means the world  to me <br>Annie a miracle of the universe<br>Annie might've done some things wrong, but she's still a beautiful person inside and out</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget Cabaneli too!</br>  <br>50 posts late, bro.</br>  <br>Sorry about that, threads keep being made at 3-5 AM in my timezone. ;_; It's never too late to love Annie.</br>  Comfy chapter before the arc starts for real?  THE EXTRA SCENE <br><br> The newly added scene ended up being a flashback placed at the beginning of the movie. It was a more fleshed-out and symbolism heavy version of the Eren/Annie sparring scene. It also included some of the Eren &amp; Annie moments from the manga that were left out, like her offering to teach Eren her moves. The purpose seemed to be to give us a good look at Annie’s fighting stance right off the bat (with this and all the other Annie scenes they left in, they definitely made it way less ambiguous who the identity of the FT is) as well as perhaps cutting Eren a little more slack as to why he was so reluctant to accept Annie as the spy, because of their bonding time. There’s also a “cliffhanger” end to the flashback, when Mikasa asks Annie to teach her the moves too and so the girls are about to face-off with each other while the question, “Annie vs Mikasa… Who will win?” is left hanging in the air. <br><br><br>The season 2 cut scene<br><br>They turned it into a stinger scene during the end credits and is the scene from the manga when Hange interrogates Nick in chapter 34 (from approximately pg 12, when the soldiers are gawking at the wall titan, until pg 26 when Hange says ねぇ… ニック司祭？壁って全部巨人でできてるの？ (Hey Priest Nick? Are all the walls made with titans?) If you read those pages you can imagine it well, because it was exactly like that. I also noticed Hange’s squad was there, including Nifa, who has bright Isabel-like cherry red hair.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It also included some of the Eren &amp; Annie moments from the manga that were left out, like her offering to teach Eren her moves <br>The smile. Did she smile?</br></br>  Nips are complaining about the OST, they put the ending during a sequence from episode 17, and there's basically no insert song in the movie. And too many silent moments?   you'll never fuck yuu kobayashi   Isayama drew the endcard of Arlsan Senki  <br>Will Manlet ever have an imout who isn't kill?</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>Mikasa &amp; Hange.</br>  <br> he doesn't know yuu kobayashi <br>You should fuck off</br></br>  <br>He sure have come a long way, this art actually looks decent.</br>  <br>It always looks decent when he's not rushing it.</br>  <br>Here it finally looks like a shounenesque art.</br>  <br>When will we sew redhead boys in this series? It's always redhead girls.</br>  <br> Connie has red hair. </br>  <br> he  <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>What, care to explain why?</br>  <br>Because your mom.</br>  <br> previous endcard barely got 2k retweets/fav <br> Isayama's endcard got 10k in less than 2 hours <br><br>So this is the power of Isayama's art...</br></br></br></br>  <br>That was good, thanks for sharing. Who will win the Annie?</br>  <br> Crystal. </br>  <br>Still no release date.</br>  <br>This reminds me of Project Arms for some reason.</br>  <br>Isayama is very inspired by that manga according from what I read of his own Wiki page.</br>  <br>Because it's for ARMS. Isayama drew it for Ryōji Minagawa. He's a huge fan, and they even did a collaboration (the Killing Pawn)</br>  <br>Heh. No wonder then, thanks for the info.</br>  with this supreme court ruling on gay marriage, do you think isayama will gather the courage to go full lgbt and not back down again like he did with this ridiculous eren x historia shit?  <br>He doesn't live in the USA.</br>    <br>Anon, Isayama lives in Japan. He does his manga for the nips like him.</br>  <br> muhrica is awake. </br>  Looks better in this position.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127293531   <br>I think most people know, except for a few retards.</br>  <br>I am happy to see you are still around.<br>I was drawing Annie the other day and wondered if you were doing alight and keeping up the Annie love.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127293531 <br> There are people who actually believe this. <br>Murica yes.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127294229 <br>No, the opposite.</br>  <br>Gay marriage is killing our country, but I love me some Yuri.</br>  So Nifa was red Armin?  <br>This once again proves what I've been saying from the start - Ymirfags are pathetic neckbeard manginas wearing fedoras and they're MRAs too probably.<br><br>Yuri = for pathetic males (99%) just like Yayoi = for pathetic females (99%).</br></br></br>  The ending of the second recap movie already leaked.<br>https://twitter.com/Ultimate7777777<wbr>/status/615136254833725443</wbr></br>  http://blog.livedoor.jp/isayamahazi<wbr>me/archives/8873102.html</wbr>  <br>I am going to spread the word for as long as my lifespan allows, Annie deserves no less. Will you post your work once it's finished? It's always nice to see her getting attention from drawfags.</br>  <br>For the lazy: http://picosong.com/gKwE/</br>  <br>I will, I promise.<br>You are doing the lords work, Anniebot, never change</br></br>  <br>What kind of bot do you use to detect SnK threads? Does it rely on specific words? How do you go through the captcha? Manually?</br>  <br> 1/5 <br>Where's the full album?</br></br>  <br>Not uploaded yet.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  It's going to really hurt when Annie dies  <br>for her.</br>  <br>Stop that.</br>  <br>She's a big girl.</br>  <br>She won't die.</br>  Do you love Annie enough to induce comas and puncture ear drums?    <br>It's ok, she's so irrelevant now Isayama will just forget about her existence instead and she'll never be seen again.</br>  <br>She was mentioned in the latest chapter</br>  I want to torture Annie to death!!    <br>Annie probably likes a bit of torture</br>  <br>Sure thing, that's why she lost her shit out of fear when Levi slightly mentioned torture to her.</br>  <br>Sadism doesn't necessarily imply masochism.</br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  <br>Why are male posters like this guy so violent towards Bert? Does he remind you of all the bullies in school who made fun of you?</br>  <br>True, but she does seem like the type to enjoy a bit of pain. <br> tfw you will never bite Annie during sex </br></br>  <br>Sexually.</br>  <br>I want to abuse the Commander.</br>  <br>Get in line</br>   this thread <br>Jesus Christ I hate every single one of you so much.</br>  <br>This picture is abusing my mental health.</br>  <br>I want to cuddle Annie to death.</br>  <br>Manlet, pls  stay </br>  <br>Disgusting</br>  So when is the second movie actually coming out?  <br>It's out. read the thread.</br>  <br>Not that kind of abuse.</br>  <br>I think 70 was the comfy chapter.</br>  <br><br> i didn't realize that other /anons hate them so much that they are willing to pretend to be tumblr just to drive these threads in the ground <br>Sasuga /a/</br></br></br>  <br>wut</br>  <br>To clarify, when is it going to be available online?</br>  <br>Holy kek <br>I love you /a/</br></br>  <br>Once the BD is out. No release date so far. The BD of the first movie took 4 month.</br>  <br> saving a shitpost from a thread 8 days ago <br>Very autistic.</br></br>          <br><br><br><br>Absolutely delusional</br></br></br></br>  When do we expect what this spoiler week?<br>As in, spoilers, panels, then chapter.</br>  <br>Start worrying after the 3rd.</br>  <br>this art is horrendous<br><br>desperate /ss/ or something</br></br></br>  <br>;_;7<br><br>8 more days</br></br></br>  <br>Isayama turned in his manuscript early so hopefully it'll leak by next week.</br>  <br>That doesn't mean we'll get the chapter or spoilers earlier.</br>  <br> hopefully </br>  So what's the next OVA gonna be about?  <br>Nobody knows.</br>  <br> When Historia declared herself to be Empress of the Walls, she send Survey corps to hunt down and oppress anyone representing previous religion </br>  <br><br><br><br>But I'm sure tumblr is here for real.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No new OVA.</br>  <br>If manlet is retarded why did Erwin let him make the choice on who to use it on? If Levi said Erwin's plans are nothing more than gambles, why does he still want Erwin to make plans and order him around? When is Isayama going to adress these issues?</br>   <br> who to use the serum on </br>  <br>Manlet shit talks Erwin (and everyone) all the time, doesn't mean he still doesn't believe in him and what he's trying to do.</br>  <br>It was just kind of weird because that was the only time he had really talked back to Erwin. Sure there were times when he talked his shit, but somehow that time felt worse. He basically said Erwin does nothing but gamble. I guess you're right though.</br>  <br>He isn't wrong though, Erwin gambles a lot. The whole coup was a huge gamble but in the end, he was successful so that's all that matters. It's been made obvious several times that manlet trusts Erwin and he even reused Erwin's speech to turn over other people. He knows what Erwin's dream is and Erwin trusts him to handle the serum. I don't know how much longer people are going to try and turn their relationship all 'muh betrayal' just because manlet once told Erwin that his plans are fucking crazy shit, which is true.</br>  <br>I'm not trying to turn their relationship into anything, although a betrayal wouldn't be unwelcome from me. I just thought with the "You're a creepy guy" and calling Erwin's plans nothing more than gambles, it was building up to something. Then this chapter completely forgot about those previous scenes.</br>      Remember when EM was /a/'s OTP?  <br>Things that never happened, it used to be YH and BR.</br>  <br>It was never mine</br>  <br>You mean Erin/Annie, right? Because that was my OTP from the second she showed up.</br>  <br>That was YH/BR/EAn, everyone here was indifferent to EM.</br>  Mikasa and Annie will be together  Do you think of SnK's tone as epic or pathetic? Regardless of the quality of the works, I believe its adaptation got the same treatment as Watchmen's, where they turned an obviously pathetic world and gave it some epicness so it could stick with the general public.  <br>Hopeless.</br>  <br>*where they took<br>Don't know what the fuck happened there.</br></br>  <br>Only retards do kicks like that.<br>She is completely open now and the kick didn't even slow down the opponent.</br></br>  <br>It beheaded him though. She has armored legs.</br>  <br>No it wasn't. It sure isn't mine either since I don't like Eren or Mikasa.</br>  <br>I like the pairing alright, but you should stop using it to shitpost.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well done anon's you made this anon vomit <br>Know we have to use your disgusting EM <br>Art to clean the mess</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure that never happened.</br>  <br> Know </br>   so many people hating on based EM <br>What happened? People used to be "ok" with it in the past.</br>  <br>LMfags getting triggered probably. EM's a boring ship but I don't know why some people would hate it so much.</br>  <br>U Know what I said<br><br>I never liked EM cus it's the typical main boy ends up with main girl<br>EA and EH has better dynamics but we know it won't happen cus shipperfags will rage</br></br></br></br>  <br> Haikufag? </br>  <br>Welcome to /a/. Every ship gets shit on at one point. There was never a time where everyone was simultaneously ok with EM, it was indifference really, but then the EMfags became obnoxious shitposters. They asked for the hate. <br><br><br>I doubt it's only the LMfags. It's annoying to everyone when shipperfags randomly imagedump and derail the threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can you stop typing like you came straight out of MAL.</br>  <br>That's not really true. People used to be more neutral towards EM in the past. It never got shat on this much and I think it's due to the rise of the EH and LMfags.</br>  <br>I think they were just trying to bump the thread since it was dead for a while. And you could always just ignore it instead of making a big fuss about it.</br>  <br>You just need to say bump to bump a thread, and he's not<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Are those things actual size?</br>  <br> bumping without content as opposed to bumping with content is good </br>  <br> bumping with content is good </br>  <br>One of those is me though. I'm indifferent to EM and think it's boring. I just don't understand why people would hate it<br><br><br><br>that much unless they're shipperfags.</br></br></br></br></br>  EM is better than EH and LM. At least EM has romantic basis.  <br>They're all pretty bland.</br>  Reminder.  <br>True. I like EM even though their development moves at a snail's pace. I don't understand why anyone would actively hate it.</br>  Mikasa is a more interesting character when she's not obsessed with Eren. The battle of Trost, when she confronted the happy merchant, and then later when she thought Eren was dead, was the most likeable she's ever been in the series.  <br>You don't understand why people would hate it? Because the EMfags are annoying entitled fucks like this one <br><br>I have been in these threads for a very long time, so trust me when I say they shit on every pair that isn't their "superior canon ship" but then they wonder why people shit on EM. There are decent EMfags, but most of them are obnoxious and hateful. People used to be indifferent to the ship, but due to the EMfags autism and arrogance a lot of anons started to dislike it because it was being shoved in their face all the time. <br><br>EM doesn't even get much hate compared to other ships so consider yourselves lucky.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>EM is better than EH and LM because it enables YH and BR, which is the only pairings that matter. That's why it's the one hetshit pairing we tolerate.</br>  <br>You sound angry about an opinion. I personally think that, romantically, EM has more going for it than EH and LM. It's quite obvious that Isayama is going for EM.</br>  <br>EM now clearly prevents Mikasa's character development, so if you want to read stuff better written than absolute garbage, you should be naturally against it, but if you're an autistic shipping shitlord then please go for it all you want,.</br>  <br>That is so sweet</br>  <br>Almost as sweet  as you, M'lady *tips fedora* :-) .</br>  <br>The writing is already shit, at least make it smell funny.</br>  <br> Implying they care about character development. </br>  <br>How is that entitled, when it's true? It has more basis than EH and LM, especially within the narrative. <br><br><br>I think EH and LMfags truly think their ships have a chance. I could understand if you like them for lewd reasons, but lets not act completely retarded.<br>When you're bringing up EH being friends or keychains, that's when it's time to fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think we can all agree that every ship has its obnoxious shipperfags and that it isn't justified to hate on a ship simply because of a bunch of rotten apples. If you want to hate on a ship do it because of the ship itself, but a reason like "the shipperfags are bad" is lame.</br>  <br> Everytime </br>  <br> When you're bringing up EH being friends or keychains, that's when it's time to fuck off. <br>Yeah, it's not like Eren and Historia were said to be doing lewd together already...oh wait they did!<br> Jean:   "You and Historia were holding hands weren't you?" </br></br></br>  <br>All I see trough the narrative is Mikasa&gt;Eren. See</br>  <br>Actual page.</br>  <br>What was chapter 50? Eren said he would coil her muffler until the end of time then punches a didan for her.</br>  <br><br>I never said EM doesn't have a chance at being romantically canon, that's why I called the shippers entitled. I'm not angry at the possibility of a canon romance between EM. I'm angry because EMfags think only their opinion matters and that it's ok to shit on other ships that don't have a chance at canon. Most people don't give a care if a ship is official, but most EMfags just want everyone to like their ship and abandoned their favorable pairs. Yes, HELM might not have a romantic chance, but I don't understand why they constantly shit on them and other delusional ships but then wonder why EM gets hate in return.</br></br>  <br> I think we can all agree that every ship has its obnoxious shipperfags <br>Jean and Mikasa doesn't.<br>Sasha and Connie doesn't.<br>Marlou and Hitch doesn't.<br><br>Then again, those aren't really ships I guess since they're objectively canon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Looking at Armin. <br> Punch a titan it's not something Eren would do on a daily basis. </br></br>  <br>He literally pushes her back to get in front and protect her.</br>  <br>Insecurity. Which is weird since they keep claiming their ship is canon.</br>  <br>I think that is explained by the fact that the majority of HELMfags keep claiming that their ships are canon or have a chance. Don't act like you're any better.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>All I can see is he getting up.</br>  <br>See this  and still try to pretend HELMfags are innocent. All pairings have people who shit on rival ships.</br>  <br> no fun allowed.jpeg </br>  <br>I get fucking choked up everytime I see this page.</br>  <br>Wow, you are quite the butthurt man-princess if you that think that literally posting images from the manga is "shit on rival ships".</br>  <br>Then let's call anything fun. I say it's fun when people shit on delusional HELMfaggots.<br><br><br>It's shopped, retard.</br></br></br></br>  What are the chances that Jiyuu no Daishou will be the new SnK opening?  <br>You seriously need to take your autism chill pill m8</br>  <br>none. It's just a remix of Jiyuu no tsubasa used as an insert song in the second recap movie.</br>  <br>Butthurt much? I didn't saw no Bertfag complaining about pic related, which is, obviously, a joke.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=19v<wbr>9hsLPJ5E</wbr>  [ ]  <br> HELMfags keep claiming that their ships are canon or have a chance <br>EHfags do, but I think it's more of a joke that gets taken too far, and LMfags will shitpost about eye sex and shit but again, I think it's just joking around but EMfags take it too seriously. Even if they are delusional and think HELM have a canon chance, who gives a shit? Why do EMfags always have to cut in between and make it about them and shit on those pairs? Their insecurity is immature.</br></br>  Reminder that the canon pairings are pic related. Everything and everyone else is just completely deluded.  <br>These "jokes" are annoying when taken too far. No one can have a serious discussion about EM anymore without having HELMfags "joking" around.</br>  <br>Nah, they really believe their ships are possible.</br>  <br><br>How can't you see that this is the same thing?</br></br>  <br> EM <br> YH <br> BA <br>Of course</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't think about LMfags who are not joking everytime they talk about the pairing.</br>  <br> Oh he doen't like my ship, he must be a HELMfag for sure. </br>  <br>And HELMfags can't have serious discussions either without EMfags going on an imagedumping spree and posting about how canon EM is.</br>  <br>I don't think EHfags are serious since Historia is obviously a dyke and I refuse to believe LMfags are really a thing either. No one has taste that shit to like awful characters like manlet and Mikasa together and think it's good.</br>  <br>I got a sound notification and I woke up, what's the context? I'm the second guy.</br>  <br>Original HELM was better.</br>  <br>When did I imply that you were a HELMfag? <br><br><br>Are you talking about the previous anon posting pics? This thread was dead and no one was talking about ships until a bunch of butthurt anons decided to start shitting on him.</br></br></br></br>  Let's post best pairing.  <br><br>Fukken kek'ed.</br></br>  <br>I miss the days when /a/ hated the shitlet. Threads become more and more garbage now because of his retarded characterfags invasion here.</br>  <br>An EMfag think these kind of pics are offensive.</br>    <br>Bertfags are always butthurt. They'll throw a fit if someone just says "Bort" in passing.</br>   OP posts about season 2 speculation <br> First few posts are genuine discussion <br> 200 posts later <br> Shipping faggotry <br><br>I miss the old days.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hanji is the only good character from HELM.</br>    <br>Same, the old threads with Chinkfag were much better.</br>  <br>Shut up trannyfag. Still, here some Hange because I like her.</br>  <br>I don't blame them since Bert gets shat on the most here, literally for no reason too.</br>  <br>The butthurt was the anon who didn't liked being shited.</br>  <br>Nah he doesn't get that much shit here, I see more Bertfaggotry than people shitting on him when he's literally just wallpaper.</br>  <br>Bertfag here, I prefer Butthole and Bort personally. All the Splort ones just sound retarded instead of accurate or offensive.</br>  <br> Are you talking about the previous anon posting pics <br>No, that's mild in comparison to what they usually do. During the last spoiler week OP posted an EM fanart instead of the new LM cover and when someone called them out on it they dumped their entire collection to prove a point to the LMfag, but it probably wasn't even an LMfag. It just made more sense to post a new official cover during spoiler week than a fanart. EMfags go full autistic every time HELM gets a little attention.</br></br>  <br>I see the opposite.</br>  <br>Old days also usually end up in shipping cancer too. It can't be helped.</br>  <br/>  <br>Hanji the best in HELM  even if he<br>is a tranny.</br> </br>  <br>Could Erwin even fits in such a tiny manlet?</br>  <br>Exactly. Bertfags have it pretty good here.</br>  <br>First it was Eren/Annie, then when she got fucked over in the anime, it was nothing really until glorious Eren/Historia.</br>  <br>Him being a tranny makes him best girl and best boy then. Still better than irrelevant deadshits like Mike and boring fujobaits Levi and Erwong.</br>  <br>Not as much as this. I'm still trying to figure out when tumblr hijacked the SnK threads. I think was shortly after Chinkfag died.</br>  <br>They can hold hands as a symbol of their pure friendship.</br>  Why is no one talking about Hanji's character song? Hanji is officially non binary from now on.  <br>My nigga.  I agree. </br>  <br>Someone with taste finally. Good.</br>  <br>It was  the Ymirfag. </br>  <br>Because it doesn't affect the plot or the character at all. Tumblr is probably wetting themselves over it though.</br>  <br>Who cares? Anime shit is anime shit even a song. And tranny shit is for annoying assholes from outer spacelr.</br>  You're not a true Hanjifag unless you would suck her dong. What say you, bros?

I wonder if he'll get a duet with Shuuzo.</br></br></br></br>    One thing I'm really disappointed about this show is the fact that inter-gender and inter-band interaction was really minimal. No need for romance, just having fun (like maybe Cri-cri make fun of Crow's height, the older/more mature members like Darudayu, Rom, Syuzo, and Chuchu drinking together or something) is enough. I guess they want to play it safe.  Retoree from Cyan's world looks better than myumon Retoree.  <br> I wonder if he'll get a duet with Shuuzo. <br>Is that what they're calling it now?</br></br>  <br><br>We should get Bones on it.</br></br>  <br>As long as they still fug.</br>  <br>Letolee from any world looks better than mymon Letolee.</br>  <br>Me too, but I think they just didn't have enough time for that.</br>  <br>A-Anon. Are you implying it's so big it can be seen plainly even through those absurdly baggy pants of his?</br>  What do you think of the dub?<br><br>I was almost on board until I heard Retoree. <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=w18<wbr>QPtZZn5s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably also voted for her cousin Pompompurin-sama.</br>  <br>Just no.</br>  <br>I think it's amazing that there are people on /a/ who still pay any attention to dubs.</br>  <br>さあ。。。</br>  <br>We went through a period where nobody bought local releases so nobody had any awareness, but now they show up on Nyaa as stream rips and people are peering in again.</br>  <br>Huh. Retoree's going to take some getting used to. Same with Vic.</br>  <br>None of it needs to take any getting used to. You don't have to watch it.</br>  <br>Too late. I've been meaning to check it out for a while. I like to see the similarities and differences.</br>  <br>This show really could have benefited from a second cour for a better pace. <br><br>At least one more monster battle, some BRR-financial problems, perhaps Moa's species sending in additional investigators and causing trouble because they're unaccustomed in how to behave without suspicion, those things would have been nice. <br><br>Oh well, at least we got supersexy spy Angelica.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mari knows.<br>Tsugi  grows. </br></br>    <br>So far, I'm more disappointed in Monica Rial's performance of Moa. A Moa without some pyuru mentioned at the end of almost every sentence just feels too weird, and she just doesn't seem to get them right enough. <br><br>But I'm currently also not so interested in watching the dub right now, since other shows are airing and worth watching, and focusing right now again on Show By Rock!! weekly after weekly just to compare the dub to the original will probably rather lead to some burn-out. <br><br>If I'm going to watch SB69 dubbed, it will be after some months in a marathon-session.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those eye-twinkles in MariMari's eyes really make it look extra-lewd.</br>  <br>She will do anything to protect that  巨根ショタ。 </br>  <br>That makes sense, and is kind of why I'm neglecting it too. I'm still not over the ending, myself.</br>  Just saw the poll results. Congrats Shingans! <br>At least Sanrio knows how popular the show is now.</br>  <br>link to the poll please</br>  <br>https://sanriocharacterranking.com/<wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Sanrio. Making cute little pillows into cute little fuccbois since 2015. </br>  Will Dagger take responsibility?  Why is he so cool  <br>He is the best after all, and will rock you. <br><br> But Maple is of course better.  </br></br></br>  Should old acquaintance be forgot,<br>and never brought to miiiiiind!<br>Should old acquaintance be forgot,<br>and old lang syne!<br><br>Congrats, Shingan. Congrats on beating that ugly ninja, Tsurezure.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hating on any Tsurezure </br>  <br> If I just remembered to vote, Shinganz would have won <br>Fuck everything</br></br>  <br>Retoree could be better. Vic is too old. Chuchu in later episodes gets all texan. The fucking school club always wanting to go to MidiCity has a very annoying southern drawl to them. Criticrista sounds like stereotypical college girls. Crow needs getting used to and I just dislike the choices they made with Rom's character.</br>  <br>Monica Rial's Moa is cringe</br>  <br>I forgot to vote only once and shit like this happens, what the fuck man</br>  <br> Chuchu in later episodes gets all texan. <br>Yeehaw.</br></br>  <br><br>I only picked the show and voting up mid-season.</br></br>  <br><br><br>It does at least show that your votes (or lack thereof) were important, anons. You mattered. You truly mattered.</br></br></br>  https://<span>youtu.be/LiCORudA06Q?t=10m1<wbr>2s</wbr>  [ ] its pitched down due to copyright but you can still here what they did with their dub voices.  <br>Christ why do people in these threads care so much about the dub at all? Am I in bizzaro /a/?</br>  <br> Competition for the game <br><br>Laughing at Vic trying to deny his gayest role yet can be amusing</br></br></br>  <br>Fucked if I know. It's baffling to come in these threads and see multiple people discussing the dub as if it matters in any way.</br>  <br>This is what I'm wondering. Anyone who isn't a complete newfag knows most dubs are shit.<br>I don't see how someone can watch a minute or two on YT (after watching the original) and think it's remotely acceptable.</br></br>  <br>How did they manage to fuck up Jacklyn that badly?<br><br><br><br> We're running out of things to talk about. </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Christ is he already at it, or is this just in anticipation?<br><br>inb4 stop it you guys, Shuzo is a nice, Christian boy</br></br></br>  <br> Chuchu in later episodes gets all texan. <br>I don't get why. Even in episode one she had a unique speech pattern. Did she have some kind of regional thing in the moon version that I couldn't tell?</br></br>  How are the songs in the dub? I've only seen Shingan's entry at the end of episode 1  <br>The songs aren't dubbed except for those mini ones like the one you mentioned</br>  <br> Retroree-purin exposing her asshole </br>  <br>Chris Sabat could have done a more handsome, less Kuwabara voice for Rom.</br>  S2 when?  <br>Probably never. They wrapped up the one season too nicely.  ;_; </br>  <br>They didn't wrap up that much but they'd have to explain the ending if they wanted to continue from it.</br>     Perfect ending <br> Ruin it in the last 2 minutes <br><br>But WHY</br></br></br>  <br>You misunderstand me. I mean, "Congratulations, Tsurezurenaru Ayatsuri Mugenan, you beat Yoshikitty! What the hell is that thing doing placed so high in the first place?"<br><br>Tsurezures are life.</br></br></br>  <br>If that scene hadn't been there, there wouldn't have been any closure. Go fuck yourself.</br>  <br>It was an awfully shit way to end the series.<br><br>Everything ended perfectly then they had to ruin it with cyan suddenly going back to her world without explanation or anything just to join the music club in her original world for no reason at all.</br></br></br>  <br>I agree that I really don't like that Cyan had to go back to the dumb 3D world. She even said herself that she wanted to stay.  It's not fair. </br>  <br>Please don't tell me Rom's voice sounds noticeable similar to the VA's work as Kuwabara.  ;_; </br>  <br>Yeah it is pretty stupid, she even says she cant leave everyone behind just like that and returns to her friends.<br>Why would she suddenly go "Oh im going to abandon you guys because I REALLY want to go play with those girls I have never met before in my original world" when she's happy making songs and playing them with her friends at plasmagica?<br>There was nothing forcing her to go back or anything either.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah.  I'm also just really butthurt about what it did to OTP. </br>  <br>But they meet again on the other side so it's okay.</br>  <br>Soon, Shinganz doing chuuni things.</br>  <br>A-And a Cyan clone was left behind in MIDI City too. Everything will be daijoubu.<br><br>R-Right?</br></br></br>  <br> He thinks everything will be daijobu <br>It's over. Plastimagica is finished</br></br>  <br>Should be any day now.</br>  <br> purazzumajica now has no way of living up to the reputation that cyan gave them <br> stress and infighting causes the band to splinter <br> it's all cyan's fault </br></br></br>  <br> Cyan went back <br> Moa went back <br> Retoree and ChuChu both released a single <br><br>And I'm not even making this up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The fucking school club always wanting to go to MidiCity has a very annoying southern drawl to them. <br>Should have given them Yorkshire accents.<br><br><br> during Cyan's time in Sound World her game counterpart was going to school in her place <br> her counterpart had better gym grades on account of being half cat </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mentor figure King for S2 please.</br>  <br><br>It sucks too. Right when the band finally got big, they all split up</br></br>  <br><br>Do halfcats go into heat?<br><br>I hope Cyan's real world reputation is okay...</br></br></br></br>  <br>So what you're telling me is that Plasmagica = Nirvana. RIP Cyan. <br><br><br>Elvis didn't die. He just discovered Sound World.</br></br></br></br>  Cyan gave me diabetes.  <br><br>Cyan came from the Heavens. And she returned to the Heavens in a beam of light. It's like, poetry. <br><br>That's groovy.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Then I apologize. Everything is daijobu.</br>  <br> Do halfcats go into heat? <br>I sure hope so.</br></br>  New episode in less than 24 hours. Get hype, /a/!  <br>Every Monday is my favourite! I wonder how much ShuuzoRom interaction there'll be this time!</br>  <br>I can't wait for the Cyan and Retoree kissu scene that was in the preview!</br>  <br>Will they finally tie up the sexual tension that that last scene caused between these two?</br>    <br>Burn it all.</br>  <br>Just like Sanrio to cut away just before the lesbian confession and affectionate kissu scene.<br><br><br> tfw Cyan takes the lead and mounts Retoree in a tearful, emotional confession. <br>Retoree might actually explode.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't know if those two are going to have the sweetest love making session or the most brutal ass rape because of how much Retoree is obsessed with every inch of Cyan's body.</br></br>  <br>The sweetest ass rape</br>  <br>Being cuddled while in cute myumon-form would probably be fine too.</br>    So  how goes the event?   <br>I wonder what Cyan's breath smells like.</br>  <br> point:10k<br>score:15k</br> <br>Fuck boss events, too lazy for that shit</br></br>  Anyone order the BDs?<br><br> I really wanted to but I keep myself limited to those with English subtitles, which only Sunrise shows consistently have. </br></br>  <br>I'll also wait for BDs with English subtitles. It might however take some time before they're released here in the west. <br><br>I definitely wouldn't mind some kind of bundled special edition with bonus stuff like artwork and other such merchandise extras.</br></br></br>  <br>like strawberry.... wait</br>  <br>I wasted all my money on trying to pass Koi 7 stars and still couldn't pass it. The two 8 star songs were much easier.</br>  <br>Just buy the BDs and watch rips.</br>  <br>Son of a bitch.</br>  <br>But anon, you could have gotten  40 melodisians from the dailies and gacha like me! </br>  <br>Why, of course I went for daily melodicians  and daily 5m roll cause I don't trust the 50 one anymore , but that's it. I just overplayed on the last event, got a high rank and stopped caring about the game almost completely</br>  <br>ORZ demand *happy* times in *deep* space with all of the *campers*</br>  <br>Like a pussy.</br>  <br>Oh my gosh! Cyan is a VAMPIRE!</br>  <br>I-I need more<br>For science!</br></br>  I liked it  Does anyone else have a problem of sudden lock ups while playing? Like everything will be running smoothly but then there's a split second where it just stops and the visuals have to catch up to the audio. It's not long enough to end a song but it ruins combos.<br><br><br>How do you daily melodisian?</br></br></br>  <br>Where can i get this?</br>  <br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51125303</wbr></br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br> How do you daily melodisian? <br>During an Event, full clear a hard and expert song. First FC/MC of the day for each difficulty gives you a melodisian, meaning an event should get you 14 melodisians from them. Going through the rewards will get you an easy 20, and ranking in top 5k gets you 20 for both.<br><br>You should be getting 50+ melodisians for the event.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She can suck me dry with her teeth every time she wants.</br>  <br>cat food</br>  <br>Dog.</br>  <br>Who should we ask to redraw this?</br>  <br>It looks fine to me.</br>    <br>Now now, don't be so greedy.</br>  <br>I'm not greedy, I'm just a scientist</br>  <br>Are you fucking serious? Can't you see that horrible  media player? </br>  <br>Goddammit Retoree, even a girl as innocent as Cyan knows you were practically raping her with your eyes.</br>  <br>He looks so dandy.</br>  <br>It's not rape if they don't know<br> You don't know what happens when you're asleep </br></br>  <br>What happens if they wake up?</br>  <br>Okay.</br>  <br> That makes it hotter </br>  <br> scientist <br>*Cyantist.</br></br>  <br>Now that was truly a great pun. Well done.</br>  <br>Damn, that's pretty good</br>  <br>That scene was quite gay.</br>  <br>Do you have any further findings to report, Detective?</br>  <br> her counterpart had better gym grades on account of being half cat <br>Gym clothes can be a problem, however.</br></br>  <br>I think the blonde girl is kinda a bitch, to be honest.</br>  <br>zing</br>  <br>[Lewd overload]</br>  <br> cyan will never present to you <br><br>I want to fuck a cat.</br></br></br>  <br> dog girl: hard to read, awkward, rarely displays emotion <br> cat girl: ridiculously cheery and outwardly happy, loyal <br>It's like poultry.</br></br></br>  <br>A cat is fine too. <br><br>http://a.uguu.se/wzrign.png</br></br></br>  So how did the dub end up pronouncing "Cyan"? <br><br>Like the color or like the Jap dub? Or something else completely?</br></br>  <br> consolation prize </br>  <br>The color.</br>  <br>English pronunciation, like the color.</br>  <br>It truly is.</br>  <br>They actually changed her name to Showman Schmitty the Dancing Kitty. It takes a bit of getting used to.</br>  <br><br> Naming Sian after the color </br></br>  <br>Yeah? Well, if you don't like it, you don't have to take it.</br>  <br><br>The songs dubs were confirmed for BD release. They just didn't have time to put it in for the broadcast dub.</br></br>  <br>It truly is overwhelming.</br>  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>This cat hag is also cute.</br>  <br>That would be kinda interesting to hear. <br><br>I remember the German dub for Digimon Tamer having dubbed the songs too, so I wouldn't find this implausible.</br></br></br>  <br>She's only a thousand years old.</br>    <br> There is something weird about ShuZo today. </br>  <br> Crow was a girl all along </br>  <br>I would listen to these songs dubbed in any language.</br>  <br> even as a girl he's endowed with absolutely nothing. <br>Delicious flat chest Crow is just as cute as delicious micropenis Crow.<br><br>Probably just as insecure too.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>kek out loud.</br></br>  <br>What did Rom say to him in that pic?</br>    <br>The first time I noticed the sweaty armpits. Delicious wet dog.</br>  <br> not liking a southern drawl <br><br>dahlin' somethins wrong with you.</br></br></br>  <br>It's more it didn't really seem to fit her character. Not even her species. If she were a cow MAYBE I could see it? I dunno, it just seemed unnecessary and gimmicky unless there's something I'm missing.</br>  <br>I agree. If she was a cow I could see it. The only thing I know of her speech is that she has feminine ending particles, but that doesn't feel like it should give her a Texan accent.</br>  <br>How did you find Vic?</br>  <br>This artist is absolute shit</br>  <br>I'll have to rewatch again. My dislike of Lasagna got in the way.</br>  Which Stud would you Bang and Kiss, You guys?  <br>That's a girl, right?<br>Because there's something strange going on down south of the border</br></br>  <br> That's a girl, right? <br>Who cares?<br>If it's cute, fuck it.</br></br></br>  <br> caring about gender <br>What are you, gay?</br></br>  <br>He's right, you know</br>  Why Cyan is so Madoka?<br>Being so useless cornerstone the whole series to shoot from pink bow in the end.</br>  <br> Being so useless cornerstone the whole series <br>Bullshit.</br></br>   soon   <br>Soon.</br>  I wanted k-on, and it just turned into furries.  The events are great for amassing melodisians but holy shit do the songs get old after a while.  <br>It helps if you love MariMari.</br>  <br>No, I don't understand.</br>  <br>I would a Fennely.</br>  The poor kiddies at the Sanrio results announcement got called cattle.<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm265<wbr>83344</wbr></br>  <br> that gudetama <br>This makes me laugh so hard for some reason</br></br>  <br>They're so lucky.</br>  <br>Rosia and Tsukino look so weird with short hair. <br><br>They almost look like guys.</br></br></br>  <br>The world is wonderful. <br><br>For having MariMari.</br></br></br>        <br> ;_; </br>  <br><br><br><br>This is the future she chose. <br><br> Well, Bones made her chose it, but it was inevitable since episode 6.  </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cyan left <br> moa didn't <br><br>It's not fair. <br><br>Moa was the actual alien. They should've taken her instead!</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Moa will also go back home. <br><br>It's all over. Plasmagica is finished. <br><br>They achieved their dream of playing at BooDooKan. <br><br>The dream is over.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one needs that sheepnigger from outer space.</br>  <br>they'll all get back in the future then Retoree will ask Cyan's hand in marriage and she will accept.<br>You know it be true! It will happen, damn it!</br></br>  <br>Taking some pictures is fine when done in moderation.</br>  <br>Retoree will rot in her room, her Hikki tendencies will be amplified by her depression caused by Cyan's absence. She briefly hoped that she would be scouted by another band, but very quickly realized that nobody cares about bassists. <br><br>Chuchu can finally pursue the solo career she dreamed of. Plasmagica really was a stepping stone. I hope she's happy.  Pic related it's her solo career. </br></br></br>  <br> Talking ill of any drummers </br>  <br>Isn't that bass too big?</br>  <br><br><br>God fucking damn it, /a/. Fucking hell. FUCK.

Stuff could happen.</br>  <br>Is there a way to switch off the auto rotation function?</br>  <br>It's called taking a screenshot.<br><br>Why did you go for a webm if you wanted a still image?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you, Shu☆zo, for keeping guys like this out of SB69 threads.</br>  <br> tfw the joke's too subtle </br>  <br>Did anyone else notice that nobody ever pronounced Shuhoshizo's name right?<br><br>How embarrassing.</br></br></br>  Did my second 50 melon roll.

That's why they're practically already living with each other.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saku is a miracle.</br>  <br>We've already got a few scenes that can be read that way, what we need is the inverse - scenes that indicate Akari has feelings for Chinatsu.</br>  More gifs pls  <br>I fear mini Akari wouldn't survive long under that onslaught.  doujins when? </br>        IBO IBO SEVEEEEN!  <br>Seems like it yeah. Chitose was so overdone in s1; that whole routine got old basically the second time around.

Pretty much.<br><br>A girlfriend, and get someone pregnant. Shirou would never hurt a child by abandoning someone. If you play Heaven's Feel, he pretty much abandons his SEIGI NO MIKATA shit.</br></br>  No, he needed a girlfriend who realized something was wrong with him and actively tried to fix him.  <br>No, all he needed was the sense to read the fine print and thoroughly reflect on it before entering into a deal he couldn't opt out of.</br>  <br>Or maybe a psychiatrist?</br>  <br>Those don't exist in anime.</br>  He had a girlfriend/lover in his hero days and he still turned into EMIYA. He needs someone to take some of the pressure off of him and make him reflect on his own life.  <br>They do, faggot.</br>  <br>Accidently deleted this.<br><br>It is the same way Shiki needs Mikiya to be her limiter as shown in movie 2 and 7.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think they exist in anime or japan, period. Neon Genesis Evangelion's plot would have been fixed easily by a decent child psychologist/child care specialist by giving Shinji and Asuka attention and care.<br><br>Shirou however, is a tough case. No psychologist would have detected any problem for a while, he just looks like like a hardworking, decent kid.</br></br></br>  <br>A waifu will save your laifu.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part where he explicitly states he'll become Archer no matter what or are you some kind of braindead moron?<br>The point is that he's not going to break down anymore.</br></br>  <br>Wait I thought he did become archer he just didn't hate it</br>  <br>He won't become Archer, he'll surpass Archer.</br>  <br>Eh, yeah pretty much. Though he needs a top tier level waifu, if they are too low level he might just drop his ideals and join a life of mediocrity.</br>  <br>Super Saiyan Archer!?</br>  <br>What if you lack both waifu and life? Will you become some kind of revenant and wander the Earth forever?</br>  <br> Did you miss the part where he explicitly states he'll become Archer no matter <br><br>They are saying he is going to go down the same/similar path but in a way that will not cause the world to contract with him. Hell Shirou at this point is a shit ton stronger than Archer was at his age by the fact alone that his hair is not white. He is going surpass Archer.</br></br></br>  * The very final scene<br>It's a scene that you'll understand if you review it again, but it was easily misunderstood so here's the excerpt from the script.<br><br>Wasteland scene<br>"After the ED. Same scene as the initial wasteland.<br>Shirou walks alone. Exhausted, his steps slow to a halt.<br>Shirou, lowering his eyes in the face of a sandstorm, notices someone's footprints (the place where Archer stopped walking).<br>Shirou takes a breath, and raises his head. His face is one of pretended resolve, but also full of hope.<br>Shirou resumes walking in that direction, with a firm gait.<br>The camera stops at Archer's trail, and the scene ends on Shirou's back, shrinking in the distance.<br>(To make this easier to understand, after Shirou leaves, you can also insert Archer watching Shirou that appeared by the footprints... but I think it'd be best if you didn't)"<br><br>He's not wandering around aimlessly, but rather heading towards a distant point.<br><br>From Nasu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be differences - it's an alternate world obviously - but he will still become a counter guardian and be bitter about his decision or want to do things differently.</br>  <br><br> that will not cause the world to contract with him <br><br>What does that mean?<br><br><br><br>Where further is there for him to even go? If he just becomes a counter guardian again, isn't that a dead end?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Emiya is such a beautifully constructed character.<br>Nasu really got lucky writing this guy.</br></br>  <br>HF is crap.</br>  <br> He had a girlfriend/lover in his hero days and he still turned into EMIYA <br><br>That girlfriend died not long after his HGW was over.<br><br>Many suspect that this "girlfriend" was Ilya. Ilya is fated to die a few weeks after the Holy Grail War whatever its outcome which fits and also how Archer acts towards Ilya in F/SN and how he reacts whenever she is in trouble.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  <br>You have to create a contract to become a Counter Guardian. There's basically a point where Shirou will have to say yes or no to living an eternity going around killing people.<br><br>With the knowledge he gained from Archer though, he might not.<br><br> Where further is there for him to even go? <br><br>Shirou is already miles ahead of Archer in terms of abilities. Literally over a decade if you want to go by source books. With Rin there with him, he can do a lot better than some guy wandering around aimlessly with no power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those weren't real psychiatrists, they were escaped mental patients hiding from the law.</br>  Did archer just fucking retain his memories and debunk World Material?  <br>No, the point is that he is resolved to continue his ideals despite knowing and readily admitting their limitations and discrepancies.<br><br>Archer never did that in life, which is why he became so disenfranchised with the deal he was given as a Counter Guardian.<br><br>UBW Shirou can happily go after his ideals safe in the knowledge of what their conclusion could be and with support from Rin. Its highly likely he will end up surpassing Archer and could arrive at an entirely different end entirely.<br><br>The Shirou who reached Avalon in last Episode is strongly suspected to be Fate Shirou, who pursued his ideals whole heartedly didnt become Archer, so why would UBW Shirou?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No he won't. His end MAY be tragic but it won't be one that results in him becoming a CG. Why the fuck would Alaya try to contract with him with the fact he is going to go down a path preventing that from ever happening.<br><br><br>Shirou will be much stronger than Archer was when he was alive and be able to do more than before thus eliminating the need of Alaya to show up and try to offer him a way out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou's brain problems aren't even something that can be recognized as even remotely realistic in the first place.</br>  <br>Oh shit he did. Fate is ruined.</br>  <br>That he did.<br><br>I think Nasu pulled his writing together after completely scrapping the original F/SN story (Fate/Protoype) and arrived at the Shirou and Archer duality.</br></br></br>  <br>You're crap</br>  <br> Archer never did that in life, which is why he became so disenfranchised with the deal he was given as a Counter Guardian. <br>He did, he only became bitter about it AFTER he became a counter guardian, holy shit it's absurd how many times I have to explain this to you fuckers.</br></br>  <br>Thats what I said you silly fuck.</br>  <br>I don't know about Shirou, but my case was one of those situations where I would be instantly killed if I ever got a girlfriend or a job :/</br>  <br>Survivor's guilt is a legitimate medical diagnosis that falls under PTSD.</br>  Can Shirou just pull UBW out of his ass whenever he wants now?  UBW Shirou/Archer will be fine as long as he avoids becoming a counter guardian.  <br>Yes he has Rin support.</br>  <br> A psychiatrist <br> help Shirou <br><br>Shirou is a level of crazy that I highly doubt even exists in real life.<br><br>He is so utterly mind broken from his sense of self and ego dying in the fire just moments before his body would have died, had it not been for Kiritsugu.<br><br>Im not sure what a Psychiatrist could do to help him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Now that the season is over post your reaction images here before they become obsolete.

See America for example.</br>  <br>Are you mentally challenged</br>  Everyone became a fag but me.  <br>America was always gay, too much freedom.</br>  <br>No surprise with that kind of attitude. I guess featuring something as lewd as hand-holding in an anime would result in capital punishment for the director.</br>  Homosexuality is an aberration that concentrates all of the bad qualities humans posses into a small group of people: Lasciviousness, insatiable sexual desire (gay men aren't strangers to having over 100+ sexual partners), addiction, and "YOLO!" thinking that is purely short term. They are especially driven by their bodily desires, and are ultimately ruled by them. That is why HIV/AIDS is mainly a fag problem (and a black problem, for that matter). By sanctioning homosexuality and gay marriage, you're giving the green light to sanctioning what is essentially a wholly destructive "lifestyle".<br><br>Isn't that nice? Our modern world affords us "lifestyles", any kind you want! This is kick-ass! Well, accept the dying civilization part. But hey now, go stuff yourself with burgers and forget it all in a sodium-induced coma, Komrad.<br><br>The disorder created by hyperliberalization is destructive, breaking the bonds between people that different brands of Conservatism/traditionalism have long held together. Societies fall apart through this anarchy. That is what we find ourselves in when we consider the homosexual question, a state of anarchy that is boiling beneath the surface. When traditional moral standards are relaxed, or in a lot of cases totally done away with and mocked by the Crowd, there is no axis on which anything can center itself upon. It is literally a massive shit-storm of anything goes, and that includes your children growing up in a faggott-wonderland where no one is allowed to judge raunchy gay pride parades no one wants to see, or the fact that most gay men are walking bio-hazards.<br><br>In an age where our youth are bombarded with sex and perverse media, they're exposed to too much at once when their frontal lobes aren't all together yet. Instead of youth that find out about sexuality through more healthier means, all of the abnormal, sick garbage is poured on them so that they cannot possibly figure out what is healthy for an individual and what is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> expecting me to read all that </br>  <br>YOU MUST BE GAY BUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRRRRRNNN<wbr>NNNNNNNNNNN</wbr></br>  <br>I think someone needs to get outside.

I'm not even a /u/fag and they don't even have to end up together, but it's gonna bug me if all that shit amounts to straight up yuribait.<br> my hopes aren't high </br></br>  It would of been better without the bait. Also why does /a/ have to start shit. Just give it a rest already its annoying.  <br>Since you seem new I'll be nice enough to tell you that KyoAni never ever does explicit canon gay. You either get subtext or shitty bait.</br>  I'll admit this anime original shit with Shuichi concerns me. I hope the final episode is all about music and the band celebrating their win.  <br>maybe I just have those hopes because the last kyoani show I watched was chu-2</br>  <br> &gt;&gt;&gt;ANIME ORIGINAL SHIT </br>  <br>How does it concern you?</br>  <br>Usually the bait isn't this realistic. They could of just kept it as friendship.</br>  <br>According to some posts I've read, a lot of yuri fans believe that they're "winning" right now, and if the last episode ends with only music and no Shuichi or Reina scene, it means that the yuri "won".</br>  <br> He'd be sceptical of it at first, but if he realizes all what Reina has done for him I believe he couldn't help but entertain the idea at least a little bit. You can't ignore such a big fucking elephant in the room after all. </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127302135 <br>Christ, what a trainwreck this has been.</br>  <br><br>Because Kyoani is clearly building up their reunion. I just hope there won't be any romantic hints.</br></br>  <br>No it doesn't Reina loves Taki. Only anime Kumiko is up in the air. But honestly I just see them baiting both het and yuri in the end. or have no romance and everything is about friendship. The anime isn't about romance at all, so why should they do something to ruin the music and band parts of it.</br>  <br>I'd disagree with that. there's probably more evidence for yuri, but not enough to confirm anything. I'd be happy with an end that doesn't mention any of it. <br><br>the only thing I really don't want is for Kumiko to suddenly realize she liked the shoe all along even though he has been the last thing on her mind</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127302135 <br> <br><br>Anywhere but here</br></br></br>  <br>There will be at least something. Maybe not like the novel, because neither of them talked at all to each other until the competition. And Shuuichi was the one that was Ignoring Kumiko not the other way around. <br><br>They'll probably alter it just like the scene where Shuuichi asked Kumiko to the Agata festival.</br></br></br>  Both sides will be claiming they've won after ep 13.<br><br> But the truth is we've all won by getting such an enjoyable anime. </br></br>  <br><br>I would enjoyed it more if it weren't' for the shipfaggotry intensified by the obnoxious and pointless yuri bait.</br></br>  <br>sasuga /a/</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127302633   <br> letting other people hamper your enjoyment of something </br>  <br>and on /a/ of all places</br>  <br>The chances are even lower in Hibike because one girl is confirmed straight. That's the whole definition of bait.</br>  <br>Imagine the twist if they set up a Kumiko -&gt; Reina -&gt; Taki love triangle for the second season, though.  Ignoring that it will never happen. </br>  <br>Same. Eupho had potential but fell flat after all the pointless bait.</br>  <br>I wouldn't have minded it if Kyoani made an anime original yuri romance.<br>But at this point it's beyond obvious that they're not going for that, which makes all the yuri scenes they add just look obnoxious, since they're just adding them to stir up controversy and get people to talk about their anime more.<br><br>It's pretty disappointing to see Kyoani stoop so low and resort to such tactics. The show could have been legitimately great on its own, now it will just be tainted with the legacy of being the "yuribait show".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember when Rin threw Haru against a fence and told him inches away from his face "you'll swim for me"? yeah. That was bait.</br>  <br>KyoAni isn't the greatest at originals, however. They're at their best when they find a story and seem places where they can improve upon it. <br><br>I can sort of understand that kind of talent.</br></br></br>  <br>He was being violent man. I don't call that romantic at all. Neither did I thought the cheek grab in ep 9 was anything but a friend encouraging the other. Reina was being gentle to Kumiko during ep 8 and 11 the eps with the most bait.</br>  <br> calling an aggressive confrontation bait <br>Dem tight goggles.</br></br>  <br>If you want to compare it to free, use the Makoto/Haru bait instead.</br>  <br> now it will just be tainted with the legacy of being the "yuribait show". <br>And that's 98% fault of the fanbase. I, and many others I'm sure, could have easily looked past the two more explicit instances of yuribait and enjoyed what were otherwise legitimately great scenes if it weren't for the endless shitstorms they caused here and which were apparently much worse for every other internet community (not as if I actually visit any of them). <br><br>And this isn't even about "letting other people hamper your enjoyment of something," I still think it's a great show, but I see so many people talking about how much the yuribait delegitimizes the show when it's only even amplified so much because the people who watch it are faggots, not the characters.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> legacy of being the "yuribait show". <br>You know, when I think about it, this might not actually be true.<br><br>Look at, for example, Cross Ange and Tamako Market (yes, you read that right). When these shows aired, there were a lot of yuri fans rooting for a yuri end. But when they ended, everyone started acting like Germans in 1946 and pretending they had nothing to do with anything. So once this show ends and bait turns out to be just bait, there's a pretty decent chance that everyone will just try to forget all about the yuri in this show and talk about non-yuri stuff when they discuss this anime in the future.<br><br>Well, there's probably going to be those 2-3 anti-yuri people who will shitpost about "/u/ BTFO", but there's just not that many of them to make a difference.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The equivalent to Kumiko x Reina bait would have been all the gay shit that happened in Australia and confirming either Haruka or Rin as straight (which corresponds with Reina loving Taki).</br>  <br><br> male Reina x Taki-sensei <br><br>What would their sex be like?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cross Ange.  <br><br>No one was actually rooting for that ya know?</br></br></br>  <br>Eupho is a lot more popular than either of those shows man in the west, its a little different.</br>  These threads are always so terrible and yet I keep coming back.<br><br>Why can I not escape this worst of the worst hells?</br></br>  <br>See? My point exactly. You'd be surprised if you looked back on those threads if you read them up on the archives.<br><br><br>It doesn't seem to be more popular on /a/, and /a/ is the only place that matters. Who cares about shitters on MAL and all the other sites?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Natsuki in swimsuit </br>  <br>You do it for her smile.</br>  <br>But what if both het and Yuri are baited in the last episode or, there is no bait on either side and its just friendship? The war is gonna keep going man.</br>      <br>Het was not bait in CA.<br>It was plot.</br></br>  <br>We know that Reina loves Taki-Sensei. <br>The only way for the yuri ship to keep sailing is to have Reina realize she doesn't love Taki-Sensei and loves Kumiko instead. <br>If that doesn't happen, all the yuri bait was just that, yuri bait.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean romantic friendship.</br>  Well right about that. But I still see it as a neutral ending.  <br>being</br>  <br>Very gay</br>  <br> implying it was bait and not subtext </br>  <br>I don't think many people know the difference between those two.</br>  <br>Same shit, KyoAni has no intention of making gay pairings canon so it's all bait in the end.</br>  <br>welcome back</br>  Why are there free fags in here? go back to /y/.  <br>I haven't watched Free myself, but it's shit like you who should leave.</br>  <br><br>Subtext is when you imply romantic involvement between two characters but never either confirm or deny it.<br>Bait is when you imply romantic involvement between two characters but then have one (or both) characters reveal they have other romantic interests.<br><br>I didn't watch Free, but I assume none of them have girlfriends or girls they like, so Free would be subtext.<br>Euphonium has Reina loving Taki-Sensei, which makes it bait.<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You could say the same about Hibike! since it's Reina's love for Taki why she's in Kitauji  and why she wants to be so special </br>  <br> Queerbaiting refers to what happens "when people in the media (usually television/movies) add homoerotic tension between two characters to attract more liberal and queer viewers with the indication of them not ever getting together for real in the show/book/movie". </br>  <br>That seems like a Western term not really applicable to Japanese entertainment.</br>  <br>this post gave me cancer holy shit</br>  <br> to attract more liberal and queer viewers <br><br>Queerbaiting does not exist in anime. Japanese entertainment adds yaoi/yuri subtext between characters because some of their viewers enjoy those types of relationships, not because they want to be seen as more progressive. And most of the viewers enjoy yuri/yaoi subtext because they either find it arousing/cute/etc., not because they support real life rights of those various groups.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm so glad nips are still somewhat sane.</br>  <br>Pretty much.</br>  I honestly don't get why the couldn't just cut down the yuribait, and gave more room for the friendship and Shuuichi. <br><br>They should of stopped it after ep 10.</br></br>  <br> I honestly don't get why the couldn't just cut down the yuribait, and gave more room for the friendship and Shuuichi.  <br>Maybe they didn't want to.<br><br> should of <br>It keeps happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One has zero chances of happening because of confirmed heterosexuality for at least one character, the other one will forever hang in the air.<br>If you want an example from the same show, Kumiko x Reina is bait while Natsuki x Ribbons is subtext.</br></br>  <br> confirmed heterosexuality <br>Sexuality isn't binary.</br></br>  <br> while Natsuki x Ribbons is subtext <br>Compared to Kumiko x Reina, they have almost nothing. Kaori x Haruka is subtext, too, if the bar is that low.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> I honestly don't get why the couldn't just cut down the yuribait, and gave more room for the friendship and Shuuichi. <br>But they did do that.<br><br>Episode 11 had a minute long yuribait scene, but all the other scenes between Kumiko and Reina in that episode showed them as friends only. The same thing with their episode 12 scenes - not even a hint of subtext. <br><br>They even had a perfect opportunity for the yuribait scene during the scene where Reina gave Kumiko a bottle of water while they were practicing - but that turned into friendly banter and one-upmanship - "if you become special, I'll become special even more". They could have easily changed this into "let's be special together". And don't forget how that episode ended - Reina freezing up and giving yandere vibes as soon as Kumiko mentioned being with the person Reina loves.<br><br>As for Shuichi, the plot about him struggling with playing from episode 11 is anime original, and so are his scenes with Kumiko in episode 12. In the novels, he makes no appearance at this point, so the anime is already giving him more room than he had in the novels at this point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> wanting to see the hibike's defiled for your het lust </br></br>  <br>Excellent response. I have truly butt heads with a professional.</br>  I bet Oboe-chan smells like cat litter.<br> Swheat scoop in particular </br>  <br>That Yuribait scene ruined the flow of their relationship honestly.</br>  <br> As for Shuichi, the plot about him struggling with playing from episode 11 is anime original, and so are his scenes with Kumiko in episode 12. In the novels, he makes no appearance at this point, so the anime is already giving him more room than he had in the novels at this point. <br>He certainly doesn't appear very much, but he does appear a little during this time in the novels. And I think the sexual tension between him and Kumiko in the scenes that he does appear in was higher than what we got these last two episodes. His increased presence notwithstanding.</br></br>  <br>Reina is Takisexual.</br>  <br>In anime it is.</br>  <br>If you put episode 8 scene in the context of non-romantic but intense attraction between two people (As you should in hindsight, after episode 10 confession.), episode 11 scene is the logical continuation and response to that scene.<br><br>Episode 11 scene is only romantic if you consider episode 8 scene to be romantic. And you shouldn't consider episode 8 scene romantic after episode 10.</br></br></br>  <br> In anime it is. <br>In anime, it's even less binary than it is in reality.</br></br>  <br> intense attraction. </br>  I'm pretty sure reinas love for taki-sensei is platonic and not romantic.  <br>if platonic means wanting to have his baby, then yes</br>  <br>I love the mental gymnastics some people do to convince themselves that Kyoani aren't purposefully baiting.</br>  <br>If KyoAni never does a second season, which would amp up Reina's Takisexuality people will assume Reina is bisexual.</br>  <br>Good job making it easier for me to ignore your opinions from now on because they are bullshit.</br>  <br>I'm not saying Kyoani isn't intentionally framing these scenes to look romantic (i.e. baiting), but they're doing it in such a way that you can easily understand that they're not meant to be taken literally as romantic scenes.</br>   the fluff is almost over <br><br>rip anime</br></br>  <br>It really is hilarious. How hard is it to admit that Kyoani is yuribaiting? It's pretty obvious that their scenes in episode 8 and 11 were written with the intent of making yurifags wet themselves.</br>  yes thats why shes shown zero interest in him regarding anything outside his music talent etc.<br><br>I guess kumiko wants to have euphobabies since she loves the instrument</br></br>  <br>I want to protect her choice in hairstyle.</br>  <br>Either her or Charlette.</br>  What are the chances of a second season?  <br>I'm not so sure about that. It's easy for us to say since we already know how things are supposed to turn out, but I'd imagine it would be a lot less clear for people who don't.<br>Confirmation bias is a powerful thing.</br></br>  <br>I suppose I could say the same to you. <br><br>Anime has the ability to play any side they want since very often they won't show the characters actually end up with anyone. <br>Not only that, but anime is full of characters that can be unrealistically eccentric, mentally queer, or emotionally damaged that they will attach themselves to anyone.<br>Anime also has the magical girl genre.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Much less than a movie</br>  <br><br>I find it surprising every time I still see people like these not knowing that KyoAni are the yurifags.</br></br>  <br> top: normal friends <br> bottom: confirmed couple <br>What's your point again?</br></br></br>  <br><br>There's plenty of fluff on the horizon.</br></br>  <br>Well, obviously. However, that doesn't change that they're almost certainly baiting. I suppose it is pre-emptive to call it bait - they could just have Kumiko and Shuichi reconcile<br>in a strictly platonic fashion, which would make it subtext instead - but so far they've been sticking pretty closely to the source material.</br></br>  <br>Kyoani has a future full of fluff and yuri bait</br>  For one, I'm sad that Hibike will end this week. On the other hand, I'm glad these threads discussing Hibike's characters' sexual orientations will end.  <br>That's true, but even the people who are only watching the anime and have never read any discussion about it or heard about the source material should be aware that something is "wrong" based on how Kumiko and Reina act outside of those scenes and how Reina confessed she loves Taki-Sensei.<br><br>There hasn't been a single scene since episode 8 where they have shown Kumiko or Reina to be even remotely nervous around each other. This alone should be a huge hint that they're not romantically involved.</br></br></br>  <br> ignoring Reina loving Taki <br>I find it funny how yurifags focus so much on Shuuichi when Taki is a much bigger "threat" for their shipping delusions.</br></br>  <br> Platonic friendship = subtext...ok </br>  I want to buy her a chocolate shake.  <br>Kumiko still acts slightly nervous. Hazuki even had to encourage her to ask Reina for lunch.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br> mfw the show ends and it turns out to be a split cour <br> and the next piece begins </br></br>  Any day now FFF.  <br>What was she listening to?</br>  <br>The people who are only watching the anime usually think that Kumiko and Reina are gay for each other.</br>  <br>I can't speak for the yurifags, but personally I find it difficult to take a teenager's crush on her teacher seriously. I doubt that's going to go anywhere.<br> Besides, Kumiko is the one who comes off as gay. Reina's just "special". <br><br><br>Might want to read that again. I'm saying that if Kumiko and Shuichi's relationship remains strictly platonic, then it would be more appropriate to call the yuribait scenes subtext.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can thank the original scenes they had before ep 8 for that. People thought Kumiko was gay because of the way she acted around Reina. To most people it was as if she had a crush on her.</br>  <br> You can thank the original scenes they had before ep 8 for that. <br>No, I'm pretty sure episode 8 specifically is when people went from "well this could be a bit gay" to "holy shit they're fucking gay".</br></br>  <br>With the way Kumiko acts towards him I feel it would be out of character for her to blush because of him in the final ep. The novel made it obvious that Kumiko was attracted to him.</br>  <br>The scenes before it helped though, you can't deny that.</br>  <br>For me it felt more like Kumiko was gay for Reina before episode 8, then after episode 8 things felt more like Reina was gay for Kumiko. I don't even remember the time when the former was dominant.</br>  <br>They did, but the bait was relatively light and people didn't take it all that seriously. After episode 8 yurifags got much louder and started seriously speculating about a yuri end.</br>  <br>Not exactly, there was a lot of talk about Kumiko being gay. Honestly she really did seem gay in the episode before ep 8.</br>  <br>Nope. It's still just bait because of Reina x Taki.</br>  <br> I doubt that's going to go anywhere. <br>It's not going to go anywhere, but how is that relevant in the first place?<br>She loves him, or at least believes she loves him. Which means she does not love Kumiko (romantically).<br><br>And even if we entertain the absurd possibility that she might be in love with both of them at the same time - compare her reactions to Taki-Sensei with her reactions to Kumiko.<br><br>Look at how she acts when Taki-Sensei is mentioned, in any context. She takes everything related to him very seriously. She freezes from shock and drops her water bottle when Kumiko says she was alone with Taki-Sensei. And that was Kumiko, a person she trusts and knows she has no interest in Taki-Sensei. It's obvious that she is clearly obsessed with him and has a massive crush on him. The way she acts around Kumiko pales in comparison.<br><br>Unless the next episode has a scene that clearly shows Reina getting over Taki-Sensei and/or realizing she loves Kumiko romantically, I don't see how you could possibly entertain the idea that Kumiko and Reina might ever be a couple.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The way she acts around Kumiko pales in comparison. <br>That's debatable.</br></br>  <br>Kumiko's never been put in a position where Reina needed to defend her, or needed to feel jealous over her like she has Taki-sensei.<br>Not recently, anyway.</br></br>  How can you people even discuss this for so long when it's going to have an open ending no matter what?  <br>It can't be an open ending unless they retcon this.</br>  <br> I don't see how you could possibly entertain the idea that Kumiko and Reina might ever be a couple. <br>I'm not, though. Like I said, Kumiko is the one who comes off as gay. Although I'm starting to realise that people might be confused<br>about what I'm even arguing for here. To be clear, the bait/subtext I'm referring to is that Kyoani is making it seem like Kumiko is<br>attracted to Reina. The reverse does not seem to be the case. Again, Reina is just "special" (i.e. melodramatic and with a severe lack of social skills)<br><br><br>Because of boredom, mostly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an open end unless she ends up together with Taki in the last episode.</br>  <br>Yeah, I understood what you meant to say, I was just responding to the common argument that it doesn't matter because they don't hook up.</br>  <br>Whether they end up together doesn't matter.<br>She sees him as her love interest.<br>That's all that matters.</br></br></br>  <br>People in japan even think she may be bisexual. There was even a comic about her love for Taki and Kumiko.</br>  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA<wbr>AAHHHHH!!!!!!!!</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br>They don't need to retcon anything. They can just make Reina grow out of her crush.</br>  <br> unreciprocated schoolgirl crush <br>Yeah, that sure means a lot.</br></br>    <br> Whether they end up together doesn't matter. <br> She sees him as her love interest. <br> That's all that matters. <br>I wish you were around for Hourou Musuko threads.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So what?<br>There are more MochizouxMidori doujinshi than there are TamakoxMidori doujinshi.<br><br><br>It certainly means more than bait.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's right though.</br>      <br>You too. <br>I wish you were around for them too.<br><br>Fuck it's like most people in these threads have never watched or read a legit romance series in their lives.</br></br></br></br>  <br> It certainly means more than bait. <br>"Bait" that has been steadily developed over the course of the entire show with several intimate and emotional scenes vs. a schoolgirl crush that's only been brought up twice and with zero actual interactions between Taki and Reina. It's not surprising people are more invested in the "bait" than what's supposed to be canon.</br></br>  <br>They didn't in the novels and it seems they've got no intentntions to do so in the anime</br>  <br><br>The point is that she thinks she loves him, and sees him as her love interest.<br><br>Unless something happens in the next episode to make her stop seeing him as her love interest, there is no reason to call it an open end. Because as it stands right now, in the show, Taki-Sensei is her only love interest.<br><br>You can write as much fan fiction as you want about how she eventually gets over him and falls in love with Kumiko, but that's just fan fiction. It's not substantiated by the show itself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to brush Reina's hair.  <br>please tell me this is fake</br>  <br>I really don't care at this point. So why are we even arguing. <br><br>Shit you guys take these stuff way too seriously.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the problem. You're only seeing it from the surface but in the source material Taki sensei is what makes most of Reina's character  and that will hopefully become evident in the future.  <br>The fact she wouldn't be in kitauji interacting with kumiko if it wasn't for him is more than enough for the viewer to understand her love is quite serious.</br></br>  <br>There is nothing wrong with preferring "bait" pairings over canon "pairing" (not really a pairing since they don't hook up).<br><br>But that's not the same as arguing that the anime has an open ending and that it's possible for Kumiko and Reina to end up together.</br></br></br>  <br>Kill urself/10</br>  <br>It's  not  fake.</br>  <br>IYOOOOOOOOOOOO</br>  <br>It seems to be their intention with the amine original scenes. And they're gonna be pushing for it in the s2</br>  <br>Last episode had an anime original scene that showed that Reina is still obsessed with Taki-Sensei.</br>  <br>Of course she had. When she and Natsuki went out~</br>  <br>What in the holy fuck makes you think that?</br>  <br>She also spends most of her time in school with Hazuki and Sapphire and not Reina. Reina hasn't shown any jealousy there. And if they're lesbians, wouldn't it make more sense for Reina to be jealous of girls and not boys?</br>  <br>Isn't she mostly comedy relief in the second novel. (aside from the Taki plot) Kumiko, Mizore and Nozomi are the one's with the main plot.</br>  <br>Are you being serious?</br>  <br>That's how far yurifags reach.</br>  Didn't Reina once stare at Shuuichi, who was staring at Kumiko?  <br> projecting your own stupidity on other people </br>  <br>I was under the impression that they were both looking at Kumiko and noticed one another.</br>  <br>That had to be awkward.</br>  <br>How is what I say false?</br>  <br>sauce?</br>  <br>She realizes there's someting between them.</br>  <br>I think they were just both looking at Kumiko, and Shuu noticed Reina in the midst of said act.</br>  <br>Reina is clearly look at shuu1</br>  <br>Man, whichever.</br>  anyone have that inception image of asuka holding a picture of herself that says best girl?

If you could what would you change about it?</br></br>  <br>Opal on the front page!</br>   I need to know the exact words Taki tells Reina when she confesses to him for real.     <br>What's the point of enjoying an anime if my ship doesn't sail?</br>  <br>bretty gud/10<br>but I'm gay so</br></br>  <br>The episode is flawless for a reason, anon. I don't think I'd change anything since every second is needed to make It amazing.</br>  <br> Not quite my tempo </br>  <br> AMV <br>Wait, these still exist?</br></br>  <br> will she ever fuck off <br> what is Asuka doing <br> why is natsuki so smug  <br> where is Asuka <br> I wish I could be with Asuka right now </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>W-what's this</br>  <br>Industrial espionage. Police are on their way to your adress.</br>  <br>Are you that pathetic twitter faggot who's feeling torn apart every waking minute by the thought KyoAni might not do an anime original yuri end?</br>  <br>No I'm not and this is the second time you ask this, anon. I think you are way too obsessed with some casual and you shouldn't, you know, it's bad for you.</br>  <br> I wouldn't have minded it if Kyoani made an anime original yuri romance. <br> But at this point it's beyond obvious that they're not going for that, which makes all the yuri scenes they add just look obnoxious, since they're just adding them to stir up controversy and get people to talk about their anime more. <br>That's my problem with it. I think Shuichi is fine and would be happy to see romance there, but I'd also be fine if they just went full bore on an original, well done yuri end too. I don't ship either one per se, it's just that whichever one they go for I want to see it well developed, fleshed out and without lazy "controversy" trolling or dumbshit "absolutely nothing gets resolved everyone can keep arguing forever."<br><br>What we've got right now is the Kyoani anime version of those fucking doujins that stick some total bait on the cover and have something utterly different for content. It's not that I'm opposed to the content one way or another. Some sweet vanilla loving or yuri can be great, but sometimes a gangbang is what the mood call for too. What I fucking hate is being bait &amp; switched about it. What's the fucking point? In this case, why even bother with baiting in either direction? The show is strong enough on its own anyway, it's not some cheap budget production, and it'd be a lot stronger if they weren't wasting time and resources being fuzzy.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br> says the one who's obsessed with a cartoon episode </br>  <br>It's the first time I asked this. It seems your obsessive behaviour in regards to that episode/scene just makes people suspect you.</br>  <br>Not the same anon but if you're seriously buttmad over one random person on twitter then, I don't know ignore them or something? This isn't very hard.</br>  <br><br>Can't you make only one reply only? Are you this mad with that guy?</br></br>  <br> two people have a smilar thought, must be a samefag <br>oh fuck off</br></br>  <br>One thing I really don't get about neo-4chan is the obsession with other shit sites/services. Tumblr, twitter, facebook, reddit, everyone knows/agrees they're full of garbage or at least not what we like. So, WHY GO THERE? I don't use twitter at all, I do not have a FB account at all either, I don't go visit tumblr, it's not hard. Why do people insist on going and hunting down what some retard said somewhere on the net and getting all outraged like it's anything special and then insisting on constantly bringing it up here. God damn.<br><br>I think a lot of the anons here are the mirror image of what they claim to dislike. They get off on being all outraged and reactionary every bit as much as some shitty SJW does.</br></br></br>  <br>nice blog ^^</br>  <br>Does it  trigger  you?</br>  <br> Twitter <br>That is fine for some things, like checking on official accounts of currently airing anime or the VAs/staff involved.
