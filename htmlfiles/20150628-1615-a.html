It was noted it was in Tsukihime, it was noted its in Kara, maybe even Fate, despite how it being mentioned the events/characters in Kara and Tsukihime are incompatible for reasons. Yet a certain priest and vampire are sometimes seen there.<br><br>Its a cafe of meetings that exists in all universes, its always the same place, people from any world line can enter and briefly meet people from other worlds without ever realizing that these people are from somewhere else.<br><br>So its inspired two different manga so far about this place, and one anime. A place that allows all TM stories to converge briefly. Maybe Zelretch is partially responsible for this existence of course, but of course its never taken that seriously.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino boat. <br><br>Shirou also works part time as Luvia's maid.</br></br></br>  <br>An entire episode of epilogue, what the hell are they going to do?<br><br>Oh, I see</br></br></br>  <br>No, that was Servant Archer. He just survived... somehow</br>  <br> best girl <br> getting a route <br>New to TM?</br></br></br>  <br> In addition, even if Emiya’s spiritual core sustained lethal damage, he can still survive for a short period. This ability is the reason why Emiya is able to secretly observe Shirou and gang’s battle as a spiritual body after being defeated by Shirou. In addition, after the battle between Shirou and Gilgamesh had concluded at Ryudo Temple, Emiya appeared in front of Gilgamesh as he attempted to pull Shirou into the darkness. He shot an arrow between the eyes of Gilgamesh and sent him alone into the darkness. The arrow shot at that time was a regular arrow, and from the fact that Emiya gradually began to disappear after this attack, this is probably the limit of Emiya’s materialisation. <br><br>Dunno why people think he was a CG there, a CG can only act after everyone has been killed basically. He just survived due to IA, and he was at the absolute limit of his mana at the end which is why he looked so fucked.</br></br></br>  <br><br>All Around Type Moon</br></br>  <br>Oh, yes, thanks.</br>  <br>Wait, what the fuck is this?

That collective mind up everyone went through when they realized the epilogue /started/ in London was amazing.  <br>mind fuck*</br>  <br>I was at work watching it from my phone and I literally blown the fuck out.<br><br>I couldn't believe we were actually getting that.</br></br></br>  Okay, so I can kind of understand it in Prisma or HA setting, but in this epilogue, where does Luvia get off hitting on someone else's boyfriend? She obviously knows they're shacking up yet flirts brazenly. Who does that?  <br>When did Rin become Karin from Monogatari?</br>  <br>A trollop, that's who.</br>  <br>Whores</br>  <br>There's an interview where Nasu says that Shirou's chances in all routes is infinitely close to zero. Anything else was just fanwank.</br>  <br> Who does that? <br>THE MOTHERFUCKING EDELFETS.</br></br>  <br>The Throne being outside of time doesn't actually mean changes to the hero would be done immediately. This is hinted at by the fact Archer isn't aware of every single one of his summons despite the information already existing there.</br>  <br>She's a slut</br>  <br>finns</br>  <br>I was in the thread on some Japanese forum, wasn't even watching the episode, refreshed the page, and Luvia was there with a bunch of freaking out. Blew my mind that we were actually getting London right there and then. Shame HF can't do something to top that scene for an epilogue.</br>  <br>It does confirm that he won't ever remember his summonings, as the answer is already written.<br><br>All of his summonings have happened, he compares it to a library full of books he has the choice of reading or not. The result is that even if the answer is there, he will not read it, since 99.999 percent of all books in the library are just him being summoned and killing everything which he gets tired of reading.<br><br>Its Archived Time, not Observed Time, time cannot move forward in a 1, 2, 3 type manner since all things are on the same scale. It's like a book, the end and beginning are on the same scale in terms of time per the reader.<br><br>If the Throne has not already replaced Archer, then it never did, since the end and beginning are on the same scale. Time cannot move forward or backwards, its the same from the start, everything has already been reached.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Reminder to everyone that Archer FALSE FLAGGED Nero and was the actual person responsible for burning down Rome.<br><br>Nero's fantasies were becoming too dangerous and overwriting reality that Archer was sent to burn down Rome and have the blame put on Nero.</br></br></br>  <br> Rome is burning before Acha appears <br>You can't trick me, Whore of Babylon.</br></br>  <br>Aniplex fucked up with the subs but Shirou works part time as Luvia's maid.<br><br>Also, Shirou goes on vampire hunting dates with Luvia on a casino riverboat owned by a DAA.</br></br></br>  <br>Summer?</br>  <br> Only summoned to prevent apocalypse-level events <br> Kills a bunch of ragheads with AKs <br><br>What</br></br></br></br>  <br>How could Archer do such a thing. Why must Alaya stomp on best girl.<br><br><br>Obviously it was a multi guardian conspiracy</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Archer isn't teleporting to various places around Rome to commit arson. </br>  <br>Maybe they were setting off a nuclear bomb somewhere that would start World War 11</br>  <br>finnish girls are disgusting...i got stuck in helsinki for 2 days and nearly every woman i saw was either fat or ugly, but usually both<br><br>it's no wonder why the men are constantly drunk, they have to fuck those beasts</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that Mooncell copies of Heroic Spirits are exactly the same as the ones in the Throne right? Yet Archer in Extra is aware of the events that occur in F/SN despite his "younger" self being hopelessly unaware. Only confirmed difference is that Mooncell Archer is not bound to the Counterforce which is why he's less of a jackass.</br>  <br>cuckold brittistani?</br>  <br>Neither of those things make it okay to hit on someone else's boyfriend, much less in front of them. I'll have to agree that it's because of  slut </br>  <br>Mooncell updates heroic spirits info based on shit that's happened on Earth.<br><br>The fifth war happened on Earth, it was recorded, info was updated on Archer. You're arguing that all servants retain information based on previous summonings, which is wrong.<br><br>Cu also remembered Archer from the fifth war in Extra, he's not a guardian.</br></br></br></br></br>  Luvia's anus is probably blander than Rin's.  <br>what would yous search for in the archive for the live threads in the subject line or post?</br>  <br>Luvia probably bleaches her anus. Rin probably has hair on hers.</br>  <br>Nope. <br> Yes, that's right. To be more precise, they are perfectly reproduced from the Moon Cell's records of human history. However, that human history is connected to the throne of heroes in multiple ways, so they can't be called copies as a rule. In short, the Moon Cell consciously creates its own history of humanity, but that history is the exact same as the throne of heroes, so it's like they overlap in multiple ways as the same existences. <br>Mooncell copies = Throne copies.</br></br></br>  http://www.fate-sn.com/bdbox/<br><br>Drama CD for the BDs is gonna be about the Clock Tower.<br><br>Also it seems like they're setting things straight somewhat with the amount of extra animation. They're pinning it at a little over 10 minutes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look for the thread with 900+ posts.</br>  <br>Just so you know Archer always talks about himself in 3rd person before he became guardian.</br>  <br>My hair is naturally curly to the point it forms drills, its possible anon, if your genes allow it.</br>  <br> bleached anus <br> spending obscene amounts of money to look like a whore  <br>Sasuga Luvia.</br></br></br>  <br> Supposed to be summoned as part of the CG to stop humanity ending catastrophes <br> Always summoned to kill random sand niggers, small-time militias, and children who couldn't possibly do anything big <br><br>Bravo ufotable, Bravo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, that's just Aniplex fucking up. They made the same mistake in episode 20 and UTW had to fix it.</br>  <br>you never know man, butterfly effect and so</br>  <br> Rin probably has hair on hers <br>That's a good thing. The hair traps the feces, dirtying her anus to the point where you can taste Shirou's cooking in it.</br></br>  <br>I just find it hard to believe, is all. Was hoping he'd deal with more interesting disasters like the manga portrayed (participating in wars and large scale conflicts) instead of killing sand niggers for a living.</br>  <br>never read the manga, who does he kill in that, mecha hitler?</br>  <br/>  Why is Rin so jealous Luvia? She has tons of things that Luvia doesnt have like her uh ZR yeah that works that's something Luvia definitely doesnt have.  Hopefully, this episode will inspire someone to finally write the Rin/Luvia hatesex doujin everyone wants.  <br>No idea. But we see some flashbacks of him in the middle of a warzone screaming like a madman with dead bodies all around him.</br>  <br>I dont know what are you talking about. Archer clearly says shounen wa shounen ga.<br>Translation is correct. He talks about ubw Emiya and himself when he was alive at the same time. And he got his answer.</br></br>  <br>Luvia is rich as fuck, has a body that makes Rin realize she was always just a big fish in a small pond who was less than she realized, has as much ability as Rin but even more going on outside of that.<br><br>She's someone that makes even school idol Rin feel a little self conscious.<br><br>Although you might say the same about Saber.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luvia has money. Rin doesn't.</br>  <br>And she has a route</br>  I just cant believe we got a satisfactory pretty good end with some fan service.  Luvia is Blue<br>a Red's natural rival</br>  <br>do you have big tits and childbearing hips too?</br>  <br> And she gets plowed by dirty ginger and is impure, while Luvia is always pure and prime <br><br>Wow, real accomplishment</br></br></br>  <br>She's not jealous? She's just annoyed Luvia keeps trying to make moves on her sentient sword.</br>  <br>The Counter Force acts through subtle means usually by empowering and leading a living person to neutralize the thread. Counter Guardians are only send when the situation is already beyond fucked and they will literally kill anything in the vicinity.<br><br>Maybe they send more than one guardian and Archer just got stuck with cleaning out the place?</br></br></br>  <br>Even in the routes where Luvia never meets Shirou, Rin still gets jealous and goes after her just the same.<br><br>Saying Shirou is the core of this problem is stupid.</br></br></br>  <br>Luvia constantly lusts after the Shero dick, but she'll never get it, not even in Prisma.</br>  <br>There's probably more than one CG, yeah.<br><br>Still kind of weird how all we saw were Archer dealing with small-fry. I'd be pretty bored even if I was looking forward to all the killing.</br></br></br>  <br>Luvia's not even good enough for the ginger, she tries to get his attention but can't even do that</br>  Ara  <br>It's a multiverse.<br><br>There's guaranteed to be an infinite number of possibilities where Luvia wins  or NTRs Rin .</br></br></br>  <br>I was talking about that particular scene with Rin clearly trying to get Luvia the fuck off Shirou.</br>  <br>She'll always be pure and noble, while Rin is gaping and dirty anus. An unreachable but always pure Aristocrat, while Rin is a gorilla that can be talked into sex in less than two weeks.<br><br>As said before, Luvia never meets Shirou in Fate or HF, so its definitely not constantly anything. <br><br> He denied "putting others before himself", however that was obviously self-deception. His goal was to be a house-husband. <br> However, his butler-spirit had already awakened. After the True End of Rin route, he was working part-time at the mansion of Rin's rival. What the heck is this? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Saber is also blue.<br><br>The natural conclusion is for blue three-way to occur as red is left out in the cold.</br></br></br></br>  Did Shirou ever realise avalon is inside him?  <br>Infinite universes don't mean everything can happen<br><br>Kotomine will never survive past the 5th war<br>Luvia will never win shirou</br></br></br></br>  <br>Going off that mindset there's also an infinite number of possibilities where Rin has Luvia watch her in the middle of baby-making, or more importantly,  they turn full-on bi and have the Clocktower's wildest threesome .</br>  <br>In Fate he does</br>  <br>Luvia saw Shirou try to jump just like Rin and Sakura. and we all know bitches love the jump</br>  <br>Rin shouldn't talk with cock in her mouth</br>  <br>He might have, but it doesn't really matter in UBW or HF.</br>  <br>People seem to not get despite it being said by Nasu a few times, at their core Sakura and Rin are almost entirely the same. Main difference is one is unlucky and the other is lucky.<br><br> Basically, she is a worrisome girl that never resents others (not even Shinji or Zouken), and always blames herself for everything. <br> The solitary exception to this rule is Rin, because the two of them are so similar. I guess she's only capable of being honest with herself, or someone almost exactly like herself, yeah. <br> As everybody knows, she seems passive, but when she does do something she devotes herself to it completely. <br><br>Rin and Sakura are entirely in sync when they try to kick Bazett out of the house in Ataraxia when they perceive her as a threat.<br><br>They're both the jealous type underneath it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry anon, I only have my drills.</br>  <br> Infinite universes don't mean everything can happen <br>Is that you, Ken Levine?</br></br>  <br>wot</br>  <br>Wrong, Aniplex fucked up the script once again.

Being weak physically is ok, but being a coward is a big no in my book, non battle manga included.</br></br></br></br>   face covered in shadow with glowing eyes <br>Hellsing was the fucking best for this.</br>  <br>I love it when the OP/ED changes slightly to go with what happens in the show.<br><br>Examples include JJBA where Dio ZA WARUDOs in the OP.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kEE<wbr>EyaqNCR4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Plastic Memories also had a bit in the OP which I came to absolutely love <br><br>It can even be something small like characters not appearing in the OP/ED until after they are introduced in the show.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Episode starts with a completely new unrelated side character <br> Protagonist shows up later in the episode <br>This was probably my favorite thing about Monster.</br></br></br>  <br>Every show made by Obari</br>  lolis portrayed in a very god/jesus like or saintly manner/position.

You can still see them moving clearly, but it's fast as a fucking insect<br><br>1.) The camera pans out to a wide view of the landscape and the character just blitzes out of the camera's view in either direction<br><br>2.) Several after-images of the character rush at the screen before their actual body is gone<br><br>3.) Speeding blur across the screen, delay for several seconds, huge-ass sonic boom wrecking everything</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>On the other hand, I like powers that seem weak and useless, but when used in convoluted and clever ways turn out to be really good.<br><br>Although I don't know if there's any anime like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>blah blah blah something index</br></br>  <br> anything about that series <br> clever <br>I mean yeah, the potential is there, but the author isn't clever enough to make it even remotely interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>true</br>  <br><br> Law of Ueki and everything from that author, including his current work.<br>Many, and mean A LOT, of Jojo characters, specially in Vento Auro.<br><br>And a shit ton more that I can't remember not bother to look up for you, but there is Tag called "seemingly useless power" on baka so yeah, that's more or less common.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 5 and 6 had the best fights.

Not wanting to cum inside Momo-chan and all.</br>  <br>Why does it matter? Ene is nothing like Takane.</br>  That show was such a shit that if a shit took a shit and then a cow ate that shit and then parasites infested that shit and ate it and then shit out more shit, it would still be better then Mekaku City Actors.  <br>Well why'd you watch it then?</br>  <br>They both don't love my self-insert and that makes me angry.

That was just criminal.</br></br></br>  <br>They were never their own persons in the first place. Besides, happiness has no value.</br>  <br>All the Konoha/Ene art doesn't really make sense to me anymore, now that it was revealed Konoha was a separate entity from Haruka.</br>  <br>I wouldn't really call any character "important". <br><br><br> didn't get a cover <br>But he got one in the anime OST.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He did, but it's still disappointing how it wasn't in the show itself.</br>  <br>Konoha is no more a separate entity from Haruka than Ene is a separate entity from Takane.<br><br>One deprived of his memories, the other deprived of her body, they were both drastically different than their whole forms. Konoha's personality is the same as Haruka's, but Ene's is not the same as Takane's, whose to say which one is closer to the original?</br></br></br>  <br>Ene is Takane and vice versa, her cheerful "bully Shintarou" persona just gradually stopped being an act over time.<br><br>Konoha is Haruka's snake.

In anime, servants always want to fuck their master and little sisters always want to fuck their brother.</br>  God this anime was shit.  <br>But this Anime was made for fujoshi and normalfags, so such standards don't apply here.</br>  <br>Then why does it have such best girls?</br>  <br> fujoshits like Seto/Shintarou better than Shintarou/Konoha, a homo pairing actually backed up in the series </br>  Manga, readable but shit plot still readable <br>Anime, shit plot shit shit but can handle watching all episodes<br><br>Conclusion: Just fucking listen to the music, anything else is worse</br></br></br>  <br>They're shit for a reason.</br>  <br>The most recent LN was pretty much nothing but Shintaro/Haruka being really gay with each other, too.

Also ene when? I want a desktop meido to critique my shitposting.  <br>But are there any girls who pander to my yuri goggles?</br>  <br>Momo?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>I don't know why every thread about this show is so negative. I saw the anime only, and didn't care about the music or LN, so if thats the only reason why I liked it then I'm okay with that. They really did rush the plot towards the end and included lots of stuff that never seemed to go anywhere. I guess thats what you get when you walk the line with trying to adapt something and trying to please the fans at the same time.</br>  <br> we will never get doujins where Momo and Hiyori do lewd things together while Hibiya is forced to watch <br> we will never get doujins of Momo teaching Mary lewd things </br></br>  <br> Hibiya is forced to watch <br> forced </br></br>  <br> we will never get doujins <br>Well, I guess there are a few, but they're all non-H and don't get scanned anyways.</br></br>  <br>It's kind of NTR.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>But it's hot.</br>  <br>I was going to make some lewd writing but never worked up the motivation.</br>  Which group is the best?<br><br>Orphan Trio<br>Highschool Quartet<br>Medusa Family <br>Momo and little kids</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Momo and the kids aren't really a thing.</br>  <br>The NEET duo.</br>  Shintarou has Ayano<br>Kido has Kano<br>Seto has Mary<br>Takane has Haruka<br>Hibiya has Hiyori<br><br>What about Momo?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kido has Kano <br>Doesn't really seem like a thing to me.<br> Hibiya has Hiyori <br>Hiyori has never shown interest.</br></br></br></br>  <br> deletes my files <br>I'd wipe every device I own. That bitch has it coming.</br></br>  <br> She just comes back whenever Shintarou deletes her. </br>  <br>I'm talking industrial strength electromagnets.</br>  <br>She comes back from the internet, so you just need to disconnect your PC from the internet.</br>  <br>What the fuck can you do on your computer if you don't have internet?

I wonder how many times they did it before Not-Manami and the QT class pres caught them in the act? Do you think they continued afterwards? Give how Sora was all "Look at me, Haru. Only ever look at me", i think he would have had to fight her off. </br>  <br> I've been on the same 2 pairs for almost 8 years now. </br>  <br> If nothing else, at least it means your vision isn't getting worse. </br>  <br><br>Thread almost ruined. Only way it could possibly get worse is if Dutch showed up.</br></br>  Why aren't you holding her /a/?  I can't bone her through dat suit. It's a no deal.  Because she doesn't want to. Did you ever watch the damn cartoon? I guess OP only remember his headcanon  <br><br>He can't cross that tape because dat bitch quarantined. She fucking batshit crazy. Cut yo dick off. Real talk.</br></br>  Why aren't you holding him /a/?  <br>Cause she's a cunt and I never understood how people liked her.</br>   43 years later and people still don't talk about holding Rei <br>Why? What did she do to deserve this? It must be bad taste, that's what - people to stupid to realize the objective truth that Rei Ayanami is the best girl!</br>  <br>too busy laughing at her</br>  <br>For the same reason girls like hot assholes. Also, Asukafags only care about their headcanons where Asuka is a damaged tsundere waiting for a geek charming to save her with a hug while Shinji is their bland self-insert<br><br>No wonder why they like Re-Take so much</br></br></br>  Seriously though, if you STILL think this show is about some kind of relationshippy shit, you might be actually gay  <br>  Asuka is a damaged tsundere <br>That part's right, though.</br></br>  <br> Moot is a confirmed cuckold <br> Moot waifu is asuka <br> That means her cunt is flappy and full of crusty mandingo cum <br>You guess</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holding her by the neck counts, right?</br>  <br>If you don't think this show is about relationships, you might be retarded. It's not about romance or muh true love or anything, but it's definitely about relationships.</br>  <br>It's literally about MC finding love and acceptance. There is no other message, none.</br>  <br> &gt;Moot waifu is asuka <br>Wait, are you serious? THAT'S AMAZING :D</br></br>  <br>I don't like Asuka as a person but she's not your seasonal tsundere</br>  <br>No, they just aren't ironic enough.</br>  I'd rather give Shinji a hug.  <br>Maybe first half Shinji would be OK with that. Post-Bardiel Shinji not so much, unless you're an androgynous gay angel</br>  <br>Post-Bardiel Shinji probably would have been fine with anyone at that point. Just see how desperately he reaches out to Asuka, Misato, and Rei.</br>  <br>Kinda funny both Re-Take and Rebuild turned Eva into a muh true love bullshit, putting the writer's OTP in the center of the entire universe. Obviously, the Asukafags fucking love Re-Take while the fujos fucking love Rebuild</br>  Too busy holding Misato while doing the nasty.  Becuase moot is.  <br>you know the word tsundere literally didn't exist before evangelion, dumb eop faggot</br>  <br>To be fair, Shinji was anxious of human contact but also fucking scare and not so trusting on the people he opened during the last months. Maybe someone new would work, someone who wasnt' an androgynous gay angel with a secret agenda of destroying mankind</br>  I'm too busy holding my dick anon.  Oh my god it's funnier EVERY SINGLE TIME I see it  <br>Anyway I'm pretty sure she just got teleported into Game of Thrones or something like that, it can't have been that bad</br>  <br> fapping to a guy fapping <br> no comma preceding "anon" <br> OQF1Xm3.gif - actual imgur filename <br>Pathetic.</br></br></br></br>  Also, there is a metric fuckton of clones of her around here, and it's a lot of work to make sure we're never anywhere near each other, since they would kill me on the spot  <br>As always, would If I actually could, granted there'd be a time and place for that.<br><br><br><br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>(not out of malice or whatever, but just for safety reasons. the 2nd floor here is instant death for trespassers, and I'm not actually authorized to go there with the keys I have)</br>  <br> abusing caps even ironically </br>  <br>She is inside a giant ass robot-mutant-god thingy.</br>  <br>No, she's just dead, pretty much as you would expect</br>  <br>I guess the basic problem is that 2 is an even number, so there's simply no way to make it out of there alive, at all. Better just not to go in the first place.</br>  I mean if you already went there like I did, at that point your only hope is to just hide and hope the situation resolves itself somehow. So far it's been working for me, but who knows what will happen next :(  And no, this isn't some historical allegory or something, this is just some stupid jewish thing. I'm LITERALLY hiding in my room PRECISELY for this reason (i.e. I don't want to be vaporized, torn to shreds, spontaneously combusted, irradiated, poisoned, teleported, etc etc)<br><br>Like I said, it really fucking sucks around here</br></br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck?</br></br></br>  <br><br>/fringe/ please go.</br></br>  <br><br>you've been watching this show and you don't even know the kabbalah shit it's based on? come on guy, do you have any idea how dangerous this stuff is?</br></br>  <br>He recovered after Bardiel, though. He was melted for a month and he was somehow completely okay for as long as Asuka and Rei were.</br>  <br>Who do you think I am, Tony Danza?</br>  <br>What you are saying makes no sense in the context. It's only tangentially related to Eva/ the fucking thread.</br>  <br>Why did you think I made a joke about that board if I didn't know about the Kabbalah you semite fuck? Go fuck some golems and RP on /x/ or something.</br>  <br>uh, I do believe you are quite mistaken about that.<br><br>anyway, the point is, I'm not authorized to go on the 2nd floor, but I have keys to a room on the 15th floor so I can come and go as I please so long as I don't do anything too dangerous. the whole problem here is that people have been dicking around without reading the fucking rules. I don't know the rules either, but at least I'm not fucking trespassing</br></br></br>  <br>fuck off, I'm not roleplaying anything with any of you. you think you can trick me with something like that? bitch, please</br>   She had been lost for days and wandered into the ruins of the city <br> Just sat in that baththub for hours wallowing in despair <br> She probably shat and pissed herself without even noticing in her deranged state, I don't even know where people got she tried to kill herself  </br></br>  <br>What the fuck did you say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated at the top of my cult with over 300 confirmed summons. I even consulted the Akashic records and jumped across the many planes of the esoteric via astral projection.<br><br>Come back when you're done reading Promehetus Rising, kid. Tch.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyway, I'm only posting here to help people figure out how to get these stupid fuckers out of this city before they destroy everything</br>  <br>I mean, when you get to a point where it's 100% clear that they can easily cut your elevator cables with a laser from space at any time, you know you're in a fucking huge amount of trouble</br>  That's not to even bring up the fact that there are tons of people with guns and knives INSIDE the building here.<br><br>sdglkodshgl;dgkjhls;dghkslo'g;jsdg</br></br>  So, why do I think Seattle is the worst city ever? Let me count the reasons................  What happened to Mo-tan to become so tiny? Did she only manage to reincarnate partially?<br><br>Is she not part of the zodiac anymore then?</br></br>  <br>Why the fuck would she be traveling around the world with Nya-tan in the first place, doesn't she have the whole Tokai region to protect?<br><br> inb4 it turns out there WAS somebody that missed Rat's radar and won all the Eto-seals in the last moment to become an Eto-shin. <br><br> Hooray Paca-tan </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Her soul got ripped out and shattered. Give her SOME time to heal<br><br><br><br>she's on sick leave <br><br>what I want to know is Pretty Mode tiny in general or is Mo-tan just like that because of the aforementioned soul ripping</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rabbit? More like RabBest.  <br>Well there's the manga.  Which deviates so much from the anime that it is practically a different story just with characters that look the same <br><br><br>You're early today</br></br></br></br>  I, for one, welcome our new CG overlord.  <br><br>well that is smaller but hardly pocket sized</br></br>  <br>Nya-tan is travelling the world to find a cure to restore mo-tan's body.<br><br>Mo-tan is too weak to protect a region and just tags along with Nya-tan.<br><br> season 2 never indeed </br></br></br></br></br>  Boar is best  Reminder that Meitan was confirmed best girl last thread.   <br>Mission accomplished</br>  <br><br>I feel sad for you Sheepfags since she gets BTFO in manga</br></br>  So, uh, did they explain what the deal is with Takeru? Did I miss something?  <br>What was wrong with him?</br>  <br>He was just a small town boy</br>  <br>I'm still wondering how he's able to barf out Sol/Lull like it's no big deal.</br>  <br><br>does anyone else feel like the ending was a tease for second season/OVA where they will have 3D segments with more realistic body proportions just like in OPs pick?<br><br>it felt like that to me.<br><br> muh sales! <br><br>there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>List a few  because I would like to believe </br>  <br> there are plenty of low-sales shows that get second seasons or OVAs <br>Because they are for promoting the source material. If the publishers think an anime increased the sales of manga, VNs, or merchandise, even if the anime itself sold badly, they will consider it a success.<br><br>Etotama was just a commercial disaster.</br></br></br></br>  Now my ears can rest in peace and heal from Nya's voice.  <br> Etotama was just a commercial disaster. <br>Exactly. And it makes me fucking happy.</br></br>  <br>You could marinate a whole cow with such saltiness  not that it would be difficult now that Mo-tan has become chibi </br>  <br>Living in a lonely world?</br>  <br>Why chuu-tan looks so HIGH.</br>  <br>Because Murakawa subconsciously hates Rat  or her VA  deep inside</br>  <br><br>Not anymore, he has a floor boar, a monkey and a dog on his roof, a horse and a sheep taking care of his home, a tiger and a dragon keeping him company, a rooster waking him up in the morning, a snake cooking for him, a cat with a cow, and a rabbit occassionally visiting him, and now he also acquired a sexy loveable rat who hangs around him to relax.<br>Must be awesome having such great Soul/Lull.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Shitty drawings being showcased in anime is my biggest hnnnngggggghhhh</br></br>  Well that was cute.  <br>What does her VA have to do with it?</br>  damn, that was a totally worthless final for a worthless series  <br>That was a joke.

A bevy of beautiful girls all living in around and with a single hapless guy. Even if most arent romantically interested, they interact with him in friendly ways, so to me it is still what I consider a Harem... I usually think of it as a viewer harem show.. or like a supporting cast harem?</br>  <br>Holy shit. <br><br>Mei-tan pls go and stay go</br></br></br>  <br>Mei-tan is lovely. How do I get a yandere sheep to obsess over me?</br>  <br><br>Mei-tan confirmed for sleeper best girl<br><br>Why the writers made a fucking episode about Takeru's cold and not this is beyond me.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Sheep is scary.</br></br>  <br>Because they needed to provide a reason why an Eto-shin fell in love with a mortal, unless you want a slutty Sheep who falls in love at first sight with someone just because he looks good.<br><br>Also &gt;pic related</br></br></br>  <br><br> Mei-Tan <br> A healing specialist who delivers every possible therapeutic treatment. <br><br>I didn't realize death was a part of the treatment</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That ass.</br>  <br>this took longer than it normally does<br>are you tired or something</br></br>  <br>Death cures everything.</br>  <br>You fuckers told me I was retarded for even suggesting that she could be a closet yandere.<br><br>Fuck every last one of you.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Laid-back, easy-going, and soothing personality. <br><br>I'll never trust again</br></br></br></br>  I couldn't handle the lack of anime so I started watching the niconico talk show.<br><br>Jesus Christ, does Nya-tan's VA have sugar water flowing through her veins?</br></br>  <br>Who stole Uma-tan's nose?</br>   Finish show <br> Take nap <br> OP stuck in my head <br>It can't be helped.<br><br>This OP (and show in general) really grew on me.

That was just one post in a normal thread.<br><br>But there's this right underneath that post.</br></br></br>  It's a shame this did so poorly.<br>I guess the idea was that with a cast of 13 waifus the show couldn't possibly do poorly, but it did anyway.</br>  <br>Stop making everything sadder, the BD sales alone is bad enough.<br><br>I wonder why they're so afraid of Mei-tan just because she have the key. It's not like she couldn't just climb the wall and enter through the backyard's door.</br></br></br>  <br>Or you know that hole in his house that connects the two realms together.</br>  Is that the character designer who did Monogatari?<br><br>And why does the 3D look so amazing?</br></br>  <br> Stop making everything sadder <br>Think about all the effort put into making the CG models, and animating them.<br><br>Now think about how all these data are going to be stashed into some storage, never to be used again, and eventually deleted.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or that.

Or Dragon. </br></br></br>  <br>Would it be a crime?</br>  <br>Satan, stop asking questions you know the answers to</br>  <br>Satan, please.</br>  <br>Aye, seeing Uri-tan going Uri Uri Uri or Inu-tan going Wan Wan Wan would be the cutest. Nya-tan already say Nya so much that it wouldn't be any different than normal.<br><br>Just asking, I want to commit a crime on a messenger of god aswell.</br></br></br>  <br><br>what does tiger say? Gao? Is that more lions? Does that apply to other large jungle cats? Japanese onomatopoeia are absurd sometimes</br></br>  <br>Did she just nonchalantly insert a "DAISUKI" in the middle of a sentence?</br>  <br>My thumbs, her ass cheeks.<br>My tongoue, her anus.<br>Her feces, my throat.</br></br></br>  <br><br>did you not?</br></br>  <br> Inu-tan going Wan Wan <br>Didn't dogs go 'Inu Inu'?</br></br>  <br>No, she just said daisuki na more quietly.</br>  <br>Taiga make that noise that so yeah, It's probably Gao.<br><br>Inu-tan stop, you're doing it wrong. Wan wan are more adorable.</br></br></br>  dess dess~     everyone talking about the Mei-tan short <br>Personally I want to know what Shaa and Chuu were talking about and whether all the service shots had something to do with that</br>    <br>Man, mootykins has a H-doujin rod in there</br>  <br><br><br>Goddamn i love cock</br></br></br>  <br><br>yum</br></br>  <br>Best Etotama. Would be husband of to support her and our offspring.</br>  I want a game.  <br> Etotama version of No More Heroes <br>My dick.<br><br>Also, for whatever reason, the last couple of episodes of Etotama reminded me of Asura's Wrath. Probably because<br> Buddhism </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me to check the website.<br><br>Sure enough:</br></br></br>      <br> Nya tan likes to be picked uped unlike the other two that is midly annoyed. <br><br>Why is Nyatan such a slut.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Mei-tan is so best jesus fucking christ</br></br>  <br><br>She'll probably the one to take Takeru's virginity, unless Snake slithers in first.</br></br>  <br>She's a Soll/Lull slut.<br><br>She would do anything to suck the magic out of you.</br></br></br>  <br>Am I the only one bothered how the Etotama's only gueard Japan? Aren't they a chinese concept?</br>  <br><br>The japanese took over the concept from China, but these are specifically japanese. Otherwise Sheep would be Goat and Boar would be Pig.</br></br>  <br> it's possible and most likely I'll never hear Megumi ever again </br>  <br>But Sheep is GOAT.</br>    <br>It's a different breed. Sheep has actual fur that you can sheer to sell. Goat are from the hotter climates and are only good for milk and meat.</br>    <br> ??????? <br><br>They're in correct zodiac order, with card ranks going up matching sequence of years.</br></br></br>  <br><br> We never even got to see any of the Etos conversing with their animals, I want to see Nya-tan talking with that cat popping up in a few episodes. <br><br>Poor Dora-tan, doesn't actually have any existing animal counterparts to talk to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What part of the explanation do you not understand yah dumb cat?</br>  <br> she didn't change color scheme after every death <br>What a waste.</br></br>  <br>Who knows, maybe there's plenty of dragons flying around in the other dimension where she came from.</br>  Is there anything western fans can do to help encourage the staff, like send them postcards? There have been a few instances of shows where a translator anon showed up to help direct where to address cards and messages to, and such.  <br><br>We tried to work on that.</br></br>  <br>T I C K E T S<br>I<br>C<br>K<br>E<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GOAT is a dumb acronym.<br>Just let me make my shitty jokes in peace.</br></br>  <br>Hey I want to do that too! But where could we send the postcards? Shirogumi's building?</br>  <br>Oh... my apologies crying neko. My humor sensors are broken. But if it's any consolation to you I chuckled moderately after you explained it.</br>  <br>Buy the discs.</br>  <br>If there one thing i learn from Muromi-san, don't trust dolphins</br>  <br>Send both postcards and a receipt of you buying the BDs.</br>  <br>Ok, can someone give easy step-by-step directions on how to do an international purchase of discs?<br><br>In my case it would be DVDs, I never really found BDs to be all that exciting.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't DVD's maximal resolution something like 576p?</br>  <br>Just go on Amazon JP and buy them.<br>Other amazon accounts don't work, so you'll have to make a new one.</br></br>  <br><br>I wanna send them a postcard with a drawing</br></br>  <br>576p looks glorious on a CRT television.</br>  If you don't want to spend so much money you could always buy something cheaper: http://etotama.com/goods/  http://www.shirogumi.com/contact/  <br><br>http://etotama.com/goods/death_deat<wbr>h_t-shirts.html<br><br>Wait the death death shirt is a legit shirt?<br>I thought it was just something some anon stitched together.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Yup, it's real. You can order it on AmiAmi.</br>  Browsing through AmiAmi now. "Pass Case" is some kind of protective sleeve for a transit card or something? <br><br>Doesn't look like a standard creditcard form-factor.</br></br>  <br>Maybe is to store socks?<br><br>too bad my tablet broke yesterday</br></br></br>  <br>I'm thinking all those 'passes' people hand around their necks in conventions or events</br>  <br> Goddamn i love cock <br><br>Anon in a nutshell.</br></br></br>  <br>I would suck cock all day every day, from the top to the two extremities on the bottom!</br>  <br>Isn't it those train passes characters always swipe in anime?</br>  <br>It is the  ni  word.</br>  <br>Ni!</br>  <br> We'll never understand how furryshit had better sales than this. <br><br>SBR was backed by Sanrio and animated by Bones, I'm sure they had far superior promotion and placement. <br><br>In comparison, Etotama pretty much came out of nowhere. They did damn well considering the circumstances.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They did damn well considering the circumstances. <br><br>I wouldn't call 'literally worse sales than Kill Me Baby' a job well done.</br></br></br>  <br>Did SB69 have shit sales? That's probably of less concern than it should be considering the show also has the mobage to rake in money.</br>  <br>I'm talking about Etotama you idiot, read  again</br>    <br> Rabbit has only one leg </br>  <br>This actually reminds me of the time when me and my father found the remains of a dead wild boar behind my house. Apparently some guy caught one and butchered it the day before. He only left the head and some entrails. I can still smell the remains on my dog to this day.</br>  <br>Oh yes</br>  <br>That's what you get, for playing with sharks.</br>  Uri-tan is best cute  <br> Uri-tan is best cute <br><br>Why doesn’t anyone her horns?</br></br></br>  <br>Those are supposed to be tusks though.</br>  <br>There are clearly two there, just close together.</br>  Can you remember the whole name of the Tenchou Cup?  Dog and Monkey can be kawaii. They needed their own episode(s)  <br>So much love in just a few seconds.</br>  <br>golden part is a horn</br>  <br>you mean her ears, right?</br>  Anyone have a link to the Etotama music video that was posted a few weeks back, with all the characters dancing in Pretty Mode?  <br>This? </br>  <br>Ah, that's it. Wanted to listen to Uri-tan sing, she's good.</br>  <br>Might want to check out the Character Song Vol 2 then, Uri-tan's song is undoubtedly the best best in it</br>  <br>Ni ce music? <br><br> Because Etotama also had them </br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry anon, but nothing will ever beat drunk Shima-tan's ED.</br>   Cat takes Ox's place as an Etoshin (temp) to protect Ox's region until Ox fully recovers. <br><br>I guess that Nya-tan got what she wanted somehow</br></br>  Or she could have saved all the trouble and just gone to  Vietnam you idiotic mangaka   <br>Poor Usa-tan.</br>  <br><br>That's the face of someone who wants Nya-tan to fucking leave his home for christ's sake Jesus fuck</br></br>  <br>But Dora-tan's song is best on that album.</br>  <br>Also, either each Eto-shin's character song or an original insert song sung by the respective Eto-shin plays during every boss fight.<br> One of the levels close to the endgame would have you play as Mo-tan fighting Chu-tan, then Chu-tan's health is at 0.1%, her EDGE takes over and spikes it up to 1000%. That's when you take over and you mercilessly destroy Mo-tan. </br></br>  <br>I'm sure she'll manage.</br>  <br><br>muh dick</br></br>  I ended up really liking tiger.  <br>I ended up loving my zodiac, monkey.</br>  <br><br>I'm really fond of Dragon.</br></br>  <br>She is gggrreeat.</br>  <br>Monkey is my zodiac too but she and dog deserved another proper episode.</br>  <br>I don't hate dog.</br>  <br> another <br>You mean at least one.<br>They had great designs (though Monkey being adult woman height really surprised me) and should have made a funny episode if they focused on them.</br></br></br>  <br>Her thighs were not muscled enough. I want her to crack walnuts with them.</br>  <br>Man, I love Inu-tan. I just wish the anime shared my love for her. Yeah, Yeah, everyone loves Cock and Tiger, we get it; but the two cuties didn't deserve to get shafted entirely.</br>  <br>I'd give Kii-tan a good shafting.</br>  <br>I guess the problem lies with too few episodes and too many important characters that just scream for a bit of development.<br><br>I wouldn't mind a season 2.</br></br></br>  <br> I want to fond  le  the Dragon.<br><br>Fixed that for you.</br></br></br>  <br>She would scold you relentlessly. Perish the thought.</br>  I WANT TO DO  romantic  AND  consensual  THINGS TO SHIMA-TAN.  This still would have been better as several cours of shorts.  <br>Nah, a full length series is better than a bunch of shorts.</br>  <br>I want to see her growl like a tiger.</br>  <br>It was probably that they didn't have anything (personality/power wise) to offer to the plot, being slapstick characters (the baka trio). <br><br>Des des was the exposition character while Tiger was the intimidating master you had to overcome, so they spoke regularly.</br></br></br>  Explain to Piyo-tan why Etotama deserves a second season.    <br>Fun things are fun.</br>  <br>We sure do need those fixed for the next season</br>  <br>The girls are super cute.</br>  <br><br>Piyo-tan will get an actual episode dedicated to her that's not shogi</br></br>  <br>That could make a good desktop background.</br>  <br> Snake doesn't even care </br>  Who will mostly get the very first r18 doujin?  <br>Piyo has already doujin incoming.</br>  <br>After Piyo, Shima or Uma, Mo only if she's milked.</br>  <br>the only question i have is<br>will there be horsedick</br></br>  <br>Rat. Just maybe.</br>  <br>They should all be able to magically give themselves animal-cocks.</br>  <br> des des cork screw pork screw </br>  <br>Don't forget shit loads of seminal fluids and then they harden up.</br>  <br>Cocks have absolutely tiny cocks.<br>It might be a stretch to even call them cocks.<br><br>Still, I would play with Piyo-tans little nub cock.</br></br></br></br>  <br>niggers niggers niggers niggers niggers</br>  <br>pfft that krusty cuntflakes girl is 9.8/10<br>rapist cow is best</br></br>  Reminder. <br/>  <br>Reminder - https://<span>youtu.be/SR_lWAZTdyc  [ ]</br>  <br>Cute.<br>Also, look at these healthy thighs and hips. <br><br>Are you telling me you wouldn't a Sheep?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Inu-tan kawaii</br>  <br><br>I want S2 to be more SOL-centered so we can see more interaction with the girls, but I do like the sexy CG action bits....</br></br>  <br><br>I want to live, thanks</br></br>  I want to do the annually shearing for Mei-tan  <br>To be honest, if she's really a Yandere she would be the very first Yandere I ever liked. <br><br>And I don't even like Yandere shit. <br><br>Maybe is just a joke.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think there is a special place in every anons heart for the character they love despite usually hating their character type.</br>  <br>It really isn't.<br>Just look at the opening even on her frame and how her face is like with the syringe equipped.</br></br>  <br>she's not a yandere! she just, er, care greatly for your health, yes, that must be it!</br>  <br>I've never found a tsundere that I don't hate.</br>  <br>Give it time anon, she'll find you one day.</br>  <br>Perhaps. They've come close a few times.</br>  <br> Just look at the opening <br>I can see what you mean.</br></br>  <br>That's what most "harems" are nowadays anyway. Usually only 2-3 girls at max actively want the dick.</br>  <br>You sick bastard.</br>  <br> Episode 1 <br>Inu and Kii just shot up in my ranking. That was fucking adorable.<br> episode 2 <br>Tits galore. Only thing Snake is good for.<br> Episode 3 <br>We really didn't get much out of her, did we? Shogi episode was GOAT, but she still didn't have much exposure.<br> Episode 4 <br>I want more. I WANT MORE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>White haired is fox, but what is the blonde haired one?</br>  <br>Blue Moment by Uri-tan is great. I love the little commentary you have in the song.<br> Shouldn't you spend money on buying sesame oil instead? Sesame oil is humanity treasure. <br>I need to buy the actual mini-albums now.<br><br>Aye. They even move into Takeru's house yet they somehow get less screentime.</br></br></br></br></br>  Good night dear fellow anons. <br>The tide is starting to fade away slowly.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2IF<wbr>kpsmNH3E</wbr>  [ ] Well we finally have the new Dragon Ball Z movie in not absolute shit quality. Anyone who speaks Spanish needs to start working on subs right away.  <br>Anybody gonna see it in theaters? I'm considering it.</br>  <br>I will, but that's over a month away and I want to see it before I start watching "Super".</br>   conveniently I randomly skip to the scene where Piccolo gets BTFO'd by some random-ass Frieza henchmen <br><br>Aaaaand dropped.</br></br>  <br>These accents sound strange. Which Spanish-speaking country dubbed this film?</br>  <br>That's huelense you gringo</br>  <br>Argentina I think.</br>  <br><br>dont do it, i went yesterday and lost my money, the movie is crap</br></br>  <br>it's not out yet.</br>  <br>it is in my country</br>  <br><br><br>Wrong, it's mexico, it's the original cast of DBZ latin american dubbing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Actually I am wrong, this is fucken portugese.</br></br>  <br>The movie probably wont even matter to anything anyway.

I really want to watch this before Super starts.  <br>別にどっちでもいいから早く日本語のフル版見たいよ</br>  <br>Nothing beats Dutch though.<br>Portuguese isn't even that ugly, it just sounds funny, like, you can't take Brazilians seriously.</br></br>  <br><br>Fair enough.</br></br>  <br>not only you<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9fL<wbr>pmrB1L7A</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>uhm, where do we start?<br>A cheesy first scene, forced fights,and if you have lurked enough you may already know about  the new transformation of goku   it was so forced and so generic that my cringe box broke <br>and i'm not saying is bad "bad", what i'm saying is that it doesn't have the quality of the previous movies  the toei's ones </br></br></br>  <br>lel'd</br>  <br>Somethings wrong, the scene with Frieza talking to Beerus is missing.</br>  <br>And some other scenes too it looks like.

It so fun, the OST is great and the characters, holy shit look at this  you can guess how the show is.</br>    <br>Hopefully we'll get a season 2 once some more LNs come out.</br>    <br>Is it still continuing? I know there's already a spinoff LN.</br>   you'll never drink with a dragon   Feels werid to think this was a kyoani show.<br><br>Like it doesn't fit in with any of the others at all.</br></br>  <br> mistress finds out her lover is already married.jpg </br>   Tirami taking a shit <br><br>why did I laugh</br></br>  <br> Future-kun, the guide, gives our guests an endless lecture about how humanity has destroyed the global environment.

Much different than expected.  <br>the fairies are all in their 20s though. If they had any schooling it was a 2 year degree of some kind otherwise they'd all be christmas cakes.</br>  <br>this. I want to see more shiina</br>  Holy shit KyoAni, horrifying.    Sylphy's blue shorts make me hard as diamonds.  I forgot how good the opening was.  <br><br>So I take it I should pick up the show and not just go back to the doujins?</br></br>  <br> That Chun-Li victory jump </br>  why are they best girls?  You like shit.  <br>Not Picking<br> Mea <br> Kotegawa <br> Rin <br> Nana <br> Kyouko <br> Yami <br>etc. I can name them all. You have good taste with Momo and Mikan. But if you just stop there then you're a failure to me. Step up your game /a/non.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The harem would be to strong Normalfags wouldn't be able to take it</br>  <br>I don't see Haruna in your list.<br><br><br>remove the underage b&amp;</br></br></br></br>  <br>reminder that Haruna is shit and drags the entire series down</br>  <br>Switch mikan with kotegawa, then we can agree</br>  <br>because</br>  <br>thats not best girl</br>  <br>They would make a good lewd tag team</br>  <br>Haruna &gt; Lala</br>  Momo &gt; Everyone else  why don't theses two get more love?  <br>Such a waste for making an elementary school girl, and then give her a teenage body.<br>Don't misunderstand, Mikan is still delicious, but if they already took the risk of incest antics and being 12, they should have made her a loli too.</br></br>  <br>But shes in middle school? and she needs to fulfill the Imouto you'd like to fuck roll</br>  <br>Pretty sure a lot of people would like to fuck her too if she were a loli.</br>  <br>I can't deny this<br><br>especially the lolicons here on /a/</br></br></br>  <br>The point is that she would fill in a much needed gap.</br>  <br>She is still in grade school.</br>  <br>I really liked loli Lala. It's as shame she is back to normal.</br>  <br>Yeah, most amazing design for sure for a lolicon.</br>  I think the series has enough token loli's as is  <br>There isn't a loli in TLR, that's the whole point we're talking about.</br>  Cakes for me  I got this. Don't worry.  <br>  Nana and Mea not in S <br>  Genderbender shit not last <br><br>Nah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You already have two supreme flat chest goddesses in the S+.</br>  <br>Kyoko not in A, the fuck is wrong with you</br>  Never watched this series but I like doujins with Momo and Nana  <br>The bigger problem is Mea</br>  <br>According to Rito, Kyoko looks exactly the same as Haruna.
