[ Am I being baited? Tell me why this is good.  Who are you even addressing?  Because it is. I think it's pretty obvious.  Which was worse? This or Plastic Memories?  You got baited.  <br>Tsukasa got a new waifubot, what does glasses-kun got?</br>  You got baited. It's shit.  <br>Delicious osananajimi.</br>  i fucking enjoyed this series<br>would recommend 5/5</br>  <br>Baseball girl.</br>  <br>It's better than most, but since it doesn't fit into the mold that most /a/ autists are used to and scored high elsewhere, everyone here hates it.</br>  <br>It was bad, m8.</br>  I don't like NTR.  because best girl won.  <br>Yeah, it bad. But is it as horrible as /a/ makes it out to be or was it blown into ludicrous levels due to /a/ autism? I say the latter.</br>  <br>I enjoyed it for the music.</br>  <br><br> /a/ autism <br>What do you even mean by that?</br></br></br>  <br>It fit exactly into the mold of sentimental pap. You might as well watch Saikano or some Key-based garbage.</br>  <br><br>Friendship end isn't winning.</br></br>  <br>But does Saikano get the same level of derision as Shigatsu? I would say not. A lot of that hate is just /a/ not being happy with how it rates in MAL and trying to jump onto the Edge bandwagon.</br>  Looked amazing <br>Sounded amazing<br>Awful characters, story and melodrama(this coming from someone who likes most of Okada's stuff)</br></br>  <br> Friendship isn't winning <br>Welcome to 4chan</br></br>  <br> childish melodrama <br> good </br></br>  I really enjoyed it, I can understand why some people wouldn't if they didn't enjoy the music  <br>What?<br>Most people enjoyed music but hated everything else</br></br>  <br>There's being delusional and then there's ignoring the source material. She says she won't leave him alone, he just turns away and ignores her. The end.</br>  <br>Or maybe the facts that's it's melodramatic garbage?</br>  <br>The music was the only enjoyable part aside from visuals.</br>  <br>I was refering to it in a much wider sense.<br>Beyond the world of animu and 2D.<br>A world that existed before anon-kun turned animu watching weeb who's craving for that 2D pussy.</br></br></br>  <br> 14-15 year olds spewing generic, abstract, melodramatic garbage from their mouths <br> true musicians are tragic <br> not being honest until it's too late <br>   piano not winning the Arimabowl <br><br>or<br><br> actually doing your job <br> confessing and going on dates knowing that your time will end soon <br> being strong enough to tough it out and let it end naturally <br>   that guy who let them on the ferris wheel <br><br>You decide.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's good, it's emotional and it makes you want to learn piano if you dont already do.</br>  It was better than most melodramas until the sadistic loli showed up.  <br>People are sadistic and enjoy watching a faggot every episode over anything</br>  I loved it but it's not really the best thing ever.<br><br>it was disappointing that she didn't give him at least a footjob.</br></br>  It focuses a little bit more on music unlike Hibikek.  <br><br>Pretty much describes most popular anime nowadays. The writing for anime is so godawful these days I'm admittedly having trouble staying interested in it and I really don't ask for much. It's like shit can barely even be entertaining on the writing let alone actually make me give a shit. Even American TV has less problems with it's animated stuff nowadays and it used to be completely the other way around. I really do have to wonder what exactly happened, like when did Japan get especially bad at writing?</br></br>  <br><br>Shigatsu didn't have aggressive fanservice and camera angles for people to be stupid over so in the absence of that the ever retarded internet anime fanbase just defaulted to the only other thing it knows how to do, complain and bitch constantly.<br><br>Both shows are pretty lousy in their own way and a continued disgrace to what used to be a halfway decent block for anime in noitaminA. Some day I hope there can be a new block in the vein of the noitaminA of old that shitty producers like A-1 don't have sole dominion over so that we can get some more palatable content again.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty much all you need to do nowadays to earn the praises of the masses is have sappy teen melodrama or lots and lots of fanservice and flashy action sequences and that automatically makes something a masterpiece so forgive me if I don't really think to much of the whole everywhere else defense.<br><br>We're talking about a fanbase that esteems stuff like KEY as a high watermark in TV drama after all so lets not give too much credit where it hasn't been earned really.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Guess what kind of shit is really popular in the anime community nowadays</br></br>  <br>The Nips don't want good writing. They want something they can watch when their brains are turned off so that they can escape from reality. Logic and realism be damned. Just yell, cry, and do impossible stunts and they'll be appeased.</br>  I liked it alot, though there's a bunch of shit I would shit over it<br> shitty bgm, piano music is nice but bgm was fucking lame <br> 24 episodes of mc still thinking that blonde was in love with friend, if he wasnt such a beta faggot he might have brought her a bit more happiness before she died </br></br>  <br>I too am interested in the answer to this</br>  It was average aside from the music and the visuals, but I liked it. Not any worse than most anime /a/ obsesses over.  They should have just shut up and play the music. I don't want to hear their retarded "philosophical" speeches.  <br><br>Even then though you'd still think most series would be entertaining but a lot nowadays that you think would manage at least that much still manage to be kind of annoying and irritating. Like for example there's no reason a show like Owari no Seraph or you're average Aniplex original like Aldnoah.Zero or Guilty Crown has to be quite as bad as it is but somehow they manage to more than negate anything that is positive about the audio/visual experience or simply guilty pleasures of the action sequences by having some of the worst written characters and story arcs you'll see in any medium in any country. It's just inexplicable to me how a country can fuck up so bad at it's own medium so often lately. This is coming from somebody that is generally okay with shows like Gurren Lagann and Code Geass too which while they aired last decade still aren't actually a decade old yet.<br><br><br><br>Yeah I'm glad somebody else thinks it's a fair question. Like what the fuck happened in the anime scene that someone like Gen Urobuchi for example is hailed as this amazing unparalleled write by so many nowadays. Like he's not an absolutely horrible writer when it comes to scripts and can even be kind of good, but man if this guy really is the absolute best the anime industry can muster nowadays and that we can hope for then IMO that's a really big problem and anime is pretty much doomed to fall by the wayside to other forms of entertainment. Even the most basic of blockbuster comic book movies these days I find more compelling in terms of writing and characterization and that's to say nothing for the likes of stuff like Daredevil which is light years head of where any anime can hope to touch on that front and both of these mediums spawn largely from the realms of comics and teen fantasy stuff, just from different countries.<br><br>I don't know, maybe Japan needs to start seriously considering letting writers from other countries take a stab at things, it couldn't hurt.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is the kind of SHIT I can't stand.<br><br>Beta as fuck MCs. I GET not wanting to take things too fast or w/e Japanese bullshit but fucking hell man grow some testicles and do something other than idolize her and put her on a pedestal that you make yourself believe you can't reach.<br><br>Fucking shit is gay</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The only really good writer I can think of that's currently working in the anime industry is Yuasa.<br><br>Also, is it just me or have the past few seasons been especially shitty?</br></br></br>  <br> generally okay with shows like Gurren Lagann and Code Geass <br>Those are garbage too, double standard faggot.</br></br>  <br> Seraph <br>Eh, I think this show is fine as it is. Some kid wants to bust some vampire heads and is actively working to get strong enough to do it. Nothing special or outstanding, but not wallowed in victim card playing.</br></br>  <br>I think OnS is below average in general, but above average in terms of it's medium.</br>  <br>Not him, but, at least Code Geass was more entertaining than A.Z.</br>  <br><br>I know, anime is so fucking awful. We should just watch film, we get masterpieces like this every year.</br></br>  <br>it's not good. it's shit.</br>  <br> I don't know, maybe Japan needs to start seriously considering letting writers from other countries take a stab at things, it couldn't hurt. <br>Don't they have a couple of writers from outside Japan?</br></br>  <br> comprehension skills </br>  <br>Well, I know I'm no person to talk about this topic, but even though I've been into anime/manga/VNs/etc just for 4 years when I watch something from late 90's or early 2000's I can tell there's something those shows had that nowadays shows are lacking.<br>My bet would be the LNs occupying an important niche in nowadays anime.<br>Even though I enjoy to read some LNs I have to admit that their writting is lackluster at best for the mayority of them. And with the fan's interest in the production of anime adaptations of this crap growing actively, animation studios prefer to invest in this shit because they know they're going to sell good, thus leaving just a few bucks to make some quality content.<br>  please pardon my awkward english  </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm sorry, I skipped over it, but I still can't take anyone who thinks capeshit like the Avengers is better than anime seriously. If you think all anime is bad than you need to watch more anime.</br></br>  <br>Watch just the first 13 episodes, everything after it doesn't contribute to the story or the characters at all, is boring, predictable and very annoying, she dies if you didn't know, but that is pointless too.</br>  <br>Because best girl won in the end.</br>  <br>Are you sure you're not just cherry picking a few shows from pre-2000 to back up your argument?</br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br><br>LN adaptations usually sell like shit. I remember in winter with all those battle harems and most didn't sell well at all.</br></br>  It was Nodame Cantabile, as written by John Green.  <br><br>To be fair most LN-to-anime adaptations get pennies for their budget. The best thing you'll probably get out of those dime-a-dozen seasonals is either the music or one particular voice actor's performance. The visuals are almost guaranteed to be trash or gimmicky at best. They'll more than likely be aired during the winter or summer seasons too.</br></br>  I thought it was very good.<br>It did the teen melodrama better than any other show as of late.<br><br> Also /a/ hipster effect </br></br></br>  <br>A.Z was a fucking abomination and A-1 Pictures should stay far, far away from mecha. Don't even compare it to CG.</br>  <br>She's a slut</br>  <br>Spot on, anon. At least post-tumblr John Green.</br>  <br>Or maybe you can't argue without buzzwords?</br>  <br> piano not winning <br>She wasn't even a love interest, she is side character you retarded waifufag</br></br>  <br><br>Sometimes I wonder how something so abominably awful got approved. Like, somewhere, sometime, someone looked at the script and said that it was okay to air.</br></br>  <br>Let me just repeat what everyone else in the thread is saying:<br> &gt;melodrama <br> &gt;good <br>Even if it "did it better" it's still melodrama and it's still shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought the one that's just ending was decent enough but the past three leading back to last Spring ranged from awful at worst to largely disappointing at best to the point where it's had me asking a lot of questions. I really can't remember a stretch quite as long where I've felt as largely ambivalent towards and uncertain of currently popular anime. The kind of stuff that's getting all the attention from fans, advertising bucks and budgets I mean.</br></br>  <br><br>They clearly just looked at the names they'd assembled to work on it and the advertising and hyping they had to back it and said they were good. The way anime fans are nowadays they were sort of half right as well. I think that's part and parcel the biggest problem anime faces is that you don't even have to have a coherent story and compelling characters to have a hit anymore. You can have a show like that one and people will still largely give it a pass and say good job and tune in in pretty good numbers.</br></br>    KIITEITAI KOE WA KIMI GA MONO DATTA YO ;_;   <br>It could've been a 9/10 if they took out all of the chibi comedy stuff. Otherwise It's still pretty enjoyable and has really good presentation.</br>  <br>Manly tears were shed when this song started rolling.</br>  <br>I honestly couldn't cry, but I wanted to.</br>  Not protecting smiles is the new meme.  <br>Go 15 years back. Here's 2000. Every single show that aired that year.</br>  <br>Now this year. Here's Winter</br>  <br>His piano.</br>  <br>It's good in the sense that if you never watch realistic animes, you cry. Same way Clannad was "good". Full of melodrama, it's readily apparent from early in the series that  she's a goner . Most people who cried hard to this watched Naruto, Bleach, and Juan Piece or some other shounenshit or moeshit, and end up suseptible to dramatic animes.<br><br>SZSwomancryingatabook.jpeg</br></br></br>  <br>Summer</br>  <br> Digimon 02 <br>WAOTY 2000.</br></br>  <br>And the vast majority of them are trash, what a surprise.</br>  <br><br>It looks like shit</br></br>  /a/ is full of cynical twats that hate all anime that try to act on emotions because they have lost them all long ago.  <br>Using emotion to drive your actions is fine. That's what all people do to an extent.<br><br>Acting without thinking isn't fine.</br></br></br>  <br>You misread. <br>Name an anime that focused on character drama that tried to make you sad that you liked.</br></br>  I didn't think it was overly melodramaitc, yes sometimes it was forced, but even still the writing was fine, all the characters and their motivations all made sense and as did the story. It never was forcing you to feel sad, that is like Angel Beats. Considering the majority of anime now have shit stories I don't get the amount of hate it gets here. It seems like it is overrated everywhere else, and underrated on /a/.   No Yuru Yuri thread <br><br>Chinasue did nothing wrong</br></br>  <br>I would consider ruining yuru yuri as something wrong.

I wish I had friends who were into VN's, but sadly that's not the case. All my friends would think I'm fucking weird if I told them I was into this shit.</br>  <br>One. I have no idea how I could explain I play VN's to anyone I know.</br>  <br><br>It's like you don't know several autists who are into the same shit as you.</br></br>  <br>Is that a fleur-de-lis on Rimi's disword?</br>  <br>I don't. All my friends are a bunch of normies. Only a couple have ever watched anime, and only one watches it regularly. And even he doesn't read VN's.</br>  <br>post &gt;yfw when Steins Gate was predicting the EMDrive.</br>  <br>It's a little hard to find people who are into this kind of things when you work in a especially serious environment.</br>  <br>What's the relation of Chaos;Child to Chaos;Head? Why is Seira-Tan on that picture?</br>  <br>It seems like it, you're an interesting Frenchman for spotting it.<br><br>Here is another picture for comparison, seems like you're right.<br><br>Seems like I have been blessed.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> What's the relation of Chaos;Child to Chaos;Head? <br>Chaos;Child is a direct sequel to Chaos;Head Love Chuchu, which is a direct sequel to Chaos;Head.<br> Why is Seira-Tan on that picture? <br>Because that picture is for Chaos;Head Dual.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn Nips putting unrelevant symbols on everything.</br>  <br>All Di-Swords have some sort of symbol engraved unto it.<br><br>Look at Sena's for example.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, thank you my friendly anon. I might start Chaos;Head VNs on Android as soon as possible, since the anime quite made me interested on it.</br>  <br>...Aquarius?</br>  <br> since the anime quite made me interested on it. <br>You poor soul.<br><br>May you forget everything that you saw, so you can experience it in the true way it was meant to be.<br><br>But seriously, if you know Japanese, why did you start with the anime?<br>Just why?<br><br>I don't think so, the Aquarius looks different.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That looks like the fucking symbol for resistance</br>  <br>It's easier to look at on the Dual picture</br>  <br>Thanks for the image. Do you have any where the swords are clearly visible? The CGs aren't generally the best for that. I'd love to see Taku and Ayase's in particular.<br><br><br>I'm not sure if it's irrelevant. It's a symbol of purity  and Virgin Mary, among other things. . Make of that whatever you want.<br><br>That said, I've been autisming recently about whether there's some hidden layer of symbolism in C;H. I think there's a pretty good case for it, but I need to replay the game.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In the Dual image above, it reminded me of NOZOMI's logo a bit, but otherwise I'm lost.</br></br>  <br>   and Virgin Mary, among other things <br>Wow, never heard of fleur-de-lis symbolising that too. I always connected it with Joan Of Arc in my mind though.</br></br>  <br>If he's a guy, why he's wearing miko outfit instead of kannushi one? Is his dad into incest traps?</br>  <br>Apperantly  his dad and sister forced him to wear girls clothes when she was little. </br>  <br> His sister liked to dress him as a girl when he was little. </br>  <br>I don't have any official art where their Di-Swords are visible, but doesn't the hilt of Taku's sword not have an eye on it?<br><br>Well, one can play the 2deep4u game until one is sick of it, so I hop you'll have fun in your autism.<br><br> she </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a tradition to lead misfortune away, yes, but he's not a child anymore.</br>  <br> Kurisu in Miko <br><br>I NEED MORE</br></br></br>  <br>My mind and  my dick  is confused about that matter.</br>  <br>What kind of place do you work in, anon?</br>  <br>He is a homosexual male, there is nothing to be confused about.<br><br>Are you a homosexual male?<br>If the answer is yes, I wish you two well.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm happy to oblige. She looks beautiful in it.</br>  <br>I work in a court.</br>  <br> He is a homosexual male, there is nothing to be confused about. <br>Which looks, acts and sounds like a girl.</br></br>  <br>Once I rented out two rooms to weebs for two semesters and slept on the couch. Scenes like this were common where I'd play Japanese VNs on the PS3 and explain the gist of the story while one roommate built gunpla (or in this case the Muv Luv Takemikazuchi).</br>  <br>Please don't judge me for my tastes.<br> Do you get it, judge me? </br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's an eye. I thought so, but doesn't it it look more like an arrow?<br><br>And thanks. I know I will.</br></br></br>  <br>Announcements when?<br> Please. <br><br>We went over this so many times, I'm tired of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought it looks like an eye, but after digging out this CG here, I know better.</br>  <br>I  do  get it.</br>  <br>I get it, anon.<br><br>Also, why the hell is this thread moving so fucking fast? Are meme OPs really that effective?</br></br></br>    <br><br>It looked like an Imperial Eagle to me for some reason.</br></br>  <br>Japanese wiki says that the original Di-sword designs are based on flowers.</br>  <br>There is no fist on Takumi's Di-Sword though.<br><br>Because now we have actual discussion about hidden symbolic meanings on Di-Swords.<br><br>I can see it, but if it's a Reichsadler, it doesn't have a head.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But why flowers?<br><br>And who is what flower?</br></br></br>    <br> it doesn't have a head. <br>I can't quite see if there is even something in the middle because of the light though. It might just be that I'm blind too.</br></br>  <br>You do me a great favour. Though, what the hell is that. Explosion? Radiating light? I've no idea. <br><br><br>Hmm. That's very interesting, though I'm not sure how that translates into shapes like that of Rimi's or Nanami's.<br><br>Also, does that mean I'm correct in thinking that Nanami's got a tulip in the centre of the crossguard?<br><br> googling tulip symbolism <br> see this: http://www.proflowers.com/blog/hist<wbr>ory-and-meaning-of-tulip</wbr> <br> mfw </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know one person most definitely buying it, a bro that may be buying it and another with a very slim chance of buying it. May buy a second copy for someone though.</br>  <br>Incest being perfect love is nothing new.</br>  <br>Why do you have to ruin everything?<br><br><br> Still waiting on that copypasta. </br></br></br></br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>What do?</br></br></br>  <br>Stop having delusions.</br>  <br> KURISTINAAAAAAAAAAAAA </br>  <br> I want to wait for the anime to be honest. I'd like to not spoil people with a copy pasta. You'll get it one day. </br>  <br>I know, it's just kind of hilarious if that's what they had in mind when they put it in the middle of the sword that's a manifestation of her delusions.<br><br>Oh.<br><br>Wouldn't that imply that Nana subconsciously craves oniichan's dick?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Took you long enough to realize, isn't it plain obvious, that Nana wants her Onii to love her?</br>  <br>Well duh, of course. But loving your onii is not equal to LOVING your onii.</br>  <br>She wants him to give her a good bang le </br>  <br>She loved her Onii, but started LOVING (as you put it) the man who she thought was her Onii.</br>  <br>Who thought the buying of the fake Di-Sword would have such far reaching consequences?</br>  <br>Okay, that would make sense.<br><br> I WANT DUAL AND I WANT IT NOW </br></br></br>  <br>Moeka a  best.

Fuckin' Kevin.</br></br>  <br>I hate and love her.</br>  <br>W-what if it's C;C?</br>  <br><br>Thought Dual was confirmed for not happening?</br></br>  <br>Kevin once sent me an email that had<br> 'sent from my blackbury whatever' <br>Fucking hell Kevin, get with the times.</br></br></br>  <br>That was at the end of the mail, too. I just cropped it out.</br>  <br>Then I would be disappointed. I want an actual explanation for all the shit in, and conclusion to, C;H before moving on. not like it's actually gonna happen anyway.<br><br><br>Nope. All they've done is keep giving us hints that it could be happening.</br></br></br></br>  <br>C;C is not understandable without Noah and Chuchu.</br>  <br>Donations to get Kevin a good phone when?</br>  <br>What the hell Kevin?</br>  <br>I vote we get him a Droid Turbo. I love mine.</br>  <br>Are we making an unaffiliated PQube employee a sciADV meme now? I want FUCKIN' KEVIN to become the new ROBOTS.</br>  <br>Is it okay to start the hype engines? To which velocity should I set it?<br>Noah?<br>Dual?<br>Darling?<br>Elite?<br>Child?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some where between Noah and Dual. I doubt they'd do a Child release before Head</br>  <br>I want my CHUCHU now.</br>    <br><br>I think they could pull it off, with the anime coming out somewhere at the time.</br></br>  <br> Retweeted by PQube <br>So, NoaH, eh?</br></br>  <br>I don't know if it's just my country, but blackburys have been dead for years, any phone would be better.<br><br>I will happily blame any localisation or delays on fucking Kevin from now on.</br></br></br>  <br>Steiner retweeted it too.</br>  <br>They're pretty dead in America. It's either Droid or iShit out here.</br>  Wait, wait, wait<br><br>https://twitter.com/5pbgamesUSA/sta<wbr>tus/613420318762254336<br><br>If this is true, are we gonna have a licensing battle between PQube and 5pb America?<br>I know that this may speed the releases, but the quality may suffer because the different translations.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  That R is a blight on the otherwise most perfect picture of my husbando.  <br>That's a girl, baby</br>  <br>FUCK OFF HE HAS A PEEN AND DON'T GIVE ME NO TRANSGENDER BULLSHIT HE KNOWS HES A GUY AND ACCEPTS IT HE AIN'T NO HIPSTER FAGGOT HES JUST A FAGGOT.</br>  <br>There wouldn't be a licensing battle because 5pb. USA is a direct extension of 5pb. They'd win every time. Blick and Steiner aren't with 5pb either, so the translation would be different.</br>  <br>Settle down, Brohan. There's nothing wrong with liking girls.</br>  <br>They won't do a shitty insider translation, will they?<br>They will hire Steiner again for the job, yes?</br></br>  <br>Blick and Steiner are freelancers, they can be with whoever they want.</br>  <br>If Steiner was going to be on it, he would've probably been contacted by now. And he clearly isn't due to a tweet he made to 5pb.<br><br><br>Right but 5pb isn't as likely to hire them because they're Japs and don't know their western reputation. Japanese people are apprehensive, too, so they'd probably pick their own people like that Italian chick they used to poorly sub the Steins;Gate movie.</br></br></br></br>  So we will finally get all SciADV, but in the most terrible ENGRISH imaginable?<br><br> Despair </br></br>    <br> PQUBE does C;H, Chuchu, R;N, C;C with Steiner and Blick <br> 5bp do all the S;G related shit with   Zakobot or shit inhouse </br></br>  <br>Would not fucking mind. Hell, I could even put up with my husbando's name being misseplt with an R if it meant all other sciADV being uncontaminated.</br>  <br>Sounds fucking awful.<br>Zakobot's a cunt anyway.</br></br>  <br> my husbando <br> husbando <br><br>We went over this already</br></br></br></br>    <br>I ain't some kind of... straighty, alright?</br>  <br>I don't mind Renri and Phenogram's translation to be bad, but I do mind Zero's translation, because it's canon.</br>      C;H looked really interesting to me at first with all the murder stuff, but these characters with all their stupid looking giant fantasy swords really turn me off. Can anyone tell me what the deal is with them?  <br>How about you play the game and find out?</br>  <br>It's all explained and reasonable.<br>Explaining it here would spoil it.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather just know now instead of buying or downloading it.</br>  <br> reasonable <br><br>Hmm.</br></br></br>  <br>S;G looked really interesting to me at first with all the time travel stuff, but these characters with all their stupid looking hacked together gadgets really turn me off. Can anyone tell me what the deal is with them?</br>  So let me get this straight.<br>PQube are confirmed to release another SciADV game this year, we just don't know which for sure?<br>Is that right? That's fucking exciting.</br></br>  <br> The swords are delusions. </br>  <br> gadgets literally do nothing <br>I don't want to play something with an interesting premise that ruins it with generic magic shit.</br></br>  <br>There. Thank you. Now that makes it look a whole lot more appealing.</br>  <br>The swords are not magic, it's set in the same universe as Steins;Gate.</br>  <br>5pb. USA is not a direct extension of 5pb. It's a publicity front run by another company, Strangely Compelling Media. Yeah, they localized Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds, but they're not a subsidiary of 5pb.<br><br><br>PQube didn't retweet that. They follow the guy's account because he's an employee.</br></br></br></br>  <br> gadgets literally do nothing <br>The entire story of Steins;Gate revolves around Future Gadget #8.</br></br>  <br>But it's VERY strongly suggested to be either Noah or Dual. I guess C;C is possible too, but extremely unlikely given the circumstances.</br>  <br>The only gadget that does anything. Literally created by accident.</br>  <br>Still a gadget, assmunch</br>  <br>He's a  girl in my worldline. </br>  <br>What is even your fucking point? You said the gadgets didn't affect the plot, when clearly they do, regardless of if they were made on accident on purpose.</br>  <br> What is Moad Snake? </br>  <br>Your point?</br>  <br>Future Gadget 204's crash was instrumental in preventing WWIII.<br>Future Gadget 6 would've saved Okabe about a month in the hospital if it worked correctly<br>Future Gadget 4 was used as a diversion against the Rounders<br>Future Gadget 1 allowed Okabe to bluff against both Moeka and the Viral Attackers</br></br></br></br>        Cucked.  <br>Yours?</br>  <br> Future Gadget 204's crash was instrumental in preventing WWIII. <br>This is false, FG 204 is only in Alpha, necessary for reaching Beta Attractor.<br>What you're thinking of is C204.</br></br></br>  <br>OkabexChristina OTP</br>  <br> Not OkabeX  Moeka <br>Anon pls.</br></br>  Kurisu "Christina, Assistant, American Virgin, Perverted Genius Girl, Zombie, Celeb 17" Makise  <br>In Alpha, the crash of the FG204 prevented WWIII (and instead allowed SERN's dystopia to form) because the crash cancelled Nakabachi's conference, meaning he did not get Kurisu's paper to sell to the Russians.<br><br>The C204 didn't crash.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, so that was what you meant.<br>I'm sorry.<br>That is of course true.<br><br>Yet it wasn't its intended purpose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yet it wasn't its intended purpose. <br>And?</br></br>  <br>And it brought more harm than good.<br>But the FG204 is not at fault, #8 is.<br>It's the devil's machine.<br><br>If only Okabe would have developed a godly machine, as Norose did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is that boy Ruka or girl Ruka?

Did it even sell well enough for another season?  It'll be lucky to break 5K.  What was wrong with it? Animation was good and the story followed the LNs pretty closely.  <br>Jesus fuck you're an idiot</br>  <br> Did it even sell well enough for another season? <br><br>I hope not.</br></br></br>  <br>Seemed as if it was fucking rushed in my opinion.</br>  Low budget, trying to run off the success of prior seasons with as little animation as possible..  <br> Did it even sell well enough for another season? <br>I fucking hope not. Anime original shit should be punished.<br><br><br> and the story followed the LNs pretty closely. <br>It LITERALLY made shit up, like Loki's dumbass curse, Rias suddenly having a fucking Balance Breaker, fake Issei, this entire season was a trainwreck.<br><br>I hope Season 4 never even exists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rias suddenly having a fucking Balance Breaker, <br><br>I dropped S3 midway, what the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>I mostly watched it for the breasts. S1 and S2 BOOSTO! was way better than in S3. A bit similar to how Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha was in my opinion, S1 was good, S2 was better and S3 was just mediocre.</br>  <br><br>S1 was fucking hilarious, S2 was mediocre and dragged too much, but S3 was a disaster.</br></br>  that final episode was pretty awful<br> fight scenes are just motion blurred still frames </br>  <br> that tiny face on Issei <br> those giant arms on Koneko <br> those fucked up proportions overall </br></br></br>  This is a scary person.  <br>What? To die? What the fuck?<br><br> Sorry for being a filthy secundario. </br></br></br>  <br>Tsundere tears are the most delicious of all. There will be lots of them next volume.</br>  <br>It is NEVER nice to see her cry.</br>  <br><br>Pretty much the first thing Akane said to Utaha was for her to die. She pretty much works the people under her to death.</br></br>  <br><br>Eriri just doesn't deserve to win. She's hurt Tomoya way too much.</br></br>  Weekend waifu/husbando drawthread #7<br><br>Remember to take it easy. <br><br>Thread #6:</br></br></br></br>  Requesting *Hyun-ae in a one piece zipper swimusuit.

If you put lots of time into something, figure new things out (bestwith reference) and really trying to improve then you really will learn something. Otherwise you just get faster at drawing things you already can do.<br><br>You're waifu is a cute though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Who cares about mistakes, just don't post it until you get somewhat confident about your drawings if you are so afraid, get a friend or two to show your shit if you REALLY feel necessary to show them to somebody and keep powering yourself up, stop being such pansy ass.</br>    Requesting my lovely wife, Yuzuko, getting a brain freeze from eating shaved ice.

Loli Maka is always appreciated and yours is cute!

You fucking stop that.</br>  <br>Dat butt.</br>  What happened to palette anons  <br>Positive reinforcement works a lot better than negative. They can always improve.  And a lot of what people think is shit really isn't that bad, I've seen far worse. </br>  <br> that spoiler <br>Do you honestly believe that you're so bad? That delivery i really cute and funny.<br>Believe in yourself!</br></br></br>  Well, I had a good run. 3 weeks in a row's not too bad. I salute those of you who persist until the very end, and will see you in the next week  <br>Cute idea. Reminded me of  Washizucopter .</br>   past 11 <br>I- I still have time to draw something, right?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>being worse != not being bad. and positive reinforcement != baseless praise. I get what you're saying, but encouraging and praising are 2 different things, and as a drawfag I personally would prefer a critique over calling something cute.<br>likewise I've also seen plenty of people -see deviantart- who think they're at a perfectly acceptable level because other people praise it. this shouldn't be allowed especially on 4chan of all places.<br><br>what you should do is something similar to just telling them to keep drawing and point at things they're doing right while giving them advice on what they're doing wrong, but telling clearly bad artists they're doing great will probably do more harm than good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should finish that. OR will love it.</br>  <br>You probably have another 12 hours or so at the least. WWD doesn't end until the last thread does.</br>  Requesting Vert wearing a suit and tie, please!  Hope is dead and nobody likes her  <br>Cute style. Have you drawn here before?</br>  <br><br><br>I like to have dynasties in sports, so Diego or one of the previous winners. Momochi would also be acceptable.</br></br></br>  希望はありますか？  絶望!    <br>Oh man, didn't think I would get a delivery this late.<br>Thanks for creating hope from where there was none, and have a pleasant week!</br></br>  <br>I can wait until next week.</br>  <br>Next week will be the week of weeks.</br>  <br>request her as a loli next week and I'll do it.</br>  <br>I've been meaning to do that so I just might.</br>  Any streams?  <br>Always.</br>  <br>Galilfag here, I actually want this girl<br>http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Girtablilu<br><br> If that is ok with you, if not any other desert monsters would be fine. </br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> Boo~ </br></br>  <br>ダメ？</br>  Don't worry, anon! You're waifu will be drawn by Sharkbro next weekend!  <br>have a good weekend kafukabro, and everyone else. Be sure to take it easy this week~</br>  <br> as a drawfag myself <br>Lol ok</br></br>  <br>I hope he delivers Sunday.

I started watching and reading Jojo and other non-moeshit. I pushed Jojo on my friends hard and they refused to watch it. Everytime they do watch something I like, they like it too. But for some reason they're stubborn faggots when it comes to Jojo, probably just to spite me. Then when I do get some other people into Jojo, they take too fucking long to read. I've got one on Part 5 who's going like a chapter a month.</br>  <br>I'm not a daiyafag but that art is god tier.<br><br>Also, can someone explain to me this jap art trend of only coloring some parts of their art?

You're gullible as fuck.</br>  So what's everyone's opinion on Part 6's ending?<br><br>It made me feel empty inside, considering THAT'S how it ends after 80 fucking volumes. Was it worth it? Was it all the JoJo's work in vain? Why was Part 5 so unimportant?</br></br>  <br>It's the name of the other half.

I mean, they DID send Koichi to see if he was an evil ass like his father or not   and to actually confirm that he was Dio's son   . Turned out he wasn't a shitter so they let him do his thing.</br>  <br>I found it weird how they all died in the same fucking chapter, fucking Gay Priest killed them all in less than six goddamn pages and then proceeds to get rekt by fucking Emporio.</br>  <br>This is why Pucci is best villain.</br>  could a kind anon give me the romaji for this?  <br>And a ching chong nip nong to you Jotaro</br>  <br><br>jotaro: ahhh yes i will have the general tzus chicken wit egg roll<br><br>dio: pickup or derivery?</br></br></br></br>  <br>from right to left<br><br> 8 byou keika! <br> n-n~~~~~~~~♪ <br> Jitsu ni!

Just piece it together without being too overwhelmed by all the imagery. If you read the translation of the PSX game, it might make a bit more sense. In a couple hours I'm planning on posting what I think is what's actually going on in the series along with all my 25 pages of notes on the game with summaries so we can have an interesting discussion - that is, if enough people want to discuss it.</br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> ayy lmaos <br> talking to dolphins <br> ultra specific layer of magnetic field brain magic <br><br>feck off ya cunt</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are a fucking joke<br>time to jump off a tall building</br></br>  <br>If you can't understand that they're setting you up for what's actually going on and have to take things at face value like that, I don't think this anime is for you.</br>  <br>ayy lamaes are a red herring.<br>I don't remember the dolphin thing.<br>That's related to the concept of the global subconscious, which is important when it comes to what Lain is.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand what a thematic is.

We are talking about art though (please don't start debating whether Lain is art), and art has more to offer than what the confines of hard science and reality have to allow. It seems a shame for you to dismiss something entirely, and ignore what it's trying to say to you, just because it's gone outside of those boundaries.</br></br></br>  <br>Whoa, mad genrepleb detected.</br>  Ok, I’m all good to post my conclusion as to what Lain is after 3 days of working through the 700 page PSX translation. Keep in mind I’ve not yet rewatched the anime, and am going by memories. I’ll probably revise this and repost it in the future after rewatching, but I’m eager to see what others think of this. Feel free to challenge it with stuff from the game or anime I might have overlooked. I think this game is very much necessary to really understand Lain. Let me know if any of you would be interested in all the notes/summaries/links I’ve gathered because I’d like to get discussion going, but if not a lot of people are interested/want to read through a shitload of stuff, I’ll save it for another day. I was going to post this later, but there seem to be a good amount of people in the thread. This is going to take up the next 4 posts, so bear with me.  <br> Lain is the natural force that connects humans based on common psychological needs (possibly what is referred to in the anime as the ‘collective consciousness’ – more of the force rather than the collective itself). She became sentient when Eiri experimented with Protocol 7, desiring to use this force to connect people without a medium. This is what he thinks he means when he "created" Lain (what other reason would there be for Eiri to create her if she didn’t have some sort of purpose?), but as the people on the wired say, she's been there since its inception, and as Lain herself says, she’s always connected to you. She's "connected" to everyone in the story and everyone who reads and watches this series because she is a fundamental "force" of nature. By the end of the anime she gains awareness of what she can do and uses it since Eiri has connected the force to the internet. Her problems throughout the PSX game are psychological in nature. The people she encounters like Touko that are having psychological issues are bombarded with hallucinations and an appearance of another self. Perhaps this has to do with contact with this sentient force, Lain. Why does Lain experience her own problems? Not really sure. But as a force of nature connected to psychological elements in regards to human social and psychological connective needs, her experiencing the opposite in order to gain awareness of her self makes sense sort of. One problem in particular seems to be the problem of identity. <br><br>continued</br></br></br>  <br> Identity and recognition of oneself as a single entity with many facets of a personality that also needs to "connect" with other people would be a normality, as would being alright with being unique, a theme that, with a reading of the game, seems very important. Lain doesn't have this as she manifests sentience into a girl who has a whole host of social and psychological problems. It's only when she realizes that she isn't an actual human (in the PSX game), that she discovers her role in connecting with everyone else on a more abstract level, and commits suicide to return to her natural form (she has her hallucinations of returning to “herself”) as the invisible force of nature. It would then seem that before the start of the anime, Tachibana Labs somehow makes her take sentience again and appoints her new dad to look after her as her previous parents did. Interestingly, for Lain to have achieved sentience in this theory, Eiri would have had to have done his experiments and died prior to the PSX game's setting (Eiri visits Lain in Nightmare of Fabrication, which takes place shortly after Touko says Misato doesn't exist in the time period of the game), meaning that the competing factions (Tachibana Labs, the Knights, and Eiri) looking to use Lain in the anime didn't act on the "big" plan of worldwide connection until the anime, probably because Lain killed herself before they could do anything before. However, if this is the case, why do the factions seem ok with her doing so in the anime after they start? Is it because once the wired and real world start coming together she's no longer needed as a sentient catalyst? Why do people commit suicide because of Lain? What does this accomplish? It can’t be the same as Lain’s if Lain’s is a natural thing based on a return to her place. <br><br>continued</br></br></br>  <br> I figure that post death, there is some metaphysical truth to where consciousness returns to an ultimate connection to all other beings. Lain’s influence then, for some reason, would be causing these people (who are having psychological “connection” issues) to desire to reconnect, thus, commit suicide and join the others (sort of an existential issue where people who are experiencing a psychological-social connection issue desire to more abstractly “connect” and fix their issues). The big difference in the game and anime seem to be that in the game, Lain accepts her place as this force of nature. In the anime however, she consistently challenges it, and is actually faced with the parties that are trying to use her. In the end, instead of killing herself and working with what Eiri and the Knights have done, she uses her “power” (achieved by becoming sentient) to erase her initial sentience from the world, meaning Tachibana and Eiri never turned her sentient and nobody was affected by her influence. In the end, she comes to grips with becoming a “ghost” of sorts that will watch over people, though, as we were shown in the ending, her presence is still there, and she can still affect things, it’s just that none of her existence remains in the records of the world other than in tiny tiny fragments like Alice thinking she’s seen her before, but shrugging it off. As for what this means for the future, who knows? Lain is still this force of nature (the electricity is flickering as I type this) and would seemingly still affect the world and people if she were to come in contact with them. Or since she has erased her initial birth of sentience, does this mean she can only voluntarily affect things? <br><br>continued</br></br></br>  <br>  I’m thinking that what is means to love Lain (emphasized repeatedly by the creative team and Lain herself in the game) is to love this natural human connection we need and have with other humans, to love Lain as a sentient being who is having problems that can be sympathized with (and identify with her and love her as a fellow sentient being with feelings and needs), and to love Lain for her will and bravery to become a spectator, despite becoming sentient and desiring the same connection that the rest of humanity does.  <br><br>This is the most complex series I’ve ever encountered, and I’m glad to have experienced it. I can post all my notes, summaries, and links about the game if people are interested, but like I said, it’s 25 Microsoft Word pages long (would probably take up more than twenty posts and would be a shitload of reading, and this is coming from a 700 page translated document of information).</br></br></br>  <br>But why does she wear a bear suit?</br>  <br>Security when doing things she's uncomfortable with.</br>  <br>qt</br>  <br>If you think anime Lain is cute, wait till you see the PSX Lain - she's way more expressive of her emotions</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Funnily enough, your theorizing here more or less matches up to what I had assumed was going on within the anime in the first place, even without knowledge of the game. It's quite nice to know that, even with your having read more source material, the facts of what are occurring remain consistent.<br><br>I think it's also important to note the gnostic symbolism going n here, with Lain being Sophia, Eiri being Ialdabaoth, the Knights being Archons, etc. Chiaki Konaka does a lot of parallels like that in his more esoteric works.<br><br>Fantastic job, in any case.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not too familiar with Gnostisicm, but that's an interesting idea to look for.<br><br>I’ll just post the PSX notes since we don’t have good Lain threads very often anyway. It’d be cool to start discussion for once, but I’m not expecting much They're not detailed, but highlight what I thought were important themes, passages, or events. I think you can get a general idea of what's going on, but I recommend reading it for yourself, also because as you read through, you notice how parts of Lain's diary, etc. correspond to specific events like counseling. The images I post are screencaps I took of interesting passages, some both in the screencaps and the notes, though the screencaps are worth looking at too for different stuff. You can find the 700 page PDF translation here: http://psx.lain.pl/</br></br></br>  <br>Some general notes and ideas:<br><br>- PSX Lain is fucking adorable<br><br>- This game was being worked on prior to the anime, but was released afterward<br><br>- Lain's given last name in this period is still Iwakura<br><br>- Lain in this period is an only child<br><br>- Lain's parents want her to continue counseling. If they are appointed by Tachibana or another party, this is possibly so she learns to suppress her hallucinations and doesn't commit suicide and stays as a sentient being.<br><br>- Lain consistently blames herself<br><br>- Lain might have some belief in a God - she asks for God to guide her dad home safely<br><br>- Lain's diary is bipolar at times. Things upset her and drag her down a lot to where she uses very strong negative language and thoughts, and then one thing will happen and she'll be motivated again. Ueda has stated that Lain addressed Japanese issues that Western audiences wouldn't understand - I get the feeling the troubled societal issues Lain is going through in her mind have to do with this. These resonate in the West as well, and Ueda (I think) said he was surprised at how equal the interpretations from Japan and Western audiences were.<br><br>- Lain shows many emotions, very unlike the anime which makes her out to be way less expressive - she shows happiness, disgust, fun, etc. when talking to Touko and even jokes around. Despite this, her diary expresses classic social awkwardness and introversion.<br><br>- Lain is 12 at this time, so it (seemingly) takes place before the anime. She's been having her problems for a little over a year now.<br><br>- Lain wants us to love her and to know her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with challenging yourself? If you only ever consume media that you're comfortable with, there is little room for growth.</br>  Are we sure that the anime and game are set in the same timeline?  <br>First are audio recordings of Counseling sessions between Lain and a young counselor named Touko.<br><br>Lain comes to psychologist Touko once a month for her problems.<br><br>Lain is apparently initially very anxious, so much so that Touko keeps repeating "you don't have to worry"<br><br>She apologizes for little things, such as not liking the tea Touko has prepared<br><br>Lain asks Touko if there are different kinds of people like there are teas, and is told to be proud of uniqueness.<br><br>Lain describes that she has weird dreams<br><br>Lain says to Touko that she's "not especially" looking forward to Summer vacation<br><br>Touko prepares "games" for their sessions, but Lain would rather talk<br><br>She wants to know more about Touko's life and profession<br><br>She says that her school life is normal - she has friends, but they're often busy<br><br>She notes that she would rather stay home and do things than go out<br><br>She tells Touko that she likes to talk to her stuffed animals - she is embarassed about this, but Touko says its normal<br><br>She doesn't really like study<br><br>She likes exercise, but doesn't like PE class<br><br>She refuses to go into detail about other things she doesn't like<br><br>Touko brings in a Rorschach test - Lain thinks it's boring - she has seen them at another institution she's been to<br><br>She sees in the blot a person's face that looks a little angry (I don't think this is too important - just a detail)<br><br>Lain doesn't like getting wet because she feels like she's being touched all over<br><br>Lain thinks that she is weird, and that a previous "test" at another place confirmed it - she wants to be "cured"<br><br>Touko notes that a previous institution's exams failed to find any problems with her<br><br>She has nightmares, feels like people are touching her when nobody's around, and sees things - she explicitly says she thinks she has schizophrenic symptoms<br><br><br>Lain is younger, and after ~3 years in the game  commits suicide . It would seem it takes place before based on what's going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  After reading all that, I just want to express how beautiful I think it is that people once thought of the Internet that way, and how frustrating it is that there are people and interest groups out there trying to remove that kind of thinking entirely with their Internet policing bullshit. Sage because I don't want this to turn into a Snowden thread or something like that.  <br>Every thread for eternity.</br>  <br><br>Touko stresses that it's important not to self-diagnose<br><br>Lain hears multiple voices talking to her from electric lines and sometimes just from the sky<br><br>She experiences Sleep Paralysis and accompanying Out of Body Experiences<br><br>She says the scariest parts of her nightmares are when she feels like she isn't needed and doesn't need herself - she feels like she is being told to "go back to herself" because she isn't needed<br><br>"For a person like me to be me, and to touch my body, feels like I'm being torn"<br><br>Lain is told to keep a diary<br><br>Touko tells Lain to face her dreams.

Lain leaves the session.<br><br>All is eventually forgiven<br><br>Lain makes cookies for Touko for her birthday<br><br>Lain reveals that she's lied about her eyesight in order to appear average like her classmates - her true eyesight is above average<br><br>Lain has begun studying mental illness, and frequently brings up topics for discussion/explanation by Touko<br><br>Touko explains that Lain's delusions are not characteristic of schizophrenics, who tend to have them based on themselves (people yelling at them or talking to them specifically). In contrast, Lain senses things - Touko wonders if she thinks she's sensing electric information traveling around her.<br><br>Touko thinks Lain is a hypochondriac because she has poor self esteem<br><br>Touko tells Lain that she pays too much attention to the things around her<br><br>Lain thinks that she is both herself and not herself, but it's not that she thinks she should be someone different, like a child's delusion of thinking she should be a rich princess - Lain is comfortable with who she is<br><br>Lain specifically states that she is not suicidal<br><br>She insists on learning more about Touko's work<br><br>Her problems appear to have gone away - she is no longer seeing things</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is very interested in psychology, which is not boring like the "games"<br><br>Touko talks about the difference between haphazarad and fragile subjective human memory and physical, perfect, written down records<br><br>"As humans, there are some things that we can't do anything about"<br><br>Lain feels that her memories are not her memories<br><br>Touko when talking about not understanding why she likes Lain so much: "It is enough for me to be able to understand my feelings. I can never know that you like me as much as I like you"<br><br>This continues with discussion about separate identities and about humans not being able to truly get inside another's most fundamental self or even their own in some ways<br><br>Identities are permanent and unique<br><br>Lain talks about her best friend Misato<br><br>Lain asks if Deja-vu is normal - says she has trouble interpreting time when it happens, and that she sees herself sometimes as if she's watching herself on TV (Note that Lain says previously that despite her identity conflicts, she still believes that she is herself)<br><br>Back to the permanent fundamental self - Touko says that Ego is a fixed self that exists as the identity you use to recognize yourself as existing and to recognize that your memories are your own<br><br>Lain asks about Touko using medicine to cure people and Touko responds that Lain has the power to recover from her "diseases" without medicine, which is why they are talking<br><br>Touko talks about how the brain can be damaged and how that can give way to mental illness<br><br>Touko tells Lain that she talked with one of her friends, who says that Misato, Lain's best friend, doesn't exist.

She also will sometimes see herself as alone when she thinks others should be around. At the end of her dreams she says she is forced to watch a video upon being forced into awakening (?) - I'm guessing she means this is a hallucination while she is not fully awake.<br><br>Lain has a flat affect, but is normal when happy or smiling, etc.. She is calm and reserved and sometimes gets tongue-tied, but communication, clarity in thought, emotional expression, question answering, and atterntion span are all normal. She only hesitates when asked about her symptoms.<br><br>Lain has a high level artistic sensibility, and can paint well. She is clever and relaxed. Everything Touko and think of at this point is normal other than her delusions. She is surprised at how good her eyesight is. She is physically normal as well.<br><br>Touko writes that Lain has few friends and uses her stuffed animals to deal with loneliness.<br><br>Touko writes that Lain's differentiation between exercise and PE and dislike for PE may have to do with low self confidence.<br><br>Lain's light reflexes were tested at another hospital and Touko thinks she might have Adie's syndrome. She notes Lain's paranoia and active hallucinations to be a possible indicator of onset general paralysis, but states it is very unlikely.<br><br>Touko desires permission to take cerebrospinal fluid samples from Lain.<br><br>Touko believes Lain might develop a complex in thinking her perception is more unique than others. She believes Lain may suffer from depersonalization neurosis.<br><br>Touko notes Lain's interest in her profession specifically.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It would seem it takes place before based on what's going on. <br>But there's no hard evidence? Like some events from the game being mentioned in the anime?<br><br>If there's not I don't think it makes sense to try to create a chronology that includes both. They can be separate alternate versions of Lain's story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You would be right if it wasn't for the fact that same guy who tries this, is now complaining about the fact that he doesn't understand it instead of seeing the anime through to the end and then maybe, research it by looking it up on the web and finding answers to his questions.</br>  <br>Based on their discussion of Lain's hairstyle, Touko thinks it's a good luck charm that Lain wears to alleviate her hallucinations.<br><br>Touko is growing weary of Lain's "probing" questions about her profession.<br><br>Touko notes that Lain can't accept today the memories of herself in the past, and thinks she might have an identity disorder.<br><br>Touko notes that Lain's friendship with Misato is helping, and wants to discontinue examinations after a few more months.<br><br>"She won't stop pressing me with questions"<br><br>Touko notes Lain's "excessive underestimation of herself" and her "objecifying the adoration for her "other" self”. The past and present Lains are different for her.<br><br>Touko thinks of Lain as a normal girl now, and would like to discontinue sessions with her to move on to another client so she can continue her paper. The professor who dies is the person she reports to.<br><br>Her request hasn't been answered and she asks about it again.<br><br>Prepares final reports for Lain. Thinks her professor is harassing her because he will not respond to her request to switch clients. She is worried that she won't have time to finish her paper before her academic conference and needs another client to work with.<br><br>Professor seems to die here - Touko asks who to send her report in to before a new lab head is appointed. She is appointed a new client.<br><br>Touko questions Lain's friends, finds out Misato isn't real, and requests to resume work with Lain as a result.<br><br>Notes Lain has taken a rebellious stance toward her opinions and that her speech is "remarkably lacking in logicality" - states it's like that of a schizophrenic. She guesses Lain suffers from depersonalization neurosis, light personality disorder, and possible paranoid schizophrenia.<br><br>Touko wants someone else to take over, but would still like to assist as a third party in the future.<br><br>Touko notes that Lain withdrew like a patient with autism after she denied Misato's existence.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not too familiar with Gnostisicm, but that's an interesting idea to look for. <br><br>Yeah, Lain has a ton of gnostic subtext in the same way Texhnolyze, its brother series, has a ton of Buddhist subtext (don't read this if you haven't watched Texhnolyze:  what with the Shapes being Preta, the surface being the Pure Land, etc. ). Hell, Kano in that series is basically the demiurge even more blatantly than Eiri is.<br><br>But the important topic here is Lain. The core factor to make note of in Lain's gnostic undertones is how the Wired plays into reality. In Gnosticism, the essential nature of the universe is an illusion that is decided by the consensus of all human perception, and the essential task of humanity is to both demonstrate love and compassion and strive to escape from materialism. Gnosis is a specialized form of experiential knowledge that comes to a human being when they recognize the universe as being fundamentally similar to a dream, hologram, or illusion.<br><br>The Wired is a consensual hallucination. We all agree (more or less) to share (more or less) the hallucination that is the Wired. Meaning, how much each person agrees to hallucinate the Wired will vary, and furthermore, each person's hallucination will vary (more or less) from the statistical average "consensus Wired." Reality too, in many ways, is a consensual hallucination, just like the Wired.<br><br>Eiri Masami designed Protocol 7 to utilize Schumann Resonance to connect everybody to the Wired (and therefore each other) without devices. The protocol that fully links the Wired and reality together. A protocol is a set of rules or procedures that people agree to use, therefore protocol implies consent, an agreement to believe in something and use it.<br><br>So there's a lot to dig up regarding that connection and the ideas Konaka derived from it.<br><br> http://psx.lain.pl/ <br><br>That's fucking amazing, man. Thank you!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Notes Lain no longer thinks she is sick. Wants someone else to take over and suggests medication.<br><br>Notes Lain acts alright so long as Misato is not mentioned. Is very bothered about her personal questions, but "somehow" wants to have an "intimate relationship" with her again.<br><br>Notes that Lain has changed into a different person and can't understand what Lain remarks to her. "Can't take it anymore" and wants someone else to take charge of her case.<br><br>New client now, Touko and Lain begin talking about her together at the same time<br><br>Touko and Lain say the patient has reconnected herself with reality and has recovered from "ego disturbance" (although several other problems were mentioned previously as the client deteriorated). After this, Lain says "Thank you, my valuable client."<br><br>End of Diagnoses</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ekm<br><br>Conversations between Lain and Kyoko<br><br>Kyoko wants to go buy lipstick with Lain. Lain says she'll get scolded by the teacher again and Kyoko calls her stiff. She suggests Lain use it too and Lain says she doesn't have a need for it. Kyoko says she should up her confidence and try it because she'll look cute.<br><br>When asked what she does to kill time, Lain responds "cleaning...?"<br><br>Lain says she has lots of unnecessary things lying around her room.<br><br>Kyoko asks if Lain thinks she's special. She comments that everyone says Lain isn't normal and think she's dangerous, but that she tells them that Lain is normal. Kyoko longs to be special like other people. Lain says she's fine with being ordinary.<br><br>Kyoko is depressed because a boy she liked only likes quiet short haired girls. She says she wishes she was like Lain and Lain says that Kyoko is far cuter and more popular. Kyoko says those things are useless if the boy doesn't like them.<br><br>End of Ekm</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Env<br><br>Static and random voices - extra content not used in the game<br><br>"Say, do you like me? If you do, come to my URL site"<br><br>"But I can only see him. Lain...die."<br><br>A girl complains about a test and says that if she knew the world were ending, she'd just forget studying and do whatever she wanted<br><br>A man asks someone to fight with him as a chosen fighter, saying his willpower is the only thing that can change the world<br><br>A man says that a woman is a clone of him that he grew from his tissue. He says she probably noticed and laments that if they knew this about each other "the world would be..."<br><br>A man says he ceased to exist again. He was sure it was him that woke up, but something fell away. When he took the sheets off, he noticed a sea of blood everywhere, and that something was written on his computer.<br><br>A girl talks to Lain and says that she thought she was terrible, but the boy she likes likes Lain instead. She then says that Lain doesn't care whether he likes her or not.<br><br>A man addresses a bunch of people calling them a clump that doesn't exist. He says he eats the flesh of humans. He says that everyone who mocks him is stupid, and then says that their construction is nearly complete and that he wants to laugh. He then asks if someone entered the room.<br><br>A few of the above are saying their lines on top of each other. <br>Notable is that the translator here says that the girl saying "But I can only see him. Lain." is Touko.<br><br>End of Env</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Let's all love Lain  <br>Research_Ky and _Ka<br><br>Conversations between Touko and Kyoko and Kaori<br><br>Touko posing as a private tutor says she worries her distraction might be wearing off on Lain in order to get Kyoko to tell her about how she is.<br><br>Kyoko says that Lain hasn't talked to her much since they got into to Junior High.<br><br>Kyoko says that Lain used to be somber, and that she has become more somber lately.<br><br>Kyoko says Lain was like a sister to her, and comments on her introverted nature.<br><br>Kyoko says that Lain only began to seem somber about a year ago<br><br>Kyoko thinks they talked recently, but can't remember anything.<br><br>Kyoko comments that Lain asked a Biology teacher about how the brain works, and about how to recollect memories.<br><br>Kyoko says Lain is hard to approach. She says that most everyone is indifferent to her now. She longs for her old laugh and smile to come back. She says that when she was together with Lain, she'd always laugh.<br><br>Kyoko says that there is nobody named Misato in their class.<br><br>Kyoko says Lain would be attractive and popular if she'd lighten up. <br>She says that all of Lain's grades are perfect. <br><br>Kaori(?) (translation says "Girl" and that "Kaori couldn't understand" how Lain got such a good grade on a difficult subject - I'll just say Kaori for now though based on what Touko said) says that Lain doesn't like to hang out when asked. <br><br>Kaori says Lain skipped PE and that either Kyoko or another girl said Lain was weak physically. <br><br>Despite her being an only child, Kaori says that her mom says Lain's sibling is in the hospital, and that the neighbors avoid her house.<br><br>End of Research_Ky and _Ka</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I should note that everything in the game is presented out of order, and that it's up to the reader to connect everything.

I get she's the colective unconsciousness and is able to to affect people minds without devices through Earth's magnetic field and brain electric pulses. But how can she affect non-subjective reality, like reviving people or moving objects? It could all be a matrix-like illusion, but the series states that it isn't. My only guess is that Lain reaches beyond the collective unconsciousness, being pervasive throughout the universe itself: she can affect reality by meddling with very electrical particles of all matter, not just humans or machines. In this sense Lain is a literal godess, given human nature by a scientist who mistook her for something else.  <br>Lain's Diary - this is huge<br><br>Warning, this is a real tearjearker<br><br>Lain feels ashamed to go out in public with makeup like Kyoko because she doesn't feel "cute"<br><br>Lain has trouble understanding what she researches when she gets interesting in Touko's profession. "Am I stupid?"<br><br>She thinks she says strange things sometimes, and is afraid to talk about her problem with Kyoko or other people because she thinks they'll say she's weird.<br><br>Lain says she's depressed and wants to cry. She asks if it's her fault that kids say mean things to her (Kyoko and Lain’s mother both said Lain did NOT get bullied) and wonders specifically if a boy (Tomo) was laughing at her too. <br>She's afraid making a fuss about people saying mean things will make her more disliked.<br><br>Lain asks if she's ok being herself<br><br>Lain is very happy that she's stopped seeing hallucinations<br><br>Lain's dad buys her a computer. She's upset that online classes she'll take when she misses school will be her alone.<br><br>Lain has paranoid delusions about Kyoko being happier without her, and she takes her not talking to her as much very seriously. she then says she doesn't want to go to school anymore, but will get scolded if she doesn't. She doesn't like people being mad at her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Touko when talking about not understanding why she likes Lain so much: "It is enough for me to be able to understand my feelings. I can never know that you like me as much as I like you" <br><br>As a psychologist, given what Lain is, isn't it simply natural that she'd like Lain a lot? Seems quite natural.</br></br></br>  <br>Lain is sick. She stays home from school and thinks her classmates probably just think she's skipping. She says they don't like her.<br><br>She's very pleased when Kyoko and Mayu visit her because that means she "wasn't disliked". She then expresses that she can't wait to go back to school so she can hang out with them.<br><br>She's sick for longer.

She is happy that her face isn't seen and she is not embarrassed. People are kind to her online even though she has problems. She's says she becomes a different her online.<br><br>Lain is interested in computer science and pursues programming.<br><br>Lain doesn't like competitive games because people might get upset at her for doing well, so she prefers games everyone can enjoy together.<br><br>Lain wonders what other people think about her.<br><br><br>iirc I noted that because of Touko's emphasis on human feelings and how one can't get inside of another's head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lain is sad because her dad is leaving for 2 months for work overseas<br><br>Lain enjoys "playing detective" and tracking down the host site of an email that sends her an encoded picture of a dead baby for revenge. <br>She mentions setting a trap with an encoded email, and gets the guy's information and spreads it out publicly.<br><br>Lain reveals her diary has been put online, meaning she had been recording it on the computer. She said before that she was happy doing things others couldn't, but is disillusioned that others can do them too.

This is strange seeing as she's imaginary.<br><br>Another strange thing - Lain says a boy asked Misato out but she refused - is she talking about herself?<br><br>Misato gives Lain a CD of her playing violin<br><br>Lain's family interacts with Misato and her parent<br><br>Lain ends up not wanting to see Touko anymore, saying she isn't troubled.

It'd hard for me to believe she exists beyond Earth's Schumann Resonance.<br><br> how can she affect non-subjective reality <br><br>The same way the KIDS project did, except on a grand, world-wide scale.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lain now feels like she could talk to somebody for a long time on the phone, but wonders if she's a talkative person.<br><br>Lain gets back on the net and decides to try and find a news group to join that has similar interests to her.<br><br>Misato is moving to another school - she moved without saying a thing to Lain<br><br>Lain wants to quit counseling but her mom won't let her.

Her dad disappears.<br><br>Lain's mom starts driving her to Touko. Lain says it's like she's guarding her and doesn't like it.<br><br>Lain submits to the thought that she's crazy and doesn't care what <br>Touko thinks, nor does she remember anything they've talked about.<br><br>Lain notices she looks nothing like her mother and wonders if she's someone else's kid.<br><br>Lain wants to find the image of the real her online<br><br>Lain's dad divorces her mom. She think's it's her fault.<br><br>Lain's mom stops speaking. Lain wants to see and hug her dad again.<br><br>Lain's mom gets drunk and throws a vase at her.

She specifically says this, and that she will ask somebody who is a friend of Tachibana, a researcher.<br><br>Lain finds an empty house nearby to house her artificial dad.<br><br>Lain says that the only part of her that acknowledges her existence is living in her small body. She says she doesn't have an individual personality and that she doesn't leave much of an impression. She feels her own body is lame, and wonders if she'd be her if she had thought rerouting. She says she doesn't need a connection to reality anymore, and that it isn't important to know that she's a human that will die.<br><br>Someone on the internet has been able to access her dad.<br><br>Lain sees a hallucination of herself. She says she can't handle this on her own, and wants to go see Touko.<br><br>Lain notices that Touko is acting very confused whenever Lain brings up her medical condition.

She wonders who will pass judgment on her on the net. She doesn't need her body anymore.<br><br>Lain asks the people who want to know her why they want to know her. <br>Is it for research or a stupid TV show, she asks.<br><br>Lain thinks people think she had a sad existence. She doesn't mind. <br>She kills her online self because she doesn't need a backup. She asks if it hurt.<br><br>Lain wonders if she feels fear only because of what's recorded in her genes. She says she doesn't need those kinds of genes.<br><br>"Do you know where I'm going? I don't know either. That's because I'm going to be born soon. Will I become a more evolved human being? If I think so I might as well think so. A human without a body isn't human? There are people who have bodies that aren't human. Is that me? I'm not human? Lain is Lain. What is it to be human? You're human if you have a body? I'm me. Am I just conglomerated with my body? I need a body if I'm going to live in the real world. Suicide would be stupid. It would be better to just die. I don't need it. I might need it someday. That might be true. I won't need a body to live in the wired. I'll need the recollections of the body. How about the recollections of a body that grows older? My point of view may change? Is there a need for it to change? There's no guarantee that that will be you. Lain, what do I need to be on the wired? Existence and will. The rest is just data."<br><br>End of Lain's Diary - 2 more screencaps after this one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Every case seems to be an example of her leaving behind the constraints of her fleshly vessel to embody her true nature as a thoughtform.</br></br>    <br>Talk files - these are random sentences spoken by, first, Lain, then Touko<br><br>Random sentences from Lain:<br><br>Lain doesn't want to be alone<br><br>"What is it that you dislike?"<br><br>"It's fun to be alive, isn't it?"<br><br>"Look at me"<br><br>"I won't let you be alone"<br><br>"You are different from other people......so what?"<br><br>"I want to be tender to you"<br><br>"Come near me.

His motivation for "evil" can be seen through the scope of his lense/or a heros.<br>But Garou is a great villain because of his insecurities of him secretly wanting to be a hero. He's really just pissy because life didn't turn out the way he wanted it to. And those are dangerous types of people, anon.

I wore my retained for only a couple of months, it's been a year now and my teeth have been fine. <br><br>Problem is though, if I want to put my retainer back on the pain would be intense.

I think I'm currently supposed to wear them at night only, but my shit ortho hasn't instructed me to so I still wear them 24/7. Wait until your ortho tells you to wear them at night and then do so. Problem with me is that from wearing them so much, they get loose and out of shape, which is what I'm dealing with. Follow your ortho's instruction.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Knocked her up.</br>  I mean, I do remember you douchebags from my dreams, it's just that my dreams are never particularly coherent and all involve the same basic themes, which are being chased around empty buildings or forgetting to turn in assignments at school, etc. You know, kind of like the same sorts of dreams everybody in the world has sometimes. The only thing that's different for me is that my dreams tend to be nightmares more often than not  <br> You will regret it so fucking much in the future, even if you have a healthy diet. <br>That is, if you don't take care of them, I should say.</br></br>  <br>Yes, if my sister was Bee-Chan</br>  My sister is 3DPD, so no.

He's one of us, at least he was</br>  <br>Alternatively he was a masterful storyteller to an insane degree.<br><br>Either way I hope he's doing well.</br></br></br>      Sometimes I fantasize about brushing Hitler's teeth.  They will never be this pure.  <br>let me guess, 404 after last post?</br>  <br>He possibly walked the dinosaur next morning.</br>  <br>He went on a little bit more, but not too much.</br>  <br>He better. he has to do it, for all of us who will never know that feeling.</br>  <br>You can do it in the new Fire Emblem. That kinda counts.</br>  I think if the imouto is sheltered and has a long enough relationship with role model onii-chan, I dont think its impossible for such feelings to generate. I think its public school that fucks it all up.  <br>Erika and Ephraims coupling in SS was obviously incest end.</br>  <br>But the new one has a crazy  step   onee-chan voiced by Sawashiro that wants nothing more than your love.</br>  <br>NBR doesnt really beat twincest though.</br>  <br> step <br><br>No thanks</br></br></br>  <br><br> this garbage gets endless daily threads and infinite normalfags circlejerking </br></br>  <br> incest threads <br> normalfag circlejerk </br></br>  <br> pure imouto scent marking anons room <br> I DUN GET IT </br></br>    My sister has been teasing me a lot lately, I really should brush her tits so she stops that shit.  <br>Teeth* fuck.</br>   2015年 物語シリーズ ファイナルシーズン『終物語』（コンテ） <br>Animator Kazui Hiroko reveals that it airs in 2015.<br><br>http://kazuihiroko.jp/history.html</br></br></br>  <br>no wonder you don't know, shitposter namefag</br>  <br>Ougi shouldn't have boobs</br>  <br>Maybe she just hide them.</br>  <br>well thats because its water it cant really know that.<br><br>Fish can swim on land yet it does not know why, probably because it lack the cortex to think so-earth shattering news</br></br></br>  <br><br>You still here?</br></br>   shit hair color <br> annoying voice <br> no tits and no ass <br> massive unlikable cunt <br>Is she objectively the worst girl of all time?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like how Vegeta was clearly in love with Goku but was just tsun as fuck, right?</br>  <br>Not him but that sounds about right to me.</br>  <br>Naga wasn't as clingy as Vegeta though.</br>  Definitely Naga's sister.  <br> best hair color <br> sexy voice <br> perfect tits and perfect ass <br> massive likable cute <br>Is she objectively the best girl of all time?<br><br><br>Fixed it for ya.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is creayus the most dedicated and loyal artist?  <br>Nah Eva is different she's a xxx year old virgin in love with her students father who infact doesn't know what love is. And now getting swayed by a Clone of said student</br>  <br><br>Not him, but I think you should be aware of what they actually did or did not say before saying such a thing. For instance, the director (singular, not plural) hasn't said anything to the contrary. In fact, I think something he has worked on kind of helps the case, but since you're in such a mood I don't feel like explaining it here.</br></br>  <br>It's funny how salty Kallen was when fighting CC at the end. Also, I don't think she shaved it because she shows up later in the episode with her normal length hair.</br>  <br>Dude died a fucking virgin, man.<br><br>He had sex with CC. <br><br><br>They never had sex.<br>In the interviews, CC never loved Lelouch as a woman loves a man. Lelouch never even thought of her as a mother and never did love her. They were equals, true equals, not some petty relationship that needed sex to become fulfilled. <br>Besides, the staff said Lelouch died a virgin and that neither Lelouch nor CC loved each other as lovers.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering she was more "salty" than actually mad though. If Kallen was really angry at C.C. she would have used the claw, but didn't.</br>   Ctrl+f <br> No sad panda <br><br>Let's fix that</br></br></br>  <br>Care to share some examples, friend?</br>  <br> forbidden content <br> still not in my folders <br>Well, time to get this then.<br><br><br>More than 20 million GPs.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Short girl being dominated<br>http://exhentai.org/g/828168/c7ee36<wbr>2cf3/<br><br>Or a little boy being dominated?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/827911/9e34c9<wbr>4c3d/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br>To be honest there are too many I like to say I have a favorite.<br><br>Redrop and UDON-YA are some good ones that I have actually remember the name.</br></br></br>  <br>I just finished reading this minutes ago</br>  shaa~  <br>Real(best) friends know WHEN to hold back and WHEN to rip you a new one.</br>  <br>I hide a skeleton from my friends.<br>They don't need to know, it can only cause harm.<br>One does not have a duty to reveal everything just because you're friends.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck<br>Well I guess ill have to forget about this show for a year again<br>Gl in life anons</br></br></br>  <br> So they're not friends at all? <br>They're all bothered about the situation at least so they're on the right track</br></br>  <br><br>Well to be truthful, most people keep at least a little bit to themselves.
