It's okay.<br>But I have question. Will MC have more based moments?</br></br>    <br>The days ago when Charlotte debuted. This has had like twice as many posts at least, though.</br>  <br>He will be a huge Beta but the girls will get better every episode. Specially Mia will get funnier and Cerea will also be great.</br>  <br>I love you, tentacle witch!</br>  <br>Horsefucker</br>  <br>On a scale of 1 to Orgasm how did you guys enjoy this episode?</br>   Darling <br> beta </br>     you'll never know the joys of horse pussy    You will never have a centaur daughteru   <br>~1.25 hours of light edging with some breaks included</br>  <br>That makes me sad</br>  <br>Thank God, that would mean I'd be a pony fucker.</br>  <br>Someone doesn't browse enough</br>  <br> Projected episodes:(At the rate of 2 issues per episode) <br><br> Episode 2: Papi and Cerea introduced <br> Episode 3: Bath time with the girls and FULL MOON <br> Episode 4: Miia's deadly cooking and snake peeling followed by Cerea brushing down in the bath and Suu's arrival. <br> Episode 5: Suu carried off by Papi scared for her being deported, with Darling running off after Papi. Then trying to hide Suu from Smith and all the girls getting molested for the first time then her being accepted into the harem and the remodeling of the house for the first time <br> Episode 6: Orc Thug Episode and M.O.N introduction. Then Mero's introduction and moving in <br> Episode 7: Darling sick episode with all the girls taking care of him. Then Papi's laying her egg and asshole who is using Rachnera for silk trying to exploit Darling's girls like the shedding leavings from Miia. Ends with Rachnera sneakpeak <br> Episode 8: Rachnera's introduction. Rachnera kidnaps Darling then Darling gets 'rescued' and then Rachnera joins the Harem. Then Rachnera trying to fuck Darling and trap him in various ways with Cerea protective and carrying Darling away only to get in trouble and have Rachnera help her out. Friendship, and bondage, begin. <br> Episode 9: Polt's introduction.

Plus Rachnera trying to take a bath with the girls and getting molested by Suu for the first time. D Letter Finale with Date with the M.O.N. <br> Episode 12: Lala's introduction and inclusion into the Harem. <br><br> This, of course, precludes any 'extended scenes' or 'original content'. But if they stay on the same pattern for the next 12 episodes, they'll end with Lala. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Silly anon, fucking ponies doesn't get you daughterus.<br><br> Now, if you could find one with hands to hold, that would be a different story. </br></br></br>  <br>Did that happen in the manga or was that just added? I don't recall.</br>  <br>I wish they didn't put the introduction of Papi and Cerea in the same episode, even if it means we have to deal with filler.<br><br>Miia's orgasm inducing tail-tip is from the manga.</br></br></br>  <br> finally after all the foreplay you get ready to put your dick into her Lamia vagina <br> as you slowly enter her tight vagina she makes a slight rattling sound followed by drool dripping from her mouth <br> using her lower snake like body she puts pressure on her vagina making it tighter and tighter as you keep plowing her <br> as blood soaks past your dick you can see pain and incredible enjoyment in Miia's eyes <br> d~darling.... its ok, plow me as hard as you want, I am a pet under your complete obedience </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> a pony is the same as centaur <br><br>- you</br></br></br>  Is manga more lewder than anime?  <br>Okay, I thought they just added it in.<br><br> yfw the peeling scene is coming soon </br></br></br>  <br>Yes and no. The anime has lewd sounds, the manga has exposed nipples.</br>  <br> plow </br>    <br>It is. You're having sex with a horse vagina. You can't even grab the tits when sex happens cause you're fucking a horse vagina. I hope cerea isn't popular. I donly know the results of that one poll.</br>  Which Monsume would actually be a good wife?  Were are the nipples? I watched 3 new shows today with ecchi content and none of them had nipples.  <br>Okusama ga Seito Kaichou have nipples.</br>  <br>That picture</br>  <br><br>Conflicting responses.</br></br>  <br>But it isn't. You do understand that a pony is one thing and a centaur is another. That's like saying a Werewolf is a badger. It doesn't make sense.</br>  <br>I'm reserving judgment until after the girl who lives off pussy juice is introduced.</br>  <br> Smith looking like black haired Rider in a business suit <br> Dat Yuu Kobayashi VA <br> Dat ED <br>Fuck diamonds, my dick is 15 on the mohs scale</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do you ask questions that you know the answer to?</br>  <br>well the synopsis sounds interesting</br>  <br><br> pet under your complete obedience </br></br>  <br>Obviously</br>  <br>Horse vagina's don't have nipples.</br>  <br> snake carton </br>  <br>In the entire manga it's<br><br>Yuki-Onna&gt;Manako&gt;Mea</br></br></br>  <br>Suu.<br>She's a living trashcan, and can heal pretty much anything. And I wonder how great she feels.</br></br>  <br><br>Sorry, I'll do better next time.</br></br>  <br>Moar best waifu</br>  <br> mea <br>It's Miia.</br></br>    <br>Probably like sticking your dick in jello</br>  <br> Wanting to have sex with trash </br>  <br>More like Meh<br>Amirite?</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Guh damn</br>  <br>There are horsefuckers in this thread. Trash can is a lot more acceptable.</br>  God damn I have been waiting for this for so long. It is finally here my brothers! Let us rejoice!  <br><br> having sex with a household appliance </br></br>  Remember: if you ever end up with a Lamia, give her all the eggs.  <br> not wanting to have sex with trash </br>  <br>There are people so jalous of Cerea that they would rather have trash. I can get you like a girl more but jesus christ man.</br>  <br>No you are not right.</br>  <br> Implying you wouldn't fuck your computer if you could. </br>  <br>It's okay, Suu still loves you.</br>  May i remind you all that Cerea is the only Mammal with Fish slut. Thus she have the best chance at getting master.  I want to wander into a Lamia village.   You will never work beside your Centaur Waifu at Medieval Times <br> You will never display in beautiful armor with her before the screaming crowd <br> You will never participate in jousting competitions on her back, helping her steady the lance. <br> You will never act out an injury from the 'evil knight' that enrages your waifu <br> You will never have her avenge you by crushing the Evil Knight and winning the tournament <br> You will never unite in the winner's circle and share a passionate, loving kiss then raise your arms in victory and bow to the crowd. <br> You will never ride off with your centaur wife, both sweaty and content... and she will never fully indicate she is going to be the one riding you once she gets you alone with how turned on she was from the show <br><br>God, I want this so bad.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No anon, don't! It's a wretched hive!</br>  <br>Of Rape and Lewdness</br>  Have not read or watched anything, just tell me who the lewdest girl is.  <br>I see what you did there</br>   BtB Monster Musume <br> edition <br>Fucking stop this.<br>Do you want it to become the new Yahari Threads</br></br></br>  <br>Reminder.</br>  <br>Why are you doing this.</br>  I WANT TO FEED CARROTS TO CEREA!  <br>i think the board you were looking for was <br><br>surprised actually it still exists</br></br></br>  <br>Should have gone for this</br>  So, when do the first blu-ray come out? I want my damn uncensored episodes.  https://d.maxfile.ro/luxbzlkhdc.web<wbr>m <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/afivjaxuni.web<wbr>m <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/vmwqlcdvxm.web<wbr>m <br><br>Important webms from the episode  and lewd pic </br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr>  <br> lewdest <br>Miia's mother.</br></br>  <br>   You will never be forced to stand there while a burly male centaur mounts her. </br>  <br>Because I can.</br>  <br> tumblr nose </br>  <br> "just tell me who the lewdest girl is." <br>It's easier to answer who isn't lewd. Pretty much most of the main girls are full lewd.<br>Just go and choose which one you like the most. Personally I'd love Suu (slime) or Rachnee (spider who's into bondage)<br>Oh, I didn't remember </br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Kimihito raped Cerea.  <br>Rachnera is up there. The whole shibari thing is pretty damn lewd.<br><br>But really, the lewdist is Suu.<br><br>She is the one who goorapes and molests the other girls periodically. If you get wet or covered in tasty things like splashed... whatever. She is going to molest and violate and bring to orgasm</br></br></br></br></br>  Fucking Ryuuji.  This show was cute. Too bad it looks like it will turn into shitty monster girl harem instead of cute monster girl romance.    <br>Suu is probably the best. Has an actual humanoid form, rather than half human half monster shit, can change her form to whatever your dick desires, and you won't need lube.</br>  <br><br> falling for your rapist <br><br>sasuga cerea</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kimihito <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>Anon has a point, the vagina is on the horse part so you would be fucking a horse vagina - albeit it the horse part of a centaur.<br><br> Also her vagina is probably only fit for male centaur use. She probably won't even feel your human apparatus. Like a hotdog through a tunnel </br></br></br>  Rachnee best girl  <br>What a lech.<br><br>Centaur women like human males well enough.</br></br></br>  <br> Kimihito <br>It took me a good while to figure out who you were talking about. How do you even remember his name? It hasn't been mentioned since like, the first issue of the manga.</br></br>  <br>I just watched the episode yesterday, how could I not remember it?</br>  <br> Centaur women like human males well enough. <br><br>Whatever helps you sleep at night friend :^)</br></br></br>  <br><br>truly</br></br>  <br>Not all of the girls are cockcravers</br>  <br><br>Spidermind.</br></br>  <br>Jesus christ read the fucking manga</br>  <br> Whatever helps you sleep at night friend :^) <br>Male Centaurs wished that you were right...</br></br>  <br/>  Isn't there a monster girl thread on /jp/? is it any good?  <br>Lala during full moon probably.</br>  Does anyone like her.  <br>lots of people<br><br> Myself included.  </br></br></br>  So the Tokyo MX being any less censored than AT-X or CR was a ruse, right?  <br>BACK THE FUCK OFF?!?</br>  <br/>  <br>Do I have to put them in a bowl first?</br>  <br>Oh well, it won't be mentioned in rest of the series.</br>  Reminder that monster girls are heretical and should be slain.   I like spiders   <br>Yes there is and no it isn't, and I say that as someone who frequents it almost every day.</br>  <br>Sigh. Do you really need me to explain this again? There are some very disturbed individuals in the world who have... done things... and they freely share information. So we know how a Centaur's Pussy and a human's dick would interact.<br><br>A centaur's pussy will be loose at first, but there is an incredible level of muscular control inside. The insides are hot, like steaming on a cold day hot, especially when aroused. With the muscles clamping down, what goes from a loose, hot tunnel goes as tight as a virgin pussy.<br><br>Further, the muscular control is so intense that your Centaur waifu will be able to effectively milk your cock with the contractions.<br><br>Now, Stallions, or in this case, centaur males, have very big cocks yes... but they also have very little staying power. 10 seconds of penetration and pumping before they cum and go off on their business.<br><br>This fact, along with the fact that centaur mare pussies most eroginous and pleasurable zones, including their clit which is large enough to rub along the underside of your dick as you penetrate her as she tightens and 'winks' as you make love to her, are right at the 'mouth' of her pussy. Just inside. IE, where your cock is going to reach.<br><br>So, with enough stimulation, you'll find centaur mares very receptive and orgasming to a human sized penis compared to a stallion sized.<br><br>In fact, many centaur women prefer the smaller size.<br><br>There is the old 'its not the size of the vessel, but the motion of the ocean'? It certainly applies to Centaur Maidens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lots of people </br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>wat do</br></br></br>  <br> Get rock hard faster then I ever have ever. </br>    <br>This again?</br>  <br> tfw no paladin onee--san to protect you from evil mamono <br><br><br>If you call a thousand post shitstorm better, then yes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same as <br><br>It's not something to start going to if you're completely new to monstergirl stuff and dont know anything about the history of these threads<br><br>It's just the best option out of a buch of really shitty ones for monstergirl discussion</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>All i remember from the canon is that they use human males to get the female centaur horny enough for the male centaur to start his business.<br><br>If your goal is to be a professional cuck then go ahead Moot, I'm not going to judge.</br></br></br>    <br>I'm into tragic romance, aswell. Of course I love her.<br> mfw you will never leave your baby to her after you've died <br> mfw you will never go out like romeo and juliet <br> mfw you will never have her child after she died while giving birth to the child. </br></br></br></br>  <br> There are some very disturbed individuals in the world who have... done things... and they freely share information <br>Isn't it fucking dangerous to fucking a horse? What if it drop kicks your dick anytime you're trying to fug it?</br></br>  <br>Who would ever want to harm someone so perfect?</br>   wake up <br> see this <br>What do?</br></br>  <br>Get raped.</br>  <br> Liking spiders <br><br>How much more of a social outcast can you be</br></br></br>  <br>surrender myself to her.</br>  Reminder that Miia is a slut that used MC to get his sperm and get more lamia's  <br>grab a hose and spray her away</br>  <br>That's europark in germany right?</br>  <br> Image related <br> Not really. Fuck the shit out of her </br></br>  <br>Is getting full-body hugged by a slime considered vore?</br>  <br>You can easily steal away and marry your own centaur waifu without them being part of that horrible polygamist marriage culture. Look at Cerea. She is pure and unmarried.<br><br>Darling is going to get some mint, perfect horse pussy.<br><br>Oh yeah, its dangerous. But these disturbed individuals are experienced horse handlers. You can easily tell when they want to be touched and when they don't. If they don't, the horse fuckers arn't dumb enough to stand behind them and try to stick their dick in.<br><br>And those that are get kicked. And get weeded out of the gene pool<br><br><br>Probably, but its also the same design as Medieval Times.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well if you actually read it you would know that that's just a front for the centaur women and the teasers to knock the husband out and fuck over his unconscious body. <br><br>Cerea's mom confirms that that's common in the mom bonus chapter<br><br>Honestly though it doesn't make their culture any less shitty</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Take her to a romantic stroll under the hard rain.</br>  <br><br>Sweat furiously.</br></br>  <br> implying twenty seconds of grunting and failed penetration is worth the risk of retard meathead babies. </br>   wake up <br> see this <br>What do?</br></br>  <br> Darling is going to get some mint, perfect horse pussy. <br><br> implying Cerea is going to win </br></br></br>   wake up <br> see this <br><br>wat do</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of Lala, anyone here got that Irish accent edit of her going all chuuni for the D</br>  <br>I think even most of the smart ones are getting weeded out of the gene pool since horses can't give birth to humans</br>  No matter who you think is the best, you can't hate Suu  <br>The author already confirmed that either Cerea or Mia would win.</br>  <br>Touch the spidercow, do it now!</br>  <br>Be sad that Crabman has yet to include an Ushi-Oni in the manga</br>  <br> Remove her seal <br> Close my eyes </br></br>  <br>Call the cops, tell her to go away while my waifu hugs me close</br>  <br> Implying they aren't going to Harem End with him marrying all the girls due to a passing of the Extraspecies Polygamy Act. </br>   waking up and seeing all these girls gunning for my dick <br>Is it the full moon or something?</br>  <br>"Here, have this."</br>  <br>Full moon frenzy soon.</br>  <br>Trufax</br>  <br>Not soon enough.</br>  Does horse have the best singing voice or the greatest singing voice?   doujin abou suu becoming a literal cumdump after absorbing tons of semen   <br>Go without fapping until the time comes. I dare you. I double dare you, motherfucker.</br>  <br>I'm going to need a source on that, and honestly if you think that only one girl is going to win and it's not Miia you're insane</br>    <br>What does that achieve?</br>  The real question of the episode is how Darling managed to remodel the entire bathroom in one day.  <br>When has he ever said that Cerea could seriously win?</br>  <br>Come on man, at least read the manga, it explains it.</br>  <br>He won't. She's like Kenkou's main girl.</br>  <br>Don't ask for the impossible anon.</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br> Cerea is the cutest edition <br> edition </br></br>  <br>YES.

Now we have shit like Gangsta., an anime that by all rights, could, and would make just as good a live action american night-time series, as it does an evening-time animation in japan, for the japanese.<br><br>Now all that would need to happen, to cement japanimations success to the outside world (outside of the autistic otaku / weeb faggots like us all), is for subtitles to come already supplied with the final release of the BD/DVD at the end of each season, in the top 10 most spoken languages, then anime would essentially over-night, become a polarized success.<br><br>But with that, it'd probably come at a cost. The cost would be, no more anime LIKE gangsta., and a more generalized anime for a generalized audience. Which would suck, but deep down, I'm sure that there are a lot of you in these threads that believe this anime is worth more than what it's given credence, and if only it could be a world-wide thing without sacrificing the quality, or the pandering. I'm sure there are a lot of you that wish anime could be a mainstream thing and yeah, it may seem like that's what's happening considering what, gangsta, black lagoon...and what else?<br><br>Gangsta., I swear to god, this anime would open the windows of success for japan and the anime industry as a whole, if it made it to western televisions or even non asian ones in a normal T.V. timeslot.<br><br>Just my TL;DR shit opinion.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> japanimations </br>  Himouto Umaru has better animation and action than Gangsta  <br> I'm sure there are a lot of you that wish anime could be a mainstream thing and yeah, it may seem like that's what's happening considering what, gangsta, black lagoon...and what else? <br><br>Also, in case anyone responds to this portion of my post thinking they're clever, I was being rhetorical. Meaning there is no fucking audience anymore for anime like Gangsta, black lagoon, jormungand, Baccano!, and the few other actually good wide-audience types of anime.<br><br>This anime season is literally one of the poorest seasons I've ever seen.<br><br>This, and the summer of 2011's season are pretty tied up for shittiest of all time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking japanimations isn't plural <br><br>Act like a fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>Black Lagoon was on Toonami and already did everything you said Gangsta could do. The Tarantino era is dead for anime.</br>  <br>Way too miss the point.</br>  <br>Every season.jpg</br>  <br>Not him but 2014's summer season was pretty great.</br>  <br><br> Now all that would need to happen, to cement japanimations success to the outside world (outside of the autistic otaku / weeb faggots like us all), is for subtitles to come already supplied with the final release of the BD/DVD at the end of each season, in the top 10 most spoken languages, then anime would essentially over-night, become a polarized success. <br><br>You don't actually believe this shit, do you? You think adults in places outside of maybe France are going to even pay attention to a cartoon in the first place? Besides, Japan tried that sort of thing already years and years ago. It didn't really work. <br><br>Also, that sounds like an excellent way for companies to go bankrupt. Advertising is expensive, and advertising in ten different languages would be necessary for that to mean anything at all. <br><br>Hardly anyone outside of Japan even pays for anime.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This anime season is literally one of the poorest seasons I've ever seen. <br>People keep saying this but I feel like they just missed that one a few seasons ago that was literally just action harems. Like five action harems and nothing else.</br></br>    <br>Be honest would you fuck  _Nic_? </br>    I get the feeling that the people posting ITT talking about how this is edgy fujoshit when it's just two guys dicking around doing kick-ass shit, yet they don't say a fucking word when it's a group of women doing similar shit - are the same people that bitch if there are too many "mature" anime a season, and not enough moeshit / SAO tier garbage / school-harem garbage.<br><br>What, is it impossible for you people to break out of your cognitive dissonance and possibly imagine that someone may like an anime that's outside of your spectrum of taste or experience?<br><br>I can understand disliking an anime you've seen more than 5 episodes of, but shitting on an anime just to shit on it, and then ironically posting a response to someone who ironically posted a response to someone who posted ironically about how shit it is in order to "troll" them, makes you out to be an uneducated fuck with no plans of experiencing new things.<br><br>Stagnation is what's going to kill the industry.<br><br>Also, this isn't fujoshit. It needs to be a harem of guys and one girl.<br><br>Two guys and one girl is not fujo. Black lagoon is a fucking fujo, but none of you complained about that shit right? Oh, that's right, /a/ wasn't as full of cancerous newshit SAO clone loving FAGGOTS like it is now.<br><br>Get the fuck off my fucking /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, i aint gonna do it</br>  <br>Why is this picture even a fucking thing?</br>  <br>If you were a cute little girl that is</br>  <br> this isn't fujoshit <br>Tell that to all the fujoshis already drawing their disgusting fanarts right now, not us.</br></br>  <br>maximum autism</br>  <br>But fujos like a lot of different series, as long as it has boys. Are you saying series like One Piece and Bleach is fujoshit as well then?</br>  <br>This show had lewd Alex fanart before it had Fujoshi fanart</br>  <br>Oh god, how I remember the BL airing on toonami. I would sit in my window, drinking alcohol, chain-smoking like a wannabe badass with the Beretta I bought on the desk in front of me like an absolute fucking retard.<br><br>Also<br> The Tarantino era is dead for anime. <br><br>This is so fucking true and it hurts. It hurts anon.<br><br><br>Way to use the wrong to.<br><br><br>Last season?<br><br><br>You don't actually believe this shit, do you? You think adults in places outside of maybe France are going to even pay attention to a cartoon in the first place?<br><br>I don't, and that's why I fucking said, "what would NEED to happen", and not "what's already happened - and is therefore responsible for what we have now, being x/y success", because that success hasn't happened yet, meaning nobody gave, or still gives - a fuck.<br><br> Besides, Japan tried that sort of thing already years and years ago. It didn't really work.  <br><br>Yeah? With what exactly, faggot. What'd they do, in the fucking 1980's with their stipend technology, shitty translations, horribly paid animators (that hasn't really changed), etc etc. Are you meaning to tell me that any advances into the realm of, lets say, hollywood tier levels of success, would be blunted, held back, or discarded by their lack of getting out to the public or their inability to get attention? That's bullshit and you fucking know it. If any major company WANTED world-wide success, they'd have more than enough resources to fucking make it happen. Look at ghibli for details, retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> comparing akame ga shit to gangsta <br>kill yourself</br></br>   bringing a katana to a gunfight   <br>I firmly retract my statement. You reminded me of that season. The worst airing season was the one in which Kaze no Stigma, and that other one with the guy who powered up by drinking breast milk - aired.<br><br>Holy christ, I was bored out of my fucking wits.</br></br></br>  <br> tough and sensitive  <br> perfect and flawed <br>u wot m8</br></br></br>  <br>Akame ga Shit least had its own following and fanbase, no matter how bad it was - which it gathered way before anime and on its own.<br><br>Gangsta was crappy manga many read and dropped and universaly recognized as such until /v/ anime only crossborders came, seen Fujoshi idols with guns and instantly though it`ll be the new Black Lagoon<br><br>Its really hillariously to see people try to defend and praise it, well knowing it`ll all go poof the more they watch it and learn about it<br><br>At least Jormungang awoided having such retatded situation. But than again, it was uncomparably better too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have no fucking idea how many series fujos draw fanart of, do you?<br><br>Anyway fuck off retard, you're the equivalent of women complaining about fanservice characters but somehow even more childish.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, he is obviously wrong, AkG is fun, have lovable characters, have an actual story and great art.</br>  <br>You right, I don't know how it work, and I don't want to know, i'm not into gay stuffs.<br><br><br>At least One Piece and Bleach have normal porn, and is easily avoided, Gangsta will be like when I went to check for Shiki porn, it was all gay shit.</br></br></br></br>  Waiting patiently for subs.  <br>Please link to wherever you're finding this gangsta porn because I've gone through the entire pixiv tag and there's not much</br>  <br> Also, that sounds like an excellent way for companies to go bankrupt. Advertising is expensive, and advertising in ten different languages would be necessary for that to mean anything at all. <br> Hardly anyone outside of Japan even pays for anime. <br><br>Yeah, and most, if not almost all of that, is done by illegal streaming and torrenting, it illegally BECAUSE we don't have subtitles, it's necessary for it to be ripped by people, and then subtitled in their own languages so we can even fucking watch it and experience it while its airing in the first place, instead of doing what THEY want, which is waiting for an official group to get the license and make their shitty dubs for us.<br><br>We get sick of waiting = it gets ripped anyway = we watch it in our own language = they lose money.<br><br>They hard-sub it = there happens to be english subs at the end of each season for all the shows = people see less of a need to download / torrent / stream because there are official translations now for their shows = people stop depending on fansubs = more relevant discussion<br><br>Which leads to<br>1.) companies having to, for the first time, have back-and-forths with american studios outside of simply giving license rights, because now they're part of the community at large, instead of just a small, otaku infested shitty country-only community<br>2.) people worldwide without access to torrent sites can, if they have people that speak multiple languages - translate off of a different language that ISN'T japanese, and thereafter can now watch shows they weren't able to before<br>3.) Sales go up world-wide and japanese studios will immediately realize how big the fucking market for anime ACTUALLY is, compared to what they simply think it is based on game and merchandise sales that go out to countries outside of japan.<br><br>Have you seen the fucking list for OFFICIAL subtitled and dubbed anime?<br><br>https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet<wbr>s/d/11eEFSW7rsWAphS7Du5SE1pCUCIjPpb<wbr>07jRgIybGp0bo/edit?hl=en_US&amp;pli=1#g<wbr>id=2</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Akame ga kill troll <br><br>Why do people reply to this obvious bait</br></br>  <br> using a OP image as a reaction image, ever. <br> ever. <br>This is your faggot hero, anon.

Yui was raped by her father and her mother found out about it. Then they try to sweep the deed under the table so the father doesn't have to go to jail. That's why Yui cannot live at her house with her family, it would be too traumatic for her and the rest of her family.  <br>Edgy-kun pls go<br> and stay go [/spoiler ] </br></br>  <br>shit just got heavy man...<br>you've got to man up... so you can defend yourself and your friends... against rape... from your dad...<br><br>you're a horrible person anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>His father has good taste</br>  <br>Yui seemed to be pretty casual about it</br>  <br> his </br>  <br>Effects of trauma.

Thank you.</br>  <br>S-shitpost-chan, is that you?</br>  <br>As an artist, I suffer from Chinatsu Syndrome (or CS). I applied to a prestigious design school (because someone I loved was doing it) at the very last minute literally crapping out my portfolio and somehow got in. But every time I actually try to work on something it always ends up looking like an autistic satan spawn made it.<br><br>In light of this evidence, I believe that if Chinatsu stays distracted long enough, she will get in to art school, and not become the second coming of Hitler.</br></br></br>  <br>...<br/></br>    <br>Pretty much what happens.<br>Chinatsu Syndrome is a real thing. You can learn to live with it though.</br></br>  <br>I doubt something that bad can ever happen with us, we'll be alright.</br>  <br>I agree.</br>  In the ending Akarin says "I'm having an delusion"<br>But Akarin isn't really the type to have delusions, at least compared to other characters<br>Only logical conclusion is that the entire series is a delusion that Akari is having</br></br>  <br>you're a delusion Akari is having.</br>  How can yurus be real if lesbians aren't real?  <br>They aren't lesbians.

Went from not liking Chinatsu to thinking she's not so bad<br><br>Now I dislike the writer for bullying Akari all the time</br></br>  <br>Aka-who?</br>  <br> Now I dislike the writer for bullying Akari all the time <br>But Kyouko is the one bullying Akari all the time.</br></br>  <br>I think Chinatsu is the one who was molested by her father. Remember when she said fathers are scary? She's probably having PTSD from her father and heterosexuality, causing her to become a lesbian.<br><br>That rift in her family explains why her parents are always away, as shown in S1 episode 5.<br><br>The only reason Tomoko praises Chinatsu a lot is because she knows how emotionally scarred Chinatsu is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> disliking namori </br>  <br> causing her to become a lesbian </br>    <br/>  <br><br>They were actually just referencing a common phrase in Japan or something.</br></br>  The mind of a killer lies behind those eyes, I tell ya.

Yuru Yuri is suffering.</br>  <br>Why is Chizuru so shit? She ruined the whole show.</br>  <br>she's the least interesting character so far but i'd hardly say she ruined it.</br>  <br>I wouldn't go so far as to say that she ruined the whole show, but she is definitely shit. The drooling sound is annoying.</br>  <br>She's poorly represented in the anime. The manga has her in a much better light</br>  <br>People keep saying this, but she's an autistic loser in the manga as well.</br>  <br>but she's a lovable autistic loser</br>  What's with the Chizuru hate? She practically has no flaws. Even if you say she's Chitose Lite, she appears only briefly and that seems like more of a problem with Chitose.  <br>She doesn't have enough screen time to have flaws</br>  <br>She's the Tomoko Kuroki of Yuru Yuri. Anyone who hated Watamote will probably hate her. It's a very dividing character trope, so that's why alot of people hate her</br>  <br>Can't really agree there, I hated Tomoko with a passion and like Chizuru.<br>Chizuru is socially awkward but to the point of seeming down right retarded</br></br>  <br>They have a lot in common but it's not a fair comparison. Looking at her later parts in the manga, having trouble getting along with others and misunderstandings is rather common, it also happens between Yui and Ayano. Chizuru is not nearly as extreme aside from her fantasies.</br>  <br>My main takeaway from that page: look how cute Chitose is! But yeah, Chizuru was okay.</br>  <br>Tomoko is funny. Chizuru is just a shit.</br>  <br>you tried</br>  <br>Tomoko has her own series. Chizuru has a few chapters</br>  <br>A few chapters too many.</br>  <br>Both of the autist-twins are shit tier. The one that gets nosebleeds is annoying as hell.</br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>You take that back, Nosebleed-chan a best.</br>  <br>I love the love in these threads.<br><br><br>Buh Anon, we get to get raped!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ikea Twins are the best. You're just jealous you don't have a moody booty twin and extreme nose bleeds.</br>  <br>Worst taste ITT<br>I can accept that some people dislike Chizuru, but Chitose a best</br></br>  <br>Other way around. Chitose has flaws, at times too much screen time.</br>  <br>Anime Chitose a badly done<br>Manga Chitose a best</br></br>  <br>Badly done, but I still like her. Both twins are great.</br>    <br>I agree. I really didn't like her after I finished watching the anime, but she is great in the manga. In fact everyone is simply better in the manga.<br><br>More yuri moments, more character development, and I think that the manga has gotten better, as it has gone on.<br><br>I still really love the anime though. And I can't wait for the next OVAs and season 3.<br>Also there are so many chapters I hope they animate, I am not sure if they could do them all.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>big sister bump!</br>  <br>they're the best</br>   Hey loser, get in the car   Who Umaru here?  <br> Implying it's not a dank meme </br>  <br>I'm in love with Sakurako and Himawari interactions, not necessarily with each other, in the manga and anime. The drama CDs are pretty good too.</br>  <br>Romeo and Juliet Drama CD was fucking great,  and fucking gay </br>  <br>O-Ok</br>  <br>Ojou-sama ni naritai!</br>  Is loving Rum Raisin a sign that Kyouko is going to love getting crunk?    <br>Ayano makes the most amazingly retarded puns ever. I guess you've got to use the word Pompadour at some point in your life.</br>    <br>Where is it? I can only find 3 of the drama CDs.

Everyone knows what EOP means. <br><br>But yes, you're right, strictly speaking it's not chosen too well because of people like you.</br></br></br>  <br>I actually dropped it because MC was no fun allowed moralfaggot to the max, couldn't care less for wehter he's doing it alone or with a group because in the end he was the one who saved the day anyway</br>  <br>I REMEMBER if you know what I mean.<br><br>Per my fantasy battle harem interest, I'm of course all over this.</br></br></br>  <br>It definitely wouldn't be hard to do, depends if anyone feels it's worth the effort.</br>  <br>Black of course</br>    <br>Buttslut of the series?</br>  <br>The best.</br>    <br>Infinite Stratos?</br>  <br>With better characters</br>  Is the MC good?<br>I mean if terms of interacting with female cast</br>  <br> Simulcast: FUNimation (Schedule TBA) <br>Fucking dropped<br>Sure is a good way for me to know what I'm watching or not</br></br></br>  How censored will it be?

Middle-left and bottom-right as you can notice are sisters</br>  <br>What the fuck FUNimation has to do with your choice of show though</br>  <br>I can kill a number of filthy Jews than wasting my ~6 hours of watching garbage.</br>  We ded now?  Tell me this show is shit do I don't have to watch it. I'm not really in the mood for a generic harem right now but if it's decent I'll give it a try.  <br>Then why aren't you hunting now? Why are you here?<br><br>Episode didn't even air yet.</br></br></br>  <br>How we are suppose to know it? All LNs are shits but anime are sometime entertaining. Wait for subs</br>    10 minutes  <br>Isnt there a manga scanlation though. Let me check em a bit.</br>  5 mins get in here fags  <br><br> FUNimation <br>haha, I'd expect no less from the kings of generic haremshit title licensing</br></br></br>  topkek        <br>Everything is FUNimation now. So you should learn Japanese by next year.</br>  <br> Everything is FUNimation now. <br>that's because everything in generic haremshit now</br></br>        <br>This the new IRC shit post? sure looks like it. <br><br>If not IRC some faggot mexican is just literally asking for a mexicowide ban,</br></br></br>  Who writes this shit, seriously it's like they have the brain of a 13 year old  <br>There are a lot of currently airing shows that aren't generic haremshits<br>You're just a retard</br></br>  So this is where the world break budget went.    The toast in mouth and run into each other cliche, seriously?  <br>Easiest way to check which anime irc shitposts is checking gookslut's current trip and name</br>    <br><br>Already AOTS.</br></br>  So cliché  <br> watching generic harem LN <br> not expecting cliches <br>Are you stupid?</br></br></br>    <br>They could at least try to spice it up a bit.<br><br> Although it wouldn't be generic then </br></br></br>      Can't wait for my LN harem garbage this season. Felt dry last season because Danmachi was way too good.  MC gives no fuck  <br>What's up with all the white brightness? first to love ru deletes all the shadding and now this ?</br>  <br> The Ultra Popular Work <br><br>Haha, he got me there.</br></br></br>    <br> All LNs are shits <br>Heh, don't generalize like that, m8, you must think every LNs are just generic battle harem or generic romcom, huh</br></br>  <br>And how is an EOP supposed to know what LNs are like?</br>  So generic it hurts  That was generic as hell but enjoyable too.  <br>and it will probably sells more than your favourite series</br>  Confirmed Muv-Luv TE 2.0?  Just like in KC, CGI models  <br>Or Black Bullet.</br>  <br>In his mind<br> Why even trying to get girls <br> This is generic harem battle LN <br> Suffering </br></br></br></br>  Tits next week  http://folderman.mobi/s/fm26115.gif<wbr><br><br>Can't webm from phone</br></br></wbr>    <br>I wait for this. I prepare for another world break hypes.</br>  <br> Not posting panties for dual ribbons </br>    So which you like better? Original designs  or mouretsu-movie alike redesigns?  <br>Wow the budget increase seems substantial.</br>  <br>Forgot a pic</br>  OP: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x8lk6</wbr>  <br>Like most LN adaptations, the original art is better. Although, I don't dislike the anime's style.</br>  Anyone who watched the anime, tell me is it funny as the manga? Are the MC not totally Beta?  <br>According to Funi schedule, this is should be out in about 40 minutes although I guess HS doesn't know about it.</br>  what sub group is picking this up? I need to dl it for science  <br>No group has said anything yet. So we're stuck with HShit for now.</br>  <br>He was in his underwear and the girl was the one blushing.</br>  <br>He seems laidback</br>  <br>dont say that man ;_;</br>  <br>HS is fine, Funi is the problem.</br>  <br> tfw Funi licensed more than half of summer <br> that's gonna make them delay shows even more <br>It really fucking sucks.</br></br></br>  <br>This one bit more bland. It's more colorless and also the current anime put more effort in shadowing, imo. So in short i liked the current anime better.</br>  <br>Manga. Both LN and anime look like shit.</br>  It's out.<br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>09402</wbr></br>  <br> tfw its raw and you cant into moonrune ;_; </br>  Now can wait for actual show of the day, Umaru-chan. 40 min dammit, this shit barely moved time.  <br>Where do you think HS got it. It's from funi too.</br>  <br>Why is this slut spreading her legs?</br>  <br>Pleby please.</br>  so if MC is supposedly so based does he even do anything? All I see is generic shit about the girls  <br>So she can cover her chest.</br>  <br>Because otaku care about girls not MC</br>  <br>He doesn't really give a fuck. He's too god damned lazy to act alpha or beta.</br>  <br>He kills insects and doesn't afraid of anything.</br>  ED: http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>x8pb4</wbr>   Generic tsundereshit main heroine <br><br>Into the trash it goes.</br></br>    <br>Why do they always have to include Kirito clones into these. I want to like this because of the girls, but the chuuni self-insert protagonist is probably going to ruin it.</br>  It seems episode 1 is up on Funi site.<br><br>http://www.funimation.com/shows/sky<wbr>-wizards-academy/videos/official/fi<wbr>reteam-e601</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Any estimate till HS rips it? I was just going to watch it raw.</br>  <br>Funi releases from HS on the last few days out around 1-2 hours after it's out on Funi.</br>  <br><br>Go back to Symphogear, Nanoha and Valkyrie Drive. We have our territory, you have yours.</br></br>  <br>He fucked up something important in past and now is ostracized</br>  Its shit?  Is this the absolute shit of the season?  <br>If you watched just for girls you can just watch yuri anime and be satisfied. Why does you feel disturbed by male beta mc in your favourite yuri animu?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12778360 <br>  its shit <br>It is shit!!!</br></br>  s02 of chrome shelled regios is here?    I don't understand why this anime even exists.    <br>BECAUSE <br>IT'S COMMERCIAL FOR LIGHT NOVEL</br></br>    <br>I thought light novels were just scripts for cartoons.</br>    <br>They usually have simple writing, unless it's Nisio kanji wankery/other chuunishit. But adaptation is only is for popular or if publisher thinks it has potential</br>  <br> The story is set in a world where humanity, driven off the land by the threat of magical armored insects, now live in aerial floating cities. <br>Why are humans in the future always pussies in anime?<br> a bunch of women and ladybois went into hiding instead of taking swift action to kill the insect threat immediately once they presented the faintest shadow of a threat to humanity </br></br></br>  <br>Don't nips have better stuff to promote?</br>  <br>Not when the LN industry is a cashcow.

You know, better LNs, not so fucking generic. There should be more imaginative writers than that.</br></br></br>  So fucking bad that I'll pick up the show.  <br> Implying they want that. <br>Why take a gamble at animating a not generic LN with a not generic cast and not generic setting and plot when you can go full generic and cash in on the merch and BDs?<br>For something to become generic it at to have done something right in the past to reach this point, so why stop using the formula now, when there's still money to be made?</br></br></br>  Is this two cour?

All the girls are shit so far but the MC is hilarious  Well that was boring, it needs to be more like World Break and less like Absolute Duo  <br>Now that I think about it, Nisekoi will be considered "classic romance manga" by kids.<br>Oh god the horror.</br></br>   124 loss streak <br> we recommend you leave the school voluntarily <br>My sides.</br></br>  <br>I don't think it's possible Anon, World Break was just too good. It can't just be topped by any random generic battle harem. Maybe someday we'll get something similar enough to be just as fun, but until then all we can do is wait.</br>  So, what is deal with everyone and their mother saying MC is a traitor ? From what we have seen in the beginning, he was making a heroic sacrifice more than a betrayal. Even that Leader who looks like a hard professional, adresses him highly unprofessionaly as a traitor.  <br> Black Master Swordsman <br>Guts?</br></br>  <br>Mai dick.</br>  <br>The point is to make our MC into a tragic hero to draw in the self-insert otaku crowd.</br>  QUALITY THE ANIME  why is the strongest man in the world wasting his talents studying and getting married?  He would be wasting his talents training and fighting.  <br><br>It was established already.<br><br>He does not have the tireless drive to train like Goku or Vegeta do.<br><br>If he did he would be the strongest in the series.<br><br>Also you now know if Chi Chi pushed him to train after Cell then nothing else bad would have ever happened to earth or any of the characters cause he be too damn op.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Did he even do anything relevant? As a fighter he could get much more in terms of feats. What are his non fighting talents?</br></br>  <br>In Dragon Ball Online he wrote a book that taught the public how to control their ki.</br>  <br>This is actually cool, but they probably wont go near it in DBS.</br>  <br><br>Big whoop. Not even canon.<br><br>So pretty much nothing other than reading books?<br><br>Yea he should have stuck to his REAL talents</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He is not the strongest man in the world.</br>  <br>he's the great Sayiaman</br>   Gohan will never have bloodlust ever again <br><br>Fuck, Videl and Pan have plot armor due to the ending of Z. He can never be pissed off as he was in the Cell and Buu saga ever again. Gohan is a fuckboi confirmed 4 gay life.</br></br>  <br><br>mystic gohan murders everything below ssj god</br></br>  toriyama wanted gohan to be a badass and be the best<br><br>but japan got mad generic goku wasn't the best, so toriyama made gohan get sucked up by super buu</br></br>  Because he doesn't want to.<br><br>There's already more than enough people to take care of all the bad things that could happen. Plus whenever an arc is over everyone's sure nobody stronger could come.</br></br>  Goku is the worst father ever, that's why...  <br>Gohan will get his own limelight later, no way Super is going to go on without Gohan doing some shit</br>  <br>That's an odd way to spell Ging</br>  better than goten. goten grew up to be weak as fuck and a man slut  <br>Yeah, he'll get another unearned powerboost, beat an enemy around a bit and then blow it just in time for the real heroes (Goku, Vegeta, &amp; Mark) to come save the day.</br>  <br>I hope that happens if for no other reason than to keep Super from becoming just the Goku show.</br>   character has other aspirations in life and wants to raise a proper family <br><br> people make fun of him for this </br></br>  <br>Yeah but that makes him 3rd place among the Sayians only beating out two kids half his age.</br>  <br>What if he just doesn't like to fight? Sure we would like to do all of that crazy stuff. But since his childhood he's been exposed to death, pain, sadness, chaos, and whole bunch of other shit. Odds are it scarred him for life and he's just sick of it.</br>  <br> Videl and Pan have plot armor due to the ending of Z <br>what is wishing loved ones back to life with the dragon balls?</br></br>  Gohan isn't that great of a character anyway, he really doesn't bring much to the table as far as personality, his most notable traits are being a whining beta mamas boy who just happens to be powerful as fuck.  <br><br>To add onto what this anon said. He has never liked fighting. He's only had to fight because he's had to. Ever since he was 3, he was taken from his home and forced to fight in the wilderness for a year. Watched all of his friends and family die in front of him multiple times. All while people scream at him "GOHAN YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN DO IT".<br><br>Who can blame the guy for just wanting to finally settle down and enjoy himself when he thinks that there is no real present danger?</br></br></br></br>  So how long until Piccolo abducts Gohan and drops him on some desolate planet to fend for himself for a year in an attempt toughen him up again?  <br>You just proved me right.</br>  <br>the only time gohan was every a whining beta mamas boy was when he was 4. in the great saiyaman saga he enjoyed fighting for justice that was what they should have continued his character going. <br><br>not exactly the great saiyaman but at least someone who wants to fight to keep his family safe.</br></br></br>  <br>Super won't be the kinda show like the original manga was that can even allow powerups. He will get an episode for himself and Videl, that will lead to him defending Videl or just proving his worth</br>  <br>Dragon Ball's target audience is children. Expecting them to be able to empathize with other people is a bit silly of you.</br>  <br>Except that those children are now on their late 20's and early 30's.</br>  <br>as gohan got older he definitely showed that he enjoyed fighting to some extent. Not exactly goku or vegeta, but definitely enough where he probably would have trained if goku were still a live and had some encouragement. Instead he got Chi Chi telling him since he defeated cell all he had to do was study and everything would turn out ok. <br><br>I mean look at how he acted when they went into babidi's hideout they were all playing rock paper scissors to see who would fight. <br><br>when the androids were about to attack he wanted to train he wasnt forced to train at all. <br><br>he WANTED to go to namek. All these things indicate that he was willing to fight in battle to save those he cared about. the fight with cell where gohan didnt want to fight cell because he didnt want to kill anyone is bullshit written in to make it more dramatic because gohan was always willing to fight for the sake of others.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku and Vegeta aren't SSG in Super dickweed.</br>    <br> blocking a roundhouse with your wrist / back of your hand </br>  <br>It wasn't that he did not wanted to fight he just didn't feel like he couldn't beat Cell.</br>  <br><br>Still though, our world and dragonball's world are very different, we don't have planet busters coming every couple of years to destroy us so its okay not to be a great fighter, but they can't afford to get soft because that could mean the end of the world. <br><br>Protecting the world &gt; Reading Books</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yea he should have stuck to his REAL talents <br><br>Fucking Videl till she can't walk?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had that talent.</br>  <br>He looked cooler with the helmet instead of the durag</br>  <br> when the androids were about to attack he wanted to train he wasnt forced to train at all. <br><br>Clear and present danger: check<br><br> he WANTED to go to namek. <br><br>he wanted to revive his dead friends not fight Space Ghengis Kahn <br><br>it's not that he likes to fight or go on adventure it's just that he's not about to ignore what's in front of him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All that is meaningless when you have Goku and the dragonballs. They are the only ones that shine at the end.</br>  That's an odd outfit to wear for studying.  <br>Gohan likes to fight, he just doesn't like obsessively training and having fights to the death.</br>  <br>Because he's already beat people asses in the streets with his fists.<br>Now he need to beat bitches in the sheets with his dick</br></br>  <br>Move aside</br>  <br>Those planet busters are unexpected every time.<br><br>I mean who the fuck would expect to face someone stronger than the strongest being in the universe ( Frieza ) ?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Goku is washed up, couldn't beat the androids, couldn't beat cell, only beat buu because of Vegeta, Satan, and literally every living thing on earth, and couldn't beat Beerus even as a god himself.<br><br>Its time to pass the torch......to future Gohan.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tank you for the introduction, citizen but you should stand back. Things could get hairy</br></br>  I'm just mad he isn't cucking Videl with best girl.  <br>How's it feel to be wrong? Also, that is clearly not what that is.</br>  <br>He went to college. The only other people who ever did that are Dr. Gero and Bulma.</br>  <br><br>that red head is nice but she ain't cuter than Videl</br></br>  <br>The nips would never let that happen.</br>  <br>I just think the robot helmet was more cool. Calm your autism.</br>  <br><br><br><br>I do wonder why he never switched back to the helmet even after the tournament was over.<br><br>Why do the DBZ fighters even enter the tournament anyways? They know it's gonna come down to just them.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's an excuse to go all out against each other with an impartial judge to determine who's the better. Since it was first introduced in dragonball, the tournament has always been a way to see who was the strongest outside of a training environment.</br>  <br>Which should be extremely obvious to anyone who actually watched DB/Z/etc.</br>  <br>It's still a nice excuse to show some cool fights</br>  <br>videl didn't aged well</br>  Future Gohan &gt; all<br><br>Will Future Trunks appear in Super?</br></br>  <br>Because a life of fighting monsters is not anywhere near as fullfulling as having a loving family.</br>  <br>How do you know? Have you done both?</br>  <br>Because having martial artist as an occupation doesn't pay the bills.</br>  <br> Not even canon. <br>It is though.</br></br>  <br>So they just went from children to manchildren.</br>  <br><br>Exactly.<br><br> InB4 Videl is rich as fuck <br><br>I see it as that Gohan mainly wants to be a scholar because he wanst to become one, but after watching this episode, he probably also wants to provide and not being a freeloader.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon you seem to forget going to Namek was never meant to be dangerous<br><br>it was meant to be a fun space adventure</br></br></br>  <br>Because fans sent death letters to Toriyama saying stuff like "If Gohan becomes the main character we are going to find and kill you"<br>So Toriyama was like fuck that shit.</br></br>  <br><br>He could join pretty much any sports team and be a billionaire in no time, Videl is strong enough to do the same which would allow Gohan the time to train.</br></br>  Just about to download Dbs. What subs are best?  <br> why is the strongest man in the world wasting his talents studying and getting married? <br>Because that's his wish and desire? Why did every murrican suddenly forgot how much of a cry baby Gohan always was? He never wanted to fight, he ALWAYS was dragged to the fights.</br></br>  <br><br>he's so strong, he no longer needs to fight.</br></br>  <br>He loves his woman, loves the earth, loves his mom and dad, his friends, oh and his Foster dad as well. He's like Goku was when he was little and growing up, he never hated or wanted to hate anyone</br>   Wants to live a normal peaceful happy life <br> WAAAH WHY DOESN'T HE KEEP TRAINING? FUCK HIM FOR BEING HAPPY <br><br>This is why I hate DBZfags</br></br></br>  Future Gohan is the best one.  <br>He sure is.  Hand down. </br>  <br><br><br> the best <br> dead </br></br></br></br>  <br>He died like a bitch and never reached even close to his actual potential.</br>  <br><br>teen gohan from the other timeline would have whooped his ass<br><br>picollo from the other timeline would have whooped his ass</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nigga got his ass handed to him by shitty weak androids <br>How can he be the best?</br></br>  <br>Daily reminder</br>     gohan BTFO by Vegeta <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oVO<wbr>nm9tNcCM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Vegeta seems to be the only one taking a balanced approach, he trains relentlessly but also stays close to his family and tutors trunks, Goku takes it to the extreme and leaves for years at a time to train alone, Gohan is on the opposite side of that extreme by not training period and focusing on family life. <br><br>Oddly enough Vegeta seems to be the only one doing it right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Soon.      <br> vegeta is only saiyan living life correctly <br>Well that's something.</br></br>  gohan had the potential to be stronger than goku yes that is true but GOTEN HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE STRONGER THAN ALL THE SAIYANS LET ME REMIND YOU ALL THAT HE TURNED SUPER AT THE AGE OF LIKE 7  <br>"drops him on some desolate planet"? Did you even watch it properly</br>  <br><br> 00:20 <br> angrymanlet.jpg <br><br>should be called "Vegeta throwing a tissy at Gohan"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, but unfortunately, was as thick as a brick</br>  <br>Goku is a manchild that doesn't understand the weight of the shit he does. Vegeta is the only true man on the show.</br>  <br>Future Gohan's the weakest Gohan, though. Probably the weakest Super Saiyan.</br>  <br>Yeah he's not super smart like Goku was.</br>  <br><br>I'm really digging the new Vegeta to be honest, hes definitely matured a bit since his prince of all saiyan days.</br></br>    <br>Because every time there is peace in Dragon Ball they treat is as if the peace is going to last forever.<br>"Strongest in the universe" is a completely useless title, even in times of war since the only thing it's good for is saving the world for no reward whatsoever.<br>He figures he could make something with his life instead of being dumb muscle like his father.</br></br></br>  <br>Me too. I hope he finally gets his moment this time.</br>  <br>All Goten wants to do is goof off with Trunks and not seriously train like Goku did.</br>  <br> strongest man in the world </br>  <br>Its call irony anon. Highest capability, but no interest in acheiving it. its like the pacifist who can kick ass. its been used heaps of times in alot of tv and movies<br> Aang from TLA <br>as a prime example</br></br></br>  <br>But still the badman in a pink shirt</br>  To be honest, the Japanese Goku voice is growing on me. It really makes Goku sound like the manchild he is.  <br>I wonder where that bitch is now</br>  <br>that shirt pretty much sums up his existence post cell saga</br>  <br> "Strongest in the universe" is a completely useless title <br><br>Although he could theoretically have everything for free</br></br></br>  <br>Sucking baseball bro's dick</br>  <br>Future Gohan is the best Gohan in terms of character, inheriting his father's fighting spirit like a goddamn FotNS successor. It's too bad his actual power is surpassed by fuccboi Gohan.</br>  <br>I thought he was space napoleon hitler</br>  But in the end, who will be the one with a money making job and going home to a cute, loving, non-nagging wife at the end of the day?<br><br>Not Goku or Vegeta that's for sure.</br></br>  <br><br>Yeah its not that bad, I think the show will be good enough to enjoy no matter what language you hear it in anyway.</br></br>  <br>Future Gohan didn't have the luxury of the ROSAT or anybody to train with other than Trunks. Besides he usually took on both androids at once which no one else ever did.</br>  <br>He never had a similar experience to Goku when he joined Roshi. Krillan was all about training and Roshi's regimen was fucking brutal. Now look at Goten where his only training is goofing off with Trunks and the only person stronger than him that tried to train him was Goku who only had a short amount of time and isn't the most serious teacher ever. If Piccolo was stronger than Goten and was able to reign both him and Trunks in, then things would be different.</br>  <br><br> could steal anything they wanted  <br> police comes <br> goku flicks a pinto bean and kills every single cop alive </br></br></br></br>  <br>why is gohan acting like a king of fighters character?</br>  <br> was <br>The show is still going on anon</br></br>  <br><br>He is so fast though he could easily rob a bank without even being noticed.<br><br>Even without resorting to crime there really is no excuse for any of them to be broke or working a 9 to 5 when they can just go pro in pretty much any physical activity.</br></br></br></br>  I think all Gohan haters are just Jelous of his ability to have best girl every night. who i might add is top 3 strongest human in the world and probbably has matchable stamina to him  <br>He's a country hick monkey. Nozawa is perfect for the role.<br><br>Sean Schemmel makes him sound like fucking Superman.</br></br></br>  <br>I think its just the Moran mindset of nips to work hard for what they want though. For physical demi-gods its a challenge for Gohan to study. he dosent have a challenge physically.<br>Thats probbably the essence of Sayins, they seekout what challenges them.</br></br>  <br>This. Plus listening to how she changes his voice from Dragon Ball to DBZ really adds to Goku's charm since he has the same VA and sounds like he's physically grown.</br>  <br> money making job <br> needing money with all those abilities <br>I'd never even buy a fucking house.</br></br></br>   rewatching cell fight <br> goku not helping gohan when gohans getting beaten <br> says gohan''s about to unleash his true potential as cell's crushing gohan's body <br> piccolo is the one to speak out against gohan's fighting <br> says that he's just an 11 year old boy who doesn't feel like fighting <br> also says he'd rather die then let gohan get beat to death <br> even vegeta questions why goku put his son against the strongest fighter in the universe (currently) <br> goku starts feeling like shit <br><br>why is piccolo so based?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What does Gohan study exactly, anyways? Do we learn about what he actually plans to major in?  <br> Gohan <br>You seemed to have misspelled Krillin.</br></br>  <br>What? Aang was literally training the entire series to fight the Firelord. Just because he didn't want to kill people doesn't mean he was a pacifist. He fought all the time.<br><br>Also Gohan isn't the highest capability fighter. Frieza was the strongest being in the entire galaxy without ever once training a minute in his life. As soon as he did a few months of training his power skyrocketed to God of the universe levels. Another month and he would have been able to beat Beerus and his master and all of the Z fighters at the same time.</br></br></br>  At the very least you have to give Chi Chi props for keeping a leash on his monkey ass, its commendable how she managed to have more of an influence on his life than Goku.  <br>You can spot that by even comparing Goten and Goku's voices in the latest episode. It's not as nuanced as people think.</br>  <br> Marine biology </br>  <br>Aang was a complete pacifist. he hated violence. i can't think of a single time when he Wanted to hurt anyone. Even in the final few epps he questiones his ability to fight Ozai as he didn't want to hurt him. just stop the evil.</br>  <br>Well it helps that Nozawa's pretty good at her job.</br>  <br>I think you could say he also had a shitty childhood, almost dying on numerous occasions because he had to fight, not because he wanted to or did it for sport.</br>  <br>Gohan never needed such hard leash to begin with. Gohan cried he wanted cooked food when all he had was an apple when at his age Goku was hunting dinosaurs.<br><br>If anything Chichi is to blame, she spoiled Gohan.</br></br></br>  <br>You know, people always bitch about Gohan being pointless or a waste, but honestly Gohan is doing what he always wanted to be, become a scholar. Even when he was younger as a child Bulma asks him "do you wanna grow up and be strong like your dad?" no, I wanna be a scholar!<br><br>Now there is a way to make Gohan relevant, and powerful, since he is becoming a scholar, he has intellect. It would be great if they wrote him in as becoming this brilliant tactician or able to create new moves that would help him out even against super strong foes. Using his knowledge and strength to his advantage.<br><br>I dunno, figure out some method to absorb a ki blast shot at him and then blast it back ten fold?<br><br>Im going to place bets that Gohan will stumble across something that tells the gang about the new big bad or whatever, or after they meet Beerus Gohan gets the chance to talk to Whis or even go to the grand kai planet to study some who knows. <br><br>Its not that far fetched, the grand kai's know him, and I could see him going to another world like his dad to train, but with his mind, and find out all kinds of super awesome techniques or history of the universe and time.<br><br>But most likley they will just make him stupid like his damn dad and power struggle weaker then the big bad and goku saves the day. Don't care, long as Super isn't like Z I am fine, I want it to be like Dragon Ball, tired of the power level raising shit. In Freeza F or whatever they state that Goku and Vegita are hitting their ceiling with power.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In Freeza F or whatever they state that Goku and Vegita are hitting their ceiling with power. <br>And for the second time are shoving they must work together, Toriyama is planning ahead something this time.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127763072 <br>Maybe kamehameha has more punch.</br>  <br> Saves the world with his girlfriend on a daily basis </br>  You know what stumps me still?<br>How the fuck did Goku and Chichi conceive Goten with Chichi surviving? Is their sex literally Goku going to sleep while she rides him or something?<br><br><br> couldn't beat the androids <br>That's because he was literally crippled by a disease that kills him in a different timeline.<br> couldn't beat cell <br>I still feel that the only reason he couldn't was because of Gohan. The training seemed directed at improving Gohan above all with Goku wanting Gohan to meet his full potential or some shit.<br> only beat buu because of Vegeta, Satan, and literally every living thing on earth <br>Almost like that's the point of the spirit bomb or something, right?<br> couldn't beat Beerus even as a god himself <br>And considering the only other being confirmed for being able to beat Beerus is Whis, this is a shoddy point.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Man <br> Part alien scum <br>Pick one.</br></br></br>  What if Goku had fused with Gohan instead of Vegeta?  <br>No its not.<br>Game storylines are never canon, even if the original author is involved, because the nature of games means the story is only to fill gaps between gameplay.<br>War for Cybertron and fall of Cybertron were part of the "continuity" of transformers prime, but it was clearly established that the games weren't canon, just another telling of some basic events.<br>Games are like side stories.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In real life, Chi is actually used to enhance sex in order to make it pleasurable for both partners. It's possible that Goku and Vegeta being so fucking strong is actually helping their wives survive.</br>  <br>That would be fucked in the head</br>  <br>Ya that makes sense, thats prolly why Goten and Trunks could turn super sayjin. Vegita raped Trunks and Gohan raped Goten.</br>  <br>Why you niggers pretend they are destroying planets when they shit?<br>They can measure their strength, Krillin almost broke Goku skull with a rock when he was not paying attention and he was vulnerable to the laser gun because he let his guard down.</br></br>  <br>Gotta actually say I was surprised at Goku's jap voice, it was pretty damn good, but Sean Schemmel as him and Vegeta and Piccolo by Christopher_Sabat, are gosh darn fantastic</br>  <br> strongest man in the world <br> can't even beat accelerator <br>*sigh* when will dbz babbies learn</br></br></br>  <br>That would be wincest.</br>  <br>NARWHALS NARWHALS SWIMMING THROUGH THE OCEAN</br>  <br>a stronger, smarter version of Vegeto really. without the cockyness. and considdering it was Mystic Gohan could have become pretty ruthless.<br>I remember reading somehwere that the higher level of SSJ a sayin goes the more ruthless they become, also from the dub actors interview he made his voice deeper for each level. to show a more serious note. i like that, the more monkey you go, the more monkey you go</br></br>  Has it been said whether Goten have the same potential Gohan had?  <br>They have to power up you know.<br>When they have their children turned all the way down, they're only a few times stronger than a peak human.<br>And chichi had training too.</br></br></br>    <br>TFS voices will always be in my head</br>  So I'm correct that Super takes place before BotG?<br><br>Does that mean goku won't surpass beerus in it?</br></br>  <br>Mr Satan is married?</br>  <br>I don't think ki is going to prevent Chichi's pelvis from being utterly destroyed the first time Goku thrust into her<br><br><br> Goku take a shit <br> Constipated <br> Pushes so hard he goes SSGSS and shits so hard he turns the bathroom into a creator <br>I'm laughing way harder than I should be.<br> Seriously though, even without going SSJ or anything, the dude trains hard and it's a bit harder to control yourself in such a situation <br><br><br> Chichi had training <br>That has been ignored since getting preg with Gohan. Possibly even before that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How does Chichi train herself to prepare for Goku's supercock?<br>Does she use one of those jackhammers I've seen where they replace the drill with a dildo?</br></br>  <br>Oh yes, let's give everyone the power to blow up the fucking planet, how smart.</br>  <br>Super will span both movies 14 and 15 and keep going. We don't how long after but it's possible that Goku may reach Beerus.</br>  <br> How the fuck did Goku and Chichi conceive Goten with Chichi surviving? <br>The same way you're able to hold a baby without crushing it to death, or open a door without slamming it off it's hinges.<br><br><br><br><br>It isn't even about being powered up or down, even though they're aliens, I'm still sure they have dexterity.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> ki <br>It's chi, and it'll affect her body too. Almost like a seatbelt.</br></br>  <br>who's mark</br>  <br>Future Gohan just showed how poor of a write akira is because he should have been able to beat androids. He still had his hidden power and it said he fought androids multiple times which should have give him powerups.</br>  <br> not knowing mark <br>Back to /v/</br></br>  <br> That has been ignored since getting preg with Gohan. Possibly even before that. <br>Except it wasn't. she trained with Goten. took a SSJ kick to the face. pretty sure her pussy could take a dick thats being controlled strength</br></br>  <br>Because he knows he's coming home to this</br>  <br>Muffin button!</br>  Would you date a Sayin woman Anon?<br> Always out tranning <br> Rarely comes home <br> When she is home is on Heat <br> Eats out your whole kitchen </br></br></br></br>  <br>Ki and chi are pronounced the same and used interchangeably, you fucking idiot.</br>  <br>Only gunna say this once, oh and please remember who her dad was</br>  <br>Goku isn't a manchild in the manga. It's Toei that refuses to let him grow up.</br>  <br><br>They would never get that strong. Unless you cite Roshi blowing up the moon gag as an actual feat, he's a renowned master that can only blow up a small mountain that drains him. King Piccolo could only blow up a city that drains him. The human Z Warriors are outliers.</br></br>  <br> Goten <br>Not really an impressive feat.<br>Goten and the Trunks of that time were utter jokes of characters and even Gotenks is a fucking joke.</br></br></br>  <br> ki an chi <br> pronunciation the same <br><br>No. Prior to about the 18th century, Mandarin used a heavily aspirated k sound, sort of like khi (thanks Legge, now get back in the box) or, in archaic Wade-Giles, k'i. This changed to a heavily aspirated ch sound, which is written as ch'i (W-G), chhi (Simplified Wade), or qi (hanyu pinyin). "Khi" is close to ki, but still differs in how you have to intone it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Roshi blowing up the moon gag <br><br>What the fuck are you saying? He actually did blow up the moon.</br></br></br>  <br> Had Buu on the ropes for a lil bit <br> Could 2v1 18 when using arms or legs only <br> Could arguably still Kamehameha the earth <br>Even in his base he was stronger then any DB villan.<br>I agree though, Dbz isnt very well written, but its still fun</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>18 is stronger.</br>  <br>At the end of the day none of it makes sense.<br>The first major villans could kill planets. and in comparison of where DBZ ended they would be fodder even for Krillin to take out.</br></br>  <br>Half robot, that does not count.</br>  <br> even Krillin <br> not realising that Krillin is pretty fucking strong </br></br>  <br>I wrote Yamcha first, but i doubted it myself to much</br>  <br>Roshi actually did blow up the moon, it's just that moons in the Dragon Ball universe are a lot more fragile than ours.</br>  <br>That's his charm, his strength and his shield, because Goku is Goku</br>  Who could beat Freza by the end of DBZ? like Namek 100% Freza in a 1v1  <br> Raditz takes Goku sacrificing himself to beat <br> Nappa and Vegita literally have plants stronger than Raditz <br> Freiza's powerlevel is over 500k <br> Cell's was over 10m <br>It's hilarious how much shit scales. Every new big bad is like an MMO expansion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's an outlier. Note Piccolo being wiped out after destroying a city. <br><br><br> it's just that moons in the Dragon Ball universe are a lot more fragile than ours. <br><br>You're an idiot.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You realize they were just sparring right? Goten obviously wasn't even close to going all out at all.<br>Chi-Chi probably can't hope to come even within .01 percent of Goten's power, but she can still teach him martial arts.</br></br>  <br>Its not very well thought out when you think about it. by rights the anons saying Goku having a hard shit should split the planet in half. how can your punch be strong enough to wipe out solar systems. but still have a gentle enough grip to hold onto glass cups?</br>  <br>Gohan killed him in one punch in the Gogeta movie, but that's not canon. I'd say Piccolo and 18 could for sure, not sure about Krillan or Tien but they might.</br>  <br>I don't know why everyone wants Raditz to come back, he's the most pathetic character in existence.<br> Don't train your tail, even though Goku did when he was like 10 <br> Get beaten by two people a hundred times weaker than you <br> Your own comrades deem you too shit to wish back to life <br>By the end of Z, Yamcha would literally be able to beat him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch the scene then.<br>Goten went SSJ by accident out of frustration and anger during the tranning. and the kick hardly hurt Chi Chi, i agree its shit teir writing. but im here for the yelling anyway</br></br>  <br>Krillin is actually the strongest man on earth if you think about it</br>  <br> On you silly Anon, they're not pronounced the same <br> They are merely pronounced very similarly <br><br>Nigga you for real</br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet if Yamcha and Raditz somehow met they'd become great friends.</br>  <br>but he's literally not powered up</br>  <br>Just checked the manga, Piccolo shows no signs of fatigue after blowing up the city.</br>  Doc is here now. I prescribe five times the dosage for all of you.  <br>They can lower their ki to the single digits. They're not masking their ki, they're actually lowering it.</br>  <br><br><br>Wasn't Krillins destructo Disk able to cut anything? by rights he should be able to beat anyone other then Buu, as buu was not a solid. and Cell I guess. who had bullshit Regen hax. who claimed it was because of Namekian blood. yet im pretty sure they can hardly even regen organs</br></br></br>  <br>Do you think Krillin teases Tien about the Namekian boost he got?</br>  <br>Anyone that doesn't dodge when he screams out the attack name. It would've been amazing if Nappa had actually tried to tank it and died then and there.</br>  <br>You mean Tenshinhan?</br>  <br>I seem to remember perfect cell tanking a kienzan just after he transformed one of the few episodes I watched</br>  <br><br>Don't they have to Physically concentrait REALLY hard to do that?<br>E.g. When Gohan and Krillin were hiding from Freeza, Zarbon and Ddoria. they had to try really hard to lower their Ki levels<br>E.g.2 When Goku was recovered he almost threw Chichi into space didnt he?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Destructo Disk is a plot device. It cuts what the narrative needs to be cut. Nothing more.</br>  <br>Namekian boost presumably put Krillin on another level.</br>  Counting the new movies<br>1. Whis<br>2. Beerus<br>3. Golden Freeza<br>4. SSGSS Goku<br>5. SSGSS Vegeta<br><br>Counting the manga only<br>1. Super Vegetto<br>2. Super Buu (Gohan + Goten + Trunks + Piccolo)<br>3. Super Buu (Gotenks + Piccolo)<br>4.

No Mandarin speakers alive pronounce qi as khi. That was the state of affairs back in the 1700s. They use the heavily-aspirated ch instead (chee). You likely got thrown by the end note about how even in the archaic reading, you'd still have to mind your tone and aspiration (ki isn't exactly super-aspirated).</br>  <br>He was already drastically underpowered compared to Tenshinhan before Namek, so all that boost did was bring him to the same or slightly below level as him.</br>  <br>Yamcha isnt the strongest man</br>  <br>If Roshi blew up the moon, why was it still there when Gohan was growing up? They wish the moon back off stage? Piccolo then blows it up AGAIN? Guys, cut the moon a break here, it works hard maintaining the tides and you just keep blowing that shit up to suit your convenience.</br>  <br>I think so but that's really only when the plot demands it. I seem to remember when they were hiding it was Krillan telling Gohan to lower his ki because Gohan was still a babby and hadn't trained as extensively at it and the Goku thing is just him being a doof.</br>  thinking of watching dbz again. should i bother watching every episode or follow the fillerguide?  <br> gohanstruefather.jpg </br>  <br><br> trains 13 years <br> still cant beat thd androids <br><br>B L U N D E R<br>L<br>U<br>N<br>D<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ultimate gohan was stronger than the buu he fought though</br>  <br>Kami removed Goku's tail and put the moon back when Goku started training with him.</br>  <br> If Roshi blew up the moon, why was it still there when Gohan was growing up? <br>Bro, Gohan's moon was a hologram created by a fallen Saiyan spaceship.<br><br>...<br><br>I didn't realize how retarded that was until I watched myself type it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 3. Golden Freeza <br> 4. SSGSS Goku <br> 5. SSGSS Vegeta <br>Maybe if you're talking a Goldie who actually trained, but SSGSS Vegeta won that fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit I think I remember that what the fuck</br>  <br>Watch every episode, but keep in mind what's filler and what isn't. Even the filler is kind of fun.</br>  <br>In terms of the peak Golden Freeza hits, it's higher than SSGSS Goku and Vegeta. He was able to outclass Goku after both of them transformed, though it didn't last.<br><br>Freeza's issue is making his Golden transformation last without consuming huge amounts of energy.</br></br></br>  So Cooler was stronger then Freza right?<br>What if he trained? here have another movie Toriyama.<br>Lets litteraly bring back eveyr single Villan, and say they just came back to life and trained for a month. and can now rival the Gods of destruction</br></br>  <br>He didn't train with Goku in the hyperbolic time chamber. Didn't get the same training.</br>  <br>Eh. He never got any decent zenkais until the one that blew off his arm, and that just undid it altogether.<br>Nobody to train with either until Trunks came around.</br></br>  <br>Right? I think it was something they did for the 90s dub? I mean shit, I think the thing about Kami putting the moon back is correctly from the manga, but I def remember the moon hologram.</br>  <br>You realize that it grew back, right? The moon grew back.</br>  <br> Lets litteraly bring back eveyr single Villan, and say they just came back to life and trained for a month. and can now rival the Gods of destruction <br>My uncle works for Toei and Cell with SSGSS aura will be one of the other universes' Gods of Destruction.</br></br>  <br>Oi nah how about this for a villain<br>Majin Buu's brother<br>He can be a different colour and everything</br></br></br>  <br>cooler was noncanon in the first place.</br>  <br>The problem is it's slow and hard to control. <br><br>Freeza was able to pull off a similar technique, but Goku dodged it easily.<br><br>It's a technique that trades accuracy for cutting power. Not very reliable.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think Piccolo blew up the moon while training Gohan and then the hologram happened and he was all "What the fuck I blew that shit up" and then found the saiyan pod and then blew that up. I could be wrong though.</br>  What are the chances of us seeing again Raditz or launch in super?  <br> If he did he would be the strongest in the series <br>No he wouldn't, old Kai raised his powerlevel to his limit already, he can't get stronger than mystic level since he's not a true saiyan.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but why not just activate the disc at close range or something? Why not just augment your punches and kicks with that shit?</br>  <br><br>Compare his second blast in chapter 159. Goku even notes his power was low.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but who you were not<br>I Agree. grab their wrist first. load up the disk in other hand and bam.<br>Also im pretty sure it was used in combination with Solar flair. one of the most useful techniques back in the day</br></br></br>  <br>Back to /v/</br>  <br><br><br><br>Here's how it goes<br> Roshi blows up the moon to change Goku back to normal <br> God brings it back and removes Goku's tail <br> Gohan sees the moon and transforms, and Piccolo blows it up to change him back to normal <br> FILLER EPISODE: Goku's Saiyan ship projects a hologram that transforms Gohan again, and Piccolo destroys it <br>And it ended up being a bad decision because they say that Goku's ship is used to create the ship Goku takes to Namek.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Protip: Everyone who claims to unlock your true potential in Dragon Ball are vastly over-selling their ability<br>It happened to Goku like three times, and mystic Gohan was the second time Gohan's potential was 'fully unlocked'</br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x4g<wbr>HZP4xRPM</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>this was such a cool moment</br></br></br>  <br>Videl's pussy is just too good, maybe...?</br>  <br>I remember when DB was more about tactics than power levels. Those were funner times.</br>  <br/>  <br>Wouldn't that be from fighting Goku?</br>  <br><br>Maybe Raditz is still alive in Universe 6</br></br>  <br> Before Goku even grew up, he was taught by Popo how to fight without sight. <br> Long into Dragon Ball Z, blinding people is a viable way to stop them <br>Little inconsistencies like this annoy me</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, like Krillin and Goku's fight<br>Oh wait...<br> Krillin uses every tactic in the book and outwits Goku at every turn <br> Goku still wins because stronk </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan only trained because trunks told them about the androids.<br>Otherwise, three years off</br></br>  <br>nice meme</br>  <br>When did anyone other than the Z Fighters ever use blinding as a fighting technique? Fucking never, that's when.</br>  <br>Remember when Trunks shattered the piccolo statue and he somehow managed to regen from that? That was some serious bullshit.</br>  Nice Buu and Piccolo fusing would be the best thing that could happen in super  <br><br>No, it's right after he just destroyed the city with a single blast. That is what drained his power, and he does the second almost immediately afterwards. Try reading it.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Z fighters were able to use that shit on warriors far more advanced than them, when even Popo knew how to counter it.</br>  <br>I think its just a panic technique, sure you don't need eyes to see. but go mid fight using them very heavily to sudden blindness and you probbably don't have a clear head, not excusing the shit writing but yeah</br>  <br>You talk like they used it all the time. I recall Solar Flare being used exactly twice.</br>  <br><br>That's more of a case of you not knowing what you're talking about. Solar Flare + suppressing your ki is what Cell did to get away. Freeza and the other bad guys on Namek couldn't sense ki without scouters.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12776703 <br>Actually, Tien's fight with Drum and part of Goku's fight with PIccolo occur betweent eh two blasts<br>As well, Piccolo's second blast (the one that made him tired) wasn't made to destroy the city, but was made to destroy Goku. As such, it could be assumed it was the intensity of the blast (being such a level to kill Goku) rather than the size of it that tired Piccolo.</br></br>  <br>He's smart<br>He wants poon<br>He wants to provide for his family</br></br></br>  <br>Those are both completely different things.</br>  <br> the entire show just kept promoting how badass Gohan was going to be by showing hints of his incredible power and how he was able to keep up with people way older than him <br> then the Buu saga happened </br></br>  <br>Its used on Vegeta, Dodoria and the Z warriors.<br><br>That's nice pal, but Popo's training focused on air movement, noise etc. not ki.</br></br></br>  <br>Well excuuuuuse me, princess. I guess they used Solar Flare 3 times, not 2.</br>  <br>that lucky fuck</br>  <br> Popo's training focused on air movement, noise etc. not ki. <br><br>It was a retreating tactic, moron. And you seem to think because someone's strong means they're more skilled than the weaker.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not an inconsistency. Goku demonstrates fighting without light in the Buu Saga.<br><br>I think its real power later on is less that it blinds you and more that it's so bright it's physically painful.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't claim it was some canon-destroying plothole, just a little inconsistency that annoyed me, much like Raditz not training his tail, and Goku not thinking that he would have.</br>  <br> Tien on Roshi <br> Tien on Goku <br> Goku on Tiens <br> Goku on Vegeta <br> Krillin on Dodoria <br> Krillin on Frieza <br> Cell on Piccolo/Trunks/Krillin <br> Cell on Trunks <br><br>Off the top of my head that's every time it's used.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Its a retreating tactic <br>And the blinded person can't follow the retreating one because?<br>And can you give me an example where fighting prowess isn't directly tied to 'power levels'?<br><br>Yeah, that could be right, I'd have to go and look at the examples of when they use it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Picabuu</br>  <br> And the blinded person can't follow the retreating one because? <br> disorientation from being blinded <br> pain from being blinded <br> not being able to see from their primary mode of seeing <br> not having enough time to concentrate  <br>I swear, this series really brings out the most retarded people.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Disorientation from blinding <br> Not being able to see from their primary mode of seeing <br>These all rely on the idea that YOU CAN"T 'SEE' WHEN YOUR EYES AREN'T WORKING<br>Goku at least, was specifically trained so he could, and you'd assume other top-level warriors would be the same.<br><br>The only real point you have was the pain. I can't decide if you're a braindead DBZ fan that defends everything or just one of the countless bitter citizens of /a/.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How did vegeta even get ssjg in the new movie?  <br>not him, but you seem to be completly and purposly ignoring the fact its a shock technique. meant to dissorentate someone. like getting poked in the eyes. you aren't thinking. "ok shit gotta follow their ki" your thinking "Shit, i just got poked in the fuking eyes"</br>  <br>GoGos bizarre adventure</br>  <br> he never played .hack </br>  <br>That's unrelated, we're not talking Cross media projects, we're talking adaptations</br>  <br><br>Goten is still the best character<br><br> When I was 11 I cosplayed as Goten </br></br></br></br>  <br>And what is the point of learning techniques where you don't need to see your opponent, when you are too shocked to do anything if you can't see your opponent?</br>  <br> Top 3 strongest human <br> Krilin <br> Tenshinhan <br> Yamcha <br> Chaozu <br> Roshi </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Roshi <br> not strongest <br><br>Pleb. He is the strongest wisest human on earth.<br>And he wears a cool as fuck shell.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its a wonder more students haven't come to be trained by him, considering Krillin had heard of him from Orin Temple.</br>    <br><br>Because he very picky with accepting students, don't you remember how he jerked goku and krilin off until he accepted them?</br></br>  <br>He isn't Jotaro you fucking nigger</br>  <br>I don't think that means what you think it means</br>  <br>Technically the cyborgs are the strongest humans</br>  <br>I don't think Goku had any trouble, and Krillin just had to show him some girlie mags.</br>    <br><br>I'm too lazy to look up the pages, but people where shocked when they heard Roshi trained them.<br>Like "That well known master?What how.." etc.</br></br></br>  <br>But he didn't get 18.</br>  Hopefully in super videl gets killed and he gets buttmad and go ssj3.  I want Akira to make Krillin and Piccolo relevant again.  <br>Technically, cyborbs/androids are not human</br>   I'm adressing you Bulmoose!   <br>I thought it was said Gohan was stronger than Super Buu Picolo</br>  The problem with Gohan is that he should've realized after Cell that if anything happens HE should be the prime fighter to defend the planet.<br><br>Just train on this principle, to be defender.<br><br>I guess they would've went this way if editors didn't force Toriyama to bring Goku back.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ss3 gotenks isn't stronger than goku in ss3.</br>  <br> save wife and daughter from falling tower <br> wife has that "tonight, you" look on her face <br><br>How can one loser end up so lucky?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Piccolo has stated that so long as his head is intact, he still regenerate.<br>Toriyama did this with Cell, but managed to fuck it up for the sake of raising drama.</br></br></br>  <br>3.

To save the series he was basically kicked out of the main gang and the silly tournament arc hapened.</br>  here is a question, not trying to start a powerlevel discussion here, mostly because it doesnt matter with gods anymore<br><br>but when radditz scanned an average human farmer his powerlevel was 7<br><br>what is the unit equal to?<br><br>some shitty alien that is 7x weaker than an average old farmer?<br><br>a rather large rabbit?<br><br>a small to medium sized dog?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Equal to an average middle aged earthling male</br>  <br>It doesn't mean anything, its a silly way to gauge how scared the audience needed to be of certain villains<br><br>because when 2 characters can both shoot off ridiculously large explosions you need a new way to demonstrate who's stronger</br></br></br>  <br>so that average middle aged earthling male was actually 7 average middle aged earthling males in an average middle aged earthling male suit?</br>  <br> Yes. </br>  <br>This<br>If someone says shit like this, it just means the plot requires you to be stronger right now.</br></br>  Becuse he doesn't want to be like his father who wasted all of his wife's fortune in food, he wants to buy his own food.  <br>Only goku that mastered that jutsu</br>  <br>Because he doesnt like fighting.<br>Are you that fucking new?</br></br>  <br>God damn, I want to enjoy these threads but I just know 89% of you are fucking uneducated Spics.</br>  <br> had his full potential unlocked, twice <br> people wonder why he doesn't train <br>He already peaked. He can't get stronger.</br></br></br>  <br>Average person's power level is 5-7.<br>Raditz is about 1200-1500, goku and piccolo at the time were about 500 each.<br>Vegeta was about 18,000 in the saiyan saga<br>Freiza and SS1 Goku were in the neighborhood of 1000000<br>After that, all the super saiyan forms ruin any sense of scale.</br></br></br></br></br>  WHERE<br><br>IS<br><br>UUB</br></br></br></br>  <br>He can do good things with his brain too like cure cancer or some shit.</br>  So what is this Super thing? Is it a reboot of some kind? I've read the manga many years ago, but I've never seen any of the anime.  <br> Where is the Flip OC character <br>Nowhere thank god.</br></br>  So which sub is not shit will continue subbing it and not dropping it 300 episode later  <br>Because the show has to be about Goku. We can't create some sense of progression by having Goku's son take over for him. Goku has to be the strongest.<br><br>It's also totally in character for Gohan not to be like Goku or Vegeta with the training and Videl is a pretty good reason to get married.</br></br></br>  <br>Uub will be 10 years old 9,5 years after DBS episode 1.</br>  I hate all the fucks who keep saying OVER 9000 like it's some strong shit.<br><br>I mean they have obviously watched the show up to Buu then why would they keep talking about Goku's power level when Vegetal first shows up as anything even close to powerful?</br></br>  <br>you are disconnected from reality, perhaps actual autism.<br><br>I don't think this needs to be spelled out, but it's a joke. <br><br>I hope you're a troll, but if you are you are a pretty shit one, because you inspire pity rather than anger.</br></br></br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Frieza was stronger than Buu and Cell and that the reason robo-Frieza jobbed so hard was clearly that they put him back together with literal garbage from a garbage can.

Wouldn't surprise me if Toriyama had planned the red hair as the next saiyan stage since a long time ago.</br>  <br>pretty much yes.</br>  <br> not canon </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vls<wbr>jjBvBacE</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>If Toriyama barely could remember that SSJ3 existed, what makes you think he'd remember something about GT?</br>  Why are we all wasting our talents on /a/?  best joke characters  <br> Frieza was stronger than Buu and Cell <br>He was a better character but not a stronger fighter thanks to the series' ridiculous power creep</br></br>  <br> don't you remember how he jerked goku and krilin off until he accepted them? </br>  <br><br>Old Kai even claims to raise it ABOVE the maximum level.</br></br>  <br>What about Uub?<br>Isn't he reborn as a human?</br></br>  <br>I don't remember, was it revealed that he have greater potential than Goku?</br>  maybe he wants to spend his time reading books and not being a hermit like tein or roshi  <br>The only good thing come out of GT is SS4.</br>  I really hope future trunks is in the other universe they end up going to he's the best saiyan. Kid trunks sucks.  <br>Videls new look might not be better than her old tomboy design, but its definitely on par.</br>  <br>What if the buu saga was written by araki</br>  <br>Everyone would shocked and sweated a lot.<br>Also everyone would have the same face.</br></br>  Reminder that Goku is worse than Gon's father.  <br> same face meme <br> when talking about dragon ball </br></br>  <br> meme <br>Many of the later Araraki artwork have samefaces.<br>Not that I'm saying that DB doesn't have samefaces.</br></br></br>  <br>Videl had her killed.</br>  <br> when at his age Goku was hunting dinosaurs. <br><br>Goku at Gohan's age was in a fucking pod until they sent him to Earth.<br><br>Granted, the dinosaur hunting came shortly after.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>As far as I know, he's a widower.<br><br>His wife had an archangel's name or something.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm pretty sure Toriyama was consulted for some parts of GT and even fully collaborated at some points <br><br>Wrong.<br><br>He was never involved aside of some character designs and artwork.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, but he's Buu's reincarnation.</br>  <br> implying piccolo can make gohan do anything he doesn't want to do <br><br>Do you even power levels?</br></br></br>  <br>goku&gt;* <br>get over it faggot.</br></br>  <br>Yes,</br>  <br> being this wrong </br>  <br>Quads confirm even though Cooler will never be cannon.</br>  <br>Toriyama uses DBO as canon you fag</br>  <br>if you could bang videl you would give up your training too</br>  <br>It's fucking Piccolo though.</br>  <br><br>Golden Frieza is stronger.<br><br>The problem was that he wasn't used to his transformation yet and got drained pretty fast.<br><br>Next time read the subs, don't just watch the pictures moving on your screen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan would listen to his dad.</br>  <br>hope he fights in that waistcoat. Looks sick</br>  <br>for anyone that would actually give PTSD. I can probably bet you anything Gohan wakes up with night terrors.</br>  <br>How educated are you, fagmerican? Let me break you. I am in the mood for it.</br>  <br>Manga<br> Super Vegetto <br> Super Buu (Gohan + Goten + Trunks + Piccolo) <br> Base Vegetto <br> Ultimate Gohan <br> Super Buu (Gotenks + Piccolo) <br> Super Buu (Goten + Trunks + Piccolo) <br> SSJ3 Gotenks <br> Super Buu <br> SSJ Gotenks <br> SSJ3 Goku <br> Original Majin Buu <br> Gotenks <br> Kid Buu &gt;= Evil Buu <br> Mr. Buu/Good Buu/the Buu who ends up joining the Z warriors and is Mr. Satan's life-partner at the end <br> SSJ2 Vegeta <br> SSJ2 Goku <br> Dabura <br> SSJ2 Gohan <br> Kibitokai <br><br>I see no reason to assume Kid Buu was any stronger than Evil Buu. Also, I think Gohan was a smidge above Gotenks Buu in raw power, but Gotenks Buu had regeneration and that allowed him to wear Gohan down, similar to Piss Frieza getting tired after being double-teamed by the Blue Saiyan Group.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Technically he didn't train with Goku so he didn't get as strong. You know who could've beaten the androids though? Piccolo, if he had fused with Kami before he was killed then he would've wrecked them with ease.</br>  <br>Why is purified Buu lower than SSJ3 Goku when Goku couldn't beat him without a hueg Genki Dama?</br>  <br> Gotenks <br> Kid Buu &gt;= Evil Buu <br><br>ayy lmao<br><br>Kid Buu is stronger than any Fat Buu and on par with Super Buu because the more evil he is the stronger he is, that's how his magic works. Yes, M A G I C. Magic doesn't have to make logical sense.<br><br>Good Buu became weaker than Evil Buu because Evil Buu was, you guessed it, evil. I'm not making this up Kaioshin flat out says Buu LOST POWER when he absorbed Dai Kaiou, not just because his form became goofy for fighting, but because it got so much good in him his base power level was nerfed to all hell.<br><br><br>Even if Goku could kinda keep up with Kid Buu, SSJ3 wastes tons of ki. It's a highly impractical form.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku said he could have beaten Fat Buu while he was Super Saiyan 3, but chose not to so he could give Goten and Trunks a chance. The pure Majin Buu is the weakest because he doesn't have any of the power of his absorptions. What makes him dangerous is his insane and unpredictable nature.<br><br><br> I see no reason to assume Kid Buu was any stronger than Evil Buu <br>I initially thought that, assuming that Evil Buu was basically Kid Buu in terms of evil, but that's not the case. I'm guessing that Fat Buu's power was split in half between Mr. Buu and Evil Buu, but Evil Buu could outclass Mr. Buu's innocent nature.<br>Basically<br> Fat Buu = Mr. Buu (dominant) + Evil Buu <br> Super Buu = Evil Buu (dominant) + Mr. Buu <br>Which is why Super Buu is more dangerous than Fat Buu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kid Buu <br> On par with Super Buu <br><br>Not power level wise no. The reason why Kid Buu looks powerful because he has no conscience and will just blow up planets willy nilly. Super Buu actually has cognition, so he can actually make rational decisions. Also Goku at SSJ3 was fighting on par with Kid Buu until he ran out of stamina.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because fucking idiots.<br><br>Kid/Purified Buu was so much bullshit, he was fun. Literally spent the entire time dicking around during his fight against Goku.<br><br>Why anyone assumes he's that damn low, is beyond me.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rational decisions <br> Literally getting fucking stomped by Vegetto <br> Even as a fucking candy <br><br>You need to rewatch the series you retard.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> looks powerful because he has no conscience and will just blow up planets willy nilly. <br><br>Yeah OK. Let me guide you to your containment forum:<br><br>http://www.kanzenshuu.com/forum/<br><br>Until we talk about stuff explicitly stated in the fucking manga, please take all of the time you need and stay there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>give me the thing</br>  <br/>  <br> If Toriyama barely could remember that SSJ3 <br>That was super saiyan 2 just like how GT forgot about that form as well.</br></br>  <br>Imagine Android 18's PTSD.<br> Having your body cut open and having every one of your bones and organs replaced with a mechanism and processors  <br> Probably while you're still conscious  <br> Probably after spending the last four weeks watching the same thing being done to your brother, knowing it'll be your turn next </br></br></br></br>  <br> All because some old guy wants revenge on some other guy you don't even know <br> And then finding out you were never even meant to fight him <br> You were just fodder to fuel an even stronger bio-organism </br></br></br>  Why don't they just consistently half-kill each other for power-ups?  <br> I initially thought that, assuming that Evil Buu was basically Kid Buu in terms of evil, but that's not the case. I'm guessing that Fat Buu's power was split in half between Mr. Buu and Evil Buu, but Evil Buu could outclass Mr. Buu's innocent nature. <br>Okay, that makes sense. I'll readjust my thoughts on the matter accordingly.</br></br>  <br>Zenkai boosts ended up having diminishing returns.</br>  <br>Being 18 is suffering. <br> And then marrying a cute short guy that loves you for who you are, not what you've become <br>But not too much suffering.</br></br></br>  <br> marrying a manlet with awful hair <br>Endless suffering.</br></br>   wasting his talent <br>Gohan never had a talent for fighting, just high powerlevel. In terms of actual martial arts skill, he was always bottom tier IMO. Goku even when he was outmatched still put up a damn good fight because of his skill, Gohan just got his ass beat because he couldn't overpower his opponent with sheer powerlevel.</br>  <br>Goku said he could've probably beaten the original Majin Buu but opted to let Trunks and Goten try to do so instead.<br><br>Goku tried to transform into SSJ3 to fight Kid Buu confident that doing so would result in him winning. He wasn't able to gather the energy needed transform because he was now alive. SSJ3 is an incredibly taxing form. Had Goku let Kid Buu kill him (since they're in the afterlife, Goku would've presumably just popped right back there, just like Old Kai when he gave Goku the rest of his life), he'd've been able to go SSJ3 and mop the floor with Kid's little pink ass.</br></br></br>  <br>well he is a prince after all</br>  <br>IN CASE YOU'RE FIGHTING IN THE DARK.</br>  <br>That's just bashing Gohan for no reason. He had good mentors and developed his skill over time. He just doesn't like fighting, that's all.</br>  <br>Pretty much. Gohan always relied on getting those sudden burst of power to fuck things up. Otherwise he's pretty shit.</br>  <br>What? Uh, Gohan was taught by two of the best fighters in the universe how to fight. First Piccolo in preparation for the Saiyans, then Goku and Piccolo in preparation for the androids, and then Goku again in preparation to fight Cell. That's on top of the actual battle experience Gohan has.<br><br>Gohan just didn't have the desire to be the strongest and it was very rare for him to even want to kill someone. Throughout all of Dragon Ball Z, I think the only two characters he wanted dead were Cell and Super Buu. Maybe Frieza too but he never outright stated it like he did to Cell and Super Buu.</br></br></br>  How many times are we getting over this?<br><br>Gohan was turned into weaksauce because due to editors clamoring and popularity polls Goku's removal would've harmed sales.<br><br>Cell saga was supposed to be passing the torch to Gohan, with Goku dying and Gohan finally manning up to defend the earth not because he likes fighting, but because he was the strongest defender left.<br><br>Go read up on this, whole Buu saga was supposed to be from Gohan's perspective</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>do you think she vibrates while inside her womb? :3</br>  <br> Gohan was taught by two of the best fighters in the universe how to fight. <br>Which makes it even more pathetic how garbage he is.<br><br>If you actually look back on every single one of Gohan's canonical fights, he's never displayed in actual feats of skill. He's always relied on just getting power ups to outclass the opponent, not outskill them. The saiyans, freezer, cell, buu, all the same fucking story.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about the in-universe perspective.<br><br><br>Neither did Vegeta. And honestly, neither did anyone after the World Tournaments in Dragon Ball. Guldo was the last character to try to win by tactics, and he got rekt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku never fought Super Buu.<br>Goku and Vegeta fought Super Buu with 3 people absorbed, yes.<br><br>Cuckboi Gohan and Gotenks were the only fighters who fought unfused Super Buu.</br></br></br></br>  <br>N-No, Gohan is awesome..<br><br> Saiyans <br> gets his ass kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds before almost getting killed <br>H-He was just a kid..<br><br> Freiza <br> gets his kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds then almost gets killed <br>H-He was the strongest in the universe, it's unfair..<br><br> Cell <br> gets his ass kicked for 10 episodes then gets super powerup to be cool then gets his arm blow off <br>I-It was a cheap shot..<br><br> Buu <br> gets blown up and nearly killed, comes back with super ultra mega powerup then goes retard and lets buu get better powerup <br> gets his ass kicked hard <br>I-I don't know..<br><br>G-Gohan is pro.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Neither did Vegeta <br>Besides that whole matching Goku blow for blow in an even fist fight.</br></br>  <br>How does that demonstrate skill rather than raw power?</br>  <br>Because the power is meaningless when both guys have the same power. Although Goku was holding back his power level, he wasn't holding back on the fighting. It comes down to actual fighting skill and Vegeta was matching Goku.</br>  <br> Saiyans <br> gets his ass kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds before almost getting killed <br><br>Yeah, and he also gave (an albeit weaker) Vegeta a tough time all by his own. Proof that when power levels are equal Gohan doesn't suck.<br><br> Freiza <br> gets his kicked then gets powerup to be cool for 2 seconds then almost gets killed <br>This isn't really fair.<br><br> Cell <br> gets his ass kicked for 10 episodes then gets super powerup to be cool then gets his arm blow off <br>He DIDN'T WANT TO FIGHT. He seriously thought he could convince Cell of a more peaceful alternative.<br><br> Buu <br> gets blown up and nearly killed, comes back with super ultra mega powerup then goes retard and lets buu get better powerup <br>This does not involve any lack of skill you dumbfuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A draw between two people who are equal is not a show of skill. A victory over someone stronger than you is a show of skill. Not that it matters because Goku could've one-shotted Vegeta using his real power if he had actually wanted to.</br>  <br> A draw between two people who are equal is not a show of skill. <br>Yeah, having equal fighting talent to one of the greatest martial artists in the universe is not a show of skill. Are you daft? The fact that they were equal means he's not better than Goku but it shows he's a great fighter in his own right.</br></br>  <br> Goku could've one-shotted Vegeta using his real power if he had actually wanted to. <br>And? That's just powerlevel and not fighting skill which is the whole argument against Gohan.</br></br>  <br>Goku was intentionally holding back. He was matching Vegeta blow-for-blow, not the other way around.<br><br>That fight showed how skilled and restrained Goku could be. It didn't indicate a thing about Vegeta's fighting prowess.</br></br></br>  Boo arcs magical absortion power-ups are the lowest point of the manga. Thankfully that shit was like 5 15-page manga chapters; Toei just extended that trash endlessly.  <br>Goku held back his power level and nothing else. Are you so stupid that can't differentiate between power and skill? I guess Gohan during the Raditz invasion was a more skilled fighter than Goku?</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/wlezAx74bPQ?t=407  [ ]<br><br> Gohan will NEVER be this alpha ever again </br></br>  <br>Goku intentionally going blow-to-blow with Vegeta doesn't indicate anything about Vegeta's skill. I could "fight" a 5-year-old to a draw, too, by mimicking every move they make. Doesn't mean the damned 5-year-old is a good fighter on a technical basis.<br><br>None of them had any real fighting skill when Raditz came. It was still very much amateur hour then.</br></br></br>  <br>Except it does. Goku was fighting at a SSJ2 powerlevel and so was Vegeta, the rest came down to skill. I'm beginning to think you're just a moron.<br><br> None of them had any real fighting skill when Raditz came <br>DBZ babby detected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>he is beyond his max and he had more potential than anyone. goku or any other saiyan we knew at the time becoming stronger is just shit writing</br>  <br><br>Of course he is. He's a manchild that only cares about eating and fighting. He's so dumb he refused to destroy Dr.Gero's lab before he finished the androids because he wanted a good fight.<br><br>For fucks sake he even let his 10 years old son almost die against Cell because "tis gonnbe gut trust me!"</br></br></br></br>  <br> None of them had any real fighting skill when Raditz came <br>Top kek. Literally the arc after Goku became a pro martial artist from training at Kami's.</br></br>  <br>DB was all about skill you fucking invalid, it wasn't this explosion filled nonsense you call a series that it is now.</br>  <br>You're not wrong.</br>  <br>And Earthlings knew fuck all about actual combat then.</br>  <br>did goku even really give a shit about her? he sort of just ignored her most of the time and ran off with a little indian boy</br>  <br>he is tired of fighting, and he saw pointlessness of being the strongest man in the world. and he wants to complete himself as a husband and by starting academic career</br>  <br> half <br>She's not a robot at all. Having a bomb inside your chest (gone now) doesn't make you a robot. The power generator inside her is what makes her a cyborg at all. Her modifications are extremely minor (but that's where her power comes from).</br></br>  <br>Most of the time Gohan would arrive to the scene too late and they'd already be gone. The times he did fight them, they 2-on-1'd him. He had no training partner until Trunks and the only fight against the androids that he received a Zenkai from was the fight were he ended up losing an arm.</br>  Whole Vegeta thing makes no sense.<br><br>Goku was able to keep up with Vegeta because it was<br>High potential/No training vs No potential/High training<br><br>But then Vegeta started to train religiously, why the fuck he didn't keep up with Goku?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Vegeta didn't actually have high potential. He was just born stronger than normal. That's why he was barely in the top 8 of Frieza's men (4 of the 5 Ginyu Force members, Zarbon, and Dodoria were definitely stronger, while Cui was equal).</br>  <br>Goku was a smarter fighter pretty much. Vegeta trained like an animal during the Cell arc but Goku still managed to surpass him by just knowing his limits. Goku knew that training by itself wouldn't make him stronger and he knew he had to let his body relax and adjust to his super saiyan powers. Which is why he stayed in SSJ mode and achieved full powered super saiyan.<br><br>Vegeta just thinks that working yourself to the bone is all it takes, he has a pretty childish mindset on it.</br></br></br>  <br> counting the new movies <br>Why? Super's manga already overrides whatever claim people imagined they had.<br><br> Goku over Vegeta <br>What indicates this? Goku getting taken out by a laser ring? Also, Frieza lost handily. Power drain wasn't the only problem. Frankly, there isn't any good reason why Beerus should be stronger than Goku (or Vegeta considering what SS should do for the 'god' state much less a proper combination of the two). KK's modifier at low levels would be more than enough to make a chump of him. Whis only really has the limited time reversal to fall back on. AT forgetting KK (and changing how SS works) is all that saves these fools.<br><br> Super Buu without Gotenks <br> over Gohan <br>Nope.<br><br> SS3 Goku over Super Buu <br>That fuck couldn't even beat Majin or Kid Buu properly. He was too afraid to actually fight Super Buu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I was fucking furious over this whole Ultimate Gohan shit.<br><br>They spent 20 episodes of some bullshit sword training and going "dis is it Gohan, yur da man now" so he can fucking get jobbed in 5 minutes by Buu.</br></br>  <br> those voices <br> that music </br></br>  <br>I see it as the absolute point of no return for DBZ as a whole.<br><br>The Buu saga up until Gohan jobbed it was fine, it started super strong and had gotten worse, but it was still workable considering the close it was very clearly coming to with ultimate Gohan.<br><br>Then he lost, and you may as well forget the rest of the series because it's not worth reading or watching</br></br></br></br></br>  Why doesn't he just become a professional athlete to provide for his family?  <br> Goku never fought Super Buu <br>He was too scared of him to try it. He simply tossed an energy disk to save Gohan.<br><br> they fought Super Buu with absorptions <br>Stop citing the anime (filler, no less).</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because he isn't Yamcha.</br>  <br>Kinda weird how Uub came into the picture <br> Hey your name is like that bubble gum monster that wanted to destroy our planet, wanna be our friend? <br> Okay </br></br></br>  <br>They have a sense of fair play I guess.</br>  <br> equals in strength can't demonstrate skill <br>You're an idiot.</br></br>  <br>that's some shitty music anon</br>  <br>I don't know about all that, but  Vegeta is undefeated against Goku .</br>   You will never experience being Videl as your loving superhuman husband ravishes you into his cockslave with his SSDICK <br><br>Why live?</br></br>  <br> having to come to term with the fact Gohan will never be the character you want him to be. <br><br>He really reached his peek in Cell saga but in Buu id have to say he was a real sayian</br></br></br>  <br>Super is going to include the events of the movies you fuck</br>  <br>Fuck off faggot</br>  <br>But Vegeta did lose to Gohan.</br>  It blows my mond how strong DBZ is going after all these years.<br><br>Every normalfag I know is fucking watching super, it's bizzare.</br></br>  <br>Gohan absolutely should've won that fight. That was such garbage.</br>  <br>I'll leave when you get some taste.</br>  <br>Plot.<br><br> didn't keep up <br>What are you talking about? Buu saga?

Saiyans are not humans. They don't have to worry about that sort of fatigue (decreasing their power with injuries from strain).<br><br>Goku's training in Other World was clearly not about relaxation (taking full advantage of his corpse and the time flow of his environment allowing for a failed state to sit pretty). Vegeta trained harder and got less of it for having no such advantages to work with (said body and time *aside from masters training him and imparting new techniques*).<br><br> SSJ <br> super saiyan <br>One of these doesn't have a "J" in it. You're speaking English (and we don't need "jin" to know they're people).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> include the <br>Pay attention, boy. The manga (fuck the anime adaptation) already contradicts BoG.

SSJ has been used for ages, it just feels unnatural to suddenly switch to SS.</br></br></br>  <br>I know 12 year old faggiots in my neighborhood that watch dragonball</br>  <br> Yet he always lost to Vegeta in their fights. <br>Only once. Unless you want to count the cheapshot Vegeta threw after their sparring match was over as a victory. If you do, then Krillin beat Goku with a rock and is therefore the best fighter in the universe. Vegeta laments how he's always one step behind Goku constantly, and Whis even brings it up when he's training them.</br></br>  <br>I doubt those kids post on /a/ to complain about Gohan.</br>  <br> Calling 12 year olds faggots <br>You're definitely no older than 14<br><br>They're kids you moron.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Boo arcs magical absortion power-ups are the lowest point of the manga. <br><br> not thinking fusion is the raddest shit <br> not liking the fact that the biggest powerup in the series is thanks to a gag scene <br> not realizing that the powerups were for fun and entertainment and that they won because of teamwork </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> faggiots </br>   Why couldn't Vegeta keep up <br><br>Let's look at their training regimens. Goku trained with someone who everyone thought was god. Then Goku trained with an actual god. Then Goku trained on the god planet where all the gods threw their god trained students at him for years until he was winning every god championship out there.<br><br>Meanwhile Vegeta was training by himself, essentially shadowboxing. Then shadowboxing at 50x gravity. Then shadowboxing at 100x gravity. Then shadowboxing at 200x gravity.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying anything in Dragon Ball has even managed to register as a threat to Penguin Village </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127789220 <br>Kami is just the Pope.</br>  <br>Welp, didn't manage to delete in time.<br><br>I think Kami was just more of a figurehead and he actually had some divine in him else he wouldn't have been allowed to take that place.<br><br>Remember the Kami side of Piccolo immediately sensed Supreme Kai's importance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kami was just more of a figurehead <br>*than a figurehead</br></br>  <br>Goku had like 6 masters that teach him a lot of training regiments while Vegeta only had the one he create for himself.</br>  <br> it has been used incorrectly for a long time <br> makes it okay <br> muh feelings <br>No. Don't you go citing boats either.<br><br><br> only once <br>Allowing for this, did Goku win any of the fights? No? It is as I've said even while humoring you. Vegeta is undefeated against Goku. Canon fact (now and forever).<br><br> count the cheap shot <br>And why not? Goku's fault for being naive. You saying trickery discounts victory in a proper fight? This isn't a sport, son. There are no rules.<br><br> Krillin beat Goku with a rock <br>Why are you citing the anime? Also, Goku wasn't put out of commission by it (in said non-canon, non-fight).<br><br> Whis mentions how Vegeta feels <br>Your point being? Subjective takes don't have to match the objective. Vegeta doesn't even feel like their first fight was his win with Goku left a pile of broken bones. His defeat by Gohan's monkey ass falling on him doesn't even register in his mind. He's wrong, but that's how he sees it (just as he happily takes credit for Nappa's kills *and everyone goes along with it*).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  who /goten/ here?  <br>Krillin beating Goku with a rock was the best fight in the series. Why would you not count it?</br>  <br> no long sleeves <br><br>Not my Goten.</br></br></br>  <br>People use SSJ because SS has a more popular connotation.</br>  <br>a Pete &amp; Pete reference<br><br>is this real life</br></br></br>  <br>He's right, though.</br>  <br>Goku trained under many masters (a few gods). Even got a power-up from Super Kami Water (making his Oozaru power his own at all times). Vegeta got a hand-out (which he kept the boost from) from Babidi and much later finally got an actual trainer through Whis. Vegeta has been on his own for a long while. The most help he's really allowed himself to get is from Bulma's family. Goku gets Other World training (even with a dead body at times). That's an ideal environment that Vegeta just doesn't really have access to normally.<br><br>The gods are not all that impressive in terms of power. Techniques help though (here and there). King Kai's offerings have their times and places. Too bad KK is forgotten (SB is often useless).<br><br><br>Yes, he's mostly on his own. Makes his own moves too. Moves like GG that matched a similar beam (KHH) learned from an old master. This while GG had less power behind it (making it the superior ki technique) thanks to KKx3 (x4 to overpower it) bringing Goku to 24K (versus Vegeta's 18K). He doesn't tend to like repeatedly using his named moves though. Strange habit of his.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Show me your creativity, /a/.

I can only find Horriblesubs subbed 11 and 12.  <br>Hiryuu did it.</br>  <br>Wait, what? Is this actually happening?</br>  <br>Yes. Ishibumi is writing six part novel for BorN BDs, named High School DxD EX. Where Issei's kids come from future to present. Kids of pictured girls are confirmed to appear.</br>  <br> Which other unconfirmed DDs you also hope to become mothers of Issei's children? <br>all DxD will be mothers anon.  including Sona <br><br>Grandma/pa Ophis and Grandpa Great Red want lots of baby dragons running around the dimensional gap</br></br></br></br>    FFF subs never  <br>   including Sona <br>How high is the possibility for this to happen?</br></br>  <br> Which other unconfirmed DDs you also hope to become mothers of Issei's children? <br>best girl of course</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, but the ashes cannot conceive.</br>  <br>for EX? pretty much 0 .<br><br>for the future sequel/spinoff or just in general? i´d say ...50/50 , either Sona jumps on his DxD or just stays alone/ gets together with a new character, Saji is fucked unless something BIG happens and she starts be seeing him as an actual man and not just her little brother .</br></br></br>  RIP  Issei's parents   <br>They need to be inducted into the anime parents hall of fame</br>  Does anyone have the newer card sets? I though i had them but i must have forgotten to move the files or something.  <br> They are now canonically future MILFs. <br>how? what happened?</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>At least try reading the first couple of posts anon.</br>  <br>who is that?</br>  <br>Kiba</br>  <br>to bad, I was hoping i was one of Isseis daughters</br>  <br> too bad <br>nigger, Yumi is a miracle of the chichigami. and SCIENCE! </br></br>  Xenovia is love, Xenovia is life.<br>Xenovia would be best mother, and hottest mother. She'd be all tomboyish to her children, then go weak in the knee's begging for your cock at night.</br>  <br> No kids for Yumi </br>  <br>Yumi is too perfect anon, thats why she cant be part of the series.</br>  <br>how cum Kiba is a girl?</br>  <br> Which will be hottest mom? <br>Akeno<br> And which best mom? <br>Irina<br> Also on child which of them you are most curious? <br>Xenovia's, I want to know more about him/her<br> Your bets on children's genders? (Only Rias is confirmed to have son) <br>Like I said previously, Akeno will be the only other one with a son, the rest will be daughters<br> Which other unconfirmed DDs you also hope to become mothers of Issei's children? <br>Still hoping for Ravel and somehow Sona</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Mah nigga your tastes. I can share Xenovia if you want.</br>  <br>SCIENCE!<br><br>Azazel creates a sex changing ray gun, in one story everyone but issei gets hit with it so you had super handsome male Rias and akeno, fem kiba, gasper who looked the same , etc. running around.<br>saddly this story is not translated and we have no illustrations of it either.<br><br><br>then in another side story issei gets sick and all the girls take care of him while wearing nurse outfits, Kiba gets jelly so he goes and gets the gun turns into Yumi and another nurse outfit to take care of issei and help him get better .<br><br><br>those pictures are from the side story, and this is one picture of the other girls as nurses.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>I actually want Akeno to have a daughter so we can have this scene but with issei and barakiel also sitting besides them all being a happy family.<br><br>also naming her Shuri would also be nice.</br></br></br>  <br>BASED Kiba</br>  <br>Kiba is teaching Issei's and Rias's son swordsmanship. He even call him "sensei".</br>  <br>Pretty much this. <br>Also I can imagine how delicious would have been if Akeno's daughter was huge siscon for Rias's son and constantly tried to seduce him.</br></br>  <br>And now imagine that this body will actually bear child.</br>  <br> Issei doesn't impregnate Kiba <br><br>He couldn't become the harem king.</br></br></br>   You will never get to see Issei conquer Koneko's tight loli body <br> You will never see her get split in half while trying to push out a babby from it </br>  <br> Xenovia would be best mother, and hottest mother. <br>Not would. She WILL.<br>Now is just question which gender her child is.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So basically it's FE Awakening: DxD Edition</br></br>  <br>You are not first who say that.</br>  <br><br>Well it was the first I had first of this, so it's what came to mind.</br></br>  <br>had heard*</br>  <br> how delicious would have been if Akeno's daughter was huge siscon for Rias's son and constantly tried to seduce him. <br>I like the way you think anon.<br>make them the around the same age so he tries to act "mature" and like an older brother and she just teases the shit out of him 24/7 about it and shit, playing on how Akeno teases Rias all the time.<br>oh man all the boners... ALL OF THEM.</br></br></br></br>  <br> best mom <br> Irina <br>Anon I like you</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with both of you, I actually think Koneko would be best mom though, but Irina is the reason I watch DxD</br>  <br><br>if you think about it Irina and Rias are the only girls with normal childhoods, the rest had pretty screwed up ones so they have that advantage over them.<br><br>Akeno i think would still be up there because Shuri seemed like a great mom and maybe Akeno got some of that along with the S&amp;M genes .<br><br>in the end i think all of them would be great moms.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you are right.... Irina is best... could you guys please post Irina, I just noticed that I don't have a DxD folder... which is weird, I was sure to have saved some Irina and Koneko pics but can't seem to find them</br>  I'm still annoyed that FFF dropped the TV broadcast of BorN 10 episodes in. Now I have to wait until the BD release to finish watching it uncensored.  <br>There are at least two other groups that subbed the uncensored release.</br>  <br>Who? There's all of jack shit on Tokyo Toshokan and nyaa.se.</br>  <br>You aren't looking hard enough<br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>01181</wbr> <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>03838</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>Come on anon just ask for links like a good little lazy ass baby and stop pretending that you actually looked because we all know you did not.</br>        Posting best doujin  Shokugeki no Soma is a cooking manga.  <br>Ok</br>  <br>Who'd you like to handle your balls?</br>  Translations  soon.   <br>Alice</br>  <br>the only choice</br>  <br>i want to cum in erina</br>  Where are the doujins of Alice getting brutally fucked by berserk Kurokiba  <br>Soma</br>  <br>Alice or  Takumi </br>  <br>Maybe in the next Comiket.</br>  Megumi is cute as fuck. She should quit cooking and become an idol.  So what else can she do with her God Tongue?  <br>I'd have alice handle my larger testicle with her sultry fingers and gentle touch. My other testicle would be reserved for Ryouko. The shaft would be perfect for Erina because of her annoying large mouth</br>  <br>Do you think she'd ask Hisako to help her practice kissing, so she doesn't embarrass herself when the time comes?</br>  <br>well if thats blood...</br>  <br>Of course the Nakiris are clean</br>  <br>Of course, they are  a couple  after all.</br>  <br>I support Hisako and Erina</br>  <br>So when will it turn full battle shounen?</br>  <br>During Shokugeki's with the elite 10.</br>  <br>FIFTEEN goddamn years old</br>  So I suppose pic related won't be happening during this arc.  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE ERINA!    If Tadokoro didn't use wine vinegar to preserve the cauliflowers color, do you think bishichef would have still fired her?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br><br>fuck off erinafags are fucking cancerous</br></br></br>  <br>People are free to love whoever the want, Anon. Clam down.</br>  <br>Why do you think that?</br>  <br>Yes absolutely. He deliberately planted the bad ingredients to make people fail, the test was rigged.</br>  <br><br>Why do I feel like this "I hate Erinafags!" shitposter is an Erinafag trying to falseflag SnS threads by doing this shit so the general consensus becomes so tired of his shit, people will turn on Erina haters and drive them out completely?<br><br> I like it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Everything is a false flag. Clench your asscheeks.</br>  Sometimes I wonder if it would be better as another type of manga  <br>I would enjoy a music manga.

I keep thinking he was supposed to but his popularity got Tsukuda to bring him for the Stagiare. <br><br>Hope he comes back again. Him and his circle of fellow students are a blast to read (especially his interactions with Hinako)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's trying to teach them that you have to rely on yourself and always fight to be first.<br><br>Hence why he made it a single person assignment and why he purposefully put discoloured cauliflower in there.<br><br>By being alone you rely on yourself and by putting the bad cauliflower in it forces them to try to be first to the ingredient pile<br><br>Have you ever seen a real cooking show?<br>They people on those shows tell you how fiercely competitive it is all the time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those shows provided quality products and in fair quantities to provide enough for each contestant.<br><br>Just admit that Shino was a prick at the time</br></br></br>  <br>hippo</br>  <br> always fight to be first <br>I guarantee you there will be some incident where "slow and steady wins the race".

But I think it would be a new character (transfer student or some prodigy from middle school).</br>  <br>I do not disagree but there are some times in said contests that they only provide maybe 1 particularly good item or have them in such limited quantities that contestants must fight to be the first to grab them. This is more because of cost and seasonal scarcity rather than a part of the competition though.</br>  <br>Shinomiya has his own spin off though, so he's always around compared to the other alumni.</br>  <br>He got an upgrade in almost every way.
