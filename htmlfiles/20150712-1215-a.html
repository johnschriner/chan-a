Kriegsmarine, meine Freunde.  <br>congrats, you're wasting your life!</br>  <br>I can't remember if I saved this before. In the best case scenario I now have two of them.</br>  <br>Shigure is too good for that bitch's abuse.</br>  <br>Not funny, man</br>  Why does this game have such shitty connectivity for a browser game  <br>Why, good anon?</br>  <br>Heil!</br>  There's something off about my new Bismarck.  <br>Did you marry Bisko  again  yet?</br>  <br>She turned into best girl.</br>  <br>Man you guys have good fucking memories!<br><br>But yeah, I couldn't play the game for a few months after the anime ended for a buncha reasons, but I started playing again there towards the start of May. Married her there around the end of June.</br></br></br>  <br> you guys <br>It's just me. I'm just that autistic.</br></br>  <br>Fuck Akatsuki.</br>  <br>  I'm just that autistic. <br>Yes, I believe that was one of the firs things you ever said to me.<br><br>Just for the record though, I never actually married Bisko first time around. I got lucky and unlocked her when I was still quite new to the game and lost her not too long afterwards due to my ineptitude.</br></br></br></br>  <br> two Bismarcks <br> meanwhile I got four Yamashiro in a row <br>Maybe I should just pull the trigger and ring her?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, do it faggot.</br>  <br> Maybe </br>  <br>It's called "Settling" and you should totally do it before you end up alone in a world of waifus.</br>  Is there a yes-no pillow with atago? This is the only one I found.  Are you watching Naka's Wild Adventures?  When will the game have nukes?<br><br> submarine launches ICBM, nukes the Boss node into oblivion without needing to even fight them face to face </br></br>  <br> WW2 anyone other than US <br> nukes </br></br>  <br> WW2 </br>    <br>The ships are from WW2 you retard, just because they're in modern times doesn't mean they're going to go using modern tech or else none of them would be using those shitty AA guns.</br>  I want to fug a boat!  <br> boat </br>  <br><br>May I remind you that the Fat Man was invented during the war.</br></br>  <br>And?

Air Gear  <br>I don't know... Noucome flopped hard and apparently the Nips didn't like it anyway. If anything, Oreshura is the one that deserves a second season, if only because its end was so open.</br>  Consider this: Haremshits don't deserve shit  <br>this</br>  <br>Not OP, but I liked Noucome for the comedy. If it weren't a harem I'd like it just as much if not more.</br>  It has more than enough of source material to back it up, and Yen Press is licensing the LNs, so there might be interest..?  Tsuritama  <br>Getting the obvious out of the way.</br>    Gantz  <br>diomedea should just make more ika musume</br>      Darker than Black  <br>Nah, S2 was already worse than S1.</br>    <br>so boring<br><br>shokugeki is everything koufuku should've been</br></br></br>  <br> It didn't even get 12 episodes. </br>  one of Dogakobo's more finer works  <br>Shokugeki is about making food, koufuku is about enjoying food, 2 different subjects.</br>  <br>I was bored, period.</br>  <br>Why must you tease me so.<br>No more best girl.</br></br>  <br>This, the comedy was pretty fun.<br><br><br>Makes you wonder if the Sequel is gonna get an anime.</br></br></br></br>  aesthetica of a rogue hero, anyone?  Twintails certainly deserves one with a better studio and Tatsuya Katou on music to keep up with the source material. Aika was just amazing in this scene.    I know it flopped horribly, but I still want one  <br>It had little to no budget but it was fun.</br>      <br>After that ending, I really don't see how a second season could be anything but shit</br>  <br>I don't know why they did it. Should have just followed the manga. Rest of the series was good though/ Liked the soundtrack a lot</br>   S2 never <br><br>I've come to peace with this. Like coming to peace with the death of a father, or a diagnosis of a terminal illness.</br></br>  <br>well</br>  <br>Fucking this</br>  <br>But... Code Geass had a second season<br><br><br>And thats just a OVA between the two seasons.</br></br></br></br>  <br>and it even sold around 4k-5k band</br>  Claymore.  Twintails and Mondaiji      <br>Came here to post this</br>    This and Jinrui wa Suitai Shimashita  <br>Let me remind you : if this gets sequel, she won't be in it.</br>  <br>THIS. the next arc after after anime really good. also that crazy Izayoi flashback</br>  <br>Fair enough. Switch second season for sequel.</br>  <br>But the LNfags said she came back in the latest novel during its airing.</br>  <br>Will never happen ;_;</br>  I loved Kawaisou  Accel World  Oda Nobuna no Yabou    <br>I need to re-watch this now that I actually know some basic Sengoku Jidai history.</br>  <br>This</br>  <br><br>Can't even remember what happened.<br><br>I should just watch S1 again; there's my S2.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This so much. I want it badly</br>  Well, not a second season since it had one, but we'll never see an adaptation of the rest of this.  Shinketsui no Tsunami wa Iori<br><br>probably my 10/10 for 2013, a shame it didn't sell well</br></br>  <br>It makes me so sad. That damn show was it's AOTY.<br><br>That said, we all know that pic related won't either.</br></br></br>  The harem aspect was underwhelming and totally unnecessary, but the comedy was still great.<br>Also would you let yourself get sodomized for Chocolat's entertainment? <br>[spoiler ERABE [/spoiler]</br></br>  <br> we all know that pic related won't <br><br>There is a God after all.</br></br></br>  <br>nobody cares either</br>    <br>Wow, that's some surprisingly decent animation.</br>  <br>needs a reboot with a complete 180 on the plot and is not at all based off Ogure's writing. The concept was neat but it turned out to be too sophistic in the hands of Ogure and toei.</br>  Kokkurisan and amagi brilliant park  <br>What was wrong with the anime's music?<br><br>I really like the OST</br></br></br>  <br><br>Twintails took the "oh ok it's shit because it's ironic" approach of Daimidaler and somehow did it even worse.</br></br>  <br>Watched this with in an entire night, Was pretty fun and I actually wouldn't mind another season if not just to see more of the choices he's force to do and the president.</br>  Welcome to the NHK.<br><br>I want a different character, just different circumstances. <br><br>I know it'll be shit, but meh.</br></br></br></br>  Noucome needs a second season starring Loli sensei <br>Everything else about the show is trash</br>  <br><br> HEH </br></br>  <br>This. Mil-fags need better things than airshit and fucking GATE.</br>  <br> came to post noucome <br> noucome is OP </br></br>  <br>Yes on the first and yes on the second with the latter because the finale was fucking nothing.</br>  <br>They're two different shows to me. <br>NHK's got a more introspective thing to it, while the other's just a fucking cringe-fest (in a great way).</br></br>  <br>My nigga. I started off not liking it that much but it really grew on me. I loved the art and all the characters</br>  We need more Bakatora terrorrist shenanigans.  <br><br>Nah letting it end before it goes full fucking retard is the best thing that could happen to it</br></br>  <br> "oh ok it's shit because it's ironic" <br>that was literally the only reason to bother with the show</br></br>  <br>That show was bad and you should feel bad.</br>  <br>And Douman's voice</br>  Hadn't seen this since it aired, but it really holds up. I love everything in it from opening to muppet previews. <br> Utao's facial expressions are so delicious.   <br><br>Too bad the manga is already over so the probability of more anime is equal to zero, but at least the scanlations haven't gone dead.</br></br></br>  Nichijou and Nyan Koi  <br>Also, the specials were ridiculous.</br>    Most of these were either shit or didn't need a 2nd season at all.  <br>Nothing really but the material in the unadapted books would fit quite nicely with Katou's climactic style. That particular scene has a slow build up to a turnabout moment and I can't really recall any tunes in particular of Takanashi's that shifts up drasticly like Katou's stuff.<br><br><br>That's because source material wasn't supposed to be taken that way. They cut a lot after the first volume to focus on the comedy and didn't show off how serious things could get in the climax.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You shut your whore mouth, both Daimidaler and Twintails are amazing shows and deserve more praise.</br>  <br><br>They get more than they deserve for the wastes of potential that they are.</br></br>    I liked it a lot.   This would only work with all-original episodes, each getting progressively crazier than the last.   I need more warewarewa    <br> Shows that deserve a GOOD second season but will never get one. </br>  This  Still waiting  <br><br> Can't even remember what happened. <br><br>Because nothing did.<br><br>Really though I loved that show. Following the manga now but monthly releases are painful.</br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>;_;</br>  Baccano.  <br><br>There is no justice in this world.</br></br>  <br>And more Natsumoe.<br><br>Out of all the shows of this type this was my favorite. Too bad it didn't get received too well.</br></br></br>  <br>The story was complete, what else do you want?</br>  <br>Not him but faggot priest and loli vampire escaped.</br>  <br>Twin tails doesn't deserve shit unless blue hair wins</br>  <br>This.</br>  <br>I miss her.</br>  <br>Her theme is god tier.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6W6<wbr>Ksy2lunU</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Gantz with a proper non-shit ending.   Tiger and Bunny <br> shit gold when it was airing to the point that product that just appeared on the show was selling out like Kotetsu's cologne and watch. <br> The Rising movie sold like hotcakes for the show that didn't have new material in three years <br> still no second season <br><br>Is Sunrise still buttmad that T&amp;B was a roaring success and made much more money than Sacred Seven and Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere, two titles that they spent much more money on?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You and me bro.</br>    Zvezda<br><br>You'll never see Keito fight those pig dog Americans</br></br>  ERABE  <br>They didn't like making Horizon either, don't lump it together with Sacred Shit</br>  ctrl+f darker<br><br><br><br>Good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Keit-ai.</br>  <br>It's kinda sad. One of the only 'magic high school' shows I enjoyed watching.</br>  A new series/movie featuring the NHK characters, set a decade or so later. Centered around a friends' reunion, perhaps? <br><br>It should serve as an epilogue, but also carry a new story of its own. Broader commentary on life and japanese working culture from a wiser perspective. Show the characters' strife for something greater, finding their purpose, and/or acceptance of their mundane life.</br></br>  <br>Tiger &amp; Bunny.</br>  Vegeta experiences the greatest hell<br><br>Fun.</br></br>  I wonder how this will go...

Maybe even a keyhole sweater.<br>Or something that fits summer better like having her hair tied up, wearing only an oversized t-shirt  cute or lewd-ish are both okay!  <br><br>Cooling off poolside in a bikini, kicking at the water.

Yikes.</br>  <br>requesting anons melting while their waifu watches</br>  <br> Getting desperate after going one full day without a delivery eh? Are you that addicted to free drawings? </br>  <br>Are they melting because their waifu is too hot?</br>  <br>in a dunk tank? Ill do it.</br>  <br>no they're melting because they're in an industrial oven.</br>  <br>Dunk tanks have become the fetish I never wanted</br>  <br>they're melting because they're falling into a pool of acid<br>and right before they completely submerge they give a final thumbs up</br></br>  <br>T-thanks, Anon. I hope you get your waifu drawn too.</br>  <br><br>Nah.</br></br>  I guess the trade isn't going to happen, whoever you were asking for it.  <br>Where is she from anon? I think I might pick it up.</br>  <br>It was probably just zehturtle.</br>  <br>It isn't the end of the weekend yet</br>   https://www.picarto.tv/live/channel<wbr>.php?watch=boa</wbr>   Theoretical question, but would taking  transparency  requests be fine? Anyone who requests is free to rerequest.   tfw nobody has drawn my waifu yet <br>Still holding out for pokeanon, though.</br>  <br>Well if you think its such a hot idea why don't you justify an anon melting like that. Is the waifu the sun?</br>  <br>Transparency?</br>  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>Metal Gear?</br>  <br>Needs less photobackground, nice art doe.</br>  <br>You know those images where the background is cut out for people to post their shitty memes in? That's basically what a transparency is, only with focus on waifus.</br>  <br>Donut steel.<br>http://www.deviantart.com/art/Urabe<wbr>-taking-a-swim-415550817</wbr></br></br>  <br>I think that'd be perfectly fine. I might even take you up on it.</br>  <br>See-through negligee, obviously.</br>  <br> Yeah, nothing as grotesque as that art though. <br>Ouch. Maybe this is more your speed.</br></br>  Requesting tacticute Nelliel please. Maybe in American SWAT team clothes.  <br>If you want one, just give me an image. I'll see what I can do.</br>  <br>As a general rule it's kinda rude to draw lewd things of waifus here unless the requester specifically asks for it. Tasteful/suggestive lewds are usually safe, but shoving a popsicle in a waifu's snatch without consent is over the line.</br>  <br>Deliverin'<br><br>I think I spent too much time on the parfait</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first week here?</br>  Why didn't Biribiri shoot him from behind or shoot several beams at him so he can't block all of them?  <br> touma <br> average in fist fights <br> has precognition and went through some serious shit in NT9 <br><br>Touma is pretty good when it comes to fist-fights the only time he ever really loses is when he's outnumbered or it's someone like a saint or Tsuchimikado.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry but Othinus, along with her arc, is in fact overrated because of waifu and shipping shit. Deal with it</br>   Fiamma will NEVER be animated   <br>Thor is pretty close himself I think.<br><br> You defeated Thor as a lightning god…but that was as far as you got. You could not reach the level of the Almighty Thor.” <br><br> "Let me enjoy this, baby." <br><br> “Remember what I said before? No matter how high you go, there’s always someone higher. The pursuit of power never ends. I’m not all that different from the rest of Gremlin. I joined them in order to grant my desire. There was nothing more to it than that.” <br><br> "When two ridiculously huge powers collide, damage will spread to the surrounding area. My fights can be described using horrible words like ‘war’. But Kamijou-chan, what about that power of yours? You’re just a high school student and yet you’ve saved quite a few people! You even ended World War 3!! You’ve survived this far fighting Gremlin!! And the wonderful power that did all that is the ability to negate!? Oh, I can’t wait. My next stage of growth is finally, finally coming into view!! I can have a battle amidst such stinging tension that I have no idea who will win…and as a conflict between a ridiculously huge power and a negating power, it won’t even cause that much damage!! Has there ever been a more convenient or profitable battle than this, Kamijou-chan!?" <br><br> "They have formed a group to beat the shit out of Kamijou Touma, who has already been shot in the side, and then abduct a woman named Fraulein Kreutune before his eyes. And they’ll be whispering to Fraulein Kreutune that she’ll be happiest if they use her for their purposes and then kill her. So what do you think, Miko-chan? Do you approve of that? Do you oppose it? Or will you take the clever route and just look away? Which side do you want to stand on?" <br><br> "My enemy certainly has become pathetic." </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey now, he's a mercenary and not bound to one group. <br>It can't be helped that he killed Terra for being a shit and went against Misha while nearly dying on his feet.</br></br>  What would you do in this situation?  <br>Why is 4chan fucked up now.

Slowly ween her off of her disgusting habits until she stays a pleasant little imouto  with my dick.    I'd stomp her out for being so messy I run a clean house none of that snacks on the ground shit<br><br>I mean if that cola spills do you kno how fucking hard it is to clean off the floor?</br></br>  Feed  Play that zombie game with her  <br>YOU DEAD</br>  <br><br>Go for the superior imouto</br></br>  <br>take her hymen for beeing a spoiled bitch, then proceed to play zombie games with her</br>  <br><br>Probably my favorite part of the whole episode.

Umaru's a sweetie who loves her onii-chan.</br>  <br>Sometimes, hair is so black and shiny that it reflects the sky's color. In animu, given how common black hair is among nips, this reflective quality is used to 'reflect' aspects of a person's character. In the case of a blue haired character, such as  she is carefree like the wind under a blue sky. Grey hair happens for similar reasons, the person is reflecting cloudy skies, which implies various things about their character. <br><br>I have no idea about green hair.</br></br></br>  This looks utterly familiar but I can't quite pinpoint the source of the reference from half of the wallpaper.    <br>Author's cameo</br>  <br>Well green is the color of wind in Japan, so there's that.</br>  <br> Irohasu~ </br>  <br>Disgusting pig sister eats shit and cola and cannot do housework to save her life.

But their balls(ovaries) are inside so, they scratch their bellies.</br></br></br>  <br>It was weird.

When Taihei and Ebina were acting friendly with each other it showed Kirie staring at the two with out saying anything. I thought she was either jealous or wondering what relationship Taihei and Ebina have.</br>  <br>She's just an autist who wants friends.<br>Boss is best girl.

Umaru used to live with their dad until a year or two ago. Their relationship isn't ideal, so the dad hired Alex (Sylphyn's onii-chan) to check up on them. Their mother died a long time ago, so Umaru doesn't remember her and Taihei barely remembers her.<br><br>This is all speculation.</br></br></br>    <br>doesnt explain who hikari is supposed to be though</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br> jump off a bridge.</br>  <br> Crying because you get told off for trying to touch a scolding hot pan <br> 16 years old </br></br>  <br>it was the first time her brother ever yelled</br>  <br>Well  was just asking about parents<br><br>Taihei probably met Hikari a while ago and taught her some stuff. She's the manager's sister, and he and the manager were friends in high school.</br></br></br>  <br>He yelled at her. He wasn't just telling her off, he was yelling at her.<br>If I had that cushy of a life, I'd cry too.</br></br>  <br>the company Taihei currently works for is the one the manager's dad owns though</br>  <br><br> Umaru being brat <br><br>What a surprise</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, well, just change some details in that case.<br><br>Perhaps they have absolutely no relation to any giant company, but Alex calling someone regarding Umaru does make me suspicious.</br></br></br>  I wonder which chapter they'll end it at.  <br><br>All that junk food will maker her shits really bad.</br></br>  <br>I would get angry and tell her to behave like a proper high schooler. It's for her own sake.<br>Spending her time at home living like a NEET is not healthy.</br></br>  <br>what's wrong with that if she's able to properly function in society. she doesn't even function like an average high schooler in public, she goes above and beyond. this is her way of letting out all the stress</br>  <br>But she does behave like a proper high schooler, you retarded tripfuck.<br>Furthermore, Taihei NEEDS Umaru to act like that or else he's got nothing to do or look forward to.</br></br>   norway   Japan pls  <br><br>The football game</br></br>  <br>Shit looks easy as fuck.<br><br>I did that shit in fifth grade.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It is in the manga</br></br>  <br>that made my heart melt when everyone was nice to TSF</br>  <br> football <br><br>i wish non americans would leave 4chan forever</br></br></br>  <br> What is Fred bought yesterday? </br>  <br>I wish non Americans stopped stealing our oxygen.</br>  <br><br>She is such a good girl</br></br>  <br>Join in.</br>  <br><br> Laying on a wooden floor. <br> potato chips out of the reach <br> psp out of the reach <br> cola out of the reach <br> remote out of the reach <br> keyboard out of the reach <br> small mousepad <br> bare legs, no cover <br> really uncomfortable posture to look at the computer screen <br><br>Absolutely Fucking Horrifying</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> football <br>What the fuck?

As a member of a family, Umaru has the duty to behave well at home too in a way that won't bother or worry her only sibling, Taihei. Taihei is a fine man who is often tired from work and who should not have to take care of her sister all the time because of her ill, but redeemable behavior.</br></br>  <br>lewd</br>  <br>Oh, right.</br>    <br> her <br>sasuga tripfag<br>Just fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Because last time they did that Umaru got scared of the thing poking her butt.

End of story.</br>  <br><br> awawa <br>I fucking love that shit. I hope it gets animated.</br></br></br>  <br>I cry when I get yelled at and I'm 29...</br>  <br><br>That's like every Ebina time</br></br>  The cola scene made me feel physically ill  <br>UMR &gt; umaru &gt;komaru</br>  <br>Onii-san is seducing the whole Ebina family members <br><br> Ebina's parents when? </br></br></br>  DROPPED  <br><br>why is ebina so perfect?</br></br>  <br>me</br>  <br><br>Ebina is just a useless little imouto, only good for her sex appeal</br></br>  <br> complete brat <br> that body  <br><br>my dick is conficted</br></br></br></br>    <br>I can understand why Kirie likes her so much.</br>  <br>Just came here and saw this.

What a twist!</br></br></br>  I just reached this point.<br><br> It was a request to find her bro, right? </br></br>  <br><br>Yes</br></br>  You think Ebina already knows about Umarus disgusting second life but doesn't say anything cuz they're friends?  <br>It is a Japanese culture thing not really touched in anime or manga. Simply put, think of it as "little sister leading a double life". That's not actually the translation, but it's the meaning. The translation is "dried fish imouto".</br>  <br>No, Ebina is an idiot.</br>  Incest when?  <br>What's with those silly TL notes?

Nostalgia is a hell of a drug.<br><br>I personally don't think it's as bad as everyone here is bitching about it, but then again I've been used to English dubs of anime for forever. The only things I really don't like are JYB as Jonathan (his presence was inevitable really but I did NOT expect them to cast him as any Jojo, much less the very first one, and his performance doesn't seem that great to make up for it either) and Papenbrook as Caesar (admittedly because his roles are all from shows/characters I really don't like, and we haven't even heard anything from him yet so he could prove me wrong, but I doubt it).</br></br></br>  Plot armor aside, how the FUCK did Jotaro survive any of DIO's attacks? Specifically, the scene right after "I feel like singing!" when DIO punches Jotaro into the ground. The World and Star Platinum are essentially the same stand, in strength and abilities, and when Jotaro Oraora'd DIO directly, it left him with holes in his body. And DIO could punch a whole directly through Kakyoin, penetrating the human body.<br><br>So when The World repeatedly punched Jotaro, how did he only get broken bones, which still wouldn't have been easy to shake off? Did DIO hold back for the sake of Road Roller use?</br></br>    <br>Still had magazines under his shirt to absorb blows, also had Star Platinum actively guarding him</br>  <br>It showed Star Platinum breaking his fall, but The World even broke Star Platinum's guard while he was kicking him.</br>  When is the final JoJo BD going to come out?  <br>Looking back<br> 3 punches to break bones <br> kick in the face <br> final time stop <br>So yeah, Dio was probably just trying to break some bones so Jotaro couldn't escape the road roller da</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>newfags also forget that hamon existed for a whopping two years before stands were introduced, hell, i don't even think there was a break between the end of battle tendency and the beginning of stardust crusaders.<br><br>can't find the individual chapter release date but the first SC volume was released 2 months after battle tendency's final volume release</br></br></br>  <br> David wastes all their budget getting licensed songs for the EDs <br> implying <br>The song they licensed don't cost that much</br></br></br>  <br>What if Araki wants a Queen song for part 4? Goodbye budget</br>  <br>He's not actually involved with the production, they just ask him for suggestions on ED choices and some minor things like giving the runaway girl a name.</br>    <br>What were his suggestions? Wasn't Build Me Up Buttercup on his list?</br>  I just finished Part 4 and want to move on to Part 5, but apparently the re scanlation stopped because of Viz acquiring something or whatever. So, is Part 5's bad translation worth my time? If it isn't can I skip it and just wait for colored JoJo or something?  <br>We don't know about Walk Like An Egyptian, but both Roundabout and Last Train Home were his suggestions. <br><br>That thing about Build Me Up Buttercup is something someone here made up and parroted long enough that some others started believing it despite there being no source.</br></br></br>  <br>oh man this would be great for the ED, it even sounds vaguely Bowieish</br>  <br>There are some cool fights that shine through the bad translation, and Part 5 isn't THAT long. It's at the edge of skippable, but don't skip it.<br><br>Just be ready to reread it when they finish the new scanlation in 2020</br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll read it.

My money's on either Jonathan, Jotaro or Josuke  <br>I was one of the second until I came here and realized that Araki just can't write consistency for shit</br>  <br>Jotaro sent an adult flying with just his fists. In kid form.<br>He would absolutely trash everyone.</br></br>  <br>i dont understand joseph fags i mean sure have a favourite jojo and all but .....</br>  <br>When you say "no powers fight," do you mean just a straight-up brawl or are outside resources allowed as well? I feel like Giorno being the head of a huge crime organization would have at least some advantages in some way.<br><br><br>Joseph's as valid a choice of favorite jojo as any other. I don't thin there's much to "understand." I personally don't get why Josuke is so disproportionately popular  but then again I didn't think Part 4 was all it was cracked up to be either.  Which is not to say I dislike him or anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but jospeh hid a tommy gun in his jacket</br>  So I just got to the Wekapipo and magenta Magenta fight and I have a couple observations: <br> If Gyro's so practiced at Spin and has been doing the Golden Rotation for at least a while, why does he still need a reference to do it? Is practicing not enough to memorize it? <br> The fact that there's no Golden Ratio in their hands or faces or anything would suggest that their proportions aren't "beautiful" which amuses me a lot for some reason </br></br>  drama time<br>sort jojos from best to worse<br><br>johnny&gt;(young)joseph&gt;jo2uke&gt;josuke&gt;<wbr>jolyne&gt;jotaro&gt;joseph&gt;jonathan&gt;giorn<wbr>o</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>   reading crossover madoka/jojo fanfiction <br><br>god damn it why is there literally no good jojo-related literature besides purple haze which was too damn short and had a shitty translation<br><br>it's all DIO slash, why</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Was an animeonly for a while <br> Loved Joseph to death <br> Read the manga <br> tfw Johnyfag now </br></br></br></br></br>  Is Josuke an incel?  <br>Are you me in the ireneverse?</br>  <br>I feel you.

It seemed fine to me.</br>  <br>Nah, Harry Potter has plenty of well written fanfiction. It's less than 0.01%, but it exists. Naruto has one or two decent fics that try to fix the shit that's the source material, but everything else has only shitty fanfiction.<br><br>I expected jojo to have more fans because the manga is creative as shit and I hoped some of that creativity went into good writers. But nope.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not wrong or anything, but the author didn't take the liberties a translator needs to take in order to translate a japanese light novel. It's dry as fuck, and has a ton of narration cliches.<br><br>The story itself was pretty good, though. I liked the stands.</br></br></br>  <br> Nah, Harry Potter <br>Stopped reading there.</br></br>  <br>I'm not saying HP is good by itself, I'm just saying that good fanfiction of it does exist. I'd rather we not talk about it and make this jojo thread even more off-topic, though, so let's agree to disagree.</br>  <br>I mean, take Jotaros Ravioli:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD-<wbr>ZWzssjBQ</wbr>  [ ]<br>Your next post will be "Why was this written, it's really, really weird."</br></br></br>  <br>What?

Unless I'm missing something.</br>  <br><br>He's one of the most well written Jojos, probably because their was only one other person traveling with him in the longest part, giving Araki room to write him well.</br></br>  <br>Imagine a decent writer looked at Joseph and designed to adapt him to a realistic western world with a new backstory.</br>  <br> THIS ENTIRE POST <br>Holy fuck anon go to /b/ for a couple years and aquamate before you start posting on 4chan.</br></br>  <br>Is "realistic" just a new buzzword that means "things I like"?<br><br>How the fuck can you look at anything of SBR and think it's "realistic" in any way?</br></br></br>  <br>The characters are pretty realistic, the setting is obviously fantasy.</br>  <br>Oh shit, I just realized I wrote "realistic western world", my bad.

The world of Jojo is crazy, it's not a crime or bad for the characters to be crazy and "unrealistic." It's like people don't like being reminded they're reading or watching a series about magically powered people having fights and out-bullshit-ing each other. <br><br> Basically my opinion &gt; yours, neener neener </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone already did</br>  <br>I obviously don't mean character design holy shit, just their personality, circumstances, backstories.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127931771   GOT IT GOT IT YES I GOT IT  <br>Methods of Rationality is trash, just sayin'.</br>  <br> Jotero <br> Kyokin </br></br>  <br>Fantastic <br>SlavBallRun <br><br> you must perfect the squat johnny! <br> My heart and actions are utterly clouded, they are all those of vodka! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's a taste of tha remedy (Yeah!)</br>      <br><br>in retrospect that was a pretty autistic post</br></br>  <br> in retrospect </br>  <br>pls no bully</br>  <br>Reminds me of that scene in Men In Black III where Will Smith dodges all those nails effortlessly after a brief travel back in time.</br>  <br>I think all those versions of him from the clip are versions of him that died, and he's using them as a guide for where to dodge, so it's nothing like D4C at all. if anything it's more like an unholy lovechild of KC and Horus.</br>  <br>The new scans are coming out a good pace.</br>  <br>I know, but you know I'm right</br>  <br>Narancia's face pisses me off</br>  <br>stands have nothing to do with ripple powers, the so called connection was mentioned once when stands were first introduced.

You're still slow.</br>  <br> Implying <br>6, 7, and 8 have not reached 5 levels of gay</br></br>  <br>As if they haven't looked gay from the beginning.

He's also one of only 2 Jojos to actually Oraoraora (when he attacked Bruford), the other being Jotaro when he was a kid, but Jotaro's oras were slower. I'm sure every Jojo would put up a fight, but I gotta say that Jonathan would probably come in first, while Giorno would come in last.</br>  gay priest is finally here  JoJo fashion and hair became massively gay after arc 2.  <br> Musclemen are gay as fuck, too. <br><br>It wasn't gay back then.</br></br></br>  <br>Stop it with your gay discrimination, homo.</br>  <br>Jonathan broke steel with his bare hands, even Tarkus with his zombie strength on top of already being huge wasn't that strong.</br>  <br>The Japanese stereotype for campy gayness has included huge muscles for a long time.</br>  <br> Implying Dio didn't want to lick Jonathan's abs <br><br>Nah it was just as gay back then.</br></br></br>  <br>A guy who works with me on the black and white scans is doing the colored scans himself. The black and white scans have higher priority.</br>  <br>why exactly? the anime is going to finish faster than you anyway</br>  <br>Haha, I don't think Giorno would lose to a literal cripple in a street fight.<br><br>Jojo OFFICIAL power level rankings<br><br>Jonathan&gt;Jotaro&gt;Josuke&gt;Jolyne&gt;Josep<wbr>h&gt;Giorno&gt;Gappy&gt;Johnny</wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You pulled this list out of your ass. Some of it makes no sense at all.</br>  <br> Joseph lower than Jolyne  <br> Josuke above Joseph  <br><br>C'mon dude in a normal fistfight Joseph would fuck them up</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me fix that for you<br><br>Giorno &gt; Johnny &gt; Jotaro = Gappy &gt; Jolyne &gt; Josuke &gt; Joseph &gt; Johnathan</br></br></br>  <br>If we're going without Stands, spin, or hamon, I'd say this.<br><br>Jonathan &gt; Joseph &gt; Jotaro &gt; Josuke &gt; Jolyne &gt; Gappy &gt; Giorno &gt; Johnny</br></br></br>  <br>We're talking about streetfights, that would be almost perfect for stands/hamon.</br>  <br> A 15 year old is stronger than a fucking adult <br> A girl is stronger than a guy who actually fucking lifts <br>Thise really good bait, honestly</br></br></br>  <br>The post says <br> no powers fight  <br><br>We're talking fistfights here</br></br></br></br>  <br>She went to prison and wasn't anyone's bitch, you don't get like that without knowing how to fight. Joseph lifting is all show for his homosex friends. He consistently won fights only with trickery, and every Jojo except jonathan are shown to be exceptional at that. Tricks ain't gonna fly against another jojo. He can probably still throw a good punch with his gorilla arms so that's why I placed him there.</br>  <br>Almost, but I'd raise Part 8 Josuke up to about equal with Jolyne and both of them slightly above Part 4 Josuke. They're both very physical for punchghost users, especially Jolyne who's even drawn in actual martial arts stances at times.</br>  <br>Holy shit no dude Joseph would fucking drop Jolyne man</br>  <br> Joseph lifting is all show for his homosex friends <br>You don't know how lifting works, do you? Also Jolyne was in a GIRLS prison and we never saw her fight without Stone Free you dumbass.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Does Josuke w/ Hair Insulted count as a power?</br></br></br>  <br>That's just uncontrollable rage.</br>  <br> Strongest punch ghost doesn't belong to the strongest user <br>Jonathan&gt;Josuke&gt;Jotaro&gt;Jolyne=Josef<wbr>=Jo2suke=Giorno&gt;Johnny<br><br>We all know Jonathan was the strongest but by muscle, feat and punch ghost the rest fall into place.</br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Oh I forgot about Johnny, yeah he'd be very low I'd say near Gappy and Giorno.<br><br>Saying Joseph is below Josuke and Jolyne is fucking dumb though, he still is a fighter, or at least very strong (climbing the erotic tower of oil). I know strength doesn't always equal fighting ability, but it does count somewhat.</br></br></br>  I just realized, Jotaro should have been CRUSHED TO DEATH regardless of whether he could stop time or not, since even when he stops time DIO is still able to move and he's still punching the Roadroller into Jotaro while he's pinned under it so it's pretty much still the same situation.  <br><br>I think Josuke would win if nothing pissed the other Joestars off enough like Defending Erina's Honor Jonathon or Nobody Could See That and Stay Calm Jotaro.</br></br>  How old is Gappy?  <br> thinking Josuke is a better fighter than Joseph <br> even thinking Jolyne is a better fighter than Joseph </br></br>  <br>Gappy a Giorno are weak but they have the hard cunt bonus. You just know they'd manipulate the fight to get the upper hand and see solutions others mightn't consider.</br>  <br>probs like 20 or 18<br><br>i remember someone saying their of legal age so 18 is more likely since Gappy was gona go to highschool at some point</br></br></br>  <br>A couple of months at most, but JoJolion might have only been a single month so far. <br><br>He's a brand new being, neither Kira or Kujo.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, with that musculature and how he manhandled Ojirou, I'd put him above Giorno. Plus, Giorno never really attacked anyone with his own fists.</br>  <br>He climbed the oil with hamon though, which doesn't really showcase physical abilities. On second though, his ripple training like controlled breathing might come in useful in a fist fight</br>  <br>Ok if we're going by ruses you must consider Joseph, come on. Gappy is super lanky, but maybe that's just because of the loose clothes. Giorno was only creative with his OP stand, but I'll give you the possibility of him being creative in a fight. But not as creative as Joseph.</br>  <br> Implying Josuke isn't brutal when he needs to be and has the muscle and determination to back it up as well as tatical smarts in the heat of the moment.  <br>He is the most balanced Jojo only out done by raw Jonathan strength m8. <br> Doesn't know what = means <br>In retrospect Jolyne should probably move down a slot due to lack of muscle bit Gappy and Giorno would stand a solid chance based on their approach alone. Gappy in particular has been shown as hyper competent physically with good thinking under pressure and pain thresholds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't matter if it's with hamon, climbing the tower took a toll on his body and MUSCLES while keeping proper breathing to maintain the ripple. Hamon users are trained to have controlled breathing, so that means they have a lot of endurance even if they don't use Hamon.</br>  <br>Giorno sure, but Sailor Josuke uses his own body a lot and runs around dropkicking motorcycles. He'd beat the shit out of Giorno when it comes to standless fights and I'd also put him above the first Josuke who we really saw fighting physically.</br>  <br> a couple of months at most <br><br>C'mon dude you know what I mean</br></br></br>  <br> who we really saw fighting physically. <br>Never really saw, I mean</br></br>  Imagine either Jotaro or Polnareff die in the final battle and that another crusader replaces them in part 4 or 5.<br><br>How would it be?</br></br>  <br>Well see that's just it. They might have rused but Josef is all ruse. Gio and Jo2uke have both outmanoeuvred people tricks aside. Both have functioned well while putting themselves in harms way. Josef would need to have a ruse ready as shit went down that was good enough because without hamon there won't be much of a chance to ruse mid fight in a way that would fool any one other than Johnny and Jonathan.</br>  <br>The cast page at the beginning of every volume says he appears to be about 19.</br>  <br>All the pre-part 5 Jojos are built like 7 foot tanks.</br>  Ok here is a realistic rating of physically strongest JoJos<br><br>Johnathan&gt;Joseph&gt;Jotaro&gt;Josuke=Gapp<wbr>y&gt;Giorno&gt;Jolyne&gt;Johnny<br><br> inb4 Gappy is a twink <br>look at  Gappy has some gaisn. Anyone got the full scan of that though? I never saved it but I know it's out there</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Kakyoin meets more milfs.<br>Iggy is now a turtle-dog.</br></br>  <br>Josuke wasn't for long.</br>  <br>You know that lifting doesn't make you a good fighter right? Granted hamon training is essentially martial arts but you seriously realise that muscles aren't everything, especially not the muscle beast kind.<br>Lithe, agile, powerful. Lifts good just lifts good.</br></br>  What if part 8 ends up being as big as part 3 or 5 (5 is big in Japan they love it there)<br><br>I mean JoJo is getting pretty popular now and I've seen a few pics of advertisements in Japan with Gappy and stuff. <br><br>I take it nipps are loving part 8 so far? That's pretty cool man,  OVA in 2030 when part 8 finishes? </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's pure physical strength alone then I more or less agree just make Jolyne and Gio equal and we can call it a day. <br>If it's non-powered fighting capability then you're off.</br></br>  <br>Swap Giorno for Jolyne and that list is spot on, remember Giorno is only 15</br>  <br><br>Does anyone remember Giorno actually punching or kicking anybody without his Stand?</br></br>  post awesome music<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qKP<wbr>vCmAc8bQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>it's getting popular in the US thanks to the anime, in Japan it's not more popular than it's always been<br><br>japs probably hate part 6 and 7 because america</br></br></br>  can someone post the new fucked up kars art i can't find it because i'm retarded  <br> Polnareff dies against Vanilla ice sending Iggy ahead <br> As DIO is about to decapitate Jotaro with a stop sign iggy flies down and farts to distract him <br> Gets kicked the shit out of and appears in Part 5 in one of those dog wheel chairs <br> The Fool Reqiuem <br> It gains the ability to manipulate sub atomic particles like it could with sand, allowing it to deconstruct anything on a subatomic level <br><br>Sounds good</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Part 6 wasn't as popular due to the complicated Heaven plot and bizarreness getting too much I guess and Part 7 didn't get as much recognition since it moved to Ultra Jump without much advertising for it.</br>  <br>No but neither did Josuke or, when you think about it, jolyne and Johnny.<br>Essentially you just need to take, how they fight, their pain thresholds, physical strength and physical competence into account. <br>Either way Jonathan comes out on top in every list. So at least we have one thing everyone can agree on.</br></br></br>  <br>It's selling well but it never had a chance of being as big as the major parts in either popularity or awareness. It was the subject of that huge ad because it it was for Ultra Jump's anniversary and Jojo is by far the biggest draw that magazine has at the moment</br>  <br>Six and Seven are great parts. Six gets over looked far too often. Sure people get really salty that it essentially ended the main continuity but if you reread the series it really does stand up as an amazing part. I found part 5 to be much better in retrospect as well. Still the worst part  along with 1 and 3  but MUCH more enjoyable than the first run through.</br>  <br>Yeah but he still seems to have more gains than a 19 year old girl. Realistically I could see Giorno being stronger than her physically</br>  <br>I love 6 but it sure is one hell of a mixed bag. <br><br>I suspect some of the hate comes from people who binge read the series and get burnt out when they finish a part all about crazy fights, then meet a new cast and immediately go back to more crazy fights. It might be a good idea to take a little break between reading 5 and 6.</br></br></br>  <br> Polnareff get Fisted instead of Kakyoin <br> Jotaro retires thanks to Dio's RoadRoller <br> Kakyoin Surprises Dio with Emerald Splash <br> ??? <br> He wins <br><br>Part 4<br><br>Jotaro is fucked up thanks to a Roadroller fuckin exploding on him<br><br>He sends Kakyoin to go out searching for Josuke<br><br>Angelo fight goes as normal<br><br>RHCP still goes as normal beaten by josuke (and later okuyasu)<br><br>Josuke and Kakyoin go hunting , kakyoin emerald splush the rats meanwhile Josuke heals Kakyoin<br><br>The Mysterious Yoshikage Kira , Kak get's fucked up by sheer heart attack and Koichi gets act 3, later Kira comes by and Kakyoin regain consciousness and punch him like he did with Tower of Gray and Kira change his face<br><br>Kira's Final Stand, just when Kira is going to activate Bite the Dust again, Koichi uses act 3 in him to give Kakyoin time to use smerald splash and Kira Rip</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What gains?

Plus, the arrow fell out of GER after it fucked up Diavolo, so Kakyoin probably wouldn't have requiem permanently.</br>  <br>So GER causes fate to become death but Divolo's stand ability makes in relive the future?</br>  <br>So does the Stand has to stay in contact with the Arrow continuously for it to have a Requiem form? pfft, you're talking about a Stand that is perfectly capable of constricting anything, that isn't gonna be a problem.</br>  <br>Can someone explain to me how it works?<br><br>As far as I know he can "vaguely(?) see the future and 'erase' time." <br><br>I don't even know what the erase time part means.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> avdol survives <br> burns gay vampires bitch ass <br>  jotaro gets crippled due to road roller <br> sends out avdol <br> burns water guy <br> burns RHCP guitar and fucks him up <br> burns rats <br> looses to SHA and and koichi gets Act 3 <br> burns kira and kira gets a face transplant <br>  burns his ass when Act 3 freezes him in final fight <br><br>I wish araki did this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He erases time, during the erased time everyone is on autopilot, afterwards everyone feels like time skipped. During the erased time Diavolo sees everything that will happen like you would see it on an animation reel.<br>If you were to shoot a bullet at Diavolo and it would hit him during the erased time, the bullet would continue on its original path through Diavolo but would not actually hurt him because he erases effect along with time, after the erased time the bullet would be behind him.<br>I still have no idea how the "future you" thing works though</br></br></br>  <br>or kira doesnt even get BTD cause he burns up kiras dad</br>  <br>We don't actually know if you can force the arrow to stay in because we've only seen two of them for a pretty short time. Beyond all that, I vaguely remember requiem stands are separate beings that don't have users, so you'd run the risk of the stand just fucking off and not listening to you.</br>  Would you a pillarwoman?

It's been a long time since I've seen this series.</br></br>  <br>Are professionals somehow perfect now?</br>  <br>Not mad, just stating the obvious</br>  <br>That's a rookie mistake, "professional" subs shouldn't have something like that</br>  <br> defending CR <br>Oh, I forgot, it's summer</br></br>  <br>It's literally missing just one key register.<br><br>I can't believe how much people whine about tiny typos in professional subtitles that they don't even pay for in the first place. Did your brain somehow fail to understand the scene because it said "Yoko-san"? Because if it did, I think we have more important issues at hand than the missing K.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nice try Daiz</br></br>  <br>soon. He even manage to make her punch him willingly</br>  <br>So every typo is forgivable because of you understand things because they're implied?</br>  Is anyone else feeling a bit underwhelmed by the third season so far?    <br>Yes? You make it sounds like the subtitles are the most important part and not understanding the scenes.</br>  <br>Nigger what? Eclipse were speedsubs.</br>  <br>You're being a little bitch.<br>Would you rather wait longer for the new episode so they can triple check it just for you?</br></br>  <br>No.</br>    <br>You must've started watching anime this summer if you think this is worth whining about.<br><br>When it comes to anime subtitles, this is just a fucking drop in the bucket. We've had to deal with a lot worse stuff for decades.</br></br></br>   fighting over subs <br> not using the raws <br>Fucking plebs</br></br>  <br><br><br>Daiz pls</br></br></br>  webm when?  This doesn't look like beer.   people is actually defending crunchyroll <br><br>I know they're summerfags or newfags, but still is fucking sad</br></br>  <br>I would rather them be competent enough to not make these simple fuckups in the first place, especially since they're getting paid for it.</br>  <br>Are you saying that you have never made a typo and you are in fact paying for a Crunchyroll subscription?</br>  <br> dirty talk </br>  <br> he called me summerfag! <br> no you're the summerfag! </br></br>  <br>I've never been paid to make a typo.</br>  <br>Are you saying you work for Crunchyroll and you're the one that made the typo?</br>  <br>I hope someone is paying for you to be a whiny bitch on an imageboard. Otherwise this isn't really a good way to spend your time.</br>  <br>First episode was kinda slow as per usual but this episode was amazing. Did you even watch it?</br>  <br>So you're the one that made the typo? What a faggot</br>  <br>I hope someone is paying you to shill for CR.</br>  <br>Says the guy that's bitching on an imageboard about people bitching on an imageboard</br>  <br>No, I never make typos. I am in fact perfect.<br><br><br>I would love to be paid by Crunchyroll for posting this. That seems like the easiest job in the world since it doesn't even require advertising Crunchyroll.</br></br></br></br>  <br>entire ending or just the part with Yamada?</br>  <br> enjoying the chapter <br> suddenly ed starts <br> is it over already <br><br>I haven't felt like this in a long time, I need next episode NOW</br></br></br></br></br>  DDY are legitimately the best subs for this. M33W were surprisingly bad, mostly because of incosistencies with the kohai-senpai scene and just poor editing in general. FFF were a little stilted though not bad, but considering DDY have a localised track and are more likely to release on time why bother.  <br> on 4chan <br> being perfect <br>Nope</br></br></br>  <br>I can't drink beer and have never seen it. So I just assumed that was accurate but is that really not what it looks like?</br>  1 &gt; 3 &gt; 2<br><br>This is fact</br></br>  <br>DDY subs are usually the best choice for any show these days. Well, it's not like there's a lot of choices.</br>  <br>Beer doesn't stick to the sides and look so viscous. Anyone would guess they're looking at an empty beer mug though.</br>  <br>Anyways, here's the part with Yamada.</br>  Inami is  hot <br><br>But damn, only one episode of Working a week isn't enough. Think I gotta rewatch the first two seasons.</br></br>  <br>I like how she faints while standing.</br>  <br>I under stand the first pass out but the second eludes me, did she faint again hearing the dirty talk Yachiyo was spewing?</br>  <br>I think she was still out of it since her close encounter.</br>  <br>She hasn't cooled off from overheating.</br>      <br>Still like the second ED better. Nothing beats Yamada and Soma egging on Takanashi with tambourines, also Poplar shaking her assets.</br>  <br>I think that might be the closest a dude has ever gotten to her without getting a punch in return. Does Inami not take the bus or the train to school? This is Japan after all.</br>  <br>She takes a shortcut, where she met Kirio.</br>  I was thinking this episode was pretty slow but then the next thing I know it's already finished.  <br><br>She takes shortcuts through seldomly travelled back-streets to avoid as much human contact as possible whether it is for school, work, or everything else</br></br>  <br>It was closer in S2, see <br>She has been fainting with Takanashi for a while now and resisting with others as was shown in ep1.<br><br>Also she says "chika~" here, i.e. "he's too close", not "chikan".</br></br></br></br>  <br>How did she not recognize him? Is he that different lookin' without the glasses?</br>  Fuck, I don't know what's wrong with me. <br><br>I have no idea what this anime is even about. I downloaded Rokka No Yuusha, and watched it for fifteen minutes before realising I've been watching THIS anime. <br><br>Days later, I download Overlord, and hey, the first few minutes were familiar. Took me a while to realize I somehow download THIS anime again. <br><br>Just now, I finished downloading Chaos Dragon, and GUESS FUCKING WHAT IT'S THIS AGAIN FUCK.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like he didn't recognize any of the girls.</br>  Feels weird to be legitimately excited for a show every week.  <br>It's pretty funny how you managed to download this 3 times while trying to download other things.</br>  We need to go wider. Also, it's odd that Katenashi's parents were divorced despite their family seems normal and all.  So whose subs of the 4 groups are:<br>The memest<br>Have the least typos and grammatical errors<br>Have the best type setting<br>Most accurate</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss AFK.</br>  I always thought Souma was way more sadistic than that.  <br>I thought their father was dead and that Kazue was the divorcee?</br>  <br><br> Wide Poplar <br><br>Just as I expected from someone voiced by Asumi Kana<br><br>Actually if you remembered S1  that their father is dead and it is Kazue aka the oldest that was divorced </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Yamada of the world.  Nazuna is /fa/  <br><br>They could be surplus clothings from the older sisters since she is tall enough for them already</br></br>  <br> Mazui <br> Rori <br>   __gg___ </br></br></br>  <br>gg was renamed to  commie </br>  I want Satou to get NTRed.  I waited so long for this and is it really happening.  <br> happening <br> Working <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He sure is a fag.</br>  Why they always pair Souma and Yamada? it's not like they become an actual thing.<br><br>Feels bad for Poplar though, literally thirdwheel in the ending, but it's not like she cares anyway, it's just a bit funny.</br></br>   Takanashi's phone background is a water flea   <br> he doesn't know </br>  <br>I think I'm developing a new fetish</br>  <br>I think it's more to do with the fact she sees a guy first then tries to determine if he's friendly or not.</br>  cutting cabbage is suffering  <br>Such a spherical cabbage, reminds me of something.</br>  <br>wonder what</br>  <br>You missed the t.</br>  <br>Satou looked really gay there.</br>  <br> Why they always pair Souma and Yamada? it's not like they become an actual thing. <br>Because, other than Satou, Souma's main relationship is Yamada, even though it's a sibling-like relationship.<br><br>It's funny, because in the new omake-like series, she tried hooking Souma up with Kisaki (from the Web Working series), since she fit the "intelligent, sadistic big breasted blonde" he once told Yamada he liked.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want CR subbers to leave</br>  <br> gif <br> 1280x720 </br></br>  <br>It does, actually. It's well known amongst beer enthusiasts that the more lacing exists around a glass = fresher, better.</br>  <br>And you missed an appointment with an optometrist.</br>  <br>Want to get glassed cunt?</br>  <br>R.I.P. in peace Triad.</br>  <br>No. S1 and S2 were Working!!: The Inami Show.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=KMd<wbr>d2C0pnBQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>SOMEONE INTERGALACTIC</br></br>  <br>The first two openings were so good, that it set my expectations for the new one too high.</br>    <br>What?</br>  <br> It sold like shit <br>It didn't. <br><br><br>The anime pretty much got the ending of the Manga as far as I know, so there would at most be an OVA.</br></br></br></br></br>  The episode was fun as well, but CR's translation was sloppy.<br>For example, there's the scene in which Souma compares Satou to Kazue, and the translation has Takanashi say "I hate when Satou-san is like that" whereas he actually say "I would hate a Staou-san that is like that (as in, behaving like Kazue)".</br>  <br>No, we cannot get a second season for SxS due to the way the anime ended.<br>The SxS anime adapted the manga up to volume 3 and had Hasebe tell Lucy it was his father that allowed her have that name and he also confessed his feelings.<br>This is a problem because the 4th and final volume is pretty much about Hasebe agonizing at his inability to tell Lucy all that.</br></br></br>  Am I the only one who wants to punch this thing to death?  <br>The himouto is to be protected and nurtured. So that she can one day finally grow up to be a stellar lady of grandeur. <br>Just back off.</br></br>  <br>I'd give her a swift kick</br>  <br>No.<br><br>She gives off Yukkuri Vibes</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to scold her gently and raise her to be the wonderful woman my imouto should be</br>  <br>I dont get the hate shes just a lazy piece of shit like everyone else</br>  <br>Nope, I feel the same way.</br>  <br> Yukkuri <br>Don't start. We already had a yukkuri thread the other day, I can only take so much.</br></br>  <br>I only hate her because <br><br>I honestly think I'd be fine with her if she stayed in her normal form.</br></br></br>  <br>I think alot of it comes from the fact that she's a lazy shit and still manages to be perfect in everything she does despite doing virtually nothing to hone any of her talents.</br>  <br>Bitch throws tantrums when she doesn't get what she wants.<br><br>She's a spoiled rotten human trash.</br></br></br>  <br>You're right, but I still don't get the hate for that. There are people who can breeze through high school while being a lazy sack of shit. She's a comic exaggeration of that, especially with her piano skills, but it's not complete fantasy.</br>  <br>She studies diligently in school and keeps her spirit up at home.</br>  Nope.  You wouldnt bully a hamster  Is she like one of those annoying touhou heads that are meant to be hated?  <br>That's the thing, it's only in school.<br><br>To get perfects across the board you are at least studying and training outside of it.</br></br></br>  <br>That's probably a common response.</br>  <br>why are you an edgy little shit?</br>  <br>Yes, she's just a glorified shithead Yukkuri.</br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> To get perfects across the board you are at least studying and training outside of it. <br> Wasn't the case for me. </br></br>  <br>Well anyone can lie on an anonymous board.<br><br>But I'm sure answers to everything came to you automatically.</br></br></br>  <br>The important thing is to never fall behind. If you can manage to do that without studying at home then good for you. <br>It's really not that crazy of a thing.</br></br>  UMR chapters &gt; later Komaru chapters &gt; early Umaru chapters<br><br>After it becomes less about her being spoilt, she becomes more likable. Especially when we get UMR.<br><br>She's just got great genes and is talented. <br><br>Her brother would be in a better job if he wasn't going with his friend circle.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why I would lie about this.</br>  <br>Edgy.</br>  <br>Because Mary Sue/Gary Stu is just a fictional trope.</br>  I hate her home persona because she's a fake NEET, and I hate her outdoors persona because she's perfect because of "luck".<br><br>Actually, the whole story comes off as disingenuous and disgusting. Glamourizing the NEET lifestyle is a destructive cultural trend.</br></br>  <br>Well, I was also an autistic, friendless asshole if it makes you feel any better.</br>  <br>See, the thing is it's not crazy to do ok and pass while being lax, tons are able to do it. But to be at the absolute top of the class while being a lazy shit?<br><br><br> She's just got great genes and is talented. <br>Well that could also be a reason others might hate her as she was simply born perfect.
