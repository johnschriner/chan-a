[ Has watching anime given you any weird fetishes?  Toothbrushing  Handholding  <br>I blame /a/ for that. Shit, fuck you guys.</br>  <br>All of them</br>   It's time.   Time for what?  <br>hardcore gay sex</br>  Not yet.  What a great week it has been  Hype.  <br>Too bad the anime sucks compared to the manga</br>  <br>it couldn't possibly live up to the standards of the manga</br>  <br>It's literally a 1:1 adaption. The only downside is that its pace is too fast</br>  <br>They're not leaving anything out and now we get to hear the jokes which makes them even funnier, why are you all complaining about. The shower scene was ten times funnier than it was in the manga</br>  <br>The art is ugly (what's with the colors?), the animation is low quality, the voice actors they picked spend all their time yelling, and yeah the pacing is way too fast</br>  <br> what's with the colors? <br>Why you want every single anime to look the same? I think it's refreshing and it goes well with the realistic style. About the rest of your statements, you must be trolling.</br></br>  Stop arguing and let's talk about what really matters: would you?  <br>Not for Gakuto it hasn't.</br>  <br>It objectively looks like shit, go ask /ic/. The shading especially is so bad I feel sick</br>  <br>No</br>   gintoki and hijikata <br> laughing like this with each other <br>Why do I feel like crying?  Are they really leaving? ;_; </br></br>    Didn't we just have a thread? Oh well  <br>My dick feels very good about it</br>  <br>You don't need to love someone to give him a good dicking though.</br>  The last thread was merely some days ago, what the hell? Can't we just decide to have a specific day of the week for this?<br>I'll just leave this here and go away</br>  <br>Is it bad that I really, really want Suna to have a gay crush on Takeo. God, the suffering</br>  <br>How about every day?</br>  <br>Disgusting slut.</br>  <br> really want Suna to have a gay crush on Takeo <br>Friendly reminder that he neither confirm nor deny it</br></br>   garo s2 has female lead   <br> confirmed, denied <br>what the hell did my brain do</br></br>  <br>gotta milk the fujoshis</br>  <br>We know what they're doing and yet here we are talking about it, it's inevitable</br>  <br>The dream is dead</br>  <br>Not like it was going to continue the first anime anyway.</br>   shoujo manga <br> not pairing up every single dude with a girl at the end <br>I remember how all the turbohomos in Fruits Basket were straight and paired up with girls</br></br>  <br>You talking about Oremono? Yeah, after the last two episodes I have a strong feeling Suna is going to end up with Saijou</br>  <br>Don't trust Gorilla, there have been to many fake outs this arc, they'll be back eventually, probably to swoop in at the last minute to save Gintoki and crew from something.</br>  <br>Things were different during CLAMP's golden days</br>  <br>Do they even draw new stuff anymore?</br>  <br>That's because girls are into turbohomos, so you can't go wrong with straight turbohomos in shoujo manga</br>  <br>xxxHOLiC: Rei recently came back then when went immediately back to hiatus</br>  <br><br> What are you talking about? We had one on Wednesday and one today. It's been Wednesday/Saturday for months now.  <br><br><br>This page and the salutes in this and the last chapter really hit me hard.<br><br> tfw when your husbando get's a manga canon arc focused on him only to get fucked over multiple times, scarred and then he fucks off to god knows where. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't believe I watched the entire CCS series when I was little without noticing how gay these two were. Was I that stupid?</br>  <br> every time they got interrupted by Ruby Moon in S2 </br>  <br>Oh? Last thread felt way more recent than that, but I guess that's just me then. Time goes fast when you're having fun</br>  <br> Tf his faggot has been your husbando since the 90s <br> tf him and his other form are raging faggots <br><br>I want to hope for a Yue figure but the chances could be very low but at the same time someone from said a GSC rep from a panel announced a very big CCS fig.

At least he seems to finally be winning the Otae bowl, I'm happy for him.</br>  <br>Too bad that all the boys in this show except for MC are fucking ugly</br>  <br>I was really so little when I watched this that I didn't even know what sex was and I still wanted them to fuck. I can't explain the feeling but I still remember it</br>  <br> wanting to fuck more than one guy per show <br>Slut detected</br></br>  <br>Same here, I only noticed gay stuff in manga by the time I was 15/16, everything before that I was completely oblivious in retrospect</br>  <br>You gotta problem with Assman?</br>  <br> I only noticed gay stuff in manga by the time I was 15/16 <br>There really wasn't a lot gay stuff in the 90s anyway</br></br>  <br> It's been Wednesday/Saturday for months now. <br>No, it hasn't and I really suggest you to check the archive before replying. These threads were a weekly thing, but now  that it's summer  it's become more and more frequent, we're having two-three per week and we all know this isn't right.</br></br>  <br>The only thing keeping me alive is the knowledge that we're getting animated soul switch arc this cour</br>  <br>There's Tsubasa World Chronicle running, but barely any Kurogane and Fai, sadly.</br>  <br>Still, there were quite a few actual homo characters (and a few fujobait ones)</br>  <br>Soon</br>  <br><br>How homo is it?

I'd even like to see some good male GKs, even if that means I'll probably never own them.</br></br></br>  <br>Who cares about some slutty old fart.</br>  <br>The PR department really fucked up, the show should have gone for fujo audience</br>  <br>Is that Gundam?</br>  <br>Speaking of FFF, Hoozuki OVA still isn't subbed, right? I found a subbed version of the 2nd OVA but the audio quality gave me ear cancer, so I deleted it.</br>  <br>It's nowhere I would look.</br>  <br>Or not, they're probably setting up him and Angelina as a couple<br>I doubt Nagasaki + Maruto combination will do anything fujo</br></br>  <br>Fuck you, I had completely forgotten I wanted this.

I'm not really interested in swordboys, but it spells good things for the industry. Plus, Alter might deliver some more Tales characters or other Altair figures. And, like I said, I'm always interested in seeing the GKs, even if I can't have them. Companies might pick up popular GKs as well.</br>    <br><br>I had no idea about that, sorry. Holy heck, now I'm exited. Let's hope it actually sells</br></br>  <br>Samurai Flamenco</br>  <br>I miss Hourou Musuko so much. I grew up alongide all of them and now they're just gone.</br>  <br>One of them was a gril, check your privilege, Anon</br>  I want to impregnate Kuroko.  They'll probably have an announcement of either Clear or Mink's Nendo, while showing off the Kojaku prototype.  <br>It has a dick, it's a man.</br>  <br>All of the doujins would have Nagisa topping anyway.</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with that, younger tops a best</br>  <br>I'd prefer that, as long as Kaito wasn't a whiny, crying little shit in them. Wait, who am I kidding? He's like that in the actual show; of course he'd be like that in doujins.<br><br><br>My nigga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That sounds good but there has to be switching involved. Can't let that all that do-S go to waste.</br>  <br><br>I knew you faggots would prefer that.</br></br>  <br>Kuroko a lewd</br>  <br>Don't worry, anon: Nagisa could always be a power bottom.</br>  <br>Alright just finished this, I probably forgot a few, but you get the point<br><br>There were more openly gay characters in the 90's than right now, hell even Dragon Ball had some. It's probably because producers discovered they could just pander to the fujos without making it official</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I want both.  Too bad there will never be any doujins at all ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br> There were more openly gay characters in the 90's than right now <br>That's what we call nostalgia googles, anon</br></br>  <br>Wasn't Yuki postop ? iit's been a long for time since I read it so maybe I'm wrong though</br>  <br> Legato <br>Was he gay? <br>I don't remember</br></br></br>  <br>He was in the manga, it was mostly subtext in the anime</br>  <br> mfw FFF said they are doing Noragami OVAs <br>After more than 1 year passed and S2 next season, they still haven't released them.</br></br>  <br> legato <br><br>Take off your fujo goggles, son.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, but during the school festival he was wearing a suit and acting like a man. It's a shame that he wants to be a woman, he's very attractive as a man.</br>  <br>You don't agree? What open gay character have we had in the 10's? The only ones I can think of right now are No.6 maybe Samflam and that one pink ultrafaggot from Tiger &amp; Bunny.</br>  <br>Kuroko a beautiful waifu.</br>  <br>the ninja scroll villain was bi.</br>  Is Get Backer's a homo series?  <br>That's disgusting</br>  <br>Sailor Moon had a lot of evil faggots, Fiore and Fisheye too</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Leeron from Gurren Lagann, and the faggot from Macross Frontier are the only one I can think off, and even so they may be from the 2000's<br><br>So yeah, not as much as in the 90's (so far), unlike what  is saying</br></br></br>  <br>All evil are faggots<br>All faggots are evil</br></br>  <br>It has homo pandering with the main characters and a gay love triangle.</br>  <br>The manga had it's gay moments between Ban and Gin (and that guy who looks like a girl)<br><br>And the anime had this sort of official art, so yeah</br></br></br>    <br>Read the manga, he clearly has a crush on Knives</br>  <br>God, he sure looks like a Nagisa clone in that picture.</br>  <br>Mykage, OD, Katze.</br>  <br> Katze <br><br>who?</br></br></br>  <br> sort of official <br><br>Character designer simply having at it. Think of that book like a doujin.</br></br></br>    <br>Whose the white haired guy between Griffith  Griffith isn't gay, just does what he needs too so that he can advance  and Sensui?</br>  <br>He only liked to cuddle cute animals <br>The main evil dude and the green guy from gayer</br></br>  <br>Doc Muraki from Yami no Matsuei</br>  <br>He was the only one who admitted that he liked boys, even the rest were gayer</br>  <br>There were those dudes in Tenshi ni Narumon</br>  <br>But in the same scene he said it would be better to be popular with girls when the others started with their faggot shit</br>  <br>/m/ reporting in</br>  <br>Maybe I should try getting into mecha</br>  <br> openly saying "I like dicks" <br> something said while brainstorming <br>Which one do you think matters the most? Why can't you accept homo Yumoto?</br></br></br>  <br>Never finished that anime<br><br>Did Green end up with Blue or with the main villain? I vaguely remember the villain was gay for him or something</br></br></br>  <br>Those scenes look cherry-picked as fuck</br>  <br>I miss the love ;_;</br>  Would you let Nagisa hug you, no bloodlust involved?    <br>Hey fellow /m/an</br>  <br>That's the joke big guy.</br>  <br> Evangelion 2.0 <br> Not Evangelion 3.0 <br>This chart desperately needs to be updated.</br></br></br>  <br>It sold well, we'll get an S2 right?</br>  <br>That's the joke. Some of them are legit, though.</br>  <br>Main villain won the Greenbowl</br>  <br>But Evangelion 3.0 is actually homo so that's not a joke<br><br>I hope so. They're still doing events and releasing new songs which means it still hasn't been forgotten</br></br></br>  <br>Any bros around? Fourth BD came out.

I had zero expectations about that show but I enjoyed myself more than I thought I would.</br>  <br><br>You already forgot boku no youknowwhat?</br></br>  Is the MC's best friend in Ranpo Kitan actually gay?<br><br>And speaking of that, I hear genshiken raws came out but missed the thread, how are we on the Madarame front?</br></br>  <br> Umehara saying those lines <br>I need to rewatch this</br></br>  <br>Don't worry you disgusting shotacon, Gil-ko will show up soon enough.</br>  <br>You poor thing, I'll pray for your soul</br>  <br>There's a reason I specified boyish. I don't want more trap shit.</br>  <br>What? When did he said that clearly? The closest thing I remember is when he said his heart fluttered when he saw tough guys in movies when the others were explaining what makes a man popular with other dudes<br>Everything homo on Bouibu was always so over the top and played for jokes that in the end nothing felt actually gay for me, but since there were no women in the anime I guess we'll never know</br></br>  <br> not expecting comedy gold good times from Gintama and DT staff </br>  <br><br>It is.

I watched half of the first episode the other day.<br><br>I wanted to give it a try, perhaps I should just wait for a SM anime.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gintama is fine but I found DT kinda boring.</br>  <br>Is it the one with okama lust?</br>  <br>His episode hasn't even aired what are you talking about  but yes, I will watch it </br>  <br>source?</br>  <br><br>Kagamine Len from Vocaloid.</br></br>  <br>Well I don't know how much gayer you could get, he clearly lusts him.</br>  Echizen makes me want to commit a crime.  <br>I know it hasn't aired, but hope it airs soon.</br>  <br>That was the previous BD released a month ago.</br>  <br>That's a matter of debate.</br>  <br>How does it feel to have a cute boy's dick pushed against your neck?</br>    <br> tfw you're so close to the boipussy <br>I swear, Kobayashi is doing it all on purpose.

Fujobuck is the strongest currency in the world.</br>  http://exhentai.org/g/836210/b9618c<wbr>3da0/</wbr>  <br>Please no. I don't need another nicely animated yet mediocre show with shitty and pointy designs.</br>  <br>What would be the plot? Cute boys doing cute things, obviously, but what kind of things?<br> cute boys in a supernatural studies club <br> accidentally release an ancient eldritch horror upon humanity <br> terrifying   and cute  adventures involving resealing the evil they have unleashed</br></br></br></br>  <br> a gay couple <br> in non-BL <br>Stop moving the goal posts and enjoy two boys being close to each other. In fact, I like it better when a pairing is really close but not confirmed to be actually gay. Confirmed gay takes all the fun out of it.</br></br></br>  <br>How much did Free sell anyways? More than their popular moe stuff like K-On and Lucky Star, or about the same? They must be selling a lot of merch anyways</br>  <br>You'll die alone.</br>  <br>I think it sold about as much as Lucky Star, nowhere near K-ON though.</br>  <br>Confirmed homo is shit.

I love "coming of age" book/movies/etc.<br><br><br>Tell us, anon. I want to know.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's their most popular series since Haruhi, plus truckload of LN/Merchandises, etc</br>  <br> How do you guys feel about card games? <br>I've never really cared much for children's card games, but I hear one of the later seasons of GX gets pretty dark, so that kind of piques my interest a bit.</br></br>  <br>It's weird shit.<br><br>Are magical boys best when their outfits are actually boyish, or do you prefer them crossdressing?</br></br></br>  <br>Haru has a glorious face.</br>  <br><br>he's only cute as a shota, regularly he looks like a stupid asshole</br></br>  <br>Not familiar with Yugioh but I will start Arc-V soon<br>Buddy Fight is okay, the boys are cute<br>Vanguard has cute MC and very homo plot but the games are super boring especially before darkness Aichi</br></br></br>  <br>Whatever you say, Ruprecht.</br>  Kekkai Finale never, husbando confirmed ded  <br> I hear one of the later seasons of GX gets pretty dark <br>And gay. The latter half of S3's plot can best be described as Judai fucking everything up to save his boyfriend.</br></br>  <br> Are magical boys best when their outfits are actually boyish, or do you prefer them crossdressing? <br>Crossdressing is a pretty big turnoff for me, so I'd rather magical boys avoid that. I'd prefer some sort of lewd bodysuit. The tighter, the better.</br></br>  Why are pecs so much better than girltits?  <br>That would be the shit. Honest coming of age seemed to die with the World Masterpiece Theater.</br>  Based Tosh  When is the shota Makura no Danshi episode gonna air?  <br>That guy on the left is disgusting as fuck. Why do I keep seeing him so much?</br>  <br>Gee, maybe you like boys. Ease up the funposting.</br>  <br>No idea, the order of them is completely random and there's no info for anything, you just need to watch all of them and wait.</br>  <br>See, that sounds great, but I don't know if I can sit through several episodes of ridiculous card battles to get there. Even if Judai has the most tolerable hairstyle of any Yu-Gi-Oh protagonist.</br>  <br>In due time.</br>  New ITW chapter got scanlated  would you let him unify you  <br>he looks like a lobster so no</br>  <br>Not ugly, he's just there and has no existence outside of haru.</br>  <br>Gel-chan is cute! Cute!</br>  <br>It says something about the show when majority of the main males wear heels.</br>  <br>Maybe once he unifies his stupid strands of hair.</br>  <br>Are we reposting things in the same exact thread?</br>  <br>I agree, Makoto is not attractive at all. Just his body is. He looks retarded.</br>  <br>Because they're nice and firm and not saggy cow tits. Are you a fellow bara tiddie enthusiast from a thread the other day?</br>  <br>makoto looks like a muppet in this picture</br>  <br>I like him but those eyelashes are such a turn-off.</br>  <br> Buddyfight <br>My god, why did they make one of the "buddies" like this. Doesn't really help that the shota master is always clinging on him.</br></br>  Whatever happened to Oni Scans' translation on this?  Which suffering twin would you fuck?  <br> It was obvious that GERURURURU was male when Tsubasa hugged him in the bed. <br><br>Wat. How?</br></br></br>  <br>I like his eyelashes. It's no doubt his character design was meant to stereotype what Japan sees as gay but despite that I really like him.</br>  <br>That body type with his personality is just unsettling, that's probably why I never found him particularly attractive. <br>It works for Sousuke though.</br></br>  <br>It's because the series is SO progressive and masculinity is fucking toxic!</br>  <br>Jesus, anon. I was just about to ask  about the scans for suffering twins. We're never getting the next chapter, huh?</br>  <br>That's the gap moe he has.</br>  <br>Sousuke a best</br>  Just when I thought this show couldn't get better  It's nowhere near as good, but you suffering twins fans could check <br><br>1001<br><br>https://www.mangaupdates.com/series<wbr>.html?id=79434</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, everything about him is a turn off.</br>  <br><br>Can't believe Tsuritama is one of the straightest show he did.</br></br>  Best boy backstory when.  <br>This and Vanguard have a lot of great doujins. I always feel so bad for fapping to this, but not knowing shit about the show.</br>  <br>Never if they're going to insist on wearing those terrible pants all the time.</br>  <br>I really want to see a Mahou Shounen that's not just a parody of something.</br>      <br>gay</br>  <br>Yowapedal seems to pull it off, but yeah, they're pretty fucking ugly. <br>Are those pants worse than Fate's male uniform?</br></br>  <br> Sohoku has ugliest uniforms but best boys <br> Kyofushi has ugliest boys but best uniforms <br> Hakone is happy medium </br></br></br>  <br>Yes. That's how brown boys get created.</br>  <br> that hand on Onoda's hip <br>It looks comfy as fuck.</br></br>  <br>He looks like lobster so yes.</br>  <br>Takumi getting  gently cuddled by Soma  doujins when.</br>    <br>Fuck that. I just want best bros to have fan art, period.</br>  <br> summerfag boogeyman <br>I just went back to November in the archive and it was still twice a week. Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>If you can get into the game even a little bit the card battles are actually pretty fun to see. I didn't even know much about the card game prior to watching GX, but it looked so entertaining it made me sign up on Dueling Network and try some duels for real.<br>The side characters are all pretty great too, they each get lots of development. <br><br>Anyways, you should give it a chance.<br>I'll throw in a link with the good subs for good measure:<br>https://mega.co.nz/#F!UZEESKjB!8XT8<wbr>uUu5_j9k57Jyvdz34Q</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> tfw /m/ has better homolust threads that /a/ </br></br>   http://oshix3.tumblr.com/post/12495<wbr>1331090/title-eyes-on-me-rating-nsf<wbr>w-pairing-miyuki-x</wbr></wbr> <br><br>Finally a decent Kyuugou DnA Porn doujin.

I've never found him to be a sluttish.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope I can skip the anime parts in the novels safely.</br>  <br>I never understood it either. Seems like some sort of epic maymay to me.</br>  <br>He's a slut for  grills </br>  That Touken flood. I'm still just waiting for one best boy. Please deliver, MH.  Saitama figma new? I'm behind.  So homodachi, who's the best boy of the season so far? Pic related, I'm really enjoying this show.  <br>This is why I'm not looking forward to haikyuu threads.</br>  <br>Probably because he dates his fangirls and makes the peace sign. Other than that I don't know.</br>    <br>But are you looking forward to volleyball owls?</br>  <br>Fug I've forgotten to download this week's episode. It's a good show but I'm not big on shounen, just love older style of manga.<br>Gonna say strongest man in the world.</br></br>  <br>Fuck yeah</br>  <br>I want to pet them  and slam their boypussies like a jackhammer. </br>  <br> 1/8 <br><br>Holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course.

Preview of the movie novel's just been released.<br> Page 2 and 3 <br><br> Same as with WSJ excerpt, with these new editions: <br><br> * Boruto is unclear on whether or not he wants to pursue the example set by his father, or part ways with it (in terms of being a ninja). He didn‚Äôt tell his mother or father about it, since other people expected him to do so.  <br><br> * Sarada is popular among her peers lately. She‚Äôs also a bit taller than them. <br><br> * They don‚Äôt know Mitsuki‚Äôs family name. The story goes that he‚Äôs not from Konoha. He aimlessly appeared from somewhere at the Academy. Before they knew it, he had assimilated into the class. Unknown parentage, etc according to Konohamaru, who‚Äôs not surprised about his many secrets. <br><br> * Since the Kage Bunshin no Jutsu was once designated as a forbidden technique, Boruto was said to be a prodigy because he could understand it at a young age.  <br><br>-----------<br><br> Page 4 <br><br> * Everyone else isn‚Äôt surprised at his Kage Bunshin though. After all, he is the son of Uzumaki Naruto. ‚ÄòLike a falcon‚Äôs chick flying through the air‚Äô. It didn‚Äôt merit being surprised over. This irritated Boruto a lot.  <br><br> Scene Change. <br><br> * White and black spotted wild animal in an undeveloped woodland. It‚Äôs eating someone‚Äôs crops. <br><br> * Panda mission= D-rank mission.  <br><br> (This ends the extended fluff inbetween what WSJ excerpt has. ) </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Page 5 <br><br> * Anyway, the Borutos swoop down with kunai in hand. He says it‚Äôs just a bear. <br><br> * Sarada is more concerned about minor details. She says it‚Äôs a bear that‚Äôs an atrocious panda. <br><br> * Boruto says it‚Äôll be easy. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs just an ordinary, lame panda ‚Äòdattebasa.‚Äô <br><br> * Sarada tells Boruto 'Quit messing around. Stupid Boruto!!' <br><br> * (Something something about genus classification about Pandas and Bears. Not important) <br><br> * According to Mitsuki, they are meant to herd the kuma-panda.  <br><br> * But it roars and starts running towards Boruto and comrades.  <br><br>------------------<br><br> Page 6 <br><br> * It‚Äôs not afraid of people and weighs about one ton <br><br> * Mitsuki stretches his arm out like a rope. It‚Äôs like a lasso around it‚Äôs legs and breaks the kuma-panda‚Äôs run.  <br><br> * ‚ÄòShanna‚Ä¶.!?‚Äô <br><br> * Boruto‚Äôs other two Kage-Bunshin are already beating the panda in the face though. But their mission isn‚Äôt supposed to be defeating it. (Sarada‚Äôs punch isn‚Äôt suitable for the mission in terms of going for the kill) <br><br> * It‚Äôs muzzle and eyes have a lot of nerves. So it screams, bends back, and begins to run off. They can frighten it away by inflicting pain on it. It doesn‚Äôt want to die, after all. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Page 7 <br><br> * Boruto: ‚ÄòSee, wasn‚Äôt that panda easy?‚Äô Boruto is smiling because he outwitted Sarada.  <br><br> * Boruto does not hate Sarada. Sarada always keeps an eye on Boruto since they are rivals.  <br><br> *Boruto and comrades goes after the panda.  <br><br> * Mitsuki without sarcasm: ‚ÄúAs expected of the Nanadaime Hokage‚Äôs son, and the Yondaime Hokage‚Äôs grandchild‚Ä¶Eventually Boruto will also become the Hokage‚Ä¶?‚Äô <br><br> * Narrator called him a subtle boy who just says whatever he feels like.  <br><br>-----------------<br><br> Page 8 <br><br> * Mitsuki is someone who can‚Äôt read the atmosphere. „ÄéÁ©∫Ê∞ó„ÅÆË™≠„ÇÅ„Å™„ÅÑ„É§„ÉÑ„ÄèKonohamaru once told him that it was important to do so. If not, then whole organization could be ruined if one doesn‚Äôt read between the lines. But at the same time, someone who says objective things without reading the atmosphere is important too. Especially for ninja‚Ä¶ Naruto is like that. He always says honest things without sensing the atmosphere.  <br><br> * Not to say that Mitsuki can‚Äôt be more considerate. He just usually doesn‚Äôt.

He didn‚Äôt tell his mother or father about it, since other people expected him to do so. <br> Everyone else isn‚Äôt surprised at his Kage Bunshin though. After all, he is the son of Uzumaki Naruto. ‚ÄòLike a falcon‚Äôs chick flying through the air‚Äô. It didn‚Äôt merit being surprised over.

A small fragment like the Gold/Silver brothers.</br></br>  <br><br>In the original plot it was because naruto was the nine-tail's son.</br></br>  <br>More like the whiskers are a relic from the manga's pilot, in which Naruto was literally a nine tailed fox posing as a human kid.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wix<wbr>XM-Sd3X0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>new naruto trailer<br><br> naruto is gonna die <br> bolt have cho odama rasengan </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> naruto is gonna die <br>will he? it kind of looks like he knows whats bothering burrito. he will be in the shadow of naruto for the rest of his life, so he goes along with whatever the enemy is planning to give the new generation the spotlight. of course it was around this time that his generation stepped up and was recognized as one of the strongest</br></br>  <br> bolt have cho odama rasengan <br>Salad should just quit now and bend over.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't die, he just gets kidnapped and then Sauce goes rescue him.</br>  <br>No it wasn't until part 2 that his generation was recognized.</br>  <br>you didnt saw the trailer ? he is gonna die in a nuke</br>  <br>no they were recognized early on as being exceptionally good. since they were fucking genins taking on jounins and shit</br>  <br>That was just an early on theory, you can watch the new trailer and see that he dies protecting his son from an explosion.</br>  Someone finally got a hold of a decent pic of the postcard.  <br>I wonder against who is Boruto using that giant rasengan it is not in the other dimension cause boruto is using his own clothes so maybe he plans to kill Shikadai with that or the panda</br>  <br>Salad a cute.</br>  <br>hes doing carpentry. hes gonna use it to turn a screw</br>  <br>Sauce is so autistic.</br>  <br> cucking boruto with his dad <br>shes not cute. shes like her dad</br></br>  <br><br>we literally see him fighting later by the god tree.

Boruto doesn't have Naruto's jacket in the explosion, We see Momo fighting also in that tree (You think this will happen before the chunin exams? are you stupid?) and finally, we actually have the summary out.</br>  <br>There are plotholes? st seems very complete to me</br>  <br><br>We do know. The god tree is the final stage and by then Boruto has his dad's old jacket.</br></br>  <br>Clearly the jacket blows up before that point, and the world tree fight was before that.</br>  <br>But he has his hokage cloak in the protecting scene, then later he's seen in his bijuwhatever mode without the cloak and his shirt open.</br>  <br>Get glasses.</br>  <br><br>He better re-release 700, the Uzumaki family poster and the Uzumaki family portrait with shorthaired Hinata then.</br></br>  <br>Pretending to be retarded. Got it.</br>   yfw Hinata wears a see through skirt just to please Naruto at the beach <br><br> she somehow "trips" revealing her rear end to Naruto in the see through skirt <br><br> this is how Himawari was conceived <br><br>Naruto really did luck out with her</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meanwhile Sauce popping back in the village, visiting the kages and his wife but not bothering to see his daughter for a single second is perfectly understandable and all characters are ok with it.</br>  <br><br>huh, i just watched the movie and didnt notice this scene, was this towards the end?</br></br>  <br>It's not a theory, the official summary says that the aliens kidnap him to get the kyubi and Sauce, Boruto and the kages head out to rescue this movie's kidnapped princess.</br>  <br>you can cleary see naruto almost white hair so that's a picture of them as old<br><br> both have eternal youth because eugenics and both are transmigrants <br><br> they have like 60-70 years on that picture <br><br> naruto still love her <br><br> hinata is an old sexy milf <br><br> still have sex like tennagers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When they are escaping through the tunel with the portal moons, we see Naruhina moments in them.<br><br>Most are memories but that one is showing a glimpse of their future.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That could conceivably have been Kishi not giving a shit, not necessarily autism<br><br>But out of all the things he's fucked up, he feels the need to spend some of the inauguration chapter on that shit?<br><br>That's the proof right there<br><br>Of course this is just on a glance, we've all known Kishi is autistic for years</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the memory moons were telling the future in that picture</br>  <br> we've all known Kishi is autistic for years <br><br>recent interviews hint that he's not completely autistic and freely admits that shit like SS is inexplicable bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br>What about his OTP Coolest Guy/Rin?</br>  <br>Kishi's autism is evident as soon as you try to examine the portrayal of the relationship between the two main characters<br><br>The fact that even with his autism he can recognize SS is bullshit says more about SSfags</br></br></br>  <br>i have a friend that works in a theater in japan. they have the movies already and emplyees can see any as long as they sign a kind of nda so they cant leak anything. he told be boruto gets a magical wrist band type thing that lets him transform into different creatures. he uses this in lieu of having a tailed beast in his boypussy. he sent me a promotional picture of what he looks like after the movie when the effects of the device change him</br>  <br>I know some would say it was obvious, but that last interview really made it transparently clear that Kishimoto does not give a fuck about Sakura, except out of the compromise of keeping her as heroine and beard of team 7.<br><br> Character based almost exclusively on love for other character <br> Author says explaining her feelings would be impossible and contrived as if it's somebody else's fucking fault. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Gee, Bort. How come Kishi let's you have two dads?</br>  <br><br> Sauce didn't knock up Mei <br><br>If he knew this why continue on? He could have paired him up with Samui or some random chick.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kishimoto does not give a fuck about Sakura <br>Didn't he say that the Naruto/Sakura conversation before heading to rescue Hinata was his favorite part of The Last?</br></br>  <br> Bottom left corner picture of Sakura <br><br>I didn't think Sasuke was the type to take a photo during conception</br></br></br>  <br>but sasuke apologized. that makes it all better</br>  <br>Was he laughing or not?</br>  <br>Sauce needed to knock up a Konoha girl so Kishi can get his new Uchiha waifu to eyefuck with Bort.</br>  <br>He has no tact, he was a rejected weirdo in HS, he don¬¥t understand how relationship works and he is a workholic. If you read his interviews you can see his autism leaking trough his words.</br>  <br>he never said that</br>  <br>  his hand on her throat. <br><br>anon, please. as if anyone here believes sakura's the one who got raped</br></br></br>  <br> two dads <br> two wieners </br></br>  <br>Well, The Last Sakura as well as the Sakura in Hiden is way more likeable than Kishi Sakura.</br>  <br>Raped?<br><br>Sasuke needs to do something to keep it up. You can't repopulate the clan at half-mast ya know.</br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke only cared about reviving the clan in a spiritual way. Filial Piety and all that.</br>  <br>Pic related is the most fucking insulting thing I've ever seen.<br><br>I think Sarada wants to be Hokage just so no one will be able to ignore her anymore.</br></br></br>  <br>So is there like a store that sells Uzumaki brand clothing to Naruto? Even when he was a kid he was sporting the Uzumaki logo.</br>  <br> cho odama rasengan <br>The fuck is that.</br></br>  <br> Salad the unwanted child. </br>  <br>she has naruto though. girls stop giving a fuck about their dads when they discover boys, and the one shes after is more dad than hers anyway<br><br><br>its a big rasengan</br></br></br></br>    <br> Sauce looking at Bort the way Itachi looked at him <br>It's too fucking perfect. Oh, the pottery. Goddammit Kishi. You just couldn't resist.<br><br>Oh, if only Salad knew.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A very large vanilla rasengan. Naruto usually did it with sage mode.</br>  <br>It's exactly what you think it is.</br>    Kishimoto Sarada is just Sasuke's face with glasses so people don't catch on it. SP Sarada looks a bit more girly but it makes it weird since it's a girly Sasuke.  <br>Actually all military uniforms in Konoha have the logo..</br>  <br>Shouldn't that be just Odama than? What is the "Cho" part?<br>Is it safe to assume Boruto is just a shitter like his father who can use like 2 techniques and doesn't even have a chakra beast to support him?</br></br>  <br> I think Sarada wants to be Hokage just so no one will be able to ignore her anymore. <br><br>At least she'll get plenty of dickings </br></br></br>  <br>Cho means ultra.<br>Boruto can use gentle fist, rasengan, clones, chidori, some new tech. He's more varied than his dad already.</br></br>  <br>cho means even bigger. its an even bigger bib rasengan</br>  <br>Cho is nip slang for something akin to extraordinary, or what these guys said.<br/></br>  <br>kek<br><br>Karin deserves better than that Uchichcha shitter Sauce anyways.</br></br></br>  <br> Is it safe to assume Boruto is just a shitter like his father who can use like 2 techniques <br> Shadow Clone <br> at least two types of Rasengan <br> Chidori variant <br> Gentle Fist <br> something we've yet to see <br> shuriken jutsu <br>Nah. He's probably the most varied protagonist we've seen. If anyone's the one-trick pony of this generation it's Salad. She can't even take on a panda without squishing it and all we've seen her do in the Gaiden and movie trailers is punch people.<br><br>I don't even think she can use Katon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will you appear in the movie?</br>  <br>I knew Kishi would find a way to shoehorn his husbando Itachi into the movie even after dying twice.</br>  <br> one-trick pony <br> with copy wheel eye <br>u retarded nigguah</br></br></br>  <br>its unfortunate that she ended up being the cuck in the end. sakura deserved it</br>  <br>How many dicks did you suck under that mask? Be honest pls</br>  <br>  my favourite scene is when sakura admits naruto never liked her but only wanted her to one up sasuke <br><br>i wonder who is the girl that rejected kishimoto so bad he created a character based on her just to make her the laughing stock of the series</br></br></br>  <br>She will just copy random jutsus, except I think stuff like Chidori/Rasengan can't be copied.</br>  <br>man, only like two people know his face. he could take off his mask, wear a hat to hide his hair, and do whatever he wanted with no consequences. wouldnt even need to transform. just that would be enough. he could go around shitting down peoples roof vents and theyd never find him since all he would need to do is pull his mask up</br>  <br> cuck <br>Stop using words you don't know the meaning off.<br><br>She's better way off without Sasuke anyways, he's a terrible husband and father.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She has the eye that ended up being like 90% of Kakashi's power and allowed Itachi, Madara and Coolest Guy to do whatever the fuck they felt like doing.<br><br>Her problem is having a vagina in a Kishi series and Bort hogging her dad.</br></br></br>  <br> She will just copy random jutsus <br>So she's going to be the support/medic of her group?</br></br>    <br>If moon-eye is related to Kabuto he will be the medic.</br>  <br> I think stuff like Chidori/Rasengan can't be copied. <br>Sasuke literally copied it to fight Gaara back when the show was still good.</br></br>  <br>the man she loves fucked someone else and she delivered the baby and kept the umbilical cord. if thats not a cuck then i dont know what is</br>  <br>Some translation says she ends up dealing the final blow to the panda.<br><br>It's already pretty clear who the third wheel of team Konohamaru is.</br></br></br>  <br>Most Uchiha just breathed out fire or use eye hax. Including Madara.</br>  <br> sakura isnt on the cover </br>  <br>Minato, Coolest Guy and Rin have all seen his face.</br>  <br><br> Has sharingan <br> Cant use katon <br><br>She can copy all elements anon. Imagine that shit with super strength.<br><br>Also Sarada is literally Uchiha(Sasuke) meets senju(Tsunade).<br><br>Boruto is Uchiha meets Hyuuga.<br><br>Also Sarada can gain MS, and if she needs to she can get a MS from one of the Shin clones.<br><br>Or sasuke can pass on his rinnnegan when he dies.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That translation lied to you then.</br>  <br>how mad are sakura fags about this one?</br>  <br> no Pink Shit <br>They know.</br></br>  <br> i dont know what is <br>You're right, you don't know what a cuck is, look it up.</br></br>  <br>he wouldnt be since he came from a different village. kabuto works for naruto in konoha<br><br><br>guy is in a wheelchair and those other two are dead. and the ramen girl and her dad have seen his face i think. no one would be able to identify him</br></br></br></br>  <br> Some translation says she ends up dealing the final blow to the panda <br>see<br><br> They are able to hit a vital point on the panda.  <br>That's all it says.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>will i find your picture if i do?</br>  <br>And then it mentions that Sarada has jonin-tier speed.</br>  <br><br>They are already in riots against SP.<br><br>Though I really doubt they had a hand in the layout of a restaurant menu.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128587057 <br><br>This kid is definitely connected to Kabuto.

As far as we know he don¬¥t have a relationship with Pink that is not by proxy.</br>  <br>Sasuke is not most Uchiha due to being an indra reincarnation.</br>  <br>I find it hilarious that there are fights over which cumrag gets more screentime in the promotional material when 99% of the advertising focus exclusively on the SN foursome.</br>  <br>then wheres mitsuki</br>  <br>Pretty much this. Hinata will get more screentime because her son is the movie's protagonist, just like how Sakura got more panel time because her daughter was the Gaiden's protagonist.

Why did Kishi feel the need to write "Naruto and Sasuke's offsprings are above Jonin tier at 12!"  <br>Here's a cleaner version without the hambeast's painted fingernails fucking up the shot.</br>  <br><br>Goten and Trunks. That is all.</br></br>  <br>Obviously, trough I haven¬¥t see Hinatafags being as annoying about it as Sakurafags.

Google it.<br><br>Yeah.<br><br>But the sharingan is the reason it only took him a month.<br><br> Madara <br> Itachy <br> Obito <br>All exceptional with dozens of techniques. Literally nobody with a sharingan was a one trick pony if he was given the chance to showcase all their skills.<br>The Uchiha are mostly all affiliated with Fire it's only logical they use various fire-based jutsu, especially a powerful signature move like Great Fireball.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> kakashi and itachi were both jonins at like, 5 <br>Itachi was an overblown Gary Stu and Kakashi was overrated.</br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128587744 <br><br><br>To be honest, it really isn't too far fetched that some of the legendary special chakra Naruto and Sasuke had during their children's conception.<br><br>It works with Super Saiyans and Ki, why wouldn't it work with Super Alien chakra?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mitsuki is someone who can‚Äôt read the atmosphere <br><br>Heh<br><br><br> Narrator--&gt; Sarada‚Äôs movements are perhaps Jounin level. Since Boruto is the son of Uzumaki Naruto, and Sarada is the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura, she won‚Äôt lose to him (in terms of pedigree/skill). <br><br>Good to know, then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>so then why assume she doesnt have all or most of the natures? kakashi has lightning and earth and water<br> i swear ive seen him use fire </br></br></br>  <br>Kakashi became jonin at age 13 or something like that. But they were giving away promotions because of the war. Coolest Guy became a chunnin despite pissing his pants when encountering an enemy in his last mission before "dying".<br><br>As for Itachi if it were up to Kishi he would have been named hokage as soon as he came out of Mikoto's vagina.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Kakashi was overrated. <br><br>This so much, was the previous generation just that shit?<br><br>If Kakashi was Naruto's generation he would be labeled a FAILURE.<br><br>His entire moveset consisted of basic abilities with only his flawed chidori that he ONLY developed much later.<br><br>How the fuck was Kakashi a genius?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kishi is a hack writer, it's no surprise.</br></br>  <br>The problem is that he was introduced as the sharingan ninja. <br><br>Without it, he's useless.</br></br></br>  <br> Uchiha <br> Hokage <br><br>Pick one.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Team Konohamaru is a Nurudu/Sauce/Neji hybrid a Sauce/Sakura hybrid and Sai at his best  <br>I'm surprisingly okay with this.</br></br>  <br>This, those guys don't understand the basics of chakra manipulation and element affiliation.<br><br>Why the Sharingan can't copy blood limit techniques? Because non members of a certain bloodline can't use the elements required for the KG techniques.<br><br>Kakashi was able to copy pretty much all jutsu because of his affiliation all 5 of the basic elements.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> so then why assume she doesnt have all or most of the natures? <br>We haven't seen her use a single elemental technique yet. She's an Uchiha, so he almost definitely has Fire. Maybe one of Pink's elements, too.</br></br>  <br>Both?</br>  <br>i love it when sakura fags gtfo</br>  <br>Tobirama pls</br>  <br> affiliated to all 5 elements <br> can literally learn all non-blood limit jutsu even without the sharingan <br> exceptional at taijutsu <br> His proficiency allows him to use multiple techniques at once in unison with the other to dangerous affect. During childhood, he demonstrated advanced ninjutsu prowess before even entering the Academy.<br><br>Kakashi was literally better than anyone in Narutos generation.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Though I really doubt they had a hand in the layout of a restaurant menu. <br>they think everything is sp's fault</br></br>  <br> Kakashi was literally better than anyone in Narutos generation <br>That's because his dad was apparently someone so powerful he could take on all three Sannin at once. It's genetic.</br></br>  You guys seem confused, Sharingan can copy all nature elements.<br><br>Why?Because ALL ninjas can use all 5 elements in theory it's stated that most only learn 2 in their lifetime.<br><br>Sarutobi had all 5 because he was old as shit, and given that he had no Kekkei genkai he spent his life working on those naturally.<br><br>The sharingan gives you a free pass.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shes getting fire for sure. maybe lightning from her dad. sakura can do literally all the ones naruto and sasuke cant do</br>  <br> Bort doesn't want to be Hokage but everyone thinks he should <br> Salad wants it but nobody takes her seriously  <br>I think I'm starting to see where their rivalry comes from.</br></br></br>  <br>Both.<br><br>Tobirama will be revolting in his grave.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't think Kishi would give her lighting if Boruto has it.<br><br>Naruto: Wind and Water(?)<br>Hinata:Fire and Lightning<br><br>Boruto uses chidori, and a RS type technique with his rasengan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> SS specially get butthurt because they hate to be remembered that Pink is the third-wheel <br>they really do</br></br>  <br> maybe lightning from her dad <br>Nah, that's Bort's territory. She'll get one of her mother's for maximum pottery. There's no point in making her a Raiton user when her teammate is a Pikachu. <br><br>Earth seems like a suitable element to give her, though. I think Pink might have it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we will never see the first Uchiha Hokage <br><br>kinda lame</br></br></br>  Naruto is shit  <br>Naruto only had wind, he got all 5 later because of God powers.<br><br>Minato had fire, lightning and wind.</br></br></br>  <br>The kids love that one</br>  <br> Without it, he's useless <br>Simply untrue, his sharingan granted him many advantages but he already labeled a prodigy before he had it.<br>No matter how you turn it, with his talent for both ninjutsu and taijutsu, intelligence and the ability to use all five elements he would always rise up to a top tire ninja.</br></br></br>  <br><br>True. NSfags are the same.</br></br>  <br><br>I recall it being stated his natural default two were Wind and Water by the frogs.<br><br>Sasuke of course being Fire and Lightning makes a nice constast.<br><br>Earth is as always a shit element.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>God, Kakashi in The Last was the most disappoing shit ever.<br><br>He has like 5 minutes of screentime and all he does is watch how Sauce saves his ass from becoming the hokage of the village hidden in the crater hole.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes it is. We Boruto now.</br>  <br>rolling you mean. unless you mean his rotting corpse is revolting or you mean hes staging a revolt from his grave<br><br><br><br>well sakura can do earth and water and the dumb ones like yin and yang and all that shit. seeing as how shes sakuras daughter, great chakra control is genetic. she can do those punches at her age. i dont see how she cant master, or at least get comfortable with the rest of the elements. she wont even use them anyway unless she starts using them for powered up punches</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The fact you have to defend Hokage Sharingan-less Kakashi shows how shit he is.<br><br>The question is will he have a unique moveset in storm 4 or will they say fuck it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All this Boruto and Sarada rivalry and romance can't possibly end in this movie.<br>Prepare for The Last Boruto the movie</br></br>  <br> that's just because he's an uchicha prodigy <br> that's just because he's the son of the 4th <br> that's just because he's a genius <br> that's just because he's got the demon fox chakra pool <br>Whoa stop being retarded anytime you want.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Boruto will become a Jiraiya <br><br>Sounds ok.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They said fuck it with pretty much all of the old characters except Naruto, Sasuke, Madara and Coolest Guy.<br><br>Hokage Kakashi is just an alternate costume.</br></br></br>  <br>The way I see it Burrito will get Lightning and Wind, and Salad will get Fire and Earth. That way they're both a mix of their parents. <br><br><br> The question is will he have a unique moveset in storm 4 or will they say fuck it <br>It's just a skin, so fuck it, I'm afraid.<br><br>To be honest Boruto will probably end up the most interesting addition. Gentle Fist + Shadow Clones is OP.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128588799 <br>No. And who cares? It's useless.</br>  <br> The fact you have to call me out on my ignorance show's how shit he is </br>  <br> unless she starts using them for powered up punches <br> implying that wouldn't be great <br>Burning Fist here we come.</br></br></br>  <br>ironic, since half their arguments are backed up by filler made by sp</br>  <br> and romance <br>It's just a crush. They're still just kids, after all.</br></br>  <br>will there not be a manga? this isnt just expanding on what we saw in chapter 700, i thought this was an entirely new series starting with the movie. im sure a manga and anime is on the way<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128588799 <br>he will probably get whatever the bad guy from the last had when he took hanabis eyes when kishimoto remembers that his eyes are the same but natural</br></br></br></br>  <br> Romance <br><br>Don't say anything stupid.<br><br>But yeah, SP wouldn't leave it like that.<br><br>Thing is, Kishi is done with this project. Anything after this movie or the random omake like  is GT tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128588799 <br>They finally added a 2nd trap? Good.<br><br>Also, no. But he can use their taijutsu. Which means he does at least have a Hyuuga's body.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128588823 <br>Oh you know when a character blushes like that in anime is all over. Just look at Korra and Asami</br>  <br>well played.</br>  So is it confirmed who the fuck is the enemy this time ? The so called enemy that Kaguya needed an army to fight against ?  <br>They act like a teenager chick who is butthurt that the loser guy she rejected is happier with the frumpy girl than she is with the popular bad guy who beat the shit out of her.</br>  <br><br>No sign of that threat yet.<br><br>The two aliens want Naruto and the tailed beasts because of the same reason Kaguya wanted to make an army of black Zetsu.</br></br></br></br>  <br> salad shows off her new attack <br> the fantastic flaming fist <br> fire cant hit things plus it gets blown back away from the fist with the fast movement <br> so its just a normal punch but with a fire trail <br> salad gets made fun of by the audience </br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128588823 <br>I forgot when Hinata became the first person in anime to ever blush towards someone.<br><br>Besides, you know Kishi is too much of a faggot to not make his OTP canon now that it isn't gay.</br></br></br>  <br> the frumpy girl <br>frumpy girl who ended up hotter and happier than them to boot</br></br>  <br> im sure a manga and anime is on the way <br><br>Manga is abosutely done after the gaiden, all that's left is this movie.<br><br>If you want to stay for the GT riddled filler (if Pierrot ever decides to make it), then that's all your decision.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man Everyone blames Kishi for not making Narusaku canon but the real Troll here is Studio Pierrot, Kishi didn't told them to add all of that</br>  <br><br>Man, Yuka and her goons sure did a number on Naruto and Sakura as characters.</br></br>  <br> Black Zetsu <br>What happened to that guy again, I forgot. I think one survived.</br></br>  <br>Maybe they'll get TnJ'ed and be available for teamup later</br>  <br> you know Kishi is too much of a faggot to not make his OTP canon now that it isn't gay <br>Too be fair at least he's switching it up by making the guy notice the girl first. Must be the Hinata side of his genes kicking in.<br><br>Really I'm just hoping it results in some good doujins. Salad needs her salad tossed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Since this is Burrito's story and not nardo's I'm hoping he just kills them. I'm sick to death of TnJ.</br>  <br>Just like in real life, people with ridiculous high standards end rightfully alone and bitter. Just look at Ino, she couldn¬¥t have the Sauce but she got a good husband who is there for her and their kid and she is not just a housewife like Pink.</br>  <br>Sasuke killed the original</br>  <br>shes in one so far. that faggot who did those doujins where sakura and naruto fuck and she has giant tits. hes a narusaku fag and he was so salty that he had naruto still fuck sakura all the time, salad is actually his daughter, he fucks her too. its just a journal on assmad. the anger of an ns fag</br>  <br>But Pink isn't a housewife.</br>  <br>nigga you what?</br>  <br>Ya I know that but Naruto is the only person that has the logo on his regular clothes, he also has it on his mission clothes aswell even without the chuunin vest since he went from genin to hokage.</br>  <br>Pretty sure she stalked him first. Not to mention apparently she talks about him a lot. At least according to 700.</br>  <br>She's in 2 doujins (technically three if you count 1 page at the end) and 2 of them are NS.</br>  <br><br><br>You just need to look at what Yuka did to Mecha Naruto.<br><br>He was invented for the game and was given a cute story with Naruto and Hinata.<br><br>When they adapt him to the anime, they strip him of his character, turn him into Iron Man armor and use it for Narusaku bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So far Burrito's the only one blushing. We don't know what Salad sees in him yet.</br>  <br>Pretty sure Salad is Sasuke's.</br>  <br>A lot of people blush when someone gets that close to their face.</br>  <br>It's not just the blush, is the face he pulls and the spaghetti spilling.</br>  <br> is the face he pulls and the spaghetti spilling <br>This. He's doing "that" face that all Uzumaki do when they want to fuck something.</br></br>  <br>This is anime and in anime logic like that doesn't exist. Sad but true</br>  <br>whats the other one. shes in the salty one and in one page of another<br><br><br>who knows at this point. hes been fucking and cumming inside sakura every day</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's interested on anyone with any sort of daddy issues, but that doesn't mean she wants to fuck them.<br><br>Just look how hard she was shilling Chouji and Naruto.</br></br></br>  <br>why the fuck are salads pupils so fucking big. its like shes some sort of bug or something.</br>  <br>Wait is there already a Boruto movie/show?</br>  <br>I know, it's not like she an anime character or something like that.</br>  <br>SAHARA WATARU IS FUCKING AMAZING I LOVE EVERYTHING HE DOES</br>  <br>Burrito is probably like Ed from FMA, to cocky and tsundere but at the same time too awkward and shy for romance.</br>  <br>Except there are a lot of shows that do that, especially comedies.</br>  <br>hes SHIT</br>  <br>He's also a manlet.</br>  <br> Man, Yuka and her goons sure did a number on Naruto and Sakura as characters. <br><br>not even 12 year old sakura was this shitty</br></br></br>  <br>It's an Uchiha thing.</br>  <br>get better taste</br>  <br>Keep your shitty Sunahara man, we got the good stuff<br> Soon </br></br>  <br><br> cocky <br> blonde <br> manlet <br> tsundere <br> spaghetti <br> treasures his younger sibling <br> daddy issues <br>If he gets mad when people poke fun at his height then he'll be almost a ripoff of Ed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh it looks like shes from clannad or something. its just fucking weird to me.</br>  <br> any naruto pairing <br> good <br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>He used to be fine. Then he started having pig faces and over inflating every woman's body.</br>   Never forget   <br>What forum is that? Doesn't look like NF</br>  <br><br>Not nearly as sexual as SW's.</br></br>  <br>narusaku forums</br>  <br> dat perverted Sakura with her perverted whore body and expressions </br>  <br>It sure would have been fun to be here at the time that was shown</br>  Is there already Naruto x Boruto porn out?<br>I might just end my fap stop for that.</br>  <br>Probably. There's porn of anything if you know where to look.<br><br><br>Good for reaction images and shitposting. Not for fapping.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;* Everyone else isn‚Äôt surprised at his Kage Bunshin though. After all, he is the son of Uzumaki Naruto. ‚ÄòLike a falcon‚Äôs chick flying through the air‚Äô. It didn‚Äôt merit being surprised over. This irritated Boruto a lot. <br><br> Learn a forbidden technique that needs a shit ton of chakra <br> Learn to use it without your father's ungodly chakra reserves  <br> People say it's just natural. <br>Holy shit, that is terrible. Imagine if Da Vinci's father was a super famous painter, they wouldnt' credit Da VInci for the Mona Lisa but give credit to Dad Vinci for providing the genes.<br><br>God damn, Bort.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Looks like people have already started churning out fake movie spoilers.  <br>I'm sure he'll get plenty with Mitsuki and Sasuke.</br>  <br>Few artists I've seen get objectively worse with time. It's like he publishes his works in reverse.</br>  <br>Pretty much. This is why the Burrito is butthurt about his daddy. That and he never spends time with them like he used to.</br>  <br><br>the last movie has naruto taking an attack that split the moon in half. a nuke while he's in chakra mode wont scratch him.</br></br>  <br> mfw Sasuke's master/student relationship with Boruto is actually healthier than his "bonds" with team 7 enablers simply because Sasuke has neither betrayed nor tried to kill Boruto (so far, at least). </br>  man, sex in the naruto world must get so fucking kinky. even masturbation<br> make shadow clones <br> each one transforms into something else <br> fuck or be fucked or both by all your waifus or crushes or animals or whatever </br></br></br>  <br>But NaruSasu is much hotter</br>  <br>This. Hell, he has a better relationship with the little shit than his own daughter.</br>  <br>Kishi, pls</br>  <br>It's like he's trying to give other writers fuel for Salad to go full edge later</br>  <br><br>BoruSasu is the new hotness!</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>so this burrito-salad thing is real or people are just shipping them?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But it's the only pairing with backing, anon</br>  <br> so this burrito-salad thing is real <br>You tell me. Not like people weren't shipping them prior to this trailer, however. It's just been increased lately.</br></br>  <br>Particle style is based off Earth element no? pretty awesome if you ask me</br>  <br>Nah, I like SaucexBoruto and NarutoxSarada and I waiting for the doujinshi.</br>  <br><br>she's gonna get the burrito</br></br>  <br>In my unprofessional opinion, I believe there is quite literally no reason to make the offspring of one of the main characters a girl in a shounen manga if you don't want her to get paired off with the male main character. <br><br>As its shounen, you could easily make it two guys for maximum pottery but she's not</br></br></br>  <br>You already have some for the latter, even though they all suck.</br>  <br>Quality over quantity.</br>  <br>See, here's the thing. Salad's getting all the attention of the boys her age because she's the only fuckable thing with a vagina in the entire village. Who's the competition? Chouchou? Burrito's sister?</br>  <br>Of course not. The Japanese want Inojin with her and nips get what they want.</br>  Boruto x Sarada confirmed?  <br>This, not to mention that the entire next gen is one huge sausage fest with the only available girls for the new MC being his little sister, a fat black comic relief or the only other relevant next gen character.</br>  <br>No. And it never will be.</br>  <br><br>best girl won the narutobowl so there's sill hope</br></br>  <br>This. If Kishi didn't want people to think Burrito and Salad were gonna fuck then he shouldn't have made one of them a girl.<br><br>But since he basically wrote the movie, all of this is on him, which means he wants people to think they're gonna fuck.<br><br>It's a simple solution, really. People telling you that your rivalry/friendship between two boys is gay? Make one of them a girl. Problem solved.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They wanted Sakura's life to not be pathetic</br>  <br>But Mr. editor knows that Nips want Inojin x Salad and nips always get what they want.</br>  <br> The Japanese want Inojin with her <br>Barely. <br><br><br>On Bort's end, yes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nips also wanted KakaIru and SasuNaru.</br>  <br>I don't think they care if she was pathetic or not. They just wanted Sauce to show his own brand of affection to her.</br>  <br>Gaara becomes fugly tho</br>  <br>If Kishi cared about what his audience wanted then Kakashi and Iruka would be a married couple.<br><br>If he wants his homo-no-homo rivalry/friendship/romance then by God he's going to get it.</br></br></br>  <br>Those were never going to happen because it's a Shonen Jump anime. Nice try, though. Unless you label your manga a shonen-ai that won't happen.</br>  <br><br><br>Not true. Inojin and Sarada have more fans in the states. Boruto and Sarada are all over Pixiv.<br><br>Inojin is more teased with Hima among japanese fans.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> that Nips want Inojin x Salad <br>Inojin is getting paired off with everybody</br></br>  <br>Do you seriously think that Kishi doesn't wank himself every day over the thought of Nardo and Sauce becoming grandfathers together?</br>  <br><br>Inojin is a little manslut being paired off with everybody.</br></br>  <br><br>I'd hit it. Put a dress on him and nobody would know the difference.</br></br>  <br> everybody <br>Sarada, Chouchou and Himawari?<br><br>Besides that was before the other pale bishi autist got revealed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>WHEN WILL YOU STICK IT UP MY ASS</br>  <br>It doesn't matter what he wants anon.<br>It's not like the movie will show the kid's love lives anyway.</br></br>  <br>Is that a bra under Sarada's armpit?</br>  <br> Gaara becomes fugly tho </br>  <br>I guess. Doesn't seem like it'd be an undershirt.</br>  <br> Learn to use it without your father's ungodly chakra reserves <br><br>You're getting it wrong.<br><br>Boruto learned it because he could easily understood it at his young age. <br><br>Remember that Kage Bunshin not only is an advenced technique, but also a forbidden one because it takes loads of chakra, a jounin or higher that can pull it off can only produce a determined number of shadow clones.<br><br>But if Boruto manages to use it on the same level as his father (meaning making lots of clones), It's BECAUSE of his chakra levels, considering he's an Uzumaki.<br><br>He can't really escape from it, no matter how.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128592622 <br> implying this <br><br> isn't the single, ugliest thing ever created </br></br></br>  <br> leave /a/ forever </br>  <br> It's just a skin, so fuck it, I'm afraid. <br>It's a skin because all it has to be is is a skin. Kakashi, Pinkshit or Hinata did not really change in size, so it makes more sense to have them as a skin, especially since we have previous examples of skins coming with their own ultimates, from which movesets are not that big a change from. <br>For Kakashi all you'd need to do is use the moveset of him that uses the least chidori-based techniques as the basis (there's at least one that barely uses it as I recall) and swap out the chidori for a rasengan. Neither would the other two's moveset change much, not at all with Pinkshit and just a purple recolor and maybe come combo ultimates for Hinata.<br>Of course I'm not saying it will happen, just that it could happen without too much effort involved on CC2's part.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He can only make a handful, but they seem a lot better quality than his father's. Even the Hokage can't tell which one is which, and he can bait-and-switch them perfectly.</br>  <br> especially since we have previous examples of skins coming with their own ultimates <br>Then that's fine. Come to think of it they'd have to make a new one since Hokage Kakashi doesn't have his Sharingan anymore, which means no more Kamui.</br></br>  <br> The Japanese want Inojin with her and nips get what they want. <br><br>western ss fags want it, not the japanese</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody can't tell the original shadow clone without a sharingan.</br>  <br> not the japanese <br>This. The nips are all about dat BoruMitsu, as expected.</br></br>  <br><br>People shipping them.<br><br>Maybe the movie will increase the shippers a bit, but that's a stretch.<br><br>It apparently rides too much on the SasuNaru cottails and it seems that Sarada x Inojin and Mitsuki x Sarada it's more exciting.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Apparently the Pinkshit Hiden says she and Ino started up a hospital/care home for orphans. Then we have the Gaiden where Kabuto is head of one right next to the village.<br>Maybe she had to sell it off to cover the costs of her latest chimpout, or the two coexist of something.</br></br>  <br>Yes, yes he is.<br><br>On the other hand Karin aka Best Girl is the only character that actually got prettier.<br>God she's perfect!</br></br></br></br>   Yes, there is a preview screening today for all who applied and received a ticket via the lottery system to each city's event. (7/26 in Japan). It is for fans/the public. <br><br> The doors open at 1:30PM. Event begins at 2PM. It will last approx 1.5 hours. <br><br> As I am writing this post, it is only 10AM in Japan. <br><br> Photos of people's seats and the screen in around four hours from now.

Put 2 and 2 together.</br></br>  <br>I'm calling it now: She's a robot. <br>Anna is adopted by her virgin genius farther who build his waifubot in her image.

And I skip the OPs.</br></br>  So did the actually fuck, or did she just stradle him?  <br>faggot</br>  <br>It was rape.</br>  <br><br>Something smells fishy here, why would someone just send their drool?</br></br>  <br>straddled his erect cock, she hadnt realised to jam it in</br>  Anna's crush on him only gets softer in the future, right? She isn't the type to tie him up for talking to other girls.  I don't get it. <br><br>Why was Anna drooling here? It's not like she wanted to EAT him?</br></br>  <br><br>More girls should tackle men, in order to huff their ballsweat/taint.</br></br>  <br>THIS IS THE GREATEST HIGH</br>  From "SOX", two phantoms were born   Anna clinching, both her hands, her body trembling, ‚Äú‚Ä¶Why?‚Äù <br> Tanukichi and Sophia, taking in Anna‚Äôs deposition, when, at that moment, ‚ÄúWhy?

I mean, that's gotta be the endgame of this story, right?</br></br>  Can we have a reaction thread to this episode?  <br>They're already doing a lot of illegal sexual stuff, you know? It's kind of the whole premise.</br>  <br> drooling </br>  <br> SAME PASTA EVERY THREAD <br> SAMEFAGGING WHO CAN'T READ MOON POSTING SHIT </br></br>  I want tumblr and their menstrual blood cookies to leave.  <br>don't you get it, drool is an allegory for pussy juice</br>  <br>Yeah she's cuter than Anna and has a delicious body.<br><br>Would let her volley me all over the joint.</br></br></br>  <br>There were excerpts that made it sound like he wasn't sure whom he liked.</br>     mfw this episode   <br>In the original translation for the pregnancy scene didn't he list Anna, Kajo, and Annie in his mind as soon as Anna asked who the most important person to him is?</br>  <br>Reading a shitty LN.</br>   Makes cute noises and falls asleep on his lap while being patted on the head. <br>Purest.</br>   This episode <br> This series </br>  She has a nice ass.  LNfags, does this ever stray into love triangle territory or does it stay super fun?   downloading HS version <br><br>for what purpose? Just wait for senketsu's sub rip from funi, which is about an hour after release, and use it on the ATX version. That's literally what clawhammer is but downloading senketsu's and the ATX raw is much faster.</br></br>    She has a lots of liquid.  <br> read spanish scanlation of the manga <br> it's true </br></br>  <br>Learning a shitty language.</br>  <br>That's not drool anon.</br>  <br><br>Holy fuck that is a nice ass.</br></br>  <br><br>Anna's vaginal leakage is sooo gross.</br></br>  <br>It absolutely does. What did you expect with 2 main female leads and 1 male MC</br>  <br> Keep in mind she hates sex. <br>On 2D world this translated to "not enough D" syndrome.</br></br>  <br>Not even love triangle.<br><br>It is Anna only so far.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does seeing things translated into your language feels so weird.<br><br>It's the latin american/spaniard language differences?</br></br></br>  <br>I expect Anna to beat the faker out and take her place as the one true lover.</br>  Why do you watch hetshit? Explain yourself you homo  <br>Anon please, not everyone is gay like you.</br>  <br>ZENBUS ARE QUICK TO RECOGNIZE SLUTS</br>  <br>I didn't expect this show to get my dick this hard.</br>  <br>We had it 7 hours ago When it streamed faggot.</br>  <br>I read until vol.4 faggot, there is nothing set in stone for the end game girl unless you project the first girl shit on the series you gigantic piece of autistic shit.</br>  <br>learn moon fag</br>  <br><br>Would you ?</br></br>  I want to flash Kajo  <br>What pokemon is this?</br>  <br>we're too used to get them on english first.</br>  <br> vol.4 <br>Not him, but there are 9 volumes.</br></br>  <br>Did I say she was the end game girl you mouth breathing neckbearded fuck?<br><br>Learn to fucking read, I said she's in the lead, not she's going to win you fucking home schooled dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br> That kiss <br><br>S-shit man, this is too good.</br></br></br>  Shit I came on my monitor and it won't completely come off.

Oh but somehow Hachiman is placated to completely OVER extend into "HURR I WANT SUMTHIN GENUINE TOO~". Nothing has actually changed and no recourse for this action has any merit and so long story short this fucking meme that was spawned of itself in itself is literally trash writing in action.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I've heard some wierd cultural thing that in japan it's easier to get girls over 25 because that is what they see as old over there (it's not surprising considering the nationwide schoolgirl fetish) and so they feel desperate to get married of</br>  She is a good kisser.  <br>I've never been there</br>  <br> WORDS THAT KILL <br> NOT USING "DIRTY WORDS THAT KILL" </br></br>  <br>Asian culture is a completely different beast to Western culture.<br><br>Asian girls are expected to be married by or before the time they reach their 30s.<br><br>Most relationships after you get to the 20 year mark, the girl and her family expect you to have Marriage as your ulterior motive.<br><br>So when they get to their late and mid twenties they feel their societal clock ticking on them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to raped by Anna senpai  <br>Wouldn't it be "Slurs that thrill" then?</br>  <br>She really wants the D. Anna's pure love is transitioning into deep love.</br>  <br>You're not. Anna's a fucking creep</br>  <br>Guarantee you wouldn't notice if no one told you.</br>  <br>I don't see that happening unless they get invaded by muslims</br>  <br>Gay as fuck if you wouldn't want an attractive girl who's wet for you to give you cookies with her pussy juice baked in as an expression of her love.</br>  <br>please don't say things like that it's seriously one of my worst nightmares</br>   only 6 pages on pixiv <br>Why isn't there more?</br>  God, I love OP's and ED's that change over time.  Why.  Imagine how much of a fucking shock it was for Kajou to see her best friend, which to her and everyone else in Japan was the purest, most well manared and sex ignorant person in the entire planet, naked on top of Tanuki wtih his dick out.    <br>She got what she deserved.</br>  Kajo, a girl who's so lewd she's actually pure.<br>Anna, a girl who's so pure she's actually lewd.<br><br>Which is better?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Anon, Anna's vaginal leakage is out of control.<br><br>Besides, I think I speak for everyone here when I say none of us want Anna leaking all over us, or our sheets, or out cookies, for that matter.</br></br></br></br>  I can't be alone in thinking Kajo is top tier waifu material, right?  <br>At least on the censored version I can pretend that there are nipples beyond the censoring.</br>  <br>Can an anon please do the honors and give this semen demon some nipples?</br>  <br>yeah it's also had an effect on western foreigners who are in the country since they use that to their advantage they marry there and this will probably lead to their society becoming more mixed like the west. so pretty much this</br>  <br>You really don't</br>  <br>Kajo, fuck crazy chicks</br>    <br>What's changed?</br>  <br>Kajo. Anna is would rape you and would still stop you from saying dirty words.</br>  <br>Option A, how is that even a question?</br>  <br> i think i speak for everyone here <br><br>No, you seriously don't.</br></br></br>  <br>Anna by miles</br>    <br>No, she's just some girl that has some obsession for sex joke just for the sake of them being prohibited.</br>  <br>hey<br>you're that gay guy from the other thread aren't you</br></br>  <br>I agree with you, but do you know where you are? Anna is one of /a/'s wet dreams</br>  Scientist gal is legit mad<br><br>Rip pet flies :c</br></br>  <br>I bet my left nut Anna fucks better than Kajo</br>  <br> would still stop you from saying dirty words <br>She wouldn't let you talk because she'd want her tongue down your throat at all times, and if not her tongue, she'd want you subsisting on her love honey until she gets access to whatever you have in your cyllinder.</br></br>  <br>Anna is no longer a silhouette in the Yokusei/Seiyoku part, and during the second dance routine Anna is chasing after Okuma with her arms outstretched</br>  MY FUCKING DICK  <br>Trips speak truth, Kajo a best</br>  <br>Anna, most definitely.</br>  <br>Anna is better.</br>  <br>HIS FUCKING DICK</br>  <br>I didn't notice, good eye anon. I also love OPs/EDs that reflect the current point in the show.</br>    <br>When will they fuck</br>  <br>When Otoo finds his wife.</br>  Q: Which of the following adjectives could be used to describe Inami?<br><br>A Cute<br>B Adorable<br>C Precious <br>D All of the above</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>E Annoying as shit.</br>  <br> Annoying as shit. <br>That's yamada <br><br><br>D. <br>Just like what she want from Takanashi</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will he only be able to give it to her dressed as Kotori</br>  <br>You're thinking of popura</br>  <br>Yamada's the good and cute kind of annoying. Inami is the bad kind.</br>  Get in here fags  YAMADA IS MULTIPLYING  <br>Yamada a shit.</br>  <br>how in the fuck<br><br>yamada is blatantly irritating<br>inami has consideracy<br><br>even the characters inside the freaking show agree</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sorry you have poor taste, man.</br>  <br>Ill fight you nigga yamada is great<br><br> consideracy  <br>lel</br></br></br></br>  Based Satou.  <br>Inami annoyed the shit out of me during season 1, but she has grown on me. She also improved a bit, and more importantly, the writers stopped using her punching as the primary jokes as much.<br><br>On the other hand, Yamada is still annoying. She is still the same pest that she was since she moved into Wagnaria. Thankfully, she is relatively minor on screentime.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't know anything about Yachiyo but everything about Kyouko.</br>  So tsundere.  Goddamn Satou is a fag.  Hnnng.    This is getting frustrating.  You stupid faggot  <br> She also improved a bit, and more importantly, the writers stopped using her punching as the primary jokes as much. <br>They more or less stopped using her. Instead of replacing "punching people" with an improved joke they realized she's incapable of being funny so now she's just sort of there.<br>Yamada on the other hand has a winning shtick that has yet to get old so of course she's the same lovable self she was on S1. You don't mess with your golden goose after all.</br></br></br>   romance between Souma and Yachio will never be mentioned again   Why are they sitting like that?  <br>Yamada's shtick got old around the second episode she was in, though.</br>  <br>Their hearts hurt.</br>  <br>Clearly most people don't agree, or else they would have phased it out like they did with that wet noodle we call Inami.</br>    <br>Source?</br>  <br>http://ux.getuploader.com/anime2010<wbr>/download/62/Inamin_Shimeji.zip<br>pw: inamin</br></wbr></br>  <br>Piece of shit.</br>  <br>Congratulations. This post gave me diabetes.</br>  All i want is for Yamada to properly reunite with her brother  <br><br>Now to figure out how to add Yamada and Poplar</br></br>  Show me your hype face, /a/.  How much longer /a/<br><br>How much longer until i get my fix?</br></br>  <br>2 hours, I think.</br>  <br>more like ten minutes.</br>  <br>I had a Poplar Shimeji a couple years ago, unfortunately that computer is kaput and I don't remember where I downloaded it.</br>  <br>I NEED THAT NAO</br>  <br>Yamada is pretty cute as fuck</br>  It's out niggas.  Goddamn, Satou's spaghetti is almost too much to handle.  Reminder to download it in 1080p  This episode was literally perfect  The episode started off well but then Inami showed her fat face and ruined it all.  <br>nice</br>  IT BEGINS  <br>Nah, their shit is getting irritating. They all just need to fucking fuck already.</br>  <br>And they will.</br>  <br>Wouldn't it be a matter of just replacing the different images? I'd give it a go, but I can't be assed to sift through all the runes</br>  <br>And that will be glorious. But until that it's not okay.</br>  <br>Go read a real "just fuck already" series, scrub.</br>  WHAT IS GOING ON?  <br>see:<br/></br>    I can't handle all this character development.  <br>Goddamn, that's some cute shit. Thanks.</br>    <br>i want to punch her so hard and crash her useless cervix</br>  I like all characters, come at me.  <br>Why is she even in this?</br>  <br>You shitty little faggot, you seem like a reasonable person with good taste.</br>  <br>I hate you.</br>  <br>That just shows you have great taste, anon. Keep it up.</br>   The OP is growing on me.   Why do I hate Takanashi more and more with each passing season?<br>He kinda just seems like a dick now.</br>  <br>Why is Inami not popping up? ;_;</br>  <br>He has always been a dick to everyone except Poplar and Nazuma.</br>  <br><br>Now he just needs to give the dick to Inami, and everything will be just fine.</br></br>  Christ, only four episodes in and it's beaten out both previous seasons.  <br>Now all I can picture is Yachiyo screaming Kyouko-san while they fuck.</br>   This episode <br>Shit is just happening too fast.<br>SHIIIIIIIIIIIIIIT!</br></br>  <br>That's disgusting. You wouldn't fuck your own dog, anon.</br>  This isn't the Inami we knew and loved.<br>Working has changed.</br>  Im just now noticing the yamadas infiltrating the poplars in the opening  *sip*  <br>Holy shit, that scene was fantastic</br>   Poplar will never tell you off <br>Why even live</br>  <br>Oh my god, a real life HNNNNG. I've never seen someone actually HNNNNG before. It looks kinda painful.</br>  This episode's just been tugging at my heart strings jesus  Why is he such a bro  (literally)  when he's treated like shit?   Inami is actually going to win <br>It's been obvious for years, but come the fuck on now<br><br>Can there be one series where it isn't worst girl that comes out of it the happiest</br></br></br>  <br>Those Yamada kids are good eggs.</br>  <br>But everyone is winning. Don't tell me you thought Poplar was ever in the running for any relationships.</br>  <br> posts a good girl <br> has a shit opinion </br></br>  <br> Inami <br> win <br>There's no competition here. Inami is the only girl who likes Katanashi, and this isn't a harem, but a series with many couples.<br><br>Not to mention Inami has had good character development.<br>I understand people disliking her during S1, but ever since S2 she started working even more on her issues, and now she doesn't even hit anyone.<br><br>Seriously, the only characters in this story who cause problems and don't work on that are Yamada and Kozue, and even they have their charms.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When S1 was airing I thought Popura would end up with Takanashi and thought Inami was just slapstick relief. Now I know Popura's sole role is to be the genki oppai loli and Inami will be Takanashi's bride.</br></br>  <br> When S1 was airing I thought Popura would end up with Takanashi <br>How? Even in S1 it was clear Poplar was just the series' pet and no one's love interest.</br></br>  <br>are you stupid? unless you discarded that idea after the first 5 minutes you have to be legally a retard</br>  <br>From the way Poplar and Katanashi met in the very first episode maybe? That scene is kind of framed like your usual romantic first encounter.</br>  <br>Post her new design.</br>  What's that word to describe the hair in Working again?  <br>NO</br>  <br>Fucking gross.</br>  Why is Kyouko-san so based?  <br>how do I make this work?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br> 720p </br></br></br></br></br>  Inami a cute.<br>A CUTE</br>  <br>If you have the base program and the character files it's not too difficult. You just need to find the menu option that loads the character file, but as you said it's all in moon.</br>  yamada best producer  <br>I don't have a 1920 pixel wide monitor.</br>  <br> and even they have their charms <br><br>understatement of the decade</br></br></br>  <br><br>Enjoy your shitty upscale.</br></br>  <br>Needs a sound version.</br>  <br> he doesn't know </br>  <br> He doesn't know </br>  <br/>   This week <br><br>I didn't realize but Satou isn't really helping in his relationship progress either</br></br>  I WANT TO FUCK YACHIYO  <br> CR 1080p <br>Does it really make a difference?</br></br>  <br>Working S3 is broadcast at 900p</br>  <br>see<br><br/></br></br>  <br><br>I am aware. This still doesn't answer my question.</br></br>  <br><br>Even though I'm not a huge Inamifag, if you look at just her personality, she's a lot better than, say, your average tsundere heroine. Her personality is actually sweet and pleasant and the violence is a Pavlovian response to a trigger. With most tsunderes, hitting is something they do intentionally, but not so here.</br></br>  <br>Yes, I've downloaded from DameDesuYo 1080p, HS 720p and 1080p and compared.<br><br>Download from DameDesuYo 1080p if you're behind on the series, his uploads are the same visual quality as HS 1080p but with a small filesize and better subs. He's 4 days behind though.</br></br></br>  So do you think Satou will properly confess before this season ends?  <br>Not really unless you inspect each frame with a magnifying glass.</br>  <br>well, that depends, if you are a blind person it wonn't make any difference, if you're not blind, then yes</br>  <br>yes<br><br><br>pleb detected</br></br></br></br>  <br>This season will wrap up both of the romances in the series.</br>  <br>Mikki, calm down.</br>  <br>Well, I'm blind so it's more than fine even as 720p.</br>  <br>They've already started rolling the Takanashi x Inami train which means they're going to probably finish it and wrap up every characters story.<br><br>Otoo-san finally seeing his wife will be neat.</br></br></br>  Any manga anons know if we're on pace to finish the series as a whole this season?  <br>Never, they're Christian.</br>  Man... Just as we escape the glacial hell that was Satou and Yachiyo's relationship we're crashing headlong into Takanashi and Inami absolute zero romance?<br><br>Give me more zany slice of life bullshit like in the first 2 episodes, goddammit!</br></br>  <br>But the romantic aspects are cute, too.</br>  <br>Should be, although Mamanashi better show up soon if they really want to spend time on the good parts.</br>  <br>Sure, as long as it doesn't clog the entire episode with "Do I like him/her? No... Maybe... No... Maybe..."</br>  <br>E. SHIT</br>  <br>The 720p version is downscaled to give objectively the best quality. The 1080p version is poorly upscaled by people with no encoding knowledge.<br><br>Only an absolute moron would use the 1080p file. You always want the version that's below what it was mastered at, because downscaling ironically loses less detail than the artifacting that poor upscaling introduces. Anyone with a brain is using MadVR, which upscales at far higher quality than Funi or HS, and in real time.</br></br></br>    <br>I hope this is bait</br>  <br>I want to be that wall.</br>  <br>eating all that parfait sure gave her a great ass</br>  <br>It'd be bait if he's talking about working but it's true for a lot of other shows.</br>  <br>Did you get lost on your way to the comic board?</br>  <br>but we're in a working thread</br>  <br>This fucking episode, I can't handle it.<br><br>I can feel Katanashi's feels, but he needs to give in and admit it and I can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>so it is bait</br>  <br>and a nice rack</br>    <br><br>The daughter of a yakuza clan's gotta eat to maintain her figure.</br></br>  When is Souma going to fuck Katana and NTR the blondie?

What a refreshing turn of events<br><br> Not like I really give a damn about Katanashi and Inami, though </br></br>  <br>Stop this meme.</br>  <br>see<br><br/></br></br>  Literally why is Takanashi such a huge dick.  <br>Because Kyouko overheard her saying that Satou was in love with Chief? I'm not sure either really, may just be a conditioned response or instincts or something.</br>  <br> yamada <br>I didn't even like this guy before but the handful of scenes he's had this season have changed my mind.</br></br>  <br>That doesn't make gifs less shit</br>    <br>Says the guy that can't turn off caps lock</br>  <br> But why? <br>Are you really this stupid?</br></br>  <br>Here's DDY<br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/136361/</wbr></br></br>  <br>how does this work<br><br> i need tiny inamis in my life someone please help </br></br></br>  <br>DDY vs HS?</br>  <br>DDY vs DDY</br>  <br>I meant can you do DDY vs HS in 1080p?</br>  <br>Do it yourself, I'm too lazy to do anymore.</br>  <br>She wouldn't kill her because of nothing, now would she?</br>  <br>Nice<br><br>Desktop Inami is nice</br></br></br>   mfw this episode   <br>Why didnt he just rationalize it like this<br> I like small things <br> She has a small bust <br><br><br>What was the bat for?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why was he thinking about aneki tits here?</br>  <br>He likes cute things because they are opposed to his home life.</br>  <br>But Poplar has big tits.</br>  <br>Izumi is cute.

Please?</br></br>  <br>He's trying to steal his woman</br>  <br>Holy shit, all that Inami bullying.</br>  <br> Tried that, it said JAVA 6 and then some moon.

They are just less efficient and inferior in every way.</br>  <br>Probably not. Everyone who isn't dead set on hating her no matter what has stopped it long time ago.</br>  <br>I'll start saving short webms when there are preview pics for them and I don't have to name every single one</br>  <br><br>I don't know, I don't care.<br><br>IMHO Inami is cute and that's all that matters, she's obviously going to win the Katanashi-kun and I'm glad, because it's meant to be.<br><br>As long as that smile is protected I couldn't care less what /a/ thinks.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is this show so much fun to watch?<br><br>I feel like the episodes last super long too considering there's so many scenes that happen in a single episode.</br></br>  Alright, how about this baka scale:<br><br>Yamada = Yamada &gt; Youhei &gt; Todoroki &gt; Kozue &gt; Kyoko &gt; Everyone else &gt; Souma (The smartest)</br></br>  <br> Kyoko <br> dumb </br></br>  <br> Neither the .jar nor the .exe seem to work for me. The path seems to be fucked up, since it throws in a "/./" between folders for some reason. </br>   This season <br>THINGS KEEP HAPPENING</br>  <br><br>I'm not saying she's dumb, just denser than everyone else, she seems like type of person who doesn't really stand out for her intellect but her physical strength.</br></br>  <br>maybe it's a mac thing. neither jar or exe are working</br>  <br>Fucking video files are somehow more appropriate than a small moving image that serves its purpose perfectly and is supported by everything.<br> b-but my picture quality <br>Kill yourself, you fucking autist. Nobody gives a shit. When people want quality they watch full BD video normally, not short clips from a fucking stream.</br></br></br>  i fucking love working and the devil is a part timer.<br>they make me not feel like a complete loser for working as a busboy at 22 to get through college</br>  <br>jar = java = cross-platform (+ memory leaks because shimeji)</br>  <br>Exe says it needs Java 6, so just I ran jar and it worked. Maybe you need to be in a Japanese locale.</br>  <br> the devil is a part timer. </br>  <br><br>I couldn't get it to work in Linux though.</br></br>  <br>I know jar works on macs as well, but it still doesn't load anything</br>  <br>i think the standard distribution only provides windows bindings. asdfman has a linux port and nonowarn has an OS X port (which is probably very out of date).</br>   all these people having problems with shimeji <br>I'm pretty sure all you need is to be running in Japanese locale and not using applocale. That solves like 99% of Japanese program related problems.</br>  <br>so how does one run in japanese locale</br>  <br>Control Panel -&gt; Region and Language -&gt; Administrative -&gt; Change system locale -&gt; Reboot<br><br>Unless you're also running some non-English non-Unicode programs nothing will change for you so you won't ever need to change it back.</br></br></br>  <br> I have tried Japanese AppLocale but it just tells me that the path is wrong. </br>  running the jar file worked for me  I'm probably gonna get a lot of flack for saying this, but whatever.<br><br>I feel like Satou's character is very similar to Jim from The Office.</br></br>  This smooth motherfucker just came up to you're waifu and asked for a table for a party of one in a non-smoking section. What do you do?  <br>so same thing with a mac, then. i'll give it a shot</br>   Nee-sans <br>All of them are busty<br> Izumi a best </br></br>  <br>There are people on /a/ who don't have their computer permanently set to Japanese locale? Seriously? Do you even eroge?</br>  <br>Get him his table because my waifu should except getting orders in a fucking restraunt.<br><br>Takanashi is a fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Take him behind the woodshed</br></br>  <br> as a busboy at 22 to get through college <br>Atleast your going to college.<br><br>I'm an apprentice and I am learning fuck all because the people I'm with dont give me hands on experience.

He and Pam were truely awful awful people.</br></br>  <br>I know right. <br>If it wasnt for the vn's it would be for 2hu. <br>Everyone on this site should be using Jap locale.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Satou is kind of an asshole too, bullying Poplar on a daily basis, that's just low (no pun intended)</br></br>  <br>considering the majority of the good ones don't work on macs, that's somewhat of an excuse</br>  I want to work in a family restaurant.  <br><br>I want to make a family with Popura-chan</br></br>  <br>You are a hypocrite or a fag. <br> Implying you wouldnt bully her <br> Implying she isnt cute when bullied </br></br></br>  Someone please help me out here. I'm currently around the start of S2 and I'm getting really fucking sick of "LOL INAMI HIT HIM AGAIN LMAO XDDDD" slapstick shit, but I'm still holding on because of Popura. Does it get better or should I just fucking give up now? Also, is there more Maya?  <br>I doubt it's any good. I remember watching Working'!! right before starting my first fast food job. Holy shit was that a let down. Made me want to kill myself.</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br><br>Well, I doubt Wagnaria counts as "fast food", I mean, that bitch with the Katana still hasn't served me my god damned coffee.</br></br>  <br>Bear with it bro, no one likes Inami. But you need to suffer through it for Poplar and the other girls. It's worth it.<br><br>Do it for her.</br></br></br>  <br>Give up and No Maya only speaks a total of 3 times.</br>  <br>says check for console issue. something tells me that has nothing to do with it</br>    So, two questions.<br><br>Seeing as how the manga is finished, is season three going to be able to completely adapt it?<br><br>Also, does Poplar ever start to have romantic feelings for Takanashi?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Pretty sure the whole point of the atmosphere in that scene was to provide a shock when Takanashi's interests are revealed.</br>  <br>Yes <br><br>No</br></br></br>  <br>Perfect.<br>Thank you.</br></br>  <br> sexualizing the poplar </br>  For those of you who wish a shit to be on their monitor, watch and do what they did and get the java file from the comments.  <br>Then try getting a job at a dennys, norms, or w/e restaurant like that.</br>  <br>Fuck forgot link.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kI7<wbr>ti4RhWnQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Poplar stays a one dimensional character till the end.</br>  <br>and for the poor mac people?</br>  <br> no one likes Inami <br> NO ONE <br>Implying i don't like Inami</br></br></br>  <br>Pic related.</br>  <br>Stop being a homosexual.</br>  <br>I always liked Inami. She has a reason for why she punches guys. Meanwhile /a/ loves Yamada who just has no reason to be a useless bitch all the time.</br>  <br>Yamada is relatable.</br>  <br>Also Inami tries to get over her issues and has success in this, while Yamada is completely fine with being useless and self-centered. Both of them would be a pain to deal with, but Inami is definitely more likable as a person.</br>  <br><br>Inami is the main reason I watch this show.<br><br>Perhaps she is not the best girl, but deserves to win.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In all honesty you should be able to run java and the exe.</br>  <br> but deserves to win <br>You say that like she has some kind of competition.</br></br>  <br>Great taste, comarade.</br>  <br>You need administrative privileges.</br>  <br>There's only one reason I like Yamada<br><br>She's cute as fuck. I want to spoil her until the day I die.</br></br></br>  <br>You get a PC</br>  <br>That shit was too good.<br><br><br>I think the issue is that he's starting to find Inami cute, which flies in the face of what his definition of cute is supposed to be. An Inami that doesn't regularly punch his lights out is threatening to his entire dogma.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Symbian master race</br>  <br>She is the second cutest girl in the show (Izumi for life), but the main reason why she's my favorite is because she's the funniest in the main cast.</br>  <br>Yep, you're a retard</br>  <br>Quality post, m8. Keep at it.</br>  <br>She is small so even now if she has big tits they're small</br>  <br>Working!! has no love triangle. It's like saying you won at playing a single player game. You finish them, not win.</br>  <br>It's going to kill me everyday knowing she can't.  ;-; </br>  <br>Na, she's grow a bit more  hair-wise. </br>  <br>I dropped this shit, orange short hair girl can go catch herpes</br>  <br> being a retard <br> get called a retard on the internet <br> getting mad </br></br></br>  Isn't Yamada male suppose to be a good fighter? How did he get his ass beat by Takanashi? Ah well, the author is clearly not above using physical abuse for comedy, ServantXService has a few moments like that as well.  <br><br>Wagnaria is a [probably franchise chain] family restaurant.</br></br>  <br>GR8 B8 M8 R8 8/8</br>  <br><br>The Yamadas are kindhearted. He'd never beat one of his sister's friends.</br></br>  <br> u mad card <br><br>Keep memeing.</br></br></br>  <br>Karate doesn't teach you in-fighting. Also, Takanashi is powered by this need to protect his dog.</br>  <br>The joke is that Takanashi has gained great fighting prowess as a result of his Onee-chan using him as a punching bag.</br>    <br>But Yamada male can actually block Inami's punches while Takanashi can't.</br>  <br> THIS GUY IA GETTING ME SO MAD <br> WHAT SHOULD I SAY TO MAKE HIM SHUT UP <br> k-keep meeting <br> yeah, that'll put him in his place </br></br></br></br>  <br>It is. It's very obviously based off of a popular family restaurant chain that serves Italian food. You also see references to it in other work since it's popular for young mangakas to hang out there to work.</br>  <br>Takanashi could it's just his abilities are more counter-attack oriented so he would hurt her and Kazue who taught him told him never to use force against a girl or she will kill him.</br>  <br>Takanashi gets -10 defense against attacks by female love interests for being the male lead but +10 attack against male comic relief side characters.</br>  <br>He can, he just doesnt do it</br>  <br> meming <br>Back to reddit with you</br></br>  Holy shit these last two episodes have been brilliant  <br><br>There are people on /a/ who are stupid enough to not understand how search engines work.<br><br>That's the bigger problem. I mean how hard is is to understand the difference between a box you use in order to post something and one you use in order to find stuff on the internet?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Are Japanese family restaurants actually a good place to get work done? I doubt I would be able to focus on getting work done. I seen high school kids in other series fucking study there. Is there a noise policy or some shit in Japanese restaurants?</br>  <br>It's not that he can't, it's that he doesn't.</br>  <br>So he really was a masochist the whole time. Good lord their first time in bed is gonna be strange.</br>  <br>Dunno about family restaurants, but I saw a shit ton of people studying in McDonalds while in Japan.</br>  <br>There was a whole episode about this.</br>  <br>I don't think there's a policy, but the Japanese are all about not disturbing other people. You get a mostly quiet place to work, plus cheap drinks.</br>  great fucking episode  <br>He may be a masochist, but him not defending himself against Inami has nothing to do with that. it's just that the defensive techniques he knows are apparently kinda painful, and Kozue has promised that she will beat him up if he uses them on a girl. This was explicitly stated by Takanashi in S2, I believe.</br>    <br>Depends on the place. Japanese places focus more on custome service. Also I once saw a Gordon Ramsey vid with sushi chefs and they made the new guys wash rice all day, every day for 2 years before letting him move on. <br><br>I assume they are shitty places, like western ones.</br></br></br>    yamada male &gt; yamada female<br><br>its not like they'll ever meet anyways</br></br>  <br>Pretty lazy animation considering previous stuff.<br><br>I thought I had the webm of Yamada going down the ladder, but nope.</br></br></br>  <br>That's the case for most high-scale sushi restaurants. Anons should watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi if they're interests.</br>  <br>Pretty sure that was for effect, not lack of animation chops.</br>  <br>Actually, Working!!! Is animated at 1080p native. The CR video is created from a 1440x1080 anamorphic master meaning it is the highest quality video we'll get until blurays. As it is, the encoders at DDY and FFF can make it virtually no different from the 1080p. Rember that all TV is done based on an anamorphic source. Horizontal upscaling has negligible effects compared to vertical upscaling.</br>    Every girl is best girl, even Matsumoto.  Here I come Otoo-san, do you have enough plates in stock?      <br>Best scene in the whole ep.</br>    <br>Perfect. All of them</br>  <br>Absolutely  _adorable_ </br>  Damn this show got really rabu rabu recently. <br>Makes it feel like the final season</br>  Get in here<br>http://strawpoll.me/5028792</br>  <br>A-Anon.</br>  <br> no choice for all </br>  <br>Wide poplar best grill.</br>  <br>You forgot Mitsuki.<br><br>That said...I can't choose!</br></br></br>  <br> Makes it feel like the final season </br>  <br> Trying to make a webm of it with subtitles. <br> Fuck it up and this comes out of it. </br></br>  <br>GOOD</br>  <br>Pffft.</br>  <br>I think you'd have to hardsub it first.</br>  <br>Oh fuck.  My bad, anon. She slipped my mind. </br>  <br>At first I thought she was going to hit him for real and laugh but he really ended up hurting her feelings. Didn't see that coming.</br>  Holy fuck that episode made me hard, especially the last scene with inami.  <br> Inami among the top <br>Well, that's unexpected.  Although she was cute this episode. </br></br>  <br>Yamada is good but Takanashi is better<br><br>He could actually stop Inami's punch and counter attack if he wanted to, but a life of being dominated by onee-sans has left him unable to hit girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Where's the all girls are best girl option?</br>  <br>I want to vote for the three sisters but I can't</br>  <br>Inami stronk</br>  <br>I got to work at a small family restaurant as a dishwasher in high school. It was pretty good as high school level jobs go.</br>  <br>Proxyfag please stop voting for Inami</br>  <br><br>Fixed it.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your shitty reaction images.</br>  <br> implying 32% of anons don't have excellent taste </br>  <br>Saved.  That light punch destroyed my heart. </br>  I can't get enough of Kana Asumi's voice  <br>Hardest punch Inami has given him yet.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Inami stronk</br>    <br>This</br>  What would Yachiyo's favorite Death Grips album be?  How does the mango end?    <br>At the end, Kyoko reminds everyone that, when she hired them, she said no romance. She fires everyone and gets new staff. Since they're all broke, the romance dies and they wind up all bitter and poor and alone. The end.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=-Km<wbr>-yfase3k</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>They will.</br>  <br> still no wife </br>  <br>Wow. I'm glad the show didn't follow the manga art too closely.</br>  <br>Makes me miss both this and Servant x Service</br>  <br>The manga art is garbage.</br>  <br> Satou being friendly with Souma <br>Aww, it's nice to see a Kamiya character actually have a friend once in a while.<br><br><br>Some day, anon. Some day...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people said this doesn't work: the folder has filenames in shift-js, so when unpacking, use something that creates shift-js filenames, not mojibake. it might work that way.</br>  <br>copy-paste from &gt;https://archive.moe/a/thread/12491<wbr>6247/#124994919<br><br> &gt;The ending is great. Here's an in-depth spoiler of the final sequence if you want, hope I don't fuck up the tags. <br><br> Takanashi's mother shows up <br> She finds out about Inami <br> Gets annoyed with how wishy-washy Souta is about Inami, since his father was similar towards her <br> Tries to get him to confess to her <br> This somehow ends up with her ordering Inami to beat all the sisters one by one <br> She does so, final showdown with mom at Takanashi's house <br> Mom is still not convinced this will be a good relationship but Nazuna pulls a Souma and manipulates her with a picture of her when she was young <br> How Nazuna got the picture is a whole other hilarious story <br> Mom seems to be defeated, but she still doesn't like it <br> Poplar shows up cause she was worried <br> Mom takes one look at Poplar, says "Souta was working alongside this small thing this whole time... but he ended up with Inami anyway? SOLD" <br> The end <br> I think the mom kidnaps Poplar <br><br> &gt;As for just ships, here's the ones I remember <br> Satou and chief <br> Inami and Takanashi <br> Kazue gets back with her ex <br> Kozue appears to be involved with BOTH Mashiba twins <br> Izumi ends up withnobody ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br>  <br> Posting this without a spoiler </br>  <br>Let's not forget that Manager &amp; his Lost Waifu finally reunite through the power of Yamada.</br>  <br>i downloaded a different shimeji and replaced the image files. isn't perfect but oh well</br>  <br>I need to webm some of that op</br>  <br> Kozue appears to be involved with BOTH Mashiba twins <br>SLUT</br></br>  <br> &gt;Izumi ends up withnobody ;_; <br><br>Wrong.

Doujins where?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's surprisingly helpful</br>  <br>SCANLATION FUCKING WHEN?</br>  <br>I see you Yamada</br>    <br>This will be last season of Working!! Going forward it will be Yamada!!</br>  <br>I see Daisy</br>  <br>Can't wait for it to be all Yamadas in a few weeks</br>  <br>She increased her numbers in the last few episodes.</br>  <br> There's a Yamada too. </br>  <br> I just found her </br>  <br>Ahhh!</br>  <br>Just ask  Japanzai </br>  <br>I haven't checked in a year or so, are they still working on Aiki S? They have to have gotten at least a chapter or two out since the last time I checked.</br>  I honestly think we can confirm Working!!! as the AOTS, if not AOTY  <br>Too busy sucking boichi's dick</br>    <br>And with this, this manga has reached its lowest point. Haisebitch and Qshit are killing the manga.<br>What a shame.</br></br>  <br>i agree with you, anon</br>  <br>you are right, sadly</br>  <br>I have more faith in the Autisma's OVA, I mean look at this quality. Pierrot changed staff, so maybe it could be decent.</br>  <br>It looks like Kyoani tier animation.</br>  OK let me get this straight, anons<br>ITT we're supposed to bitch about everything until spoiler pics are dumped.<br>And then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter even when almost no one ITT knows moonrunes and we only have -10 pages from the actual chapter.<br>Then we bitch about IS being slow.<br>Then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter, and even when something that may be interesting in the future starts developing we'll simply ignore it and keep bitching about anything we can.<br>Oh and we bitch about tumblr too<br>Am I getting things right, anons?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes, this is basically what TG threads are for until ishida delivers</br>  <br>yeah, they complain about anything. It's called being a tg speed reader.</br>  <br>This. I want impatient shonenfags to leave.</br>  If the chapter is shit and nothing fucking happens, we will call it as it is.<br><br>I swear you guys are the worst. Do you guys think we like to complain? At some point, we all loved this manga.</br></br>  <br>We also fuck each other in the ass.  /a/ TG fanbase is absolute shit. </br>  <br>If you loved this manga you'd know how the manga was in the beginning. But you don't seem to.</br>  <br> /a/ TG fanbase is absolute shit. <br>I agree, tumblr is actually better, they always have discussions going about symbolisms and shit. So does reddit. Here? Waaaaaah nothing happened.</br></br>  <br>TG was exactly the same you faggot.</br>  <br><br><br> even when something that may be interesting in the future starts developing we'll simply ignore it <br>When some shit actually happens we talk/joke about it, you fucking niggas. <br>Stop being Ishida's defenders and read the past threads.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm fine with tokyo ghoul, its not super fast paced until shit goes down. I like the buildup, characterization, etc. I like Haise and the Q's, some some terrible shit is probably going to happen to them and its already building up. Also last chapter we got to see the ccg guy who tortured Yamori   will probably torture Haise because parallels  . I know people don't like it, for some people they have concerns that sound legitimate, but lets be honest the anime attracted lots of viewers who either sped through the chapters, skipped all of them until kaneki torture, or decided to pick up the manga at re:</br>  Ishida drawing Ihe Hairu, listening this song from osterreich:<br><br>https://soundcloud.com/onlyifyoucal<wbr>lme/5yzf8sel7xvu</wbr></br></br>  <br><br> TG was exactly the same you faggot <br>I want disgusting newfags to leave.<br>Here is a example of our talks when Re started. But as the manga kept focusing in Qshit our talks kept being shittier.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The sad part is reddit and tumblr have actual discussion unlike Tokyo Ghoul threads on achan. All I see people do is complain about nothing happening for every chapter.<br><br>Hopefully that changes.</br></br></br>  <br> the anime attracted lots of viewers who either sped through the chapters, skipped all of them until kaneki torture, or decided to pick up the manga at re: <br>The threads became shitty after trap's revelation of being a trap. I know because that day I was here.</br></br>  <br> those hands <br><br>yup that's ishidas art</br></br></br>  <br>There are still discussion to be had anon. I mean last chapter we had Yamori's torturer introduced, but naw instead people shitpost. It's not being a newfag or anything.</br>  <br><br>It's much better than that Tsukiyama pic</br></br>  <br><br> The sad part is reddit and tumblr have actual discussion <br>Of course m8.</br></br></br>  <br>I like it more than I ever have. Then again, I didn't start reading until TG finished.</br>  <br>ahh yeah I remember that. Remember when the old discussion that used to be had on /a/? I think people are mostly upset because they miss kaneki   and want to do sexual things with him  .</br>  <br> I mean last chapter we had Yamori's torturer introduced, but naw instead people shitpost. <br>We already talked about this. Ishida is creating false hyped but then everything return to be shitty SoL.<br> Chapter 30, it seemed that Kaneki was going to return. Lol, nope, Haisebitch is still in charge. <br> In said chapter it looked as if both of them were going to merge. Lol, nope, Haisebitch is still in charge. <br> Christmas chapter: look it's the Last Supper symbolism. Lol, more SoL in the next chapters. <br> Fungus symbolism. More SoL. <br> Haisebitch is going to talk with Uta. Lol those are tattoos and nothing more. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they miss kaneki <br>Because Haise is that shitty. I want a good MC.</br></br>  <br>Thats not what i meant.<br>The fucking boring SoL chapters were the same in TG.<br>And the TG Threads were full of gay shit .</br></br></br>  <br>With all this false hope I feel like he's building shit up for something. It's like he's doing this shit on purpose. He knows people want Kaneki, but then why is he holding him back?</br>  <br> The fucking boring SoL chapters were the same in TG <br>The only arc that bored me at this level was Hinami's mother's arc, but that was in the early 10-17 chapters, in :re we are in the 30-40 chapters and still that boring feeling is present.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128550737 <br> Since when were you under the impression that you weren't just projecting your newfaggotry? <br>Since I know you, nigga. At least use another pics.</br></br>  What do you think is in the rest of the envelopes that little mouse delivered to homo prince through the faggot butler?  <br>Fujobait, that's what is inside.</br>  <br>Ishida always delivered, so stop your bitching and wait.</br>  <br>My kind of envelops</br>  Tbh I think this whole Haise thing is just to make an even more insane Kaneki. Think about it<br>  Conflict choosing between his ghoul bonds and his ccg bonds <br>  New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br>  Potential to hurt someone he cares about from previous life due to his amnesia <br>  Torture parallel with Tokage <br>  The amnesia sets Kaneki backwards, causing him to struggle, he was starting to figure out about the clowns and stuff until he got mind wiped </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's probably using the smug Uta pics now. There was only one thread I've been as far as I remember early around 1X where there was only 2 shitposts by the end of the ride so I'm not around here often minus for spoiler pics. Let's face it, these threads wouldn't get past 500 posts anymore and they'll be empty before the start of Monday</br>  <br> Ishida always delivered <br>I'm waiting since Re started, nigga.</br></br>  <br>  Conflict choosing between his ghoul bonds and his ccg bonds <br>  New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br>  Potential to hurt someone he cares about from previous life due to his amnesia <br>It's already here, he's researching Kaneki, shironeki is his unconsciousness reminding him how ignorant he really is and after meeting Nishiki is he considering to tread his path carefully by capturing Hinami instead of telling her to fuck off.<br>What's more interesting is what Autismo thinks of Haise now that one of his squad members is cooperating with his team while keeping a eye on him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I really don't want white haired Kaneki back since he's too edgy. However I want combination of Kaneki and Haise together.</br>  <br>yeah but he can just look at a females hand</br>  <br>Friendly reminder that Shironeki has not killed a single human.</br>  <br>there is no point to another merger, literally at the end of TG black haired Kaneki and white haired Kaneki merged. what the fuck would be the point in merging now just give Kaneki back his body and piss off.</br>  <br><br>Have faith in Ishida. We all know it's coming</br></br>  So you know how kaneki gets a new split personallity when he eats someone ( well not just anyone it seems the victim needs to have left an impact on Kaneki). Haise is probably based off of Hide. Do you think any new personalities will be added into the pot? I mean if kaneki ate shu and started saying "fortissimo" it'd be pretty sick.<br><br>Shironeki was so badass, he just needed to make better choices.<br><br>If Batamon hadn't gotten picked up for experiments he would have. I guess Hide hadn't been confirmed yet, so too early to call it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Honestly I really don't want <br>Honestly I don't care about your opinion.</br></br>  Haise wont suffer r-right?  What are we all expecting will happen in this issue?  <br><br>He already has, anon</br></br>  <br>Q masks.</br>  <br>And Haise's hair is even darkly colored at the roots like Hide's</br>  <br><br>Tsukiyama bursts into :re</br></br>  <br>I could see that going horribly wrong with the other investigators, it's going to cause a rift between the Q's and the rest of ccg. I mean masks are the symbols of ghouls.</br>  <br>Nothing.  Maybe starting operation for masked Qs by the end of the chapter. </br>  People complain about the pacing but compared to One Piece the pacing is faster and the payoff is just as good.  <br>They need to infiltrate or whatever. The only rift I see happening is if Haise puts on his old mask.</br>  <br> I'm waiting since Re started, nigga. <br>kek do you even read the Manga?<br>There are many things he alredy delivered.<br><br>Again think back to TG , what had he delivered until CH40 ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Homo prince.<br><br>And look what he's back to now.</br></br></br>  <br>Character development and the internal struggle about survival.</br>  <br>To be fair, it's sometimes fast and slow. SoL feel like they go on forever and that last part of the auction felt rushed as fuck.</br>  <br>there have been some good parts, but ishida is simply inflicting kaneki's suffering onto us as we watch beta haise stumble around like a retard</br>  <br>Dang I like his new battle suit</br>  Spoilers in 5 minutes, guys.  We won't see sasaki/ kaneki become autistic until we gouge our own eyes out  <br>Is there a place that has pictures for all the playing cards?</br>  <br>10 minutes</br>  <br><br>The wiki</br></br>  <br>A tumblr theories blog have them all and he/she id making a decent analysis there, but tenner they are Faggiyama lovers there</br>  Wake me up when spoilers are here.  where are my spoilers?

Stop this, this is like the 3rd time already.</br></br>  <br><br>So I guess you guys never read Penisman</br></br>  I quit reading the manga about 10 chapters into part 2 when it got so bad I just couldn't keep my interest up.<br><br>So is it worth picking up again in which case I can probably rush through the boring chapters at once now?</br></br>  <br>Just fuck off already.</br>  <br>No.<br>Now, fuck off.</br></br>  <br> rush through the boring chapters at once now? <br>Fuck off and never read the manga again.</br></br>  <br>Penisman is the pinnacle of all manga.

Good to know.</br>  <br> Keep sucking his dick <br>Jesus christ, it's sad that I can't even count how many times I've read some faggot say then a Tokyo ghoul thread. /a/ is full of some of the worst uptight faggotry.</br></br>  <br>Wait until the manga is over, then you can skip all chapters and shitpost about how bad it was.</br>  Oh so it's bitching time again, huh?<br>Ok<br>W-well I fucking hate  , Saiko looks too short<br>Damn Ishida, you're a hack<br>The manga is ruined now<br><br> How am I doing, anons? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> /a/ is full of some of the worst uptight faggotry <br>And what are you doing here if you don't like being here? Fuck off jesus.</br></br>  <br>you're gay</br>  We're literally Attack on Titan manga threads now. The only thing missing are the shipperfags posting their homo pairings and an Uta bot.  <br> Oh so it's bitching time again <br>It's not that, it's just that he's really asking for it.</br></br>  <br> what are you doing here <br>Enjoying conservations about manga and anime I like that don't devolve into raging shitposters sperging, and butthurt waifufags. not every thread is as bad as Tokyo ghoul threads.</br></br>  <br>don't give them ideas</br>  <br>1/10<br><br>You need to complain about something like Urie's edge, Qs being shit or gayama being gay.</br></br></br>  <br> 4u </br>  <br> I like that don't devolve into raging shitposters sperging, and butthurt waifufags <br><br>Well, that's what /a/ is for you and always was, you newshit. <br><br>If you came here only for discussions about anime and shit, then there are other sites for that too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fuck! it's a fagyama arc! <br> Eto is a queen <br> Shitty haise is such a bitch bring back Kaneki <br> stop sucking Ishida's dick <br> Stop talkng about ishida <br> Just wait until Uta becomes take and kills Arima. <br> Touka a shit. <br>There you go. That's a common tokyo ghoul thread minus that shitposter that pops in to call tokyo Ghoul edgy shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So what happened to whitehairfags?  <br>And Eto is not the queen?</br>    Emil looking CCG Investigator cuts a guy's tongue off <br>  instead we shitpost, calling Ishida a hack <br><br>What's next guys? Ishida draws a guy getting his balls cut and we call him a Hack.</br></br></br>    <br>How about you stop praising him and talk about him.</br>    hack <br><br>Do some illiterate niggers not know how to use this word correctly?</br></br>  <br>Let's just start ignoring the shitposting and actually discuss what we've seen.</br>  <br>But he's literally shit, faggot</br>  <br>Ishida is a tattoo artist.</br>  <br>How so.</br>  <br> Ishida draws a guy getting his balls cut <br>We already had something similar with nutcracker cracking balls. What i want to see next is Uta eating some more dick.</br></br>  <br>I don't give a shit</br>  <br> :^) </br>  <br>Bet your faggot ass wouldn't be saying this if he brings back Kaneki. <br><br>Honestly I wish this series had ended when Kaneki got raped by Arima so I wouldn't have to deal with all this faggotry.</br></br></br>  <br>They hate the series now because it's getting too "gay" for them, but they can't stop reading it because they actually love it. But now they're mad because they've got all this repressed gay inside of themselves and don't know what to do with it. The manga's fine.</br>  <br> literally shit <br>Yeah, illiterate.</br></br>  <br>Hey, guess that's literally in the dictionary.<br> in effect; in substance; very nearly; virtually: <br>"I literally died when she walked out on stage in that costume."</br></br></br>  <br>Do they not remember that the prequel had gayness as well? Do they not know that Ishida was the creator of Penisman which was gay? It's like they forgot the series itself had gay elements. I guess sucking on Kaneki's centipede made them forget.</br>  <br>I'd assume the other Qs, but it doesn't add up to 6.</br>  <br> Getting to gay <br>Tokyo Ghoul was just as gay with Kaneki calling Tsukiyama and arima beautiful.</br></br>  <br>There a lot of shit like timeskips up and there, after the auction, even worse than the fucking prequel. It's just few of the examples.<br><br><br>I don't give a shit about kaneki and arima<br><br><br>I see you don't even know the definition.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't give a shit about kaneki <br><br>Then why the fuck are you reading the Manga?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't reply to that bait. That was just to retarded of a statement to not be bait.</br>  <br>That was the peak of the manga. :re is a disgrace to Ishida's name.</br>  <br> Then why the fuck are you reading the Manga? <br>Are you fucking kidding me? WHAT THE FUCK? There a lot of reason to read this manga besides fucking kaneki. I hope you all die fucking retards.<br><br><br>Your favorite mangaka is not fucking perfect get over it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK <br><br>This would be so much funnier if he crashed into the CCG like that. Even better if Arima stands right before him.</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you so mad?</br>  <br>He wants Batman to come.</br>  Isn't Suey a girl's name? Is Ishida a girl?  <br> Your favorite mangaka is not fucking perfect get over it. <br>He isn't my favorite mangaka. I just like his manga. Is this what you faggots think? Who gives a fuck if other people like Ishida? Don't let your autism make you think you have to be a contrarian to look cool.</br></br>  <br>His Editor or assistant confirmed his gender at one point.</br>  <br> ITT we're supposed to bitch about everything until spoiler pics are dumped. <br>We are not. If OP wasn't a desperate faggot, anons would make threads when we only get some spoilers<br> no one ITT knows moonrunes and we only have -10 pages from the actual chapter. <br>Actually, there is a fag who brings us translations from  Tumblr  and we deal with it since Imperial is very shit at doing its work.<br> Then we bitch about IS being slow. <br> we <br>That's just one fucker. At this point I think it's shitposter-kun, he likes whining and spouting nonsensical shit while he bumps the thread. <br>There is no need to be mentally retarded like the shitposter after all; we are just waiting for THScans to deliver new chapters <br> Then we bitch about how nothing happened in the chapter <br>We are like this since the Christmas shit chapter. Also, this is a Tsukiyama arc, we're still in CCG PoV and Ishida is making other CCG investigators (Hirako, Kijima and his slut, Takeomi) more interesting than Haise and his squad, what did you expect? <br>Clowns themselves doing serious shit in Auction is by far the best thing since TG:re serialization started.<br> we bitch about tumblr too <br>If you weren't such a newfriend, you must have known /a/ hates tumblrites. You can go and see any threads on /a/ (except Nurutu, SnK and Magi threads) /a/ likes shitting on Tumblr, Reddit and MAL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, now you asking why I'm mad. Because there are faggots that read this manga only for the MC which is stupid.<br><br><br>You know what. Fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> all of the Qs in Uta's shop <br> nobody notices Uta is a ghoul <br> not even Urine <br>Uta just doesn't give a fuck.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uta just doesn't give a fuck. <br><br>He's just that good anon. He makes everyone his bitch.</br></br></br>  <br>They should all be fired.<br>Haise=dumb<br>Quinx=dumb</br></br></br>  I love Arima.  <br>Yep, we Bleach now. Learn to love it.</br>  When is Autisma's OVA airing?  <br>October, I think.</br>  <br>It's okay dude just chill we all got that one series we enjoy but hate the MC</br>  <br>How would they know? I hope you're not talking about his eyes.</br>  <br>Fuck off Hairu.</br>  <br>Because he doesn't turn his kakugan off. Seriously, Urie sense of smell is that good and he can't even regconize the ghoul smell?!</br>  <br> Hairu </br>  <br><br>I like your positivity.<br><br>Here's some positive questions for you guys <br><br> Who's your favorite character and why? <br> When did you start liking them? <br> Ghouls or humans? <br> Favorite arc? <br> If you were a ghoul what kagune would you want and why? <br> Would you risk the consequences to get a kakuja? <br> Who's your waifu/husbando and what's their appeal to you? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Never knew FAS was so attractive</br>  What happen in this chapter<br> Tsukiyama sees Haise and tries to see him on wheelchair. He trips obviously. <br> Kanae prepares him to see Haise at the CCG but then Tsukiyama falls. Haise and Saiko help him up ln his feet. The ghoul household leaves to advoid further dangerous investigators. <br> Haise takes his team to Uta's shop. Saiko seems to be interested in Uta. Haise has a new mask. <br> Kijima tortures Yuma and decides to send a tongue to Roze ghouls. <br> Chapter ends with Uta saying to Yomo: I became friend with Sasaki-kun. <br><br><br>Who cares, stop diluting this thread and discuss the chapter. You are acting like a swab meeting which is disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is something fun. I'll bite.<br><br> Kaneki Ken, he was and still is the most interesting characters in the series so far.  <br> Around the point when he asked touka to teach him how to fight. <br> Ghouls <br> Aunteiku raid <br> Ukaku, aesthetically pleasing to have wing like kagune and strong long range with the ability to fight up close is nice. <br> Yes <br> Hinami, she's cute. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Who's your favorite character and why? <br>Banjou because he's Banjou<br> When did you start liking them? <br>When he became Banjou<br> Ghouls or humans? <br>Banjou<br> Favorite arc? <br>Banjou arc<br> If you were a ghoul what kagune would you want and why? <br>Banjou's kagune because it's the best kagune<br> Would you risk the consequences to get a kakuja? <br>Only if it's a Banjou kakuja<br> Who's your waifu/husbando and what's their appeal to you? <br>Banjou</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you look at all the Tokyo ghoul color pages/volume all the ghouls kakugans are red iris with white sclera while Uta's is red iris with black sclera. All Uta would have to do is turn them off and his eyes will still be black. Like he said he's tattoos his eyes.</br>  According to Makyun, there's a flashback from Ui with Haise and Arima in combat.  <br>Banjou in re when?</br>  <br>Could Banjou's Kagune heal others or just himself?</br>  <br> there's a flashback from Ui with Haise and Arima in combat <br><br>Arima being best dad.</br></br></br>  <br>Shut up.</br>    <br>Translation? This is getting pretty interesting.</br>  <br>Haise basically says "Umm, Are You Ok?" and Saiko say "crazy suit"</br>  <br>Ah, was hoping the speech bubble belonged to Tsukiyama.</br>  <br>I think it's safe to say the under weight man who just tried to run from his wheelchair and fell onto the floor isn't okay Haise you dense fuck</br>  Tsukiyama looks like Torso now.<br><br>Ui doesn't like Haise and thinks he's dangerous? That's new.</br></br>  <br>It seems as if Haise and Arima are fighting eachother, I'm hoping, or they're just fighting together in the flashback.</br>  <br>I'll take that L but Ishida is being inconsistent and confusing then. Majorities of of the color pages the kakugans it red/white but the the pic you show me and I think a other one with one of the ghoul twins is red/black, which the fuck is it then.</br>  <br><br>No, there are six envelopes there. The numbers for 2 and 6 are obscured though.</br></br>  <br>I said that, 4 Qs and Sasaki makes 5, not 6.</br>  <br>That's what anon said, he said that he thought it was the Qs until he realised that Haise + Qs doesn't add up to 6.</br>  <br>Didn't the first go to Shu anyway? So it would be Shu, Qs, Haise to make 6 right.</br>  <br>i highly disagree anon</br>  does faglord-san remember who he is by now or will I have to wait for more chapters?  <br>He still doesn't remember.</br>  <br>Don't blame him, he's making a fortune with his manga. He's always happy with his fujobucks<br><br><br>Saicow is 143cm. She's a small pig<br><br><br> Uta bot <br>That is shitposter-kunt, he uses Clowns images to shitpost. It's sad, there are some anons who liked Uta and his gang but that shiteater had to ruin everything<br><br><br> if he brings back Kaneki <br>Who cares? I mean, people seem to want to know more about secondary characters than MC-kun's "family" Anyway I agree with you, I'd have wished TG to finish when Kaneki was killed by Gary Stu-san, since there were many hints about Amon being alive and Suzuya wasn't an insufferable character anymore; I could see them being MCs in Ghoul and CCG sides<br><br><br><br>Wow, I know Haise, Sharkteeth, Saiko and Trap are dumbasses as fuck but I thought Urine wasn't too idiot. He probably got hit so hard when he was benching. Poor Urine<br><br><br>Nice blog dipshit.

I hope the old Ishida returns and fix this.</br></br>  <br> According to Makyun <br>Since when does that bitch is allowed here?</br></br>  <br>It's goddamn common courtesy.</br>  <br> but I thought Urine wasn't too idiot <br>I'm too close to just put on hold this manga. I can't stand Haise nor the Qshit. They're too disgusting for me.</br></br>  <br>Honestly Haise wouldn't be nearly as atrocious if it wasn't for the fact he manages to be even more of a jobber than Kaneki. He has the potential to be a proper ass-kicker, but lets just waste that to reinforce his shitty parent persona.</br>  <br><br>Because he wants to tell a story, something most of mongoloids here are incapable of understanding.</br></br>  <br>This.</br>  <br> &gt; New split personality, as if he didn't already have enough of those <br> split personality <br> split personality <br> split personality <br> split personality <br> split personality <br>You pain me anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br> white hair kaneki because black hair a Bitch  <br> when he stopped being a whiny Bitch <br> neither  <br> I want eto kagune  <br> yep <br> rize because she best girl </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Will you ever kill yourself?</br>    <br>I don't understand why you keep on replying without even typing anything.

Blerg.  <br><br>Actually all the ghouls are a plot device literally the plot only moves foward when the ghouls do something</br></br>  <br>All this recent shitting on Tsukiyama</br>  <br><br>Nope there is a difference between being a plot device and being part of a plot point.</br></br>  <br>A plot device is what moves the story forward<br>which means Kaneki, Aogiri, CCG ect are plot decives because they move the story foward<br><br>Plot point is something happens which makes the plot move forward Kaneki accepting his ghoul side so the plot progress which meant the plot device moved the story forward <br><br>I see no difference</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you can't see the difference between a "character" who only exists as a plot device, moving the main story forth by his existence alone and a actual character doing random stuff, then I can't help you.</br>  <br> ahhh nobody can shit on my fav character <br>It's totally gay.</br></br>  <br> &gt;ahhh nobody can shit on my fav character <br>Tsukiyama doesn't need to be my favourite character to defend him from the cancer fags that the anime attracted.</br></br>  <br> doing random stuff <br>Doing random stuff also moves the story forward. When a character moves the plot forward in any direction they're a plot device.</br></br>  <br>there is a main storyline and side storys. Just try to comprehend that.</br>  <br> there is a main storyline and side storys. Just try to comprehend that. <br>I'm fully capable of comprehending that, but even if it's not a major part of the plot, if it's moved forward by character they're a plot device.</br></br>  So how long will this fight last I doubt Tsukiyama is going to survive after this arc  <br>I doubt Ishida will just kill off the first character he ever developed.</br>  <br>I hate him and his faggotry. You need to see some doctors for this insecurity over a fictional character.</br>  <br>nope you're taking the word plot device literally by completly ignoring that it expresses the value of a character or rather the necessity. Rize only shows up when the story needs to move. When there needs to be a change a "happening". Guess who doesn't.</br>  <br> developed <br> first character </br></br>  <br> who is kaneki? </br>  <br>Jesus Christ anon just drop it, this is making you seem desperate and obsessed.<br>Not that anon.</br></br>  <br> that filename </br>  <br> I doubt Ishida will just kill off the first character he ever developed. <br>Kek you wish anon<br><br> Rize only shows up when the story needs to move. When there needs to be a change a "happening". Guess who doesn't. <br><br>so if Rize the reason for the story to move then how is this plot moving right now both orginal and re are linked to one story<br>Rize not even reintroduced</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I hate him and his faggotry. <br>Faggotry? When was that ever the case? Just because there are a lot of fujoshis who interpret his character in a way they personally see fit I won't start hating him for such a nonsensical reason.<br> You need to see some doctors for this insecurity over a fictional character. <br>I don't quite see your point here. How can someone be insecure over a fictional character? Please elaborate.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;I doubt Ishida will just kill off the first character he ever developed. <br> Kek you wish anon <br>He confirmed that Tsukiyama was the first character he developed and was originally intended to be the protagonist of different manga.</br></br></br>  <br> desperate <br>I only made one post hating on Gayama in this thread and that guy immediately called me out for shitting on his "muhhh Tsukiyama". Who is the desperate one here?</br></br>  <br>so anon are you saying that plot device character's not better then a character that not a plot device</br>  Chink scans when?  <br> first to be ever be developed <br>It's Nishiki. He had he arc way before Hinami and Tsukiyama. And now you need to stop being delusional.</br></br>  <br>No, you have made several posts in this thread whining about a single character's presence in the story just because you interpret him in a way that makes you hate him.<br>If you weren't somewhat obsessed with this, you wouldn't respond to the other anon with childish insults.</br></br>  <br> how <br>You need to stop being so butthurt over a simple post of "gay chapter" and tryibg so hard to make everyone like him.</br></br>  <br> so if Rize the reason for the story to move then how is this plot moving right now both orginal and re are linked to one story <br> Rize not even reintroduced <br>nope I didn't say that she is the *only* reason, but she is one of them. Don't twist my words. Unlike Touka, Eto, Hinami and whoever else, Rize equals a plot device, a letter, a object nothing more.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;first to be ever be developed <br> It's Nishiki. He had he arc way before Hinami and Tsukiyama. And now you need to stop being delusional. <br>You know that authors develop their characters before/while they write the story which happens before they publish it, don't you anon?</br></br></br>  <br> several posts <br>That's funny. Quote every single post you see and I will take screenshot to show how lunatic you are.</br></br>  <br>Then it should be Kaneki. He is intented for Tokyo Ghoul and Tsukiyama is not. If you want to talk about first character he jas ever developed, it's the Penisman because it was his first manga.</br>  <br>Considering that there was no reply to  calling you out over that, you at least had to have posted  too</br>  <br> tryibg so hard to make everyone like him. <br>Sorry if it seems that I'm trying to make you like him, I assure you that this is not the case. It's just that most of the anime-attracted-shonen-cancer in TG threads doesn't even bother to look at his character and just calls him "useless" and "gay" because of fujos.</br></br>  <br>But Ishida confirmed it that Tsukiyama is the first character he had ever craeted, you dense shit.</br>  <br>/fit/ plz go and stay go</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570930 <br> black eyelashes instead of blue <br>Not even worth the effort.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570930 <br>Touka is more cute than that girl</br>  <br>Go see the flow of conversation you dense fuck.</br>  <br> first character <br>You mean Penisman?</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128570930 <br>How did her hair get to this colour</br>  <br>Her hairs just naturally getting lighter like her mothers.</br>  <br>This post doesn't provide any new information and just brings up the possiblity that you really are butthurt.</br>  My prediction<br> Some battle happening <br> Haise starts losing it <br> Akira does the usual, asks who he is <br> Memories coming back <br> "I'm...Kaneki Ke---" <br> Suddenly there's a quinque in Kaneki's eye <br> It's Arima <br> Gets send to Cochlea  <br> cue prison break arc with Hinami or Qs rescue mission </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Haise's losing his shit and being sent to Cochlea isn't very plausible, it's probably gonna be some quinx like Mutsuki, Shirazu or Urie.</br>  <br>If Akira's there, he'll just get shot with RC suppressants, so he couldn't really do much.</br>  <br>Something has to happen between Haise and Goumasa.</br>  <br>She doesn't take part in the Rose investigation.</br>  <br>Hopefully, but I doubt that he'll actually get to torture Haise.</br>  <br>see<br> Some battle happening <br>I don't think it'll happen this soon, we didn't get Kaneki losing it till chapter 60+</br></br></br>  <br>Then again how do we know he already didn't?</br>  <br>Elaborate.</br>  <br>Maybe he did some torture to help him lose his memories and turn him into a beta again.</br>  <br>You do know that Kaneki's memory loss was induced by Arima's brain stabbing.</br>  <br>I'm sure Kaneki had information the CCG wanted to know, they also had to repress him somehow with the "I am Haise Sasaki" bullshit.</br>  <br>see <br>I doubt that the CCG brainwashed him since there's no necessity. The name Sasaki was probably chosen by Haise himself since he probably remembered the last character of his old name which wopuld be "ki", also Sasaki is the most common name with this ending character in Japan. Also there is a japanese historical figure who has many books written about him, his name is Sasaki Hideyoshi.</br></br>  If CCG had blocked all exits into the 20th Ward during the Anteiku Raid, how did Aogiri sneak in AND out?  <br> Sasaki Hideyoshi <br>HOW DEEP DOES THE RABBIT HOLE GO</br></br>  <br><br> this is what yamorifag actually believes <br>tokage isn't a cochlea interrogator, he can't do shit against haise or hinami. pretty sure ishida just wanted to show us who was yamori's torturer and he needed to fill gaps about that character<br><br><br>yeah, ishida will definitively kill off his fujobait, riiight? don't be a fucking retard, ishida can't even kill takizawa. really man, ishida might not have killed anyone; then hide, dog girl and ape are all fucking alive</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Dog girl actually lives with Take now, but she has been demoted from Doberman to Shiba-Inu.</br>  <br>*couldn't even kill<br>fuck my typo</br></br>  The chinks scans, when?  <br> can't even kill takizawa <br>I don't see the problem in prolonging and intensifying his suffering. Death would have been a better fate for Takizawa than what he's become now.</br></br>  <br>I don't think some puny RC suppressants could do much if he really went crazy, kakuja and all.</br>  <br><br>Even if he was just determined enough he could probably shrug it off</br></br>  <br>Most of the insecure faggots are here to shit on a easy to bait series with "le edgy/fujoshit" memes so don't expect any discussion held with an audience of highschool students.</br>  <br>We used to have decent discussions, but since the cancer came here they became pretty scarce.</br>  <br>http://tieba.baidu.com/p/3921138400<wbr><br>here you go</br></wbr></br>  Hasie and the Qs know that Uta is a ghoul.

What the fuck this shit have to do with everything. I'm calling you tumbrite and you calling me landwhale. newcancer doesn't even realize is the cancerous here. Incredible</br>  <br> boogieman argument <br>Listen newfag. 4chan is a site/tool/place for discussion, not a island where we keep out people who we assume as outsiders. You'll be surprised if you took your head out of your ass and realize there are all types of people who can jump on a thread and post. I don't know what shit waters you came from but your silly tough guy act isn't moving any patriotism here. The more you post, the less anyone can take you seriously.</br></br>  <br>You do know that, with exception of Juuzou and Arima, generally, an SS ghoul can easily take on a Special Class, right? Now Ui is also stronger than the average special class, but given his ties with Arima, he probably heard about his fight with Kaneki, as well as how Shinohara lost to Kaneki earlier on.</br>  <br><br>autistic esl etofag pls go. you're not fooling anyone. especially since you're the one who constantly replies to shitposter-kun's bait</br></br>  <br>Wasn't one associate special class, and one special class? The Vash-ripoff was associate, I think, and 'Mmm boy' was special class.</br>  <br> The more you post, the less anyone can take you seriously. <br>You always keep on replying to me like a bunch of faggots. But hey, I discuss shit in here.<br><br>What the fuck are you on?</br></br></br></br>  <br> shitposter-kun <br>Don't be rude. Nobody mentioned him until now. But nice try uta.</br></br>  <br>Actually you responding to that shitposter.</br>  <br>I expected some Sawano-like bombastic shit, but that was actually nice.</br>  Could you all please shut the fuck up already and just discuss the spoilers? Thanks.  <br>Forgot to mention that Haise had a reward and was promoted because he killed a large number of ghouls. Arima tagging him along on whackamole missions must be the result.<br><br> I'll use a post to tell everyone to fuck off <br>Then discuss something.<br><br>Try reading my post.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember that I tried to discuss my shit with you, but instead you told me to kill myself. Only on tg threads.</br>  <br>Is that Hairu in the bottom panel?</br>  <br>I see. good one.</br>  <br>That was my first guess and this is a flashback before she transferred from squad 0. So yeah</br>  <br> Forgot to mention that Haise had a reward and was promoted because he killed a large number of ghouls. Arima tagging him along on whackamole missions must be the result. <br><br>Then I suppose the idea of Haise being a lot more vicious before is kinda true. I mean, the Haise we are seeing wouldn't even try to get near his limits so easily, while the one in this chapter in the flashback outdid himself and went crazy.<br><br>Maybe he really was bloodthirsty at first, and later, maybe after the operation in the flashback, he turned more and more into a beta, scared of losing control.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>did they get done fucking? why are they smoking together so sensually?</br>  <br> not a island where we keep out people who we assume as outsiders <br>Clearly when tumblr invaded 4chan it wasn't the case. Just mentioning that.</br></br>  <br> beta, scared of losing control. <br>He's always like that as kuroneki. The only reason why he acted cold as shironeki was to let loose and embrace his violence. Being in CCG around people who can take care of that violent self mellowed him out and he's afraid that he's hopeless if left a home all alone where he can't eat and behave without killing someone by accident. That's a ok premise in the start but now it's really tiring and even his new split personality is tired of his ignorance. I think Ishida is either trying to embrace the new cop drama setting as a new direction or his editors want to make Haise last longer.</br></br>  <br>Why do the editors want to keep him around longer if the creator and readers are getting tired of him?</br>  <br>The job of the editor is to make sure the work is plausible and earn them as much bucks as it is. I'm not entirely sure how Japan fanbase feels about Haise but he's voted one of top 4 in the recent poll iirc. Moreover, Ishida does a lot of side stuff during the time when the anime was ongoing. Just because the fanbase here hates him doesn't mean anything if the magazine's profits aren't affected.</br>  <br>I've been here longer than you<br> I actually okay <br>I actually okay if you stop coming to these threads.</br></br></br>  <br>Tokyo Ghoul:re Vol.1 in 5 weeks = 637,988<br>Tokyo Ghoul:re Vol.2 in 5 weeks = 768,219<br>Tokyo Ghoul:re Vol.3 in 5 weeks = 786,118<br><br>Anon each Vol of Tokyo Ghoul is increasing in sales. The third Vol outdid the other 2 Vols. So why would they immediately kill off Haise when sales are going real strong. It's a Editor's job to milk a series as much as possible. And the Nips don't seem to dislike Haise or maybe it's because reading a whole Tankobon is better than waiting weekly for a chapter.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Lets be real here Ishida is at a level where a editor can't really tell him how do his work.</br>  <br>Kaneki won't show up again until chapter 60 because muh parallels.</br>  <br> inb4 stop sucking Ishida's dick. </br>  <br>Only we, the shiteaters on /a/, are sick of the way TG is right now.<br><br>Western readers don't mean shit. He said it himself; his Japanese readers are very important to him.</br></br></br>  <br>The Editor can tell him whatever the fuck he wants to because this is his first hit. I mean even Togashi when he had a hit like Yu Yu Hakusho he couldn't do shit and the Editor had power over him. It was only till HxH he did whatever the fuck he wanted.</br>  <br> He said it himself; his Japanese readers are very important to him. <br><br>B-But..Ishida-sama said he loved us too!</br></br></br>  <br> It was only till HxH he did whatever the fuck he wanted. <br>That was the worst mistake ever letting that lazy fuck get to do what he wanted.<br> Muh back. </br></br></br>  <br>And this why people shit on tg. It's good that the threads stopped being daily.</br>  <br>Most of the Shonenshits are reading that generic Hero Academia series which is why it's starting to get a lot of daily threads.</br>  <br>Gotta make some dough from the shitty dub release of Root A right?</br>  <br>This is wrong. And we also don't know if the editor helps him or not. People always shit on editors but we don't know if they actually help stuff. I think togashis ex-editor had said that he felt the mid part of the cell saga was when dbz was going down.<br><br>Another thing to note. Kishimoto had been told iirc to make more naruto which fucked the story up. He banked tho.</br></br></br>  <br>It's not a great dub but why exactly did they dub Root homo first? Atleast kaneki doesn't sound as bored as he does in japanese though. He just sounds edgy.</br>  <br>And this why I fucking hate this fucking fanbase, because of faggots like him</br>  <br>It was part of Funimation's stupid simuldubbing nonsense. It was a stupid decision to include Root A in it, causing it to be dubbed before S1.</br>  Arima confirmed half ghoul?  It's confirmed now that the volume 4 cover will feature kanae. It's just unclear if he'll get the fron cover (like Seidou last volume) or the back cover (like hinami)  <br>I wish Tokyo Ghoul never got an Anime.</br>  <br> Because he wants to tell a story, something most of mongoloids here are incapable of understanding. <br>This is just filler because muh parallels. Haisebitch could had been killed in chapter 60, but Ishida just want to extend this damned amnesia plot until volume 6.</br></br>  <br>Please, just killed him, what would homo prince contribute to this joke of a plot?<br>Nothing, the only thing he can do is help Kanae to get rip of his extremist fanboyish.</br></br>  <br>The only thing I want for Haise is to fuck off, Kaneki going into hiding until I forget he is supposedly to be his split personality, Amon/Hinami or Ayato to take the role of MC.</br>  <br> If CCG had blocked all exits into the 20th Ward during the Anteiku Raid, how did Aogiri sneak in AND out? <br>Killing the jobbers in their way. Kaneki was able to do that too.</br></br>  <br>Those jobbers should have been able to alert others.</br>  <br> Shirazu: ‚Ä¶He‚Äôs a ghoul right? He IS a ghoul right? <br>Make Shirazu the MC, killed the Qshit with fire before they fucked this good character. <br>I have found my new lord and savior.</br></br></br>  <br>Eto might have been inside the blockade before the fighting started.<br><br>All we know is during the fighting Tarata and co. cleared an exit while everyone was distracted and confused by the appearance of a second owl.</br></br></br>  <br> that's kinda sad <br>it almost feels like a joke.</br></br>  <br>Now I want to know what Uta will make Urie's mask look like.</br>  <br> they're translations <br>And?</br></br>  <br> Damn this is actually pretty sad <br>Cheap drama.</br></br>  <br> He's always like that as kuroneki <br>No, pre-Aogiri Kaneki was starting to get more powerful, the only thing he feared was killing.</br></br>  <br>Not even he knows :^)<br><br>But also I think anon was inferring about how Tsukiyama was originally goin to be a main in another manga</br></br></br>  <br>Lack of empathy is a sign of emotional problems, anon.</br>  <br> It's good that the threads stopped being daily <br>My favorite manga is too good, my taste is too good.<br>No, the threads became shit after chapter 4 of re. And another boost of shitpost came after the chapter 31.5.</br></br></br>  <br> Lack of empathy is a sign of emotional problems <br>I don't like cheap drama, anon. In that case I would watch cheap shoujo like Ano Ride.</br></br>  <br>Ugh I don't even have anything against fanboy but I'm getting super tired of seeing things from his point of view. Tsukiyama is back now so we don't have to see Rose through him anymore. Fuck I exspected more Tsukiyama from a Tsukiyama ark not Kanae</br>  <br>he has been getting more relevant.</br>  <br>Oh damn I think I'm starting to understand Q hate here. The feeling of new secondary characters getting in the way of what you want when you don't care about them</br>  <br> Uta:I became friends with Sasaki-kun <br> Dat Yomo's reaction </br></br>  <br>Are you aware that the only development for homo prince is his bonding with this fanboy and his human pet? After that I expect him to return to be irrelevant. <br>If I have to eat Qshit, you tsukiyamafag have to suffer as well.</br></br>  <br>They've been around for nearly 40 chapters now. You might as well drop the manga,</br>  <br>It doesn't help that a lot of time is also being spent on other investigators.</br>  <br>The other investigators are the only thing that help me bear this Qshit SoL. I want more Hirako and my new waifu Ihe.</br>  <br>It always seems like her eyes are too far apart like some FAS<br> still better than touka thought </br></br>  <br> thought <br>*though god damn</br></br>  <br> The other investigators are the only thing that help me bear this Qshit SoL. <br><br>There really hasn't been that much of it since the Christmas party. The scenes they have been in have been either to move the plot or Investigator SoL.</br></br></br>  I wish I knew how to read japanese. the english version of tokyo ghoul cost twice as a much to the japanese version.  Every chapter is a good chapter without Eto, IMO. Keep it up Ishida.  Characters who singlehandedly ruined the anime they appeared in        <br>She was best girl</br>    <br> not Inami <br>oh boy</br></br>  <br><br> Inami <br><br>Why would best girl ruin the series?</br></br></br></br>  <br>She literally ruined season 1</br>  <br>yamada-san....Yamada-San.....YAMADA<wbr>_SAN!!!!</wbr></br>  <br>At least the threads were fun, kinda</br>  <br> Inami <br> best girl <br><br>Sorry for your taste, anon.</br></br></br></br>  Nao from Charlotte<br>More like everyone else except for the MC.</br>    <br>What? Without him az would turn into shit</br>  <br>Hard to ruin what's already shit.</br>  <br>That's not Asshime.</br>  <br>YER KIDDEN</br>  Only delusional Yuckynofags will disagree. Season 2 was shit thanks to her.      <br>OP said one character</br>  Biggest piece of shit MC of the decade  <br>The poster child of ruining everything. Fucking stupid character.</br>  Miku in DAL  Her name should have been "Edgy."  <br> irrational badly written plot device for drama drama  <br> good <br>If anything the show should have written out that cuck and ended it all in episode 12</br></br></br>  USED HER DEAD BROTHER TO WIN THE HAREM.  a shit, A SHIIIIIIIIIT  <br>Careful, you'll trigger the fatefags.</br>  <br>Fucking annoying bitch.</br>  <br>She's shit, yes. But it was Slaine who "singlehandedly ruined the anime".<br><br>Shithime was asleep half the time, the other half she was with Inaho.</br></br></br>  <br>worse than hitler</br>  <br>It was already shit. I appreciated and fantasized about her putting her legs on my dick, same with the girl that was close to the MCs.<br><br>Didn't mind the character at all.<br><br><br>Why did you post Slain instead of Inaho?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The lesbian from Ben-to<br><br>and those 2 sisters were pretty annoying too i guess</br></br>  <br>Inaho saved the world and was completely inoffensive<br>Slaine was a retard for no reason 90% of the time and ruined many people's lives, even down to a poor crippled girl</br></br>  <br>Inaho was a completely unrealistic and annoying as fuck gary stu, pretty much the worst thing that can be included in a modern anime.<br><br>Don't know all that shit about Slaine cause I dropped it after the first season ended and Inaho survived getting shot in the eye point blank.</br></br></br>  <br>You mean saved. Inami ruined the show and luckily Yamada carried it on her back.</br>    This fucking piece of shit  <br>The show would literally not exist without her. <br><br>Kuroneko on the other hand straight up ruined S2.</br></br></br>  This faggot could have used a major personality overhaul.  Waste of screentime  <br>Why all the hate on Near? He just showed up and did what he was supposed to do. It's not his fault Light became a deranged idiot, got sloppy, and fell into his lap. Near was a pretty great guy all things considered, he was super smart and succeeded where L and everyone else failed.</br>  <br>Spot on.<br>Kirino a shit.</br></br>  <br>Bet you've never read the VN, have you?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H2q<wbr>NFdjE_AM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>You beat me to it.<br>Given that the series is pretentious as fuck, that obnoxious fucker ruined the entire VN for me. I tried to watch the adaptation but I couldn't take him for more than 10 episodes.</br></br>  <br>Everyone in AZ was unrealistic. In terms of ruining absolutely everything, Slaine takes the cake by being a plot device made for making bad decisions. Good on you for ignoring S2.</br>    <br>Here we go again.</br>  <br>honestly, I can see why people would hate Shirou. You kind of have to like simple people with simple goals to like him,  at least until Heaven's Feel </br>  <br>Fuck you faggot</br>    The epitome of worst girl and show ruiner.<br><br>Claire a SHIT.</br></br>  <br> You kind of have to like simple people with simple goals <br>I like simple people with simple goals. Its just that Shirou over exaggerates that simple goal as the most important thing in the universe that makes it extremely fucking annoying. Literally one of the most pretentious characters I have ever experienced.</br></br>  This cumguzzler  <br>So you a Light worshipper?</br>  <br>Himeji please</br>  <br>Ruined a franchise</br>  <br><br>How can best girl ruin a show?</br></br>  <br> being retarded </br>  <br>You forgot we aren't on tumblr fujo.</br>  <br>How can su be so much of a faggot?</br>  <br>That's not Shinji.</br>    <br>This. What a stupid drama queen and hateable bitch. Her arc was the most retarded shit in the show.</br>    <br>ohhh boy, not this shit again, the VN is just hentai nothing more<br><br>Why do you give so much importance to a badly drawn hentai?</br></br></br>  <br>yes THIS is what ruined Soul Eater. Everything else about it was completely fine.</br>  <br>Fuck you nigger.</br>  <br><br><br>Bingo.</br></br></br>    <br>Edgy Two Hand sounds like a really lewd game.</br>    <br>You delusional fuck</br>  <br>He's more of a weapon/plot device than a character. Prove me wrong.</br>  Look, I'm sorry, but you don't introduce a character, try to make him significant to the plot and to the emotional well being of our protagonist, and kill him off all in the same motherfucking episode, and expect me to give a shit, or for that matter be anything but incredulous when Shinji gives a shit. That's not how character development fucking works  <br>I'll fucking cut you.</br>  <br>You know this to be true.</br>  <br> Yer kiddin' </br>    Can't even watch the 2nd season because this annoying bitch is in it.  <br><br>Nigger I'm a Sayakafag and even I know you have shit taste</br></br>  More like wet carboard cutout.  <br>ayylmaoyama was the shittiest character in that show. In before hipsters bawwwww</br>  <br><br>If Homura and Sayaka both disappeared then Madoka might be remotely bearable.</br></br>  <br>Aoyama wasn't good either, but at least she had a personality.</br>  <br>Madoka is a masterpice of the highest kind, bitch, go rewatch it again.</br>  <br>Autism&gt;Personality.</br>    <br>If him and his gay lover weren't in the show it would have had potential to be a really good show.</br>    <br>She would have killed any other show, but for me the MC did the job wonderfully by himself.<br>One of the few MCs that genuinely made me angry to see.<br><br><br>Didn't watch the anime, but she did save the manga though.</br></br></br></br></br>    Megalopolis was the only good thing she had.   ITT post any character someone likes and wait for them to shit themselves   <br>I would prefer that she was the main girl rather than removing her.</br>  <br> he likes shitty characters <br>Not my fault</br></br>  <br>The show was crap from the very beginning though.</br>  <br>Fuck, I'm too late.</br>  Literally every minute she was on screen I felt like stopping the fucking episode and doing something else.  <br>yeah just look at all these butt-hurt five waifufags... oh wait</br>  <br>Sheryl is an old an busted whore who's CDs don't even sell in clearance.</br>  <br>Replace Sayaka with Mami then yes</br>  <br><br>You lost, Rankafag, deal with it.</br></br>  <br>There is literally nothing more to that show that you couldn't see after one watch. It's pretty fucking shallow.</br>  <br>Why did they have to make this slut so cute just to kill her later?</br>  <br>Almost as bad as pic related</br>  <br>Inaho was much worse than Slaine. Boku no Pico man forgot to write characters for both of them but that just made Inaho be perfect for plot convenience and Slaine do random bullshit to further the plot. Watching Slaine was arguably more fun. <br><br>But this is mostly season 2 be glad you didn't watch it.</br></br></br>    <br>She's pretty cute. Whatever show it was, it was probably worth it.</br>    <br>Except thats wrong.<br>You should be posting Aiz or Lili.</br></br>    <br>Inaho bored me but Slaine was simply plain annoying, not fun. There was not anything fun about AZ past the first season. Slaine was terrible because on top of being badly written and inconsistent, he was angsty, ruined everything and was all around unlikable to boot.</br>  <br>Really? That's fucking manipulative.</br>    <br>I wanted to watch the series for this perflat girl.<br>Dropped it when the fat fuck threw the bento on the floor.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, he was fine by me.</br>     No pic related <br>Fuck guys, do I have to do everything around here?</br>  <br>She's hardly the reason S2 was shit.</br>    <br><br>He literally does nothing, he could ruin the show in the same sense a misplaced chair could.</br></br>  You can't pick a protagonist or primary main character that was there from the start and say they ruined the anime. That just means you thought the anime was shit, there's nothing to ruin.  <br>holy fuck lol i know this guy. i went to a neighboring school</br>  <br>No, the question can work for them. It's about characters who ruined the show, period. It refers to whatever actions said character committed etc. Could easily be something they did later on.</br>  <br>Not singlehandedly. The plot got dumber every episode - she was just the worst part of a whole mound of shit.</br>    <br> actually watchign TG </br>  This fucking bitch.    Shit voice.  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br>Hana Kana shills at it again.</br>  <br>It wasn't even Light becoming sloppy and falling in to his lap, if you rewatch Near's explanation for how he figured out Light's plan and set it up so they wouldn't die, you'll realize the reasons he gives are actually reasons that would make Light's plan work. The author just relied on the audience not actually thinking about it and just saying "Oh so clever!!!"</br>  Yokoi is a shit whore.  <br>You shut your whore mouth.</br>  <br>She was pretty likable in the movies though.</br>  <br>Fuck you nigger, Seki can't prop the show up himself.</br>  The main character.        <br>the problem was that they macguffin'd him in. You spend your entire showdown hyping up L and then finally conclude it only to go 'nope lol theres someone even better'<br>wtf is this shit, i thought we had something with clearcut writing no bullshit</br></br>  He's so boring. Something about the series seemed promising, and I got about 1/4th of the way through it before I just gave up.  <br>Wrong character anon. At least Nardo picked best girl.</br>  Fucking Katz.  I cheered when he died.   This faggot ruined the entire series, not just 1 season and 2 season but every arc he didnt even appeared in. He is a liar and tricks innocent people (even little children) for their money, then when he is a narrator he lies and tells "I did it because im gooood ok?" when with a little longterm thinking, you would realise that would be extremely illogical to pursue said stuff and instead doing it differently acording to what most people would do in said situation thats common fucking sense.<br><br><br>Having a second male in a harem anime is disgusting in its own though.</br></br></br>      <br>Oh speaking off, I cheered when the conman in monogatari died aswell.</br>  <br>this was bad before she appeared<br><br>im ashamed that, of my friends, i was the latest to drop it at ep 9</br></br></br>  <br>thank you</br>  Why doesn't anyone listen to Daiz and his nameing sheme?<br>Why don't scanlator upload the chapters as pdf instead of zip/rar?<br>Why are /ak/-scans so fucking shit?<br>Why can't we purge jaimini's box and fallen angels?<br>Why do more than one group work on Tomo-chan wa Onna no ko!?</br></br></br></br>   Why doesn't anyone listen to Daiz and his nameing sheme? <br>Because it sucks.

Anderp has Perfect Viewer, iOS should probably have something similar.<br><br>You are probably thinking of e-readers, and even some of those support still images. Some of the older kindles might need some converting but even for that there are progs to batch convert and archive them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Friendly reminder that there is some insane newfag who makes scanaltion threads for the specific purpose of saying blatantly false information/inflammatory things for the purpose of derailing them. <br><br>I'm fairly sure his actual goal is to hurt/slow down the scanlation community. It's best you just ignore these threads.</br></br>  <br>How can one autist affect a whole bunch of disconnected autist.</br>  <br> I'm fairly sure his actual goal is to hurt/slow down the scanlation community. <br> threads on /a/ have any influence on the scanlation community <br>Are you retarded?

And I just don't like it when the chapter is before the volume, it irks me to no end. Not that it matters if I were to write a parser, since the v comes before the number anyway.</br></br></br>  Translating Chapters over 40 pages makes me die inside.
