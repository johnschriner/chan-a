This hunger.  <br>Magic.</br>  <br> no panties, ever <br> not even the shadow panties from the first short <br><br>I'm confused. They made KLK, right? Why would they do this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>/co/ fucktards fuck off please.</br>  <br>if it wasn't summer i might believe you</br>  <br>I feel like losing your hat has to be the mark of a rank amateur, or someone who's kind of dumb, assuming they don't have the power or talent to cast "stick hat to head". You just wear a hat with ties on it, like a sunhat, or some cowboy hats. Maybe you lean on that if the Hat is compulsory Witch fashion and nonoptional until you know real magic and can make it stick when you have to do maneuvers that are ungraceful/not right side up.<br><br>Unwillingly displaying immodesty would be the same way. If you want to flash your panties, sure. If you are too incompetent to have magic that deals with that constantly or actively obscures your skirt dress, again, you clearly suck/have poor judgement in not wearing something sensible if you can't actually do that yet.</br></br></br>  <br> show made by japanese people in japan <br> surprised it's in japanese <br>They probably are speaking english, they're just shown speaking Japanese.<br><br>If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518?</br></br></br></br></br>  I approve of what my $300 helped bring together.  <br>Draw your own.</br>  <br>I know right.<br>PROTECT ME MARIA</br></br>  <br>She's Japanese.<br><br>Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this your first anime or something?</br>  So how are the subs for this?<br>Decent?</br>  <br><br><br>What are you talking about no retards here, that post doesn't even exist.</br></br></br>  <br>You wait for the Kickstarter for LWA3 which will be backed in a paltry 3 hours, along with all stretch goals and then some.</br>    <br>That's exactly what it feel like.</br>  <br>Spooky</br>  So the animation quality definitely isn't as high as the original, but what are your thoughts on it as a whole?<br><br>Even if it isn't up to the same standard I still think it's pretty solid</br></br>  <br>Is that what that was? I've never been to England, but I'm pretty sure britbongs don't screech like that.</br>  <br>who is this panda demon</br>  <br>There's a scene with Akko's panstu, they're dark blue.</br>  <br> If felt like a rushed older Disney movie, is this really all they could do with $625,518? <br><br><br> It is I, the animation guru who knows everything about animation </br></br></br></br>  <br>If it's any consolation, I'll make an edit of any future English dub so that Akko and only Akko still speaks moon.</br>  <br> Hand drawn Blingee <br><br>I like it.</br></br></br>  <br>600k is a pretty small amount<br><br>Consider that in the past, even for large animation studios like Disney they spent an average of 150k-300k per short for 8 minutes. That's without adjusting for inflation, either.</br></br></br>  <br> Also the only one Japanese student at that school because the other Japanese girls her age are studying to become Samurai and Ninjas in Japan. </br>  <br>Animation quality not being as high was foreseeable, what with it being longer and all, and you could clearly see the segments the budget went to. A fluid and pretty animation even throughout the minor segments would have been too much for me too handle.<br><br>I liked it about as much as the first one, which is to say a lot.</br></br></br>   the boy tightly grabbing diana's ass the whole time <br><br>Fucking prick.</br></br>  <br>It is as cute and amusing as the original but yeah, animation quality is lower. I would attribute that to Trigger not having as much time as they do and should had spent now compared to when they were just starting up 2-3 years ago. Back then, weren't they only working on Inferno Cop and just planning out KLK?</br>  Did they release a copy without the English subtitles?  <br>Just like Dawn's are black, right?<br><br>But seriously, that tiny frame is like the only shadow panties in the whole thing? It's like a complete 180 from the first ep.</br></br></br>  So, when are BDs supposed to come out?  <br>I'll like it more if it had hand-drawn Snoop.</br>  Seriously. What the fuck is wrong with some of you. Trigger specifically asked you not to distribute this. Give them respect and don't be a douchenozzle who torrents this immediately. You're a selfish prick and I hope you all fall into a blender and get chopped up into a million pieces.  <br>Aug?</br>  <br>Up until the scene where the parade begins, it wasn't all that stunning. It was still enjoyable and fun but didn't really capture the feeling of LWA1.<br><br>As soon as the parade began, it was magical. I was somewhat afraid of what Trigger might end up producing but it met my expectations and then some. The new characters were very fun too. Maybe my expectations weren't as high as others after watching some of their more recent series.<br><br>Anyways, Amanda best girl from the new lot.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Someone get this hot-head out of here!<br><br> I agree with you </br></br></br>  <br>I realize that it's not going to look like a Disney movie without a huge budget. Google led me a cost of about 150k per episode of anime on average, this was from 2011, so with a bit under twice the budget they'd need for something twice a long as a regular episode I figured they could have made it look better.</br>  <br> Not downloading now and buying the BD and all surrounding merch later. </br>  <br>Nigga I backed this and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa.</br>  <br>why you yelling at me for , I gave them money and watched it at vimeo</br>  <br>cry more</br>      <br>That $600k+ also went into merchandise and other stuff.</br>  <br> and even I'm downloading it from Nyaa. <br>why arn't you getting a BD anyway?</br></br>  I want to beat the living shit out of those normie brats who were pelting our witches with disgusting commoner fruit.

Everyone else just gets a special thanks on their website, I think.</br>  <br/>  <br>yeah someone here said 300+</br>  <br>Yeah, it was like $300 or more.</br>  <br>Poorfags BTFO.</br>  <br>She was alright. She did a lot more by not talking and being aloof, in my opinion, it shows her character, but I agree with  in that Food girl needed something other than food.</br>  <br>Can this be a gif? Or even a Youtube?</br>  <br>Yeah that's true. Neither of them had a whole dance routine of time devoted to expound on their background.</br>  <br> implying a 30-something NEET lowlife living with his parents would donate enough to have their name put on the end credits </br>   diana cheering akko on <br>cute</br>  Do we know how much money was on TRIGGER's end?  So what do we need to do to get a full series? I was wary at first of getting LWB without the animation quality, fearing the animation is what gave it its charm, but now I have confidence in Trigger to give LWB proper presentation with a more limited budget, since the characters and universe are well-thought out and charming enough.  <br>I have you know I'm a professional engineering living with my parents.</br>  <br> somefaggotsstupidname (Sup /a/?) </br>  <br>Do we know if they are going to make more money from this movie too?</br>  <br> I'm a professional engineering <br>Sure you are.</br></br>  So Good Smile Company is plastered on the front and end of LWA2. Does this mean that they'll finally get around to making figures?  <br>Please be nice to Collin. He put over $300 into the kickstarter you know.</br>   Sorry, comments have been disabled by the owner of this video.   Did Takafumi Hori save Trigger's animation once again?   AOTY   <br>Anyone?</br>  <br>Probably. But that's kind of risky, the figure market in the west is nowhere near as huge as in Japan. Is LWA even popular in Japan? It looked like Trigger was making it mostly for the west (in the credits you don't see many Japanese names).</br>  <br>There were no panties in the first ep. Just impossible skirts.</br>  I like Amanda enough that I wish she'd been in the first OVA  <br>I dont think many japanese know what kickstarter is though do they?</br>  <br>Skirts like that exist, you know.</br>  <br>Well, Kickstarter is mainly a western thing so that makes sense.</br>   /a/ backs LWA2 <br> Trigger delivers a great movie <br><br> leddit and Tumblr back Under the Dog <br> CIA in shambles, production drama and setbacks <br>Feels great.<br><br><br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>They liked the animation but wasn't all over it like the West.<br> in the credits you don't see many Japanese names <br>I don't think they're familiar with KS.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really don't understand why there isn't more like this. CGDGT slice-of-life as everyone seems to enjoy, just in a slightly more novel setting with a fantastic or sci-fi element to jazz things up a bit.  <br>That might just be Elevens not being into Kickstarter. Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously).</br>  <br>There was lots of Japanese names, just in romaji</br>  <br>That's just cause not many japs paid 300 dollars to be there.</br>  <br>jokes on them , I can fap to thighs alone.</br>  <br> Under the Dog <br><br>Was that one with Kojima?</br></br></br>  <br>Man, that Akko bitch ended up trashing Lotte's pillow.</br>  Is this the tripfags general?  <br>What a slut</br>  <br> Although I did hear of some of them hating on the project for having been tainted by dirty gaijin. <br>[citation needed]</br></br>  <br>B-but muh slightly different school clubs are so much more fresh!</br>  <br> Not sure how common that view was (or if anyone actually meant it seriously) <br>I was in  the Yaraon threads  and they were more surprised/amused by that than anything. Only a handful of trolls were saying anything like that, and it was pretty clear they hadn't watched the OVA.<br> so this is a ripoff of Madoka funded by Amerika-jin, right??? </br></br></br>  It's official. LWA 2 &gt; LWA  <br>And hey, at the end of the day, if UTD comes out and is good, we can still enjoy it, if not, we can snark on it. It's win-win.</br>  <br>Literally the next sentence it is pointed out that that statement could be false.</br>  <br> CGDGT  <br>That's one long-ass acronym.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>   Fat-chan literally did nothing but eat, give food, and generally be fat <br>Impressive. She was still adorable though.</br>  I need a webm of Akko's transformation scene  <br> &gt;Fat-chan literally did nothing <br>she acted as the weight for the catapult.</br></br>  <br>I await the butthurt tumblr will have about fat shaming despite the character being fun, funny and cute.</br>  where is the high definition torrent? the vimo stream is choppy and atrocious. (my toaster doesn't do well with streaming)  <br>sankyuu</br>  <br>Looks like it was 20$+ to have your name on the website. I'm in the poorest of the poorfags.</br>  <br>I had<br> and generally be fat <br>for that one. The catapult was hilarious.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe not in that scene you posted. And I said shadow panties, not actual panties.</br>  <br>LWA3 when?</br>  <br>I don't think we'll get better than the 720p stream until backers get their actual BDs.</br>  <br>Yeah, she was the weak link of the secondary power trio.<br><br>I'd actually like to see a third OVA of the secondaries, but with Diana instead of her.</br></br></br>  Where the fuck is the 720p on Nyaa?  <br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK<br><br>IT WAS JUST DOLPHIN PORN YOU FUCK</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yaraon threads <br>whats that?</br></br>  <br>She seemed to make herself larger there too. I wonder if that was just a visual gag or if she's one of those calorie-consuming magic types like Chouji in Naruto or that Zero Squad lady in Bleach.</br>  <br>Japanese Gaia, more or less.</br>  <br> DOLPHIN PORN <br>thats good too</br></br>  <br>720 is high definition you idiot, and that's what i was asking about.</br>  <br>Picked up.</br>  Was there no Kickstarter update?  <br>It's  2 years lurking before posting, faggot </br>  <br>so filled with 13 year old kids?</br>  <br>nvm, found the Trigger email</br>  <br> Is LWA even popular in Japan? <br>I remember that trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend</br></br>  <br>I fucking wish I could make that joke.</br>  <br>Christ, someone's mad they can't get their pirated anime as fast as they want.</br>  <br>They did mention the emails going out around the AX screening in one of the previous KS updates but no, no update when the emails did go out.</br>  <br>Scene-wise, I think the first one was more memorable and better animated but overall, I think the second had the better story and characters.</br>  <br>If I never got into Ragnarok I would never know this feeling.</br>  <br>Trigger got probably more fan outside of japan than inside.</br>  <br>Some of the posters are clearly what we would call underage, yes. You'd fit right in.</br>  <br><br> trigger cancelled a LWA academia event just because they couldn't get 200 people to attend <br>s-seriously?</br></br></br>  <br><br>i am a backer, my computer is just a toaster and can't stream.</br></br>  <br> magnet:?xt=urn:btih:00820fc737e6cdd<wbr>fa2ea27fe37cd48928df06f30&amp;dn=388264<wbr>041.mp4&amp;tr=http%3a%2f%2fopen.nyaato<wbr>rrents.info%3a6544%2fannounce</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>Does this work for you?</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2013-08-12/little-witch-academia-<wbr>tokyo-event-cancelled-due-to-low-ti<wbr>cket-sales</wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Not the only one, my friend.</br>  <br> first KS <br> was a student working at a deli <br> back $100 <br><br>If they open a KS for LWA3, I'm tossing a lot more in it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Because they didn't advertise it well enough. Most nips didn't even hear about the event until it was over.</br></br></br>  <br>it appears to be on kissanime</br>  <br>First definitely was jaw dropping around everything concerning magical fiesta. But I got chills when the parade started, and I actually think this has the better animation. You can see it clearly in Amanda.</br>  <br>If you were a backer you would know that you can DDL it from Vimeo.</br>  <br><br>if my computer is a toaster, and i say it's a toaster, what part of your small undeveloped nigger brain can't put 1 and 1 together to figure out i can't even magnet? <br><br>if there's an actual torrent on nyaa, say so, because i can't find it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> In order to kick off the event, Studio Trigger needed to sell at least 200 of the 400 possible tickets, but sales ended on August 12 with only 94 tickets sold.  <br><br> only 94 tickets sold <br><br>Damn.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't know that<br>how do you do that?</br></br>  <br>fuck off faggit</br>  what is the runtime for this ova? 35 minutes?  <br>if i never stream or used vimo, how would i by default know i could download the file? oh right, i wouldn't.</br>  <br> This video cannot be downloaded any more right now. Please try again later </br>  <br>Rude.</br>  <br>I never did magnets before but it worked fine for me.</br>  <br>The fuck are you on about? I don't know who you are.</br>  Jasmineka will turn out to be something greater in LWA3. I hope.  <br>Plus it had been out for six months. Everyone had already seen it, so the only draw was the creator talkback, which for a single OVA by a new studio isn't going to pull much attendance as a stand-alone event</br>  <br>There isn't anymore. It got deleted. You've got the magnet as your sole option.</br>  <br>There's a DDL link right under the video. They seem to be capping concurrent downloads, but it's the middle of the night EST so you probably should be able to get it.<br><br><br>Uh, because Trigger told us that there would be a download for backers two fucking years ago?<br><br><br>Yeah, that's the antiflood. I got that about eight times before it let me download it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>53 min</br>  <br> You can see it clearly in Amanda. <br>The only place you can see it clearly, because good luck taking your eyes off her.</br></br>  <br> My computer is a toaster so I can't magnet <br>Yes you can. You just don't know what the fuck is a magnet or how they work.</br></br>  <br>  The torrent you are looking for does not appear to be in the database. </br>  <br>have you tried turning it off and on again?</br>  <br>Toasters can use magnets.</br>  <br>Akkovision and Am and a vision were about 50/50 and all qt.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure I came at this part.<br><br>I want to do lewd things to Mandy</br></br></br>  <br>I actually watched the entire show a few weeks ago, it was pretty damn funny. Shame it had so few seasons and the seasons were so short.</br>  <br>the magnet didn't work for me. what was that about toasters being able to use magnets again? idiot. <br><br>anyways, i found the download link on the vimo. thanks for nothing to the rest of you inept useless virgin fags.</br></br></br>  <br>wayfu4layfu</br>  <br>Are you insulting yourself?</br>  Reminder that Sucy is the best girl  <br>Ha, get fucked.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me. <br>Then you were holding it wrong.</br></br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Figured she'd be a lot more rebellious. Smoking cigs, talking like a delinquent, etc.</br>  <br>You can't even call it a toaster then.</br>  <br> the magnet didn't work for me <br>Clearly you're doing something wrong</br></br>  <br> mfw the person who sat in front of me at the premiere posted a picture of Yoshinari &amp; Otsuka to Instagram with the caption "based trigger" </br>  <br>Have you tried to swipe it across your HDD?<br>Fucking magnet, how do they work?</br></br>  so the download is around 590 mb right?  Does no one else like this qt?  <br>596 to be exact</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Dis nigga ain't got no magic in his heart.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>596.9mb</br>  <br>I like her, she's like a loli witch freeman</br>  <br>I thought she was a fun character but you're mostly going to get posts to the effect of <br> Constanze <br> I seriously hope you witches don't do this </br></br></br>  <br>slice of life is easy because it's cheap, i'd imagine.<br><br>then again i have no idea how budget is distributed in shows. Do they just pay the quality of animators? is it based on the number of frames to be made?</br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got some lines. But she's in the top 3 for me.</br>  <br>Just allow it in program you're using or copypaste it directly you sad faglord. Don't blame your incompetence on objects.</br>  <br> Akko, Sucy, Lotte, Diana, Ursula-sensei, Amanda, Constantze <br>These are the witches that cause me pathological grinning</br></br>  <br><br>god damn right i don't. but i had 300 bucks in my wallet when the kickstarter rolled around. and i'll have another 300 for the third ep.<br><br>and i'm not a nigger. i'm a proud aryan american national socialist.</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCKING MAGNETS<br><br>HOW DO THEY WORK?</br></br></br>  <br>For some strange reason throughout I thought Constanze was a boy</br>  Haven't watched it yet. <br>Is Sucy still best girl?</br>  Fucking magnets, how do they work?  <br>Use those 300 dollars to buy a better toaster. Maybe one with four bread slots.</br>  <br>Yes. Amanda is best new girl though.</br>  <br><br>you're not funny. don't you have MLP to watch and a fedora to tip? you should go do that. you can fucking spot the redditors a mile away, i swear</br></br>  <br><br>its my understanding they work when the field lines created by the movement of electrons tend to point in a general direction instead of randomly cancelling each other out.</br></br>  I want some magic in my life  <br> that lotte botting </br>  <br>Please, keep posting.

I would.</br></br></br>  <br>I want one</br>  <br>I could throw 1000$ at it now.</br>  <br>That's a misconception.

(cough cough law school)</br>  <br>Akko is literally's Sucy's bitch. You can tell right away she's dominant as fuck.</br>  <br>I paid for this. Why would I watch it on vimeo if I can torrent it?</br>  <br>why is she in a magic school if she wants to build robots?</br>  <br>How about a 16-slice toaster?</br>   German is the ugliest <br>Just like in real life!</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.</br>  <br><br><br>shippers need to die<br><br>waifuism is the only way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why not? I'm enjoying them.</br>  <br>I would. Didn't back the previous one because I had doubts. No longer.</br>  <br>But can it open magnet links?</br>    <br>why would you need to if you have that much toast?</br>  If anyone is still downloading how fast is it going for you? I'm getting only getting 6KB/s.  <br>I was worried they wouldn't be able to capture the feeling of the original but they did a fantastic job. Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious.</br>  <br>Comparing the two, I think the first one had better lighting and smoothness of the overall animation, but that doesn't mean that this one was bad at all. It would be an added bonus though if they actually continue to improve on it until we get the BDs.</br>   There is no need to be upset   <br> Their recent works, while many on /a/ may love them, had me cautious. <br>yeah klk was not bad but it didn't particularly wow me either.</br></br>  Cool, sticky, now we can just keep it in one thread.

I can't remember off the top of my head where the cutoff was.</br>  Trigger saved anime again.  <br>seriously. I'll admit i'm a very cynical person, even more so than is warrented much of the time. But at the end of the video I actually caught myself smiling. This series is just too fun and adventurous for me to dislike.</br>   Fat-chan's early design was this.   If Amanda was going to get exactly one doujin, which three fetishes should it have?  <br>Futa and two others</br>  <br>I was downloading this, does it mean my download is corrupted?</br>  <br>I'm happier with what we got.</br>  oh shit.<br>LWA is still on my backlog</br>  <br>Squinty eyed girl is cute.</br>  <br>Christ.</br>  <br>I was still in school, technically the 100$ I gave from money meant for books and other educational expenses.</br>  <br>Hurry up fam</br>  <br>If you weren't rolling around on the floor, writhing in joy anytime someone other than Jasmina was onscreen, you're bad at LWA.</br>  <br>Was doing other stuff plus I don't check /a/ too often anymore. Whenever I do come my pic folder manages to double in size.</br>  <br>Well the magic is needed to power those robots and technology she makes.</br>  Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one?  <br>For Fat-chan, they could've put in anybody and it would've worked. She was pretty useless...</br>  <br>Futa  and scat and snuff </br>  <br>Spats<br>Cowgirl Position<br>Femdom</br></br></br>  <br>I think they need to tone her down a bit</br>  <br>Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes.</br>  <br>I don't know, but for sure it should be illustrated by hirame.</br>  <br>Non-H, adventures, and with Diana</br>  <br>$300 to be in movie credits<br>$20 to be on website<br><br>less than that, and you just get an e-mail.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah! The crossover was great. Did they release it yet?</br>  <br>spats and femdom</br>  <br>YES<br>FUCKING YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES<br>YES</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. What a delightful series.  <br>femdom<br>zettai ryouiki<br>defloration</br></br></br>  <br>Fat-chan delivers candy to the people.</br>  <br> Is it just me, or is Akko being more annoying than in the first one? <br><br>I wanted to punch her, she was too fucking much. Then she has a sob which auto redeems her character some how and the plot falls on her lap. She's probably the worst character in the whole series, and it doesn't help that all the new girls were so delicious, smarter and level headed. <br><br>Akko behaves like a 10 year old girl.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They needed her to be to set up for the heartwarming friendship to come out. When Lotte showed up and gave Akko the hat, I teared up a little.</br>  <br>That's the full one.</br>  <br>Early on yeah, had to be so that she could fall out with Lotte and Sucy in order to make up and save the day with the power of friendship.</br>  <br>Right~~ She was fine in the first one, but sorta kinda very annoying in this one. At least she became okay in the second half of the ep.</br>  <br> I wish I had a family to watch LWA with. </br>  <br>straight<br>consensual sex<br>missionary position</br></br></br>  <br>Your name is only in the credits if you backed $300.</br>  <br>And then there's THIS faggot...</br>  Damn hardsubs  I'm finally watching the movie. Amanda is fantastic as people said, so is Diana, Sucy being best as always. But I have to say Akko was a bit more annoying in this one, I can see why Yoshinari doesn't like her very much. Not that I hate her.  <br>I think you mean the fat girl eating donuts is the best girl</br>  <br><br>yes</br></br>  <br>Catch up, nigga</br>  This is like a cross between gainax/trigger and Disney. Absolutely stunning. I seriously hope they do more original stuff like this even if they need to kickstart more stuff just so they can have the freedom to do what they want without producers stopping them.  You guys do know that at this point it isn't really anime? It's literally for the western audience.<br>Man, Trigger really sold out.</br>  <br>Sounds like you could have used those.</br>  <br>But the cannonball...</br>  What Akko needs is someone to calm her down. Like a girlfriend.  Like Diana   <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br>You again? Go away.</br>  <br>Now I remember why I put the name as Anonymous instead of something fun. I would've loved to see my name in the movie, but I rather not have my name posted on a website rarely anyone will visit besides spambots. Can't wait to get the Bluray though.</br>  WHERE WERE YOU<br><br>WHEN TRIGGER SAVED ANIME?</br></br>  <br>give me a break I doing shots.</br>  This thread is moving too sanic for me now.  What's the point of the HorribleSubs release?  Is [HorribleSubs] good?  <br> Disney <br>Funny you mention that, because there was rumors Pixar was working with Trigger.</br></br>  <br> Not Sucy <br>She'll keep her calm.  Forcibly </br></br>  <br> Gang-bang, catsuit, tomatoes. <br>How would tomatoes work as a fetish? Like a bunch of shotas shoving tomatoes into her, filling her up with them?</br></br>  Lets be honest, nobody cares about this shit anymore. Wasted money.  <br>Gross.</br>  <br><br>How to spot the retarded Redditfag.</br></br>  <br>Saw my name in the credits. Kinda wish I had put a silly one.</br>    <br>Her girlfriend is sushi.</br>  I don't get it.<br>Why does trigger produce trash like kill lel kill, inoushit and ninja slayer when they have the original right LWA?</br>  <br> What's the point of the HorribleSubs release? <br>Well for one the previous upload got deleted, again</br></br>   sticky <br>Okay, now this thread is total cancer.</br>  <br>nothing weird like that<br>just reverse cowgirl while juggling tomatoes<br>thats good clean fun.</br></br></br>  <br>We know it's you Diana.</br>  <br>Ah yes, anon's bait.</br>  Amanda has some nice thighs.  <br>Because Yoshinari has yet to work on full-length TV shows.</br>  <br><br>e-peen.<br><br> we were the first to release LWA2, guys! </br></br></br></br>  It was worth it, Trigger is truly saving anime.  <br>I'm sure Sucy has ways of keeping people calm. I'm sure they involve mushrooms.</br>    I hereby claim that my $400 paid for Trigger to come up with Amanda. I called it, now you never can, neener neener neener.   that scene where Lotte sings <br> I imagine it's Rukia singing </br>  <br> CGDCT <br>Fuck off you lazzy cunt.</br></br>  <br><br>Maybe the shitposting won't happen as fast.</br></br>  <br>where is this from</br>  <br>Use the juice as lube.</br>  <br>who?</br>  Fuck I have work due and still have the first one on my backlog, should I just cram it all tonight or take my time and enjoy it tomorrow?  <br>Tomato juice would make terrible lube. Far to acidic.</br>  <br>Fuck work, nigga.</br>    <br>put aren't vagoos already acidic anyway?</br>  <br>Get to work man, the OVA will keep.</br>  <br><br>Of course. Didn't you know anime will become illegal tomorrow? Better get your anime in before the feds come for you, pedo.</br></br>  <br> How would tomatoes work as a fetish. <br><br>They use Roger or Kyouko instead of fat, balding, old men.</br></br></br>  <br>put in some baking soda?</br>  <br>Okay, that was amusing and that  is nice (nice triples) but as I said, she could've been replaced by anybody. I like her but she is the most replaceable of any of the new girls.</br>  <br>we will still be here tomorrow anon, take care of your obligations.</br>  <br>Standard procedure is to pay animators one ramen noodle per frame drawn. <br>That's why TV anime would often fall into QUALITY, since they were under extremely tight deadlines to shit out as many frames as possible.<br>KyoAni has been famously paying its artists by the hour, allowing for a slightly less stressed work output. Still often looks like shit since most of the animators are female, but you take what you can get.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really. Most bodily fluids are close to pH neutral, unless you've got something wrong with you.</br>    <br>Screwing on a pile of tomatoes, throwing tomatoes at each other while screwing, licking tomato paste off each other,  inserting a whole tomato in her anus , etc</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  I never understood the extreme fascination /a/ had for LWA, I just don't get it.  Did everybody use their real fucking names? Where's the Nig Ger Dix?  When will Diana admit her yuri?  <br> Not really. <br>yes really<br>vaginal pH is typically 3.5 to 4.5.</br></br></br>  That furby  <br>of course you don't anon, you're just a fagoot.</br>  <br>Suck a dick, pinko scum.</br>    <br> Mohammed Malik <br>kek</br></br>  were all of you watching this with a hand on your dick? it wasn't that good, it was just okay  <br> tfw misread Guckin as "Cuckin" <br>I spend too much time here.</br></br>  Watching this made me really happy. It sounds dumb, but it made me feel joy in a way so few anime have. I'm so glad I backed and believed in them.  <br>Those names are the $300+ tier, probably not too many jokers in that bunch.</br>  When did this happen? I din't even know there was going to be a LWA2 in the first place.  I didn't know Akko was gay for Sucy.  <br><br>It's literally NOTHING special.</br></br>  <br>Lurk moar, faggot.</br>  <br> feel joy in a way so few anime have. <br><br>Maybe you just have shit taste.</br></br></br>  <br> Gameboy <br> Tamagotchi <br> Furby <br> SNES </br></br></br></br>  Full show when?  <br>uh, anon</br>  <br>And the tamagotchi too.</br>  Them thighs  I want to fuck Akko.  <br>neo-/a/ loves niwaka gaijin friendly not-anime type shit</br>  <br>They could've at least alphabetized it but yeah... what  said.</br>  <br>That rarely works for screencaps so fuck off.</br>  <br>goodTaste/10</br>  Here's some more.

I don't see why this isn't stickied in /co/ but in /a/.</br>  <br>Fucking Oli</br>  Thank you, based Trigger, for saving anime once again.  <br><br> devil "the boner snake" dante <br> abdullah al-moushari </br></br></br>  how much did the russian state orchestra donate to the kickstarter?    <br> for saving anime <br>You mean cartoons.</br></br>  <br> ban evading <br>You need to leave.</br></br>  Which witch would you tie up naked and throw tomatoes at?  <br><br>I just realized yesterday it's a portmanteau of egg-friend</br></br>  <br> Jesus Gomez </br>    <br> implying <br>If this is considered anime, then so is whatever the french, koreans, and chinese make as well.</br></br>  <br> Kyonko <br>Heh.</br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop </br>  <br>It's a common spic name. They pronounce it "hey-soos."</br>   Harry Potter reference for your new anime <br>Trigger confirmed for bros</br>  <br> dem short shorts <br> not fanservice <br>Sure thing, normie, I'm going to fap.</br></br></br>  <br>actually not that unusual , a lot of Hispanics name their kids Jesus for one reason or another.</br>  <br>Footjob, sumata, leg lock</br>  New torrent plx  <br>No, just confirmed for gaijin pandering.</br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Trigger, you can't back your own show</br></br>  <br> gg fansubs </br>  <br>huke too?</br>  Did anyone upload it to mega?  <br>This is my first reply to this cancerous thread and I'm ban evading.<br>If this is anime then why you faggots don't let me have a √îban star racers thread in /a/. This is the same shit. take your cancer back to /co/.</br></br>  <br>fuck off</br>  <br>Did Don Francisco appear in the credits?<br><br><br> koreans, chinese <br>They only do outsource work.<br> the french <br>It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Devil "The Boner Snake" Dante <br><br>holy fuck, I don't know why I laughed so hard.</br></br></br>  Hopefully i like to think the some ~4000 people who backed it enough to get a copy of the film simply wanted a way to watch it more outside the time frame of it online. Like ideally i want to believe the people torrenting it did drop the money already and are not hurting the potential sales. It was well worth the money.  <br> It's only anime when it's headed by the elevens. <br>You obviously didn't read what I was implying.</br></br>  <br> "hey-soos" <br> not "Hey, Zeus" <br>You had one fucking job, nigger.</br></br></br>  <br> This episode is brought to you by: The color blue </br>  <br>Attentionwhoring, even in death.</br>  <br>What else in there?<br>Game Boy, Tamagatchi, SuperFami, don't recognize the wand, Walkman...</br></br>  Technomage is best witch, pass it on.  <br>Blue from /a/, though I'm not sure he posts with the name anymore.</br>  <br>No one cares what you think</br>  <br>Why is this the only time /a/ is against torrenting. Fuck off with the hypocrisy. Everyone should download the HorribleSubs release and only buy the BD if they liked it.</br>  Post your favorite background witches  <br>You were implying nonsense. Go whine in a Ninja Slayer thread, or make an Aku no Hana thread and shitpost about how Japan has fallen to Western standards.</br>  <br> Why is this the only time /a/ <br> implying /a/ is in this thread <br>This is normalfag central my friend.</br></br></br>  <br><br>but it's ok to torrent everything else? They had the production paid for completely, they aren't losing anything. Any sale is a bonus.</br></br>  I ship  Akko X Lotte   <br>I torrented it without paying.<br>What are you going to do bitch.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing him a few months ago but nothing since. Did he died?</br>  Thank you trigger for show tomatos in face and that ducking stool. <br><br>Its as close as we're going to get to WAM stuff with dunk tanks fully animated in /a/.</br></br>  OST when?  <br>I ship  LWA2 BDs in August, thanks for the support </br>  <br>Lotte</br>  Quick stitch of all backers.  <br>And that's why they fucked up by sticking it in /a/. This should go in /co/ where it belongs. Also yuri pandering in an already backed OVA, Kek Trigger you're not selling high so why are you trying to get the panderbux?</br>  <br>All of them.</br>  <br>If I'm not mistaken, he's still around.  meguca  maybe.</br>  Watched at the premiere today, sitting outside an event hall torrenting this on my phone because I want to watch it again; it was that good.   Witch Knight <br><br>Whatever that is, I want to watch it.</br></br>  <br>You're a sick man  and my nigga .</br>  There goes my ONE THOUSAND DORRARS.<br><br>No regrets, of course.</br></br>  Now we just need Little Gentlemen Academia  I want to marry Lotte.  <br>Shit meant to quote </br>  <br> GARfunkel <br> Edward <br>...heh.</br></br></br>  <br>All $300+ backers.<br>We paid good money to get our names there.</br></br>  <br> Diana's groupies will never belittle your penis </br>  <br>there will be people who choose to torrent or stream or find an uploaded version online that never intended to buy the physical copy. There will be plenty of people, me included, who watch the ova online and then buy the bluray when it becomes available</br>  <br>Uh huh...</br>  someone has a webm with fatty-chan and the catapult? That scene was glorious.  COLLIN, WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THIS THREAD. SPEAK UP.  was the first ova this devoid of music? Half the time it just felt really "empty" listening to Akko's voice over and over again without the whimsical music in the background.  So is horriblesubs better than the first one that got deleted. Downloaded both and which one should I watch?  <br>OVA three plot confirmed?</br>  <br>You already did, but here's another.</br>    <br>It's the same version. They just reuped it.</br>  <br>what about the subs are they identical?</br>  <br>Un-glassed eyes...!</br>  <br>Ask and you shall receive.</br>  <br> Cute no-glasses face </br>  <br>Shiny Chariot versus Witch Knight, with antics from the girls meanwhile? Or maybe Akko (as Shiny Chariot) versus Diana (as Witch Knight)?<br><br>There really needs to be one last finale. A trilogy would be perfect.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>And now male version w/ headphones</br></br></br>  <br>why shouldn't they be. This isn't fansubbed, it's the official subs distributed to the KS donators.</br>  <br>awesome, I love it.</br>  <br><br>Maybe she's Lotte's Chariot.</br></br>  <br> unironically implying yuri sells </br>  <br>i thought they are hard subbed</br>  <br> one last finale <br> not a 2 cour series </br></br>  <br><br>Not to mention the official subs are hardcoded, so there's no point in trying to lay out a new subtitle track.</br></br>   paying for anime <br>Am I on reddit?</br>   No "A believing heart is your magic" <br>You had one job, Trigger</br>  <br>Yuri hints sell. Madoka sold like crazy and so did K-On. Trigger wanted in on some of those panderingbux.</br>  <br>The quality wouldn't be the same, we'd get some ninja slayer animation</br>  <br>A trilogy of OVAs and then a series is fine too.<br><br>Learning more about the school and the other characters while they go on misadventures would be able to span quite a few episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>DASA!</br>  IS there an OST download?  <br>In this case not paying for it actually means it's not getting made.<br>If they didn't hit the KS goal it wouldn't of been created in the first place.</br></br>  <br> panderingbux <br>Added to filter.</br></br>  <br>It's weird, I had the same thought, though no outline to make that comparison.</br>  <br>Thank you! I really enjoyed your movie.</br>  Kinky.  <br> Wanting a TV series from Triiger. <br>If the OVA which took years to do looks OK at best in the first half then imagine how bad the tv anime would look. Maybe even lower than Ninja Slayer and they won't be even doing it ironically.</br></br>  <br>They sold for reasons not related to yuri.</br>  <br> kill la kill  looked good</br>  <br>Don't engage him</br>  <br>Explain LL then. Yuri hints sell in Japan. That's what Trigger wanted to which is a shame because the first OVA was better without all this nonsense.</br>  <br>That's why I originally said a trilogy of OVAs. They can amass the funds via Kickstarter again, take their time with it and have it look equally as good as LWA2 or potentially better.<br><br><br>You're going to get a lot of flak for that, especially with certain episodes and CG.</br></br></br></br>  I just got back from work.<br><br>Any update on when HD is being uploaded to nyaa?</br></br>    <br>It's a pet project, so I could see a kickstarter-backed trilogy OVA. <br>Plot-wise, Witch Knight would be someone other than Diana, given that small spiel about her family heritage. Is WK even current, or bygone like Chariot?</br></br>  <br>Nice fallacy.</br>  <br>no<br><br>it's a webm<br><br>webm is best</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fucking legs</br>  <br>At the anime expo premiere the speaker had a shirt that said Pixar animation on the left side if his chest</br>  <br>Say you're right and it does sell. All Trigger did was make a decision to give some fanservice to the majority who would like it, seeing as how it's popular and sales-driving. In other words they don't care about you, the minority, so cry more.</br>  <br>Try reading some manga, there's a shit ton of comfy stuff in fantastical settings<br> Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou <br> Aria <br> Dead Dead Demons Dedededestruction <br> Kyoukai Senjou no Rinbo </br></br></br></br></br>    <br>As main director you mean? <br><br>Because he's worked as lead animator and episode director on more than one TV show</br></br></br>  <br>And Sucy collects it all and sells it off on some sketch site.</br>  i like how the giant got cute at the end.<br><br>Everything was comfy.</br></br>  <br>Japs wear shirts with random English on them all the time.</br>  <br>Love YKK. So pleasant.</br>  <br>Kek. You know this OVA is stained by the yuribait because Trigger wants some mire money when it could've been better without it but you will always defend it won't you Triggerdrone?</br>  <br> You had one job, Trigger </br>  <br>If I remember correctly, they didn't change that much (or at all) in the BDs, right? There was a lot of questionable animation for KlK. Never watched Inou Battle but I imagine that was decently animated.</br>  <br> yuribait <br> Triggerdrone <br>Gave yourself away pretty quickly, didn't you?</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop <br>Yes<br> gg fansubs <br>No</br></br></br></br>  The fuck is this girly moe shit? I heard it was made by Trigger so I excpected something awesome and manly like KLK. Fucking false advertising moe bullshit.  <br>Here's your reply</br>  <br><br> shitposting in a sticky </br></br>  <br>KLK was manly?</br>  <br>And I don't care about them either. I didn't back their shit. I torrented it and uploaded it on other torrent trackers so that people find it easier to dl.<br>It's just laughable how people proclaim that Trigger cares about what they do and animate when in reality are no different than any other studio that does design by committee.</br></br>  <br>I know this is bait but<br> implying Trigger aren't the biggest yurifags </br></br>  <br><br><br><br>years ago Gainax actually paid a visit to Pixar. Safe to say they love each other very much.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Best girl. I'd fund LWA3 if we got more of her in it.  <br>Is that Shigeru Miyamoto with a wig?</br>  Based. Fucking. Trigger.<br><br>That sakuga everywhere. Pure animation porn.</br></br>  <br>People like yuri pandering so they gave it to them. What exactly is the problem again? Sounds to me like you're just  triggered. </br>  <br>Why is Saber such a slut?</br>  <br>Honestly, I'm glad they subverted expectations with all three of those girls. They seemed like a group that would be at ends with the original three until you actually saw them interact. Even the Constanze, without any verbal interactions, came off different than expected. I thought she would be somewhat similar to Sucy's attitude.</br>  Who is best Little Witch?  <br>The robot.</br>   no panties <br>Oh my.</br>  <br>Because she know how to please men.</br>  <br>Did they fuck?</br>  Sushi pls  <br>she is a cutie you monster</br>  Blewit indeed.  <br>Those are brooms.</br>  Did I miss something?

Free wasn't homobait too right?</br>  <br>Ha!</br>  <br> wouldn't of </br>  Shadow or see-through spats?  <br>Kill la Kill was good and Ninja Slayer is fun. Inou was a meh adaption of a meh source. Most of Triggers work is at least above average at the very least which is more than you can say for most studios.</br>  It feels almost like a TV show rather than another movie. In a good way though. It feels comfy rather than grandoise.  <br>anon hes probably not good enough for nvidia</br>    <br>She does know there's a patent on this kind of thing, right?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8tab<wbr>9C3GW3U</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> witches <br> not sluts <br>None of them wear panties.</br></br></br>  <br>This.

I haven't been keeping up with it but I last recall there being disputes amongst the creative teams. I'm keeping hype to a minimum, even after Trigger fulfilled expectations of a Kickstarter anime.<br><br>There was KickHeart as well... anything else from KS?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At first worried that the 3 new characters would steal precious time from the 3 mains <br> After watching it now I'm sad that there wasn't more.  <br><br>that was a fun time. Bravo trigger.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>A proper reaction to all these delicious underage thighs.</br></br>    <br>Tim Schafer. RIP Spacebase.</br>  <br>Shota-Tattun.</br>   LWA The Enchanted Parade - 01 <br><br> 01  <br><br>So... there will be a second "episode" coming, right?<br><br>Right?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like she's straight out of adventure time or Steven Universe. Design wise i mean.</br>  <br>Trigger's already said they aren't planning any more LWA.</br>  That part in Trigger's email to the backers about "still finishing up the anime as I type this", I think Yoshinari is cracking the whip over the animators' heads to fix some scenes. The part where the Giant falls back to sleep and the civilians climb all over it was pretty QUALITY. Hopefully they fix that for the BDs, though. I wonder if we'll get another Making Of documentary?  <br> anything else from KS? <br>There was that under the dog thing from some nobody, in the end he took the money and ran, which is what anybody stupid enough to back that thing deserved.</br></br>  That was pretty nice.  <br>What, citation or bullshit.</br>    <br>Not anytime soon, anyway. They'll probably wait until the numbers come in for BD sales. Wish they'd make another movie, I don't care if it takes another two-three years.</br>  Looks like they had international help for sound (Russia and Paris).

It was bothering me what it looked like. Kept coming back to Scott Pilgrim, but that wasn't right.</br>  <br>Just play Deathsmiles</br>  <br><br> Otsuka has stated that if the sequel performs well, they may potentially look into producing a television series or full-length film. </br></br>  <br> 1.5 million for a full TV series <br>That's nowhere near enough</br></br>  I TOLD YOU DIANA<br><br>I TOLD YOU THOSE KIDS ARE IRREDEEMABLY EVIL AND PERSECUTORS OF WITCHES<br><br>THAT'S WHAT YOU GET FOR RESCUING ONE OF THEM</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm still convinced they blew the majority of their budget on episode one. <br><br>They had to have. When you have scenes like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uhm<wbr>BnaEcbfA</wbr>  [ ] ? There's no way.</br></br></br>  <br>In the first one i believe they mention that there's ley lines and that the school is just situated on a nexus of them and the stone just sort of acts to contain a large part of that energy. so presumably their powers work best near ley lines and their intersecting nodes. I'd assume the stone acts like a large battery so that there's a constant large supply of magic for all the students to use in their training. <br><br>I dunno.</br></br></br>  <br>What si with the tiny mayor?</br>  That was great. I'm really looking forward to Trigger's next fully animated TV project.   The sequel was just as good as the first one <br>based trigger</br>  Sticky. <br><br>Why?</br></br>  Sup  <br>There was a sticky for the Kickstarter way back when. A LOT of people here backed it.</br>  <br>Because /a/ largely funded it.</br>  <br>Because the mod didn't want dozens of threads in the catalog again. We also had three stickies for the Kickstarter back-to-back  two were unnecessary  so it's probably the same mod, I guess.</br>  <br><br>I wonder how you retards imagine turning money into animation. A vending machine dispensing key frames? <br>First episode looked good because they actually had time to finish it beforehand, further along their schedule collapsed because Umetsu and everyone else involved in the production are incompetent.</br></br></br>  <br>Because it's one of those magical times where /a/ actually agreed on something</br>  /ss/?  <br><br>They could add something in similar to how other fantasy universes do it (If they ever expanded their universe).<br><br>The more experience you get as a mage, the more mana you can hold. Or they could be given things similar to what the MC has that hold exponentially more mana/magic.<br><br>I think it actually could make for a more interesting story. I've always like the lore where mages can't just shit out spells, but actually have to draw it from a souce.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would only end up as an even more budget KlK. I just threw up a little typing that.</br>  <br>I forgot Inflation. My bad.<br>Let's say 2.2 million to be safe.</br></br>  Posting in a sticky   LWA get sticky <br> LOGH anime and novel being licensed didn't </br>  <br>Checked</br>  <br>It also help make sense of why the rest of the world has progressed mostly along the lines of modern technology and magic is seen as a backwards curiosity.</br>  <br>Because anime was finally saved.</br>  <br>Who the fuck cares about it being licensed?

It's not even western enough. It's more of a mix of both.<br>We like Japanese anime and manga, but we aren't all wapanese here, you know.</br></br>  I'm actually a bit upset now because Mandy was so great and now we'll never see more of her.  <br>People not liking LWA2 is a strong overreaction that is always mandatory when a large amount of people are hyped over something.<br><br>They will whine and whine about it because they can't stand people being happy.<br><br>This has happened with every show that generated large amounts of hype.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lets make TWELVE kickstarters! Lets do it!</br></br>  <br>I cannot comprehend people not liking it</br>   For the second time a "big bad" gets BTFO by Shiny Chariot move <br><br>How was Shiny Chariot not OP as fuck? No one seems to respect her, but she had the most OP as fuck wand, constantly took on huge "ancient" bullshit.<br><br>The power levels in this anime make no fucking sense.</br></br></br></br>   you try to fuck a slavshit <br> she farts and kills your boner </br>  <br>Yes anon. You should be able to buy it.</br>  <br>Because they didn't backed up the kickstarter</br>  <br>SUCY Best magical Egyptian dancer.</br>  <br>But that is Atleir.<br><br>Did you think the potions and food and bombs you make in Atleir can't be used in combat?</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe the Mahou community excommunicated her and pulled a pic-related.<br><br>Didn't work out as well as it hoped, though.</br></br></br>  <br>She put on flashy shows for Muggles which was frowned upon by the witching community. Notice how most of the teachers at the academy are No Fun Allowed types and Diana, who is from a noble house of witches or something, also disdains frivolity.</br>  The orgy that followed will be in the BD right?  So what big overarching plot for LWA is possible?<br><br>More Ancient Evil Awakens?</br></br>  Well damn that came out quicker than I expected.<br>I thought it would still have so many delays.<br><br>Those you of who are disappointed judging by budget are forgetting kickstarter is an investment system, you are investing money into the company not buying a product.<br><br>You are investing in not just LWA2 but everything the company offers, it would not be unreasonable for the some of the budget to be used on things like KLK, of course they need the majority of it for LWA2 plus any merch they produce.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Disney movies cannot show orgies.</br>  <br> boys <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>flashy shows apparently double as boss-finishing moves</br>  <br>akko becomes the new shiny chariot that's it</br>  <br>Akko needs to pass or she'll be put back a year!</br>  <br><br>It's not necessary when they all can grow futa dicks anyway.</br></br>  How much money did they get from the kickstarter to make this?<br>It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime.</br>  <br> you are investing money into the company not buying a product. <br>Except you aren't. Unless if you think you are investing in Nike by buying a pair of sneakers.</br></br>  <br> /x/ </br>  <br>I can see it being an episodic SoL-type thing. Some possible episodes are<br><br> Akko wants to get gud at broom flying and enlists her friends' help <br> Lotte enters a spell-singing competition <br> Sucy's potion goes horribly wrong and turns most of the school into zombies <br> Witch Knight comes to town <br> Amanda tries to pull off a heist but gets captured and Team Akko needs to rescue her <br> Diana has a Muggle fan club, which her family disapproves of </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean horny zombies.</br>  <br>The Kickstarter was only there to extend the lenght.<br><br>150.000 for 15 additional minutes. <br><br>A TV anime would be much more expensive because:<br><br>1) It would be much longer resulting into higher costs in every department<br>2) The whole thing needs far more management because you can't just put something on TV out of nothing<br>3) You don't do a TV show only for the sake of having a TV show - You need partners in many departments to get the best out of it<br><br>A TV anime that does LWA justice would probably cost a few millions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Doujins when?</br>  Other than the boys' gang, this was as good as the first one. And those fights, damn! So much background animation.  <br> It's beyond me that some studio won't fund this shit and make it a season anime. <br>The Japanese people don't give a shit about it and westeners don't buy BDs.</br></br>  Who's the biggest dyke this time now?  <br>Japan has shit taste, this is an established fact.</br>  <br>Diana always</br>  <br>Diana will keep being tsun to Akko until the point where Akko actually reaches her goal and becomes a witch worthy of Dianna's admiration.</br>  <br>Posting in a sticky.</br>  The magnet still works! Thanks anon!  <br>is this shit even good</br>  <br>More than a few, a few million would get you a pretty cheap looking TV show. Maybe 3 or 4 million though.</br>  Damn, that was way better than the first one. A 8/10 for me. Other than that annoying group of boys, the music, animation and overall just sealed it for me. Amanda and Lotte are best girls.<br><br>Also, GSC figures when? Maybe even Nendoroids.</br></br>  <br>Why would another studio fund a rival upcoming studio?<br>Studio Trigger is too new and ambitious, overtime they'll build up a better financial base and be able to do the things they want to do.<br><br>Not every studio started making what they make now, hell some of them were smaller than Trigger and just uni students.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Can't we just take the kickstarter budget, multiply it by 12 or make 12 of them and get a full season? <br><br>Is it not that simple?</br></br></br></br>  Fuck you, I ain't streaming this shit. Payers forced to pirate, good.  <br>Like Gainax you mean?</br>  <br>It's better for LWA to stay a OVA series or maybe extend into feature movie format.<br><br>Nobody would fund a TV show with this much quality. It would break everyones budget.</br></br></br>  The wallpaper makes a lot more sense now.  http://i.imgur.com/XfS1BQH.jpg  <br>You can.<br>But that would probably take 5-10 years to finish.</br></br>  <br><br>Just use JDownloader.

I'm not saying the show isn't kid-friendly, but to act like the staff didn't intend the characters to be cute and attractive to nerds is ridiculous. Fuck, even mainstream TV stuff really obviously marketed at kids tends to make sure to draw the characters in an attractive way to appeal to fanboys &amp; fangirls, so to expect Trigger to take that stance would be insane.<br><br>The "westaboo anime" stuff is wrong too. LWA is a million times more anime-esque than Panty &amp; Stocking, and Panty &amp; Stocking itself was far more anime-esque than people claim in spite of the colossal western cartoon influences.<br><br>It's true that Yoshinari is a "westaboo" in that he even worships stuff that English-speaking cartoon nerds don't give a fuck about like Atomic Betty, but LWA is not a "westaboo" work in itself at all. It simply uses principles associated with good ANIMATION in general; just because those animation principles first came about in the west and were written down by Disney doesn't mean they are "westaboo", as pretty much all well-animated anime with "cartoony" aesthetics use them. LWA itself is no more "westaboo" than FLCL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127572299 <br> You mean "no subs". <br>No, I mean too Japanese.

So where's the website where I can jerk over my name if I backed just 20 american euros?  <br>These designs are extremely anime-like; you won't find a western cartoon that looks like this unless it's directly influenced by anime. It's not "westaboo" it's just traditional anime aesthetics executed well.

I've watched LWA1 several dozen times, and I'll probably do the same with LWA2. The characters are so lovable and I want more of them. I also have a major weakness for witches.  I forgot she was the voice of Hime from Happiness Charge Precure. Now Akko sounds like Hime to me rather than Hime sounding like Akko.<br><br>I guess that's what happens when a show runs for an entire year VS. a single OVA</br></br>  <br> so he at least knows that he's not white <br>Animators only do line art, you know?</br></br>  Team Sushio  <br>This works because it's short and there was large pause between 1 and 2.<br>If this ends up normal 12+ anime series you'll get your usual load of QUALITY, cliches, filler and inane shit.</br></br>  <br>Do we need more though?

It showed preliminary designs of several school students as well as a verdant city in the sea, intersected with bridges. The staff members added that the project has yet to be announced in Japan. Because of that, they disallowed photographs of the art and could not take questions on the project from the audience. <br><br> Studio Trigger also showed an Inferno Cop short with a crossover with Little Witch Academia characters. The staff said that the short has yet to premiere in Japan. </br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Good point.</br>  <br>Recent comments from Trigger people along with the release of a Nishigori art book hint that it will probably be something that Nishigori will be in charge of, so I expect it to be competent but not particularly impressive. Nishigori is a skilled artist but he's not quite as good as people like Imaishi and Yoshinari, and his designs are only GREAT as opposed to merely good when they're simply finalized versions based upon endless concept sketches from Gainax/Trigger people, like Panty &amp; Stocking and Gurren Lagann's designs.<br><br>I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again, a more major project than Yucie.</br></br></br>  <br>Look, the color palettes aren't even consistent between scenes.<br>Obviously, they didn't do much pre-production planning on these characters.</br></br>  <br> I just want Masahiki Otsuka to direct something again <br>iktfb, I watch flcl like 4 times a year.</br></br>  <br><br>I think there will be a TV "remaster" of Ninja Slayer. I'm not sure what it will entail but I assume they'll just replace most of the Inferno Cop stuff with normal animation.</br></br>  <br>Mute loli mecha witch best new witch.</br>  <br>It reminded me that KLK was as great as LWA and that I love Trigger</br>  <br><br>She gives off such professional vibe.</br></br>  <br> It is fanservice for fans of western animation, though! <br>Yes because it was so uncannily similar to shitty flash animation. </br></br>  <br>What needs to happen now is a slice of life show starring all of Trigger's original characters living together and getting up to antics<br><br>I always wanted that from Gainax</br></br></br>  <br>LWA3 When</br>  <br>That makes no sense. The Inferno Cop stuff is the only point of Ninja Slayer.</br>  <br>You're right, but once again: if the short fat man was meant to be Ian J then Hori kinda fucked up because he doesn't actually look like Ian J in the least beyond being chubby and having what Hori probably sees as "black man lips".<br><br>But yeah, it was probably just something he added in of his own accord and it wasn't any "GUYS LET'S ADD STEVEN UNIVERSE STUFF" talk he had with the staff. See also that Connie lookalike being light-skinned and Mabel and Dipper's colors being totally off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd be fine with a daicon-esque music video featuring all their characters.</br>  I wish the western animation industry wasn't irredeemably shit.  <br>That has nothing to do with /pol/ though.<br>JADF = Just Another DrawFag<br><br>You might be confusing it with JIDF.</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Because the people who worked on LWA are people from the Japanese anime industry.</br>  <br> I always wanted that from Gainax <br>That would end up looking like Kappa Mikey between all the different art styles</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> When an American studio tries to copy animu, like Avatar and Korra, it still goes on /co/. Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>You know, I see a pattern in there.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anon do you realize your example goes against your point</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br> Why then, is an anime studio copying shitty cartoons still accepted on /a/? <br>For the same reason Avatar and Korra belong on /co/? I'm not really following you here.</br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be pissed as fuck if the new show will have the same schedule/budget problem KLK had.<br>A third of the episode were almost unwatchable.<br>I hope by now they have their shit together.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it was better than the first.</br>  <br>Otsuka wasn't the series director of FLCL but he directed like 3 out of 6 episodes. He wrote both LWAs and his input on Gurren Lagann was similarly important (he directed some of the best, most important episodes) but he is practically never, ever talked about. <br><br>The man strikes me as a "silent protector" of sorts for Trigger &amp; Gainax projects. No one even notices him but I'm sure a lot of the qualities of things that people consider classics while attributing entirely to people like Tsurumaki or Imaishi were Otsuka's doing.<br><br>I mean, the guy directed Gurren episode 8, the episode that made /a/ go fucking nuts when it aired.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah dude that would be to simple.

Korra and Avatar are still /co/ because the mindset is cartoon. It doesn't matter that they had actual Japanese studios, and sweatshops full of dirty Koreans working on them.<br><br>That's not what makes anime, anime. Trigger is no different. It's an Americanized studio full of westaboos, which is even worse than an American studio full of weeaboos.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  full fledged anime series when  The mugshots of the new girls made me think of that Psycho Pass ED.    <br>Hopefully never.</br>  fuck this was too perfect, i loved it.  <br>Subcontracting things doesn't make American cartoons anime.<br><br>Meanwhile, LWA and Panty&amp;Stocking are anime. You mad?</br></br></br>  <br>So much pout and grumpiness.</br>  <br>What makes anime anime is that they're made and produced by Japanese studios<br><br>Korra isn't that, regardless of how it looks, and anything Gainax or Trigger makes is that, also regardless of how it looks.<br><br>"Anime" isn't the design or how many archetypal characters a show has. If you watched enough anime you'd realise that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is nothing "Americanized" about LWA. It's a very well-made anime. The problem is you've associated actual good character designs and animation as "western", and you think anime is defined by being generic shit.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are none of you bringing up the fact that LWA is extremely anime-like? The designs are anime as fuck, it's just appealingly-drawn anime. The standards of cartoon "appeal" were defined by Americans, but ALL good-looking anime use them. LWA is no more "westaboo" than FLCL; both have western media references but both are largely very anime-like.<br><br>Yoshinari is also a huge fan of Osamu Tezuka; people also say Tezuka works are "western cartoon style" but they're not, they took western influences but utilized them in a uniquely Japanese way. In fact, Tezuka style is the purest form of the "traditional anime" aesthetic and the best-looking "traditional anime" is made by people who understand what Tezuka created on a deeper level than the average artist.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127574574 <br>Anime and American animation are so far apart from each other that they have almost nothing in common. All LWA has is some vague stylistic similarities, probably in the character design, and that's it. It's nowhere near enough to bridge the gap between the two.<br><br>But I guess to some people (read: clueless newbies) anime is defined by pantyshots and power levels.</br></br></br>  <br>Anime isn't a genre. Welcome to /a/.</br>  Stop responding to the dumbass who's been trying forever to convince people to accept his retarded definition of "anime," and that the hundreds of people on /a/ who funded the show back when it had a sticky are secretly crossboarding /co/-scum.  <br>my thoughts exactly, I normally really like that type of character but it was too much</br>  <br>So Studio Pierrot isn't Japanese now?

Sorry.</br>  <br><br>Fucking hivemind, man.<br><br>But yeah the "westaboo" stuff is silly, Yoshinari being more into American cartoons than the average Japanese creator notwithstanding. LWA is a very anime-like work and there's no reason beyond pretentiousness to see it as something that goes "beyond anime" and becomes "something greater". It's simply good anime.<br><br>Panty &amp; Stocking was an overt American cartoon tribute and far more western-styled than LWA but it was still anime as fuck. It was full of Kanada-style animation which is basically the most Japanese form of animation imaginable along with use of anime-like perspective and expressions and countless other things.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    It was fine I guess, I'm really biased against disney cliches though.  <br>Isn't it a shitty vimeo link?<br>Since Kikestarter got hacked I deleted my account so I don't know.

Tezuka may have taken Bambi's eyes, but his overall style is not at all like that of Bambi. He was more overtly influenced by Carl Barks' Donald Duck comics, but that's only part of it. Fleischer animation clearly played a colossal part, at least their early work from before they tried to rip off Looney Tunes and Disney; he liked Popeye so much that he inserted him in his Monkey King manga.<br><br>Yoshinari's "normal anime" art looks so fucking appealing and good because he understands the foundation of the aesthetic.

Character design, animation style (and quality), backgrounds, music, sound design, voice acting, stories, direction, editing, visual language, cultural sensibilities, character archetypes... at best LWA bears some vague resemblance to some American animation on a superficial level.<br><br>I'm guessing you're really new to anime and have a very superficial, cliche-driven understanding of it. Either that or you're a shill.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks for reminding me /a/, LWA e-mail is apparently spam.</br>  <br>Tattun and at least Wakabayashi went to Pixar for multiple days before the con.<br><br>They almost certainly are doing something for them.</br></br></br>  <br> Inferno Cop will never get a 1080p BD release with smooth 60FPS animation </br>   <br> I cannot refute this claim because I know nothing about what LWA originates from! <br>Thanks for continuously showing how little you know about anime.

While posing as a fan.<br><br> It's a rip-off because it's a poor clone that brings nothing new to the table. <br>A clone of what?</br></br></br></br>  There's something very wrong about this frame. It's like I'm not even watching anime.   Trigger announces new project <br>   Aerial Girls </br>  <br> They inevitably fight each other <br> Which culminates on them realizing something <br> That they want hot steamy kisses from each other while holding hands </br></br></br>  <br> Everyone here is from Leddit <br><br>Yeah, no, faggot.</br></br></br>  <br>Akko breaks a leg and her friends try to cheer her up for roughly 40 minutes of screentime.</br>  <br>That Famicon.</br>  <br><br>Anime cuteness is very different from western cartoon cuteness and comparing LWA to 90s Disney style is the most surface-level and shallow thing.<br><br>Look at how Tezuka drew a 'cute cartoon bunny girl' design vs. how a Disney film did it. Anime cuteness is far more focused on the bare impression than the details. Takashi Murakami (I think) once made the point that a cartoon cat in the west is "a drawing of a cat", while Japan's Hello Kitty feels like "a drawing of a drawing of a cat". That's a fantastic way of wording it.</br></br></br></br>   <br>Nothing new about anime's magical skirts.</br>  <br> &gt;A clone of what? <br>The standard children's movie plot progression.<br><br>If you were entertained for even a second during this episode, you have the mental capacity of a 5 year old. When you can literally predict every single scene, how is that not a derivative clone?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm trying to find the tweet, not this one, but Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project.</br>  <br> Patrick Robert Steward </br>  <br>finally some good news, maybe i will not kill myself afterall</br>  <br> Bambi Bunny <br><br>Thanks Disney for creating a generation of furfags.</br></br></br>  <br><br>The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures; that is to say, what they teach in american and japanese animation curriculums are wholly the same. You cant say its a cartoon just because it looks like a cartoon- when both are inherently the same fucking thing. Good examples of animation from either cultures would tend to reach a middle point, where they are indistinguishable from each other- apart from deliberate stylistic choices.</br></br>  <br>Stay strong, bro. We all have to hold out until we get mandy doujins.</br>  This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. But it's still anime.  <br> Grant seemed to imply it's some sort of a personal project <br>Probably some feature-length film with both 3D and 2D animation.</br></br>  <br><br>It really depends if the anime is echhi or not. If it's not echii, magical skirts are an automatic thing and you will never see what's underneath.</br></br>  <br>She's not getting brutally fucked by old men.</br>  <br>why does she look so familiar<br>also best witch</br></br>  <br>Just like Korra, amirite?<br><br><br>I don't know why you're making this about the animation. My whole argument stems from the fact that animation style doesn't make anime anime, otherwise Korra would be anime.<br><br>It's the thematic elements. The direction style. The utterly bland story telling.</br></br></br></br></br></br>     Total times episode has been viewed on Vimeo: 2,320 <br> Seeds on Horriblesubs: 3,034 </br>  Figures when?  kill la kill had me worried about lwa2 but its seems it turned out great.  <br>i was pissed at her being selfish and not apologizing to her two friends expecting everything to be okay once she finishes her damn project. The fuck kind of moral story is that ?<br><br>" It's okay if you fight with your friends even if you don't apologize as long as you do something cool they'll be your friends again. "</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what sort of faggots bother seeding?</br>  <br>It's something you see constantly in western cartoons and children's movies.</br>  <br>When you say it's a clone you mean it's a clone of a specific work. But since you don't mean that, why are you calling it a clone? It isn't one. Using predictable, "standard" storytelling doesn't make it a clone of anything. There's also nothing wrong with being predictable. LWA2 is good because of the story's execution, the characters, the animation, the music and so on.<br><br>You're the type of person who always wants novelty for novelty's sake and who thinks the only thing that ever matters in any sort of fiction is the plot. And how novel it is. In short you're a moron.<br><br><br> The fundamentals of animation is still the same in both western/eastern cultures <br>Maybe at the most basic of basic levels, but beyond that they're nothing alike. And Western countries are hardly even producing hand-drawn animation anymore anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tezuka's bunny girl is 100x cuter though. Chances are Yoshinari would agree.</br>  <br>It's also something you constantly see... everywhere.</br>  <br>Tezuka was such a furfag...</br>  <br/>  So did this movie get a song this time?  <br><br><br>Nigga please, panty shot was a Ghibli classic, the anime doesn't have to be ecchi at all, look at this diabetes shit from Ghibli-wannabe.<br>Fuck Trigger for not giving me the due panties.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They do OST</br>  <br>Ghibli girls aren't sexualized.<br>It's ok to show their panties.</br></br>  I quite like how there's a lot of British details that aren't in your face, I mean besides Akko parachuting with the Union Flag. I wouldn't expect anyone from Japan to know what a Punch and Judy stand is.<br><br>I've noticed Jasmineka eating Kettle Chips, Walkers Crisps and Skips.</br></br>  <br> LWA2 is good because of the story's execution,  <br>Utterly formulaic, to an insane degree.<br> the characters, <br>Totally one dimensional, no real development.<br> the animation,  <br>Not as good as the movie, an insult for the money.<br> the music  <br>I can't remember a single track.<br><br>I liked LWA1. Not a huge amount, but I could see some value there. LWA2 was trash.<br><br>I'm very sorry that I'm over the age of 5, and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. Watching the same thing, over and over, that's what autists and children like. It really wouldn't have taken much. A single second that wasn't totally paint-by-numbers, and phoned in.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> This is pure 1990's Warner Brothers style from start to finish. <br>How is this even particularly similar to Tiny Toons/Animaniacs/whatever, let alone "purely" that style?<br><br>Are you making the comparison because the animation reminds you of the TMS episodes of those shows? Those were animated in Japan, you know.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Ghibli girls aren't sexualized. <br>Not with that attitude</br></br>  <br>Also, Shaun of the Dead</br>  tfw the west will never go back to doing hand drawn animation<br><br>Why must Japan be the only country left with an appreciation for animation? <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/yZibUpH-AME?t=5m22<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>france still draws their stuff I think.</br>  <br> and I like my entertainment to include a splash of something new. <br>So you don't watch anime at all?</br></br>  So glad I backed this.  <br>Face it, it'll never revive to its former glory days. If it weren't for the widespread popularity of manga and the otaku fanbase, Japan would have also stopped giving a shit about 2d animation.</br>  <br>Because the Japanese are the only ones who can draw so well in such a large scale.<br><br>The West is divided into too few individuals.<br>The 3D favoritism and "easy-way-out" Flash style animation isn't helping either.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That shota's got a fat ass.</br>  <br>Tezuka was not involved with any incarnation of "furry fandom". Liking cute appealing cartoon design shouldn't amount to being associated with furry culture and "furry" is not a sexual orientation.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The fuck are you all arguing about?

Really, I'm not that fussy about what constitutes "new", a slightly different mix of archetypes sat round a table is enough to make it fresh.<br><br>But LWA2?

Will die before he gets any saving done.</br>  <br>Showing the back is different from showing the front.</br>  I was kind of hoping lwa2 would look into making diana and akko friends but they still seem to maintain the status quo.  <br><br>A friend of mine spent some time as a kindergarten teacher. He showed them some animated films; the 5 year olds there called golden-age Disney stuff "badly drawn" and only liked 3DCG.<br><br>I used to think that such a thing couldn't happen and that 2D will remain inherently appealing, but....</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it's really hot, to be honest. You can't even really notice the butt shot when watching it normally, but the fact that they included that small glimpse of Akko ass really gets me going.</br>  <br>Your obsession with labelling anyone who disagrees with you as a child gives the impression you're somewhat insecure in your own maturity. Not every plot has to be deeply intellectual, and adults can enjoy simple storylines too. I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one.</br>  <br>Good, good. In that case, yes. It's far better than KLK.</br>  <br> black void <br>Fix your monitor settings.</br></br>  <br> black void <br>It's just shading.</br></br>  <br>Surely you're not gonna say  isn't sexualized fanservice, right?</br>  <br>Good taste.</br>  What's with the dramatic brooding Batman-esque score over the end credits?  <br>you should have linked <br><br><br>He COULD say "oh no, they didn't mean it to be sexual" it if not for Trigger being obvious perverts, Yoshinari drawing official LWA art with a focus on Akko's butt and one of the animators drawing suggestive Akko x Sucy yuri.<br><br>They obviously want to give LWA a more innocent feeling but it's not like they don't want male nerds watching it. The manga ran in a seinen magazine.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's pretty slow for a sticky if you ask me.</br>  <br> I'd hazard a guess that not one person went into LWA2 expecting any ending other than Akko and team coming together to beat the bad guy, but that doesn't necessarily make the experience a bad one. <br>You don't seem to get my point. When I watch some cute girls shit, I'm pretty confidant that at the end nothing will have really changed and we'll be back to the status quo.<br><br>In LWA2, EVERY SCENE is like that. I don't know if Chinatsu is going to pour herself some tea or not, but I can literally predict every single event in LWA2 with pinpoint accuracy. It's like watching something you've already seen, and know all the lines to.

If you were unfamiliar with that kind of stuff then I understand you missing it, but it's super Japanese and really blatant.</br>  There are VIDEOGAMES made out of MAGIC in this world, I need me some of that.  <br> then the teacher did the whole Japanese live stage thing where she calls things out for the audience. <br>no. that's not what she did. She was pretending that it was all part of the show.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's a bit dissapointing. At least it's still totally something you could show to your daughter.</br>  <br><br> trigger never release sheet music. <br><br>I guess I could transcribe it myself i guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what he said.</br>  <br>You are a pretentious poser. You want "innovative" stories and "deep" characters just so you can tell everyone you're engaged in profoundly intellectual artistic pursuits and not merely entertaining yourself like some commoner. It's all just an act, and your actual knowledge of and interest in movies/other fiction is skin deep.<br><br>Anyone who isn't a pretentious poser will tell you that while LWA2 doesn't have an original, unpredictable story is it nevertheless well-executed and entertaining for what it is. They would also realize that it isn't supposed to be some deep character study and psychological drama, and would hardly even have any time for that. The characters are likable not because of some childhood trauma, moral dilemma or philosophical babble but because of their basic characterization, design and animation. I don't know if Constantze even had any lines, but she's an immediately likable character.<br><br>And then there's the animation and presentation in general which are really nice too. But of course they don't have any "deep" "meaning" to them so who cares right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy my 3D anime with games and MMD videos, but when I watch shows entirely made out of animation, I expect drawn animation because I honestly see it as superior and more appealing.</br>  okay that shitty brat and his tomato hijinks better be a one time thing. Everything was going good till that pile of shit showed up. Trigger better leave this series as a girl only cast.

I would like to see him be Assistant Director for a Yoshinari TV series. If the new TV original is by Nishigori, I doubt Otsuka would be able to add much as Nishigori takes on a lot of work and usually has a clear vision.</br></br></br>  <br>Santa Company<br><br>The BD authoring is so ghetto it's funny.</br></br></br>  <br>why can't /u/ never enjoy anything if a show doesn't pander to them at 100 %? <br> Well, I forgot they are all manchildren </br></br>  <br>Time of Eve international release was kickstarted.

I don't know moon either. <br><br> I guess it's fine since I'm more interested in writing literature I can be proud of, but having grown up watching anime, I would still love to see something I write get animated. <br><br> Never gonna happen though. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br> sharing credits with huke <br><br>I'm happy about this, even if it is just an imposter or similar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thom Moore in Ireland still does sexy animation.</br>  Why a sticky? It's not like we get a sticky for other anime announcements? Some serious favoritism going on here. Also this anime is extremely vapid and only notable for its low detail stretchy animation.  <br>japan doesn't acknowledge the existence of africa.<br>barely anyone does, unless you need a place to sell weapons or something.</br></br>  <br><br>Featuring Ignatius Reilly as the head wizard.</br></br>  <br>Anon I'd be fine if they added hetero love story in this, but anyone but that Shitty Brat. For Fucks sake his character design is shit, and it doesn't help that he's annoying and a prick.</br>  <br> It's not like we get a sticky for other anime announcements? <br>we do , <br>the earliest one I can remember was the sticky for ippo 2nd season back around 2007</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying you cant do it yourself on youtube </br></br>   6/25/2015 <br><br>How did this guy know?

And Hajime no Ippo is fucking terrible.</br>  <br>I don't really draw anymore though. And none of my friends and people I know are interested in being creative.</br>  <br>This.

It felt a little short, but it's the first part I've read (as opposed to watching) The final fight with Kira and Killer Queen was pretty good, but I also liked the fight with Rohan and Cheap Trick. At the end of the part, theres a bit where it mentions that Joseph "gets better" or something along those lines, does that mean that when he reappears later in the series that he's not a senile old fart anymore?  <br>He doesn't reappear, but he's brightened up a little. Doesn't mean he's better, just that he's less dull.</br>  Jesus christ it's horrible https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Lgh<wbr>g0-H1-CM</wbr>  [ ]<br>Dio is the best one and even then he's OKAY.</br>  <br>Well we used to discuss jojo when the anime was still going because it was relevant and now that it's over there's a big hole in our hearts that needs to be filled somehow, so we attempt to do so by shitposting on a chinese image board about homosexual men fighting with ghosts in the hope that some day part 4 is animated<br><br>also the dub was announced so i guess there's some relevance(?)</br></br></br>  <br>WHY<br>why<br>wHy</br></br></br>  <br>if you've seen any of the dub videos posted in this thread then you'd know how little relevance the dub will have</br>  Just caught up today to the manga.<br>7&gt;6&gt;4&gt;2&gt;5&gt;1&gt;3<br>I'm excluding part 8 but it'll probably be better than 7 in the end</br></br>  <br>Speedweed isounds crap and does not have enough vigour.</br>  <br> part 7 and 6 that high. <br>Good taste.

The test dub for Stardust Crusaders was actually pretty good, what the hell happened here?</br></br></br>  <br>It's the fake accents.

Isn't Jojo really popular?</br>  <br>yeah but on the other side of the world.</br>  <br>To talk about JoJo, you fucking mong.</br>  Does the Part 5 hate stem from it being a "bad" part or just because it is a bad piece of work?<br><br>It was pretty irrelevant but still enjoyable.</br></br>  <br>Shit translation makes it a dull read. <br>People rate it badly because of that, but it's unfair really because the translation makes it up so most people haven't actually read Part 5. <br><br><br>It's worth noting that the only place that doesn't really rate Part 5 as a great part is the Anglosphere.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Factors could be the shitty scans, the shitty translations (much worse than Duwang as they completely change the sentence/context) and having a lack-cluster protagonist where the side characters have more of an impact than Giorno.</br>  <br>It's BuBu's Crazy Journey and that makes it great. A lot of Giorno's personality is lost on translation though.</br>  <br>the coloring on this pic is weird. it's like somebody gave valentine a full-body skin graft made out of taints/ham</br>  <br> worse than duwang <br>haha no, duwang is funny but in actual terms of quality part 5's is WAY better</br></br>  <br>It was enjoyable, yes. but it just wasn't as good, the villain was uninteresting, the cast was boring and Giorno was an emotionless brick (I did enjoy watching him destroy stand users though)</br>  <br>No, it really isn't. It's better English but it's not accurately translated. Not really close to it. <br><br>Duwang is poor English but it is accurately translated.</br></br></br>  <br>wait, that was who played Jonathan?</br>  so i finished part4 a couple of days, what can i expect from here on?<br>part 4 ended up being a lot better than part 3 and that took me by surprise (haven't watch the anime yet, not sure if want to even) given how it was the most popular or something.<br>i've kind of spoiled myself a bit so i kind of want to jump to part 6 or something like that.</br></br>  <br> d of spoiled myself a bit so i kind of want to jum <br>Read part 5, it's not as good as part 4 buy you can't just skip 100+ chapters</br></br>  <br>Don't skip parts</br>  Vanilla Ice's voice actor is so fucking based<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2BS<wbr>fm0fDeLc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>also, who saved baby josuke in the snowstorm?<br><br><br>o-ok, i guess i'll start now then.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can fap listening to this all day long, too bad they're not gonna use him for Pucci.</br>  color scans or original black and white?  <br>There are some questions that are (probably) intentionally not answered like, as you said, who saved Josuke and also if the self proclaimed alien is actually an alien.</br>  <br> Josefumi  saved him</br>  <br>Shit ending. I thought GER was going to be where the final battle began, not ended.</br>  <br>Double dubs can't lie</br>  <br>the alien was probably an alien, it's part of his schtick and ultimately doesn't matter but that guy that saved josuke sounded like a plot device that simply wasn't used at all. it felt really odd in retrospective.</br>  <br>I will never not think that he was in fact supposed to go back in time and save himself, but when Araki actually got to Bites the Dust he decided not to give him full control of time.</br>  <br>yeah, i assumed at the moment that time shenanigans were involved but then loljustsomerandomdude.</br>  <br>If the Crazy Diamond Requiem exist, he could break the universe and rebuild it in a way that none of these plotholes exist</br>  <br>Black and white all day.</br>  <br>BANIRA ICU?</br>  kira did 09/11  <br>kira did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>9/11 happened after He died</br>  <br>Has no weakness</br>  <br>How many times did he have to use Bites the Dust to kill that many in one go</br>  <br>Killer Queen Can't Melt Crazy Diamonds</br>  <br>So i just finished Battle Tendency, i liked it quite a bit.

That doesn't explain why Hot Pants would be after them, since the Vatican has no reason to care about diamonds like it does Jesus' corpse</br>  <br> It definitely had a lot more effort <br> Nobody ever said Jotaro Kujo is a nice guy <br>My pen0r</br></br></br>  I really don't get why you people like part 4 so much. Don't get me wrong I love every part but 1, 5 and 6 are heavily underrated. The best thing about jojo is the variety.  <br> JoJo's Bizarre Adventure is some lighthearted shounen manga <br> there's only Part 3 <br> Diavolo is just another form of Dio <br> Dr. Ferdinand is SBR's main antagonist and is basically Dr. Moreau </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, I also thought that about Diavolo</br>  <br>1 is my favorite part. It's short, concise, the mansion fight is awesome, and the ending is awesome.</br>  <br>It's good, yes, but not as good as the other parts. Only part 1 is worse than part 6.</br>  <br>I was a Part IV fag until VII and I think it has a lot to do with translations and resetting the Universe. A lot more people would like V if the translations were good.</br>  <br>And part 5. And Part 8. And Part 3.</br>  <br>I thought Dio was a minor villain that worked for Jack the Ripper and was only really popular because of the road roller attack.<br><br>All because of a weird synopsis I read a fuckload of years ago when my grasp of English was average at best.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, there are parts with the faulty translation that just sucked the life out of the party.<br><br>I did like the ending though, and Sleeping Slaves made up for the lackluster ending.</br></br></br>  <br>Before reading Stardust Crusaders:<br> I thought Polnareff was a brutish Russian ally that would be killed off rather early <br> I thought Jonathan would have been briefly brought back to life through Dio magic vampire blood bullshit <br> I thought Girl Nukesaku was a girl Stand User who was trying to pass as a regular civilian in the middle of the street <br> I thought Holly would overcome her Stand by herself and join the final fight for one last asskick </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, no and no.<br><br>Part 6 is the 2nd worst part.</br></br></br>  <br>I never played HttF.<br>I only knew about JJBA from hearing people mention it on 4chan.<br><br>For the longest time I thought Jojo was probably a happy, cheery 14-year old shonen protagonist with super powers. The average shonen protag, if you will. I didn't know who any of the actual Jojos were.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A few things, I didn't really think about the series before reading it.<br><br> There was one Jojo who was quasi-immortal <br> Stands are based on songs in-universe  <br> Stands have powers based on songs <br> Dio never dies and is the villain of each part <br> It was a questing manga </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Josuke </br>  <br>To be pure cancer</br>  <br>I mean more of a "loves to eat and very nice to everyone be they good or bad until they cross the line" Gokuffyruto type.</br>  <br>I thought Jojo was like a BILLION chapters long. The generational thing made me think the manga's been going on for longer than I thought it was.</br>  <br><br>Nothing important happens in part 5 other than finding out what happens to polnereff though</br></br>  <br>Skipping parts is for faggots</br>  To anyone who doesn't intend on playing the 7th stand user I've finished it enough times to piece together the plot.<br><br>Made in Heaven causes the universe to restart endlessly.<br>Weather Report's mother Vins has the stand power to observe time making her realise its looping.<br>Also she used the stone mask.<br>She intends to create Heaven before Pucci in order to fix time.<br>She doesn't know how but knows Dio wrote it in his diary.<br>To find out she intends to send an agent to it to read it for her but it has to be someone who has existed in some form in every timeline, the ‚Äúseventh stand user‚Äù.<br>In other timelines she would get her servant Steel to convince the seventh stand user to join the stardust Crusaders so she can get to Dio's diary but she sees they always turn on her.<br>Instead she finds them and murders them then gets Pucci to go to Japan and trap Josuke's stand inside a disk before giving it to her.<br>She gets a stand user who can bring back the dead by killing others to fill the corpse of the seventh stand user with souls until life returns to it<br>She gets another stand user who can reshape someone's body to completely change the living corpse into Josuke then she uses the stand disk to give them Crazy Diamond before leaving them in the care of Steel who gathers info on nearby stand users to ensure they won't be drawn to the josuke corpse and destroy it.<br>Kira notices Steel gathering notes on him and follows him back to his house. Steel hides Josuke and uses his stand to place his own soul in a walkman before Kira blows through the door and kills him.<br>Steel tells Josuke he was sent back in time and the only way to get back to 1999 is to kill Dio, when he does Steel tells him he must also destroy the diary and kill Vins.<br>Vins appears in Dio's basement and tries to manipulate him into reading the diary but Josuke burns it and kills her then Steel tells him he lied, Steel just wanted another shot at life.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i would welcome the knives. they are my girlfriends now</br>  <br>Exactly. Dio realising in disbelief that Johnathan has died is one of my favorite scenes.<br><br>I admit I read the good translation of part 5. However part 6 doesn't deserve all the hate it gets, Joyline is probably the best female MC I've ever seen and her character development is second only to part 7 and 8. The ending also makes perfect sense, Dio's dreams finally comes true, even if for a short while. Not to mention the fact the Araki has ball to do something like that in a shonen.<br>Part 5 and 6 aren't worse than Josuke's SOL adventures, just different and way more serious.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jonathan doesn't even know how it's all going to turn out.<br>For him, his very last view of things are his wife, a baby, him, and Dio are on a ship about to explode.<br>And all he has is the hope that she'll make it out.</br></br></br>  <br>Anyone got a link to /a/'s reaction when these first got posted? I wanna see the despair</br>  Is Pet Shop a part of Dio?<br><br>He has Dio's freezing ability after all</br></br>  <br> I thought Jotaro summoned the ghost of Jonathan to fight for him. <br> I thought Polnereff was going to be related to Strolhiem. <br> I thought Sandman was going to be a main ally against Valentine. </br></br></br>  <br>I thought Part 1 was Stardust Crusaders and though Jonathan was gonna wear Jotaro's clothes while traveling the world and go after Dio<br><br>Probably more, but my mind repressed dumb stuff I make up</br></br></br>    <br>I thought each Part was going to be pretty much a new version of the group from Part 1.<br><br>A Jojo, a Speedwagon, and a Zeppeli, always.</br></br></br>  <br> i thought JoJo was some kind of yaoi <br><br>you know, muscular men posing and etc<br><br>at the time, I didnt know what to expect from Japan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's some Jorge Joestar tier shit right there. So did time get fixed or not? I'm assuming it didn't since Vins is defeated in the end.</br>  <br> Is Yukako a part of Bruford? <br> She has Bruford's hair manipulation ability after all </br></br>  <br>No. You can do a lot of stuff to change the endings but you can't stop time from resetting because Pucci is responsible for the time resets and he isn't in the game for you to stop.</br>  <br>Fuck, the lore of this game is depressing. I just wish it wasn't a game, there's so much cool stuff but the gameplay itself is soulless.</br>  <br>If araki was thinking about freezing powers, why didn't he make dio use them instead of a pet?</br>  <br> Bruford was a Stand User </br>  <br> that start of series Giorno <br><br>I don't know why, but after finishing each part and looking back at the start of the part, the main protag's for each part always look so unsettling and weird<br><br>Araki's art style changes so rapidly that even after only 2 characters look wildly different</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Diavolo a part of Boingo? <br> He has Boingo's future prediction ability after all </br></br>  <br>This is why stands will always be better than hamon<br> why can this character do X? <br>Well using hamon they can Y their Z, which allows them to make A, leading to B which causes C<br><br> why can this character do X? <br>because that's their stand's power</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I do not prefer hamon to stands but you sure made it sound like the more interesting option there.</br>  <br> Is Oingo part of temperance yellow? <br> he has temperance yellow's ability to shape shift </br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RPx<wbr>XvrjpxCk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Looking at the jump festa trailer, why couldn't they animate the auras like they did here? it would've looked a lot better instead of some cheap ass super saiyan shit.</br></br>  <br>too expensive, they were clearly running out of budget by the end with all those diofaces</br>  <br> running out of budget <br>Nice meme.</br></br>  <br>What i'm trying to say is that I always found it amusing the lengths that Araki went to to try and prove that a character could do something with hamon<br> "No no guys! it's totally possible! really!" <br>Then again i guess that's the shonen genre in general. Trying to logically prove batshit crazy retardation in a logical manner</br></br></br>  <br>I thought you had to shoot yourself to use a stand, because I confused it Persona and that gif of Johnny using Tusk on himself.</br>  <br>Really? With all that QUALITY you really think they didn't run out of yen by the end?</br>  <br>well, you kinda do</br>  Actually, about Diavolo: is it possible that he survived universe reset thanks to fucking dying all the time?  <br>He might be implying they never had in the first place.</br>  <br>Pretty sure he's off in some pocket dimension dying eternally so yeah, I suppose he would have 'survived' it.</br>  <br>He's probably still dying in some other universe when the reset happened.</br>  <br>Oh fuck, I just noticed Pet Shop's pose in the EoH render is the same as in HttF.</br>  <br>I thought there was only one Jojo and it was just a REALLY long series like One Piece or something</br>  <br>Probably. A fair amount of people survived so I guess it's safe to say he's still dying in the other universes. Speaking of the Diavolo, what happened to his body? Was it just rotting somewhere? Did it vanish? And some more questions...<br><br> Isn't it implied or stated somewhere that those who are strong spirited have their stands awakened? If it weren't for Araki, wouldn't Jonathan have had his stand awakened in his lifetime as well as as others like young Joseph, Speedwagon, Lisa Lisa, Stroheim, etc? <br><br> Could Mariah's magnetism have the power to overcome Pucci's C-Moon?  <br><br> If Hermes and Valentine fought, could Kiss break D4C's rule of being able to have multiple Valentines by making a double of an alt dimension Valentine? <br><br> Is Stroheim the true hero of Battle Tendency? Is it possible that he threw Joseph's arm into Kars? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is Stroheim the true hero of Battle Tendency? Is it possible that he threw Joseph's arm into Kars? <br><br>He was a torso.<br>The Earth itself did it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least he had some funny moments in the early chapters instead of being 100% serious business all the time.</br>  <br>But he still had his arms. I just find that his arm happening to fly directly at Kars is too bullshit. The only other way I can think of this as less bullshit is that assuming there have been 36 universe resets and Joseph beat Kars in all of them, no matter what happens in each universe, Kars would lose. Joseph probably could have stood on the spot and still somehow manage to knock Kars out of the Earth, dip him into a volcano or something.</br>  <br>I thought Jonathan would be the protag for all parts and that he reincarnated into later Jojos.</br>  <br> I said Bruford was a Stand User </br>  <br>I thought every JoJo would be called JoJo by their friends.</br>  <br> I tought Jonathan, Joseph and Jotaro were the same guy, posing as diferent people because they were vampires just like Dio <br> I tought it was one of those mangas supposed to be shonen but more like some shit CLAMP would come out with, just a lot campier <br> when the memes started appearing, I tought it was everything about ORA and MUDA, with yells and memes replacing any semblant of plot.  <br> Dio was in all the parts <br> The Bizarre part was the gay relationships between the main characters </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't you remember that Joseph's body was moving on its own? Even detached from his arm, his hand's will to survive caused it to fly to Kars directly.</br></br>  Has Araki's book been translated yet?  Who else wants to fuck Narancia here?<br><br>Something about him attracts me more than any other character. I think it's his look.</br></br>  <br>I don't think many people are interested.<br>It's mostly a book for artists interested in how he works than a regular joe.</br></br>  <br><br>I thought the golden non-Josuke ending had you find and burn Dio's diary, thus preventing Pucci from learning how to do his nonsense.</br></br>  <br>Welp, time to learn moonspeak then.</br>  <br>That ending is the same as the good ending for Josuke except in the Josuke ending Steel admits he's been lying to you.</br>  What would each part be called if their respective villains were the protagonists?  <br> I Would Have Succeeded With My Cunning Plan to Murder My Adoptive Father If It Wasn't For My Nosy Adoptive Brother... Who Shoots Light With His Fists?!!! </br>  <br>I always wanted to do a rewrite of the beginning of Dio's World from Jotaro's perspective. Having time randomly stop for him while chasing Dio during Kakyoin's death, then having Joseph die in front of him with him trying everything he can to move a finger.</br>  <br>I thought Part 3 was good.<br>I thought Part 5 was shit.</br></br>  <br> Phantom Blood <br> Crimson Desire <br> Curse of a Bloodline <br> Busy Life <br> Null Existence <br> Stairway to Heaven <br> For America </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always thought the villain of Part IV won. WHen I finished reading that one I expected it to happen in Part V. Something with he villain shooting the MC right in the face.</br>  <br>I thought that every part featured stands.<br>I actually thought Narancia was a girl.<br>I thought that poses were way more prominent in the series.<br>I thought that Fugo was related to Dio.<br>I thought that Joseph was Jonathan's son.<br><br>I don't know. My first "serious" look at the series where ASB videos.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Devil's Luck <br> Stone Free <br> Phantom Blood  <br> Our Town <br> Quiet Ocean <br> Divine Mandate <br> Pursuit of Happiness </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Josuke will travel to the SBRverse shortly.  I wish Geb existed. I want it to gouge my eyes out, tear off my head, and then crush it.  <br>How many Josukes are there now?</br>  I was listening to Jonathon's english voice again. It sounds like my friend trying to act and that's the worst thing I can imagine. Jonathon might have the worst voice in the dub.  <br>2</br>  <br>He definitely does.<br>I came to one conclusion.<br><br>It's an EXCEEDINGLY BAD Daniel Radcliffe impersonation.</br></br></br></br>  <br> A lot of Giorno's personality is lost on translation <br>I've seen this claim over and over again<br>As a guy who read part V for the first time when it wastranslated and sold in my own language: what's wrong? What did the scanlators really change about him?<br>I don't think Giorno really has that much of a personality to begin with. He's kinda the strong, silent type, like Jotaro, except a lot more ruthless stowards people who piss him off... But that's about the only thing transpiring from him and it's not a far shot from "shonen protagonist #373." It's accurate to say he's more of a walking, talking plot device to tie the other interesting characters together.</br></br></br></br>  My first time colorizing Jojo, how bad did I do?  <br><br>Joseph's sounds alright, but I think the voice is a little too deep.</br></br>  <br>If there is any good thing about JYB voicing Joey JoJo, it's that he won't voice another one.</br>  <br><br> having a lack-cluster protagonist where the side characters have more of an impact than Giorno <br><br>That is every fucking JoJo series starting with Part 3. Hell, Josuke was hardly the main protagonist of Part 4. It was Koichi's Bizarre Adventure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>A tad too deep, he's at least more on point.</br>  <br>He's like post Italy Michael Corleone, but with less outright agency.</br>  <br> I thought JoJo was literaly G.I. JoJo <br> I thought it was about strong generic western guys fighting strong generic western villains <br> I thought the characters were all dumb and what made them different was their theme <br> Stroheim was Army Guy <br> Jonathan was Hero Guy <br> Joseph was Cool Guy </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I also read the translated volumes in my language, he does have a personality, and that doesn't mean he has to be bombastic all the time like Joseph.<br>He's the silent type yeah. But he's also DIO's and Jonathan's son and that transpires if you read. He's always trying to keep his cool but is earnest for his gang whom he familiarizes throught the journey. Giorno is a team player so he makes lots of strategic suggestions for his companions, and tend to rely on others more than most Jojo. He also like to snark from time to time.<br>He's also very vicious concerning his enemies, making speeches and threat like DIO does. And when he gets the drop on them, he brutally beats them down, and that's for killing, the enemies are not retired, they are dead. And remember he sent a venomous snake to bite Melone. He also clearly trashtalks Diavolo when he gets Requiem.</br></br></br>  <br>Things I like:<br><br>Using English accents for English characters. It may hurt the performances but seeing these guys with American accents would have been worse for me. It gives me hope that Polnareff's dub will be as gratuitously French as he is in Viz Manga.<br><br>The scriptwriting. That's my favorite iteration of Speedwagon's "Giants among men" monologue and I'm excited to see what they do with Johnathan's "I realized that you had a family too" speech.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not bad at all, I like the style.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's a nice touch. One hopes that they were better at it, but Jonathan and Joseph need that bit.<br><br>Speedwagon is rounding out as my dark horse favorite.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I honestly think all the voices are very fitting of every character given their nationality/year. This is pretty much what the character should like if they didn't speak Japanese.<br><br>The problem is more that their DELIVERY and PERFORMANCE isn't nearly as good. The voices are fine and fit the character, but for example Joseph's delivery isn't nearly as bombastic and amusing as the Japanese version. Speedwagon in Japanese is so passionate it sounds like his throat is getting sore from all the shouting, and it's just not there in English.<br><br>Dio Brando is pretty good at least. I'm sure he was happy to get the part and it shows.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks! Gonna do a Valentine one for the 4th too, I'll post it here in a bit.</br>  <br>Josuk- I mean Josefumi is here now.</br>  <br>Right, it's missing the over the top nature.</br>  <br>Terrible hair.</br>  <br>Josefumi hair &gt; Josuke hair &gt; Gappy hair</br>  <br>I want to run my hair though it during sex.</br>  <br>I honestly wonder if they should have just ditched the accents and made everyone sound American or neutralish. I understand trying to be authentic and give flavor to the characters (like how the accented dub of Hellsing worked REALLY well because of it), but it probably wasn't worth trying for JoJo. It's not like the original Japanese tried to give people regional accents, everyone in every year all over the world spoke Japanese and that was that.<br><br>For JoJo, performance and flamboyance is more important than realism and authenticity. I'd much rather Joseph sound American but still have snarky, macho delivery than give him a realistic accent but for him to lose character because of it.</br></br></br>  <br>you want to run your hair through his hair?</br>  <br>He should sound more punkish</br>  <br>Yeah, if it was ONE OR THE OTHER - go for performance.<br><br>I think it could have been both, with more skill</br></br></br>  <br>Nope every character had his speech pattern do differentiate between themselves. They should try to give the characters regional accents, that's an opportunity I wouldn't miss. Besides that is neutralish English?</br>  <br> being this wrong about literally everything <br><br>Vins wasn't trying to stop Pucci, she was trying to ensure his plan worked. She didn't want to fix time, she wanted to exploit the loops to save her child. Josuke and the CaC protagonists are mutually exclusive, they don't exist at the same time.<br><br>Literally everything you wrote past the third line is fucking nonsense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really do hate that they got rid of Dio's "I reject my humanity" line, though. It's iconic and perfectly fits the character.</br></br>  <br>AMERICAN</br>  <br>Yukako confirmed for NTR fetishist.</br>  <br> I will become so much more <br>That just doesn't have the same punch.<br><br>They could have easily fit it in too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even America has a bunch of accent doesn't it?</br>  <br> Killer Queen sneaking up on the side <br>Thought I was about to Bite the Dust for a second.</br></br>   The Christmas Cake never wins <br><br>Old hags deserve some love too, you know.</br></br>  They had their chance when they were young.  <br>MUH DICK</br>  <br>Sauce?</br>  <br>Good story ruined by awful ending: The manga</br>  <br>so nearly every manga?</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br>Well I can remove it from my backlog then.

Give teenagers a break for a while.</br></br>  <br>what?</br>  Post Christmas cakes who got a happy ending.  <br>Age gap is really hot. Really loved Taiyou no Ie, where FeMC is 17 and MaMC is 25</br>  <br>It never goes anywhere though.</br>  <br>It was nice, thanks for sharing</br>  <br>Kill yourself slut.</br>  <br>Fuck off faggot</br>  <br><br><br><br>Back to your cesspits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't remember the name but it was basically the Cake going on the bus and trying to "flirt" with people by giving them occasional looks without them noticing.<br><br>Eventually a dude gets on the bus and she does the same to him for a couple times until she notices that he saw her in the reflection every time. They also marry by the end.</br></br></br>  <br>Just because it didn't have a happy ending doesn't mean it's ruined, it was bitter, sad, regretful, perfectly portraying the stupid shit relationships go through sometimes, specially with the protagonist having aspergers. I liked it.</br>  <br>I thought it turned into the typical shoujo does he love me? Is he cheating on me?

Better yet, link him to the pastebin post at the top of each thread.<br>If you see images (3DPD/Feels/Pepe and more) or people that don't belong on this board or ANISON threads, please, just report them and ignore their posts.<br><br>All they want you to do is to respond and derail the thread.<br> <br>If threads get derailed all the time, mods may start deleting them and nobody wants that.<br> <br>Please, just get along and enjoy the music.<br> <br>There is also the case that they might just be crossboarders and they don't do it on purpose because they aren't accustomed to /a/ manners.<br>https://archive.moe/_/search/boards<wbr>/biz.c.co.diy.fit.gd.h.i.int.jp.k.m<wbr>.mlp.out.po.q.qa.r9k.s4s.sci.tg.tv.<wbr>u.v.vg.vp.vr.wsg/text/MOGRA/type/po<wbr>sts/<br>So if this is the case, you can stay and enjoy with us, but please, adapt to /a/ and don't bring your boards manners, images and other shit.</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  But the question is   will we get Honks?    sore ga ai deshou /a/  Translations feel so smooth<br><br><br>Agreed, hope they change it soon-ish</br></br></br>  Another month here.<br><br>Ready for some  fun  with you<br><br>Thanks to mogranon like always</br></br></br></br>  <br>I guess that's love, Anon.<br>Not that I know.</br></br>  Finally a MOGRA to party in. Wish my computer weren't busted but at least mobile streaming seems fine.  When stream goes down/RIP/kill/Yunchi, this happens sometimes due to technical difficulties, not other things.<br>Just wait and don't blogpost what you are doing, this could only bring bad attention.<br>So, no blogposting and also no "thread is kill, what now?" kind of post.<br><br>Go watch/read/listen something in the mean time.<br><br>If you want to post random Soundclouds, to a degree that is Anison Matrix related, do it just to keep the thread alive, but and this is very important<br><br><br>just leave the thread reach page 9 or 10 first and them bump it. <br><br><br>In moments like this, it's better to stay the major amount of time out of page 1, to avoid shitposters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   all this stuttering <br><br>Oh well time for mobile quality stream again</br></br>  I already said this a lot of times and last month they were asking this so.<br><br>I won't risk on making a thread for other event that is not ANISON MATRIX on /a/.<br>Don't want to get mods angry after all we fight to get back mogra threads and now we are good with them.<br><br>As i already said, Anison Matrix have been here for a long time, that's what marks the difference with other events that have never been. Also Anison Matrix event is the more /a/ related because it has a majority of anisong themes.<br>There are other events that have anison, but not enough to be /a/ related, and we are walking on a thin line here.<br>NEW YEAR is a special, so it's 50/50 /a/ related, but not all the music they pass are anisongs.<br><br>That's why I only make:<br><br>- Anison Matrix (This one has been streamed on /a/ the longest, every first saturday of the month)<br>- Mogra Anniversary (As a place/bar and it's a 3 days event)<br>- Anison Matrix Anniversary (One day event, always first saturday of May)<br>- New Year Countdown (Last day of the year)<br><br>As i already said in the past, I will only make Anison Matrix threads.<br>Someone sugested to make a thread for other Mogra events on /jp/, so if you want to make one, feel free to do it.<br>But take in count that I don't know /jp/ rules or /jp/ at all, i'm only from /a/ and /w/.<br>So if they don't like/want those threads, please don't push hard on them and just don't make them, it could end affecting Anison Matrix threads.<br><br>Examples of things to don't do.<br>Please next time archive.moe/a/thread/122830717 don't use the name Anison Matrix for an Anison Index event, they are not the same, you only will confuse other anons and give a bad name to this threads.<br>Same for archive.moe/a/thread/123178659, please don't make reminders or threads to remember next mogra event, again this only attracts bad attention, even if you put it inside another tipe of thread. <br>(I know the anon's that make this threads didn't do it on purpose)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>37-38 ¬∞C, no AC available for me.<br>I haven't opened the window all day but it's still too hot in here</br></br>  <br>Yun*chi is a technical difficulty?<br>That's not very nice of you to say, ARanon.

It is over the top.</br>    <br>Remind me again. These two. Were they part of bossu's gang back then?</br>  S1, S2, S3 background.  Soon, /a/.<br>For now post pictures of your favorite Wagnaria</br>  When I first saw Working! my favorite was Inami, but I recently I rewatched it and I can't stop smiling whenever pic related is on screen. Also my hate for Kyoko got stronger this time around. I wish she could just die the fucking glutton bitch.  Poplar a best.  <br><br>Yachiyo and Popura a cute, but come on guys. We all know who best girl is.</br></br>  <br>Get back to work.</br>  <br> back to work </br>  starting  IT STARTED FAGGOTS  Now we wait for subs  I feel all giddy, I've been waiting so long but now it's finally happening.  <br>There was a time where I didn't want to finish S2 because I always wanted to have more Working to watch<br>Finally did when S3 was announced<br><br>I honestly thought A-1 would go under before we saw S3</br></br></br></br>  Wow long until it's subbed?<br><br>Also, how does the new OP compare to the others?<br>1 &gt; 2</br></br></br>  So, the new BBCPEX having a Remix Heart story mode thing made me remember this thing actually existed. It is any good? Did Mai ever get his body back, or did they at least fix his taste buds?<br><br>If they didn't at least do that, they said the only thing he could eat before was Noel's cooking, and because of her doing everything in the games and not being able to tend to Mai, good to say Mai's a dead person.</br></br>  <br>Preparing for incoming MaiOlev.<br><br>Anyway, she stays a girl, and I think her sensitive taste stays. She can eat other disgusting cooking, anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> his </br>  <br>Well, at least in the BBCPEX story mode he still considered himself to be male, might be different later on for all I know.</br>  <br>Why didn't Mai just have Noel 'teach' her how to cook? Mai wouldn't need to depend on her for food then.</br>  <br> incoming MaiOlev <br>who?</br></br>  <br>What made you think that word is a person's name?</br>  <br>hmm?</br>  <br>I wish there was a way for me to NTR this faggot in front of him. I'd fuck Mai with my black cock while he watches and weep like a little bitch.</br>  Will she be playable,too?  <br>This is what Mai looks like at the time of the games. Mai could still eat other types of food; she just found it discontenting to eat them. Maybe the fact she gained control over her grimoire helped solve the problem of reading the memories of everything she tastes.<br><br><br>Because Mai tasted the love Noel put into her cooking. It's not that awful things tasted good to her.</br></br></br></br>  What Mai liked wasn't the taste of the food itself, what she "tastes" is the feelings a person puts into the cooking of the food.  <br>Mai came to think of herself as a girl. Noticing that she had lost interest in girls and instead fallen in love with a guy made her come to the realization that she had turned both physically and mentally a girl (and she accepted that change).<br><br><br>They talked about Kajun being playable in the Bururaji episode where her VA was a guest. Sugita suggested that she might have a fighting style where she obtains information about her enemy. No idea if that will actually be implemented though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Thin as hell <br><br>Guess she still can't eat, wonder how she's getting by without Noel to cook for her.</br></br></br>  <br>By the way, the manga has finished being scanlated. Here are some download links for it:<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/2<wbr>lxw7h8bathoqrw/BlazBlue_Remix_Heart<wbr>_v1.rar<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/o<wbr>ptcahwyt039ihu/BlazBlue_Remix_Heart<wbr>_v2.rar<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/4<wbr>twddihncoqtujj/BlazBlue_Remix_Heart<wbr>_v3.rar<br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/p<wbr>l7jxg2o2dsbf99/BlazBlue+Remix+Heart<wbr>+v4+ch20-25.rar</wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></wbr></wbr></br></br>  How did Not-Dizzy get turned into a girl anyways? Was it just some mage being a dick to a random person or something?  <br>Grimoires are insane.</br>  <br>Only a woman can be the vessel of the Nameless Grimoire.<br><br><br>All girls in the series are thin. I don't think there's a reason to think that she's undernourished. She either learned to turn off her power when she needs to or she got used to the side-effects of eating stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br> All girls in the series are thin <br>Well, not THAT thin. I think the 3 girls at least have more meat to them, and Litchi looks normal-ish (other than bust size) at least in the CP character portraits.</br></br>   Nameless mentioned the power of the Azure <br><br> Ragna didn't get turned into a girl <br><br>what the hell, even the grimoires are inconsistent.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Grimoire in BB=bad thing you should be as far as possible from at all times.</br>  <br>Seen this?<br><br>The Nameless Grimoire and the Azure Grimoire are different. They don't work in the same way. The former had temporarily synergized with a fragment of the Azure, but it doesn't even use that normally.</br></br></br>  <br>Not really; depends on the grimoire. Grimoires enable normal humans to use magic after all, so they are pretty useful. Some of the more powerful ones can have adverse effects, but the Nameless Grimoire seems fairly benign, all things considered.</br>  <br> Actually, if the same rules applied though, it would make more sense that Ragna's is a fake and Noel has the real Azure, since she IS a girl. </br>   Mai copies powers from 'tasting them' <br><br>I wonder if she was in the game, if she would be like Rouge from X-Men Vs. Street Fighter, she could copy some moves by during a command grab.<br><br>Though, a grappler Mai who then holds people in place in order to lick/taste them might be a bit too...lewd.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Terumi has an Azure Grimoire too, and all he has is a girl's name. Also, none of the other grimoires that appear in the games or side-materials have such a restriction.<br><br><br>She could copy and apply the powers to others, but not actually use them herself.  And she lost that power near the end of the manga. </br></br></br></br>  Is the bit in BBCPEX just covering the first few chapters, or original stuff?  <br>   And she lost that power near the end of the manga. <br><br> Did she at least lose the shitty part of her taste-buds too?  </br></br></br>  <br>Original side-stories. They are set around 3 weeks after Mai's arrival at the Academy.<br><br>Someone has uploaded the first half of the first story:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YlG<wbr>oYAimCq0</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><br>She kept that power. But that is pretty useful. Being able to read the properties of objects or the memories of people you taste is a pretty powerful ability.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> She kept that power. But that is pretty useful <br><br>I would disagree...not being to eat anything really without giving you pains like what Mai described...she's lucky as hell Noel was there with her food, otherwise by her own words she would have died from starvation. Doesn't sound that good to me.<br><br>Also, what IS Mai doing at the time of the games anyways? MIA? If so, Terumi probably gave her a mission meant to kill her like he gave to Makoto.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She could eat other things. She simply found it difficult to do so.<br><br>In the epilogue  Mai realizes that her father wants her to escape from the fate that awaited her and she decides that she wishes to make herself worthy of him. Presumably she leaves NOL after graduating and goes off to become a warrior in order to prove herself.  The details will presumably get revealed in BB4.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Black steam starts rising on the screen <br><br>How the hell is Mai able to eat that when it knocked Makoto out cold? In fact, how the hell can Noel not notice the black steam or how people's reactions to it cause them to black out? What the fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>   Presumably she leaves NOL after graduating and goes off to become a warrior in order to prove herself. <br><br> In b4 Relius finds her and Bad End'd her like Makoto's Bad End. No doubt he would have a blast toying with Mai's soul due to what happened to her. </br></br></br>  <br>Noel is not exactly smart. And apparently the stuff is edible but it's the taste that's awful. In any case, it's all comedy. Don't take it too seriously.<br><br><br>Relius is interested in Mai's soul. However he doesn't want to capture Mai or destroy it since he's wants to see how it will develop over time.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Relius is interested <br><br>BAD END CONFIRMED</br></br></br></br>  <br> How the hell is Mai able to eat that <br>something about tasting the love in it or something<br><br>which reminds me, why doesn't Mai just cook her own food with her feelings of 'I WANNA SURVIVE' or something? might counteract the other bad bits and not make her not so anorexic</br></br></br></br>  <br>Noel's love is scary.</br>  I was playing XBlaze a few days back and every time I wished it could have centered around Remix Heart.<br>Maybe next XBlaze? I want to play as Mai and date Kajun, or brown Taro sempai.</br>  <br>Indeed. Noel isn't very normal. I doubt that Mai would be able to overwrite the original information contained in the food the way Noel can.<br><br><br>I think that Remix Heart Gaiden is the closest thing we'll see to a VN starring Mai.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I want to play as Mai <br><br>Not &gt;I wanna be the little girl.<br><br>Seriously, though, I would like Mai to be playable in the next main BB game, or at least DLC for Extend. I feel bad for her now knowing about her taste-bud issue. Before I thought turning into a girl was all that happened to her and that Remix Heart was just fan-service trash, but maybe now I'll actually take a look at it with a open-eye...or maybe my opinion will still hold true, who knows.</br></br></br></br></br>  Panda's/  <br>Panda~</br>  <br>I think that's likely. Mai was after all the protagonist of a 2 hour segment in BBCPE and also provided a system voice, which has been a first step for other characters along the same path. And there was a phone strap of her being released alongside two other girls who are pretty popular and already playable. Considering the exposure Mai has received, and the fact she has an established fighting style and that a design for her after graduating has already been revealed, I think that it makes sense that she will be playable.<br><br>And she actually demonstrates what I thought was a surprising amount of inner conflict and character development considering the nature of the manga.</br></br></br>  <br>What IS her fighting style anyways? licking things for information?  Sounds like a hentai gone wrong. </br>  <br>Sword&amp;dagger as far as I know.</br>  <br>Mai fights with a sword and parrying dagger, though she is proficient at unarmed combat and assassination techniques as well. And her grimoire can enhance her physical abilities.</br>  <br> her </br>  By the way, all of Remix Heart Gaiden has just finished being uploaded:<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YlG<wbr>oYAimCq0</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=s6D<wbr>nrq8lS-s</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=lTI<wbr>I_NiYl2U</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XWM<wbr>IHYFVub4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  Swords and parrying dagger for counters, it could work guess it would be like Linne from UNIEL. Question is though, what would be her drive and what would it do?  <br>In this interview of Mori they use "kanojo" to refer to Mai. So "she" is the right way to refer to her.<br>http://www.famitsu.com/news/201504/<wbr>23077073.html<br><br><br>Something to do with her grimoire I guess. This looks like a distortion finish, though it doesn't involve her grimoire directly.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Do you even play BB?</br>  <br>Can she make more than that?</br>  <br>You're such a dumb boy.</br>  <br>Sure, I've played BB. Not that big in fighting games to be honest (though I have played some other animu fighters as well such as Meltan or SWR). I guess I'd get called a storyfag.</br>  <br>I bet you'd be more into it if Mai was playable.</br>  <br>The powers of her grimoire are never precisely defined, but we do see that it allows Mai to boost her physical abilities, regenerate her injuries, create magical defensive barriers, conjure weapons, and read the properties of objects or the thoughts and memories of people.<br><br><br>Yes, I would be.</br></br></br></br>  <br>ho..how am I dumb?</br>  <br>Didn't expect them to reveal Kajun's double agent stuff here. Through it does make me curious that it wasn't explored in the manga as much as it could of been, I mean, Kokonoe working with somebody other than Roy,Tager or Litchi is pretty weird to see. In fact, was Tager even around at this time?</br>  <br>no clue, but her Va managed to make Sugita uncomfortable during the last Bruraiji, she has too much dam energy.</br>  <br>It got revealed pretty early in the manga as well. And Kokonoe's role was the same as what she had in CT or CS; sending her operatives out to do stuff. But why wouldn't Kokonoe have other agents? She was pretty high up in the Sector Seven hierarchy.<br><br>The construction of Tager has begun, but he wasn't quite finished yet.</br></br></br>  <br>this reminds me i have to finish compiling V4 of the manga since Jin was nice enough to scan the extra stuff.</br>  <br>Too bad that nobody ever translated this 4koma though.</br>  <br> why wouldn't Kokonoe have other agents <br><br>Probably the Committee doesn't want her to have TOO much power. Kokonoe hates them and they do stuff she disagrees with, like the whole Azrael episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Not having too much power doesn't mean that she's only allowed 3 employees though.</br>  <br>once a man always a man</br>  <br>Kokonoe's a resourceful bitch, give her even a bit more stuff and she could do fucking wonders with it.</br>  Did Mai have long ass hair as a male too, or did the Grimoire just like long hair?  <br>Mai always had a ponytail.<br><br><br>If she was too restricted she would have been useless to Sector Seven though. Plus, she'd have defected sooner.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would make fun of him for having a ponytail, but this is BB, where alot of the males have stupid hairstyle.<br><br>I blame the Imperator.</br></br></br>  You're always super special.  <br>Countdown went to 0 and then up again, anything announced yet?</br>  <br>It went 2zero and beyond, I hope he wasn't just trolling. Is there some panels at AX now?</br>  <br>I don't know, that's why I asked.</br>  <br><br><br>Clicked the clock, it's calibrated to your location. Here is what I get after clicking it.</br></br></br>  <br>If that was true then why aren't you here with me?</br>  <br>8 hours to go?<br>Okay, time to move on, see you ion 8 hours.</br></br>  <br>So we have no idea when it's supposed to be 0, just that it's today.</br>  Wait, can someone explain what this countdown is to me? I thought it was just Winkel copying the countdown they had for Zero Escape 3 as a joke? Is it actually counting down to an announcement?  <br>I imagine it's counting down to maybe a panel or a booth announcement. <br>Though it could just be blick laughing at us, which is almost as likely I imagine.</br></br>   „Åù„ÅÆÁõÆË™∞„ÅÆÁõÆÔºü   <br>God dammit, first the shit with C;C delivery and now this.

I just want to see her crying and in pain, so it happening multiple times will only make my dick harder. </br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br>Read it now.</br>  <br>I'm going to Japan at the end of next week, so I've been holding off on picking up any new manga until I can buy some volumes while I'm over there.</br>  <br> Zombie apocalypse in a grimdark world <br>God damn. If the lolis dies without HEALING, I'll drop.</br></br>  <br>If you're going to buy it anyway, why not just read it now?</br>  <br>They aren't loli.</br>  <br>Please Jesus can we just not for once?</br>  <br>Because reading off paper volumes that you bought in a shop is so much more satisfying.</br>  <br>You're gonna get spoilered super fucking bad if you don't read the manga and wander into these threads. It's kind of inevitable.<br><br>It actually only takes about a night to catch up to the current chapter and is a fucking fantastic read, so yeah. Same goes for any other lurkers wondering if they could watch the anime and not get spoilered; basically you'd probably have to stay out of the threads altogether.</br></br></br>  Is this yuri?  <br>No. It's full-blown zombie apocalypse.</br>  It's over. Impressions are rolling in on Twitter now. So far all I've been able to glean is that it's heart pounding.  https://twitter.com/search?q=%E3%81<wbr>%8C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%93%E3%81%86%E3%8<wbr>1%90%E3%82%89%E3%81%97&amp;src=typd&amp;ver<wbr>tical=default&amp;f=tweets<br><br>Twitter's getting excited</br></br></wbr></wbr></wbr>  https://twitter.com/Tamashari/statu<wbr>s/617238353855934464<br><br>Uh oh.</br></br></wbr>  I really hope I'm google translating some of these tweets wrong.  So is this some Madoka wanabe?  <br>This is the dumbest thing I've heard all day.</br>  <br>The actual mangaka wrote the screenplay for this though, so changes from the original were totally his call to better fit things; I bet he had a goal of having the anime end on Graduation at all costs.<br><br>Besides some of the early chapters weren't exactly good in my honest opinion; it kind of dragged for a bit while waiting for the "fucking duh" moment of Miki joining.</br></br></br>  Cute<br><br><br>How so?</br></br></br>  <br>Yui is cute!</br>  <br> tfw you'll never have a megu-nee tulpa </br>  <br>Believe, anon!</br>  <br>That doesn't say that Miki is with the group from the beginning, does it?</br>  <br>Megu isn't dead. Miki starts out with them. That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible.</br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. It's terrible. <br>Dropped.</br></br>  <br>That's what I gathered.<br><br><br>Now that I don't believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Miku's with the group since the beginning. <br> The reveal at the end of the episode hit harder than the manga's. </br></br>  <br>Well, if you want to see her suffer, you're  in luck. </br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Explain why she's not in any promo art then.</br></br>  Just read the latest chapter.<br> Rii rescued her little sister in a swarm full of zombies, who survive months just by hiding  <br><br>Fucking bullshit.</br></br></br>  Twitter's responses seem for the most part very positive. Even with some changes to the manga's plot, the anime is looking like it'll be good.  <br>No shit it's bullshit. Think harder.</br>  <br>It's the teddy bear anon, she's just delusional. Why do you think Yuki is the only one to react while Kurumi and Miki look on worryingly?</br>  <br>Maybe don't skim through it so quickly next time.</br>   Finally get a loli <br> I-It's just a bear! <br>Fuck that shit. I won't believe it until it's 100% confirmed.</br></br>  <br>I'm much more worried that she got fucking bitten in the process and was expecting to see a mark revealed anytime. What does she even do about zombies again? I don't even remember if she uses the flares a lot or had some noise maker, basically only Miki and Kurumi can actually hold their own alone so I assume full and well that Rii's fucked.</br>  <br>Please don't start.</br>  <br>Is this moe/yuri shit?</br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>She hoses down zombies early on to save Kurumi, and she uses the glowsticks constantly.</br>  <br>Yes, better leave now.</br>  <br>Alright, thanks anon, I'll stay far away from this garbage.</br>  <br>Start what? I'm not calling the rest of them lolis like the shitposter. Ruu is a loli though.</br>   https://twitter.com/MAJ_Karso/stat<wbr>us/617241201838718976</wbr> <br> loose character animation <br>Google translates "yuru" as "loose", so I'm not sure if this post referencing the SoL fakeout or bad animation<br><br>Another post used the same "loose" yuru and made it sound like a reference to the SoL fakeout https://twitter.com/efutty/status/6<wbr>17241893605277696</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I could help.</br>  <br> Rii thinks she hears her sister in the room somehow <br> No one else can hear shit no matter how they concentrate, while at the same time Rii is positive she heard someone <br><br>Wouldn't surprise me if Rii is also going looney. Her sister might have never even existed for all we know and she's going schizo or something inventing things; I don't see how she could have gone all this time and totally forget she even fucking existed until just a second ago.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not liking your chances. Chapter 36 spoiler.</br>  <br>ha ha holy shit</br>  <br>He used kana for "yuru" which suggests he doesn't mean "loose".</br>  <br>I'm always having a hard time reading between the lines, but damn can't believe she fucking snapped despite being the most rational one.</br>  <br>Fuckin google translating shit wrong</br>  <br>Why bother if you're just going to use google translate. It's completely wrong.</br>  <br>She snapped during the helicopter chapter</br>  What will it take to fix Rii?  <br>I'm trying to get some sense of what they're saying.</br>  <br>When she has to choose between saving either the teddy bear or one of her friends.</br>  <br> Miki starts out with them.  <br>Acceptable, although cutting off her life in the store and later rescue is a shame, i guess it's done to reach a decent halting point in 1 cour.<br> Megu isn't dead.  <br>That doesn't make much sense, if you have to cut stuff (see above) why do something like this that would add pieces? Unless it's going completely off-rails.<br> That one girl no one knew is the MC.  <br>Now that has to be fucking bullshit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> That one girl no one knew is the MC. <br>Where'd you get that?</br></br>  <br>Who the fuck is the "girl no one knew" supposed to be? Kei? If so then basically I think we are going to see a condensed prologue (and basically a retcon from the author, in a tacit admitting that it took way too fucking long for Miki to officially join).</br>  <br><br>It's just obvious bait lads<br><br>Also, if Miki is with the group from the beginning, what happens with Kei? She has a character design for the anime and everything.</br></br></br></br>  https://twitter.com/mosaicwav/statu<wbr>s/617247520314396673<br><br>What staff role does MOSAIC.WAV have? I'm pretty sure they're not doing the OP or ED.</br></br></wbr>  <br>General OST, no?</br>  <br>You can't make a whole OST out of akibapop.</br>  So can someone who actually knows Japanese summarize for us  I have this thing where I go crazy for cute girls that seem normal on the outside but are actually partially insane on the inside.<br><br>I just want to hold her and tell her it's all going to be okay. <br><br>So what's really going to happen is that somehow she and the teddy bear gets separated, and so she goes out of her way to try and get the teddy bear back, which will result in bad things happening.</br></br></br></br>  Is there a thread on 2chan/futaba about this?  <br>Maybe the anime switches it up chronologically and starts after they save Miki, though her rescue is revisited in a flashback?</br>  <br>Maybe, all it is is that the bait and switch had to be extended from, what, eighteen pages to almost an entire episode, so maybe they just included Miki in the bait part just for the first episode.</br>  <br>You only just now come around to Rii for this and not fucking Yuki? <br><br>I kind of laughed when Miki chucked the pistol because I bet she thought at some point, "oh god, what if Yuki got her hands on this".</br></br></br>  My hunch is that the anime will end in the chapter where they left their school behind.  <br>First ep is probably all bait, then the ending it's revealed what's going on, then real shit starts 2nd ep.</br>  <br>How are they going to fit 30 chapters of a monthly manga into 12/13 episodes, especially considering episode one is just chapter one?</br>  <br>I bet she wished she didn't toss it now, with what's happened in the recent two chapters. Could have really made a difference, even if it was simply used for intimidation.</br>  is there a WEG about this?  <br>Skip some unimportant parts and revamp the pacing, it's not that hard to do in anime.</br>  <br>They'll ride off into the sunset / ominous desolate landscape in the camper, I'm like 90% sure of that. <br><br>I'm also wondering if they'll combine the initial field trip and radio-chan seeing that if Miki is not longer at the mall then that part would be kind of useless now. That also also address something that's bugged me in that they never turned on the radio for the mall field trip but did later after graduation; it's not really a plot hole, but just a bit contrived-feeling; without the mall trip happening so early on that can be fixed too.</br></br></br>    <br>It's not going to be a 1:1 adaptation, they've already announced they're going to "change" stuff and the author is working on the screenplay. They'll change, add and drop a lot of stuff so they can make it to that scene. Sadly, this makes it feel like they're not really planning on a S2, even if they sell decently.<br><br>Also, Miki is in every promotional art, even though they don't go to the mall until a lot of shit happens, meaning she'll probably appear a lot faster, if not from the beggining. That's already a sign of fast pacing.</br></br></br>  <br> You only just now come around to Rii for this and not fucking Yuki? <br>Yuki isn't physically attractive to me. On top of that, her crazy is the pantsu on head variant, whereas with Yuuri you can watch her slowly descend into her madness and I find it really attract ive, both her looks, personality and the entire process of her going insane.</br></br>  <br>I don't see something like this selling decently, so having an end at the end of the season would be good.</br>  Fuck, I really wish I could read this over for the first time again.  <br>I know it's kind of cynical but I hope it doesn't get really popular. I get's just popular enough for faster translations and a respectable amount of fanart.</br>  <br>I don't mind it being popular, so long as it's not popular in the west.</br>  <br>agreed</br>  <br>She's the Mami of the group.<br>Seems rational and mature, but it's mainly a facade put up for her friends which will lead into her snapping after one event too far.</br></br>  <br>What'd be particularly wrong about that? I mean, even with the zombies and focusing on drama, the fact that the character designs are the same sort of thing you'd see in moe SoL shows like Gochiusa and Kinmoza are huge limiting factors to Western popularity.</br>  <br>My hands were trembling bad the whole time for the couple chapters after Kurumi got her special gift from Megu-ne. I can't remember the last time any media got me that panicked; I really thought she wouldn't make it and was about to cry. I'm still beyond spooked at her current condition.</br>  <br>this</br>  <br>Right. It'll get brushed off and swept under the rug without a second glance by a lot because it must be "pandering moeshit"</br>  <br>Like the Hidamari art style was a barrier to Madoka being popular in the west?</br>  <br>I guess you're right. I hadn't thought of that. It probably was a limiting factor, but with these sort of things, once it goes beyond a certain point, it becomes self-sustaining and that factor stops being limiting in the same capacity.</br>  <br>until they know it has zombies so its going to turn in the walking dead 2.0</br>  <br>I can see it appealing to /co/ or /v/ types, maybe worse (.. edgy bronies or something), looking for some bridging excuse to get into moe designs without completely leaving their comfort zones. With this they can explain to their faggot friends "l-look I don't read it for the girls, you see it's really a brutal zombie story" etc. <br><br>Maybe I'm projecting/fearmongering too hard or something; hopefully I'm wrong. Realistically though I see the chances of this being actually done really well as an anime (as in feels like the manga) as less than 10%; it'll probably sell between 2-6k, 8k max etc but it doesn't matter as we'll still have the manga, of which I think the char designs are 10x better than the anime's anyway so it's no big deal.</br></br></br>  <br>I've been nervous ever since that happened. I don't know how she can be saved, or if she'll suddenly start twitching like the helicopter pilot, or if she'll get colder and look more and more like a corpse as time goes on, or what. I don't think any other story has made me feel so apprehensive. I want new chapters to hurry up and come out but at the same time I hope they're never released.</br>  <br>I think the heli pilot at least showed that apparently, you're fine as long as you keep re-dosing the medicine whenever symptoms come back bad. <br><br>Apparently it's hard to do it yourself though once your body starts to lose control, so, it might depends on whether anyone's close by her when it acts up again on whether she can re-dose to stave it off. Fuck, that brings up so many terrible possibilities, now I wish I hadn't thought of it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's Higurashi all over again. Remember when people called it "Killer Lolis"?<br><br>This shit will be "zombie lolis xD" all over the internet if it gets popular.</br></br></br>  <br>Sure, but imagine the journey during all of that. First, she'll get a little twitch or two every day, and she might brush it off as stress or that her muscles are fatigued. But over the course of a few days, it gets worse and worse, and she realizes what's going on. When someone notices and tries to say something about it, she'll brush it off with a laugh and change the subject. And then, a day or two later, it gets to the point where it can't be ignored. She spills water when trying to drink, has difficulty picking up food with a spoon, and then she almost breaks down because she can't do basic everyday functions and her body isn't hers any more. Someone gets the idea to reuse the medicine, and the twitch goes away. But that's not the end of the ride. With every dose, the medicine's effectiveness wears off. The time it takes for symptoms to show up decreases, and its intensity increases. Soon, it never completely goes away.<br><br>And then they have to abandon the RV with all of the medicine onboard in an incident.</br></br></br>    Why did Yuyushiki change it's name?  <br>And add a fourth main character.</br>  <br>and a shovel</br>  <br>And most importantly, twintails.</br>  <br>And even more importantly a  dog that fucking dies </br>  <br>Speaking of, I didn't see anyone on twitter mention the dog.</br>  <br>The dog doesn't come in till later, unless they do a flashback early.</br>  <br>I thought the dog would be there from the start, since it did have a significant presence in the artwork and the trailer. Even has its own character page.</br>  <br>It's probably just to fool people into thinking it's some slice of life. That dog only lasts for 3-5 pages in the manga.</br>  <br> bear plush with mustache in the promo </br>  So, official conclusion is, its shit with anime orignal plot?  <br>Could someone translate some of the comments?</br>  <br>What's wrong, don't you like cute harmless bears?</br>  <br>It sounds like it's going with an anime original plot, but not in a bad way.</br>  <br>But certainly not in a good way, either.</br>  <br>Not necessarily. It could end up even better than the manga.</br>  So, it's shit right?<br><br>Damn.<br><br>Why couldnt they just follow the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't see why you're saying this so authoritatively.<br><br>Granted it's probably shit, but it's not certain.</br></br></br>   „Åå„Å£„Åì„ÅÜ„Åê„Çâ„Åó„Åå„Å©„Çì„Å™ÂÜÖÂÆπ„Åã„ÇíÊäΩË±°ÁöÑ„Å´‰æã„Åà„Çã„Å™„Çâ„ÄÅ„ÅäËä±Áïë„ÅÆ‰∏≠„Å´ÁÅ´ÁÇéÊîæ<wbr>Â∞ÑÂô®„ÅåÁΩÆ„ÅÑ„Å¶„ÅÇ„ÇãÊÑü„Åò</wbr> <br><br>wwwww</br></br>  <br>I've looked through a couple dozen but pretty much no one's talking about the actual content of the episode. It's either hype for GG! by mangafags, people buying GG! volumes, people listing their seasonal animus, other people saying the characters are kawaii, etc. <br>Just one guy was commenting about the episode and he said it was gud. Another guy said that the only problem with the screening concerned seating arrangements and bad organization in the theater.</br></br>  What's the deal with this?<br><br>https://www.evernote.com/shard/s577<wbr>/sh/492c9cee-25e1-46db-89ec-12b4acc<wbr>36522/46ad5a60b0971771a8aa5ed04afbd<wbr>7fa</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> wearing stocking suspender at school <br>What the hell?

And I have read the original is the school Gurashi one episode for people who could not come to the prior screenings in rural areas. Ikansen snow is a lot scene running down the hallway, there may be a place where it is ambiguous place and wrong. Since the main are reading series might be some place you do not know where you're saying is people who do not read only book. (Example of the beard of flies were stuffed animals, etc.) <br><br><br> start from the scene where snow is sleeping peacefully in the futon. You have a beard of flies were stuffed example  <br>Taromaru is cause licking the snow. And it tries to wake everyone, but there are only snow in the bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of snow where snow trimmed the dressed. Snow running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. OP after Megu not the encounter. Megu downlink 's not not. To school life part of then it had arrived. Morning by adding the Me-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of one Volume eat the rice it has been modified to the scene. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Me-kun is not liked by Taromaru. Lee is scold Taromaru. Then introduced a scene that the original four volumes Nomi kun eat rice deliciously. Snow I impersonation eat deliciously. Snow toward the classroom for day duty. It can be stopped by to not Megu here. Shadow thin and is Ru dis. Character and conversation in the entourage two people and classroom ‚ë† of image. ‚ë° teacher also appeared.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Junior Nomi-kun comes to classroom lesson started, but it should but sleep in the beginning as class one volume is in class. Snow but say'm no good to come because in class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Me kun visited because gone is Taromaru. To Yukiwami kun says while walking to be "tense Me kun. Do will be nervous from entering the senior," but it is immediately denied. Looking Taromaru from here. Yukigami say tension has come undone and in-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Although if they closed the window could not be sure it was intentional sound effects) cries of Taromaru here. Voice I going to hear direction. <br><br> Here A part end. After Al CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Here from the B part <br>to chase the Taromaru but Taromaru is to enter the barricade front of the classroom with dexterity, but go towards the dead end (barricade of desks). Me-kun is also tries to enter the classroom is stopped and is said to be in class on snow. Confused look of Me-kun. Me kun enters the classroom from the greeting. However Taromaru the grabbed is not Taromaru getaway. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taromaru is directed to the roof. Go to the roof and walnut and joined a good capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel is walnut there are Lee again Taromaru and nephew foot race. But I get angry in Taromaru to Taromaru entered the rooftop garden. Angry to other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued.

The contents of the combined content and 19 pages of from here on page 11. Snow to the classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Also Me kun became worried to act alone and decided to go after the snow. Descended of also "I like school recently." Snow will arrive in the classroom and the character we and Taromaru conversation about ‚ë†. While here in the real over-kun is coming, but the disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of here with snow roughness of pages 22-23 is Itemi kun in the classroom is the classroom door. Snow that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall together with the actual over-kun, also wind blows. I close the window because the window is left open. So snow of the face is made up ed rush. <br>ED after the next notice<br><br>Notice next time <br>Taromaru times ish. # 2 Memories</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   https://twitter.com/hail_st/status<wbr>/617279675769860096</wbr> <br> Gold Moza for novelty school Gurashi from one episode and I was bought enough to advance if promoted to not only despair gradually increasing despair </br>  <br>Contents of the episode.

Would marry.</br></br></br>  <br>I think you're going to have to change her anime character design to get what you're hoping for, and that's asking too much, unfortunately. <br><br>It's something I can live with, though.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh god I didn't notice that</br>  <br>Its not like i have a problem with the anime design shovels still cute as fuck, i just still prefer the manga design.<br>I guess that's the case with almost all adaptions though.</br></br>    <br> mfw this is a fake opening and the real one is the dark, corrupted, bloody version of this with 28days later music </br>    <br>I like this new maymay</br>  <br> it gets darker and more corrupted with each episode </br>  Shovel a cute!<br>Would marry and repopulate the earth with.</br>  fuck   Shovel girls is slowly turning into a Zombie once the serum runs out <br> Onee-chan has become crazy <br>Pls no, someones going to die at this pace.</br></br>  <br> Shovel dies <br> disappears from opening </br></br>  <br>Shovel will never die!<br>  Because she's already undead ;_;  </br></br>  What changes did they make exactly? I don't want to panic, but is seems it's time to lose hope  <br>Far too lewd.</br>  <br>You're gonna do this every time, aren't you.<br>Not that i blame you, shovel is a goddess.</br></br>  <br>I expect that they added filler so they can finish the first episode with the twist.</br>  <br>I think Ep 2's gonna be the bait and switch. From what I read here, it seem to have ended in a good tone without the darkness that's gonna come.</br>   EVERYTHING <br> IS <br> FINE </br></br>  <br>I feel like my soul's being judged.</br>  <br> know nothing about this anime/manga <br> see the opening <br> look like healing anime <br> start learning more about it <br> start seeing page like this  <br> get scared, check wikipedia <br> &gt;Yuki seeks out fun school activities every day whilst Kurumi and Y≈´ri protect her, because in reality, they are the sole survivors of their school after a zombie outbreak overruns the city. <br>What the hell is that?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well  says the reveal's at the end of the episode.</br>  <br>They look like frog's eyes.</br>  <br>Wait, Mikis with them from the start?<br>That's fucking stupid.</br></br>  <br>clearly not something for you, you fucking newfag.</br>   WATASHITACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU   <br><br>With the extra characters they showed, I figured there was a high chance of anime original stuff.<br><br>They could still incorporate Miki's background into the story well. so all is not lost</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe it'll still be good.<br><br><br>Damn, that hurts.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But if Miki's with them from the start her snapping at yuki for being delusional sounds like it would be out of place.<br><br>The anime is starting to scare me, i really hope they don't screw the story up.<br><br><br>Like i said in the previous post, i hope they make good of it being like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> While here in the real over-kun is coming, but the disturbing bgm.  <br> Snow that conversation alone. <br>Going by this, the reveal is indeed in the last minutes of the first episode. The second line probably means "Yuki is talking alone/to herself".</br></br></br>  <br> You couldn't guess the significance without having read the mango <br>That's why it's a good, subtle hint.</br></br>  <br>It hurts to watch.</br>  <br>I hope the next few episodes are a "one week earlier..." type of thing, so we can see when it was just the three of them and see Mii-kun's rescue.</br>  <br>Literally who?</br>  <br> Lerche <br>dropped</br></br>  <br>Just read the manga.</br>  <br> Makes it look like shovel is walking around in a normal school with a shovel <br>That's way too cute, shovel moe best moe.<br><br>That zoom in on megu-nee looks like a reminiscence ;_;<br><br><br>That could work, but how the hell are they planning to do this while wasting an entire episode on SOL.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, she's all over the first episode: </br>  Rii-chan is my waifu  <br>This is way too upbeat. They must be changing it later on.</br>  <br>You know, this really does not sound like just a generic moe SoL OP. It sounds almost too cutesy to the point of feeling artificial.</br>  <br>No, I don't think so. Think of Woto's ED. It's there for the contrast.</br>  <br>Shovel is my waifu!</br>  <br>Get ready for the storm of people calling her their waifu over the next few months.</br>  <br>The real ruse is that full show will be happy sol without zombies to make mangafags really mad.</br>  <br> Aijou Yuujou <br><br>But yeah, it'll probably change.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind this as much as you'd might think. Since I like the manga so much, I'd scrutinize the anime if it skipped over something or didn't do a scene as well as in the manga. But if it went full cutesy SOL, we'd get to see how their lives would have been like without the zombie apocalypse, which in turn make the manga that much more upsetting.</br>  <br>I got used to it a long time ago, there's already two of us in here.<br>Plus i don't care because they're all just seasonal waifu fags who move on to a new waifu once the shows done.<br><br><br>I would be fucking furious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I would be fucking furious. <br>But then you're waifu wouldn't become a walking corpse.</br></br>  <br>She also wouldn't be the same girl i fell for, would she?<br><br>  At least thats what my time travel movies tell me.  </br></br></br>  <br>He'd also get NTR'd by the track and field senpai that shovel had a crush on.</br>  <br>I'll bash that kids head in.<br>In secret of course.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't seem like it'd be too hard. Looks like a girl.</br>  <br>He honest to god looks like he belongs in Free! the clothing and all.</br>    There's something wrong with me, i cant stop watching the OP   and I'm enjoying it.    <br>If you've downloaded it and are playing it on MPC, hit ctrl + down arrow. Fun times.</br>  W-Will they all die at the end?  <br>Fake op. they'll change it at ep3 with Magia.</br>  <br>If they go for that sort of ending its likely that yukis gonna be the only one to survive.<br>;_;</br></br>  <br> yfw this is the actual OP for ep2 onwards </br>  <br> implying they're not already except Yuki </br>  <br>Oh my fucking christ.</br>  <br> they all die at the end besides Yuki and she gets saved and cherishes the graduation book <br><br>Oh god</br></br></br>  <br> anons react to the GG anime.png </br>  <br><br>pls no</br></br>  <br>I really want a happy end, but I can't see it happening.</br>  <br>Jesus anon don't make me think about that sort of shit ;_;<br><br><br>Haha, that's kinda accurate considering the dogs there for like 5 minutes and then's gone.<br>In the manga anyway, who knows about the anime.<br><br><br>Zombie stories VERY rarely have happy endings.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You just have to believe in the power of friendship, love, and the shovel.</br>  <br>Did they confirm the outbreak was worldwide or only in Japan? If it's only in Japan maybe there's a chance.</br>  <br>The happiest end I can see is one of them surviving.</br>  <br> Start from the scene that Yuki is sleeping peacefully in the futon. Taroumaru bring stuffed toy with a beard and cause licking Yuki. Although tries to wake everyone, there are only Yuki to bed. Hurry preparation. Check the mystery of the stuffed toy. Names introduction of Yuki where Yuki has established a dressed. Yuki is running down the corridor and out of the bedroom. Descended of "I like school recently" here. Here, as it was the OP. Encounter with the OP after Megu-nee. "It's not Megu-nee" scene. Then follow arrived for the school life club. It has been modified to the scene to eat rice morning by adding the Mii-kun to the contents of the 10 pages of first volume. Go down it becomes likely to return here. Mii-kun is not liked by Taroumaru. Rii-san is scold Taroumaru. Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. Yuki toward the classroom for day duty. Here it can be stopped by to Megu-nee. Shadow is thin (and censored?). Conversation ‚ë† of character of image and its entourage two people and the classroom. ‚ë° teacher also appeared. <br> Start of classes, as beginning one Volume and even though it is sleep in class, such should be in class junior of Mii-kun comes to the classroom. Yuki can say as no good to come because during class and exits to say that going to the infirmary. The reason for Mii-kun visited because gone is Taroumaru. Yuki to Mii-kun "Mii-kun are tense. We'll got to nervous from entering the senior" says while walking, but is immediately denied. Looking Taroumaru from here. Yuki say that unraveling tensions in Mii-kun. The sound of the wind when you are walking down the hallway. (Or it is closed windows could not be confirmed, but it was a deliberate sound effect) Here Taroumaru barking of. Headed in the direction in which voice is heard. Here A part end. After there is CM before the picture but CM is as I enter the story. </br></br>  <br><br>I'd say more the assault alarm thing is a hint than a kitchen knife next to cooking stuff, that isn't normal school life stuff.<br><br> Running past happy cardboard cutout students. <br> Every week <br>No. No no no.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not believing in the shovel <br>There are people who do that?<br>What filthy people.<br><br><br>They're teenage girls stuck in a school for 4/5ths of the manga, we know jack shit about whats going on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There are people who do that? <br>Shovel's going to go zombie someday (probably while they're at the university or on the way to the Randall Corp. building). I have faith in Cat Hat growing to become the competent leader of cute schoolgirls that I know she can be, because god knows Shovel won't be around for too long, crazy's too crazy, and garter's more of a follower than a leader.</br></br>  <br>Realistically these zombies wouldn't be too much of a threat in countries that have a well-armed military and are spacious, like the US and Russia. And honestly with all the "Zombie Hunting Permit" and "Zombie First Response Team" bumper stickers I've been seeing recently this seems like every redneck's wet dream.</br>  <br> Shovel's going to go zombie someday <br>M-meanie ;_;<br>You just have to believe in the shovel anon, even with her dying breath she'll save everyone!</br></br></br>  <br> every redneck's wet dream. <br>Everyone with a gun's wet dream, really. World War Z (the book)'s a pretty interesting read on how the fuck a zombie outbreak would occur, or at least a somewhat believable take on how one would happen.</br></br>  The last time they'll see her it'll be like this scene. Her back will be turned towards them as she faces off a horde of zombies. They'll shout her name in desperation, as if shouting could save her. In response, she'll turn her head and give one last soft, small smile that tells them she's accepted her fate. She'll thank them, tell them that she loves them, but that they have to go. She'll turn forward, close her eyes and take a deep breath, unaffected by the voices crying out her name, then quietly say, "goodbye," and run off to her death.  <br>Anon, please.<br>As if we haven't had enough of these today ;_; <br>What makes it even worse is the fact that something like this is extremely likely and something shovel would do.</br></br></br>  <br>And later, like with Garter's friend we will see her as a zombie in the background.</br>  <br>But zombies don't detect her anymore. She won't die to zombies.</br>  <br> Then introduced a scene that Mii-kun eat rice deliciously of the original fourth volume. Yuki is I impersonation eat deliciously. <br>Is he saying that this scene is in the first episode? That's got me worried. That means they aren't planning to do it later. It was an important scene, too, since it happened after 4 chapters of shit hitting the fan and it finally showed them being able to relax a little bit.</br></br>  So /a/, are you prepared for the inevitable zombie apocalypse caused by scientists experimenting with fungi? What weapons do you have? How many supplies do you stockpile? Do you have any military/survival experience?  <br> While chasing Taroumaru he go towards the barricades of the desk but then turn to classroom before the barricade. Mii-kun also tries to enter the classroom, but is stopped and is said to be during class to Yuki. Confused look of Mii-kun. Mii-kun to enter the classroom from the greeting. However Taroumaru escape without being grabbed. It is not caught in the physical laboratory and music room. Taroumaru is directed to the roof. There are Kurumi and Rii-san, Kurumi is joined to said capture and to strike with the back of one's sword with a shovel, again Taroumaru distant foot race. But Taroumaru is I get angry in that entered the rooftop garden. Angry also other three people. Here in the presence of a gardening club whose existence it did not appear until just is issued. School life club knowledge part. Because it Tarou capture, scene change to school life club. <br> Put lead in Taroumaru. From here the contents on page 11 to page 19 combined content. Yuki is to classroom because you have forgotten your backpack in the classroom. Mii-kun became worried to act alone was also to be chasing after Yuki. "I like school recently" part. Yuki to be arrive in the classroom and conversation to the characters of ‚ë† about Taroumaru. Between here Mii-kun is coming, but as disturbing bgm. Replicated in perspective in front of where Yuki roughness of pages 22-23 is at classroom and Mii-kun is a at classroom door. Yuki that conversation alone. Then we walked down the hall with Mii-kun, the wind blows. While the wind raging since windows and close the window because it left open has broken windows. So face of Yuki becomes up ed rush. <br><br> ED after the next episode notice <br><br> Taroumaru ish times. <br> #2 Memories <br><br>So I've tried to make that Japanese paste about the contents of the episode more understandable (still using google translator). Though I guess nobody cares anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Forgot about that. I dunno then. Maybe other survivors will get her, but I get the feeling the author won't do that.</br>  <br>Maybe the anime is supposed to be a prologue for the manga, just like FTWD.</br>  <br>Well actually it would work as we saw with the scene with Miki they react to her if she does something sudden like the shout.</br>  <br>Thanks anyway anon, now it's time to panic</br>  <br> western art </br>  <br>Sounds quite a bit different. Why couldn't they have just followed the manga? There's absolutely nothing wrong with the manga's plot in the initial chapters.</br>  <br>They just want to make the twist at the end of the episode and without filler that was impossible.</br>  <br>They're gonna fuck it all up. The more I think about it, the less hope I have. Damnit, someone sound the alarm.</br>  <br>The twist is literally the most important part of the opening episode. They'll put more budget and talent into it. Don't worry.</br>   not a faithful adaptation <br><br>All hope is lose.</br></br>  <br>sausga Lerche</br>  <br>Who knows, the author might opt to have a complete surprise happy end.<br>Given the overall tone and context, I doubt there'll be a BAD END for the sake of it. Somehow even with all the suffering going on, the story is in essence about how people who understand each other and stick together can manage to make it through hardships, even if there's no guarantee of beating any and all obstacles.<br><br><br>Yeah but the author is in charge of series composition.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Stop thinking if you're just spiralling down into forced negative thoughts.</br></br>  While the adaptions unfaithfulness is scaring me I think its best to wait till episode 1 is out to judge it.<br><br>I just hope so much they don't fuck up.</br></br>  <br> have a complete surprise happy end. <br>The ultimate bait and switch, the whole manga was a story Yuki was writing.</br></br>  <br>Now we don't know what's going to happen. No one is safe.</br>  <br>Doing that without giving any hints pretty much sucks though</br>  <br>I don't deny that.</br>  They have the manga writer, of course they aren't going to follow the source material.  <br>They haven't done that much worldbuild8mg. I kind of wish they would, kind of wish they wouldn' t. I love worldbuilding, but I can also see how the story can be better told if things like that are kept mysterious.</br>  <br>I'm the same. Part of me wants to know more about the virus and what's happening in the world but I also want that the manga stays with 4 girls trying their best to survive.</br>  <br> the whole manga is actually Yukis dream, while she is stuck in an even worse reality </br>  <br> Yuki killed her friends and is in an asylum trying to come up with an excuse for why they died </br>  <br> The whole last chapter is Yuki waking up every few pages, every time in a different reality, sometimes a good one, sometimes not, and ends with her waking up for real and we don't know if the reality is good or not. </br>  <br><br><br>Anons stop, holy shit.</br></br></br>  <br> but I get the feeling the author won't do that. <br> other survivors try to murder/rape them for their shit <br> Shovel offers herself in return for the safety of her friends <br> Shovel goes full zombie as her friends leave and... </br></br></br></br>  The entire series was actually  Miki's  delusion after she snapped and made up a scenario where she was rescued and found friends.  <br> it's actually Yuki remembering all the time he passed with her friends just before he gets eaten by zombies </br>  <br>That would be awesome, but I wonder if she's actually infectious already...<br><br> Unholy forbidden love </br></br></br>  Post real American heroes, no commies allowed.  <br>I don't live in a gated community.</br>  <br>Fuck off Enclave, you're supposed to be kill.</br>  <br>A first world country is supposed to guarantee all kinds jobs, not everyone is cut out for STEM, not everyone is cut out to be an artist, but I guess murica is different, so if you're not cut out for a particular field, you end up dying on the streets. That's a nice system you got there, merilard.</br>  <br> you should realize that their social policy will never let a human die just because he lost his job or home. <br>Not anymore anon, not anymore. <br>Ten years ago maybe Europe was a thing, today i prefer USA than half of european countries.</br></br></br>  <br>Try austria.</br>  Sailor Moon Crystal - Episode 25<br><br>At least her transformation wasn't animated properly and not in that horrible CGI. <br><br>They stretched this episode out as long as they fucking could but at least it ends in two weeks. <br><br>Prince Demande's death was even more pathetic than it was in the manga. <br><br>Good to know that the announcement for season two was just a misunderstanding and Sailor Moon S will not be ruined. Sailor Neptune, Saturn, and Uranus will remain pure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Indeed.   Chibiusa gets the transformation everyone else deserved <br><br>Toei is the worst studio ever.</br></br>  <br> &gt; <br> At least her transformation wasn't animated properly and not in that horrible CGI. <br><br>Is this good news?</br></br></br></br>  <br> good news <br><br>Realize I meant to say that it "was animated properly". Mistake on my part. <br><br>It's not necessarily good news, but I just wanted to point it out. <br><br><br>This guy gets it despite my flub.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Only two hours to go, anyone else expecting some fun?  <br>It's Hiryuu and/or Funi.<br>That's almost a certain no.</br></br>  Picked up with expectations of feet.
