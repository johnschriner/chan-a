[ Will Berserk beat the long haired girly man?<br><br> Berserk thread niggas, only 10 days to go </br></br>  I hope Casca will cured of her insanity at least.  <br>Dude Conviction is an arc<br>Lost Children ans Tower of Conviction are two parts of the Conviction arc<br>Golden Age is an arc, it covers several series of chapters</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Far <br>far away<br> ne <br>One-san<br> ze <br>zed<br><br>Bunch of the names are Italian or Italian derived.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My career (which I studied for and graduated during the boat ride) involves working with a lot of dementia addled patients, I feel like it's given me a new perspective on Casca's condition. Skully's been talking about what Casca wishes for, but I think it's more than not necessarily wanting to be brought back to normal. She already remembers the Eclipse to some extent.<br><br><br>2 and 2 equals 4, the sky isn't always blue, what are you on about? Lost Children is stated to be a part of the greater Conviction arc, but has no connections to it outside of introducing Farnese, Serpico, Azan and the rest of the HICKs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I think it would be best if she died. It would create drama and tension between Guts and company, as he would likely blame them for her demise.<br><br>Despite the loss, Guts continues on a mission with the group to infiltrate Falconia, who becomes progressively more irritable and unstable. The group begins to fear him more and trust him less, which further exacerbates his already anguished mental state.<br><br>Once inside Falconia the hound consumes him completely and the city begins to fall apart as he rips through both apostles and men while a desperate Schierke tries to direct him towards his target (Griffith or whatever).</br></br></br></br></br>  You are now your main char of the last MMO you played and got dumped in the world of the last anime you watched.

Once I use my guild items to get myself a dick I'm going to be fucked so hard it wouldn't be funny. And then Imma go hug bitches. Hug them real hard, and put an heir in them.</br>  No thread? Let's fix that by discussing how erotic armpits are.  <br>What? You never fucked a knee-pussy before? What a fucking faggot.</br>  <br>I could be wrong but this girl gives me those vibes.</br>  Something about girls imitating guys being lewd really turns me on.  <br>Reminds me of that skit in Highschool Girls are Funky.</br>  <br><br>I want to cum on her classes.</br></br>  quick /a/! Name three good things about lady satsuki!  <br>All Satsukis are equal, but some Satsukis are more equal than others.<br><br>Short hair a shit, sorry.</br></br></br>  <br>What a shallow cunt with no resolve.</br>  <br>What awful taste in hair.</br>  <br> I like the dub clip in this. <br>IDK, it's not horrible but Satsuki's voice should have more force behind it.</br></br>  1. sister complex<br>2. her laugh<br>3. her resolve</br></br>  I'm currently season 2 and who does this bitch think she is? Fucking emo eyed girl came out of nowhere and talks like she's part of the main cast. Why does she know so much about the others? Is she a stalker.  Ougi is the red man  <br>Anon is correct</br>  <br>The overall arc of the show is supposed to be that Araragi is the one doing the haunting. He's not a ghost exactly, but explaining what he is takes up a whole book, but just, to simplify, he's like a ghost that haunts other people with other ghosts that are tailored to their personality, basically. But they way he experiences it is that he's friends with the people he's haunting and that he's helping them get away from or come to some understanding with their own ghost. Ougi is there to force him to face 'reality' in the story. And, obviously, it's all meant as a kind of meta commentary on this genre of light novel, where Araragi is standing for the audience demanding story tropes and fanservice of different types from the author, to escape their own real reality into a story, but the author doesn't want to play along. So Ougi is also the author directly interacting with and communicating to the reader, through their stand in.</br>  <br>Sounds cool, thanks anon.</br>  <br>kaiki a shit</br>  I don't understand the appeal of this girl. This delusional bitch only talks to animals and does some really retarded things through the show. <br><br>Does someone actually, unironically like her or what?</br></br>   Elliot Rodger is watching from a distance.     <br> Chihaya <br> technology <br>She doesn't even know how mp3 players work</br></br></br>  <br><br>Miki likes men who actually do stuff for her</br></br>  <br>Why couldn't we have had Project Fairy in the anime?</br>  Why was the last thread deleted?<br><br>Anyways<br><br>Whose next nakama and why is it pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br> characters new looks (like coby's and sengoku'd) are, or better are probably canon (since we haven't seen the new looks in the manga), but this doesn't make zephyr or anybody else more canon <br> I am the one who decides what is canon in V1000 and what not <br>Impressive</br></br></br>  This may or may not make sense. This may or may not have been brought up before but here goes. <br><br>What if the devil fruits carry at least some of the memories or quirks or skills or personalities of the previous user? And the reason why Luffy is similar to Roger is because Roger ate the Gomu Gomu No Mi AFTER becoming Pirate King and BEFORE he was executed so no one saw him use it in battle? Would this explain Sabo knowing how to use Ace's technique or something?</br></br>  <br>So this is the power of a true shitposter</br>  <br><br>Step aside niggas, best OP right here;<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Anc<wbr>wu_9KFTk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Wait, I just reread the last 2 chapters, because I've been busy and just read them from mangapanda in a hurry last 2 weeks. So Fujitora doesn't want/refused to kill Luffy/Law now, right? Fucking stupid ass translations, now it all makes sense. Because then I was wondering in this week's chapter why the fuck didn't he start attacking them</blockquote>]
