[ I'll keep the question simple, Overlord or GATE?  Overlord  Both are shit  <br>GATE. Overlord is another SAO tryhard with bad animation and characters.</br>  <br>How much screen time does this semen demon get? Really makes or breaks if I pick this up</br>  <br> source material <br>GATE<br><br> anime adaptation <br>Overlord</br></br></br></br></br>  man, Overlord sure is slow as fuck  easily gate  <br>Both are pretty mediocre. Overlord though has superior waifus.<br><br>A-1 also fucked up character designs for Gate. Can these fuckers do anything right?</br></br></br>  GATE was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism, but the start was better than anything in Overlord (I've read the first 3 volumes).   Gate: 24 eps <br> Overlord: 13 eps <br><br>Nuff said</br></br></br>  <br>More.</br>  <br>Overlord. <br><br>GATE gets retarded with a 40 chapter drama bullshit with the Elf going crazy.</br></br></br>  <br> 3eps already fucked up for nothing </br>  <br> was ruined for me by the retarded jingoism  <br>You have no right to have this opinion if you're an Amerifat.</br></br>  <br>I'm not and I find American jingoism more tolerable because they actually have the power to back it up. Japan does not.</br>  <br>but a broken elf is best elf.</br>  <br> American jingoism more tolerable <br> says the 'murrican while pretending to be not american </br></br>  <br>The difference is that America is actually a military superpower, while Japan doesn't even have an existing army</br>  <br>Why would I lie? My point still stands. America has the most powerful military in the world whereas Japan is America's bitch.</br>  What if the only reason GATE exists is to encourage jingoism and radical nationalism in Japan among otaku?  <br>Doesn't matter. It's still fiction and you're retarded if you can tolerate the American one but not the Japanese one.</br>  <br>Only thirteen eps, so not much and the most of it will be her wearing a full suit of armor.</br>  <br>Right now, Overlord. Maybe because i read Gate and did not Overlord LNs.<br><br>Gate i am looking forward to few moments being animated, but not very hype though enjoying it. Overlord for now is fresh, and unlike Gate does not gear gore.</br></br></br>  <br>And? Just because its fiction its based on reality, which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk<br><br>It's be like watching the Lord of the Rings and the halflings conquered the world from the shire, with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it</br></br></br>  <br>What if you are a butthurt ameri/k/unt?</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Melkor. Always bet on Melkor.</br></br>  <br>tojo plz leave</br>  <br>But thats not just gate. It goes decades ago, and passes through many stages.<br><br>From "anti-war" (in reality preparing children to fact that war is hell, but they`ll have to fight to survive even if their goverment is shit) Gundams, mecha in general, Night Raid, SnK, recently AirSoft to wake interest in guns and now Gate and reairing Grave of Fireflies in prime time.<br><br>Its all part of the plan. Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. War and nationalism propaganda was its core for long time, but there are other trends too - like recently attempts to fix the birth rates by propagating marriage and milfs or shows about work to make NEETs think work is actually fun and full of waifus.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'll keep the answer simple, Overlord.  <br>The one with Albedo.  Both shows suck anyway. </br>  GATE manga &gt; Overlord anime &gt; Overlord manga &gt; GATE anime<br><br> reading light novels <br>Hahaha oh wow.</br></br></br>  <br>The only one that sucks here is  your mom .</br>  <br> &gt;Overlord manga <br>Never knew it existed, huh.</br></br>  <br> overlord manga <br><br>Not really fair, since its only 5 chapters in, you should be comparing to the light novel</br></br></br>  <br> Reading period <br>You should be ashamed.</br></br>  The one that is not a rushed one cour with original ending. Also loving these new meme about faggots pretending overshit is good  <br>GATE all the way.</br>   Overlord <br> Protagonist is supposedly Lawful Evil <br> First thing he does is Chaotic Good </br></br>  <br>Just because it isn't called an army, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</br>  <br>He didn't care about the village, but felt indebted to help them because based Touch Me rubbing off on Sebas</br>  <br> Overlord or Gate? <br><br>Which one has the better art?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better female cast?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has the better mc?<br> Overlord <br>Which one has a better opening or closing?<br> Overlord <br><br>That wasn't difficult.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br>Overlord, duh.<br>The only reason why people like the GATE anime is goth loli.</br></br>  <br>Foolish anon. He is extreme evil.<br>Every act of kindness towards humans is a carefully crafted deception.</br></br>  <br><br> /a/ says it's shit <br>Picked up.</br></br></br>  <br>Will ever the assburgers stop shiting threads?<br><br>Gate<br><br>I dont like edge lord MCs, and this is too much power fantasy.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br>Enjoy your SAO clone.</br></br>  <br> edge lord <br>Now there's that word again.</br></br>  <br><br>i will, thanks ;)</br></br>  Overlord<br>Got to give it some points for evil lich MC</br>  <br>Gate. I haven't saw the third episode of Overlord yet but nothing happen in the first two episode. Gate doesn't have pacing issue and it's really satisfying to see modern military not jobbing for once. Also it's 24 episodes instead of 12.</br>  <br>I'm with this guy. Too bad Overlord isn't two cours.</br>  Both are shit. Just watch Rokka no Yuusha  <br> not trusting the collective of /a/nons judgement <br> hownewru.jpg.tiff <br>GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation. Overlord is just a generic battle shonen with an edgy dumbass MC who gets the dick for doing nothing, not to mention it being an mmo shit.</br></br></br>  <br>What if the only reason you're acting like that is because you're actually nationalistic at heart and refuse to want to see other countries do it?</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch anyone of it.</br>  I've watched and read both.<br><br>Gate is about a middle aged guy trying to survive in the fantasy world.<br><br>Overlord is about a middle aged guy whose age stops mattering as the story goes on since it's the NPCs who run the story not him.</br></br></br></br>  Both dropped  <br>Worry not. He will become chaotic evil in no time.</br>  <br>look as a human Ainz was a good guy, but as time goes on the Extreme Evil that was his Lich will change his out look. he already doesn't care about human life</br>  <br> Gate <br> Source material <br> Not shit <br>It's a decent premise ruined by virtue of being little more than a vehicle for the author's fringe political views.</br></br></br></br>  <br>GATE because I'm not American</br>  <br>Nah you're just as right wing as he is, Amerifat.</br>  <br> I'm actually a pretty hard left by American standards. Not quite tumblr-SJW, but far enough. </br>  <br> implying you're not american <br> implying anyone is 'Murica's bitch. <br>Invading 3rd world shit places is all America can do, aside from humanitarians no one really gives a fuck about poor people being massacred. USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country.</br></br></br>  <br> USA wouldn't dare step foot into another 1st world country. <br>Because first world countries are, by definition, America and her allies. What country in their right mind would invade an ally?</br></br>  <br> China <br> Russia </br></br>  <br>overlord<br><br>are you 13?<br><br>overlord is edgy because the mc is an overdesigned skeleton?<br><br> first world countries </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are by definition Second World countries</br>  <br>Are second world countries, which are by definition the (former now) USSR and her allies.<br><br>Dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm having a lot of fun with both.<br>Maybe GATE though because Overlord seems to be moving along at a glacial pace.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Gonna be first world before long. America's just lying to herself</br></br></br>  <br>You need to get out of that cold war mentality, brah.</br>  <br>The terms first, second and third world were created by the US during the cold war to describe the alliances.<br>They are not objective measurements of the development of a nation.</br></br>  <br>You're the one throwing around outdated terms like "first world."</br>  <br><br><br> letting someone dictate what is good and what is bad <br><br>What a bunch of retarded sheep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anime industry responds to demand of politicians. </br>  Gate for action and watching military ass-rape roman armies, Overlord for being pretty interesting and wanting to see my childhood edgy online rpg fantasies come to realization.  <br>Overlord just got past the... know what? I'll make a list I guess<br><br>Overlord<br>Pros:<br>* I love the LN and like the manga<br>* Is not being censored as retardedly as GATE<br>* Is not about NIPPON STRONK<br>* Nice character designs, even if Albedo's armor bothers me<br>* Narberal Gamma (best girl)<br>Cons:<br>* The anime is being too slow by like 3 minutes each chapter. Or perhaps 3 minutes too short per chapter. It was late by 3 minutes, then 6, and now by 9. Makes me worried about ep4 being super rushed and skipping important stuff. This may or may not be valid depending on how it turns out. Maybe they will skip the intro and ED to compensate?<br><br>Not a lot of bad things, but it is stacking up on every episode. Let's see how bad it is by the end of ep4<br><br>GATE<br>Pros<br>* They improved Rori<br>* Just getting to the parts I love the most.<br>* Decent music so far. I hope for some sweet Ride of the Valkyries<br>* I liked Rerei's outfit more than the manga's<br><br>Cons<br>* Retarded censorship means they skipped the dragon attack on the elven village. We never got to see it eat elves and villagers, will probably not get to see most of the action scenes because of that<br>* Cute-ified characters. Even the fucking empeor got a facial lift-off and looks 10 years younger. Everyone looks 10 years younger- Not as bad as moeblobs, but dangerously close<br><br>Is really too soon to tell. Must wait for ep5 of each series, apparently</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are his views? I just saw it will probably have some anti-american propaganda, but that's rather common in anime.</br>  <br>Really? I like the OVERLOR LNs more than the GATE one. Unless you are thinking of the manga</br>  <br> with no reasoning as to how they accomplished it <br>Food, alcohol, pipe-weed. Within a century of the end of Return of the King, the world will secretly be ruled from the Shire.</br></br>  <br>I liked ep3 tho, but it was still too slow.<br><br>They should have started like the manga did, with the battle at Carne, and then do a flashback explaining how they got there</br></br></br>  Gate.<br><br>Overlord really surprised me during the first two episodes and the idea is really cool. Problem is, it gets wasted as soon as the actions start.<br><br>I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil.<br>I wanted Momonga to start a fucking kingdom not<br><br> hurr durr let's be adventurers </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Animation is also a big point. Gate &gt; Overlord on that</br>  <br> which doesn't give it an excuse to be full retard and a nip circle jerk <br>It's not. It's just pissed off right wing Amerifats like you who can't take it, and there's a lot.</br></br>  <br>Anime, Overlord<br>Manga wise, Gate<br>shield hero anime when?</br></br></br>  <br>Everybody is evil, I mean everyfriggin body</br>  <br>That reminds me of when someone asked "if you could be reborn in this very world right now, would you rather be reborn as a guy or a girl?" and i answered "it depends on location. Western first world country? girl. Give me easy mode on life for once. Anywhere else? guy, I dont wanna get shat on" and someone said that was retarded because women were suffering on India so why did I say life in wester 1st world countries was easy for women?<br><br> India <br> Western First World Country <br><br>Since fucking when?<br><br>China and Russia are 2nd world countries, by definition. Even if China is now the world's greatest economy, it is still a 2nd world country. Look up what 2nd world country actually means, please.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sebas-chan isnt</br>  <br>Im gonna assume you think "1st world" means "developed"<br><br>During the cold war, the americans and their allies thought the world was divided thus:<br><br>One side was america and its allies,<br>The other was russia and its allies<br><br>Thus, you had "two separate worlds" of politics and ideologies. 1st world, just means "america and its allies" and 2nd world just means "russia and its allies" but they were all considered modern and advanced countries to live in.<br><br>You are confusing politics with economics/sociology, and seem to think 1st world means "premium quality" or something like that. Its just a geographical and political division, that's all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There is too much "how it worked in the game" sequence in Overlord for my taste.<br><br>On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. Or as anything.</br></br></br>  <br> war is hell </br>  <br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br>Gate is not manga adaptation.</br></br>  <br>Both are absolute shit.<br>But Gate &gt; Overlord.<br>MMO anime is always worst in any comparison.</br></br></br>  <br> glacial pace <br>Its about four episodes per volume, if I'm lead to believe. The first volume was heavily laden with setting shit up, getting you interested in the cast and the situation, and ended on a huge note of  lich overlord killing the fuck out of angels </br></br>  <br> GATE is about politics and presents a "what-if" scenario where a world full of resources is presented to a modern nation <br>It's not. It's just an excuse to pit /k/ against fantasy for shits and giggles and that's great. Being an idiot is alright, being pretentious as well is just obnoxious.</br></br>  <br> what if the sky is blue </br>  <br>Diplomacy &gt; all, no man left behind etc, just obnoxious nazi bullshit like that<br><br>they should just nuke those filthy savage slavers. For humanitarian reasons, you know</br></br></br>  <br> I wanted Nazrick to be sieged by heroes and see how far they could get. <br>In the new world they are in, no one would get past the first damn floor. Even back in YGGDRASIL, 1500 players and NPCs raided Nazarick and were stopped dead at the 8th floor<br>  I wanted Momonga to get terribly infamous so everyone saw him as a catastrophe when in reality he's a pretty ok guy and the other countries are the real evil. <br>Ainz plans to do that in the second volume, he starts working as an adventurer in an attempt to create a heroic reputation, then drop the charade and give all credit to his true identity, thus spreading the name Ainz Ooal Gown far and wide. He's not looking to be an evil tyrant, he just wants to try and find other players in the new world. Also the other countries aren't evil, they have yet to be shown that way, they have some evil people inside, usually nobles and such, but the countries themselves aren't evil</br></br></br></br>   The story begins with Yggdrasil, a popular online game <br><br> however, the protagonist Momonga decides to not log out. Momonga is then transformed into the image of a skeleton as "the most powerful wizard <br><br> Even SAO tards laugh at this </br></br></br></br>  <br> Gate <br> pretentious <br>it's like you never watched or read it</br></br></br>  <br> no mention of lelei being ruined </br>  <br>Yeah, you are right, but I wasnt weighting one against the other, I was saying what I liked and disliked of each series individually. <br>If you want a "vs" point of view, let me see<br><br>Animation Gate++ (the dragon in the dirt cloud was simple but much better than the 3D stuff in OVERLORD(<br>Music Gate+<br>History Overlord++<br>Dialogue Overlord<br>Pacing Gate++<br>Character Designs Overlord+<br><br>So lets see...<br>Gate+++ total<br>Overlord++++ total<br><br>Dialogue went to overlord but by so small a margin I didnt really gave it a +<br><br>I would say overlord is slightly better than gate</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is not about NIPPON STRONK <br>I do not understand why do so many people get butthurt over this.</br></br>  <br>I'm talking about you, not gate. Or did you think I called gate an idiot? Come on, there's gotta be a limit to how dumb you can get.</br>  Which episode does Gate start showing the waifu's?  <br>Overlord, obviously.</br>  <br>I didnt think she was ruined. I know, shocking, right? someone has a different opnion than you!<br><br>Well, Im used to having different opinions on tastes, because tastes are like assholes. Everyone has one and thinks everyone ELSE's stinks but his.<br><br>That's why I never really go to war over "my tastes &gt; your tastes" comments. Im not saying your opinion is shit, im just saying I don't care about your taste because tastes are personal.<br><br>Maybe you don't like lemon pie.<br>I fucking love lemon pie<br><br>Would I get into an argument about lemon pie's greatness? <br><br>No</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Character Designs Overlord+ <br>I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. Meanwhile the B team working on Overlord can't decide on Albedo's proper proportions it threw me off. Also, it highlighted the bad thing about directly copying LN art.</br></br>  <br>All I know is that the MC is a fucking otaku which pretty much removes any credibility it could have had from the show.<br>You can't take it seriously if the MC is constantly surrounded by girls, is an otaku and still supposed to be some kind of soldier. It doesn't work well together.</br></br>  <br>All those things you want to happen? they all happen later in the novels. All of them</br>  <br> pretending to be above arguing taste <br> after writing that diatribe about taste <br> and already saying rori was improved <br>Of fucking course I love lemon pie, and my hand's reeked every time I've scratched my ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>People naturally recognize political agendas, but they become bothered when those agendas don't line up with their preferences or the status.</br>  <br><br>noice, no way they're gonna get animated though, right?</br></br>  <br>There are many otaku in the army anon. Hop over to /k/ and see how many answer you.<br><br>It's also not being brought up as much in the series, not like he's a hikkineet bastard.</br></br></br>  <br> Preferring a bunch of uninteresting looking human people to a cast of interesting and unique looking characters rarely presented as a main cast in an anime. </br>  <br>Might progress a chapter, maybe one and a half before it's all over at this pace.</br>  <br> shield hero anime when? <br>It has slavery, so never</br></br>  <br>It's 4 episodes per volume and the 1st volume was a glorified intro.</br>  <br>did you screw up your post?</br>  <br> Preferring well-animated tasteful designs over characters who suffer from animation deficiency due to canon material accuracy <br>Let me remind you what happened to Log Horizon<br> pic related <br>She looked so much better in S1 and that's with anime designs</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gate, better pasing, better girls, it's just better overall, it's a shame seeing how every gate thread it's ruined with amerifats</br>  <br>The anime is going to end at the end of volume 3, so in these 12-13 or so episodes we'll get<br> &gt;Ainz murdering the fuck out of angels<br> Ainz and Narberal becoming adventurers along with a group of no-names <br> Ainz and Narberal breezing through adventuring, slaughtering ogres and goblins with ease <br> Ainz and Narberal vs a necromancer and a crazy chick in a graveyard full of undead, which will include Narberal vs two skeleton dragons and Papa Bones giving someone a big warm hug <br> Spooky vampire slaughterfest <br> Ainz vs Shallchair <br> Possibly a cliffhanger concerning Ainz's plan to wipe out the Lizardmen </br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  WHEN DO THE GIRLS APPEAR IN GATE!  <br> Need to repay a debt <br> Might as well test my killing spells, too <br> I could easily resurrect the half of the village that was killed, but that would just be a hassle in the future <br><br>Truly a paragon of altruism.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll take shitty animation quality over dull as fuck character designs.</br>  <br>Sebajii believes there's good, don't mean he aren't gonna wreck yer shet</br>  I havent seen gate but overlord has been good.  <br> &gt;Ainz vs Shallchair <br>never gonna make it there, parts will be skipped and rushed like there's no tomorrow</br></br>  <br> The entire climax of volume 3 <br> In the fucking intro, not even just a small glimpse, but a big chunk of animation <br> Will be the climax to the anime itself <br>You are delusional if you think they'll skip or rush over it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>...<br><br><br>you real?<br><br><br>Gate is a LN adaptation, and it was cutified to death. If you read tvtropes, I would say it was spikified to death.<br><br>Gore is 97% gone<br>Mature characters? 100% gone<br>Violence? 90% gone<br><br>The problem with that is not "hurr durr not enough blood" but that by hiding some scenes completely, they had to cut out large chunks that were actually relevant to the story.<br><br>Have you seen people on youtube and their "live reaction" videos? I honestly enjoy watching those, I think they're hilarious. All my friends are into GATE manga, so I cant expect them to surprised or anything. The youtubers... they all hate reading, so they have fresh reactions, and they are all confused as fuck over a lot of things, because they were never shown or explained in the anime<br><br>Arrow on the dragon's eye? their comment was "did that elf chick shoot out its eye?"<br><br>Rori? "Oh my god she's an apostle of a dark god! she's gonna be the villain of the series! she's just luring them into a false sense of security"<br><br>Its really fun to watch, but also a little sad. The anime is doing a very poor job of telling the story because its skipping too many bits or it in order to hide its most violent parts</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mate, we get to see stuff like Cocytus vs. the lizardman chiefs, I doubt we'll get to there.</br>  <br>No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing. They're falling behind at a constant pace, so they've obviously taken a big chunk out at some point.</br>  <br>We're basically in the last part of volume 1 now, the only thing left is papa Bones chokeslamming angels and we're done with vol 1, we're getting 3 volumes at this pace.</br>  <br> No, they'll skip and rush everything up to it because they wasted 3 episodes doing nothing <br>That was what volume one was made of, majorly though. The battle at the village was near the end of the volume, and didn't involve much beyond Ainz shit stomping the soldiers and angels.</br></br>  <br>Again, I said it wasn't just a glimpse. It was a whole animated part, the reason they included Cocytus vs the lizardmen was because they needed a cool scene for him to be in, and till then he didn't have any scenes in the LNs. The anime will cover till the end of volume 3, thus it will cover Shalltear vs Ainz.</br>  <br>Hey your call man.<br><br><br>I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. If you really wanted uncensored Gate then you also better want the US getting bitchslapped every which way. You can't have one without the other. Japan did this for your own good and your ungrateful ass is complaining.<br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>I agree with the other things but this is wrong. Unless you're talking about character design, which I could give fuck all about. 18 year olds looked like 30s in Space Battleship Yamato, didn't stop me from enjoying it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How did he even manage to pump strength as spooky wizard? Can players grind stats after hitting the cap in Yggdrasil?</br>  <br> Mature characters? 100% gone <br>lmao.<br>Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation.</br></br></br>  <br>He's level 100 while they're like level 20, he can just punch them to death due to level difference.</br>  <br>Hes at the level cap, and even spell casters in YGGDRASIL, at level cap, had substantial strength, which translates even harder when put into the new world.</br>  <br> I disagree. Even if people think the character designs were raped in the anime, I still think Gate has the better drawn and animated characters. <br>That is true, which is why I gave Gate a ++ on animation.<br><br>Its characters ARE better animated, but that is not the same as "better designs".<br><br>The character designs in GATE are just moeblob humans, while the character designs in Overlord are interesting and unique creatures, with a few jokes thrown in that most people didnt notice.<br><br>Aura and Mare being a trap and a reverse trap makes me smirk<br>Demiurge wearing a swagger-full powersuit in a medioeval world<br>Shalltear name is basically "I shall tear you apart" but people don't seem to notice.<br><br>Plus, they are all "evil guys" which you usually don't get to see as the protagonists of anything. It reminds me of playing Dungeon Keeper and thats a big plus on my book<br><br>So I really have to give Overlord the edge on character designs.<br><br>You want to say "oh but they are better ANIMATED in Gate"? I agree, but that's animation, not character designs</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sounds like they went in the right direction and saved the anime adaptation. <br>Would have saved it even more if they animated soldier dialog with more kyaaaaa and naniiiiii comedic reactions. Instead we get happy soldier banter which none of our non-/k/ friends get and call it boring.</br></br>  <br>Because it breaks my suspension of disbelief too hard. And this comes from a fantasy novels author</br>  <br>Man if only character designs were animated well too.<br><br>I brought up Log Horizon by DEEN in another post which proves my point. It doesn't matter to me if the design in the adaptation has been taken artistic liberty with, all it matters to me is that it moves seamlessly.<br><br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime yet the animation might as well be stickmen in a flipbook. That's just how I roll.<br><br>I also didn't agree with dialog going to Overlord fwiw.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains?<br>widen your worldview fatty</br></br>  <br>That sounds like a bullshit excuse to me anon.</br>  I feel like the two of them are completely different in themes but share a common design with the "Fantasy world" thing.<br><br>But both of them are looking like solid contenders for AOTS so far. I'll enjoy both.</br></br>  <br>3<br><br>I am saying "I like Rori" and also "but my taste is mine and yours is yours, and im not going to argue about my preferences being better than yours or yours being better than mine, because there is no such thing as better when it comes to taste"<br><br>Hell, I enjoy classic music, and still havent gotten over a punk kid going into my hobby shop, buying a manga and asking me with a straight face "aren't you ashamed of listening to fag american music?" while I was playing some Mozart on the audio system.<br><br>He enjoyed rap<br><br>I like Rori. You dont like Rori? ask me if I care<br>But I can say "I like X" and also say "I dont care enough to argue over it" in the same post<br><br>Im not arguing about if X character is better or not, btw, im arguing that, indeed, i dont argue about "my tastes are better".<br><br>You like red soda? i like green soda. Am I gonna argue about which one is superior? no<br><br> Implying green soda isnt so much better <br><br>That was a joke, btw. Im explaining that because you dont seem very fast or very good at reading comprehension.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One Piece has the best character designs I've seen in anime<br>Are you even trying?</br></br>  <br> calling Overlord an SAO clone because there was kinda sort of a MMO setting in the first act and never again <br><br>god I hate this meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you saying it's not? Top tier aesthetics and character designs, all larger than life<br><br>The villains shtick you praise Overlord for, One Piece already did for 19 years.</br></br></br>  <br> another wall of text <br>hope you proofread it, because no one else will bother slugging through it</br></br>  <br> wall of text <br>Best be trolling.</br></br>  <br>One Piece... really? well, they're at least original, I'll give you that.<br><br>And about moving seamlessly... are you watching the RAWs? because I am, and they move fine. If you are watching it on Funimation, you should know that Funi fucked up the drame rate and Overlord looks like shit through them, and through the groups that ripped their eps from them.<br><br>Check out the episodes you saw. Do they say "Funimation" at the beginning? if so, go and watch the RAWs. They look so much better on that sense.<br><br>But the reason im giving the animation point to gate is because while watching both RAWs, I just think the 3D in overlord doesnot blend seamlessly enough with the traditional style.<br><br>The staff of Ainz Oal Gown bothers me a lot. It clearly stands out of place. The Death Knight blended in nicely, though, so maybe it was on purpose to make its power stand out? if that's the case, it was a decision I would have voted no against.<br><br>But seriously, see if the eps you watched have "funimation" at the beginning. Funi is fucking overlord, big time</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hey<br><br>you<br><br>stop<br><br><br>it<br><br>every<br><br>word<br><br>doesn't need<br><br>its<br><br>own <br>line</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>All I see is "I have no arguments so now I will fling shit and hope you give up and go away"</br></br></br>  <br>You still watch Pokemon, do you?</br>  <br>Idiot confusing evil alignments with Chaotic Stupid. Evil characters are not suddenly barred from committing acts that aren't genocide.</br>  <br>/thread</br>  <br>You did say Overlord had interesting and unique creatures which is the point of One Piece character designs. And they're also original as fuck even if you don't like it.<br><br>I do watch both RAW and Funimation. I'd still give animation to Gate.<br><br>Now, what's the reason you give dialog to Overlord as well? I didn't think it was any different to most light novels out there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, apparently we are getting up to volume 4 and those things happen from volume 5 of the light novel and onward.Maybe a 2nd season?<br><br>In b4<br> madhouse <br> 2nd season <br>jokes</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad to see you fixed your enter key.</br>  <br>they already did</br>  One is about Papa Bones<br><br>The other isn't</br></br>  <br>Why not both? <br>It's not like your time is valuable anyway.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why you're telling me things I already know. <br><br> On the other hand GATE anime failed as an adaptation. <br> Gate is not manga adaptation. <br><br>Because gate IS an adaptation, and your post made it look like you did not know the LN or the manga already exist.<br><br>Someone else said "Gate failed as an adaptation"<br>You said "Gate is not an adaptation"<br><br>It comes from either the LN or the manga (I would say the LN) but either way, its an adaptation</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for your own good <br>Im Chilean, I dont give a fuck if USA gets bitchslapped. In fact, I would point and laugh</br></br>  <br> anime adaptation <br> Overlord <br> The trap brown elf raping some slut will never be show in anime adaptation <br>JUST</br></br></br></br>  <br>I <br><br>dis<br><br>a <br><br>gree</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did those bastards just made a knot to her scarf? the rascals!</br>  <br>No, I said what I meant I said. Gate is not a manga adaptation. It's a light novel adaptation.<br><br>It was me telling people to stop expecting things out of the manga to be in the anime, it ain't happening.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They improved Rori <br> Rori has cat ears <br> improved </br></br></br>  <br>Its explained in the LN that he's at level cap and he couldnt keep pumping int or spellcasting any higher, so he raised str with all his unused bonus points. <br><br>So yes, hes incredibly strong</br></br></br>  <br>They'll show a brown elf taking an adventurer clubbing.</br>  <br> you can't believe that japanese soldiers can't be competent and americans can be villains? <br>Oh I believe all of that<br><br>PS: Your shitty grammar fucked your argument. Read it over and over until you spot the problem</br></br></br></br>  <br>All skills get a couple of levels on levelup, so even a pure STR warrior will have somewhat good stack of INT and such. Rest of the power comes from the armor and the weapons that are summons and even take slice of their power from INT.</br>  <br>You clearly don't know what "wall of text" means.</br>  <br>Its all trash, but at least Overlord is mildly enjoyable</br>  <br>You are exaggerating and using hyperbole. Does that mean you ran out of real arguments?</br>   Overlord <br> GATE <br> Monster Musu me <br><br>You can't fool me, Japan<br>Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> widen your worldview fatty <br>this must have struck a chord</br></br>  <br> Stop trying to give me a monster girl fetish <br>Just accept it anon, the grass is a lot greener on this side</br></br>  <br>Your loss nigga. <br><br>Goddamn I want to fuck an elf.</br></br></br>  <br>Look at that and tell me she isn't asking for it</br>  <br>I also gave the animation to GATE. Did you pay attention? are you arguing because somehow you thought I gave animation to Overlord?<br><br>I gave designs to overlord, and animation to Gate<br><br>I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs.<br><br>I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing<br><br>You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. May as well try ti defend the dialogue in 50 Shades of Grey, Holy Cow!<br><br>Seriously, there's puns and subtle jokes in overlord, which you may have missed, while there's lines so retarded in gate, that thinking about them may lower your IQ by 10 points or so<br><br>I smiled at tje otaku references, but a reference is not wit, its just pandering to the masses and having them go "oh he said waifu lololololol"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Rori has cat ears <br><br>Those are ribbons</br></br></br>  <br>I bet you like grass you cowfucker.</br>  <br>Ribbons that simulate catears.</br>    <br>Your loss man, cows are good.</br>  <br>I own both novel series, and like them both.<br>But I have to say Gate is a lot more entertaining in the long run, Overlord kinda lost its steam after the "lol kill all these adventurers aren't I edgy :DDDD" volume 7.<br>Gate kinda lost its steam with the Gaidens, but the last volume (not counting Gaiden +) gives us hope that season 2 will be a good read.<br><br>Anime? I can't say, I think Gate has a better start, but Overlord hasn't even gotten to the good shit yet. I'll decide once the season is over.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh, alright. Your grammar just made it impossible to understand that out of your post, though.<br><br>By the way<br>  I said what I meant I said <br>makes no fucking sense either.<br><br>I'm not a grammar nazi, but at some point, you have to draw a line. When your post is impossible to understand, you clearly crossed that line. May as well have written "I climb up down to the same floor" because that doesn't has a lick of sense either</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*shrug*</br>  <br>I don't get why people get so worked up about that line. Sure it had funny delivery but it's not like it's wrong. Pretty unlikely they'd be chinese or russian special forces.</br>  <br>But I like her stocking and skirt more now than before, so to me they improved her.<br><br>Since I dont care about the ribbons, its a PLUS and a "whatever" so it comes out as a PLUS</br></br></br>  <br>what, is the whole doujin in full color?</br>  <br>Getting there but not quite. Some people are coloring it.</br>  <br>It's not that she isn't asking for it, it's that you don't plan on marrying her afterwards.</br>  About the same, but<br><br> Overlord: total sales 400k <br> Gate: total sales 2,400k <br><br>I would say Gate on the sheer fact it's more likely to keep on going and get new seasons than Overlord.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> doujin <br><br>It's not a doujin.</br></br></br>  <br>Also at the Current pace overlord would need several more seasons to cover all the content.<br><br>I'd be surprised if it gets another season, but three seasons? There's a time to keep your head in the cloud and a time to wake up.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you mad that you fucked yourself, and yet too ameriretard to spot where it happened?<br><br>Realy, until you point out where it happened, I can't take you seriously anymore because if your words make no sense, how could I possibly take you seriously?</br></br></br>  <br> I gave dialogue to Overlord because I read both LNs. <br>You fucking liar.<br><br> I wonder if they will have "oh look these unidentified commando troops must be american because they're black. Everyone knows only americans have black people" in the Gate anime as it did on the LN and the manga. It would make me piss my pants laughing <br>No, I think it just pissed you off.<br><br>That line makes sense in context since Japan only considered 3 countries to attack them which is Russia, China, and USA. Unless black people are somehow popular now in Russian and Chinese SF (not saying they're not everywhere, just that these countries aren't US level of heterogeneity) it's an acceptable if not racist conclusion.<br> You just cant defend the dialogue of something with a line like that. <br>I can? Just because your american sensibilities can't take it doesn't mean it's indefensible<br><br>Stop criticizing Gate it's clear you know shit about it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Albedo vs Shalltear: Who would win?  <br>At this pacing how many episodes would be necessary to cover the entire series?<br>It's kinda crazy to imagine it even happening.</br></br>  <br>Shallchair on the virtue of her lifedraining abilities.<br><br>Albedo is all defense</br></br></br>  Web originated novel sales (M = million copies)<br>Only listing the ones that got anime adaptations. <br><br>Sword Art online 14M<br>Mahouka koukou no Rettousei 5.6M<br>Gate JSDF 2.4M<br>Log Horizon 1M<br>Overlord 0.4M<br>RE:Zero less than 0.1M</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shalltear hands down.</br>  <br>At the pacing it's going it should have had 24 eps.</br>  <br>But as a defensive character doesn't Albedo have the equivalent of rM++++ though?<br><br>Not that Shalltear is a one-trick pony or anything but if she can't gimp Albedo then I see Albedo fucking her up bigtime.</br></br></br>  <br> You fucking liar. <br>http://www.mediafire.com/download/s<wbr>ag6vj0hzt67l5e/JSDF+001.odt<br><br>There you go, the GATE Light Novel. Be warned that its somewhat butchered because I was using cut to get parts to translate instead of copy for a while, without noticing.<br><br> No, I think it just pissed you off. <br>No, it made me laugh a lot. Im Chilean, not amerifat<br><br> That line makes sense in context since Japan only considered 3 countries to attack them which is Russia, China, and USA <br><br>No, if they thought only 3 countries were attacking, and one force was full of russians while the other was full of asians, the third may as well be aliens and they would still have had to arrive at the conclusion that they were americans, simply by default<br><br>Oh look, I have these three cards.

It wouldnt matter which color those guys were.<br><br>It was a stupid line, and it showed the japanese racism as clearly as a full frontal nudity shot shows an actor's junk. It was hilarious<br><br> american sensibilities <br>Sorry, not amerifat. It was hilarious to people from everywhere, man<br><br> know shit about it <br>I know who I am NOT going to ever give a copy of the novel I worked so hard to translate, to.

I've been searching for the web version but couldn't find it anywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Americunts thinking Japan doesnt have a military. JSDF is actually in the top 10 militaries in the world and 2 (maby not anymore but sitll near the very top) economic power. <br>About Otaku in the military JSDF launched the while idol campaign to lure them in. It increased the number of recruits by 20%.</br></br>  <br> It increased the number of recruits by 20%. <br>I refuse to believe this. They can't be that stupid.</br></br>  <br>Well for an Otaku with no perspectives is actually a pretty comfy and secure job. I would sign up too lol.</br>  <br>No, im really sorry but like I said, I had been using cut instead of copy for a while and accidentally erased a fair bit while doing that, Im really sorry<br><br>I -may- have a virgin copy somewhere in my HD but if so, its somewhere really deep and forgotten and im much too blind to look for it, literally, sorry man<br><br>Do you have a text copy of the LN?npt a ´hysical copy. Im too blind for reading paper anymore. Need to ctrl+mousewheel to be able to read anything these days</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>iono, they get plenty of down times and the moeny aren't bad</br>  <br>Isn't America nudging Japan to have better military so they can help keep China in check? And of course China is politely threatening them to keep docile or else.</br>  <br>Gate had the absolute worst first episode I've ever seen. Stay far away.</br>  <br> machine translations <br>You're as bad as the guy who's translating Knights and Magic with shit grammar. Just stop, certain nuances will never get picked up with Bing and GT. Just wait until someone picks it up.<br> Im Chilean <br>So why are you mad over just that one line?<br> retarded analogy <br>If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China.<br>They didn't expect the US and immediately stopped fighting when they realized they killed an ally.<br>The line was spur of the moment.<br>It was stupid, but it's not entirely unrealistic since people are racist.<br>How you equated that to 50 shades of unrealistic S&amp;M is beyond me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nah, unfortunately my collection is all physical. <br>I'm skimming through your file, and yeah, it seems completely out of order. <br><br>But I'm more amazed at how different it is... almost nothing stayed the same, the novel edition is pretty much a complete re-write. Other than the Flame Dragon encounter, everything else is completely different, might as well consider them separate books. <br><br>It's kinda fascinating to see the original, it's almost like reading a draft or storyboard of a manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> reading the web novel version <br> completely different from the published novel version, manga, and light novel <br>No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet.</br></br></br>  <br>It worked for the air force with TOP GUN</br>  <br> No the text copy of the LN is not available anywhere on the internet. <br><br>It took me 5 seconds of search to find it. <br>Anon did you even try looking<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?%20%20page=sear<wbr>ch&amp;cats=2_13&amp;filter=0&amp;term=%E3%82%B<wbr>2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88%20%E8%87%AA%E8%<wbr>A1%9B%E9%9A%8A%E5%BD%BC%E3%81%AE%E5<wbr>%9C%B0%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A6%E3%80%81%E<wbr>6%96%AF%E3%81%8F%E6%88%A6%E3%81%88%<wbr>E3%82%8A</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> machine translations <br>whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit.<br><br><br> So why are you mad over just that one line? <br> Mad <br>Ive said multiple times that I am not. I think its hilarious<br><br><br> If you fucking really read the novels, you'd know Japan expected only Russia and China. <br>You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry<br><br>And yes, the racism oozing out of it made me laugh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Oh sorry, "text" you say. Didn't realize you can't read moon at all.  <br>Shit or shit?</br>  <br>nothing like anything seen in the past for the first 3 episodes, nothing similar in it's concepts in the future.. why do faggots that know nothing about anime series exist in /a/</br>  <br>We are, some Japanese politicians are also considering changing the constitution to alter or remove Article 9 and allow Japan to start maintaining a standing army, or at the very least being able to help their allies (Korea, USA, etc.) in case of attack. Honestly I think they need to just throw it out all together, renouncing war may sound all fine and dandy, but once you don't have some big superpower backing you up it just makes you a target, and they're already violating both the letter and spirit of the article by maintaining the JSDF. So really what's the point of keeping it around anymore?</br>  <br>Granted Overlord has many conceptual similarities to SAO, but Gate?<br>Gate is completely nothing like SAO other than sharing the same animation studio doing the adaptation.</br></br>  <br>I want to squeeze those boobs really hard.</br>  <br>heh, yeah, i get that feeling a lot whenever I read a book in spanish and then find the original, too. It must be a lot heavier when you read the gate LN and then the WN. <br><br>My japanese is not good enough yet to read a whole book on it without checking shit with GT, but I get that feeling when reading stuff in french or english after reading it in spanish<br><br>Also, as a former owner of a bookstore/hobby shop, its nice seeing someone has physical copies.<br><br>I used to also have a photocopy machine, and I was just awed when someone came by and asked me for copies of a 300 pages book.<br><br>"Sir, each photocopy its 50 pesos a page. This book is 300 pages"<br>"So?"<br>"So, copying the book would be 15000 pesos. I sell this very book for 8700 pesos, wouldnt you prefer to own the original?"<br>"You are just trying to sell me something, just copy it, alright?"<br>"But its cheaper"<br>"Just copy it, im not gonna fall for it"<br><br>Its as if people was afraid of owning books or something<br><br>Man, I miss reading actual paper books</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aren't those scans of the novel? we are talking about text files</br>  <br> whats wrong with checking for words here and there? its how yiou learn shit. <br>It's because it's not quality. I ain't reading gibberish. Better to wait for quality translations than pure machine.<br><br> You just said they expected 3 countries, russia, china and america. This is a text board, I can scroll up and check your post, you cant just take back shit you said and pretend you did not say it. Sorry <br>Expected and considered are two different things. They considered the US since Dirrell called them but didn't expect him to actually go through with it. Check it again, I didn't say anything contradictory.<br><br>Also if you really knew that why didn't you raise it up earlier?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its funnier to watch you self destruct<br><br>Is what I wish I would say but honestly I dont remember. I fucking love reading, I cant remember every line of every book ive read 15+ books ago<br><br>Yes, some people enjoy reading.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> lel jokes on you i was trolling <br>Remind me again why you consider SAO-level dialogue is better than Gate's because of one line</br></br>  <br>You clearly lack reading comprehension. Bye</br>  <br>Is it bad that I watch GATE just so that I'd have a proper knowledge about it to be able to shitpost in the threads more effectively?</br>  <br><br>See, this is what happens when you're being an idiot. He'd already said he's mexican, there was no sense in pursuing it further.</br></br>  <br>There are stubborn people everywhere. <br><br>.... *reads 57* ... wait WHAT<br> <br>Tyuule doesn't die, and ends happily ever after with Furuta!?<br>WHY THE FUCK did he change her fate to be so tragic, what the hell!?<br/></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>That depends.<br>One of them is an SAO clone with the shittiest cast I've ever seen and the other one is pretty much a good adaptation that tackles modern political issues and also high fantasy stuff.<br>One is mature while the other one is something only 13-year-olds would enjoy.<br>You know which one is better.</br></br></br></br>  GATE is fun as a completely retarded trainwreck.<br>Overlord is actually pretty good and interesting. Papa bones is a good MC.</br>  watched the first 3 episodes, but I still don´t understand.<br>is he trapped inside a game? or is a human in a different world or what? shit was so boring my mind was just drifting trough the episodes.</br>  <br> tackles modern political issues <br> mature <br>Yeah, like whether to fuck the goth loli, catgirl or elf first thing after blowing up a dragon. Oh, or the dark elf. Shit that's deep.<br><br>It's fun but for fuck sake man get over yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think good is subjective here</br>  <br>He's "trapped" nowhere anon. He's in a skeleton body now in a new world.</br>  <br>The GMs and devs decided to mess with the only guy left over while the game was shutting down.<br>They changed his UI and took direct command of the NPCs he's interacting with to make interaction more convincing.</br></br>  <br>So far he's been pretty good. I like his transition from a normal human being to an actual spooky skeleton in body and mind.</br>  <br>Diplomacy is half the fun, why the hell would you complain about it?</br>  <br> it's harem <br> mc must be thinking of fucking them <br>MC doesn't think like that in the first season at all</br></br></br>  <br> Itami  <br> Ever thinking about fucking them <br><br>You clearly have not read the book have you.<br>The guy will run away from pussy at every chance.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> another beta MC <br>DROPPED at least Papa Bones doesn't run from pussy<br> does he? </br></br></br>  <br>Itami is far from a beta. He just has his priorities straight....kinda.</br>  <br><br>His libido is very low, bearing non-existent, because he's a lich, so he ignores the two girls that want his dick.</br></br>  <br>are you completely fucking braindead? did it not cross your mind even one goddamn time that the post, and the question posed in the post it's a direct fucking reply to might somehow be related?</br>  <br> Granted Overlord has many conceptual similarities to SAO <br>Not really; it pretty much begins and ends with the "protag somehow gets trapped in a fantasy MMO" justification for the events of the show.</br></br>  <br><br>At least Itami has a valid reason, being a recent divorcee, it'd make sense if he wanted to not be engaged in any relationships, doesn't help that a lot of the bitches that want his dick are kinda crazy.</br></br>  <br>He's undead; his sex drive is virtually nonexistent.<br><br>Of course he could probably fix that with spells if he wanted to, but still.</br></br></br>  <br>Crazy? I don't know where you got that from.</br>  Actually haven't watched a single episode of GATE, yet. The manga is great.<br><br>Overlord is an excellent show, though.</br></br>  <br> posting the elf with literal delusions <br>Anon...</br></br>  <br>Finally, an actual primary in the thread.</br>  <br> what is sarcasm  <br><br>although I realize sarcasm is hard to convey through text.</br></br></br>  <br> Manga <br> Pirmary </br></br>  <br>it's primary as far as I'm concerned.</br>  <br>Somebody said that the webnovel doesn't exist anymore, so manga could be considered to be promoted as primary.</br>  <br>Didn't check GATE, Overlord is good so far.<br>Reminds me of both Log Horizon and HeXen.</br></br>  <br>The manga is an adaptation of the novel, not the webnovel.</br>  <br>His character is Lawful Evil, but the player who took over himself is Good-aligned<br>So yeah, he's playing out of his role, but there's no distinction between player and character in his case anymore</br></br>  <br> Lawful Evil <br> Ainz <br><br>kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>man that whole elf arc was so fucking shitty</br>  <br>Albedo has 2 world class items. Shalltear got fucked by one. Do the math.</br>  <br>eh, ending wasn't too bad. But everything else was a drag.</br>  <br>Shalltear, although maybe Albedo would catch on faster if she gets more fighting experience.</br>  <br>yes it was<br> yous gots to shoot the dragons to go un-nuts <br>well, after that it was mostly fine but that crap just dragged on and on and on</br></br></br>  <br>I think un-nuts is my new favorite word today.</br>  <br>Chaotic evil is not "more evil" than lawful evil if that's what you're trying to imply.<br>"Extreme" is too relative a term anyways.<br>To be honest we don't know how far he sways towards lawful or chaotic.

What matters now is that China is getting stronger every day and the US is getting weaker, it's more important for our national interests that Japan be a strong military power than some moral high ground or caution due to past actions. Besides WW2 was over 70 years ago, most of the people that orchestrated and participated in it are dead, time to let it go.</br></br>  <br>Agree with this</br>  Both are generic, OverLord is the more fun one to watch though.

Even if they did, not to the extent of what the Japanese did. Unit 731, Nanking, pretty much every POW camp (If you'd even call it that) owned by the Japanese. Can't think of many countries that ran around cutting the dicks off people and shoving them in the mouth of the corpses. <br><br>Not to mention, there's still Japanese politicians who deny any of these things occurred and try to shut down Japanese museums that highlight the atrocities. You don't "let it go". You remember it so it doesn't happen again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about Overlord VS GATE?<br><br>Magic VS Science?</br></br>  <br>Quick battle?

In reality Ainz would come off as a powerful soldier and worm his way up the command chain until he's sitting beside ol' Abe personally revising the trade agreement that gives him full control of the GATE and all resources to be transported between them.<br><br>And Narberal is in the background being a retard.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe he wanted to darken the setting even more?<br><br>Some men just want to watch the world burn.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It will repeat, you can't change that, it is unlikely to be the japanese next time though.</br></br>  <br>Gatelord</br>  <br><br>there is a Vex Animu?<br><br>Cute Hobgoblins doing cute Hobgoblin things?</br></br></br></br>  <br> not adhering to /a/core <br> /a/core <br>Is their some written book or do you decide for the entire group?</br></br></br>  <br>I'd watch an anime about cute robots trying to rewrite the timestream.</br>  <br> Maybe, maybe not <br>The fuck is that suppose to mean? Every single major participant in World War 2 committed atrocities against their enemies, it's a documented fact. Did the Germans and Japanese commit more? Most certainly yes, that doesn't make everyone elses crimes less heinous.<br><br>Anyway, the point is, it doesn't matter what crimes they committed in the past, no one with any kind of power gives a shit, because in the end it's better for us if they're a strong regional power. Even if for some unfathomable reason Japan decided to go ape shit again and start committing butchery on a massive scale, the US wouldn't give a damn because we typically don't give a shit what our allies do as long as it can't be traced back to us.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You forgot one.<br><br>Which one shows gore/violence?<br> Overlord <br><br>I only say that because Gate is censored as fuck comparatively to the manga. Fuck A-1 studios and their moe shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Overlord. Couldn't even finish the first episode of Gate.  <br>How does Overlord anime top the manga? In my opinion the art is better in the manga and I don't have to look at CG.</br>  <br><br>the one with the best girl</br></br>  <br>Cute!</br>  <br>Overlord is slightly censored too, and I'm willing to bet they will censor the fuck out of Ainz's hug time and Shalltear's raping the rapists.</br>  <br> I only say that because Gate is censored as fuck comparatively to the manga. Fuck A-1 studios and their moe shit. <br><br>You're right in that they moe-fied the females to appeal to otakus. I go by the manga in Gate, and they had a more adult look to them. So that is what I was expecting, which fits the military theme. Overlord adaptation tries to stay faithful as much as possible, while the Gate adaptation gives of the feeling that changes were made for the audiences sake, not because the content wouldn't translate well to a visual format.<br><br>Gate vs Overlord?<br><br>Papa Bones wins.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm kinda worried about Overlord's run time. It's supposedly 13 episodes and there's a lot of detail that goes on. If it was up to the shalltear fight, it would make sense but we get Lizardman army battle too? That Lizardmen village has a lot going on in it, from their own skill sets, to how they live, to their politics, their high class warriors, not to mention how they live and where geographically, plus the romance. Lizardmen arc could easily encompass 3 episodes by itself.<br><br>I'm skeptical and anxious.</br></br></br></br>  <br> there's still Japanese politicians who deny any of these things occurred and try to shut down Japanese museums that highlight the atrocities. <br><br>And those are the old fucks that everyone hates who are only in office because the younger generation has pretty much given up on politics. Majority of japanese opinion on the atrocities committed is to not bring it up in fear of divine retribution. <br><br><br> while the Gate adaptation gives of the feeling that changes were made for the audiences sake, not because the content wouldn't translate well to a visual format. <br>No, it's the content. Expect more harem antics and less politics. <br><br>What's more surprising is that /a/ had agreed that the GATE adaptation would be shit because of the more right-wing views years before the anime was announced but still acts like this over it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually having a character that has a ton of backstory that canonically affects her personality, part of which was fucked up by Momonga, is really scary.</br>  <br>DON'T YOU GIVE ME YOUR LOVE AND PASSION.</br>  <br> anything other than harem comedies and staring at our own shoes is right-wing <br><br>Is it really that much of a stretch to think that the modern Japanese military is more sophisticated and more well-meaning than feudal society in medieval fantasy?</br></br></br>  <br>Are you implying that Overlord is actually good? if so you should kill yourself.</br>  <br><br>dat ed</br></br>  So, how is the Gate manga?  <br>no you</br>  <br>Sire, please put bait on your hooks before casting the line, the fishes need to eat.</br>  <br>Both seem to be worth watching so far.</br>  <br>If you would squint hard enough to pretend the Japan STRONK wasn't there, or at least a country of your choice then its a pretty fun read. The way the army works seems kinda weird, but just gloss over the small details and you'll be fine.</br>    <br> anything other than harem comedies and staring at our own shoes is right-wing <br>The "leftists" of Japan hate the idea of militarization so much that they throw homemade grenades and fire bottle rockets at American bases. They have also been caught doing this to their own JSDF even during parades and other events. <br><br> Is it really that much of a stretch to think that the modern Japanese military is more sophisticated and more well-meaning than feudal society in medieval fantasy? <br>Not really, no. Its been pointed out several times how people take things out of context or blatantly give false information to fuel their shitposting. Take the whole "Will the JSDF commit an atrocity like other world powers?" thing, it's obvious the guy doesn't consider the JSDF to be the Imperial Army but shitposters will go on and on about it being whitewashed when that isn't the case.<br><br>Really, GATE isn't even Japan stronk like shitposters want you to believe, it's basically JSDF Stronk with the joke being they have American mil-tech.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The OP showed the lizard man fight and Sebas about to slap down in a city setting which is volume 5 &amp; 6, so I'm guessing they are just showing it for fan service, rather than planning to actually cover it. It will probably end on the Chair fight.<br><br>Or maybe there is a god and it's actually 26 episodes</br></br></br>    <br> Or maybe there is a god and it's actually 26 episodes <br><br>Anon, please don't lie.

So far overlord has it, but we're only 3 episodes in to summer, anything could happen.</br>  <br>The heroic arc is so old-fashioned. Modern audiences want a travelogue where the MC easily overcomes all obstacles and is the best and most popular person ever.</br>  <br>Why not both?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128439016 <br>I like it so far, even despite the le MMO is now real starting point. Either it's ok or I finally developed the shit taste that's so necessary to enjoy anime.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128439016 <br>Albedo and Shalltear hit on Ainz an mention stuff like wanting to have his children, and there's a few instances of other characters being attracted to Ainz or saying something sexual. Also lizard sex at one point. But that all is a pretty small portion of the books and it's mostly about Papa Bones being paranoid about the world or fucking with people in the world.<br><br>After reading the Gate manga I'd say Gate has more than Overlord.</br></br></br>  <br> american "leftism" <br> real leftism <br>ayy</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128440048 <br> reddit is now right-wing puppets <br>jew pls go and stay go</br></br>  I like both, because as improbable as it sounds, it's pretty easy to like everything. GATE is skipping over things and isn't as violent as the Manga/LN, but come the fuck on. Who didn't see that coming? What other show does that level of violence on air in the last two years? As for the designs, they're growing on me, but I don't like how "busy" they are. Elf is fine, and Itami is Itami. As for the mature themes it's skipping, are we talking about the same series here? What part of if makes it "mature"?  <br>I'm liking overlord a lot , I was expecting a Gary stuu but got something actually interesting instead .</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128440346 <br>We aren't on reddit, so my point still holds</br>  <br>We aren't /pol/ either</br>  Are mods being faggots again or what the fuck is going on?  <br> What part of if makes it "mature"? <br>If you're talking about Gate, it's easy to see why it's mature, and I don't like justifying when something is mature as if it's supposed to be the best criteria for judging anime.</br></br>  Overlord goes nowhere for at least 5 volumes. <br>At least in Gate things are happening and the surroundings are changing through the interaction of the humans.</br>  <br> China <br> greatest economy <br><br>Their bubble is in the process of popping and to slow down the recession they started arresting stock brokers and traders so they couldn't sell bad stocks<br><br>China's economy is artificially stable</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Overlord wins in literally every category but animation quality.  <br> 2 episode until he forces his prisoners to cannibalism </br>  <br>Whether it's America or Japan jerking itself off, it's always annoying and just makes you roll your eyes.</br>  <br>Overlord, easily.</br>  <br> The "leftists" of Japan hate the idea of militarization so much that they throw homemade grenades and fire bottle rockets at American bases. <br>Good. America needs to get the fuck out and mind their own fucking business.</br></br>  <br>Consider onepunchman.<br><br>Wildly popular with an MC stated from the first page to be unbeatable.<br><br>Still has tons of tension and character development that can only be beaten by madara uchiha.<br><br>Why? Because the focus of the individual arcs is not the MC and his crew. Each arc focuses instead on the characters that can and would normally lose and their struggle.<br><br>The main character, whether it's saitama or a skeleton lord, is just there as a catalyst for the growth and the development of his allies and enemies as they face an overwhelming power that they can't hope to beat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't compare both of them. Overlord while the smaller franchise, is aimed at the SAO audience.<br><br>Gate while the bigger franchise, is not aimed at the SAO audience which is why they had to tone it down. Too much toning down in my opinion.</br></br></br>  <br>This was animated right? I wish I remember the name.</br>   whoof   <br> slut </br>   jpg   SUKOOOOO  <br> gif </br>  Dropped it at Episode 7.

You get answers, but you have to interpret them.<br><br> why was she in a nightclub? <br> The explanation that makes the most sense to me as to why her alt personality first appeared in Cyberia is that the Knights were impersonating her somehow, both messing with the Accela guy and contributing to Lain's existential crisis. The only other explanation that would work is that Lain, having manifest her alt personality, went to Cyberia and doesn't remember it. But why would this be true? The existence of multiple Lains is a red herring, as her alt personality is the part of her that's connected to the wired. A YouTuber suggested that this came out for her in Cyberia because it implemented KIDS in its music, and I suppose with Taro's revelation that the music had some sort of altering of memories it could make sense. <br><br> what are those two fags with the futuristic glasses up to? <br> they are hired by Tachibana labs. They are under the impression that they are trying to stop Eiri's plans from coming to life by keeping an eye on Lain, but in reality, their client turned out to be working toward Eiri's goal <br><br> why has she a talent for computers all of a sudden? <br> You can say it's "innate" because of her nature. She awakens it and becomes interested as a human because it allows for her to interact with people in a more comfortable manner than face to face communication. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if she is secretly the lewdest one of them all?  <br>she's going to be pregnant so yes.</br>  <br>It's not a what if it's that the actual situation.</br>  <br>She's going to bear a child so yes</br>  <br><br>who's the father? the mc?</br></br>    <br>That's clear at the end of last episode</br>  <br> You'll never give a blowjob to Kajou under the table </br>  <br>That's not a very good secret since everyone knows this already</br>  <br><br>wait what, sauce please</br></br>  <br>She's the only girl I would suck her dick if she was a futa</br>  <br> she's going to be pregnant so yes. <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>I think it started here: https://archive.moe/a/thread/128375<wbr>500/<br>Also i found this one</br></wbr></br>  <br><br>So is this one of the drama that the lnfags told us?</br></br>  <br> sucking Kajo's dick <br><br>GAY</br></br></br>  <br>So what exactly does it say?</br>  <br> not wanting to suck Kajo's dick <br>what the fuck are you doing in this thread and watching this anime<br><br>Tanukichi gets Anna pregnant</br></br></br></br>  <br>Anna was the only reason I was even interested in this show, dropped.</br>  <br>I really wanted Kajo getting the Okuma.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br> Orgy End </br>  <br>Okuma is a pervert, but he's a good man. He's one girl only.<br>Also, Anna could be a major pervert and a cock slut, but it's OKUMA's cockslut. She wets for him because she's in love.</br></br>  <br><br>It's Tanukichi and Anna, together, informing Sofia, who expects that something is wrong, but hitherto was unaware of Tanukichi's relationship with Anna, that there's a problem. Anna informs her mother that, to her, Tanukichi is the most important thing in the world, and that she loves Tanukichi; this profession of love surprises Tanukichi, not because he is unhappy but it's the first time she's saying it, simultaneously informing both him and Sofia. <br><br>It doesn't say she's pregnant.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If this pregnancy rumor is true, that's quite the change of mood for a lighthearted comedy. It's pretty doubtful in fact</br>  S O X  <br>I find it hilarious that no one on /a/ can read Japanese.</br>  <br>The pregnancy stuff was made up because 90%people in /a/ can't moon. The kanji used for pregnancy 妊娠 is nowhere seen in that text. <br>For what I can see, is just Anna telling her mother that she's in love with Tanukichi, that he's the most valuable thing for her. Shit is that Tanukichi can't aswer shit because she had Kajo (I think?) in his mind too.</br></br>  <br><br>Read it again<br> そこの卑猥なゴミに妊娠させられたことで情緒不安定になっているのでは.<wbr>..</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck. How did I miss that? But it doesn't say she's pregnant though, it says that pregnancy is considered garbage or stuff.</br>  <br>So do you just not know Japanese or what?</br>  <br><br>Collusion! fuck you guys!</br></br>  <br>Line please? can't fuckin see it</br>  <br>13th</br>  <br><br>Nevermind, I found it. It doesn't say she's pregnant, they are talking about pregnancy. It seems that anon got confused and got shimoneta fandom mad.<br><br>She's not pregnant. Okuma can't decide if he likes Kajo or Anna, Anna wets for him and turns to be more pervert than Okuma and Kajo together.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>That isn't Anna saying she's pregant you dumbass. It's wonder if the reason for Anna's recent emotional instability is a result of her being pregnant. <br><br>It isn't. It's because she loves Tanukichi, and she hasn't been able to admit it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Be she does admit it at the very last, but Tanukichi is the one undecided.</br>  <br>And at the end<br> アンナ先輩、僕は――― <br>It seems that Tanukichi, like us, wants the Anna but at the same time wants to suck Kajo's dick</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why can't he fuck Anna while simultaneously taking Kajo's dick in the ass?</br></br>  <br>because even when he's a pervert, he's 1 girl only</br>  <br>Well I don't mind at all if he gets both. I'd love to see a menage a trois.</br>    <br>She likes him. So?</br>  it's pretty clear that he will end with Kajo <br> being this dense </br>  So Anna being pregnant was just a mistranslation and we went mad for nothing?  <br><br>Yes, they were saying if the reason she was emotionally unestable was because she was pregnant.<br> trusting in a <br>is your fault</br></br></br></br>   Still not Hiryuu   <br> secretly <br>too late</br></br>  You fags ruined it. Of course she is not pregnant, they did pregnancy test and it was negative. Also Ayame confessed to MC in front of Anna in vol 9, fuck you.  <br>See you next week!</br>  <br>whats his reaction? How did Anna take it? I can see Anna dont giving a fuck but he is spilling spaghetti everyone</br>  <br>Speculating you mean?<br><br>Yea I never fully trust /a/ but I thought that as a prank was too much elaborated and in the face to pull it off for such a not-so-popular anime, but as a dumbass I forgot Hanlon's Razor and didn't think about /a/ simply being dumb.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you really thought this would last? Also, where I can find Vol 9? I wanna read that cuck</br>  <br>Read this </br>  <br> secretly </br>  <br> そこの卑猥なゴミに妊娠させられたことで情緒不安定になっているのでは.<wbr></wbr> <br><br> With it has become emotionally unstable that it was allowed to pregnancy to the bottom of the obscene waste . <br>w-what</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isnt this Reverse Cuck? Doesnt Cuck require a white dude getting his GF banged in front of him?</br>  <br>I was correcting him by saying that the characters were actually speculating</br>  <br><br>Read the whole page, anon. Anna isn't pregnant.  even says it's a misunderstanding.<br><br>The reason Anna has been recently distraught is not because she's pregnant, but because she's soberly, but firmly, come to the realization that she loves Tanukichi.</br></br></br></br>  Anyway, with that business out of the way, he can get down to getting best girl pregnant instead.  <br>Tell us more of that confession, please.</br>  <br>I don't know, I bought them.<br><br/></br></br>  She's perfection.  <br>She isn't lewd because she doesn't know what lewd is.</br>  <br>Translate please. I'm about to Iku Iku! here<br> Anata no [unreadable kanji for me] ga daisukiyo! </br></br>  So this thread just proves that /a/ don't know how to read moon at all ?  <br>She also isnt pure by that reason. You can only be pure if you atleast know whats lewd is, choosing to be pure is what truly perfection. Anna and all these guys arent really pure, they just dont know any better.</br>  <br>She just discovered what lewd is at the very end of the episode.<br><br>And she doesn't even know what it is yet. It's her first time feeling it.</br></br></br>  S<br>O<br>X</br></br>  <br>S<br>O<br>S</br></br></br>  <br>wait, i barely understand moon but did just Takunichi likes her back? I can see a "Honto ni yokatta ne! sayonara! bye bye!"<br>She's relieved or something? Anna a cuck?</br></br>  <br>I can see Anna not giving a shit. " Oh you like him too? Well guess we are rivals now, k thx bye, i try raping him anyways."</br>  <br><br>it says <br><br><br> And then, Kajō, at once, declaimed something unbelievable; <br> "I love everything about you, Takunichi !"  <br> "I'm forever grateful, truly, to have meet a person as funny as you; as kind as you;" </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> haremshit <br>DROPPEEEEEEEED</br></br>  <br>And then she leaves right? Why she leaves after confessing to him?</br>  <br>This is also the point of the story if you want to find a social critique into it</br>   tfw no english translated LNs   <br><br> "Tonight's special is a big, steamy wiener. Enjoy, sir." </br></br>  <br><br> Orgy end <br> three people <br><br>You'll need more than that. We'll need Saotome, Goriki, and Fuwa.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not the whole school </br>  <br> the anime will never get here <br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>Who a fairly basic love triangle makes it harem?</br>  <br>She is maximum overlewd?</br>  <br>Jesus fuck, this lewd Anna thing is really going places in these threads.<br><br>Will the anime actually go that far?</br></br></br>  <br>For sure she will try to rape Okuma in his apartment</br>  <br><br>Even the flies?</br></br>  <br>Harem requires at least three unique characters to have romantic feelings for the lead main character.</br>  <br>Was that the context of the next episode preview?</br>  Well, that's how this shit usually plays out, isn't it?  <br><br>Here's all of it if anyone wants it:<br><br> And then, Kajō, at once, declaimed something unbelievable; <br> "I love everything about you, Takunichi !"  <br> "I'm forever grateful, truly, to have meet a person as funny as you; as kind as you;" <br> "... But for now, farewell, at least for a while." <br> Takunichi, flustered, asked himself what, what has she gone and said this time?  <br> "Kajō, who in;"  <br> Anna, to his side, screamed... Terminally and completely cutting through Takunichi's response. <br><br> I omitted the fact that Kajō' inserts "hooters" into her sentence, as it ruins the emotion of the scene. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> <br> implying there isn't another character that likes the MC </br></br>  Why don't nips just have sex  This wouldn't be half as boner inducing without the heart pupils. I don't even know what's it about them anymore, but the mere mention of it makes me hard in no time.  <br>It isn't even about heart pupils for me, it's just irregular eyes in general. Then again, eyes have always been my primary attraction feature ever since birth, so it's not surprising that variance in them makes me diamonds.</br>  <br>Especially the flies.</br>  <br><br>Scientist girl exists. not!Mirai exists. pic related exists</br></br>  <br>wait thats the police chick in the first episode. Is she actually Kajos mom? She seems pretty similiar to hers</br>  <br>Are they part of the main cast, with "main character" levels of screentime?

But she'll just end up as a topic for shit-posting and will be black listed in-so-much that just mentioning her will cause an uproar.<br>Everytime I see marikafag post, there's "Horse fucker" stuff, and "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. I wouldn't be able to deal with it if that happened to me and my waifu.</br></br>  <br>Well, then, start off with simple requests. Her drinking tea, or looking out at the sunset on the beach, or wearing so and so clothes or some shit.<br>Then maybe after two weeks or three, you can move up and start to request other things.</br></br>  <br>Just don't request waifus in the general then. Pick a pair of characters that are in the relationship, and request them.</br>  <br>Ignore other fuckers. If she's your waifu, then she's your waifu. Others can try to judge you, but only you can say what she means to you.</br>  <br>I've been requesting for months. That's how i know it won't stop them.<br><br>I don't just want this because I want fap material. Ideally, it would be an erotic image of my waifu.<br><br>Thanks you. And I agree, but it'd still suck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No way your waifu would lay a finger on my waifu, she'd be on the floor in a blink of an eye.</br>  <br>Then have the balls to request your waifu, instead of asking for a random one.<br> Requesting waifu masturbating. <br> Who is your waifu? <br> Not telling, since it would make me look bad, but a random other person getting a picture of his waifu masturbating, posted in this thread for everyone to see, is completely fine! Even if he wouldn't want one! <br>Put some fucking thought into this.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't thinking. Please forgive me. I'll stop now.</br>  <br>If you truly cared about any of this then you would commission lewds of her so no one else can see.<br><br>And you're Tsuyufag, aren't you?</br></br></br>  so whenever i browse WWD for requests to draw<br>there bound to be someone who just say "nobody's gona draw her" or somthin similar<br>so then i ask who's your waifu and they just didn't reply<br><br>what is wrong with you guys?<br>you want your waifu drawn then fucking say it out loud ffs</br></br></br></br></br>   boa was drawing waifus  <br> didn't get to request mine <br><br>goddamn it.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's that people are willing to wait patiently to have her drawn, but will bemoan the chance that it might not happen before the end of Sunday.<br>That's how I see it. They're too proud to beg desperately for it, and are more than willing to request and wait.</br></br>  <br>I now have a relaxing weekend because of it<br> I'll be frantically following WonFes anyway </br></br>  <br> 2shy2beg <br>hmmm guess i didn't think about it this way<br>thanks anon</br></br></br>  <br>Asking directly makes you look desperate for drawings. Some people would rather wait for a drawfag to pick up the request. Some jump on every occasion for a drawing/collage, and in a long run make themselves look like a greedy scum.</br>  <br>No.  I'm Nononfag. </br>  <br>People are going to complain that their waifu isn't going to be drawn, but it's part of board culture not to vulture artists, even if you directly ask them.</br>  <br>See? That wasn't so hard. If you want lewds, the only way to do it while still looking like a true waifufag is to commission.</br>  <br>But there's like three dudes in there.</br>  <br>Even better!</br>  <br>What do you want them to do? Finger their assholes? I doubt their husbandofags want them jerking it.</br>  <br>Huh, thanks for using my drawing for the OP image, didn't notice till now.</br>  Requesting this concept art of cyborg Hakodate Omiko doing something cool. Maybe something One-Punch Man related?  <br> They're too proud to beg desperately for it <br>I think it's more that they don't want to be seen as greedy or vulturing or whatever</br></br>  Requesting barefoot ryouna  <br>Thanks for drawing Rukia, Boa-sama.

Everyone even settled with the "rerequesting after a collage" Thing.<br><br>Also, its not vulturing if drawfag specifically asks for waifus to draw.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I know this feeling, anon. I've had my waifu for many years now, there's no way I could say I don't fap to her.<br>But requesting lewds in here? that's something I'm hesitant about.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, I wouldn't rerequest after getting a collage delivery.<br>Unless someone was saying they'd take requests for a different collage, because that would likely take a few weekends to get delivered.</br></br>  Requesting BurningGreymon.  <br>Requesting a barbed noose around your neck.</br>  <br> "greedy faggot" stuff for Kobolifag. <br>I don't really see that happen outside of shitposters whining in the general. Horse stuff for Marikafag, sure, but nothing for Koborifag.</br></br>  Requesting Sawyer by a table, with a cup of coffee/chocolate, a sandwich, and reading a magazine.  <br>koborifag is just trying to shitpost himself, don't mind it</br>  <br>Okay, now I've seen this. I'm not even sure that this even happens most of the time.</br>  <br>Does koborifag even love kobori? I mean, does he even know of her character song?</br>  <br>You could say the same for a lot of other waifufags.</br>  <br>I'm glad some waifufags actually know shit about their waifu and not just imagine every single thing about them like they're fucking OCs.</br>  <br>I wonder if any of the other Bleachfags know about the concept covers? I'm a bit envious of them, since they get to hear their waifus sing.</br>  <br> tfw your waifu is so fucking good at singing <br>Feels good man.</br></br>  Take it to /ghost/. This is not a waifu thread.  <br>Can confirm. Listening to your waifu sing is the one of the best feelings in the world.</br>  Requesting Tomoko riding a dinosaur.  <br>Does Yuunafag even love Yuuna? I mean, does he even know that she's a lesbian?</br>  Requesting Kanna and Yuu in cute frilly swimsuits kissing underwater like the scene from Sakura Trick  <br><br><br>Can't beat this https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ICw<wbr>3HU0K5Ww</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Requesting Tomoko being RIDDEN by a dinosaur   sexually </br>    Requesting Akaza Akari drinking water to stay hydrated during this hot summer.  <br>First they came for Oorafag, and I did not speak out—<br>Because I was not a meme.<br>Then they came for Marikafag, and I did not speak out—<br>Because I was not a lewdfag.<br>Then they came for Koborifag, and I did not speak out—<br>Because I was not greedy.<br><br>Then they came for me —and there was no one left to speak for me.<br><br>Moral of this story is when you see someone getting shitposted, instead of being glad it's not you, you should tell the shitposters to get fucked. You can take back the thread from the three or four asshurt terrorist babies who do this if you just try.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or you could just refrain from being a spergy faggot altogether.</br>  <br>Depends on the rules for the fight.</br>  <br> Then they came for Marikafag,  <br>I wish.</br></br>  <br>Or just you know, don't be a faggot and no one will shitpost you.</br>  <br>If you don't say anything wrong no one will shitpost about you.<br>In the end, its all about how you act around people.</br></br>  <br>I might do another one of this later that isn't a sketch.</br>  Requesting a two-panel comic with carol (giant hat) saying<br> My dad is fucking dead! <br>and Hibiki responding with<br> At least your dad loves you! </br></br></br>  <br>Sweet Burninggreymon</br>  <br>But I always reply with my waifu every time.</br>  Requesting Adlet licking Fremy’s navel.  <br><br>Yeah no. Everyone who does anything besides request and never post again gets shitposted. Drawfags, people who socialize in the threads, people who thank excessively, fucking everyone who anyone can actually identify gets sperged on constantly.<br><br>Needs to stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe if you want to identify yourself to other people so badly you shouldn't be on an anonymous imageboard.</br>  Requesting this with Natsuru<br>thighhighs_pull<br>underwear<br>nipples</br></br></br>  <br>I don't care whether people know me or not, but I'm not going to cower in fear of a bunch of crying faggots who love being anonymous because they can shitpost all day and all night without consequence. <br><br>If I want to talk to someone to tell them they did a good job or that I missed them or that they missed a delivery, and I want to let them know who's talking to them, I should be able to do that without being called an avatarfag or a tripfag or a spergy faggot for literally no other reason except people knowing who I am for one post.</br></br></br>  Requesting Nadeko playing jenga but cheating with her snake hair  <br>It almost sounds like you give a fuck what other people say. So what if you tripfag and people have a problem with it? There is a little something called ignoring it. If you cant handle a little internet bullying for doing something you want to do then you shouldn't be on 4chan</br>  <br>And I don't care if you want to do all that somewhere else. The only time you should be identifying yourself in these threads are when you are either requesting or thanking. Again, if being recognized by people is so important to you, perhaps you shouldn't be on 4chan.</br>  <br>Oora! is not a waifu, it is a meme.</br>  <br>That's great, but Oora isn't my waifu.</br>  <br>RIP mishafag.</br>  <br>You still aren't even close.</br>  <br>You can request, fuck off, and be one of the most invisible people in the thread. However, that's not stopping drawfag from shitposting you through drawings. You can't win in these threads.</br>  <br>Working on it</br>  <br>Who is your waifu?</br>  <br>Mimi</br>  <br>moar like meme am I right</br>  <br>yeah so <br><br>The people who aren't shitposting retards<br>Or shitposting retard drawfags<br>Who actually love their waifus<br>And wouldn't want to be shitposted if someone found out who their waifu was<br><br>Need to gangrape the people who shitpost when it happens<br><br>Tamafag did nothing wrong except color waifus and be friendly<br>Yuunafag did nothing wrong except do pixels and be friendly<br>Koborifag did nothing wrong except writefag and be friendly<br><br>And they get shit on nonstop while these retards who shitpost them hide and shitpost and then pretend to thank the drawfags who draw for them while secretly hating them<br><br>All it would take is people telling them to get fucked when it happens.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>Just drop it.</br>  <br> Wake up <br> see this  <br>That's looking delicious! Thanks for picking it up!</br></br></br>  <br>You think that drawfag threads are an exception or something? That happens in every thread on pretty much every board. If you can do something that someone else can not they will most likely shit post you for being better than they are. What you really need to do it grow up and learn to ignore things you do not like, instead of having this big cry about your waifu not getting drawn by anon because he gives too much of a fuck about what other people think.</br>  <br>If you actually cared about those people, stop attracting attention to them.</br>  Also good morning!

Anyways, how's the Ryouna request going? </br>  <br><br> Maximum Overlewd </br></br>  Goddamn, I've been drawing hairstyles for over 3 months now and i'm still having trouble with this shit. This was something I drew a few minutes ago. I don't get what I'm doing wrong. These particular examples I did here, I tried to do more "anime" bangs, using my anime figs as reference, but for the past couple of months it's all been off 3D examples.<br><br>Every tutorial I've read doesn't tell me how to divide up the section with the bangs and the back of the hair, or how the hair should flow or how I should draw my lines. At this point, I thought I got it but now I'm just damn confused. <br><br>I don't wanna ask /ic/ either because they can be a bunch of biggoted assholes who tell me to stop drawing Chinese cartoons just because they hate it.<br><br>I'm just ridiculously discouraged right now and considering quitting hair tomorrow temporarily and moving onto eyes.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Requesting color<br>http://i.imgur.com/kUnhDdt.jpg</br>  <br>those look fine to me. but then again, its not like im a animu hair drawing expert either</br>  <br>really nice! dem bullets and posing are really well-done.<br><br><br>l-lewd!<br><br><br>e-eh, i hope this helps, i think it would help if you partition the hair into strands of approximately same width. hair also tend to curve inwards to face the cheeks, anime figs don't help much but looking at how other illustrators draw helps a lot in learning how to draw animu imo.<br><br>artists like nardack and kurehito draw the hair very nicely and maybe you can take some reference from them:<br>https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/4687727<br>https://chan.sankakucomplex.com/pos<wbr>t/show/4691729</wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I bet you can't even name all those waifus.</br>  <br><br><br>I feel like I've seen these exact two posts before, a month or two ago</br></br></br>  <br>you need to think in volumes, try to feel the 3d form and let the lines flow along with it. Go from big and blocky to small and detailed.</br>  <br>i just drew it and composed that post about 10 minutes ago though, yeah, the guy's asking for help is prolly the same from few months back<br><br><br><br>he explained it better, actually and this one's the proper way to draw hair</br></br></br></br></br>  Feeling like taking Bakemonogatari, or Desu Note requests  <br> you will never have something this awesome draw for you </br>  <br>I have, several times.</br>  <br>Requesting Black Hanekawa in a revealing China dress</br>  <br>Untitled-san is my waifu.</br>    <br>well fuck you</br>  Requesting Nakiri Erina in Prinz Eugen clothes and Prinz Eugen in Erina's clothes, please  <br>aight will do</br>  I would love a mecha-girl dog-girl of a BuCue from Gundam please  <br>Be sure to have side slits to show off those juicy thighs</br>  Requesting some cirno, either playing a guitar or using a camera  <br><br><br>Yeah it's me. Here's a picture of my progress. I believe I have made progress, but recently I've been sorta plateau-ing, which is something I definately do not want. I feel like I get the hair at some points but sometimes I don't. It's sorta weird. Would you guys say I'm on the right path? Would it be good for me to take a break from hair for now and try drawing other stuff?</br></br></br>  <br>She looks damn like fate stay nights rider</br>  <br>Well yeah, that's kinda like the point of those dresses no? haha</br>  <br>This reminds me of something but I can't put a finger in it.</br>  <br>If you feel stuck then try switching it up a bit. Maybe try drawing traditionally rather than digital for a while, I sometimes find that can help.</br>  Requesting Index twerking for Stiyl.  Kanase from Strike the Blood getting creampied and impregnated (with x-ray).<br>It'd be all happy and vanilla with hand-holing, teary eyes, and smiling.<br>Also requesting her dressed as an angel, how one typically looks or the MGE version.</br></br>  <br>I think you've improved considerably.

Total Maledom, or having Hori being his pet bitch in pet-play  <br> twerking <br>Nigger confirmed.</br></br>  Did the artist drop this pic of the two girls in Owari no Seraph wearing skimpy versions of their uniforms?  <br>I think your problem is that the hair you draw it's trying to emulate "real" hair, and anime hair normally works like chunks of hair put together, for example i draw this hair based on the 3D girl pic of your image.<br>I think you have to imagine how would that hair look in anime instead of trying to draw "real hair anime", or something like that, hope you can understand what I'm saying because I'm shit at explaining stuff.</br></br>  MILF Tiffania saying "Ara ara!

I seriously want to complete requests here, but I can't draw shit unless it's tracing. Any ideas?  I don't know what characters to request yet, but I want to see a pie eating contest between various anime girls  I come back after a couple hours and there's no Symphogear thread? For shame.  It needs to get some sleep  Бефстроганов  <br> Dude... <br> What? </br></br>  Why is Kirika so best?  <br> Translator's note: Бефстроганов means beef stroganoff. </br>  Just in time, I was looking for a Symphogear thread.<br><br>I spent the passed 2 weeks marathoning Symphogear from beginning up till where its at now.<br><br>I have never seen such a medicore anime original screenplay in my life. Nothing was really bad about it but nothing was good. It was predictable as shit from beginning to end.<br><br>Asspulls everywhere<br><br> remember when swan songs were suppose to kill the user <br> characters dying in the final fight of the first series to be brought back to life by the power of friendship. <br><br>2nd series<br><br> not fucking up that scientist in any of the 10000 chances they had. <br> using the same asspull to beat the final boss monster twice. <br> most conflicts CAN actually be avoided by just TALKING it out. <br><br>I can go on with this shit. Symphogear was the most bland anime i've ever watched. What do people see in it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The 2nd song title is Classroom Keyholder( keychain)  <br>Read keywords.</br>  Zerker Hibiki when?  <br>Fun.</br>  <br>Friday.</br>  <br>It's fun</br>  <br>Symphogear isn't about the plot. It's about the songs and playing classic magical girl and mecha tropes completely straight for fun.</br>  <br>If you find it bland, stop watching. You are only punishing yourself by watching it.</br>  <br> Cute <br> Chunni <br> DESS DESS DESS </br></br></br>  <br>It's boring DESS!</br>  <br><br>Believe me I want to, but I'm so deep in already.

Can't forget all her other moments.</br>  <br>Kirika has been a best for a while. I'm just glad the most recent episode made more people see the light of DESS.</br>  <br>I wonder if the 2nd song will be CD only. If Chris'll sing it in the show at some point then we're still gonna get more SoL.</br>  <br>I want to like her, I really, really do. She's adorable and I have a weakness for scythe-wielders and witch hats and ridiculous shoulder things<br><br>But her singing voice is so goddamn grating, I can't stand it</br></br></br>  <br><br>Preferable image?</br></br>  <br> 392x341 <br>step it up</br></br>  Not even Haruto wavered as much as Hibiki does.<br> Not to say I don't like Hibiki <br> I just like Haruto. </br></br>  <br><br>This <br>Google Genjuuro's Angels, you'll find them there.</br></br></br>  <br> swan songs were suppose to kill the user </br>  <br><br>To be fair, the show could do a better job to explain this point, why it killed Kanade, why it almost killed Tsubasa, why it did not kill them in the final episode, etc.<br>Reading additional material should not be mandatory to understand key points of the show, they should solely serve as supplementary material, the show should explain all important points itself clearly.</br></br></br>  <br>It killed Kanade because Fine is a fucking whore who deserves to bleed out slowly in a ditch, unloved and forgotten<br><br> I'm not bitter </br></br></br>  <br>The lolibasa flashback was enough to understand.</br>  <br><br>FIne withheld Linker from her, right, but Kanade knew that, didn't she?</br></br>  <br><br>What episode was that again?</br></br>  <br>Four, I think.</br>  I just watched episode 3 of GX today, Three of the gears are broken, Hibiki has lost her determination to fist and they're only 3 episodes in. How damn bad are things going to get for the gears before the end?  <br>I'd think it would be pretty hard to not know a drug you have to inject into your fucking neck was being withheld, but Fine still withheld it knowing it would lead to Kanade's eventual death.<br><br>I do, admittedly, need to rewatch S1, but unless I'm failing to remember Ryoko/Fine explicitly stating otherwise, I cannot believe Fine withheld the LiNKER from Kanade with any goal other than it eventually killing her.</br></br></br>  <br>DMJii are bound to get injured, unfortunately.</br>  <br>Theoretically all six Gear users are out of commission at the moment. Three are broken, Gungnir is mysteriously refusing to activate, and Shul Shagana and Igalima are killing their users. Shit's pretty whack right now.<br><br> And it'll only get worse in episode 7 </br></br></br>  <br>Just let Genjuuro get his hands on a complete relic and all problems will be instantly trivialized.</br>  Everything will be Fine. Carol just need to be bullied a bit.  <br>Things are only going to get worse for them. I understand now why Nana was bedridden for a week after reading the script and trying to come up with the lyrics for Exterminate</br>  <br><br>The one that told Kanade's story?<br>Because that's pretty useless for understanding how the swan song works.</br></br></br>  As a European and with the recent crisis this actually worries me.  <br>But she wasn't, it just took her a week to finish it. Kaneko was bedridden for three weeks after finishing the script.</br>  <br>If you're talking about the superlolibasa appearance that was midway through ep 11</br>  <br>I'm still punching myself for not realizing how great she and Shirabe were until now. Going to go order their CDs from G now. I'm definitely getting their new ones once they come out.<br><br>Kirika's transformation is still my favorite from GX so far.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Unless it's so short that I jumped over it it's not.</br></br>  <br> Kanade needs to pump herself full of linker to work <br> Tsubasa is a natural symphogenius <br>Combine that with the fact that "swan song" is a retarded mistranslation, and it's pretty clear what happened.</br></br></br>  <br>Blame Greece.</br>  <br>It is super short, like maybe 5 seconds? I just checked and its at 13 minutes in.</br>  <br>I know your feeling.</br>  <br>Fucking Greece.</br>  <br><br>This? All it talks about is the Aufwachen form that awakened Fine, nothing about the Supreme Song there.</br></br>  <br>They're mediocre individually, especially Shirabe back in G, but they're pretty damn great as a pair.</br>  After watching the beef stroganoff scene and the other school scenes, I kind of wish there was SoL spinoff.  <br>I just want a full episode dedicated to a training arc while cantonese songs play in the background.</br>  <br>I want to kidnap five year old loli Tsubasa and buy her sweets and watch disney movies with her, and then tuck her into bed.</br>  <br>She claimed LiNKER would interfere with the Nehushtan experiment but that could easily have been bullshit. Who's gonna question Sakurai Ryouko when she starts throwing technobabble around?</br>    <br>The Persians had the right idea.<br>Burn Greece down.</br></br>  <br>What would be her favourite Disney film? My money is on either Lion King or Mulan</br>  Why does everyone have abandonment issues?  <br> I kind of wish there was SoL spinoff. <br><br>Well, it'd have to be a prequel because  those 3 girls are going to die in episode 7 </br></br></br>   IT'S FINALLY TIME <br> Non-H for now </br>  <br>Not okay anon<br><br>not okay</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, with the A.Noise in play it's dubious if even a complete relic would be able to save them. Remember, they're capable of decomposing any matter, not just Symphogears, and that means full relics are fair game. Nehushtan's regenerative properties might have been able to resist it, but it's dust now.<br><br>Until they have a countermeasure developed with Dansleif, they're fucked no matter what else they scrounge up.</br></br></br>  <br>But it's true because in season 2 FIS tried to activate Nephilim by collecting main trio's Phonic Gain through fighting, but failed due to they were using LiNKER.</br>  <br>  Elaborate </br>  <br> Non-H <br>Yes please.</br></br>  <br><br> http://www.toranoana.jp/mailorder/c<wbr>ot/m_pagekit/reserve/cm88/genre/384<wbr>7.html</wbr></wbr> <br> I'm watching everywhere I can for Symphogear doujins, 2 non H went up since I checked last <br> I'm the guy who keeps talking about scanning things/scanned a few things, so I'll be buying two copies of everything I get. </br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm thinking characters are going to die soon because there are starting to be too many. <br>You don't know about Nanoha and Dog Days. do you?<br>Symphogear's cast isn't that bloated compared to those shows</br></br></br>  <br>I think the dolls are definitely going to die. Not sure about Carol and Elfnein though.</br>  <br> graced by Nana dubs <br>Based anon's scanning efforts approved even by Nana.<br><br> That website is atrocious, why can't the japs into web design? </br></br></br></br>  <br> HER NAME WAS YUMI ITABA<br>SHE LIKED BEEF STROGANOFF</br> </br>  <br> Based anon's scanning efforts approved even by Nana. <br>Fuck yeah.<br><br> &gt;That website is atrocious <br> It took me forever to get used to it, and I'm still having difficulties like 2 years later. At least it's reliable. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I read that as "Yummy Itaba", and in case you didn't know, "Itaba" means "kitchen" or "chef".</br>  Bad guys are better than good guys this season.   H&amp;D is out   <br> attack cards aren't translated <br> one line of dialogue is skipped too </br></br>   Reading the manga <br>I see that these two were already a thing even before all the shit with noise happened.</br>  <br>Attack cards are just cool. The translations don't ever make sense anyways, so it's not a huge loss. Did they put the pronunciation there at least?</br>  <br>Wait really? I haven't watched it yet, just checked if they're out.<br><br>Come the fuck on it's almost a week after comeme.</br></br></br>  <br>Nope, nothing.<br><br>Apparently there was some miscommunication and a proofread file was misplaced or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Sorry folks, had a bit of a delay because I had to go to the doctors/rest up a bit because I may have a hernia in my lower right abdomen, which hopefully isn’t the case. <br><br> Unfortunately I’m stuck in bed typing this using a ps1 controller and an on screen keyboard so I wasn’t able to typeset the attack cards this week, which were the only signs in the episode. </br></br></br>  The AutoScorers and Carol need the Symphogear's song for power or something, don't they?<br><br>They're always commenting on the strength of the song and goading Hibiki to fight</br></br>  <br>As demonstrated in Ep2, they need the Geahs active before they can break them.</br>  <br><br>What's the point in breaking the geahs anyway?<br>Is it some extreme case of bullying?</br></br></br>  <br> before they can break them <br>Oh, fucking duh.<br>I still wonder if there's any relevance to them commenting on the strength of the songs or not</br></br></br>  <br> Comeme <br>Implying Commie subs aren't just as viable for this show as H&amp;D if not more.<br>No, I don't expect a response. I know full well that we have H&amp;D staff in the thread. Just don't shitpost other releases when there is no basis for it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Carol's endgame involves a song that will destroy the world, so there's probably more to it than we know of.<br><br><br>How else is she going to make them resort to Dansleif?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They mistyped the second song title. It's "After School Keyholder".</br>  <br>Childhood friends since elementary school.</br>  <br>That's an awfully early time to get a girlfriend.</br>  Reason why they made a lot of beef stroganoff.  If they made a Symphogear  live-action  movie, featuring  all the seiyuu as their roles , would you watch it?  <br>Gonna require lots of camera angles to get Y.Aoi in the picture.</br>  <br> they give her extra high heels so she can be seen <br>   I can't fight in these! <br>   stomp <br>   Aoi drops off the screen </br></br></br></br>  <br>Flashback when.</br>  <br>10/10 fund it.</br>  <br>No, unless I want to kill myself.  I won't be able to stop myself from puking and laughing at the same time. </br>  Is it swan song, superb song or something else?<br>What the hell is a zesshou?</br>  <br>Superb Song.</br>  <br><br> Fucking hell yes I would </br></br>  <br><br>I just hope there is some logic this time.<br><br>S2 was fun and all, but plot completely fell apart in the second half.</br></br></br></br>  Wannabe Sakimori Maria.  Can't kirika and shirabe just give their relics to tsubase and chris?  Does it worth it /a/?  <br>They're not compatible with Shul Shagana or Igalima, so that'd just leave everyone worse off.</br>  <br>No, because geah users only sync with specific geahs. Maria being able to use two is  a miracle .</br>  <br>So long as it's Blue, yes.</br>  <br>Phonic Gain.</br>  <br> I can't remember the chant </br>  <br><br>Just imagine what her tongue is doing inside his throat right now.</br></br>  <br>It's SPARB SONGU.<br><br><br>If she had an album that was just making fun of the listener in her sexy old lady voice, I would buy 10 copies.</br></br></br></br>   there are people who don't watch each release of each episode   Did you know that Ogawa-san is the MC?  <br>Ogawa-san will save Hibiki.<br>Genjuro will save everybody else.<br> Carol will not be saved. </br></br></br>  When does this happen?

Instead the energy meant for use in an Armed Gear directly alters her fists and feet, allowing her to remain empty-handed." <br> "This eventually proves to be a benefit rather than a hindrance, as her strong will to avoid fighting and connect with other people allows her to join hands with others since she has no weapon to hold in her hands." <br> yfw thematic 180 turn and Hibiki pummels the dolls to death with her bare hands <br>DEATH<br>E<br>A<br>T<br>H</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm retarded, I meant to ask which vol.? I found several extras in http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=5<wbr>48423&amp;showfiles=1</wbr> </br>  <br>I don't think Hibiki's dad will actually make an appearance. The entire issue with him is the fact that he's not there for her when she needs him, and his ongoing absence is enough to drive that subplot  and suffering  without some contrived drama added to it.<br><br>A custody claim from him also has basically no ground to stand on to begin with, given what he did, nevermind that S.O.N.G. can pretty much veto whatever they want to veto because of the UN and international crisis.</br></br></br>  <br>Volume 4, I think.<br>I'm not completely sure though.</br></br>  <br>Sure, why not.<br>But Ver needs to have more screentime.</br></br>  <br><br>Wait these are quite a lot extras there.<br>What else is there apart from the two OVAs and Miku's transformation?</br></br></br>  <br>I'll try it.

It knows how to show you a good fun time. Even so, I like S1 the most ao far because it doesn't have to one-up anything like S2 tried so hard to do. It was also hilariously edgy. Thay first episode is one of my favorite first episodes ever.</br>  <br>Just get them all, they're pretty short.</br>  <br>Vol.5 is FIS.<br>The big ones are the OVAs.</br></br>  <br>they probably want the energy from xdrive mode to revive some kind of god or something, maybe this time we'll see the X-Drive in the middle of the season</br>  <br>How will Sugita do Ver faces in 3D?</br>  <br>It wouldn't work because Tsubasa would lose a lot of her presence being shorter than Chris.</br>  <br>They'll just hide it with a huge  wing hair extension. </br>  <br>And the worst part is obviously the fanbase.</br>  <br><br>But there are three big ones.</br></br>  The Autoscorers have model numbers.<br><br>Micha is XMH_004<br>Leiur is XMH_006<br>Phara is XMH_008<br>Garie is XMH_020<br><br>Garie stands out here for being 12 entire model numbers away from Phara, while all the others are only 2 apart. What's Carol put in her to warrant such a gap? Surely it can't just be the illusions.<br><br>Micha also notably holds the lowest number and is supposedly the most powerful in combat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I really feel like Micha is "most powerful" because she's the most reckless or most likely to go rogue</br>  <br>Carol refers to her specifically as their greatest combatant (最大戦力) in episode 3, and her character page even highlights that she's been specially tuned for combat.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Garie is probably the brain of the dolls and the weakest fighter, Micha a monster-like fighter for raw brawling purposes. The other two are average soldiers.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "I don't want to fight" <br> "WAKARIMASEN" <br> Miku gets stabbed. <br> Zerbiki mode activated. <br><br>Please please please.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bedridden <br>She wasn't bedridden, its just when she read the script it was so heavy that she took a rest after reading it and it took her a week to finish the whole song.</br></br>  <br> Miku gets stabbed. <br>I prefer  Miku get kissed. </br></br>  <br>Well, her personality quirk is supposed to be childish cruelty, which would make her the least receptive to Hibiki's attempts, but the Autoscorers' AIs are based off facets of Carol's own personality, and if Micha embodies Carol's inner child, then Hibiki's attitude might unexpectedly appeal to her.</br>   went to watch S1's OP on youtube <br> that animation quality <br>Damn. I wanted to rewatch first two seasons, but now I'm not so sure. S3 is so pretty compared to the first one.</br></br>  <br>S1's story is really enjoyable.<br>I like the old character designs too.</br></br>  <br>I fucking love the animation in S3, but it sucks that Exterminate and the animation in the opening doesn't really match each other.</br>  <br>I really liked the start of Synchrogazer's OP video.</br>  <br>Nana's song is too awesome for the animator.</br>  <br>What if Nana is the animator?</br>  <br><br>If she'd animate her own OVA I'd watch the shit out of it.</br></br>  S3's ED's buildup is kinda weak compared to S2's. But that's unfair to say because S2 ED was the best thing ever.  <br> Nana-drawn Zesshoushinai episode <br> everyone looks like bushinoise </br></br>  <br><br>I can't shake the feeling they're tricking us with that opening animation somehow.<br><br><br><br> whole zesshoushinai of Nana drawings   that will be used as a basis for season 4 designs </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hey is there like a super OST pack on Nyaa? <br><br>And what song would you reccomend, it's been a while since I've watched the other seasons.</br></br>  <br>bases*</br>  Man I regret not watching the 2013 live earlier. I fucking wish I could've been there during Aoi's performance.  <br>All of the songs are fucking 11/10.<br>Except for Dark Oblivion which is Engrish tier.</br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Yeah but is there like a torrent that just groups them all?</br>  <br><br>Generally? All of them.<br> has a point about Dark Oblivion though.</br></br></br>  <br>Basis and bases are two very different things.</br>  <br>You're correcting me for using the singular instead of the plural form, right? I can't tell because you didn't also tell me to change<br> a basis <br>to<br> the bases </br></br></br></br>  <br> Except for Dark Oblivion which is Engrish tier. <br>I didn't even notice that it is in english.</br></br>  <br><br>What did you think it was? Finengrish?</br></br>  Anyone else glad that someone is calling out on Hibiki's pacifism? I love her being an ally of justice but she needs to grow out of her Kira Yamato phase.   you'll never Exterminate with Tsubasa-senpai    Kamen Rider  Hibiki when?  <br>Try to stop me.</br>  <br>G ep 7</br>  <br>/m/ please.</br>  <br>Did this get added to the S3 gaijins already?</br>  <br>Symphogeah is as /m/ as it gets, m8.</br>  <br>It is, I won't deny, but this is /a/, /m/8.</br>  <br><br>Latest version.</br></br>  <br>Well, Maria had experienced the same phase in season 2, it's fair that it's Hibiki's turn this time.</br>   yfw the Noise are a living version of this <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_G<wbr>locke</wbr></br></br>  <br>I want Tsubasa to dominate me.</br>  <br>Nana a best.</br>  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alk<wbr>ahest is what the new Noise are based on.</wbr>  <br> no banana archanoise in ep2 </br>  <br>Nana a  cute. </br>  <br>Season was looks really bad now, plus all the setbakcs they had and schedule problems hurt it a fuckload. S2 was managed a lot better and S3 has been nothing but good stuff</br>  <br>Still, even Dark Oblivion is catchy.. You can almost forgive the Engrish...<br><br>Come to think of it: this song epitomizes Symphogear: outrageous, absurd things that just seem to work, somehow.</br></br></br>  LOVE IS NOT OVEEERRRRR  <br> check-em. </br>   Dark Oblivion <br> Engrish <br>What are you guys talking about, it's clearly a made up language like hymnos or the one that's made by Kajiura.</br></br>  <br> made up language <br> official lyrics is clearly English </br></br>  2 days 5 hours and 20 minutes till Bikkie rams the pendant into her chest with an Aoi Yuuki tier scream  <br>Someone still needs to fix the first one, it's showing Shadow's Throw command not Sabin's Blitz</br>  <br> official lyrics <br> It's just the translated version. </br></br>  <br> 2 days 5 hours and 20 minutes till Kirika and Shirabe save Hibiki's dumb ass. </br>  <br>Done</br>  <br><br>Why is she so fun in audiosurf? How is one woman this good at so much?</br></br>  <br> 9 days 4 hours 58 minutes till people stop bullying Best Girl just because she has some problems. </br>  <br>"don't get hit"</br>  <br>Oh, is Audiosurf 2 any good?</br>  <br>Not getting hit is going to stop working as soon as the dolls start fighting alongside the Noise and not just letting them get killed on their own.</br>  <br>Its got workshop, game types and other things. Pretty good. A big step up from the first.</br>  <br> save Hibiki's dumb ass <br>This season's jam incoming</br></br>  <br>But will it be double jam?</br>  <br>I think a lot of people realize how retarded it is writing-wise, but it's fun as fuck regardless.</br>  <br>Geah doesn't do things halfway</br>  Let me know if there's any problems with it. I think it came out not terrible for a first vector.  <br><br>Provide a screenshot with Sabin's Blitz.<br>Otherweise the throw works since a suplex is a throw.</br></br></br>  <br>But the menu is also showing Shadow selected<br><br>Maybe I can try replaying at least up to when Sabin joins later tonight just to get a screencap for it</br></br></br>  <br> Shirabe jamming to save a hypocrite </br>  <br>I was going to fix it myself, but didn't have the pre-throw image.<br><br>Also it's technically accurate, since if you perform a command the action bar stays full until the command is completed after input, but the command changes to the next character with a full action bar waiitng for theirs.</br></br></br>  <br>You can actually surf now. Closer to waveboarding but eh.</br>  <br> And thats.. Why I don't like.. Hypocrites.. <br>And thus Shirabe dies in front of Hibiki, blood spilling from her mouth like a broken faucet</br></br>  <br>Yes please</br>  <br>That's the most I found.</br>  <br>Post a 10000px version.</br>  <br>Her right eye (left in the image) looks a little bit weird and some of the strands of hair in front of her face have her face color instead of her hair color (at least partially), but aside from that and the issues  posted I'm not noticing much else.</br>  so due to the shitposting will the show pull an injustice on us  but good ?<br><br>gonna request this on the drawthread, gib details</br></br>  <br>I'd also say the anatomy seems a bit fucked up, but that's on the studio.</br>  <br>Request what?<br><br>Drawfag here, and I'm pretty fuckin bored/out of ideas.</br></br></br>  <br> fuck  her into bed</br>  <br>requesting symphogays going injustice duh</br>  <br>Aight well I need a bit more info, the big part being what you mean by "going injustice"<br><br>Think you could show a specific example?</br></br></br>  <br>Funny, those lines only appeared while saving but I think they're fixed.<br><br>How does the eye look weird to you?</br></br></br>  <br>Just open the image up in photoshop or paint.net and touch up the little parts that got messed up. Inkscape has a tendency to have errors when exporting images.</br>  <br>ever read injustice? superman going bad guy because lois died and batman and co try to stop him. basically a poor man's dark knight returns.<br><br>bikki lifting a defeated carol by the hair while shouting at the other cast who are shocked/terrified of what she did</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki going full determination to fist on Miku, if you know what I mean</br>  <br>This was as large as I could illustrator to go without giving me memory errors</br>  Is Hibiki's hair longer in the new logo?  What's with this?<br><br>Am I reading a map from the roman republic or is this a store?</br></br>  <br>That's her scarf.</br>  <br> Long haired Berzikkie <br>My dick and body and general would never be ready</br></br>  <br>Ah, fair enough. Thanks.</br>  <br> Long haired berserbikkie. <br> Kanade has long hair, was kinda batshit at points <br> Berserkbikkie is actually Kanade </br></br></br>  <br>Cuddling under the sheet is much better.</br>    <br>Wasted potential since last season's antifusion</br>  <br> a literally who as the logo <br>Nah.</br></br>  <br>Does Miku have breast cancer?</br>  I wonder if they suck up the carbon from humans hit by noise to later sell it as charcoal to fund the whole gear project  <br>How do they jack off in that school if they have to sleep next to someone every night?</br>  <br>Go funpost somewhere else</br>  <br>Greece pay denbts!</br>  <br>I think it's Hibikis hand touching Mikus breast</br>  <br>Normal girls in that school don't share the bed.</br>  <br>The rooms have two beds, Hibiki and Miku just share one because they're "really good friends"</br>  <br>You mean you don't sleep in the same bed as your purely platonic friends?</br>  <br>It's just to save space, the lower bed can be used as storage place.  Then they got that larger room after Lydian 1 got finéshed </br>  <br>Platonic friends don't do this.</br>  <br>I have a platonic friend and we do this all the time.</br>  <br>I wonder if Miku often stayed over at Hibiki's house and slept with her when she was being bullied. It certainly doesn't look like they only started sleeping together after coming to Lydian.</br>  <br>Little girls should do this for bonding.</br>  <br>Google RIS doesn't come up with anything.<br>What exactly is this from? Looks like a production sketch.</br></br>  <br>Thankfully we get prisma lolis soon</br>  <br>It's a layout frame, probably from some bonus material</br>  <br>Just like in Nanoha and Candy boy?</br>  <br> It certainly doesn't look like they only started sleeping together after coming to Lydian. <br><br>As far as we know, they started sleeping together to save space.<br><br>I wonder if Miku has ever gotten horny from watching or being accidentally groped by a sleeping Hibiki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably uses Hibiki's hand while she's asleep.</br>  <br> I wonder if Miku has ever gotten horny from [...] Hibiki <br>The answer is yes</br></br>  <br> As far as we know, they started sleeping together to save space. <br>More like they could save space because they sleep together. Do you see how big their room is? They didn't need to save space by any stretch.<br><br>At a moment's notice Miku emptied out the bottom bunk, so there's clearly space to move the stuff.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there space for me to sit and watch?</br>  <br>Only if you're best friends with them.</br>    <br>I have no idea what you're talking about, anon. They're just friends.</br>  Reminder that CR has their D-list translators on Symphogear and the first two episodes have so many errors it makes Commie's "smells like teen spirit" look better in comparison.  <br>Still watching them all.</br>  <br>Least it gives us a better raw for others to sub over. Commie are doing okay so far considering H&amp;D's own errors.</br>  <br> CR Rips <br> Better raws  <br>Since when?</br></br></br>  <br>Commie never used a public raw and now H&amp;D doesn't either so no it won't be any better. Commie has had more translation errors, Xythar said it himself. <br><br><br>Why would anyone do this.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki did this on the 3rd day since they moved in together. It looks like she's really used to cuddle up to Miku.</br>  <br>Anyone has a sound webm of that scene?</br>  <br> Kirika screams DESSSSSSSSSSSS like in S2E10 before dieing because she's fucking retarded. </br>  <br>Maybe we can get Finé back if we sacrifice DMJii</br>  <br>I wish</br>  <br> Commie has had more translation errors, Xythar said it himself. <br>huh?</br></br>  <br> Why would anyone do this. <br>Mainly because it's an excuse to watch each episode five times - at times when other people will be watching too.<br>Also it lets you talk about and compare the translations, and other things.<br><br>Why wouldn't anyone do it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fine takes over Shirabe's body again <br> molests Carol </br></br>  <br>Because cancer</br>  <br>I don't have cancer though.

You can just watch a well encoded release like commies multiple times or wait for real subs.</br></br></br>  <br>They all have problems and the only good type setting is Commie's, might as well watch all of them.</br>  <br>Or I could watch them all including the raw and livestream because I enjoy it.</br>   watching anything but commie <br>kek</br>  <br>Different people have different ideas in subtitling, translation, encoding. <br>Looking at all of them and drawing ideas from them or combining them is what makes a good final result.<br>God you're retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>There is an argument for it in the form of correcting mistranslations, but right now Commie are still the best option.</br>    <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=search&amp;cat<wbr>s=3_0&amp;filter=0&amp;term=symphogear+coll<wbr>ection</wbr></wbr></br>    <br>What's funny is that you actually beleive this <br><br><br>You love eating shit I get it no need to repeat yourself. <br><br><br> Different people have different ideas <br><br>Yeah and the majority of them like yours are wrong, you don't need to draw ideas from people that can't translate correct in the first place.

No matter how much CR fucks up a video, it can’t be that bad. And even without that, you mouth breathers need to realize that all TV airings are more or less shit. Yes, simulcast encodes are rather crappy but at least they don’t have to deal with mpeg2. Even fucking funimation of all things regularly beats all TV airings in terms of video quality. <br><br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/123986<br><br><br> Commie never used a public raw and now H&amp;D doesn't either so no it won't be any better. <br>Except that it will be better.</br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Anyone who seriously thinks a web simulcast looks worse than MBS or MX is obviously shit posting, duh.<br> You just wanted to keep the thread alive </br></br>    <br> SU TU RO GA NO FU </br>  <br><br><br><br>キタ━━━(゜∀゜)━━━!!!!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering how out-of-nowhere Beef Stragonoff was, do you think they're meeting a song quota per episode?</br>  <br>I wanted to make some Gear inspired ice cream but now I'll have to do this one first</br>  <br>Not sure about symphogear, but most of the time simulcasts manage to have shit quality being ridden lots of artifacts, washed out colors or being out right blurry. Sakuga shows for instance invariably suffer from this.</br>  <br>The true heroes of the show.</br>  Will the dolls ever sing?  Hibiki a useless shit  <br>I have never ever seen that. I use a different player than what /a/ approves of anyways though.</br>  <br>Carol's seiyuu is an idol, breakdancedoll has the same seiyuu as one of the singing girls from Seireitsukai which had great character songs and music sung by the seiyuu.<br>Let's hope for BD extra songs.</br></br>  <br>You sure you’re not mixing up TV airings and simulcasts here?</br>  <br>Bīfusutoroganofu</br>  <br> The reason we heard the trio song so early is because the final CD is of an FIS trio and doll quartet. </br>  <br>my eyes</br>  <br>I'm still surprised there was no animejanai in that song</br>  <br>Just look at those horrible artifacts in the simulcast. <br><br><br>As you can see, the amount of misinformation flying around about simulcasts is incredible. The amount of retards honestly believing that 1080p rips are worse than 720p ones alone is mind boggling. <br> Maybe </br></br></br></br></br>  Ok I just finished rewatching Symphogeah &amp; G and the 3 eps of GX. <br><br>Its not the anime that has gotten worse its you faggots.</br></br>  Anyone else have a hard time picturing Aoi singing Hibiki's songs? I can pretty clearly imagine Ayahi or Nana singing their character's songs,but Aoi... I guess she's just too cute for such a hot-blooded voice.<br><br> Yes, I know about the Live, watching that would probably help fix this. </br></br>  <br>  The amount of retards honestly believing that 1080p rips are worse than 720p ones alone is mind boggling.  <br>That's still dependant on the natural resultion of the show though.<br>The newer versions of VLC actually do better than MPC but try telling that to /a/</br></br></br>  Listen to my song<br><br>Please tell me<br><br>I love you</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aoi was so nervous she exploded while singing, it's kinda hard to watch. Screaming more than singing, jumping around like a ball of rubber bands.</br>  Unless horriblesubs suddenly started using TV rips yeah, I'm pretty damn certain.  <br> That's still dependant on the natural resultion of the show though. <br>No it’s not, that’s the thing. A 1080p rip might be an upscale but the 720p rip is a downscale of an upscale with less bitrate. Most if not all streaming sites know that users think “higher resolution = better” so they make higher resolution versions better with varying differences as to how much better the higher resolution option is, but you’ll almost never find one that is worse. The difference is particularly big on Youtube and Funimation (last I checked at least), less so on CR. <br>http://screenshotcomparison.com/com<wbr>parison/123974<br><br>And even if a show is horribly upscaled, at least in mplayer and mpv you can just add a filter to scale it down to the desired resolution and let the video output scale it up again. You get all the benefits of the 720p version and your player’s scaling capabilities with the better video quality of the 1080p version. With the added flexibility that you aren’t just limited to 720p, you can scale down to 855, 576 or whatever should you think that’s the show’s original resolution. <br><br> The newer versions of VLC actually do better than MPC <br>Can VLC do anything other than bilinear yet?</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The difference with the normal VLC settings isn't nearly as big as your comparison for me. I see virtually no difference what so ever between 720 and 1080, both not looking that artifact ridden.<br><br> Can VLC do anything other than bilinear yet? <br>Anything that MPC can and some more<br><br>I don't really care about the natural resolution because my full screen and player usually do the work for me and it always looks decent so yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ogawa-san <br> not saving Tsubasa <br>It's almost as if you haven't watched the series.</br></br></br>    <br>I obviously took those shots at parts of the video that eat ridiculous amounts of bitrate to make the difference clearer but the basic principle stays the same. Video player settings don’t have anything to do with this.</br>  <br>Ogawa is a lolicon?</br>  Carol a cute<br>A<br>CUTE</br></br>  <br> vlc </br>  <br><br><br>So did Commie or H&amp;D say anything about starting to use CR as a source instead?<br>I never expected the differences to be that big.</br></br></br></br>    <br> I never expected the differences to be that big. <br>Don't tell me you actually thought you had to watch shitty subbed shitty artifact ridden anime because you thought CR was worse until now</br></br>  <br>Of course they will use CR. Most “fansubs” nowadays are just slightly edited CR scripts slapped onto CR reencodes. That’s nothing new and not worth mentioning. No pokemon filter is also a nice bonus.</br>  <br>There hasn't been any Pokemon filter this season from what I've noticed.</br>  <br><br>No, I always used HS when it was possible, but only this season I realized how much better the 1080p had become, so I wasn't really aware of the quality differences.<br><br>Can't wait for Kirika's glorious transformation in 1080p without artifacts and text.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I need a picture of Carol blushing and trying to hide it by pulling her big hat down over her face.</br>  <br> I always used HS when it was possible <br>Faggot</br></br>  <br>There even is some in the OP, it's not that noticeable though</br>  <br>Pretty sure the K2 scene had a pokefilter when the rockets impacted.</br>  <br>Well what’s this then?<br><br/></br></br>  <br>It's more subtle than it used to be.</br>  <br>There is, it's just weaker than last season's</br>  <br><br><br>Why are you posting CR screenshots, the Pokemonfilter that was in the TV version is not in the CR version.</br></br></br>  <br>Because the MBS was already posted, silly<br/></br>  <br>Because I already posted the TV version and even linked it in the post for comparison.</br>  <br><br><br>You people are confusing me, both posting the same stuff at the same time.</br></br></br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>ftfy</br>  <br>I never got this</br>  <br>I never did either.</br>  <br><br>She wants to eat some Chicken(Zwei) Wings.<br>Tsubasa means wings.<br>She wants to refuel her phonic gain by eating Tsubasa.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>IIRC, It's a "Get me some Water" Line.<br><br>The Cliche about dying horribly, but dying isn't what hurts, It's a little bit of thirst or a twinge of hunger that overwhelms the senses when everything else is shutting down.<br><br>I don't have the time to go back and check right now, so take with a grain of salt.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's from the BD version. <br>The only place i can find it not deleted is on Russian youtube.</br></br>  <br>Go watch the Live, faglord.</br>  <br>You consider him such a faggot that you have to link him twice in one post?</br>  So whats her real name?<br>  she was a qt in the opening of this song </br>  <br>It’s not 1080p that makes a big difference, it’s the CR rip as opposed to a TV rip. <br><br>There’s still a difference between 1080p and 720p from CR, but it’s rather minor, not nearly as big as the difference between 720p and 1080p from Funimation.</br></br></br>  <br>She has the makings of Fine hair if she grows it out some more.</br>   use "down there" to make more sense of Hibiki's embarassment <br> try to justify the choice by changing the dialogue later on from probability to fraction <br> Miku's statement makes no fucking sense though because of course it fucking matters if something is "down there" in a fraction <br><br>Goddamnit Commie.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>efhwl_hibiki-tsubasa-chris-miku-tra<wbr>nsformations_creation</wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br>Shiori Terashima.<br> ANIME JA NAI  is Itaba Yumi, and the remaining one is Kuriyo Andou.</br></br>  <br>I want to date Kuriyo Andou</br>    SEIGI WO SHINJIIIIIIIII  <br><br>I actually can't say which one looks worse.

I think I rated the seasons 6 and 4 respectively.<br><br>Despite this it's now one of my favorite airing shows. The girls. It's all because of the girls.</br></br></br>  <br>Hibiki and all her friends are safe. I know this because if one of them were to die it would be at the end of an episode, not the beginning of one. We've done this dance enough.</br>  <br>Didn't mean to quote.</br>  <br>It feels wrong to genuinely hope for this and yet here I am.</br>  <br>Maria is so cute.</br>  <br>Prepare for the next season: Dancinggear 5Ds</br>  <br>It can't be helped. She's just too good,  even with her massive forehead. </br>  <br>Loli Maria is the cutest!</br>  <br>I want to give loli Maria a proper haircut!</br>  <br>You monster. I bet you want to cut Tsubasa's hair-wing and were glad when long-haired Bikki turned out to be a temporary thing, too.</br>  <br><br>Her haircut looks still better than Kanade's copulating birds-style.</br></br>  <br> no adventures with loli Maria, Kanade, and Tsubasa </br>  <br> long-haired Bikki turned out to be a temporary thing, too <br>What?</br></br>  <br>NIGIRI SHIMEYOUUUU</br>  <br> Not Kanade, loli Maria and loli Tsubasa. </br>  <br>I remember those shopped pics with long-haired Bikkie, but I'm pretty sure that was never a thing in the show, right? Unless I'm missing something I shouldn't.</br>  <br>They are all loli, not just Maria.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>I could have sworn Hibiki had much longer hair (went down to her shoulder blades if memory serves) for like half an episode after she got out of the hospital. I think it was after she was cured of relic cancer after fighting MikuGeah. Now that I see  though, it could have just been edits.</br>  <br>MikuGeah? You can't be serious, Vercingetorix.<br>You installed Laser Beams onto that middle schooler? This isn't one of your anime.</br></br>    <br>I kinda like her like that. I don't see it working right now because it's hard to imagine her fighting with this hairstyle, but "I saved a world years ago and now I'm just having peaceful life with my wife" Bikkie with long hair seems to be nice idea.</br>  Should I actually follow GX's recipe for Beef Stroganoff, or should I just find a recipe like a normal, well-adjusted person?  <br>That's puncherS series Bikkie then</br>  <br> not SingerS </br>  <br>Follow GX's recipe and post the results</br>  <br> not FisterS </br>  <br>If you're a boy I wouldn't bother<br>  You wont know </br></br>   2 day Budoukan <br>You realize we're going to get all the bonus little songs too.

Just make sure the ingredients are good.</br>  <br> Implying they won't make beef stroganoff live on the stage. </br>  <br>I just realized her hair is like a big dumb moustache.</br>  <br>You should definitely follow the show and post pictures</br>  <br><br>So wait.

Is that long-haired image just an edit?<br><br><br>God damn it.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Her Bikkievoice and hair style fucked me up bad the first 5-6 episodes of S1 back in 2012</br>  <br><br>Is this the new Bikkiroach</br></br>  <br><br>Please no.

New Hotness.<br>Yamato status: old and busted.</br>  The show is beyond stale, how did this get greenlit for 2 cours?<br>Today's episode seemed like it was the last one but nope, 24 episodes it is.<br>It's nothing but YAMATO DAISUKI and TAKEO KAKKOII every 3 minutes.<br>There is no real development, there's nowhere to go with these characters and they don't want to focus on suna at least so fuck this show.<br>If it had only been one cour it would've been an easy 8/10 at least, now, no way it gets more than a 6/10 for me.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit, this was actually two cour?</br>  <br>Newly Treated Raspberries, they're delicious</br>  <br>Nigga this show have more development than any other romance comedy show out there.

He is just alpha enough but beta enough to be likable and you can understand why it would take him time to progress</br>  ITT: Anime only fags.<br><br>This does strengthen the couple. <br><br>Also Takeo is not the only one that is "popular".<br><br>They reallly love each other.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br>Nisekoi fags please leave.</br></br>  <br>I'd hardly call 2 episodes and a defeat a chase.<br><br>Me too, but Takeo is just too one dimensional, his personality isn't even much different than your typical romcom MC "I'm just a nice guy that does nice things no matter how mean you are to me" except he just has a unique look and has his big strong guy gimmick.<br>Why does he even love Yamato? He's always spouting daisuki daisuki, but what does he even love about her? Just that she gave his ugly ass the time of day before anyone else?
