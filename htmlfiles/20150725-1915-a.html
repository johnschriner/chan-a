[ What makes Gary so smug?  Who the fuck is CReep now  Post things that are useless.<br>I'll start.</br>  <br>Crunchyroll rips</br>  <br>So, horriblesubs?</br>  <br>Don't you have a world to destroy, Carol?</br>  <br>Just another bot. Sometimes faster sometimes slower.</br>  <br>Threadly reminder that Kirika a cute.</br>  <br><br>Carol is going to use the Symphogear to destroy the world. And thus they are not useless.</br></br>    Why is Gary so best?     that waterfall as hibiki catches miku on her arms <br>This gotta have been on purpose.</br>  Just checking - we all agree that the waterfall here represents the state of Miku's vagina, right?  <br>Of course, Anon.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  Someone make a webm of Maria's jump attack on Garie and then getting rekt  <br>is that tampons?</br>  Probably nothing to worry about.  Can we all agree that the Dolls are by far the best villains that Symphogear has ever had?  <br>Agreed.</br>   mfw this episode <br>This will be just like the time she got her arm bit off, right? She'd just heal it right back, right?</br>  <br>So, what exactly is going on here? How will they apply the Dainsleif to making the gears work again?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>Only if they can top the absurdity of Fine's goal and motivation from season 1.</br>  <br>That's not Fine.</br>    <br>Yes, but I still want to see Ver return somewhere around episode 8 when everybody least expects it.</br>  <br><br>Fine was  fine  too, but the dolls are way more interesting.</br></br>  <br>New pendants.</br>  <br>What else would it be?</br>  <br> shark teeth <br> reaction faces <br> ballerina poses <br> sassy ojousama voice <br> music box plinks mixed in with her clickety-clacks <br>Also voiced by best little witch.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fine was fine </br>  <br>So is the androgynous midget actually a spy? Or is she just an unwitting double agent?</br>  <br>you only want it to shitpost dragoons right?</br>  <br> Or is she just an unwitting double agent? <br>probably this, as Carol gave her the memories she considered necessary</br></br>   those detached sleeves on Maria's Gungnir <br>My dick<br><br>Why is Maria so best</br></br></br>  <br>I agree that the dolls are more interesting.<br><br>Fine's goal and motivation was just so far beyond ludicrous that's its unforgettable.</br></br></br>   Carol has been transferring her memories from body to body over the centuries <br> in order to transfer the memory the body must be a perfect copy of her, to the point that elfnein got rejected on the account of a single mole <br>Doesn't that mean Dwarfja has a vagoo down there?</br></br>  <br> Yes </br>  <br>Carol has long since transcended the need for genitalia.</br>  <br>She punches through a noise to grab her spear and then slices it in half. She really is amazing this season.</br>  this the smug thread?<br><br>Post your favorite smug!</br></br>  <br><br>Sex: Useless</br></br>    <br>Because her combination of powerful, clever, and humorous makes her perfect villain material. Every big villain needs their right hand man, and she's fulfilling her role to the t. <br><br>The real question is: can she be befriended?</br></br></br>  <br>GX is retroactively ruining G for me.</br>  <br>Messi a cute</br>    <br><br>GX is the A's of geah and G is the StrikerS. It's becoming increasingly obvious in hindsight.</br></br>  Do you think the original Carol transferred into her first homunculus body as an adult or has she always been a child? Or maybe  even the very first Carol is a homunculus.   <br>I am surprised she still has KUROI GUNGNIR? since Igalima and Shul Shagana were updated with white color schemes. Understandable since they don't want her to look TOO much like Kanade, but still kinda surprising.</br>  <br>So since she's a body surfing old hag with a few vampiric traits (the whole memories thing), is Carol basically a genderflipped Zouken Matou?</br>   Project Ignite <br> Those spiky looking gears. <br><br>Who thought it was a good idea?</br></br></br>  <br>What a twist!</br>  <br>Updates happen with X-drives, and Maria never X-drived with Gungnir.</br>  <br>Fine was better. It just so happens that the dolls are ludicrously overpowered and the main trio loves to get cocky and aim for the win in unwinnable fights.</br>  <br>Carol, apparently.</br>  <br>Shit they even look evil who approved this</br>  You've failed me for the last time, /a/.  <br>Yes but that's not really saying much.</br>  <br>Everyone loves spikes.</br>  <br>You talkin' shit about the last action hero, son?</br>  <br><br> Her VA is a qt for being 3DPD <br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>Go to bed, Carol.</br>  Are CR subs fine or should I stick with Commie? Don't really care about speed.  <br>Spikes and glowy bits.</br>  <br><br><br/></br></br>  anyone got a link to the previous threads?  They didn't even try to Zesshou  <br>Carol is super cool. I would let her dress me.</br>  <br>I think it's time you went to bed, Carol. What would your dad think of you shitposting here, and poorly no less?</br>  <br>You sure?</br>  <br>...do you think she ever plays dress-up with the autoscorers?</br>  Probably slowpoking here, but thanks to based CR we have creditless shot of this.  <br>With those outfits, she probably already is.</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>Shirabes geah is so stupid.</br>      <br>I want to believe that her chateau is filled with failed clones of herself dressed up in a variety of ways.</br>    <br>Spin2win.</br>  <br>It's progressive. Carol is literally recreating the fashion industry with her brilliance. All those centuries of being alive weren't for nothing. She has been bidding her time to take over the world's fashion.</br>  <br> Grab her braid and drag her into the bedchamber </br>  <br>They should have made this with Durandal instead of using a fucking cursed sword</br>  <br> mfw Garry stolen Hibiki' first kiss. </br>  <br>Now why would they do something like that? You're just being silly.</br>  <br>Durandal and Nehushtan were both destroyed at the end of season 1. A lot of problems could have been solved earlier if they still had berserk beam sword</br>  <br>We'll get through the week somehow.</br>  <br>Here ya go.<br/></br>    <br> looks like signs of berserk <br>S-Sure, nothing to worry.</br></br>  <br>SUBARASHII!</br>  <br>That looks very dangerous.</br>  <br>Excellent.</br>  Why is Hibiki such a bitch?  <br>Woah.</br>  <br>Dear god</br>  <br>The horrors I’ve seen</br>  <br>Can´t help but think they will rebel against Carol and then comes the real evil and the doll GATTAI</br>  Did Nana will it?  <br>Please no</br>  How about some love for Micky?    <br>IT STARTS</br>  I don´t like where this thread is heading...  <br> checkem </br>  <br>speaking of Nehushtan, Hibiki and Genjuro were both able to punch a hole throught it, are you telling me these dolls are sturdier than a fucking complete relic armor</br>    <br>Are we gonna play this game?</br>  <br>Auto-Scorers have the powers to repel/negate the Gear's songs, IIRC.</br>    <br>Cute, but Gary's smug game can't be topped.</br>  <br>This man knows what's up</br>  <br>No they don't. Not even the keywords say that.</br>  <br> Phil and Larry will be forgotten forever <br>I'm okay with this.</br></br>  <br>Pls.</br>  <br><br>and Genjuro is just bullshit, he would probably destroy a doll too</br></br>  Where does all this talk about Carol being century olds come from?<br><br>Speculation? Or did they release another keyword?</br></br>  <br>ALCHEMY, BITCH.</br>  <br>Nehushtan's deal was its regeneration, not its sturdiness iirc</br>   project ignite <br>wild arms 2nd ignition, so bikkie blazer incoming</br>  <br><br>What style of dance is Micky supposed to be styled after?</br></br>  <br>I might be speaking out of my ass here, but Nehushtan was known for great regenerative properties, not necessarily studyness. Even when Fine/Nehushtan was split in half by Hibiki, she still regened like nothing</br>  <br> http://www.symphogear-gx.com/keywo<wbr>rds/key21.php</wbr> <br>Keyword, Homunculus.</br></br>  <br>I snagged this from the first thread and expect to get some use out of it. Does that count?</br>  <br>Keywords go up at the same time as episodes. She's been transferring her consciousness through homunculus bodies for centuries, but she has very high standards so only absolutely perfect clones are acceptable candidates. Elfnein is a failure.</br>   Kikukoman <br> Kikuko <br> Mamu's VA is Kikuko Inoue <br>Those sly bastards.</br></br></br>  <br>Nehushtan was for regen tanking, not mitigation or evasion tanking.</br>  Poor girl, this episode but her straight into last place in the useless trio.  <br>I'd love to see Genjuuro wreck a doll in hand-to-hand combat, preferably Micha, the combat doll.</br>  <br>You best step off</br>  <br> Micky will be the first to be befriended. </br>  <br><br>But muh aerodynamics.</br></br>  <br>Control surfaces!</br>  <br>Rule of cool</br>  Genjuro is cool and all, plus he makes a great master/dad. But the fact that he doesn't ever do anything despite being so retardedly strong is fucking annoying.  <br><br>the only reason Noise/Arcanoise exist is so Genjuro doesn't solve everything himself</br></br>    <br>Genjuro tried to do something a few episodes ago but Aoi (the useless bridge bunny, not Ao-chan) went all " m-muh chain of command" on him.</br>  <br>That one is actually cool as shit.</br>  <br>I always wonder why Genjuuro is a great father figure for all the gears except for Tsubasa which is his real niece.</br>    But dat ass tho.  <br>Go watch Dragon Ball Super if you want strong men doing strong men things.</br>      <br> Genjuuro and Ogawa get tacticool on dolls <br><br>I'd watch it.</br></br></br>    What is your Geah relic and what is your song, /a/?  <br>I predict that Larry will be first since the imouto thing seems like a point that can be exploited for friendship. Phil will follow. Micky will be almost be befriended but will be taken down by Gary who will be the true final boss.</br>  <br>Ogawa maybe.<br><br>Genjuuro would just wreck their shit in melee really, really hard.</br></br></br>  <br> Mikugeah will never return <br>The only downfall of GX</br></br>  <br>Ogawa is the spy and preliminary "covert ops to take out defenses" guy, while Genjuuro is the Shock Troop.<br><br>Everyone has a role that can be used Tacticoolly</br></br></br>  <br> Gary who will be the true final boss <br>Please let this be what really happens.</br></br>  <br> Danslief upgrades go berserk <br> Miku gear show up and purify everything back to its original form. <br><br><br>I still hope.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was all according to her plan.</br>  <br>Tacticool =/= Cool tactics.</br>   yfw you realize that Genjuro is more useless than Maria   <br>He's useless because the writers have it out for him, Maria is just useless by nature.</br>  <br>Hey, he does important work. Like standing around and commenting on what is currently happening.</br>  <br> those claws <br>Kirika's in for some painful pinches.</br></br>  <br>It was two dolls.<br><br><br> WOW, YOU NEED TWO DOLLS TO DEFEAT ME. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Homunculus.<br><br>Artificial lifeforms created through the secrets of alchemical technology. The bodies of Carol and Elfnein are also called this.<br><br>The original Carol was born in Europe several hundred years ago. Some time later, she succeeded the will of her late father, an alchemist. In order to find the answer to a question that would take far longer than her lifespan to solve, she began to transfer her memories to homunculus vessels, surviving to the present day.<br><br>Carol only performs memory transfer to those bodies which she deems to be more than perfect, and those which fail to match her standard are instead used as manual labour or as subjects in human experiments.<br><br>As Elfnein does not possess the mole under Carol's right eye, she was originally to be disposed of as a failed product. However, the construction of the Chateau de Tiffauges required extra labour, and thus she was able to avoid her fate.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Glad that Garie isn't completely relegated to a support role.  I haven't really been keeping up; are there any theories about who the eyes in the background of this bit of the OP might belong to?  <br> Failed product because it doesn't have a mole <br>Huh, that means Carol didn't have anything down there too.</br></br>  <br>Cute</br>  <br>I suppose its Carol and Elfnein's.</br>  <br>Does Carol has a cunny?</br>  <br>The more important question is does her cunny have a braid too?</br>  <br>They're adult-style eyes so at least one of them is probably Carol before she started living as a homunculus.</br>  <br>Neither of them have cat eyes though, do they?</br>  <br>she also has green hair, but whatever, that mole is more important</br>  I love Garie, she's pretty  hot_   <br><br>The little semicircles in the bottom of Elfnein's eyes don't appear quite as purple as Carol's  yet .</br></br>  What a dumb bitch.    <br>Fine does.<br>It's Elfnine when Fine awakens inside her.</br></br>  <br>Seriously, when did Gallie had the time to swap the water clone? Micky was being punched non-stop.<br>I don't mind Bikki losing but make it coherent.</br></br>  Red dolljoints = blue dolljoints &gt; yellow dolljoints &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; shit &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<wbr>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; green dolljoints</wbr>  <br>After Hibiki launched Micha away. Garie can make illusions, she could have hid the fact that Micha landed immediately after getting hit the first time and at the same time projected the fake Micha flying through the air that Hibiki punched.</br>  <br>She materialized the illusion out of the water in the air after Biki's manly rescue.<br><br>The water was everywhere, so it would only take a split-second.</br></br></br>  <br>why are so many people hating on green? while she isn't best girl she's really cool, why do people hate her?</br>  <br>Because they have shit taste.<br><br>Blue &gt; Green = Red &gt;&gt;&gt; Yellow</br></br></br>  <br><br>What is every ones dance?<br><br>Red is ??? <br><br>Blue is Ballerina<br><br>Green is some kinda Tango / Mexico dance<br><br>Yellow JoJo poses</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>shes ugly and she hasnt done anything yet</br>  <br> Mexico dance <br>Kek.</br></br>  <br>Clown, Ballerina, Flamenco, Nigger.</br>  <br>She can most likely make things invisible too, not just create illusions out of nowhere. Makes it really easy to swap things out.</br>  <br>Yellow is break dancing<br><br>Red might not have a dance since she was built specifically for combat</br></br></br>  <br> Mexico dance <br>Is that the one where they chop peoples heads off?</br></br>  <br>  Still says Gurdians even though the website has the right spelling <br>Satelight pls</br></br>  <br>I cant believe no one has posted the butt-joints.</br>  <br>The spikes will be temporary.<br>I hope.</br></br>  <br> maria simultaneously almost badass and almost fucks up hard <br>I can't wait until she gets Airgetlam and gets her rematch and breaks the smug</br></br>  <br>Red is jazz hands.</br>  <br>At this rate, she might actually become half-worthy of her new gear being a ripoff of Signum.</br>  <br> the spikes are alive <br> gears grow spikier and spikier as Dansleif's influence on them grows <br> full edgelord mode by the end of the season <br>   All gears collectively say "I can't fight with these spikes!" <br>   Stomp them off </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think when Carol built Micha she noticed that she moved very mechanically so in her following dolls she programmed some movesets for more fluent movement. She also improved some other stuff, therefore Garie is the only one that can transfer memories</br>  <br> maria <br> anything like signum <br>You insult me.</br></br></br>  <br>Capoeira.</br>  Almost looks like she borrowed clothes from Shirabe.  I FUCKING CALLED THAT SHIT LAST WEEK FAGGOTS.<br><br><br>MARIA IS USELESSFAGS BTFO</br></br></br>  <br>Samba.</br>  <br>that would be cute</br>  <br>Not enough pink to be Shirabe.<br><br>Looks like something Chris would wear, but there's no way that's Chris' because it's not drooping off  it .</br></br></br>  <br>Samba isnt Sambo u fukn nerd</br>  Official doll rating, all other ratings are  Valid too <br><br>Blue &gt; Red &gt;&gt; Yellow &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Green</br></br>  <br>The title this week was really clever.<br>It referred to both Maria using Gungnir again and Hibiki making a comeback.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>and Gungnir was used twice this episode. It fits all the pun.</br>  <br>Best tastes.</br>  <br>As much as I want Yellow to not be last because of dat hair, she's kinda last at this point. Though she's also received by far the least characterization, and we have no explanation for the giant ghost thingy yet, so she still has potential. <br><br><br>I don't think anyone besides die-hard trolls actually thinks Maria is still useless</br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128548498 <br>For you, maybe.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128548498 <br>She got taller, sometimes growing girls do that.</br>  <br> giant ghost thingy <br>That's Leiur's 'little sister', basically a giant Autoscorer based on Leiur.  Read the keywords. </br></br>  <br> What are you gonna do, stab me? </br>  <br>I don't know. Greens personality just rubs me the wrong way compared to yellow. <br><br>Blue and Red are still a best though.</br></br></br>  I wonder when dess death desu gets a power upgrade.  <br> As much as I want Yellow to not be last because of her short ugly hair <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Their hearts are too weak to handle the passion of flamenco.<br><br> Garie &gt; Phara &gt; Leiur &gt; Micha </br></br></br>  <br>DUMB<br>BITCH<br><br>HIBIKI A SHIT</br></br></br></br>  <br> tsubasa is samurai <br> phara is flamenco </br></br>  <br> people don't believe in Justice anymore <br>Symphogear is doomed.</br></br>  <br><br><br> Ogawa shadow weaving the dolls with something like an smg or Wanted-tier bullet physics <br> Genjuro going HAM on their paralyzed bodies </br></br></br></br>  <br>I said Maria's new gear is a ripoff of Signum, what with the chain whip and all.<br><br>Maria herself is nowhere near as awesome as Signum, but she MIGHT become worthy of that new gear if she continues to act like she did this episode.</br></br></br>  <br>There are no heroes left in man</br>  Those power levels  So what's your dream Symphogear episode? Here's mine:<br>Tsubasa gets a booty call from Maria to meet her at the concert arena. She gets there, turns out it was Carol and the concert organizers using a voice modifier. All of the Autoscorers are there too. They've stolen all of her swords and they tell her she has to follow all their instructions and whatever happens to her she has to act like she enjoys it. If she doesn't, they will break all of her swords and get their concerts canceled.<br><br>So the next day, Tsubasa walks into a room wearing diapers and a pacifier, acting like a retarded baby. All of the Autoscorers are there and they give her the hardest, most brutal gangrape in history. As instructed, Tsubasa acts like she completely enjoys it and asks for more.<br>Then in walks that guy Dr. Ver from season 2. Turns out he joined the Autoscorers for revenge. He's been eating a special protein-only diet for weeks just for this. He pulls down his pants and partially defecates the longest, thickest, hardest log ever, and proceeds to use it to give Tsubasa the most furious ass-to-ass action ever recorded. Tsubasa can't hold her tears anymore, but pretends they're from pleasure. It's finally over.<br><br>Then Carol reveals the room they're in is actually see through from the outside, and they're in the concert arena. All of the audience has been watching Tsubasa get gangbanged and enjoy it, and it's been broadcasted worldwide. They finally kick her out of the premises, and break all of her swords anyway.<br><br>Later, Tsubasa runs into Maria, who tells her she didn't know she was such a straight CIS scum. Her lolis walk in and proceed to have passionate sex with her in front of Tsubasa, and after they finish, pee all over Tsubasa, much to Maria's delight<br><br>After the ending credits, Tsubasa is wandering off on a road in the middle of nowhere. A speeding car runs her over and breaks her spine, but it's non lethal. She is left laying there in extreme pain for days, and finally dies of hunger.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Drink bleach.</br>  <br>We have to believe in justice for them, anon.</br>    Next time on Symphogear As...<br><br> Lesbians Check <br> Get wrecked by loli villan &amp; her non-human guardians Check <br> Get upgraded devic- I mean symphogears Check </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but who has more PHONIC GAIN??</br>  So no ring around the moon in this scene? It wasn't even fixed in the BDs.

One article said the GX bd's but any place that has them up for pre-order doesnt mention the tickets.  <br>I see them being presented more as "things" than "people," which makes me strongly suspect they will be destroyed.</br>  <br>They are not on sale yet, Anon.<br>Supposedly the first and second BD will have codes for a raffle in which you can win tickets for the Live.(Day 1 and 2, respectively.)</br></br>  <br>This. What really separates the dolls from the other henchmen of past seasons is that they're totally loyal creations instead of manipulated angsty girls. Since each of them are a part of Carol's personality the destruction of each is symbolic of overcoming Carol herself. <br><br>Also it would solve the problem of character bloat that killed the Nanoha franchise.</br></br></br>  How many episodes until they befriend all the dooru and going to school together?  <br> totally loyal <br>Garie's loyalty is anything but guaranteed at this point.</br></br>  <br>Literally worse than Sayaka.</br>  <br>That's going a little far, anon.</br>  <br>I wonder what sort of noise the doll joints will make as they're torn apart.</br>  <br> GET YOUR FILTHY HANDS OFF MY GUNGNIR YOU WORTHLESS SLUT </br>  <br>Fixed that for you</br>  <br>Thing is Garie probably won't be good if she defects, just a bigger bad than Carol. Chris and the others all became good, but I don't see the same happening to Garie.</br>  <br>I 100% expect Commie to do that.</br>  <br>It would be more likely that Carol changes her mind about things but is unable to stop Garie from going nuts.</br>  <br>I saw a couple anons throwing around the "little sister" thing a while ago. Didn't realize it was from the keywords. Did they explain how she materializes and dematerializes like she did? Her wavy fade-out didn't look much like the alchemical transportation crystals we've seen so far.</br>  Taking Maria's gungnir must have infected Bikki with uselessness. I've never seen a bigger job in my life.  Will Mikugear really not return? I don't completely buy that a gear that erases gears wouldn't give itself some kind of failsafe incase it accidentally had its own weapon turned against itself.  <br><br>I agree, I can see Garie mutinying, but not defecting. Her personality is super entertaining, but it's not suited to being a good guy.</br></br>  <br>Wow, Hibiki really is a hypocrite then.</br>  <br>Wouldn't you react in the same way if Maria of all fucking people used your Gear to save you, Anon?

It was done in slow motion so the audience could understand what's going on.</br>  <br>Zoning?</br>  <br> Chris higher than Tsubasa <br>I can't imagine this when Tsubasa is an expert at close AND has long range attacks.<br><br>Her KEN-N-YOOOOOO would probably be made to punish from anywhere on the screen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Riding the Nephilim</br>  <br>He would fight using sugita's screams.</br>  <br> Nephlim pet <br> Summon noise <br> &gt;Bitch slaps </br></br></br>  <br> No Chris (Nehushtan Armor&gt; on the list <br><br>Why didn't you unlock her?</br></br></br>  <br> Yumi Itaba <br> not AT LEAST A tier <br><br>Maybe if you're a button-mashing casual. Truly skilled players universally acknowledge Not Anime as one of the most powerful characters in the game.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Perfect.<br><br>https://d.maxfile.ro/hpbbtgerat.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I know she's listed under S class, but without a reason to fight you, you may as well be fighting jigglypuff.</br>  <br>By arcade you mean side scroller beat em up, or one on one fighting game?</br>  <br> Tsubasa can't shiri panchi </br>  <br>Because  DLC </br>  <br>I think it's a good localization and it does sound pretty cool, but it would have been better off left untranslated. All the relics come from different places and we lose that feeling by translating it. It's like if they translated Gungnir from Norse.</br>   I actually downloaded the episode both HS and Creep version <br>Fuck.</br>  <br> Just a sparring match for the trio/FIS/Genjuro <br> Antagonists refuse to be befriended <br><br> seriously needing a reason for allies to fight in fighting games <br><br>Don't tell me you play story mode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can she summon double zeta?</br>  <br> you may as well be fighting jigglypuff <br> he doesn't know that jiggs is one of the best characters in melee </br></br>  So are we ever going to get cheerful, genki Hibiki back? I mean she got her gear back only to get raped right away. Not going to lie but she's been shit this season.  <br> implying all her flashy anime shit wouldn't have dog shit frame data </br>  <br> Don't tell me you play story mode. <br>I will even play the shitty COD campaigns, story mode  aka 1 player  is best.<br><br>Besides, even though Biki is an easy A rank fighter in a normal, fired up situation, she's only S rank in zerker mode or with geah limiters removed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>We had cheerful genki Hibiki in the first episode. That is probably going to be all we're getting for the season</br>  <br>With precise timing, her ANIME JYA NAI can cancel opponents' supers.</br>  <br> even play the shitty COD campaigns <br> even play COD <br> play COD </br></br></br>  Am I the only one who thinks this episode was badly executed or what?  <br> he doesn't know competitive smash is for kids and autists </br>  <br>I don't mind drama but it just seems like they introduced this brooding and depressed side of her out of nowhere. Like she knows she wants to protect people so how couldn't she understand that sometimes you have to fight to do that? I'm glad Miku finally helped her understand again but it's kind lame that she had to get her ass kicked immediately.</br>  <br>Yes, you are the only being in the world who thinks that.</br>  What's going to be the catch for Dainslef? Time limits? Chris and Tsubasa need to drug up to handle it? It's part of Carol's keikaku to get stronger songs to steal to power her doomsday machine?  <br>Bloodlust.</br>    <br>That's not a smug expression, fool.</br>  What the fuck is Genjuro even doing? How can he be so lenient?  <br>Ranged noise with low mobility and defense but good but delayed zoning, with a Nephilim burst that turns him into a rushdown character with high defense and/or super armor frames. Extra vulnerability after the burst. Because Zoning is delay, if you don't convert after the burst you loose a lot of momentum.</br>  <br>I agree completely. It's an unnecessary translation, but if it HAS to be translated, it's a pretty decent one.</br>  <br>Man what were the designers thinking when they made Chris? She's like Morridoom on steroids. And don't get me started on the ridiculous amount of recovery her Megadeth Symphony has. You can just spam that all day long.</br>  <br>Hibs is going through her rebellious phase. Both Tsubasa and Chris got one, now it's her turn.</br>  I thought we wouldn't get elemental puns but Garie really is best elite four.  <br> go into Red Hot Blaze <br> forget that you have to actually pull the trigger once the "lock on" animation completes <br> opponent walks up and KOs you </br></br></br>  <br> not playing literally every /v/ and watching literally every /a/ <br>And if I'm not mistaken, I was using it as a comparison to shit, so unrustle yourself.</br></br>  <br><br>  it's a good localization <br>It's not, though, that's the thing. "Ame-no-Habakiri" wouldn't be "Heavenrend" but "Snakerend".</br></br></br>  <br>Snakeslayer, rather.</br>  <br> It's kind lame that she had to get her ass kicked immediately <br>It's like you never watched this show. She will be back at full power in the next episode.</br></br>   Maria was willing to take off the gear and allow herself to get stabbed rather than letting Gungnir get damaged <br><br>Best. Girl.</br></br>  <br> Maria completely ignored the jam and didn't act like a bitch when Hibiki was a bitch to her and instead helped her out <br>I'm glad I share a birthday with her.</br></br>  <br>This now proves that All Gears = Best Girl.<br>Maria was in useless tier before, but now she improved.</br></br>  <br>I wonder if the dolls are ordered by Carol not to engage unless their symphoGEAH are activated<br><br>She doesn't look very happy about it, near the end of episode 3 she's unhappy Biki couldn't get Gungnir out too.<br><br>Does this means Carol will lose control of them later into the series and the dolls start going on rampage? are they the final boss?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maria and Tsubasa are JAMbrothers now.</br>  The bad guys this season are too much fun. I just want more of them.  <br> fgsfds </br>  <br>One of the many things I love in Symphogear is that the villains are so fucking lovable.</br>  <br>It wasn't on purpose, Gear armour doesn't shatter like that when you turn them off. The feedback was too much for her, and she couldn't maintain the transformation.<br><br>It was a good thing, though, and it's really a wonder she managed to hold it that long with how many flashy attacks she was spamming without Linker.</br></br></br>  <br>The sound team for the dolls is great, all the little mechanics and musical noises when they move, plus smug shark teeth faces.</br>   still no lossless rips of G-Beat and Little Miracle <br><br>I know at least a couple of you people have it by now and it's not just Japan anymore. Y'all have some explaining to do.</br></br>  <br>Why don't you buy it yourself and support Symphogear?</br>  <br> LOOK ME IN THE EYES DON'T YOU FUCKING LOOK AWAY <br> While blood was gushing out of said eyes and mouth <br><br>I knew Maria is badass</br></br></br></br>  OP visuals change when?  Holy shit that ending was completely unnecessary. It's one thing if she loses but why the fuck did they have to make her eyes so dead and Miku freak out like that?  <br>Maybe she got some of Tsubasa`s alphaness when Tsubasa started to do hideous things to her every night.</br>  <br>Lewd photoshops</br>  No one can beat Tsubasa's JAM.<br>  Serena is second best JAM[/spoile] </br>  <br>Its Miku's first time seeing Hibiki as bad as that.<br><br>Plus we know the dolls called Hibiki a sacrifice, I wonder if they didn't do something else to her</br></br></br>  <br>Impact, and in this case it is a wise choice.<br>We know she is not dead, but we know she get her ass kicked and that this enemies are clearly not playing around.</br></br>  <br> The fucking bat boots for Chris <br>2spooky</br></br>  <br> Forgetting pro JAM master EVO 2020 winner Kanade. </br>  <br> enemies are clearly not playing around <br>They're still playing around. If they weren't, they would have been dead this episode.</br></br>  <br> Implying it's not derebasa in bed and Maria who is doing hideous things to her every night. </br>  Is there a complete album of all the attack cards (or at least all the attack cards through S1 and G) somewhere? I'd like to have them all and while I'm not opposed to rewatching Symphogear AGAIN, it would be faster if they're just... somewhere.    <br>Kanade is the  ASH  master.</br>  <br>Their goal is disabling the gears. Anything further is unnecessary</br>  <br> commie is out <br>H&amp;D when?</br></br>   those screams in GX ver Ressou Gungnir <br>10/10, Youko's voice is sex made auditory</br>  DMJii are glorious and are the main ones I care about. They're really doing a good job of making Hibiki shitty this season. I love how she said that Gungnir was for protecting people when that's exactly what Maria did by protecting all of them.  <br>It is implied the girls are necessary for the plan they have. Probably they need the upgrades gears will have.<br><br>Why do you think they made Hibiki transform just to destroy her gear?</br></br></br>  Today's radio show  <br>Bound by orders means they're not fully serious, they still hesitate to kill.</br>  The best part of Hibs getting btfo was Garie was using actual tactics against her. Something the entire geah team is probably completely unfamiliar with since all they do is bulldoze their way through every situation. Garie is already the smartest character in symphogear.  <br>Are you from future, or just trying to troll us?</br>  <br>Now you've gotten my hopes up. I'm going to be very disappointed if this isn't the line they use or they don't replace ame no habakiri on the screen with Heavenrend.</br>  <br>Did they bring up the topic of Nana`s drawing?</br>  <br><br>I can see this happen.</br></br>  <br>Chris, Hibiki, and FIS probably don't know much about tactics but I'm pretty sure Tsubasa would be able to match them tactically. She did survive two years fighting the noise by herself after Kanade died. Plus Tsubasa has already been shown to be the most tactically minded amongst them, especially in her fight against fine at the end of the first season.</br>  <br>Next thursday.</br>  <br>We all know who the true smartest is.</br>   S4 <br> Enemies are the custodians <br>   They aren't evil at all and the shit they do is just to see if humans are worthy of language </br></br>  <br>Of course. She didn't actually know it was in the episode until it aired, and she joked about being nervous that anything she says or draws at an event could somehow end up in the show.</br>   the beef stroganoff song was removed from YT for copyright <br><br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br>Looks like she'll be more cautious of what she says and draws in future events now.<br> I want to bully Nana. </br></br>  How am I supposed to endure this wait? I marathoned the first two seasons after they finished airing.  <br>if they kill the gears they would be hard pressed to find another compatible gear user</br>  <br>King Records.<br>They're really good at bringing down shit.</br></br>  I know we're calling JAM and all but does it really count if she didn't sing her Zesshou?<br><br> Did Maria always have a cleavage window in Gungnir? </br></br>  <br>It looks like strawberry JAM like Tsubasa`s so no one gives a fuck.</br>  <br>Cleavage was previously covered in spandex.<br><br> Spandex was better. </br></br></br>  So, wich Geah will be burn first?  <br> Project Ignite <br> ignite <br>Holy shit, I didn't make that connection. Did Elfnein pick that name on purpose?</br></br></br>  <br>Tsubasa.<br>Then Chris.<br>Then everyone else.<br>Then Bikki saves them.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How can she save them if she gets burnt too? Your algorithm makes no sense.</br>  <br>Its all part of Carol`s keikaku to destroy all miracles.</br>  <br>I really hope all Geahs get IGNITE upgrades  provided IGNITE is a permanent upgrade and not something they have to get rid of because of it's drawbacks , because just the main trio getting it for the sake of keeping them one step above FIS would be annoying. If the writers are trying to make FIS just as important as the main trio (which they seem to be going for so far in GX), it would be counterproductive to only give the upgrade to the main trio.<br><br>Of course, they need either a reliable source of LiNKER or a viable workaround before that.</br></br></br>  <br>With Miku this wet it will be impossible to burn Bikkie.</br>  <br><br>Ignite, those 4 slits they showed on the chest? They cut into you or cause your BLOOD TO BOIL hence Ignite, The most combat you do the stronger you get but the hotter your blood boils, Hence Sword is gonna go full HAM causing her to go zerker modo.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but Carol would never pick that name or influence Elfnein to pick it, given her past. What if Elfnein deliberately chose it to bother Carol?<br><br> have to yell IGNITE to activate the system <br> Carol gets triggered every time </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bikki's, obviously.</br></br>  <br>do you even have to ask</br>  <br> Carol would never pick that name or influence Elfnein to pick it, given her past <br>Why not? They burnt her dad, she will burn their world. It's all about revenge.</br></br>  Ironically, I found myself rooting for the antagonists to win for some reason. It's pretty much one-sided victory in their favor, but the tides should turn once Elfnein's plan comes to fruition.<br><br>Also, Garie is the best Autoscorer.</br></br>  <br>I can't fucking stand her voice but she does have the best personality so far, and I have a weakness for water and ice powers</br>  <br>Her voice fits her personality well. Micha's VA, however, is fucking grating as hell.</br>  <br>Fight me.</br>  <br>Yeah, the voice does fit her personality, that's very true. I still hate it. Micha's is less annoying, but still bad.<br><br> Is there a program that stitches automatically, or are stitches like this done by hand? </br></br></br>  <br> Episode Nana <br> Nana looses her voice from screaming because she is literally burned to death <br> Hibiki and friends can only watch  <br><br>Screencap this post</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Carol literally burst into tears at the sight of a burning building in episode one. A several hundred year old alchemist hagloli ought to know better than to name her projects after her trauma.</br>  <br> Photoshop, or just ask google you idiot. </br>  <br> Tsubasa is burned to death <br>Fuck.<br><br>Nana please.<br>Don't let this happen.<br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> hating on Garie or Micha's voices <br>End yourselves.</br></br></br>  <br>I use Microsoft ICE to do everything for me and clean them by using Adobe CC. Sometimes I use CC's photomerge if it doesn't look good.</br>  Butt.  <br> burned to death <br>I CAN'T HEAR YOU ITSUKI TRA LA LA LA LA.</br></br>  <br>Nah, if true it's all for her revenge. Her father burned, and now everyone else will burn too. It makes sense.</br>  <br> name project after your trauma <br> cry every time someone mentions it later <br><br>Carol a cute.</br></br></br></br>  Does Miku not get a transformation sequence? Rewatching G and there is nothing...  <br>It's a BD extra only.</br>  <br>In the show or an additional and separate file? I'm watching the BD. Unless the subs lied.</br>  <br>It's own file, I think it was on volume 4.</br>  Is Maria a charge character? I want to main her.  <br> BD extra  <br> subs <br>Hahahahaha.  Separate file, RAW. </br></br></br>  Is there any reason to use commie now that we have CR/HS?   proper symphogear scales never <br>Only that meh bunnysuit chris one<br><br>I will always be holding out hope for FIS Nendos though  but the Maria one, if they make it, will never be perfect because it'll be EITHER Airgetlam or Gungnir, not both </br></br></br>  <br>We'll have a rainbow of Chris bunnies before getting any other figure.</br>  <br><br>Commie has better flow and translation than HS. I'm not even joking.</br></br>  <br> don't even sub the songs <br> better </br></br>  <br>CR's encode may be good but holy fuck their subs are shit. People may consider Commie to be meme-tier and straying too far from the source but it's definitely not as bad as CR.</br>  <br>You're not the only one</br>  Tsubasa will save this show.  <br> 555999 <br>shit</br></br>  <br> saving something that doesn't needs to be saved <br>Sounds pointless, maybe even useless. Is she a new Maria or something?</br></br>    <br>Don't compare Tsubasa to Maria.</br>  <br>Dual trips of destiny and truth.</br>  <br>Nana`s will strikes again.<br> You better not lie, Nana. </br></br>  <br>Hazama?</br>  <br>Tsubasa is so sugoi kakoi desu</br>  <br>Kirika is so goddamn glorious. I loved the way she showed up like this. Can't wait for Shirabe's transformation now.</br>  <br> <br>http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>efhwl_hibiki-tsubasa-chris-miku-tra<wbr>nsformations_creation</wbr></wbr></br> </br>  <br>That's pretty damn good.</br>  <br>Its probably my favorite transformation in the series besides DESS DESS DESS</br>  <br> that transition of a shocked expression when her headgear attaches to an empty one </br>  <br><br>What else did she say? Telll us all the juicy details anon.</br></br>  <br>Rather than mutiny, she's probably controlling Carol with her memory manipulation even now. She'll just be showing her true colors once Carol either tries to give up or has cause to suspect her.</br>   this is my Gungnir <br>That one wasn't.<br> it's supposed to save people <br>Maria just saved your sorry ass.<br><br>I know she had a phase, but come on.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blame the writer, not her.</br>  Just asking something about 4 dolls name<br><br>Jawkân = bastoni da polo<br>Darâhim = denari <br>Suyûf = spade<br>Tûmân = coppe<br><br>Is that right?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This guy has a point.<br><br>That Gungnir was actually Maria's, not her's.<br><br>Man, Bikki became a fucking bitch.<br><br>She's probably one of the worst girls in the show right now. What the fuck happened?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>GX is supposed to develop Hibiki this time around, So we're supposed to get up all of her pent of angst and despair.</br>  <br>Yellow's hair put her to best doll.</br>   post yfw the original 3 go berserk and the FIS trio have to fight them   <br> So we're supposed to get up all of her pent of angst and despair. <br><br>Didn't we go through this in Season 1?<br><br>Wasn't this like the downside of the entire fucking show?<br><br>DIDN'T SHE WENT THROUGH THE FUCKING TRAINING MONTAGE TO STOP SUCKING?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's really annoying when dolls aren't even human, and they cause harm to people all the time. Hope Bikki really gets a grip now.</br>  <br>No, We only got the surface of it in S1.<br><br>Hibiki's lived a hard life.</br></br></br>  Why don't you download it?  <br>How much more development does she fucking needs? She already went through a damn lot in S1 and then again in S2. I thought the show was named Symphogear, not Hibiki.</br>   Ogawa goes to help <br> Does absolutely nothing </br>   [HorribleSubs] Senki Zesshou Symphogear GX - 04 [720p].mkv <br><br>Threadly reminder that 1080p is superior in every regard and your only excuses to download the 720p are severe limitations in bandwidth, monitor size, disc space or processing power. <br>Stop watching anime on toasters already, stop insulting this great show by watching it in not the best available quality option.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria tagged along, she was more suited to take action against Noise.</br>  <br>He spun his car.</br>  <br>Not enough bullet to do multiple shadow weave.</br>  <br> watching upscales <br>I get the same effect just fullscreening a 720p without wasting space.</br></br>  <br> Hibiki is a bitch for all of an episode and a half  <br> still waiting to get her character development since season 1  <br><br>Meanwhile Maria cried in the fetal position for ten fucking episodes.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The over edge works of goddess zababa</br>   Despite three seasons and the most amount of focus and screentime Hibiki is still an angsty whiny bitch <br>Why is this allowed?<br><br>Even Maria has managed to grow more than Hibiki in just 4 damn episodes.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah Hibike never changes. She gets lucky and has her friends bail her out, or is forced to fight because there is no other option, but for the most she never does anything significant on her own. She never develops her own ideals and shit. Miku for example is still going through the same shit she has been going through since S1.</br>  /a/, explain to me how they had a golden opportunity to have him say GUNGUNIIRU DATTO again, and yet passed up on it. <br><br>Japan, you had one job.</br></br>  <br> He heads out again at the end of the episode <br><br>He probably won't do anything again though.</br></br></br>  <br>Useless curse is still in effect. Wait until it returns to Maria  or go to someone else, maybe DMJii </br>  <br><br>Anime nowadays are usually produced at higher resolutions than 720p, you're watching a downscale that experienced a loss of information and detail.</br></br>  <br>Hey leave evil ryu alone, he's gotta run a strike team here</br>  <br> Tsubasa was a huge bitch for an episode or two in both S1 and S2  <br> Chris was a retard before Genjuro diffused her edge with a martial art techniqe  <br> Maria was useless for more than half of G  <br> Shirabe and Kirika were borderline retarded for almost the entirety of G  <br> Before the season even starts staff says GX will finally be about Hibiki's development and she will go through some thing  <br><br>Wow Hibiki is such a huge fucking bitch for having character flaws that have yet to be resolved.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but Hibiki isn't a character. She's just a device to deliver me cool actions scenes. How dare she develop.</br>  <br>Gungnir datto will happen when Hibiki transform without pedant because she has relic in chest again.</br>  <br> it just seems like they introduced this brooding and depressed side of her out of nowhere <br><br>You clearly were not paying attention for about 26 episodes.</br></br></br>  <br><br>WHAT THE FUCK WAS THE TRAINING MONTAGE FOR ANYWAY?</br></br>  <br>But Hibiki is all of those things, AT THE SAME TIME. She's a useless borderline retarded bitch right now.</br>  <br>Dealing with entirely different problems?</br>  <br>In S1: So she can learn how to fist, and that it's okay to fist when necessary. Season finale shows that she still doesn't know when it is necessary, so nothing really changed.<br>In S2: So Hibiki can forget about her problems instead of dealing with them.</br></br>   that scream when Hibiki's Gungnir get's pierced <br>Jesus Christ</br>  <br>Not that anon, but I'll try to say things about what that radio show episode contained.<br>"I'll be back" is the first line Nana said, then they laughed, Nana said she isn't actually back or something.<br>Nana calls Genjuuro "Genjuuro-san".<br>They talked about Tsubasa`s character and such.<br>They said Tsubasa`s not too girly for a high-school girl because her SAKIMORI personality is more dominant.<br>Nana said Tsubasa cherishes Hibiki and Chris, and she's like "Go forth, my juniors", and she also said that Tsubasa and Maria`s relationship is getting quite closer. Iguchi agrees, then Nana says that Tsubasa manliness is increasing, Iguchi says "But when with Maria-san, Tsubasa-san is girly." Nana agrees, then says "but when Aocchan sees that, she gets happy", and she's like "Nice!". Iguchi says "Tsubasa-san is cute" while they're laughing.<br>Then they proceed to talk about Tsubasa as a top artist. They talked about how the concert was amazing, with all that water and figure skating, and then Iguchi said Ogawa might've taught Tsubasa how to do walking on the water.<br>Then Iguchi proceeds to ask if Nana had a moment where she thought Tsubasa was like her/there was a moment that she thought she is like Tsubasa. Nana responds and says "Manly?"(I don't really get what she is saying here), Iguchi says that when it comes to Symphogear it is really Nana-san that carries the show. Nana says "No, no, that's not true" Iguchi says no, Hibiki's power and Tsubasa-san's supporting and carrying everyone. Nana says "That's not true, Everyone's giving their best", Iguchi says Tsubasa is like an older sister, and Nana agrees, Tsubasa is like an older sister that protects everyone or something.<br>They also talked about the Symphogear live. Iguchi said how everyone was amazed by Nana`s singing, and Nana goes humble again, saying "That's not true! Everyone's giving their best" and Symphogear`s team work is really amazing and strong. <br>continued in next post</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>As someone who hates Commie and will wait for other options I would still choose them over the CR rip. The translations are trash and the typesetting is vastly inferior.</br>  <br>Gee, it's almost like all those characters have developed during or one season after they got introduced while Hibiki is still the same idiot except with added bruce lee.<br><br>One wonders how Genjuro didn't dealt with her Shirou complex considering how worried he was over Chris' edge all the time over.</br></br></br>  <br> and that it's okay to fist when necessary <br><br>Then why the fuck did she had to go through the same fucking dilemma just now?<br><br>God damn it, man.

I would personally choose Mirai.</br>  <br> Would you Asa-nee? </br>  <br>Certainly but the sound director rumor was just rumor. That's just how that faggot operates: pick certain newbie seiyuus for 1-2 year then move on to another newbie seiyuu when their pay inevitably has to be increased.</br>  My seiyuufu is vastly superior compared to Amamiya Sora,  <br> I would totally Asa-nee, and you anon? </br>  <br>You can't know that it's only a rumor. The seiyuu industry is not a sacrosanct workplace, people are coerced into sleeping with people in power there too I'm sure, or choose to do so to advance in their field. This is the entertainment industry after all.</br>  <br> Mirai <br>why<br><br><br>she'd be down for quite a bit of stuff</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't know that it's only a rumor <br>You also can't know that's it's not only a rumor.</br></br>  <br>No I can't, which is why I'm neither categorically denying nor claiming it. You do that, though.</br>  <br> neither categorically denying nor claiming it <br><br> implying she isn't getting fucked by someone <br><br>inb4 <br> that's not me <br><br>If that wasn't you please stop replying to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The thing is there's just not enough evidence to support these claims. Aside from a few; Hirano Aya, Yukana, Toyosaki Aki; not many people do it or the industry is really that tight-lipped so everybody's secrets are safe.</br>  <br>If she's a pillow seiyuu she would've averaged more roles per season, anon. Why would she do something like that just to get 2 roles per season? <br><br>Don't try to say she's shit at voice acting because she's certainly great at it.</br></br></br>  Do you guys even know this qt? <br> I want her to get more roles ;_; </br>  <br>Looks old though.</br>  <br>meme seiyuu</br>  <br>I want to  seed  her</br>  Do you guys even know this qt?<br><br><br>That's not HanaKana or Amamiya Sora.</br></br></br>  <br>I politely decline your request.<br><br><br><br>I'm not claiming that Aketagawa is going balls deep up her ass between takes. (Funny by the way how everybody suddenly seems to be in the know after that one blog post.) There is zero evidence.

When I remember Sugita or Iguchi talk about best friend this or best friend that, I now understand how much of a big thing having a best friend is, especially for a Japanese adult.</br>  No one talks about girls like Megumi Nakajima... really... why?

Except maybe the one voicing Kirito, him I want to dunk upside down in a barrel of  cum .</br></br>   mfw that faggot Matsuoka is gonna be the MC in the new Super Robot Wars game   <br>Really? That is sorta neat.<br>Who will be voicing the chick?</br></br>  <br>Mai Nakahara</br>  <br> including roles of anime that are ongoing <br><br>It's an arbitrary rule of mine that I wait until the anime is finished so that there are more pictures available for me to choose from and also to fully understand its impact/popularity. When a season's only 3 eps in you can't really tell if the anime (and consequently the character) is going to end up memorable or not. Though in the end it's all personal taste which characters end up in a mosaic.</br></br></br>  <br>There is something severely wrong with her facial structure.</br>  <br> that weak as shit FALBLAZE <br>It's gonna be amazingly terrible.<br>benched</br></br></br>  <br> Umehara on covers after just a couple of months working <br>Based</br></br>  <br>Miyuki Sawashiro and Haruka Tomatsu are Goddesses. They are the only reason I live</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> . She looks really cute too. <br>Anon before discovering makeup.</br></br>  <br>Glad Ari-chan is there. She's cute</br>  <br>I agree that lately they care more about looks and marketability as a personality/idol though I'm not really complaining. Personally I think seiyuu like Asami Seto, Ai Kakuma, Tomoyo Kurosawa, Ari Ozawa are all newer seiyuu with varying degrees of good range.<br><br>Seiyuu like Ayane Sakura, Maaya Uchida didn't impress me at the beginning of their career but the latter has been growing on me (she's good in Chaos Dragon, Charlotte what I've seen) and Ayane's been slightly improving over the years. HanaKana used to be bad in the beginning but she's great now (that doesn't mean I tolerate her overexposure).</br></br></br>  Is there a specific seiyuu you've been recognizing more and .more recently? For me its Hiroshi kamiya  <br>I remember the first Nico broadcast event they did for Seiken Tsukai, in which Kaito was the MC. The guest were Aoi, Taketatsu, Ogura and Uchida.<br>There was a lot of awkwardness in the air during that event. Not because there was any animosity between the cast but more due to a lack of chemistry between them, with Ogura being Ogura and Maaya Uchida having the personality of a brick.(Of course some Maaya fanboys in 2ch deconstructed this into people bullying Uchida and yada yada)<br><br>Still, despite the "bad" atmosphere Kaito really did his best at improving the mood, it left a good impression of him on a lot of of the spectators.<br>Him and Aoi pretty much carried that whole train-wreck.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Ogura a bitch or something?</br>  <br>No, but she is overly fake and burikko.<br>Not a bad girl per se, but she is a huge tool of the industry.</br></br>  <br> people bullying Uchida <br>Please explain.<br><br><br>Yes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody bullied Uchida, she was putting zero effort in interacting with Aoi/Taketatsu/Ogura and therefore was left behind in conversations.<br>Then a few hours later you had dumb fanboys saying they bullied her.</br></br>  <br><br>It's been built with the latest medical technology, but something went horribly wrong.</br></br>  <br><br>Wow. I expected her to be a nice girl, but I guess you can't really judge by just looks.</br></br>  <br>Is there a prove she's burikko or fake? I don't think she's that bad.</br>  <br>Shit, mean to quote  </br>  <br><br><br>I want to marry Harami and remove her cake status!</br></br></br>  <br>She did  by makes my dick goes diamond </br>  <br>Really Anon? She puts up a fake cutesy voice everytime she speaks normally. Compare her tone of voice in an interview to pretty any other modern female seiyuu.<br>All Idol seiyuu lie about a few things but Ogura's stage personality comes of as terribly forced and fake.<br><br>Again, Ogura is not a bad per se, she is just a huge tool.<br>Last I checked she was just 19 so maybe she will find a way to be more true to herself in the future.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Is she Yukarin level burikko or she's more terrible than Yukarin?</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, petit milady and Kaito saved that show, but Ogura in that Niconama seems fine to me and Uchida is like always, not good at communicating</br>  <br>I always enjoy Aoi acting like a creeper around Ogura.</br>  <br>I know her cutesy voice is seems fake. but It doens't mean she's a bitch like this anon said . <br>or maybe her real voice isn't really far from her cutesy voice. Naganawa Maria have a bit similiar cutesy voice like Ogura. And to me, Maria's voice doesn't seem fake.</br></br>  <br>And Aoi not holding back againts tkt2. Oppai beeaaam.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_K0<wbr>oNlZDsYs</wbr>  [ ]<br>I love how Aoi makes her stand up first.</br></br>  <br>From what?</br>  I love Saorin  <br>It seemed like Uchida was preoccupied with something in her mind but couldn't do anything about it since she had an event to attend. You know, real life shit.  She could've also been on her period. </br>  <br>Dokkyun dokkyun.</br>  <br>It probably bothers her that she's the only slut there or something.</br>  <br>Idols don't have periods, silly.<br>Now that you mention it, she was a bit better/less awkward on the Seiken Tsukai radio CD.(With Aoi, Taketatsu and Chiaki Omigawa.)</br></br>  <br>Are you saying the jam isn't authentic?</br>  I wish we could get more of these two.  Why do producers hire expensive seiyuu when seiyuu are dime a dozen, and they can cut costs immensely by hiring newbies?<br><br>Newbies would work for basically nothing just for a chance to get exposure. Another benefit is that you don't get Kirito-voiced or Araragi-voiced MCs every single season.</br></br>  <br>Except that's a different persona with a different seiyuu so you can't really represent her as Uchida maaya at that point.</br>  <br>What? The seiyuu is still same.</br>  <br>Rieshon is really good at that. If you told me Nyaa-tan, Hotaru from NNB, and Nao from Wakaba Girl were voiced by different people, I'd believe you.</br>  <br>What the fuck. You're absolutely right.<br><br>I-I mean I was just pretending to be retarded. Jokes on you.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously?<br>Despite QUALITY all over the place in anime, industry standard is still a thing</br></br>  <br>You are generalizing, plenty of no Anime with a tight budget do just what you said.(It's also the reason why you see new faces so often instead of veteran seiyuu which are more expensive. A good example is Yuri Kuma Arashi, the main trio were no-names, and the big name seiyuu like Aoi or Koshimizu only voiced secondary girls that had way less screentime.)</br>  <br>Who is this spackle castle?</br>  <br><br>I could have sworn they had different seiyuus for the split personalities, I thought I even saw it in the casting on  MAL </br></br>  <br><br>Don't forget voicing Shiho and Isla, that makes her absolute shit tier by default (more so at the former)</br></br>  <br>Rainy Sky.</br>  <br>Who is this hardening agent?<br><br><br>Who is this nut-butter erupter?<br><br><br>Thanks. I just woke up and they're coming to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most newbies are not that good.<br>Believe it or not in this industry the majority of popular seiyuu deserve they popularity.</br></br>  <br>Even Hanazawa, Anon?</br>  <br>Or Minami Tsuda?</br>  <br>She's a great seiyuu. Only a bit below Hayami/Sawashiro (the bestests young seiyuu).</br>  <br> Sawashiro <br>Pure talent, not so much skill. Just has a voice like sex.</br></br>  <br>Hanazawa has good range, she can show the personality and share emotion through her voice.<br>She is a bit overrated, but almost anyone would be with the amount shows she is in per season.<br><br><br>She isn't popular, she just got lucky last year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean why don't they do that faster than the rate they usually do? Because that's exactly what they do, almost every 3-4 years we're seeing another group of late teens/early 20 year olds debuting while those that have reached cake status get cast less and less</br>  <br>No. Uchida voiced both of them. You could clearly hear Uchida's voice in Onee-san voice. She use her cool deep voice.<br>and why the hell they used different seiyuu when the character is sharing same body.</br></br>  <br> No. Uchida voiced both of them. You could clearly hear Uchida's voice in Onee-san voice. She use her cool deep voice. <br>I've never heard her use that voice, ever. Could you give me some other roles when she has?</br></br>  <br>Great range while still being recognizable.<br>She's like female Ishida.</br></br>  <br> Hanazawa has good range, she can show the personality and share emotion through her voice. </br>  most underrated with great range  <br>yet what a terrible nose</br>  <br> half-breeds </br>  <br> She isn't popular, she just got lucky last year. <br>Got lucky? How?<br>Isn't there a list of the top earning seiyuu with her ranking high up there.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant to reply <br><br>Hanazawa is great, I rated her higher after her performance in Garden of Words.<br>She's brilliant there.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The most recent one she used her cool voice is Dora-tan in Etotama.</br>  <br>Any others?</br>  <br>Her Nibutani was great, and she's still my Kyoanifu until now.</br>  <br>Who is this load toad?<br><br><br>Who is this priapism mechanism?<br><br><br>Who is this gestation plantation?<br><br><br>Who is this friction addiction?<br><br><br>Who is this fornication station?<br><br><br> great range <br>Not really, no</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How many roles has she this year?<br>Like two to four at most.<br>She can't be earning so much.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm going to filter you because you're trying too hard with those names.</br>  <br>Sawashiro can easily pull do children to adult male greatly, and you can still recognize her voice.</br>  <br>;_;</br>  <br>The emotion she showed in the movie is great, but range? it is not at all</br>  <br>I don't remember any other character when she used cool voice. May be NotHomu from Vividred, but I think it's not deep like dora-tan or that split personality. You can just check  MAL  anon.</br>  <br>Wait, she was not-homu from vividass? whut.</br>  <br>Also filtered because <br> Sawashiro doesn't have skill </br></br>  Cmon guys, if Hanazawa had a "great range" her overexposure a few years ago wouldn't have been an issue. But she couldn't cover all those roles so it ends up sounding like she gets mis-casted and the role could have gone to a better suited seiyuu. You don't see people complaining about Aoi Yuuki or Sawashiro being everywhere.<br>She has her forte, which is soft-spoken character then she can vary it a bit (smug/insane in particular she is pretty good at). Great range is a stretch.</br>  <br>There are many unnoticeable ones with good range</br>  <br><br>Range is overrated anyway.</br></br>  <br>She doesn't only do anime role. I think she did the dub for GoT as well. No idea how legit this list is.</br>  <br>Yes. Honestly, Uchida is pretty good at voice acting or maybe talented, but some anon here just called she's slut just because she's do gravure before become a popular seiyuu like now.</br>  <br>Not like some other leading seyuu. Like I said, she has a voice like sex, and she delivers her lines well, but she doesn't have the range.</br>  <br>She's a very talented semen demon.</br>  <br> she has a voice like sex <br>She sounds like a grandmum to me.</br></br>  Who should be the next guest on Tokyo Encounter?<br><br>Also, where are the fucking subs? This isn't the Red October, fuck.</br></br>  <br>Which was a big mistake.<br>She's a weird(?) type who looks good only with clothes on.</br></br>  <br>She's even doing more gravure after she got popular as seiyuu.<br>Funny how Mao started to dress like a granny after she was gaining more roles as seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>I remember someone mentioned that Aoi's manager was pushing her to become idol type seiyuu. What happened to it?</br>  <br>You are gonna need to be more specific than that.</br>  <br>Problem is her legs is short, makes her bikini photos looks weird from waist below.<br>Unlike Tomatsu, who has a great pair of legs even though her ass and chest are almost non-existent.</br></br>  <br>This season in Chaos Dragon, she voices Urobuchi's character.<br><br><br>Nana Mizuki can single-handedly carry an anime thanks to her large fanbase. Having veteran seiyuu also pays off when it comes to events.<br><br><br>The way seiyuu industry is becoming more looks-oriented I wouldn't be surprised if doing gravure becomes more regular, see Haruka Tomatsu. Releasing a photobook is a good way to gain some money.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;This season in Chaos Dragon, she voices Urobuchi's character. <br>I would watch it for her but I CD seems pretty dull.<br>I only watched 1 ep though.</br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I haven't heard anything about her activity as an idol nowadays. She seems to degrade as fujoshit and otaku as one of Sugita's friends (which is great) instead of releasing singles/albums like Hanazawa did before</br>  <br>Hiyori was voiced by Uchida? What the fuck?</br>  You will never have a threesome with these two. Ever.  <br>No idea where can she be earning so much.<br>All that money doesn't come from her seiyuu job, that's sure.<br>I don't know how good of a singer she is, so maybe there it is.</br></br></br>  <br>Do you always skip anime ED?</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god, I could have fucking sworn that she wasn't. I think someone must have tampered with my memories because it seems so obvious now but I was completely oblivious.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't that ED done by supercell from what I recall?</br>  <br>Kind of. It's another singer backed by supercell's ryo.</br>  <br>It's a shame she doesn't get more roles, Alice is the only recent one I can recall.</br>  <br>Hotaru's voice is really soothing.</br>  <br>I know, I'm always looking out for her but she ain't getting hardly shit. <br><br>Another favorite of mine. All her roles have been perfect.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, Tia as vocalis. I think he mean a credit roll in ED</br>  <br>Oonishi Saori, Ozawa Ari, Kakuma Ai. They're seiyuu that I like. And I think they have good range.</br>  <br>Female version of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu</br>  <br><br>All of NNB is soothing. It's pure undiluted smooth all the way down to the last 5%, and then it's the dark underside with all the  rape .</br></br>  Just found it on Downtown DX that Kaneda Tomoko ate 42 giant pieces of tonkatsu to celebrate her 42th birthday.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=hU-<wbr>kMqV5Pco</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>And I thought Kobayashi Yuu is crazy.</br></br></br></br>  Thread needs more bullying.  <br>all female seiyuus in their 20s are idol seiyuu.</br>  <br>Veterans seiyuu are like investments. They might cost a lot but they can also bring you back a lot of money.<br>Like  said, Mizuki Nana costs quite a lot because she's literally at the top of the industry, but you can be 200% sure she'll sell like candies in a preschool because she's popular as fuck no matter how shitty the show she is in, and her CDs will sell without no doubt because her songs are good even if the show is dogshit.</br></br>  <br>Assuming they're even decently attractive.</br>  Idol ≠ Artist/Singer<br>Why does everyone call anyone who sing/dances an "idol"?</br>  <br><br>They really need to stop being so blatant about that. I feel like she could actually come into her own eventually and build her way up to leading roles with experience and time but the way they're pushing her as their leading heroine so fucking hard and in their bad anime isn't helping her at all. Especially because this way if they dump her she's probably going to be fucked.</br></br>  <br> Plastic Memories was a flop <br> Classcroom Crisis is set to be a flop <br><br>How much longer does she have?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cross Ange  immediately come to mind. I wonder how many people bought the BD just for Nana.</br>  <br>Oi, Cross Ange was a good show.</br>  <br>why do 2dpdfags care who 3dpds fuck?</br>  <br>I don't think many of them bought the BDs. Most of them blasted their cash on Kindan no Resistance and Eden.<br>I'm sure the Nanafags bought the BDs that includes episode 20-23 though. That fucking scene where Nana made lewd sounds was so arousing.</br></br>  <br>Has anyone here played Short Peace: Rango Tsukigime's Longest Day?<br><br>Uchida voices every single female character in that game, and then sings the ED. It's fucking brilliant.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't buy anything Cross Ange related, but Nana, Yukarin and Yui Horie made me watch the show.</br>  <br>1st cour was fucking gold.<br>2nd cour is shit. I only watched through the 2nd cour mostly because of Nana. You don't really get to hear Nana saying rude words that often.</br></br>  <br>I remember the time where I picked up Cross Ange because  Nana was the MC .<br>I never regretted making that choice. Those were some of the most entertaining weeks I had in my life.</br></br>  <br>Her v oice is so annoying. Does she always speak like that even in RL?</br>  <br>Yeah, it was the first time to see three of them in the same anime if I'm not mistaken. <br>That alone should generate a lot of buzz.</br></br>  <br> double blowjob  <br>With THEIR technique? Damn.</br></br>  <br>Apparently it's her natural voice, so yes.</br>  42 pieces of Tonkatsu is just crazy  <br>Why is she so autistic?</br>  <br>I always wonder why they don't make shows starring those three.<br>They're literally the Holy Trinity of the seiyuu industry, even if they cost a fortune to hire they should bring back 999x of the money lost to hire them.</br></br>  <br>I don't think CA was a huge hit. But having Nana in cast seems guarantee at least 5,000 BD/DVD.</br>  <br>Cross Ange was only a huge hit with feminists who are buttblasted because of the first episode.<br>It only sold 5K because of the top-tier VA cast, and of course Nana.</br></br>  <br>The animation would suffer a heavy backslash with all the money they cost.<br><br><br>BDs aren't accurate to judge a show success.<br>For example see Symohogear or Prisma this season, they are both in their third season but never had stellar BD sales.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> buttblasted <br>Heh.</br></br>  <br>It was really fun to see those three in one anime.<br>And two of them are in Nana`s character`s harem too, which made it more fun.</br></br>   Nana this, Nana that <br> Nana wills it.jpg </br>  <br>You called?</br>  <br>only japan cares, the west gives no shit as long as they keep voicing 2d qts</br>  <br>Just say you want more Nana, anon.</br>  <br><br>No.  Lets not derail this thread with too much Nana. </br></br>  <br><br>I want to impregnate nana.</br></br>   va threads used to only have pictures of characters <br> then they started having 3dpd next to the characters <br> now it's just 3dpd <br>when did /a/ become such cancer?</br></br></br>  <br>Nana a qt.<br><br> implying its not Nana that will impregnate you </br></br></br>  <br> /a/ gets to have seiyuu threads <br> /tv/ doesn't get to have actress threads </br></br>  <br>Now that the Nanafags are aware she's the current topic here, its destined to be bombed by Nana now.<br>Don't worry, they'll go away sooner or later like nothing happened, as that always happens.</br></br>  <br>I want Nana to marry someone already.<br>She has to pass her glorious genes.</br></br>  <br>speaking of /tv/ mark hamill has said that he doesn't want people thinking of old luke skywalker when they hear the joker. in the same way I don't want to see ugly japs when I watch my cute anime girls.</br>  <br>It can't be helped.</br>  <br>Yukarin should do the honors, it'll help with her depression.</br>  Nao Touyama is the best. I feel bad she had to voice that shitty idol in TWGOK  <br>Girls can't impregnate girls.</br>  <br>Should Mark Hamill impregnate Nana-sama?</br>  Who Kaori here?  <br>Please keep gaijins away from Nana.</br>  <br>I'll be glad to contribute then.</br>  I will impregnate Yukarin as well!  <br>The shitty idol was the foundation of her career, you fag.</br>  <br>She is one of the most successful seiyuu of all time, if not the most successful one.<br>How does she derail the thread, but Kana Hanazawa doesn't?</br></br>  <br>This Kaori (Fukuhara)<br><br>(Please hire her more)</br></br></br>  <br>You mean both of these britbong right?<br>TWGOK is a literally noname anime.</br></br>  <br>You don't underestimate Nanafags. They can be the most autistic, loyal fags you can ever see.<br>Also,  Nana wills it. </br></br>    <br>Why is she so kind?</br>  <br> pure4 <br>heh</br></br>  <br>So how does such a pure looking girl turn into such a huge slut?<br>Is this the dark side of the industry corrupting all the girls?</br></br>  Who is the most pure seiyuu now?<br><br>I dont wanna sluts here</br></br>  <br>That's depressing as fuck.<br>I will go hear to New Sensation trying to forget I read that.</br></br>  <br>The Industry has always been dark. Only strong individuals stay pure and emit radiance despite the wrongdoings of the Industry.</br>  <br>No seiyuu over age 20 is pure, fags. If they aren't married or have boyfriends they've done pillow business or just decided to take the sound director or whoever on a whim because they were feeling horny. Deal with it.</br>  <br>Amamiya Sora</br>  <br>Yukarin, but she is kind of depressed because of that.<br>Aoi maybe, she seems a big otaku after all.</br></br>  <br>Neither are those under 20 because of teenagers' sexual drive.</br>  <br>Nana`s heart is the purest.</br>  <br> Yukarin <br>Her suicide tendency is still there?<br> Aoi <br> Maybe Sugita already took hers. </br></br></br></br>  <br>At this point I won't be surprised if Nana actually dies in the middle of her concert because she tries so fucking hard to make her fans happy in her concerts.<br><br> Sugita <br> taking anyone`s virginity <br>He can't even tap Nana.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> suicide tendency <br><br>Has she reached JUST level yet?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nana is the best<br><br>Aoi too</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope she never does.</br>  <br> Her suicide tendency is still there? <br>Last thing about her was about her was a Twitter at the end of June.<br>Apparently, she was neurotic because she had a free day and didn't now what to do with it.</br></br></br>  <br> huge ear lobes <br> huge lip <br> chin too round <br>3/10 maybe if i was drunk</br></br></br></br>    <br> because she tries so fucking hard to make her fans happy in her concerts. <br>Safety first, et voila, she survives, edgemeister.</br></br>  <br>Maybe a life-long gimmick for her radio show. Kinda like Iron Sheik.</br>  <br> Apparently, she was neurotic because she had a free day and didn't now what to do with it. <br>Now I'm scared. What will she do once her career is over? Picking marriage route seems quite hard for her.</br></br>  <br>Someone help this woman already, Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>Nothing. <br>If you remove Yukarin`s job from her, it will only make her suffer more.<br>If you remove Nana`s job from her, you'll be literally stripping off her reason to live.<br>Some of the seiyuus have nothing left but their jobs.</br></br></br></br>  <br> not knowing Asanee </br>  <br>Your goddess has arrived.</br>  <br>stop trying to make me sad you cunt</br>  <br>Only she can help herself.<br>She has a long history of depression, no one is gonna fix it easily.</br></br>  <br> If you remove Nana`s job from her, you'll be literally stripping off her reason to live. <br>Does she really have nothing left in her life?</br></br>  <br><br>She probably has enough money to retire.</br></br>  <br>I doubt Nana retires from singing.<br>She will probably retire from anime and become an enka singer.</br></br>  <br>Or a housewife while occasionally doing anime roles in her spare time like Hayashibara.</br>  <br>We all remember her scandals of course, but does she still have health problems?</br>  <br>She was literally born to sing.<br> her name was based off an actress-singer  <br> trained to sing at the young age of 5  <br> her childhood was literally only about her tours all around Japan to join singing contests <br> even when her father died she still wants to sing and fulfill her family's dreams <br> even when she already fulfilled her family's dreams she still has her own dreams to fulfill that is still related to singing <br> her dream is wanting to sing for everyone in the world <br>If you make her stop from singing she has nothing left to do but die.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Or doing a rakugo comedy with Yui Horie and Yukari</br>  <br>I get a boner just thinking if she might be a screamer.</br>  <br>She never has noticable non-lead roles so far to prove herself, she won't last longer when Sony finds their new darling, and people realized that she is manufactured<br><br><br>She should take it slow after the success of Kaori in One Week Friends but it seems the agency can't wait much longer since she will be unnoticeble in supporting character roles, so they go full force in giving her so many lead roles so they can media play out of her as most sought after seiyuu in a short span time and you see after she starred in A/Z, Akame and Tokyo Ghoul which were most hyped show that season they successfully lauched her career as next big seiyuu, she gains popularity fast, it doesn't matter Sony pushed her or not since people and media already thought she is the trend and especially then Aniplex keep giving her lead roles every season to keep her status as popular VA. It is more annoying now those gives her many pleb fans who think she is in level of HanaKana and sings better than Nana.<br><br>Sony would keep giving her that lead roles until she has enough hits to keep her name out there and gain more fanbase to buy her idol stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Considering she really screams when freaking out when people dig up her past photos of her, its not that hard to guess she is a screamer.</br>  Erection rising.<br><br><br>The absolute best. <br><br><br>See this? Never.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I know this was 6 hours ago but you have a problem if you can't see that Erina is already more popular than most of those characters. Same with Rory Mercury.</br>  <br>Who is this peener steamer?<br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;12855555 <br>Who is this bean machine?</br></br></br></br>  <br> *</br>  <br>Best Joshiraku indeed.</br>  <br> Or a housewife <br>The odds of this are over 72034785029486790237609385674895670<wbr>394 to 1!</wbr></br></br>  How can you like seiyuus,anons?They're 3DPD shits also i like Aya Hirano.  <br>Petit Milady</br>  <br> Implying 2.5D isn't greater than 3D <br> Not all people on this board hate 3D, everyone loves 2D but some like the range of 2-3 </br></br>  <br> falling for bait </br>  <br>Funny thing they even put her together with Hanazawa on radio show.</br>    <br> (even though she isn't even beautiful) <br>But that's wrong.</br></br>  Why is this woman so popular? She isn't that good looking at that conversational voice of hers sounds annoying or fake.  <br> Implying there aren't people right now who unironically hate 3DPD </br>  <br>Erina is her most popular character so far, it's a successful adaptation of a popular Jump manga. Popularity isn't the only thing I consider, I wait til the anime is finished so I have more Erina frames to choose from. You're right that Rory will end up being popular too. I'll add both of them eventually.<br><br><br>Rie is great. I love when she's not being stereotyped as a tsundere. And every time she's in a Matsumoto anime is a treat (Koto, White).</br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't know her fame. <br>You would prob diss the queen of seiyuu too.  Megumi-sama. </br></br>    <br>Man, that runaway JoJo girl looks so out of place.</br>  <br> Yukana <br>Never knew about this. Can someone give me a break down?</br></br>  I want to make love to Mao  <br>Maybe when she got the role as Four in the new Zeta Gundam movies? I remember it was pretty big.</br>  <br>Good taste anon</br>  Weekend Waifu and Husbando Drawthread #3<br><br>Remember to relax and take it easy.<br><br>Previous thread </br></br></br></br>  <br>Requesting Kukaku Shiba dressed as Frank Sinatra singing into an old 50's microphone.<br>Or anything is fine.<br>Thanks and have a nice weekend!</br></br></br>  Requesting Ran doing the Rancho Relaxo taunt from Team Fortress 2, and instead of a chair, Ran uses her tails as the chair.<br><br>bigger Ran Ref <br>Rancho ref: http://i.imgur.com/q6FRfum.png<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8HJ<wbr>nW0GLDVE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Requesting my wonderful waifu, Mimi.<br><br>Possibly relaxing with a cold drink on a chaise lounge or similar furniture, but anything cute would be greatly appreciated.<br><br>She'll share her vodka with you if you draw her!<br><br>As always, take it easy, and I hope everyone has an amazing weekend.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Kindly requesting Claudia Madobe getting dressed in the morning.

Ilya is not a slut.</br>  <br>They made the other 3 Frees.

Buy there only as a last resort, unless you have a discount or something.</br>    <br> retards are going to believe the fear mongering and miss delicious figures </br>  i hope wonfes will be ok  Generally, how long does it take between pre-orders opening on AmiAmi, the product being shipped, and arriving?  <br>I'm willing to pay a bit extra for the convenience, what kind of inflation are we talking about here?<br><br>Patience is one of those things you kind of have to develop in this lifestyle, so the extra shipping time isn't really an issue at all.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Try looking at the release date and doing some basic math.</br></br>  <br>I find it's pretty fun to be expecting a package for a while. It's nerve wracking but fun to find something waiting for you, especially when it takes a while. <br><br>i do like using services that are lightning fast though, like prime. That shit is magical.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok</br>  <br><br>I don't collect loli, but if I did I wouldn't judge it to be worth the risk I think.

Is it the same artist that did that Touhou Castlevania?

Surely these don't cost less than $100?  <br>Some do, others don't.<br>Often depends on type Scale vs Prize, manufacturer, source, exclusivity, and complexity.</br></br>  <br><br>It depends on the manufacturer, but the usual price of top-notch ones (not ultra limited editions) is 100-150$. Even then there's some manufacturers who are also good (not the best) and charge around 60-70$.</br></br>  <br>Depends of the figure.</br>  <br>It's a good time to like figures but like <br><br>said there's modifying stats to figures<br><br>still the over all baseline is improving at a breakneck pace, the really good figures from 5 years ago are on a level of pretty basic and sometimes bad compared to today's medium stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Figures can vary in price greatly. I would like to say that higher price = higher quality but that might not always be the case. It is mainly dependent on the manufacturer. I would say most of the figures you see on here range from $50-120</br>  <br>OPs pic is around 100,  is around 200,  will probably be around 20.</br>  <br>I certainly won't let that mutt around her. My only concern, is that I've seen this fucking dogs fur actually inbed itself in fabrics. My room has fur everywhere, despite me keeping away from the dog and keeping the dog out of my room.</br>  <br>And some are pretty logic-defying</br>  <br><br>I have 3 sheepdogs. Can confirm lint rollers are a necessity</br></br>  <br><br> Surely these don't cost less than $100? <br>Some surely don't.<br><br>I just... hope this one has the impressive quality you speak of.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's been out for a few months now, is she worth the price tag?<br>I think she's like $50 cheaper on Rightstuf than she was when she was up for pre-order.<br><br>Still wouldn't buy her, waiting for GSC Homu.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's a FREEing 1/4. Literally the best 1/40s in the market. You only need to be wary of their 1/8, for some reason they don't put the same amount of effort on those.</br></br>  Will we see more boatgirls or swordboys this Sunday?  <br>Have you every noticed your dog's fur tangle itself into fabrics? The daki I bought was Ion from Ciel/Ar nosurge, fairly hard to find the offical one so it came with a large pricetag.</br>  <br>I'd say wait for it to go down more. She has a big box, expensive, and was very likely over ordered from hype so several cancellations. At some point, Rightstuf will discount her even more to move stock. She has quite a few QC issues from what I read too.</br>  <br><br>Oh well that's great news. I've never bought FREEing before.</br></br>  <br>Yes and yes</br>  <br>Yeah it happens all the time. Make sure your bedsheets are clean. I noticed it gets woven in the fabric when it rubs up against other hair infested fabrics. Try to keep your door closed whenever you can.</br>  I really hope you non-Saber Fatefags see some good stuff.  Monochrome action figure when?  What Pochacos are you looking forward to at WonFes?  <br>skin tight bodysuit</br>  <br>Non-bikini/lingerie.</br>  <br>Thanks for the advice, my bed does seem to have less dog hair on it than everywhere else. I'll make sure to wash my sheets regularly and vaccum more often.</br>  I am rioting already.  <br>She's $5 cheaper than when she was up for pre-order. There was a $50 shipping surcharge during the pre-order period because her box is so big.

Next week?</br></br>  <br><br>Reddit.</br></br>  <br>Thanks.

Bananas are disgusting. Among the worst of fruits if not the very worst. Not even tolerable in smoothies.</br></br>  <br>Cutest upotte.</br>  <br>There was a time on 4chan when a post like this would have earned someone a 90 day ban and we would have all applauded it.</br>  <br> Not even tolerable in smoothies <br><br>I'll fite you.</br></br></br>  <br>Just how much of a tasteless faggot can you be?</br>  <br>Just because you saw these moments a lot on knowyourmeme or encyclopedia dramatica doesn't mean it was actually that frequent an occurance</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Based Shigu-chan</br>  Thanks, GSC. Maybe next time don't use a flimsy cardboard rectangle for a rolled poster.  <br>You saying you don't like bananas? The fuck is wrong with you man</br>  <br>They're the only reason I bought the other three. Fuckers better deliver and not skip to fucking Souske.</br>  <br>That is exactly what I'm saying. They smell disgusting, they taste even worse, and they are texturally abhorrent. How anyone can like them is beyond me.</br>  <br><br>If you contacted them about that I think you'd be compensated.</br></br>  <br>I like bananas but I always find it difficult to finish one.<br>I don't like mangoes, cherries, or honeydew.</br></br>  <br><br>How does that even break? <br><br>No, seriously, even if the packaging was shit,. how the hell does it break like that? Specially if the figure and package box are (by the look of it) perfectly fine.</br></br></br></br>  <br>but that's your fault<br><br>i just tuned in to the thread and didnt even read your lifestory or whatever, i just thought you wanted to kill yourself for owning that much guns</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe you just have had a problem since you were a kid or something<br>Bananas are delicious man</br></br>  <br><br>He ripped it himself.</br></br>  <br>They'll most likely send you another.<br><br>Hell I got a second Ciel torso for a paint speck on her leg<br><br> mfw it was valued at 900jpy on the declaration </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i just thought you wanted to kill yourself for owning that much guns <br>Why would you think that? A person only needs one gun and one bullet to an hero. Having dozens of guns and thousands of rounds of ammo implies that a person wants to live to see another day.</br></br>  <br>How? Customs? Who sliced/opened it, because I'd say it's on manhandling, not shitty packaging. How should GSC anticipate that.</br>  <br>I can agree, but its the texture that gets me.</br>  <br>i thought you wanted to kill yourself so many times</br>  <br>Just ask the judge why don't people who play violent games get arrested for being potential killers and bam, case dismissed. Just kidding, the judge will talk about religion and such and still send you away by his personal opinion and beliefs.</br>  To anyone interested in the history of bananas, I would recommend Dan Koeppel's "Banana: The Fate of the Fruit That Changed the World". I wouldn't call it "fascinating" or anything, but if for whatever reason you are truly a banana-lover it does contain a lot of interesting information about the history of the fruit you may not be aware of.  <br>Outrageous. Bananas are a staple of the American diet, like hamburgers. Not liking them makes you not an American<br><br>inb4<br> aussie <br>I almost expect it by now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, it's not like you lost anything of value. But it's still shitty. Sorry, anon.</br>  <br>I'll be e-mailing them about it after I get Ren set up and make sure there's no issues with him.

He also said he was reaching the end of the novel, so I doubt there's enough material there for a season 3, movie/OVA perhaps?  <br>Movie would seem like the best option, an hour and change would be roughly the same air time as 3 TV episodes, bump it up to 90 minutes and that's close to four. Plenty of time to cover volume 12 without rushing, and we get it all at once instead of having to wait god know's how long between OVA episodes.</br>  inb4 mods  shaa~  If volume 12 is the last then a OVA.If more volumes come after that a movie  Happy Birthday Kurisu!

Be specific.</br></br>  I wouldn't.<br>I don't try to fix my own turds either.<br>I just press the Flush button.</br></br>  <br>Read the fucking VN, you filthy secondary</br>  <br>I did you cuck.</br>  <br>It became too popular for /a/.</br>  UBW is not a remake. <br><br> Tell me exactly how you would change it <br>I don't know. I  haven't read it yet  so art, I think.</br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing I could change without changing the entire UBW route. It was a good adaptation of a shit series, so it was shit.<br><br> "R-Read the VN!" <br> "It gets better I swear!" <br>Fuck off. I'm not going to bother wasting my time reading through some retard like Shirou's life and ideals.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> paying attention to the threadcrappers <br> unironically <br>What horrible way to start a thread. And this should ne the umpteenth time someone does this one.</br></br></br>  Why does Fate need 10 threads at all times?  <br>your threads ruined it for me before i could into it</br>  <br><br><br><br>this is why fate threads are shit, you can't even defend why you hate something<br><br>absolutely most autistic fanbase on /a/, the vn alone takes as long as watching 6 different anime</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>50 minute episodes, all monologues are included, absolutely no change from what happened in the VN, Miura gets burned alive and we get the film as a BD extra..</br>  TOHSAKA RIN PLEASES OLD MEN FOR MONEY  Fate is shit. The VN is shit, the anime are all shit, and especially the fanbase is shit. Literally worse than Naruto and SAO.  <br><br>I'd adapt Heaven's Feel instead.<br><br>Best thing about Ufotable's UBW adaptation was it reminded UBWfags that the route isn't as good as they thought it was. and many who have gone back to re-read the VN have been reborn as Heaven's Feel fags.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Fate was always popular. It's the most entry level VN in the medium, which is why the fanbase is so terrible.</br></br>  <br>It's probably the best continuation for Fate Zero, considering it follows up on Kiritsugu's and Shirou's ideals and how they clash. But yeah, the story meanders for a good while and doesn't have a lot of interesting action. Rider gets killed off-screen, Lancer does fuck all for a good part of the story. <br>It's got a good start and a strong conclusion, though.</br></br>  <br> It's probably the best continuation for Fate Zero, considering it follows up on Kiritsugu's and Shirou's ideals and how they clash. <br>What? UBW? UBW is easily the worst successor to Fate/Zero, considering how all the plot threads left behind from Fate/Zero are abandoned.</br></br>  <br> It's probably the best continuation for Fate Zero <br>No, no. You are thinking about HF. It's the one that gives best closure to everything set up by Zero.</br></br>  <br>Nobody in its sane mind should give a fuck about Zero, though.</br>  <br>Why should people not care about the best TypeMoon property after Carnival Phantasm.<br><br> inb4 secondary <br>I bet I read the F/SN VN before you did, you little shitter.</br></br></br></br>  they should have adapted fate first, fate stay night needs all routes to work.  <br>put a fucking kiss in the epilogue holy shit</br>  <br>There's already a Fate route anime, anon.</br>  <br>Change Rhino's profile.</br>  <br>Characters are no longer pure if they kiss.</br>  <br>do you recommend people watch Deen before ubw?</br>  <br>no longer pure shit, anyway</br>  <br>What the fuck was the deal with Tohsaka Rhino anyway?</br>  <br>The source material is trash to begin with.</br>  Fate is garbage  <br>Because Zero it's a fucking prequel, it matters shit which route it's a better follow-up, because FSN is its own thing. Zero is nothing more than fanservice for the VNreaders.</br>  Would not have adapted it into an anime.  <br>what makes it garbage</br>  <br>I'd fix Rin's facial proportions. The spacing between the eye and eyebrow bothered me almost every time she smiled.</br>  <br>starting directly from the exact beginning of the production process, my first change would be to not waste my studio's money on licensing to adapt a bullshit halfassed porn vn.</br>  Really bad character renders. Everyone's face is so fucked up to the point of being distracting.  <br>Except for Archer. Can't bone his sword.</br>    <br> get in the fucking holy grail war, shinji </br>   have better alternative <br> don't use it </br>  <br>He did it in more ways than one, you know.</br>  Change the artstyle.<br>Make Shirou a LOT less obnoxious.<br>Then again the route was terrible so you can only polish a turd so much.</br></br>  Sort the music out. It's very forgettable. Would have taken Kajiura over the UBW composer.  <br>I would animate a superior VN like Muramasa or Baldr Sky</br>  <br>Choose F/HA instead. Though it would probably fail since there's more stuff to work with.<br>Anyway, I hope they'll add a batcave in the upcoming HF movie, it's better that way.</br></br>  <br>It is in a way a remake of the movie.</br>  <br>It would be forgettable again, Fate/Zero sounds like the leftovers of other of her works</br>  Is anime that expensive to make? It's like they dump all the money at the beginning and then make the rest from leftovers.  <br>Imagining all the Zero-only watchers suddenly getting thrown into H/A's slice of life antics with characters they don't know and Saber being cute is certainly amusing.</br>  <br>I'd love to see deredere Rin scene animated, but damn.</br>  <br>because the VN was shit meaning the remake was even more shit.</br>  <br>Does anyone have that comparison image of Saber swimming and her in fate/ZERO? She is saying something about how she cannot be stopped by water.</br>    Bryce Papenbrook as Shirou  <br> secondary <br>Kek please tell me how many of the anime you watch are based of light novels/visual novels/manga's then tell me how many of those you actually read to completion.<br>I'll wait.</br></br></br>  What servant aside from Saber would you like to see in Alter form?  <br>Have it make sense and be interesting.</br>  Fate is garbage  <br> UBW remake was shit <br><br>Nice meme, it actually improved on the VN.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't have a problem with it. It was a good adaptation though all the Zero pandering with Gilgamesh was annoying. I still hate Rin, the VN made me hate her even more. Please do not fuck up the exorcism, Nine lives and the final fight.</br>  They missed a lot of key scenes. Here's a list, I'm sure I'm forgetting a lot.<br><br>1.- Shirou's parallel to Rin's face when Archer betrayed her and how she was killing her emotions<br>2.- Shirou's second projection against Kuzuki. Remember? "Danger, this is too much for me, I'll die if I project again... I will die if I project swords...? I don't know about other people, BUT THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL I WILL DIE FROM CREATING SWORDS!"<br>3.- They removed some of Archer's lines before he fought Shirou, like when he said that he was hoping for a paradox, or this one: "Right, this is wrong. This is not what I wished for. I DID NOT BECOME A GUARDIAN FOR THIS!"<br>4.- Before Shirou dragged Gilgamesh inside UBW, they swordspammed a LOT more.<br>5.- They didn't use "Ever-present Feeling" for that Shirou and Rin scene, and they made Rin HIT Shirou for no reason.<br>6.- The fucking awful character design in some episodes, like pic related. Fucking UGUUU</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they made Rin HIT Shirou for no reason. <br>It was a push and it ended better than in the VN with her face on his back.</br></br>  <br>The VN must be really shit.</br>  <br>It also killed her character a bit and forced her into the tsundere archetype.<br><br>Yeah, it was bad.</br></br></br>  <br>This.<br><br> Using secondary as an insult <br>Absolutely pathetic.</br></br></br></br>  <br> it was bad <br>It wasn't and it wasn't forcing anything. You being a paranoid about it though is your fault for being autistic.</br></br>  <br>Whether the VN is shit or not depend if you like Shirou.</br>  <br>UBW will sell like shit because it betrayed the original fans and tried to appeal to Zero secondaries, and Miura failed at that too. Nasu said he wanted a work different from Zero, but Miura recently confirmed that he tried to deliver a Zero sequel. He failed and Nasu got cucked.</br>  <br>You really need to be a special kind of retard to still be trying to use this tired bait. You must be one bored motherfucker if those 9 months of shitting on UBW didn't satisfy you.<br><br>I am out, this thread was shit to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br>Overall I enjoyed UBW, but I'm salty about what I said earlier.<br><br>For me, those were key scenes very important to empathize with Archer and Shirou.</br></br></br>  <br>Original fans? F/SN was 11 years ago. Majority of the fans have probably moved on, they need newer fans, which is what Zero did. If they want sales, it makes much more sense to pander to the Zerofags.</br>  Fatefags, your threads wouldn't be so full of shitposting if you just told people to try out the anime and if they liked it read the VN as supplemental material. Instead you used the VN as a trial of passage into your little secret club. Did you honestly think that for people who don't like this type of series in the first place, they will suddenly take a liking to a bloated version of the same thing, in a completely foreign medium? And when they feel like their expectations have been betrayed and the whole thing wasted 50 hours of their time it's no wonder that they backlash against the same people who touted the VN like the holy grail. You reap what you sow.  <br>But Zerofags hated it. Pandering to old fans would secure over 30k. I think that'll not happen now.</br>  <br>I started like that and I regret nothing. It's like a method to filter idiots out.</br>  <br>UBW S2 will probably sell around 30k though.</br>  <br>Less standing around and talking during 'fight' scenes, more screaming about philosophy while engaged in crazy fights.<br><br>Make three different versions of Emiya (standard, plaintive strings / whatever soft, bombastic) and use them liberally where appropriate.<br><br>Give them their noses back.<br><br>That's about all you could do without changing the VN significantly.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone have the image with a soldier saying the king looks like a little girl and another one denies it?<br>Last time i saw it was years ago but i don't lurk Fate threads that mutch anymore.</br>  <br>Replace the Archer episodes with the UBW movie and VN music.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=S5V<wbr>f8obhTd4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>-VN OST instead of special tailor shit<br>-Shirou vs Archer actually engage in non-stop melee combat instead of retarded sword spam<br><br>There, UBW is now 8/10 instead of 5/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>This is way better than the shit by ufotable<br><br>but it bugs me that shirou can deflect all the swords by just waving his hands</br></br></br>  <br> Shirou vs Archer actually engage in non-stop melee combat <br>This is what I missed the most. From the second Shirou said "I am the bone of my sword" the fight went insane with attacks coming from both sides like crazy.</br></br>  <br><br>No, stop missing the point of their fights.</br></br>  <br>They could've handled it the same as in the VN but adding some stuff, like Shirou's thoughts flowing into Archer's mind the same way he saw the Kiritsugu flashback in post-epilogue answer. They didn't need to change it so much, it was unnecessary.<br><br>I know the point of the fight and I love it too, but taking away the "cool" part from it was a mistake. Shirou is supposed to look ugly and miserable, that part of the fight in the VN was a great example that the adaptation couldn't portray very well.<br><br>Aw man, we could've had something so much better, still liked it overall because it's my favorite route, but when Archer's farewell to Rin didn't move at all I knew something was off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He looked miserable, his fighting was all over the place and Archer wasn't even trying. If you didn't like how it went then it's your loss it was a great adaptation.</br>  Honestly, I mostly just wish we got a different soundtrack. Almost everything would be better with a more interesting OST and better sound direction. <br><br>I mean, the original VN's music wasn't all that great (except for a few tracks), and it definitely sounded kinda cheap, but it had character.<br><br>Fukusawa Hideyuki's compositions were very professional and wouldn't have been out of place in a Hollywood film, but they were just so boring -- there was literally nothing memorable about it. <br><br>Anyone else felt left down by the music? Fukusawa did good work for Mahoyo, too, so I really don't get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's not what secondary means you fucking appropriator.</br>  <br>Not really, I think it's one of the better produced anime OSTs for TV in years. That is had no character is one of the lst things I would say about it.</br>  <br> The contributions of Mr. Hideyuki Fukasawa, who did the music, were large, even in terms of calories. For the first time in TV Anime history (I believe), he made 400 compositions for the entire score of the film while referencing the drawings. And he was even present for the dubbing. I requested music at the end of the provisional cuts (shooting the drawings, and setting the timings in order). The voice actors' voices are also added at this stage. But drawings keep being added afterwards, and the cutting process is repeated in accordance with those additions, until I finally have them do the FX. The music is written and recorded live in between that provisional cutting and the actual cutting, so when we alter a place where music was added, the music has to be adjusted once more. Fukasawa does that adjusting, and also handles orders for the the final adjustments during dubbing. That is how much he has done for us. I am grateful. <br><br>Fukasawa's work on UBW was literally groundbreaking.</br></br></br>  <br> 5.- They didn't use "Ever-present Feeling" for that Shirou and Rin scene, and they made Rin HIT Shirou for no reason. <br>FUCKING THIS.<br><br>That scene was the worst adapted one.<br><br><br>They could have done that with no &gt;lol tsundere punch xD</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you watch the scene? She didn't hit him, she pushed him off the rock they were sitting on. The scene was fine.</br>  <br>Push, punch, it doesn't matter. It wasn't in the VN and instead of adding to the adaptation, it takes away from it.<br><br> The scene was fine <br>Are you that autist?</br></br></br></br>  <br>A gentle push is a lot different from physically hitting someone. You're saying I'm autistic, but you're failing to look at the context of what went down.<br><br>She was embarrassed about Shirou confessing to her, pushed him, and then ended up crying on his back. The whole scene had a good rhythm to it.<br><br>Like seriously, there's a big difference between a generic tsundere smack, and what happened there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dYO<wbr>rZ_FVhkg</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>I mean watch this shit again. You might have built this up to be more than what it was in your head.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not saying you're autistic, I'm asking you if you're THAT autist who will defend this shit for hour on end.<br><br>And you already answered it. Go fuck yourself.</br></br></br>  <br> Are you that autist? <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autis<wbr>m#Repetitive_behavior<br> Sameness is resistance to change; for example, insisting that the furniture not be moved or refusing to be interrupted. <br><br>Are you?</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>There's nothing to change that would make it better, it was shit and the source material is shit. Deal with it nerd.</br>  <br>That literally defines his behavior, I fail to see your point.</br>  <br>Oh wait, are you the fucking dude from a couple months ago who had this same conversation with me? You said they made the scene comedic or something?<br><br>Yeah man, whatever, I don't agree, but if you don't like it, you don't like it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Simple.<br><br>Kawai Kenji does the OST<br><br>Reworked the Archer vs Shirou fight<br><br>Reworked the Shirou vs Gilgamesh fight<br><br>There, fixed.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I disagree with everything you just said.</br>  <br>Archer-Shirou fight was so fucking boring, drawn out, and unnecessary. In the VN it was short to the point and wasn't repeated over and over and over and over and over and over like a fucking broken ass record. They also ran low on budget on some of the fights like the Berserker and Hercules fight so it wasn't really fleshed out or as intense as it was supposed to be. Those among a host of other problems with the second half's pacing.<br><br>It was good but it could've been much better had they not fucked certain parts up and expanded on other ones. Epilogue was great and Rin is mai waifu for laifu so it has that going for it.</br></br></br>  <br>You really fail to see the irony in this? Whatever.</br>  <br>I don't really remember anything that was overly repeated in the anime fight that wasn't in the VN. They slowed the fight down to get the point of the fight across, which I think was really the only way they could have done it while getting the proper themes of the story down.<br><br>Also Berserker vs Heracles wasn't really anything in the VN either. If anything, the anime did more with it.</br></br></br>  <br>This MAD does a better job of explaining the fight than the anime did and it's only 2 minutes not 2 1/2 episodes.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=bqK<wbr>DmPr7wTk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Yeah it's pretty damn drawn out. They pretty much repeated "drown in your ideals and die" like 10 times in the anime. It is by far the most awful part of the entire series sans any scene Saber is in.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> berserker vs heracles <br>what the fuck am I reading?<br>secondaries please die</br></br></br>  <br>"secondaries"? just sounds like he was typing without thinking</br>  <br>I've got a question for you, have you actually sat down and watched the whole series recently? Like, from 0 through 25? I did, and a lot of these complaints I see about pacing or repetitiveness don't really make any sense to me anymore. It all flows very naturally from one episode to the next.<br><br><br>I meant Gil vs Berserker. It wasn't really a big thing in the novel.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't ironic if I'm actively trying to not start the conversation again, which you know would have happened if I left you to your own devices.</br>  I am the night.  <br>I would rewrite it so I cared about the characters, and then I'd hire someone different to draw their facial features, and then I'd stick a knife in the special effects and filters.</br>  <br>Fights would be much more grounded.<br>I would find a way to use every single CG still.<br>GIL VS SHIROU NOT GETTING INTERRUPTED WHAT THE FUCK.<br>Actually doing fight scenes according to the VN.<br>Tiger Dojo endings.<br>NO 3DCG.<br>Openings by the same guys who did DEEN's.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  To be honest, I don't think there's anything more I could want out of the damn show. It's a top tier adaptation. The sheer amount of care and love given into this adaptation is crazy. How many shows get three separate hour long episodes? I mean you read interviews from people lie Miura and the folks at Ufotable, and you see they really do give a shit.<br><br>I'll be honest, I love FSN, and UBW is my favorite route, and as someone who had really high expectations going into this, I was still stunned in places. I've ended up watching certain episodes 10+ times, with at least the whole series at this point four times around all together. I don't think there's anything /a/ related I've actively enjoyed as much as this.</br></br>  <br>I agree, this surpassed my already high expectations. I wouldn't really change anything about it. UBW isn't my favorite route so I hope HF is at least half as good as this was.</br>  <br>I AM NOT YOUR AUTUMN MOON<br><br>I AM THE NIGHT</br></br></br>  <br> Tell me exactly how you would change it. Be specific. <br><br>I'd probably add in the rest of the Nasuverse first off. Give some of the characters from the other franchises some love. <br>Maybe lighten it up a bit and insert some comedy into it and get some interactions we wouldn't usually get. <br>Most importantly I'd probably give it a bit of a name change so that people are aware it's not longer a straight adaption. I'd give it a cool name like Festival Marble or something.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 30 episodes worth in time <br>I loved the adaptation, bless UFO.</br></br>  <br> Shirou monologues <br> more VN music </br></br>  <br>By the end, I'm not sure what monologues were still needed.<br><br>Same with the music. They used more VN music than any TM anime before it.</br></br></br>  <br> By the end, I'm not sure what monologues were still needed. <br>They wouldn't even need monologues if they just did a better job of explaining things. I hate secondaries how actually think Assassin lost to Saber for legitimate reasons.</br></br>  <br>Well see, the explanation was there, you see the hilt of the sword was cracked.<br><br>There was a stated intent with the anime to show more than tell, and I think they accomplished that. If you are actually paying attention to what's going on on the screen, I'm not sure how many questions are really left.</br></br></br>  <br>I would probably do shorter versions of all three routes in one series. you could shorten each one a little because alot of the background is the same at least in the beginning.</br>  <br> If you are actually paying attention to what's going on on the screen <br>Most people don't.</br></br>  <br> Reworked the Archer vs Shirou fight <br>Yeah, you could probably cut like ten minutes from that thing.</br></br>  <br>Well is that really the fault of the series?<br><br>I've posted this before, but this was something they stated as a goal. They wanted to show more than tell.<br><br> When the art is good, you don't need to spell it out </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Normally one would blame retards for not noticing that shit, for some reason people want to blame Ufo for things 90% of the time would be blamed on stupid viewers in this was a different franchise.<br><br>That obsession with wanting secondaries to understand everything clearly is nonsensical.</br></br></br>  <br>The number of stupid viewers is too high.</br>  <br> three separate hour long episodes <br>Ep 0, ep 1 and...?</br></br>  <br>12.</br>  <br>That' really not so bad. It's nowhere near Toradora tier.</br>  <br>Not really, most people understand or don't even care about those details in the first place. A lot were willing suspend their disbelief and never bothered by "inconcistencies".</br>  <br>What is the point of showing all these cool things if they can't even get the viewer to care?</br>  Left or right?  <br>I'll never do that with any woman. When you think of it like this, it's not so hard.</br>  <br>Not with that kind of attitude, you won't.</br>  <br>I accepted that long ago, my master agrees.</br>  <br>I'm genuinely curious. Outside of her sadism, she's a caring leader and seems to value fairness. <br>She even acts like a mother/older sister to her Jaegers.<br>If it is her sadism that you hate her for, it's a little hypocritical to speak of how much you'd enjoy bashing her with a hammer.</br></br></br>  <br>Right.<br><br>Definitely right.<br><br> the feel when she'll never lick me to mark me as her territory </br></br></br></br></br>  Traitors. Traitors everywhere.  <br>hans and chamo aren't traitors.</br>  Hans is best  girl.   Traitors and this face.  <br>Does this look like a face you would betray?</br>  <br>Fugg, delete your post fegit.</br></blockquote>]
