[  [Cthuko] Gatchaman Crowds Insight - 01 [Hi10P 1280x720 H264][8d9f2446].mkv   You might be trying to be cheeky, but there are actual subs out  <br>Shit, you're right.<br><br> that Music goes on at the start <br>Fuck yeah.</br></br></br></br>  I'm only finding links to episode 0. Before I finish downloading it, what is it?  <br>WHAT. AAAAAAAAAAAaaaaAAAAAAAAAAA<br><br>WHERE IS MY ROLLING GIRLS<br><br>WHERE IS MY YATTERMAN<br><br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>couple minutes of recap and then the gang saving prime minister. <br><br>also BANE</br></br></br>  This new OP sucks hard compared to Crowds.  CRASHING THIS PLANE WITH NO SURVIVORS  <br>thats a cool rubiks cube</br>  <br> bane </br>  <br>Tell me about bane. Why does he wear the mask?</br>  It airs on this Sat on the 4th.<br><br>Stop scaring me.</br></br>   PLAY <br> THE <br> GAME </br></br>  is rui rui still relevant in Insight?<br>I need more rui rui in my life.</br>  <br>Yes, he's a gatchaman now.</br>  I'm getting fired up for this. I loved the first season and it's theme song  <br>I would play his game.</br>  Seriously, what's wrong with the torrent? It keeps saying "downloading from 0 out of 0 peers."  <br>its just you.</br>  <br>can't wait for all the new rui doujins.</br>  Fuck, I still have seven episodes of the original to go.  <br>????</br>  <br>Get on to it anon. <br><br>link related<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sJG<wbr>mvyH7EMM</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would  hold  his  hand. </br>  <br> Bane <br> Text says VAPE <br> PM obviously says Veipu <br> Phoenix Fire <br> Obviously said Phoenix DORAIVU </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like you just got meme'd by the notmemecartel!</br>  The episode was hype as fuck. Shit was bananas. If S2 can keep this pace and feel, it'll be a great season.  <br> Cthuko <br><br>No thanks.</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with Cthuko other than being slow as fuck?</br>   GATCHAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN <br>Fuck yeah they kept the OST. I'm so hype right now you guys</br>   Hajime on a first name basis with the prime minister <br><br>based</br></br>  did I hear someone say bird?  Ah, excellent I see Cthuko has picked up another show without ever finishing anything else they've ever picked up.  <br>Kaneki fanboy</br>  They got the same studio to do the OP, right?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=_rj<wbr>gqU34B3s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Yeah, the new op's at the end of episode 0</br>  Tell me about Vape.  <br>That's just the song, no the animation.</br>  <br>They did eventually finish Crowds S1, Zvezda and Yozakura Quartet.</br>  I NEED PICTURES<br><br>PICTURES OF HAJIME</br></br>   memesubs <br> multiple translations just blatantly wrong <br>T-Thanks.<br><br>Just kidding; fuck you. I'll wait for Cthuko.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But who doesn't like localized meme fansubs? They're much better for the average viewer, and the elitism of preferring "honorifics" or TL notes is just retarded. It's like the difference between playing chess and memorizing every single chess move so you can be a "grandmaster" of moving pieces on a board.</br>  <br>I agree, I live for memes.</br>  <br/>  Great, another show they won't fucking finish.<br><br> Please finish Yatterman god damnit </br></br>   trapfu is ready <br>Dick is ready too</br>   Ep 0 is about the gang destroying 20 billion worth of planes <br>Now that's how I like it. Good old super heroes.<br>No one died, but everything exploded and they ain't paying for that.</br></br>  <br>Are those 2 planes really that pricey?</br>  <br>Is it really first episode or misnamed ep. 0 / Inbound?</br>  <br> WHERE IS MY YATTERMAN <br>Fucking this...is what I would say if the last episode was actually worth anything at all.</br></br>  Anyone actually watch this anime? I found the first season bland, and has a very shitty animation.  <br>Aren't the BDs out now?</br>  <br>Technically yes but no one has uploaded it yet.</br>  <br>They finished Shirobako shortly after it aired too.</br>  Jesus Christ, I know that it hasn't even started and this episode was just to grab our attention, but goddamn that was good.  That was pure fucking hype, I love it.  <br>I would hold his dick in my mouth.</br>  <br>I like you.<br><br>I want to see his face as I  struggle to accommodate his girth in my mouth.  Hell, I want to see my own face as I do.</br></br></br>  <br>163, 074, 400 USD for two planes.<br><br>That's actually not too bad, depending on what kind of plane they were.</br></br></br>  Was the animation any better than the first season?  <br>No, the art and animation was garbage. Worse drawings I've ever seen in my life.<br>But for Utsutsu's sake, I looked passed it.<br><br>The music also makes up for it by the load.</br></br></br></br>  So has it improved at all or is it still a preachy Hajime-wankfest? Because I have zero interest in watching another "Social Media Will Save The World: The Series".<br><br>Are the characters at least less shallow than before? Does Hajime seem like she's actually capable of having meaningful relationships and interactions with other characters now?</br></br>  <br> So has it improved at all or is it still a preachy Hajime-wankfest? Because I have zero interest in watching another "Social Media Will Save The World: The Series". <br>No.<br><br>First one was Facebook:The Anime, 2nd is Twittergeddon: Return to Analog</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's only been a short episode, how the fuck would they be able to do any of that shit in a 14 minute clip, with 5 minutes of it being a recap?<br><br>We do get to see Hajime and Katsu's wacky relationship and Rui finally getting a suit.</br></br></br>  <br>Episode 0 is 1/4 recap, 2/4 Evil Red Crowds Combat, and 1/4 dialogue. I'd argue that the animation's a wee bit better.<br><br>Can't wait for newgirl.</br></br></br>  What's NiiGATA guys?  <br>The character design is so androgynous I have trouble telling sometimes.</br>  Did I just hear the powerpuff girls' theme for the ending?<br>Shit, I hope the OST would be part old songs, part new and some remixes of the old ones.<br>Firebird was not used enough and it would be great if they could change up some of them.<br><br>More German opera dubstep would be fucking tits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>She's been in promotional art with tits. It's a gril.<br><br>Sorry about the image quality; can't find anything better-looking.</br></br></br>  <br>I have no problem with this.</br>  <br>She looks like a silverhaired version of Sugane.</br>  Hajime's tits seem bigger this season.  <br>YES<br><br> Extra space for Katz </br></br></br>  <br>I would beat his game.</br>  <br> Katz <br>But he's dead anon.</br></br>  <br>Summer pls</br>   people dislike Hajime <br>How is it even possible to have such shit taste?<br> people saying the art and animation are bad <br>No, you don't know what the fuck you are talking about.</br></br></br>  <br> How is it even possible to have such shit taste? <br>Some people hate genki.<br> people saying the art and animation are bad <br>The first season was very, very cheap more than half of the time.</br></br></br></br>  <br> The first season was very, very cheap more than half of the time. <br>Which doesn't mean the art and the animation were bad. I'd say Gatchaman Crowds has some of the better CG in the medium and the art is very unique and interesting. Besides, the BDs pretty much fix any issues the show had, including the inconclusive ending.</br></br>  <br> calling me summer because you didn't get the joke <br>Summer please</br></br>  <br> Which doesn't mean the art and the animation were bad <br>The art and animation often were bad.</br></br>  <br> people dislike Hajime <br>Because people are bitter cunts.</br></br>  <br>No, they weren't.</br>  <br>Then you need to go get your eyes checked ASAP</br>  <br>They spent most of their money getting a good timeslot and many of it on their music as well as CG. The artwork and drawing look like dog shit most of the time but everything else was pretty damn good.<br>The fact that the CG pops out yet also sticks to the background is pretty amazing.</br></br>  <br>Or maybe you should just stop trolling.</br>  <br>The ending where that guy was sleeping, reminded me of sanic.</br>  <br> bane ka.. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wSR<wbr>ylVSfxyw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>   OP being mean and getting my hopes up <br>If you'll excuse me, I'll be away from the screen</br>  So this show won't be done by CR or Funi?  <br>It should be, though it might have not been announced yet. There's HorribleSubs for all of the first season.</br>  dis gon b gud<br><br>*unzip black mamba*</br></br>  Is Ruri's bird form is a crow?  <br>It's probably CR, I doubt Funi would pick it up considering they haven't picked up the first season.</br>  <br>Only Sugune and Joe have forms based on birds though, Paimon as well maybe.</br>  <br>Hajime's looks a bit like a bird of paradise. Paiman's is an owl.</br>  <br>Red skin blue hair dfc is true Paiman form?</br>  <br>I can't even tell. I assume she's just a girl in an armor.<br>She looks more like the villains on Berg Katsu's team than anything.</br></br>  <br>You can see Paiman's head and ears at the very bottom below the blue hair kid.</br>  <br>No that's the alien in the spinning ship at the end of the episode. She's an oompa loompa voiced by KanaHana.</br>  <br>No, she's an alium. She's most likely the one flying that clover-shaped spaceship down to Earth in the episode 0.<br><br>I'm hoping she's some kind of alien diplomat or something coming to check out Earth.</br></br></br>  OD probably won't transform this season, right? I also wonder if Hajime's bird form will ever change because of Berg being within her.  <br>Unless a newer, bigger villain (other than the red Crowds) shows up, he won't really have a reason to transform. He's like a last resort planet-melter kind of guy when he does.</br>  <br>How do I get a paizuri from this autist?</br>   OD probably won't transform this season, right? <br>OD is kill. He set his own death flag last season when he went bird and nothing happened. I'd also wager Hajime/Berg will probably be the one to do it too.</br>  Will this season have a completely undecipherable OP again?  <br>Just ask, she will be happy to give.</br>  <br>I doubt OD will transform again but there's a chance. Even if he does transform he only have a few seconds and I can't imagine anyone or anything besides the psycho that destroyed his planet could push him to such an extreme.<br><br>Also, seems Hajime's form is the same as the new Kamen Rider Drive's final form where one of the two people inside their body could just switch over and take control but Hajime seems to have tamed Berg pretty well.<br><br>it would still be nice to see a scene where Hajime gets in trouble and got knocked out only for Berg to take control and save her.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes</br>  What social media outlet will the tranny use this time to save the world?  <br>I was once stupid enough to try and sing it for Karaoke.<br>Holy crap was I surprised. Even the kids who spoke Japanese was confused as shit and told me it was okay cause they didn't know what the fuck was going on.</br></br>  <br>Can you be a bit more respectful, please?</br>  <br><br>Twitter. Everyone has to tweet how much they dont like the bad guy and he gets sad and fucks off.</br></br>  <br>D-mail combined with Eden</br>  <br> 4chan </br>  <br>He is merely a crossdresser.</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>Same difference<br><br>Fucked in the head is fucked in the head</br></br></br>  <br>/pol/ please, there is nothing wrong in enjoying girly clothes.</br>  <br>That's Gelsadra, basically new villain.</br>  <br>Can't tell if it's a male or female.</br>  <br>Female I'm told.<br> Fuck this gay earth </br></br>  <br> /pol/  <br><br>Whatever lets you sleep at night</br></br></br>  <br> double peace sign </br>  <br>I can't even be hype, because no one can compare to Katze.<br><br>But that loli body interests me greatly.</br></br></br>  <br> red skin <br> black diamond patterns like Katz <br> navel window <br> bare thighs <br> heels <br><br>I just might be in love.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now I'm worried, anon. Don't do this to me.<br><br>Told by whom?</br></br></br>  <br>His dad works for Gatchaman.</br>  <br>Can his dad do BIRD GO like the cool gatchas??</br>  Tsubasa Misudachi<br> A 16-year-old second year high school student from Nagaoka in Niigata Prefecture. <br> She is also a new Gatchaman, and as a Gatchaman she is Hajime's new partner. <br> She has an impulsive personality. When she's angry she slips into her home city's dialect. </br></br></br>  <br><br>She's pretty cute. I wonder if she'll have a really scary-looking suit.</br></br>  <br>Spunky girls with short hair &gt; all</br>  <br>Just imagine her shoes when it's raining.</br>  <br>I said he worked for them, not that he was a Gatchaman but who knows, maybe he got promoted.</br>  <br> Told by whom? <br>Just some anon who seemed to know what he was talking about in a thread a week or so ago. On one hand, I like /ss/ too much not to be a little dissapointed. On the other hand, red loli berg katse super villain. I can only hope she's as obnoxious as him.</br></br>  <br> When she's angry she slips into her home city's dialect. </br>  <br>She doesn't look like the crazy type like Berg though, rather looks more like one of those smug motherfuckers that always smile and shit.<br><br>It'll be hard to replace Berg anyway and it wouldn't be fun to see a villain that would be the same as him. Maybe she's one of those manipulative and sadistic emotionless ones.</br></br></br>  <br> I can only hope she's as obnoxious as him. <br>You know that's just impossible.</br></br>  <br>I hope the creators realize that nothing can really replace Katze. Hell, he's still technically part of the series, just shoved between Hajime's tits. Instead of trying to one-up him, I hope they make the new villain just as villainous/fabulous, just in a different way. Like having a plan.</br>  <br><br><br>Smug and bantery is good too. There's probably no topping webm related<br><br>http://a.uguu.se/rpaghf.webm</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This is a good season for Mamoru fans. We will get both some Katze and some Kida.</br>  <br><br>When he showed up suddenly in Ep 0 I felt quite relieved. I'm glad they're just putting his existence out there and not making a big deal about it.</br></br>  I want to impregnate both of them!  <br><br>God I love the first beats of the original OP. Made you so hype for the rest of it.</br></br>  Quick shop of what we might get down the road. I think it will be cool if the suit are controlled by both of them  <br>I just realized Hajime has 2 notes. Hopefully she goes ZX mode. Maybe even use other notes to mix different suits.</br>  Also comparison between s1 and s2 suit.  <br><br>Wait, why does she have two notes? Is the second one Katze's?</br></br>  <br> he doesn't like wearing pretty dresses </br>  <br><br>I like how the lower eyes make :&gt; grin.</br></br>    <br>Yep. The yellow(?) one is the same color Katze's was, just without his custom Gatchaman logo. Hajime's is the white one.<br><br>I hope they kind of tone down the whole social networking theme for some fights this time around. We didn't get any really good ones in the first season.</br></br></br>  <br>Ta dah~ it's fap time!<br><br> http://exhentai.org/g/757608/3a2d10<wbr>b42c/</wbr> </br></br></br>  <br> Dat red <br>So that's where all of Berg-Katze's hair went.</br></br>  <br>how did Katze get a note? he has same powers as JJJ?</br>  <br>Actually, if you look at it right, the "lips" could actually be eyes, just lower than Hajime's. Damn it, now I want their height on the faceplate relative to each other to represent who has control of the body, with Katze creeping upward slightly every time he takes over.</br>  Again, someone is getting fired for forgetting to colour that pinky-hook-thingamajig.<br><br> Yes, this is water bottle guy. </br></br>  <br> someone is getting fired <br>Nope.<br>Misses like that happen all the time.</br></br></br>      Second year students drama soon. Are you ready for Oboe and Flute drama.  I really like how this one turned out<br><br>so for good old times sake, which section would you join? trombros where we at?</br></br>  <br>Does she really? I'd like novelanon to talk more about her and her circumstances.</br>    <br/>  <br>Oboe/fagott <br>DOUBLE REEDS UNITE</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Hazuki standing between Riko and Gouto <br>Man, what a fucking cunt. No wonder she got dumped by Shuuichi.</br></br>  Bloody hell, Natsuki is so dreamy.  I'm kinda conflicted here. I'm so curious on what's going to happen next to the point I want to look at the spoiler. But will there be second season? I don't want to get spoiled.  <br><br>I can't look at screenshots of these drink cartons without thinking it's cigarettes. I had the same problem with Pleiades.</br></br>  <br>Hazuki is their adopted daughter. It's a nice Tuba family dynamic.</br>  <br>It's her purple bedroom eyes. It's like she's about to suck you dry before you even get to react.</br>  Why was Asuka's UFO silver and not gold?  <br>Read the spoilers.</br>  <br>It's  her Dad's UFO. </br>  <br>reminder that Left Fagott is objectively the best</br>  So what's the point of switching to the blue semen demon in the middle of the performance? It kinda ruined it to be honest.  <br>Why would they adopt someone who doesn't even know how to properly take a bath with her Tubacabra?</br>  <br>I wish we got a scene like that for right fagott too.<br>Hottest chicks in the band.</br></br>  <br>So they can teach her together.</br>  <br>They'll impart that knowledge to her in time just as parents teach their children about the world.</br>  That pout.  Smile status: Saved  <br>But Riko and Gouto would already take up all the space. There is no place for someone as useless as Hazuki.<br>They shouldn't have to teach anything to their kid who would already be born with perfect knowledge and love for Tuba.</br></br>    <br>I see it too. I'd do a Vietnam Taki with that shot if I wasn't so lazy.</br>  <br>Why was Flute-chan sad?</br>  <br><br>I'm going to sleep after I finish typing this so don't expect any answers unless this thread is up in 12 hours which I doubt<br><br>  To start off, Mizore is a girl with an inferiority complex and low self esteem. Which is ironic because she ends up playing the most difficult instrument at the highest skill level. But anyway, Mizore had no friends in and a personality that doesn't let her play well with others. She's often described as "too cold" and she's the kind of person that speaks in short phrases. So along comes Nozomi who is the only girl who actually speaks to Mizore and Mizore more or less falls in love with her. Nozomi is the one who invites her to join the music club with her; Mizore's parents buy her an oboe, parents of the year amirite. And things go great, middle school is fun and Mizore plays with passion; however, they get cocky and end up getting Silver during their last year which ends their club time. This cuts Mizore pretty deep for but for reasons that'll be explained later. So then everyone from their school which includes Natsuki and Yuuko decide to go to Kitauji which is a local school. The club there is bad but they planned to pull off an underdog story to Nationals. Until they find out that the club sucks so much that they're all put in B-team while the slacker seniors get to play in A-team. The only other oboe ends up quitting for some reason and this puts Mizore suddenly into the A-team and this separates Nozomi and Mizore. Nozomi who wanted to play and Mizore who wanted to be with Nozomi. Nozomi confronts the seniors and it ends in an argument that leads to everyone except Natsuki, Yuuko and Mizore quitting. Natsuki's reason is Nozomi related, Yuuko's reason for not quitting is that Kaori asked her to stay. Sadly, nobody asked Mizore to come with them. Not even Nozomi whom Mizore considered her only friend told Nozomi to quit with them. So Mizore felt like she was tossed aside and worthless.  </br></br></br></br>  It's over, KyoAni is finished.  <br>Thanks for everything today, night.</br>  <br>Poor oboe-chan.<br><br>Must've been super duper awkward seeing each other around in classes and stuff after the club fallout.</br></br></br>  <br> hibike! Euphonium 2: senpai wars. </br>  Asuka's a bitch, but by god that body. Would plough.  <br>Do these friends not have any interaction outside of band, holy shit. <br><br>Go grab some McWonalds or something.</br></br></br>  <br> Fell in love? <br>With her music right?</br></br>  <br>So much suffering behind those eyes.</br>  <br><br>Fucking UFO-kun gets all the cute girls, lucky bastard .</br></br>  <br><br>   So along comes Nozomi who is the only girl who actually speaks to Mizore and Mizore more or less falls in love with her <br><br>OH BABY</br></br></br></br>   Best part of the series is volume 2 <br> We will never have a second season </br>  <br>The promo art for these two is going to be baity alright.</br>  <br><br>I'd rather volume 3 since it's about Asuka which is clearly foreshadowed in this season.</br></br>  A right cutie. <br><br>Fuck the police (Asuka). Nozomi should be in the band.</br></br>  AH dat melody gives me goosebumps. Made me shed a tear, such beautiful melodies and Reina's playing is EXQUISITE  <br><br>I'm just in stitches imagining Kyoani's 2nd ED. The bait is gonna be off the charts.</br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>Implying KyoAni will not go anime original just to have all cuties play in cast</br>  <br>this one is summarized too much cause I'm sleepy<br> so this cuts to next year where everyone gits gud. Nozomi is actually at the concert as we see in this episode. After seeing the performance, she wants to come back to the club. But before she can come back, she wants to get Asuka's approval. Asuka actually tried to stop Nozomi from leaving, also called her chickenshit for quitting but Nozomi left anyway. So Nozomi wants Asuka to accept that she needs her in the club. But Asuka finds out that Mizore being near Nozomi causes Mizore to freak out so in order to protect the Oboe, Asuka doesn't let Nozomi back in. Nozomi keeps coming back everyday, also hangs out a lot with Natsuki to pass the time. Kumiko ends up talking to Mizore several times and learns more about her. Mizore doesn't like concerts because they put a value on your hardwork, and that the judges can deem your efforts worthless. It's not really the concerts though that she hates but something about herself. Also Mizore's solo is criticized by Taki sensei's friend who came as an adviser. He says Mizore playing is flawless but only because she plays like she is a robot, without emotion. Kumiko later talks to Nozomi and learns about her circumstances too. And Kumiko tries her best to mediate this situation, trying to figure out why Asuka won't let Nozomi back in and what is Mizore's deal. Asuka eventually tells everything to Kumiko after Kumiko confronts her about it, and asks Kumiko can she really tell Nozomi that the reason why she can't come back is because Mizore hates her? Kumiko ends up just asking Nozomi why she didnt ask Mizore to leave with her which causes Nozomi to go find Mizore. And this ends up causing an absolutely disastrous moment where Nozomi is chasing Mizore down the hallway, Mizore just freaking out. Yuuko stops Nozomi and Mizore gets away. Kumiko finds Mizore on the floor of another classroom at which point we find out what the real deal is between them. </br></br>  <br>She's important in the second novel too.</br>  According to some novel readers Hazuki and Midori become background characters and Reina is more of a secondary character after vol. 1. If KyoAni ever makes another season I'd like to still see them hang with Kumiko. Hazuki was already getting friendly with Reina during this last episode.  <br>They are background characters in S1 already.</br>  If I could have your attention please, best girl has a few words.  <br>[citation needed]</br>  <br>Only after episode 8. They were secondary characters for most of the season but not background waifus.</br>  <br><br>   called her chickenshit for quitting <br><br>Absolutely based</br></br></br></br>  Do you think someone at KyoAni got fired after this? How could anyone miss this?  That nothing. <br><br><br>All of this drama.<br><br>Kumiko "helping", shame there's no season two for me to get some popcorn and tea. <br><br><br>It's ridiculous. It's like they fast travel between classes and band, that's it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They did the exact same thing to the animator's hands. After that the industry never saw another case of these hands in a show.</br>   liking faggot <br>go blow one yourself, fag</br>  <br><br>Mizore is emotionally unstable. Why does she even go to school? She belongs to a psychiatric ward.</br></br>   No KyoAni next season <br><br>Well I guess I'll catch up with my backlog.</br></br>  <br>The REAL president has a few words to say.</br>  <br>Not even classes, they could talk there. I mean,  maybe if Nozomi was butthurt I could see her ignoring Mizore but fuck, Mizore was clearly innocent.  It makes no sense. This is coming from someone with no friends though, I don't know how it works</br>  <br>Does KnK 2nd movie count? Rips might be out this season.</br>  <br>I'm all ears, best girl.</br>  <br>I love Mizore. After I'm done with the book I'm working on I want to read the Euphonium series especially for her. Also for Haruka who is my other favorite.</br>  <br>Haruka is such a good girl</br>  So s2 is happening or not?  So Ribbon, Natsuki, Oboe replaces Asuka, Kaori, Buchou and they become the new big 3?  <br><br>I guess they are putting their everything on the Free! movie.</br></br>  <br>we must break the reed</br>  <br>Nozomi please go, and stay go.</br>  <br>mizore doesn't either<br><br>she probably figures "well, that's how it is I guess"</br></br></br>  <br>ＮＯ</br>  What's her name?  <br><br> wanting this semen demon to leave <br><br>Fagott</br></br></br></br>  <br> poor mans Asuka <br>There's already real Asuka, and the fagotts.</br></br>  <br>Lipstick orifice.</br>  <br><br>She doesn't even look like Asuka more like a Reina clone.

Is there a word for yandere but with violent part replaced with self degrading? Cause that's Mizore. So Mizore doesn't hate Nozomi, she's just afraid to see her. Mizore thinks of Nozomi as the most important thing in her life while Mizore feels that Nozomi is just a girl who is nice to everyone, think Yuigahama. Even so, Mizore was happy with that until the incident that left her behind which left her feeling worthless, which is what her beef with concerts is about. The reason why Mizore has gotten so good is so that Nozomi will notice her. The reason she plays the oboe is because it's the only thing that remains between her and Nozomi. Nozomi is all she has in her life. So then steps in Yuuko, who has been Mizore's friend since middleschool and has been looking after her this whole time Mizore who calls her out on her shit. That Mizore thinks of everyone and everything else as nothing to her. That all these friends she's ignoring she considers are worthless to her. Yuuko asks Mizore what she is to her, and Mizore says Yuuko is just someone who is pitying her, which pisses Yuuko off even more and makes Yuuko grab both of Mizore's ears. Yuuko genuinely cares about Mizore, but she's too much of an idiot to see it. Then Yuuko, while still holding onto Mizore's ears, asks Mizore has everything in this club meant nothing to her then? The music she's played, the fun they've had, the suffering they've been through from all the tournaments, the happiness when they made it to Kansai. Mizore finally understands she's her own person and not worthless and asks Yuuko if she deserves to be this happy and starts crying on Yuuko's shoulder when she tells her of course. And then Nozomi shows up at the doorway, dun dun dun <br><br>this scene is actually very touching but I'm too tired to write it in a way that makes it sound good so bear with me here.</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with this pic? Because I can't tell at all</br>  <br>You forgot to mention the fact that she's a senior, meaning she's probably older than him.

Is the winning school the only one that advances?</br></br></br>  <br>That's a webm, the finger hook lost its color for a few frames.</br>  I didn't even hear the part that Kumiko was struggling on, and I played band.<br><br>Then again   I played the flute  </br></br>  Which OST do you like more - Amagi, Hyouka or Hibike?<br><br>Hibike OST (by Glaslip composer) is great and fits really well, especially when needing to accent dramatic/emotional scenes.<br><br>Hyouka OST fits the show perfectly<br><br>Amagi OST plays not such huge role, but imho done by best composer of three.

It wasn't about Reina x Kumiko after all.</br></br>  <br>I will punch anyone who says Yuuko is shit now. She is the best friend you could ask for.</br>  <br>  So Mizore finally can talk to Nozomi without freaking out and confronts her on why she left her behind. Nozomi never thought of it as leaving Mizore behind, infact Nozomi didn't want Mizore to lose her chance to play in the tournament by forcing her to leave just because Nozomi had a beef with the seniors. She wanted Mizore to keep playing because she knew Mizore loved music, whether or not Mizore realized that yet herself but she does now thanks to Yuuko. Nozomi wants to apologize for making Mizore feel like crap up until now but Mizore tells her everything is diejoebu. Nozomi then reveals that she went to the concert to see her, that Nozomi has always loved the sound of Mizore's oboe. Also that she'll be at the Kansai tournament tomorrow too. Then Mizore asks Nozomi if she wants to hear her practice her solo and those two leave together. In the end, Nozomi doesn't come back to the club because Asuka still thinks its better safe than sorry just in case Mizore freaks out again. MIzore dedicates her solo to Nozomi and everything ends out great <br><br>the end  except I skipped most of the actual earlier details like how Kumiko talked to Nozomi at the pool, and how she talked to Mizore at night at band camp but you ge the idea </br></br></br>  <br>She's just going to bed, anon.</br>  <br>Missed your other posts, I don't mind a yes or a no. Does the Rikka girl get more screen time in the future?</br>  <br>Maybe she's in the JSDF, and that's when she always wakes up.</br>    <br>Also does this Christmas Cake have any plot relevance later on as well?</br>  Why were the other schools celebrating if they didn't win gold?  <br>She's way beyond cake.</br>  <br>They're simply under very bright light.</br>  <br>Holyshit this is so gay.</br>  <br>Because not everyone is a tryhard.</br>  <br><br><br>They're happy for kitauji.</br></br></br>  <br>Plus she's three feet tall there, I think.</br>  <br><br>She wears a wedding ring.</br></br>  <br>Silver and bronze got  coupon at WcDonald's .</br>  <br>I just typed up a summary of volume 2 and you could honestly leave out Kumiko and Reina from the whole thing. Kumiko was just an observer for most of this anyway. I shutter to think about how little Hazuki and Midori get shafted.</br>  <br>I'm so happy for you Oboe-chan. You deserve this ending.</br>  <br>Hyouka doesn't have enough source material for another season. Hibike does.</br>  <br>Nichijou.</br>  <br>cute</br>  <br>Haruka is really feeling it!</br>  Piccolo chan is CUTE, I don't know what type of braid is that, but it's lovely.  <br>Literally a semen demon.</br>    <br>Thanks novelanon. Did you post any other spoilers besides the Asuka and Oboe backstories?</br>  <br>Brilliant. <br><br><br>Fucking Asuka. Such a communist.</br></br></br></br>   brass <br><br>Real men play guitars.</br></br>  <br> Christmas Cake <br>She's like 50 or something.</br></br>    <br>Asuka is still a big deal<br><br>the main four girls of the actual plot are Mizore, Nozomi, Natsuki and Yuuko. <br><br>Kumiko is there as our PoV MC, Reina is off a mile away stalking Taki sensei, and Hazuki and Midori are somewhere in the distance.<br><br>Haruka and Kaori aren't important ever</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Real men play guitars well.<br><br>So like maybe .5% of guitarists are real men.</br></br></br>  <br>The source material is just going downfall and inferior to the first season<br><br> it was a good ride.</br></br></br>  <br>Gosh when Reina plays that beautiful solo I cried a little too. It is soo beautiful<br><br>Them winning not even made me shed a tear even a little</br></br></br>  <br>Wanna bully a clarinet?</br>  Jesus has returned! Hallelujah!  <br>the sun already came up while I was typing this, I'm writing to the end!</br>  <br>it's a pretty easy read, the author purposely wrote it to be easy to understand so her friends would read her stuff.<br><br>Kitauji got gold, not dud gold like in episode 1 but actual gold. You get ranked gold silver copper based on your performance and only a select number of gold can make it through to the next tournament.</br></br></br>  <br>    to hear her practice her solo <br>   "hear" "practice" "her solo" <br>Is this how they call it these days?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you novelanon. Now get some well earned sleep.</br>  <br>Yes I love that part. I'm glad someone made this.</br>  <br>She looks better with that bow.</br>    <br>look at the webm, the color's just too contrast for light effect.</br>  <br>Did anyone else bawl like little bitch when the ending credits came in?</br>  <br> So then steps in Yuuko, who has been Mizore's friend since middleschool and has been looking after her this whole time <br><br>Do you know how difficult it is to keep updating my best girl list?</br></br></br>  <br> Is this how they call it these days? <br>Yeah. That sounds... sexy. A little too strange... Oh well, whatever that makes them happy.</br></br>  <br>Because they did get gold, only dud golds. The real gold winner or winners, not sure, was announced later by the judge.</br>  <br>Do we at least get a mention of what the seniors do after they graduate?</br>    <br>backalley</br>  <br>I need to reread her parts but yes she does get a minor scene of relevancy where she calls Kumiko the night before Kansai and tells Kumiko to find her at the tournament. I don't think Azusa is enjoying herself very much. The novel doesn't go any further into it but it seems like they're setting up for some original s2 drama. Because they showed wayyy too many Azusa shots in the ending.</br>  <br>Not much?</br>  <br>She's so fiercely loyal. That could be overwhelming but also really nice to know someone actually has your back 100%.</br>  <br>Stop projecting.</br>  <br>so thats why Oboe-chan the only one doesnt smile<br> ;_; </br></br>  <br>Asuka, Oboe and Taki Lovestory are all I wrote so far. <br><br>Taki Love Story<br> &gt;Taki sensei's wife is a former student and band member of Kitauji<br> She was also Taki's dad's former student <br> She never took gold though at Nationals though <br> Taki and his wife met in college at the music club <br> cue Everybody Loves Somebody <br> Taki's wife becomes a teacher at another school and their band adviser, Taki is also a teacher but avoids band due to hating his dad <br> Wife is too gentle though so the club never get good <br> cue Clannaids, wife dies of illness <br> Taki goes into mourning for a few years, so depressed he can't even touch instruments.  <br> Taki dad tells him to get off his ass  <br> Taki sensei gets assigned to Kitauji because his dad used to work there <br> Taki's wife's dream was that her Kitauji would one day get gold <br> Taki sees this as a chance to fulfill his wife's dream <br> cue Hibike! Euphonium volume 1 <br> skip to volume 2! <br> during the 2nd novel, Taki asks his college friends Hashimoto and Niiya to help advise  <br> Hashimoto immediately figures out that Reina is in love with Taki sensei and asks Kumiko about it, calls Taki a sleaze to Kumiko <br> Hashimoto then asks Kumiko how Taki has been, because Taki hasn't talked to Hashimoto much since his wife died which Kumiko now learns about. <br> During volume 3, Kumiko sees Taki sensei wearing his wedding band, turns out to be the anniversary of his wife's death <br> later with his tuxedo on, Taki visits his wife's grave during a typhoon with the same boquet Italian whites which he used to propose to her <br> in flower language they mean "I will always remember you" <br> Kumiko sees the picture of Taki sensei's wife's photo on his desk, reveals she knows about her to Taki, tells Taki that Hashimoto told her when asked how <br> Taki sensei then tells Kumiko all about his wife in a very loving and cathartic section <br> Reina finds out in the same way later <br> They get copper at Nationals, better luck next year? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit you can tell the diference between a light novel and an actual novel. There's enough plot in vol2 to make 10 light novel volumes</br>  <br>Kyoani sure know how to pick title huh</br>  <br> &gt;Taki sees this as a chance to fulfill his wife's dream <br> &gt;They get copper at Nationals, better luck next year? </br></br>  Is anon going to finish this picture?<br><br><br>Pure sex. No wonder Shuichi is so keen on her.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;They get copper at Nationals, better luck next year? </br>   tfw s2 never <br>Bit conflicted about this tbh. I liked Hibike so far but a full 26 ep season might have turned out a drag.<br>What do I watch next?</br></br>  <br> &gt;later with his tuxedo on, Taki visits his wife's grave during a typhoon with the same boquet Italian whites which he used to propose to her<br> in flower language they mean "I will always remember you" </br> <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>and just to round everything off, here are the Asuka spoilers because everything must be spoiled</br>  <br><br>Do you seriously expect a slacker school to get gold after only one year of taking band seriously? This isn't a shonen where friendship guarantees victory</br></br>  <br>isnt it light novel?</br>    <br>I personally don't. It's just after that solo. The melodies. It's.. touching</br>  <br>it's funny because this series is only 4 volumes long</br>  <br>its already stretching though they can even made it to nationals</br>  <br>Novels are usually much shorter</br>  <br><br>Asuka is best. Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>So Vol 4 spoilers after you sleep novel anon?</br>  <br>Stop crying and get your shit together ribbons you're in charge next year. Make gold happen.</br>  <br>volume 4 is just sidestories, and you already know the infamous Shuuichi one. Maybe I'll type up the school festival one later.<br><br>Anyway sleep time I guess, and time to retire this trip</br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy, I just realized it means her and Asuka will never ever win the gold. Now I feel bad for them.</br>  <br>So if we do get a second season, Reina will basically become as irrelevant as Midori and Hazuki?</br>  <br>Wait... so vol 2 is about the 2nd years, vol 3 is about Asuka, and vol 4 is random short stories?<br><br>Anything interesting from vol 4 besides Shuu1 and Kumiko getting together?</br></br></br>  <br>Since people like her she will probably just be Kumiko's shadow.</br>  <br>she already get enough screentime this season anon</br>  <br>At least their final year was better than anything they could have hoped for during the year before.</br>  Make vol. 2 a second season<br>Vol. 3 a movie<br>and Vol. 4 a set of OVAs and specials.</br></br>  <br>every studio should follow kyoani example adapting everything faithfully</br>  <br>Yeah, they went from seeing the band almost fall apart to what it is now. That must have been great to see in the end.</br>  Hold on to your dicks.  <br>I can't tell if this is sarcasm</br>    <br>d-did i miss something?</br>  I'm going to miss this show.  <br><br><br><br>Thanks Novelanon.

And don't tell me magnets.</br></br>  <br>write a letter to the author and ask him about it</br>  To increase the anguish let's list all the things that need to happen before the manga reaches its conclusion..<br><br>Guts needs to go through the elf island arc and probably fight the elf island boss, whoever and whatever that is.<br><br>After that and a probable power upgrade he needs to defeat all of Griffith's apostles, and since they all look formidable each one of them would probably get their own arc where they're the boss character.<br><br>Once they're dealt with we need to see Griffith taken on along with the Godhand. Again, since each one of them looks quite formidable they'd get their own arc where they get defeated as the boss of that arc with Femto as the last one standing.<br><br>So that right there are about 10 arcs or so just for those major characters, without counting in random assholes and monsters Guts might come across while traveling/reaching the major assholes.<br><br>And then of course we have Griffith/Femto's "I was pretending all along" master plan where it turns out he was doing what he was doing to defeat an ancient evil and so on so another final boss battle at the end.<br><br>Even if we condense all this into 2-3 arcs where all the apostles get dealt with in one arc and all of the godhand in another it's still way beyond any scope Miura can possibly deliver within his lifetime.<br><br>That's probably why he gave up. He overextended himself.<br><br>Same thing happened to the guy who did Bastard! and to the guy that did Alita.<br>They both kept writing their magnum opus until they got tired of it or it became so bloated nobody cares really since no end is in sight.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> And don't tell me magnets. <br> It's the magnets. </br></br>  <br>You know it is magnets.</br>  <br>I don't know what this means<br><br><br>Do it! I loved the anime, great soundtrack, great character development, great everything. I'm about to start the manga and then I'll watch the CGI movies as well.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>If it were in fact magnets, then the force holding the hand to the steel sword would have to be so great that separating the two would impossible.</br></br></br>   I better get this story wrapped up since it's taking way too long <br><br> chapter devoted to some lolis bathing <br> chapter devoted to Griffith standing in a flowery field with every flower rendered perfectly <br> unrelated story where a loli pees on some lughead to give him refreshment </br></br></br></br>  I watched berserk tonight with my mom not even making that up.   you will never see Guts defeat Femto and then go into berserker rage and rape his ass in front of the godhand   <br>This guy gets it. You can't even interact with him unlike fans of GRRM do.</br>  <br> unrelated story where a loli pees on some lughead to give him refreshment <br>I only sporadically join Berserk threads, I bet that Piss Wizard comic got posted all the time.</br></br>   you'll never see the skull knight slice Void's brain head in half <br><br>you just know it would happen sooner or later</br></br>  <br><br>Considering Berserk is never getting finished I'd rather Miura do more one-shots like that since I really like his artwork.</br></br>  <br> we've seen nothing of Skull Knight after Femto bamboozled him into unleashing even more monsters into the world <br><br>that's gotta burn, spent all that time on something the Godhand saw coming and based their plans on.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Given the rather tropey nature of the entire thing I'm thinking that Griffith deliberately orchestrated the merging of the planes so that the evil entities could be given physical form and harmed by combat.<br>He knows Guts will slice em all up sooner or later and in the end the two of them will somehow take down the idea of evil as well.<br><br>basically Griffith needed to ensure he's dismantling the bad guys from within so he's pretending to be evil</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gigantomachia, I think.</br>  <br><br>Thats stupid horse shit. Griffith wants his own kingdom, nothing more.</br></br>  <br>Miura, pls no.</br>  <br>http://www.mangareader.net/gigantom<wbr>akhia</wbr></br>  <br><br>You know it's gonna happen.<br>Search your feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know what Griffith's plans are now, we haven't really seen what he's been thinking since the Eclipse. All we've seen of him and the Godhand are them setting up for Falconia's return. Who knows what they're ultimately planning?<br><br>Sides, I'd argue that becoming part of the Godhand was the ultimate fulfillment of his 'own kingdom' wish anyway. Now he's up to something else.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Griffith is vain incarnate.<br><br>He saw that the Godhand are above him so he joined them but by no means is he playing their game and it's completely contrary to his character to be working for some giant evil heart with no choice in the matter.<br><br>You can bet your ass he's working it from the inside to come out on top somehow or at the very least fuck up whoever is above him.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wrong, best ending coming through<br> some unnecessary boat shit happens <br> Oh shit, Griffith's here  <br> But wait, Skull King gives Guts an amalgamation of behelits, causing another eclipse <br> Guts uses this opportunity to ask for his wish to be granted <br> His wish is to turn Griffith into a woman, who will then be married and subservient to Guts after he rapes her <br> Guts has successfully raped Griffith back at the same time as stealing his entire kingdom, because women can't rule </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah sure that makes sense, but I don't think he would be trying to do it for "good" reasons.</br>  <br>Dude he isnt Griffith anymore, hes Femto. Whatever shred of good was in Griffith is gone, his soul is corrupted and now serves the idea of evil.<br>The Godhand tricked him into believing the only way he could achieve his dream was by betraying everyone, therefore claiming his soul. Just like all the demons before him.<br><br>Did you even read Berserk?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I know youre a raging Griffith fanboy but relax with the stupid fanfic</br>  <br>Its a nip comic where demons and islands with teeth exist, i wouldn't think on it too hard</br>  <br>Mozgus is funny</br>  <br>It's obviously an electromagnet that is turned on when the dragonslayer is placed in the grip.</br>  <br>idolm@ster</br>  <br> he lied on the internet </br>  <br>Complete creative burnout. It's why he does silly things like spend inordinate amounts of effort on drawing shit like vases, why the pissing loli manga was so mediocre, and why the plot in Berserk has really gone nowhere since Guts finally got on the boat. I think he needs a shock to his system, like a few months traveling overseas. I think that's one of the reasons why Araki has managed to keep things so fresh.</br>  I mean, seriously. Griffith is a fucking background object to this vase.  <br>Not him but I actually did show Berserk to both my parents individually and even had my 68 year old father read the entire fucking manga. Now he's on the boat with the rest of us.</br>  <br>quick someone go take hostage of his idolmaster.</br>    <br>is there any other manga that puts same detail into its pages</br>    <br>I'm pretty happy I watched the dub of Berserk. I can hear Griffiths voice in my head when he talks, and its so fitting to the character</br>  If Miura ever kicks the bucket, I hope they bring this guy back to do the art.  How the hell does Muira make his living???    <br>The Berserk dub is really good. Marc Diraison's voice has become inseparable from Guts in my mind. The dub is excellent overall. The only character's voice I have a problem with is Gaston's because whenever I hear Sean Schemmel's voice, no matter the role, all I hear is Goku.</br>  <br> his work sold more than 30 millions <br>I fucking wonder anon.</br></br>  Could Takehiko Inoue finish Berserk if Miura dies prematurely?  <br>I thought I heard Goku's voice! I actually didn't mind it and was just kind of like "Hey its Goku" And yeah Guts' voice is great too. How are the movies? Is it the same voice actors?</br>    <br>All the key voice actors reprise their roles and sound better than ever in my opinion even though the movies abridge (butcher) the story.</br>    <br><br>Just to clarify, I do think the movies are worth watching at least once if you're a hardcore fan of Berserk. The movies are like seeing the same story from a different perspective, so they're interesting.</br></br>  <br>I'll probably get around to watching them even though I heard they are awful. Maybe might watch that Redux version</br>  <br><br>Actually, I've got time tonight I'll watch the first one now. I'll let you anons know what I thought about it</br></br>  <br>Kaoru Mori and Sui Kasai tend to get obsessive about detail, particularly with cloth, but they don't go haywire in every panel like Miura tends to, probably because they actually have to publish to put food on the table.<br><br>I kinda wonder what would happen if Miura recalibrated his brain and did something along the lines of Gisele Alain, maybe starring Rickert.</br></br></br>  Oh and I'd put Vinland Saga up there in terms of detail and in terms of probably never fucking ending, too.    Reminder that if Miura wont give us new chapter, autistic mods can delete berserk threads aswell  <br>Pretty sick colour work<br>Although i always imagined Grunbled would be blue like Seath the Scaleless</br></br>  <br><br>For me the story ended.<br>I enjoy it as something that is somewhat complete and done and i also imagined an ending for it.</br></br></br>  I just want more introspective/unstable Farnese. She's at her beast when she's confused.  <br>Don't be harsh on autistic people, they can't change the way they are.</br>  Anyone remember this shit?  <br> She's at her beast </br>  <br>One of the best Dreamcast games, here's hoping Fromsoftware gets to make the next Berserk game</br>  If you guys had to estimate how close we are to the end what would you say? 80%?  UGHHHHH<br><br>tbh i don't even care anymore<br><br>i haven't read a chapter in 8 friggin months, might as well not even exist</br></br></br></br>  <br>Let me explain to you why the wait is so long.<br><br>You see, Miura died 10 years ago but due to a life unfulfilled was cast into purgatory with one task: finish Berserk and you will be allowed into heaven.<br><br>However, after years of struggling against his own laziness and habits he became bitter at the whole ordeal. He changed the plot and put the cast on the boat.<br><br>The reason for the change is obvious, the boat is a message to the readers: "Do not lose the momentum in your life and fall to apathy as I did." Guts and friends are never getting off the boat, because just like Miura, they are trapped; because the boat is purgatory.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Based on the amount of loose ends we currently still have, I'd guess closer to 70%.</br>  <br>Fan guesses of completion could be anywhere, but knowing Miura, he could take the story in a completely new direction on a whim, because there's so much unresolved shit going on in the plot. it doesn't matter anyway because the future is dark.</br>  Say what you will about the movies, I absolutely adore the female character designs. They have this soft, fleshy look to them.  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Slan in particular is positively delicious.</br>  <br> implying  <br><br>dude can't even finish his own shit</br></br></br>  <br> so great that separating the two would impossible <br><br>Maybe Guts doesn't have little bitch arms like you do?</br></br></br>  <br> dark souls berserk meem <br><br>Stop<br>They are completely different. Just because Dark Souls has references to Berserk doesnt mean its the same shit. From are awful at cinematics and they arent known for character development. A Berserk game would be extremely plot and dialogue heavy. From cant even animate fucking mouths for shit sake</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Shut the fuck up Griffith apologist, you shit up every thread.</br></br>  <br>60 70<br><br>Still at least another 10 volumes to go in my opinion</br></br></br>  Not going to lie I kinda gave up after Guts found Casca again.<br><br>Whats the tl;dr on what I missed? At least tell me she is normal again.</br></br>  <br>You missed a lot of good shit and a lot of bad. You really should read it yourself since it doesn't hit the bad until Guts steps on the boat which is like in volume 32 or something.  She's not. </br>  <br>The most important part is swinging the sword, From is really good at letting you swing big ass swords.</br>  <br>No but were so close it might even happen next chapter<br><br>Its why i want the new chapter so bad<br><br>I want Guts to be happy again ;_;</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>she's not</br>  Berserk thread went over 100+<br><br><br>Wow</br></br></br>  Is Berserk essential cuckcore?  <br>OP here. It was all me.</br>  <br>Slan is one of the few things that the movie actually does better than either the manga or anime. I was happy with the previous iterations of her character but the movie design is an improvement in every way.</br>  <br> dark souls berserk meem <br>Who said anything about Dark Souls? I just meant seeing as how From's parent company has the right for a Berserk game they should at least use them<br><br> they arent known for character development. <br>True but they already have proved to be at the very least competent at making a hack and slash game</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yes</br>  <br> platinum </br>  <br>I'm replaying 1 and 2 after finishing the anime actually and just running around two handing the biggest swords I can find. It is quite satisfying.</br>  <br>Great Job!</br>  <br>They have an entire scene dedicated to it. What do you think?</br>  <br>Judeau was a born cuck as well.</br>  <br> he has an obligation to at least give us an ending and not just abandoning it <br><br>Fucking this x 1000000</br></br></br>  <br>And Serpico, come to think of it. Shit, even Caska gets cucked by some old man.</br>  <br>The scale of it seems frightening, I agree<br><br> we have Griffith/Femto's "I was pretending all along" master plan where it turns out he was doing what he was doing to defeat an ancient evil <br><br>No. Just...No.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not the same fucking thing.<br><br>Imagine that kinda scene in e.g. Star Wars<br>"Why didn't Han pull up the Leia when she was falling...?"<br>"It's a movie with space wizards and plasma swords, I wouldn't think on it too hard"</br></br></br></br></br>  Well I just finished the 1st movie. Overall I'm pretty disappointed. Shit CG and I feel like there was way too much left out. Like Guts going from an arrogant ass to finally becoming friendly with the Band, and the plotting to assassinate Griffith. I did like the scenes that they actually animated well though.  <br>It was because he is losing his bodily functions from the armor draining his lifeforce<br>He was fucking tired and pulling someone out of the ocean while on a moving boat isnt exactly easy ok m8<br><br>The magnets are probably activated when the fingers clasp around the hilt<br><br>Happy?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What did you imagine anon-kun uguu?</br>  <br>You should still watch the others though. The duel between Guts and Griffith in the second movie is pretty well done and the entire Eclipse is interesting. Not perfect, but interesting.</br>  <br>Holy retarded shit Batman!</br>  Muira's inspiration is Hirasawa's songs.<br><br>Muira is the best mangaka by default.</br></br>  <br>I'll probably watch them tomorrow, don't have the time to tonight. I do feel like Griffith's eventual decent into evil was being foreshadowed harder in the movie than it was in the anime. Maybe I am just forgetting, but it seemed more subtle in the anime from what I remember.</br>  Will his chin ever stop growing?  <br>I dont know why but that post cracked me the hell up</br>  <br>Ok, let's say he was tired, it's not like it's the first illogical thing in the manga<br><br> The magnets are probably activated when the fingers clasp around the hilt <br>Listen, either they have magnetism or they don't, It's not an electromagnet.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Its magic i dont gotta explain shit :^)</br>   Guts will never get away from the group of children <br> Guts' story will never be about suffering and despair again and will always be about love and friendship with a magic loli and a shota <br>my interested went downhill when the children appeared and stayed for good.</br></br>  <br>ever the berserker armor has some magic shit going on, why would ppl fixate on the hand</br>  <br>It was for fucking dramatic storytelling jesus christ<br>Something interesting had to happen while on that tub</br></br>  <br>Mmh now that is interesting</br>  <br>Theyll all die soon dont worry<br>People that get close to guts have a habit of.. dying<br>Also Skelly bro tells Guts his destiny is to suffer loss again and again. So they all ded</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, now I won't waste my time on the movies...for now</br>  <br>The older he gets the more he looks like Dolph Lundgren</br>  <br>no they won't, unless he decides to kill everyone together<br>people don't have a habit of dying anymore either, since loli mage put a plot device on him so monsters don't appear</br></br>  <br>hey fuck you nigga Gigantomachia was fucking cool, i wish there were more</br>  <br>the loli parts were cool but otherwise who cared</br>  Daily reminder  Elves will get Guts' artificial arm upgraded to a bionic.<br>They'll upgrade his armor so it doesn't drain him.<br>They will cure Casca.<br> probably not </br></br></br>  <br>never forget the gore in the berserk</br>  <br>elves are dead and the only thing left is ruins.</br>  <br>she's at her beast when she's horny to guts</br>  horny farnese is the best Farnese  <br>WAIT NO<br>A VISION HAS COME UPON ME<br><br>ELVES ARE DEAD...<br><br>...BECAUSE GRIFFITH KILLED THEM!<br><br>GUTS STEPS OFF BOAT, IMMEDIATELY FIGHTS GRIFFITH WHO HAD FLOWN UP ON ZOD<br><br>GUTS AND GRIFFITH KILL EACH OTHER<br><br>SURVIVORS RECONVENE, SOME BULLSHIT ABOUT 'THE OTHER APOSTLES ARE STILL OUT THERE BUT NOW WE KNOW, THEY CAN BE BEATEN, IF ONLY YOU HAVE THE GUTS'<br><br>ROLL CREDITS+SUNSET</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    I dont get it. I thought Berserk was still popular? So why arent we getting any new fucking movies or Anime? Ive given up on Miura beating his iDOLM@STER addiction and finishing the manga so I at least want everything after the Golden Age arc animated. We at least deserve that for putting up with this bullshit.<br><br> You will never see the best arc aka the Tower of Conviction arc animated <br><br>Fucking hurts.</br></br></br></br>    <br> if only you have the guts <br><br>Plz no papa Miura</br></br></br>  Never Forget this horny Farnese  <br>I'm curious, does /a/ hate Shierke?</br>  <br>Why did this even happen?</br>  <br/>  <br>She was possesed</br>  <br>Nvm, this answered it...</br>  <br>She's kinda flouted as the poster girl for the change berserk went through, but I don't hold her responsible<br><br>I liked old berserk more but I like new berserk too, just in different ways<br><br>Shierke feels out of place to me but that's really just because my brain will always be stuck in the first 1/2 or so, from Band of the Hawk time to when Guts was still wandering alone chopping demons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I actually don't mind Schierke. She's not a bad character and has at least some semblance of emotional depth. This little shit however...</br>  <br> Gatts </br>  <br>Vol 14-24 have the best Guts</br>  <br>Almost as bad as Band of the Falcon.</br>  <br>This. Guts is one handsome motherfucker during that part.</br>  <br><br>Agree. I think it has something to do with the fact that Miura suddenly decided to start outlining his upper lip somewhere around volume 27 and his jaw stretching out from a more stylize manga proportions to more realistic (ugly) proportions as previously stated.</br></br>  <br>he relented on that later on, though.</br>  Here's a question. What was the point of the flashback chapters in volume 37? Why did Miura feel the need to force in the little flower elf? It's kind of a big deal because it means that Puck is actually not the first elf Guts had ever encountered. I'm assuming Miura must have had a good reason to go back and add this because Guts' history was just fine as it was and there was no apparent need to do so. Is it going to relate to Elf island in some way? Also, when is The Count's daughter going to come back for her revenge?  <br> Also, when is The Count's daughter going to come back for her revenge? <br><br>You don't get it? It's okay I'll explain it to you:<br><br> Count's daughter is Skull Knight </br></br></br></br></br>  Which Berserk girl has the best tits and why is it Isma?  <br>I don't think Ishidro is a bad character. I like him</br>  <br>He met skull knight before he met the counts daughter you autist</br>  Can someone tell me what the fuck this is? I cant read moon runes  <br>I knew fapping to him wasn't REALLY gay!</br>  <br>All apart of her plan.</br>  <br><br>Exactly? Count's daughter becomes Skull Knight and goes back in time to get revenge on Guts using powerful magics.<br><br>Skull Knights behelit sword proves this, she has already used it once to go back in time. checkmate</br></br></br></br>  <br>And Judeau is actually Isidoro right</br>  <br><br>Derp</br></br>  <br>Date sim. Pay 3 silver pieces to spend the night ploughing your rod into some nice tight buns.</br>  <br>Ok but the real question is  who is Bag? </br>  Just look at the miserable state of this thread. This is what being deprived of Berserk for so long is doing to us. We're delirious.  <br>If it never comes back, there are worse places it could have stopped.</br>  <br>I sat there with the biggest grin on my face first time reading that<br><br>Not because lol boobs but man.. thats literally the only true happiness Guts has ever felt<br><br> when Guts spills the rape story to Casca and says "ill just go now", and casca hugs him <br><br>Muh heart</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Bag-kun is Griffiths reincarnation</br></br>  <br>Griffith is a self centered douchebag and always was.<br><br>Griffith apologists are literally ultra space Nazis</br></br></br>  <br> i hated how they removed that scene from the movies</br>  <br>If Miura dies I will spend good money to make one of these "Griffith gets fucked" comics happen.</br>    does anyone have a chart like this but for berserk?  Why does Zodd think he's a match for Skull Knight when he only ever got ass raped by him whenever they fought? How fucking delusional is this guy?  <br>Well.. he is Immortal</br>  <br>Doubt it. If Skullknight decided to get serious during one of their encounters, he could shred Zodd to a thousand tiny pieces in a flash. I'd like to see him regenerate from that. He's not even a match for Guts at this point.</br>  <br>I doubt that<br>Also skelly and zodd are evenly matched, theyve been fighting for hundreds of years.<br><br>Anyway i have a request<br>Its a drawing of Guts in his berserker armor with Casca all cured embracing each other<br>Cant find it on google<br>I need it for reasons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Serpico <br> adult <br> male <br> has completed his character arc <br><br>He's is going to be the first to go.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I got you nig</br>  <br>Thanks dude!</br>  <br> outlining his upper lip <br><br>This. Big mistake.</br></br></br>  <br> Also skelly and zodd are evenly matched <br><br>Not even close, Skully is always going easy on him.<br><br>When he decided to actually break into the eclipse after playing with Zodd he had his entire arm lopped off</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But dont forget to mask it as idolmaster question.</br>  I want a picture of "Star Wars Guts"; with bionic arm with integrated blaster and (bigger than ususal) lightsaber. Purple lightsaber. Like a dark Jedi or some shit.<br> inb4 'or some Sith' puns </br>  Cant he just fucking tell someone how he plans to end it and they make animation out of it. I dont fucking care about artstyle if never plans to draw it.  <br>why do you hate your father?</br>  <br><br>Because his father is 68 years old and now won't be able to die till Berserk finishes.<br><br>Bless that anon for granting him immortality.<br><br>Now think of all the anons who died while waiting for Guts to get off the boat.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Only 10 years <br>Small time</br></br>  <br>You're actually not too far off. My father is in poor health and I don't know how much longer he has left. I wanted to share Berserk with him before he died because I knew that if I didn't, I'd regret it for the rest of my life.</br>  <br> fucking metal</br>  <br> another 10 years to develop the game </br>  <br>Nah, the apostles can be put into less arcs with Guts taking more than 1 apostle on at the time, especially since he has the berserk armor and his rpg party it seems more likely that the only ones that would need an arc are the dragon dude and zodd</br>  Are there any modern interviews with Miura that mention berserk? I wouldn't even know how to find a japanese magazine archive for something like that. When he does them, do you think he refuses to answer questions about it for his other work?  when did they get on the boat?  <br>I feel kinda awful that by now, I simply can't give a fuck anymore. Nothing fucking happens even when Miura draws a few chapters. And it seems like he's drawing less and less.</br>  <br>Or he can just give Griffith the anti-hero persona who actually saves all the people and they live in harmony with apostles, and let Guts and Caska live on elf island. It would take only 1 arc.</br>  <br> Griffith anti-hero persona <br> loved by people <br> Guts kills him anyway <br> everyone hates him and he ends up alone wanted nowhere </br></br></br></br>  Might as well re-read golden age again, the last chapters of that arc are dope in how it slowly breaks off from medieval politics and turns into dark fantasy fighting demons and shit  <br> Rickert slapped Griffith </br>  <br>So I guess we can pretend it's over right?</br>  <br>Surely Griffith, having learned the error of his ways, will dismiss all the apostles and other monsters back to the astral world and he will go be pals with Guts again like the good old times. Guts may be a little resistant at first considering the whole raping Caska retarded thing but he sees that that's pretty much all water under the bridge at this point and they all live happily ever after. The end.</br>  I lost interest after The Golden Age arc because all of the manga scans I could find were really terrible translations and I don't know if it's worth the effort for the heartbreak of never getting an ending.  <br>... who ?</br>  Best apostle.  <br> not buying tanks and reading them while taking a dump </br>  <br>No godfuckingdammit, that would be lazy writing 101</br>  <br>the black ghost is the best apostle. this is fact. miura said so. "best apostle is that ghost guy, can't remember his name." but 'know, in japanese</br>  <br>Would lazy writing be better than no writing?</br>  <br>No, he said that best apostle was Skull knight that's why he is so important in the story and that Zodd was his second favorite. That's why he decided to draw him feline like, his first intention was to have face similar to that of bat.<br>Nosferatu-bat.<br>POTTERY<br>O<br>T<br>T<br>E<br>R<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If it would end that fucking shitty way, then yes.<br>Eventually someone would finish it.<br>Griffith is BBEG and that's a state of the matter. You can't have an epic with such shitty ending, even G.R.R. Martin wouldn't do that.</br></br></br>  <br>They were evenly matched for hundreds of years, but now that the behelit sword is complete, I think  is right. If they really go at it now, Skelly would win.</br>  <br> They were evenly matched for hundreds of years <br><br>I'm not sure even this is true. Skully doesn't even consider Zodd a true enemy, he's going directly after the GOD-HAND nevermind a single apostle.</br></br></br>  <br>2007</br>    <br> 8 years on the boat  <br>Imagine how hot grown up Schierke is now<br><br>cant fucking wait</br></br></br></br>  <br>Miura's inspiration is Chihaya's songs.<br><br>Miura is the best mangaka by default.</br></br></br>  <br>Miura said the manga is 70% done</br>  <br>As if she could get hotter.</br>  <br>Where can I find the cunt? Does he have social media or something? The guy is like a deity that only speaks to his followers when the planets align</br>    Summer 2015 anime season begins in a couple of hours. What are you hype for?  Is mahou org dead for good?  <br>I'm nervous about Ushio and Tora.

So take your advice and kill yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Monogatari and DBZ in the same boogieman <br>What is happening?</br></br>  <br>It's for the girls. Yes. And there is nothing wrong with that. But if you would call any show that centers around the girls Nisekoi then I guess you can keep shitposting forever.</br>  <br>You call me cancer and you complain that anime is weeaboo, you can stop the baiting.</br>  <br>Was danmachi 10 episodes of filler and 2 of plot?<br><br>Stop generalizing, makes you look more retarded than what you already are.</br></br></br>  <br>Then watch 50%, you stupid faggot.

You literally have no reading comprehension.<br><br><br> Watching 15 shows every season that all use the same cliches over and over again <br>You are a legit autist, not even kidding. You aren't watching anime to enjoy it, but only to be able to say that you did. That's autism.

Aside from the cool mystery plot and the Mayan fanyasy setting, there's enough cute girls to keep the shallow ones interested. Is it because of Passione?

Deal with it or don't fucking watch it and leave /a/.</br></br></br>  <br> Same cliches doesn't mean the shows are all the same. <br>Yeah, but it's a good evidence to proof that they are all shit with at most one exception.</br></br>  I'm picking up Chaos Dragon for obvious reasons.  <br>Nobody is forcing you to watch anything you fucktard. <br>If you don't like something, don't watch it. It's not that fucking hard.

My Wife is the Student Council President! stars Izumi Hayato (Okitsu Kazuyuki), who is running for student council president. But when the beautiful Wakana Ui (Taketatsu Ayana) swoops in, promising the liberalization of love and throwing condoms into the audience, Izumi loses and ends up as her vice president. If that wasn’t enough, the newly-elected president ends up inviting herself over to Izumi’s house, and announces that she’s Izumi’s wife, thanks to an agreement—facilitated by alcohol—that their parents made when they were three. Each episode will be ten minutes long.  Ergastulum is a city of petty thieves and powerful mafia families, of sex workers and corrupt cops. It’s a city that casts a grimy shadow over the actions of its citizens, hiding the dirty nature that lies beneath. The streets of Ergastulum are ruled by four gangs: Paulklee, Corsica, Monroe, and Cristiano. Nicolas Brown (Tsuda Kenjirou) and Worwick Arcangelo (Suwabe Junichi) are two jacks-of-all-trades, dealing with the tasks that no one else dares to tackle in this dangerous urban jungle. But this powerful duo find themselves in trouble after they’re asked to deal with a new gang making waves in the territory of one of the top mafia families. Things are never as they seem in the dark alleys of Ergastulum, but this case may be one even they can’t handle.  <br> From the original creator of Chu-Bra!! <br><br>An introduction like that screams irrelevant</br></br></br>  Seems like it'd be easier to list what I'm not going to watch this season:<br>Kaijuu<br>Makura<br>Junjou<br>Hetalia<br>Oh and Dragon Ball.<br><br>On the fence about Million Doll and Venus Project but fuck it, I guess I'll try them as well.<br>So yeah. Shit. That's a lot of shows picked up but it seems like six or seven shows will get dropped like usual.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At that point you might as well pick up those five so you can brag about watching everything on /a/</br>  <br>Each episode would take only 10 min. of your life.</br>  <br>That's ten whole shitposts though</br>  <br>Nah man. There are some things even I can't stomach. Besides, what am I supposed to brag? How infallibly shit my tastes are and how much of a life I lack? I guess you could call that an achievement.</br>  Anyone here read the Gansta manga/novel or whatever? Is it any good? The premise is interesting I guess. I'll keep my eye on it.<br><br>Other than that there's nothing for me on this list right now.</br></br>  <br> How infallibly shit my tastes are and how much of a life I lack <br><br>Isn't that the entire point of this board?</br></br></br>  <br> picking up all the moeshit and fanserviceshit in the world <br> not picking up Dragon Ball <br><br>For what purpose?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's shit</br></br>  <br> Gansta manga <br>it's good and has 0 fjoshit bait.</br></br>  Bikini Warriors, nothing else.  <br><br>This is why you don't ask /a/ for opinions</br></br>  <br>No need to be an insufferable fuck about it, I always say. Why shitpost when I can just jerkoff?<br><br><br>You can try harder than that.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you are on /a/ and people would rather watch cute girls than retarded powerlevel normalfaggotry.</br>  My most anticipated anime of this season.  <br>You did that since the 1960's? I'm impressed.</br>  In order of hype:<br>Gakkou gurashi, NNB, Prison school, Working, Ushio x Tora, Overlord</br>   4 or so shows I want to watch as season starts <br> browse /a/ during the season <br> get caught up in the hype of about another 6-10 shows that deep down I know will be shit <br> download them <br> think they're shit but have potential <br> watch all 24 episodes and they turned out to be shit <br> be disappointed in myself <br> repeat <br><br>Every season without fail. At the moment I know I'm going to watch NNB2, Working 3, Gangsta and Prison School.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's coming out today? And will we get subs within 5 hours?</br>  <br>If you want shit Funi rips then yes.</br>  <br>Gangsta and some student council thing<br><br>Gangsta is picked up by funi so subs should be immediate</br></br></br>   new season <br> pick up around 5 shows <br> after a few weeks I start to slack and the episodes pile up <br> end up not finishing anything <br><br>Every fucking season. <br><br> T-this season will be different right? ;_; </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no need to be an insufferable dick <br><br>What the fuck is this? A reasonable individual?<br>Where am I?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Bizzaro /a/</br>  People should really get some fucking patience and wait a few week so you don't have to go trough that shitty period where nobody knows what groups will pick up and actually complete a series.  <br>Must have slipped into bizzaro /a/ again. Get out of there before it's too late.</br>  <br> 26 <br><br>I usually get 12 every season and I think it's a lot. I don't drop them unless it's really awful, though.</br></br></br>  <br> 26 <br>M8, get another hobby besides animu.</br></br>  Very hyped for Symphogear GX, Classroom Crisis, Wizard Air Academy (Kusen Madoushi) and Venus Project. Will watch most of the rest although I have very little expectations for them.  The Seiyu show looks different, I'll try that. Also, isn't monster girl airing this season?  No one is simulcasting Okusama ga Seito Kaichou right?  <br> isn't monster girl airing this season? <br><br>Yes</br></br></br>  Is Gate good or is it just for /ak/ autists?  <br>Relatively hype tier: Gate, Gods Eater.<br>The manga was better tier: Monster Musume, Kangoku Gakuen.<br>Sound promising tier: Joukamachi no Dantelion, Gakkou Gurashi, Chaos Dragon</br></br></br>  Shit I still haven't seen Symphogear and Working  <br><br>For pedo autists too</br></br>   Shimoseka <br> Prison school <br> Gangsta <br>Most "hyped for"<br><br> Jitsu Wa  <br> Charlotte <br> Overlord <br>I'll have a look at<br><br><br> Aoharu x Kikanjuu <br>Well here goes nothing<br><br> Ore Monogatari <br> SnS <br> Baby Steps <br>Will continie</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God tier:<br>Miss monochrome<br><br>Must watch:<br>Drrr!x2 <br>Himouto!

How could he possibly do anything other than watch anime with such a time consuming amount!</br>  From the chart it seem I'll only thoroughly enjoy DETERMINATION TO FIST<br><br> For the rest, I'll give them 12-episode rule </br></br>  <br>    12-episode rule <br>top kek</br></br>  <br>Well considering a significant amount of anime is 13 episodes or 2 cour it isn't that silly</br>  <br> symphoshit <br>fuck off with your shit taste</br></br>  <br><br> Shimoseka <br>Why would you be hyped for ecchi LN shit by JC Staff?</br></br></br>  <br>Hyped and "Hyped" are very different things.<br>The premise sounds fun</br></br>  <br>Please dont post with reaction image from good show, when you obviously have shit taste. Symphogear is officially one of the worst anime franchizes ever made.</br>  <br> watching a series even if it's complete shit for at the very least 12 episodes <br>Anon, I...</br></br>  <br>fuck you.Symphogear is fun</br>  <br>If its /a/ threads are fun, its worth it. Watching anime is totally not worth it anyway. The joy of anime is 30% the show itself, 20% hype on /a/ and 50% shitposting</br>  <br>Yeah LNs are super interesting and unique and totally not generic</br>  <br>Why not? I've missed really trashy ecchi comedy shows since Nourin.</br>  <br>Again, the synopsis sounds fun.<br>Chill out</br></br>  <br>It's not a rule I have, just saying it could be plausible<br><br>The second last episode sets up the finale. If you can tell that it is just going to be shit, you can drop it then. It also marks the midway point of a 2 cour. You've seen half a season, you know what to expect now. It's a sensible dropping point.<br><br>Personally I just choose shows selectively and never drop them if I pick them up.</br></br></br></br></br>   Ctrl F Wakaba <br>  0 results  <br><br>Surely I'm not the only one interested in this? I mean it doesn't seems like the most original show ever but could make up for a decent SOL nonetheless. Also the main girl obsession with gyaru got me curious.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a sensible dropping point. <br> wasting all the time instead of watching 3-6(max) and know that it's shit or not <br>anon pls</br></br></br>  <br>Just go watch B Gata H key, its better</br>  <br>It just sounds boring to me. I enjoy SOL, but I like it to have at least some kind of quirk.<br><br><br>Sometimes shows start off strongly and then die down. Ore Monogatari is a decent example. it started strong but grew stale. If I was into dropping things I would probably drop it now.</br></br></br></br>  NNB x2<br>Himouto<br>Gangsta<br><br> maybe <br>overlord<br><br> stuff I'm behind but I'd watch <br>prisma loli<br>to love ru</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   people seriously listing Gangsta among the shows they look forward to watch <br>heh, ignorant plebs. Will be fun watching everyone drop it.</br>  When the fuck are we getting the Mushishi movie? It's summer.  <br>I usually try to pick up 7-8 and end up watching 3 and change. Last season I just watched all of Nanoha and ViviD instead, plus Fate and Danna. Everything else was varying shades of "manga was better" and shit.</br>  <br> Will be fun watching everyone drop it. <br><br>yeah just like this season first 3 weeks of ninja slayer DOMO DOMO DOMO, right?<br><br>sure was fun being littered with YEART until everyone dropped it.</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Love Live so much better than Idolm@ster?  REVOLUTION SOON  So where do you guys think Reiji went?  You're scaring the Ruris away Shun, stop it.  why is he so cute? why can't i have one of him<br>PS starting the shun vs sora duel rn, this better live up to the lights out+PJs hype <br>and shun better not job</br></br>  <br>He got caught between dimensions and died.</br>  <br>shun's bedroom</br>  <br>Creating Yliaster so he can fix the dimensions and timelines, or he's off gambling in the tops for bitches.</br>  <br>He's attracting the Ruris towards him if anything.</br>  <br>Nerd doesn't even get to hang with my new cool kids.</br>  <br>Tops City while monitoring the others through Tsukikage.</br>  <br> implying shun won't break down upon seeing all the ruris safe and together </br>  <br> The still shot before the blinding light behind him catches up and explodes him to a billion pieces. <br><br> Cards raining from sky <br> Blackwings </br></br></br></br>  <br> implying shun isn't getting his ass carded by Ruri who is evil as shit which breaks his heart </br>  <br>Shun will finally be able to EGAO for real then.</br>  <br>Has Shun ever actually shown strong desire to keep Ruris beside his own safe? The strongest emotion I remember him showing is getting triggered when they use fusion</br>  <br>that would break my heart too though<br><br> explain to this poor soul what EGAO means </br></br></br>  <br>That's some yubel yandere shit right there, Ruri wants to keep Shun to herself forever.</br>  <br>This is EGAO.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't seem to give two shits about either Yuzu or Serena. The only thing interactions he's really shown is:<br><br> Believing Yuzu to be Ruri and immediately getting gut punched <br> Protecting Serena solely because she protected him <br> Listening to Serena because she said Ruri was likely safe <br><br>Otherwise he gives no crap about the other Ruris, only his Ruri.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  PROTECT ALL RURIS  <br>Yeah, as a card, in her deck. <br><br> He's not her ace </br></br></br>   tfw manlet bird boy doesn't let you break out of jail to find your waifu   YAMEROOOOO    You will never stop Fusion Shun, never.  <br>Don't know but he needs some screen time I need more DDD's.</br>  <br>He'll beat Jack and become Kingu himself and recruit him into the Lancers so he's around all the time.</br>   the real reason Shun learned how to ride a d-wheel   <br>You forgot<br> Went out of his way to watch Yuzu vs Masumi, despite not playing spectator to any other duel during the tournament. </br></br>  D-hhwheel.  <br>Back on Standard watching Netflix.</br>  i've seen a kurosaki win against you before<br>no matter how cute you are this time around i'll be rooting for it to happen again</br>  <br>Planning a new prank for Sawatari in his Synchro Neet Cave</br>  Honestly I want more Yuya thirsty scenes than Shun's Give back Ruri scenes.  DUSTY  <br>GREEN</br>  <br>KAMAITACHI</br>  <br>ENJOY</br>  <br><br>MANJOUME SANDA</br></br>  REEEVERS KARDOO  DUROH  <br>His thirsty scenes are quickly going into "holy shit kid get help" territory. Nigga was about to abandon his friends to go find Yuzu, and even after Crow told him to fuck off he was still all "THIS IS FOR YUZU'S SAKE!"</br>  When willl virtual reality become a thing so I can play cardgames with Ruri?  <br>How is this virtual reality? This is just strapping screens built in a pair of lab goggles on your face.</br>  <br> can barely see through her shirt </br>  <br>You autistic or somethin?</br>  <br> Plot Twist: Reiji's Dimension Mover was actually rerouted ahead of time to send him right back to his NEETcave </br>  <br> dresses like a slut <br> $300 haircut <br> "girlfriend material" <br>Yeah I don't think so.</br></br></br></br>  damn this shun vs sora duel is actually very visually impressive, flight sequence caught me off guard. 8 minutes into episode 34 right now, based shun's traps are awesome  <br> virtual <br> not physically existing as such but made by software to appear to do so <br>By this definition we should be able to touch things in games.</br></br></br>  <br>Hold onto your ass, it's about to get RUM up in here.</br>  <br>I'll be sure to relay your opinion to the people who have been developing VR tech for the past 30 years.<br><br>Hey guys, Anonymous from /a/ says you can't use that term anymore because you can't touch things yet. Shut it down boys, it's over...</br></br></br>  <br>Well he DID go there in the first place for Yuzu and only Yuzu and didn't really give a shit about any other dimension's problems.</br>  <br>Loved that part.</br>  <br> Implying he didn't want any of his friends to get in trouble if they came along with him </br>  <br><br>Yuya becoming Judai</br></br>  <br>sora is legit becoming scary</br>  <br>But the friends of people who escape go to the prison rape cave</br>  <br>ALRIGHT HOLY SHIT SORA WHAT</br>  Xyz focused decks tend to have a lot of traps, Synchro focused decks tend to have a lot of cards that generate tokens and special summoning monster effects. <br><br>Fusion decks need hand generators like poor areas need guns. There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect</br></br>  <br>Does that mean his friends will eventually act like little fuckers towards him, except Gon who will be the Sho at this situation where he forgives Yuya?</br>  <br>Thats if they were involved in any way of the escape plan, so that's why Yuya waned to escape without telling them</br>  <br>this episode has made me homosexual for shun</br>  <br> There should be a new polymerization card that lets you draw cards for each fusion material you use, fusion 2, draw 2 cards,ect <br>Have you seen literally any of the fusion related they've made in the last 3 years? Fuck, that would have been broken when Heroes were the only good fusion deck<br><br><br>They didnt say that, they said that those left behind would take the punishment. They knew who knew who, do you think they'd care about how much involvement they had?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon.<br>Shit was so hype.</br></br>  <br>Fusion Advantage<br>(This card's name is always treated as Polymerization.) Draw 1 for every fusion material used in a fusion summon with this card yadda yadda you guys fucking get it once per turn and all that shit<br><br>Fluffals would love it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>HE DID IT<br>HE WON<br>BASED <br><br>man same here, that was almost ichigo vs byakuya levels of hype</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Welcome the club.</br>  <br>At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. At best, others like Gon and Dennis notice that something's up and are actually helpful.<br><br>Judai's friends excluding Jim and O'Brien directed all their frustration and blame at Judai for how they ended up while not really trying to help the situation themselves because of the marks.</br></br></br>  <br>What I wouldn't give to watch Shun vs Sora again for the first time<br>And you don't even have to wait for the tracks to be released, you fucking prick.</br></br>  We all know Yuya vs Yuri will be the hypest duel  <br> At worst, the other Lancers don't pay much attention to Yuya. <br> tfw nobody knows you're the main character </br></br>  <br>Damn Serena looks big</br>  <br> for you </br>  <br> tfw when I first saw this on the preview I thought she would hug him </br>  <br>Is that a bad thing? In-universe, Yuya's treated as another member of the group like all the others, rather than being the leader with hanger-ons clinging to his heels, and we all know how the latter situation ended up for Judai. For once the rival is the leader (or he's supposed to be).</br>  Guys who says this?   HANASE HANASE    <br>No, it isn't. It's one of the things I liked when I started watching Arc-V, it isn't all about Yuya.<br><br>but it's still sad for poor little tomato</br></br></br>  <br>At this point of time Yuya has the least screen time out of the protagonists, shame since he's my favourite</br>  <br> Summon Blazeman <br> Add this <br> Activate to fuse Blazeman on field and Shadow Mist in hand <br> Draw 2, add a hero with shadow mist effect and make Nova Master or whatever <br>This card is awfully designed</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  Yoshida will come back and restore the peace  </br>  oh shit what yuto vs sora<br>based shun surpassed my expectations, now i just have to count on yuto not jobbing<br>also damn if i didn't expect sora being evil-ish</br></br>  <br>Wait until Violet Flash is an official card since it helps fusion decks reclaim the lost advantage by drawing for each time you fuse alongside the fact that it makes activating fusion/Poly unrespondable to.</br>  <br> Rampant capitalization <br> Bleach </br></br>  <br>I had forgotten about Violet Flash. Yuri can't get an on screen duel fast enough.</br>  <br> Sora was gonna job. He gets his non-jobbing injections later. </br>  <br>I like Bleach too but don't make yourself look like a fucking retard. This is still /a/ we are on, not /dng/.</br>  <br> not /dng/. <br><br>Thank Ra.</br></br></br>  <br>I think it's alright as it is, and I like the kid too. Past Yugioh series could occasionally get annoying about MC doing everything of importance.</br>  <br>GX was very bad about that and nobody will ever surpass the amount of duels Judai had, though I liked Judai, but maybe because the abridged shit gave me a view of him just rapping constantly which somehow fits...</br>  <br>i think one of the reasons why he's so good is because he has such little screentime and the people/relationships around him are fleshed out so well<br><br>i don't spend much time on this board but i guess bleach is one of those triggers on here, i'll shut up about it</br></br></br>  <br>Because Judai actually dueled a rapper in the dub and always talked like he came out of the 90's. I like how his deck now outshines Yusei's in getting out fusions over those synchros.</br>  <br>That's a good thing. Most side characters are treated well in Arc-V. It isn't all about Yuya and that's a thing it has over past series.</br>  Remember when people thought we'd never see Mieru again after her duel or have her cards ever released because it was flip and ritual based?  C A R D I A N S <br>A<br>R<br>D<br>I<br>A<br>N<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who?</br>  <br>M U G E N L O O P U</br>  <br>BUY ALL TWO OF THE CARDIANS THAT WILL GET PRINTED</br>  Son let me tell you about Entermachines  <br>Are you going to lead into an revengence reference?</br>  <br>just bumping</br>  <br>What monster did Hippo set?</br>  Any Ruri figmas out yet?  <br>Only dakimuras.</br>    You just got falsely accused of keeping Ruri captive. Shun has heard the accusation and is advancing on your position. What do you do to prepare?  Can't decide which not-yuya is my favorite, Banana, Tomato, eggplant, ...whatever vegetable/fruit Yuri is.<br><br>still I want Sora to show up again love that guy</br></br>  <br>Buy Raid Raptors and hope I have enough to appease him.</br>  <br>It's called writing a decent main cast</br>  <br>shove him straight into a set of pic related</br>  <br>Prepare Super Poly.</br>  <br>Gekidan Niagara</br>  <br>Yuri is either a Dragon Fruit for the pun or a Plum.</br>  <br>Watch his deck crumble because I don't special summon.</br>  <br>I prepare my  anus </br>  <br>I SUMMON MYSELF<br> steps forward </br></br>  <br>BUY FLUFFALS!</br>  Are Prophecy really so shit they can't hurt anybody? Because I like spellcasters and this is an xyz focused deck.  <br>You can probably fine tune it, but for the most part yes, Prophecy is shit.</br>  <br>They are? I remember people bitching about how broken they were. What happened. flat out outclassed by later sets or ban listed fucked them up good?</br>  <br>Isn't that banned though?</br>    <br>Banlist happened</br>  <br>Miami is in America ;)</br>  <br>And now, the only way they'll be back is if the power gap grows enough to make them a non-threat, their banned cards get an errata that shits all over them or Konami prints more xyz monsters for them like a rank 4 and 3. Sadly, there are no more of the arcana to adapt so they fucked up the ying yang.</br>  <br>This is maiami city tho ;)</br>  <br>We wont be seeing them again unless they start fucking with the power gap too much with Pendulum, which is a possibility, but I doubt it, since it seems they're making efforts to have all the summoning methods relatively balanced as best they can.</br>  <br>Cept fusion, synchro and ritual need a really big fucking buff to keep up with xyz and pendulum.</br>  Xyz is too weak right now it needs This card printed.  <br>Well fusion looks like it's starting to get individualized cards for everything. Ritual they almost never pay attention to outside of Black Luster and Nekroz, and Synchro, Synchro just needs better effects I think. <br><br>By next year I expect due to Pendulum and all the Rank 4 Xyzs that a lot of cards are going to get banned due to dumbass combos. <br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if the next summoning method will be like Pendulum Xyz/Synchro/Fusion where we'll get Synchro/Xyz and stuff like Synchros with Overlay Unit effects and all sorts of things. Could be neat.</br></br></br></br></br>  1 week and 4 days until KINGU.  <br>Chojiro will become a Cardian himself in a way  once he gets carded </br>  <br>Bad Shun, bad!</br>  <br>I mean, it's neat to see an ossan be part of the group, even if briefly, but at the same time it feels like he's just gonna die or be sacrificed in some way.</br>  <br>Fusion needs a Miracle Fusion that's not exclusive to Heroes, some way to off set that -2,more cards that fuse based on type and attribute rather than names and if they do continue that shitty trend the name material l monsters need to have effects that are worth it. <br><br>synchros need far more level 5, 6,7 and 8 synchros, <br><br>Rituals need ritual monsters and spells that can actually do shit more than ritual summon the monster and all ritual monsters should have built in protection from spells,traps, monster effects. <br><br>These 3 have a lot of work to do before they could ever be worth anything over a rank 4 xyz monster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree, but I'll give Konami credit that they are trying to finally start making cards to keep up with Xyz at the very least. It's still gonna be awhile before it's all relatively balanced though. What they ban and don't ban though needs a serious look at sometimes, I feel like they just bang their heads on a table when it comes that more so than anything else.</br>  what is an "XYZ" anyway<br>why is it pronounced "x-sheezu"<br>is it XYZ or XZ</br></br>  <br>Because Exceed wasn't cool enough for Konami.</br>  <br>is just gonna end like Instant fusion splashable in some decks and even better in top decks.<br><br>but I am all for it if konami want us to play some degenerancy.</br></br></br>  <br>It would be the perfect topdecking card.</br>  <br>It means Exceeding it's just shortened to Xyz, because the way the Nips pronounce it is basically ik-seez, or their way of pronouncing Exceed, or X-yeez, it's weird, but Engrish, and yeah it's Xyz not Xz.</br>  <br><br>I see, thanks</br></br>  <br>XYZ variant when?</br>  <br>No problem man.<br><br>Probably for Kaiba in the new movie.</br></br></br>  <br>I see a smile there.</br>  <br>They can't make better Fusions until they ban Shadolls, because it'll just make Shadolls broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Synchros until they ban Quasar, because it'll just make Quasar broke as fuck<br>They can't make better Rituals until they ban Nekroz, because it'll just make Nekroz broke as fuck<br>It's a vicious cycle</br></br></br></br>    <br> Dark Rebellion XYZ XYZ Dragon Cannon </br>  <br> Make Nekroz broken <br> Make </br></br>  <br>No need to be tsun now.</br>  <br>I'm busy Shun go away.</br>  <br>How will making better synchros make quasar broke as fuck?</br>  <br>If there's one thing I know about Yugioh<br>It's that what is broke can be made even more broke if Konami makes the right moves</br></br>  <br><br><br>Guess we better make some new Ritual cards!<br><br>BUY NEKROZ</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Busy getting fat?</br>  <br>I'm simply stating they're already at that stage, you don't need to *make* them broken</br>      <br> If only you were here when Shun vs Sora aired, anon. <br> Shit was so hype. </br></br>  <br>omg, I read it in his voice...</br>  <br>What happened when MAXIMUM JIHAD?</br>  <br>I cant wait until the day that Shun gets absolutely destroyed, and I mean destroyed, he had a chance in that second duel. <br><br>This place is going to fucking explode.</br></br></br>  <br> Shun gets absolutely destroyed <br>pls no <br>that being said i can't wait until the day reiji gets destroyed</br></br></br>    <br> making memes for a character with literally 4 scenes </br>  <br> R-Ruri <br> W-what about heartulando? <br> Heartland? I've always lived in Academia <br>And then he died</br></br></br></br>  <br>Shun is going to go down hard. Reiji probably wont since he seems to be the main rival, he'll at least put up a fight, even if he's going to lose to Yuya or Leo eventually.<br><br>Can't wait.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm the one that brought them to Heartland silly~  Yugo Shokan </br>  <br>Serena is Ruri is still possible.<br>Seriously why are they hiding Ruri's design at this point. Is it just to foster shitty theories like the one I just typed and Ruri=Yuzu? Because come on.</br></br>  <br>It might make sense considering Yuri/Ruri, though I'm curious why Leo only calls her Serena-sama, he didn't say Yuzu-same when telling Yuri to go after her. <br><br>If anybody Yuzu has the best chance of actually being Ruri considering they both have that bird swoop, Yuto said Polymerization doesn't fit her, which is just an odd thing to say regardless of Fusion attacking Xyz, and then you have her mysterious birth and bracelet.</br></br></br>  <br>it's stabilized antimatter monsters</br>  <br>Nah. Ruri is being saved as a surprise. It'll feel like christmas once they show her.</br>  <br>I've been playing around with the unlikely idea that when the girls get to fusiontown, they're immediately mindwiped ala Masumi to believe they're Serena. But I guess with the childhood flashbacks that's not possible.<br><br>(I'm also the loser who keeps saying we won't be seeing Rin in person ever, which is why we get to see flashbacks of her.)</br></br></br>   Rewatching Shun vs Sora <br> Blaze Falcon is taken by Sora <br> Shun starts talking about always being prepared for their comrades being taken before playing Revolution Force <br>Ok yeah, Ruri is definitely gonna be brainwashed or some shit<br>And then Shun will rank her up into a Rank 6 Ruri</br></br></br></br>  <br>When Leo planned the Xyz dimension's destruction, he did not foresee the need for alliances. The Fusion users would sweep through the other dimensions, systematically exterminating their enemies and dismantling the proud xyz users. But the leo's vision was cynical. He did not count on the brave sacrifices the Xyz dimension's heroes were willing to make. After the Fusion's offensive seized the Heartland tower, Leo turned its sights to the synchro dimension,Believing the xyz Dimension was still recovering from its heavy losses, Fusion forces charged into Heartland Academy, where they were caught off guard by the full force of the Resistance's Army. The Resistance obliterated the Fusion squadron and the Battle of Heartland Academy became the Resistance's first major victory in the war.</br>  <br>KATTOBINGU DA<br>ORE</br></br>  <br>The news spread across the City, rekindling lost hopes and re-energizing exhausted defenders. The Resistance Army moved on to defend other battlefronts, but a courageous force of Duelist remained at heartland Academy to await the Fusion user's return. The vengeance of the Fusion came swiftly, elite fusion users army closed in on the Academy grounds to recoup their losses, but Professor Belth Allusis, seven dozen of the Resistance's finest duelist, and four thousand casual's players dug in to defend the Academy's grounds...or get carded trying. The disparity was staggering. An unprecedented Fusion army, fifty thousand strong, descended on Heartland Academy's brave defenders. The defenders were undaunted. With no expectations of survival, they were mindful of their duty.</br>  <br><br>But overconfident Fusion Professors threw all their armies' might into the direct assault and their ground forces fell in droves. For every Xyz duelist who was carded, ten Fusion users were killed. The Fusion professors was forced to call in reinforcements. Despite the defenders determination, their lines were whittled away until only a handful of Duelist remained. They rallied to Professor Allusis for a final stand. Fusion Professor Moff Zellos offered to spare Professor Allusis if he and his brave comrades would surrender. Neither pride nor foolhardiness drove the defender's decision. They were guided by their sidedeck. They had passed beyond the fear of death. Their glorious last stand will never be forgotten. Allusis and his men fell, but not before the Fusion users were driven to retreat. The Battle of Heartland Academy was a draw. The heroes of Heartland Academy inspired bold new xyz strategies that eventually halted the Fusion's advances. In retrospect, though, the Resistance lost too many duelsit in the early days of the war. The execution of the Leo's brilliant strategy was flawless. Survival was the best the Resistance could hope for.</br></br>  So, where the fuck is Yuri? Is he still at Standard? Or did he go back to Academia?  <br><br><br> same guy who kept posting edited Darth Bane quotes </br></br></br>  <br>You kidding? I loved Baneposter-kun.</br>  Yuya has gone full Yuzufag. Please imagine the link below comes complete with a shitty fadeout AMV of Tomato hallucinating his waifu:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sto<wbr>RjxrJavc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>tumblr please go</br>    <br>Unless he's decided that wandering around Standard doing nothing for several days is a good use of his time, he's probably gone back to Academia for a scolding.</br>  BATTLE DA  <br>ENJOOOOOOOOOOY</br>  Meow~  So what makes the Fusion Dimension so much more deadly than the other dimensions anyways? <br><br>I mean I get the shitty logic that they're trying to fuse the dimensions, but why is fusion so good? They should in no way have had the advantage on Xyz. Makes me curious if GX characters actually are their teachers.</br></br>  <br>Probably because the Fusion dimension trained all their soldiers for war and invasion while Xyz dimension just dueled for fun</br>  <br>Even still they're just using generic decks for most of their soldiers and just trouncing most people. <br><br>That and it's pretty safe to assume that all the DM/GX/5Ds/Zexal characters barring the main characters exist in this weird dimensional rift/alternate timeline, so where are half of them even at? Also how do some characters even work such as say Kaiba? If KaibaCorp exists in Synchro, considering the Duel Runners, then what is he doing? Just retired, and if Kaiba would likely exist, I'd assume Pegasus and all the DM/GX characters exist within Synchro too, unless there is technically a Kaiba in both Standard and Fusion as well and they don't take place concurrently. <br><br>Ya know, I'm just confused by this whole stuff honestly. I know it's meant to just be callbacks, but I'm sure they have to have some type of explanation for it at the very least, I don't think they'd just do it without any type of plan whatsoever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>artist?</br>  <br>Do not sexualize my monstah kado</br>  Soon  <br>Already ahead of ya there Standard. Two Ruris down, two to go.</br>  <br>Well, since Synchro exist due to Yliaster time travel fuckery, who knows the status of other essential characters such as Kaiba and Mokuba. Pegasus is dead though. Died in Duelist Kingdom.</br>  <br>Ok, I'll sexualize Selena then.</br>  <br>I lost my shit when they treated the fucking prison guard getting hit as a duel</br>  Are there any gifs/webms of Shun going Yusei on the guards yet?      <br>That's fine.</br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br> gif </br>  <br> gifs </br>  <br> gifs of Shun going Yusei on the guards </br>  So why are lancers selection being sent to do this and not like a swat team? They're just duelists.  Huh, Yuya's more of a carnivore than Sawatari is.  Tell me, /a/.<br><br>What other illicit drugs will Yuya and pals target in the next OPs?</br></br>  Why was Sawatari allowed to come with them? Didn't he like lick and sexually harass one of the female characters? Oh yeah, gotta send the potential rapist there, he's there to look after all the asses  <br>When the hell did that happen?<br>Are you accusing the great Neo New Sawatari of something he has not done? There's no bigger disgrace</br></br>  Explain this  Can someone more well-versed in the card game than me explain what monster is being portrayed in the poster?  <br>When he kidnapped Yuzu he was like, grabbing her and getting pretty close.</br>  <br>That's an Obelisk Force</br>  <br>I thought that was supposed to be Obelisk Force.</br>  <br>But he didn't kidnap her.<br>He has not ever touched Yuzu or any other females in any way either.</br></br>  <br><br>Oh, damn! I thought the 'head' part was the head and the 'shoulder blades' part was the tail, and this is some weird four-footed monster. Only now have I realized the other shoulder blade.<br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They're duel energy tanks. For storing duel energy.</br>  <br> Fusion needs a Miracle Fusion that's not exclusive to Heroes <br>So basically this: http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Soul_F<wbr>usion</wbr></br></br>  To whom else is Yuya going to spread his Yuzu.flac?  <br>The SWAT team would just get turned into cards dude.</br>  <br>He'll try to spread it to Jack.</br>  FREE THE ICE BARRIER DRAGONS  <br> tfw Yuya gets cucked by Jack. <br> tfw Jack/Yuzu becomes the new Jack/Carly <br>   But seriously, if Yuya gets cucked, it will be by Yugo (obvious), Shun (also obvious), or Reiji (because he wasn't enough of a troll as it is). </br></br></br>  <br>It would be outstanding if the straightest MC in YGO so far didn't end up with the girl he wanted so badly. Maybe you should try being indifferent towards her, Yuya!</br>  <br> Let's warn everyone about Yugo <br> NOT YUGO! FUGO! <br> oh right, but let's also make the person on the poster a silhouette so no one knows what they actually look like </br></br></br>  <br>Not even that guy. But you know that he is right. This whole "VR" thing has just been a marketing gimmick because VR sure as fuck sounds a lot more attractive than "a partial taste of what might eventually evolve into VR".</br>  I can't be the only one enjoying Choujiro so far,  can i? <br><br>I wish he joins yuya's group or lives a better lives somehow.</br></br>  I remember when Yugioh used to be good...<br><br> Seven weeks ago, before Synchro happened </br></br>  What the fuck is the point if they can't dunk?<br><br>Dont tell me you guys watch this just for "fundamentals"..</br></br>  Here's another gem of their mad skills at work, just for you  I watch it for its literary merit.  <br> that underhand cripple's throw <br>is she retarded? that girl is the tallest of the group it seems, but she doesn't boss the others around and seems so timid &amp; weak</br></br>  <br>I want to have fun with their damentals if you know what I mean.</br>  Is this like K-On with basketballs and lolis?  <br>LeDickrider pls<br>I bet you're one of those cucks who think three point shooting is a meme</br></br>  <br>No they actually play basketball.</br>  <br>Too bad, I wanted to watch a laid back cute girls doing cute things show.</br>  <br>Basketball can be cute.</br>  <br> Dont tell me you guys watch this just for "fundamentals".. <br>Tell that to Coach K and Popovich white boy.
