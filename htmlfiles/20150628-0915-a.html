[ This manga is amazing !!  Sakura kills hundreds in Fuyuki city and kills shinji in Heavens Feel  <br>It was a while since i read FSN but i do not remember scene you are talking about.<br>Not saying it was not there tho</br></br>  Sakura a cute  <br><br>She wasn't in direct control of the Shadow for the majority of the route, and IIRC Zouken admits to having directed it before Sakura snaps. <br>When she does snap, it's a combination of being raped and abused for ten years, as well as the fact that being connected to Angra Mainyu screws up your head. I don't think you can blame Sakura for having negative emotions in general, but being influenced by Angra Mainyu just made her completely lose her ability to suppress said emotions. <br><br>So half of the matter is Angra Mainyu, the other is being a human being who lived through shit. You can blame her if hating her makes you feel that much better, but her circumstances sure as hell aren't simple.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Kirei will never offer you mapo tofu <br>Why live.</br></br>  <br>Well said.<br><br>And on that note.<br><br>Sakura DINDU NUFFIN</br></br></br></br></br>  Who /organised/ here?   that mess <br> organized <br><br> SnK in top 10 <br> S;G in top 10 <br><br>Literally fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> windows 8 </br>  <br> wasting time into shit like that <br>Just make a notepad file and write in it like that:<br><br> Anime <br> Series name - Episode <br><br> Manga <br> Series name - Chapter <br><br>That's completly enough and you won't waste as much time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why keep track of things that you've already watched?<br><br>Can't your memory do that?</br></br>  Will we ever see a non-japanese team?  <br>How quick?</br>  <br>and from the other side</br>        Have you had your breakfast, /a/?  <br>I think we've moved past that stage whereby she wants him expelled. Subconsciously, she's perhaps 'waiting' for him to catch up to her, so that they could initiate their inevitable Shokugeki. Its still too early, but Souma's making such huge strides, it may happen before their 3rd year.</br>  <br> animeonlyfag </br>  Can't wait to see Souma getting saved by the cute loli.  <br> not wanting Rindou-nee to pop by to say hi &amp; give him tips to take down the manlet </br>  <br>I think he's talking about other cute loli.</br>  Holy shit Summer's looking good.

Suddenly I don't feel so bad for missing it.</br>   KLK / SnK / Oreimo <br>Seriously? Haruhi, Code Geass and Madoka had shit tons more people watching it when it was airing.</br>  ITT : shits you like in anime<br><br> huge explosion/energy beam <br> villain gets caught in <br> slowly fades away in the bright light </br></br></br></br>  Really simple and non-convoluted powers.<br><br>So many anime powers need a fucking encyclopedia to understand them and the story always grinds to a halt to explain every minute detail of how a fucking beam works or something.<br><br>That's why Stardust Crusaders had the best Stands. Easy to understand, fun to watch, and clever use of their powers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>which anime ?</br>  <br> Stardust Crusaders had the best stands <br><br>Nigga what?</br></br></br>  Underdog stories  <br>this has been pointed out multiple times, but<br> berserk mode <br>Also<br> Fights where someone with a blade seems inmobile but he cuts something to pieces in a fraction of second </br></br></br></br>  What anime have implicit racism?  <br>For narrative purposes though.</br>  Afro Samurai?  <br>Nothing wrong with 2D sluts.</br>  <br>Makes sense. It's written by a 50 plus year old Japanese patriot. Dude seriously has the mains kill China off the map, Americans super scared of them and Russia their best friends. Funniest racism is Sword Art Online nips being so good at games that not even the combined forces of Chinese, Korea and America could stop them. Then there's some other light novel about Japan winning World War II thanks to a samurai with a katana.</br>  <br> Russia their best friends. <br> not Germany <br><br>Nippon pls.</br></br></br></br>  ITT good tsundere   good tsundere   <br> Aoba <br> bad </br></br>  One of the few modern tsundere I can actually stand.  <br>It's simply shameful that it took this long for Eri to appear. If there ever was a romantic comedy tsundere done right, it was her.</br>    I don't think I'm autistic enough to understand what the fuck their talking about. What's all this vague social drama about? Is this a japanese thing?<br>When I was in high school the guys were always blunt and the girls were so fake that they ended up being obvious about their feelings as well.<br><br>Someone explain this shit to an adult</br></br></br>  <br>Anime in general and especially LN adaptations are hardly the place to go to if you crave deep stories with great characters. <br><br>We just here for the babes.</br></br></br>  <br>this anime is the kinda shit that happens if people who have no problems make their shitty little interactions into problems.</br>  8man alone again ending, calling it now.  <br>Seconding this, not "to understand 8man", but because it is miles better than Yahari</br>  <br>It's almost on point with the first world teenager problems though. Although real teenagers don't talk like the ones in the show.</br>   Tags: MILF, nakadashi, impregnation, lingerie, BBW, anal, blowjob, incest    lolicon, toddlercon, anal, incest, shotacon    gyaru <br> no cheating, prostitution, or netorare <br><br>Perfect<br>Also<br> muscle <br> nakadashi <br> impregnation </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Mindbreak, Netorare, parasite <br><br><br>What is wrong with me</br></br></br>  <br>Gay</br>  <br>There is nothing gay about revenge fucking someone that bullied you.</br>   [ron] Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid 01-12 (BATCH) <br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=7<wbr>05040<br><br>Bring on season 2.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>Why couldn't Vivid be like this?</br>  <br>UFO Nanoha series.<br>I'd wonder how that turn out.</br></br>  <br>The companies producing figurines and printing sleazy artbooks pocketed them.</br>  <br> rhino noses in my Nanoha <br><br>no thanks</br></br></br>  <br> It's goddamn Nanoha, for fuck's sake.
