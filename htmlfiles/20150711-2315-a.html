[ Who would win in a 1on1? Akashi or Lebron James?  <br>Lj free, go read extra game if you wanna see how he does against niggas</br>  <br>I want to molest Kuroko.</br>  <br>Lebron can't even win Finals, who cares.</br>  <br> LeBron can't even grow back his hairline </br>  Please take a moment to admire the great LeBron for the special talent he is. It never gets old looking at the King's history. So many accomplishments Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan will never achieve:<br><br>1.Only player in NBA history to quit because of Air Conditioner.<br>2.Quit on his team the year after he promises a championship.<br>3.Dunked on by a high school kid then confiscates the tape.<br>4.Bail on the dunk contest 9 times.<br>5.Only able to win a ring with 2 superstars.<br>6.Play on same team as his moms boyfriend.<br>7.Average 1.8 pts in the 4th quarter of NBA finals.<br>8.Lose not 1, not 2, but 6 times in the Finals.<br>9.Host a national televised TV show to leave his team.<br>10.Go 2 for 18 in an NBA playoff game.<br>11.Get stuffed by a player under 6 feet. (Nate Robinson)<br>12.Flop every single game in the playoff 5 out of 6 finals games by dropping FG% by 18.<br>14.0 Rings if not for refs calling early fouls on Durant and Westbrook it threw them out of rhythm, made them play soft, and sit for big parts of the game which changed the flow and momentum of the finals.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/127914327#p127919289">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thoughts on Dandelion so far? It has fairly unique concept but its execution is absurd as fuck. The characters are pretty decent and cute especially Kanade and Hikari. Above average show.  <br>Their mom is so short</br>  So, still no group willing sub it before Monday?  <br><br>Doki has it scheduled for monday, I wonder why that is. Are they just using Funi's script and not doing an original TL?</br></br>  <br>There was a guy trying to do it yesterday but no signs so far today.</br>  <br>7/10 will keep watching.<br><br>Hope the quality didn't drop to twintail level though.</br></br></br>  How does /a/ feel about tomboys?  Truly, the best tomboy  <br>The main difference is the penis.</br>  <br>Perhaps because it's actually something that exists in real life?</br>  <br> /a/ mercenaries  <br>After seeing that one vid of that carrier commander with all his weeb toys I wouldn't even be surprised if that's a thing.<br>The thought that /a/ might have access to advanced weaponry scares the shit out of me tho.</br></br></br>  <br>I think we differ in our definition of 'tomboy' if you believe they exist IRL. Most irl 'tomboys' are attention whores who believe in grill power. Anime tomboys are effectively boys in a girls body.</br>  Would you shave her anon?<br><br>Also, god bless Lerche for the best adaptation this season.</br></br>  <br>Tionishia.<br><br><br>He should've specified without upgrades.</br></br></br></br>  <br>For some reason I didn't even think of her first, even though she is the best girl.<br>Maybe because she propably can't actually carry anything heavy, cause she's just slime</br></br>  <br>Cerea wins just about any stability contest unless you flank her. Pulling or dragging as well.<br><br>Dead-lifting and swinging of heavy objects would go to Tio/Kinu(Oni power) or Cathyl.<br><br>Honorable mention of Papi for flying with 400-500kg Miia in her talons.<br><br>Just for the record, a bottlenose is surprisingly light, only 150-200kg, which is a lot less than Tio's max.(Google "dolphin weight")</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy shit she is fucking strong</br>  <br>What about Miia's crushing strength.<br>She can easily break metal bars with the fucking tip when she doesn't control herself.</br></br>  After watching and realizing how shit Chaos Dragon was, how about a good ol' high fantasy thread? <br>I assume all of you already dropped it by now.<br>Rokka no Yuusha seems cool albeit disappointing that they didn't actually use any of aztec/incan/mesoamerican shit they did for it.<br>Oh and Bahamut S2 is coming soon.<br><br>Ah fuck. Shit's making me want to marathon Lodoss again.</br></br></br></br></br>  Silver-Link's doing like 3 shows this season. They're probably just understaffed. Give it a few episodes, anon.<br><br> Lou a best. </br></br>    <br>Oh yeah. That's sad. Wish I could've seen a longer more developed version. But regardless it was great</br>  Soon  I don't recall the production "running out of money". It was poorly written and paced, which is why it's so bad.  <br>Someone had a bad child hood and probably needs to go to the high school in Angel beats.</br>     Your life is an anime <br>What genre anon?</br>  <br>Harem/SoL</br>  Depends on what era my life it is.<br><br> Kid <br>Adventure or some shit<br> Teenager <br>A mix between NHK/Eva<br> College <br>Golden Boy<br> After College/Now <br>Gundam Build Fighters</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Golden boy <br> Gundam <br>anon pls</br></br></br>  <br>Gore.</br>  Solanin  ;_;  <br>Speaking of SakuSaku. There's not a day I'm not amazed at how sonic fast the translation is. It even makes me scared and think it is a google translate tier TL.</br>  <br> Main heroine <br>MY SIDES.</br></br>  <br> think it is a google translate tier TL. <br><br>Very likely it is, especially considering it started as a Fuwa project, didn't it?</br></br></br>  NEVER EVER<br>E<br>V<br>E<br>R</br></br></br></br>  <br> Non-blood-related </br>  Expectations for chapter 36<br> Boring SoL </br>    <br> That's what Etofags believe </br>  <br> Eto literally wasn't even trying and had no interest in destroying him <br>You're joking right?</br></br>  <br> Grappling dat Touka ass. <br><br>Nice</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I'm not a etofag, but you can go and fuck yourselves</br></br></br></br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1pKgBm8Aa58mjB1hYhbK-VOPZsRBTXBuPBz<wbr>w8Xikm2ss/pub?embedded=true<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/127808<wbr>792/</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Sorry, forgot to add: I will be dividing those lines to replicate the pdf layout. Wasn't able to have it automated in the CSS but it isn't hard to alter with HTML. Wanted to keep as much noise out of each field as possible for simple copy/paste changes but the tables sort of throw that theory out of the windows and across the road. What a fucking mess they are. <br><br>Also, do you have any comment as to the placement of the formation table? I don't really know where to put it, to be honest. It can be moved pretty easily by changing the field position but not everyone is confident in touching the layout of their cards. <br><br>Tried to set it up with as much user flexibility as possible.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How do you remember new words after quitting Anki? Just by looking them up when you come across them until you remember them? <br><br>Yeah pretty much. It may sound impractical, but if you think about it, isn't it just like Anki? I see words, and if I remember them, great, if not I peek at the meaning. Just like with flashcards. And also I find that it is much easier to remember the words when seeing them in context than in isolation. I might not get Anki's optimized repetition spacing and order scheme, but that's a sacrifice I'm more than willing to accept.</br></br></br>  http://jisho.org/search/%E5%8D%8D%E<wbr>5%B7%B4</wbr>  <br>巴人</br>  <br>After the 1000 or so words I know, It's gotten easier to remember new words so your method is appealing and I might try it out once if I can kill the addiction that is Anki. I've started to skip some of my reps because it's tedious so it might not be that far away. I still have fun reading while knowing basically none of the words anyway.</br>  They are more like Coward Attack Force.<br><br>Enemy has no guns, only swords. Still they attack with mortars and cannons.<br><br>They have no honor at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are many kinds of revolution anon. Communism has been and gone, next time it will be something new.</br>  <br> stupid depiction of China <br>Are you implying that the Chinese are in any way shape or form competent?</br></br>  Will the president of the united states piss himself?<br> Twice? </br>  <br> Not apologising for war crimes <br><br>I'm sorry. Has the US apologised for Dresden? Hamburg? Tokyo? How about the post-war German camps?</br></br></br>  <br> ... and of the USA <br><br>Americans have always been retarded as shit.</br></br></br>  Doffy is fucking dead Edition<br>The strings inside his body dissolved with the birdcage and law knows that, that's why he who is exhausted let's the marine's take doffy with him, because doffy won't even live long enough to reach impel down. But we all know that either Crocodile, Moria or Kaidou will attack the marine ship and see doffy dying. <br>Also Sanji a best  Secret Dellinger a whore thread </br></br>  <br> Any idea why the new pirate alliance (Kidd, Apoo, Basil) are targeting Shanks? <br>Because there can only be one Yonkou with red hair, missing their left arm and have a scar over their left eye.</br></br>  <br> Enel <br> ever working for someone else, even if it's just officially </br></br>  <br>The Shikibukai system will get outed and replace by only one man: awakened Foxy.</br>  <br> replace by only one man: Buggy, our lord and savior <br><br>Fixed that for you</br></br></br>  <br> Any idea why the new pirate alliance (Kidd, Apoo, Basil) are targeting Shanks? <br>Why not? As far as they know all Yonkous are equal,save for Kaido who is literally named the strongest creature in the world.</br></br>  What does /a/ think about You are Umasou?  Fucking cutest thing ever  Went into barely expecting anything and was only interested because I fucking love dinosaurs. Was pleasantly surprised, fucking good shit.  <br>Going in I had seen some of the fight scene gifs so I was ready for some good action, but I sure as hell didn't anticipate all the feels. The race scene was heartwrenching.</br>  I felt really sorry for this guy.<br>He never really did anything wrong</br>  I liked the flash shorts more than the actual movie.  Best girl.  <br>Literally "at least she's better than shit" tier</br>  <br> I think if they slowed the pacing it wouldn't be as funny <br>Depends on how slow. Putting jokes one after the other without any pauses isn't good either.</br></br>   Did she actually enjoy getting pissed on?   <br> ______________No.____________ </br>  <br>But there were breaks. One big one was Kiyoshi talking to Chiyo in the tree, him dropping the eraser, the beginning no? Those were down times.<br><br>I really think that this is a case of too many people reading the manga. I thought it was really funny &amp; stopped at a great point. I don't agree with people dropping it or dismissing it solely, because of the fan service though. I think that's unfair.</br></br></br>  Just finished season 2 of Knights of Sidonia and absolutely loved it. Hoping for a season 3, but in the meantime I will be reading the manga from beginning to end.  <br>Someone mentioned the center of gravity being at the center of the circle or some shit. I know jack shit about physics.</br>  <br> no director's cut <br><br>That's wrong, both season last episode are director's cut</br></br></br>  S3 was shit. They've managed to go from a good fresh mecha to a cancer sol harem cancer. CG got worse too.   netflix <br><br>Also the show was shit<br><br> CG <br> muh space harem </br></br></br></br></br>  Needs more Samari</blockquote>]
