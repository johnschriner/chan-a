[  summer season has started <br> all these new shows <br> can't stop watching the first two episodes of Wakaba*Girl again and again <br><br>Am I alone on this, /a/?</br></br></br></br>  Wakaba thread?    AOTS   liking "Totally not KinMoza: The Mini Series"   <br>More like "Way better than KinMoza: Shorts are fun"</br>  <br>PI<br>PON<br>PI PON PO PI PON PION PI PON</br></br></br>  <br> Way better than KinMoza: Shorts are fun <br><br>this is correct. Not only is the moe superior and of more quality than KinMoza, it's also more condensed due to the short length.</br></br></br>  <br><br>No, it is not. KinMoza will live on forever in the hearts of man. You faggots won't even remember this shit when next season comes by. <br><br> You're Wakaba Girl waifu a shit. </br></br></br></br>  <br>more like<br> liking moeshit </br></br>  <br>Wakaba herself is miles better than any fucking Kinmoza slut</br>  Pinpon pinpon.  <br>Hey man, it ain't my fault that you and all of your Literally Whos don't even get the light of day. KinMoza girls are pure and virginal, while your Wakaba pig-dogs are nothing but filth. <br><br>And you didn't deny that you wouldn't forget about your shitty little show, you fucking hypocrite.</br></br></br>  <br>This. the short length perfectly suits moe</br>  That son of a bitch...  <br>The full OP needs to come out already.</br>  <br>I won't forget about her because Wakaba already lives in my heart, eternally. And she's more pure than any Kinmoza, look at the fucking OP image, you monger.<br><br>Look, I can see why you kinmoza fans are upset, the creator put out Wakaba*Girl and I guess it's painful to see that the new shiny model out-performs the old and busted model that is Kinmoza.</br></br></br>  <br>new meme</br>  <br>Whatever fag, KinMoza will always be better than this your poorman's show. <br><br>You can enjoy your LITTLE sluts; Karen, Kuzehashi-sensei and I will go laughing all the way to bank. See you next season, nerd.</br></br></br>   mfw I decided to only watch the raws to help with listening practice   Wakaba Girl is better because it has no yuri.  Wakaba Girl is better because it has no Karen.  <br><br>What if  both  are good?</br></br>  <br>I'll remember KinMoza longer because of the Disney sing-along. But Wakaba*Girl at least stay on my hard drive far longer.<br><br><br>Why not watch the subs afterwards?</br></br></br></br>   That scene where she eats her friend's entire ice cream top in one bite <br>Worse than all the villains of this season put together.</br>    <br> &gt;/gore/ </br>  <br>Just keep doing it.<br>https://d.maxfile.ro/hvamibfomv.web<wbr>m</wbr></br></br>  <br> Why not watch the subs afterwards? <br>It's more fun this way.</br></br>  Wakaba Girl is better because sluts are fun.      This is the third(?) fucking YYS thread, check the fucking catalog.<br><br>And the other is already ruined with idiotic sexualization so you should feel at home there.<br><br>Prune your shitty thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The one get deleted and the other archived.<br>We're doomed by everyone.</br></br>  <br> We're doomed by everyone. </br>  <br><br>I'd like to sniff all of the Yuyus' bicycle seats equally.<br><br> I'd simply like to sniff Yukari's bicycle seat more equallieriesterererererererererer.   Er. </br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh. P.S. DAT ASS. Damn.<br><br> in b4 salt shaker of ass image </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The one get deleted <br>Dare I ask?<br><br><br>tumbling down<br>tumbling down<br>etc</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice butt.</br>  New chapter when?  <br>Mods being incredible faggots</br>  <br> Dare I ask? <br>It had /yys/ and "edition" in the OP. If you make a thread look like a general it's going to be deleted. Don't do that. The OP should probably also contain a valid conversation-starting topic such as "who is your favorite Yuyu," or "what is your favorite episode?" Doesn't matter if it's been discussed already. There's probably new Yuyubros by now. Just give the thread a reason to exist, because without a reason to exist it's just a general and is going to be deleted.</br></br>  <br> seeing myself there <br>Hazukashii.</br></br>  <br> start threads with valid, discussion-generating questions like who is your favorite character </br>  <br><br>I didn't say anything about the quality of the discussion. Also, name something /a/ likes to talk about more than who is best girl. That's right.</br></br>  Maybe it's time to let go.  New porn coming soon  <br><br>Well, apologies about that then, but I'm mad about your choice of OP anyway.<br><br>I fucking hate this absolutely tasteless kind of sexualization. It was just at the upper limit of acceptability in the show itself for me, so fanart is fucking unbearable.<br><br>It was otherwise such an incredibly lovely show too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>How autistic.</br>  <br>I much prefer yuri.</br>    <br>Maybe next time, Anon.<br> There is one page of yuri in this. </br></br>  <br><br> I fucking hate this absolutely tasteless kind of sexualization. It was just at the upper limit of acceptability in the show itself for me, so fanart is fucking unbearable. <br><br>You're going to have to explain why you think these things are bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh, fuck me, I got trolled. Didn't even expand the image.</br></br></br>  <br>Since when was this translated? It's not on sadpanda.</br>  <br>My post says "coming soon."<br>It's not done yet. We're almost finished.</br></br>  <br>I apologize for the misunderstanding, I interpreted "coming soon" as being unrelated to your picture.</br>  <br>Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said "new porn" considering it's not really new PORN, just a translation.</br>  <br>I know those are trollsubs or something (haven't watched the video the GIF is from) but do know that Miyazaki is critical of the horrendous state of the anime industry wrt. pandering to drooling idiots who will buy anything that makes their dick erect, and I fully sympathize with him.<br><br><br>This crap is utterly revolting.<br><br>The only kind of erotic/sexual content I find acceptable is stuff that doesn't represent girls as wanton fucking sluts. First you go<br> hurr durr we're all cute little girls here <br>and then you post that disgusting filth.<br><br>Fuck you, /a/.<br><br><br>You don't deserve to express your feelings through those faces.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> coming soon <br>m-me too!</br></br>  <br> You don't deserve to express your feelings through those faces. <br><br>Og god, whatever shall I do? Someone is trying to tell me what I can and can't do on the internet.</br></br></br>      <br>I'd really like them doing that to Yahari threads. <br><br>Fucking faggots post everyday a <br>Yahari Oregairu _____ Edition</br></br></br></br>  I want to make Yuzu a real okaa-san.  <br>S-stop posting her!</br>  <br><br> you will never be that drinking fountain </br></br>   Fumibutt, Sunsets-chan, I'll be absent from IRC for a few days.   <br>Only Yui can.</br>  Heh  <br> trek </br>  <br> Chain crossed </br>  Didn't lurk the threads for a while.

And the emptiness is already setting in. Why won't we ever get a season 2?  <br>You can always read the manga I guess, it's what I'm planning to do after I finish the anime<br> still have 2 episodes left </br></br>  <br>the world is against us</br>  <br>Enjoy slow updates then. Bakkin's main focus is Yuru Yuri.</br>  <br>soon™</br>  <br>I do enjoy them both so it's not that huge of an issue for me</br>  <br>I enjoy both also but it's rare to get a new Yuyushiki chapter. It doesn't fill the void enough since it's absent for too long.</br>  <br>Yuru is great but but YuYus is so much more personal feeling.</br>  <br>well fuck then<br><br><br>I actually prefer the yurus but the yuyus are pretty great as well, also helps that Yui is my favorite girl and she's pratically the same in both shows</br></br></br></br>  <br>Official list of twitter/pixiv lewd YYS artists:<br><br>tw_too<br>tatunokosso<br>tatunokosso18<br>melty_pot<br>mel_r18<br>psychooxy<br>afunai<br>shibainu<br>uasi<br>mikamikomata<br>youkizato</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Aren't they banning them now?

Apparently "beef-meat pattern" is slang for pic related.    <br> beef-meat pattern <br>I still don't get it.</br></br>  <br>It's just slang for tit enlarging. So in the hand bit the beef-meat thing was saying "it'd be nice to be able to shoot tit enlargement out of my hands"</br>  <br>Why is Yukari so mathematical?</br>  <br>I wish I can shoot tits enlargement beams from my hand.</br>  <br> Oops .</br>  <br>She's a transcendent being.</br>  How much would you pay for a body pillow like this?  <br>Tree fiddy</br>  <br>I'd pay with my body.</br>  <br>I would like to be that body pillow</br>  <br>I'd hug you, anon.</br>  <br>i would hug all of you, really</br>  I love Yui.  <br>I would too. But I don't hug tripfags.</br>  <br>whats wrong with her neck?</br>  <br>Trips can be good people too</br>  <br>Absolutely nothing.</br>  <br> whats wrong with her neck? </br>  <br>what did you do to her?</br>  <br>neck aids of the neck ;_;</br>  <br>Yuzuko probably drew a penis on her neck while she was asleep and didn't like it so she crossed it out.</br>  <br>Could someone explain exactly what's going on here? q is a function which maps the surface of a torus to Yukari, but what do the X, Y, L^1 and L^2 mean? Furthermore does the ~ signify an equivalence relation? I've got an undergrad math degree but I've never taken a proper topology course so this is kind of foreign to me.</br>  <br> this tripshit <br> good </br></br>  <br> Yuzuko probably drew a penis <br>End of your rope, buddy</br></br>    <br>The L1, L2, X and Y just denote specific subsets of the torus and Yukari's face. q is a quotient map from the torus to Yukari that's defined by identifying L1 with X and L2 with Y, i.e. "gluing" the torus onto Yukari's face.<br><br>Also the caption says "these are not my glasses."</br></br></br>  <br>yuzu wouldnt know what one of those was or looked like<br><br>im not familiar with him</br></br></br>  <br>But she's a pervert.</br>  <br>you can be a pervert without dicks</br>  <br>He is a ban evading tripfag.</br>  <br>what did he do?</br>  <br>Promised to suck dick but didn't.</br>  <br>Got his previous tripcode for blatant shitposting.</br>  <br>Same thing, really.</br>  <br><br> full leg extension when pedal reading furthest distance from body </br></br>  <br>Please ignore him. He seems to think I'm someone else.</br>  <br>Holy fuck where's the picture where some anon recreated this scene in paint? That was the funniest shit I've seen ever.</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/_/search/tripco<wbr>de/!!77lAXu61hOW/<br>Previous tripcodes.</br></wbr></br>    <br>Oh lordy. Looks like Beavis and Butthead.</br>  <br>Cheers, mate.</br>  <br>are the other characters ever shown in loli form?</br>  <br>Yui and Yukari's childhood had been shown, but nothing for Yuzuko yet.</br>  <br> yet </br>  <br>Wow that's wonderful you're able to describe it!<br><br> identifying L1 with X <br>I'm still confused. Do you mean that L1 and X are homeomorphic? I thought ~ was used to denote equivalences, but that only makes sense if L1 and X are elements of spaces. But in this case they are sets! As for gluing, I was lead to believe you only glue individual elements of a space together by forming an equivalence relation between the two and then considering the resulting quotient space. But...<br> "gluing" the torus onto Yukari's face <br>How do you mean! Anon please, I must know how to glue a torus onto Yukari's face firsthand.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to live in yukari's mansion with all the yuyus</br>  <br> Do you mean that L1 and X are homeomorphic? <br>Not necessarily.<br> I thought ~ was used to denote equivalences, but that only makes sense if L1 and X are elements of spaces. <br>Not necessarily. One can define equivalence relations on sets, and in this case q(L1)=X and q(L2)=Y.<br> As for gluing, I was lead to believe you only glue individual elements of a space together by forming an equivalence relation between the two and then considering the resulting quotient space. <br>Not necessarily. A set of elements can be identified with a set in the image.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks but I guess I'm a little too tired right now and a little too retarded to pick up on what you're saying in your original explanation. You'd have to start from a more basic point and explain yourself more fully, but at that point I should probably be reading a textbook.</br>  <br> I should probably be reading a textbook <br>Start with Munkres' Topology.</br></br>  <br>woah those fingers</br>  <br>Yuzu didn't have a childhood. She's an android sent from the future to prevent an apocalypse.</br>  <br>K I M O<br>I<br>M<br>O</br></br></br></br>  <br>what caused the apocalypse?</br>  <br>Who says robots can't have childhoods?<br>Also I'd watch a Terminator parody of Yuyushiki.</br></br>  <br>Knowing what causes the apocalypse will trigger the apocalypse.</br>  Good night /yys/.  <br>i would totally ignore the sequels to that film</br>  Good night /yys/.  <br>2 was great. And Yuzuko has to be kid connor.</br>  What's the IRC for /yys/?  <br>#sockpuppets@beannet.org</br>  Today I didn't forget the yuyus, I just got too lazy to check it.  <br>That's even worse than forgetting it.</br>  <br>I just realized that the boat looks like a cunt.</br>  Selamat Pagi /yys/  <br>Why the FUCK are ゆゆ式 mods being deleted for being "generals" or whatnot while ゆるゆり threads, which ARE generals, have been allowed to run multiple times every 24 hours, for months and months after the season ended, when there wasn't the OVA, when there isn't new chapters released or the manga ever really discussed, etc.? Fuck these mods. Fuck them. <br><br>On a side note I accidentally finished watching episode 12. Usually stop at episode 10 because seeing it end is painful for a show full of healing. That ending. Having no news about another season is like having your heart ripped out. At least the manga is getting new content unlike other healing CTDCT series which have been very slow and some basically on an unspoken hiatus. <br><br><br>/rant. <br> Fuck these mods and jannies. Most of them are newer than everyone in this thread. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If you make a thread look like a general it's going to be deleted. <br>Nonsense. /a/ is full of generals. What makes yuyushiki special?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Wow surprisingly lots of cyclists here.<br><br><br>I regret not choosing Giant, realized I paid so much more for a Cannondale of the same tier.<br><br>Also Yui's butt is a miracle of this universe, why are cycling shorts the best?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Not having S2 is harsh.  <br>It's coming. Also it looks like KC is doing the second season for Gochi Usa, so that will be interesting.</br>  <br><br> It's coming <br><br><br>Quit playing games with my heart</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tfw you can't ride a bike </br>  <br>Don't worry, buddy.

Introduce the kindest girl that could ever exist, the entire show's premise is "oh man when is she going to become a magical girl? What's her wish going to be?" So her becoming literally Jesus Christ and taking on the burden of the universe's sins is the best kind of resolution you can have. You're left wondering all this time until the end, and it's perfect. What else could be a better wish for her? The ending is incredibly emotional and cathartic. You're left feeling sad, but like that is the proper end.<br><br>Everyone says "oh well what about this?" "they could explain that", "b-but Homura was left sad!". They don't need to. Not every single possibility or avenue needs to be shown.<br><br>Good stories are supposed to be clear, and concise. Not getting overburdened and confused with differing twists and upsets. So many series can't seem to grasp this and just water down and overbloat their plots with seasons upon seasons. You don't need this, just tell the fucking story as well as you can.

I think you could make an argument either way based on the events and symbolism and stuff in Rebellion.</br>  <br>She said she has become evil so I'm guessing either they kill her or madoka saves her</br>  <br>Madoka would kill her if she tried.

Even more so in a series like Madoka.<br><br>Homura's "evil act", such as wasting Kyouko's apple, breaking Mami's tea cup, and provoking Sayaka were all done so Homura could convince herself she is the "bad guy" to Madoka's "hero."<br><br>Evil is not wearing dark clothes and calling yourself a demon. Evil is intentionally hurting others for nothing but your own personal gain.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which Homura did. She enjoys tormenting others. She hates them for getting in her way as blame for her own failures as a person. She deserves to die.<br><br>Madoka never even liked her.</br></br></br>  Is Madoka gay?  <br>I took it as she became the powerful entity opposite of madoka, she also mentioned destroying the universe</br>  <br>No. She never loved Homura, not at all.</br>  <br> so Homura could convince herself she is the "bad guy" to Madoka's "hero." <br><br>Seems to me like a pile of contrived bull tbh.<br><br><br>Sayaka brought it up, Homura was extremely vague in response.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> tbh <br><br>The worst new meme.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes.

She enjoys hurting people.</br>  <br><br>Madoka factually canonically in every timeline and beyond nevervloved Homura.</br></br>  <br>That has nothing to do with what I said.<br><br><br>No. Homura knows what she's doing is wrong. This is symbolized in that scene where black fathers are reflected as white in Homura's eyes.</br></br></br></br>  posting fluff, homuhater obviously is using reverse psychology on us.  <br>Madoka hates Homura.<br><br>Yuri is degeneracy.

I've been putting off seeing it because I watched the 1st episode and the animation really turned me off and the plot was pretty meh imo tbh <br><br>but then again on teh other hand it is one of the greatest anime's according to /a/ and every other series that /a/ has suggested to me (aria, bleach, one piece, infinite stratos) has been really enjoyable</br></br>  <br>I love shitting on Homura and Madoka's nonexistant love. It's a service to the show.<br><br><br>Go back to bed devilslut!</br></br></br></br>  <br>hello best girl</br>  <br>There's only one way to find out.</br>  <br>Watch for best girl if nothing else</br>  chose one homu to homu forever. <br><br>claiming blanket homuhomu</br></br>  <br> infinite stratos <br><br>Tell me who is best girl first.</br></br></br>  <br>Kill all Homus but rape Moemura before slitting her throat.</br>  <br> implying she wouldent kill you first.  <br><br>the only magica stronger than homu is mami, and i dont think you are mami. Homu is the still the sexiest.</br></br></br>  <br>She can only win by betrayals. She's a useless failure, Madoka never loved her.</br>  <br>nope, she wins because she is the best. she did what had to be done.</br>    <br>She ruined everything. Madoka hates her and always will.</br>    KRIEMHILD GRETCHEN &gt; DEVIL HOMU<br><br>HOMURA JUST TOOK AWAY ULTIMATE MADOKA<br><br>IF MADOKA FOCUSES ON THE HATRED AND INADEQUACY IN HER HEART SHE CAN BEAT DEVIL HOMURA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Never. Madoka never loved Homura.</br>    Are the first two rebellion movies worth watching?<br><br>I haven't watched Madoka since it aired but I more or less remember what happens. The important parts, at least.</br></br>  <br>the first two are recaps with better visuals. I say for a first watch it is better to do the series then rebellion. But for a rewatch movie 1,2, and 3 works well.</br>  <br>Out of character degeneracy. Madoka never loved Homura.</br>    <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>    Even if Madoka has a thing with Homura, she'll grow up and let go of her schoolgirl lesbianism and Homura will be that disgusting spinster stalker alcoholic smoker no one wants to associate with.  <br>You're right. Love cannot possibly describe the level of sentimental attachment Madoka feels for Homu.</br>  Eternal reminder  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.<br><br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br></br></br>    <br>But from now on, we should refer to Homura as 'disgusting spinster stalker alcoholic smoker'.</br>  <br>Madoka has no sentimental feelings for Homura. Only hate.<br><br><br>Homura will probably kill Nagisa and Mami will blow her legs off for losing her pedo squeeze.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>If all doujins were true then the ones that involved Madoka being a victim must also be true.</br></br>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.<br><br><br>I just call her "The Slut."</br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks, I heard they barely changed anything but I suppose I should rewatch it anyways.<br><br>I'll give it a try.</br></br></br>    <br><br>That implies Homura is capable of getting laid.</br></br>  <br>She fucks old men for fun, of course she gets laid. She nevers gets made love to though, nobody loves her.</br>      <br>Ugly slut.<br><br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jesus and Satan never fucked each other.</br>    <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  If fanart were canon, then you should go and type in kamijou_kyousuke and kaname_madoka into gelbooru and search there.<br><br>HOMURA BTFO<br>SAYAKA BTFO<br>HITOMI BTFO</br></br></br></br>    <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  <br>I love her.</br>  The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world that MadoHomu is canon.    <br>No you don't.<br><br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your missing the much more important question.<br>When will "The Different Story" get a manga adaption?<br><br>Also, this doesn't get said enough, but Mami is teh best gurl</br></br></br></br>    <br>*ANIME adaption</br>  The task at hand<br>  SECOND SEASON WHEN </br>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.<br><br>Even the retarded namefag  agrees.</br></br></br>  <br> Mami is teh best gurl </br>  <br>Looks like love to me.</br>  <br>buzzclaw is to mami as kevin is to autism, i mean sayaka.</br>  <br> fanart <br>Madoka never loved Homura.<br><br><br>Madoka never loved Homura, the autistic retard is right.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> retarded namefag <br><br>wow, rude</br></br></br>    <br>All the trip/namefags are freaks. Except Apple.<br><br>At least you all hate Homura and know Madoka never loved her.</br></br></br>  <br>See homuhater even treats his allies bad. Homulovers love all magicas and tripfriends. They just like homuhomu a little more.</br>    <br>Homura hates all.<br><br>Madoka never loved her.</br></br></br>  <br>But does homura love madoka?</br>  <br>Well, while the thread is bad at least there's fluff.</br>  <br>No.<br><br><br>They're both straight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, anon. She's the goddess of Megucas and lesbians.</br>  <br> Kyouko and Sayaka going to Comiket <br>What kind of doujin do they buy?<br>Is it weird to buy porn of yourself?</br></br></br>  <br>Madoka is straight and never loved Homura.<br><br><br>They get BBC doujins because they're straight.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are some odd questions.</br>  <br> BBC <br><br>I want /tv/ to leave.</br></br></br>  <br>Sayaka and Kyoko have urges when not being fucked by Kevin and Apple.</br>  <br>I don't see any other guy who I can ship Dokes with. <br><br>I got lazy and I shipped her with Homerun, but a fight between those would be interesting.</br></br></br>  <br>It was just based on what that picture said<br>"ＧｏＧｏコミク"<br>コミク = Comiket.</br></br></br>  <br> BBC <br>British Broadcasting Cablevision?</br></br>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  <br>I get it but I wouldn't know what kind of material they'd purchase probably yuri from other series'.</br>  <br>Okay, I know, but please can you not interrupt the thread, is not correct for it. <br><br>We respect your opinion, but don't try to force us to think that way.<br><br>My English is not so good, but you got me, right, anon?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>    <br>You said that earlier.</br>    <br>Don't bother my ESL friend. Homuhater is never going to leave these threads or stop.<br>Just learn to accept it.</br></br>  <br>Yes I did.<br><br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Your just spamming that phrase now</br>  <br>Because it must be known.<br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  Ok so I'll post what I have of Madohomu to keep homuhater mad.  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  <br>Gott ist NICHT tot. You were close though.</br>  Wow, the shitposting is in full force today.  <br>Is this your first day on 4chan?</br>  <br>That won't be necessary.<br>Reminder, that you're just using Mado Homu images to bait and spite someone.<br>Which puts you on the same level as a shitposter.<br>You're no better than !Akemi.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  <br>I actually just like that ship, but 8 wish we saw red and black work together more</br>  <br>Shh sayaka its okay</br>  Why is this .gif so perfect?  <br>I save it every thread</br>  <br>Because Homu.</br>  <br>Thanks, anon for the advice</br>  <br>Your replying to !Akemi. He's basically playing both sides of the shitposting so he can keep posting and look like he has an excuse.<br><br><br> but 8 wish we <br>I like how you are so single targetly focused on shitposting right now you can hardly type.<br><br>But I do give you props for trying so hard to mask your shitposting by constantly changing the file names so you can pretend to be someone different each time you post it. And it's obvious you do it manually. Because that image was never posted with that unicode name.<br>https://archive.moe/a/search/image/<wbr>rRdcm63bSsz4vAW5qEtXAQ/<br><br><br>But no, you don't like the characters. And it's obvious you don't actually care about them either.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well then why is homu so perfect? Out of all the magicas she looks the most 'normal' so why is she the prettiest and best magica? What makes her so special?</br>  <br> What makes her so special? </br>  <br>I wish I knew how to remove the background from the gif without clusterfucking it.</br>  <br>She's a veteran<br><br>But I think all Megucas are best. Even Homu.</br></br></br>  <br>What did that !Akemi person do to you to make you like this?</br>  <br>It is more than ai yo. It is perfection.</br>  What is Madoka going to do to Homura when she breaks free from her world?  <br>QB looks grossly disproportionate.</br>  <br>tender and loving hymen rupturing</br>  I want to stick my dick in crazy.  <br>Make me like what? Intelligent?<br>I was this way long before I ever met him.<br><br>And his constant shitposting whenever he's around is the problem.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to stick my dick in you.</br>  <br>Brutality love<br><br>Honestly i think mado would forgove her because she will understand why homu did it and understand that although it may have not been the best thing. It was the right thing, done woth the right intentions</br></br></br>  The cutest  <br>Sorry, I don't like dicks. I only like girls.</br>  <br>I want to stick my dick in you</br>  <br>I want to dick my stick in you.</br>  <br>Anon i dont care what you like. Im going to stick my ai yo filled dick in you</br>  <br>I want to stick my dick in you more</br>  I think there will be no sequel. Spin off is possible though. <br><br>Anyway I like Madoka and Homura.</br></br>  <br>I think I want to dick my stick in you the most.</br>  <br>Getting bolder by the day huh?  The answer is still no. </br>  <br>But the homura hater is okay?</br>  What all did Madoka do while she was in America?  Ass.  <br>There are lots of things to do such as practicing gun, eating burgers and etc</br>  I've never seen Madoka being a badass.  <br>Stuff involving freedom.</br>    <br> What is the original timeline before Homu messed everything up </br>  <br>Stealing and throwing Sayak's SG away was pretty much badass tho. She literally killed her temporarily.</br>  <br>It's a side she only shows to me</br>  <br>I'm not the homuhater. <br><br>I love Madohomu man</br></br></br>  <br>The original Homuhater was 100% joking around.<br>!Akemi, the neo homuhater is just shitposting and desperate for attention.</br></br>  <br>Gay marriage</br>  <br> I love Madohomu <br> insults Homura, Madoka, and Kyouko by posting HomuKyou <br><br>Yeah, whatever you say. It's obvious you're lying.</br></br></br></br>  <br>W-what is badass mado like?<br><br>Also trips checked</br></br></br>  <br>Wanting Madoka to be a badass misses the point of her character imo</br>  Which magica is the widest?  <br>So !Akemi is the neo homuhater?</br>    <br>Ban all the shitposters in /a/</br>  <br>Madoka. See </br>      <br>There'd be no one left</br>  <br>Stuff like shooting better than homu, shooting crumbled up trash like a basketball into a trashcan from 20 feet away (very impressive), remembering iconic scenes from anime word for word, and making better tea than mami.<br>Stuff you'd have to see to believe.</br></br>  <br>Doke</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=MPw<wbr>F6YTLLuc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>If mado is so based why does she cry a lot?</br>  Which Homu is the lewdest?  And why is it Nerd Homu?   <br>I like her with her glasses</br>  Madoka never loved Homura folks.  <br>Lots of gunfire and explosions, it gets dust particles in her eyes</br>  <br>Yes. It's pretty easy to tell.<br>!Akemi has only been here for a few months. And only came here around the time Yuuki Yuuna started airing. He didn't have a trip code then, but it will still obvious who he was.<br><br>He got wrecked in an argument his first week here and it has reshaped his life. Because now he spends endless hours shitposting about it. One of the things said in that first argument he has was that he is a degenerate for thinking that sleep around with a lot of people doesn't make you low brow. He then tunnel visioned on that word and now uses it constantly. Note how neo-homuhater always uses the word "degeneracy". <br><br>!Akemi also is well known for trying to copy and mimic people. You can see how he also tries to flip the argument people who are against crack use back at people who post HomuMado. But the problem he only states the conclusion and none of the supporting information that goes with it, thus making the statement false and baseless.<br><br>If you want proof search for OPs with "Yuuki Yuuna" in them and read the first threads. Because there's proof of it in pretty much all of them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't tell her that. It's all she has to live for.</br>  <br>The easiest to say would be akuma. But you may be onto somethig. I have a feeling moemura has another side, far more lewd than akuma</br>  <br>She has a heart unlike edgylords on internet.</br>  <br>Really? I just thoight he was a pedophile.</br>  <br>Hadn't really payed much attention to him until this thread. Shame he doesn't post with his trip since then I could just filter the bastard.</br>  <br>Good, Madoka wants Homura to die.</br>    <br>He also likes his postmodernism Clara dolls theory and getting high while watching anime.</br>  <br>Would searching his trip get same results?</br>  <br>Their fucking faces.</br>   still thinking I'm a pedo tripfag degenerate because I call you all degenerates for shipping characters gayly who hate each other <br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br>  <br>Nope. As of now he is the most predominate crack shitposter to date.<br><br>If you want more proof his identity read someone of the posts while he was using a trip code and said things about how he loves cross over art.<br>Now look at this: https://archive.moe/_/search/image/<wbr>q4V6_0SmxEDbMvYsTFJiJg/<br>and see how it is constantly used as bait. Even obviously so to the point of using phrases like "I'm summoning him." or "crashing the thread."</br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> DO NOT THROW SOULS!!!  <br><br><br><br>NAH, homuhater is another guy. You will notice because I can't into English and I not watched Rebellion.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka never loved Homura. <br>She will learn to love Homura. In time...</br></br>  <br>His trip is banned. And that's because he ban evaded multiple times in the thread where he first got banned for posting about CP.<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/123950<wbr>986/#123960313<br><br>But he blatantly flaunts his ban evading. Read the file name here.<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/125591<wbr>205/#125596996<br><br><br>Yes.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>She never will. She hates Homura and wants her to die.</br>  <br>Does !Akemi speak Spanish fluently like me? <br><br>  Madoka y Homura se aman tanto, que el mundo tuvo que sufrir las consecuencias de su amor.  </br></br></br>  <br>Yup, whatever you say.<br>It still doesn't change the fact you posted HomuKyou while claiming you like HomuMado.<br>Two actions that contradict each other. Because HomuKyou insults the characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br><br> believing ACK-kun's autism <br><br>Did he mention that sleep is for faggots and that he doesn't need sleep because he has multiple personalities? Or that if anyone ever draws anything that even suggests a hint of a non-canon pairing then as a true fan you must blacklist them? Or that he has IRC logs that will bust 4chan wide open but he just squats in a shitty knockoff chan bitching about /a/ moderation?<br><br><br> !Akemi likes THING! <br> SOMEONE posts THING! <br> Could there be another person who likes THING besides !Akemi? <br> Unpossible, it is all the work of !Akemi! <br><br>And then you bitch and moan when someone calls you crack-kun, you autistic hypocrite.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br>  I just want all the banned sick guys to leave at once.  <br>I don't know. But he is a /jp/ poster as well. Which would explain a lot about why he's such a toxic shit poster.<br><br>https://archive.moe/jp/search/tripc<wbr>ode/%21Akemi7npFA/<br>You can see how he forgot to take his trip off while posting once there.</br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The autistic retard is right. Fucking rekt.<br><br>Madoka never loved Homura.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay, so Madoka never loved Homura. But did Sayaka ever love Homura?</br>  <br> retarded /co/ shitposter trying to act smart <br>Sorry. You really can't have any say on anything until you own up to your stupid mistakes like saying that what's left is subjective (not relative). <br><br>Yeah, it's pretty obvious that if you draw crack and insult he characters you're not an actual fan of the series.<br><br>Not to mention that everyone has those logs. Because they are public.<br><br>Lastly. I've watched !Akemi shitpost since the day he got here. I know fairly well what I'm talking about. The constant mimicking of using the word "degenerate" is an obvious tell. Like I have already said. Feel free to actually read the posts that have already been written.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's funny. Because threads wouldn't be nearly as bad as they are not if they were moderated properly.<br>Because Troid constantly protected baiters and shitposters they think their behavior is perfectly fine. Thus constantly do it.<br><br><br><br>Stop replying to yourself.<br><br>And you know all the reasons you're a scumbag. You just ignore it and keep on going.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck no, she hates her bad, for good reason. But Sayaka is only slightly better so Homu is right to hate the blue cunt.</br>  Does falling in love with her make me a borderline lolicon?  <br>No, she's pretty hot as well as cute, nothing wrong. It's just triggering your brain's "fuck and protect" response.</br>  <br> is liking short girls with big tits being a lolicon <br><br>If liking short girls period makes you a lolicon, then I guess most tall men are lolicons</br></br></br>  <br>It's a side effect of seeing a character voiced by Kana Asumi, you're going to make it OP.</br>  Are you sexually attracted to her because she looks and acts like a child?  So what does everyone think of the show so far?  if you fall in love with Poplar that makes you an arborcon  <br>What were her parents thinking</br>  <br> borderline lolicon  <br> shes in high school <br> haven't accepted your true calling  <br>maybe this isnt working OP</br></br></br></br>  <br>Judging from Poplar, they probably don't think at all.</br>  I want to FUCK Poplar's MIDGET ASSHOLE  She's got boobs, its cool  <br>She is legal, so no.</br>  <br>shes short and busty</br>  <br> For you <br><br>She's not a very big girl</br></br></br>   people don't know what "loli" is <br>Saddening.</br>  <br>It's the same people who call Hestia a oppai loli.</br>  <br> oppai loli <br>Literally the worst thing humanity has ever created</br></br>  <br>No son, you've finally become a man.</br>  <br>She is.<br>calling someone shorty or baby faced and taking on cow it's fit's the bill of an oppai loli.</br></br>  <br>It's a stupid joke that became a stupid meme that ruined the loli tags on pixiv, the boorus, and sad panda. Things should not have gone that far.</br>    <br>It makes you a man with excellent taste.</br>  <br>I want to  hold her hand  and  stroke my fingers through her hair </br>  <br>So fluffy.</br>  <br>This image would have been perfect if that bitch Kazue wasn't in it ruining it with her stupid ugly face.</br>  js06 translated more shit, come see Touma being perfect.    <br>Back to Facebook</br>  <br>It's ok anon, I know it'll never happen but we can dream</br>  <br>So Othinusfags really are just shippers.</br>  <br>What if you liked her before the end of NT9?</br>  Is this Wasted Potential: The Show?  blue eye shadow is god tier<br>prove me wrong</br>  <br> yfw no one will ever love your shitty show the way you do. </br>  <br>In a lot of ways, yeah, but I still enjoyed it. Replace the unnecessary philosophical stuff (not all of it, just the stuff that really didn't fit well) with character development for Raul, Daedalus, and the Reagent and it would improve loads.</br>  Story was great, storytelling was poor.  Kickass soundtrack though<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gMo<wbr>bOPSmZjc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I just don't understand half of the shit they're trying to get at. It's like the said "we want to make a cool looking anime, how do we do that?", instead of making an actual cool anime. I mean so far I'm enjoying the atmosphere of it, but not much else. <br><br><br>COME AND SAAAAAAAAAAAAAVE</br></br></br></br>  <br>From what I can remember, a lot of it is about the reason for someone's being. Though there are far better ways to get it across.</br>  <br>No. I'd say it tried to be clever, tried to be deep, but it only ended up to be an annoying, pretentious show.<br><br>Like Tatami Galaxy, actually. Always saw that as a glorified Endless Eight for hipsters.</br></br></br>  I tried THREE TIMES to get into this, I never got further than episode 3.<br><br>It's got everything I usually like, but I found it super fucking boring.</br></br>  <br>But Tatami Galaxy succeeded at that.

At the fountain they cropped off the tits as well as the upper portion of the head. Shit was disorienting.  <br> maybe get his autograph <br><br>Please anon, if you send in a self-portrait and your favorite monster-girl he might even add you to the manga.<br><br>He did it with the Onsen and Farm, it might happen again.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Was really hoping to meet him during my Japan trip, but it doesn't seem like he goes to many events.</br>  <br>That's what it looked like to me. That second close up of Darling during the ice cream scene seemed unnecessary too.</br>  <br><br>I've suggested the idea before, but at the moment I'm thinking of heading up the project here on /a/:<br><br>My idea is to send Okayado a digital care-package.<br><br>Have it be a compendium of some of the best artwork that natives of /a/ and other boards have produced for Monster Musume, and send him a short note (translated into proper, grammatically correct Japanese) that basically says that his fiction really means something to us and that he has fans in the West that love what he does.<br><br>I think that would mean a lot to him.<br><br> I'm still debating on whether or not the information we include should acknowledge that the project was organized by members of 4chan or not. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>hope for the BDs then, I was upset that chris' head was in front of everything</br></br>  <br>it might sound stupid but I tried to think of a way to make it dating sim-esque in the premise, cheese included<br><br>the protagonist is a guy who has  met with a terrible fate  and is sent to a high school for monstergirls/boys (dont worry there's only one relevant male character and he's a bro) where he must find true love while wondering how the fuck lamias use the toilet</br></br></br>  I have no idea why, but for some reason the anime is making me cringe to no end. I could read the manga fine, even laugh along to it, but when I watch the anime I cringe harder than I've ever cringed. Is this happening to anybody else? The anime's quality is fucking awesome, no doubt, but something in it is hitting some deep hatred I never knew I had. Pic related, my face when Miia said she came in the first episode.  <br><br>Find out where he lives and stalk him.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to bully him, but I certainly hope he can make it to a Con is the US.</br>  <br> Not wanting to bully him <br><br>Crabman is made to be bullied</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know about that lol but if anyone does know a mailing address, they'd have my thanks. Just a way to let the crabman know his work is appreciated</br>   nee darling   <br>I want to call you a fag. But I can kinda see where you are coming from.   fag.  </br>  <br><br>Even if he comes to a Con in the US, it will assuredly be too far away from where I live to make it financially viable for me to get there.<br><br>Cons themselves seem to be expensive enough these days, but traveling cross-country on top of that just makes it completely nonviable.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Pic related, my face when Miia said she came in the first episode. <br><br>It's probably because you're fine with the manga's subject matter since it's just print, but the moment you realize actual people are saying the stuff you read it's weird.<br><br><br><br>Aren't crabs typically bullied in Japanese media, anyway? I've yet to see a crab in an anime or manga that wasn't kicked, mocked or otherwise used for bully material.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would be cool.</br>  <br>I narrowed it down to Saitama. He doesn't have much of a social media presence. He does seem to do a signing with every volume release though, you should be able to find him around 8/12.</br>  I want to be an aeronautics expert specializing in ass-based propulsion  <br>have you never heard of Patreon, they fund flash style adult-games all the time<br><br>also that sounds like Rosario+Vampire</br></br></br>   mfw episode 1 <br>I DON'T EVEN LIKE MONSTER GIRLS SO WHAT'S WITH THIS BONER</br>  What was the estimated amount of chapters that would be converted into anime form?  <br> that sounds like rosario+vampire <br><br>a bit yeah, but I figured the MC not being a retard and the girls not being just humans with the monster title and shonen powers made it different enough</br></br></br>  <br>Because Miia a cute.</br>  <br>Up to Lala's introduction</br>  <br>A Canadian showed up to his first sign event if thats what you're talking about.</br>  http://bato.to/read/_/332908/neko-m<wbr>usume-michikusa-nikki_v7_ch40_by_ha<wbr>banero-scans</wbr></wbr>  <br><br>It's hard to tell, since I doubt EVERY episode will feature two chapters, since some chapters don't seem like they could be boiled down to 11 minutes.</br></br>  <br>It's her damned voice.

After that, she's been more careful. Compare that to characters like Cera who routinely give him horse-kicks to the chest, both on accident and on purpose for things as simple as forgetting to knock.<br><br> jealous <br>Miia's not any more jealous than any other woman should be. She loves her Darling and doesn't want to lose him.<br><br> cold blooded <br>This is valid. But having a cold-blooded girl can be nice to snuggle with. Plus, it gives her a REASON to snuggle with you more.<br><br> bitchy <br>Miia's one of the most agreeable and fun people in a current anime-series.<br><br> snake woman <br>But that's the best part of her, after her personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Wasn't that in one of her daydreams though?</br>  <br><br> not being able to tuck in panties decently <br>So sad.</br></br></br>  There is legitimately no girl better than Miia.  <br>Wrong.</br>  <br>Parpy no Happy no Best Ass</br>  <br> seafoam green panties <br><br>Patrician taste Papi.</br></br></br>  <br>Someone post papi no harpy no papi papi pa webm</br>  <br>Why was she adjusting her panties at the doorframe?</br>  <br>Do you not check to make sure you look decent one last time before going out?</br>  <br>I remember that thread and the post. Loen confirmed for being awesome.</br>  <br>Yeah, but isn't that something you should do before you're half outside? Doesn't she have a mirror in her room? Birds like mirrors, right?</br>  <br>Cerea intentionally kicked him when he tried to mount her two minutes after meeting her. As for the not knocking, it's not so different from a woman slapping someone who walks in on her naked. Just deadlier. Aside from those two cases, Cerea hasn't kicked him again, to my knowledge(maybe trampled him when all the girls beat him up thinking he'd impregnated Papi).</br>  <br>Spider.</br>  <br>Cerea you mean.</br>  <br> tfw I have this fetish <br> tfw never found any good porn of it anywhere </br></br>  <br>What was its name?</br>  <br><br> I remember that thread and the post. <br><br>I missed it.<br>Was there anything special about it?

She deserved that status when she stopped being in her small form whenever she wanted to do lewd, effectively making Papi the only small girl against half a dozen big girls.</br>  <br><br> As for the not knocking, it's not so different from a woman slapping someone who walks in on her naked. <br><br>It's still an impulsive and cunty thing to do.<br>Especially when ONE horse-kick to the chest can kill a man.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And so the shit-flinging begins.<br>MJ movies popcorn.png</br></br>  <br><br><br>Papi is the best.</br></br></br>  <br> this is what snakefags think about all the girls </br>  <br>You could always try /d/.</br>  <br><br> the woman who was ready to turn Darling over to a stranger that wanted to murder him <br><br> better than the woman that was fully ready to die to protect him </br></br></br></br>  This show would be a billion times better if the faggot MC was replaced by a cute tomboy   You will never be this happy <br>;_;</br>  <br>It's legitimate self defense.

She is my hero  <br>No you fucking moron, I'm not the crack-ship shitposter. If your grasp on language is this poor then I don't know why I bothered talking to you in the first place. How the hell could you even confuse his posts with mine unless all English looks like the same unintelligible garbage to you? Also, funny how the non-meme subs translated that line as I did verbatim. <br><br>If it makes you feel better I asked a couple Japanese friends. It's not inherently sexual or worded awkwardly like you claim it is. It's just people making silly pun comics like always. Keep on being an idiot.</br></br></br>  Is Hibiki that dumb or is her self-esteem really that low?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> her self-esteem really that low </br>  Maybe not a hero but she's a yuri magnet   The only good part of Gbeat is the whistling    <br><br>Hibiki is the friend magnet, Tsubasa is the one dripping in bitches.</br></br>  <br>Yes and everything after that.<br><br>It's by far the best Hibiki song.</br></br></br>  I don't get it. All of the main characters have sad backstory yet I can't seem to give a shit about them.  <br> Implying that alone doesn't make it God-tier <br> Implying the rest isn't also amazing. </br></br>  <br><br> on her third waifu <br><br>Why is Tsubasa such a massive slut?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The way she yells that first TAKANARE is the best.</br>  <br>That means you lack empathy; one of the most basic of all human emotions. You might actually be autistic. I'd get myself checked if I were you.</br>  <br><br>I demand more battle bagpipes in my hibiki songs!</br></br>  <br>I don't get why people that don't understand Japanese nor English fully try to weigh in on this stuff. More than likely Commie perfectly understood the line and went with the more humorous interpretation as they tend to do. <br><br><br>You have shit taste the the only part of the song that I would change is the "lets shout" it sounds to cutesy for the song</br></br></br></br>  Durandal <br>One of the very few complete relics. It has been designated as the 5th relic. <br><br>Several years ago when the European Union was on the brink of economic collapse, the Japanese government was able to take possession of Durandal under the condition that it would shoulder a portion of the EU's large debt. <br><br><br>FUCKING GREECE!</br></br></br></br></br></br>   anons talk about G-Beat  <br> have to now listen to it again </br>  <br>Commies was the actual line, but with more flowery language. H&amp;D interpreted Maria's intention from the line, rather than what she says.</br>  <br>Swords need to be in a sheath when they aren't fighting.</br>  <br>TAKANARE</br>  <br> G-BEAT! </br>  <br> Commies was the actual line <br>1:1 translations are usually shit.<br><br> but with more flowery language <br>But with an unfunny joke as always.<br><br> H&amp;D interpreted Maria's intention from the line <br>Yes, H&amp;D actually translated the line into English that reflects the intent, meaning and inflection of the speaker and doesn't mess with tone. That's called a translation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You have that completely backwards</br>  <br> Wake up <br> Have to listen to G-Beat <br> Go to work <br> Listen to G-Beat while working <br> Have to fight an intense urge to attack my coworkers while singing loudly <br>Today was a tough day.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will the shuttle song be released?  <br>September 30.</br>  <br>Backwards, but your point it right, that Commie is correct. H&amp;D specifically translates more directly to allow for us to make up the rest with context, where as Commie translates and reworks it into the sentence that they think the character is trying to convey.</br>    <br>September 30th, with the first BD.<br><br> Info pastebin for that stuff <br> http://pastebin.com/EeTkSpKa </br></br></br></br>  <br>Why did Chris wear lingerie to the beach?</br>   still no FLAC rips of hibiki's charasongs <br><br>What are they doing over there in japan</br></br>  <br> and reworks it into the sentence that they think the character is trying to convey. <br>But no one cares what commie thinks the characters voices should be interpreted as. They just want the characters words to be translated accurately and reflect the original Japanese. I don't need every other line to be some stupid joke or over-localized slang because it "sounds better" or some idiot thinks it's funny.</br></br>  <br> They just want the characters words to be translated accurately and reflect the original Japanese. <br><br>Which is what commie does. If you want a word to word mapping of Japanese to English then put the lines in google translate because that's not translation.</br></br></br>  <br>What's funny is the line doesn't even sound better in Commies version it's more awkward if anything. Maybe the people that think otherwise don't speak with others in English on a daily basis but borrowing someone to talk to is a common phrase.</br>  <br>If I remember right, one of H&amp;D's mission statements was to be as literal of a translation as they could get; which is why the liberal rewrite is so out of place.<br><br>The way H&amp;D and Commie basically shifted positions (more literal vs more liberal) for this one line is what strikes me as weird.</br></br></br>  <br>Standard issue uniform from her previous job.</br>  <br> Which is what commie does <br>No they don't. They literally insert jokes because they think they're funny and project their ideas of character personality onto the script.</br></br>  <br>Hibiki is definitely a hero and needs more people to tell her that.</br>  Where are her pants?  <br>I LOVE HIBIKI<br> 2 waifus ruining my laifu </br></br>  <br>She doesn't want to be a hero. She just wants to protect people.</br>  <br><br>It's lonely being alone</br></br>  <br>H&amp;D was a literal translation of the line, clearly you are not savy with your runes but she did not say she was gonna go fuck Tsubasa in the back seat.</br>  <br>Loli needs no pantsu.</br>  <br>H&amp;D isn't translating the words literally, they're translating the meaning of the words literally. If you saw 肌 and 脱ぐ next to each other in a sentence and tried translating the words literally, you'd be completely wrong. The was H&amp;D does things is right.</br>  <br>You're gonna break her</br>  I like characters in a world that people use weapons like guns and swords and shit. <br>They punch hard, that's all they got.

When does Kanadoise kill Maria?  <br>It's kind of ironic that Hibiki said she wanted to fight to protect her daily normal life yet the more she fights the further she gets away from it.</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>I don{t know why but I want Hibiki call Kanade "mom"</br>  <br><br>Hey, I guess Chris gets another taste of the pie</br></br>  <br>I sent them my application but they rejected me because I said that I'd kidnap Aoi Yuki and  feed her ice cream and pat her on the head. </br>  <br> finally accept kanade is never coming back <br> decide i might as well find a new favorite geah <br> eventually settle on maria <br> kanade comes back evil, kills maria, is herself killed for good <br>At that point I would assume the writers were fucking with me.</br></br></br></br></br>  How does one become as cool as Tsubasa-senpai  <br>Always be ready for battle</br>  <br><br> six eggs <br><br>oh god Hibiki what are you even doing</br></br></br></br>  <br>#Stopbikeabuse</br>  <br>That line is a season 1 reference, but also a reference to a very old Japanese drama's line.<br>Because Aoi was very young that she didn't watch that drama, Kaneko asked Genjuro's VA to teach Aoi how to voice it.</br></br>   Phara breaks swords <br> Maria makes swords blush <br>HEAVEN OR HELL<br>DUEL 1 <br>LETS ROCK!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Skin's turning red. <br> Still smiling. <br>Why is Hibiki such an M?</br></br></br>  <br>Maria is out of commission.</br>  <br><br>Tsubasa will be there for her Kouhai when the time comes.</br></br>  <br>Men need their protein.

Hibiki 2. Tsubasa 3. Chris 4. Maria 5. Shirabe 6. Kirika <br>Anon, there's six  seven if we count Miku   eight if we count Kanade  </br></br></br>  <br>Shirabe and Kirika count as one.</br>  <br>DMJii are one character</br>  <br> implying Shirabe &amp; Kirika aren't one character </br>  <br>1. Hibiki 2. Tsubasa 3. Chris 4. Miku 5. Kanade <br><br>Disregard FiS <br><br>Perfect 5 heroines</br></br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Maria was created based on Kanade, Kanade didn't exist in Agematsu's note. So it must be Shirabe and Kirika.</br></br>  <br>Maria gear where?</br>    <br><br>I'd explore the past of her main character, if you get what I mean</br></br>    <br>Miku and Kanade were created by Kaneko. They didn't exist in Agematsu's note.</br>  <br>2lewd4me</br>    <br>Or none of them existed in the form they are today in the first place so it's pointless. Unless he released the original notes somewhere it just says 5 heroines which could of been anyone.</br>  <br>Believe what you want to believe I guess.<br>It's all mentioned in Design Work book, s1 Voice book and LisuAni.</br></br>  <br>So Kirika and Shirabe are in said book?</br>  In terms of breeding material, I think we can all agree that:<br><br>Maria &gt; Chris &gt; Kirika &gt; Hibiki &gt; Miku &gt; Shirabe &gt; Tsubasa</br></br>  <br>In episode 10 Hibiki says the same thing again, and it's really sweet that time. It even has one of those parts where Miku says something romantic and you don't see Hibiki's face in reaction.</br>  <br> Satan has shit taste <br>Color me surprised</br></br>  <br>Nope. Only Kanade and Miku were mentioned by Agematsu, Nana, Minami and Kaneko. But Agematsu said he wanted to let people see those 2 gear users who were removed by Kaneko if he got chance to make season 2 in s1 voice book interview. Also Mikugeah was Satelight's producer's idea according to s2 voice book interview.</br>  <br><br>You can't impregnate swords you baka</br></br>  <br>Miku looks so happy. And distant. She's never, ever going to let go.</br>  <br>Can't wait for the obligatory sunshine talk. I wonder under what situation, Hibiki'll say it this time, can't think of anything happy.</br>  <br>There will be no sunshine this season.</br>     Goods tab updated <br> It's just a shitty card game </br>  <br>Weiss/Schwarz?</br>  Carol is cute. She's like a fluffy, angry little ball of seething rage and hatred.  And she has an awesome hat. <br><br>The Befisting can't come soon enough.</br></br>  <br>Of course.</br>  We are still reading this right?  <br>Checking dubs</br>    <br>Why?<br>A militantly loyal slutty oppai loli tomboy would have been the best thing.

What did you think of this?  <br>Most of /u/ are bisexual and lesbians females so thanks for calling us morons asshole. <br><br>Anyway that was before the end, most people moved on already. People only post in there for recent fanart and fanfics, since there is quite a lot. But honestly people just talk about the couple.

Are there even any men left on this site?</br></br>  <br>Most people posting that shit here are shitposters baiting gullible retards, sure. But there's plenty of legitimate crazies as well. Just a couple of days ago someone on /u/ tried to organize a raid on Hibike's Wikipedia article.</br>  <br>It's chill landwhale. Do as you please, but refrain from saying shit like this<br><br>it's annoying</br></br></br>  <br> bisexual <br>Is this really a thing?</br></br>  New Overlord Thread from <br><br>Preferable with more Narberal</br></br>  <br>Yes, because asking for a chair turned out so well the last time</br>  <br>The tension comes not from Papa Bones, but from the people in the mortal kingdoms dealing with Papa Bones.</br>  <br>Other posters cleared it up very well, but let me make a good comparison between another popular series on /a/.<br><br>You know One Punch Man? Saitama is the main character, but he isn't the main motivator of the story. He serves as a catalyst for the growth of other characters around him and gives us the reason for their exposition and challenges. <br><br>If saitama were by himself and the author never expanded on the characters that he fights OPM would be boring as hell because we already know how the fights are going to turn out. That's why just about every other chapter completely ignores saitama and skips to one villain's tragic past or another heroe's reason to fight.<br><br>This series depends on similar exposition of Papa Bone's guardians and the humand (and non-human) kingdoms around him trying their best to adjust to his sudden magnificence and strength.<br><br>Papa Bones is a character, but he's more aptly a motivator for the character's around him.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why? It would lessen the whole build up of Ainz and the members of the Nazarack if a bunch of scrubs could give them any trouble. It's fun seeing these arrogant antagonist be turned into mewling infants before a being of true might, not to mention Papa Bone's hug was great.</br>  <br>It doesn't have to be scrubs. Hell, Ainz doesn't even have to meet them, but the story needs a fucking antagonist. He needs a foil, one that the readers feel can put up a fight against him or threaten his friends at least.<br><br>That's why OPM works, the bad guys still wreck his friends and his home. They still feel dangerous, where as Clementine? We knew the entire time she couldn't do anything to him because he's undead. And let's not even talk about the archangel. Nabel? That was an exercise in restraint and was boring because of it.</br></br></br>  What's the point in Gardes linking up like this?  To go faster, duh.</blockquote>]
