Really?</br>  <br> to look like a slut <br> look <br><br>Nami is a slut. It's one of the few cases in anime when you can't call her a slut to just to insult her, that's exactly what she is.<br><br>Nami doesn't feel romantic love for anyone, she would sell her body to fat old men just to have some money</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>*reason</br>  <br>Nice head canon you got there.</br>  <br><br>You shouldnt use the figurine as a critique of her design<br><br> 0 gravity tits <br> 0 gravity neck </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She flashed people for money and as a kid offered to pay for things with her body. That's pretty slutty.</br>  <br>Those pirates who took on Arlong Park?<br>A bunch of kids. Kid's with promise but kids all the same.<br><br>The pirates who left Sabaody and took on the New Fishmen Pirates? A crew fit for the Pirate King. Designs that imply determination and confidence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is supposed to be on a journey from an ordinary boy to a pirate. So along the course of the series, his clothes will become more and more piratey. Longer jacket, sash, pants, boots, tricorn hat, and probably, by the end of the series, the famed eyepatch.<br>On pic related you can clearly see Oda wasn't quite sure at first of exactly how much more piratey Luffy should be after the timeskip. He made multiple variations and settled for the tamest one.</br></br>  <br> Implying any redesign happens for any reason other than to sell more merchandise </br>  <br>Here. The tits are literally the same size.</br>  <br>Entities which lurked the Florian Triangle long before Moriah arrived, and were the cause of the ships disappearing within. Whatever they are, they absolutely dwarf the likes of Oars/Sanjuan Wolf, as well as Thriller Bark itself which is probably similar size to Dressrosa.</br>  <br>my brain. it hurts.<br><br>how can anyone that has followed One Piece this far be so fucking dense??<br><br>Awesome  gets it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We saw Bonney just before Dressrosa started, eating pizza and reading the newspaper about Law and Luffy's alliance.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127869131 <br>long hair makes every woman a lot prettier</br>  <br>That's neat, I like it. I hope by the end of the journey he'll get a coat to, in strong world was amazing</br>  <br>To slowly weaken Blackbeard's forces from the inside, or use Blackbeard's additional force to make his task of taking out the remaining 6th level prisoners in the world somewhat easier.</br>  <br> post-skip Namis tits are a lot bigger than pre-skip <br>Another myth busted, nice</br></br>  So Im on episode 7, when does this show start to get better? This begging is weak, but there have been cool moments.  <br>My favourite was "Why doesn't Zoro smile anymore?!"</br>  <br>A few arcs in.<br><br>Some will say during Kuro, some will say during Baratie. If your not in by the end of Arlong Park then you wont be at all</br></br></br>  <br>People who hate on post-ts Nami are mostly tumblrinas who hate the fact that her outfit is more revealing because of muh sexism</br>  <br>After the dressrosa arc</br>  <br>Read it.</br>  <br>Stop watching the anime and read the manga, its for your own good</br>  <br><br>Why lads?</br></br>  <br> back facing one of Luffy <br> it's the pirate symbol he drew for the flag <br>I hope he has that shirt lying around.</br></br></br>  <br>Oda isn't exactly consistent when it comes to breast size.</br>  <br>Fight me irl faggot</br>  <br>Around episode 300 the pacing gets utterly horrible and a bit later the drawings and animation are extremely low budget most of the time</br>  <br>Quality's better, less filler and around episode 300-400 the pacing drops to the floor.<br>It's basically a slideshow now.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=OF0<wbr>MZ6FH67g</wbr>  [ ]<br>Shouldn't be many spoilers (if at all).</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The manga is the original material, you dont have to put up with shit animation, shit art and filler.<br><br>Same reason in you wanted to judge a sng you'd listen to the original version, not a version produced by underpaid sweatshop animators.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook has actually been useful in every arc since he joined. It was just not as spectacular as some stuff other chracters did.</br>  <br>I want more badass Brook moments</br>  <br>You can read the first 700 chapters in glorious color on Batoto</br>  <br><br>But the anime has a God Tier OST<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=sYK<wbr>owP0WEIc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br>Then listen to it while reading the manga.</br>  <br>Already complaining 7 eps in? You should be hooked by now.</br>  <br>He still gets them some times. More for sure though.</br>  <br><br>Well get used to it because you're going to hear a lot of it while background characters gasp and tremble for 5 seconds to every line from the manga</br></br>  <br>Its okay I guess, Luffy is a mad cunt which regularly destroys my sides.</br>  why doesn't his power also knock out all his opponents? wouldn't his fruit technically slow all blood circulation?  <br>Have you encountered our Lord and Saviour Buggy-sama yet?</br>  <br> Luffy is a mad cunt <br><br>You don't even know.</br></br></br>  <br>Magic nigga.<br>How is Luffy alive when he's made of rubber?</br></br>  <br>Buggy just got rekt for fucking with the hat, also a side terminator.</br>  <br>Zoro's dimple is so kawaii</br>  <br> no captain's coat for Luffy post TS <br>That bummed me out a little.</br></br>  So by know we've all realized that Kaido isn't human<br>What animal is he and what fruit does he have?</br>  <br> What animal is he and what fruit does he have? <br>It really is still anyone's guess.<br>You'll get nothing but wild speculation.<br><br>Anyone who claims near certainty on this issue is a fool.</br></br></br></br></br>  I bet Drake will end up in alliance with Law and Luffy as a thanks for defeating Doflamingo, who he probably hates a lot more than he admits.<br>(Oda wouldn't place him in Law's flashback for no reason.)</br>  <br>He's a human with a zoan who prefers to remain in his hybrid form, thus being called a "beast/creature". I don't believe that was his silhouette we saw this chapter.</br>   Works for Mam now <br>Goddamn it I had hopes for him.<br><br>What's left for Drake &amp; Capone now they've both sold out.</br></br></br>  <br>He seems perfectly content working under Kaido though.</br>  <br>It doesn seem very strange he doesn't have a grudge against Doffy...unless his father was an asshole.</br>  <br>He's one of the few recurring "villains".<br>You'll start loving his shenanigans.</br></br>  <br>Can't wait until he's revealed and there's suddenly a wave of:<br> I knew that <br> It was so obvious <br> You'd have to be a retard to think otherwise <br> Really obvious there Oda, getting lazy are you? </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> well-designed <br>yes<br> interesting <br>meh<br> useful <br>not yet</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didn't seem to like Barrels much though; he even ditched him before he died.</br>  <br><br>Just makes the eventual payoff sweeter</br></br>  <br> Works for Mam now <br><br>Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br>All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar.</br></br></br></br>  <br> concerned <br>*confirmed, obviously</br></br>  <br>I hate retards like you.</br>  <br>She's the navigator, they'd be dead several times over without her. <br><br>I agree her design is shit now, her boobs may not have gotten bigger but she shows them way more so they appear that way. Completely removes the uniqueness of her character. Same with Robin in my opinion, both their new hairstyles turned Robin (my favourite character) to below Zoro and Luffy, and Nami who I appreciated for being Nami not looks like a random slut. Fucking hate it. Oh well, at least Franky got a badass Robot.</br></br></br>  <br>Aw, how cute. <br>I hate shitposters like you too.  ;^) </br></br>  So Urouge met Enel right?  <br>Was Arlong Park the last time Nami had a proper clothes?</br>  <br>Enel is probably still on the moon. If he were to come back though, I see him going down to the blue sea.<br><br>Perhaps this is how he's reintroduced through. I just can't see him being "rational" and wanting to meet someone in such a way.</br></br></br>  <br>It's this guy.</br>  <br>What makes you think he's wanting to meet someone?<br>They said somebody's here not somebody wants to meet you</br></br>  <br>I don't remember having problems with her until post-time skip, but now that I think about it she was probably wearing a bra after most of Arlong yeah. What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service?? I assure you, Nami's breasts aren't what I'm fucking watching it for.</br>  <br>Oh right, I must have read it with someone being there to see them.</br>  <br> google image search <br> Nami water 7 <br> Nami enies lobby <br> Nami sabaody <br> all have shirts on </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>interesting idea<br>proof?</br></br>  <br>Probably stems from the fact he has wings and is likely from the sky islands (or has some angel zoan).</br>  <br>Blackbeard's crew is after pirates for their powers and Lafitte has shown to have the ability to fly.<br>Urouge in particular has a power to convert damage into power. Since he's a Skypeian, Lafitte is the only one able to track him reliably.</br></br>  <br> is likely from the sky islands <br><br>Wasnt he a cop in some blue? And those wings dont look like those stubby little things sky islanders have on their back, even the ones on the moon hieroglyphs in the cover story had different wings.<br>It has to be a DF.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not confirmed yet. Implied, yes, but still far from concerned. <br> All we can gather from the chapter is that they are near big moms ship and are after ceasar. <br><br> he's after Ceasar on his own <br> doesn't work for Mam at all <br> wants to make a killing on the black market with Ceasar's drugs and other shit <br> Capone has gone full Broker during the timeskip <br> Wants to be the kingpin of the underworld, harking back to his namesake <br><br>Holy fucking shit please god yes.<br>I believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Reminder that Luffy has been in the New World for 3 FUCKING DAYS and he already captured the second most famous scientist in the world, defeated a Shichibukai an one of the most influential person in the New World, formed alliance with countless rookies and managed to piss off the whole fucking world<br><br>Why haven't you accepted Luffy as your lord and saviour</br></br>  <br>I wouldn't be surprised if Lafitte already has a devil fruit and it's Rosinante's. He was able to enter a room with VA's and Shichibukai's without any of them noticing after all.</br>  <br>Just because he lived there doesn't mean he's from there.</br>  <br>Luffy becoming Pirate King in two weeks confirmed.</br>  <br>Not sure, seems like Oda has something in store for him though.<br><br>What worries me more now is Bonney.<br>She's stealing food in the street like a homeless person...she's still pirate right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, pirates do steal shit.</br>  <br>He's also declared War on two yonkou, basically.<br><br>I love Luffy sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>Probably on the run from the marines.</br>  <br>Oda sent a skypeian to a lightning island<br><br>It has to be enel</br></br></br>  <br>It slows the rate their bodies use oxygen and nutrition as well.</br>   Apoo/Hawkins/Kidd confirmed ded   Guesses on why Shanks? Will luffy stop this if he learns i wonder  <br>I'm sure he will.<br><br>Not that Luffy would want to protect Shanks.<br>More that Luffy would consider Shanks "his to beat".<br><br>Either way this sets up the Kidd/Hawkins/Apoo alliance is official Strawhat enemies now.<br>Things could get fun.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Who was Ace's first mate before he joined WB pirates  <br> Guesses on why Shanks? <br><br>they probably think he's the most calm and laid back while the other threes are out of their fucking minds. I guess they really didn't think that through if that's their reasoning.<br><br>Luffy knows Shanks can handle it by himself, but I'm sure he would get against Kidd and co because he wants to defeat Shanks himself and cannot allow them to try before him</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Same hair, scar and lost an arm <br>Daddy issues obviously</br></br>  <br>It's unconfirmed, but I actually think Urogue might be Birkan like Enel. That's make things more interesting if he went down to the blue sea before Enel blew Birka out of existence.</br>  <br>Why does everyone forget Killer?<br><br>Also, I wonder if Shanks laughed at Kid?</br></br></br>  <br>Probably because messing with Shanks would piss off less people than in comparison to Kaidou and Big Mom. Big Mom and Kaidou probably have more allies and connections in the new world than Shanks does.</br>  <br>Poor killer, can never eat meat.</br>  <br>These are really cool looking. Got any other images depicting the other crew members with different TS designs?</br>  yfw shanks convinces apoo/basil/Kidd to join him on an alliance to take out Blackbeard, the remnants of the WB pirates are also in it too  <br> kidd and the others arrive to shanks and decide to go full out on him <br> yfw he doesn't even move and simply releases his conqueror's haki power to bring them to their knees <br><br>it's unlikely because Kidd, Hawkins and co would seem like total retards but god it would be great</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off.<br><br>Lucky Roo is gonna blow Kidd's brains out and kill every single supernova crew member by himself.<br><br>Lucky Roo ain't a nice guy and extremely brutal and efficient,</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blackbeard is so hot right now.<br>Shanks called this years ago so I can see him marshaling forces against him.<br><br>Then again, I think all the yonkou save BB will fall.<br>New era and all that.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Big Mom was having a sea battle with Urouge and Capone.<br>Urouge went in the clouds that just happen to be a sky island to recup.<br>Then Sanji gave Caesar to big mom and talked to Capone to tell him he wants his help getting Caesar back.<br>And he's now in the sky getting Urouge to help him.<br><br><br>So basically it's Sanji that's in the clouds.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>would be too powerlevely</br>  <br><br>Blackbeard is a literal pirate. He's in it for booty, plunder and fun, unlike pretty much anyone else in the cast.</br></br>  <br>That is a lot of stuff to happen offscreen.</br>  <br>He's not a captain.</br>  <br> Sanji jobbed and has to ask side characters solve his issues. <br><br>Believable.</br></br></br>  <br>He's in it for dreams.</br>  <br>Neither is Zoro, but they're both Supernovas who are more powerful than Urouge, Bonney and Capone.</br>  <br>Enies Lobby Nami barely had a shirt on. Remember how she changed into her "bra uniform" on the train.</br>  Luffy didn't get involved when he heard Ace got rekt.<br>He did want to get involved once the marines announced they were going to kill him.<br><br>So it's going to be the same with Shanks. He's gonna be like meh it's his problem until BB shows up rapes the kidhawpoo alliance and kidnaps shanks takes him to Raftel to execute him and videosnails his execution to the world. Until Luffy shows up and shit.</br></br></br>  <br>We'll get a flashback that shows it all eventually.</br>  will sanji defeat big mum?  <br>Had a vest on though iirc.</br>  <br>No, he doesn't hit women. He'll beat the shit out of her crew though.</br>  <br>yeah but the alliance is named after the captains. If Kid/Apoo/Hawkins go down it means Killer is going down too because he's part of Kid's crew.</br>  <br>Yes, the guy who had his leg almost broken by Vergo and got fodderized by Doflamingo will defeat a fucking Emperor, you fucking retard</br>  <br><br>This is true.</br></br>  <br>Underrated post</br>  <br> Next weeks big reveal is Sanji in the clouds <br><br>I'd be okay with that. He'd finally get a chance to do something.</br></br></br>  <br>My point is that if you're listing supernovas, you can't exclude Killer and Zoro because they are also two of the eleven.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br>he wasn't using his full power</br>  So what's so fucked up with killer's face that he has to wear a mask all the time. I mean it would be hard as fuck to eat spaghetti through small holes in a mask and nobody would go through that if they didn't need to.  <br>Oh damn. A vest?! Well nevermind then.</br>  <br>We are 100% going to find out what it was, Oda always delivers</br>  <br>He's Shiki's son so he has to keep the mask on to remain anonymous.</br>  <br>Point is that Sanji was going to die if Law didn't save his ass</br>  its good that oda is bringing all the supernovas back. best characters  <br> What is up with ruining characters and shows with needless fan-service? <br>Nothing about Namis personality changed, she is still the same character she always was. People like you seem to miss that since you focus too much on her tits and clothing now.</br></br>  <br>If you take it off he'll die.</br>  <br>It's his plot armor</br>  <br>Would it be extremely painful?</br>  <br>Doffy was just caught him off guard. He'</br>  <br>you don't get to bitch about characters going to shit after their introduction when they are in the same series as sanji</br>  <br>gtfo tumblr fag</br>  Did Luffy just forget about Sabo?<br>So far for Oda's masterful planning.</br>  <br>Sabo was dead.</br>  <br>he thought sabo is dead</br>  <br>no, you are just retarded</br>  <br>I don't use tumblr</br>  <br><br><br>forgot about that, nvm</br></br></br>  Duffy said that he wanted 10 members to join his crew<br><br>So far we have 8 and Jinbei is pretty much confirmed.<br><br>I guess the last member will be another girl? What do you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think I hate it when every girl is NEXT STRAWHAT NEXT STRAWHAT CONFIRMED GUYS GONNA JOIN.</br>  <br>I think another female is pretty much guaranteed.The twist will be that she will be almost as retarded as Luffy and will often hang out with Chopper and Usopp instead of Nami and Robin.</br>  <br>The anime is fine for at least half of the series but yes it gets like this eventually.</br>  <br>I honestly hope it's Rebecca. Her little sister dynamic with Robin is cute.</br>  <br><br>I'm hoping Koala. She could be the bridge to the revolution army or something.</br></br>  <br>If it's Rebecca I'll stop reading One Piece. She ruined Dressrosa, she would ruin the rest of the manga. <br><br>I would thank Oda for the creation of great arcs and emotional moments but I would just fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm hoping Violet, or as another anon mentions from time to time, a fox woman from wano.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>This is what I'm talking about.<br>None of these characters are interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anyway, it was weird that he wasn't even mentioned once (like luffy saying: "i don't want to lose another brother". I think the chapter about the childhood should have been before marine ford.</br>  <br> Violet isn't interesting <br> A dancer to go with Brook's music <br> An amazing lookout, better than Usopp could ever hope to be <br> somewhat useful in a fight <br>Probably the most useful "new nakama" from this arc.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>barto is much more fun though</br>  <br><br> Koala <br> not interesting <br><br>Yeah man, you're opinion is shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>god please no</br>  <br>What use is he for the crew other than a cabin boy and some defense from cannon fire (which they do well enough on their own)?</br>  <br>yeah i think he's better as a allied crew or division captain instead of actual crewmember</br>  <br>Likely. I don't get why people are against a beautiful lady swordsman with meat. They really don't pay attention to God Usopp's wisdom. Case in point:<br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He tried on the mask and then it stuck. Or maybe the tan-line embarrasses him.<br><br>The real mystery is how he got so big and muscley on a diet of pasta.</br></br></br>  <br>Or maybe his face is disgusting? that could make anybody appetite to lose.</br>   yfw luffy will die at the end of the last battle,and will never live in the new world that will be created   <br>This dumb deserve that .</br>  <br>He's not dumb, he's the literal definition of a superhuman. He declared war on the entire world and survived</br>  <br>Maybe he could take it off, but he just never thinks of it.</br>  <br>What the fuck did you say?</br>  <br>This is why I think Blackbeard is gonna win in the end. Or at the very least, he will die with the title of "King of Pirates"<br> Blackbeard is a famous pirate name, not Luffy or Monkey <br> Blackbeard's attitude "influences" the way future pirates act (ie. like a typical real world pirate) </br></br></br>  <br>If anything Sanji caught Doffy off gaurd, flying in out of nowhere to kick him in mid air.</br>  <br>Man Doffy was so based from the moment he flew through the clouds. Cant believe he lost to a simple punch. Felt alot like the shitty Soul Eater anime ending.</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that literal though.<br><br>The real Blackbeard was killed by a guy named Maynard.<br>I don't see that happening in OP.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cant believe he lost to a simple punch <br><br>Did you actually read the fight? He got his insides roasted by Red Hawk, his organs destroyed by gamma knife, and still managed to keep up and was going to win if the Gladiators didn't protect Luffy</br></br></br>  <br>that's what I'd like too but we both know it's not going to happen.</br>  <br> Nami drinking too much <br> zoro passed out <br>they had sex</br></br></br>  He seemed legit mad at the gorosei for making a fool of him.<br>How will he respond to the dragon's treachery?<br><br>What's he gonna do with Fujitora? <br>Yell at him some more?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope he chases Fuji down and beats the everliving shit out of him. Poor Sakazuki.</br>  <br>None of them read the manga. They're too stupid to comprehend anything, look at their grammar and you'll see.</br>  <br> She ruined Dressrosa <br>stop being autistic</br></br>  <br>Nah, Kaido is just a faggot with a Sea King Zoan</br>   Good odds Sanji &amp; Co are now facing down fellow supernova Capone Bege's crew along with Mam's <br><br>They're gonna need help.<br><br>Who's gonna give it to them?<br>Law's crew?<br>Jinbei?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Captain Buggy </br>  <br>Based Uncle, of course. Why else does he have that Poneglyph?</br>  <br>Shadows from a random sky island. Just like Wiper's and Luffy's shadows.</br>  Doflamingo is the glasses.<br><br>Vegapunk made them eat the Ito Ito no Mi.</br></br>  <br> even Sogeking <br>Nice play, but take away your fake chapter page, m8!</br></br>  <br> Laboon is Kaido </br>  <br> cowtits out of nowhere <br>She always had big tits.</br></br>  <br>as retarded as it might sound it's not as stupid as some theories regarding sabo that came up in the past two years</br>  <br>interesting</br>  <br>Would be great. Too bad Doffy changed his glasses many times.</br>  <br>Come on man, you can't deny that Nami's chest started out at a more reasonable size<br> in b4 people say that she was just naturally growing as time progressed <br>I know it's just Oda's art style changing but all of his women characters just seem to get bigger and bigger breasts as the series progresses.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo is a complete asshole.<br>If the promise that they made with Ace and Luffy was the reason of why he didn't go to Marineford, I can accept it.<br>But that fucking asshole threw that promise away when he stated to Fuji, regardless his position he will always be at Luffy's side if it's needed.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>then stop posting shitty and ugly tumblr fanart is it that hard, holy shit</br></br></br>  Who's ready for this bad motherfucker to join and be on more cover pages?  <br>I don't want to deny and of course they are bigger now. But be honest she had pretty good tits before too. Just look back Arabasta or even earlier.<br>We saw those tits' shape in her jumper too.<br><br>I know it's hard to belive that they naurally grew during timeskip due Nami's age, but it isn't inpossible.<br><br><br>Same with Tashigi. I really dislike the dum theory that she gave birth to a child duting ts, thats why her breasts grew and that's why she's so great mother figure for PH's giant kids.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's not goofy enough<br><br>even zoro looks silly when he's pissed off</br></br></br>  <br>That's not really hard when you have Plot-armor ,and that's why he suck , luffy can do anything he wants , he'll never be punished for his action . This is a generic shounen MC , boring and immortal.</br>  <br>Well yeah.<br>Can you name a single shounen that handled killing the MC and continuing the story well without the MC coming back via some stupid shit?  Aside from JJBA. </br></br>  <br> he's not goofy enough <br>That's why I liked him. He was a good mentor figure for Luffy.<br> stopped him at ID to wasting time fighting with BB <br> helped and saved him at Marineford <br> made Luffy remember that he has more important things and instead of loss and past he should focus on the future </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not shounen but  TTGL </br>  <br>I forget more stuff than I remember with One Piece so its all ok.</br>  <br>I'm not blaming oda because he doesn't kill luffy .<br>But luffy declared the war on : World goverment , Big mom and Kaido , that's too much , He's only still alive because he can't die , every other pirates would be already dead .</br></br>  <br>I totally forgot Zoro still had those earrings and now I can't ignore them</br>  <br> every other pirates would be already dead <br>bullshit<br>I bet Shanks made something similar until he became one of the Yonko. and so on</br></br></br>  <br><br>That bring's my memory back about those shitty theories about Doffy's and Corazon's plus the string clones' earrings.</br></br>  <br>Aokiji</br>  <br><br>Well he's also alive/not caught because of Zoro and Kuma.</br></br>  when will it finally be zoro's turn again  <br>All of Wano</br>  <br><br>Once somebody appears who is worth his time. <br><br>He must be getting frustrated with all these jobbers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Will he again use his bandana?</br>  <br>Nami was 18, it's normal to grew tits</br>  <br> He's forgotten about his promised duel with Kinemon over Shusui already </br>  <br>No, he's just Luffy without the moral compass.</br>  <br>he wasnt listing Supernova<br><br>Kid/Hawkins/Apoo dont have a catchy alliance name to toss around like StrawHeart</br></br></br>  <br>OZ ALLIANCE</br>  <br>You're following the "At the end of the series the world has to transition into being Earth" trope, and no, that isn't going to happen.</br>  <br>I SAID CATCHY<br><br>THAT ISNT CATCHY</br></br></br>  <br>He did in fishman island and against pica. What are you reading?</br>  <br>Explain Robin's massive bust increase from 27 to 29 then.</br>   when you nut so hard the whole squad feel it   <br>You're dumb.</br>  <br><br>Also Blackbeard would benefit greatly from converting damage into power, since he's prone to taking hits, and relies on physical punches after sucking enemies towards himself with his Yami Yami no Mi power.</br></br>  <br>Its not Oz anymore with Big Mom as the Wicked Witch</br>  <br>He's hot shit, and now every Marine is thinking back to when Smoker was like:<br> "Yeah, this kid is hot shit going on to hottest. You guys give me some more resources, pls." </br></br>  <br>plus candy cane rails</br>  <br> Shanks has red hair <br> Kidd has red hair <br>Shanks is a dead beat dad and Kidd holds a grudge for him because of it. So to prove he is better than his dad and doesn't need his care, he's going to usurp his position.<br><br>Daddy issues, everyone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy might not step in.<br>He could say something along the line of:<br> "I promised him to return the strawhat when I'm king. I can't meet him just yet." <br>Or<br> "Shanks and the guys are strong.

But thanks I'll remember next time</br>  What a bunch of crap, she went back to being a beta bitch in less than 2 panels.  <br>Nobody yet the anime is airing to night</br>  I want a misandrist to choke me with her legs  That panties/boxers swap... hnnnnnnnngggggggg<br><br>Hahaha chios' gonna think they were kiyoshis' panties... will probably think he's a crossdresser because of the school uniform thing before</br></br>  <br><br>No worries just tell us what's the text here.<br>As for anime it should be in 3 hours from now.</br></br></br>   Chaiman runs into a forest <br>   It's the same one he lost himself in at the beginning<br/> <br>Ayyyyyyy</br></br>  It says in less than 3 hrs<br>www.livechart.me/summer-2015/tv</br>  <br>This.<br><br>Unfortunately this defuses the potential bomb of Chiyo recognizing Hana's panties.</br></br></br>  <br> The old VP is back <br>I haven't been keeping up but this can only be a good thing. Unless it means less Mari lewdness, which is entirely possible.</br></br>  I just don't like this manga, I don't know why<br>It was decent for the fist 3 volumes but then turned into lewd shit</br>  <br>VP reverted back to Moeiko. It was only temporary and i don't speak Korean so i have no idea what's going on.</br>  <br> those hips  <br> them thighs </br></br>  <br>I hope she'll choke Kate with these legs. And that they'll make out in front of everyone.</br>  <br>I'm conflicted. I want more shenanigans to ensure if they try to exchange them back, but I also want Hana to insist on keeping his boxers.</br>  <br> prison school chapter 183 <br><br>definitively more shenanigans PLIZ<br><br>Also: some korean bro dropping by to tell us if end page says another pause or not?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they won't come in each others underwear before the swap back </br>  <br>Hana is gonna cum in his boxers during the cavalry battle.<br><br>The Medusa will drool.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is this manga suppose to be about anyway? The pages I see posted just implies it's a manga about people getting raped.</br>  <br>Mari won't do lewd things unless it's necessary</br>  <br>There has been no sexual intercourse yet.<br><br>I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Hana x Kiyoshi.</br></br></br>  <br>That's a good thing. Moeiko is best.</br>  Oh boy, if they don't swap undergarments in the next few chapters, Kiyoshi will 100% be derobe'd in the battle.  <br>Basically 5 nigga ends up going to a previous all girls school and crazy shit ensues. And really glasses and MC are the only true bros the rest are kinda bitch nigga (well hood is between). And yeah no sex at all but Hana and the MC has a great thing going on since like chapter two or three, and it could get even better as long as that one bitch doesn't join in</br>  <br>Oh okay thanks for taking the time to explain it to me. Appreciate it.</br>  ok, ok, first things first. last page, is there a break next week or not?  <br>Because fucking Kate was really necessary? She could just have make out with her, and not putting her tongue between her legs.</br>  <br>It's not good leverage unless she's fucking her properly.</br>  <br>Or he could just dump the panties and freeball in the battle</br>  <br><br>THIS</br></br>  Here's what I'd do if I was Kate and lost the cavalry battle. I'd announce to all school that I was in love with Mari and that's why I treated her better in prison than she treated the former prisoners -which is true-. Then, she seduced me, said she loved me and I was happy. Then I found out she cheated on me. With a boy no less. I show the pictures of ouroboros between mari and kiyoshi. If mari reveals our 69 too, it's all "you not only cheated on me, you filmed it without me knowing too?"<br>Iirc school code forbids lewd relationships between the sexes, not between girls.<br>And again, does someone know if there's a break next week?</br></br>  Still not over Mari eating Kate's pussy just to blackmail her with that.  <br>Don't be surprised, mari has done much worse to people who did much less than kate.<br>Once a cunt, always a cunt.</br></br>  <br>Basically, these five guys go to an all-girls school that's going co-ed. The student council there doesn't like men, so at the first sight of them doing something bad, they send them to this prison set up on school. So now the five guys have to get out while enduring the torture the girls give them.</br>  <br>summoning koreabro</br>  <br>Someone dump the pages.</br>   mfw she will keep the panties and masturbate with them after she gets them back   <br>Righto clicku not arrowed. So i had to manually snippet everything.<br><br>I probably didn't capture every page perfectly, but it's good enough for ghetto translation work. Commencing dump for Koreanbro. Someone sacrifice a Tumblrina to appease his Korean bloodlust.</br></br></br>  <br>2 of 18</br>  <br>Reminder!</br>  <br>3 of 18</br>  <br>W H Y<br>H<br>Y</br></br></br>  <br>4 of 18</br>  <br>5 of 18<br><br><br>It takes a lot of energy to hold her final form.</br></br></br></br>  <br>6 of 18</br>  <br><br>yeah, it's not like they trained her for four whole months or anything</br></br>  <br>7 of 9  :^) </br>  <br>8 of 18<br><br><br>I don't remember Moeiko receiving any training.

Tsubasa and Maria were standing on a beach after escaping Phara and then a submarine landed and lots of robot girls and different scientists voiced by the same person came out of it. Also there were Noise but they were friendly and disintegrated themselves before hitting humans.</br>  <br> they were friendly and disintegrated themselves before hitting humans <br>Being noise is suffering</br></br>  <br>Noise-chan ;_;</br>  <br>i can't wait for the aufwachen form. That fucking transition is amazing.</br>  Lots of new info from the spreads on zoid's twitter<br> Fighting as they have up until now the gear users will not be able to stand up to the auto-scorers. The change this Elfnein is "key" <br> For radiant force the girls recorded in front of mic together, not separately <br> The "charity rock festival" was in remembrance and in honor of those that died (presumably during the frontier incident) <br> Agematsu envisioned the concert and chose the phrase "stardust" because he wanted the stars and heavens to reflect in the stage's water <br> The live scene featuring a sunset was an homage to the concert from season 1 </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fighting as they have up until now the gear users will not be able to stand up to the auto-scorers. The change this Elfnein is "key" <br><br> The elemental dolls are dancers that dance to symphogeah users' songs, matching they rhythm and attack pattrent while dancing.  </br></br></br>  <br> Agematsu said that "songs" don't belong to "justice" rather they are simple something that is "pure." <br> This means they can be used to create "pure justice" or "pure evil." This comment came from question about the "song to destroy the world." <br> "Say you heard a song right after you've had your heart broken. Then you never want to hear it again for the rest of your life, right?" <br> The last thing he says is GX might end up being a story that answers the question "what exactly is a song?" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Either that or they fight in a manner to deliberately fuck up the rhtythm of the songs</br>  <br><br> For the dolls to not be able to predict the songs they deliberately have to mess up their own songs <br>Berserker song time</br></br></br>  <br>http://www.animate.co.jp/special/ch<wbr>araby_tv/pc/charabyebook/_SWF_Windo<wbr>w.html<br>Who is going to rip it?</br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br> &gt;The last thing he says is GX might end up being a story that answers the question "what exactly is a song?" <br>Man, I might reflect on my life hard that I might enter a church and pray when GX ends.</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, it's only p34.</br>  <br>It's not Exterminate. There won't be one for Glorious Break.</br>   watching videos from Ayahi's concerts <br><br>Do... do we have any idea how much tickets to Symphogear Live 2016 are gonna be?</br></br>  <br> dub dubs <br>Can we make a church?</br></br>  <br>I've already ordered the first two BDs.<br>Hopefully I'll get lucky.</br></br>  <br>noise ;_;</br>  <br>They might do a raffle.<br>Prepare your wallet because you might spend harder than buying 7 tickets of a Nana concert.</br></br>  <br>A bunch of money plus plain tickets, hotel charges, souvenirs, and tons of other stuff my wageslave college student self could never hope to afford.</br>  <br>At least we can pirate the BDs after its out.<br>;_; fuck life</br></br>  <br>Kaneko said Hibiki was already 16 years old in G's prologue. And Miku was also 16 years old in G's finale according to official site data, which means G's story started From September 14th(or more later) and ended after November 7th. If Chris was younger than Hibiki, it will be a little strange that Chris was already 16 years old in G's finale( official data) unless G's finale happened after December 28th. But since in season 3 she is the oldest senpai in Lydian, there is a little chance that Chris is younger than Hibiki.</br>      <br> Shirabe's back </br>  <br> Kaneko said Hibiki was already 16 years old in G's prologue. <br>Hibiki was what in S1? 14?</br></br>  The concert was shit.<br><br>SHIT.</br></br>  <br>Damn, dat senpai.<br>Thank you based anon.<br><br>15, I guess.</br></br></br></br>  <br>15<br>Also Hibiki and Miku are 2nd years in Lydian now. Chris is 3rd and DMJii are 1st.</br></br>  Less than 11 hours now.  <br>Gotta say, I really appreciate how the gears have become increasingly more mechanical looking every season while still remaining slick, stylish and sexy.</br>  <br> Shirabe will never call me senpai </br>  <br>NO PREVIEWS</br>  <br>Incorrect. Hibiki and Mika are 13, Chris is 19 and DMJii are 8. How they managed to all infiltrate the same school is far beyond me.</br>  <br>inb4 to keep suspension high they've decided to stop releasing previews and letting the viewers die in speculah</br>    <br>Mechgical Girl Armor is best power armor</br>  <br><br>I'm not asking for a kiss or anything, just some cute or meaningful interaction between these two. Their whole duel in G was fantastic and really cemented the bond between them, this season needs to expand on that sometime.</br></br>  <br> we will never see Tsubasa in uniform again. </br>  <br>I just want more of Chris being flustered, I don't care who she does it with.</br>  <br>I felt that was more just Chris getting character development rather than them being gay for each other.</br>  I want to see something happen that makes the FIS girls start calling Genjuuro  Papa <br><br>So they can have a Mammu and a Daddu<br><br> And they can all become batmen Geahs when Genjuuro inevitably dies </br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish I cherished the moment she still wore her uniform.<br>I never really thought they'll make her graduate from Lydian.</br></br>  <br>I am sorry friend. You've got on the wrong ship.</br>  <br>High points for each girls:<br><br>Hibiki: Biki butt<br>Tsubasa: Vagina Bones<br>Chris: Giant zenbus<br>Shirabe: Back<br>Desss: Legs? <br>Maria: moe uselessness</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Since Maria's the one who most likely will fight last since her gear's broken and her CD comes out last out of the 6, I hope she spends time with Genjuro who cheers her up and helps her. She's the one who kept calling for her mommy so having a father figure would be cute too. Same for the 2 kids who have to depend on LiNKER getting a talk.</br>  <br>I want to breed with Shirabe.</br>  <br>Tsubasa has a nice back and legs too.<br>Hell, her legs is one of the sexiest.</br></br>  <br>We went over this in the last thread<br><br>God Tier:<br>Kanade's Hair<br>Hibiki's Butt<br><br>High Tier:<br>Maria's Legs<br>Miku's Smile<br><br>Mid Tier: <br>Chris' Zenbus<br>Shirabe's Eyes<br>Serena's Shoulders and Hands<br><br>Low Tier:<br>Kirika's Back<br><br>Doesn't Have a Charm Point Tier:<br>Tsubasa's Personality</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She can pilot helis in the meanwhile before she gets the gear back.</br>  <br>The only right thing in there is Hibiki's Butt, stop trying to push your shit taste tiers.</br>  <br>Dess is a great combination of short, fluffy, and ample breasts.<br><br>She has the most fuckable design.</br></br></br>  <br>Tiers are less relevant than the charm points themselves</br>  <br><br>Dude it's okay for a girl to have more than one charm point. And there's no reason multiple girls can't have the same high point.</br></br>  <br> Dess is a great combination of short, fluffy, and ample breasts. <br><br>So, Dess is a younger non tsundere and less angry Chris, without the slave / sex slave background? And yeah, Kirika a cutey.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria: Legs<br>Dess: Fashion sense</br></br>  <br>Maria and Chris are the ones that can do the garter belt look nicely.</br>  <br> Shriabe will never call me Onii-chan </br>  <br>Pilot and/or bridge bunny? Might be cool especially if she welcomes the geahs back after a mission (with a focus on taking care of Shirabe/Kirika like a mother welcoming the kids back from school).</br>  <br> legs <br> breasts <br> eyes <br> hairstyle <br> color combination of eyes and hair <br> face <br> smile <br> body height <br><br>Maria is perfect.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to bully Minamean.</br>  <br>Yeah, for breeding.</br>  <br>Where did they said Tsubasa graduates from Lydian? I guess I missed it.</br>  Will best doll make an appearance yet?  <br><br>Ver please.</br></br>  <br> Athleticism <br> Genki <br> thighs <br> breasts <br> butt <br> eye/hair color <br> citrus-y <br> smile <br> height <br>   appetite <br><br>Hey what d'ya know, Hibiki's perfect too!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They'll probably finish up Tsubasa vs Green, Hibiki vs Carol and Chris vs Yellow so that's already a lot. Maybe the 2 remaining dolls will jump into one of the fights to outnumber the enemy or attack Shirabe/Kirika.</br>  <br>She also strikes me as the most... human of the characters? Like, at the risk of sounding like a flaming retard, the main three girls have victory literally written for them. Maria doesn't have plot armor for her success and seeing her try so hard and then FAIL and just... break down and start crying. It felt a lot more real to me than "Heroes save the day." I don't know if I'm just cynical or what, but her efforts alone simply being inadequate and being unable to rationalize that with her own mentality felt so much more like reality than Hibiki's "Surpass the impossible and kick reason to the curb" outlook on life that lets her be Bikki.<br><br>I had this more coherently in my head, I swear.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Lines indicating the shirt is falling loosely from her chest <br> Lines outlining her breasts <br><br>So is that shirt tight or loose?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I still like the Sword more than Maria.</br>    <br>It's  seethrough </br>  <br> most human <br> they are all cyborgu <br>get out of this thread human scum</br></br></br>  <br>custodians pls</br>  <br> Cute breasts <br> Beautiful green eyes <br> Cute tomboyish hairtstyle <br> Genki <br> Nice fashion sense <br><br><br>I think Kirika is fine, too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's  seethrough , anon.</br>  I think we all need something to help pass the time for next episode. Draw your own noise.   In both S1 and S2 when the girls enter X-Drive mode they gain telepathy <br>What chance is there that the "unified language" that the Moon is blocking out is telepathy, and by entering X-Drive the girls are exceeding the control of the moon and gaining temporary access to the unified language?</br>  <br> that <br> nice fashion sense <br><br>Kirika please get off the computer, trying to boost your ego on an anonymous image board is pointless.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I still wonder what the fuck went over Nana's head that she drew a fucking Samurai when they are told to draw a fucking noise.</br>  <br><br>I know what you mean, and I'd like to concur.<br><br>However if you remember S1 Hibiki wasn't always that bright and radiant. She was trying to befriend Tsubasa like a puppy begging for attention. She had a hard time dealing with her dark side that got amplified by the shards in her body. In the end Fine had almost crushed her will to fight.<br><br>Tsubasa was rather edgy because muh Kanade in the beginning and almost killed herself. S1 showed her as a weak human who is unable to even keep her own room in order.<br><br>Chris is more of a Mary Sue actually. Given that she has the shittiest background story of them all it's weird how much power she has and how easy she just switches over to the good guys. A real human being in her situation would probably suffer horrible flashbacks, need long time counseling and maybe even medication.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Glad I'm not the only one that thought that</br>  <br> songs unite people </br>  <br> songs unite people <br>Reminds of a certain story of a Nanafag who successfully married the girl he loves because of Nana's lives. <br>Songs can be miraculous things sometimes.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope Yuuki-senpai likes it</br>  <br>NANA WILLS IT</br>  why is Tsubasa so kakoii?  <br>Because Swords are inevitably cool.</br>  <br>We were only given a very narrow view of her relationship with Fine. For all the shit she did to Chris, Fine needed her functional and loyal; she would have had to support her somehow.</br>  <br>Well, I can understand your feelings about the "characters having victory written all over them" since that's the aura the main trio give off lately and Maria really doesn't have that.<br><br>It's like every happy moment she has is tied with a sad moment that lingers afterwards so she has to suffer the effects and can't just brush it off. Mom dies as she finally gets to sing a song that connected the world. Sister's relic gets broken after the fight she finally learns to hold hands. Gets to sing again as an idol but has limited freedom since it was only part of a deal so that Kirika and Shirabe are free. Got to take part in saving the world but is considered a tainted hero. Finally has friends but is forced to helplessly watch them fight to defend her when that's her biggest trauma (Serena died protecting her).<br><br>It's normal when she was still a "confused villain" that has yet to be converted but she kept suffering for her efforts even afterwards and from the looks of it, will continue. It's good to have variety after the main trio got over their problems though so that's a good thing. Punching through impossible situations and suffering for your efforts make it more interesting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> No   tentacles <br>Shit</br></br>  <br>I wish Maria would use a broad sword instead.</br>  Target captured.  <br>I want Tsubasa to hug me from behind.</br>  <br> deadfish </br>   Geah Miku will never be a thing again   <br>I call it a  Kanade  noise.</br>  <br> Instead of Hibiki taking Maria's gear it's Miku this time </br>  <br>Why did these parts of the archive never got scanned?</br>  <br> a design this arousing <br> not appearing again <br>satelite pls</br></br></br>  <br>They weren't in there.

Today my love and appreciation for the has deepened because you.</br></br></br>  EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS<br><br>NO FUCKING PREVIEW PICS</br></br>  So how long before the budget for this season of Symphogear just Marianas trenches itself into oblivion? I think the last season got about 2 or 3 episodes before just plffffffffffffft. Honestly I'd be willing to give it a try if the show didn't just have that awful pattern for the garls factor, but I'd rather not see the show get inventive with what the character models are supposed to look like again.  <br>If you think Symphogear is bad, go watch Chaos Dragon.</br>  <br> Implying that Bikkie didn't overcome her weakness <br><br>Action movies nigga</br></br></br>  <br> garls factor <br>What?</br></br>  <br>They've animated up to episode 5 already one week ago so I'm hopeful they've organized the workload pretty well this time.</br>  <br><br>Maria being a weakling was actually a good thing as her lack of determination hindered their group and Ver's plans, she basically sabotaging them.</br></br>  <br>Well shit, we've finally figured out what Maria is good for.<br>Now we just need her to go turncoat and start working for Carol and the world should be fine.</br></br>  <br>You can wait for the BD's i f you can't handle the QUALITY, I hope there won't be a drop in quality though.<br><br>Looks good, I hope it stays consistent.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Too late, she has guts now.<br>Also it only worked because Ver was a retard. Carol is much more dangerous, she's Fine-level dangerous, maybe even worse.</br></br></br>  <br> Chaos Dragon <br> Bad <br>Nice meme</br></br></br>  <br>Are you confusing the Design Archive with the Key Animation Note? Because that design sheet of Miku is straight from the Design Archive.</br>  <br>Those thighs should be illegal. Also, I wonder how Phara's breasts would feel like. It's advanced enough to have a life of its own so it should be lifelike too right?</br>  <br>That kick is just begging for an edit showing her  lack of   panties</br>  <br>But they do act like sisters when they have a bond that goes beyond friendship.</br>  <br>Her hair is all jointed up so I'm guessing she's not very soft.</br>  I will marry Tsubasa and every morning she will wake me up looking like this!  <br>I think he implied Chaos Dragon is a good show m8.</br>  <br>Can you even marry a sword?</br>  <br>Legal in Massachusetts.</br>  <br><br>The thumbnail looks creepy.</br></br>  <br>With love, nothing is impossible!</br>    <br>hey, at least she doesn't have a  tumblr </br>  Will there be a livestream other that chinese one from last thread that showed, like, 5 frames per minute?  <br>Am it he only one who didn't have a single lag with douyu?</br>  <br> I can see Tsubasa joining the otherkin club </br>  <br> not liking Tsubasa <br>pleb taste</br></br>  <br>How's your internet? 80Mbps?</br>  <br><br>I'm using australian shiternet, and I didn't have any lag during the episode itself.<br>The G intro beforehand was lagging though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>my internet is complete shit, but the G intro was also lagging for me</br></br>  <br><br>Try now, is douyu lagging now?</br></br>  How do I set the comments to be invisible?  <br>The cupcake woman?<br>Yeah, but I think that's because it's broadcasting a niconico stream.</br></br>  <br>no, running fluently  even though it takes forever to start the actual stream </br>  <br> marry Tsubasa <br>Not on my watch.</br></br>  <br>click the pen inside the square next to the volume</br>  <br>sorry, actually click the orange thing right to the volume<br>but this is from a niconico stream so you cannot get rid of them right now</br></br>  <br>No, I watched it fine too.</br>  <br>I want scans of the design archive more than the key animations.</br>  <br>Don't worry anon, you're also invited!</br>  <br>neetball?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127869712 <br><br>So this is the stream for this season?<br><br>I managed to wait for raws last week, but I'm not so sure I can be quite as patient this week.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks anon.</br></br>  <br> On all levels except physical, I am a wolf <br> speaking to people in English and knowing what a camera is </br></br>  <br> That nickname <br>Are you a Nanafag perhaps?</br></br>  <br>Videos were uploaded in less than an hour last week.</br>  <br><br>I know.

I had forgotten how great it was. The series really could've ended with the   death of the symphogears   and it wouldve been pretty good. I would have been ok with some sort of mike gear spinoff s2 too. Of course, what we have now is much better though.  So, no preview pics.

She is not from their world, just like Ea.</br>  <br> not knowing that since   Kung Fu Chaos </br>  http://symphogear-gx.com/next/  <br>Fucking finally.</br>  <br>The 2hu looks angry.</br>  WHY DOES THIS SHAKE WHEN I HOVER OVER THE THUMBNAIL<br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN</br>  <br>Oh, it's that scene. Shirabe Kirika getting involved and Maria in a straitjacket (shaking). I thought the Phara fight would be the one shaking picture.</br>  <br>That body is lewd</br>  <br>Why is Maria in jail? Have they finally made being useless a crime?</br>  <br>Looks like they aren't moving things along too quickly, which is good.</br>  <br>Every preview has a shaking image for some reason, the website administrator loves that shit.</br>  Channel name?    <br> Im still hype for the YOYOS <br><br>She better go all Sukeban Deka on it.</br></br></br>  I have a question bros and I figure you guys, the biggest Nanafags I know, would be able to answer it.<br><br>In all the performances of Innocent Starter (my favourite song) I've seen, at the end Nana says something without the mic that is almost always caught on camera. What does she say? I figure it's some sort of thank you or something but not saying it into the mic might mean it is extremely personal. Since the lyrics are a straight up love song for Nanoha and Fate could she be saying something to the most important person in her life? I'm genuinely curious and I can't lipread Jap.</br></br>  <br>flashback probably</br>  <br> Maria picture is shaking <br>Is she finally doing something or is her flashback really that exciting?</br></br>  New keywords, other updates too. Hard for me to check them all on my phone.  <br>Looks like Michael Jackson.</br>  <br>I said body, not face</br>  <br>Hibiki you should probably transform if someone is actively trying to murder you. Even if it is a cute little girl.</br>  <br>Would probably explain what happened after G, how DMJii are where they are now, what they did with Mamu's corpse and how she ended up doing a concert with Tsubasa.</br>   ch_kirika_school_kawaii <br>This is the actual god damn filename from the official website.<br>DESS confirmed cutest gear.</br></br>  <br>When did Shirabe learn web design?</br>  <br>I missed seeing the previews, trying to make sense of the intentionally vague shots and wondering why this one is shaking. Good times.</br>  <br> wobbling thumbnails <br> those filenames <br>Those web designers have way too much fun</br></br></br>  <br>Shirabe got the same treatment too.</br>  <br>http://symphogear-gx.com/characters<wbr>/ch_kirika_school_kawaii.png<br>http://symphogear-gx.com/characters<wbr>/ch_shirabe_school_kawaii.png<br>Both DMJii's are like this actually, but still. Also those wristbands.</br></wbr></br></wbr></br>  <br>She says "ARIGATOU!" off mic sometimes, she shouts it but maybe her voice isn't that strong enough to be heard by the cameras.<br>Nana likes shouting thank you, because she always feels the urge to thank the people around her, and since Innocent Starter is a beginning of everything for Nana its only natural for her to do that. <br>Also the most important person to her is dead. The closest one she treasures the most next to her father is her family including her dog, then her job and staff, then her fans.</br></br></br>  <br> not liking Kirika's incredibly cute and girly fashion taste </br>  <br> 77 <br>Is this a test given by Nana?</br></br>  So we need to wait fucking BS11 airs GX every weeks.  <br> Marisa? Is dat you?</br>  <br>Maria pls just go home.</br>  Kirika and Shirabe a cute. CUTE.  The important question is will we see these gentlemen again?  <br>On the plus side, it means the few hours before the new episode will be non-stop hype every week, with the preview, new keywords, and Iguchi radio all hitting at once.</br>  <br>We are so dead.</br>  <br>Maybe Tsubasa's gonna get wrecked hard that they don't want to hype the scene.<br>Or the webdevs are FISfags.</br></br>   get home from work <br> previews <br>We made it</br></br>  <br>Just think of it as a resting period, so that our hearts will be at least twenty percent ready when they drop the universe on us in episode 7.</br>   Destroy the world---but before that   <br>http://www.symphogear-g.com/story/n<wbr>ext01.php<br><br>Looking at the previous shaking pictures of G, it ranged from Genjuro reacting to Gungnir to Maria VS Tsubasa to Chris eating sloppily. Don't mind the shaking pictures, part of the fun is guessing why it is and being completely wrong.</br></br></wbr></br>  <br>I can just feel the bikizerker coming.</br>  <br>Nana has a dog?</br>  <br><br>That's what I assumed at first but she definitely isn't shouting and she gets all teary-eyed. It also looks like she says more than just a thank you, but you're probably right. I was just wondering if there was a deeper meaning of my favourite song to Nana besides the whole kickstarting her career thing.</br></br>  <br>Soon, we're gonna see her in the OP.</br>  I feel a bit sad hearing Iguchi doing the radio by herself.   all this hibizerker hype <br> yfw she never shows up </br>   you won't be at Budoukan when Nana yells MINNA IKUYOU to start things off <br> you won't be there to yell I LOVE YOU and I FEEL YOU with the rest of the audience <br>Surely in my next life.</br></br>  <br> he doesn't know about Kee-tan <br>Kee-tan is Nana's spoiled dog who doesn't really give a shit about Nana and is a neat freak.</br></br>  <br>Kee-tan/Nana OTP<br> doujins when </br></br>  <br>What breed?</br>  <br>dasdsadsa</br>  <br> Maybe Tsubasa's gonna get wrecked hard that they don't want to hype the scene. <br>There's no Tsubasa in the pics after and Phara's still standing under the night sky in the last image. It really might happen.</br></br>  <br> you will never be in a Nana live while Nana is still alive <br> you will never hear Nana shout KAKATTE KOIIII in max full mic volume in your life <br>Sometimes I wish I was just born a rock or something so I won't feel these horrible feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>Kii-tan? Dog?</br>  <br>With her sword raised like she's about to stab someone</br>  <br>Chihuahua, I think.<br>Also, last time Nana talked about K-tan's age she said K-tan is 40 years old in human age or something, and I think that was in 2012.<br><br>I'd rather see Nana fuck herself.</br></br></br></br>  I hope anime chan gets her moment this season  I'm so fucking hyped for the OP. Can't remember the last time a show had me this hyped.  <br> With her sword raised like she's about to stab someone <br>After Maria just had a flashback.<br><br>We're probably completely wrong but it's fun guessing how it plays out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is the image</br>   Elfnein uses "boku" <br> Carol uses "ore" <br>What does it mean?</br></br>  <br>That Elfnein is best girl?</br>  <br> I accidentally deleted the real screen shot while purging my computer and didn't realize it until now </br>  <br>Maybe she does it out of respect for her lost split personality.</br>  <br>Elf9 is a tomboy.<br>Carol really likes unprocessed metal.</br></br>  Uh did half the site go down? Is the hype too real?  Can you fags not crash their site?  <br>I don't know how, but they'll top the two before it.<br>Nana wills it.</br></br>  <br>Now, don't blame us, maybe its the japfags that is going full apeshit.</br>  <br>The site is weak.

Reminder that Miia already won and is used goods.  <br> Blue skin <br><br>WHY<br><br>That will make people believe that she's part of a subrace of Demons</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Lala wins when and after darling's dead.</br></br>   AN A KE   <br>Time for an exorcist.<br><br><br>But Darling is too small to fit in her.<br><br><br>Hold your breath for a long time then die and look at your skin.<br>NIGGA ITS BLUE</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  When renovating the house, did they just tell the contractors "just build it like an American expat will be living here."?  <br> American expat <br>If the said American expat's from say virgin island and weighs about 400lb, then sure.</br></br>  I WANT TO CUM INSIDE RACHNEE  <br><br>Maybe they told them to build it for Texan/American Samoan.</br></br>  <br> When renovating the house, did they just tell the contractors "just build it like an American expat will be living here."? <br>Realistically you can just say "build it for a disabled person who had to use a wheelchair everywhere".<br><br>Granted, in real life Japan has really bad disabled access in buildings. So if you need to use a wheelchair your life would be hell. And this explains why the larger monstergirls have problem going to places.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Being a cripple is literally worse than death in Japan, they might as well kill themselves</br>  <br>Japan cannot unto accessibility. <br>Nope, can't have common sense ruin shits and giggles. Large and deep pool is a-ok, but reinforced roofs with proper escalator? Forget about it.</br></br>  Suu?<br>Suu</br>  <br>How fucking cute is she?</br>  <br>It was pretty ok. The animation was distracting because of how static it was. I found that little video game styled bit quiet charming, I'd like to see more of it.</br>  <br>They don't want smelly cripples stinking up their country, so they force them to flee by making everything require stairs.</br>  <br><br>Best girls</br></br>  <br>Rachnee is ultimately responsible for the house collapsing, due to dragging Honey to her rape attic without first disabling everyone else.</br>  <br>This round about deflection of blame from horse pussy</br>  How would Rachnera act during the full moon? She's already the most unambiguous rapist member  Snakes are the cutest.  <br>She'd turn her legs into penises.</br>  <br>Whose fault is it that all the girls in the house went to the attic to protect his virginity?</br>  Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling?<br><br>It's so easy.</br></br>  <br>Because no one will save her from Suu.</br>  <br>not with that pig voice</br>  <br>That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck.</br>  P O L T<br>O<br>L<br>T</br></br></br>  <br>Chuuni ass-fuck doujin when?</br>  <br> Why hasn't Rachnee just trapped everyone in a thick web and then went to have her way with Darling? <br>Unlike the other girls, it seems she needs to be in the mood to feel like it. So she doesn't really plan to rape Darling unless the situation presents itself. And in general we know she can't actually fight off ALL the girls in the house.<br><br> Because no one will save her from Suu. <br>Especially Suu, who is essentially her nemesis. Suu is not affected by silk.<br><br><br> That's just lala being chuuni, her character description page even says that everything she says is coloured by her being chuuni as fuck. <br>The Lala bio is written by a sceptic who assumes that magic doesn't exist. Note the section that talked about unexplained connections between Dullahan sightings and deaths.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Scene cracks me up every time.</br>  <br>Lala already told darling that she'll be there for him once he's dead for good.</br>  Do you think the VAs are thinking about how weird this shit is to them?    <br>She doesn't have to fight them.<br><br>She simply has to tie them up in her web</br></br></br>  <br>Dat body</br>  <br> that Smith <br>unf</br></br>  <br> She simply has to tie them up in her web <br>Tie up Suu? With spider silk? She is good, but she isn't THAT good.</br></br>  <br>This is the result of that.</br>  <br>Slime best girl.<br>Imagine her covering your dick and churning her slime.</br></br>  <br>Waitafuckingsecond. The anime's airing?<br><br>Fuck, where did the time go!?</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think  means this, but still the same thing in the end. Everyone else are the only things standing between her and Goo victory.</br></br>  <br>That's like saying Bond was responsible for the firing of Goldeneye because he didn't go back to make sure Alec was dead.</br>  <br>That is why she is not in the anime.</br>  <br>He is. He's a government-sponsored assassin. Failure to kill=poor job performance.</br>  <br>This confuses me to no end. Episode one covered the first two chapters of the manga. However, at that pace, the anime would go straight through to Lala's introduction, yet she doesn't appear in the opening theme. Plus, minor characters like Port and Kii don't show up in any of the themes either, so I have no idea what to think.</br>  <br>They'll be there. Lala's not showing up until the second half of the season at any rate.</br>  <br>Because the entire D arc is a huge spoiler if you're anime-only.</br>  Can somebody explain what are the D's all snakes wear on their heads? <br> inb4 hur durr D worship </br>  <br>I think it's just supposed to be cute hairclips, part of their  D sign.</br>  <br>They're hair clips that resemble snake eyes I think</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure he can protect it himself, faggot</br>  <br>It makes them look like snake eyes anon.</br>    Okiku-Mushi when  <br> protect it himself <br>You clearly don't love this decent, earnest and long-suffering fellow. He's been constantly abused, yet his head hang high and his spirit undiminished. <br><br>Scums like you just want to see the flame of hope being snuffed out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to have a daughter and bring her to school with Cerea.</br>  Best girl, can't wait to see that long tongue in anime form  <br>OPPAI LOLI<br><br>HESTIA LIVES IN CENTAUR FORM</br></br></br>  <br>Can't wait for the Cerea bath scene and the full moon episode.</br>   ANN actually liked the first ep <br><br>jesus christ</br></br>  <br>Yes he suffers his small dick(fact) is diamonds all the time, Kimihito can walk off those horse kicks to the head</br>  <br>Every time</br>  Why is Rachnee so cute with all her fangs?  <br>The first episode was good, though?</br>    <br>She makes a great wife.</br>  <br>ive just realised that if cereas ''human'' bely carries the child like in the pic it means her womb is in her human half.... meaning her vag goes through aalllllll her horse body.... poor darling has no chance to impregnate her thats a long ass horse pussy</br>  <br>Those ingrates eat his food, all of it (oh wait, you don't understand this as you are a sole anon in a basement)<br>They are children that he babysits at the behest of the government at that.</br></br>  <br>He can because humans can mate with Centaurs.</br>  <br>Imagine Suu putting a small amount of slime inside your dick making you cum with herself.</br>  <br><br>I want to have babies with Rachnee</br></br>    <br>What if Cerea's dad is hung like a horse?</br>  <br>Yeah whatever.</br>  <br>Meanwhile in Australia...</br>  <br>Too bad<br><br>I've already pried her away from Darling and now she'll have 500 beautiful Arachne children with me<br><br>Why even live after I've stolen your waifu?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it still ticks me off the child is carried in the human half. Bieng the uterus in the horse half would be much more reasonable. <br>It would be imposible for a centaur child to go through such a slim waist as Cereas</br></br>  If only everyone didn't have disgusting cow tits in this series.  <br>Miia is acceptable in this regard, making her top pick once again.</br>  <br>That's why we have best girl!</br>  <br>People like this</br>  <br>Cerea's Dominant Dandy Darling is way better than Miia's Puckish Punk.</br>  <br>This manga got me into giant tits. Miia's are my favorite</br>  <br>The only ones with cowiest are Cerea and Rachnera.<br>Lala's and Miia's are big, but realistically big.<br><br>Mero has average sized breasts, and Papi is an a cup.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Best tits</br>  <br>Implying Master's sperm would give up halfway.

She has normal breasts, not small but not too large either.</br>  <br> Mero has average sized breasts <br><br>Do you even read this manga</br></br></br>  <br> Why even live after I've stolen your waifu? <br>Videogames</br></br>  <br>Its like the thought that counts or something</br>    <br> it still ticks me off the child is carried in the human half. <br>It is just horse being dumb about her own biology.</br></br>  <br>Its a series about monster girls you people take this stuff way to seriously.</br>  <br> Russians like anime <br>Yeah right, from what I hear is that they're too busy getting shitfaced and freezing to death. <br>Yuri was right.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5gn<wbr>pCqsXE8g</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for making me grin like a psycho on the train home from work, guys.</br></br>  <br>Maybe centaurs reproduce by the bellybutton opening and offspring exiting from that hole.</br>  <br>Still! It makes no fuckin' sense. Crab should've put atleast little thought into it!</br>    <br><br>The human half grows in the human womb, the horse half grows in the horse womb, then shortly before birth they merge together.</br></br>  <br>It's a fucking anime<br><br>Shit doesn't need to make sense</br></br></br>  <br>So if you were to do a C-section on the human part, you would end up with a normal human and a normal horse?</br>  Maybe the fact Cerea imagined her human part to carry the kid because she is pure and doesn't know shit at reproduction.  <br>BUT HORSE VAGINAS DON'T WORK THAT WAY! I SPEAK FROM A PERSONAL EXPIERENCE!</br>  I want to play RPG'S and watch anime with Cerea.  <br>And it isn't a horse, it is a monster that displays characteristics that are superficially similar.</br>  <br>Have some imagination</br>  <br><br>The human would have no legs and the horse would have no head.</br></br>  <br>Mein Nigeria.</br>  <br>You failed English and Biology didn't you?</br>  <br>But, but!

And the fact that it's kinda hot confuses me because sumo wrestling isn't sexy.</br>  <br>It's different when the genders are reversed, because for most life-forms, each female can only hold one male's offspring at a time.</br>  <br>Drink a butter sandwich smoothie, spooky Skeleton-chan!</br>  <br>Jesus, eat a fucking burger <br>how are you not dead yet?<br>weighing 62 kg while being 185 is inhuman</br></br></br>  <br>Crybaby</br>  <br>fug off JT</br>  <br>Ok, i laughed.</br>    have boobs <br>  have pretty eye <br>  beautiful face <br>  have nice booty <br>  perfect body and skin <br><br>Manako is the best girl</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> literally no argument: the post <br><br> And that's objectively false, with "objectively" being used correctly <br>Yeah, remember when Papi was crazy jealous and went on a hissing fit every time a new girl joined his harem? Me neither.<br><br>Oh, and remember when Cerea was okay with Darling staying under the effect of some aphrodisiac her mother brought to make him fuck her daughter (or herself)? I don't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>kek</br>  <br> dat Smith <br>Muh dick<br>Also Darling handsome as fuck</br></br></br>  Cerea is still the best  <br>Doppel pls</br>  <br> literally "I have nothing to rebate him but I must continue my shitposting so I better disregard his points saying there's no argument and cherrypick a bit to make up for my own lack of it": the post </br>  <br>My best guess is she doesn't actually know where her uterus is. Girl never even held hands before Master, I doubt she was taught much about sex.</br>  <br>That's literally what you're doing now, because unlike you I actually made some points that you've been only dodging this whole time.<br><br>But whatever dude, keep praising your shitty waifu.</br></br></br>  <br>Hey, he asked.</br>  <br>Because I'm only 20kg under the weight limit, and I don't look like a skinny fuck.</br>  Let me present to you, the best side monster girl: CATHYL!  <br>I have a high metabolism. I could eat nothing but Big macs for a week and only gain a few kgs.</br>   You will never drink Suu and tenderly urinate her all over Miia's face   <br>This man speaketh the truth. If she smiles, then she'd jump to GOAT.</br>  <br>wouldn't suu just corrode your innards before you piss her tho</br>  <br> Next level shit </br>  <br> That's literally what you're doing now, because unlike you I actually made some points that you've been only dodging this whole time. <br>No. That's literally what you've been doing the entire time.

No one would be this anally blasted over some random girl they don't even like that much being criticized.</br></br>  <br> &gt;You will never drink Suu and tenderly urinate her all over Miia's face <br>Dude, that's not how kidneys work. If Suu literally come out of your urine that means she had already destroyed your kidneys on her way through. You should at least restrict her to your intestines.</br></br>  <br>Keep going.</br>  <br> man arms <br>She has the arms of a labourer. Problem?</br></br>  <br>That's not...<br><br>....Well, I can't think of any better, but seriously, she a bitch. Not on the same level as Draco, but still pretty undesirable IMO. She'd have the whole package if it wasn't for that tsundere attitude.</br></br></br>  <br>There really isn't much fanart of her. sorry m8.<br>But I will go and search some for you.</br></br>  <br><br>R.I.P Anon<br>you should have eaten more</br></br></br>  <br>Custom 丰-shaped girdle along horse-belly, wraps snugly across the top of each leg, secured by a thick strap across her horse back.<br><br>As for why this is hotter than normal sumo, pic semi-related. Comparatively speaking, of course.</br></br></br>  <br>That's why out of the two i'll take Asterio.</br>  <br> he disagrees with me <br> is it because I'm blatantly shitposting? <br> nah that cannot be, he must be a Miiafag <br> I surely got him! :^) <br>Oh c'mon, you couldn't be more obvious.<br>You're the waifucancer these threads don't need, get lost.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Kevin we missed you<br><br> When will you come back for real ;_; </br></br></br>  <br> :^) <br> waifucancer <br> get lost <br>Anon, please, at least take your own shitposting seriously.</br></br></br></br>  Will there ever be a CRAB girl?  <br>you probably wouldn't feel anything since you're essentially getting your dick rubbed by fat.</br>  <br><br>thanks man.

I used to be a scrawny ass too, but I'm about the same weight you are, at 5'8". Combination of getting conscripted, coupled with an addiction to chocolate milkshakes in spite of my lacrosse intolerance, as well as a really unhealthy addiction to pig guts(just about every internal organ, but especially  brains ).</br>  <br>Centorea is also strong as an ox but she has proper feminine slender arms</br>  <br><br><br> Liking fat crybabies </br></br></br>  <br> tfw I will never have a farm and milk this cutie every day <br>We exist only to suffer.</br></br>  <br>Rachnera is a crab</br>  <br> I'll draw her later on today, do you have an idea on how I should draw her <br>Mega milk pose<br>big spoon/lil spoon with a anon</br></br></br>  <br> I'm not the shitposter, you are! <br>Again, if that makes you feel better with yourself.</br></br>  <br>end yourself</br>  <br>At least she found it funny...</br>  <br>I want a gothic slug girl. <br>Just imagine the sex.</br></br>  <br>Do anything you want with her. I am literally going trough every page I can find on google to find any fanart of her, but I can't find any.<br>So yeah, I am not used to making requests, so do anything you want, or ask other anons.<br><br>Living without big humanoid cow tats is literally hell. <br> captcha: 666 <br>Also, I could dumb that cathyl milkin again if anyone is interested.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In 4chan <br> Denying autism <br><br>You are fun Anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>She is literal Cancer.

When slugs mate, they impregnate each other.</br></br>  <br>I don't fuckin' know. It wasn't mentioned in the manga. Do cows even need children to produce milk?<br>And am I going to dumb rest of this?</br></br>  <br>I would let her impregnate my anus.</br>  TURTLE, PENGUIN AND WALRUS GIRL WHEN  <br><br>If you want to play it like that, it's Darling's fault for making all these girls fall in love with him and not choosing one. <br><br>But then you could say it is the fault of the country for beginning a foreign monstergirl transfer program in the first place. <br><br>But then you could say it is the fault of the monstergirls for existing.<br><br>If you want to start tracing blame backwards from the most direct source, you're just screwing around with causality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cattle are kept constantly pregnant. And yes.</br>  Anyone know the answer to this morning's question?<br>Option 2 or 3?</br>  <br>That answers that.<br/></br>  <br>This chapter was so good.</br>  <br><br> do cows even need children to produce milk <br><br>what are you, an americlap?</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>It seems Okayado's taurs start milking when they reach maturity tho. Without a need to be pregnant.</br></br>  <br>It seems Okayado wants to break my dick.</br>  <br>I am finnish. And I was very bad at biology. I slept during the classes.<br/></br>      <br>Miia sees herself as Darling's girlfriend and bride to be.<br><br>The same principle applies to her as in my analogy.<br><br>She feels threatened because her peaceful life with the person she loves has been interrupted and thrown away by 5 other girls who're all trying to steal her love away from her.</br></br></br></br></br>  Shy taur best taur.  <br><br>Dairy cows have been bred to always produce milk the moment they reach puberty to the end of their lives. So, no, they don't need to have children.</br></br>  <br>Last.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>This is fucking revolting.<br>Only a 12 year old would like tits like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off yo your flat chest tread you pedophile.</br>  <br>You know she's like 242cm (8') tall without the horns, right? They're right on her proportions.</br>  <br>I'd be a pedophile if I fucked you, yeah.</br>  <br> implying most of /a/ aren't over 18 with a mental age of someone in 5th grade <br><br>Big tits are nice, but there's a certain point where it just looks unsightly.<br><br>I'll never wrap my head around people who are attracted to highly improbable body proportions<br><br><br> implying finding something wrong with breasts that are actually too big makes you a lolicon </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br><br>What a meathead.</br></br>  <br>Nope. Cow udders are not that large.</br>  <br>That only explains her lack of awareness and doesn't justify her actions. Your analogy is entirely based on her twisted idea that she's entitled to someone just because she saw them first, which is childish at best and dangerously possessive at worst.</br>  <br>Kekked, bud you know what I meant.</br>  <br>They still look disgustingly huge.</br>  <br>Why is Cathyl allowed to fuck her host when none of Kurusu's are?</br>  <br>Afterwards she makes you eat your penis</br>  <br>T I O B O Y S Kappa</br>  <br>Host ja nai</br>  <br>Not on her frame. They would look horrible in a normal sized girl.<br>Everything in her is huge, look at that image, her breasts don't even cover all of her ribcage.</br></br>  <br>Okay, can someone explain this to me? I'm not that far into the manga having only finished the first volume yesterday.</br>  <br>It's a harem anime, first girl alway wins and Cerea is doomed to a life of rape by ugly centaur men who win tournaments.</br>  <br>Just keep reading, faggot.</br>  <br>They are over twice as big as his head. Oh god</br>  <br>Pretty much this. <br>If you're an orphan in japan, you're pretty much better off dead. Literally, less than one percent of one percent of adoptable children in japan are actually adopted. (even countries that house ISIS terrorists have a higher adoption rate)<br>If you're disabled in some way, you're pretty much better off dead. <br>If at some point you had a surgical procedure that left a visible scar, you're pretty much better off dead. <br>If you're a retard, then nobody in the world loves you and you should probably kill yourselves immediately.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>LANKLET<br>A<br>N<br>K<br>L<br>E<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>After Darling inevitably dies, Dullahan has him all to herself.</br>  <br>Why are you suddenly talking about Cerea?</br>  <br><br>Because he's basing them off dairy cows and not normal cattle. Dairy cows are always producing milk even when not pregnant because they've been bred for it.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck? How do these look anything less than huge, even on her frame? </br>  <br>Best side girl</br>  <br>Reminder that Tio has the best lifting routine and confirmed for gains.</br>  <br>Except for the fact that she's chuuni so everything she talks about is MJOLNIR HAMMER. <br><br>Just because she says something doesn't make it real. This is why I fucking hate autists.</br></br></br>  <br>Okay but it doesn't work that way. Even if he died, he'll likely still have the heart of whoever gets with him in the head.

Huge cow tits are disgusting.</br>  <br>See</br>  <br>Breasts have nothing to do with it. I was just never fond of asses from the start. I'm more of a leg person.</br>  <br>W-well, my points still stands too.<br>They're not as disgusting on her as they would be on a normal sized woman.</br></br>    <br>Uncorrect.
