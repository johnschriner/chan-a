[ http://reader.sensescans.com/reader<wbr>/read/magi__labyrinth_of_magic/en/2<wbr>6/273/page/1</wbr></wbr>  This chapter is reviving my desire to get a RTS game based on magi, there's so much material for.  <br>So Hakuryuu isn't part of SSA.</br>  <br>Yes he is.</br>  <br>Text says that he isn't. Also Koumei has called Japan the 3rd country that is helping Hakuryuu.</br>  <br>Magi turned to shit about the arc where they showed the previous world.</br>  <br>  Text says he isn't <br><br>It says "fellow sworn friend of the Seven Seas Alliance". What do you think that means?</br></br></br>  Now this is war.  <br>Friend is not the same as the part of alliance.</br>  He will kill Kouha once he finds that he is actually a boy  Sparta has arrived.  <br>You turned a faggot after you were born.</br>  <br>Go back to school fucking sand nigger.</br>  <br>Now you're just being pedantic. Hakuryuu is obviously part of the SSA as they otherwise don't have any right to interfere in this war.</br>  Hm, Koumei has gussed the 3rd country that helps Hakuryuu. I wonder what has been his guessed for the 2nd country.  <br>I think you're forgetting Sinbad's role.</br>  <br>Are you sure? Sinbad toe everyone professed that he is going to support Kouen in this war. I wouldn't be surprised if SSA countries that have been in the summit would support Kouen. Yes, Sassan and Kina were in the summit.</br>  <br>Yah I dont think he's part of the alliance, as a "sworn friend" this gives Sinbad a "reason" to fight. They were gonna fight with the Kou empire anyway, so why not take them by surprise now?</br>  <br>Why are those advisors/strategists so incompetent? None of them knows anything, they don't even know the countries of their world, why are they even there?</br>  I'm not going to lie, i'm really confused by this chapter.  Now it's more than obvious that no one is gonna die is this so called war.  Japan is so cool comes out from the earth on the water wave.  <br>No it does not. It goes against the SSA policy. They can only get involved if one of their allied nations ia under threat.</br>  <br>SSA can't do it. Their policy doesn't allow it. So Sassan and Kina most likely aren't here to kill anyone.</br>  <br><br><br>Well this is sinbad we're talking about. what's a policy to him? they may have ahd a meeting of sorts and ended up agreeing that it would be to their benfit to mount a surprise attack now. As a general this seems to be a legit strat.<br><br>and im not saying anyone will die. My point being is that hakuryu is nto part of SSA. otherwise why would they say "swron friend" instead of "an allied nation"</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>True.<br>Hakuryuu isn't part of SSA. <br>The friend part most likely means that he has promised not to attack SSA.</br></br></br>  <br>also forgot to add they might just be there to flex their muscle. just to intimidate.<br><br>the way i see it is that the SSA is porpousely sticking their nose in the fight hoping that they would get attacked first giving them a reason to join the fight</br></br></br>  So is not-western-Europe entering the fray? I was under the impression that the entire world was somewhat more ancient in aesthetic.<br>I guess there was Magnostadt, but does harry potter land count as western?</br>  <br>Are you seriously arguing that Sinbad would more likely break his policy that is known worldwide rather than just have Hakuryuu's Kou join the SSA? Jesus christ, man.</br>  <br>Balbadd was SSA friend.<br>Both kings are saying that Hakuryuu is just a friend.</br></br>  <br>Magnostadt is basically Jerusalem</br>  <br><br> otherwise why would they say "swron friend" <br>Because, they mean that they, the kings, came to support their new friend, the dark and evil emperor.<br><br>I doubt the Alliance would make themselves look bad by doing what they sworn not to do.<br><br><br>Of course, it's a magocracy, a typical European country of Medieval Ages.<br><br>Also, Nanaumi's taste in men is terrible, her master looked like a mutant when he was properly shown.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Already? Man, this was a fast release.</br>  <br>Ahh, that makes a lot more sense in hindsight, thanks</br>  <br>This is politics. Sinbad would never get involved in this war if he would come out looking bad. He has an image to uphold as the high king of the SSA.</br>  I hope we get some fighting. I don't just want this to be the SSA waving their dick around and making the other army concede  <br>Just look at this thing for the second time.</br>  <br>I got to admit I'm kinda impressed here.<br><br>Hakuryuu chose the battlefield the set up his allies to catch Kou in a pincer when they got there. <br><br>Koumei read far into it enough to have countermeasures prepared for an attack for the sea and basically dumped their dungeon monster army at the boats.<br><br>Didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition though.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Does anyone get a ww2 vibe from this?  <br>Why is everyone from Kina obsessed with horns?</br>  <br>They're all Oni wannabes.</br>  <br>Glorious nippon Oni</br>  <br> I hope we get some fighting. I don't just want this to be the SSA waving their dick around and making the other army concede <br>That's what most likely we are getting since until the black god comes out no one is gonna die. We soon are going to be back to Judar's and Alibaba's adventures.</br></br>  Akainu being mad like underage shitposters.  I thought he would be even more furious than he was. I was certain there would be magma flowing.<br><br>I think the only reason is because he didnt actually watch the stream and got it from word of mouth<br><br>Imagine if he saw Fujitora bowing live.</br></br></br></br>   Zorofags thinking he will beat Fujitora <br> Implying he can stand a chance even with Asura </br>  post OP girls in swimsuits  I forgot there is still Sabo who will protect Luffy.<br><br>And Sabo is almost equal to Fujitora.<br><br>Well, time for CP0 to come onto the scene then.</br></br></br></br>    <br> inb4 Sabo and Zoro fight over who protects Luffy, his old friend or his first mate. </br>  <br> Zoro and Sanji have not had a fight where they had to my pushed to their limits since the time skip. Come one man give us something Oda. </br>  <br> doflamingo was about to kill sanji <br> not pushed to his limits </br></br>  <br>Meh, Zoro isn't that strong.<br><br>Sabo could probably crush all his swords with his Dragongrip.<br><br>Zoro is no match for Fuji.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He didnt reveal everything he had in store. I am sure Sanji and Zoro still have abilities which they have not revealed yet which is what I want to see.</br>  <br>fuck off Shitbernd</br>  <br><br>I feel superbly confident Sanji has an Okama SSJ mode where he wears a dress.</br></br>   tfw completely disappointed with Kaido's design <br><br>I know we only got a glimpse but god damnit</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing next fight Zoro will be pushed to his limits. The finishing move on Pica was a souped-up version of his strongest non-Asura attack.</br>  Man, Fujitora is my new favorite<br>TRUE J U S T I C E</br>  <br>That wasn't kaido<br><br><br>it's like thinking the shadow in thriller bark was Moriah.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think Fuji will actually fight the Strawhats.</br>     thread is only 17 posts yet <br> op is some colored garbage service not a chapter page <br> triptard <br> nametard <br>quality cancer</br></br></br></br>  <br>The fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br> another giant </br>  <br>Tashigi is a libra, you taurushead.</br>  <br>That isn't Kaido,that's just a tower or Kaido's highquarters. You don't ask "where are you" when there's a giant shadow right in front of you</br>  Anyone in the know know if Niggastream is coming out with their translation anytime soon?  <br>it's usually about 3 more hours from now.</br>  <br>Sabo visibly sweating and running around when fighting Fujitora while Fujitora barely moves from his original spot and is not getting tired at all.<br><br>Sorry but Sabo exerts so much effort while barely affecting Fujitora should show you that Sabo isn't close to being Admiral level at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Space Jin is the best.</br>    <br>Or maybe..<br><br>Just fucking maybe..<br><br>The guy was looking for Kaido, couldn't see him because the island is covered in cold as balls snow and that fog and Kaido emerges from it using a stereotypical manga entrance after the guy calls out for him.<br><br>But nah, that would be too logical.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anonymous being mad like underage Akainu.</br>  <br>Sanji has already jobbed twice.</br>  <br><br> this is the level of reader we have in these threads <br><br><br>That wasn't Kaidou. More so than visibility there is no reason to call out for Kaidou if he is a super huge giant. You can walk 20 feet and find him snow or no snow. <br>He called out because apparently he is hard to find.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, it will be a mode related to Hell Memories</br></br>  <br> That being a tower is far more logical than the autistic bullshit you just shitted out you dumb fucking nigger, i swear to god some of you motherfuckers are too stupid to even comprehend a cartoon book whose target audience is 12 year old chinese boys.<br><br> Kill yourself you autistic cunt</br></br></br>  <br>It's a big throne on wheels. Kaido is a midget.</br>  <br>Have you never encountered a combination of incredibly heavy snow with dense fogs before? You would be surprised the shit it could hide from you even at a close distance.</br>  We literally didn't see any of the Mugiwaras.<br><br>This is a fucking shit chapter.</br></br>  <br>This<br><br>If you ever got in a storm/blizzard while skiing, with the snow falling down and fog all around you, you would know you can't even tell up from down, left from right and the furthest you're able to see is less then 5m. It's crazy, man</br></br></br>  <br><br>But what kind of creature is he if that is his silhouette? I agree with the others it's more of a tower/base</br></br>  <br>I don't think it's a tower base. I just think it's an obvious red herring. Everyone goes "OMG KAIDOU IS SO HUGE WTF!"<br><br>And whenever we see him he turns out to be short in stature or a bishie or something completely different. Not quite sure how people are constantly fooled by stuff like this</br></br></br>  <br>He's a giant den den mushi.</br>  <br>I do think he's a giant of some sort, and the twist isn't in being small, but a personality flaw of some sort.<br>Like, a constantly dere side or something.</br></br>   http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/<wbr>2857/1</wbr>   Can someone upload the chapter to Imgur or something? Panda is broken for me.  <br> Panda is broken for me. <br>Panda is broken for everyone anon</br></br>  The wiki summary (inb4 wiki, they at least understand the raws) says that Sakazuki told Fuji that he'll be banned from the marines if he doesn't stop Luffy &amp; Law, which means Fuji will probably quit the marines now.  Oda is such a faggot for creating Fujitora and making him the new Admiral.    He protected his smile.  <br>That implies that Law cut a guy's balls off and touched them<br><br>GAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY</br></br></br>   pangamanda is unreadable shit <br> mangastream translator is asleep <br> Viz just release their official translation </br></br>  How come mangareader panda etc all don't load for me? This is on multiple devices  <br>Seriously, it doesn't make sense at all why a newbie like Fujitora was allowed to go handle Luffy and Law instead of an experienced veteran like Kizaru.</br>  Enemy confirmed.  3 questions I can't find an answer myself:<br><br>Why did akainu send Fuji and not Kizaru/green bull since he knows they are more on the same page as he is then Fuji? There is no way he didn't get to know how issho works in 2 years, so he knew he would fuck up<br><br>What does Capone mean with "ceasar will take you all along with him"? Could it be just mpanda fucking up as usual?<br><br>Why does akainu seem to not give a fuck about what kuzan is doing with BB? Come on, he was a fucking admiral so he's got to be fukkin stronk</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Doflamingo is controlling Kaido from the background  <br><br>Truly a puppetmaster</br></br></br>  <br>i kek'd</br>  <br> implying Shanks won't spank them like children and recruit them under his banner. <br><br><br>My guess is he knows Fuji despises the shichbukai system, so he would gladly revoke Law from his title. Also Aokiji warned Smoker about Dofllamingo.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, sometimes he does ghost dicks/balls instead of drawing a full body.</br>  <br>According to the wiki he wants to capture Caesar for himself</br>  I know this website is shit, but at least you guys can read Aohige's translation instead of pandashit:<br>http://www.mangaspoiler.com/2015/07<wbr>/06/one-piece-793-spoiler-「ワンピース-ネタ<wbr>バレ」-第793話/</wbr></wbr></br>  Thank fuck you can filter trips  <br>It is to be expected. He has the royalties after all</br>  Blackbeard + his 10 giant captains = 11<br><br>Luffy + supernovas = 11, would this mean eventually all of them would be division commanders under Luffy? This doesn't mean each Strawhat won't fight each Blackbeard character, I'm sure they will, but something tells me he will also unite all the supernovas. Shanks will convert the Kidd alliance to their side, or Luffy will stop them before they fuck with Shanks.</br></br>   Doflamingo apparently controls most of the world's devil fruit trade <br> somehow his crew only had shitty ones </br>  <br>I know this wasn't Oda's intention but the one who came out the worst in all of this is Akainu.</br>  <br>What will the human do with the fallen dragon king ? Well, can you imagine ?</br>  <br> カポネ「おーおー、お仲間達は…割と活躍してんじゃねェか　シーザーは必<wbr>ず連れて帰るぞお前ら！！」</wbr> <br> our fellow supernovas are doing some good stuff <br> yes, we'll definitely bring Caesar to you </br></br></br>  <br><br> Fujitora use the title of Sabo to not deal with doflamingo, but the first is more strong.</br></br>  Could these two events be connected?  I don't understand this page. <br><br>What special thing did fujitora do that smoker couldnt do using his power in the navy?<br>He literally sat on his ass the whole fucking time.</br></br></br>  <br>I reckon it's just a building in the second panel.</br>  <br><br><br>Doesn't make sense. Luffy beat Doflamingo. Sabo could have done that.<br><br>And Fujitora couldn't do shit against the birdcage.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Good catch anon.</br>  <br>I took it to mean that Smoker was saying "Even if I was an Admiral I wouldn't have the balls to do what Fujitora did"<br><br>Because he knows a magma fisting is coming</br></br></br>  <br>Would you be able to translate this?<br><br>キッド「あっと言う間に…先手をうたれたな…これは大金星だ！！」<br><br>アプー「ドフラミンゴは確かに裏でカイドウに通じてる」<br><br>ホーキンス「じゃあ奴を怒らせる事になるな…！！」<br><br>キッド「…これが作戦なら…つまりあいつらの目的は」<br><br>ホーキンス「やはり四皇」<br><br>アプー「百獣のカイドウか…！！」<br><br>キラー「狙いが被らなくてよかった　潰し合って無駄な戦力を使わずに済む　<wbr>おれ達の標的は四皇 “赤髪のシャンクス” だ！！」</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, Smoker is a weakling obviously.</br>  Pic related proof that Sanji and Co escaped the Big mom ship since he said we'll look for Caesar.<br><br><br>It's just a snowball not an eye.</br></br></br>  <br>Thanks mate, now it makes much more sense</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Its actually just the rooftop of a building. Take a look at the trees, its probably somewhere in Wano, [spoiler/]which further hints at the upcoming Wano/Kaido arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your mom</br>  <br>I don't get what happens in the new chapter. Even after rearranging mangafox's shitty scan I still don't get the translations. They are all over the place</br>  <br>holy shit, capone is allied with big mom confirmed</br>  http://readms.com/r/one_piece/793/2<wbr>851/4<br><br>a good translation is finally out</br></br></wbr>  <br>Wano is probably the land of cherry blossoms.</br>  thats weird. vizanon only has chapter 791 available  <br>Noice</br>  <br>we already discussed this, Thats just a random new world country that Rogers and Whitebeard went to chill.</br>  <br> MS <br> good <br><br>pick neither<br>i miss Powermanga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kidd: Just like that, they took the intiative from us. That's one spectacular victory !!<br>Apoo: If I remember well, Doflamingo has underground connections with Kaidou.<br>Hawkins: Then this will definitely anger him... !<br>Kidd: If that was their plan, in other words, their objective is...<br>Hawkins: As we though, a yonkou.<br>Kidd: Hundred Beats, Kaidou...!!<br>Killer: I'm glad our objectives don't clash. Affronting one another would have been a waste of military ressources. Our objective is the yonkou, Red haired Shanks !!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I feel like this is Garp talking to Tsuru in this panel, anyone else agree?  <br>I want to know when Tashigi will decide to trip and fall mouth first onto Smokers dick.</br>  <br>What? So you think the connection to Dr Hiluluk is just some random island? We know Wano will be similar to Japan, and cherry blossoms would fit perfectly there.</br>    the most important thing lost in translation<br><br>VEGAPUNK SOON</br></br>  <br>Yeah, it's Garp.</br>  Oda has made Akainu look so pathetic as a leader in all of this. Sends his rookie Admiral to deal with fucking Dressrosa, the said rookie Admiral doesn't inform his boss and goes ahead and embarrasses the organization and now all but looks like he'll abandon them.<br><br>Great. Fucking great.</br></br>  Did you guys notice how in shanks crew almost everyone has a normal cape, while every other cape in one piece is a coat worn as a cape? Knowing Oda this can't be random    <br>Yes, that's what it is.<br>I might be wrong, but I suspect Tsuru is going to see Doflamingo for herself.<br> ガープ「何だおつるちゃん！わざわざ出向く事もなかろう」 <br> What is it O Tsuru chan, there's no need for you to go anywhere </br></br></br></br>  <br>What happened to the Akainu we knew and loved that would kill a soldier just because they lost the will to fight<br><br>I am surprised Akainu even gave Fujitora a chance to clean up the mess he made</br></br></br>  <br>Look at second guy from the left.</br>   No one flipping their shit over this <br><br>Aokiji is now part of the Blackbeard group</br></br>  <br>its clearly totoro u idiots<br><br>thats why hes called "thing"</br></br></br>  <br> almost </br>  <br> What happened to the Akainu we knew and loved that would kill a soldier just because they lost the will to fight <br><br>That was just cannon fodder. Since he spared Aokiji it's implied that those strong enough gain his respect</br></br></br>  <br>He´s just there to gather information</br>  Fujitora's a short sighted tard  <br>Aokiji is using Blackbeard for his own ends i'm sure.</br>  There's a possibility that Fujitora actually means that he wants to quit the marines.<br><br><br>We knew this already speedreader from the conversation between Burgess and Blackbeard.</br></br></br>  So, it appears as though the Gorosei are not among the Tenryuubito, and in fact are below them in authority.... That's interesting, I didn't think that was the case.<br><br>CP0 (and maybe other Chipher Pols?) Work for the Tenryuubito directly<br><br>Kaido is definitely on Wano. Look at the page with the big shadow in the background-- shinto architecture against cherry blossoms<br><br>Capone is working for Big Mom, who is after Ceasar</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because we knew that for years<br><br>cmon man<br><br> things aren't explicitly stated <br> people don't get it. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Capone is working for Big Mom, who is after Ceasar <br>see<br><br>see</br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought we already knew this</br>  <br> So, it appears as though the Gorosei are not among the Tenryuubito, and in fact are below them in authority.... That's interesting, I didn't think that was the case. <br><br>No, that's just mangapanda being retarded, Sakazuki was reffering to Cipher Pol as the celestial dragons puppets.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought SMILE was specifically zoan devil fruit?<br>And I would prefer the real compared to bootleg.</br></br>  <br> You are also forgetting Lucky Roo.</br>  <br>He controls both smiles and real devil fruits</br>  NIGGASTREAM IS OUT!  <br>Stream seems to say the same</br>  <br>No it didn't</br>  Why is Akainu so based  <br>Oda was too busy trying to give Fujitora a character identity that he totally forgot how Akainu would look to the readers.</br>  <br>controlled*<br><br>It was hinted at before but now we know for certain he sold devil fruits as well as smiles along with weapons like the caesar gas. I don't understand how he was so weak in terms of crew power with all that at his disposal. It seemed like he relied entirely on Marines and Kaidou protection rather than bolstering his own forces.</br></br></br>  <br>Who is the new Strawhat!?<br>Fuji gonna leave the Marines?<br>Aokiji a spy? If so, for who?<br>Bellamy for Barto Club?<br>Sanji/Brook/Nami/Chopper/Momo when?<br>Now that everyone hates Law &amp; Luffy is Law's crew dead?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Predictions on Luffy and Law's new bounties?   Capone isn't part of Law/Luffy alliance  <br><br>fuck<br>I was a little excited from last nights speculation</br></br></br>  <br>Being Fleet Admiral is more of a desk job and they have to deal with the political side.</br>  <br>GOD Usopp: 1 billion<br>Luffy: 750 mil<br>Law: 600 mil</br></br></br>  <br>They probably only had access to shitty ones early on and thats why they ate them. Though some of them are pretty strong:<br> Pica <br> Sugar <br> Jora </br></br></br></br>  Will Rebecca join the SH crew?  <br>Yes it did.</br>  <br> Kaido is a Snail Zoan <br> just as tall as the average Den Den Mushi <br> those trees are actually Bonsai or smth <br> Thats why the subordinate asks where he is, he is pretty small <br>Post yfw this happens</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>His crew was so weak because he did all of this shit by himself. Lao G even said that that he 'left alone again' multiple times at the beginning of the arc. His crew didnt do anything but chill. Diamante for example fought fodder in the colosseum. He himself wasnt weak. Took around a thousand people to beat him and Luffy received almost as much handholding as he received in MF.</br>  <br>You think interacting with old geezers all day long sipping tea and arguing Navy budget has made him soft?<br><br><br>I mean why even waste time eating the sui sui</br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, his crew did have a much higher devil fruit percentage than most</br>  <br>I would for Bellamy to join but it wont happen. Maybe he'll lead a flert like Barto</br>  <br>But I thought he was drafted. What good does it to allow him to quit?</br>  <br>but they are</br>  <br> kaido is actually a den den mushi that ate the snail snail fruit to become a double snail giant </br>  So we all agree that Fujitora just deserted the Marines, right?  <br>Holy shit, is this the first time we see the garousei in perspective? They seem fucking taller/as tall as akainu.</br>  <br>So you think he handed them out as he got them and they just got stuck with shittier than normal fruits gambling on powers rather than the powerful ones he would know the name of? <br><br>I guess that makes sense. Also it seems as though the "connection" spandam was talking about when he got the soap soap and the giraffe was Doflamingo even though it was never stated.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuji confirmed for next Mugiwara</br>  <br>I always thought the Gorosei were above the World Nobles</br>  <br>Hmm on second thought maybe you're right, I still think they are celestial dragons.<br><br><br>Bellamy is more likely to join Law due to his tattoo and because Law can be his new pride of the North Blue, which is why he joined Doffy in the first place. Also he needs to survive the great wave mentioned in pic related.<br><br><br>Because he's already done what he needed, revealed the truth about the shichibukai so now he's closer to his true goal.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Based translator help them what does this say?<br><br>赤犬「ほいじゃあドフラミンゴ七武海脱退から誤報の一件…！！あんたらの…<wbr>もっと上からの指示っちゅう事ですかい<br><br>なぜドフラミンゴごときの為に！！世界が振り回されにゃいけんのですか！！<wbr><br><br>今後もこがいな事があっちゃあわしが元帥として恰好つかんですけ！！金輪際<wbr>やめておくんない！！」<br><br>五老星「…生意気な口をきくなサカズキ」「お前の面子など取るに足らん！！<wbr>」<br><br>「お前達海軍は政府の “表” の顔」「この案件は “CP” に一任したのだ！！」<br><br>赤犬「CPか…早ァ話があんたらも頭飛び越えられたんと違いますか！？天竜<wbr>人の傀儡に！！」<br><br>五老星「口を謹めサカズキ」「クザンの件はどうだ…あの巨大な戦力が今や “黒ひげ” に加担しているとは！！軍の体面も何もあるまい」</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Because he's already done what he needed, revealed the truth about the shichibukai so now he's closer to his true goal. <br><br>I meant from the Marines' perspective. You don't draft someone into a high position of military service and casually let them leave it</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I assumed as well</br>  Nominally, the Gorosei are under the Celestial Dragons but in reality they detain all the power and just have to serve the CDs every now and then  <br>Something about child pornography</br>  <br>What? That's silly, if you piss of the boss you're fired, it's simple.</br>   looks at Doflamingo <br> folds the newspaper, looks at Law and tries piecing two and two together <br>This makes me happy for some reason. I like that these two are kind of tied by destiny.</br></br>  <br>she just got her dad back she's not leaving the island</br>  <br>WOW i can actually understand whats going on now</br>  <br>Of course he's sweating, he's made of fire</br>  <br>If you piss off your commanding officer, you're court marshalled</br>  <br>Because it was bullshit from the start. He should have never gotten the Admiral job and never should have been sent to Dressrosa.

Given the amount of power that have, for absolutely no reason, there shouldn't be anyone that orders them around.</br>  <br>As an extremist I'd expect him to threaten to throw Isshou into Impel Down</br>  <br>forgot this</br>  so, has Uroge received an unexpected visit on a sky island?

So, in other words, do you mean to say that you guys were walked all over ? By these puppets the tenryubitos are/the puppets of the tenryubitos ?<br>What's certain is that the Tenryubito did everything behing the Gorosei's back. Which means they're below them when it comes to power.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's on her ship. I think its much more likely that they're watching the Sunny Coup de Burst away (all looking up), and Capone is hearing about Doflamingo from a Big Mom officer. He's telling them he'll personally bring Caesar back. American gangsters he's based off of refer to everyone as "our friend"<br><br>This double agent thing is reading too much into it</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hito Hito no Mi, Model: Big Nigga</br>  <br>I think somewhere it was said that the Tenryuubito are made of 20 original kings? I don't remember where that was. I've always assumed that there are different "clans" of Tenryuubito, and the head of each of those "clans" has authority in their community</br>  <br>he ate the jobber jobber no mi<br><br>If your power is growing muscles you just know you will be a jobber.

Like a deer to fit the king of the forest/king of the beasts thing, but it isn't something inherently broken, and Kaido's strength comes from himself mostly.</br>  <br>I knew it</br>  <br><br><br><br>Maybe he'll be an antlion.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The common theory is they need her to use her powers on the gorosei or something.

Something like a squirrel or raccoon. I just want more creativity and shit, showing us that you don't need a god tier zoan to be effective.</br>  <br> Finally get a chapter with substance <br> Filled to the brim with information on others <br>Somehow I think this would have worked as 2 chapters</br></br></br>  <br>After 700 years, I would imagine there are far more than that</br>  <br>Fujitora is going to "fail" at capturing the same way aokiji and garp does</br>  <br> I guess they are actually Celestial Dragons themself <br>Why would they be ? I don't think a single tenryubito would be as competent as they are. Moreover, the hair and clothes don't fit. They're probably just promoted CP/Marines.</br></br>  <br>Seems fitting for Kaido to be a Kaijuu.</br>  <br> Godzilla <br>Kaidou is a giant who ate the Lizard Lizard fruit, Model Carolina Anole.</br></br>  <br>I'm not sure, in the anime its cape has sleeves, but in the manga it doesn't seem to. Same with the other guy with the pink coat<br><br>  captcha: teaching Google honey isn't a beverage </br></br></br>  <br>This is usually how a one piece chapter is supposed to look like. It was supposed to be the norm not the exception. oda had been slacking post time skip</br>  <br> Killer can eat spaghetti through his mask. <br><br>He would have destroyed pic related.</br></br></br>  <br>Are the Gorousei actually strong? Or just really tall and old guys?</br>  <br>We don't know.</br>  <br>Presumably, since one of them carries a sword</br>  When will Akainu stage a coup and calls himself fuhrer?  any chance Kaido might have a Hydra zoan? I think that would fit him. That, or a Chimera Zoan that allows him to change his appearance between a very vast number of animal mixes at will (you know, manticore first, big ass minotaur later, shit like that).  We Kars now   <br>I'm surprised no one pointed out the huge scar and chipped ear on the right side of his face, we've only seen his left side until this chapter came out.</br>  <br>I think one of them has a Dragon Zoan type devil fruit power</br>  <br> By these puppets the tenryubitos are/the puppets of the tenryubitos ? <br><br>This confuses me is it worded strangely in Japanese?</br></br></br>  <br>we did. You´re just late</br>  <br>Not at all, it's just that Oda didn't feel like making Doffy lose too easily so he made the fight last 30 chapters. Of course there's no room for information the focus is on two characters butting heads.</br>  <br>not soon enough as far as I'm concerned</br>  <br>I wouldn't really say Oda's been slacking Post-TS so much as, the "action" part of the arcs have been a bit too long. <br><br>I mean, the chapters before/after the arc fights are generally pretty filled with world-building information. <br><br>Dressrosa just had too many mini-boss fights so it felt even longer than usual to get to the "info", let alone Dressrosa being the longest arc in OP.</br></br></br></br></br>  So when do find out what happened with the other half of the crew?  <br>Seems like they might be.<br>Maybe a bit rusty.<br>I get the impression that they're ex-admirals.</br></br></br>  <br>Good point but I guess we all expected him to have battle wounds from Aokiji</br>  <br>He's a roach type</br>  I really liked the idea of Urouge working with Blackbeard before, but seeing him still going it alone is pretty cool. Just sucks we have no idea how long it will be before he's relevant again<br><br>Who chased them up into the clouds? Enel?   Shiki? </br></br>  <br>Pretty soon, seems like Capone is there to save them or betray Big Mam and steal Caesar.</br>  <br>There was a comparison of Spanda and the gorousei during enies lobby arc but it was crappy quality.</br>  <br>I hope it's Enel, I kind of miss that motherfucker.<br><br>Shiki? Unlikely. What business does he have with Urouge?</br></br></br>  <br>holy fuck capone has been with her all this time</br>  <br>Why no other scanlator group picks One Piece to translate? With OP's popularity I thought there would be more scanlator working on it.<br>Well there was Powermanga, but they're pretty much dead now.</br></br>  <br>this brings up the question: who is gonna end up killing shanks at a crucial moment to get luffy on a path of revenge?</br>  <br><br><br> Aokiji: Did you know Akainu that ice can get so cold it ʙᴜʀɴꜱ magma </br></br></br>  <br>More importantly<br>Is the bald fuck from wano or just a weeaboo?</br></br>  <br>How fucking sick wouldn't that have been? <br> I love how they portrayed roaches like niggers </br></br>  <br>None<br>Luffy has to fight and give him his hat back atone point</br></br>   Kaido's first form   <br>a lot of scanlator groups dropped out the game when dmca notices started flying around. Back when a lot of manga sites like one manga got shutdown</br>  <br>Enel almost seems too obvious, and to me it looks like they fled the sea to the clouds, and someone unexpectedly followed them. He'd know all about Enel</br>  <br>It's just that it can mean both. I personally think the most plausible interpretation is the tenryuubito themselves being the puppets, since they're figureheads, but it's also possible that Akainu is referring to CP/a third party above the Gorosei as the puppets of the tenryuubito.<br>It doesn't really matter, either way, both interpretations are valid and don't change the fact that the Gorosei are pushovers.</br></br>  <br><br>Mangastream helps confirm it since, in context, "nakama/friend" is used in the traditional sarcastic way.<br><br> "Oh hey, our friends are doing pretty good!" <br> "And since now we know for a fact that the hardest hitter of the crew is effectively stranded on Dressrosa, we can go fuck up the skeleton crew and grab Caesar" <br><br>Also holy shit I just realized<br><br> Sunny took off with the just bare minimum number of Straw Hats needed to leave <br> Sanji to guard, Nami to navigate, Chopper to be a doctor <br> Brook is there to make it an actual skeleton crew. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So.. Fujitora for next nakama?  <br>Shanks ain't gonna die, it makes me wonder though. Is Shanks all talk, all we've seen is Lucky shoot someone in the head and Ben beat a few bandits up. Oda has got to have Shanks entire strength and power locked up, or else we're just seeing a party animal.</br>  <br>I said I hope it's Enel, not that I think it will be him. It's pointless to speculate, I figure it's pretty much impossible to make a sensate argument out of it.<br><br> My bet is on Apoo though </br></br></br>  <br> Shanks ain't gonna die <br><br>His deathflag was announced the moment he put the cap on luffy's head</br></br></br>  <br>So would zoro</br>  <br>we see apoo eating spaghetti with the kidpoohaw alliance</br>  <br>Considering everyone shit their pants when they showed up and immediately stopped a huge ass war, its assumed they're strong as fuck outside of their pirate rights.<br>Shanks only has one arm and still continues to be a Yonkou without question, and Lucky Roux held a man who can move at the speed of light at gunpoint before he could notice. Also King's Haki yadda yadda.</br></br>  <br>he stopped easily one of Akainu's punches and clashed with Whitebeard, he's by no means all talk. I agree though, we have yet to see what he can do. Same about his crew</br>  <br> Shanks <br> all talk <br>Nigga, I bet he's the strongest yonko and will most likely whoop cpt kid &amp; co if they try to fight him</br></br></br>  <br>The author is /pol/ as fuck</br>  <br>of fucking course they are strong, every single leader in this manga has been 100x stronger than their subordinates, these guys are end game strong. (the exception of course being buggy) <br><br>plus they are doffy sized so we know they aren't fucking around</br></br></br>   Bonney is still eating pizza   <br>that was lucky<br><br>Even Kizaru said his name <br><br> Ohhhh nooo it's bennnn beckmannnn' <br><br>how can you miss that one</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>right, for some reason I completely forgot about it</br>   rebecca is gonna be a crew member <br> bellamy is going to be a crew member <br> viola is going to be a crew member <br>Put them on the thousand sunny with all the strawhats. They won't add anything to the dynamic.</br></br></br>  <br> Spandam </br>  It left kinda ambiguous, is Fuji going to go after the strawhats or is he accepting that the marine's will be closed to him after what he did?<br><br>Also, seems like the Gorosei don't hold as much power as the celestial dragons, i figure they're the ones running shit fro then since most of the nobles seem to stupid to run anything thenselves, so i guess in a way they are above then.</br></br>  How high will be new bounty for Luffy, Law and others?  <br> Is Shanks all talk <br><br>Dudes got an AOE conquerors aura just by giving the slightest fuck, he don't fuck around.</br></br></br>  <br>Based on the context and "tone" of Fuji's responses, its highly leaning to ditching the marines.</br>  <br>The latter. He's not going to chase the Lawhats after he bet on them to sort this shit out. Although he might make a token pretend gesture.</br>  <br><br>It's probably the relationship a most trusted advisor has with a child ruler<br><br> Most trusted advisor actually runs shit, child ruler just a figurehead <br> But if the child ruler screams loud enough, the most trusted advisor's hands are tied and they have to do what they want. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally another proof that big mom is going to be luffy's ally in killing Kaido (thanks to nami's vivre card).<br><br>There is no other way that Sanji would've escaped any other way.</br></br></br>  <br>we don't know, most likely the latter. I really hope he doesn't try to fuck Law and Luffy up because they have plot armor and he would most likely accomplish nothing. Akainu will remain mad as fuck either way. I guess he regrets choosing him.</br>  <br>He'll probably ask them what their plans are and then warn them that if they cross paths again he'll be after them. He'll retreat saying the coliseum warriors + revolutionary army was protecting law + luffy.</br>  <br> Shanks ain't gonna die <br>Yeah he will, BB will kill him.</br></br>  <br>More importantly, how high will God Usopp's bounty rise and will his new poster replace Sogeking?</br>  What did Drake do with Caribou? Was his death that quick not to show on the cover of a chapter?  <br>I'll be severely butt sore if he dies before Luffy can meet up with him.</br>  <br> honey isn't a beverage <br>You never tried mead? Do so, it's great</br></br>  <br>Caribou knows about Poseidon, I don't think he was killed just like that. He probably informed Kaido or something, but there's no way someone with such informations and that received a cover story is going to die just like that</br>  <br> Yasopp won't even realize his kid has been with Luffy all this time </br>  Fujitora is so base I could hardly read the pages with him in it cause the neighbors kept complaining about the noise .  <br> More importantly, how high will God Usopp's bounty rise and will his new poster replace Sogeking? <br><br>Why would Usopps bounty replace Sogekings? Usopp doesn't even have a bounty yet.</br></br></br>  <br>god usopp was the best part of this entire arc <br><br>and his snipe was 10 times cooler than the entire fight between doffy and luffy</br></br></br>  <br>That'll probably be somewhere very late in the story though if it ever happens. Luffy will undoubtedly take his place as a Yonkou when it happens.</br>  <br>God I want another round of reactions when bounties go up<br> Shanks <br> Buggy <br> Moriah </br></br></br></br>  <br>This, if you like sweet wines mead is based as fuck</br>  <br>Kizaru's a trickster but Lucky did move pretty fast. Wasn't he hailed as one of the fastest dudes in the world or something? We've seen jackshit of Shanks' crew aside from what little towards those 3, really.</br>  <br>Nice catch. Damn, who would have thought.</br>   Kyros disbanding the dwarf squad so he can join the Lawhat crew    Still no sign of Sunny's crew  <br><br>Come now now, they've not shown their faces since december 2014, it's about time.</br></br>  <br> not posting the superior version </br>  <br>That's mean Sanji has been captured by capone .</br>  <br>and thats the crew that ran with whitebeard passing out</br>   Strawhats and Law are gonna scooby doo it out of Dressorsa, with the fairies and shitters helping them out <br>Should be cool.</br>  <br> and his snipe was 10 times cooler than the entire fight between doffy and luffy <br><br><br>This is how I expected high level haki battles to be with focus on how it's being used throughout the fights in key moments. <br><br>instead it's all CoA blackening.<br><br>I meant it wasnt fucking lucky<br><br>it was ben beckmann<br><br>He explicitly said the name <br><br>how the fuck do you misremember a scene like this so badly</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No it doesn't. It means they still haven't captured Caesar. So chances are they escaped already.</br>   promoting a recruit to Admiral <br>I don't care how super stronk he is, that's a terrible terrible decision</br>  <br> &gt;Moriah <br>who</br></br>  <br> Beast Ganondorf <br>Holy fucking damn, it is called Ganon. Ganon existed before Ganondorf, why are you so young?</br></br>  <br>Most of whitebeard's crew was chumps. they were llike a yonkou version of doflamingo's crew<br><br>Almost all of the power concentrated into whitebeard.<br><br>with thatch/blackbeard/ace around they were way stronger however with just marco and jozu and to a lesser extent vista they are completely negligible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Come one, we all know the real leader was rob lucci</br>  Nico Robin-CHAAAAAAAAAAAAAWN  <br>from his interactions with smoker and akainu he seems to be a former marine not just a brand new recruit.<br><br>He probably retired after losing his eyesight or something</br></br></br>  Imagine being a veteran VA<br>Imagine serving in the Marines for 20-30 years and then to see some no name recruit take your rightful place in the Admirals' trio</br>  <br>kizaru gives no shits</br>  <br>Absalom saved Moriah from Doflamingo, now that I think about it why wasn't he shown in this chapter?</br>  <br>Nemean Lion was basically immune to physical damage and Hercules had to strangle him instead.</br>  <br>My theory is that he was recruited as a plot to integrate Wano into the world government, he looks very much like a samurai and even has the same wooden sandals as Kinemon, Momo and Ryuma.</br>  <br><br><br>It makes little sense for "inspector-general" to be Garp, we all thought he was kicking back at Luffy's native island. Plus I don't think he'd renounce his rank as a vice-admiral just to have a different job in the same organization.<br>That being said, I have no suggestion as to who "inspector-general" could be or why he would order Tsuru around. I came in this thread to ask...</br></br></br></br>   post yfw best character probably won't ever return   <br> be a sentient being of light <br> everyone seems to be not moving at all <br> having the time to give fucks </br></br></br>  <br>Absalom was.</br>  <br><br>Look at the scrublord VA's we've seen.<br><br>The strongest so far (besides Garp, who was only a VA because he didn't care) has been Onigumo, and he kind of sucks. Strawberry, Doberman, Maynard, etc. all suck.</br></br></br></br>  <br>vegapunk arc</br>  <br>I'm gonna go with this one, with all the Trafalgar Waterloo stuff he's gotta be a manlet like Napoleon</br>  <br>Are you retarded? If nothing moved, you had plenty of time to give fucks.</br>  I read mangastream's version now. Glad to see while mangapanda was even worse than usual, almost unreadable, mangastream was quite good. I get the feeling they have been less "niggastream" lately, though it's not completely gone.  <br>Maybe if the VAs that aren't named Garp weren't such massive jobbers they would've got a promotion.</br>  <br>It's Garp dude, his gag is always about sharing biscuits or what ever the fuck he eats. He did the same thing in Laws flashback and I think also Chapter 0</br>  <br>It won't be him.</br>  <br>we are headed to vegapunk in a couple of chapters apparently we know what was big enough for chapter 800 and what Oda has been stalling for<br><br>Vegapunks appearance.<br><br><br><br>That's the problem. By the time he gives a fuck relative to himself eons have passed. And he runs out of fuck energy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yea, i think this is a new low for panda, i didnt understand a thing.</br>  <br>Surprise appearance. <br><br><br>It is Garp. The banter is 100% him, as is the cracker eating. <br><br>When he and Sengoku retired, Kong let them keep their status and train new recruits</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I thought Kidd and crew were at war with Big Mom? I wonder why and when their objective turn to shanks.  <br>Really? Where?</br>  <br><br>Momonga is fucking GOAT. And if the Marines bothered to give him a hax fruit like they gave Issho he'd certainly be Admiral level.</br></br>  <br>No we're not, they said a few days away, and this is only the second day of the New World. We've been in the timeskip for 5-6 years yet in story time has only been two days.</br>  <br> Plus I don't think he'd renounce his rank as a vice-admiral just to have a different job in the same organization <br>That's exactly what he did dude. He wanted to resign from the marine but Kong wouldn't let him because he's a hero whose name carries weight so he remained in the marine as an honorary member. Sengoku did the same.</br></br>  <br>he was standing on side of fujitora taking a picture<br><br><br>also I just realized something<br><br><br> absalom on dressrosa  <br> using his invisible powers to take pictures like normal <br> fujitora is blind and senses him just like anyone else <br> asks what he is up to <br> everyone wonders if Fujitora is going crazy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Any character in One Piece not returning ever <br><br>Expect some Gaimon action in the Kaido arc.<br><br> RIP Kuro </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In every single panel dude. You just couldn't see him</br>  <br>no shit? He said he will appear in Vegapunk's arc, and that's the most likely scenario Oda could use to bring him back<br><br><br>I doubt we'll be seeing Vegapunk anytime soon</br></br></br></br>  <br> We've been in the timeskip for 5-6 years yet in story time has only been two days. <br><br>I hate this meme<br><br>smoker and fake kuina just said they are going to see him. it's happening</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I thought Kidd and crew were at war with Big Mom?  <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>He probably has something like that in store if and when Fuji fails to get Law and Luffy. Could easily try him for treason (With himself as the court, of course) and execute/imprison him</br>  <br> Lost his entire marine crew to Kobra Footpussy and didn't fight back <br><br>Hes shit.</br></br></br>  <br>That doesn't mean we see him though</br>  <br>Trust the tripfag to be retarded</br>  I'm hoping we get to see vegapunk during smoker's visit. For some reason i imagine him as this normal looking scientist guy, with big glasses. I imagine Oda will give him a more unique design tough.  <br>Garp only stayed VA because going up to admiral would have more restrictions.</br>  <br> successfully forced Hancock to come to the war <br> successfully forced Hancock to turn all of his crew back from stone <br>He didn't lose shit</br></br></br>  <br>that does not by any means imply we're going to see him. It may serve as a plot point later. Besides, they stated it will take them a few days to get to him, you do realize how slowly time passes in OP right?<br><br>it's not like I wouldn't enjoy to finally see that fucker, but I have my doubts. Oh well, I guess we'll just have to wait.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, that's the thing! It was so bad that the point of the dialogue was not conveyed, becoming nonsensical or even changing the meaning. But I thought mangastream were better than they usually are, as well.</br></br>  <br>I'm looking forward to Vegapunk being a german stereotype scientist.</br>  <br>we have a lot of posibilities for chapter 800:<br><br>Kaido reveal<br>Vegapunk reveal<br>Greenbull reveal<br>New Shichibukai reveal<br>Or something totally unexpected</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can´t wait for vegapunk being a woman all this time</br>  <br>If we're doing Greek shit, then this motherfucker better have mythical zoan Typhon, father of all monsters</br>   vegapunk is chopper wearing those fake mustache glasses   <br>I just hope he isn't as qwirky as he sounds. Qwirky mad scientists are so overdone. Also it would make for a nice contrast to Caesar if he was a serious guy.</br>  <br>I appreciate the attempt at not forcing swears into the dialogue, but "bloody" sounds silly and awkward if you aren't a brit/aussy. Just stick to damn if you absolutely have to do it</br>  Why all these supernova so obsessed with 4 Emperor so much? Why don't they just focus to One Piece without looking out for trouble with 4 emperor?  God how I've waited for a chapter like this. It's just so much informations<br><br> Kuzan/Blackbeard alliance confirmed <br> Gorosei and the whole world fucking PISSED at Luffy and Law, haters gonna hate <br> Garp hanging out with Tsuru, having a nice time  <br> Urouge not part of Blackbeard and hanging out on a sky island but he's approached by someone (thinks like this are never random in One Piece, could it be Enel?) <br> "papa" joined "mama" confirmed. Always believed this could be a thing. Hell they might even be on the ship chasing Sanji and the others right at the moment. <br> Kidd alliance plan to take down fucking SHANKS. Future clash with Luffy is pretty much confirmed now. <br> KAIDOUKAIDOUKAIDOUKAIDOU <br>"Kaidou sama where are you?" this might be a hint and the colossal shadow might just be there to throw us off. Ant DF might really happen.<br> Oh yeah, Drake part of Kaidou gang confirmed now but that was obvious as fuck <br> Smoker going to Vegapunk. Now we know when we'll see them again I guess. <br> Fujitora sticking out the finger to Akainu and the WG. <br>but yeah I guess he'll chase the strawhats now. Well, right after the big arc finale party of course.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hancock did that because luffy</br>  <br> not liking niggastream </br>  <br>No he is gonna stay with the marines.Also why would Fuji leave after he managed to get rid of one warlord? All he has to do is figure out a way by getting rid of the rest, which will probably be by using others to take them on.</br>  Is it just me or does akainu looks skinny as in the new chapter?  <br>Cause he destroyed some of her ships</br>  <br>Hundred headed hydra. Oda loves his double meanings.</br>  <br>They're having an orgy with the heart pirates on zou</br>  <br>They attacked her ships.</br>  <br> A Dr. Robotnik Dr. Wily looking scientist </br>   smokerand tashigi are back <br><br>FUUUUARK YES</br></br>  <br>Did you miss chapters 1-790 of one piece?<br><br>The yonkous control the new world. They control the islands. They control the waters. They control the people.<br><br>You can't get to one piece without allying with them or taking them out.<br><br>They have been the major obstacles in the standstill for the last couple of decades.<br><br><br>The only people capable of taking them on are other yonkou. Who don't want to become susceptible to another yonkou even if they win.<br><br>or the marines who don't want to get decimated taking down one yonkou letting the other three run free.<br><br>It's been one giant stalemate in the world and the supernovas will finally shake things up</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Niggastream is always better for the big three + fairy tail. I stay away from it for nanatsu no taizai though.</br>  <br>Baron Tamago said that Kidd destroyed some of their ships</br>  <br> yfw it's a Stroheim parody </br>  <br>Kidd probably just didn't give a crap.</br>  <br>Yeah, if I were to take that as a building, than it has to be something with exagerated chinese/japanese architecture (Forbidden Palace, Osaka Castle, etc). <br><br>Also, Kinemon and Momo's reaction to Kaido's name when Law and Luffy explained alliance and plans after Punk Hazard = Wano<br><br>I'm hoping for Wano, baby</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah because the 4 emperors will let you get to One Piece if you just look out to avoid any trouble. Considering they want it too and all of that. God, why am I even replying</br>  <br>You mean the actual Stroheim, or the Jojo Stroheim? Because the latter one already is a parody.</br>  <br>You fucking better get a non-terrible crop of that Caesar face, anon<br><br>2 fucking watermarks I am offended</br></br></br>  <br>It changes over time. For a period, when mangastream were relatively bad and mangapanda relatively good I haven't bothered to read the mangastream versions. That period has now seemingly ended, for good or bad.</br>  Shanks is so dead.<br>Not by kidd, it's fairly obvious BB will creep in, but still, the death flag has been raised.</br>  Kuzan has not joined BB, Blackbeard just managed to defeat Kuzan and steal his powers, one of his crewmembers has been using it publicly and so rumours has spread that Kuzan has joined him.  <br> tripfag <br><br><br>Surely there is a point in hiding a tower instead of just showing it, and writing a "DON!!" (as, "ta-daah") when all you're HALF-SHOWING is a fucking tower. SO MYSTERIOUS.<br><br><br>In another topic though, did enyone notice that Capone is about to clash with Big Mom?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we literally saw Kuzan like 2 days ago.</br>  <br><br> BB <br> Beating Kuzan <br><br>Ye, no</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kuzan was on Punk Hazard something like one or two days before Dressrosa. What the fuck are you smoking?</br>  <br>Remember that conversation Burgess and BB had on Dressrosa via den-den-mushi?<br>Apparently not.</br></br>  <br><br> 2 days <br>More like 1 year<br> I forgot sorry </br></br></br></br>  <br>How about the fattie in the lower left corner?</br>  <br> doffy killed both Drake and Law's dad  <br> on the same day <br>Heh, I never realized.</br></br></br>  <br>Shows what a good sport Drake is, he didn't even give a shit.</br>  What type of zoan is kaido????<br> He ain't no Fucking ant,Dragon,Godzilla or typhon and this chapter proves it. Remember when scotch said that the winter island kaido was on was his favorite? That's a keyword right there, winter. Remember how chopper loved the winter side of punk hazard? This obviously confirms one thing. Kaidos zoan has fur. Godzilla,ants,and dragons don't have fur. Also right now kaido is on a winter island. We don't know if that silhouette was kaido(it probably is) but we know that he's on that island since his crew member was shouting where he was implying that kaido was on that island. Also the silhouette shows kaido has horns. Ants and Godzilla do not have horns. I'm starting to believe kaido has a yeti zoan but I'm probably wrong.</br>  <br> yeti <br>Maybe. Could be a Wendigo.</br></br>  <br> an admiral beating a yonkou <br>Then why are the yonkou a threat?</br></br>  <br> who is enel </br>  OFFICIAL POLITICAL POWER RANKING OF THE WORLD GOVERNMENT<br><br>Tenryubito &gt; CP0 &gt; or = Gorosei &gt; Kong &gt; Fleet Admiral &gt; The rest<br><br>Up until this chapter we knew that the Tenryubito was at the top and that the Gorosei were below them, but what we didn't know was how powerful CP0 was within the World Government.<br><br>In this chapter, we learned that the Tenryubito used CP0 as puppets to trick the Gorosei about Doflamingo quitting the Seven Warlords, which means that CP0 has more power than (or possibly the same amount as) the Gorosei since if CP0 had less power than the Gorosei, they would not be the ones that the Tenryubito asked to trick the world + the Gorosei.<br><br>Also if you don't remember who Kong is, then kindly re-read the ending of the Marineford arc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We don't know if that silhouette was kaido(it probably is) <br>I think he has the "building-rooftops-are-not-animals"<wbr> zoan.<br> What type of zoan is kaido???? <br> He ain't no Fucking ant <br>Get it right, it's an ant LOGIA if anything.</br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> Wealthy and caring dad living in nice country <br><br> Abusive dad always on the road </br></br></br>  <br>It's a reindeer zoan</br>  <br><br>CP0 has more power than the Gorosei, in the sense that they answer directly to the Celestial Dragons. On their own, I don't think they hold political sway one way or the other.<br><br>They're more than likely the Celestial Dragon's personal shady enforcement agency for when they need to do something even a marine admiral can't muster.</br></br></br></br>  <br> with thatch <br>How do we know Thatch was anything?</br></br>  <br>He's a Giant that ate a mythical zoan.</br>  <br>We know he was the commander of the 4th division, putting him between Joz and Vista.</br>  <br> Also if you don't remember who Kong is <br>What gets you so passive aggressive here? I'm pretty sure people remember who Kong is.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>So that means Doflamingo wasn't talking about the Gorosei ordering the hit on Moria, but those people "higher"?<br><br>Does this shed any light to the WG worker Doflamingo was talking to in Chapter 595?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I always assumed he was talking to one of the CP0 guys because they had a similar hat.</br>  <br><br>Don't think you can really say that CP0 has political power. They are secret agents who basically works as extensions of the Tenryubito. The Gorosei and the others have some political agency of their own even though they are hierarchally below the Tenryubito.</br></br>  <br><br> What gets you so passive aggressive here? I'm pretty sure people remember who Kong is. <br><br>If that final comment came out as passive aggressive then I apologize, that was not my intent.<br><br>I just wrote it because I know that there will be at least one person in this thread who won't remember since it's been a while since we've seen him, and because I'm not the kind of guy who likes to spoon feed people with easily accessible info, I simply meant for that last line to nod them in the right direction without giving them the whole detail.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>How about a Yeti that ate some random zoan? Precious ant theorie would still be possible then.</br></br>  <br><br>They've had worse moments this arc alone.</br></br>    <br><br>Sorry for the late reply, I just work up after staying up late for the spoilers.</br></br>  I want Crocodile  <br>I think that silhouette is kaido but a bunch of other anons are saying it's a building. I don't know what to believe anymore.</br>  Why isn't Akainu all pompous and silly looking like Sengoku was? I know he isn't the type to pay attention to visual stuff like that, but he just looks like a regular admiral. He needs atleast something to make him stick out, and obviously it would fit with his idea of making the navy more, well, intimidating.<br><br><br>Maybe it just has to do with the way I read 4chan posts in my head. If they are phrased in a friendly manner, I usually suspect passive aggressive demi-butthurt.</br></br></br>  <br>I thought it was Kaidou, too, at first.<br>But considering the trees everywhere, and the "eye" being snow, I don't think so anymore.</br></br>  <br>The ant theory is retarded</br>  <br>He ate the house house no mi zoan.</br>  <br>I never said otherwise</br>   Killer eating spagghetti through his mask <br>Cute.</br>  I'll start.    Autism: the MC<br><br>Finally a relatable MC</br></br>  <br>She's just so adorable.</br>  <br>This</br>  Her character feels artificial somehow. I don't know, it's like I can't her as an actual person. I have the same problem with shounen leads like Luffy.  <br><br>Autistic <br><br><br><br>Schizophrenic delusions</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's just so based.</br>  <br>I have a friend who's almost like Hajime, the difference is she's actually going through something big in life</br>  <br>  Autistic <br>  still better than most MC's in all of anime </br></br>  <br>Anon, I don't think an autist can relate to somebody who is the polar opposite of autistic.</br>  <br> friend <br> she <br>You lost me.</br></br></br>  <br> Schizophrenic delusions <br><br>What?</br></br></br>  <br>Actually she is insufferable</br>  <br>The fairies anon, they aren't actually there</br>  <br><br>I honestly don't get this show. <br>I made it 6 episodes in and almost fell asleep.</br></br></br>  <br>It must be nice to be alone in this world, anon.</br>  <br>Did you move here straight from reddit yesterday?</br>  Ohana  <br>I'm not sure what the explanation for that screencap is, but not only are the fairies real,  Watashi is also one of them.  In the LN, at least.</br>  <br>I actually did, yes.</br>  She was so refreshing that she even changed Bluetsutsu.  Koto.    <br>Everybody knows alien robots can't see fairies.</br>  <br>The freshest</br>  <br>I just finished watching the first series and I only want to say I hated this little shit. You'd think Mary Sueness and mental retardation would be mutually exclusive, but no. At least she's cute.</br>  <br>Hajime isn't remotely autistic.</br>  <br><br><br>  autism suddenly became a different thing </br></br></br>  <br>I never said she's autistic, just a generic "mental retardation". If we want to be specific she's more of a mix of ADHD and the mental age of a six year old.</br>  <br>Hajime's genki personality is probably not the real deal.<br><br>She apparently repeatedly says something akin to "I hope I can keep thinking that way." in the time leading up to the final confrontation with Katze.</br></br></br>  <br>If this mental retardation can positively change the world, then I wouldn't mind.</br>  <br>Only a retard could misinterpret the character this much.</br>  <br>Preach.</br>  I'm beginning to think that Hajime is putting on a front and has deeper machinations going in her mind. Scenes like this make me think that.  <br>Hajime tends to be extremely sharp about knowing what other people are thinking and extremely skillful in dealing with them. There's nothing of mentally retarded or autistic in her.</br>  <br> just a generic "mental retardation" <br>It's funny how often bunch of shut-ins, actual autists, loners and social outcasts diagnose cheerful outgoing characters with bright outlook on life as mentally ill.<br>Different != broken. I wish anons would realize this.</br></br></br>  <br>The gray feelings marker was ominous as fuck too.</br>  Moeblobs are the worst thing to happen to anime. This is why people cant take anime seriously. Its about 80% little girls with eyes like footballs and no originality because thats what you faggots keep buying into.  Not my fault the people that take anime seriously doesn't support the industry.  <br> This is why people cant take anime seriously. <br>I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that anime is for children.</br></br>  What video games does /a/ play since Anime is dead now?  <br>Then why do you neckbearded autistic fucks watch it?</br>  <br>Why would you want people to take anime seriously? The only reason I can think of is to make legitimate your hobby and convert your knowledge of the medium into social capital like those who watch large amounts of films or listen to a lot of music can. If anime were acceptable you could impress your normalfag friends with your powerlevel. That's what you want isn't it OP?</br>  <br>Critics who treat 'adult' as a term of approval, instead of as a merely descriptive term, cannot be adult themselves. To be concerned about being grown up, to admire the grown up because it is grown up, to blush at the suspicion of being childish; these things are the marks of childhood and adolescence. And in childhood and adolescence they are, in moderation, healthy symptoms. Young things ought to want to grow. But to carry on into middle life or even into early manhood this concern about being adult is a mark of really arrested development. When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.</br>  <br> Moe <br> "moe means cute" <br>&gt;&gt;&gt;/gaia/<br><br/></br></br></br></br>   /tv/ tries to discuss anime again <br><br/></br>  /tv/ is not /a/ related.<br>I suggest you fuck off back there.</br>  <br> /tv/ is not /a/ related. <br><br>Anime is /a/ related,and i see anime.</br></br></br>  A great month for us fans:<br><br> New anime <br> OVA <br> New chapter. <br><br>Remember all the lolis are lovely and deserve cuddling and tender loving.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are some characters from Fate/Hollow ataraxia but that doesn't matter that much.</br>  <br>VN is all you need to get most of it.

I imagine if she wasn't healing at all she would still look like this.</br>  WATASHI TACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU<br><br>I like the OP song, and the lyric double meaning.</br></br>  <br>CR just announced it a few hours ago so I would think that HS just doesn't have it on the ripping shedule yet.</br>  <br>Well, it just got announced by CR.<br><br>Someone either has to poke Jaka or they haven't added it the queue.</br></br></br>  Guys just do this:<br/>  <br>Both miki and taroumaru make a early appearance in this episode?</br>  <br> WATASHI TACHI WA KOKO NI IMASU </br>  reminder  <br>Well another option would be  DDY </br>  <br>Bad translations &gt; Memes<br><br>Fact.</br></br></br>  Watching the first episode made me pick up the manga where I left off and holy shit the graduation ceremony.   Key visual update <br><br>lerche pls</br></br>   mfw I had completely forgotten who Toromaru was <br>I can't handle this ride again ;_;</br>  <br>Fucking based</br>  <br> you will never be Yuki and nibble on Kurumi's thighs. </br>  Wait, why the hell is Miki already part of the group?

They better still cover her life at the mall and rescue, though.</br>  <br>Who the fuck is toromaru, the dog?</br>  <br>He's working on this.</br>  <br>The manga author is writing the anime too.</br>  <br>The joke is that, spic subs are SO BAD, they'd translate it as "el tiempo ha llegado" even though it sounds like shit, just because the original ENGLISH subs (no JP here!) said "time".</br>  CR 1080p rips are apparently better than their 720p according to Daiz and a few anons who seem to know what they're talking about. <br><br><br>That's brilliant<br><br><br>Isn't the mangaka doing series composition?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You know the discover tab is personalised for you, right?</br>  <br> Traduccion de Crunchyroll <br> <br> Traduccion de Commie </br></br></br>  <br>I have it set to the actual worldwide trends. If it was personalized for me, I doubt I'd constantly be seeing One Direction/Indian Politics on it.</br>  <br>Her best friend appears in the opening.<br>It will be covered as small flashback around the episode or as a sole flashback episode.</br></br>  <br> Unpopular opinion coming through. I don't mind 1080. Downloading a downscale from an upscale that will just be upscaled to my 1080 monitor again sounds unnecessarily convulted. It's still shit cr stream quality anyway and I do have the space for it too. <br><br><br>Maybe we'll get flashbacks, I hope so at least. That or Norimitsu comes up with a good equivalent or workaround. I want to believe in him.</br></br></br></br>     I know I'm a little late but I have the stream link, worked for me 2 days ago but now it keeps redirecting to google non stop. I even tried the index page to see if the url changed, it didn't and the watch count was 50+ at the time so there are people in there. What gives?    <br>Shovel will be the savior of humanity.</br>  <br>My guess (hope) is that they get separated somehow so they can still "hear" and go rescue her alright.<br><br>It still completely fucks over her character arc on how she "warms up" to the others though.</br></br></br>  Haruhi ist tott.<br><br>In this thread, we worship the new Goddess.</br></br>  <br> tott <br> tt </br></br>  <br>It's hard to talk with chopsticks in your mouth.</br>  <br> start thread about worst girl of season <br> expect it not to be arcived in an hour <br><br>why did you do this to yourself OP? <br><br>the only way this thread doesn't get archived is if newfags take your bait and don't SAGE the shit out of this thread when they post in it.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Just look at those thighs.  <br> tott <br><br>Literally what?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Why is the MC so best?<br><br>He uses his power for his own gain, hidden his smug asshole behind it, also being arrogant because of it. Don't forget he got good looks, and I bet the whole world that the white girl will falls for me.<br><br>I reminds you he's not gary stu since he's an asshole inside, and cannot be self inserted based on /a/ said, since he's not a beta faggot.<br>And the best of all, he really act like me, even the looks, that alone makes this MC 10/10, and carries the show being AOTYAY.<br><br>Also people who hate her is justified because if you got power, YOU HAVE TO ABUSE IT. Fuck morals, being edgy and angsty teenager is what life is all about. I mean being responsible, and only use the power for emergency, or for good? Heh, I'm not that childish.<br><br>That's what /a/ said though, I just expanding what /a/ means. If you need the source and quote, I'll post the link for you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God damn them crystal blue eyes make my dick hard.  <br> implying you have a dick </br>  <br>petticoats are thigh-appeal booster</br>  What is her trauma?  <br>Is it me, or was there a pantyshot of Yu's ex girlfriend? There was that one scene where she fell to the ground and there was a shot up her skirt, though it was hard to see if it was her butt or her panties.</br>  <br>I think its her leg</br>  Why can't evil ever win? <br><br>Just once? <br><br>Please?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would you want that? You really want it to be "different" that much? Come on man, you're not a kid anymore.<br><br>You can't just make it "lel let's makes it evil all the way, because why the fuck not? lol", if you want to make chinese cartoon for your own, sure go ahead. But not with this chinese cartoon that actually got target audience and trying to make it sells, they makes this not for self pleasure, but for money.<br><br>Therefore the answer is no, fuck you.</br></br></br></br></br>  Glasses sure got /fit/ after dying.  <br><br>People love stories where the protagonist is a successful villain, you condescending little shit. <br><br>It was the entire appeal of Death Note, until the ending which tons of people are still buttmad over. <br><br>It would probably have garnered much more attention for going in that direction, then what it will inevitably become.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What thighs? There is no thighs.</br>  It's pretty much guaranteed that MC will change into a beta bitch boy, but I wonder if their abilities are going to disappear at the end of the story.  <br>Does this look like a beta bitch boy to you?</br>  <br>But that's the monster that challenges fate, not the boy.</br>  <br>What's he going to do at endgame, control someone for 5 seconds without losing consciousness?</br>  <br>That looks fucking insane.<br><br>I can't believe that's the same show</br></br></br>  <br>Are we Deadman Wonderland now?</br>  <br> control someone for 5 seconds without losing consciousness? <br>Control someone for 7 seconds while getting drowsy.</br></br>  <br>He's a guy who could only get good grades through cheating, panicked and fled as soon as his shenanigans were revealed and got dumped by the girl he'd been gunning for as soon as continuing a relationship with him would've required any effort. He wasn't exactly an impressive alpha badass in the first episode.</br>  <br>It's how Germans say dead if they're retarded.</br>  tokyo esp was good for 1 episode.<br><br>they blew the whole load already. this show is going to suck balls</br></br>  <br>Go away blogfag, u're cancer of /a/</br>  <br> my dick </br>  So has there been any news on that singer making her VA debut? Or was that debunked?<br><br><br>I don't know, the angle doesn't look like it.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he got objective, retard. They execute how he grows to have his own perspective and corrupt by it. And how he struggle between the police's side and all, that's the fucking appeal.<br><br>You think just because he's a villain and evil, people like it? Get out underage.</br></br></br>  <br> implying I'm blogging <br><br>I'm just spreading the news how this MC is a definite character of cannot be self inserted at, and not pandering at the same time. See,<br><br>He's very different and clearly not the same as those light novel adaptation where the MC got a good looks, a calculating mind, and wicked sense of humor.<br><br>definitely original, and not pandering, and cannot be self inserted, since he's not a beta faggot (based on /a/ said).<br>Pretty refreshing, if you likes all those NON-shitty LN adaptation, or NON-forced drama triangle love romcom, which is the best genre in chinese cartoon.<br><br>And this is the best MC because the personality and wicked sense of humor, and nihilistic really do like me, and the viewers. Definitely not pandering though, they just know what the viewers want.<br><br>Don't you see how /a/ loves this MC? Definitely not because summer though.<br><br> Faggot, you missed the point. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If you want that, watch the news.</br>  <br>Damn...</br>  <br> MAL: the character </br>  <br>She has shit taste in anime?</br>  <br>Shhhhh, he's trying to fit in. Don't you see how he tried so hard using a buzzword to blend in?</br>  When will MC's hair turn white?  <br> Clannad is one of the greatest shows of all time, and if you disagree, you're just trying to fit in <br>Why don't you just go back?</br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>I'm the guy you replied to, and here's your reply.</br>  Prepare for Cow and Horse Doujin.<br><br>Also best ending song this year:<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=amX<wbr>iceqtTto</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>When?</br>  That fucking ending has been stuck in my head all day.  <br> Is it NTR?  Tell me it's NTR.  </br>  <br>I would definitely like that</br>    Has there even been a Doujin based on this manga?    <br><br>Out.</br></br>  <br>Best Team</br>    <br>That ogre girl</br>    <br>dat zombie tits</br>  <br>Are all of these girls hust Top Tier?</br>  <br>Read the manga faggot.<br><br>Oni girl is top tier the rest is meh alright.</br></br></br>  <br> doppel wearing clothes </br>  <br> best ending song this year <br>Naw nigga that goes to Kekkai Sensen.<br>I like MonMusu to but come on.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=3ex<wbr>sRhw3xt8</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  Zombina best  <br>That shit song</br>  <br>That would be fantastic, it takes part early in the manga before sexual interaction law is lifted.

She had some random guy milk her, when she could have easily had sheep or horse do it. Think of how her boyfriend must feel.</br>  <br>I love tall fit girls, anon.<br>I saved all I could that day.</br></br>  <br> one eye <br> two eyebrows </br></br>  <br>I go with the MGQ canon: If girls, they are born as monster girls. If boys, they are born as humans.</br>  <br>more like...MONOko! HAHAHA!</br>  <br>Who wouldn't bang Cathyl I say.</br>  <br>Guns pretty much eliminated most of the advantages that extra-species people have over us. If you meant pre-gun powder, we still do have some advantages. Orcs are morons. Mermaids go in the water, not land. Anti-calvarly tactics probably work fine against centaurs. Orcs are morons. snake and spider can't stand cold temperatures.</br>  <br>its against the law<br><br>forbidden love</br></br></br>  <br>It's more interesting to scream "HORSE PUSSY".

I'm into her for the epic  hand-holding .</br>  <br> Cathy <br> Cah-thill <br> Cattle <br> She is a cow <br><br>Holy shit why did it take me so long to get that</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All Crab's names are a joke of their species.<br>Just sayin.</br></br>  <br>It's just one couple out of potentially millions. If they really were dominant, they wouldn't have been so little of them in modern times.<br><br><br>Just cause you have an eye that can see 2km doesn't mean you bullets will fly straight to that point, unless she has terrific on the fly trig skills, she'll still need a scope to calculate the parabolic arc. Or a laser rifle.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I sorta like the idea of monster-boys depending on species. I wouldn't mind being bros with a centaur, or Kobold.</br>  <br>Jelly would be a bit glooey but she sure as hell wouldn't smell like shit<br><br>True for horse pussy and papi. They'd smell like beasts.<br><br>Rach wouldn't smell particularly bad but she'd still be the most repulsive.<br><br>I wouldn't mind Miia. Wouldn't want to be around when she copulates though. Just look it up on the internet, it's disgusting</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So what if she's a cow? I mean LOOK AT HER.</br>  <br> for you </br>  <br>I own a stable. Horses don't smell bad if you watch them. They actually have a nice smell when they are clean.</br>  <br>I like them tall and fit too, but I think it's the literal cow-tits(lacrosse intolerance and all) and Chyna-like attitude that puts me off. Sticking with Cerea for now.</br>  <br>Wash them, damn auto-correct.</br>  <br>CANNOT UNSEE</br>    <br>She might have one giant eyebrow but just shave the middle for her self conscious reasons.</br>  <br><br>Unibrows aren't cute.</br></br>  <br>Its true.</br>  <br>Usually people who are into horses tend to not mind or even like their natural smell. It's pretty much an acquired taste (smell).<br>You'd have to be around your waifu for a long time before you get used to her smell.</br></br>  <br> Neither are mono-eyes :^) </br>  <br>Exactly.</br>  <br> cathy and the moms won't be animated <br>fuck everything</br></br>  <br>This <br>Animals smell bad because they aren't bathing daily, nor are they covered in deodorants or perfumes.<br><br>Monster girls on the other hand have hygiene standards similar to humans, so they probably smell no different.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Season 2 </br>  <br>I grew up around them, So maybe it's just a nostalgia thing, but I love giving my horses a hug and just smelling their fur.</br>  <br>No animal smells as badly as a human who has not bathed though. Jesus Christ.</br>  <br>I dunno man, I had a horse ride when I was about age nine or twelve(overseas trips blur together over time), and seeing plus hearing the horse ahead of me fart turned me off them for a bit. Yet here I am, a quarter century later, on a Chinese cartoon image board, a Cerea fag. Probably a mare in oestrus may smell more attractive(pheromones and all that) to a straight guy than a horny stallion might.</br>  FIFTY POUNDS<br><br>EVERY DAY</br></br>  <br>Well, Y'know, farts don't typically smell good unless your into that kind of shit, so not entirely fair.</br>  <br>Na, natural smell is a thing<br>Ever came accross someone who owns a ferret? They naturally smell like utter shit and you can't do shit about it. Their owners grow used to it and they don't mind after a while.<br><br><br>Yeah, I get where you're coming from. I LOVE my dogs smell because I've always been around dogs, yet everyone tell me she smells like shit. I bet my ass it's an acquired taste.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would make an /mlp/ joke here, but that's honestly kind of adorable.</br>  Anyone hungry?  <br>Keep them, simple as that. It counts as advertisement product, it costs a lot of money to make and then to rent a place to put it, at best you can re sell it to someone at some point.</br>    <br>I just realized the arachne in that doesn't have pedipalps</br>  <br>I like everyhting about miia except her panties<br>Who thought this was a good idea</br></br>  <br>well go ahead and design some panties for her</br>  <br>She doesn't need panties, she doesn't even wear bras most of the time</br>  <br>I wonder if I'm allowed to post that milking scene from the manga. I really want to, it's literally the best part of the manga.</br>  <br>Bull shit. I see shirts on dogs all the time.</br>  <br>try wearing pants with no underwear</br>  <br> allowed to <br>Why the hell wouldn't you be?</br></br>  <br>True, but I guess these were semi-rural horses, used only for giving gullible tourists' kids rides for money. I remember being somewhat scared when mounting up, being only about 1.2-1.3m tall at that point of my life. Probably I could go up to a horse these days, stroke and sniff their nape(if they allowed, that is), maybe even saddle up and override the worse parts of that memory.<br><br> Literal shitposting. <br>Here's your reply: BEST GARDEN ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I don't know about best part, but easily the most fappable.</br>  <br>I do it all the time</br>  <br>Like are there rules against that?</br>  <br>i think its a quite funny running joke</br>  If she's a snake, just put a giant sock with the toes cut off around it.<br><br>Not really fap material though. Panties are for fap material so it has to be panties.</br></br>  <br>Was there a doujin announcement or something?

It would be even more glorious than the dog twist.</br></br>        ps ink for the stream  How was your life 9 years ago?<br>How is your life now?<br><br> also post Misaki </br></br></br>  <br> How was your life 9 years ago? <br>It was alright back then about to start high school.<br><br> How is your life now? <br>23 year old 4 year NEET approaching 5th<br><br>Now it's been difficult. I've been trying to change my life for the better these past 7 months.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was started by a shitposter, that's the only reason.</br>  <br>d-don't bully me ;_;</br>  <br>i'm fine with that part. i'm actually enjoy talking to people i just rarely get opportunities for honest communication with other people cause hikki.</br>  <br> Fire <br> 95 <br>W-What's 100?</br></br></br>  Favorite character and why?  <br> Sapphire elook sexy <br>Good taste.<br>I want to run my hands slowly down from her chest though her waist, onto her nice hips, then kiss her on the cheeks.</br></br></br>  <br>Kumiko because she is the only decent character of hibikek.</br>  remember when Haruhi's festival was the best animated music you have ever seen? well, now that looks like shit after watching last ep.  <br>Good.</br>  <br>Kumiko is the worst of the five main girls. Her only redeeming factors is that its cute when she bullies Shoe and that she has the most screen time.</br>  Thoughts on Dandelion so far? It has fairly unique concept but its execution is absurd as fuck. The characters are pretty decent and cute especially Kanade and Hikari. Above average show.  FUCKING FUNISHIT 4 DAYS LATECAST<br>CAN'T IT BE PICKED UP BY SOME COMPETENT GROUP AND RELEASED BEFORE MONDAY?</br>  <br>Crap. Dropped. Not even KanaHana can redeem it,</br>  <br><br>shitty show but my ears want to hear hanakana</br></br>  <br>Hopefully no one subs to Funi and it just dies trying to pick up this many shows. <br><br>Then again groups might just kill themselves over drama rip Kaylith</br></br></br>  <br> rip Kaylith <br>If I'm not mistaken, GJM/GoodJobMedia is basically Kaylith with a few different members. Overall release quality and speed seems to be more on par with what we got from Kaylith. A shame caffeine couldn't keep up with most of the shows they've picked up the past couple seasons and that Kaylith died in the first place, but at least GJM seems to basically be the same group.</br></br>  What do you think will be AOTY 2015?  <br>It was officially announced already, silly. The hell were you?</br>  Your shit taste is showing, OP. <br><br>Having said that, AOTY is a personal thing. For me Yahari because I'm invested as fuck in that franchise.</br></br>  Absolute duo<br><br>Now fuck off op</br></br>  <br>Non Non Biyori</br>  <br> me so edgy <br> nobody understands me <br> but i have so many beautiful girls around me <br> i still has to be batman, dark knight because edge <br>defend this</br></br></br></br></br></blockquote>]
