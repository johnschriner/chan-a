I'm on diet.  <br> ~12 hrs <br><br>Do people ask this stupid &amp; redundant question every single fucking week?</br></br></br>  New tapestry.  <br>Yes. I've only been here 2 weeks and you guys were making the same complains then, at some point you are just going to have to come to terms with the fact that this delicious Tosh art is like flowers to bees for new posters to these threads.</br>  <br>Did you come from reddit or tumblr? Or do you happen to be a crossboarder? Curious.</br>  <br>Well said.</br>  <br>Megumi looks really cute there.</br>  Would you pull loli Erina's hair mandibles?  <br>Megumi always looks cute</br>  <br>More like a constant lurker on /a/ but an infrequent poster. It's kind of weird to think of myself as a crossboarder when I do the same thing on the other boards as well, and in no greater frequency.</br>  <br> Arisu <br><br>If we didn't already get official spellings I bet there would be a little confusion about Erina possibly being "Eleanor", like in Honey Blonde.<br><br>Speaking of which, I'm glad Tosh doesn't write his own manga</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how you pronounce her name in katakana (アリス).<br><br>Tosh did write &amp; draw a one-shot before:<br><br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Kimi-to-<wbr>Watashi-no-Renai-Soudan/Ch-000---On<wbr>eshot-?id=192668</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Which other boards do you frequent? /v/? /b/? /r9k/?</br>  As someone used to worshipping Murata Yusuke's art, this series has me thoroughly confused. Alice does funny things to my dick, which is a shame considering that her anime design and voice are awful.

I think it'll take time to get used to her, just like how people didn't like Erina' VA initially, but majority of them have switched sides now.</br></br>  <br><br>Boy, you're in for a ride.<br><br>I wasn't going to remove mine, but they were pushing the others so I had to.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Gross man, don't even mention them. I have a variety of interests, but none of those boards are even about anything.<br><br>I'm mostly into /a/, /an/, /tg/, and /diy/, but I dabble in /co/, /mu/, /sp/, /ck/, /fa/, /fit/, /int/, /lit/, /o/, and /sci/. I've learned to be selective about which threads I post in on those, because all those boards are susceptible tofrequent low quality threads or bait for shitposters. I also have a few other boards where I only come for just one thread, like the VN threads on /vg/ for example.</br></br></br>  <br><br>How old are you guys? Is there a threshold of some kind? I'm 26 now, mine finished growing in before I was 20 and I have never had any problems with them. I guess I have a large mouth for them to all fit, but what are the odds that someday soon they just start having problems for no unforeseen or preventable reason? I don't have insurance now, nor will I soon.</br></br>  <br>I want to eat with her, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>You can endure it, I know you can.<br><br>Speaking from a guy who had all 4 removed at once.<br><br><br>Tip: Request for those teeth to be preserved in case you need to replace a molar later in life.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Too late, I've already married him. </br>  <br>I've already got a couple or preserved incisors.<br><br><br>23. I'm getting mine removed because I don't have a large enough mouth. They've pushed my bottom row of teeth really close together, which isn't uncomfortable mind you but it's also not particularly good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm 28 and haven't experienced it yet. Is that abnormal?</br>  Purpletitsliterallywho-chan is best girl.  <br>Pussy, he wanna eat that pussy.</br>  <br>Why not? I'd love to see Souma doing it do her, later on.<br><br>+1</br></br></br>  <br>Do you mean Chinese dress girl?</br>  <br>I've never seen a girl with purple tits. Maybe a purple girl with tits, but not just purple tits, not even purple nipples.</br>  <br><br>Houjou. Her name is Houjou.</br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>No, feed my your breast milk, Alice.</br>  <br>I forgot what you call those dresses, but they look better to me on slim genki girls with long legs than it does on her. Seeing it here makes me think of chun-li and her herculean thighs, which is not a good thing.</br>  <br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheon<wbr>gsam</wbr></br>  <br>It's a cheongsam.<br> Seeing it here makes me think of chun-li and her herculean thighs, which is not a good thing. <br>You're a bigger faggot than the Takumifags.</br></br></br>  <br>right, that.</br>  <br>Strong thighs are okay man, don't get me wrong. In fact, Houjou's thighs look fantastic there. It's just that the visual association to chun-li is unshakable here, and HER thighs are so huge and hard they probably could deflect bullets. That's just grotesque. A good thing can become a bad thing if it's taken too far, like breasts so big that they're heavier than the rest of the body, and a deadly weapon of sheer weight.</br>  <br>are you out of the loop man? being a faggot is in now. gotta hurry up and kiss some dudes before the mob lynches you for being intolerant.</br>  <br>They should have saved that for the prelims.</br>  <br>what's the point in wearing it if you don't have nice thighs?</br>  What's up with her? Is she an albino?  <br> but they look better to me on slim genki girls with long legs than it does on her <br>Houjou's a relatively tall lady, lest we forget. A cheongsam will look terrible on a stick-thin lady, as opposed to someone of Houjou's almost perfect figure, whereby said clothing would accentuate her womanly curves.</br></br>  <br>half Scandinavian</br>  When does the /u/ really start?  <br>Other than a cameo for cameo's sake, this might be just some minor setup for when Houjou confronts Megumi, because it's showing that she was actually around to hear the rumors that she had a shokugeki with an alumnus. I know we're all used to it, but it's kind of weird sometimes how new characters show up and reference common knowledge from past events despite never being seen or shown before. Sometimes it makes me think that they're some sort of alien or esper that snuck their way into the cast by modifying people's memories of events to hide that they weren't actually there.</br>  <br>Can we not start this, thanks.</br>  <br>This nigga gets it.<br><br>She's mixed (Japanese/Danish).</br></br></br>  <br>We've seen cameos of almost every named first year except for Giganigga. I wonder if he'll appear before the first season is up.</br>  <br>We will. The anime will cover the elections, most likely till the end of the prelims.</br>  <br>Come to think of it, you're right, but I just meant the dress. We can tell who she is without it.</br>  <br>You don't need large thighs, just nice legs in general. For example, Kagura from Gintama.<br><br><br> stick-thin <br>That's not the same thing as what I was saying at all.

I think it's more to do with the lingering taste and smell that turn a lot of people off the fruit.</br></br>  <br>When I was a kid, my school used to have a gigantic jackfruit tree in the middle of the grounds. The fucking child-sized jackfruits would fall and burst on the ground and nobody would bother to clean it up, which resulted in millions of flies around the place constantly and a terrible rotting fruit smell for a good 100m around it.

I don't think semen demon means you're born with that knowledge anon</br>  <br>she probably was able to distinct the different semen flavours when she was six</br>  <br><br> implying that the author would let Souma lose in the first round </br></br>  <br>Alice is properly skilled, she didn't need to use her machines during the boot camp and she still managed to do her stuff effectively.</br>  <br>NO <br><br>Its cheap and taste good <br><br>Plus I only eat it on days I don't feel like cooking</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>we will get another nakiri genes in 2nd year right?</br>  <br><br>I think it's more what he could be. From what little we've actually seen about him he's fucking great, plus that whole cooking trio that was hinted at the end of the elections.</br></br>  <br>I agree that they're probably stronger than they seem, but I'd be extremely surprised if they last the whole second year, let alone the third. The supporting cast is just too strong in this series. Besides, they probably only really work well together, and not so much inidividually. If it was a tag-team tournament with tons of surprises and the best way to overcome the challenges was to have strong teamwork, they'd probably finish top 10 or better.</br>  <br> implying he could have when he was up against someone who relies too hard on a crutch </br>  <br> he's fucking great </br>  <br><br><br>It smells like pancake batter so she'll think it's some salty kind of batter that was added.</br></br></br>  <br> transfer student arrives for 2nd year <br> it's a brash, outspoken, tomboyish girl akin to Souma's personality but more aggressive <br> turns out she's Alice's cousin from the danish side of her family <br>yes, please</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just like the Bryan bros in tennis. If Roger &amp; Rafa were to team up in a doubles match against them, they'd probably lose.</br>  <br> mfw I googled ortolan <br>hahaha what the fuck</br></br>  <br>That's not true though. During her match with Souma Souma remarked on how skilled she was chopping up ingredients and she replied that it was just the basics.</br>  <br> Where the hell did you buy this batter? Something's off... </br>  <br><br>Yes, and the only reason Giganigga's gimmick works is because of how superior he is when it comes to cooking basics. He works by copying everyone's shit and then doing it better than them. He's incredibly skilled, but lacks the creativity to build a dish on his own.<br><br>I will stand by Alice as best girl, but I think she's overrated in the Autumn Election. The only reason her score was so stupidly high was because her Molecular gastronomy stuff was alien to the food critics, making them out of their depth.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All of the PSD crew will graduate. They have Isshiki to support them for two years.</br>  <br>I just googled it, holy shit.<br>No but Hishoko killed a turtle to make a hamburger in the Autumn Elections.</br></br>  <br>Way too cruel to be putting in a shounen manga</br>  It's weird. I like all the characters, the events and the antics. All the non-gag dishes have looked fucking delicious. But it's just weird that cooking is put on such a pedestal. I mean one guy's dream is getting a 3-star Michelin review but a lot of 3-star restaurants are just esoteric and expensive. A 3-star rating is literally just being advertised at the top of the page in a tire company's travel pamphlet. This manga is completely at odds with how the restaurants I know actually function. Perfectly competent cooks that can handle everything you might ask of them are everywhere, it's just a matter of finding ones that are sane enough to functionally fill a kitchen. Labor can be delegated for tasks that really need specialized expertise. Peoples' palates are more influenced by aesthetics, service staff and how much booze they've downed; food critics and chefs are among the people most susceptible to bullshit. Being a great chef is more about being a great businessman than a cook, and being a great sous chef is more about being a great cat wrangler. Just look at how the Judgment of Paris shocked everyone several decades ago -- blind tests that rigorously eliminate bullshit tend to ruffle a lot of plumage.  <br><br><br>Can you survive alpha-mode Kurokiba, though?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Even if it was a crutch, the premise was pretty ass. <br><br> haha science r the best <br> I was just pretending to make a simple bento <br> your bento was good Alice but it wasn't a bento <br> flashback <br> oh no I came </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I can't even survive normal mode Kurokiba.</br>  <br>no matter how hard you try, you can't shine shit.</br>  <br>She didn't make a bento, just sushi in a bento box.<br>She failed pretty hard as her dish didn't fulfill a single condition to be considered a bento.</br></br>  <br><br>Which is a pretty convenient way for the author to let Souma beat the most hyped up character after Erina.</br></br>  <br>I would've been okay with it if it was just that, but didn't Alice (or was it Erina? either way, still Alice's fault) criticize Souma when it started, saying that bento are a refined dish that has developed it's own cultural standing in the upper echelons of the food world? So, yeah, she went full retard after being in a position where she should have known that better than anyone. It's like an "I was only pretending NOT to be retarded" moment.</br>  <br>What's convenient about it? It wasa perfectly valid result. She got cocky and relied too much on her tech. She's still incredibly smart and skilled. She was just too gung-ho to remember there's more to a bento than the shit you put in it. An easy mistake to make, especially when you focus on cooking science so much</br>  <br>That was erina criticism.<br>Alice literally didn't know how bento are suppose to be made.</br></br>  <br>The gastronomy shit is just a cooking style. Just like the italians shit and just like brown boobs meat stuff.</br>  You're Tsukuda and a WSJ editor barges in your office and puts a gun to Tosh's head and says you have 30 minutes to think up a proposal to save Takumi or else he'll shoot Tosh.<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br><br>Because the only way that he could beat the lauded super-genius chef was by her being retarded. It's possible, but the whole thing about arrogance losing is far too cliché.</br></br>  <br>so one knows how bento is formed, and the other knows how babby is formed. one guess for which will beat the other in the race for the soumab owl</br>  <br>I think they're much more competent than shit.</br>  <br> but he is weak shit <br>*Was weak shit.<br>Everyone's definitely getting a power boost after the stagiare. I can see Isami becoming a bigger threat with all the pages he's gotten planning to upstage Takumi</br></br></br>  <br>kill takumi off instead. 2 ez</br>  <br> Way too cruel <br>Are we going through this shit again? Turtles are used as food a lot of times. This nothing different from slaughtering a chicken, pig, or cattle.</br></br>  <br>Make the Alice-Hayama-Ryou trio lose against Takumi-Isami because they can't work together.</br>  <br><br>Force him to study under the autismo.</br></br>  <br>Erina wins the souma bowl. Everything other girl is a stepping stone.</br>  <br>in the eyes of tootsuki, there's only future graduates and shit. that's why they expel anyone that no longer has the probability of graduating, they only focus on people with an actual chance. the buttbros will barely make it past the bubble to get to the second year, there's no way they graduate.</br>  <br>Tell him to get good.</br>  <br>I wasn't talking about turtles, genius. I was talking about the ortolan. Which is on a completely other level. <br>Fois Gras is fucked up enough as it is.</br></br>  <br> For centuries, a rite of passage for French gourmets was the eating of the Ortolan. These tiny birds—captured alive, force-fed, then drowned in Armagnac—were roasted whole and eaten that way, bones and all, while the diner draped his head with a linen napkin to preserve the precious aromas and, some believe, to hide from God. <br>We're not talking about turtles.</br></br>  <br><br><br> gastronomy <br> makes you think of burps and farts, and subsequently, shit <br><br>I swear, they came up with the least appetizing name for "the science of cooking" that they possibly could.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  ost when  <br> Capture the bird in the wild, blind it using a pair of pincers, stick it in a tight cage so it can't move, keep it on a diet of millet, grapes and figs until it reaches two to four times its normal size, and then drown it in a snifter of Armagnac. <br>It's not about turtles.</br></br>  <br>Just gavage.</br>  <br>Way too fucking expensive for most characters. Also might be kind of gross to most people, considering they're traditionally eaten whole.</br>  <br>July 28th.</br>  <br>thanks</br>  sometimes I feel like the kind of things that get turned into delicacies is just so people have an excuse to be edgy and hipster-ish, and also so they are allowed to lash out at foreigners who criticize it. like that cheese you guys were talking about before that has the jumping maggots, it sounds like the crazy bullshit kind of food people would eat just for the sake of being crazy bullshit.  <br>He has already rejected the autismo though.</br>  <br>Isn't that cheese illegal or something?</br>  <br>Thanks for the clarification anon, was really confused there.<br><br><br>I don't know anon, but here where I live that's not really uncommon, except for the big breasts.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "I was only merely pretending to be this weak!" <br> "You getting the mezzaluna was all of my keikaku doori!" </br></br>  <br>cliques and peer pressure don't end at high school my friend.</br>  <br>It's still a very alien and new style.<br>You can do some incredibly weird stuff with it, like make powders out of things you couldn't have done before, make stuff have abnormal textures, and create unorthodox flavour combinations</br></br>  <br><br>That's why I said force. Unless he studies under another master chef.</br></br>  <br>That's why he will never beat souma.<br>You have to learn from the best to be the best and that's exactly what souma did.</br></br>  <br> Just force-feeding ducks while they puke themselves to death </br>  <br>I thought any processed food like cheese and and the like were similar.</br>  <br>Yes, it's terrible, but the one where they just kill it normally is nice and the taste is good.</br>  <br> she takes takumi in during the summer to teach him the "real" italian cooking techniques in addition to refining his pleb-tier diner techniques <br> constant 1-on-1 sessions of sweating and foodgasms <br> they end up just having sexy time all day instead, without working on cooking techniques <br> yet another rival for souma who discovered the power of love and got better </br></br></br></br>  <br>Donato also specialises in Italian, maybe it'll be him.</br>  <br>I mean yeah, daily sex worked well for kurokiba as he managed to go even with and arguably trump souma, but in the end they both lost against pure mother-son love.</br>  Would you ride around town on your scooter with Tadokoro-chan?  <br>She asked them to work for her not to study under. Why do you think they rejected her?</br>  <br>Imagine how strong hayama will become once he actually consummates his love, he might actually be able to rival erina that way, god's senses or no.</br>  <br> Being some hippie that thinks non human animals have rights </br>  <br> non human animals <br> implying humans are animals <br>hudurrdurrrrrrrr</br></br></br>  <br> Being subhuman </br>  <br>Just imagine how much pussy 1st seats had to have before they got their positions. Yeah, all of them.</br>  <br>No wait, an auberge is French,</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=dxQ<wbr>mOR_QLfQ</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The squid is dead.<br><br>If you want real fucked up cruelty, look up that chink food where they eat frog guts while it's still alive<br><br> or what happens to male chicks in the egg industry </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> file name <br><br>Everytime</br></br></br>  <br>Well, male chicks are afaik killed rather quickly, even if voilently.

And what?<br>I seldomly do, mainly when I have access to a lot of spices (in other words, when i'm at my parents place). My main fetish is anything marinated in soy sauce and garlic, lots of garlic. For some reason those two fit each other very well.</br>  <br>Dude</br>  <br><br><br>I think 4chan knows people dont' want to see it.<br><br>Been getting corrupted errors for any webm I try to upload.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah it was Erina lecturing Souma about bento before the match. It's why I'm sure she was facepalming at Alice during it.</br>  <br>I saw a similiar video where goose chicks where sorted out on a bandwagon and thrown into a mixer for quick disposal.</br>  <br>I usually make myself some /fit/ meals since I'm on a diet right now.<br><br>But other than that, lots of asian home cooking. Right now I'm making myself a bowl of chilled red bean soup.<br><br> Yes, I'm a chink. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> pure <br><br>On Jun's side of it, sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Ah, a citizen of the People's Glorious Republic of Chinkery I see</br>  <br>That was fucking entertaining</br>  <br> that design <br><br>Picked up, is she in the anime or is she new to the manga?</br></br></br>  <br>She dies early, she is the MCs childhood friend and was going to win.</br>  <br>Why would they kill them that young? Aren't they trying to produce more chicken for consumption?</br>  <br>She was just recently introduced in the anime.</br>  <br>She appears in chapter 28. Yes, she's in the anime.</br>  <br>Bullshit.</br>  <br><br>Thank you.</br></br>    <br>When it comes to traditional national cooking, i like soups (rosół or żurek), when making other dishes i prefer to go with simplified "asian" recepies (put soy sauce. ginger and coraindre in everything and wait for results)</br>  <br>Horrible cook here. I stick to simple things like eggs and sandwiches. I'm thinking of stepping up my game and cooking lots of meat.</br>  anyone who has actually studied cooking here, and not just the stuff you can do in the kitchen? I've always wondered about how the industry tries to combat ingredients from being too formulaic. Like, with all the mass production of every crop and animal, I'd imagine that either the goal or the side effect is that every one comes out almost exactly the same. There's basically no specialization left, and any deviations from the norm are brutally excised out of the gene pool. That may be great from a product consistency standpoint, but doesn't that have disastrous consequences in the long run? For one, if some new disease comes out that your product is susceptible too, the entire supply becomes vulnerable, instead of just one variety. For another, a lack of mutations leads to the stockpiling of certain dominant and recessive genes, which could lead to inferior products in the long run or also destroy the possibility of improvement. I'm sure that I'm not the only one to realize this issue since I'm not even part of that world, I'm just curious how the problem is dealt with.  <br>Is there no Alice? What the actual fuck?</br>  <br>Give her time, Anon.</br>  <br>Meat&gt;Alice</br>  <br><br>Been cooking for ten years. Not as a profession though more like a hobby.<br><br>It's pretty fun.</br></br></br></br>  I drop it here,is worth still riding?  <br>Meat is great, Anon, no doubt, but better than Alice? You trippin'.</br>  <br><br>There are different breeds for egg laying and consumption.</br></br>  <br>Nigga what are you doing?</br>  <br>Yes, do it for the Elite Ten.</br>  <br> missing Hishoko stagiare <br> missing Shinomiya stagiare <br> missing elite 10 <br> missing festival <br>You are missing all the good stuff.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They seem to think so.</br>  <br>Man that's still a huge waste.</br>  <br>You did the right thing. But it got good again.</br>  <br>E10 look so fucking stupid. Can't even bring myself to get hype about those faggots.<br><br>They're also Japs, and almost always have shit taste in literally everything.</br></br></br>  <br> Not accepting Currynigger's victory in the Autumn Election <br>Get over it anon</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Okay but i hope that fucker end in fuking 1 in elite.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think that's why there is genetically modified food.</br>  If you were in charge of re-writing the election arc with all of the results and other plot points exactly the same, how would you have presented it differently to make it easier to swallow? For example, having the "hayama loves jun" flashback revelation come earlier, or in a series throughout the arc, so that it doesn't bludgeon you all at once in the finale. I'd also like to handle Hishoko's mental breakdown better too, she came off like a whiny selfish bitch and got better afterwards.  <br>funny thing about that picture<br><br>megumi is riding along side him with a bike<br><br>I guess souma just thinks a scooter is cooler</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She meets Truck-san in chapter 69, they have a short but really close relationship, until he tramples her feelings flat.</br>  <br>I'd hav Hisako have a proper chapter about her relationship with Erina and why she is how she is.</br>  <br>Novel translations  soon. </br>  <br>you better not be pulling my leg anon</br>  <br><br>I just realised why I like Rindou's design so much.<br><br>It is that damn sweater.</br></br></br></br>  <br>See:<br><br>Let's wait.</br></br></br>  <br>Still mad she's not the top dog, she looks so smug here </br>  <br> woman <br> top anything <br>In what fantasy world do you live?</br></br></br>  <br>There's already some woman who manage to reach 1st seat you fagit, also here  looks like she's the one leading the crowd, and of course her smug.</br>  <br>I want a side chapter featuring Souma getting his license.</br>  <br>Why does first seat wear his tie over his shoulder? Why not stick it in his breast pocket like a reasonable person?</br>  <br>Autism, even when the wind or something puts it in place, he puts it back.</br>  <br>Autism</br>  <br>Autism.</br>  To be honest Alice and her dogs is the spotlight for me now, I hope we get enough of them  ;_;   <br>Autism</br>  <br>You'll see them fail spectacularly.<br>The focus of the arc is Souma vs Yugi and whatever he's doing with Tsukasa.</br></br>  <br>oh shit what if tsukasa is yugi's backup if something goes wrong? I wouldn't put it past him.</br>  <br>So the tie doesn't get in the way of his cooking.</br>  <br>Me too. They're my favorite characters.</br>  <br>I doubt someone as proud as yugi would make 1st seat his back up plan against a fucking first year.<br>Tsukasa probably wouldn't accept either, too much work.</br></br>  <br>Alice I can understand, but<br> Kurokiba <br> H-A-Y-A-M-A <br> favourite characters </br></br></br></br>  <br>What makes Alice a better character than Kurokiba besides you being a boy and being attracted to her character design?</br>  <br>sweater under school jacket is such a good combination.</br>  <br>Well, that's what the breast pocket's for.</br>  <br>Alice is much more entertaining character for me, and not because of design (she has a really good one though)  I'm not even into girls  More interesting cooking style too. Her personality switches are more realistic and overall she feels like a more complex character. Kurokiba's "mad bandanna" gimmick feels too childish and he doesn't have much traits beyond that.</br>  <br>There was an article I read in the paper a few weeks back about America's chicken contests. The need for efficiency, aka bigger meat for less feed, bumped farm-raised chickens into the minority.<br><br>Flavor has become one of humanity's greatest lies.</br></br></br>  <br>I want it to be next to the Aldinis booths and see them bickering.</br>  <br>Kurokiba and Hayama are entertaining as fuck, is your judging criteria 'no tits and ass epic downboated' with every character?</br>  <br>Agree<br>Ryou and hayama interaction with alice during this arc has been very entertaining. Much better than the souma and megumi combo.</br></br>  <br> bickering between best girls. <br><br>I don't mind it at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Not that guy but I just dislike Hayama. Kurokiba is alright but he needs more character.</br>  <br>probably helps explain why pretty much everything worth buying these days is loaded up with enough salt to kill a horse (slight exaggeration). I had no idea how much sodium is in so many different products until I got diagnosed with high blood pressure and had to cut back heavily on my sodium intake. there are plenty of options if you're cutting down on carbs, calories, or fat. sodium is fucking everywhere though and in crazy amounts, and one factor for that is probably because it helps make otherwise bland things taste much better.</br>  <br>This sucks and I love salt.</br>  <br>The Hayama Jun stuff shows up throughout the entire election. I really don't know how you missed it.</br>  <br>What it came down to is that not only do I have to eat a ton more fresh produce, but most of the things I want to eat I have to make from scratch. That's both expensive AND time consuming, which has heavily impacted my lifestyle negatively. Obviously I should avoid any frozen foods, but canned, bottled, bagged and boxed foods are also bad too. It's crazy difficult to work around, and I wasn't gifted enough at organizational planning to be able to come up with a meal plan for the week in the first place.</br>  <br>Yes, that's true. For example, there are instant noodles who contain more than 100% of a person's acceptable daily sodium. And there are people who eats it everyday, it's insane.</br>  <br>Damn I'll cut down on some salt then, thanks for the info.</br>  <br>In terms of competition and how stressing the work in a kitchen is, Ryou is right.</br>  Rate them. Who's last, Alice and Ryou?  <br><br>Where it's really sneaky sometimes is the "servings per container" number, which means you have to multiply shit. For example, one of my guilty pleasures was chef boyardee (specifically beefaroni), but those are at least 2 servings a can, so all in all one can has almost a whole day's worth of sodium just by itself. It's nuts.</br></br>  <br>I hope.</br>  <br>Will the camp get two more episodes to round it off, or just one?</br>  <br>If you make it yourself you can use salt substitutes, like potassium chloride. It's still not quite the same, though.</br>  <br>I guess, or Souma. Any of the ones with pupils &gt; any of the ones without.</br>  <br>I hope they keep the same style with the new ED.</br>  <br>Buttbros were the last.</br>  <br>The camp ends this week.

In particular, Eizan appears before any of them, and then there's the matter of Jun as well.<br><br>On the other hand, maybe they'll do something crazy and introduce some in the recap.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what the recap on July 10 is for - to introduce the new cast, &amp; to talk about the Elections.</br>  <br> implying he won't be man up too late </br>  <br>He'll be the main star in Isshiki's stand, calling it</br>  <br> Sawabe Junichi as Hayama <br>Eh, I'm not crazy about that choice. But neither was I about Koyasu as Doujima and that turned out great.</br></br>  <br><br>shit taste</br></br>    <br> he doesn't like durian <br>fucking plebs</br></br>  No spoiler pics today, then?  <br>We may have one or 2 from the Chink group. The standard spoiler pics will be tomorrow.</br>  <br>best version</br>  <br>Shokugeki no Souma is a cooking manga</br>  <br>She'd be hotter with inverted nips</br>  <br>Some people don't have fucked wisdom teeth, you probably got lucky and ended up being one of them. I had all 4 out at 15 years old, it was a week of solid hell followed by the stitches dissolving and slowly being able to eat real food again. Probably worth it, it's been quite a few years and you can't tell any teeth were even trying to grow in there at any point.</br>    <br> Don Club sells Supreme Don in Chinese outfits <br><br>Am I stupid and forgetting something? Why would they wear Chinese outfits?</br></br></br>  Does Hinako have saggy breasts?  <br>Because they're selling Chinese-based Don.</br>  <br>no. they are like Rio Hamasaki's fine tits</br>  <br>That's disgusting.</br>  <br> all dat paizuri art on pixiv <br><br>thank you</br></br></br>  <br> WrongHole?.png </br>  <br> not liking rio hamasaki <br>i've never been more infuriated</br></br>  <br>Again?</br>  Is alice going to fall for souma? I don't want her to leave that lacky guy of hers  <br>My heart.</br>  <br>If she hasn't by now, she's not gonna. Thankfully.<br><br>It's really annoying when every girl falls for the protagonist. I don't wanna be reminded of trashcan harems while reading a cooking shounen.</br></br></br>  <br>No, but she may have acquired a new fucktoy in Akira now that he's been sonzoned.</br>  <br>She wont leave Mad Dog.</br>  <br> Is alice going to fall for souma?  <br>No</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>What's worse. Alice falling for Souma or falling for Akira?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Using digging equipment to stir food <br><br>Looks unhygienic as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Alice won't fall for the MC; Curry falling for her would be a nice twist, as opposed to the other way round.</br>  <br>I don't think the crane arms themselves touch the food. Looks like there are special attachments that I assume are food-safe on the ends.</br>   mfw there is still no "pshh nothing personell kid" victory quote edit from Souma   <br/>  <br>Not really, if you buy it for the sole purpose of stirring food it's fine. Like the hammer I bought solely to separate ice cubes that have frozen together.</br>  <br>The grease and shit from the moving parts could still seep out and into the food.</br>  <br>She wont. I have a feeling shes going to ship Soma x Erina, which is probably what the end romance option will be, especially once she finds out about his dad and that subplot rockets forward</br>  <br>I'll have the Megumi, please.</br>  <br>ONE MEGUMI COMING RIGHT UP!</br>  <br>IT WASN'T MUCH!</br>   food manga thread <br> animal gore <br><br>I fucking loss my appetite fuck you all.</br></br></br>  <br>Become a vegetarian, then, you hypocrite.</br>  <br>Alice will win the bowl. You just got to trust the superior taste of Yuuto and Shun sensei</br>  <br>Beyond deluded.</br>    <br>so whats the appeal of inverted nips anyways? is it because they look like something you could stick your dick inside or am i missing something important here</br>  <br>the mystery of not knowing the real size of the nipples until you excites her</br>  <br>Alice already is in the Dogbowl.</br>  <br> to talk about the Elections <br><br>elections are too far away. we've still got fried chicken arc, kiddie cooking lessons, jouichiro visits polar star, and probably some other stuff I'm forgetting?</br></br></br>  <br>The only fun part about getting your wisdom's removed is being high on codeine or whatever prescription based painkillers they give you. Other than that it fucking sucks dicks.</br>  <br>We're getting the elections. Its confirmed. The new cast for the election arc has been announced.</br>  <br>We are most likely only getting the preliminaries.</br>  <br>That's what we recently discussed - till the end of the prelims.<br><br>Its perfectly doable, without sacrificing or compressing the source material.</br></br></br>  <br>Of course, adapting the autumn election as a whole would be too much.</br>  <br> Erina, Ryouko and my waifu in an onsen. <br>Where did you get that?</br></br>  <br> Meat is still hanging there trying to look relevant </br>  DATABASE DATABASE<br>JUST LIVING IN THE DATABASE WOW WOW</br>  DON'T LOSE YOUR WAAAAAAAY  OH I'M A LUMBERJACK AND I'M OK  BACK ON THE ROCKS<br>BACK ON THE ROCKS<br>BABY</br></br>  JIBUN WOOOOOOOOOOOOO  FROM THE WINDOW TO THE WALL  RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY RUN AWAY  STANDING  YAPPA PAI YAPPA PAI IISHANTEI  I KNOW, I KNOW I'VE LET YOU DOWN.

Also, the very name "England" implies that it does not belong to her. So she would assumedly try to restore her people (modern day Welsh and other fringe Celtics I believe) to the island of Britain.</br>  <br>It's not listed on the bullet points of BD features. The extra for volume II is a drama CD about life at the Clock Tower.</br>  <br>every time i see something new with saber, makes me wish they announced a Fate route readaptation</br>  <br>Garden Avalon didn't get announced for a while either.<br><br>We just have to wait.</br></br></br>  <br> I believe its tied to Garden of Avalon LN waiting for more scans. <br>And awaiting for translations as well.<br>GoA seemed interesting since it's the first time we get to hear more about the Other Side, and Avalon.<br>Merlin being introduced was even better.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure they announced that it would come with a book, but they kept the specifics until later. There's no mention of a book with the BDs.</br>  <br>You and me both</br>  <br>To be honest, rather than a re-adaptation, I would prefer to see it reworked, rewritten, but keeping the basic stuff like Saber being the main heroine and love interest, and Shirou aspiring to be a hero of justice.<br>In fact, it would be nice that if they decide to work on it after UBW and HF, keep some of the themes and adapt it to a Fate route in which Nasu tells us a story about a broken human being, regaining his humanity and still desiring to save people.</br></br>  <br>Well that's what most of us mean when we say readaptation, since Nasu himself said he wanted to rework it.</br>  <br>sure, they just need to<br> trim down on the world building an info dumping <br> Show us more of sabers rule during shirous dream, like the knights and round table, losing caliburn, mordred, etc <br> show us the fights like, gil vs assassin, archer vs berserker, lancer vs gil, etc <br>maybe even expand the whole kotomine/rin/azoth dagger thing, or iliya with shirou /kerry and saber/irisviel stuff<br><br>and animate Last Episode</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't this just an illustration of Takeuchi's trip to England?</br>  <br>Is this supposed to be a parody of something?</br>  <br>That's what I thought as well. Guess we'll have to wait for confirmation from BL</br>  <br>anyone that speaks moonrunes, whats it say on the side</br>  <br>go back to reddit.</br>  <br> reddit <br>are you retarded</br></br>  is this a saber thread<br>please let it be, i miss those</br>  Do Saberfags really believe they will get a Fate route readaptation? I mean there is a higher chance of GoA getting an anime instead of the former.  <br>Not really, but it's nice to believe.</br>  <br>summerfag detected</br>  <br>did takeuchi give saber bigger breasts</br>  <br>Saber's breast size changes depending on Takeuchi's mood</br>    <br>pretty sure this is just an artbook of takeuchi's trip to london</br>  <br>That's what I thought they were going to do initially back when they first announced F/SN 2014 and that it would be an original scenario related to the Fate route written by Nasu but I guess somewhere along the way they scrapped those plans.</br>  <br> that Saber </br>  <br>If they ever do an animated or novel side story about post UBW, I hope it's about the destruction of the greater grail and servants can still get involved somehow, so Shirou gets Modred. Just Imagine, the Faker and the Fake, damn it Typemoon surely likes to tease.</br>    <br>They obviously haven't animated shit for the movies yet considering the amount of "fucking nothing" we constantly see every time they brought up the movie.</br>  <br> Sample <br>SCANS WHEN</br></br>  Garden of Avalon anime when?  <br>Literally nothing.<br><br>2017 at the earliest.</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>yes its takeuchi chuuni log about talking to his waifu's homeland when he was in London<br><br>garden of avalon is shit its just saberwank and merlin is a whiteknight faggot this the reason why BL dont bother do translate it<br><br>i prefer every other shit than the fate route its the worst route anyways</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> UBW after story <br> Destruction of the greater grail <br> A battle between two factions of wizards for the future of the Grail with the same violence of a holy war. <br> Servants are involved with alternative methods <br> Shirou Get Morderd. <br> Badass Lord el-melloi ii <br> Adult Rin <br> More Edelfelt. <br><br>Fuck, i want this shit NOW.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Source</br>  <br> Shirou Get Morderd. <br><br>Shirou's not part of the destruction of the Great Grail.</br></br></br>  <br>only in fate route, He's only not mentioned because in both after Fate and UBW the GG gets destroyed with Rin and Waver faction, in which would obviously take part after UBW. I'm also curious of what Sakura/Zouken would be doing while this happens</br>  <br> Shirou's not part of the destruction of the Great Grail. <br>He's not mentioned, that doesn't mean he couldn't be part of it, It would make no sense he's not part of it neither post fate or UBW unless he's dead at that point or something.</br></br>  <br>Does not matter, the details of the dismantling of the Grail are deliberately vague. It is said only that it degenerates into conflict worthy of an holy war for magnitude. Velvet and Rin come first, but then, it become a war between two factions, therefore, others join them. They can invent the rest as they want, as well as add servants summoned in an unconventional way, creating monsters that do nothing but worsen the situation.</br>  <br>This is problematic, I really want at least a spinoff novel of these events, but then again Nasu said he would want to work with the butcher one more time, imagine urobuchi writing some event like that. it could be really catastrophic.<br><br>I mean the plot devices are there<br> Avenger still around <br> Zouken possibly still around <br> Shinji still around <br> Sakura definitely still around, the older you get, more unchangeable you become <br> Caren possibly still around <br> El Melloi II hating japan <br> Adult Rin <br> Shirou already full grown and after suppasing Archer (with his sassy attitude as a plus) <br> Nothing say servants can't be summoned again <br> Even more broken servants can be summoned since the grail is even more broken than the last two wars. <br> Luvia can be either faction depending on her motives <br><br>And if you wanna asspull some Fanfic material to troll the audience<br> El Melloi II own saber clone apprentice coming too. <br> Modred trolling Shirou/Rin summoning via Avalon x Excalibur <br> Apocrypha servant faction system <br>   maybe Zombie Kirei, for the keks <br> Rin getting Cu   She came back when she got older <br><br>Just get a new protagonist and voila. The setting is really rich. You just need a good writer.<br><br>Actually if Case files can be a prequel to the 5th war, why can something like this come out of it?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> garden of avalon is shit its just saberwank and merlin is a whiteknight faggot this the reason why BL dont bother do translate it <br>What? Merlin is always described as a pervert and a troll by saber</br></br>  <br>can you fuck off</br>  <br> the reason why BL dont bother do translate it <br><br>Since when do Beast's Lair translate anything? It took them 12 years to get Fate/hollow ataraxia out of the door.</br></br></br>  <br>Best stories are always the ones that are not narrated.</br>  <br>but this one is already partly narrated in a side material. So it qualifies more as an unfinished one.</br>  Now that UBW is finished and HF movie is on the way, Fate route readaptation when  <br>Aren't they still trying to figure out how to adapt HF without messing it up?</br>  <br>that'll depend how many movies it'll get, even then most people only care about the last 3 days of that route, with some stuff from the previous days here and there</br>  Unpopular opinion.<br>I preferred the movie UBW than the TV series.<br><br>50 episodes were absolutely too many and the second part unsatisfactory the film, while cutting a lot of stuff, managed the whole much better than Ufotable.</br></br></br>  <br>They will really rush the first half anyway. It's pacing gonna be even worse than ubw</br>  What are you reading, /a/? now that shieldbro has been fully translated, minus the Do Over of Spearhero, i've been having fun tracking down unusual stuff and reading it even if I have to do it through google.<br><br>Following through awesome people that is translating them:<br>* RE:Monster<br>* Risou No Himo Seikatsu (which btw I am also checking through G. Translate, and the fact the title loosely means "My Life as a sponger in a fantasy world" amuses me a lot)<br>* Mushoku Tensei. Its technically over, but I'm still enjoying the "Icing on the cake" chapters.<br>* Overlord (also reading through G Translate, and damn the differences are huge)<br><br>Through G. Translate<br>* Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought there (did the manga stop after they get to the asylum where the MC's mom is at? the novel continues quite a bit. Is it on pause to let the incoming anime catch up?)<br>* Exploring Dungeons with my Fantasy Harem. Guy goes to a fantasy world, decides "fuck it, may as well" and starts adventuring into dungeons to get money and buy slavegirls. Some anons will enjoy the absolute lack of whiteknighting as he isnt shy about using the girls sexually, but at least in so far as I am reading, he still hasn't done the dwarf girl. I guess she would be a legal loli?)<br><br><br>* The Mao is a reincarnated Slime! - Guy reincarnates as a slime and works his way up. Im only on chapter 8 or so but it seems promising so far. Also, morbid curiosity since the author added "sex" to the codes on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The side characters are so damn good on this one<br>http://www.wuxiatranslations.com/te<wbr>nsei-shitara-slime-datta-ken-side-s<wbr>tory-2/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br>If you're reading Coiling Dragon, try the author's other work, Stellar Transformations.</br>  <br>I was thinking about that, but aren't they too similar? With the chinese copy-cat culture I figured that CD being his newer work is "the same but better".</br>  <br>Kuro no Maou <br>Omae wo Onii-chan...<br>Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken <br>So What if It's an RPG World!?, <br>Death March kara Hajimaru Isekai Kyusoukyoku <br>Kuro no Shoukan Samurai<br>I’m a NEET but when I went to Hello Work I got taken to another world <br>Otoburikko<br>Isekai Mahou <br>What Came to Mind During my Third Time in Another World was to For now Get Naked<br>Most of them are not really good but if you like shit like CD and DD than there should be no problem with these.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone know if Fate/Strange Fake is getting properly translated? I've only seen random snips getting translated on BL.  Spoiler week continues here<br><br>Eren's height is actually canon Edition</br></br>  <br>Worst shingekis.</br>  <br>eremikadefensesquad please go back to tumblr.</br>   still no leaks   <br>I like how this picture has their heights in it too.<br><br>Like as if it's saying "hey look Eren is 7cm bigger than her! so it's definitely ok for the two to be a couple!! nothing wrong with being a subhuman (sub 6ft) manlet!!!"</br></br></br>  <br>ackersexual pls.</br>  <br> HELM mentioned <br> EMfag gets butthurt <br>Why are you so insecure?</br></br></br>  <br>He's not taking it so well after canon EH blushing &amp; handholding and canon LM kissing and cover all in the same month.</br>  <br>EM BTFO for the millionth time.</br>  <br>Just wait for the movie. The trailer looked more like EM.</br>  <br>Coolman229 please.</br>  <br> EM  <br> not BTFO </br></br>  <br>I'm not interested in the movie because none of the characters I like are in it.</br>  <br>fuku-shuu pls.</br>  <br>I guess we should let him have fun and post his shitty fanarts. It's all he has left. <br><br><br>Watch the trailer in HD and pause it. It's definitely not Eren. Plus the actress that played Mikasa said she doesn't see EM as romantic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same. Although I got a little interested after Isayama was mentioned. I might watch it to have good laugh though.</br>  <br>I'm not talking about the kiss, but the trailer in general. The kiss looks kind of forced and Eren will probably go full rageturd on him or some bullshit like that.</br>  <br> EM were screaming each other's names and Eren was jealous after Shikishima kissed Micucksa.</br>  <br>Maybe the story will be better than the actual manga</br>  <br>Is it karma for chapter 70 now that Eren is the cuck?</br>  <br>Well at least shippers get the romance fantasy they've always wanted.</br>  <br>The guns already make me sceptical.</br>  <br>Eren's too busy holding hands with Armin or Historia to care what Mikasa does.</br>  <br>But it doesn't Mikasa, who is stronk, didn't push him off and even closed her eyes.</br>  <br>Why would he? It's not like Shikishima was raping his sister.</br>  <br>She doesn't have her strength in the movie.</br>  <br>Maybe Eren will push him away. We already saw a pic of Eren arguing with OC guy. She also makes a strange face before it happens.</br>  <br>I was talking about movie Eren getting buttmad. Historia's not even in the movie because no aryans.</br>   an OOC 3DPD movie had to be made to give EMfags what they want <br>How sad.</br>  <br>[citation needed]<br>Eren is still a titan, and she's still the first of her class.</br></br>  i hope my fellow ymirbrothers will follow me in mass suicide if Isayama actually dares to continue going this het road with EH  <br><br>Why are so many people saying Eren was jealous by the kiss? What part of the trailer showed that?</br></br>  <br>He was seen arguing with Donut Steel later. But it could be a different scene entirely.</br>  <br>Mind posting pic? And that's Kiko overall face, really.</br>  <br>If she was in the movie he would tell her how amazing she was while Mikasa is getting kissed by some shitlet OC.</br>  <br>The EMfags and LMfags got everything they wanted in the movie.</br>  <br>But she is. Her name in it is Hayana or something like that.</br>  <br>Too bad she's not and now Eren is stuck in kebab cuckland.</br>  <br>Yes, a shitty adaption. Feels good being an EHfag.</br>  <br>The scene where he goes in to punch the OC guy. You can see the background is the same scene.</br>  <br> google hayana shingeki movie <br> get indian porn star in results </br></br>  <br>Disgusting.</br>   Series with actual plot <br> everyone is talking about shipping instead </br>  <br> My nigga </br>  <br>You can't really see the background of the kiss scene, and they are with the clothes all the movie, probably.</br>  <br>I'd say wait until the actual chapter comes out but there'd probably be shitposting anyway.</br>  <br>Who cares? It's an OOC adaption anyway. Don't waste time in analysing something insignificant.</br>  <br>I doubt Eren would punch someone above him in rank for kissing Mikasa.</br>  <br>Still related to the series and allowed.</br>  <br>Here.</br>  <br>It's Hiana.</br>  <br>Maybe movie Eren is different. He's a shitty plot device in the manga after all, he could actually have character in live action.</br>  Whats EM and LM?  <br>Glowing titty.</br>  <br/>  <br><br>Eren x Marco and Levi x Marco</br></br>  <br>Cute.</br>  Are you guys ready for some troubles?  <br>I thought that was movie Annie since she's apparently canon with movie Bert.</br>  <br>The ships eremikadefensesquad and ackersexual fight each other for.</br>  <br>Lili or whatever is annie.</br>  <br><br> canon with bert <br> not with armin <br><br>What is this shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it true that his name is  Remus? </br>  <br>That's Lili.</br>  <br>Annie is Lil. Bertholdt isn't in the movie.</br>  <br>How is punching someone for a kiss considered having character? If they were going to change him that much they were better off changing his name and calling him an OC too. The whole reason why certain characters had their names changed was to avoid pissed off fans so why would they have a main character named Eren in love with Mikasa? You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character.</br>  <br>I really hope we actually get his name next chapter.</br>  <br>Then who is Colossal</br>  <br>More than ever.</br>  <br>Armin.</br>  <br><br>No idea, haven't heard it yet.<br><br><br><br> inb4 his last name is Jaeger </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But he's also a rageturd in the manga.</br>  <br>His name is Chaz.</br>  <br>Not Bert is Fukushi.</br>    <br> You can't be that OOC and still share a name with a canon character <br>Says who? Mikasa looks pretty OOC too.</br></br>  <br>Why is Annie kissing Krista?</br>  <br>He still wouldn't be obsessively jealous of Mikasa and punch a guy for kissing her, even in the manga. His brain just isn't programmed to care about shit like that.</br>  While we're on the topic of troubles, who had it worse?<br><br>Nick or Mike? <br><br> I vote Nick because he was a god-fearing man who didn't afraid of anything </br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch the movie to know. She even do the cruel world speech and all.</br>  <br>Because short blonde girls have to stick together</br>  <br>Maybe that's the only OOC part about him.</br>  <br><br>That's not Krista its Reiner.</br></br>  Will we get something like this again this month, brothers?  <br>Damn, Nips are really really ugly people compared to their anime characters.<br><br>I guess you were right when you said that anime is based on white people.</br></br></br>  <br>Just that he didn't punch Levi, they were just talking.</br>  <br>Maybe he would. Who's to say he wouldn't react that way.</br>  <br>Nips are on average very ugly.</br>  <br>We didn't see the whole scene. Just a pic of him arguing with OC guy.</br>  <br>Does Ackerman talk count?</br>  <br>If they didn't care about characters looking OOC they would've put manlet in there and actually used his name. So far movie Mikasa has said the same lines she said in the manga so I don't see how she's OOC.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Again, pic pls?</br>  <br>So much our dreams of going there and becoming English teachers and live the dream of eating ramen and sushi and bento and buying Shingeki no Kyojin merchandise all day long.</br>  <br>Shonkishima grabbed his fist.</br>  <br>Bert getting NTRed is a miracle of the universe.</br>  <br>I was thinking more about the lines of eh moments. But EMfags getting BTFO would be nice too.</br>  Which characters other than Levi weren't in the film?  <br>I fear Isayama is going to toss EH's relationship away.</br>  <br>Do you even read the manga? Eren didn't get the whole Marlo/Hitch thing and he didn't even realize Jean was in love with Mikasa even after he practically said it to him. Eren doesn't care about romance and wouldn't care about someone kissing Mikasa. He'd probably just tell them to hurry up so they can get on with the mission.</br>  <br>Probably, since a new arc is starting.</br>  <br>That's not gonna happen. Though they might not interact this chapter.</br>  <br>BRAY, Erwin, Connie, and Marco.</br>  <br><br>Truly the purest form of justice.</br></br>  <br>*BRAYH</br>  <br>Who the fuck were in the titans then?</br>  <br>Everyone, except EMA.</br>  <br>Will Historia give Eren a good luck kissu?</br>  <br>i'm just wondering how this asshole beat the armored titan</br>  <br> the kids look like chimpanzees <br><br>Hetfag fanart always delivering the worst quality possible.</br></br></br>  <br>Why? Historia is obviously going in the next scouting, so I don't see they being separated soon. She's still part of the top 10.</br>  <br>EH child looks like it has downs.</br>  <br><br><br>Don't even care about the Hetfaggotry, just liked the crazy AA kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Connie is in it though. So is Annie.</br>  <br>She is the queen. She cannot do this anymore, she has to wait in the orphanage for Ymir, her true love.</br>  <br>Mr. Hanji was in it.</br>  <br>Maybe the OCs?</br>  <br>After the reader learned about their connection it would make sense if they had a scene together. There's not much to discuss though. He could tell her he's an Ackerman too. Knowing how Isayama handles awkward moments it has the potential to be pretty funny.</br>  <br>Ymir is kill and Historia isn't a lesbian anyway.</br>  <br>Eren's more focused on Titans than on women. That's why Annie is the perfect girl for him.</br>  <br>I and the EMfags will probably die if that happens. Me from hapiness.</br>  <br>That's not an OC, that's the guy based on a Japanese general responsible for the genocide of Korean people. They changed his appearance / name so the movie sells better in Korea.</br>  <br>No, they're changed with Lil and Souda(?)<br>Like how Levi is changed with Shikishima and all</br></br>  <br>Annie likes Armin.</br>  <br><br>muh nigga</br></br>  <br>She has to take care of people inside the walls. They'll probably barely interact from now on, since the political arc just ended.</br>  <br>Oh, so he's Pixis? I thought he was Erwin.</br>  <br>Me too, from keking.</br>  <br>That means they aren't in it.</br>  <br>They can share each other. I'm sure none of them would object.</br>  <br>It's ok, they don't have to interact anymore. We'll get the surprise 9 months later.</br>  <br>She will carry their child and wait for Eren's return.</br>  <br>Yeah. I was saying they aren't in it.</br>  Dumping best couple.  <br><br>nice</br></br>    <br>Most of the people who lost their homes might go too, since Wall Maria's fixing is certainly by their point of view. And Historia wouldn't stay on the background doing nothing, she proved it with the chicken titan.</br>  <br> Mina/Annie <br> not Hitch/Annie </br></br>    Annie is a slut.  <br>Chicken titan was a personal thing.</br>  Arminfags are the worst shitposters, I wish they would just die.    <br><br>EH confirmed.</br></br>  <br>Anyone have that comic where Hitch challenges Historia to a contest for Annie's attention?</br>  <br><br> worse than Ymirshits and Hisfags <br><br>You're kidding right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump me in with Ymirfags and Arminfags.</br>  <br><br>Wow thanks. I didn't expect anything from this, but this Japanese perception of what Germans are like actually gave me cancer!</br></br>  <br>That was in Chuugakkou right?</br>  <br>You are still cancerous.</br>  <br>Historiafags did nothing wrong.</br>  <br><br>thanks</br></br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br><br> the main shitposters in every single thread since chapter 60 did nothing wrong </br></br>  <br>Just having fun like everyone else.</br>  <br> main shitposters in every single thread <br>That's Ymirfags, dumbass</br></br>  <br>There's no such thing as a non-shitposter in these threads.</br>  <br><br>Ymirfags, Hisfags. What's the difference?</br></br>  <br>Yes, they did.</br>  <br><br>Says the Hisfag.</br></br>  <br>Nope.</br>  <br>That would be the netherfag, and that since way before ch 60.</br>  <br>http://imgur.com/a/gZSnO</br>  <br>What exactly did Historiafags do that makes you so butthurt? Act the same as any other characterfag here?</br>  <br><br> netherfag <br><br>You mean allahfag?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not him but thank you.</br>  <br><br> Yes <br><br> There also more annoying than Ymirfags, at least they give up after posting some shitty tumblr art </br></br></br></br>  <br>What.</br>  <br><br>Yes.</br></br>  <br>Marry me.</br>  <br> There will never be anything this good in the actual series </br>  <br> Annie's nose </br>  <br>Why is Chuugakkou Bert such a miracle?</br>  <br><br> Y-yes <br><br> Also holy shit I forgot what happened to Slutty? </br></br></br></br>  <br>You should just stay in /u/ then.</br>  <br> caring about Wesley </br>  <br><br>I don't b-but did he died or something?</br></br>  <br>Wesley is probably still shitposting here, just without the avatarfagging and soc shit.</br>  <br>He and his twin Dick are back to /co/ now.   Saw one of his drawings in a gravity falls thread once </br>  <br>Someone posted a new pic of him recently.</br>  <br>And yet you call others shitposters.</br>  <br><br>pls no bully</br></br>  <br><br>RIP slutfag literally no one will miss you.</br></br>  <br>What if I bully you  sexually </br>  Levi a shit.  <br><br> That's lewd and inappropriate <br><br> so don't stop </br></br></br></br>  <br>What if he's the Ymirfag/Islamshit everyone's been complaining about?</br>  Apparently the OST tracklist of the live action is this:<br><br>01.

Bert is a big guy </br>  <br>Y-You too.</br>  <br>Is this the spoilers for chapter 71?</br>  <br> "I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF" <br>I giggled</br></br>  <br>It's the spoiler for  your dreams </br>  <br><br>No, this is though.<br><br>Historia and Ymir meet again after years of separation<br> Historia has become the Queen <br> Ymir was recently captured by the SL <br> Erwin brings her forward <br> "My Queen, we have captured the traitor Ymir" <br> Historia stares her down <br> "Why did you betray me Ymir?" <br> Ymir looks as her "Because I love you, and I'll do anything for you" <br> leaps unto Historia <br> they have sex for 30 minutes while the SL watches <br> after their done Historia looks at Ymir "Oh Ymir never leave me" <br> "sorry babe I'm selfish" <br> goes titan <br> kills half of the SL in room <br> escapes with the room in chaos, Erwin half dead and the SL in full panic mode <br> eh? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nice fanfic.</br>  <br> Mikasa's shingeki is wet <br>What.</br></br>  <br><br>thank</br></br>  <br> The majority of humanity is subhuman <br><br>/fit/ pls go and stay go</br></br></br>  <br> being fat by option </br>  <br>He could also be skinny.</br>  <br>He on about Mikasa's 20 inch dick getting wet</br>    OP, Eren definitely got taller in chapter 70 over those two months, but his canon height is the exact same as Mikasa's.  <br> Shiro Sagisu is composing the OST <br>Well at least the SnK franchise has awesome composers.</br></br>  I love /a/'s reaction whenever I use a EM pic on the OP<br><br><br>The point is that they were both 170cm but now Eren is taller.</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you bro for reminding us, I owe you one, great job.</br>  <br>Mikasa is pretty tall for an asian girl. Annie and Historia are european and theyre practically midgets.</br>  <br>The most accurate post ITT.</br>  is ymir a reiss ancestor?  <br>Ymir = the first king</br>  First king wants everyone to be a titan because<br> everyone's having a nice dream <br> everyone gets to live forever <br> peace <br><br>but why did he make a cage for humans?<br> because </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ymir is the first king's hippy cousin that wanted to stay out and daydream all day</br>  <br>He didn't wanted everyone to become titans, he wanted his people to have a place with no wars.</br>  <br>how can you have no wars when you have titan shifters out there?<br><br><br>did he round up all the shifters in the whole entire world and mind raped them all?<br>are BRAMT rebels or people from the other side of the world?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why didn't he just kill all mindless titans?</br>  <br>That was probably MT. I assume MT and first king had one common ancestor, then MT decided to go his own way and Grisha and Ymir are the result of the family line that decided to branch out. MT really is over a hundred years old. Even Grisha is older than what it seemed.</br>  <br>he knows they're all just innocent people that are just having a nice eternal dream</br>  <br> nice <br>Could also be nightmares.</br></br>  <br>Eren was actually having a nice dream in the Trost battle.</br>  <br>In that case it's probably different for every person.</br>  <br><br>True, though Ymir said that she only had nightmares whereas Eren was dreaming of his family. <br><br>The latest chapter made it seem as if they were all inside a nightmare.<br><br>So let's assume that some of the mindless titans do have beautiful, comfy dreams, what if the first king's dream was for humas to live for eternity inside an illusion?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>the smiling titan was also having a nice dream</br></br>  <br>why didn't he want to have one too? <br>why did he take away the chance for everyone else in the walls to have an illusion?<br>sins?<br>why didn't he just kill 'em for sinning?</br></br></br></br>  <br>That moment when your name is Eren your Turkish and you live in japan. Everyone goes oo just like snk!</br>  <br>Must be cool have a turkish slave.</br>  <br> 7 cm taller <br>The coordinate cancer is sapping Eren's life force, he'll die at 170 cm or less while Mikasa keeps developing</br></br>  These threads are shit<br><br>you retards wait for every first of the month to post worthless shit<br><br>Worse than desperate Berserk fans at this point.</br></br></br></br>   Strong prey on the weak <br>Marlo's going to get that serum and be shitEren</br>    <br>it's so ironic that you said worthless</br>  <br>Is this that one game collab?</br>  <br>No its not I'm just retarded to and suck at my own language</br>  <br>not short hair. 0/10</br>  <br>Mike. Nick a shit.</br>  I want to abuse the Bert.  <br>Bert is pure.</br>  <br> how can you have no wars when you have titan shifters out there? <br>Maybe he didn't predict that titan shifters would be used as war machines later on?</br></br>  <br>His emblem is unicorn.<br><br>No point in trying to find 1:1 matches, most OCs are just OCs. Even Shikishima who's meant to be a stand-in for humanity's strongest doesn't really have anything to do with levi as a characters.</br></br></br>  <br> doesn't really have anything to do with levi as a characters <br>Did you watched the movie?</br></br>  <br> tfw King-kun's motivation turns out to be MUH PEACEFUL PARADISE <br>Still shitty if most of the people have to live as starving peasants.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but he already looks extremely out of character.</br>  <br>Because he kissed Mikasa, or because of the other scenes no one didn't saw yet?</br>  <br>He-he is going to be daijobu, right?</br>  <br> He's dying anon </br>  <br>In general. Looks like he's going to be some smug asshole.</br>  <br>So like Levi. Just that he doen't smile, like Levi.</br>  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>So tell how do you think he isn't like Levi. Because Levis's an asshole. You can see it by the way he talked to Annie and how he treated Nick and Historia.<br> cravat <br> humanity's strongest <br> name who relates to Mikasa </br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't acting smug at all. He's just a manlet placeholder with changed personality.</br>  <br>Weren't there character descriptions of the movie cast or something and the only thing Shikishima has in common with Levi is that he's the world's strongest and fujos got mad because he's not cool and aloof anymore?</br>  <br>Haven't seen these.</br>  リリ    At what time dreamfag delivered last month?  <br><br>That is absolutely fucking disgusting.</br></br>   ID:HBWv1IEB <br>Dreamfag's ID on 2ch.</br>  <br>Prolly late, it's 2nd only, we have to wait 2-3 more days anon.</br>  Anyone else HYPE?  <br>You do know that IDs change all the time, right?</br>  <br>I know, browse boards with ID. But sometimes old IDs come back, and this happens often.</br>  <br>6th in nipland</br>  <br>Depends on if he has static or dynamic IP. It's nice to keep the ID in mind, but it doesn't mean that if someone claims to be Dreamfag it's not him.</br>  Name a character right now who's more alpha than this guy.  <br> alpha = being a rapist <br>sasuga /a/ , they really can't into vanilla.</br></br>  <br>Try to reach his erection level first</br>  One Piece 792 discussion.<br>So, next chapter we finally have some international reactions again?</br>  I was expecting doffi to either escape safely or be mercilessly murdered by kaido's henchmen right there or something. I wonder if he'll ever reach impel down<br><br><br>I hope to see a little shot of Akainu breaking his teeth from anger</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>No probably not, I wouldn't expect him to do it either but if he wouldn't then why would Sabo? That'd be even more out of character.</br></br></br>   Man, this is getting really tough, I hope they're not going to take too long to join us over there   <br>I hate off-model fanart so much</br>  <br>it's unlikely Sabo was going to kill Burgess in the first place, and he most likely didn't. He probably just fucked Burgess' shit up by breaking his face.</br>  So Riku returns to his throne just as Gan Fall did, who were the fucks that said someone else would take it?  Fujitora for next Straw Hat  <br>It's all this "Sabo is crazy" bullshit that keep coming up. If you say it enough, some of the faggots in here will start believing it. And then get disappointed when it doesn't happen.<br><br>Burgess isn't dead. Sabo didn't kill him. He's heard screaming off in the background the page after. He might have some burns or scars but he isn't dead.</br></br></br>  <br> Sabo <br> not crazy </br></br>  where were his eyes. how many more chapters  <br> Works under Akainu aka "Hitler Two" in service of the World Government, which is led by pretty much literally Nazis; slavers, murderers, people who think they are masterrace. <br>Yeah. Pretty much confirmed.</br></br>    <br>he may be emotionally scarred for one reason or another, but I highly doubt he's crazy.</br>  <br>Is there a continuation to this image?</br>  <br><br>Post more Robin.</br></br>      You really have to be autistic and not feel with Sabo in that scene, and call him "crazy" for "overreacting" or something  <br>Screw that! It's Sabo time</br>    What anime will you be watching this season?  Natsume.  Prison school.  Teekyuu  What's that anime based off Urobuchi and 3 other people playing D&amp;D together? Is it airing this season or did it air already?  I have no idea. I'll lurk in this thread and see if some interesting things pop up.   winter was saekano threads <br> spring was yahari threads <br>which thread will the condensed mass of shitposters ruin this summer?</br></br>  <br>Gangsta, we had one thread yesterday that went full retard<br><br/></br></br>  <br>Gate<br>Gangsta<br>Charlotte<br>God Eater<br><br>Pick one or  all of them </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gangsta.</br>  <br>Aquarion</br>  These, Soma, and Yuki-chan  <br>Gate will be shitposting central.</br>  <br> comfy gate threads are officially dead <br>Fuck this gay earth.</br></br>  <br>The only hope is to ignore them until they get bored,  but we know that will never happen because people are retarded. </br>  <br>On the upside, there's a greater chance for more OC. Although that might not necessarily be a good thing.</br>  <br> On the upside, there's a greater chance for more OC <br>I can't wait for all those brand new dank memes</br></br>  All of them   mfw I'm deployed to the desert <br><br>I'll catch up  ...if  I get back</br></br>  <br>Desert is the little brother of desertion.</br>  <br> not watching anime in the midst of battle </br>  <br>Gangsta, prisma illya until the anti loli brigade give up, DBZ:S, TLR:D 2nd</br>  I loved the game, so I'm super hyped for the God Eater anime. Also it's ufotable so we can guarantee the action scenes will be glorious.  <br>And in the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere, without a stable enough connection to download or stream anything. We can get through this.</br>  <br> not gladly matching shooting sand people with the OPs/EDs rhythm </br>    <br> 77777 </br>  <br>They'll be waiting to please your dick</br>  <br><br><br><br>OP here, thanks for the recs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  <br>np</br>  <br> Saving Private Madoka </br>  <br>What website is that?</br>  <br>It's an application called Taiga. It's the best thing.</br>  <br>Not that guy but it looks like Taiga which is a neat Windows program you can use to sync with your MAL account and add shows that you're watching/going to watch.</br>  <br>yup it's Taiga</br>  u know it  <br><br>Thanks bruhs.</br></br>  <br>Not summer</br>  Non Non Biyori 2<br>Prisma Illya Herz<br>Im@s CG 2</br></br>  Moeshit all over this season. Waht a surprise.<br><br>I honestly don't even know if I'm gonna follow anything during this season.</br></br>  In preparation for Symphogear GX, let's discuss what our favourite girls and songs are.<br><br>Having just finished season 2 to get ready for GX, I have to say Seigi wo Shinjite Nigiri Shimete is definitely the best Symphogear song. <br><br> I want Hibiki to push me down and have her way with me. </br></br></br></br>  I want to marry Chris.   Seigi wo Shinjite <br> not Rainbow Flower <br><br>Do you even UTAE?<br><br> I want to do butt stuff with Hibiki </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>but HIBIKE HIBIKE HEART YO</br>  <br> not wanting to roar the elegy of love at full throttle </br>  I'm in this for Tsubasa.  <br>I'm in this for everyone.<br>Symphogear is not complete without all the gears, even the new ones.</br></br>  <br>I love DMJii, but Maria is still useless.</br>  <br>Maria is trying very hard. She'll surely be useful when she gets Airgetlam back.</br>  I'm surprised there's no s3 spoiler.  <br>Where would you even get spoilers from? Symphogear is an anime original. <br>At most you can find are some impressions for the episode 1 prescreening but they don't really tell you more than the trailers do.</br></br>  <br> Maria is trying very hard. <br>That just makes her more annoying.<br>I hope she stays locked up after the episode one duet. That's all she's good for, judging from G.<br><br><br>Chris-chan is cute.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  This thread is now a Tsubasa worship thread.<br>Also every Nana song best song</br>  I bet Phara will knock Tsubasa out in episode 2.  <br>And then Maria saves her with her kung-fu skills.</br>    <br>I'm not on my home pc, I don't have any Tsubasa pics. Please forgive me for posting things scavenged off the official site.</br>  <br>I'm digging the sleeveless uniforms.</br>  Post Kirika.    <br>DESS</br>  <br> yfw you realize she has a scythe because she keeps saying DEATH </br>  <br>Or because her name is Kirika, which means  I want to fuck Kirika .</br>    I just want to befriend Aoi Yuuki.<br/>  <br/>  Who tops?  <br>Fine</br>  <br>I'm going to get yelled at, but there's something about her eyes that make her seem insincere.<br>Not even in that video, but just in all her photos.<br><br>It's probably just because they're so black, which feels unnatural to me.</br></br></br></br>  What are the odds that Chris' song isn't disappointing again?  <br><br>Isn't that just true for all VAs and Idols, or even maybe to japanese in general?<br>It's not like they're ever being encouraged to be open and sincere towards others. Even seemingly random losing of control and showing of emotion seems somehow artificial and follows specific social rules.</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably mostly a VA/idol thing.<br>They're media personalities at the end of the day, which aren't known for being exactly genuine.</br></br>  Do the gears emit the instrumental music and backing vocals?<br><br>Why do the military people waste millions in ammunition against noise?<br><br>What the fuck was the frontier?<br><br>Why did they have a training montage instead of looking for Miku?<br><br>Why is Chris so cute?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why do the military people waste millions in ammunition against noise? <br><br>This is one of the points that made me drop Ep.1 of S1 initially, that fucking clichee of helpless dumbfonded incompetent military guys that get just murdered by monsters while just standing there shooting them panicked. Also why do they have like 20th century military equipment and tanks in such a futuristic setting?</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't been around yesterday because I want to avoid the spoilers and I'm trying to not read this thread.<br>Where is the stream going to happen? I think ohys died.</br></br>  <br>Bullets do work against Noise, but only during the exact moment they phase out of their subspace to attack.<br>And isn't Symphogear supposed to be in a contemporary setting with just a few fancy designs for buildings and vehicles?</br></br>  To be honest, I don't give a fuck about the songs.  <br>neetball.<br>Don't worry, there aren't any spoilers yet, really.</br></br>  <br> spoilers <br>Chris-chan is cute.</br></br>  <br>Yes.<br>http://mfi.re/watch/mci2ubi2pu9cshf<wbr>/1425258736956.webm</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Does this look like a contemporary setting?</br></br>  <br><br>Or this?</br></br>  <br>How? Symphogear without songs would be only half as fun.</br>  <br> Do the gears emit the instrumental music and backing vocals? <br>yes<br><br>just like a karaoke machine, says hibiki in one of the Zesshoushinai shorts</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Well the rest of the city does. It's just some fancy building designs slapped in here and there.</br></br>  <br>I actually like how to songs actual reflect the personalities of the characters and show development without having them go into monologues.</br>  <br> a futuristic setting? </br>  <br> Tobe! = Take this! </br>  <br>Thomas designed them because it's Agematsu's request.</br>  <br>That's pretty cool then.</br>  I just noticed that Hibiki's zerker face looks kinda silly here.<br><br><br>Well of course do large parts of the citiy look like today, the city I'm living in also has lots of buildings that are 50-100 years old, for example the one I'm living in, and it looks not much different from a modern building.<br>Look at their technology, the floating translucent screens, the buildings. It's not playing in a distant future, but easily 50-100 years from our present.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that's a mix of really cool and really lame<br><br>neat lore though</br></br></br></br>  <br>MGS4 took place last year.<br>NGE is happening as we speak.</br></br>  <br>The Maria/Tsubasa concert was the shaking image, so that's a clue that something big will happen (besides the concert I mean).</br>  Hikasa said Evan Call lived in Gungnir that's why we got Kort el fes Gungnir intro.  <br>Yes, this. Even the OPs and EDs are thoroughly integrated into the show. I also like the variety of styles that they come up with (Chris gets the brasher ones, Nana gets more elegant and skillful ones, Hibiki gets the loud ones) to go with different action scenes.</br>  <br>you know these weird things that their suits have on their lower backs? those are the speakers, actually</br>  <br>But those are jet boosters.</br>  <br>DESS!</br>  <br> not striped <br>Satelight you had one job.</br></br>  <br>I thought she had shimapan.</br>  <br/>  <br><br> random edgy arrows and non-secured helmet that should fall off  <br>I hate it</br></br></br>  <br>Also it would be badass if she used that scythe like an actual polearm weapon, not whatever she was doing in G.</br>  <br> aoi yuuki in charge of not crying.webm <br>And she is crying again near the end of the live when nobody is looking.<br>I want to cuddle her.</br></br></br>  32 hours.  <br>Kirika and Shirabe's gear designs are fucking stupid</br>  <br> scythe <br> actual polearm weapon <br>How would you even do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Ver best girl, post more Ver</br>  <br> genuine <br>8man please.<br>Japanese people prioritize being polite over being sincere.<br>And Aoi was screaming her heart out during that performance, which such a raw display of emotion I don't what else more "genuine" do you want.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mod it into a war scythe, which is repositioning the blade to make it closer to a halberd/naginata.</br>  <br>It really is much better without the stupid skirt thing.<br>Not even just lewder, but objectively better.</br></br>  <br>She did that and but then turned it into a scissor.</br>  <br><br>that's just a shitty spear that peasants jury-rigged as polearms then</br></br>  <br>They're much more wield-able than a regular scythe configuration. That's why peasants modded them in the first place.</br>  <br><br><br>I thought that was the point, that they had edgy retarded costumes because they were initially evil</br></br></br>  <br>Do we know what date Third Impact is supposed to happen on?</br>  <br>Early January 2016. Probably new year's day.</br>  <br>They weren't really evil. Only Ver was evil. They were just edgy chunnis.</br>  <br>But there are spoilers<br> ___________________________________<wbr>_______________Chris-chan cute_______________________________<wbr>________________________________</wbr></wbr> </br></br>  <br><br>I hope her new song will be better than the S2 song.<br>I would love Chris singing to become more operatic, I love Ayahi's opera voice.</br></br></br>  Did they exterminate Exterminate on youtube?  <br>King Records willed it.</br>  <br> Chris <br> opera <br>That won't be my Chris.</br></br></br>  Reminder<br> http://pastebin.com/LZ98npuX </br>  <br>I feel like a huge faggot for asking this but why doesn't 4chan allow puush links?</br>  <br><br>Maybe not, maybe, but still, it would be beyond awesome.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Kzg<wbr>e6KATp_s</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  I hope S3 sucks so S4 would have better fanbase than S2.  <br> Engrish <br>I'm sorry.

Plus ZAWARUDO!</br>  <br>None of their fucking powers is how it really works.</br>  <br>Madara ain't got enough shit to beat Accelerator at his peak.<br><br>And I'm not talking about pre brain damaged Accelerator. I'm not talking about post brain damaged Accelerator nor awakened Black Wing Accelerator. Hell, I'm not even talking about World War III White Wings Accelerator either. I'm talking about Kami Nimo Hitoshii Chikara No Henrin Wo Furuu Mono Angelerator with full control over his awakened state (which alone has helped him tanked an Eurasia Buster attack without using vector reflection, flying casually at Mach 15 movement speed), with supersonic reaction speed, high level intellect support by near ten thousands of espers that rival 2 super computer which can predict weather for a whole month ahead with perfect accuracy, along with high skilled markmanship, a modified crutch that hide counter measure to protect his choker from interference devices. With just his esper ability alone, Accelerator has showed to be able to survive no less than 200 millions of meteors from Divine Judgement, reflecting human magic, absorbing 5 minute worth of Earth's kinetic energy, fighting while protecting normal citizens at supersonic speed, wrecking Dark Matter without even the need to unleash his Wings, reverse-engineering magic technique, accessing and editing informations stored in human brain, and last but not least, monitoring fetal development just by touching a pregnant woman.</br></br></br>  <br>10/10. Would read it again.</br>  Sure. Get Lancer from Fate/Stay Night and have him use his spear. The only thing that can stop it is divine intervention.   a fucking attosecond   Apparently we just pull our punches at the last second.<br><br>gg no re</br></br>  <br>This. Gae Bolg &gt; Accelertwink</br>  <br><br> implying Accelerator doesn't have Saber-tier's plot armor. </br></br>  Have Kuroko teleport poison directly inside his heart while he sleeps.<br><br>Or just literally . 60-80 more years left, tops. He's only human.</br></br>  we have quite the assortment of autistic methods in this thread but why don't we just poison him.<br>With a gas in his sleep or something worse in his food</br>  <br> How do we kill the Accelerator? <br><br>With fire.</br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't, though. He just has an OP ability.</br>  <br>The fate series would be so much better without her. No endless clones, no asspulls.</br>  <br>You can't. <br><br>No matter what counter-measures you have on him he can just sprout white wings bullshit and survive it. Even Touma only won the fight in the snow because Accel let him to</br></br></br>  I love it when this guy starts laughing.<br>Like holy fuck.<br>Just make him listen to recordings of that shit, he might just die of embarrassment.</br></br>  <br>loli overload</br>  <br>No, Touma won because he the strongest plot armor ever.</br>  I feel sorry for Accelerator. The guy is just a big bundle of unfortunate circumstances. He would have been just a normal, well-adjusted guy if he had a better upbringing.  He beat Accelerator once.<br>He can do it again.</br>  Kazuma could kill Accelerator or even slice of his bs wings. <br><br>Prove me wrong faggots.</br></br>  Easy  <br>10/10 would read again</br>  <br>Tell Izzard some acceptable lie about what Accelerator's power is, so he'll be confident, and then have him imagine Accelerator ceasing to exist.</br>  Lure him in with the fake Loli.    <br> monitoring fetal development just by touching a pregnant woman. <br>wut?</br></br>  <br>Could Nanami get vectors?</br>  Alucard and his immense plot armor of omnipresence  <br>If anyone ever tried to pull that in real life, everyone in the room would be beating the shit out of them before they were halfway through the laugh.</br>  poison  <br>It'd be a doozy, but with his plot armor, he could probably live.</br>  <br>Well she probably couldn't see them, and the powers are all over the damn place it's impossible understand what it actually is in the first place.<br><br>Then again she's Nanami, so she'll find some way to troll him.</br></br></br>  Send him to South Korea.  <br>This. He's fucked against Ars Magna.</br>  <br>You punch and then just before it connects you pull it back quickly.</br>  <br> Still couldn't kill Touma with it <br>His power is shit.</br></br>  <br>The guy shot Touma with fake bullets, chopped off his arm, and then shat himself like a retard and got so scared he couldn't use his magic anymore. It was as plot-dictated as Touma beating Accelerator.</br>  <br>Acelerator can only control vectors, so kill him with something that's not vectorial. Like temperature?<br><br>You could also poison him. His supercomputer like brain theorically has the power to detect fumes, but his sensing organs can't. By the time he finds out it's too late.</br></br></br>  Uchiha Madara  <br>Make him read the series<br> "I'm sure you'll enjoy this," says Mikasa as Mikasa hands you a book titled, "From the best-selling authors of Accelerator's angst, we give you Electric Boogaloo 2: Accelerator's never ending angst BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOU NEVER WANT IT TO END." <br> I always manage to save everyone <br> Unless it's a well developed side character with a lot of plot potential :^) <br> Kakine is literally taken over by a Rhinoceros Beetle <br> Rhinoceros Beetle is also the best boy in the series <br> Rensa <br> Rensa <br> RENSA "ALL YOUR POWERS COMBINED AND I'M OUT OF WRITING IDEAS" CYBORG <br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Vq<wbr>CXXMvMm6g</wbr>  [ ] <br> immortal zombies eating brains <br> actual zombies <br> Original Kakine gets back his body <br> promptly turned into a beachball and then a girl and becomes Othinus' bitch <br> REALITY <br> W <br> A <br> R <br> P <br> Omnipotent magical god <br> lose to a bullied human via the power of bad writing <br> I really wanted a Death Note but I have to make do with this email requesting the prompt annihilation of Touma <br> I descended from the heavens <br> to punch Touma out using my fist <br> Everyone's out to kill Touma including Obama: the comedy fanfic. <br> <br>And I'm only up to NT 10 so far.</br> </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask Shiki.</br>  <br>I'm not sure there is a "too late" for him, since he could theoretically just restructure his whole body to its previous state.</br>  <br>That sounds so good, I might read the novels.</br>  <br>Some plot points are So Bad it's Good.</br>  Especially Mr Rhinoceros Beetle 05 who was surprisingly well characterised for a character who was seemingly written while the author was under the heavy influence of drugs.  <br> He doesn't, <br> survives penetrating gunshot to the center of the head. </br></br>  <br>There where often enough people surviving headshots and other shit penetrating the brain</br>  <br>What do we think the bullet took out? Basal ganglia (action selection), Broca's area and Wernicke's area?</br>  <br> Like temperature? <br>To increase the temperature you would need to add or take away heat into the system around him, meaning energy will be flowing, meaning there will be a flux, meaning there's a vector.</br></br>  <br>with trips</br>  <br>Vacuum</br>  Magic Vectors &gt; Science Vectors  <br>Accel can use those too, as well as make up vectors that don't exist, when in angel mode.</br>  Reality warp, any skill that cannot be blocked like Gay Bulge, Za Warudo, just take out the oxygen of everything around him, etc etc etc.<br><br><br>Not if you can manipulate temperature of something in a closed space, like lvl 5 Uiharu does. Just melt his brain.</br></br></br>  <br> Gay Bulge <br>Won't kill him.</br></br>  <br> like lvl 5 Uiharu does <br>No one fucking knows what a level 5 Uiharu could do, stop making shit up.</br></br>  <br>Uiharu can't even reach level 5 or else she wouldn't have gotten fucked over by the Parameter List so speculating about that is irrelevant and useless.</br>  <br>When heat increases the average kinetic energy of the moving molecules increases. These individual molecules should have vectors.</br>  <br> Won't kill him. <br>Yes it will.<br>The only thing stopping Lancer from killing everything that stands in his way is his Luck stat.<br>And don't give me that 'vector of causality' bullshit again, it's easy to tell when you're talking out your ass.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I challenge him to a fist fight.</br>  <br> implying he can't vector causality with white wings </br>  <br>Explain to me how piercing his heart will kill Accel, when he can move blood around his body without it.</br>  <br>It doesn't just pierce the heart.<br>Gáe Bolg: Barbed Spear that Pierces with Death (刺し穿つ死棘の槍ゲイ・ボルク, also translated as Spear of Impaling Barbed Death?) is an attack focused on a single target, created by Lancer to suit his own style, that strikes a fatal blow that always pierces the opponent's heart and ruins their body from within with its thousand iron thorns. It literally freezes the mana in the air, and it can easily be perceived as a sure-kill technique by all those around simply from being charged with magical energy.<br><br>I don't know about you, but I'd think particularly difficult equations would be hard to focus on when you have a thousand iron thorns running through my body.<br><br><br>Then it becomes bullshit again. Like how Accel doesn't have Esper power (nobody in Indexverse does) to do reality warping on the scale of Mahoukaverse. Its literally challenging the laws of the world, as a single person. You don't beat the world.<br>I'll explain it how I explained Haruhi killing Accel a few threads ago, when somebody tried to explain that Accel could reverse the causality of Haruhi's wish.<br>Haruhi Wishes Accelerator is gone &gt; This Wish changes reality &gt; Reality says Accelerator is gone &gt; Accelerator says Accelerator is not gone &gt; Reality takes precedence &gt; Accelerator disappears.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Curses, jamming his transmitter and ozone. If you fail to kill him quickly, he will go angel mode and you won't be able to stop him anymore. Anyways, we have enough evidence to suggest level 5s can't be killed in the first place. Their souls will just use their abilities to facilitate new vessels for themselves. Accel can reassemble his corpse, Kakine can create a new body with Dark Matter, Mikoto can just jump into the net and eventually create a mecha version of herself, Mugino becomes living lasers, Misaki becomes a collective schizophrenic consciousness inside everyone she's ever used her powers on. Number 6 and number 7 probably can't die. The former being an abstract legend and the latter having too much guts.</br>  <br> Ozone <br>I think he could just filter that out using reflection<br><br>In my opinion there's several surefire ways of killing him:<br> Ingested poison: Something that paralyses his limbs preventing him from switching on his esper powers or kills him eg cardiac arrest before he can do so or killing him silently before he can figure out what's wrong and activate his esper powers (something like carbon monoxide which) <br> Speed/priority attacks: killing him quickly and before he can switch on his esper powers. Eg discreet sniping or decapitation <br> Hacking/removing his choker: Defcon apparently discussed the viability of introducing malicious code into electronic devices VIA CHARGERS. Swap out Accel's charger or charge cycle his battery too often and that will interfere with his combat ability <br> Very slowly: ROS via oxygen molecules and/or accumulated DNA damage will eventually give Accel cancer since he needs oxygen to live but his body's metabolism will produce ROS causing cell damage. Biological weapons might also work here especially if a virus imitating Accel's DNA was rejected by his barrier and his barrier <br> Affecting Accel's mood balance: probably falls under 'drugs' but changing his hormone balance esp oxytocin and/or binding may affect how susceptible he is to depression <br>**on that note, Microsoft Word looks like it has a better comparing facility than Accelerator, seriously how difficult is it to compare two copies of the same document when it's small enough to fit on physical media<br><br>I reckon that Misaka Original could one shot brain damaged Accelerator given the fact that the choker presumably contains electronic components if she gets the attack in before he flips the switch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  God goku shits a ki blast, godly ki can't be read or understood by his autoreflect and bypasses his defenses.  <br>Auto-reflect is on at all times even after the brain damage.</br>  <br>I assumed that was just UV?</br>  <br>Otherwise I'd have thought that the brain damage barely affected him at all. Autoreflect, in my opinion, is Accel's most useful ability period.</br>  <br>Send some faggot with a lot of plot armor</br>  <br> kaworu <br> is that you? </br></br>  <br>With Tohno Shiki, Kamijou Touma, or a Servant.<br>Alternatively, Demonbane, Alucard, or Card Captor Sakura.<br>Lastly, Uchiha Madara, Dio, Freakazoid, or Kefka.</br></br></br>  <br>Decelerator</br>  <br>rotareleccA</br>  <br>is shooting him in the head an option?</br>  <br>Yeah if you want painless, fast suicide.</br>  <br>So anybody is reading his manga? has he fucked the blond girl yet?</br>  <br>He's pure for LO.</br>  <br>15 times.</br>   morons still think that Accelerator is invincible <br>Silver Surfer can easily kill Accelerator. Everything I said are facts.</br>    <br>I thought WORST was pregnant by him.</br>  <br>Ask him politely to drink a gallon of bleach.</br>  <br> Comfy SoL with Accel and LO <br> LO enters Accel's apartment <br> "I got you a glass of really tasty milk!" <br> "Rub a dub dub, thanks for the itadakimasu!" <br> ... <br> "This shit is top shelf! Get me some more!" <br> "Right away!" <br><br>I've thought of a lot of ways to kill accel, but this is by far the stupidest and funniest. If there were a way for him to go, I'd want this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Hire a doctor to heal him.</br></br>  <br>Academy City sure is the best place to hide Gallifrey's most forgetful Time Lord psychic criminal who keeps misplacing dangerous books.</br>  <br><br>Ever think about how the cleaning robots look like Daleks?<br><br>They don't look like Daleks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not to worry, I'm sure that Academy City is fast on their way to producing Cybermen. <br>Also wonder what'd it be like if Accelerator was hooked up to the TARDIS considering the fact that it's made out of maths. And the circuits could probably compensate for his lost language abilities.</br></br>  <br>You can't kill the killer cripple. He has achieved maximum power in shounin lore while now baring a major weakness, which is time limited ass whoopings with huge cool down periods.</br>  <br><br>Uiharu is a worthless piece of shit.<br>She can't reach level 5.<br><br>What do you think the Parameter List is?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Cybermen? Cybermen?<br><br>You are superior in only one respect. You are better at dying.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Accelerator happens upon a group of half converted clone babies <br>How mad would he be?<br>All the Five_Over and cyborg stuff could be heading in that direction with the Level 5s becoming obsolete.</br></br></br>  <br>But don't let the cleaning robots get into a fight with the cyborgs, anon.  Or Aleister will be mad. </br>  <br>This. He can basically manipulate temperature by considering it as a collection of vectors.</br>  When will the NT13 prologue be released? I thought it will be this day.    With all the crazy shit happening in Raildex it almost feels like a japanese version of those early DC or Marvel comics. Face it, Raildex is a japanese High school Justice league  <br> everything that has superpowers is a Marvel or DC rip-off </br>  Sakura is only 4th most popular. Rin is 2nd. Saber is 1st. We now have conclusive evidence on who best girl is.  <br>Just like my Chinese netorare comics.</br>  <br>The most dirty of secondaries.</br>  <br>The only conclusion is that Fate has become a gateway anime of the worst kind.</br>  <br> We now have conclusive evidence on who best girl is <br>Yes, it's Rider, because it's a well known fact that Japan has shit taste.</br></br>  <br> black guys and old men <br>Then why isn't Rin on top then?</br></br>   yeah we had oral when you were backstage, I asked him for anal too but Ash said there was no more time     <br>Everything is bullshit, the music is butchered, voice acting is butchered, some scenes are heavily altered like whenever something flashy appears (prob bec of porygon ep). Don't bother, but if you want nostalgia, watch dubs first OP, it's a remix of original pokemon OP</br>  <br>Also avoid BW(5th gen) at all costs right now, it's complete bullshit, everything.</br>  <br>It has its moments, anon.</br>  <br>Not everything.</br>   you will never smell a sweaty tomboy <br><br>Suffering.</br></br>  <br>Since 2006, faget.</br>  <br>What should she do? <br> hey jun you like tomboy <br>He would flip her off or laugh at her face, she needs to take drastic measures for a guy that dense.<br><br>She's the most selfless character in the manga towards her friends, look at </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Her relationship with MC is bad so it's really the only way she can approach it. Really though she should just butt out and stop being a miserable cunt. It's obvious she's harboring repressed feelings for MC also.</br>  <br> lets two friends go with umbrella <br> "MOST SELFLESS CHARACTER IN THE MANGA" <br>Yeah she's a real angel. <br><br><br>She has a mischievous personality, and that's also the only way she know to "push" MC, but he's obviously tired of her shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Spoilers I guess<br>The guy made himself super dense/oblivious to tomo's "charms" so he would keep be around her instead of spaz out.<br>Yer</br></br>   1 day <br> 1 volume <br><br>Tonight, the journey ends.</br></br></br>          </blockquote>]
