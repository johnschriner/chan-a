[ White girls are everywhere in anime. Post white girls in anime.  <br>what kind of abomination is in that picture</br>  <br>Kill it with fire.</br>  I'll sue!!  Nearly all the girls in anime are white anyway.<br>Heightwise they may be asian, but in all other ways they look more white than asian</br>  <br>If whites assume all anime characters are white, and Asians assume all anime characters are Asian, does that mean blacks assume all anime characters are black?</br>  Her 3D counterpart is not as white tho.  <br>Apart from dbz and a few other big anime do blacks even watch anime?</br>  <br>France and Italy have pretty much the largest anime fanbases outside of Japan, mate.</br>  <br>Its actually pretty popular among black people, but they almost exclusively watch action anime. They run away at the slightest hint of a plot and won't even go near something based around moe.</br>  <br>I like reading these kinds of posts in the voice of a safari guide or something<br>"It's a common misconception that black people do not like anime, they actually watch a lot, but dislike moe. And to the right you can see a gang fight, these are often..."</br></br>   murriniggers <br> white </br>    <br>I thought france was mostly just ragheads, not sure about italy though.<br><br><br>Do they actuallydownload/seek out anime at all? I thought they just watch whatever airs on American tv/whatever is popular in reddit or facebook.</br></br></br></br>    <br>do blacks even know how to use the internet XD shouldn't they be showering instead XD</br>  <br> : For your ironic shitposting needs.</br>  <br>Any particular reason French and Italian people like anime so much?</br>  <br>It got introduced early in the 80s.<br>A whole lot of generations grew up watching anime, and it became cultural, but now dumb murrican cartoon pollute kid channels.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Harmony Gold used to do alot of marketing of anime into Europe back then, I mean like before Robotech? I think I remember hearing that somewhere.</br>    T-MINUS 11 DAYS TILL WE GET OFF THE BOAT AND THE WORLD ENDS<br><br>ARE YOU HAPPY?<br>GUTS IS HAPPY!</br></br></br>  Guts can be happy? I want to know why Griffith is gathering everyone to his city.  <br>To recreate another festival probably<br>Summoning the other God Hand to Falconia</br></br>  Will guts even be still alive after they will get off the boat?<br><br>His body is taking hard times since he got that armour. Maybe his internal oragns are fucked up already and he is living only because of his hatred? Slowly changing into some type of undead warrior like skelebroknight?</br></br>  <br>He's the main character of course he will</br>  The boat feels like such a long time ago, but it's only been like 4 chapters.  <br>Of course he'll still be alive. I'm betting the fairies will be able to fully heal all of his injuries (except his arm and possibly eye) and he'll be in top shape, ready to square off against the godhand. He won't die until Griffith dies.<br><br>Caska will not regain her memories though. Guts will realize she's happier as she is now.</br></br></br>  <br>more like 4 volumes mate</br>  <br><br>Im not saying that he would just die. Im saying that maybe he will become something like skull knight</br></br>  <br>Miura only released a handful of chapters last year and before that we were still on the boat.</br>  I love that whale boss though  <br>They got on the boat in volume 32<br>We're almost at volume 38 now<br>Its been 6 years</br></br></br>    retard casca is best casca  <br>SASUKE IS REAL BLACK SWORDSMAN</br>  <br>Yeah but I'm referring to the boat from the last time we've seen it. I guess if they're still on the boat then that would make the whole 4 chapters ago thing meaningless.<br><br>You're right nvm.</br></br></br>  <br>That's not Afro Samurai.</br>  <br>I have cancer now.</br>  <br>Jojo is the real black swordsman</br>   tfw re-reading Berserk once again  <br>I'm so fucking hype I can't hardly wait</br>  <br>11 days until we get a chapter and wait 2 years for the next one</br>  imagine if the elves give guts his arm back  <br>FUCK OFF STOP WITH THE SPOILERS</br>   mfw there are people who waited years for the new chapter <br> mfw there are people who have been following Berserk since the 90's  <br> mfw people died waiting for It  <br> mfw I won't wait one fucking day </br></br></br>  Now that Guts has Divine Greatsword +10 and Occult Armor +10, he just has to go full ISIS and kill himself along with the Godhand and the Idea of Evil.  How mad would you be, if this guy manages to kill Griffith?  <br>It will appear monthly afterwards</br>  <br>He won't. Only Guts can kill Griffith.</br>  <br>Could Guts win Dio without Dio having The World?</br>  Guts body is a mess, and Casca is unlikely to reeturn to exactly the way she was. The worst thing about his suffering is that he will burn in eternal hell fire writhing in agony, once he dies because that's what awaits sacrifices.<br>There is no good end for guts.</br>  <br>Guts first needs some humanity badly, before he goes hollow.</br>  <br>I don't think an apostle can kill Griffith. Not because lack of power, but an apostle should not be able to kill a god hand, its superior master.</br>  <br>What if he don't die but stay between these worlds forever? Just like Geiserich</br>  P-please tell me you are not kidding???? ARE WE GETTING OF THE BOAT?  <br>That's not better either, IMO. Guts will never know the peace of death and a decent afterlife.</br>  I stopped reading when Jack Sparrow morphed into a giant squid. What have I missed?<br>Should I continue where I left, or I can just jump in now that they're off the boat?</br>  <br>They aren't off yet<br>Continue from where you left off, you're pretty much up to date anyway.</br></br>  <br>You missed me.</br>  <br>And when he would manage to kill the god hand and god himself?</br>  <br>Pre-wise magical Griffith Casca is best Casca, but I'm going to miss Spas Cas. She gave zero shits.</br>  <br> kill god himself <br>I doubt that the idea of evil can be killed by anyone in the berserk universe. <br> kill the God Hand <br>I think that wouldn't make any difference, because they only give out contracts and feed of people's suffering. <br><br>But I honestly don't have any idea how things with the different realities stand, after SK fucked over the fabric of reality.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think Skully did it intentionally?</br>  s-soon?  <br>An argument in favour of SK doing it on purpose is that it makes the God Hand more vulnerable, seeing as they are real now. But I always thoguht that he just messed up royally, and didn't give a second thought to it because that was the way it was supposed to happen, or so.</br>  How long have we been on the boat again?     <br>It really was 10 years? Damn.</br>  <br>eight years</br>  <br>how about you just google it</br>  <br>We got on in 2007, so yeah, eight years. We should start recounting what happened in that time frame.<br><br> JoJo got animated and is now up to the end of Part 3 </br></br></br>  <br><br>The economy collapsed. Again.</br></br>  <br>Moot died.</br>  <br>Farmland Saga started and ended.</br>  <br>nearly 6<br>not 8</br></br>  <br>2009</br>  So, what can we expect? Elfhelm? Boat? Falconia?  <br>you fucking wish. They get on the boat on volume 32. That was published in japan in 2007.</br>  <br/>  <br>Not sure he's an apostle.</br>  <br><br>Ah shit you're right sorry<br>I read the english release date not the Jap one<br><br>So when do you think the new chapter will be translated then? I hope not too long cos I cant read moon</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 days maybe.<br>I mean Berserk fans are fucking eager as shit now and are probably ready to translate as fast as they can but 100 pages take time.</br></br>  <br>Just look at the pictures.</br>  <br>It's not 100 new pages.<br>It is one new chapter and four reprinted chapters.</br></br>  <br>Provided we get scans too<br>I wish Dark Horse would release individual chapters instead of just the volumes</br></br>   that thread <br> full of people who were all underage when Guts jumped on that ship <br> Now old and bitter seasoned anon' who lived through countless world crisis </br></br>  <br><br>guys, it just hit me<br><br> Iwata died never finishing Berserk <br><br>I-I just want to finish Berserk or at least HxH before I die ;_;</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> or at least HxH </br>  <br>He is</br>  i should reread Berserk.  <br>Maybe there is an actual god besides the idea of evil</br>  ;_;  <br> moon in the exact same part of the cycle too <br>Subtle</br></br>  <br>How do we know that he is getting off the boat?</br>  <br>Some things never change... &lt;/3</br>  <br><br>I'd laugh if the monthly ongoing was just a Rock Lee's springtime of youth style gag strip.<br><br>Every month, 4 of the msot insanely detailed panels in 4koma history.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What breaks my heart the most is whenever Miura foreshadows stuff he doesn't fuck around<br>Guts is cursed to feel loss over and over again<br>I just know the new party is gunna die ;_;</br></br></br></br>  <br> I just know the new party is gunna die <br><br>no shit, they still have a bejelit with them. There's no way in hell that's leading up to something good.</br></br></br>  <br>I dont think any other story has hit me as hard as Berserk has<br>Fighting off the tears in some of these flashback scenes man..</br></br>  <br>yeah I agree, some scenes fucking killed me. Like this one for example.</br>  <br>The whole party will die because he seems to be getting suspiciously happy. It wouldn't be Berserk if they didn't all suddenly get raped and eaten.</br>  <br><br>So who's going to be the man of the hour when shit hits the fan?<br>Is Farnese going to sacrifice Serpico and her brother to become an apostle when things get desperate?<br>I couldn't see Serpico using it because he only seems to care about Farnese, and he'd only ever use it for Farnese. Hence, it wouldn't make much sense to me if he used it</br></br></br></br>  <br>schierke. I have a feeling she will go batshit insane on elf harem island. Either her or Farnese.</br>  <br>what if the one who uses it is  Guts </br>  <br>Obviously Farnese will be burnt as a witch for the irony factor.</br>  <br>not possible because sacrifices cannot use bejelits</br>  <br>What? How do you know?<br>Slan asked Guts to make a sacrifice</br></br>  <br>I don't remember that rule.</br>  <br>I think the misconception comes from the fact that "You cannot sacrifice someone who has already been sacrificed" came up already. Remember the Count trying to sacrifice Guts?</br>  <br><br>I may be misremembering things, it's been a shitton of time since I last read Berserk, but I was under the impression that marked ones couldn't sacrifice others to become apostles.  Time for a reread </br></br>  <br> casca gets her memory back <br> she kills herself from the pain of remembering  <br> guts becomes consumed with rage <br> sacrifices his friends to get revenge on griffith <br><br>damn that shit is dark</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What if the boat turns around?</br>  <br> Casca fell off the boat again! Quick do a U-turn <br> the boat then gets pulled into a strong current and they end up at Medusa Island </br></br>    <br>Maybe it does but I hope we don't follow it.<br><br>although to be honest at this point I want to see it smashed into a million pieces.</br></br></br>  <br> Griffith kills new party guts really likes <br> goes batshit insane <br> sacrifices casca for revenge <br> defeats griffith <br> kills everyone and goes crazy from regret </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why do people believe this? There are three things that clearly speak against it:<br>1) If he became an apostle he could not attack griffith, because Apostles bow to the God Hand<br>2) More than once in the story Guts emphasizes that he is human and will never become an abomination like the apostles.<br>3) The rage mongrel-inner-demon-dog (or whatever) combined with the Berserk armor are what will drive him beyond his limits. <br><br>SK even calls him struggler. So why would he be a struggler if he gives in?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can wish for anything you want though right?<br>If he wishes to kill Griffith,  perhaps he will take his place as a member of the God Hand <br><br>That would be a fucking depressing ending</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only satisfying way this can end.</br>  <br>that doesn't really make sense, we have no indications that killing a God Hand member would make you a successor. Guts would not accept it, and if that were a thing you cannot decide then Skull Knight would be risking to take Void's place every time he tries to fuck him up</br>  <br>He can't take his place as a God Hand, because that would require an Emperor's Egg/Behelith, another Eclipse and 300+odd years to happne (I don't remember the correct timespan between those eclipses).</br>  I really want a bittersweet ending. If it is just nothing but depressing then I don't think it would have much of an impact on me.  <br>I cant see him sacrificing Casca, everything he's doing right now is for Casca, he even gave up on the whole revenge thing just because he didnt want to abandon her.<br><br>The other companions though.. If he gets pushed and the beast takes over, who knows what hes capable of.<br><br><br><br>Like I said, if he suffers loss again I doubt his mental state will recover again. He went slightly crazy after the Eclipse, he's recovered now more or less but if something of that magnitude were to happen again who knows what he will do. Remember the inner beast isn't the armor, its Guts' alt personality.<br><br>Well its all just meta speculation at the moment</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  The real badass ending would be a tragic ending where Guts dies like a bitch and Griffith wins because the rules of the world permit it. Fuck the underdog.<br><br>Griffith is a goddamn DIVINITY now, Be it nice or not you gotta accept that.</br></br>  <br><br>Then what about SK/Geiserich? He isn't a Apostle or God Hand, but can possible kill a God Hand member. Remember when that torch fell into the hole in that tower and droped on a floor full of skullheads with the brandmark on their foreheads? Maybe Void sacrificed a lot of people and geiserich was one of them. Then he survived like Guts and is on his revenge trip, thus became wiser. Maybe thats Guts fate as wel..</br></br>  <br>this was a good thread, fuck off with the shitposting</br>  <br><br><br>no he has a point, even Skull King was not able to dent Griffith. Skull King had 1000 years of experience on him too</br></br></br>  <br>If I'm remembering right, the last chapter we got was like a week before Fuuka happened, right? What if Seo's plotting another coincidental surprise?</br>  What about zodd? He doesnt seem so strong compared to guts now.  <br>I would like that. I love Guts, I think Griffith is a fucking bastard (as entertaining as he is, and I like him even now), but I have a thing for these hopeless endings.</br>  <br>But if guts ends up like skull knight who does the skull knight end up as? They would have to kill him off and have Guts slowly turn into someone like him.<br><br> guts + griffith = SK + void <br><br>seems super likely. INB4 SK dies and we go through 300 manga years waiting for guts to take his place. Something something endless cycle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, what's your point? Following this argument, you agree that Guts is more likely to become an undead warrior like SK. He might not be human anymore then. But he still is no abomination like an apostle, because he never literally sacrificed his humanity for his desire, like all apostles did. There is a difference between becoming a rage-fueled undead warrior who fights until barely human anymore for the fullfillment of his desire, and someone who cast away his humanity and forsook other people in order to gain what he wants.</br>  <br>Guts can fuck zodd up the ass by now, esp if he has his "power of friendship party bonus" keeping him from losing his shit to the armor.</br>  <br> that shit is dark <br>How boring. You really expect Casca to be that weak? Or for Guts to turn that insane and to randomly sacrifice his friends?<br><br>Did we even read the same Berserk?<br><br><br>Guts will never die.<br><br> Griffith is divinity <br>lel, no he isn't. Just a bunch of magical beings pretending to be Gods.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Just a bunch of magical beings pretending to be Gods. <br>Well yeah, theres a chapter where Griffith talks to legit god so im pretty sure griffith is just a dude on demon roids</br></br>  <br> idolmaster airs soon <br> more hiatus </br></br>  <br>NOT CANON<br> And was it really god? Wasn't it something like the concept of evil or something? </br></br>  <br>No, Void was already a God Hand when all those people were sacrificed. You'll notice that those skulls were not sacrificed in the same proper way as in an Eclipse. When people get sacrificed in an Eclipse, the brand goes all over the place at random. If you go back and look at the skulls, they are all branded on their forehead, meaning it isn't random and not a sacrifice.<br><br>Skull Knight had to fight all five God Hand members who fell from the sky and destroyed his kingdom.<br><br><br> guts + griffith = SK + void <br>Close but not quite.<br>SK = Guts + Griffith pre Eclipse (the brains of Griffith and the skill level of Guts)<br>Void post eclipse = post Griffith fall from grace (tortured) and became a God Hand member. Void also came back to earth similar to Griffith since SK says ''it's happening again''.<br>Skull Knight = post-Eclipse Guts seeking revenge<br><br><br>The discussion Griffith had with IoE is not canon.<br>However, Griffith meeting IoE however is canon for one panel as Griffith says ''God?''.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  What if the new chapter comes out and they don't actually get off the boat?  <br>wait fuck its not cannon? Did I miss it being retconned or something?</br>  I hope Casca will join griffith when she'll recover her memory .I think she more Griffith than Guts.  <br>We're getting more Griffith.<br><br><br>No, Miura just said it gives away too much of the plot, and it really does.<br>See, if you haven't read that chapter, you don't know much about Causality and what is going on in the world other than everything seems to be attributed to fate.<br>But with that IoE, every action, including every accomplishment done by Guts, will be all minutely controlled and calculated by IoE from the start.<br><br>To me, it makes Guts not as amazing in a disappointing way. It's not about Guts and his will to survive but that his will to survive was calculated somehow and expected in some grand scheme and plan.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>yeah of course she will.</br>  <br>*she prefers more griffith than Guts.</br>  <br>Well, yeah, she obviously wants to be mind broken again.<br> So that Guts can do the boat ride again twice. </br></br>  <br> likes griffith more <br>Clearly she was asking for it, just look at that face</br></br>  <br>If anything, she'll be ddrawn to griffith because he's is to some extent her love child with Guts/partial Rape baby with Griffith</br>  <br>Just you wait, that rape baby is going to rape Casca.<br>And that will be hilarious to watch. That shota moon child raping her mother, that'll be a funny sight.</br></br>  Guts is happy? After all he has been through I really fucking doubt he is happy  <br>No but he's at peace with himself a bit.<br>He grew up.</br></br>  <br>Fuck you man. Just fuck you.</br>  <br><br><br>The only rule stated thus far, was:<br>A former sacrifice (a branded) cannot be offered as a sacrifice again<br>In the counts case, he also couldn't sacrifice Guts because Guts was his enemy, and he called the god hand to save himself, not to kill guts. And only something you love/care about can be sacrificed <br><br>The other thing stated, is that a behelit can only be used by one whos destiny lies in it (predetermined). So if Guts was never mean to use one, then it's unlikely he will ever be able to use it. The behelit will also always return to the masters hand, and will be lost by one who is not meant to use it (why griffith lost the behelit to the torturer, but immediately lost it for it to return to griffith again at the right time).<br><br>This does turn the question, who is the owner of the behelit Guts crew carries? Guts and Puck have been carrying it since the count, which was years ago I believe. Meaning it's possible someone in Guts party will have the opportunity to use it eventually, or it could be that Guts party will lose it when the time is right (like if they suddenly lost it when returning to falconia, as it's master could be someone unrelated).<br><br>I feel pretty luck, I started re-reading Berserk again a couple weeks ago. Then got the news of it returning just as I was finishing it. Now the story is clear in my mind again. Looking forward to it, hope we get a steady stream of releases at least for a while. AT LEAST UNTIL WE GET TO AND OFF ELF ISLE.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That can't happen. Void stated when they met that Guts was not fated to become one. And lady tits mentioned she would have loved if Guts could have become a God Hand member, but fate was against that.</br>  <br>And Eren still hasn't found the basement.</br>  <br>No contest yes</br>  Can we talk about how they fucked up the first episode?  No because the first episode was pretty good.  <br>There's 4 girls at the start of the anime.<br>3 in the manga.<br>Do the math.</br></br></br>  <br> Hurr <br>They'll just do the pre-Miki stuff as a flashback arc. Nothing she did in the first episode affects the story in any way.</br></br>  <br>Because most of the first episode is told from the perspective of the crazy chick who sees dead people dumbass, notice how that 4th girl only ever spoke to her, wasn't acknowledged by the other two, wasn't seen when it showed what was really going on and had her fucking gravestone on the roof?</br>  This chapter was horrible, they ruined Miki with the dog bullshit.  <br> wasn't acknowledged by the other two <br>Shovel acknowledged her<br>"Ooh-ra?", remember?<br><br>Also the dog was dead before they met Mii-kun</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to repopulate the earth with shovel.  If you want to blame someone, blame the manga's author  <br>It was a good episode. Yeah, it was different from the manga but it was still good.</br>  <br>Are you implying Miki's dead? Because if so, pic related.</br>  <br> 4girl  <br> death <br>anime fag pls go</br></br></br>  that shit was amusing<br><br>at first i thought these girls were a bunch of orphan hobos because they lived at school, but then the Shymalan Twist kicked in</br></br>  <br><br>Eh next episode is called memories so they are probably going to revisit pre-Mii life when Megune was still around. Albeit a bit rushed. The only part they really fucked up on though was the dog.</br></br>  Did anyone else notice this?  First episode got more than 720k views on niconico. That's even more than the first UBW episode.  <br> didn't even have a mention of the presence line </br>  Manga spoiler incoming. I just ate up all the current chapters (if there's no more than 36, at least) and I'm wondering:<br> Is the new girl Rii-chan's delusion? Considering Yuki isn't in the imouto spot anymore, she has really started losing it lately.<br>They go into the building, nothing but zombies, Yuki leaves a Teddy bear. Later at night, she goes in alone and comes out coincidentally with a young girl they somehow hadn't seen at first but also features some strange "bear ears". Also, notice the girls' reaction. The only thing that's making me doubt is Yuki seeing the girl immediately.</br> </br>  <br><br>It's not her grave though.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Megu is a good christian girl</br>  <br> She's most likely a delusion, yes.<br>It's way too convenient for her to find her like that, and only Yuki, who we know is bullshitting her own delusion for reasons, is interacting with the imouto<br>In chapter 37 and 38, the other two girls don't actually interact with her, either, and they seem to be discussing her, most likely because they're wondering how to go about things now that Rii's fucking psycho too</br></br> </br>  <br>If you please, can I get a link to the latest chapters. I don't care if it's raw.</br>  <br>http://marumaru.in/b/manga/336<br>Here you go</br></br>  <br>He said raw not gook scans.</br>  <br> he thinks there are raws </br>  <br><br>What's the fucking difference?</br></br>  <br>I can read glorious Nippongese but not shitty ugly dogeater scribbles.</br>  <br> I haven't read the manga </br>  <br> Imouto is also specifically omitted in the scene where the three girls are watching them climbing back over the wall, and there's part of the window blocking the exact sliver of the panel where she would be standing when she's playing with Rii and Yuka <br><br>I accidentally typed "Yura" who would be entertaining in a zombie apocalypse too.</br></br></br>  Best girl coming through.  <br> those comments <br> "is that Komoe-sensei" </br></br>  <br>I'll say it again but all girls are best girls.</br>  <br>Yes is it. It is Megu-nee's grave in the manga. Megu-nee is dead, not Miki.</br>  <br>Will it sell?</br>  <br>If they fix the shit that was episode 1 sure.<br>I hope sells well.</br></br>  <br>If they are going to end it with graduation, they will skip a buttload of content. First episode was a single manga chapter.<br><br>Thing is, if there is a second season soon because good sales, they can't really go back to adapt those bits if the graduation already happened.</br></br></br>  <br> end it with graduation <br>I think they'll end it on the episode of Yuki's breakdown, where it says the same things the first chapter said, like "Lately, I love school"<br>Do we know if this is just going to be 12 eps or if it's going to be more?</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, that's a perfect ending. Crying on Mii-kun's bosom after the same monologue.<br><br>Most likely 12, they would never take chances with a series like this.</br></br></br>  <br> perfect ending <br>Eh. Perfect way to end the penultimate episode, yes, but the graduation would make for a much better ending.</br></br>  <br> Most likely 12, they would never take chances with a series like this. <br>and is fucking sad<br>the industry will do countless of moeshit but they don't give a fuck about this.</br></br></br>  Who the fuck thought the dog was a good idea?  <br>I think it already got people's interest in the manga so the adaptation did its job. Sales of the anime depend if the quality of the show stays consistent.</br>  <br>I fucking hate goofy dogs and bratty kids with the main cast in every show ever.</br>  <br> It was different from the manga therefore it's shit. <br>It was a really good episode. One of the best 1st episodes in a while even. I heard even the mangaka is working with them to fix the earlier chapters mistakes.</br></br>  <br>He didn't say it was shit, can you read? He just said they fucked it up, and I'd be inclined to agree. 20 minutes of boring shit so you can reveal the twist in the last two minutes isn't that great. With the manga I was interested enough to keep reading through chapter one, but when I watched the anime, even though I knew what was going to happen, I considered just stopping and waiting until next weeks, because holy fuck was it boring.</br>  There are like 4 threads up, which one is the main one?  <br>Abusive tsunderes that complete the cycle of tsun to dere within the first few episodes are worse.</br>  <br>But going straight away into the thick of it isn't great either. Having you care a bit more for everyone before hitting you with the twist was a great decision in my books. If anything that can be said negativily about the episode is the lack of animation. It showed that they can't animate anything with the kind of the heads popping to talk.</br>  <br>Main threads don't exist. Post in the thread or threads you want to.</br>  <br><br>By main thread, I mean thread where the majority of people who want to discuss the show are discussing it. Not "officially ordained thread"</br></br>  <br><br>There probably won't be a season 2, so they are jamming everything into 12 episodes just to sell the manga.</br></br>  <br> But going straight away into the thick of it isn't great either. <br>The manga didn't do that either, and I feel like the pacing of the manga was better.<br> Having you care a bit more <br>It did a terrible job of making the viewer care, in my opinion. The entirety of the episode was based around Taroumaru, so unless they plan to make him heroically die or something, I don't see the point, because he was already DOA in the manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a problem when OP doesn't use Gakkou Gurashi in his post. Most people use CTRL+F.</br>  <br>you forgot this one.</br>  <br>The pacing was so much better in the manga.<br>Also they are going to use the dog for shocking or something.<br>When the dog was only a little flashback.</br></br></br>  <br> is <br><br>Also, considering how much those faggots who post their reaction to the episode miss so much, I'm not surprised how a lot of people didn't start suspecting something was off before the reveal.</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of the manga. How the hell did the  pilot get infected? </br>  <br> Also they are going to use the dog for shocking or something. <br>I really hope they don't do that. The manga lacked shock value, rather, it keeps you on the edge all the time, which I believe is better.</br></br>  <br>May have been infected prior to flying if Randall Corp/the elevens' government is severely undermanned as a result of the infection. May have been bitten by someone who was on the chopper as well who turned. It's implied that he was infected, was trying to take the medicine before he turned, failed, lost control, and crashed.</br>  <br>He probably was infected for a while, but the government is lacking manpower and has the medicine.<br><br>He probably lost control when it was time for his next shot of the medicine.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If he was infected all along and he needed another shot, that means that the vaccine probably works only temporarily on people, who are infected. Which would mean that Kurumi will probably need another shot soon.</br></br>  <br><br>Did they take any syringes from Radio-chan's place? I can't recall.</br></br>  That fucking dog.  <br>The same thing happened to Radio-chan. Shovel already has one foot in the grave.</br>  <br>It was never mentioned what they took except for the car keys.<br> RIP Radio-chan. ;_; </br></br>  <br> animeonlyfags </br>  <br> The same thing happened to Radio-chan. <br>I guess that would also imply that she ran out of shots to stop the infection from spreading.<br> Shovel already has one foot in the grave. <br>I'll be hoping for a miracle.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br> Don't remember the episode but one girl told Shovel chan that his skin is cold  <br>get ready for more despair.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Radio-chan probably died because she ran out of medicine.<br>She was infected for a while and if I remember correctly she was coughing in the last broadcast the girls heard from the car.<br><br> Did they take any syringes from Radio-chan's place?  <br>There probably weren't any left, but even if there still were some - The girls probably don't know that the medicine is a temporary suppressant and that Kurumi is going to need another shot of the medicine soon.<br><br>The point when Kurumi realizes that she isn't healed and will need regular shots of the medicine to not turn into a zombie might be the time we'll see the first mental breakdown from Kurumi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> you forgot the top right image in your post <br>What dude</br></br>  <br>What are the odds this gets something similar to haruhi broadcast order?</br>  <br> episode <br>dam , chapter<br>the point is<br> she's ded </br></br></br></br>  <br> episode <br>Anon, you silly goose, you.</br></br>  Friendly reminder that radio girl being dead is a red herring.  <br> his <br>Words can not express how OK I would be with this</br></br>  <br>   his skin is cold <br>Anon, these boy jokes are going too far.</br></br>  <br><br> Implying she won't become a zombie hybrid <br><br>She was shown testing her abilities, the zombies notice her less now.<br><br>Also, nice trips.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>This guy draws thighs as good as fatalpulse.

I don't have the manga on my laptop so I can't post the page.</br>  <br>Wearing a helmet protects you if your helicoter explodes</br>  <br>Do you got the rest of these?</br>  <br>for you? no.</br>  <br> the zombies notice her less now. <br>I went back and looked at that page and fuck, I didn't notice that back when I was reading. Time to panic.</br></br>  <br>I didn't remember that. <br>In that case it might be possible that he didn't turn yet and died in the crash.<br>If corpses still turn he might have turned at a later time, after Kurumi took the case.</br></br></br>  <br>Her CQC tactical espionage skills are being developed, she just lowered her body temperature so infrared won't pick her.</br>  http://swiffarchive.com/swf/Yare%20<wbr>Yare%20Daze.swf</wbr>  <br>Her body is cold and the zombies don't attack her unless she shouts at them. That probably means that ethe zombies see her as one of them.<br>She's half-undead at this point.</br></br>  <br> fatalpulse could be working on GG doujins as we speak </br>  <br>There's one of each girl except Yuki, I think.</br>  the dog was a mistake  <br>see </br>  <br>Scratch that, Yuki's would probably be volume 1's special cover, which no one has scanned yet.</br>  <br>Damn it, I knew I was missing one aside from zombie-sensei.</br>  Do the inverted uniform colors actually mean anything or is it just some bored person?  <br>Use your head.</br>  <br>Yuki's their senpai, Ledouche.</br>  <br>He isn't Ippo.</br>  <br>I done have told you guys she's gonna end up like  Murphy in Z Nation </br>  <br>I can't wait to see Yuki abused<br>All of them, really, but especially Yuki<br><br>And I want to see Shovel loved tenderly, because I like her a lot, and not just for cute</br></br></br></br>  <br> She's half-undead at this point. <br>Well shit, my optimism's pretty low now, though I still hope for some ass pull that there will be a cure or something, that will turn her back to normal again.</br></br>  <br>Seriously? That was really THE focus point of the chapter. Walking by zombies unnoticed is really something. It's obvious Kurumi has only stopped the transformation process. She's going to need another shot soon. Do they actually have another syringe in the case?</br>  <br> but especially Yuki <br> Doesn't know the purpose of Yuki <br>Read the manga.<br>She's just pretending.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Why the fuck did he even crash in the first place? He pulled out a syringe then it crashed? I didn't understand that.</br></br></br>  <br>I know<br>But she's super cute and trying her best to be optimistic and smiling a lot<br>I want to see her break down completely, because she's cute</br></br></br>  I assumed Kurumi was taking doses of it regularly  <br>I asked the same, and this anon's response was pretty good</br>  <br> just pretending <br>Why do people keep saying this?<br>You really think she had been merely pretending to be delusional for everyone's sake?</br></br></br>  <br>Transformation got the better of him the moment he tried to take the shot. That's why he crumpled the map, crushed the syringe he wanted to inject himself with and went full zombie.</br>  <br><br>Didnt you notice how his retard zombie spasms had him crushing everything, including the syringe? He was fucked at that point.</br></br>  <br>Mikifags shitting up the threads</br>  <br><br>How did he even become infected though?</br></br>  <br>She's clearly pretending at this point<br>She wasn't at the start, but ever since they took shelter in the disaster room, she's been fairly lucid</br></br>  <br>At that point, she's no longer fully delusional. You can see that by how grown up she acts, which is the reason why Rii is going insane due to her memories of her real imouto.</br>  <br> That was really THE focus point of the chapter. <br>Yeah, I kinda understand it now. I guess I should re-read the manga, just in case I missed anything else.  My lack of sleep is really gets to me sometimes. <br><br><br>He crushed the syringe in his hand. The infection was getting to him, so he started to lose control over his actions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My amazing deduction skills tell me that he probably got bit</br>  <br>Holy shit read the thread fucking thread, this was already asked and discussed.</br>  <br>Read the manga</br>  <br>I did read the manga. She wasn't pretending before chapter 29. Afterwards, yes, but not before.</br>  <br>How did he get fucking bit while in a helicopter? If he got bit before getting in the helicopter, why didn't he use the syringe before FUCKING GETTING IN A VEHICLE WHILE INFECTED FOR FUCK'S SAKE.</br>  <br>That's not necessarily pretending<br>They could have sold that to her as some sort of ritual the club does for reasons<br>I don't know what those reasons would be, but that thing's been there for a long time, and it would be weird for them not to have sugarcoated the explanation of it to her</br></br></br>  <br>You are a special kind of stupid.</br>  <br>That's where the theory that the medicine becomes less effective over time. For all we know, their last helicopter pilot could have been on the juice for so long that he needed to shoot up every twenty minutes.</br>  <br><br>The syringe was loaded with sedatives, that might be why he crashed too.</br></br>  <br>So we're still left in the dark and we don't really know the circumstances that led him to crash. Okay, I can accept that. Doesn't explain why fuckers like  are acting so colon crucified if it's supposed to be an ambiguous situation in the first place though.</br>  <br>This is why we can't have nice threads on /a/. Read </br>  <br> Doesn't explain why fuckers like (You) are acting so colon crucified if it's supposed to be an ambiguous situation in the first place though. <br>Because everything you've asked has already be discussed in this short thread you blind nigger.</br></br>  <br>Doesn't help when you/ are so fucking dense that you have to have the same thing repeated to you several times over just so you can get it through your/their thick skull.</br>  <br><br>Wow, looks like the memers are getting angry for some reason. Are you guys having problems? Face it, it was poorly conveyed in the manga so you're probably going to get more questions about it as more and more people read the manga. If you can't handle that then maybe you should just fuck off back to reddit.</br></br>  Pilot-san wasn't spoonfed to you in the manga because you're supposed to figure out together with the girls how the serum and z virus works<br>Dang, people</br>  <br> wants to be spoonfed answers <br> can't be bothered to read the thread to find the answers <br> calls other people reddit <br>I rarely get mad, but god damn anon</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ah, you're one of those. Carry on then.</br>  <br> poorly conveyed <br>Sure, but if you had half a brain, you could make deductions by yourself, like a grown man. Instead you come and ask anons about circumstances that only the mangaka knows about. You really must be dumb. You should follow your own advice and go back to reddit yourself.</br></br>  <br> can't be bothered to read the thread to find the answers <br>I found the answers in this thread to unsatisfactorily answer the question, which is why I pressed you for more. On reddit, you'll never have to answer any questions since all the answers will be upvoted and you apparently hate discussion as well, which is why you belong there. <br><br>Given how this is apparently a point of contension, it was obviously a poorly conveyed scene.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Was pink hair mentally ill, or pretending to be a retard a part of her master plan?</br>  <br>And why the hell do you think random anons over the fucking world would know secret details about the very same thing that you've read with no difference? Do you perhaps believe one of them is friend with the uncle of the cousin of the mangaka? USE. YOUR. BRAIN.</br>  <br><br> The answers I want are not pushed to the top for me. <br> You should go back to reddit <br><br>That's a pretty good one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Not like this </br>  <br> korean </br>  REMOVE DOG  <br>Both probably. She has/had DID, but there were times when she definitely knew what was going on, but kept up the act to benefit her and the groups morale.</br>    <br>He probably got bitten checking out someplace like the elementary school or Radio-chan's shelter.<br>Then got back in the chopper without realizing the bite had punctured his suit, and only realized he needed the syringe when it was too late.</br></br>  <br>Worst "character" of the season.</br>  <br>In a few episodes</br>  <br>Which is why Yuki best girl. I'm going to believe there's a secret anime algorithm that automatically makes all pink-haired girls the best.</br>  Show would be better if the "mad" girl was actually the only somewhat sane one.

Did someone spend half of the series trapped in a well? <br><br>Sasuga American comics.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You didn't watch season 2 of that horrible abortion of a zombie show, I take it</br>  <br>The one and only you missed. It's a sign.</br>  <br><br>No, and I'd like to keep it that way.</br></br>  <br>I really liked this part. Yuki was amazing.</br>  <br>What's wrong with dota?</br>  <br>Her gomen was cutest thing I heard this season.</br>  <br>Trust me, you're making the right choice<br> They spent an episode, or maybe 2 I can't remember, dragging a fat, bloated zombie out of a well because "If we leave it there, we can't drink the water, it'll be infected and bad", which would somehow be solved by just removing the zombie.<br>Anyway, this all ends in them ripping the zombie in half over the well, with the lower half falling back into the well, and the top half being alive and well on the ground next to them, so they kill it.<br><br>The whole second season is trash<br>Actually, the entire show after the first season is trash<br>Season 1 is pretty good though</br></br></br></br></br> </br></br>  <br> the industry will do countless of moeshit but they don't give a fuck about this. <br> using moeshit unironically <br>This is a fucking manga time kirara manga</br></br></br>  <br>first episode was very good, the only thing that I would have changed was something in the beginning to show that the world was fucked up, instead of leaving it at the end as a surprise<br><br>I went in completely blind, and I still thought the reveal was unnecessary, even if it wasnt the intent, it felt like they really wanted it to be shocking, and I think if you're just going to reveal something like that in the first episode, you're better off just putting everyone on the same page right off the bat, even if it was just a quick shot of some fucked up shit, just leave it as something for the audience to keep in mind until the end when you can use it and the reveal together to cement your setting.<br><br> &gt;opinions </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hey now, Shovel is too strong to get mind broken.<br>  She just gets turned into a zombie <br><br>I also still love how her reaction to seeing a guy kill himself is to call him a fucking coward and move on completely unphased.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Actually, the entire show after the first season is trash <br><br> The last season was solid </br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh god, who thought that was a good idea? I'm suddenly glad GG is only one cour, because if it isn't a good adaptation, at least we don't have to suffer for years like TWD comicfags</br></br>  <br>I was talking to someone who hasn't read the manga and they said.<br> this will be anime OF THE SEASON. For sure. I know it. The first episode BLEW MY MIND.  <br>I don't ever want to talk to them again.</br></br></br>  <br>shoveled definitely getting zomb'd, it's unavoidable<br><br>but not until her own mini-arc and some character development, to really hit it home when the time comes</br></br></br>  <br><br>That was one episode. Call it a farm arc if you must.</br></br>  <br><br>I wouldn't say definitely. There's a pretty high chance that there'll just be some asspull and she'll be fine.<br><br> Or at least I hope </br></br></br></br>  <br>Good point, I just wanted to specify the well part, and wasn't entirely sure how to<br>Episode would imply anime, and a chapter or a volume would both be too short to really be the same amount of content</br></br>  <br><br>If I have to deal with people expecting "epik twists" all season I'm going to shoot myself.</br></br>  <br>I hope so to, sure I'd be ashamed because ass pull and all but if she ends up find I would be very happy</br>  <br> I also still love how her reaction to seeing a guy kill himself is to call him a fucking coward and move on completely unphased. <br>That was before she realized the medicine didn't worked and started contemplating the same thing, if only for different reasons.<br><br> The guy killed himself because he was infected. </br></br></br></br>  Why won't you love me, Taroumaru?!  <br> she doesn't exist when they found him <br> this is why he doesn't like her. <br>DP</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well, he wasn't alive at the beginning of the mango either.</br></br>  <br><br> Graduation <br> Miki sees the dog walking back to the school rather than her friend </br></br></br>  The last shot of the show is gonna be   Miki's note to Kei, right?    <br><br>It was also really cute.</br></br>  <br>In the end, it was really daijoubu.</br>  I'm gonna have to either read the manga or avoid these threads, aren't I?  <br>Or wait until it finishes airing.</br>  <br>She is pretty much done for.</br>  I'm pretty interested in how this series does its zombies. They seem to simply be people who are afflicted by a mind-controlling bacteria/virus which heavily rots the skin. People who die before the infection gets to them tend to simply die then and there. Plus the zombies die from various things which would kill a regular human, and probably not a zombie. Not to mention that Megu-nee was going through really deep levels of infection and wandering the school with a  albeit horribly deteriorated  focused mind while heading towards a specific location in order to get away from her beloved students. <br><br>They don't seem like they are actual walking dead, but rather just infected people who are wandering around until they can infect other people.</br></br>  <br>The faggot was implying Miki was dead you dumb shit.</br>  <br>It's just a flesh wound.</br>   Wanting a shot for shot remake of the manga, basically using the panels as the storyboard <br><br>Pants on head retarded. It'd be dull as fuck.</br></br>  <br>The manga art is a thousand times better.</br>  <br>How would it be dull? The manga is great.</br>  What's the most brutal ending you guys can think of? <br><br> Miki never left her compound, all her "friends" are just a hallucination as she spends her days swinging at shadows from her imagination and pretending she has friends who themselves are actually deluded <br><br> Shovel Knight goes full-zambie, bites Miki with Miki committing murder-suicide to protect her friends. Yuuri is still in a state of mental-shielding delusion, while Yuki has to protect her from now on <br><br> Shovel becomes a zombie and they are forced to kill her. Just as they finish her off and enter a government facility, they are told that there was always a miracle cure, they were just being watched for the sake of an experiment, which would conclude as soon as they found the facility <br><br> Everybody dies, holding hands with one another, crying but happy.   It's revealed at the end that the virus is cured by radio frequencies and sound amplifiers, explaining why zombies were drawn to speakers and megaphones moreso than human flesh.  <br> Final chapter is simply Radio-chan cracking a joke over the radio that she thought she was a zombie, but was seemingly mistaken. She continues to talk about how she would keep playing music for any survivors who were hurting, and would stay waiting for anybody who would come to her. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, after watching it, it was alright, the scene where it shows the ruined classroom was pretty good, music was decent too. Miki being introduced in this episode felt natural, anime adaptations tend to do this a lot, skip ahead in the story then explain shit in flashbacks. I don't really care about the dog<br><br>Shovel is still the best girl.</br></br></br>   mfw I got my imouto to read the manga after the episode, and she's now furiously texting me because shovel got bit   <br>How do I unsubscribe?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the outbreak is confined to this one city and it's all just a experiment by the government/corporation. <br>Still have no idea what the pilot's purpose was though.<br><br>It'll end with  all the cast sacrificing themselves to get Yuki a little closer to their goal and the government will find Yuki imagining her friends like nothing happened </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>By fisting yourself</br></br>  <br> showing yuri shows to your little sister <br>Unless you're a grill yourself you're an ultra faggot.</br></br>  <br><br>Yuri shitposter, you don't seem like you really have anything special in your shitposts.

It's not like their bodies suddenly become tougher because they are zombies.<br><br> Megu-nee  <br>While I really want to write off her resistance to the infection as an exception, I'll agree with you on that one.<br><br> just infected people who are wandering around until they can infect other people <br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Someone's going to be translating 36 and 37 from the gook scans soon in the other thread:<br/>  <br>They went full moe to make the reveal more dramatic, and imo it was for the best. How else are you going to fill the first episode if the twist can't happen until minute 18?</br>  <br>What chapter is that? I don't remember it at all.</br>  <br>Mall chapter, before they find Miki.<br><br>I wonder how much of the SoL scenes we'll get.<br>Will the entire sports festival make it?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was pretty boring, so I hope not.<br><br>I hope they just keep the contrast between the SoL and the survival and suffering, because that's what makes the series interesitng, if they just show a lot of SoL it'll end up being boring.</br></br></br>  <br> yuri <br>Fuck off to </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128009963 <br>anon take this series in your mind as a deconstruction of the SoL genre and you can enjoy this.</br>  <br>I am not mentally prepared for what's going to happen to the shovel girl</br>  <br>This whole scene really made me think. To what extent does Yuki know whats going on? Shes clearly aware of the immediate danger while simultaneously holding onto her delusions.<br><br>How long do you guys suppose until shes face to face with a zombie and has to actually deal with it?</br></br></br>  <br>No shit sherlock!</br>  <br><br>I think she's pretty lucid by now. She was forgetting to ask Megu-nee's permission for things.</br></br>  <br>I wonder how long until we see the outside world from her eyes.</br>  <br>Literally the chapter after that happened<br><br>She's been coming back to reality since Kurumi was bit, and after the fire she's pretty much sane. The latest chapters even imply that she doesn't see Megu-nee anymore, while Yuri is starting too.</br></br></br>  <br> Only School-Live and Highschool of the dead have done Romero style zombies right </br>  Chapter 36 in the other thread, if anyone is still here.  <br>I dont think that really counts since it was a crawler. She could've walked away as easily ash she bashed it's head in with a mop. I'm talking more like shes alone with 1 other person whos passed out and suddenly zombies come out of no where or something like that.</br>  <br>  </br>  <br>link</br>  <br><br>Literally look above you</br></br>  <br> you will never mate with Yuki </br>  <br>These are not romero style zombies. You have to be alive and bit to be infected and turn.</br>  <br>We actually don't know that for sure since we haven't see a dead person who isn't a zombie.</br>  <br>The guy who hanged himself.</br>  <br><br>Also, Romero zombies have to die before they can turn, but, as we've seen with the existence of the medicine and being able to change back, GG zombies have to be alive.</br></br>  <br>Of course it counts. You gotta trust the author's storytelling capacity a bit here, but the way that whole sequence was done was clearly meant to be a major point in her character arc. Couple the situation itself with Yuki's reaction, including the repeat of the initial monologue that introduced us to the delusions in the first place and her running through the school while seeing its actual state and then breaking down. If this manga wants to have good writing that part -has- to be the point where she changes, perhaps not 100% but majorly. At the very least I'm pretty sure she can act normal now, she just keeps the delusion facade up because reasons and also that's her personality anyway.</br>  If Shovel dies I'll go and get a job.  <br>You realize that your neck snaps when you hang yourself right?</br>  <br>Yeah, but the brain is intact.</br>  <br>But it's not attached to the rest of body. It's the same as decapitation.</br>  <br>Can you point out where does Yuuri start to see Megu-nee? So far I have been seeing the girls asking Yuki to 'confirm' with Megu-nee as part of their usual practice.</br>  <br>Rii saw megu's silhouette in the smoke</br>  <br>I thought the one who saw Megu-nee was Yuki? If I remember right, Yuki was the one who pointed the right direction and 'thanked' Megu-nee later.</br>  What do you see in her eye?  <br><br>Death</br></br>  <br>In chapter 32 I think, Yuuri talks about Megu-nee as if she's still alive. And again later she asks if it's okay to take the RV without asking Megu-nee about abandoning her car.</br>  <br>salvation</br>    <br>She never sees Megu-nee. Yuuris just using the fact that Yuki acts as if she can see Megu to get Yuki out of the room.</br>  I can't wait until we hear Yuki say, "Megu-nee is dead!" directly from her mouth. Probably to Yuuri.  Time for dank meme.<br><br>"Megu-nee is dead. She's not here anymore! But on my back, and in my heart, she lives on in me! "<br><br>"Digging a hole to piece the zombies! Even if that hole becomes my grave, as long as I break through, I shall be victorious! Who the hell do you think I am?! I'm Kurumi ! I'm not my teacher Megu-nee! I am myself! Kurumi the digger!"</br></br></br></br>  <br>What I don't get is, at least in the manga, sometimes she has really long hair and other times it's just shoulder-length. Why is that?</br>  <br/>  Reminder<br><br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/112999<wbr>146/#113004805</wbr></br></br>  <br><br><br>Continuing from the other thread.</br></br></br>  When does chapter 38 come out?  <br>Two weeks, 24th to be precise.</br>    <br>Just looked back and found this.</br>    <br>I want to punch that face.</br>  <br>I want to irrumate that face.</br>  <br>Yuki and Yuuri have similar symptoms but opposite causes.<br>Yuki was in a familiar and relatively safe place, so when she broke she could go 'safe-mode'. In her heart she knows what's happening but her mind could just block everything out and feed her happy thoughts. Now that things are happening and they're moving, new things are forcing her to come out of her comfort zone and make her shell really thin. She's relying less on delusions and has stopped making as many excuses. Moving forward will eventually break her shell, and there's going to need to be a lot of support for her when it happens.<br><br>Yuuri was handling it when it was stable, but everything's just piling up now they're moving, uncertainty, fear, responsibility, etc. Her mind can't handle it and her heart is searching for comfort. She'll stabilise after she gets back to a calm environment, cry her eyes out for a while and pull her shit together.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ok, time to polish the previous pages that were done. I'll upload the rest to MEGA or some shit and maybe try to get rid of the watermark on the left of these but no promises on that.</br>  <br>I wouldn't bother with the watermark, this version's going to be replaced next month when Deel comes out with his version anyway.</br>  <br>Alright then, nice to know. I didn't see that update.</br>  <br>Ah I see, it was Yuki who was pointing to the correct path and Yuuri who saw Megu-nee.</br>  <br>The intention is what counts, thanks for you work. Although now that you have the intention, can you do the same, but with chapter 36? Typesetting done in paint is not that pleasant to read.</br>   just caught up with the manga <br> got to read newly translated chapters with /a/  <br>This has been fun. Mii-kun is best girl by the way.</br></br>  <br>Sure, I have time to waste. I might not dump it like this though, it'll probably be apart of the MEGA upload link.</br>  <br>She's competent all round. Has shovel's prowess and Rii's levelheadedness.<br>Truly best grill</br></br>  <br>How do you figure that? All they have to do is stop at where   they leave the school  They can just pick later when there's more chapters.</br>  <br>Good enough. Thanks in advance, much appreciated.</br>  <br>She'll go down the insanity-hole once something happens, just like Rii.</br>  <br>That's when she has to bash shovel's head with her shovel.</br>  <br><br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-ne<wbr>ws/2015/07/11/japanese-fan-discover<wbr>s-interesting-fact-about-school-liv<wbr>e-uniforms</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br> back to normal again. <br>Please don't get my hopes up.</br></br>  <br> She's naturally resistant and will encounter no symptoms other than cold body temperature <br> Randall Corporation has invented a more advanced cure in the past couple of weeks <br><br>What other possibilities, no matter how small, are there?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Mii-kun is best boy <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br> Mii-kun is actually a trap <br> He throws away his crossdressing hobby in order to keep the group of girls sane with his manly aura  <br> they all become part of his harem </br></br></br>  <br> builds a resistance to the infection <br> they can make a vaccine from her and cure people who have already turned into zombies <br>But then they realize they can't save the people that they killed like their teacher and shovel-chan feels immense guilt for killing so many people.</br></br></br>  <br> Implying   this series won't end with Yuki being the only sane one of the group, as the rest lose their minds to various stimulus <br>   Yuuri has already gone off the deep end, and is carrying around a teddy bear she calls her sister <br>   Miki is a trap who is under the distinct impression he's a girl, and as such forgets who he truly is beyond "one of the girls of the Life Club" <br>   Kurumi has been cured, but her deep fears and paranoia lead to her body being clammy and cold, and she will mentally regress to the point where she will become a zombie psychologically rather than biologically, and the infection won't even matter </br></br></br></br>  <br>They were living in agony, near-mindless, but still barely there.

As far as we know those guys wanted to warn them about the university sluts.</br>  <br>Yeah, warning them with spiked bat in hand.</br>  <br>The problem is we don't know the context for the chase. Miki and Kuru just sprint right back with them on their tail, so while they may've just been pursued, there may've been an exchange of words for all we know.</br>  <br>Can be misunderstanding or they thought they were with uni sluts and wanted to chase them away.</br>  http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51374131<br> Hot <br><br><br>Do you want them to go outside their camp without protection?</br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br>W-what is that pink thing below her tail</br>  <br>Well, it's a possibility I guess. <br><br>a) Those uni girls are super pure nice individuals that got expelled by crossbow guy's group <br>b) The bike people are trying to warn the gakkou that the uni girls are evil (Why chase them around with bat anyway? What happen between them and Kurumi and Miki?)<br>c) The bike gang and uni sluts are in cahoot (they immediately leave when the gate is closed, really guys, you can't handle bunch of uni sluts?)<br><br>So see, option c is the most probably choice. I think crossboy gonna save the gakkou in the future. <br><br><br>What else but rape?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Those uni sluts can be more dangerous than it seems.</br>  <br>Option d) Both groups are evil, but aren't working with each other.</br>  <br>e) Both groups are good samaritans but misunderstanding each other</br>  <br>Her second tail</br>  <br>It's the deconstruction of Madoka's Evangelion.</br>  <br>Generic porn dialogue.</br>  <br>I know merely a little bit of moon.

America will come and save them for sure.</br>  <br>reddit or youtube?</br>  <br>As the manga progresses, the girls are going to lose their humanity little by little, I think. It has started with Kurumi becoming a little more zombie, now Rii is becoming crazed (in a much more unstable manner than Yuki) and Miki might end up paying too. Yuki is going to remain the pillar of the group and the others will become more and more dependable on her as time passes, revealing her inner turmoil and forcing herself to fully accept reality.<br><br> Climax is going to have Yuki injured in a car accident and stuck. The girls will have no choice but to leave her in order to find shelter. Last scene will be Yuki's blurred vision of her crying kouhai as they prepare to make sure she does not turn, saying she is proud that the School Live club will be able to continue making group activities without her. </br></br></br>  <br>Because it is completely unlikely that I have been on /a/ for a long time and never heard of this series, right? <br>No, fuck you.<br>Maybe I caught the glimpse of a thread and never gave attention to it, you fucking retard.</br></br></br>  <br>They gonna find a government survivor camp with nice people and cure and everyone will be ok.</br>  <br>Until they get raped by big dick gaijins that came to help Japan.</br>  <br>Might I recommend reading the manga?<br>There's sure to be differences between it and the anime, plus you'll be spoiled massively if you remain here.</br></br>  <br>I thought anti culture died back in 90s</br>  Ok, so here are Chapters 36 &amp; 37 polished with a better font, enjoy: https://mega.co.nz/#F!Y8VXSbpS!t6Sm<wbr>aC0ERNrvxmad7Ieg_g<br><br> Now I need to read and pay attention to it myself. </br></br></wbr>  How long until we get the inevitable "group gets separated" arc?  <br>The group will get separated  when they start dying one by one. </br>  <br> Yuki Uniform match all other students uniform <br>Your feel when you discover that Yuki is the one buried in the roof and the one they see is just an illusion the other two made up to keep them self sane.</br></br>  I give up anons this manga is going to be the cause of my death.  <br>There will be a zombie/human hybrid group that will come along and try to get Kurumi to join them since she's not like those other humans and she doesn't belong with them.

The reveal was better in the anime than in the manga.</br>  <br>Mangafag here.<br>The first episode is actually pretty good. I dont really care about chronological order but what they did was essentially dumped a chapter with Mii-kun introduced and added in even more Yuki imaginary friends.<br>I am sure people complaining about the first ep also complain about Haruhi air order.</br></br></br>  <br>The manga did it well for how long a chapter is and the anime did it well for how long an episode is. Viewing it alone, I have no qualms about the episode, but it's when you know the story in the manga that things get worrying. I have no doubts that the original author being the showrunner for the anime is the reason for this, and I don't doubt that it'll go well, but it's not going to be the manga's story. Miki is there from the start and there's that fucking dog. We'll see how that goes.</br>  <br>I didn't mind the episode on its own, it's just kind of jarring to have events from all over the place in the manga thrown into the first episode. Like the Mii-kun eating habits part.</br>  <br>Is it autistic to think the manga did the window closing better?</br>    <br> The build up for the twist is just completely awful.  <br>How do you know that? You were punching jump 10 seconds five minutes after the OP ended.</br></br>  <br>The scene in manga looked like two girls were closing two windows and it took me a while to realise what was going on. Tha adaptation did a good job abandoning panel concept.</br>  Was there ever a scene with a close up view (blurred ppl so that its not obvious they are human or zombies) of the track club at the fields in anime or manga other than a view from the roof? I think I am confusing myself with the episode 2 preview at the end with Kurumi.  <br>The mangaka's pretty competent at pacing when it comes to the script, at least when build-up and foreshadowing is involved.</br>  <br>Just watch through the episode again.</br>  <br>Have a feeling I will be revisiting this series a fair bit.</br>  <br>I know that I'm going to watch it four times each week with the livewatch and three different subs.</br>  Just caught up with the manga.<br><br>I don't like the university people.</br></br>  <br>My dick loves them though</br>  It has been my life's work trying to find the origins of this image.   lifes work <br> found artist and character name with one mouseclick </br>   Kirino Mosaic is actually called Kiniro Mosaic <br> Ash Ketchup's name is actually Ash Ketchum <br><br>My life has been a lie.</br></br></br>  his name is actually Satoshi, fam  why live   amines are actually chemicals and not chinese cartoons   <br> kirino mosaic <br>I called it that too until I learned the moon runes</br></br>  Kirino hijack!  <br>I learned moonrunes and still occasionally mix the name until I pay attention.</br>  <br> Ash Ketchup <br>What the fuck?</br></br>  <br> mangos are fruits </br>  <br> Kirino Mosaic is actually called Kiniro Mosaic <br>きんいろモザイク<br> Ash Ketchup's name is actually Ash Ketchum <br>サトシ<br><br>You tried.

It's just a quick of saying 3 different vowels together as one syllable. 2 vowel sounds get lumped together while the 3rd dangles, so it ends up either as "yao ii" or "yaa oi".

How is it needless if their deaths fueled MC's desire to wipe out the vampires?</br></br></br>  Violence needs a purpose and a reason.<br>Unnecessary acts of violence like breaking someone's neck just for the sake of it is edgy.</br>  <br>Acts of violence for the purpose of establishing a character's personality or setting the general tone of the setting have a purpose, however. I'd say 'edgy' becomes an appropriate description when the author feels the need to continuously and gratuitously remind the audience about how grim and dark the story and characters are.</br>  <br> Any examples that come to mind? Rarely does death occur without reason. <br>Not him, but Akame ga Kill comes to mind. It's a guilty pleasure of mine, but the deaths in Akame ga Kill are only there to show that anyone can die at any moment, and are often needleslly gratuitous. <br><br>And then there's Meet Dog, which had literally zero influence on the rest of the story.

Cannot comment on the "Meet Dog", is it part of the manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>damn clown</br>  <br> edgy <br>adjective US /ˈedʒ·i/<br>› nervous or easily upset:<br>He paced the hallway looking edgy and impatient.<br><br>Hmm.<br>I don't get it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Cannot comment on the "Meet Dog", is it part of the manga? <br>It is. In case you want spoilers  three little girls who never show up in the series again get raped by a dog. Two of them don't survive it, the third one hires Night Raid to slaughter the gang that organized this dog-rape. By the end of the comic the last remaining girl dies knowing that her two friends are avenged. </br></br>  <br>That does sound pretty gruesome, especially if this "dog" actually decides to do it out of nowhere. If it's just there as an episodic thing, with no real influence in the long run, I don't even know what to say.</br>  <br><br>The handling of death and violence.<br><br>If a character acts like killing people and being violent is cool then he is edgy.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Edgy - adj. Something that makes /a/nons feel like they are deep, unique, and bad ass for liking said thing.</br>  <br>That's full-on gore. Edgy is more like Kirito wearing only black clothing and being "The Black Swordsman".</br>  <br>But the things /a/ calls edgy, like, say, the anime in OP's pic, are generally ones people like because they're fun, without feeling deep in the least for liking them. That definition doesn't really work.</br>  <br>That's just you hating on the mental image of someone watching a show. No one says the likes of "for mature people like myself" seriously anymore.</br>  Seems like we have to define what everyone means when he says edgy. <br>I think the very definition of edgy is basically found in this picture and it should serve as basic outline of what edgy is.</br>  <br>Edgy just seemed like a 'le meme' fags way of saying Emo shit</br>  <br>Wow you'the so edgy</br>  <br>bio: tatsumi was born with a special power. he was stronger than all his classmates in the empire fighting academy. he served in the empire military fighting night raid and in the final battel against night raid they were fighting and night raid turned him to the darkness and tatsumi turned against aria and killed her. he lost part of his eye in that battle which is why it looks like that, pls stop PMing me askin me why that's why. also his smile isnt innocent fuck you esdeath everyone knos ur a fuckin asspull scammer fagot.<br><br>likes: hurtin people, bein badass, motorcycles, nine inch nails (the band), killing, death, punk rock, jinco jeans, skulls, darkness, hot gurls who are sluts with small boobies, nine inch nails (on foot), evil smiles, red (cool kind not akame kind)<br><br>dislikse: niceness, happiness, levis, dr. stylish from the jaegers fuck you stylish stop showing evryone my fuckin secret hideout you peace of shit, trent razner, short nails, esdeath (megga ass-faggot), sunshine, life, my dad, football<br><br>@blood_armor_boi84</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hitler nailed it.</br>  <br> blood_skull_boi84 <br><br>Does that mean the guy who made this is 31?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Example: "I'm an edgy faggot."</br></br></br>     "edgy" is an insult <br>HAHAHA SINCE WHEN<br>I love edgy things. They're entertaining. Edginess is an ideal.</br></br>    <br>People enjoying hurting/abusing/killing others. Also gratuitous depictions of violent acts.</br>  The way /a/ uses edgy is when the portrayal of such violence is not only shallow, but also glorified for a coolness factor in a way that appeals to teenagers who think they're the shit for watching it.<br><br>However, the actual definition of edgy doesn't really have to be negative. It literally just means pushing boundaries.</br></br>  <br>What did you think of Gangsta's first episode?</br>  <br>It's edgy if it's not moeshit</br>  <br>I never watched it simply because I didn't think it would appeal to me.</br>  <br>This.</br>  So from what I gather:<br><br>A show is edgy if it treats violence and death superficially.<br><br>A person is edgy if he is autistic enough to find a cool factor in violence and death done with or without a reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, this guy is right </br>  <br>Now that post's what I'd call edgy</br>  <br>Only one of them gets raped by the dog.<br><br>I think one has her legs broken and the other has her eyes gouged out.</br></br></br>  <br> A show is edgy if it treats violence and death superficially. <br>It has a lot to do with how it is portrayed. Any silly action movie could meet that definition, but they're not all "edgy". I would consider the weight important. An important part of "edgy" is about trying to make the viewer take it seriously even when it is entirely superficial.</br></br>  <br>Pretty sure Kirito has Asperger's syndrome so you can put him in the second catergory.</br>  You just need an autistic faggot (everyone in /a/) to hate a show for it to be labeled as edgy.  <br>To me, it's excessive violence, brooding, and or gore that has no purpose other than to make a character look cool or for shock value. Bonus points if it's all done like it's no big deal. Not as much if the scene actually has weight.</br>  <br> "edgy" is about trying to make the viewer take it seriously even when it is entirely superficial <br><br>Never seen it put like this. If a bomb goes, kills some background bystanders and the show is trying to emphasize the loss, it's edgy?</br></br></br>  <br>The important point is that it is superficial. Showing the consequences of actions in realistic manner is not what I would consider superficial and thus not edgy.<br><br>I'm just trying to grasp at what makes a silly action movie different than something actually edgy, because that guy's definition doesn't address it.</br></br></br>  <br>If an action movie would to be turned into an anime, it would be called edgy. <br><br>Take the fight at the end of Man of Steel, where the city is in ruin and probably a lot of people died. Death was treated superficially in order to show the fight.</br></br></br>  <br> Bomb goes off in the background <br><br>A. The explosion is "cartoony" and looks wacky<br>Comedy<br><br>B. The aftermath of the explosion is shown and you see lots of gore<br>Simple Gore , maybe even a "anti-war" scene<br><br>C.Same as B but the show mocks the scene, the character which set the bomb off or has seen the explosion makes dumb jokes or says something "edgy" in order to look cool<br>Edgy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Would it really, though? It's all about portrayal. If the movie was simply ignorant of the suffering it is simply a dumb movie, not an edgy one. If the movie reflects on the destructive nature of their fight in a solemn manner, it is not edgy. If the movie acknowledges the suffering and doesn't give a fuck as long as the characters looked cool doing it, then it's edgy.</br>  <br> C <br><br>I can imagine that happening when portraying an antagonist in order to show he is not quite right in the head and needs to be stopped? In any other instance ...</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone can agree to that.</br>  I define edgy as needless or excessive angst and/or violence. Of course, the bar for needless or excessive changes depending on the series.<br><br>It's really that simple.</br></br>  <br>Yes but even then you have multiple ways of portraying that reaction.<br><br>A. "Pssshh...nothing personal kid."<br>B. "They are human vermin and they deserved it."<br>C. "Blowing people up is fun."<br><br>D. "It had to be done."<br>E. "One day you will understand."<br>F. "Its for a greater good."<br><br>Notice how A-C are "edgy" and D-F arent.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If the movie acknowledges the suffering and doesn't give a fuck as long as the characters looked cool doing it, then it's edgy. <br><br>Yeah, kind of that.<br><br>If a movie tries to present you something violent as cool, with no deeper meaning, purpose or reason, simply to sell you a character as cool for being what any sane person may call a psychopath... I would call that edgy.<br><br>Case in point:<br><br><br>You can´t sell me a character as a pure-hearted hero when he does shit like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because D-F don't sound like something a literally insane person might say. They sound like a rational man justifying something to himself. Why do characters gotta self justify so bad?</br>  <br> People die like trash </br>  <br>Ask the writers of edgy animes.<br><br>You can have the same scene in edgy and in normal. Its not about the action but about how characters handle it.</br></br></br>  <br>A literally insane person wouldn't say A-C. More like, "I did it because Jesus told me to!"</br>  <br>Having a villain do terrible things for the sake of doing terrible things is usually poor writing regardless. If you must have a completely insane person, it would be more about how the show itself treats them more than anything. Is the character glorified, or does the environment around him like opposing characters or tone of the overall work make it clear that he's not a cool guy at all?</br>  <br>This post was pretty edgy</br>  <br>One that is obviously aimed at teenagers like the one in your pic automatically should be labeled edgy.<br><br> english title <br> super powers <br> caucasian and caucasoid characters <br> dystopia <br><br>Automatic edgy chuniishit label applied.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> If a bomb goes, kills some background bystanders and the show is trying to emphasize the loss, it's edgy? <br>If it's emphasizing the loss then it's possibly attempting to show the horrors of war and conflict, or the impact that things like war have on ordinary people.<br><br>For an example of a genuinely edgy bomb sequence, see the opening cutscene to Modern Warfare 3.</br></br></br></br>  Edgy is what happens when an author writes a script with darkness as the main motif without any substance to back it up and is handled. It's designed to cater towards angsty teens that seem to think darkness and gore are cool, usually mixing them with other tonally different lowest common denominator tropes.<br>It's darkness for the sake of darkness and not for the sake of plot or characterization, it's when it tries really hard to appear "dark" through contrived and ineffective tragedy, violence, or evil that it becomes laughable.<br>Unless they are old OVAs with lots of great sakuga, they're utterly worthless.<br><br>Common examples:<br><br>Edgy anime:<br> elfen lied <br> mirai nikki <br> akame ga kiru <br> chaos dragon (probably) <br><br>Dark anime:<br> berserk <br> jin-roh <br> shinsekai yori <br> gakkou gurashi (probably) <br><br>tl;dr <br>complete shit shows that only teens bring up because of babby's first (bad) series with blood</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=887<wbr>WIB1oRAA</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>You're so clever :) and funny ;)</br></br>  <br>nowadays you can't even be sure that's b8 anymore</br>  I'd call Sasuke an Edgy character.  <br> opening cutscene to Modern Warfare 3. <br/></br>  <br>violence for the sake of violence.<br><br>violence or dialogue with the purpose of shock value, but is completely unnecessary.<br><br>violence without emotion or consequence.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daria had it right 15 years ago.<br>And the Japs are behind a decade or two as always.<br><br>I'll go back to what I said:<br> english title <br>Gangsta - the japs can speak fluent dictionary English so shit like Berserk and Bastard can't cut it anymore in contrast Gangsta which is a noneword is still new and fresh for them andclicks with the niggerfied youth of both the West and the East.<br><br> super powers <br>All kids dream about being God.

It used excessive amounts of fairly generic violence to force down our throats every sad background for every character.

Sure, the colour palette may be dark but there's nothing dark about the story at all.</br></br></br>  <br> using characters riiiiiiiiiiiiiight on the edge of being out of school <br>I haven't read the manga, but the main characters in Gangsta are both in their mid to late 20s by their physical appearances</br></br>  <br>This comment is probably the reason word "edge" exist. <br><br>Theme-wise Jin Roh is pretty bleak, in its core is a story about political corruption in a pretty hopeless world. Most importantly it is about the psyche of a man that is used as a tool, even questioning his humanity. It's straight up social commentary and if you read it like this, it's unbelievably dark and hopeless story, with one of the biggest downer endings.<br><br>But because it doesn't have tons of blood and people cursing for their terrible fate in midst of the machine, you don't see it as dark. This is why "edge" exists, because works that are subtle are not noticed and you have to rub the bleakness in the face of the viewer.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't have an idea what world "dystopia" means, do you?</br>  <br>Think about some weaboo autist. Now imagine them describing the anime. If they refer to it as "gritty" or "Anyone could die so it's realistic", it's probably edgy.</br>  <br>Rather, I'd say that if it was the leading descriptor and reason you should watch it is "it's so dark"<br>Bonus edge points if they call it "metal"</br></br>  <br>But Dorohedoro is metal, and it's not edgy</br>  <br>Those are true tho. <br><br>They live in a world like that, retarded would be if any of them died. <br><br>And you know that in real life people don't have 3 arcs of badassery before they die or something right? In AgK you die when it's your turn and that's it. It's not edgy, it's just the world they live in and the fucking fact that they're assassins. <br><br>I think they say it in like ep 1</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's retarded. <br><br>Guts is edgy as fuck too then.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be easier to agree with you if it were just the assassins and villains f the week, but the giant pointless torture dungeon, Meet Dog, clown rape, etc. kinda throw a wrench into your view</br>  <br>Edgy = "Dark" thing I don't like (SnK)<br><br>Not Edgy = "Dark" thing I like (Berserk)</br></br></br>  <br> How is it needless if their deaths fueled MC's desire to wipe out the vampires? <br>Killing the MC's wife/daughter/brother/sister/best friend to fuel the MC's motivation is easy and usually looked down upon as cheap, unimaginative writing. It's both overdone and boring.<br>"Edgy" isn't about needless blood so much as "cheap" blood, cheap lives.</br></br></br>  <br>That is just a subjective interpretation of a sperg lord and does not necessarily mean that the show itself has to be edgy. <br><br>But even so, who wants to be associated with the likes of someone like that? So instead of just calling the person edgy, we also call the show.</br></br></br>  <br>I enjoyed Deadman Wonderland and it was edgy as fuck<br> I also have an albino fetish, so that might have something to do with it </br></br>  <br>About the clown, just check albert fisher. He's not edgy, just crazy as fuck. Pedophile killers can exist anywhere. <br><br>Torture dungeon, it happened in real life. It was common back in time and don't say it wasn't because you know it was. All the torture devices that existed before human rights kicked in. AgK happens in a time similar to middle ages so it makes sense. <br><br>All the ones that did those things are crazy fucks and the story tells you several time they're crazy fucks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Edginess is more related to tone than it is to content.<br><br>As a rule of thumb, I regard something as edgy if it's tonally dark and also juvenile.<br><br>Darkness is not tantamount to edginess. Darkness encroaches on edginess when it's not tempered with maturity.<br><br>For instance, I doubt anyone here would call Texhnolyze an "edgy" show despite the fact that it's one of the tonally darkest animes ever made. <br><br>Similarly, I would hesitate to call Black Lagoon edgy. It's self-aware of its own absurdity and actually handles its dark undertones with surprising maturity when it comes to the character drama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The torture dungeon is one of my biggest annoyances with the series because it has no reason to exist, other than to show how comically evil the nobility was.<br><br>Give me even one reason why it was there<br> to keep the citizens in line <br>The common person didn't even know it existed; they just knew that dissenters would sometimes disappear.<br> to extract information <br>Not only did Regent Evilface scarcely even acknowledge the revolution in works, no information taking is ever shown. It's just a bunch of naked peasants shown walking en masse towards giant pots of boiling oil or something equally dumb. Fuck, even Berserk had it's giant evil torture dungeon show the torturers actually try to get something out of it's prisoners; that's a real example of an Inquisition-style setting<br><br>I'm hard-pressed to even think of a third genuine example of why it would have existed. it's in the same vein as the caricaturized faced used when someone does something super evil.<br><br>tl;dr it's poor writing</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raping and murdering a dead man's wife and child on his grave for no reason other than shock value is the very definition of 'edgy".</br>  <br>It's there to show Esdeath is crazy. She burried like 40000 people alive. <br><br>It's there to show she's a bad person. It's there to show she shouldn't be trusted (not that it matters to waifufags). <br><br><br>The point it's trying to make is to show she's insane. No need to dwell on it more than necessary. She enjoys doing that shit and there are people within the empire that enjoy it too. In real life those people exist by the way</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> for no reason <br><br>Maybe because they were raping and murdering everyone else and nobody stopped them? Why would they NOT rape and murder Borg's family if they were doing the same to everyone they wanted?</br></br></br>  <br>If you need a giant torture dungeon gruesomely slaughtering thousands of people simply because 'she's crazy and she likes it' and no real practical reason,<br>I think you've got exactly the kind of edgy people are complaining about</br></br>  I think in many people in this thread who classify edgy as "needless violence" are on the right track, but I think the problems come once you try to portray clinically insane person. If the point of the series is that person is "insane", is it unconditionally edgy?<br><br>I don't think shit like akame ga kill really counts, as the insanity is somehow mixed with comedy that makes it stand out unecessarily</br></br>  <br>Rape clown was absurd and edgy as fuck. I mean not when he raped random kids and shit but what he did to Bols family. They were literally on the same side, even if ashura was PMs son and had a lot of clout to cover shit up, if esdeath or jobking had known what ashura and the clown did to a fallen soldiers family, especially one as prominent as Bols who was clearly part of that worlds fucking navy seal french rangers legion military unit they would have them all executed.<br><br>No clown, no matter how inclined he was towards rape would risk that, especially when it out was out in the open, on a clear day. And it wasn't even dark outside yet. Yes I'm still fucking mad, I'm glad that glorious winged faggot incinerated his ass.</br></br></br>  <br> Crazy people need a reason to do crazy things <br><br>Mozgus in Berserk was insane, he was just convincing himself he was doing it for some greater good, doesn't change the fact that he did it because he was crazy. <br>He was edgy as fuck yet somehow it's acceptable? Double standard.</br></br></br></br>  How's it feel seeing your husbando for the first time in like weeks and then he gets raped by the KINGU, Yuzu?  <br>People thought Yugo was going to be jealous Yuya was dueling the king but he was all<br> that poor fool </br></br>  <br> Yuya.wav </br>  <br>Dark Law banishes, it doesn't ever send Pendulum to the Graveyard in the first place, so it avoids the stipulation of them getting sent to the Extra Deck, while Acid does indeed destroy the Pendulum Scales that have been set. <br><br>Dark Heroes is a direct counter to Pendulums, and it could make a lot of sense for Yuri to have the deck, especially as the one Anon said, Tuxedo Mask to Serena's Sailor Moon.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Law only banishes things in the hand, it can't prevent things on the field.</br>    There is any KINGU webm yet?  xth for rin being yugos soulmate not yuzu you ntr loving cuckolds  <br>Yes Jack put your red dragon on yuya's wide ethereal hole</br>  <br>Read the card again.</br>  <br>Which is a reason why Stratos is never coming back to 1 in the TCG.</br>    <br>chicken pls</br>  <br> 184x273 </br>  <br> Not posting best tuner </br>  If you had to ride on a bike with this girl, would you be in front &amp; active, or back &amp; passive?  <br>Front so she has to hug you to stay on.</br>  <br>How about back and active?</br>  r-ruri?  <br>Ruri~</br>  <br>ri-<br>i mean yuzu~</br></br>  <br>Always front so they can hold you tight when they get scared at your dueling antics.</br>  xth for yuuya    YAMEROOOOO    <br>Do not scare the yuzu.</br>  <br>JOUNOUCHI FIYAAH</br>  <br>Good lord, this is worse the Bottomless argument.</br>  Why did they make Yuuya so kissable?  <br>and fuckble</br>  <br>I just want him to treat me like his Yuzu</br>  <br>I just want a Yuzu to cuddle with.</br>  Stop fucking synchro summoning  <br>That too</br>  <br>Is this a legit speedroid deck?</br>  what's the worst possible thing that can happen in 6 months ?  LIGHTNING  <br>As legit as you can make it right now.</br>  <br>Works pretty well. Most shit being level 3 makes leviair a very silly card. You always want a banished piaano, because sizerrs is a good card. Wish that dhama said no monsters instead of no cards, but what are you going to do. 500 burn per turn puts some level of pressure on your opponent, and if you're opponent has 1400 or less during MP1, you can derp strike fighter his ass.</br>  <br>Surge of new-nostalgiafags only because of the movie</br>  <br>People shitting on Arc-V without even trying to watch it.</br>  <br>Kaiba jobs to someone that isn't Yami</br>  <br>Imagine if Kaiba jobs to Joey's new Red-eyes support<br> Nah probably wont happen </br></br>  Beigomax and taketonborg are overbalanced. Beigomax shouldn't have had an OPT, and taketonborg should be able to be SS'd however many times.<br>While I'm complaining, yoyo and ohaji should have been on any summon.</br>  <br>Blue-Eyes evolution is a maindeck monster</br>    <br>Joey jobs to the bad guy<br><br>Oh wait that's absolutely going to happen</br></br></br>  <br>The villain is actually Dr. Fudo and doesn't just look like him.</br>  <br> tfw it's just Kaiba and Joey tossing Red/Blue Eyes into the graveyard and playing Silver's Cry and Pendulum cards all over the damn place <br> tfw Yugi gets support upset at both of their disrespect for monsters </br></br>  <br>Unless it's searchable, this is easily the worst outcome.</br>  <br>It'd easy be searchable, hell there are already cards to search for something like that, considering it'd likely be Lv. 8 or higher assuming it's an normal/effect. <br><br>Otherwise Synchro/Xyz wouldn't even matter if it was searchable.</br></br></br>  <br>You!  I like you. </br>  <br>Just because its searchable doesnt mean its good</br>  <br>oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit</br>  <br><br>This movie won't come out subbed for like a year and a half. Maybe longer</br></br>  remember when yuya thought it was a good idea to use all of his cards at once  <br>It'll be out in Japan in 2016 May, and later that year for the rest of the world. You know you want to hear sexy Dan Green again.</br>  <br>Thats a pretty beautiful waifu you got there Yuya<br>It would be a shame if something happened to her</br></br>  <br>Remember when people only read opponent's cards effects for random plot conveniences even though they can at all times?<br><br>I definitely do, I actually liked the DM dub, at least as far as Kaiba/Atem went.</br></br></br>  <br>Shining Dragon isn't bad because it's a main deck monster. It's bad because it is a main deck monster that requires an extra deck monster to summon, one which requires a reasonable amount of resources to get out.<br><br>And in the end it isn't that much stronger than Ultimate.<br><br>Shining would be a decent card if it just required one blue-eyes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shadoll Fusion for Blue-Eyes FIXED</br>  <br>The problem I have with the movie is the fact that is 6 months after the manga, so, that means it won't have any connections with GX and the people who died in the manga will remain dead? Or it will be a mix of the two storylines?</br>  <br>But will it explain Ushio's immortality?</br>  <br>The movie has just destroyed our good times on this threads<br>We will never hear the end of this will we</br></br>  <br>It will tie in to Arc-V in some way<br><br>It has the word Dimension in the fucking title and the bladeless duel disk</br></br></br>  <br>Bitch please, she can handle you soon enough, once she masters synchro summoning.</br>  <br>  has the word Dimension <br>Someone please kill me</br></br>  <br> Yuzu beating Yuri <br><br>Kek</br></br></br>  <br> yuzu beating anyone relevant ever <br><br>top kek</br></br></br>  <br>Oh come on, she beat... Masumi? In their second round after preparing a whole deck against her.<br>She was kinda relevant, I guess.</br></br>  <br>Masumi would be carded if she was involved with the plot at all</br>  <br>No he just ages well, 5Ds is probably only like 30 years after DM anyways.</br>   Next episode Yuzu is a thirsty KINGU groupie <br>You know it to be true</br>  <br>Is Bakura MIA in this?</br>  <br>Yugi and Kaiba use Synchro and XYZ</br>  <br> Bakura <br> Ever being relevant <br><br>You can tell that the big wigs wished Takahashi had never introduced him so they could fully focus on jacking off Kaiba</br></br></br></br>  card game in motorcycle + picking up card in the ground<br>this game sure became more dangerous</br>  <br> like ryou bakura in the first season <br> hardly ever shows up again. <br>i think he had 3 or 4 scenes after that.</br></br></br>  this is like some deepest lore<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>78426</wbr></br>  <br>one of them being   told to fuck off because of his evil spirit and running off crying  <br>  or was that the manga  </br></br>  BASED KINGU  <br>It's called Wheelie Breakers</br>  <br>I really want Yuya to win the Friendship Cup and fight Jack again, hell he can even do his LADIES AND GENTLEMAN shtick. <br><br>I just want Jack to end up pushing his buttons hard enough where he just outright summons OERD and wins</br></br></br>  <br>If Yuya wins, he can firmly stand at the top and tell everyone about Academia's invasion<br><br>Yugo can duel Jack literally any other time, Yuya needs to fuck Jack up since this is his only chance.</br></br></br>  Reiji wont be taking part in the friendship coup, right?  <br>Just in case you thought dueling on motorcycles wasn't extreme enough</br>  <br>Before dueling KINGU Yuya will need to win against  HUNGRY DUELING . And that probably won't happen.<br> Crow will be the one to duel Jack. Too many flags point to this. Also 5D's epilogue. </br></br>  <br> too many flags to point to this <br><br>Like what? That he called Jack a traitor?</br></br></br>  Top duels<br><br>DM: Joey vs Marik/Ishizu vs Kaiba/Yugi vs Atem<br>GX: Judai vs Yubel/Judai vs Yugi<br>5DS: Yusei vs Kiryu/Jack vs Carly<br>Zexal: Yuma vs III<br>Zexal II: Yuma vs Vector/IV vs Nasch/Kaito vs Mizael (3)</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Too many flags point to this <br>What flags? Because the single biggest flag we've seen is Yuya getting beat down by Jack and being told he needs to improve his entertainment duels and make them less self satisfying to have a hope against him</br></br>  <br>The fact that he said it multiple times and that they were teamates in 5Ds.</br>  How the fuck are Yuya's duels self satisfying? People loved them  <br> 5D's <br><br>But this is Arc-V</br></br></br>  <br>Crow could never beat Jack in 5Ds, and that wont change now. More important, Jack is the final boss of this arc and Yuya is the protag, they arent going to have him lose and watch the climactic battle in the stands. The only other person I see with a slim chance of facing Jack is Yugo</br>  <br> Yuya needs to fuck Jack up since this is his only chance. <br>Oh wow. I like Yuya too, but that's too retarded, man. I fucking detested a creature like you, why are you allowed to exist? Whoever let you live must be the worst kind of living being.</br></br>  <br>I hope he does.</br>  <br>And Yuya has to fight Yugo in order to beat Jack<br><br>So unless the Friendship Cup is called off, Yuya is going to duel Jack again</br></br></br>    <br>The problem is that Yuya was not dueling in his entertainment style. He went full dragons just like he did with Reji and paid for it. That's 2 losses now where he over extended himself just to try a relentless attack on the enemy. On top of that, This was not Entertainment dueling as Yuya did not once acknowledge the audience, just smashing Jack's face in.</br>  <br> your dueling is self-satisfaction <br> MANZOKU </br></br>  <br> Jack is the final boss of this arc <br> not end_your_turn guy </br></br>  Jack is a talentless hack who doesn't understand entertainment dueling   Yugo and Yuzu rescue Yuya <br> He's unconscious so he doesn't know <br> His determination to prove his father's dueling style is the best to Jack will cause him to lose Yuzu again <br>We're getting full on Shakespearean, boys</br></br></br>  <br>Jack is the KINGU of entertainment.<br>Now, stop posting, Yuya. We all understand that you are got a shitty father.</br></br>  Whose VA do you think has the best voice during the summon chants? I go for Shun, I can't help it but I shout REIDO RAPTAASU with him.  <br>All the flavours but you decide to be salty</br>    <br><br> says this <br> after gloating about being King and strongest duelist <br><br>I wish Kaiba showed up and then dueled him and Reiji. How egotistical would they be?</br></br></br></br></br>  I want the Crimson Dragon to appear in Arc-v with 5D Jack so he can duel Arc-v Jack  <br>It's basically mariokart.  I'm okay with that </br>  <br><br> inb4 this is caused by whatever happened in the new Yugioh movie. </br></br>    <br> I want the Crimson Dragon to appear in Arc-v with 5D Jack so he can duel Arc-v Jack <br>That'd pretty much just the Jack vs Robot Jack duel from 5Ds</br></br>    <br>Robot Jack is a fake didn't have waga tamashii like Arc-v Jack</br>  Drawfag Thread 1537<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1529:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn <br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1536 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>The Circle doesn't exist, they said.<br>Doing art trades in the threads won't backfire, they said.<br>She'll be drawn, they said.</br></br></br>  <br>the circle only sort of exists, the fact your waifu isn't drawn is because she's ugly and unappealing, not because of the circle.</br>  <br> your waifu isn't drawn is because she's ugly and unappealing <br>spoken like a true Circlekike.</br></br>  <br> the circle only sort of exists <br>That is the stupidest thing ive ever heard futayofag.
