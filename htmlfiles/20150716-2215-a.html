[ This g took on a whole gang armed with guns by himself. And with a sword too.  I could do that with my hands tied behind my back.  <br>thats cause he's level zero or whatever the fuck the whole deal is. <br><br>I don't know I read that manga fucking years ago.</br></br></br>  <br>Bet you'd like have your hands bound behind your back.</br>  <br>Yeah, I would. I'd like like to strap my cock to my thigh.</br>  Because pic related.  That's because Twilights are borderline supernatural super soldiers.  <br>Japs and they're obsession with "katana &gt; guns" are so cute.</br>  Was he really voiced by a deaf man?  <br>Japs and their obsession with "katana &gt; guns" are so cute.</br>  Previous thread: <br><br>ISHUHUI'S OUT EARLY. REJOICE: http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>271</wbr></br></br>  <br>see chapter 39 and 43. The first one (38) was released on the same day as PM, but they didn't knew about PM. Afterwards they didn't expect PM to actuall ypick it up, so the continiued to release it normally the from chapter 40 onwards they rushed it to be faster than PM.</br>  <br> hi <br> hello <br><br>Classic. Saved.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> &gt;(Hosu District..) <br> &gt;(Monsters who look like noumou...) <br> &gt;(Iida...) <br> &gt;(Hosu...) <br> &gt;(Hero...) <br> &gt;(Killer...) <br> &gt;God damn it, where did they come from? <br> &gt;The Fly is down. Man down! <br> &gt;Just what are these monsters trying do to? </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here it is. I hope Deku and Ochako can protect Iida's smile in the future.<br><br>Now I won't take requests for now, but I saw something in this thread that I really need to fix.</br></br></br>  <br>HIS FLY IS DOWN!</br>  Outside Umaru is undeniably the best girl.  Let me guess.<br><br>There will be ZERO progress between Ebina and Onii-san even if the show reaches its 4th-5th season.<br><br>Lots of cockblocking. Lots of indecisiveness. Lots of "EH? NANDATTE?"<br><br>Why do I even watch this?<br><br> Ebina's tits tbh </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She's a goddamn qt but needs to smile more.</br>  <br><br>She's not funny because several people don't find her funny. We get it.</br></br>  <br>Is blonde hair a sign of beauty in Japan or something? Or did they just give her a random nonstandard hair color to differentiate her from the rest?</br>  <br>ebin</br>  Flat thread. Flat thread.    <br>I dunno. Sure, its nice and squishy most times, but whenever something focuses too much on ass, you get gigantic triple badonkadonks. There's a limit, just like with breasts.<br>Sinon's ass fits right in the perfect place.</br></br>  <br>touche anon. touche.</br>   this thread <br>It's a good day to be an ally of justice</br>  <br>That "ideal" image looks gross. <br>That's literally not even how breasts work.</br></br>  .  <br>Glasses make every girl instantly better.</br>   cowtits <br> glasses <br> that hairstyle <br>Even though these features are unattractive on their own, she somehow makes them work. It really fascinates me.</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't this get an anime or something.</br>      So I have to admit that the sequel was pretty cool, if you watch both movies the same night you will probably be smiling like a fool by the time it ends. I have to admit that Trigger really did a good job, even though I wish they would've added some fireworks at the end of the sequel but it was nice to watch, what do you think guys?  <br>You would have loved it no matter what if you gave 100 fucking dollars</br>  Shit new characters, shit plot, shit drama<br><br><br>Shit/10<br><br>And they managed to make the MC even more annoying</br></br></br></br></br>  The new girls were basically useless, barely more than background characters, story wasn't interesting and a Precure episode would have more meat than this in half the time.  I know that I'm posting on a imageboard for japanese cartoons, but this was like some saturday morning children's show.  The grievances between Akko, Lotte, and Sucy in the first half seemed out of character from what we were given in the first installment. Diana basically played no role whatsoever. The animation was good. The end.  As always episode 2 was perfect, just perfect. <br><br>Now faggots, lets post most girls in memory of Truck Driver who dies thanks to Horse Pussy.</br></br>  <br>Is that real?<br>Props if so. Anything is better than underscores, random @#$% symbols, or a line of asterisk.</br></br>  <br><br>It'd be akin at American police trying to arrest a diplomat from, say, Iran. It's purely a political thing.</br></br>  <br>ONE OF US<br><br>ONE OF US</br></br></br>  <br>Monster can get deported for harming humans. It's a slap on the wrist though. Ms. Smith's group was made to handle shit likes this and I'm sure other similar groups have been made. <br>I'm curious how the other countries are handling the monster in this setting.</br></br>  <br><br>Those orks are criminals so they don't care.</br></br>  Someone explain to me what a Stand is, please?  nobody knows what it means but its provocative    <br>Everytime.</br>  <br>You might just be a pleb.<br><br>Let me guess, you dropped it halfway through Part 3.</br></br></br>  <br>Were there animals with stands in parts 4,5,6? I know for sure 7 and 8 do not have them.</br>  Episode 280 along with early manga spoilers today.  <br>I always gauged Oboro to be equal or just above Gin.</br>  <br>I'd imagine that the difference between Oboro, Kamui and Hosen is just one or two levels. So Oboro's level 90, Kamui's level 89 and Hosen's level 88. Gintoki's floating somewhere around level 80-85.</br>  <br>Madao is actually really strong samurai. So fast that he could rip his suit with one swing of sword. His Iaido is probably better than Jirocho´s.</br>  <br>Umibouzu should be at Hosen's level and Oboro at or below Gintoki's. I'd also place Saigo pretty high. At around Jirocho's level at least.</br>  <br>Also, while Gintoki did get the jump on Oboro in their second encounter, it was largely because Gin got the jump on him. In their third fight, Gin was covered in wounds while Oboro didn't have a scratch on him.<br><br>Oboro seems to be really weak against surprise assaults. All of his greatest losses and injuries were due to such tactics.</br></br></br>  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YCMI<wbr>O7VA2qs</wbr>  [ ]<br>Medaka and Nanami Shichika are relatives.</br>  <br>Reminder that Nanami was the reason we never saw the samurai with the glass sword slicing up sharks and mountains.</br>  <br>Thank god quads weren't wasted on this shit-tier post.</br>  This is a Japanese boy detective<br><br>new episode today</br></br>  <br>Implying Man of 20 Faces did not brainwash that girl so that she`d kill him according to his Keikaku. He also killed the new teacher and now attend school wearing her skin as bodysuit.</br>  <br>Hey now, no talking about the plot. We have far more important and relevant things to discuss here.</br>  <br>Why not talk about the plot? Just look at all that plot. It's delicious!</br>    <br> you will never make Hashiba blush at you <br>Why continue maintaining a corporeal form</br></br>   STILL NO SEASON 2 <br><br>I'm dead bruh</br></br>  <br>That would imply there are orgy bus doujins to begin with. Dump them nao.</br>   No full color scans ever   <br><br>/a/ is SFW go look them up on sadpanda.</br></br>  Would you a Roach, /a/?  <br>The writer's a hack anyways. The only reason he wrote the story was to push some dumbass political agenda of his. That's pretty much what he always does.</br>  Just finished One Punch Man <br>damn i didn't expect it to be unfinished like that <br> <br>Do you think Gorou will actually put up a good fight? Supposedly they both surpassed human.</br></br></br>   Bang dies.   <br> I came here to post Tatsumaki ass</br>  <br>My body was ready</br>  <br>also wtf are you talkin about, Saitama already won, Currently Saitama and Tatsumaki are fighting, bitch gonna get "Serious Spanking"</br>  I love threads like this   Hey guys does liking her make me a lolicon <br> Because I mean if you say that's the case I'm going to stop liking her <br> I can definitely change my fetishes if this board says they're not healthy <br><br>Why do people still do this<br>Why can't you just jerk off to whatever turns you on and shut up</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> retarded normals judge others based on their own retarded standards <br><br>Whuda thunk it?</br></br></br>  <br> implying being pedo is bad <br>Not anymore from the moment faggot marriage was legalized</br></br>  My dick becomes diamonds ocer traps.
