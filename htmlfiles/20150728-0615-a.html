[ Is the anime doing a good adaptation so far?  <br>it wasn't much.</br>  Mostly, there are some scenes where the shadows are simplified which lessens their impact.  I find it better than the manga    Shokugeki no Soma threads are pretty dead, aren't they?  The anime is pretty much following the manga exactly. You're not missing out on much if you decide to go in it anime-only.<br><br>Plus we get great scenes like this in the anime<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Guc<wbr>0wnMdYhw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Did you miss the last one?</br>  Good because Erina ZR looks nicer than manga.  <br>BEST ENDING? BEST ENDING!</br>  Fucking hell, I love this show. It's stupid, yet it does everything right.<br><br>Would you let Meat Master master your meat?</br></br>  It's doing a pretty good job, but a few things that annoy me:<br>-Much less well stylised than the manga<br>-Doesn't say his trademark "it wasn't much"<br>-Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga<br>On the plus side, it makes a lot of scenes more hype</br></br></br></br>  <br>The scanlations have a much darker image than the original. And shadows don't really count as part of good adaptation. So far as adaptation is concerned it doing great and is almost a 1:1 accurate. They even added Erina's background from the one-shot and given her more screen time compared to the manga. The only major difference so far is the Karaage arc was rearranged after Jouichirou's visit which didn't do any harm to flow of the story.</br>  <br> Doesn't say his trademark "it wasn't much" <br>Yes he does, it's just that the sub for it is different. It's a pretty hard phrase to translate into English anyway.</br></br>  <br>Oh, does he still say it in nip? Wonder why they'd change the TL, the way they translate it in the manga works fine</br>   Best villain shows up once then never returns <br>How horrible. I wanted to see more of the sexy URBAN RAIFE PURANNER</br>  <br>Good, but I worry they are not going to be able to fit the entire tournament arc in the eps left.</br>  <br>Plot twist: She is actually the end game love choice.

At least one of them has to get some character development right?  <br>if she grew her hair out, yes</br>  <br>They won't. Not with 8 episodes left. There's still the Karaage arc and they still have to introduce Hayama Akira and Shiomi Jun. At best it will end at the preliminaries.</br>  <br>they made him sound like a dewgong</br>  <br>but....the short blonde hair is her best feature<br><br><br>in a heartbeat</br></br></br></br>  <br>about as good an adaption as you could expect. definitely the best JC Staff adaption i've seen. that said nothing can match Tosh's art. and at times the anime seems lacking</br>  <br> Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga <br>But Takumi is never annoying?</br></br>  <br> nothing can match Tosh's art <br>I agree with you on that. The anime's art style is still pretty good. It's just Tosh's is not easy to replicate.</br></br>   there are people who think Erina is NOT going to win the soumabowl <br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=7l4<wbr>ESr0PdSQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Learn your place, plebs</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Where is this from?

Something light hearted before shit goes down again. Just can't wait to see what goes down and how. My expectation is that it will involve Erina quite heavily since she has had so much presence recently</br>  <br>That was cute as fuck.</br>  <br> it was only 10 chapters <br>the thing is 10 chapters of the same thing. the autumn election was not only based on ONE fucking fight.<br>yes there are many different movements souma is taking. but it took really long. it could have been simplified to 6 to 7 chapters. with the other 3 or 4-5 chapters still being the same festival but with different things to do.<br><br><br>I didn't think the karaage arc was shit, but like you said it has the same feeling. the arc itself was also long.<br><br>Seeing some Erina happening would be nice and would give some progress FUCKING FINALLY</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This scenario they did for the drama CD would have fit perfectly with that limo scene they had after leaving Tootsuki resort.</br>  Hisako and Souma teaming up again when?  <br>Is suppose to be what happened in that scene.</br>  Color chapter is here   I just want Erina to find out that Souma is Jouchirou's son.<br><br>Just, do it this year please.</br></br>  <br> fucking soma's humming voice </br>  <br>I didn't mean that the karaage arc was shit either, just that the 2 arcs have a very similar 'calm before the storm' feeling to me. I know what you mean though, we really need some Erina progress. Hopefully shed some light on her relationship with Jouichirou and help her relationship with Souma in a serious way</br>  <br>-They're completely different mediums, as far as the art style goes it matches it very very well and the animation has been way better than expected.

The animation is really good, but I feel like the character designs are a lot more generic in the anime than the manga.</br>  <br> and we are already in the 100 numbers <br>This manga will go for more 400-500 chapters.<br>Jouichirou back story never.</br></br></br>  <br>I would kill for it because they literally have the best chemistry.</br>  <br><br>*Edit wrong quote.<br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather not have flashback arcs, but certainly some more info on the backstory would be nice. I'm just hoping the success doesn't cause the manga to overstretch itself for sales</br>  Did the Shokugeki x Isobe collabs get removed from Batoto again?  <br>God damn it.

First OP was really fucking great, just energetic boyish singing<br>UMARE KAWARU IMA KOKO DE</br>  <br>I don't really like 2nd OP either. Feels like it's missing something. Actually OP 1 felt more shounen to me, and it fit considering what kind of manga this is anyways.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br> Meat in a summer dress <br><br>So fucking cute</br></br></br>  ED1 &gt; ED2 yes?  <br>Yes. <br>But ED2 is still cute.</br></br>  <br>fura fura was so catchy. But there was something shoujo-ish about ED2 which I kinda liked and I don't even read or watch shoujo.</br>  <br>OP 1 &gt; OP 2 as well.</br>  Do people still believe that Erina doesn't want Jouichiro's dick after the latest episode? <br><br> Hurr she just respects him as a chef that cooks with love. <br>Can't remember how many times I heard that bullshit. Reminder that all it takes for her panties to get for Soma is realizing that theyre father-son.</br></br></br>  <br> unironically being an animeonlyfag and shitposting about it </br>  <br>Who says I haven't read the manga? I've been saying this shit before the anime even aired. The latest episode just confirmed it even harder with all the colorful bubbles and blushing illustrations that Erina gets whenever Jouichiro's involved. <br><br>It's just sad that there are delusional idiots that refuse to believe that Erina salivates for Jouichiro's dick because they self-insert into Soma hard.</br></br></br>  <br>If you read the manga then you'd realize that Erina is a sheltered child who probably doesn't know how babies are made, and that she deeply respects Jouichirou for his amazing cooking and views it as perfect. There is literally nothing to suggest that she's after him sexually.</br>  It's a solid, straight-forward adaptation that doesn't really take many liberties with the source material. Not a lot of QUALITY moments either so far which is cool (not like this has high-impact action scenes with tons of elaborate motion but still).<br><br>It's pretty good, OP. I typically bore of harem-anything but the manga has kept me reading and the anime was a pleasant surprise.</br></br>  <br>It's nothing like that. It's more like a 1st grader having a crush on their teacher. Though I think she just really admires Jouichirou like a hero/idol or something. She's probably too innocent to even know what a dick is.</br>  I wonder when we're going to find out about Souma's mom.<br><br>I'm just assuming that she's dead since she hasn't shown up but who knows.<br><br>Think it'll be really sad if she's dead whenever they get around to talking about it?</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't mind OP2 but I definitely like OP1 better as well. I feel like this time, they're trying to convey in the music and the animation how much more serious, intense, and shounen battle-ish the second half is (which it is). But fuck it, I miss my UMARE KAWARU</br></br>  <br><br>Alright, I'm being facetious when I say salivating for his penis.<br><br>What I'm pointing out is a matter of whether or not she's crushing on him and longs for him in a sort of fantasy romance-sense, which I would argue that she does (FFS, she carries around a hidden photo of him with her.)<br><br>But some idiots on this board are so hung up on self-inserting that they refuse to believe that it's possible that Erina to develop romantic feelings for anyone beside Soma and that 'her feelings for Jouichiro is just respect for his skill as a chef!'</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I'll eat my own dick if those romantic feelings for Jouichiro don't transfer over to Soma as soon as she discovers their father-son relation (albeit following a serious case of denial for several chapters probably).</br>  <br>Yes<br>And OP2 &gt; OP1</br></br>  <br>A few implications kind of make you want to guess that she's kicked the bucket. Remember the shop was closed with no one else to watch it after Souma went to Tootsuki. I think if she was on a business trip she would have been phoned at least during that time Soma made a call to his dad after the Hayama/Kurokiba 3 way shokugeki. Probably a truck accident seeing how things usually are with manga plots nowadays.<br><br>Fucking truck-san.</br></br></br>  <br>Source is always better than the anime, but the adaptation is good, some parts obviously skipped so the manga is nice because you can get a different perspective</br>  <br> offscreen takoyaki date <br>IS THIS CANO<br> Best grill arrives and ruins atmosphere <br>Meh. 9/10, it's alright.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I see it as more likely being sickness. Jouichiro falling in love with a fragile girl. After traveling around the world, his search for a 'key ingredient' ends right back in Japan and ends up being 'love' or something cliche like that. As she gets sicker, he continues to nurse her and cook for her various dishes he learned while traveling, allowing her to 'visit' places she was never able to since she was too sick.<br><br>This shit writes itself.</br></br></br>  <br>I didn't expect a upbeat song for the 2nd track.</br>  <br>Either that or some stupid shit where it turns out Jouichiro's wife was basically Soma's Erina in terms of plot development (Starting from the bottom and winning the heart of an Ojou).</br>  <br>So she gets pregnant and dies in childbirth due to her weakness from the sickness coupled with labor? I guess I could buy that. But why would they agree on conceiving a child while she was that sick anyways?</br>  <br>But they have a family photo together, she died later.</br>  <br>She was alive when Souma was a kid.</br>  <br>Well she doesn't have to die in childbirth. Maybe she sucuumbed to sickness when he was really young.</br>  What I don't get is, why do Soma and Jo live like middle class people when they're clearly wealthy? Jo is a world class chef, and the fact that Soma can even attend this school is proof that they're loaded.  <br>Erina-fags, haters, non-erina fags, and shipperfags alike will have a week long war with that sort of revelation.</br>  <br>We still don't know. That's why we need a back story.</br>  <br>Probably wants to instill in him humble roots. The first chapter sort of emphasized the errors of thinking you're hot shit because you're the heir of a top class restaurant.</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah. Well still, that kind of stretches it.</br></br>  <br>My guess is Soma's mom was probably a poorfag, and he just went with it.</br>  <br>Takes a lot of money to run a business, and Jouichirou needs travel money obviously. Housing in Japan isn't cheap either as I heard. Souma is also attending Tootsuki, a prestigious school for upcoming top chefs.</br>  <br>It also lets him learn how to do things in new ways instead of relying on older proven methods which seems to be one of the main themes of the show.</br>  <br>Souma's mom was probably as wealthy as Megumi but not so skilled as cooking and likely had anime cancer. While she was sick, Souma noticed she brightened up whenever his dad cooked for her so he tried to use his same tool and ended up cutting himself.<br><br>Otoh, it'd be just like Souma to getcut doing something frivilous and there's no deeper meaning behind it.</br></br></br>  <br>With the academy, they likely give scholarships since Megumi is a bit of a poorfag and she was able to attend.</br>  <br>Mehgoo's village probably saved up to send her there which is why she REALLY doesn't want to fail.</br>  <br>Then I guess Jouichirou isn't a lavish spender, he seems kind of like the type to live modestly, and not be materialistic. I'm guessing a lot of expenses just went into his shop and savings.</br>    Erina met joichiro one day <br>  gets mellowed a lot <br>  talks with him, asking about joichiro's wife <br>  he tells her she's ded on an accident while holding soma. And tells her that's how he got his scar <br>  the ice queen defrost speed increases </br></br></br></br>  New hot glue target.  <br>It's shit just like the manga</br>  <br> Fucking Truck-san <br><br>Seriously, they keep doing that. That shit came out of nowhere in Fuuka.</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna see someone cook her in a frying pan and douse her molten remains with ketchup.</br>  <br>Erina is beautiful but that throne is pig disgusting.<br><br><br>Want a band-aid for that cut?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Son of a bitch. Again!? What should I do at this point?</br>  <br>Nevermind me, I'm a moron who didn't check the time.</br>  <br>Osomatsu</br>  <br>I will pay to see that.</br>  sometimes I have to wonder if there are actually 12 year old jumpbabbies posting in these threads. I can't imagine any other explaination for the posters who can't understand why erina is popular.  <br>She's a competent character that can give the MC a run for his money, and facilitate his development, while at the same time is interesting/entertaining to watch herself. She's a character that helps the manga keep going, when properly utilized by Tsukuda, our writer, instead of getting stale.<br><br>^There's some reasons.</br></br></br>  <br>I understand, I just don't agree because I'm not sheeple.</br>  <br>It was a good bait and switch by the anime adaption.</br>  <br>She might win but she'll always be shit.<br><br>Besides, we all know that best girl never wins.</br></br></br>  <br>Tell me anon<br>Who is the best girl?</br></br>  <br>Best in Souma bowl: Megumi<br>Best girl (technically): Alice<br>Best girl (unofficially): Takumi</br></br></br>  <br>I agree with you.<br>Takumi a cute.</br></br>  <br>Good taste anon.</br>  <br>Megumi a shit A SHIT</br>  <br>10/10</br>  <br> Best girl (technically): Alice <br> Best girl (unofficially): Takumi <br>Good taste</br></br></br>  <br>pleb</br>  <br>No that's Hisako as in best girl.</br>    <br>Souma is such a smug motherfucker.</br>  <br>lol holy fuck i guess i better read this instead of just watching the animu now</br>  After a certain point, does cooking skill really matter anymore? They all know how to cook the food, the real conflict comes from how well they make their recipes.  <br>see <br>they both think it matters at any rate</br></br>  So which one was better?  <br>The author of Koufuku Graffiti complained that he came up with the idea of foodgasms first, so I'm guessing that means Shokugeki is better.</br>  <br>Shokugeki is better.</br>  <br>Anyone doing the BDs?</br>  <br>I can understand not liking her on account of shit taste, but the people who complain "durr she's a bitch she was mean to souma what's good about her" have to be trolling or literally 12 years old.</br>  So when does Erina learn that her idol and mentor is Soma's dad?  <br>Never</br>  <br>That's be lame as shit if she never found out.</br>  <br>If anything, it turned her from an unknown hospital nutritionist into a celebrity chef.</br>  <br>Shokugeki is obviously better, but koufuku was good in its own right. One of my favourite anime from winter 15</br>  <br>The brass ones Souma has are mind-boggling sometimes. His entire attitude is basically "call the cops, I don't give a fuck". I love it.</br>  <br><br>Current theory is that she died in an accident that also gave Souma his scar.</br></br>  <br>Does Nikumi have a CD/track too? What's it about?</br>  <br>https://mikorin.wordpress.com/2015/<wbr>06/24/shokugeki-no-soma-volume-11-b<wbr>onus-drama-cd/</wbr></wbr></br>  <br> Takumi is much more annoying than in the manga <br>What, if anything he is more likable in anime, they somehow made him less bitchy. Plus his voice is pleasant to hear.</br></br>  <br>"It wasn't much" is better than "happy to serve" if only for the much-matsu sound.</br>  Oh, the things that I want to do to Hisako  <br>"Happy to serve" is such a western phrase which doesn't quite follow what "Osomatsu" conveys.</br>  <br>Poor Nikumi, it must have felt bad to learn that  she got dancecucked by Megumi. <br>I would've enjoyed seeing what Nikumi dancing with Souma would be like.</br></br>  <br>Its always fun to see him just whip out his shit-eating grin and piss someone off without giving a single fuck</br>  <br>Hah what</br>  <br>Would probably be awkward and terrible as Nikumi stumbles and steps all over her own feet, since she was probably never taught how to dance, since thats "girly"</br>  <br>I plan on making the Gotcha Pork Roast this thursday, is there a translated recipe of it?</br>  <br>hahaha yeah my fav part cucked by Megumi. Dam wish i got to read Megumis reaction to being asked to dance with souma</br>  <br> My father didn’t let me have any of the toys or games that girls did. But because I didn’t complain about the lessons necessary for business, ballroom dancing was the one thing that allowed me to be like a girl. <br>She says and demonstrates as well that she knows how to dance.</br></br>  <br>Don't you dare talk shit about Truck-san.</br>  <br> call the cops, I don't give a fuck". <br><br>That does sounds like Souma.<br><br><br><br><br>You know, I'm starting to think that Souma will not defeat Kuga, but instead drop his sells a bit so Kuga will end up losing first place to some other club.<br>Considering his "two more days" foreshadowing, his bet with Tsukasa is being first all five days and Souma will fuck it.<br><br>Then he will be pretty mad and accepts Souma shokugeki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  erina's so flat  <br>This is just a couple shops away from becoming Takumi.</br>      <br><br>What have you done?</br></br>  <br><br><br> the city of batoto </br></br></br>  Is he going to get cucked by his old man?  <br>Yeah.<br><br>And the kid will inherit the diner.</br></br></br>  <br> cucked <br> <br>we use here NTR</br></br></br>  <br>I guess Jouichirou must have been in Senzaemon's good graces to work for him after not graduating.<br><br>He probably dropped out voluntarily instead of being expelled through shokugeki or disciplinary action.</br></br></br>  <br>It's great. I can actually watch it with my family, even. My mom gasped when Shinomiya failed Megumi (she had been out of the room when this fact was spoiled early in the episode).<br><br>It's solid as Hell as an adaptation, very pleased with it. Can't believe this is an adaptation for a Shounen Jump manga.</br></br></br>  The new ED is massively disappointing.  <br>well the first one was godly not a surprised the new one isnt as good</br>  <br> I can actually watch it with my family, even <br><br>Sounds fun.</br></br></br>  <br>It is!</br>  <br>It's excatly like the manga, that's why they haven't progressed that much yet. It's adapting every chapter without skipping anything (even the details). So watching the anime or reading the manga it doesn't matter it's the same. Only the manga is a lot further that's the only pro I can think of off.</br>  <br> So watching the anime or reading the manga it doesn't matter it's the same <br>Despite I consider the anime an excellent adaptation it's not exactly the same as the manga. Different media have different execution, presentation. and storytelling. The anime also does not lend well to Tosh's art style though still quite good.</br></br>  <br> Fucking hell, I love this show. It's stupid, yet it does everything right. <br><br>The general idea and setting was good along with the initial "everyone against the protag" deal. <br>I think that the execution is what lets it down and is what turns it into just another bland shounen with an OP protag that makes friends and shit easily. It doesn't feel like a struggle and massively hurts the tension and excitement.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They aren't his girlfriends in the first place yet and most of them are only interested in Soma because they imagine his dad when they look at him.</br>  <br>Is your mum single?</br>  <br>No, but there's this one. Try ignore the autism:<br>http://anitay.kinja.com/food-wars-r<wbr>ecipes-in-real-life-1-fake-pork-roa<wbr>st-1703359028</wbr></wbr></br></br>  <br>Man, this is total bullshit. There is literally NO. WAY. her tongue would ever accept generic takoyaki.</br>  <br> I think that the execution is what lets it down and is what turns it into just another bland shounen with an OP protag that makes friends and shit easily. <br> OP protag <br> Souma <br> OP <br><br>nigger there 2 other students just as good as him and one much better just in the first year , with the second and third years being hinted as being much better than them.<br><br> but he shows no effort! <br>just because some one is not crying and bitching 24/7 about having to try too hard doesnt mean they are not having a hard time.<br><br>though I do agree with the friends thing, it would be good to have more people who just dont like him like Eizan showing up and trying to take him down.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's pretty much lost more than he's won so far I don't know what that guy is talking about.</br>  <br>Just to be clear, all three of the Drama CD tracks were written by Tsukuda himself. They mention this several times in the VA interview section. Also, apparently he and Isami's VA are old friends.<br><br>Also, the drama CD is only available with the limited edition of vol 11 of the manga. It's literally a supplement to the manga.<br><br>Erina's track is the one that's most obvious in how it fits. It's simply the rest of the car ride back to school after the manga cut away. Megumi's track is somewhere between the end of the hell camp and the elections. So there's a window of like a month or so where it's set. I honestly don't know when Meat's track takes place though, other than obviously after she's beaten and joins the Don RS.<br><br>On an unrelated note, Akira's been added to the official site.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So Suwabe is confirmed then?<br><br>God damn. I called Okamoto and him to voice Ryou and Hayama, can't believe it actually happened. Based JC Staff.</br></br></br>  <br>yeah, he was confirmed a week or two ago. New announcement was Sugita as Eizan.<br><br>Also vol 2 cover preview image. Vol1 should be out in a couple of days. Hope we get onsen tapestry scan.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Crazy, when I saw Hayama, I kept thinking how I can't stop hearing Suwabe's voice as he spoke since his dark skin, white hair reminded me of Archer. <br><br>Now it's actually happening. For Sugita though I somewhat tied him to voicing Dojima but I ended up loving the one they got instead.</br></br></br></br></br>  Is the anime sales still doing poorly? I know its irrelevant for producing another season but they're getting some big name seiyuus.  <br>  dat erina-hishoko <br>Muh heart</br></br>  This ad.  <br> ***,191位/***,227位 (**1,322 pt) [*,*10予約] 2015/07/29 「食戟のソーマ」第1巻＜初回生産限定版＞ [Blu-ray] <br>It's gradually getting better, two days ago it was 1,295 pt.</br></br>  <br>I can honestly see Shokugeki sell 10k since Hayama and Ryou joining in will bring in the fujobucks if Ishiki hasn't already.</br>  <br>At least it will never sell as poorly as hanayamata</br>  <br><br>SnS is in a pretty nice spot. Fujobucks bump fund it along with the fans who go for the merch and volumes and Tsukuda/Tosh caters to just about everyone with the variety of fanservice from the cast and scenarios the manga gets.<br><br>Reminds me how Nozaki-kun was such a success.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here is the graphic of the last 30 days.</br>  <br>And here is the graphic of the last 7 days.<br>I think this can reach the Manabi line.</br></br>  <br>The soumabowl will probably be on when she finds out who Souma's dad is</br>  <br>Are you sure it won't become the Jouichiroubowl when that happens?</br>  <br>Erina has no idea what romantic affection is to begin with, she's probably confusing her admiration for Jouchirou with a crush<br>Especially considering she doesn't even know his real name now</br></br>  <br><br>How did they meet anyways? Considering Jo seems to know Erina already, who's to say there's not an arranged marriage?</br></br>  <br>He's a travelling chef and best friends with a close business associate of Totsuki and the Nakiri. It's not implausible to have them meet with no pretext</br>  I'm sure they are all naked under the sample banner and that this is in no way misleading.  <br> Yaranaika? </br>  <br> arranged marriage <br>Maybe. If I remember correctly in the novels  Alice's father organized a competition to find a good husband for her . Probably the same happened to Erina.</br></br>  <br>Tapestry will come with the fourth volume.</br>  <br> inb4 Souma and Erina are finally dating. <br> fiance comes out of nowhere. </br></br>  <br>Its very unlikely that there would be. Jouichirou doesn't seem to be the type of person who would force his son into that kind of predicament.</br>  <br>yeah honestly, he's the kind of guy who would take his kid to the supermarket, misplace him, and go home forgetting that he brought him there in the first place.<br><br><br>you're breaking my heart. I guess they just give you the redemption voucher when you preorder 1-4 together?</br></br></br></br>  <br>what about the tapastry</br>  <br>  <br>?</br></br>  <br><br>There is a ticket inside the first three volumes, which must be sent along with what comes inside the fourth volume.<br>I want to buy them just to get the tapestry but I dont know tho whom I must sent them so I can claim it. Until I learn about it, I wont buy anything.</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously the fiance trope is so overused. Besides it wouldn't make sense if Souma was unknowingly betrothed to some girl already.</br>  <br>Anon's talking about an arrangement for Erina in that post. As in "some new dude butts into the picture"</br>  I like food  <br>Everyone likes food. That's why this manga is popular.</br>  <br>Still a step down for Tosh from sex, though. Everyone likes food, but most people like sex better even though they've never had any.</br>  <br> Previous first seat <br>Damn it that would be so fucking cliched.</br></br>  <br> romantic rival is at least 3 years older than the girl in question <br>in japan? maybe I misunderstood something.</br></br>  <br>Maybe it's  Isshiki </br>  <br><br> implying it's not Rindou </br></br>  <br>Why would Souma have an arranged marriage? He is a poor fag.</br>  <br>We are talking about a rival bishounen for Souma anon.</br>  Gary Stus are literally the worst thing to happen in anime.<br><br>"hur durr I'm gonna lose, better somehow grow 20 arms and cook 200 dishes within 30 minutes hur hur"</br></br>    http://shokugekinosoma.com/special/<wbr>distribute/<br>Some cute stuff from the official site, I can't read moon.</br></wbr>  <br>soma isn't a gary stu<br><br>learn your terms, faggot</br></br></br>  <br> I can't read moon <br>I'm preeeeeetty sure that's just their names, anon.</br></br>  Behold, official colors!<br><br> green </br></br>    There's so much yes at the end of this chapter!  Bueno    Holy fuck i actually enjoyed this chapter and not for the fanservice.<br><br>Well done, Mashima. Now back to tits on the next one, please.</br></br>  <br>Please get your idiotic retarded anime out of /a/.<br><br>Reported.</br></br></br>  <br> Note: When reporting, make sure that the post in question violates the global or board rules, or contains content illegal in the United States. Submitting false reports will result in a ban. </br>  Gray got to have a nice showing this chapter. <br><br><br>Mashima really likes these outfits that show off the leg all the way up to the hip.</br></br></br>  <br>This would've singlehandedly wiped out Avatar's grunt army, if he can do it on the same scale as Silver.<br><br>Pity the sand guy popped right out of the ice. Gray still needs more training.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Man that white space right in the middle of the boots make it look like she's got some really janky deer legs</br></br>  <br>Thats just powercreep. Even if Gray's ice magic was stronger than Silver's he still would of just popped right out.</br>  <br><br>DAT Outfit<br>DEM Hips<br><br>Based Mashima.</br></br></br></br></br>  I want to see some Wendy action going. Lucy is fine, too.  <br>Erza got to drive like a rocket. I guess that's something.<br><br>I'll be disappointed if she doesn't pull a new vehicle out of her breasts to finish their getaway. She should be capable of at least that much by now.</br></br></br>  Nice enough chapter.Art felt different.Might've been the shading.Sand clone when?  <br>It's certainly an improvement over the last time she needed to drive one of those things in a hurry.</br>  This manga is fucking ridiculous. Don't introduce someone as being on par with Ishgar's strongest magician to have him beaten a few seconds later by weak fucks. I'm done, never reading this again.  <br>Ill agree with this, I loved how they were being forced to run away but then in just a few seconds they punch him and seem like they're going to fight.</br>  <br> I would agree with that if Natsu hadn't defeated that one Tartaros member that had Purehito's full power even before the timeskip. Either way the power levels in Fairy Tail are completely fucked up trying to make sense out of it is pointless.<br><br> Just read it for the fanservice.</br></br></br>  <br>You don't seriously think this punch took him out, do you?</br>  <br>All that's happened is they've fended off a few attack from him, and punched him in the face once, and the next chapter's title is "Escape Battle". You're going to look completely retarded next week when he isn't beaten by Natsu's punch.</br>  <br>But he shouldnt have even been able to do that. A person who could toy with them was easily killed by someone on par with him.</br>  On another note,the anime team seems to love Franmalth.Must be easier to animate than Ezel.  <br>Different powersets. Plus Natsu could've just turned up his body heat and become untouchable to Marin if the fight had continued.</br>  <br> Giving a shit and trying to make sense of FT power levels instead of just being meta about it like Mashima <br><br>Are you kidding me? You gonna go /tg/ and /k/ on us next and cry about how half of Erza's armor sets aren't practical?</br></br></br>  <br>The person toying with them was able to do so due to having a hax power, not through actually overpowering them. And they probably weren't going all out either, just like they didn't try too hard at first against the treasure hunters back during the Sun Village arc. He didn't expect his boss to attack him either.</br>  <br>dat Wendy<br><br>I would not be surprised if Franmalth is easier to animate. He's kind of cartoony to start with, so some errors can go unnoticed.</br></br></br>  <br>Funny, I don't remember that part having body detail. Maybe I blinked and missed it before she was completely glowing.</br>  <br>Actually it's just what version you watched. The broadcast and Crunchyroll looked like this. <br><br>Funimation's stream on the other hand, looked like </br></br></br>  <br>Perfect Loli with the Perfect Haircut</br>  I almost can't get excited about FT anymore after reading Rave.<br>It's hard to think the same person who drew brutal deaths and shit like that created Fairy Tail.<br><br>Why did he change things with Fairy Tail compared to Rave Master?</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, I don't read FT anymore but damn if Wendy wasn't the best part when I still was.</br>  <br>Huh, weird. Wonder what else I've been missing.<br><br>I don't suppose Funi had Erza naked? A man can dream.</br></br></br>  <br>Tartaros master got fucked cause cats destroyed his magic shit, he fough makarov before, laxus, grey, erza and natsu still had to use double dragon fire/ thunder.</br>  <br>You mean Grimoire Heart. He's talking about Franmalth, who absorbed Hades's soul from his corpse.</br>  <br>yes and yes<br><br>anyway, bad guys jobbing is a FT stapple, been like that since the Oracion 6 arc, last time they had a decent non asspull fight was vs Jeral in the tower, and that 3 Vs 1 DragonSlayer vs mecha dragon in Edoras</br></br></br>  Doesn't waste a single panel without FS.<br><br>Fairy Law would've been better than crapping your pants,Makarov.</br></br>  <br>He should use Fairy Law on the whole fucking Alvarez Continent!</br>  <br><br>just use Fairy Heart</br></br>   holding back one of the big bosses without even needing to use the deus ex machina power of friendship <br>Cool writing, Mashima.<br><br>The art is continually getting more kawaii and sexual with every chapter. I can't stop reading it please help me.</br></br></br>  <br>But what if Zeref taught the others Spriggan Law?</br>  <br>Would be Law vs Law. It would be like an atom bomb... on Alvarez.</br>  What kind of asspull will Mashima give to FT to beat the Spriggan Warriors ? (apart from muh friendship ofc)  <br>No such luck with Erza. I doubt the DVDs will change that either seeing as it would mean multiple full frontal shots with Erza. A pity as when you actually look at things, it wouldn't be than difficult to uncensored her there. The shirt they gave her is basically skin tight at a bunch of points. <br><br>Anyways, I think the thing with Wendy is the only instance of censored vs uncensored in the series. So you haven't missed much.</br></br></br>  I want to see Makarov fighting again, he is not weak  <br>The one year of training the just had.</br>   A character says there's no way Fairy Tail could stand up to the new big bad <br> Fairy Tail stands up to the new big bad <br><br>My fucking god every single arc.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I wonder if he has the juice for it anymore. There was no excuse for him NOT to use it during the eclipse, when he was fresh and everyone was being literally slaughtered by mini-dragons. (Well, Future Rogue would've eaten it up and wrecked Natsu, but Makarov didn't know that.)</br>  <br>Do you seriously read it for anything other than the tits/asses ?</br>  <br>Zero was kinda good</br>  <br>I want Jellal to impregnate that already. Then he can go get Kagura pregnant too as a replacement for her brother.</br>  <br>Not even being a perv, but I really like the design of this outfit. Feels like I've seeen it somewhere before.</br>  <br> Feels like I've seeen it somewhere before. <br>EVERY<br><br>FUCKING<br><br>KOREAN<br><br>MMO</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See you next week :^)</br>  <br><br>Will the BDs have the uncensored version?</br></br>  <br>Jellal and Erza are probably the couple who would have the worst, most awkward and apology/hesitation laden sex. <br><br>Lucy and Natsu are bland as well but at least Natsu works on instinct and wouldn't second guess himself while Lucy is submissive enough to let him lead.<br><br>Then we start to get into the good shit with Gray and Juvia, Juvia being masochistic enough to draw out Gray's dominate side making every session an exploration for both of them.<br><br>Finally Levy/Gajeel, as everyone knows, is the top-tier coupling. You've got the sheer size difference on top of two partners who are mutually wild in the sack, getting all that daily tension and frustration out in nightly bouts of horizontal combat.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Jellal and Erza are probably the couple who would have the worst, most awkward and apology/hesitation laden sex.  <br><br> It always starts out slow with them hesitating. Jellal freezes up any time Erza makes a sound. <br> Erza for her part has no idea what to do or say and when she alternates between wanting to take the lead and just let him plow her </br></br></br></br>   guys you need to run dont even think about fighting hes way too strong for you! <br> one punch him <br>every time</br></br>  <br>Agree with all except Levy/Gajeel. Levy has been implied to be pretty submissive in the sack, with Gajeel's large frame probably making him clumsy in bed:<br> S-stop! Gajeel! You're... hurting me. <br> Ah?! Oh, right! Sorry, Levy. How about this-- <br> Ahhhhh! <br> Shit! Oh well, then, wait, just let me give it a... <br> Gajeel! It hurts! <br> Oh no! Levy! Just let me try-- <br> Ah...! <br> Levy! Does it still hurt? <br> Ahh... N-no... it... it feels good. <br> Eh? Oh, then... I'll just keep doing it like that. <br> Ahh... Gajeel... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was great story writing.</br>  <br> Meanwhile all of Crime Sorcerie is watching from the closet and getting pissed at their lack of progress <br><br>I can only imagine Jellal's guild is sick to death of him moping about whenever his red-headed crush is brought up. They'll have Meredy sensory link the two of them and then forcefeed her aphrodisiacs at the first opportunity.</br></br></br>  <br> They'll have Meredy sensory link the two of them and then forcefeed her aphrodisiacs at the first opportunity. <br>Every time I read about Meredy's ability I always think back to the  Wheel of Time  series.  Anime never.   ;_; </br></br>  <br> They'll have Meredy sensory link the two of them and then forcefeed her aphrodisiacs at the first opportunity. <br><br> This will never be an ero-doujin <br> You will never get to see Meredy writhing around in bed while lewdly describing the sensations she's feeling of both a male and female engaged in coitus <br><br>Fuck, there will never be any good FT Doujins period, I guess the artists consider it low hanging fruit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The scene where Bridgette and Mat go to get wasted to avoid noticing the awkward sex </br>  That feel when FT will be shit(ier) for several weeks as we advance into the "battle" phase.<br>Fug</br>  <br>Dump plz</br>  <br>Wait what the fuck?<br>Lushit can now merge with her spirits?</br></br>  So what does this mean for the other guilds? They've got to be about the same power level as FT, who is now the same power level as the gods. <br><br> inb4muhpowerlevels <br>Humor me a little here</br></br></br>  <br>I know Fairy Tail is shit, but i keep reading it.Fuck</br>  <br>She learned it during the year-long timeskip.</br>  Honestly, I wish Lucy and Natsu spent more time gradually getting Fairy Tail back. They got Wendy which was cool. They should've just gotten Gray and Juvia and moved onto another arc where they got the other main Fairy Tail members bit by bit. Hell, even a few minor ones.<br><br>Just spend some time tracking them all down THEN do this final arc. I'm sure it could've taken a good year or two to get them all. It seems a bit too soon for this final arc to happen.</br></br>  <br>This fucker is the real Hero. He brought Fairy Tail back. Not Lucy. Not Natsu. WARREN!</br>  I still don't get the whole disbanding of Fairy Tail thing. <br>Basically what happened is : Makarov disbands Fairy Tail. <br>One chapter later we're told everyone went their separate ways to train or w/e.<br>One chapter later they're back trying to reform the guild.<br>Then we learn that the whole disband has proven useless.<br>So basically this was just an excuse to make everyone overpowered ? <br>There's no substance to the story.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>fairy tail is well written and the story is very engaging and unpredictable</br>  <br>Once FACE was used, or should I say eradicated, basically the last of Fiore's major weapons had been used and Fiore was now ripe for Alvarez to take.<br><br>Alvarez wants to take over Fiore for one thing: Lumen Histoire which Fairy Tail has. Therefore Makarov disbanded Fairy Tail to keep the location of Lumen Histoire hidden. He decided to go to Alvarez to start negotiations with Emperor Spriggan. Only...the emperor wasn't there. He's basically spent the year getting chummy with the folks at Alvarez's court while waiting for the Emperor to return.<br><br>Meanwhile, the Fairy Tail Members are confused and conflicted, but have gone their own way and are making a name for themselves, whether in other guilds, the magic council, etc.. They pretty much decided they were tired of being separated and decided to reform the guild anyways, with Erza as the 7th Guild Leader.<br><br>Just around that time Emperor Spriggan finally returns...only we discover that Emperor Spriggan is none other than the Black Mage Zeref! (Dun Dun Dun!) He's decided to go and pull his hail mary and challenge Acnologia to a dual of all duels, while at the same time killing as many humans around him as possible. In other words whether it's the Black Mage or the Dragon King, whoever wins, we lose.<br><br>Does that help?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sand evaporated <br>Seriously? No one is going to comment on this bullshit?</br></br>  <br>No, because nobody is dumb enough to take this series seriously.</br>  <br> Seriously? No one is going to comment on this bullshit? <br><br>Well<br> natsu can create fire <br> natsu trained for one year <br> he now can create very hot fire <br> fire turns sand in glass <br> glass melt because of the heat and is being blown away by the blast <br>there you go</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So..yeah.<br><br>Everything Makarov did for that year was for naught. Because:<br>1) Fairy Tail is tight and they wanted to remain as a guild<br>2) Zeref has decided to go full throttle and become an enemy to humanity in hopes that SOMEONE will finally kill him.<br><br>And yeah...having Zeref be Emperor Spriggan only makes it so that Zeref is no longer a lone wolf in all of this.<br><br>My predictions:<br>Natsu vs. Zeref. Everyone else vs. Acnologia</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It does, thanks.<br>Two more questions : what is the goal of the "extermination" Zeref is planning ? <br>2nd question : did he not just return from a duel with Acnologia ? Why would he need a whole country to be on par with him anyways ?</br></br></br>  <br> what is the goal of the "extermination" Zeref is planning <br>For about half the manga up until now he was sad that everything that got near him died due to a curse around him. He was unable to stop this curse so eventually he decided that if he's cursed to have everything around him die, then the only way to bring himself inner peace is to kill everyone in the world too.<br><br> did he not just return from a duel with Acnologia ? Why would he need a whole country to be on par with him anyways ? <br>Because Acnologia is insanely strong, and he probably has his own army of dragons too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Natsu might hit a sand clone or Azeel is a sand logia. He's OK if they still have to run away next chapter, I guess.  <br>For question 1:<br><br>Zeref wants to die. He has always wanted to die. Ever since he failed to revive his brother and became cursed with his death powers he has been looking for a way to die. The demons he created were to kill him. Hell he created END to kill him. <br><br>Now for whatever reason, he's decided to cash in all his chips and put humanity on the line. which leads to question 2.<br><br>He did not duel Acnologia, he challenged him. He's basically saying, big shit's gonna go down so get ready. Zeref and Acnologia are gonna have a mighty tussle that will shake the world. If Acnologia wins, then he destroys everyone and everything to show how powerful he is. If Zeref wins, he starts destroying everyone and everything in hopes that someone, ANYONE will stop him...until Zeref himself is the only being left on this world.<br><br>As for your third question: I'm not entirely sure. I'll need to backtrack a bit on that one. But basically Zeref's using Alvarez as extra firepower to ensure that he gets Lumen Histoire, AKA Fairy Heart. Besides. No matter how powerful Zeref is, he's still just one man. Even he needs other people to help him cover more ground.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.</br></br>  http://orig07.deviantart.net/3b2c/f<wbr>/2015/206/b/6/acnologia_son_of_nats<wbr>u_lucy__lh__zeref_theory_by_nina211<wbr>9-d92sd4a.png</wbr></wbr></wbr>  <br> tfw you will never get crushed by Lucy's fat ass  <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Side boobs and ass really are a miracle of the Universe.<br><br>Thank you Universe.<br><br><br> Mashina can even make mummies look hot as fuck </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> They've got to be about the same power level as FT <br>Saber has Sting and Edgelord<br>Mermaid has Kagura<br>Lamia has Jura<br>And that's it, literally no one else comes close to the powerlevel of a scrub FT member</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Edgelord <br>His name is Rogue and you don't even understand him and the things he's been through.</br></br>  <br>dat Flare</br>  <br> http://orig07.deviantart.net/3b2c/<wbr>f/2015/206/b/6/acnologia_son_of_nat<wbr>su_lucy__lh__zeref_theory_by_nina21<wbr>19-d92sd4a.png</wbr></wbr></wbr> <br><br>thats bullshit but KINDA makes sense since acnologia fears END but still bullshit.</br></br></br>  <br> that's not lucy </br>    Would you be willing to declare war on an entire continent of mages just to get your hands on her?  <br>Mavis life really sucked</br>  <br>Any place to get Funi rips from? With CR often having broken motion I wonder if Funi would be a better source.</br>  <br>Pretty good summary, but you missed one thing. Etherion still exists, but until the Council was rebuilt, they couldn't actually use it. One thing Makarov was intending to do was stall for time for them to rebuild. That turned out to be unnecessary as Albareth didn't do anything for a year anyways and the Council was rebuilt in the meantime. However Serena's defection might render the Council unable to fire Etherion until they replace him.</br>  <br>They're no closer than they were before the 1 year time skip when Fairy Tail was the #1 guild. <br><br>Sabertooth has<br>Sting<br>Rogue<br>Minerva<br>Yukino<br>Rufus<br>Orga<br><br>And only Sting and Rogue are guaranteed to get enough of a power increase to stay relevant, though Minerva and Yukino have a greater chance of that than Rufus and Orga.<br><br>Lamia Scale has<br>Leon<br>Chelia<br><br>Jura left for the Council, and Leon's minions have never really been all that relevant. <br><br>And that's pretty much it. Mermaid Heel just has Kagura, for Blue Pegasus that Fried and Bixlow are easily taking over as the aces of the guild should tell you how relevant the rest of the membership is. Quatro Puppy just has Bacchus, and he isn't all that worthwhile either. <br><br>Everyone else are scrubs, and pretty much always have been.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  fuck off fairytards  <br> tells us to fuck off <br> bumps the thread </br></br>  <br>okay then</br>  <br>Almost certainly. If Funimation already has an uncensored version, there shouldn't be any reason to not use it for the home video release. <br><br><br>Unfortunately I don't know of any place to get Funi rips from.

I did, however, see a cute Tama cosplayer and had the Ruuko and Tama Nendroids bought from right under my nose. I'll be getting that new Tamayorihime fig for sure though.

I'm sure the thread will last for a couple days.</br>        How did the Midoriko guy to become an eternal girl?    <br>Is it a GK?</br>  I didn't know Ulith had this kind of assets to. What is she planning? Making people loathe themselves because of her music? Damn she is awesome.  So I watched first season, greatly enjoyed episodes 7/8 but then it declined. Didn't watch second season, heard it sucked.<br><br>Is there any reason to be hype?</br></br>  WEBXOSS now has a replay mode, also here's a couple of winning decklists from a WPS<br>http://pastebin.com/3MZcC5F2#6030</br>  <br>Because it's mostly guaranteed Destructed will FIX something in both Spread and Infected.  Or that's what at least we hope </br>  <br>Not for you, apparently. Enjoy your deconstruction ending and stay deluded.</br>  <br>Is this a new meme?<br><br>Another anon said the same thing in the last thread.</br></br></br>  <br>Ruu is cute</br>  <br>Hype for OKADA and maybe a manga cameo in the movie. <br><br>I honestly enjoyed spread, I don't think it was a masterpiece or anything like that but it definitely was my autumn 2014 AOTS. Wixoss threads were fun too.</br></br></br>  So it was supposed to have a 3rd cour where it went 100% relentlessly grimdark but they pussied out, right?<br><br> Right? </br></br>  WHAT DOES IT MEAN!?<br>WHAT DOES IT FUCKING MEAN!?</br>  <br> Hype for OKADA and maybe a manga cameo in the movie. <br> Spin-off cameo in a movie <br>Neither Oriko or Kazumi related stuff appeared in Madoka Magica. I already lost all my faith in that happening yet Takara Tommy guys could do something since they are so fucking based, like in the end of Spread.</br></br></br>  Speaking of Okada, since these threads often devolved into talking about her.<br><br>Is anyone here hype for Mobile Okada Gundam: TEKKETSU?</br></br>  <br>It can't really be worse than the last couple of Gundams.</br>  <br>I'm definitely going to watch it, even though I haven't watched any other Gundam</br>  <br>Yes I am. Everyone shits on M3 so I do, but there are literally a few good things in the series meanwhile I was watching it I was thinking how nice it would be if Gundam had them and now I just need to wait.</br>  H Y P E <br>I N T E N S I F I E S</br>  <br> city in ruins <br>WHAT COULD THIS MEAN</br></br>  <br><br>That the city got destructed, obviously.</br></br>  Is it okay if I can label Studio Pablo amazing work as somekind of Impressionism?    <br>Is this a good idea? I've always been curious about Gundam so I might give it a shot as well.</br>  <br>The backgrounds in Onslaught of the End were fantastic</br>  <br>This is bullshit!</br>  <br>Are you sure?</br>  I want to fuck Piruruk.  <br>S-Stop.</br>    <br> different filename <br>Off yourself m8<br><br><br>There we go.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes please.</br>  I want to fuck Ulith  <br>But Ulith doesn't seem interesed in feelings. She is most likely to use you as a fucking pawn then get rid of you in the most convenient moment.</br>  <br>as long as my dick goes in it at some point, that's fine by me.</br>  <br> inserting dick in a sociopath </br>  How many tickets will be sold?  <br>I think it depends of the number of people who plays WIXOSS in Japan.</br>  Just be honest on this one. What is WIXOSS's truly appeal to you?<br>What charmed you one year ago to this threads?</br>  <br><br>all dem bitches be cray cray</br></br>  <br>Honestly?<br><br>The cute grills in the pic, and eventually  the incest </br></br></br>  I'm still waiting Fanbook scans.<br> ;_; </br>  <br> pic related <br>Also suffering.</br></br>  <br>Yes. What about you?</br>  <br>I don't actually remember. I might have just been interested by the summary and watched it since nothing else is coming to mind as a possible reason.</br>  <br> Waiting for the OST </br>  first time playing webxoss and nip guy quit on me after my first move<br><br>Where do I git gud enough to ride with the nips?</br></br>  <br>Seems like you will have to wait a couple of years for the Movie's OST now.  So I will. What is your favorite track? </br>  <br> Haven't listened to it in a while. Probably 15, can't beat the tanoshii.  <br><br>Has anyone ever uploaded the second OST on nyaa?</br></br></br>  <br>I was waiting for someone to upload it in .FLAC but I keep waiting. But as far as I know it seems it never happened but you could easily find Spread's OST in a couple of seconds.</br>    <br> I was waiting for someone to upload it in .FLAC <br>That's what I was waiting for. I remember someone said something about it.</br></br>      <br>fun</br>    Remember when this happened?  <br>Who is that boy?</br>  <br>A big guy.</br>    <br>For  Ru u</br>  <br>Only because same director as  Toradora. </br>  <br>Yuzuki and when we said Ruuko was going to destroy the world through a misinterpreted tetris reference.</br>  <br>I love how much overlap there is between Wixoss, YuYuYu and Symphogeah!? fanbases. In can drop in on any thread and know Im in for a good time, every time. <br><br><br><br>I wonder if we will ever get anything out of this or the Ruu is scary hints from season one in the new movie</br></br></br></br></br>    Mayu is so fucking cute. I would teach her the wonders of life.  <br>The concept seemed interesting. Really loved the series at first, was in almost every thread and wanted to watch the fanbase expand with stuff on the games. As it went on and the second season came out, it got less and less enjoyable as a whole.</br>  BATORU!  WE<br>CRY<br>"OPEN"</br></br>    WE CRY NOPAN  <br><br><br>I don't follow</br></br></br>  <br> looking forward to an anime that only exists to promote trading cards <br>Oh, how the mighty have fallen.</br></br>  <br>It seems you are not aware of the virtous circle of anime and commercial production.</br>  <br>My wish is that you "wouldn't" skip the opening</br>  KING OF GAMES!    Go nuts!  <br>I tried.</br>  <br>Oh, it's from S2. No wonder.</br>  <br>I hope we get the second season soon. I can't wait to see Iona corrupt Ruuko and crazy-ass Urisu shenanigans.</br>  <br> Everyone ignoring Iona <br> This scene <br> Mayu is a vengeful ghost with tulpas <br> Akira is a poorfag that gets beat on <br> Yuzuki upset a trading card is fucking her brother instead of her <br> How Ruuko solved Mayu's pick the correct card trick <br> After she gets Tama back, Yuki is barely acknowledged and isn't even in the ending sequence  <br>Spread was too funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wouldn't have minded the plot if they just kept the tanoshii.<br><br>You had one fucking job, Okada.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, instead of eldritch abomination Tama like infected showed, we get a deviant art recolor.</br>  <br>Tomorrow, with the spin-off in HQ and re/verse pics.</br>  Nice, a Wixoss thread!  The show doesn't even explain how the card game works  <br>Get your ass ready for some glorious backgrounds.</br>  <br>I saw episode one and picked it up because of the backgrounds.<br>Okada shenanigans were pretty fun too even if Spread wasn't as good as Infected.</br></br>  <br>You shoot lasers until your opponent has no clothes left.</br>  I still have hopes for another anime adaptation. <br>I want to believe.</br>  <br>All the foreshadowing. Which, unfortunately, never went anywhere.</br>    <br> that scene <br>Ruu is a genius.</br></br>    <br>a.pomf.se/wmyujv.webm<br><br>I miss it.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I love Tama.</br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Tama was supposed to stay corrupted, and Ulith was supposed to be the actual final villain, but for some reason they dropped it and threw in the shitty Mayu hikkikomori ghost plot at the last second.<br><br>I mean Ulith was developed as a major antagonist much longer than Mayu even existed in the story. Mayu herself was never developed as anything other than a plot device until like the last 3 episodes of Spread, and everything related to her was retarded. Ulith was shown to match and surpass Ruuko by both crushing Tama's will and getting level 5 on a whim, and winning the match between them. She gets a wish from Tama which they went pretty far out of their way in Infected to point out was a big deal. Hell, Ulith even went as far as saying her goal was to keep using Tama to make people suffer.<br><br>And yet none of it is capitalized on whatsoever. Dark Tama is never touched on again. Ulith suddenly doesn't care about battling other selectors anymore. Tama's wish is wasted and never becomes relevant. Ulith subjugates herself to Mayu for literally no fucking reason, and thus her beating Ruuko is never resolved. And then there was the entire batshit retarded fucking finale with two Mayus and all the other assorted bullshit.<br><br>It's very clearly not what Okada intended for the ending, and if I were her I'd be fucking livid that the studio pulled that level of retardation when her name is on the project.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I want to fuck Mayu.  <br>Something clearly wasn't right in Spread. It lacked a lot of the finesse in the production that Infected had. It was even stated in an interview published while Infected was airing that they were having diffuculties. I'm now wondering if things were changed to accommodate Destructed. I don't think that Spread was terrible, it just wasn't as good as Infected. I rewatched it and I picked up on a lot of subtile plot points that I missed the first time round.</br>  <br>More like belive in Takara Tommy.</br>  <br>Spread has way too many major plot holes for it not to be considered terrible, and general stupid shit like Akira's entire handling as a character.</br>  Best LRIG.  <br>Akira was great to watch in Infected. Seeing her destroy Hitoe and Yuzuki were my favourite moments. She was always an emotional wreck with a fragile ege, this was highlighted in Peeping Analyze. I didn't like the way her break down was portrayed in Spread but it wasn't unexpected.</br>  <br>This kills the series.</br>  <br> It didn't go full edgelord like I expected <br> major plot hole </br></br>  I want this card, but forwarding services don't ship tickets and even if they did, from what I have gathered, you can only recieve ticket at the cinema. I am tempted to fly to Japan.  <br> signs all over the place <br> didn't deliver </br></br>  <br>It was definitely what Okada intended, but I don't think the execution of most of the middle was up to her standards. It's very clear that wixoss was intended to be two cour from the start, and it's equally clear that the series as a whole was meant to be a dichotomy of black and white (among other things), which leads to the deduction that she knew that the true ending of spread would be a happy one with redemption from the beginning. <br><br><br>Most of what you're thinking of aren't plot holes. You might call some of them dropped threads, but in the story that happened, everything makes sense and is justified, or else can be understood from context and a little bit of thinking.</br></br></br></br>  It's time to summoning HIM.  <br>He was already here. He's too busy to translate the latest re/verse chapter.</br>  <br>Summon harder.</br>   Most tomboy LRIG is actually the cutest girl <br>Why is this allowed to happen?</br>  <br>Because the production team were Piruluk-and Midoriko-fags. That's the reason why the WIXOSS specials feature these two.</br>  Shitoe a Hitoe.  <br>I really really hope Okada doesn't put someone like Hitoe in the new Gundam. Damnit, Hitoe should have follow the same pattern in development like Mahmu.</br>  <br><br>You opponent have seven magical LEDs, you sexy Lrig need destroy every LED with a Rock-paper-scissors combination of cards</br></br>  <br><br>Why is there german dub of Wixoss?<br><br>Are there german edition of wixoss TCG</br></br></br></br>  <br>Ask that to the german wixossfag.</br>  <br>Thank you based Anon.</br>  <br>I'm so mad the promo card from vol 2 is another remember.

Shame Ruuko pulled a poor man's Madoka in the end.</br>   shee sees your deck   <br> new wixoss watchers will never realize Okada's greatness in playing with our expectations of a shitty Madoka ending before steering the ending in the exact opposite direction </br>  <br> everyone praying for S2 <br> that fucking selector [spread] WIXOSS </br></br>  Do you think Okada will finally deliver in Re/verse?        <br>S1 was fun, S2 wasn't as good as S1 but had some good roller coaster moments. Reacting with /a/ was the best part. In the end, another example of Okada doing decent until the ending.</br>  <br>wait, who the hell is that?</br>    <br>Yuzuki was unintentionally getting shit on by Ruuko almost constantly since they met, it's actually pretty funny.<br> stomping Yuzuki hard in the first episode <br> asks her she doesn't want to finish their batoru next episode <br> Yuzuki says there's no way she could beat Akira <br> "I'll battle her!" <br> Yuzuki clearly doesn't want to go to the card shop <br> "I want to go!" <br> proceeds to get friendly with Kazuki and turn Yuzuki into the third wheel <br> bums a free card off of them and gets complimented for being good at a game she just started playing the day before <br><br>It's no wonder Yuzuki snapped.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember did nothing wrong.</br>  <br>Yes, she fucked everything up perfectly.</br>  Remember is worse than Ulith.

Goddamn, I always miss WIXOSS threads and turn up when they're like halfway through. </br>  <br>Probably the incest too, actually, for reasons others described before.<br>But the reason I stayed all the way up until now is definitely the community that formed here.

It's the only colour she doesn't cover at all.    <br>I saw the OP image of Hitoe suffering when she was the first one to get her wish reversed. And I'm a sucker for "games with high stakes" even if it's bad, so I watched it and the opening got me hooked and I fell in love with Ruuko.<br><br>Man, I wish I could watch season 1 again for the first time.

The twins are fucking nuts. Next chapter is going to be good.  This spin-off is really great.</br>  should i watch this  <br>Yes. Just don't expect the second cour to be at the height of the first one, but shit's good.</br>  <br>thank you anon</br>  <br> Is the whole chapter focused on just battling the twins? And do we get any development between Yuragi and Alfou after that flashback chapter?  Either way, I'm looking forward to it. Thanks for the update!<br><br> filename <br>Will Yuragi ever come to her senses?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Yep, it's only focusing on the battle, and the next chapter will be too. No development yet, Yuragi just says that she trusts Alfou as her partner, and that they'll talk after the battle. But we finally see Alfou's grow form. </br>  <br> And the twins are a whole new level of nuts. And they're confirmed for fucking each other. </br>  <br>Wait a minute, what's up with that tail? She doesn't have anything like that in any other art.  I-is that a buttplug? </br>    <br>What???

Best show KyoAni ever made.</br>  JOJO  <br>Nice meme friend.</br>  <br>yahari<br><br>it seems the entire goal of this "satirical romantic comedy" is that its literally written on the premise that its only pretending to be a romantic comedy despite being neither romantic nor funny.<br><br>the MC is literally his own cockblock and he can't take a hint, he over analyzes everything and half the show's dialogue is wasted on just stupid pointless talking.</br></br></br></br></br>  I have notice some lack of this threads in /a/  Good, because now they're filled with the kind of shit that you've decided to start off with.  <br>Motherfucking this<br><br>Also, is there any godtier mango like that one ?</br></br></br>  <br>Or that one ?</br>  Remember, don't leave your imouto alone too long. She might slut it up with your best friend  That's what you get, you cheating harlot  <br>Onii-chan did nothing wrong. Fuck that little slut.</br>  <br>Onii-chan was not giving his imouto the proper amount of love, so she looked for it elsewhere. Everyone in that manga was in the wrong</br>  Same author as Nichibros  Probably because everyone is tired of all the /v/ermin and reddit fucks who come straight to them and complain nonstop about being told to conform or leave.  <br>This manga was trying so hard to make the MC out to be the bad guy though<br> How dare you get angry at your best friend for fucking your elementary school sister! <br> Wow, you won't let them date despite only being at least 10 years apart? <br> It's your fault our deadbeat father left us because you kept calling him out on being a deadbeat! <br> You're working hard to support me and get an education, but since you're not spending enough time with me I'm going to go have sex with your friend! </br></br></br></br></br>      <br>I know what you are trying to say, but that doesn't mean that every character in that manga isn't a piece of shit<br> Onii-chan is brutally honest, and works to hard for his sister <br> Imouto is growing up and wants to be loved, and given that onii-chan is always working, seduces his friend instead <br> Friend is an idiot for letting an elementary schooler seduce him, the only good thing he did was not come back in the end <br> Dad was a complete deadbeat who abandoned his children because his son called him out on it. <br>Yes, a lot of emphasis is put on MC being a piece of shit, but that is just to distract you from the rest of the cast being fuckers too</br></br></br></br></br></br>  How about that  suffering ?  <br>That was my point, MC is hardly the bad guy in the story. Sure, he's a pretty unpleasant guy but everyone else is just as bad or worse.</br>  C A N O N<br>A<br>N<br>O<br>N</br></br></br></br>     tfw   the magazine fell through and the story never got picked back up   <br>This is such a depressing manga. Sure, the artstyle looks cute, but damn. Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. The MC is a hardworking, but hard to like guy who just wants to care for his sister. The friend is a victim of circumstance.</br>    Be gentle when you dump the crazy ones  <br>The real kicker is that she get's off scot-free after shanking her ex-boyfriend in front of his sister. Sure, she's in a psych ward, but there were really no consequences for her</br>  <br> victim of circumstances <br><br>Yeah how can We blame him, it's just a peadophile that banged his best friend's little sister who's in elementary school behind his back while that friend worked his ass off for the only family that's left for him. (Yeah the pure little girl that the victim of circumstances deflored)</br></br></br>  <br>Used goods like her won't even sell at a clearance sale.</br>    <br> Woman cut her hair.  <br><br>Didn't read but dropped.</br></br></br>  <br>Ok, let me rephrase. He was a victim of circumstance, right up until he kept their relationship going. If he had cut her off after the first time she seduced him, I would have more sympathy. But, as it turns out, little girl pussy is just too dank.</br>  <br>You shut the fuck up. She was more pure than your waifu.</br>  Let's get some decent pages going and not endless boring conversations over 8 panels.  If there is a third, I hope MC stops being such a massive faggot, and gives in to the crazy, qt, time bending mothgirl  Getting people into Mx0 knowing the ending.<br><br>YOU MONSTER FRISBEE</br></br>  <br>  Fuck you  </br>  <br>I'm sorry, I can't hear you over the sound of  heart-breaking suffering </br>  <br>Fuck.<br><br>You.<br><br> ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Everyone should read it just to condemn japan for their shit taste.<br><br><br>What's the author up to these days ? Still making oneshots because all his series are getting cancelled ?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Someone dropped that little gem in a father's day thread. I was caught flatfooted, and I fucking cried like a bitch.</br>  <br>Gets me everytime</br>  <br>Fuck. You. Anon. Fuck you right in your stupid face</br>  <br>Why does anyone read this shit series?</br>  <br>There are two hints in the biggest panel.</br>  How about, instead of suffering, some tall girls instead?  i don`t get it   fucks waifus and they came <br> turns strong men gar in the pants <br> even hot aunt is beginning to succumb to the true Genji power <br><br>Minamoto is the harem king we need</br></br></br></br>  <br>Posting a better page from later on when it gets a bit less lewd that isn't a downscaled jpeg from some reader site, because more people should read this series.</br>    <br>He fucked a girl in elementary school. He is not a victim of circumstance.</br>  <br> Anime never <br> Maybe it's a good thing </br></br>  <br>Updates when?</br>  <br>No, you are not a victim of circumstance even if you are only once seduced by an elementary school student.</br>  <br>Play Persona Q.</br>  <br>Never ever.</br>        Nothing makes my heart go doki-doki quite like stupid vampire girls falling in love            <br>Yeah, so sad she died.</br>  <br>It's really ambiguous, but there is no evidence to say whether she survived or not. For all we know, she died, and he's burning incense, and he see's her ghost. On the flip side of that, maybe the white hair is from the stress of her surgery, he's cooking and she just came home.</br>  <br>I'll never get why didn't the MC jump all over her. Guess that his charm was not being like everyone else but then again, what was the point?</br>    <br>so first I thought maybe they weren't actually fucking, maybe just some kissing or whatever. then she drops the bomb when she talks to him later about how when she grows up, it'll stop hurting when they have sex.</br>  <br>They're both nude. There was definately some little girl sexing going on here. Plus the look of shame the friend is giving off, and the horror on imouto's face</br>  <br> Naked on the bed <br> Maybe they weren't actually fucking <br>Anon, you can't possibly be this dense.</br></br></br>  <br> she means walk me home gently </br>  <br> walk her home gently  <br>every fucking time</br></br>  <br>maybe he spilled coffee on both their clothes so their only choice was being nude</br>    <br>My little anon can't possibly be this dense</br>  <br>This is such nonsense. He did what he could given how busy he was. His friend is a huge asshole for calling him immature and shit. He was, at first, but manned up when his retarded dad (who explained nothing) took the advice of a child and left.<br><br>Fuck, I'm still mad.</br></br></br>    <br>at least the omakes at the end served as a sort of palate cleanser after reading that mess.</br>    <br>HE COULD'VE SAVED HER</br>  <br>This. It's only good when it's against their will and it upsets them.</br>  <br>She even asked for salvation with those subtle "let's just go out"</br>  <br>Ah, yuri: just what I want from my trap manga.<br><br>Prunus Girl went to shit way too fast. Had great potential too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah, they were worth reading to calm down. Plus, ending with yuri was good. I fucking love yuri.</br></br>  <br>The novelty wore off pretty quick. Though it was a happy end.</br>  <br>I this worth the read?</br>              <br>I'll riot if this doesn't end in happiness.<br><br>C'mon, you've got an infinite amount of time to get it right moth-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>This manga is fucking hilarious. Love the scumbag MC who has a thigh fetish.</br>      <br>Moth-chan chose a shit husbando, if he'll run away from her like that, and call her a monster. Then again, she did off his mom because she got in the way.<br> That lying fucking title <br>I thought it was going to be happy, with moth-chan actually being pregnant</br></br></br>    He did not deserve anything that happened to him in this arc.  ;_;       <br>no, its strange ive been here for 5 years and ive almost never seen a /a/ talk about this manga even though it has good art, good story, an anime adoption, neat /k/ stuff, gooks actually looking like gooks and is still ongoing</br>          <br>Is this Naze Toudouin Seiya 16-sai wa Kanojo ga Dekinai no ka? I searched by the guy's name but I'm not sure.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>name?</br>  <br>Sauce, yandex and reverse gives nothing.</br>  This manga made me fucking sob. Not light crying, actual sobs of pain.      <br>Reiroukan Kenzai Nariya.<br><br>Yes they do.</br></br></br>        <br>I love this one, mostly because every tradition and custom in the manga is so familiar to me since I'm  Turkish . Especially this part made me cry so much.</br>  <br>dont forget shes not wearing the right season uniform</br>      <br>thanks</br>    <br>So was she a normal girl possessed by something?</br>    <br>This guy looks like I wouldn't mess with him.</br>    whatever you do, don't click on the image    <br>Fuck, i can't remember the name for this.<br><br>The girls name starts with a K right?</br></br></br>    The NTR    <br> short as fuck <br> still taking forever to scanlate <br> some smartass translated just the ending for some reason <br>This happens far too often.</br></br></br></br>      <br>Kyoko</br>    <br>GYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br><br>Doesn't Alibaba get shit on every arc though? I mean man, I stopped reading a while back, but he was always going though tough shit.</br></br>  <br>There's a TTGL manga?</br>  <br> Honestly, the biggest villain is either the imouto or the dad. <br>The girl is really selfish, but all kids are like that. There isn't any "real" villain, except the dad. They were trying to make him likeable, but he's still a piece of shit.</br></br>    <br>First arc is the worst so far, at least from what I've seen. I'm not caught up yet though, gotta read 60 or so chapters. This guy had it bad too.</br>  <br>This any good?</br>  <br>Luruku Mo Aru</br>  <br>holy fuck</br>    <br>Damn, you got me</br>  <br>He left because his son called him out on being a piece of shit, and his daughter got sick of hearing it. Why the fuck would you let your daughter, who is elementary school, push you out of your own fucking house? Jesus christ, the dad is a piece of shit</br>  <br>Well... I'll just tell you, you will feel the need of droping it every now and then</br>  <br>I may check it out then.</br>  <br>btw is in hiatus either by the translators or the mangaka</br>    <br>That's not a great sign, but thanks for the head's up.</br>  <br>This manga sure was a emotional rollercoster</br>  <br>fuck that manga and the most beta MC i've ever had the displeasure of reading</br>  <br>Yep. Basically, Kanda and the dad are human cockroaches.<br>I mean, the imouto told the dad to get out of the house so he can have peace from his chucklefuck son. Okay. But did he use the time out to search for a job and come back home ? Nope. Goin to rest in the mountains. He didn't even give a fuck about his son.<br>Kanda has by far the worst personality, he always puts up a good front and seems like a nice guy, and he's a little shit with no sense of responsibility or self control. And he still calls out MC, a "normal" teen (He isn't more of an asshole than your average 16 years old), on his being immature and shit.</br></br></br>    <br>This manga was really good. Wish it was shorter; there was too much nothing and unnecessary drama.</br>  <br> I think I may "love" this series for discussions about it. Everyone always sounds so passionate about their fury and interpretation can be varied. It's kind of exceptional. </br>  I hoping this thread is the best place to ask but I need help to find 2 mangas I read ages ago.<br><br>One was about a ninja girl who fell in love with a normal guy but the whole ninja clan ended up staying in the guys house they also made the :x face a lot.<br><br>The other I only read the start but it was where a guy was really good at playing piano (I think) but then ended up meeting a girl and doing drugs.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Even ignoring the fact that he didn't immediately run out of the house when confronted with a naked loli, and continued their fucking relationship, and then calls out MC on being a piece of shit. The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop<br>This manga tries so hard to make it seem like MC is the one at fault, when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit.</br></br>  <br>Second one is Bokura no Henbyoushi. The piano and drugs thing is only the first part, it's a collection of short stories.</br>  <br>Interesting read. I wonder what fate the prostitute will have. My gut tells me not good, and he'll have something to do with it.</br>  <br>Yeah, me too. I reread it a while ago, and the way the manga was made also enrages me. It's really pushing the MC as a selfish, unlikeable asshole when he's right about everything.<br>  He's still an asshole for forgetting his imouto's BDay  </br></br>  <br> when everyone in the cast is a piece of shit. <br>The little girl did nothing wrong. She's just a child, and had to shoulder crushing responsibility, which she did. Everything she did that was "wrong" should have been taken care of by the adults :<br>Kanda shouldn't have fucked her<br>Dad shouldn't have listened to her about getting out of the house<br> The only good thing Kanda did was not come back at the train stop <br>His way of doing things is absolutely despicable.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. Yes, the adults should've acted like adults. But she was the one who seduced Kanda and she was the one who told the dad to leave. She is also at fault here.</br>  <br>Even if his method of leaving was despicable, it was still the only respectable thing Kanda did throughout the entire manga</br>  <br>Well, he also helped out the MC a bit after the dad left.</br>  <br> Not-Kuro looking to sensei as a father figure in the authors next work. <br>I've always loved the relation ship between the teacher and Kuro, glad it's getting more focus in the next work.<br> even if the main guy and not-rin are boring as shit. </br></br></br>  <br>I really did feel that she was the most venomous character in the series. I realize it was because she was a product of her environment and I hope she got the therapy/help she needed after all was said and done.</br>  <br>Updates when. Chapter 11 raws should be out by now. I wanna see the two childhood friends fuck already.</br>  <br>I hope there's a third as well. Would love to see the MC get his mind broken and just fuck the moth girl for all eternity. I still have no clue what the fuck was going on though</br>  <br>And that makes up for all the other shit he pulled?</br>  <br> Just because she's a little girl doesn't mean she's exempt from responsibility. <br>Kinda does actually. She was even younger when both these things happened. And having a crush/trying to seduce an older teen is quite frequent among children. And it's always brushed off as a joke by the target of the affection. It just took a kiss for Kanda to lose self control and stick it in her.<br>She just told the dad to leave. It wasn't an order, but an advice. Dude booked it the second he heard her say that. Usually this would be followed by the dad telling the girl about why he can never abandon his children. But no. He listened to a 9 year old and left.<br>And keep in mind that for Kanda, she was desperate for affection, she has excuses.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Given what happened in the second part, mindbreak is the only possible way moth-chan will have a happy ending, given faggot-kun's actions</br>  <br>It seems like the MC is stuck in some sort of time loop, like he's constantly reliving getting raped as a kid by a moth girl every single day...at least I think that is what's going on</br>  <br>Is IB a light novel or a manga original?</br>  <br>No, just saying.</br>  <br>Moth-chan is reverting time whenever he comes back. But I don't think his mom has ever come into the shed before. Something might have changed</br>  <br>From what I understand, she reverses time each time he returns, so she fucks him as a kid, he runs, 10 years later he gets headaches and returns, and she reverses time again to make him a kid.<br>It's like steins;gate, but instead of repeating time to save tuturu shes rewinding time to fuck the shota.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but to say she did "nothing wrong" is just false. She was the reason for everything that happened. But she shouldn't be blamed for it, I blame the environment she was raised in. Mainly her Dad though, if he just gave a little bit more of a shit about his family this wouldn't have happened.</br>  <br>People don't magically obtain the burden the burden of 'responsibility' on their eighteenth birthday. It's a gradual process where their family and society slowly raise the bar and more is expected of them. Whether or not a person is 'responsible' for something is complicated function.</br>  <br> But she shouldn't be blamed for it <br>Yeah sorry that's what I meant to say.<br>And I get she can be kind of scary as a child, and that now her personality's all fucked up, but she's still functional.</br></br></br>  <br>Barely. I'll be surprised if her tryst's with Kanda haven't made her dependant on using sex to get affection.</br>  <br><br>So basically if I'm right about this:<br><br>-He gets headaches like you said and decides to go back to his childhood home to find out what happened to him in the past<br>-He finds a shed in his parents backyard, where in which his headaches start getting progressively worse <br>-He enters the shed and meets the moth girl<br>-Moth girl rapes him in the present<br>-After he starts crying about how she was the cause of his problems, she reverts time back to the day he was raped as a child. <br>-He runs away as a kid<br><br>Going forward to the newest part of the doujin<br><br>-Once again the MC is back heading toward the shed, suffering from the same issues he had in the first one  basically once he left time reverted back to the present <br>-He enters the shed again and the same thing happens, although this time Moth Girl reverts time back to when he was a kid before she rapes him<br>-She proceeds to rape him as a kid<br>-As the kid is crying his ass off, his mother shows up, something that didn't happen before in the previous time loop<br>-The Moth girl panics and causes something to attack the mother. <br>-The kid runs from the moth girl and goes to rescue his mom<br>-Time once again reverts back to the present, where the MC is about to enter the shed yet again<br><br>so its like the MC is literally stuck in a timeloop put upon by the moth girl so that she can break him in so that he can fuck her for the rest of his life. However the mom showing up was interesting, as that didn't happen in the previous time warp in the first doujin. So I am assuming that different things will happen the more the moth girl reverses time...or something</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>      <br>Manga  but it gets shittier as the story goes on. </br>  <br>I'm guessing that there are slight variations each time, and this has happened before as the moth said "again... you are interfering again".<br><br>I'm guessing she keeps trying until she gets a timeline where he stop running away and he becomes hers.</br></br></br>  <br>If she'd been 12 or more at the time she told her dad to fuck off and kissed Kanda, I'd agree.<br>However, this wasn't the case. She was still a kid and there was absolutely no one who dared to say "Nah you're full of shit, you still have a lot to learn"<br>She was raised to be a substitute housewife, and that caused her to think that she's always right about how to handle the house better. She was alone all the time in her house except for Kanda, and when she did what could be called a gesture of desperation and yearning for affection, instead of giving her the usual speech about love and stuff, he gave the child a good dicking.<br>She isn't responsible for anything.<br><br>You might be right.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> How much is translated, I've only found up to chapter 9. <br> It's not as good, but it's still bearable. </br></br>  <br>Hopefully if the author decides to make another one, which might possibly happen, we'll defiantly get a mindbreak ending, where in which the MC in the present just gives himself to the moth girl</br>  <br> There hasn't been translations after that chapter, only raws </br>  <br>It seemed pretty clear in the epilogue that she hadn't been fucking anyone since then, though.</br>    <br>Let's be honest here, she's going to keep him as a shota sex slave for eternity.<br> Every time he ages past a certain point she just reverts back to him being a kid. <br> I love how a OPT turned into a discussion about the plot of a moth girl hentai. <br><br><br> Does it get worse? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its just so insane how this hentai doujin is. Yeah the moth girl is fucking hot and all that, but god damn is the plot drawing me in. Like I wanna see what shit the moth girl is gonna pull next</br>  <br> It does, sadly. Hopefully someone can pick it up so you can see for yourself. </br>  <br> How so? does the MC stop being an edgy faglord because of the power of friendship or some shit. <br> &gt;Last translation like 7 months ago.<br>It's dead isn't it.</br> </br></br>    <br>I said i'll be surprised.

I am new here.  bump  It's shit.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>You're shit.</br>  No Im@s thread; then lets make one.<br><br>Did /a/ enjoy the top cake?</br></br>  Momoka deserves better  <br>Momoka who?</br>    <br>Hopefully they didn't use up Hayamin's entire budget for this episode.<br><br>(At least let her have a Yuki no Hana scene.)</br></br></br>  <br>  Yuki no Hana  <br><br>That was just a requested cover song part of the Jewelries series of CDs. (It was also covered by Imai and Chiaking in the old im@s radio, but nobody remembers that anymore.) <br><br>Point is, It's not an im@s song. Why would they put it in the anime?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Why would they put more Kaede in the anime? <br>A question requiring no answer.</br></br>    Why is the 2011 anime so much better than CG? Excluding any Kaede screentime, of course.  anyone has the theory image of usamin's old age and her song explanation of her depression?  <br>I agree. The first one was so much more enjoyable to watch. CG is only worth watching because of pic-related.</br>  <br><br>Because it lacks more Kaede and Ranko. It really should just have those two on screen at all times.</br></br>  I want to rock her world, all night.  <br><br>She'll get her time soon, with plenty of Natsuki and jelly Miku.</br></br>    <br>Aiko's so sweet, too bad she's so underrated.</br>  <br>I would like to get to know her cute friend better.</br>  <br><br><br> Riina's panty status: moist </br></br></br>  <br><br>Riina wasn't the only one with wet panties during that scene.</br></br>  <br>Not in my heart.</br>  <br>The highs were higher, but the lows have definitely been way lower than anything in CG so far. The whole evil Kuroi shenanigans was also a lot more stupid compared to Mishiro, but there's still chances for her to do some cartoonishly evil stuff as well.<br><br>Also, TakeP is just way better than AkaP.</br></br></br>  That Kaede episode is what I've been waiting for since CG started. It was alright. I think they could've used Koi Kaze better, that song had the potential to be Yakusoku or Nemuri Hime tier from im@s2011.  <br>You sir have a great taste.</br>  <br>Because there is too much focus on Rin and NG. Its ok if its Uzuki. But you are right, only thing enjoyable are Kaede's scene.</br>  <br>Simple yet sympathetic development with small office starting up using lively girls, everyone getting some impactful scenes not just 5 favorites, danketsu, no sterile plastic agency, lolis that actually did something.</br>  <br>Well Kaede is a support cast so it isnt surprising but it still have its own impact in the story. Its my favorite episode so far. As they delivered Kaede with much more develop than the freakin whole CG cast.</br>  <br> As they delivered Kaede with much more develop than the freakin whole CG cast. <br>Tell me about it...</br></br>  After the "interrogation".  http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XfZ_<wbr>K8sJ6NY</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ<br><br>ＫＯＮＣＨＩＫＩＣＨＩＮ</br></br> </br></br>  <br><br> <br><br>Aiko is in my top 5 as well. If Scamco had any sense, they'd put her and Uzuki in a healing unit.<br><br>She's the Regen to Uzuki's Cure 2.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Anya was born in the 25th of December she'd be a Christmas miracle.  <br>I want to get smashed with Anya and Minami while Ranko is drinking tomato juice.</br>  <br>And if Kaede was born on the 25th of December she'd be a Christmas cake.<br> &gt;tfw all my Kaede pictures just got up and disappeared </br></br>  <br><br><br> Had the potential to be Yakusoku or Nemurihime <br><br>Okay, the Kaede overreaction nonsense in these threads really needs to get toned down a bit.<br><br>Kaede is not the main character. The main characters are NG (and TakeP), supported by the rest of the Cinderella Project and a few other characters. The main focus of the show we see is on the growth of those involved in the Project. How they start as a ragtag bunch of strangers held together only by way of being chosen for the same initiative, and how they develop into a strong, cohesive group. A Cinderella story.<br><br>Kaede has already had her Cinderella story, so to speak. She started at the bottom, and worked her way up until she reached the top. So in a show that wants to tell the tale of a Cinderella girl from start to finish, why should they devote such a cathartic moment, as Yakusoku was, to someone who has already had their development offscreen?<br><br>I'll admit, I like Kaede. One of my favorite CGs, even. She's a fun, cool character and I love Hayami's voice, but this nonstop Kaedeposting in every CG thread is becoming tiresome.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Minami probably doesn't drink but can you drink the Vodka fairy under the table?</br>  <br> So in a show that wants to tell the tale of a Cinderella girl from start to finish, why should they devote such a cathartic moment, as Yakusoku was, to someone who has already had their development offscreen? <br>Maybe because that's what A-1 likes, and they're obviously playing favorites?<br>I mean Mirio, Rika or Kanako will never get anything as big as Kaede had this episode. They won't ever have any emotional scenes, or glorified on stage or any shit. They won't have a "cinderella story" happening to them.</br></br></br>  <br>Hell no, I bet Anya could the hags a run for their money with her drinking.</br>  <br>I get that she's not the main character and I didn't mean Yakusoku-tier story-wise. I just meant that Koi Kaze as a song has a lot of potential to be a great insert in my opinion and they could've implemented it better, rather than cutting to dialogue after the first few lines.</br>  <br> Uzuki is the only one frowning <br><br>RIP gambarimasu.</br></br></br>  <br>kaedefags are just celebrating A-1 finally deliver Kaede, it will be back to usual thread next week or change focus to Nana if next week is Nana episode</br>  <br> usual thread <br>Kaede threads were a thing from the start.</br></br>  This woman is your friend. She fights for profits.  <br>Thats sad bro. Good thing I got one on my Phone then Laptop then Desktop.</br>  <br><br>Because the current show's focus is far too widespread among different idols.<br><br>They should just make Rin be the main character. <br><br>That would have made for a much better show. <br><br>Better than wasting time on Giantess Autist, Hipster Rock Autist, Goth Chuuni Autist, Illegal Immigrant Ruskie, lolis and shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off</br>  Are ML girls allowed?  <br>There are some lewd Rins in that pic.</br>  <br> lolis <br>They didn't waste 5 minutes with them altogether, not even with Dekoration episode.</br></br>  <br> goth chuuni autist <br> illegal immigrant ruskie <br>sasuga rinfag <br> athough I have to agree that the giantess and hipster are fucking terrible </br></br></br></br>  <br>Because Honda Mio must be removed.</br>  I can't get enough of Tsuki no Hotori de.<br>Azusa has an angel's voice.</br>  <br><br> Hating on Kirari <br><br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>It's hard to like her when SHE TALKS like THIS all the MOTHER fucking TIME and it's so ear GRATING.<br><br>Plus that fucking ":3" face all the time makes me want to punch her face in..</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe because of our difference in tolerance but I love Kirari's speech, it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy whenever she talks.</br>  Which idols would you swap?  <br>Kirari, Anzu, Sachiko, Syoko, Koume, Anya, Minami, Ranko, Miria, Rika, Mika, Akane, Kaede and KWSM</br>  <br>No matter what, the lolis would still stay irrelevant, so whatever.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy happy whenever she talks. </br>  <br>To each his own nigga, she's not even my favorite but she can still put a smile on my face.</br>  <br> it feels really uplifting and it's hard for me to not feel happy happy whenever she talks. </br>  http://strawpoll.me/5034239<br><br>The poll is still up.

Or would they kill their fans with their no stop puns?  <br>Azusa and Kaede would be better, Chihaya and Kaede stand on 2 different ends of the spectrum it feels weird putting them together.</br>  24 starring Idols when?<br><br>End boss is Chihaya. <br><br> Chihaya wins </br></br></br></br>  <br>You underestimate Anya's capabilities.</br>  I want to read books with Fumi.  <br><br>Cinderella Girls Xenoglossia when?</br></br>  <br>Kaede feels like a fusion of Azusa and Takane, two people that Chihaya seem to have a good affinity with (as long as breasts are not concerned).</br>  <br>Well at least with Kaede she doesn't have to worry too much, she has pretty modest breasts looking at it.<br> And I feel the same way but with Anya being a combination of Takane and Makoto </br></br>  <br>Well I think there good too. But Kaede doesnt get drunk on stage and mostly act quiet and mature when not intoxicated. So I think the normal Kaede and Chihaya would be good both are good singers too.</br>  <br> TakanexMakoto=Anya? <br><br>I dont see it.<br><br><br><br>Clearly see this; Takane's mysterious persona and Azusa's ara ara attitude is clearly Kaede's trait. Still if Azusa and Kaede drinks I doubt she can handle the top cake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I could see TakeP being a killer.</br>  <br>Light hair, astrology nut, rather refined elegance and naivete from Takane with the short-mid length hair and some boyish charms from Makoto, probably thinking too deeply into it, it's not really right to find 765Pro parallels in CG.</br>  New Love Laika when?  <br>The only thing parallel with CG and 765 are Haruka X Uzuki with the "muh gambarimasu".</br>   You will never get molested by Kaede. <br><br>Fuck my suffering.</br></br>  <br>That's silly, the new Love Laika is a trio</br>  When's the PV?<br><br>Also, is Nana the only one who works in the cafe?<br><br> Why are these two paired together in some pics? Is it because of cock rings, pegging, and mouth gags? </br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be unfair to the other groups. No one else would be able to compete.</br>  <br> Anzu, Miria and Rika <br>One can drea.</br></br>  I've neither played nor watched any part of the IP. Should I start with the first series or jump straight into CG? What about that mecha spinoff? Do the shows have high production value when it cones to musical performances?  Best unit comming thru.<br><br><br>Hahaha keep dreamin.</br></br></br>  <br>Either. Preferably the 2011 anime first. The mecha is not related in anyway but name.<br><br>Don't expect LL! It's pretty okay.</br></br></br>  <br>I watched all; idol with robots was so fucking XXX.

The mecha spinoff is silly, but it's not really horrible. Keep in mind it's really not Im@s.</br></br>  <br>And we make some small ajustments and we've for CG's vocal powerhouse and a bankrupt Cygames all in 1 turn.</br>  <br>Mecha spinoff is related to the series only in name. Personalities drastically differ and voice actors too. The only thing in common is the base designs and names of the characters. Otherwise, it's your standard sunrise mecha show.<br><br>Aside from a shared setting, there isn't really any connection between the two. (Although CG chronologically takes place after the 2011 series). The approach and story framing of 2011 and CG drastically differ from each other so each is a completely different experience and it doesn't matter which you start on. But for Chronology's sake, go start on 2011 first.<br><br>In my opinion, both series are well animated where it counts (i.e. the performances) but fuck should I know what your standards are for these things, so it's best you watch it for yourself.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we've for <br>we've got</br></br>  <br>I love Rin and Uzuki</br>  <br>the fake CMs were easily the best part of the idolmaster anime, i'd love to see them do one with kaede as protag</br>  <br>I agree here. You should only get into the anime if you already like it.<br><br>Get the english translated PSP games which run on ppsspp perfectly (I think). Reccomended to get morning(?) sun first as it has all three girls translated, Moon next as Chihaya is adorable,a nd Wandering Star last as doing either Yukiho or Iori's route will spoil you thanks to Takane.<br><br>Check out doujins, the memes/lore, some of the manga.<br><br>If you still want more, some routes are translated, check out Yukipo.<br><br>tldr<br>PSP games&gt;Music&gt;Translated Stuff&gt;Doujins/Lore&gt;Anime&gt;Puchimas<br><br>CG and ML are pretty much just check the translated stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Should I start with the first series or jump straight into CG? <br><br>Either is fine. Do note that the respective anime adaptations are only the barebones experience of their source material. They are plenty enjoyable as they are, but plenty of in-jokes or references will fly over your head if you have zero knowledge about the franchise. Furthermore, both series are guilty of shafting some of the characters to the side. So if you like a particular character, you might want to dabble in further im@s media to see them have further depth. Both adaptations only really managed to flesh out select characters.<br><br> What about that mecha spinoff? <br>Greatest Love Story between a Girl and her Giant Mecha ever told.<br><br>If you watch Sunrise Mecha shows not named Gundam, you know what to expect. The only thing im@s in this show is the name and designs of the characters.<br><br> Do the shows have high production value when it cones to musical performances? <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XLr<wbr>IpgdFwVk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is she alone?  <br>When is she going to protect her man and remove Rin?</br>  <br>Watch Puchimas first</br>   ONE <br> TWO <br> KISS<br>KISS</br> </br></br>  <br><br>I doubt it will ever happen but I hope we will get a bunch of ovas giving focus and time to the voiced idols not appearing in the anime.</br></br>  <br>At this point even a cameo would be enough.</br>  Get ready guys for some shit posting.

YOU'LL BE THE END OF US ALL</br></br></br></br>  <br>And there were people who said CG is not full on cake pandering.</br>  <br>Looks like the proposal didn't work out that well.

They'll prbably get their episode, jsut be chill bruh.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Not even Mobage Nana has removed her hair ties. <br>This. FUCKING THIS. I was so frustrated by this fact.

We're getting whole bunch of idols in every episode, instead of just focusing on NG. <br>Episode about the absolute bottom (according to MagicHour, Nana hasn't had her Meruhen Debut yet) right after the top idol Kaede is really a nice touch too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think they'll be mixing it up. They'll prbably get their episode, jsut be chill bruh. <br> 16 episodes in <br> no episodes yet <br>You are retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Each group had their episode, what are you saying?<br><br>I'd agree that Anya hasn't had her ep which is probably what they're saving for. Minami herself even has grown or at least developed as the sort of a pseudo-leader.</br></br></br>  <br>Consider the mecha spinoff to be Jukki Hanada's junior season before he went to Idol 101 and wrote Love Live.</br>  <br>the group episode may have not been much, but it's always something<br><br>if you don't count that, then that's your problem<br><br>I honestly think we should chill and leave it to A-1, the second cour is great so far</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Group episode <br>We got exactly fucking nothing of some girls like Kanako, Miria or Rika. Those group episodes didn't give them focus, unlike for example Riina's and Miku's. Now that was a good group episode.<br>Those other girls are fucked.<br> I honestly think we should chill and leave it to A-1, the second cour is great so far <br>Of course that's how people who are satisfied feel. Yeah I know, loli fans should kill themselves as they are shitty and don't deserve any characterization, banzai A-1 and all that shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Legends say that if you remove Nana's bunny ribbon tie, she reverts back into being a Cake.</br></br></br>  <br>Silly Anon!<br><br>Usamin is 17!

It's ehhhh but what they did was that each episode had an already established idol do something that would affect/provide/establish the plot. Not just as a cameo but help out or do something. <br><br>I'm sorta hoping they're gonna do that now that everyone is more establsied at least.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Anyone here watched Lovedol? <br>I watched it.<br> everyone is more establsied at least. <br>What?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Nana Abe: An Alien Robbed of Her Control</br>  <br> Aah!

Everyone but Love Laika had an episode just for their respective units.<br><br>Asterisk has an episode just for them. Actually, if we include this one. Possibly two episodes.<br><br>Minami, herself, has started establishing herself as the leader of the group and taking charge which is really great. Anya may possibly get one but I'd honestly have her combine with Ranko and have an ep just for the idols in the dorms.<br><br>In the deko ep. Miria was her usual joyful self. We got to see more of Rika's character. I've actually liked the way they're going with Kirari by making her this older sister, it adds a level of maturity to her that I don't think I've seen enough to appreciate her before.<br><br>Candy Island is definitely the biggest problem as Minami and Chieri don't stick out (fat jokes aside) which is why some anons want Chieri to go dere already as giving them an episode again would be pretty meh.<br><br>Anzu and Ranko are solid enough to stand out by themselves.<br><br>What seems to be happening now is that A1 is letting the idols play off the other secondary idols.<br><br>Yes there will be a ton of NG but that's because they are the main characters.<br><br>I think it's still a bit too early to say. Take a chill pill, negative Nancy. You're not the only one who wants them to be shown more but it's useless to look into the done when we could be excited about the good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kiss me, Kanade!</br></br>  How old is Nana?  <br><br>17.</br></br>  <br>17</br>  <br> In the deko ep. Miria was her usual joyful self. We got to see more of Rika's character. <br>We didn't see any of that happening.<br>Candy Island is pretty much the same, except Anzu.<br>Any anyways we don't have enough episodes for them to shine like this, and indeed A-1 doesn't seem to be interested in them, from the very beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure in one episode she said something like she is forever 17 but how old is she actually?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Only thing we know for sure is 21+</br></br></br>  <br>We actually know for sure she's 24+, given that she had to wear bloomers in school</br>  <br>Meanwhile Mio is forever unpopular no matter how many screentime and character development she gets.</br>  <br> unpopular <br>Miria and Rika would love to be as unpopular as her.</br></br>  <br>I'm kissing her</br>  <br>Rika's not really unpopular you loli-conspiracist</br>  <br>well if you're a freaking rip-off as an idol; yeah you'll gonna be unpopular.</br>  <br>She's nothing like Miki</br>  <br>Just wait till PP.<br><br>Hoenstly, I actually really like Mio. She really feels like the one who gets everyone excited and moving. <br><br>She's been fun.<br><br> When she said she was happy to to not quit won me over. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A-1 is interested in popular characters, not characters who don't even rank in the elections.<br><br>In the last two elections : <br>Rika ranked #41 and #50<br>Kanako ranked #30 and #37<br>Miria didnt rank at all<br><br>Why are you so surprised ? You should feel lucky these characters even made it into the anime, and as "main characters" you can see them in almost every episode. <br>Cherish what you have, or spend more money to have them rank higher.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miria is joy. She's upbeat. She's happy. she's the incarnation of the joy of being a child.<br><br>What more do you want her to do?<br><br>I'm not too sure on Candy Island but I do think Dekoration will get some eps since we may get a Jougasaki ep.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Miria and Rika don't get as many screentime as Mio</br>  WALLOWING IN DEPRESSION WITH NANA  <br>She is extremely unpopular.<br><br>Well yeah, this is obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>I'd rather they didn't make it and then it wouldn't surprise me that they get nothing.<br>Also Anzu is still not completely unpopular, then why is it she doesn't get to do anything either? And Chieri?</br></br>  Kaede brings the comfiest episodes, Doubt we'll get any more of her now.   Season 1 threads <br>Full of epic meme<br> Season 2 threads <br>Full of whining<br><br>Whoever win, I lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  <br>Don't worry its confirmed that she's the support cast for NG, means she gets a role on NG suffering.</br>  <br> A-1 is interested in popular characters, not characters who don't even rank in the elections. <br>All the voice giveaways and cameos prove you wrong. <br>It's also hilarious how conveniently you ignored the fact that Chieri is one of the most popular idols and gets literally nothing out of the show.<br><br><br>I can understand complaining about Chieri, Kanako or Rika not getting anything from the anime, but I completely disagree when they put Miria there. She's supposed to be embodiment of innocence, a characterization that didn't leave Scamco much room for expanding her character and thus resulting in her being the least popular of the CP members. And yet here we see A-1 making use of it. We see her to be pretty much the only one not freaking out because of a ghost, we see her carefree and joyful at almost all times, we found out she understands chuunispeak too. I know this isn't much compared to some other CP members, but it's something and definitely proves that A-1 can create something out of nothing. <br><br>I really don't think we should worry too much like the meme spouting "HURR A-1 HATES LOLIS" faggot. There's still time and plenty of episodes to go and whining won't change anything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>producer<br>more like<br>proloser</br></br></br>  <br><br>LL (possibly with Ranko) has a lot of potential for telling a story about splitting the group, Scamco can't fuck up and not tell it.</br></br>  <br> A-1 HATES LOLIS <br>That's actually true.</br></br>  <br>I want to suffer with her.</br>  <br> the only one not freaking out because of a ghost <br><br> "Boss, we forgot to animate that girl, what do we now?" <br> "Leave it how it is, nobody cares" </br></br></br></br>  <br>Senkawa story arc when? Even Kotori got a song in the original idolmaster.</br>    <br>You don't know pain.<br><br>The thing about Rika though is that she's an established character of this game. While, yes people won't necessarily vote for her, she won't be forgotten. <br><br>She's one of the first idols and is pretty easy to like. Yes, she probably isn't too many people's favorite, but she is still liked.<br><br>The problem is just that she doesn't have a niche to go with.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I honestly think we should chill and leave it to A-1, the second cour is great so far <br>A boring introduction episode in which nothing really happens and a cheap rehash of episode 18 of 2011 isn't great. The best part of the show is still episodes 1-4, it all went to shit after that.</br></br>   "Shimamura Uzuki, It seems that your performances as of late have been very subpar." <br> "Y-Yes, but.... I'll keep doing my best from now on!" <br> "You'll do your best from now on? So are you saying that up until now, you haven't been taking things seriously?" <br> "N-No!

I think they were just filling the loli quota. <br>Like you've said, her VA is great, her song is good too. Truth be told, if Scamco wanted to, Miria would probably rank pretty high. <br>I think she's just not the kind of character to be aimed at the top though. Elections get very political and while Passion seems the easiest when it comes to outranking some established idol from top 3, I feel like they're trying to turn Miria into what you've said about Rika. There's plenty of idols like that, which are recognizable and liked, but don't get ranked (KWSM is the first thing that comes to mind). I for one am glad that PassionPs tend to put more votes on unvoiced idols, like 2moe or Takumi</br></br></br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;&gt;/vg/108011864 </br>  <br>My problem is just that if they decided to go with this main cast, they shouldn't completely ignore some.<br>I wouldn't be upset if they didn't become part of main cast, this is actually a bit worse like this.<br>I like Uzuki, Anastasia, Miku, Riina, Kirari, Chieri, Kanako and Anzu very much. I just happen to like Rika and Miria the most, but if they weren't part of the main cast just to be later shoved to side I wouldn't have been upset about them not appearing.<br>This way, I am.

We could probably cut off some people like Minami, Anya, Chiri, Kanako, and Miria (as much as it hurts to say).<br><br>It may have worked a bit better.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> My problem is just that if they decided to go with this main cast, they shouldn't completely ignore some. <br> I wouldn't be upset if they didn't become part of main cast, this is actually a bit worse like this. <br><br>I feel you, man and I agree that idols get mistreated, but they don't get COMPLETELY ignored. I think Kanako and Chieri have it much worse than Miria and Rika. While the l@lis don't get much individual focus, they bring in that fresh youthful feeling into the Project and have their share of screentime, unlike CI which just sits in the corner and eats/sobs/sleeps when they finally get the chance to appear. Also there's the small stuff like Miria speaking chuuni. I for one found that really cute. <br><br>When you think about it, Niwaka didn't really get that much characteristics outside of her &gt;rokku shenanigans neither, but it's the chemistry between her and the Cat that everyone seems to love. I think that's what they tried to do with the Dekoration. Did they do a good job? Probably not, the only thing it really gave us is put Kirari in a different light. <br>There's still like 8 episodes to go, so I'll just wait until then before hating on A-1.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why Laikas though? They don't get much screentime and they're popular and well received anyway. Minami was given some development, she ranked somewhat high in the election and just look at the amount of Anya x Walking Sex art on pixiv.</br>  <br><br>Even when they put Miria in the election Gacha she only ranked low 30s.</br></br>  <br>Nao wasn't too popular when she voiced KWSM, wasn't Kanon her only big role back then?</br>  <br>I'd go with something like <br>The sea is... pleaseant.<br><br>'Slump' because it's a shit-tier pun?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 'Slump' because it's a shit-tier pun? <br>Yea</br></br>  <br>Mayu's truly a cute girl.</br>  <br><br>She had other leads but she wasn't all that well established at that point.

Ready for the suffering to be resolved so everyone can be happy happy again.</br>  <br>I just want her to murder me. Is that too much to ask?</br>  <br>I think she was pretty well known. She had a bunch of roles and even non-seiyuufags knew her. Personally, I knew her mostly for Ako (from Saki) and Yune (from Ikoku Meiro) at the time. Which made me think she was a strange choice for KWSM now that I think back on it.</br>  <br>Minami?</br>  Who do you think is going to fill the 5th slot in the next CD batch?  <br>MOMOKA</br>  <br>No?</br>      <br>Why are you posting cookies in a cake thread?</br>  <br><br>The time of loli will soon be upon us.</br></br>  <br>I'd rather her nee-san</br>  <br> she will never rape you with a schizophrenic look on her face <br>Why even live?</br></br>  <br> she will never force-feed you vag juice cookies </br>  <br>Why would you need to be force fed?</br>  <br>Usubeni Sakurako doujinshi when?</br>  <br>Your presence will be required in the Shimoneta threads soon.</br>   You will never date Uzuki <br> You will never bring Uzuki home to meet your parents <br> You will never visit Uzuki while she's sick <br> Koume will never rope the two of you into watching a horror flick where Uzuki will no doubt cling to you in fear <br><br>Sometimes I feel like being a fan of iM@S is more of a curse than anything else.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Uh, she's already filling a slot, the announced one is the 5th.</br></br>  <br>who are other 4</br>  <br><br>Takumi, Syuko, Shiki and Yumi.</br></br>  <br>Nigger idol's can't have relationships  ;_; </br>  I need a miku in my life, I need one bad  <br><br>There are plenty of selfish 3D bitches out there.

Hurr let me show you my "awakening" that no one used at marineford and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy </br></br></br>   I think there are two types of writers, the architects and the gardeners. The architects plan everything ahead of time, like an architect building a house. They know how many rooms are going to be in the house, what kind of roof they're going to have, where the wires are going to run, what kind of plumbing there's going to be. They have the whole thing designed and blueprinted out before they even nail the first board up. The gardeners dig a hole, drop in a seed and water it. They kind of know what seed it is, they know if planted a fantasy seed or mystery seed or whatever. But as the plant comes up and they water it, they don't know how many branches it's going to have, they find out as it grows. And I'm much more a gardener than an architect.”  <br><br>Oda has clearly been a gardener for those parts of the story. So what's the problem?</br></br>  Wait a minute, that design on Sanji's cloak...  <br> hurr durr let me use Gear 4 which I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br><br>You don't start fighting with nuclear bombs m8. Conventional arms first.</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  I dont think Doffy being OP is bad writing<br><br>He's supposed to be bullshit<br><br> because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy <br>it's like you don't know Doffy's personality at all</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I stopped caring too much about OP after the timeskip. Oda only disappoints now.</br>  <br>no<br><br>there's a sun on his cloak because they're in a desert</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded, neither Luffy nor Doffy had any reason to use their strongest attacks prior to these situations. Hody was fodder, so was Caesar. Why use Gear 4th against such weaklings when you know you will be fucked for 10 minutes after using it? It clearly is an attack that is meant to be used as a last resort. And Doffy already used his awakened ability before officially talking about awakened abilities you dumbass mach 20 speedreading faggot.</br>  <br>He is both, the main plot (the 4th level of writing as One Piece podcast put it, above sagas) is clearly the work of an architect, sagas too, but everything inside them is the work of a gardener.</br>  <br>nice minority opinion<br>but I bet you are still reading every new chapter instead of dropping the manga like a sane person should, right?</br></br>  <br> I know that a lot of people are triggered by Sabo('s backstory) <br>I don't usually frequent One Piece threads. Why exactly did people find it triggering?</br></br>  <br>If Luffy's so streched to use it as a last resort, what the fuck he'll do against bigger opponents of NW? Doffy was just the appetizer and Strawhats hardly won against him.</br>  <br> and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy <br>You didn't understand what was going on at all, did you ?<br>Doffy can't help but have lingering affection for Law, he wasn't going to kill him.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabofags delusioned themselves with their own head canon so when Oda didn't do the same thing they got mad. So basically they are just butthurt.</br>  <br><br>He'll probably have more last resorts which fuck him up even more.</br></br>  <br>because their "m-muh secret mission" fanfictions did not come true</br>  <br> Are you retarded, neither Luffy nor Doffy had any reason to use their strongest attacks prior to these situations. <br> law gets shot infront of you <br> Whole country gets captured by a birdcage and people are in actual danger <br> meanwhile the rest of your crew is facing big mom all alone <br> let me try to fight doffy as he was hody, I might win that way <br>Are you retarded? There were enough situations at dressrosa forcing luffy to use gear 4, but he just ignored it and didn't on the other hand doffy did not use his awakening as his main force and instead played with his enemys while losing one subordinate after the other. That's shit-writing right there, but you keep deepthroughing oda's dick.<br><br><br>We really shouldn't bring those sabo discussions in here.<br><br><br>Affection didn't stop him from killing his own brother who didn't damage him nearly as much as law</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> There were enough situations at dressrosa forcing luffy to use gear 4 <br>Not really, if you have a strong attack with such a huge backlash of fucking course you will try to avoid using it as long as possible. Are you not able to form coherent thoughts?</br></br>  <br>And yet Doffy didn't kill Law while Luffy was busy recovering from a previous attack, even though he was weak and defenseless and all he had to do was stretch his arm.<br>Don't you think it's likely that he didn't want to kill someone dear to him again ? <br>Well sure it is but interpretation, but I think it's rather obvious.</br></br></br>  <br>You do realize you are complaining about typical battle shounen tropes do you? Pro Tip: Stop reading this type of manga.</br>  <br> , if you have a strong attack with such a huge backlash of fucking course you will try to avoid using it as long as possible. <br>Nope you're just delusive. There was no need to fight doffy for this long, when the danger was as big as it was and luffy could use gear 4 willingly. When Luffy was facing Trebol and doffy with law, it was the last moment that would hav emade sense to use Gear 4, but instead they fucked around until trebol off'd himself further supporting that shit writing.<br><br><br> And yet Doffy didn't kill Law while Luffy was busy recovering from a previous attack, even though he was weak and defenseless and all he had to do was stretch his arm. <br>He was clearly focusing to kill the bigger danger of those two first, which was luffy and his potebtial second usage of gear 4.<br><br><br>Nope, if you want it or not, One piece is the best WSJ series atm and I enjoyed, but that's exactly why I have so much hope for it to be good. Saying<br> hurr it's a shonen <br>Is basically evading a discussion, because you have no real argument left.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He was clearly focusing to kill the bigger danger of those two first, which was luffy and his potebtial second usage of gear 4 <br>Well yeah that too, It's not like both these opinions are mutually exclusive.</br></br>  <br>It was precisely because Trebol was still there that he did not use it. What if he would have managaged to defeat Doffy (which would certainly would have been impossible since even with the damage Law inflicted on him he still survived the Gear 4 assault) but then would be helpless due to the backlash and get fucked by the still standing Trebol. What you don't seem to understand is that Luffy has to exclude all contingencies before using Gear 4th. The perfect time was when he was 1vs1 against Doffy without any other interferences and Doffy being badly wounded by Law on top of it.</br>  <br> Is basically evading a discussion, because you have no real argument left. <br>Literally what? One Piece being the best WSJ series or not has nothing to do with it being full of typical shounen tropes or not. If you really are denying that you are deluded beyond belief.</br></br>  <br> Doffy can't help but have lingering affection for Law, he wasn't going to kill him. <br><br> And yet Doffy didn't kill Law while Luffy was busy recovering from a previous attack <br>Did you miss Doffy asking Law like 3 times to perform the immortality operation on him, something Law has to be alive to do? He didn't murder the guy straight away because the power to bestow immortality was right in front of him and he was seeing if he could bribe Law somehow. Lingering affection didn't stop him from asking the guy to suicide for him multiple times.<br>Like how he probably liked Monet but didn't hesitate to ask her to sacrifice herself for a greater purpose.<br><br>One of Doffy's first fucking lines after the timeskip is "Hey Vergo, murder Law as brutally as possible for me and bring me a souvenir", he just wasn't aware that Law's current power level would allow him to manhandle Vergo.<br><br>13 years ago literally the first thing he did when he learned Law ate the fruit was say "Lel guess I'll have to brainwash that kid into dying for me."<br><br>Even if I give you your point that Doffy has some feelings deep down in his satanic heart, that didn't stop him from murdering his brother or asking his main squeeze to die. Extending this to the top executives, who are aware of Doffy's true nature and way of doing things, Pica was immediately ready to kill Baby after she jumped ship. Doffy explicitly says to Viola that he doesn't forgive traitors, and Law falls into that category. Waterloo's status as secondary shounen protagonist in a series where 2 non-flashback characters have died in 18 years/Doffy's desire for muh immortality protected him.<br><br> I think it's rather obvious <br>The only thing obvious here is that you're a Doffy apologist</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>See<br><br>Awakening was mentioned before and hinted many times.<br>Also what asspull? Doflamingo got rekt. It's called foreshadowing.</br></br></br></br>  So Drum Kingdom is going to be independent of the WG, right?  <br>Then Luffy could have easily made Law fuck off with trebol, that isn't really the issue.<br><br><br>I did not deny that, you have no reading comprehension. I expressed that I expect more from it that other series especially because it is the best WSJ series. That does not mean that it has no shounen tropes.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying those are not also a foreshadow to Smile </br>  <br> Lingering affection didn't stop him from asking the guy to suicide for him multiple times <br> Like how he probably liked Monet but didn't hesitate to ask her to sacrifice herself for a greater purpose <br>So ? That's the way that guy works. Don't judge him with your own morals, you'll miss the subtleties of his character.<br> The only thing obvious here is that you're a Doffy apologist <br>There it is, the OP thread Godwin law. No point in discussing with you any further.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;hurr durr let me use Gear 4 which I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br> Implying you shoul use lightly something that makes you unable to move for a lot. <br><br>Nice bait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You know, I suddenly think Chopper can be considered an awakened Zoan. At least pre-TS, he could 'Awaken' with the Rumble Ball but he can do that naturally post-TS although Monster Point still requires a Ball. Then again, maybe MP is Chopper's Awakened form?</br>  Strawhats partake in the world's hottest chili challenge. How will each member fare?  <br> Awakening was mentioned before and hinted many times. <br>Awakened Zoans were, nothing else. That's clearly a difference. It was suggetsed back than that zoans got the awakened ability to balance (with the paracemia/logia) them more and allowing others to transform like Chopper. All of that was fucked by Doffy. Weird that Rayleigh didn't tell luffy about it and that it was in no form mentioned nor *directly* used at the war of the best.<br><br><br>You would if that stops the problem/situation.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Then Luffy could have easily made Law fuck off with trebol, that isn't really the issue. <br>Holy shit how hardheaded can you be? Fuck off, I really don't care anymore.</br></br>  <br>Zoan and Paramecia are different things. <br>What should an Awakened Zoan do? Morph people and things into animals?<br>The whole point of Zoan is that the user increases his physical abilities. An awakened Zoan simply does it more (like Chopper with RB).</br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded? Law power basically allows him to take any retard away. Just radio knife trebol's little ass and then teleport to some of your nakamas to fuck him up.</br>  <br>  It was suggetsed back than <br>Where? In the manga? Not really.</br></br>  <br> You would if that stops the problem/situation. <br>That's not the safest tactic. <br>You try with all your strenght in base form before using a transformation with a very high cost.<br><br>Also why are we discussing this? Luffy made a mistake using Gear 4 so soon. If Law+guys didn't help him he was going to lose.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No I meant in the discussions, of course not in the manga. <br><br><br> Also why are we discussing this? Luffy made a mistake using Gear 4 so soon. If Law+guys didn't help him he was going to lose. <br>because luffy can't see the future. How would he knew that he would lose when he uses Gear 4 too soon? It was best technique, so there shouldn't have been anything holding him back.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, MP is probably awakened. Other forms are just more control over partial transformations.</br>  Are the things Kuma shoots compressed air or energy balls?  <br>then why are you here faggot</br>  <br><br>Compressed air.</br></br>  <br>As I thought, thanks.</br>    <br><br> Implying ground secco was removing water from ROCKS <br>That was fucking awakening 10 years ago.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Well Ursus Shock certainly is.<br><br>The Pad Ho on the other hand is him pushing the air, so it is similar to compressed air in that regard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Zoro, Luffy and Brook would go on until they pass out at the same time.</br>  <br>But I saw these things go through people without making holes in them, how can air do that?</br>  <br><br>Ask Oda.</br></br>  <br>I believe Kuma just made shockwaves by repelling air. That's why it can pass through stuff and leave a mark.</br>  <br><br>Its basicly sound. Compressed airwaves. Except he only sends out one and not a wave. And guess what strong airwaves can do? <br><br>Loss of hearing is just the start, you can get eye damage, and internal bleeding, to straight up destroyed internal organs.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The more information we get about Crocodile the more it becomes clear he was a fucking retard.</br></br>  <br>Zoro wins by far, he just has too much endurance.

It was spoiled </br>  <br><br>Implying Brook wouldn't eat himself dead.<br><br> If he already were not dead YOHOHOHO </br></br></br></br>  <br>It might be a tie. Spicy food is Sanjis favorite at least.</br>  <br><br>That's has sense, thanks.<br><br> Kuma too OP please nerf </br></br></br></br>  <br>Awaken but shitter than Luffy with no Gears.</br>  <br>Even Ace was probably weaker then Luffy now.<br>Having a logia makes you skip haki and body training sometimes.<br><br>Crocodile relied too much on his pseudo-invulnerability</br></br></br></br>  <br>Him being completely brain dead might be the nerf.</br>  <br>And Marine arc Crocodile can draw with Doffy.</br>  <br>Or maybe he is even stronger due to being merciless.</br>  <br><br>That's due to him relying on his fruit too much - Pekoms summed it up perfectly.</br></br>  <br>Doffy wasn't taking him seriously. Was just playing the whole war giving no crap.</br>  <br>And Doffy can't finished Moria if he use awaken it's easy to beat all</br>  <br>dude what?</br>  <br>Invisible guy saved Moria, you moron. And probably Doffy made him go for the lol of it.</br>  <br>Why Crocodile didn't used his awaken to break that prison?</br>  <br>fucking agalmatolite prison shit.<br>do you even read the manga?</br></br>  <br><br> b8 <br><br>Sea-stone shackles...</br></br></br></br>  <br>He was known as merciless and Tyrant before.</br>  Would you anons get mad if Kid alliance actually win against Shanks ?

Literally spent the whole arc being a useless bitch and crying for men to save her ass. Definitely one of the most poorly written characters Oda made yet.</br>  <br>Fucking read the whole arc before saying bullshit.</br>  <br>Just belive. Goda finds his way.</br>    <br>nice quads</br>  <br>Shineh</br>  <br> Shineh <br><br>Yeah that Screenshot does look a bit too bright.</br></br></br>  <br>It's only been hinted to so far. It hasn't been confirmed yet whether he's a full fledged member or merely an ally to them.</br>  The one piece world itself is created by an awakened power.  What are the odds that any of the other supernovas are gonna get as much time and attention given to their backstory as Law?  <br>both the bitches look fine.</br>  <br>Kidd is basically a certainty at this point.<br>Drake and Bonney are also fairly likely.</br></br>  <br>They won't get as much attention, though some of them will certainly get a lot of time too. But Law is the first and Luffy's favorite ally, so he gets special treatment.</br>  How come the WG never conquered or at least destroyed Fishmen Island? With that place gone, the number of pirates swarming to the New World would have dropped drastically.  <br>I'm sure well learn about all of them at some point.<br><br>Law will always be Odas favourite though</br></br></br>  <br> One of the Yonko defending FI <br> Let's attack guys! We did so well against Whitebeard, what's the worst that could happen? </br></br>  Enel awakened when  <br>Ussop wins as he's built up a minor tolerance to spicing things accidentally dosing himself while building spicy ammunition.</br>  <br>A lot of Paradise pirates get weakened and weeded out in the New World. they lose their dreams and beg to go back to their families. The New World is actually quite bad for Pirates. You can't just waltz in and expect to be fine.</br>  <br>This and the dwarves... What the fuck was he thinking? No wonder he takes every-other week off...</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the straw hat pirates did</br>  <br>Usopp can handle it but he can't keep going. He simple does not have as much will as Zoro.</br>  <br>I don't really care, I'm not expecting masterful writing from one piece. I'm just expecting something enjoyable.

Over Garp, of all people. What happened ?  <br> "Haa.. Hold me back just like that, Sengoku" <br>LEWD.</br></br>  <br>That's because Garp ate the blood blood fruit and now he's a blood man.</br>  <br> Garp <br> Not Zoro </br></br>  <br> implying Zoro's not the Devil Fruit in human form </br>  <br> There's literally no proof or hint of that. <br><br>Look at his faces before taking Luffy's punch. He is clearly hesitating because he still cared about Luffy and Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> falling for it <br>What are you doing ?</br></br>  <br>What you interpret on the situation doesn't matter.<br><br>Look at the image posted by this post <br><br>That's like saying Luffy closed his eyes before he punched Garp because he didn't want to punch him.<br><br>Its all speculation.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 5000x5000 </br>  <br>Nah he's the MM fruit in human form making him a masochist man.</br>  <br><br>Is there an issue?</br></br>  <br> falseflagging this hard to stir up shit <br><br>You can keep raiding but it will never work.</br></br></br>  Which one, /a/?  <br>Nothing, OP himself was the one doing it. He is an autist from outside who thinks he needs to shitpost to "keep the thread" alive which is just an excuse to ask a mod to ban the threads really, which will never work.</br>  <br>Obviously both.</br>  <br>Both and Tashigi and Bonney and human Monet and the others I forgot about.</br>  <br> that robin <br><br>I've never wanted to love an indian in my life as hard as I do now.<br><br>But If I have one choice the obvious choice would be the one in her prime Nami.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not both. </br>  Alright, speculation time. <br><br>I think Crocodile used to be in Whitebeard's crew. He was the 2nd Division Captain before Ace. He probably realised that he wanted to become Pirate King himself instead of supporting Whitebeard and decided to fight him. And lost badly. He might have been left on his own like Usopp was after the fight. He might have been rescued by Ivankov, who gave him the same treatment as Sanji, with the cross dressing and what not.</br></br>  Look long and hard at this jobber.<br><br>Do you think he made a crew of his own<br>Or is he sucking another old man's dick?</br></br></br>  <br>He's supporting the survivors of WB's crew. He's not fit to a captain.</br>  <br><br> caring about writing and annoyance on delicious tits <br> getting mad about it <br><br>Either literal underaged faggot or literal landwhale cunt. Hard to tell, their opinions and anger are often similar.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They want to get fucked hard by Rebeccafag's delicious sadisitic wordings.</br>  Has BB awakened his fruit and that's why he has his special body that can hold more fruits and even absorb devil fruit powers and such? Or are those really just base abilities of the yami yami no mi?  <br> supporting the survivors of WB's crew <br><br>Anon didn't we tell you not to trust strangers? Who told you this?</br></br></br>  <br>Robin with all my lovin'</br>  <br>I think is a chance thing, most people die with a second fruit but some survive. Blackbeard is one of the chosen ones.</br>  <br>He can eat more than one fruit because of his "weird body", not because of the yami yami.<br>He just ate the gura gura after the death of WB because it respawned in an empty fruit of the same kind he was carrying with him.</br></br>  <br>I thought he had another fruit that allowed him to have more than one fruit. Like the Chimera Chimera no Mi or some shit giving him two more fruit spaces.</br>  <br><br> inb4 D's can have 2 fruits </br></br>  <br> Luffy gets a second devil fruit <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Maybe is D. related thing but maybe not.</br></br>  <br>I'd hope it isn't. Likely a unique effect due to his weird body.</br>  <br>It was just my opinion. I don't think he'll ever be relevant again. He's probably gonna job/support.</br>  <br> Awakened Zoans were, nothing else.  <br>Please God, tell me this is bait. You can't be that dumb.<br>Why is everyone saying we don't see these awakening powers in marineford or anyone else talking about it? Why does everyone rule out the possibility that skill is evolving, much like actually life would. Something hard today would be impossible years ago.</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy gets another devil fruit <br> It's just another Gomu Gomu no Mi fruit so now he's a rubber man x 2 </br></br>  Huh, never noticed before but someone actually managed to give Doffy a scratch during the war.  <br><br> he gets Bellamy's fruit or some shit <br><br>Dropped.</br></br></br></br>  Are really all awakenings going to be about turning the environment into your DF power instead of yourself? Because there are a shitload of fruits that wouldn't work with it at all  <br>Not to mention Gear 4 is limited and drains nearly all his Haki.</br>  <br><br>Anons, please. Obvoiusly Sabo dies protecting him and he gets the mera mera no mi.</br></br>  <br>No he just gets an artificially manufactured version of the Gomu Gomu no Mi created using SAD.</br>  <br><br><br>Dropped harder.</br></br></br>  <br>The Impel Down guards already shot down your speculation.</br>  <br>What? Oda even foreshadowed that with Red Hawk. Come on. That's cool. A rubber fire man? He kills Akainu in the same way Akainu killed Ace. This could be great.</br>  Is this the biggest asspull thus far?<br><br>What will Oda pull out of his ass next?</br></br>  <br><br>Nah I'm done with it if he does that.</br></br>  <br>Gear Fifth.</br>  <br> One Piece <br> asspulls <br><br>Shitposting is a bannable offense</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Guards at ID were Zoans. All Zoans are essentially the same. Paramecia's are vastly different. If anything, the guards at ID support his speculation since all the awakened Zoans were similar. <br><br>I don't think all awakenings would be the same for Paramecia's though. Some would be but not all.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah not really, with all the samurai's and Japanese imagery going on since Punk Hazard, Luffy turning into a noh theater guy isn't that out there. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if he as just lying about whatever and just came up with this while talking to Kinomon.</br>  <br> Why is everyone saying we don't see these awakening powers in marineford or anyone else talking about it? Why does everyone rule out the possibility that skill is evolving, much like actually life would. <br>Are you retarded? Are implying taht doffy awakened during the two years timeskip? Are you really this dense?</br></br>  <br>Nah man<br> Luffy beats Akainu <br> Akainu dies and the Magu Magu no Mi respawns <br> Luffy eats it and becomes a molten rubber man <br> Inherits Akainu's will and uses his new abilities to beat the living shit out the most pirate-y guy in the series, Blackbeard <br>It's like poetry</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What do you think gear fifth will be?<br><br><br> that pic <br>You calling me an idiot sandwhich?</br></br></br></br></br>  Some anon wanted to know how Law's submarine could cross the Calm Belt a few threads ago. If that guy's around, this should answer it.  <br>5 = 2 + 3</br>  <br>I think it's both. The Yami Yami ability to absorb anything allows him to absorb other fruits' powers without actually eating it. That's why he avoids death.<br><br><br><br>the "wierd body" thing is just a supposition my by other caracters. I think it's because he can naturally absorb other people's powers thanks to the Yami Yami.<br><br>also, i don't really think he has all that control over the new gained powers. As far as we could see at Marineford, the Gura Gura powers were unstable at best.<br><br>Also, it gave me the idea that his new power was significantly weaker than Whitebeard's. He could barely stand up to Sengoku and completely avoided Shanks where Whitebeard proved more than capable to take both head on</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it must be nice, being like the empress's slave... <br><br>Who is the sidecharacter that put out that speech bubble?<br>He deserves an apple.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't exist nothing will be stronger than Gear 4th.<br><br><br>Why are you calling yourself an idiot sandwhich?<br>Don't be a victim to that pink flamingo's bullying.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Two same-sided swirly cues <br><br>And people wondered what was under Sanji's flap, it was already there.</br></br></br>  <br> yes </br>  <br>Penguin</br>  <br>the answer is obvious<br>not that I would not a Nami like a mad dog in heat but Robin is just superior</br></br>  <br>You so stupid.</br>  <br>OOOoohhh. Yeah that makes sense to me. He held the right kind of fruit there to absorb the power after he died. Then instead of eating that fruit, used the yami yami pwoers on the fruit. <br><br>As for his control over it, I think I get it. He and Whitebeard were not close. They hated each other. But then, look at Ace and Sabo, brothers who loved each other, and Sabo is pulling off amazing mera mera attacks right away. I think maybe that has something to do with it. Like the previous users spirit gets locked in there or something maybe. Could just be an issue of training I guess. Sabo is a pretty well-trained guy and BB seems to rely on his crew and abilities a bit more.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's jsut supposition by other characters. Marco said that the Whitebeards should all know about Teach's body. Considering that Teach spent 20 years with them, it's completely possible that the WB would know something about Teach that we don't. <br><br>And Teach literally used the Gura Gura after 30 seconds of getting it. Of course it would be unstable. Every character who had recently eaten a DF found the powers to be a bit unstable. Teach is no different. <br><br>Teach doesn't fight battles where victory isn't certain. Fighting Shank's crew with his unstable fruit and tiny crew would have been suicide. Especially if the Marines sided with Shanks, since he's the lesser 'Evil'.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It doesn't support anything. The ID guards, if anything, suggest that the entire Zoan class won't have powers related to the environment.<br><br> Paramecia's are vastly different <br><br>By your own logic wouldn't Paramecia's have vastly different Awakenings then? Doflamingo knowing that every Awakened DF has powers like his is as retarded Pell somehow knowing the entire world only has 5 flying DF users. I believe people misinterpreted Doffy's statement, which I understood as Doffy only suggesting a possibility of Awakened powers -- to change their environment.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Did you even fucking read my post ? I literally said ''I don't think all awakenings would be the same for Paramecia's''<br><br>Don't just read the first two sentences and reply Anon. Read the entire damn thing.<br><br>Also Pell said that only 5 were discovered. Which is reasonable since there's a fucking whole book about Devil Fruits.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Gomu Gomu no Mi awakened <br> Turns your body back to normal <br> Nobody said it would enhance your abilities <br> You're shit out of luck son </br></br></br></br>  <br> mfw I just realized this Den Den Mushis swirls mach Sanjis </br>  Anyone have that kinda lewd Hancoku image made by so-ru or whatever her name is.  <br>Luffy and Doffy pulling a Frieza is just typical Battle Shounen writing; it's horrendous by professional writing standards, but it's what the primary demographic wants and it's at least exciting<br><br>Sabo's backstory was Oda trying to fill in the plotholes created by his existence in the story.</br></br></br>  <br> That's a stretch </br>  <br>both</br>  <br> a technique gets revealed after the protagonist trained for 2 years <br> asspull <br>I know this is bait but there are actually people who truly believe this</br></br></br>  <br>Of course both and at the same time</br>  <br> Also Pell said that only 5 were discovered. Which is reasonable since there's a fucking whole book about Devil Fruits. <br><br>Seems more reasonable. Nobody probably ever went to Green Bit and saw the flying Bug Zoans there.<br><br>Still, I don't expect for Oda to ever clarify such a retarded statement. This was back in the days when Oda planned then end of Alabasta to be 50% of the entire manga, far from the length it has reached now.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo dies <br> Luffy gets the Mera Mera <br> Luffy activates Gear 5,   Burning Rubber </br></br></br>  <br>I don't but have this one in the mean time</br>  <br><br>Daily reminder that Boa Hancock is a pedo</br></br>  <br>That doesn't cut it out for me man.<br>Her tits are like too huge here.<br><br>So-ru's Hancocku and me have like a special connection you know what I mean?<br>You wouldn't understand.<br><br><br>Daily reminder than Hancocku is sexy as fuck and waifu material.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>still a pedo</br>  <br>Even better.</br>  <br>Still sexy as fuck and waifu material.</br>   A bowl of salad counts as a bowl of soup, according to CAPTCHA   <br><br><br> 17  <br> pedo <br><br>U wot m8.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Some people are too stupid to tell the difference.</br>  <br>How is it retarded though ? As far as Pell, a random fucking character in a random fucking Island, is concerned there were only 5 flying DFs that were discovered. Which means, at that point in time, Vegapunk only identified 5 flying fruits. Obviously the number isn't exact and Oda made sure he left room for expansion.</br>  <br> A 29 years old woman <br> Falls in love with a 17 years old boy <br><br>pedo</br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is really mature for his age though</br>  <br> 29 years old woman <br> pussy probably deeper than the elaware queduct <br> finds stretchy dumb kid <br> strechy dumb kid easily satisfied <br><br>She too smart for you anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I want to cuck Hancock with Luffy</br>  <br> I didn't use until now, because of reason that even I can't understand <br><br>he didn't use it before because of the strong drawback that forbids him from fighting for 10 other minutes<br><br> Hurr let me show you my "awakening" that no one used at marineford and that I didn't use against law, because I'm actually a pretty fair and nice guy <br><br>a lot of people use it in Marineford, you just didn't see it<br>he didn't need it against Law, he wrecked him without</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Elaborate - 17 isn't illegal.</br></br>  It was "identified" fruits. It wasn't "this many fruits exist because reasons". There are likely plenty more.  <br>It is in my country</br>    <br>Exactly. It's "Only 5 are known". Not "Only 5" as people seem to think. Places like Green Bit and Wano are gonna have fruits that Vegapunk probably doesn't know about.</br>  <br>of course he's awakened<br>I just hope we'll see other zoans with more than 3 forms<br>especially against Kaidou<br>the opposite would be pretty bullshit</br></br></br></br>  <br>American child please go</br>  <br>good, that means we have something in common</br>  <br>see<br/></br>  <br>No matter.<br><br>12 years of difference is to be considered a pedo, even if they both are over their 30s.<br><br>It's also disgusting</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> this fucking doujin <br><br>muh diiiick</br></br></br>  <br>Why are you European fags still awake?<br><br>Go to sleep you dopers.</br></br></br>  <br>Why would Vegapunk be the one spreading this information to 'a random fucking character in a random fucking Island'? He is one of the World Government's most precious assets, leaking his knowledge to pirates around the world would be a huge problem. Franky could only learn from Vegapunk by going to homeland and looking at his prototypes when he was young, everything else is still a huge mystery. Does Vegapunk leave his lab at all? Him cataloging DFs around the world doesn't sound right to me.<br><br>BB's booklet could simply be assembled by the underground network where Doflamingo worked his trade.</br></br></br>  <br><br> 12 years of difference is enough to be considered a pedo <br><br>I think you need to look up the legal definition of a pedo. <br><br>It depends on the age of consent, not the age gap.<br><br>So it some countries, it may be 17, but for most it isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ace was marineford luffy tier</br>  <br><br>She's a cougar, not a pedo you dingus.</br></br>  <br> She's a cougar <br><br>I'm trying to pounce on dat pussy naw wadda mean playa?</br></br></br>  <br>not the entire world but red line was created by a DF obeying the tenryuubitos<br>reminder that the red line is a conglomerate of islands<br>islands that will go back to their original state once the SH reach raftel<br>also creating the all blue (one and only sea)</br></br></br></br>  <br> says Whitebeard Pirates <br> Crocodile chilling there as well. <br>Yeah I can see where you're coming from.</br></br></br>  <br>Vegapunk didn't go to Arabasta and tell Pell about it over tea, you dingus. Why does everyone forget the book about DFs ? Vegapunk might be with the Marines but he still let Kuma protect the Strawhat Ship for 2 years. The DF book was probably screened by the WG and they probably didn't think of it's ramifications. Even Sanji has read the book at one point. It's not something special. Arabasta had a huge library at the palace. The King could have asked someone for it.</br>  <br>the dwarves were kinda forced to appear since he foreshadowed them a long time ago with norland<br>but I agree they brought only confusion to this arc and were not funny or useful</br></br>  <br> Crocodile was there <br> the whole time <br><br>WADDA FUCK?!</br></br></br></br>  <br> Oars the Continent Puller destroys the Red Line <br>So hyped for late game OP<br><br><br>Yea, that was the only thing that made me think he used to be a Division Leader. He looks like he belonged there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Robin seems to have had the chillest timeskip<br>sure she got into custody at first but she soon got fred by the revolutionaries<br>and then did... nothing???<br><br>or is there a lot of misteries we don't know about?<br>I wish there is</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She probably did a lot of shit with the Revs.<br><br> inb4 she helped uprisings we haven't heard about yet </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh she helped with some uprisings alright.<br><br> NAW WADDA MEAN PLAYA?</br></br></br>  <br> yfw a lot of people actually believe this <br>reminder that people thought that Law was able to teleport</br></br>  <br>didn't she meet Dragon offpanel? I remember something about that</br>  <br><br>Sure he switch places with objects, but it is pretty much teleportation - he gets to somewhere instantly.</br></br>  <br>nami is an insufferable slut<br>robin all day every day<br>then bonney</br></br></br>  Tashigi a best.  <br>No, she just sat and drank coffee for 2 fucking years.</br>  <br>they obviously had some kinda past since croco was full tsndere for shirohige<br>but part of his crew... I think we would have a hint at that if it were the case<br><br><br>wasn't it said that he was somehow the new captain of shirohige's crew</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I think is a chance thing <br><br>it would be completely stupid to think it has no connection with his flag</br></br></br>  Who is the best One Piece Character and why is it pic related?  <br>thankfully you're no writer<br>at least I hope</br></br>  <br>Cerberus fags please go</br>  <br> I don't think all awakenings would be the same for Paramecia's though <br><br>there's no need to overthink that anyway since only very few DF users will be able to awaken their power and we'll only see a handful of awakened paramecia<br>Oda will just show us awakened paramecia that can actually make sense</br></br></br></br>  <br> Best character <br> Dead </br></br>  <br>That's not a very convincing argument. There is no reason why Vegapunk was has to be one behind that illustrated DF book. Any scholar can put together bits and pieces information and illustrate that incomplete book.<br><br>Oda has hinted that Vegapunk knows far more about DFs than the rest of the world, so the idea that the WG 'probably didn't think of its ramifications' sounds like massive incompetence in their part. If they were really threatened, the book would have banned and burned around the world.</br></br></br>  <br>I like this one better </br>  <br>Alright then, some no name fucker published the book. Same damn result.</br>  <br>I really hope Oda doesn't add much gears<br>gear 2 was kinda mandatory since luffy needed a technique to keep on with enemies' speed<br>I hated gear 3 but thankfully we won't have to see it a lot anymore<br>I hate gear 4 design but it feels like with it he can actually hurt anyone with his king kong punch, even yonkous<br>and eventually he'll learn to reduce the drawbacks just like he did with the other gears</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>MANliest apple!!!!</br>  <br>doffy's eyes for you son</br>  <br>Also, what kind of a fall would that be?<br> Division Captain in the crew of the strongest man alive <br> Get's beaten by a kid with 30m bounty </br></br></br>  <br>MEN!</br>  <br>Shut up you feathery faggot</br>  <br>There could be something about this theory.<br>Oda doesn't draw shit with without a reason. <br>Why would he include Croc if Akainu was adressing the WB pirates?</br></br></br>  who was whitebeard's greatest ally and why was it her? <br>hope we see her again some day</br>  <br> that mustache <br><br>I think that 'she' is a 'he' dude.</br></br></br>  <br>probably but we have no hint in her doing anything useful<br>but she's so introverted anyway...<br><br><br>it's teleportation but only in a limited area<br><br><br>not even talking about the cerberus theory<br>but he must be able to have 3 powers for some reason<br><br><br>don't worry you're both equally idiots</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> Pedophilia <br> The same thing as statutory rape <br><br>You fucking serious? Pedophilia is the attraction to PRE-PUBESCENT children. Ones that have not hit puberty. Not anyone below the age of 18.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What?</br>  <br>Crushed by tons of water?</br>  <br> You are now aware WB was killed by a man with $0 bounty. </br>  <br>you think her upper lip is a mustache or what?</br>  He isn't 17 anymore anyway.  <br> beat by a man that was a Warlord <br>Not bad</br></br>   between 20-30% of the manga is left <br> 300-350 chapters max <br>How the fuck is Oda planning on finishing this without leaving any loose ends?<br>There is too much unexplained shit still left and every arc more stuff is added to that list</br></br></br>  <br>Whitey Bay all the way!!!</br>  <br>How do you mistake a mustache for upper lip?</br>  <br>It's just a cool flag.</br>  Hey guys, anyone got a translated version of pic related?<br><br>Maybe some site explaining it?</br></br>  <br>300-350 is more than enough chapters to explain shit.</br>  <br>them Dick Sucking Lips</br>  <br>Wasn't it about 70% left according to Odas editor I think?</br>  <br><br>How long before Robin will be able to do full body giant clones?<br><br> you will never be a dwarf hiding in Robin's cleavage </br></br></br></br>  <br>Damn those eyebrows on FLEEK bruh.</br>  <br>It's a compilation of sources in which Oda based characters on? There's was a shorter version of that translated in one of the threads.</br>  <br>That Hugo Boss model still keks me.</br>  <br>only have this</br>  <br>We still have at least 3 major arcs with bigger and bigger fights ahead of us. I don't think 350 Chapters is enough to finish the normal story AND explain everything that we don't have an explanation for yet.<br><br><br> Q2: How far along is the story right now, percentage-wise? <br> A: He told me that the first part of the story, the part prior to the time-skip, was around halfway through. That was about 60 volumes, so maybe we’re at 70%? I don’t think it’s at 80% yet. Something like that. </br></br></br></br></br>  Soon.  <br>Only the ones with stars are confirmed.</br>  <br>Oh shit right it was the other way around</br>  <br>Gear 4 reminds me of him. You think he can teach Luffy and others fishman karate once he joins?</br>  <br> Michael Jackson <br> Hody <br> not Jango <br>what?<br><br>also who the fuck thinks of Michael Jackson when they see Hody?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you assumed that much anyway when one piece will still be around for the next decade. Don't be so impatient.</br>  <br>Because between them and Fishman Island there was a little someone called Whitebeard</br>  <br>Robin. That outfit is so fucking hot</br>  <br><br>They should do a movie.</br></br>  <br>The original Hody looks a bit like Michael Jackson. Also fishmen are niggers and Hody become pure white.</br>  <br>He's  dead </br>  <br>Well, why not? Look at how much powerful the Strawhats became. Doffy's goddamn strong, but he started out at the level of a child as everyone else. To become this strong he had to improve step by step. Why would he suddenly stop improving during the period of two whole years? He's obviously grown a lot stronger every year to get to where he is now.</br>  <br>A warlord also lost to a guy with a 30mil bounty.</br>  <br>Nami Cowgirl style</br>  <br>An ex warlord killed a man that was considered the "Strongest in the world"</br>  <br>aaahahahahaha no</br>  <br>Whichever I could get. They're both great. A Bonney is fine too.</br>  <br>Yeah, BB <br>his entire crew<br>Akainu<br>Squardo<br>Kizaru<br>and the unforgiving backhand of time</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it's the hair and the hat, before he transforms<br>that's pretty much it</br></br>  <br>Fucking Squardo man. I don't even know what to say about him.</br>  Alright this thread is getting slow. There are people that think Zoro can take Fujitora. Zorofags come thru.    <br>Fujitora with DF or just sword?</br>  <br>I'm a Zorofag but not a retard. Neither of them has shown their full potential. Zoro's not the Strongest SM but Fujitora is part of the Marines greatest combat force.</br>  Threadly reminder  <br>Why would it be one or the other ? Fuji's used his DF by swinging his sword so both.</br>  <br>seing how dressrosa was a complete clusterfuck I'm sure he'll manage to put everything in it<br><br><br>every OP flag has a kind of meaning</br></br></br></br>  <br> his sword ate the df </br>  <br> There are people who don't understand that Fujitora, the GAMBLER, has been bluffing throughout the entire arc, and that being blind is literally the ultimate poker face. <br><br>Oda couldn't point this shit out any harder if he used a hammer made out of symbolism.</br></br></br>  <br>dat ugly flat uma thurman as robin<br>yeah... no</br></br>  <br>Well, I think Zoro is at least Fujitora's equal as as a swordsman, but I doubt he could win against a Fujitora using both sword and DF.<br><br>Really? I stopped reading a few months back in order to let the chapters pile up.</br></br></br>  <br>no, it wasn't revealed yet<br>just a theory</br></br>  <br>Let the shit posting commence.</br>  <br> dressrosa was a complete clusterfuck <br>Is it just me or was Dressrosa really not that hard to follow? Maybe it's because I got to read through it, but it wasn't confusing for me at all.<br><br> that or my reading comp is far superior from you plebs kek </br></br></br></br>  <br> Really? I stopped reading a few months back in order to let the chapters pile up. <br><br>You should start reading again if you're going arc by arc. Dressrosa arc is finished.</br></br></br>  <br>Uma Thurman is cute in Pulp Fiction.</br>  <br> Dressrosa arc is finished. <br>Not yet, we have a few more chapters. The main fight is done though. We'll probably leave around ch 800.</br></br>  <br>better ship is here</br>  <br>You're 300 posts too late.<br><br>Not hard to follow but there is so much going on its hard to get emotionally involved in the side stories, especially with a fuck ton of transient new characters.</br></br></br>  <br>Again, I don't see why it's one or the other. If Fuji is going to fight Zoro, he's gonna use his full power. Not just swing his sword. There's no reason to not use the DF.</br>  <br>only a theory supported by idiots though<br>also having a DF yourself + having a DF object wouldn't be a way of becoming OP?<br>surprised nobody did this before<br><br><br>never said it was difficult to understand<br>it's still just a shonen<br>I'm sometimes astonished to see people failing to understand even the most basic stuff in one piece<br><br>I'm just saying Oda put so many things in dressrosa:<br>the SH<br>doffy and his crew<br>law<br>fujitora<br>sabo and the rev<br>the dwarves<br>the royal family<br>the happou navy<br>king elizabello<br>bartolomeo<br>hakuba<br>big mom<br>a bit of kaidou and the other alliance<br>ceasar and the smile<br>etc...<br><br>and Oda said the NW will always be like that<br>so thinking 400 other chapters is not enough to wrap everything up...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> better <br>Best ship coming through</br></br>  <br>Arlong has you all beat.<br><br>So far the best ship in the series.</br></br></br>  <br>Is it just my virgin hormones talking or is Nami the sexiest mother fucking piece of ass in any anime or manga?</br>  <br>They're just friends though. Neither of them see each other like that.</br>  <br>filler isn't it?<br><br>I must agree with <br>shanks' is so fucking awesome, with the drakkar design and the jungle trees in the back</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's your hormones. Nami is 4th (at best) behind Robin, Perona, and Hancock.</br>  <br>For now.</br>  <br>Someone else who sees through all the shit and that Shanks' ship = best ship</br>  <br>That's a really nice image FOR ANTS.<br><br>She's up there. You rarely see so much energy in Thai tax declaration women.</br></br></br>  <br>The Oro Johnson is the baddest looking ship around.</br>  <br> Shipping God with the weakest link </br>  <br><br>plebes</br></br>  <br> Nami behind Perona and Hancock <br>Perona is barely Top Ten and Hancock's proportions are fucking disgusting. I can't do with legs twice the length of one's torso.</br></br>  <br> Nami is pointing at me telling me she wants to fuck <br><br>S-slow down babe.</br></br></br>  This is, by far, the most badass scene in manga ever  <br>This is, by far, the most badass fight scene in the manga ever.</br>  <br>Also one scene where the 'Other' translation is better then Mangastreams</br>  This is by far the most phatass scene  If we're talking about shonenshit  It was such a cheesy one liner.<br> FUCK, i want lucy to sit on me.</br>  <br>One Piece is full of badass scenes.</br>  Fairy Tail garbage bait from the OP but the other examples are acceptable for shonen  Fraid your wrong there chummer<br>This is the most badass scene in manga ever</br>  <br>Why is Lucy wearing a tracksuit?</br>  <br><br>How is FT doing? It looks like it became the fun kind of shit, I might undrop it.</br></br>  not even close  <br><br>Berserk transcends badass.</br></br>  <br>It's the same it has always been. Bad guys seem OP then good guys beat them through some ass pull save some good fights here and there. Natsu seems really bullshit ever since the last time skip though.</br>  Lucy is pretty kick-ass now. I really want to see her fight more, She honestly has one of the best abilities. <br><br><br>Its still pretty fun, It reeks of power of friendship but if I wanted a good story I wouldn't look to shonen manga.<br>It does well in what it sets out to do.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Tits and ass are literally every chapter now.<br><br>Cum back my anon.</br></br></br>  Tower of Heaven and Oracion seis were the only good arcs. Grand magic games was especially shit and god that rushed ending. This seems like the last arc and looks promising though.  <br> Remember that time Luffy punched someone? That was so epic! <br><br>You shounen fags seriously need to broaden your horizons.</br></br></br>  <br>I wanna broaden your horizons. In bed.</br>  <br> fairy tail </br>  <br>Not very likely considering you're a shounenfag :^)</br>  <br>I wanna take you to this loving place called Pound Town.</br>  <br>this holy shit.<br>Berserk is probably the worst offender<br> remember that time he got mad and cut this thing in half with his super giant sword <br><br> b-but i-its seinen <br>Not it clearly fucking isn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At first I thought I would be annoyed by that, but he draws them so nicely and the girls actually get shit done, so I can't complain.</br>  <br>Fairies are hot anon</br>  <br>This is one of the few scenes the animals did better than the manga. And the manga did it very well.</br>  <br/>  <br>Keep up the act i'm sure you won't get consumed by it.</br>  <br><br>It's okay, if I'm bored it only needs to be entertaining somehow. I even undropped naruto at the end because it was just hilarious.</br></br>  At least FT has good girls, Oda has ruined Nami it makes me so sad.  <br><br>It still looks awesome though? <br><br>I've never seen it posted as the most badass thing in berserk, ever as he has done it so many times, and the only Berserk one here is where he rides Zodd through Emperor Ganishka, he cuts shit often, but it's really well done when the scene basically mains on him cutting down rows of enemies and the reaction they get when he does it. <br><br>Think i've only seen a main focus row slash like 4 times in the manga from Guts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Fairy Tail <br> mangapanda <br>Get the fuck out.</br></br></br>  <br>M-more Lucy?</br>  <br>This. He created so much nice girls and ruined most of them.   Includng Sanji.  </br>  This is, by far the most badass scene in manga ever.  Watching, dropped, best, worst and so on.

It's the best anime I've ever seen because it's a good slice of life, because life is what art imitates and if you can present a portrayal of life at its most calming, pleasurable and satisfying, then you'll have a medium that transcends all else. It is the ultimate form of expression, art and part of the human experience. It is truly something that everyone must experience at least once in their lives. So, go watch Non Non Biyori. That's all the advice I can give you in life.  <br>Are the zombies in Gakkou Gurashi threatening? They just seem to lumber about slowly.</br>  Good:<br>NNB, Precure<br><br>Okay: <br>Symphogear, Gakkou Gurashi<br><br>Not watching: <br>everything else<br><br>Considering picking up teekyu though but I forgot which season I was on.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're threatening because of the nature of the main group.

I bet he was really happy to see tsukasa otherwise he would back down and would look like a pussy. Vape didn't really try to hurt anyone either they were just like "oh look how scary we are". But this is in the anime where everyone is good deep down.</br>  <br>As a organized group they are even strong enough to fight gatchas yes but individually? No. Another thing; the blue crowds are overseen by X, who can see through their anonymity and terminate their crowds ability. The only issue left is that the show has already implied that this means Rui could use crowds as an army, if he went off the rails like Rizumu is doing.<br><br><br>Right because a person totally can't just walk up to a stranger, stab them and slip away. You forget the same thing as the other guy, X can see through the anonymity of the blue crowds.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It was already stablished that X cannot stop a crime from occurring. She can stop it from getting worse. Second some people don't actually care whether they are caught or not. Especially mass murderers. Usually they do it with the intent of suicide. Crowds is more dangerous because you wouldn't be able to have a safe sanctuary. If you were at your house and someone wanted to kill you they would have to make a lot of noise or overcome obstacles in order to kill you and that hassle alone is enough to be a deterrent</br>  <br>Forgot to add X can stop it from getting worse if she is able to monitor them.
