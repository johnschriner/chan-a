I miss Jeff Goldblum  <br><br>Pick one or more as desired:<br>a) The manga has a very distinctive artstyle that the show has eschewed in favor of a cuter, "safer" look<br>ii. The show has taken some liberties with the source material, with one scenario that doesn't crop up until chapter 66 of the manga being adapted in episode 4 of the anime. Note that these later chapters often feature characters that haven't been properly introduced in the anime yet.<br>3: The manga itself takes about 15 chapters to hit its stride. Those familiar with the source material are unlikely to buy in until the anime reaches that point, since even the original wasn't anything special until then.<br>IV- The character who saves the manga won't formally debut until episode 6, probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Goldblum has another threadly dose else to fawn over when there's nothing Kyoani now.</br>  <br>They abandoned the manga art style for a more generic "safe" style. All this did was piss off the fans of the manga and not interest people unfamiliar with it because of its generic look.</br>  <br><br><br>What the fuck are you saying? It's not like the Otaku Know about this manga and his artstyle.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Overlord will outsell Monmusu.</br>  <br>Date? I'm expecting a sales boost from episode 4 of NNB, which was stunningly beautiful.</br>  <br>it won't since it's from Madhouse.</br>  <br>I like them both equally</br>  <br>Shit like that gets anime to boost manga sales.</br>  <br>19 July</br>  <br>I like Jitsuwa too. Had a feeling the really different character designs would cause it to flop. Vampire waifus are hot though. The whole not aging thing.</br>  <br>I like this show but never read the manga<br>does that mean Ill hate the manga as much as manga readers hate the anime?</br></br>  <br> I'm expecting a sales boost from episode 4 of NNB <br><br>Actually the first volume sank in the amazon ranking after the episode aired<br><br>I guess the japs don't like the new season so much?

Sorry for the delay, but I had to download and read the entire body of translated work, twice, to find an appropriate image.</br>  <br>... Okay</br>  <br>Jitsu wa Watashi wa must be really triggering some peoples autism.<br><br>Just calm down, anon.</br></br></br>  The current season is quite good for backlogging, I don't have the patience to keep up with all the "neat but slow to get going" animes on a weekly basis  <br>I'm backloggin because I came into the season late, so I had good subs for 1/2 episodes for most shows and don't want to go with HS for the rest, so I'm just gonna keep working on the eternal backlog</br>  <br>I'm a pleb that doesn't mind using HS, but I really can't be assed to go after the many shows in this season that look enticing</br>  <br>Yes it did.</br>  <br><br>I am a somewhat casual anime watcher, are HS considered bad or something? I usually just download w/e has the most seeds.</br></br>  <br> I want my karaoke plus I like the typesetting better than HS for most sub groups </br>  <br>And rosy cheeks everywhere.</br>  <br><br>I like how people refuse to count the game package for God Eater but are more than happy to include it for iDOLM@STER CG. Talk about a double standard.</br></br>  <br><br>If it keeps thrusting fan service in peoples faces it'll probably end up a 4-5K seller.</br></br>  <br><br>You mean King Records with their event tickets and whole volume registration bonus. If people actually think this show is doing that well cause of the anime then I don't even know what to say. The best way to see how it would be doing based on the anime alone is to look at the non-Amazon versions of the show sans the Nana Mizuki event ticket.<br><br>http://www27392u.sakura.ne.jp/show.<wbr>cgi?n=B010WF9HKG<br><br>That's the shows actually level of potential by itself 5 days after being listed and getting it's first episode boost. Not bad, but nothing out of this world.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wonder how many people on the production committee are going to seppuku because of this.</br>  <br><br>Good thing the anime industry doesn't solely rely on disc sales to keep itself afloat the same way people think it does. Shitty late night anime with no other merchandise or means of income maybe, but anime isn't going anywhere just yet. There existed a time for anime before the big boom of BD/DVD sales in the mid 2000's and there will exist a time after. Like seriously fuck Garo and Ace of Diamond get jack shit in terms of disc sales and both have gotten second seasons with the latter running over 100 episodes because people like them, they got solid ratings, they pleased the sponsors and advertising interests, and they moved product and drew attention for their franchises.</br></br>  <br><br>Considering Vol 2 didn't even hit the 25K mark with the G4U pack tie-included I severely doub that. In fact I'm not even sure it actually hit 20K with said tie-in pack. Not that it matters cause Bandai is looking at the overall multimedia package which as far as I can tell is doing fine, though it's kind of a quantity over quality affair right now. Something like a new music CD every other week for like the last 6 months.</br></br>  <br>yea, the art is ass regardless</br>  <br>seems like it will do decently<br><br>this is old<br><br>wut</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Behold the faggot in his native environment, pissing on a corpse in hopes that the other retards think he's cool<br><br><br>Seriously, besides being part of the voodoo equation to determine sequels, why does anyone care about sales and ranking?<br>With the way /a/ rags on anything that gets too popular, you'd think we'd love God Eater and the like</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This isnt anything like the show you clearly haven't watched it.</br>  <br>/a/ doesn't watch anime</br>  <br>anyone have the real estimates?</br>  <br>One of the MCs has to sell his body for money, the other is an autistic mid thirties deaf lolicon virgin</br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>dont spread your pedo memes</br>  <br><br>Most likely will, look at aku no potato for reference, shit adaption that didn't stay true to the manga's art style.</br></br>  <br>All items in that list you quoted is severely underestimated.

Good riddance, I hope this kill the fanbase in /a/ too after the anime ended, just like what happen with Akame.<br><br>Glad this trash flopped</br></br>  <br>Yeah, No. The manga will always be popular and it will be more popular after the anime.</br>  <br> more popular </br>  <br> ellipsis <br><br><br><br>Pic related<br><br><br>Kill yourselves.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128744616 <br> *frowny face emoticon* <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't we care? It impacts what anime will get second seasons.</br>  Jitsu leans heavily on reaction images and silly art. The anime is shit as fuck.    <br>Why did vol 1 get 40k? event ticket? or other thing? how can it dropped so much to 20k</br>  <br>They were not going to animate this distinctive style?<br><br>What idiots.</br></br></br>  <br>No, 5k for average shows, but it depends how much money they invest to create the show and how much the other media sales get boosted</br>  <br>It was known pretty early on, everyone expected a flop.<br>Truly the worst decision they could make.</br></br>  <br>the latest manga thread reached the bump limit, the anime threads keep floping</br>  <br><br><br>Rant anons reasons why Jitsu anime failure all because the Art part 1 or explaining why "The Art" caused this flop. <br><br>Background:<br><br>Why are anime made? <br><br>According to many a wise anon the anime is to advertise the manga/ Ln/Vn. The anime will take a small portion of what "source material" <br>is available and stick it on TV. Its more of what we want to fund and bring in more popularity to make more of what we want, <br>generating income from fans already of the manga by expectations of more of what they want, bluerays and merch. <br><br><br>Manga &gt; Anime &gt; Merch &gt; Money. <br><br><br>Now, if the manga is established to a style and has been <br>running that way since conception then you would expect the anime to continue that, no?<br><br>This anon picked up Jitsu from an OPT. <br><br>I knew nothing of its contents or even what the title meant. Started reading it about when chapters 20 or 30 was being translated <br>Its that long ago I forgot but I've read through 3 or so times its a fun read. <br><br>Its good artwork that got better as it was produced. P2 soon<br><br><br>This guy gets it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>/co/ here; western comics are pretty much a dead medium and should really be sold on abacuses rather than paper, but even THEY can expect to sell more product than this shit, wtf?</br></br>  <br><br><br>Now to make a hype train<br><br>Fans will hype the anime, thus giving a good report back to the community and the hype train continues. <br><br>With the amount of hype that happened when each chapter came out on /a/ meant we would have ate this shit up, but I'm sure <br>most feel the same way I do. Just didn't bother. They didn't even realise the one thing that made it special. <br><br>The art shift is so plain and disproportional that the established fans of the manga will wane that shit so hard that<br>even downloading and watching it is too much effort. Dropped before it even aired. <br>So the initial hype that's needed to kick off the anime fell flat. Both for the Japanese as per ABYSMAL amazon stats and us western fans<br>that all realise that its shit. <br><br>The art also effects western fans merch wise. No one will want merch with these ugly a fuck designs on them. <br>I suspect Goodsmile would pick up a small run of droids. Perhaps fuck around with the designs to not make them fuck ugly. <br><br>Anime flop &gt; No TV advertising &gt; limited sales of merch. However we are left to see is where the manga sales and story go from here. <br>Anime flop leading to down turned manga sales is unlikely in this instance due to how popular and established it is right now <br>for both Japanese and Western audiences. <br><br><br>Its hard to compare it to anything really. That rotascoped aku no hana was experimenting with different animation tech <br>and it worked in some places and in others it lead to the "quality" but this is just pissing in the eyes of the manag readers for jitsu.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>wasn't it an anon who bought the tankobon when there wasn't any raws?</br>  <br><br><br>Nice Blog</br></br></br>    <br><br><br>too bad for jitsu wa then?</br></br></br>  <br>low quality b8</br>  <br>These are VERY old estimates<br><br>not updated to date</br></br></br>   Jitsu wa watashi wa Art evolution <br><br>Why no one is talking about Rokka No yuusha flop?<br> Next Spice and Wolf they said. </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128751866 <br><br><br><br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128744616 <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Why is this thread so shit and infested with cancer from other websites and boards?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> *6.3k Prison School <br> *6.0k Working!!! <br> *5.8k To Love Ru Darkness S2 <br> *2.2k Gangsta. <br> *2.0k Gatchaman Crowds insight <br><br> Shimoneta to Iu Gainen <br> Jitsu wa Watashi wa <br><br>Japan still has shit taste, whoopty do what a fucking surprise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Blame the tumblr tier arts of the manga</br>  <br>fuck your taste, this manga is great</br>  <br>Like at all?</br>  <br>No brakes on PURI PURISON train.</br>  Why are BDs the only thing ever quoted?<br>I want to see contract documents, earnings statements, and balance sheets.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say its bad for jitsu manga wise, it hurts the name a bit but I bet someone over at <br>TMS Entertainment corporate is more pissed that a manga that sells thousands <br>isn't making fucking gangbusters right now.

Something I've always liked looking at too. <br>Yeah, network air time considerations are something I always wonder about. not alot of information coming from the broadcasting side of things. which is a pretty important distribution aspect. when people think about the industry they only think of animation studios and consumers but there is a whole lot more as broadcasting anime is just a subset of the broader entertainment industry. <br><br>I still think most of the financing comes from publishing companys looking to get 20 minute commercials to flog their books.</br></br></br></br>  Owari no Seraph thread.  How much does the anime cover in manga and LN?  <br>The LN serves as prequel to the manga. I think it's four years before the events of the manga. The anime doesn't cover any of it. (I'd imagine we'll get an OVA based on the LN or something eventually.) And right now, the anime has covered the first four volumes of the manga exactly.</br>  <br>Thank you, it seems translation of the LN has been abandoned, i guess i will have to try MT it?</br>  <br>Can't answer that question.

I doubt he'll release his seraph again, ad on top of that Mika seems like he's starting to trust the Shinoa squad.</br>  <br>Option 1: Mika leaves a unconscious Yuu in a safe place and goes back to help the squad, arrives in time to be confronted by Krul directly wrecking everybody with her army<br><br>Option 2: Yuu wakes up and goes batshita asking where Shinoa and the others are, but can barely move. Mika promises to go back to help them because he owes them one anyway.<br><br>Option 3: No focus on Mika or Yuu. Full focus on the squad's battle against Krul army with Kureto finally arriving at the last minute and Krul recognizing Shinoa as being related to Mahiru</br></br></br></br></br>  Do you guys think Mika's every gonna become a proper vampire and drink human blood?  <br>I doubt it. Author has delayed it for so long I can't see it happening anymore. With the Shinoa-Mika trust thing now I also can't see him going full vampire.</br>  <br>I see Mika turning back to save them, the guilt was getting to him. Maybe he'll finally awaken his Seraph?</br>  I have an entire folder of her and I haven't even watched the show.<br><br>Maybe I should do that</br></br>  I'm watching this for Mika. Did this make me a fujoshit?  <br><br>There's a 50/50 chance he either becomes one or somehow goes back to being human<br><br>In the novels Guren's blood gets contaminated with a demon curse put on him by Mahiru, but it seems he was able to go back to being human (still not explained how) but his blood type changed from a type-A to a type-O. So considering Mika is part vampire because of the vampire blood Krul implanted in him there may be a chance to remove/replace it and make him go back to being human even if he becomes a full vampire</br></br></br></br>  <br>I have an entire folder of her and I've read the manga.</br>  <br>She alone could not redeem the show.</br>  <br>Unless you are shipping him with another guy, no. Is just husbando faggotry</br>  <br>She is also my wallpaper.</br>  <br>Is it just me that thinks he could have gotten away with kissing her? Like she would let him.</br>  <br>Naw. She's obviously in denial.</br>  <br>I just want Yuu to wake up and have a fucking normal conversation with Mika. I have a feeling they won't be the focus of the upcoming chapter but I just need them to talk it out and move on.</br>  <br>Dude, you say it like it was some kind of missunderstanding.</br>  <br>It was some kind of misunderstanding.</br>  I haven't been around for a wile, mika kill anyone on Yu's side last chapter?  <br>Nope.<br>As a matter of fact, Shinoa went out of her way to make sure Mika didn't get attacked by anyone on the human side.</br></br>  <br>Oh, anyone got a link to it?</br>  <br>http://kissmanga.com/Manga/Owari-no<wbr>-Serafu/Chapter-034?id=232374</wbr></br>  <br> still holding out hope of any romantic development <br><br>You must be new here</br></br></br>  <br>"I want to believe"</br>  <br>"hope"</br>  <br>Thanks</br>    <br>You're welcome.</br>  If Mika isn't the Seraph of the Beginning I'm going to be really mad.    This thread does't have enough Shinoa.  <br>I agree.</br>    I hope this will get scanned along with the 3 other Seraph doujins he made in the past    <br>What's the title of this doujin?</br>  <br>Kazoku BLOW</br>    <br>You lied to me.</br>  <br>But I didn't...?</br>  <br>Oh... sorry... google just isn't a good source I guess... If it's not to much to ask, can I get a link to it?</br>  <br>Shinoa should be the main character.</br>  <br>Shinoa should be swallowing the main character's cum.</br>  <br> her face when her forearm is the exact same length Yuichiro's erect cock <br> she gives it her best shot </br></br>  I need more of this smug.  So, in the shower scene, did Shinoa and that blonde girl fug?  <br>(the blonde girl is Mitsuba, by the way)<br>Naw, I think it was just some friendly, no-homo breast fondling. Of course, Shinoa was the only one doing the fondling though.</br></br>  <br>October cant come sooner.</br>  <br>Most amazing blow job Yuu will ever have.</br>  <br>Machine translate</br>  <br> Shinoa was the only one doing the fondling though. <br>Because there's nothing to fondle on her?</br></br>  <br>That, and Mitsuba was obviously not into it.</br>  At least there isn't a love triangle in this, right? Besides the OTP who else is there?  <br>Aren't Shinoa and Krul, like, the only relevant girls in the series?</br>  <br>There's also Mahiru, Shinoa's sister who is now Guren's demon.</br>  <br>I know about her but doesn't she only appears in flashbacks?</br>  <br>She's shown briefly in the anime, but in the manga, she's mentioned multiple times, and shown a few times. She's also one of the main characters in the LN. (Which by the way, the LN is a prequel to the manga/anime taking place five years before the manga/anime.)</br>  New chapter when? i'm curious what faggot Mika will do  <br><br>I only read the manga, and half of it was in French which I'm only passable with, but didn't the Shinoa rival seem to have some slight (irrelevant) triangle going when Shinoa visited Yuu in the hospital?</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but I wouldn't call it irrelevant. There's a few scenes afterwords where Shinoa shows romantic interest in Yuichiro. They're rare, but you can tell that the mangakas are going for some gradual, believable, realistic build up for Shinoa's feelings towards Yuichiro.</br>  <br>She doesn't so much into Yuu or try to pursue him, the writer seems to ship her more with Kimizuki in later chapters</br>  <br>"She" refers to Mitsuba</br>  <br>Oh, not Yuu and Shinoa being irrelevant, I meant the other girl's thing for him was irrelevant.</br>  <br>Basically, yeah.</br>  More Shinoa.      short is best  <br>What did she see?</br>      <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=873<wbr>f2pGvzLI</wbr>  [ ]</br>  angry shinoa is cute too  <br>Why does this make me laugh so much?</br>  Fuck your Shinoas.    <br>Blasphemy.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128747594 <br>Shinoa any day.</br>  Am I the only one here who absolutely loves the manga's artwork?  <br>anime art &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; manga art</br>          Wow, this thread is still active?  Watched for smug. Stayed for smug, loli vampire Krul and Gren.  <br>Gren?</br>  <br>Guren whoops</br>  Shinoa was born on Christmas.<br>Shinoa is the second coming.</br>  <br>Why the fuck did the mangakas give her a blood type?</br>  Sexy vampire  We still Shinoa posting?  I honestly feel like the reason Mitsuba is such a bitch is because her pussy is so tight that it physically hurts.  <br>Like... so tight that it starts to spiral in?</br>  <br>Of course.</br>  Is this show worth it just for Shinoa? Even with bullshit magic arrows annihilating helicopters?  <br>I recomend the manga.<br> looks better <br> longer <br> actually gets kinda good eventually </br></br></br></br>    <br>He's gonna have to either go full vampire or find a cure. At this point vampire blood is no longer sufficient.<br><br>So his options are:<br> 1 - drink human blood and go full vampire <br> 2 - continue starving himself and become a demon, after which he becomes someone's new Cursed Gear <br> 3 - find a cure that will turn him human again <br> 4 - go full Seraph and end the world </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They'd all be just as smug as their mother.</br>  <br>why not?</br>  <br>And if you want to english his name it is supposed to be Glen</br>    Look at those feet  Anyone got links for scans of translated 34 and 35? Or are they just uploaded onto the online readers like batoto?  <br>this.</br>    <br>C'mon I agree the writing is garbage but the school bait is just stupid. At least try harded</br>  <br>look at those finger tips.</br>  <br>Apparently in the bible the second coming of Christ is the only thing that can stop the seven judgements<br><br>I wonder if the mangaka thought this through. Its also the same day the first apocalypse happened in the story, kind of reminds me of Guilty Crown with the whole lost Christmas and shit</br></br></br>  <br>34 is on kissmanga.<br>35 has only been translated by viz as of right now.</br></br>  <br>Is that her LN version? Because it's delicious</br>  <br>They look pretty gross tbh</br>  <br>35 has been out too if you search it on online readers you would find it</br>  <br>Yeah.</br>    <br><br>I see 35 but it's marked as 35.1 in mangafox<br><br>Anyway thanks</br></br></br></br>  <br>If you look up "great" in the dictionary, you'll see this picture.</br>  <br>She is</br>  <br>You can find them in the archive you know.</br>  <br>It'd actually be really cool to see Mika replace Asuramaru, or maybe even possess Yu's sword with Asuramaru. They'd be like shoulder angles.</br>  <br>Then what will they do with Ashuramaru? He is one of the strongest demon</br>  <br>Fuck I'm retarded. Thanks for pointing it out.</br>  <br>It would be even cooler if Mika goes back to being human and Krul becomes his sword, that way he and Yuu can have sibling swords to add more fuel to the family theme</br>  Remember when these faggots first joined the military?  <br>You're right, that would be pretty cool.</br>  <br>No, and while they are great fap material I fucking hate Guren's sluts<br><br>Specially the brown haired one is Sakura-levels of retarded</br></br></br>  <br>Mito (red one) is pretty great though. Just because her gear is a pair of metal gauntlets. She punches vampires, and the they disintegrate. That's fuckin' rad.</br>  <br>but she is tsundere with Guren, i don't like tsundere</br>  But the real question is, in LN terms, who is the best girl?  <br>She still punches vampires. Being a tsundere can't change that. Not now, not ever.</br>  what a big phone or shinoa is too small?  <br>The least offensive one is the himecut kuudere</br>  <br>She can't see over a fucking steering wheel at fifteen. I think it's a pretty safe deduction that she's just fucking tiny, even at ten/</br>  <br>her smugness turns me on</br>  <br>Well, she is stoic but i won't call her kuudere she is pretty loyal toward Guren, have the real servant attitute</br>  <br> her smugness turns me on <br><br>Will she get Megami posters?</br></br></br>  <br>She's literally just as tall as kid Mika.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=wyS<wbr>rC9O5eUY</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Because Yuu was too busy thinking about boys.</br>  <br>Mahiru</br>  Seraph of the End-my-fucking-life-right-now-I'm-b<wbr>egging-you-please</wbr>  <br>cute</br>  <br>Yeah, definitely Mahiru.</br>  <br>What are they even talking about in this video?</br>  <br>it is omake, anon translated it on past thread<br><br>Mika: Sigh...<br>Yuu: What's wrong, Mika? Something worrying you?<br><br>Mika: Oh, hey Yuu.<br>Yuu: Geez! I told you to stop shouldering our burdens alone!<br><br>Mika: But I don't think I should share this...<br>Yuu: Spit it out already!!<br><br>Mika: Okay. I was thinking this story would have more flair with me as the main character.<br>Yuu: Crawl off and die!!<br><br>"Who's the Main Character?!"<br>Mika: Yuu, it's a bad thing for a story to have a bland main character!<br>Mika: You need flair, like me!!<br>Yuu: Sure, say it to my face.<br>Mika: Well, you did tell me to spit it out.<br>Yuu: Urk!<br><br>Shinoa: I see. He does have a point.<br><br>Shinoa: I think if I were a magical girl, the series would sell like hotcakes.<br>Yuu: No, that's not even the same story!<br><br>Guren: Why don't you just make me the main character?<br>Yuu: You're already the main character of the novels!!!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>thanks, m8</br>  <br>Is this your first anime?</br>  I just woke up. Thread is still active. I love you /a/nons.  <br>No. I just don't see a reason to give a character blood type when it isn't relevant to the story at all.</br>  <br> we will never get a magical smug-chan spinoff <br>why even live?</br></br>  <br>Japs are big on blood types.</br>  <br><br><br>it's relevant since Guren changed his blood type</br></br></br>  why is she so cute?  <br>I don't think the setting is the problem (school didn't happen for long anyway) it's how the characters act. It's like the setting and plot is interesting but the characters feel like something from an somewhat ecchi romcom.</br>  <br>People believe blood type can influence personality of the character.<br><br><br>Because she is a midget.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I love those colors.</br>  <br> midget </br>  <br>That's why omnipandering is cancer</br>  <br><br>That's because this series specifically panders to fujoshits, self-insert fags and haremfags. <br><br>If the author wasn't so busy trying to get easy bucks out of the worse possible audience, this series would be more decent</br></br></br></br>  <br> That's because this series specifically panders to fujoshits, self-insert fags and haremfags. <br>That's what omnipandering implies</br></br>  <br>It's funny because people are generally not attracted to things they feel are trying to pander to them. Look at all of the more serious series that have no pandering. If the story is good people will read it and draw a hell of a lot of porn of it too. Gay porn too, since fujos love to warp reality for their fantasies. They don't actually want characters to be gay though. For otaku perverts you have to be subtle, because more than anything they get excited by what they imagine, not what they see.</br>  why does guren look like toru from chaika  <br>He is level 16 Toru.</br>  Place your bets gentlemen.  i bet on that psycho kid he only kills shit while nicolas started to like bitches that makes him soft  rip in peace Daiz  Ncolas best girl   2015 <br> still using cheek mouth </br>  <br>It's easier to animate.<br><br>No excusing manga/stand-alone images that do it though.</br></br></br>  <br> 2015 <br> Not evolving to have a mouth on your cheek </br></br>  KyoAni finds a way!  Sidemouth is one of my worst pet peeves.  <br>Did you notice the animes have huge eyes and miniscule noses too? Lmao</br>  Cheek mouth did nothing wrong  <br> not having a mouth on both cheeks </br>  <br>Now just fill in the blank</br>  <br>About that.</br>  <br> visible lips where they should be <br>She has a hole in her cheek, and no lower teeth or tongue at all.<br><br>Cannot unsee.<br><br><br>No.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> haha animation doesn't mimic reality perfectly xDD </br>  <br>Durarara!!x2 is a cancer because of cheek mouth.</br>  <br>Fucking hell</br>  <br>Finally! The elusive contact lens scene. I want to see this animated. Do they just expand when on the eye? Do they have gigantic lens containers?</br>  Is that time once again, /a/?  <br>what the fuck's going on in this picture</br>  <br><br>Actually it's two people there.</br></br>  Cheek mouth was a mistake.  FUCKING WHY   this thread   <br>10th time I've seen this, and I'm still confused as hell.</br>  <br>Please save us!</br>  <br>The only part that is really fucked up is her waist and legs, which seems to be backwards.<br><br>Other than that it makes more or less sense</br></br></br>  <br>The art also got worse.</br>  <br>Fuck, did I accidentally take Quaaludes myself? I'm not the only one seeing this, right?</br>  <br>It's like a Picasso thing</br>  <br>The artist forgot to consider the anatomy of the neck; her head is in the wrong position</br>  <br>Based KyoAni does it again!</br>  <br>how can you know this little about anatomy <br><br>have you seen a human being before?</br></br></br>  Budget<br>Each episode would cost double if animators had to do lips.</br>  <br>Guaranteed QUALITY replies.</br>  <br>It's like this. Her chin is almost touching her chest.</br>    <br>Quality thread?<br>Quality thread.</br></br>   being too dumb to understand stylization   <br>oh fuck I lost it.</br>  Mistake or intentional?  <br>This would be a really good image if it weren't for that third leg.</br>  <br>2 Vaginas.</br>  <br> Plot twist: It's actually a Monster Musume character that's part centipede. </br>  <br>Shit I can't find the reply to this image</br>  <br>That isn't a third leg down there, it's her huge hairless balls.</br>  <br> plot twist, it was just her enormous feminine cock tucked inside her ass </br>  <br>MIYAZAKIIIIIIIIII!</br>    <br>I don't get it. What was the mistake that's being encircled?</br>  <br><br>I could have sworn simpsons did a gag like this, where homer puts on a ridiculous sized contact lens for his cartoon eyes, but google is failing me.</br></br>  <br>You're actually talking to the original artist.</br>    <br>Dunno. Maybe they were running short on money for the last few movies. Or maybe the one guy who knew how to draw mouths progressively lost his motor skills over the years, and the one guy who could draw noses died in a car crash.</br>  <br>Cheeky.</br>  <br>Kyoani seems to randomly switch between drawing it correctly and drawing cheek mouth. It's confusing as fuc</br>  <br> The circle is the mistake. It wasn't added in, it was there when it aired. </br>  <br>Shading got severely shittier too.</br>     cheek mouth in manga     <br>It has nothing to do with money, their character designers just gradually tried to ape Takeuchi's drawing style more.</br>    <br>So they're just idiots?</br>  This guy must be living the anime life!  <br>Now blame otaku for it.</br>  <br>Based KyoAni is based!</br>    <br>Well the mouh is correct</br>  <br>Intentional. It's obviously symbolism.</br>  <br><br/></br>    <br>Thank you anon.</br>    <br>I'm not seeing it.</br>  <br>Piccolo blasted the moon apart again?</br>  <br>Is "it" her fucking ear?

Shortstack means that the are lso stacked, either in the tits or ass, which has nothing to do with their height and head size.</br></br>  <br>Blowing 3000 drawings in the first 5 minutes or so is hardly low-budget.</br>    <br>7-8 heads is highly stylized herculean/comicsmusclemacho type. K-ON's proportions are alright, especially in the anime itself.<br><br>And no side-mouths are not QUALITY, it a type of stylization, you're free to not like it but it doesn't make it wrong.<br>It's fun how people never find anything to bash KyoAni with so they resort to badly done promo art and "muhmoeblobs" wich are issues all the studio have.</br></br></br></br>  <br>NON-EUCLIDEAN HENTAI!</br>  <br>It's even worse than that. The eye sockets are too low for the ones on the one's on the right.</br>  <br> 10 fps isn't low budget </br>    <br>It's badly done stylized animation.</br>    <br> what is frame modulation <br>Also, that is a lot by anime standards. An entire Toei TV anime episode has that drawing count on average.</br></br>  <br>Side mouths are QUALITY. Come the fuck on. It's anatomically retarded and only done out of laziness. Please don't defend side mouth. I don't care about studio flame wars, but side mouth is fucking dumb.</br>  <br> It's easier to animate. <br>Explain further. I can not begin to comprehend how this is savingany substantial amount of time or effort, especially in the digital age.<br><br>Then go ahead and explain why it shows up in manga.</br></br></br></br>    <br> side-mouths are not QUALITY, it a type of stylization <br>KyoAni-fags, everyone.</br></br>  <br>This is what 3Dpigdisgustingfags want to believe.</br>  <br> especially in the digital age. <br>How is that relevant?</br></br>    <br>Fucking hell, every time</br>  <br>He never said anime was a mistake, dipshit. It's a fake quote.<br><br>Now, in that documentary whatever, he does talk about how otaku ruined anime on the technical side, which is definitely true.</br></br></br>  <br>if you're too stpid to understand while extra detail which requires more care to get the proportions right to look good requires more man hours and hence more money then you'll never understand.<br><br><br>there isn't a good reason wy it happens in manga except that the author isn't good at drawing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> more man hours and hence more money <br>Animators are paid by shot, and inbetweeners by drawing.</br></br>    <br>I don't get it. What's the problem?</br>  <br>You aren't even explaining the worst part: the neck and head.</br>  <br>Why<br>  actually it looks kind of cool. </br></br>  Do you people not realise that sidemouths have to exist in the 2D dimension otherwise you wouldn't be able to tell the characters facial expressions half the time  <br>Are you retarded? The actual amount of effort it takes to animate all that extra detail is near non-existant.

Shut up, Miki.</br>  Reading's for fags and yuropoors.  <br>I mean I prefer all sorts of cartoons and manga on physical form rather than on a pc of any sort.<br>For manga to be pop you need lots of ppl collecting physical manga books which is expensive.</br></br>   mfw so many americunts post &gt;reading despite watching subbed anime <br><br>The reason is that manga isn't as hyperstimulating as most anime so ADHD retards (most young American adults and 4chan shitposters) don't care as much</br></br>  <br>What the fuck are you talking about?</br>  <br> Why is manga so unpopular compared to anime in the West when it's the inverse that applies in Japan? <br>reasons for mangas unpopularity in west is what im talking about</br></br>  <br>Those t shirts are stupid as fuck</br>  <br>How is any of what you said in that post related to the previous posts?<br>Or are you just retarded and felt like replying to an unrelated post?</br></br>  <br><br>MAN IM NOT THAT GUY BUT YOU'RE TALKIN ABOUT PIRACY/STREAMING ANIME WHEN YOU CAN DO THE SAME FOR MANGA<br><br>LMAO RETARD</br></br></br></br>  <br>Obviously you had no Harry Potter as a child. Or Captain Underpants.</br>  <br> her headband made out of artificial flowers </br>  <br>That's part of what makes the picture hilarious.</br>  <br><br> Why is manga so unpopular compared to anime in the West when it's the inverse that applies in Japan? <br><br>How can you not observe how reading (and reading comprehension) declined drastically in the USA? Many bookstores have gone out of business and even used bookstores have died out. People just don't read (much) anymore and the attitudes about reading have changed. Now, you see a lot of "Too Long Didn't Read" or "Why the Blog Post?" in forums from people who hate seeing anything longer than several sentences. <br><br>Downloading of hentai manga and doujinshi doesn't count as reading because....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't read shit</br>  <br>Because Borders went out of business.</br>  <br>can you pirate physical manga books which is the best way to experience manga?</br>  For me it's about consistency. There are so many manga that are either partially translated, on hiatus, span many volumes with no end in sight, or are just cancelled abruptly. Because of these reasons I've probably dropped more manga than I've actually finished.  <br>Then why don't really read things that are completely translated?</br>  America =! The west.<br>France and Italy read manga more than anyone else outside of Asia. You can buy a tank for 4€.</br>  <br> Obviously you had no Harry Potter as a child. <br><br>Harry Potter was an anomaly that the publishing industry thought could help reverse the drastic decline in reading. It wasn't purely about selling more books. The issue of trying to re-popularize reading with children is why so many bookstores bent over backwards to open at midnite just to make sure that kids got a hold of books. However, it remained just that - an anomaly for the most part.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude I jut masturbated</br>  <br> Harry Potter </br>  <br>Are there more manga translated in French or Italian than English? I'm considering learning either of those languages for that purpose since Japanese is 2hard.</br>  <br>I prefer Anime cuz soundtrack is a big part of an entertainment medium, and with manga which has no soundtrack, it can't build any tension, convey emotion or do anything.<br>My most favourite examples of this are Kaiji and Berserk.<br>Berserk anime was kinda bad in a way, if not for Susumu Hirasawa's soundtracks which made it a masterpiece, Kaiji had Hideki Taniuchi as the compositor and so did Death Note, and this is why both those anime shows are so superior to manga, they could actually convey emotion, while manga is just story, and very often that story is dumb and not interesting, aside from maybe Berserk and Railgun out of what i read, and also some manga-only stories like Uzumaki and Trigun Maximum</br></br></br>  <br>Amazon has been offering some good prices these days too. The first volume of OPM is on pre-order for only 6 bucks.</br>  <br>fuck off faggot I just fapped as well</br>  <br>I have been doing that more, but there are still other interesting series that may be incomplete. I keep reading and hoping to see the end.</br>  <br> manga which has no soundtrack, it can't build any tension, convey emotion or do anything <br>You need to read some better manga, m8.</br></br>  <br> can you pirate physical manga books which is the best way to experience manga? <br>Hey gramps, 1998 called and said they want you back.</br></br>  <br>nice blog faggot</br>  <br>I, too, have fapped recently. Please stop.</br>  <br>On PC you just get distracted and end up not reading anything, it just doesn't feel right on a screen as it does on a physical copy of the manga</br>  <br>use your imagination</br>  <br>Get that ADHD checked out.</br>  Printed media is dying in the west, whereas Japan, as conservative as it is, seems to have a very dedicated industry that's still holding pretty well mostly due to its accessibility and portability.<br><br>Not only manga, but also LN's have a huge consumer base, you will see people of all ages reading manga and LN's, they also read it everywhere, on the way to work or at home, at school or bookstores.<br><br>Not only do the people consume it as form of entertainment, but also appreciate it for the trade and aspire to become mangakas one day.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can hate a children's book all you want for having shoddy writing, but it was a children's book, bro. And it did a good job of entertaining children.</br>  <br>Exactly, you can't.</br>  <br>That is not the fault of the manga or the PC. That is you, that is your problem. I will agree that reading something you can hold in your hands is a better experience.<br><br><br> he doesn't just print out the pages, make the glue by hand and assemble his own manga <br>Fucking casuals.</br></br></br></br></br>  Pretty much all the downsides to manga in the Western fandom like licensing issues, pricing, translation quality, scanlation drama, decline of bookstores/printed media are a non-factor in Japan.<br><br><br>A lot more in French.</br></br></br>  <br>Aren't all LNs niche otaku shit?</br>  <br>Try getting a phone app and reading manga on that. That was the only way I could really start reading manga. Phones make it harder to flip through different applications and they're portable.</br>  <br> Because Borders went out of business. <br><br>Dalton Books was a major bookstore chain that used to be in every major mall also disappeared. Waldenbooks was another bookstore chain often in the same mall because books were popular up to the late 1980's. The Tower Books chain (related to Tower Records) was famous for its closures.</br></br></br>  <br>B-but the trees</br>  <br>There are four billion manga running at any given time, few of which get physical or legal English releases. Also, Americans don't read  I have the opposite problem and can't concentrate on a show but can read through manga no problem. </br>  <br>Maybe, i tried reading top MAL recommendations lol and went from there with what i liked more. I read FMA, NGE, Berserk, Railgun, Uzumaki, Steins;Gate, FLCL,Yotsuba&amp;!, Akame ga Kill, Nisekoi, Deadman Wonderland, Tokyo Ghoul and Naruto  and so far none of these really felt that great, they were just bad or insuperior to the anime.<br><br> it's your fault for liking a better experience <br>What are you even trying to say?<br><br>Might try that, but it won't be free will it? Especially on iCuck?<br><br>Don't have none<br><br>I did, and i even put some soundtrack up in my headphones but the pacing just isn't the same it's all too fast or too slow in some moments.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Mmm dat book smell</br></br>  <br><br>That depends on the title, but lately is gaining a lot of popularity, considering the many LN adaptations we've seen every so often in the last couple of years.You are probably thinking about Dōjinshi.</br></br>  <br> lol <br> Cuck <br> insuperior <br>Man, I really hope this is bait and you're not actually sixteen.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your attention span is shit then.<br>Reading manga instead of reading anime is like reading episode summaries on wikia, you are just getting info, not the whole experience</br></br>  <br> Maybe, i tried reading top MAL recommendations <br><br>Kill yourself any time.</br></br></br>  <br> stop saying words i don't like! </br>  <br>You what? There is no whole experience if it's a manga original.</br>  <br>Well, where else was i supposed to go? Reddit? That's even worse and rec threads on /a/ aren't allowed. Googling "best manga" will just bring up One Piece, Naruto and Bleach</br>  <br>Oh man I'm sorry I'm not a big fan of pages blurred to hell to hide all the noise in bad scans.</br>  <br>Maybe if I could understand nip it would be better, because as it is I've begun to feel more and more recently like most dialogue scenes are just 10% reading the dialogue and 90% me sitting through a picture of some guy saying gibberish emphatically.</br>  <br>What? You do realize that digital distribution is a thing right?<br>Or did you just wake up from a coma?</br></br>  <br> Images can't invoke emotions without sound <br>Man what a faggot, why are you even on an imageboard if you need your precious sound tracks to get into anything?</br></br>  <br>the wiki</br>  <br> not having an extension that reads every 4chan post that's highlighted with the voice of the Kaiji narrator </br>  <br><br>Find a genre you like and learn how to use the tag system in manga sites. And read more stuff targeted at your actual age demographic if you aren't a teenager anymore.</br></br>  <br> Paying full price for a drm scan that you don't even really own. <br>I'll stick to paper books thank you.</br></br>  <br>I'm listening to music right now.<br>Soundtracks are the main attraction about anime for me, i'm sorry if you're some kinda SoL moeshit watcher and your show has nothing but electro-guitar or vocaloid music in but still.<br><br>and when someone posts a bait posts it says "Zawa"<br>that would be rad</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it's your fault for liking a better experience <br> What are you even trying to say? <br>He was saying it's your fault that you get distracted when on a PC, not the fault of manga as a medium or the PC/internet itself. <br><br>And yes it would be free to read manga on your phone. You aren't very intelligent are you?</br></br></br></br></br>  Guys, the "manga sucks because there's no music" guy is clearly shitposting, just drop it.  <br> you aren't very intelligent are you? <br>Or i just don't use my phone/any manga site which is why i lack the knowledge how do i do that?</br></br>  <br> Soundtracks are the main attraction about anime for me, i'm sorry if you're some kinda SoL moeshit watcher and your show has nothing but electro-guitar or vocaloid music in but still. <br>Nah I'm not that into moeshit, I'm just saying if you don't get anything out of visuals then you might as well just stop watching anime and start listening to concept albums instead. Cause if you're into a visual medium only because of the sound then you're doing a lot of shit wrong.</br></br>  Color. Don't get me wrong, I like the stories, but maybe I'm too spoiled by Based Western Comic Industry and like my comics to not look like a rough draft before getting sent to the colorist.  <br>Read The Ancient Magus Bride which is a far superior series than most of the series you've listed.</br>  <br><br>But he's got a point, also what's up with the terrible animation in manga? All of it is just still frames, what a shitty medium.</br></br>  <br> Based Western Comic Industry <br><br>How are they based if they can't even write decent stories? Even the art isn't that great.<br><br>Comic books have always been shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not only because of sound, but it's a big part of the experience, i like concept albums too, but rarely anything good comes out of it.<br>It's just that a soundtrack is a topping on the iceberg that is an anime show, hell i would still love Evangelion even if it didn't have good soundtrack, i only noticed on like my third rewatch of that show but it just makes the experience this much better.<br><br> wah he's not like me he must be shitposting <br>k then<br><br>Thanks, it looks pretty good.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All animation is just still frames. You're supposed to draw the in-betweens for manga yourself and then flip it really quick to get the motion.</br>  <br>I use mangastorm on my iphone. It uses online manga readers and it's free.</br>  <br>Digitally colored comics look like ugly plastic shit just like modern anime.</br>  <br>Comic books are more kinda escapist stuff about fantasy world when there are all sorts of manga there, also black and white looks more detailed imo</br>  <br><br>Am I supposed to color the pictures too? What's next? Do I have to do the voice acting too? Fuck that noise.</br></br>  <br>Western comics have the worst fucking colorists. All the B&amp;W comics are infinitely superior.</br>  <br>You're in charge of censorship, too.</br>  <br> Fucking American  <br><br>Do you some of you guys not have the ability to read?</br></br></br>  <br>Don't lump American capeshit with based European comics.</br>  <br> can you pirate physical manga books which is the best way to experience manga? <br><br>The price is free when it comes to piracy. Since pretty much everyone expects all popular manga to have pirated versions, many people simply don't buy anymore and wait for the pirate version to appear. Naturally, to alleviate guilt, many people invent or accept reasons why they pirate media such as "it's not worth paying for" or "I don't like the translation quality but it's still good enough to read if I steal it" or "why pay when a free copy is available online?".<br><br>I think the reading statistics will go up substantially if all the pirate book, magazine, comic, manga, and douinshi were to close down due to being criminalized. Right now, non-profit piracy is essentially a civil court case matter. Do not confuse this with criminal piracy which is the selling of large quantities of duplicated copies into the official distribution chain. The TPP free trade treaty would criminalize the non-profit piracy thus making it a criminal case that even your local police can obtain a search warrant and arrest you for doing. Many things are illegal due to laws, but are not formally criminalized. Criminalization would force a priority issue as well as give incentives to local police to enforce piracy laws because they are allowed to seize (and then auction off) property involved in the piracy. For example, if you sell drugs out of your home, it is possible for the state to seize your property and foreclose it. <br><br>TPP<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>-Pacific_Partnership<br><br>The USA position on TPP includes that ISP's should be held accountable for piracy if current technology can be used to detect it. TPP changes the definition of "commercial" to include any significant quantity even if there was no intent to profit or actual profit obtained.<br><br>TPP Intellectual Property Requirements<br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans<wbr>-Pacific_Partnership_intellectual_p<wbr>roperty_provisions</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not reading Argonautica in fifth grade <br>Granted it was the prose translation.</br></br>  <br>Manga is like $5 or less over here.</br>  It's hard to get and expensive. Reading online to a lot of people is a bother  People have seen anime on tv, they are more familiar with the medium. There is no English translation of Shounen Jump for kids to subscribe to, or any other mainstream outlet for manga. You only read manga if you are already into the whole japanese otaku subculture.<br><br>Of course I'm only talking about America. Apparently in Europe you guys love manga.</br></br>  <br>I'd like to point out that I just put in an Amazon order for the upcoming reprint of something that's been gone for a decade and only really available in English via piracy. I thought it was worth my money and now that I have the opportunity I'm giving it to them.</br>  <br> spending money on the worst Nihei manga  <br><br>You could've bought BLAME or Biomega instead, anon. Why did you do this?</br></br></br>  <br> implying <br/></br>  <br>It's also very slow to update the new chapters</br>  <br>Manga in the west is like $10-$15. Buying 40+ volumes of Naruto is expensive as fuck.<br><br>I don't know how expensive it is in Japan but they grew up buying manga, so I'm pretty sure they won't stop.</br></br></br>  <br>Because reading is unpopular in the west</br>  <br> America =! The west. <br>A thousand times this.<br><br><br>Roughly it goes France &gt; Italy = German (iirc).<br>If you were to pick up a language from the scratch, go for French. The have the most releases, but more than quantity their line-up is very close to the "/a/-approved good manga". Italy has some niche/exclusive stuff (every single jojo volume up to latest jojolion, every Mizukami serie, The Five Star Stories) and their manga are cheaper on average, but the market has been/is suffering (and this would get too long to explain so just trust me on that) and it shows.<br>Keep in mind that as far as Italian/French goes, once you've decently leanerd either of them you can pick up the second one almost for free.<br>Half of the vocabolary are nearly the same across the two languages.<br><br>Both of them are pretty interesting as far as not-manga readings goes too, with the whole Bonelli traditional series and french graphic novels.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I've been wondering about this for awhile.<br>How do kids in Japan just open up a random magazine and get into it despite not knowing anything about any of the series currently on-going.</br>  <br>It can take about half a day, but it comes with the convenience of alerting me to them and automatically downloading them for me. I miss the Magi discussion threads, but I don't think I'm actually missing much.</br>  <br>Maybe they borrow the tanks from their friends?</br>  <br>I think a large part of it is that most Westerners are used to following a TV series regularly (a weekly or monthly basis), but not so much a written release, and there are a lot more people watching TV or browsing video stores once upon a time than there are looking through comic stores or anything, so you just don't get as many people hooked on it.<br><br>Not to mention, with &lt;fifty shows airing at once, anyone who looks at all beyond that first show that caught their attention will find some more stuff they like, even if they just start by looking at what's really popular at the moment, but manga is so much bigger that if you only look at the most popular stuff (especially in the West), you're only going to be reading ten shounen series and maybe Berserk, and none of them will end in the next five years, and you won't branch out much.</br></br></br>  <br><br>wewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww<br><br>u can pirate ebooks retard<br><br>not my fault u cant rly put paper in a vhs, cd or dvd back in the day w/o a gallery thing</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And yet people shit on dubs</br>  <br><br> Sidonia is Nihei's worst manga <br><br>Biomega is, but it's still pretty good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why are you writing like that?</br>  <br>Most magazine raws have a synopsis and who's who at the margins of every chapter</br>  <br>Bookstores are fucking everywhere, any mall, at the street corner, you name it.

This is also apparent when clicking on news articles. They now have a video that reads, word for word, what the article says. People would rather listen to some random news anchor read an article and speech pace, then you just reading the article at an even faster pace.<br><br>Although, bookstores dying out is mostly because of online merchandise, not the decline in reading.

Western comics look like absolute shit with all that color, there's no use of white or dark space and it's just too crowded.</br>  <br><br>Not that guy but some colour manga looks great, the problem with Western comics colouring is that their production values are awful and that includes colour.<br><br>While I agree black and white is more comfortable to read, the reason why it's like this is to sell for cheap.</br></br></br></br>  <br>This.<br> that manga series you wanted to check out <br> the first volume comes out years later in the West </br></br></br>  <br>Most Westerners are illiterate. Sad, but true.</br>  Because reading is for queers and nerds, how many times have you seen someone reading a book while banging a hot chick? That's right, not once.  <br>I grew up reading Tolkien and Zelazny, not the shit you mentioned</br>  <br>Knight in screaming armor was my original Dark Souls</br>  <br> Now, you see a lot of "Too Long Didn't Read" or "Why the Blog Post?" <br><br>I only do that kind of stuff when the person writing really seems up their own ass. Like, there are plenty of bigger posts that are legit and make a point, but there are always a few guys who are just writing because they love hearing themselves.</br></br></br>  <br>here in australia if you want to buy say the saiyan arc of the manga its about 20 bucks and the anime is 50<br><br>its kind of nuts</br></br></br>  <br>this is about dragonball btw*</br>  <br>Manga didn't really appear in stores until like 2005 in my country, and that was mainly Dragonball.<br>Before that we just torrented Naruto on Limewire and Bearshare.</br></br>  <br> implying they aren't playing the anime at x2 speed <br>there's a reason why no one understands whats going on and series threads are always filled with "I didn't get it"</br></br>  <br>Because here in the west people aren't dumb enough to spend their hard earned shekels on anything but fine, refined literature.</br>  <br>A lot of them are £13 here, $13 would be about the same price as the cheapest ones.</br>  <br>I'm sure this book is banned in the Northern Caliphate of Europe.</br>  <br>Honestly that looks like a pretty fun read.</br>  <br> not playing sports and getting your hands in the dirt <br>lmao fucking nerds</br></br>  <br>This sounds like a spaghetti western only instead of black people and lawbreakers it's filthy mudslimes.<br>would read/10</br></br>  <br>Because it's still fairly normal to read manga here in Japan. It can be taken anywhere, a volume only costs about 400 yen, people value it higher because it is the hard work and effort of an artist who spends his every waking moment slaving away at it, etc.<br><br>In America, reading comic books has and still is considered to be 'nerdy'. Manga is probably even worse, in terms of social stigma. Also, the releases are months after Japan, if they ever come out at all. And they're expensive as fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>400 yen for a volume or 400 yen for a magazine?</br>  I prefer anime because it's hard to make out exactly what is happening on some panels in many manga, especially the ones that includes fighting. This is probably an unpopular opininon, but I believe many manga would benefit by being in color.  <br>I would read the shit out of that.</br>  <br>I actually agree with this. There are some manga that are just a clusterfuck to look at. Not all of them mind you, but some are like looking at an inkblot test.</br>  <br>It's not here. Though for some fucking reason shoujo is incredibly popular.</br>  <br>The weekly manga are some of the worst, some hentai doujinshi are even worse because they use one intensity of black for the whole page, makes it even more confusing by adding cumstains and exaggerated speech bubbles all over the place. I would probably enjoy manga more if I had the real thing in my hands, but I am a total add faggot and it's extremely easy to just click on the mouse button if one page isn't interesting enough and I convince myself that said page isn't that important.</br>  <br>Because only a tiny fraction of manga ever gets translated into English. The portion that does is overwhelmingly chuuni: stuff that involves powerlevels, harems and the like. There's also an OK selection of popular seinen stuff. Thus, for those that don't speak any moon, the market is mostly limited to that kind of manga. <br><br>Also, what  said.<br><br><br>Picked the fuck up.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Most manga released for localization is shit, for anything slightly worth reading, you get ten vampire knight clones translated. I've got most of the good series translated into English and it's less than 40. That's really, really bad. And that's including one shot stories like Velveteen &amp; Mandala &amp; Book of Human Insects.<br><br>As for the prices, I'm totally fine with them. I paid like £15 or something per volume of Gundam Origin &amp; it's well worth it. It's a high quality translation with little localization (only where required for ease of reading), and a high quality print with a beautiful hardback cover.<br><br>On that note I should add that we often get shafted too, tons of series have just been left unfinished over the years, with only recent assurances that longer series would definitely be finished no matter what. Dorohedoro sits on my shelf with only a few volumes because they decided it's too expensive to do the colour pages and printed them in greyscale which makes them fucking unreadable. If they treated the consumer better and did some marketing (seriously why does only Vertical &amp; Viz spread the news about their releases? it's not hard to sign up for Twitter, jesus) they could make bank and start releasing more manga. All the publishers just complain that the licensing costs too much but then completely fucking fail to sell the series. There is no reason manga couldn't be as big as comic books are in the West, well were until recently</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I believe many manga would benefit by being in color. <br>I'd love to have all my manga in color. With that said, some authors are much better at conveying action than others.</br></br>  <br>Good artists avoid that problem, the only series I regularly have trouble reading is One Piece but I feel it might be just bad clean-up jobs because all my volumes I have are much easier to pick out, though I only have up to 50<br><br>I hope it's not just an artstyle change because One Piece used to be very clean and easy to read but with plenty of detail. I doubt it though because scanlations are very blobby looking because of an obsession with cleanliness over readability. I've seen plenty of instances of cleaners removing mid tones entirely which makes the whole page just blacks, whites and emphasis lines</br></br></br>  <br><br> Why is manga so unpopular compared to anime in America when it's the inverse that applies in Japan ? <br><br>Fixed it for you OP as this guy said  it's rather doing well here.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the only way to tolerate manga is to read it as it is originally intended: in a magazine that kids can buy for cheap and read casually, and then comment with their friends.<br><br>In the West:<br>- Paying out the ass for each volume.<br>- Uncertain release dates.<br>- Months or years behind Japan.<br>- If using scanlations: shit quality in both image and translation. Series changing hands all the time. Could be dropped or stall at any moment without warning unless it's a very popular one. Have to hunt it down.<br><br>Plus the intrinsic problem with most manga: they are too damned slow. You either read a tiny bit each week for years, or binge an old series all by yourself. Or binge a series that's still unfinished, put it down when you catch up, and by the time there's more to read you no longer care or even remember the details.<br><br>Anime lasts for 3 or 6 months, you watch it, talk about it with thousands of people who are at the same point as you, and then move on to the next. It's infinitely more convenient.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why only half of Planetes and why is it hidden in the corner?</br>   I'm not retarded; I just lack knowledge <br>Basically retarded.</br>  <br><br> People would rather listen to some random news anchor read an article and speech pace, then you just reading the article at an even faster pace. <br><br>Wut? It's way faster to read than just listening someone read something, that's usually the reason i hate when a site i like makes a video review only.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It's not half it's the full release over here and it's not hidden my lower shelf is for completed series I just can't put them upward due to space purpose.</br></br>  Black and white. I guarantee you it's the reason for 90% of people.<br>My best friend loves anime and won't touch manga because of lol no colour.<br>It's such a stupid reason, but there it is.</br></br>  <br>You guys got a 3 part release? Interesting. The English one was 5 part, they split the massive 4th volume into two separate pieces. Dark Horse is doing a reprint though and it's going to be two volumes. From the looks of things they're doing it right, with higher quality pages and other stuff than the Tokyopop one. Going to be my first physical manga purchase.</br>  <br> two volumes <br>I can't understand why you Americans love this omnibus crap for the life of me. Or rather, even tolerate. Shit's atrocious, especially that damn Azumanga omnibus every retard has on their shelves.</br></br>  <br> American <br>Australian. I don't like it but as a reprint of something like Planetes 10 years after the fact I don't mind too much.<br>Also, I'd like to remind you that your release was apparently a compilation as well. Japan's was 4 volumes.</br></br></br>  <br>Omnibus are ok only if they come with proper packaging. Big, well buil hardcover releases work (but get costly), the problem is when you have a regular volume, just 4 times thick, which get hard to handle, read and it's much more fragile.<br><br>I had to skip on the Shamo reprint i was interested in when i saw how retarded was the format.</br></br></br>  Manga market went bust years ago but is starting to boom again. Barnes and Noble just doubled their graphic novel section which includes manga and had a huge buy 2 get 1 free sale last week. Thankfully we have publishers like Seven Seas now that keep in touch with the community and bring over niche series people actually want.  <br><br>Yeah they squeezed extra chapter on every volume probably due to cost value and Panini manga is a shit tier cie here in France they have some good license but they do really stupid shit with them.<br><br>Shitty paper most of the time, the ink stick to your hand when you read it etc,etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, I'm no American either. I just don't understand why people are not bothered by it, it's not the proper (read as best suitable) format for this media. Even regular books are shit this way.<br> inb4 bunko in Japan and shit <br>These are mostly for travel and such, and that's why they're of smaller size and cheaper paper. Or if you want to just spend less. The thing is that people over there can choose, you (people in US, for most) only get this stuffed abomination.<br><br> Shamo reprint <br>So those were 4 volumes per book? Man, that's crazy. Usually in Japan they go as far as 2, I think. 3 on some occasions.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 vol of the old edition per release.<br>The thing is that they didn't even bother to change the format or improve the packaging so it's disproportionately thick and stupid to even look at.</br></br>  <br>It's been a while since I read Planetes, but I'm pretty damn sure that the volume breaks were incredibly deliberately placed and used to punctuate the story. On the topic of releases in France, didn't you guys almost get all of Patlabor?<br><br>It makes sense why they do it. To most English-language distributors, a manga is generally treated as a single entity that is purchased, often at the end of its run. From the perspective of the companies they have no reason to emulate the original release format.<br>Not saying I like it, mind you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> From the perspective of the companies they have no reason to emulate the original release format. <br>I'm pretty sure the publishing contracts are quite strict about that actually.</br></br>  <br>Well, at least covers are nice.<br><br>From selling point, yes, that's understandable. But man, reading such editions is a pain in the ass. And the creaking is annoying (if it's a hardcover, I'm afraid to even imagine how the spine looks like in non-hardcover ones).</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yeah we got the 3 movie released in BD and the TV serie on DVD, I remember watching the Sunrise one while I was younger on my TV in french.</br></br>   America=all the West  <br>in Italy and France manga have way higher sales than anime bruh, rest of eu is similar</br>  <br>We're in the middle of getting everything on BD here, shame about the awful English subs for TV (specifically for TV funnily enough, OVA2's are 10/10). I was more meaning the manga, though.</br>  <br>Props to Ivrea Finland for releasing stuff in exactly the original format, dust covers and all. Even if the series they pick up aren't that interesting most of the time.</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Man... this anon surely loves cocks.</br>  <br>its different growing up reading jump and having to spent 10+ euro to a comic book you might not even like</br>  <br>In my country is expensive as fuck... damn.</br>  <br>Did you spent all your money on BDs and mango and now don't have any left for ammo?</br>  <br><br>Oh yeah my bad I saw that we got some released here but it's a old cie and I didn't know much about the industry back in the days since I didn't have any money to buy them.</br></br>  <br>I'm prepared.</br>  <br>Is that some real fuckin' NATO?</br>  <br>Yes, I definitely can see EoE used as deadly weapon.</br>  any good site to download english scanned mangas?<br><br>I miss senfgurke2 so much these days...</br></br>  <br> mangas <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  <br>you sound mad.</br>  <br>Yes.

I loved reading as a kid and I still love it. It's just fucking hard finding time when you work full time.</br>  Because you can follow anime on a weekly basis and discuss it here.<br>The only weekly manga are shounen.</br>  <br> The only weekly manga are shounen <br>Stay retarded, anon.</br></br>  <br>Because books<br>Also because money vs cable syndication<br>You'll spend more buying books for one series than you will watching a marathon of it or buying dvds even.<br>Also videos tend to be more popular in the west anyway-See marvel's extremely shitty sales in comparison to japanese LNs vs their superhero movies</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are others but they are rare.

In terms of working on the future the situation loook bleak at best to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> fun control laws <br>Don't know if intentional, but nice.</br></br>  The West has good comic books but cartoons here are shit.   reading <br>Its just a harder medium to get into. Even comics are barely read in the west anymore unless you are some turbo nerd.<br>In Nippon, its a lot easier to just buy a manga or a magazine and read it wherever than to wait late at night for your favorite seasonal anime to air.<br>I really should read more manga though.</br></br></br>  <br>This is actually one of the main reasons books aren't too popular in America. Adults work all day and rarely have the time to finish books, even a short book can take 10-20 hours to complete. Retired people and students are more likely to read.<br>In Japan, public transportation and commuting in general are more common, mostly because their train system is actually good. On a long commute when you aren't driving, people have much more time to read. Manga is also just Japan's main source of entertainment; in America film and TV are.</br></br>  Miss us yet?  <br>Only Gon and Pika.</br>  Everyday.  <br><br>removed the slut</br></br>  <br>My life is so empty right now<br>Hunter x Hunter was the only thing that kept me going</br></br>  <br>Replace Killua with Leorio or Ging and i might agree.<br><br> frogshit <br>Fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Nope got a better hunting series to read.</br>  <br>meh</br>   Control+F <br> No yuru yuri thread <br>Yuru Yuri thread<br> Son Akari edition </br></br></br>  <br>Would you befriend Chitose?

You can't take "super special snowflake anime kids!" and try to set them against a backdrop of cooperate research and business. I work in a highly funded lab, and these kids are assholes. You can't just rip through money and break shit them turn around and act surprised when your funding gets cut. And that shit with 30 requisitions just under the 20 million yen limit? That's not how it fucking works. By the time the third order went in they would have been flagged. That's literally 101 level stuff. Then the entire union thing. "They're using our position to benefit themselves while helping us! How evil! It's just like we were warned about 5 minutes ago!" Followed by the comically overdone "You're our enemy now because of a promotion that was forced on you!" scene.<br><br>As if the research, political and business aspects (which are supposed to be the hook that make the show stand out) aren't bad enough, the character interactions and motivations are worse. We have the clear cut underdogs who draw no sympathy, the clearly evil big CEO, the clearly good but pretending to be evil shrewd up and coming business man, the obligatory horny Christmas cake, and then the deserters who were won over by the underdogs hard work and determination in one fucking episode. <br><br>The show pretends to deal with adult issues and tries to set itself apart from most series, but the author is too much of an idiot to write corporate drama or decent characters. I want to say I'm shocked that anyone could like his writing, but there are idiots her who think Saekano was some clever and well written gem.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  You guys told me there was no anal in her S route.

An extremely generic show that threw in some religious symbolism for the sake of having symbolism. None of it actually means anything. The only reason it went down the psychological conflict path is because they ran out of animation budget. And "deconstruction" is just a 20 year-old meme.<br>EoE was great, but there's no reason why it should retroactively make a 6/10 show into a 10/10 one.</br>  <br> Extremely unlikable characters <br> melodramatic sappy writing <br> at least with FMA it's excusable since women are too dumb and emotional to not write emotionally <br> obnoxious action scenes that either last for too long or are too short and have no tension <br> settings that are pretty much wasted potential. <br>Anon, you should try reading the things you shitpost about.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't get it were they really trying to kill each other here? All these bullets going all over and they can dodge point blank and not one hits.<br><br>Then you have mami being a string clone and looking worried during the fight for some reason. Plus she doesn't shoot homu towards the end when they are immobile and the bullets are flying with both of them aiming at each other. Yet she peppered homu with shots mid air that she also somehow dodged.</br></br>  <br>I'm sure she doesn't sent the others unless it's necessary.<br><br>The fact is Madoka is a god; she can travel in time and possibilities; the other magical girls are dead and Madoka can take them with her; these girl like Sayaka and cheese girl can operate without needing Madoka's constant watching; Madoka can bring them to the real world like she did at the end of the movie; demon Homura could make them alive again--be it accidentally. <br><br>Madoka could have her own undead magical girl army if she wanted to.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Madoka can bring them to the real world like she did at the end of the movie <br>They were Madoka's escorts or something. In the soul gem they could act by themselves, in the real world they were reduced to Madoka's followers.<br><br>The entire drama with Nagisa and (most of all) Sayaka being gone from the living world becomes silly if they could just ask Madoka to go back there and talk with the megucas, their families or something. Plus what would they have to accomplish on Earth anyway? Slaying wraiths is the role of the MGs who need them for grief cubes anyway.<br><br>And if Madoka could just go back there to talk with Homura or something, this entire movie wouldn't happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I don't get it were they really trying to kill each other here? <br>No. It clearly showed both of them holding back because they don't actually want to kill each other.</br></br>  <br><br>Does mami consider homu a close friend or is madoka the only one she cares for</br></br>  <br>The whole thing can be written off as some kind of AU perfect world dream  because it's basically fan service. Madoka is some kind of idol girl, Mami is the overpowered mom with a baby(bebe), Sayaka is in control and knows everything, Kyouko is a happy schoolgirl, and Homura is conveniently oblivious and needs to be saved. It's sort of a reflection of what fans wanted to see, or at least what SHAFT thought fans wanted to see. Many thought the opening super happy stuff was sort of creepy, but the director(a huge Sayaka fan) said that was completely unintentional. <br><br>I'm not even sure the Homura vs Mami fight was in the original script. It just happened because SHAFT thought it would be cool.</br></br></br>  I've always been a huge fan of re imaginings in fan-art.
