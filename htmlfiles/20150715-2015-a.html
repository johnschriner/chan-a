[ How can we save best boy in Dragon Ball?  You can't. Get over it. Gohan died during the Cell Saga.  Unlock his hidden potential  kill off videl  Burn all books.  Burn all the books  Find Dragonballs<br><br>Erase everything post-Cell saga<br><br>Rewrite Buu saga with Gohan as main character.<br><br>Alternatively just leave the Buu saga the way it was, except Ultimate Gohan wins.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Remove Toriyama  <br>Go back to the past and kill Chichi while he is still young.</br>  I want more Great Saiyaman.  <br> leave the Buu saga the way it was, except Ultimate Gohan wins. <br>This</br></br>  <br>but come on, we haven't seen him do anything. Heck we haven't even seen him do something even close to "Scholarly" his entire character is based around this fact and we've never seen it. <br><br>his entire "Scholar persona" is heavily implied and never shown.</br></br></br>  Fighter Gohan helped defend the Earth , what has scholar Gohan done? Absolutely nothing, that's what.  <br>This<br><br>if DBZ was just Great Saiyaman shit I would be happy</br></br></br>  Keep him at the age of 11 SSJ2 in his prime, forever.    Why cant you just let him be happy reading books and fucking his QT wife? He has never wanted to fight and he's still one of the strongest people in the universe even when he is doing nothing. Now his is married to a rich as fuck hottie and is the nerd his mother had always brain washed him to be, leave Gohan alone.  <br>Gah, a skeleton!</br>  <br>you spooked me!</br>  <br>Maybe he will find the cure of cancer very soon.</br>  <br> hey dragon can you give me the cure for cancer, thanks </br>  <br>why not? that's when he was best and its not like doing that would hurt his popularity any. Its already pretty low. <br><br> In a show about fighting monsters <br> he should just read books <br>at this point, I think completely removing him would be better. they're just going to keep him in and be the punching bag till goku comes to save the day.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More great Saiyaman</br>  <br>He knows about aliens, magic, space travel, alternate dimensions, super advanced technology , holy shit Gohan write a book or least try and study those things regular earthlings don't know about.</br>  <br>very clever skelly, trying to make me believe bulshit</br>  <br><br><br>As much as I agree that Gohan should have been the hero in the end, the final Genki Dama was the perfect way to end the series: with every character Goku had met since his journey began coming together and finally paying him back for everything he's done for them, and defending their universe together. <br><br>I don't know if I would trade that moment for it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>just having Gohan not job would have been better. heck switch out Vegeta for Gohan in that final fight and it would have been perfect.</br>  <br>Videl needs saving just as much as Gohan. They need to go on a couples' intensive training retreat.</br>  <br><br>Vegeta needed to be there for his internal monologue where he finally accepted that Goku was better than him .</br></br>  <br>I want to lick tails Videl</br>  have you guys been taken your daily dosage  <br> save </br>   save <br>give him a reason to fight. He likes to play super hero. Make him a galactic patrol man with Jaco.</br>  <br>i thought he was a lawyer</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Well, in DBO he eventually wrote a "How do I into Ki for dummy humies" book, so humans weren't the most laughably weak self-aware species in the universe anymore.</br>  Kill him. He's beyond saving.  <br>Gohan didn't job, he just got overconfident in his new powers and underestimated how smart Super Buu was. You'd think that after hearing how bad Vegeta fucked up with Cell that he would not make the same mistakes as the Saiyan Prince.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, doc.</br></br>   morons replied to the post that's right below the shitpost that was made by a moron who uploaded an objectively shitty image that makes morons pretend that they're talking to a skeleton because they think they're funny and because they want to fit in <br>What a surprise.</br>  <br>why is this gif so fantastic</br>  <br>If he needs to be saved it means he is not best boy in the first place.</br>  yeah, Gohan should have been the path to a bigger DB universe, not Goku, i.e. an expansion into a sci fi story (which seemed to be where things were going and then for some reason we went right back to magic and fantasy in the Buu saga)<br>what we got was an expansion of the afterlife in the DB universe because our central character was Goku, and Goku dies (a lot, for a hero)<br><br>what we should have gotten was Gohan, being the friendly and inquisitive genius that he is, going out and continuing relations with the people of namek and eventually other worlds as a sort of new paragon (taking over after Goku)<br>it's really tragic that in the canon Goku takes Uub to be his apprentice and not his own goddamn son, because Gohan was already being set up as the most powerful character, and he needed the extra edge of his intelligence to take it that next step further than Goku<br>having Gohan start a sort antithesis to Frieza's empire as a galactic police force would have been waaaaaaay more interesting than the shitty goodbye ending we got (and now... DB super?.... fuck this shit is terrible)<br>we could instead, RIGHT NOW, be watching Gohan and the Z Force fighting galactic level threats and using what his dad taught him (and/or piccolo) to pass on his knowledge and lead the galaxy to.... more.... awesomeness? yeah.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Namek*</br>  gohanfags are just as bad as brolyfags  2 late rip in peace guhin  <br>You know this is a kids manga made by a gag writer, right?</br>  <br>Thanks doc.</br>  <br>This is pathetic, let him live his tranquil life studying and living with his family. Adventure is not his stuff, he trained only because it was necessary to survive and never liked it. Can't you just accept this?</br>  <br>look anon, I'm not the one who wrote all this shit and made it this elaborate with this many characters<br><br>and fuck you because it only started as a kids manga, DBZ was clearly more serious<br>there's blood, character death (err, minus dragon balls), people growing older, having kids, etc.<br>it's more than just a kid's manga<br><br>and the whole 'he's a gag writer' has nothing to do with him writing a good story<br>he's clearly capable of it...</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Pan dies and he and Videl grow distant. He becomes heavily depressed. Then, Piccolo dies. As he dies, he says something that inspires Gohan and snaps him out of his funk.<br><br>He becomes the hero he was meant to be once again. Perhaps later he reconciles with Videl.</br></br>  <br>I think you might need to up the dosage, doc.</br>  <br>Kill off his mother sometime before Cell.</br>  <br>no, also Videl and Gohan's sub plot should have been a serious love story (one of the things DB left completely untouched), then she should have died in childbirth to give birth to pan</br>  <br>Pan would then be Gohan's reason to fight<br><br>and fight he would</br></br></br>  <br><br>The lines may seem blurred to you due to the cultural differences, but Dragonball, including Z, is a kids manga. <br><br>Hell, Dragonball classic was probably more mature than Z with all the perverted humor in addition to violence, but ultimately its not a story for mature audiences by any means.</br></br></br></br>  Okay...Who's the best group besides DragonTeam that's subbing DBS? I really hate DragonTeam's subs.  Don't bring Goku back from the dead 50 times.  <br>well if being an adult means you cant enjoy DBZ (or Dragon Ball for that matter), then you're doing it wrong</br>  <br>This, fucking this.</br>  <br><br>No one ever said that. Just that what  said isn't the kind of series this is. Dragonball isn't the the kind of mature series you want it to be, and it never was and never will be. <br><br>It's a goofy, fun, often corny story about a goofy country bumpkin kid with an eating disorder who loves to fight and is constantly seeking stronger opponents to test his skills against wherever they may be. It's not a space opera.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wait, this is a shonen and not an HBO drama? what</br>  <br><br><br>what the fuck is this shit</br></br></br>  <br>it's like you read every other page but somehow skipped all the serious stuff<br><br>go back and read DBZ again, it's a lot more serious than you remember</br></br></br>  <br>I'm 308, don't lump me in with those retards</br>  <br><br>The Universe where that happens is Fusion Reborn.</br></br>  <br><br>No, it's really not. <br><br>The darkest arc is Cell, and that's because Toriyama's editor was telling him how to write it. Dragonball isn't supposed to be serious. Where Super is right now is much more how the series is supposed to be than that.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Buu kills every person on earth <br> idiots shoot and kill Buu's dog <br> Buu is the first character to be a galactic threat <br> we meet King Kai's bosses <br> Gohan is an adult and starts a relationship with Videl <br> Goku has another son <br>should I keep going?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>He's a pink gumball who kills people by turning them into candy and eating them. That's hilarious and adorable. <br><br>No one stays dead for more than a day and nothing on your list beyond that implies mature content at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You think were gonna believe anything a skeleton says? go back to spooking up /x/</br>  <br>Buu doesn't kill everyone on the planet that way, he blasts/blows them up<br><br>also, that was just the Buu saga<br>don't even try<br>beyond this you're trolling</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Frieza was pretty dark too. Hell, Buu arc gets progressively more serious as the transformations go on.</br>  <br>Head to Trunks future and revive Future gohan</br>  <br>Here you go.</br>  <br>Would the main timeline Dragonballs be able work in the alternate timeline?</br>  <br>Besides Uub and perhaps Goku after more training, Awakened Gohan is still the strongest non fusion in the series.</br>  Bring back Android 16 somehow and have him whip Gohan's ass into shape.  <br><br>Do we have to dive deeper? Because we can totally dive deeper. <br><br>Like many people, you seem to have a false perception of what Dragonball is supposed to be, most likely from the English dub of the anime that did in fact make much of the story and atmosphere darker to appeal to American audiences. <br><br>But Dragonball is not at all a dark series.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I really hate how everyone looks exactly the same with ss3</br></br>  <br> implying comic relief stops a series' ability to be serious. </br>  <br>stop being a faggot anon</br>  <br>No need for that. Just let him do what he wants.</br>  <br>4 kids!</br>  <br>Son wukon is such a cute little guy</br>  <br> Best Boy <br> Not Goku </br></br>  <br> Drank Ultra Divine Water to unleash hidden potential and basically gets to use his Oozaru powers without going Oozaru <br> Kaioken basically gives him power he doesn't have <br> Spirit Bomb borrows energy from other people <br> Super Saiyan is free energy for him to use </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It would have been too easy with Gohan there. No need for Genkidama.</br></br>  <br> Drank Ultra Divine Water to unleash hidden potential <br>Did you pay any attention. The water wasn't anything special. It was his training from Karin.</br></br>  <br>Not the second time (right before Piccolo fight)</br>  <br>Wrong, that was just the first time. When he fights king piccolo he drinks it and goes from getting destroyed by old piccolo to kicking his ass.<br><br> It brings him to the brink of death </br></br></br>  <br>However that was probably just Zenkai power all along.</br>  <br>But Korin doesn't know that<br>Why would he have him drink pure poison<br>In fact why doesn't he tell anyone about Senzu beans until after everyone died</br></br></br>  Can someone explain the origin of gohanfags for me? <br>Is it an american thing? <br>Based on the people I know in my country Gohan is probably the least liked of the super sayans. <br>Not trolling, just a genuine concern.</br></br></br>  <br>Lots of promises with no payoff, DBZ kicks off with the notion that Gohan will one day be the strongest.<br><br>Then he gets his ass beaten by people out of his league for 6 years before getting strong ONCE and immediately fucking it up.<br><br>People wanted to see the underdog win for once.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Because he was the strongest at the end of Dragon Ball Z and many people seems to have forgotten (including the author). He was stronger than Gotenks and Super Buu, making him way above Goku's level.<br><br>It's a waste.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks for the answer. <br>I can absolutely agree with all you wrote, I get the reasons for his popularity, but what I don't get is the numbers. <br>Is the Gohan fanbase large (in Japan or the west) or are fans just vocal about him here on /a/?</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not that people only like gohan, it's more than everyone liked him as well as a few others. Good luck finding someone who doesn't love TenShinHan.</br>  <br>OK, thanks again. <br>I guess he's just more popular among real fans than the people I know (in my experience he doesn't get almost any attention)</br></br>  Chichi should have been killed<br>some suffering would make best boy the badass he was meant to be<br> yes even more badass than his future self </br></br>  <br> Can't beat the only two enemies he ever had to fight despite being given decades <br> Badass </br></br>  <br><br>that shit was cringle as fuck</br></br>  <br>not a gohanfag, but yeah basically what that other anon said  , it's wasted potential and it's like the author just bailed on him as a character<br><br><br>and it's not that I don't like Tenshinhan, it's just that just like Gohan he seems to be a semi-forgotten character<br> in this case it's Toriyama's fault for not giving him something to stay in the game <br> then again he seems to do this a lot, but somewhat haphazardly <br> Roshi still makes himself useful because he's wise and immortal so he'll only get wiser, Krillin is smart enough to know his destructo disks are deadly, and piccolo manages to keep up fairly well with the higher tiers <br> but then we have Oolong and Puar who, while still useful shapeshifters, are never used; Bulma who is a magic level genius but for some reason never sets her mind to studying ki for the sake of... shit, everyone! (on a similar note, her father Dr. Briefs); and also Dende who really should hear more about but never do </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>edit:<br> Dende who we* really should hear more about </br></br>  <br> internal monologue where he finally accepted that Goku was better than him <br>that already happened when goku ssj3 was fighting kid buu</br></br>  <br>Are you that guy who wanted Super's Universe 6 arc starring Fuhrer Gohan?<br>Because this bullshit feels the same.</br></br>  <br>I cant speak for everyone but the reason why I always like gohan was because I could relate to him more than anyone else. I grew up watching dbz and gohan was the kid with the great potential and only needed a little more age and training to be the absolute best. <br>But after cell saga he was kind of just kicked off to the side so goku could be given the lime light once again and im still pissed about it. <br>Fuck Saiyaman, gohan deserved more than that</br></br></br>  <br>no, and I pretty much never post on /a/<br><br>but I do post on /tg/ sometimes, occationally /co/, and rarely /tv/</br></br></br>  <br>also, I think you missed "antithesis to Frieza's empire", and you might have also read the word "further" and "fuhrer"</br>  <br>"further" as* "fuhrer"<br>[not 'and']</br></br>  <br>Give him glasses.</br>  <br>oh man if TFS does a version of this they better put that joke in</br>  <br>oh god i dont even want to watch this movie when i see these pics</br>  <br>Am I suppose to view this from bottom to top?<br><br>Also, <br>ep 1 ratings - ７．９％<br>ep 2 - ５．６％</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>the animation is pretty jarring<br><br>wish they'd go back to however they used to do things<br>pre-digital maybe?</br></br></br></br>  when are we going to get revival of f torrent?  <br>It's hilarious when they keep having these flashbacks in cel animation</br>  <br>just watch the spanish version on youtube and put some metal on in the background for sound</br>  <br>did frieza get resurrected stronger?<br><br>or did they forget how weak he's supposed to be now?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=5yN<wbr>lPL9unj0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>sorry but dialog in dbz is quite intelligent, i dont want to skip on that, metal in background sounds good tho</br>  <br>The reason Dragon Ball is so good is because Toriyama knows better than to do things he sucks at.</br>  <br>I tried watching Dragon Ball Supers but it's more of this shit<br><br>in my head the universe is only the two manga series<br>everything else I speculate on because Toriyama is apparently incapable of continuing the series with any sort of honorable effort</br></br></br></br>  <br>4 MONTHS</br>  <br>he trains for four months before the battle and in that time apparently unlocks his new form and boosts his base forms</br>  <br>lel i just realized that frieeza is stronger than cell and majin buu, wtf happened</br>  <br>The Buu Saga was silly but it was also dark as shit. It's just the characters didn't really dwell on it.</br>  <br>He stopped being lazy and started to lift.</br>  <br>and what did he lift? 100 kg? 200kg?</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is the most gruesome death in the entire series. It's the most gruesome human death at least.</br>  <br> Can someone explain the origin of gohanfags for me? <br><br>There's Gohan fans (ie; the people who like Gohan for Gohan, which includes his own personal goal of being a scholar and raising a family after a less than stable childhood. These people understand that Gohan, as a character, always loved and respected his father for being a kind person who protected the weak, to the point he idolizes him and Piccolo, growing up and wants to be a 'heroic' like them, which, in turn is where The Great Saiyaman persona comes from). <br><br>And then there's 'Gohanfags' (ie; the fuckers with serious father issues, which they shamelessly project onto Goku's and Gohan's relationship, while constantly bitching about how either of Gohan's parents ruined him, by forcing him to study, whereas, in their headcanon, Gohan is really this unchained badass fighting God that Toriyama abandoned in favor of Goku. These are the people that still perpetuate that retarded "Piccolo is Gohan's real father!" meme and legit believe that Gohan is secretly filled with angst and disdain for his father. In this thread, you'll likely see the latter of these two facets of Gohan's 'fans', especially if there's a hefty amount of bitching about Goku stealing Gohan's spotlight and how Akira Toriyama was forced, by his mean ol' editors, to ditch Gohan, despite Toriyama flat out stating the opposite). Very rarely you'll find reasonable Gohanfags, because they're blinded by nostalgia/their headcanon to be reasoned with.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember that time when the comic relief villain broke a 5-year-old's neck?</br>  <br>NO COMMENT</br>  <br>memes</br>  <br>People being angry kids when Gohan went full edgemode against Cell.<br><br>Basically Kirito like self inserting.</br></br></br>  <br>when it aired on toonami a lot of the fans were around the same age as teen gohan so I guess it's because he was the most relatable and it was cool that he was so strong even though he was young. Like a role model for kids.</br>  <br> best boy </br>  <br><br>I think it's the same as Hitsugaya for Bleach.</br></br>  <br>gohanfags are the worst</br>  <br>Either<br><br>1. Someone dies (Chichi maybe), gives him the motivation to shape up. Becomes a more intelligent Goku.<br>2. Gohan starts teaching everyone how to unlock their latent potential. Humans no longer the most pathetic species.<br><br>While we're at it, give Piccolo a power boost. It's a bit overdue.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Gohan was a teenager, a school boy, has a very nice tsundere girlfriend, was cool and the strongest of the manga.<br><br>Is it so hard to see why he's popular?<br>I even like the fact that after killing Cell he skipped training to do stuff. He's a normal person, not a crazy Saiyan. But still he ended up being the stronger. <br><br>I don't understand why Vegeta is popular.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have him meet the Old Kai again, who mentions how he's been slacking off and how he needs to go through that whole ceremony to unlock his powers again. <br><br> Then have Gohan turn him down. </br></br></br>  <br>Best love story in the entire world. And the author didn't even show most of it.</br>  <br> I don't understand why Vegeta is popular <br>You need to stop going after self inserts for that.</br></br>  <br>Then have Gohan train like a pissed of Vegeta because he doesn't want to do that shit again.</br>  <br> Best love story in the entire world </br>  <br>I would like a season where the db guys just do mundane shit, those gohan high school episodes were the best part of the buu saga</br>  <br>He's a midget who's never been able to defeat a villain. He also was a villain, he's not smart or funny. <br><br>Tsundere? Stoccolma sindrome? Just why?<br>He's not likable at all. I heard girls like him.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He's a midget who's never been able to defeat a villain. He also was a villain, he's not smart or funny <br>As I said, you need to stop going after self inserts.</br></br>  <br>I actually agree. This was gold.</br>  <br> I don't understand why Vegeta is popular. <br><br>Edgelords and women. That's the entirety of Vegeta's fanbase, post Namek. From the Saiyan arc through Namek, Vegeta was a good character, in that he was as ruthless as he was cunning. <br><br>Once he gets back to Earth, the character goes full retarded with "Muh Pride" faggotry. Anyone who watched watches the series, prior to Z would find his character a piss-poor retread of Tenshinhan and Piccolo Jr., only without the aspect where he puts his bullshit aside in lieu of a bigger problem, like those characters did.<br><br>However 'DBZ kids' that saw the DBZ before Dragon Ball, love Veggie to pieces, especially girls, because he's a hardass shitter that's easy the self-insert to, especially since he's main rival is a guy who's too forgiving for his own good. Edgelords and girls love those kind of characters.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not. Yet you didn't manage to give me a single reason why I should like him as a character. Because of development? There was already Piccolo for that, and that was even better.</br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br> Yet you didn't manage to give me a single reason why I should like him as a character <br>Going from your list, valid reasons should match what a self insert character is.</br></br>  <br><br>Seriously Vegeta is a pain to endure. I feel embarassed everytime he's around. <br>It's like whan Goku had to hide SSJ3 because he's get sad if he knew. I'm not sure if I made it clear.</br></br></br>  <br> From the Saiyan arc through Namek, Vegeta was a good character, in that he was as ruthless as he was cunning.  <br>  <br> Once he gets back to Earth, the character goes full retarded with "Muh Pride" faggotry.

The fact that he's become the second most important character pisses me off a lot. He was the weakest adult Saiyan in Z, yet he got SSj4 in GT and SSJGSS in FnF, just because of fans.<br><br>Even Toriyama hates him, but he's forced to give him screntime because he's loved by girls and edgelords.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Gohan went yamcha after Cell arc  <br> I don't understand why Vegeta is popular. <br>because his pure blooded saiyan prince and not a faggy gohan</br></br>  <br>Gohan went to shit after Namek, got better when Saiyaman, then turned irrelevant.</br>  <br> saiyan prince <br>That wasn't canon until Toriyama made it with a movie it's going to be rewritten.<br>We can say it's true in the anime universe. That wasn't said once in the manga.<br><br>Also, lol, prince. And about pure blood, there is Goku.<br><br>Also <br> Implying half Saiyan and half Earthling is not the superior breed </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The main appeal of Vegeta is the conflict between good and evil and what came out of it. Also his drive to stay relevant.

So what if he did the spotlight from some characters in this arc. It isn't really that big of a deal.  <br>Sabo looks like he's ready to kill them all<br><br>Crazy Adorable Motherfucker</br></br></br>  Who is healing Luffy Law, Kyros, and Bellamy?  <br> no chapter next week <br>damn. hurts every time.</br></br>  <br> Bellamy as Usopp ammunition <br>Pls Oda</br></br>  <br>nobody was hating on him just now?</br>    <br>It's time for Oda's monthly sex with his ugly wife</br>  <br>Doesn't look like the usual first page spoiler, but then again we're a day early.</br>  <br>Only speedfags and Marineford babies hate Sabo.</br>  Why does this fucker say dasuyan all the time? It's fucking annoying.  <br>I think he mean people mad the whole chapter is his.<br>I'm kinda bummed redone get to see what Fuji does, what Burgess does, etc, too.<br>But I think a full Sabo chap can reveal more about dragon and such so its overall good</br></br></br>  <br>Huh I guess I stand totally corrected on that.<br>Good question then</br></br>  <br>HE'S THE WORST MEMBER<br>OF THE DOFFY CREW</br></br>  <br>Are Bellamy's teeth still fucked up?</br>  <br>It's a fake accent.</br>  <br>I mean, I think people were expecting a Sabo/Rev chapter sometime during the post-arc stuff so not sure why they'd be mad. I didnt really see any angry reactions either.</br>  <br>You can see in the spoiler he is missing at least one</br>  <br>Go onnnnnnn</br>  <br>Can anyone translate the glyphs?</br>  <br>Well fuck. I mean I know the flashback is more for the reader than the characters but is nobody going to listen to Sabo's story?</br>  <br><br><br>poor bastard is probably gonna have a lisp from now on</br></br></br>    <br>I don't know if I still want to fug him if it's going to stay that way.</br>  <br>aparently Franky, Zoro, and Robin are.</br>  <br> Zoro completely unscathed <br><br>he's gonna have a hell of a fight in Zou</br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's night time already. It sure has been a crazy day in dressrosa. And we still had no idea what happened to sanji and the rest.</br>  <br> Franky's face so fucked he can't hear too well <br> Zoro doesn't give a shit <br> Robin already knows all this <br><br>lol Sabo is fucked</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>aww it's like they're having a sleepover.</br>  <br> think <br>Luffy would not care and Usopp would say the very same thing marine fodders were repeating about how crazy infamous Luffy's brothers are, it's ok if only Zoro, Robin and Franky hear what Sabo has to say.</br></br>  <br> bartobell <br><br>is there more of this?</br></br></br>  <br> Luffy would not care <br>when it comes to sabo? i think he would</br></br>  <br>maybe at the end of the chapter we will get luffy trying to call sanji on den den and it not working?</br>  <br>All I can tell is Franky says, "Slamma jamma my nigga. Yo all done look all fucked up...."<br>Then Ace proceeds to say, "Bitch ass white man dun got me real good like 3 arcs ago. Fuckin white fish bowel head nigga taught me once fo being all whitey and shit. I aint dun gon goofed once when this big ass nigga with tats all up on his face fished me outta sea and gave me some nice lessons on getting that ass all nice a fresh and..."<br>Thats it on that page.</br></br></br>  <br>Why wouldn't Luffy care? His brother happens to be alive and he's going to talk about why he wasn't there for Ace and how he heard about it.<br><br>Luffy would probably be interested in that.</br></br></br>  <br>No way is Fujitora messing with that home squad. He may have left the island already.</br>  <br>Not much.</br>  <br>Nope, Zoro will roller coaster all of his fights until Kaidou swordman, and even then I don't really see Zoro being as injured as Luffy ever again, Oda ruined te character for me.</br>  <br>Dude you should talk to mangastream about being a translator.</br>  <br>get out</br>    <br>ill take what i can get<br><br>much appreciated, anon</br></br></br>  <br>A character is ruined for you because he got stronger? what the fuck</br>  <br>I'll put in my application right now.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128099895 <br>well then good luck with that</br>  <br>so Mansherry does not heal them huh?</br>  <br>People in different areas of Japan say different words at the end of their sentences as part of a regional accent. Like how Canadians stereotypically say "eh?" all the time. Oda takes opposite sentence endings from different areas of the country, combines them, and makes interesting fake accents. <br><br>Dasuyan is a combination of Osaka's "-desu", which you use when stating something factually, and Kansai's "-yan", which you use when asking a question. <br><br>Neptune's Jamon, Jora's Zamasu, and Bastille's Dara are like this too.</br></br></br></br></br>  Bellamy was the most rage-inducing character back in Jaya, and now he has his own little fanbase. Who would've thought.<br><br>All the more reason why Caesar can and will be next strawhat.</br></br>  <br>Kinemon will wreck Zoro when they duel, Zoro will only win from plot armor.</br>  <br>No problem. Not related but I like the image.</br>  <br>Kinemon isn't that strong.</br>  <br>what's the point? So they get healed and then return to their hurt state? Might as well just sleep it off.</br>  <br> Bellamy invited to the sleepover but not Barto.  <br>Why.</br></br>  <br>I liked him back in Jaya because he was a douchebag.</br>  <br>nice Terminator reference Oda</br>  <br>How do you know? Kinemon didn't do shit.<br><br>His Dofly disguise was great 10/10 though.</br></br></br>  <br>Storywise an omnipotent character is boring, this is why Usopp was a 10/10 in this arc. When was the last time Zoro was in bandages after fighting another first mate/second in command? Daz Bones?</br>  <br>Ok thanks for this and for the 1:1 translation of the spoiler you provided here:<br><br>We'd be stuck waiting without you anon.</br></br></br>  <br>only her dandelion thingy heals temporary, her watering can heals permanently</br>  <br>What does jamon mean?</br>  <br>Kin'emon is fucking Brook-tier<br><br>he wont be able to touch Zoro. The mystery samurai that he and Kanjuro were travelling with might be stupid strong though</br></br></br>  <br>How are you so sure he's not underneath the bed holding Luffy's hand</br>  <br><br>Check em</br></br>  <br>it's ham in spanish.</br>  <br>who's on the bed with Luffy and Sabo? Usopp?</br>  <br>Robin pls keep this haircut</br>  <br> Kinemon isn't strong because he's goofy and humble <br>Yea you are a retard. He has not redacted his duel proposal even though it harms his country if he loses, since he should seek out the strongest want swordsman to get their legendary blade back from zoro the thief.<br><br>It's more logical to conclude that he IS the strongest swordsman in Wano, and protecting the royal blood heir Momonosuke.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Combination of Akita's "-jya" (old man speak) and Kansai's "-damon" (childish speak).</br>  <br>Hmmmm<br><br>I feel like we're forgetting something...<br><br>Like there use to be other members of the Straw Hats....<br><br>Nah, the Straw Hats have always only been Luffy, Zoro, Ussop, Robin and Franky.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kin'emon can use black Haki, maybe you mean his torso is above Brook level.</br>  <br>Sabo and Law dont like Romeo<br><br>Only Luffy and Zoro would have a problem with Bellamy but clearly Luffy has adopted Bellamy into his sphere of protection and Zoro does whatever Luffy wants</br></br></br>  <br> Zoro didn't even ask Brook to help him cut steel but Kinemon yes <br><br>Brook is even worse. No haki, his speed can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse, skeleton body can't take much damage. Nigga should fight with music hax like Apoo.</br></br></br>  <br>Kinemon owned Brooke easily with no head and no legs...<br>Also Brooke isn't weak.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>The power of dubs says new crew member.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well he's been fighting weaker characters since post-timeskip. We've seen him struggle with Fuji, so we know he's not all-powerful yet. I suspect he'll get a real challange during the Wano/Kaido arc.</br>  <br> no Moocy <br><br>I guess</br></br></br>  <br>I don't really see the point of Brook being another swordman, a sorcerer or some other shit would have worked better.</br>  Bellamy is at the SH sleepover but Barto is not.<br><br>THIS IS FUCKING BULLSHIT. I'M WAY MAD!!!</br></br>  <br>Zoro was left for dead unconscious KOd by the yeti cool brothers last arc, but I still agree with you he needs a hard fight.</br>  <br>Brook ran off because he was creeped out though<br><br>I'm sure that's officially a 'defeat' but they havent gone all out</br></br></br>  <br>Brook is a bard with some swordsmanship.<br><br>He mostly will just sit around playing music to buff the party.</br></br></br>  <br>He is the soul king, he is just also competent with swords.<br>His music is his #1 weapon.</br></br>  <br> can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse <br>Literally what.</br></br>  We need Brook to be more like Apoo.<br><br>Damn Apoo is one cool fucking character.</br></br>  <br>He directly stated<br> too strong! <br>Before he ran away. Of course he was scared, a torso swordsman was coming at him like a demon and he could barely defend himself.<br>Vs Doffy Kinemon did as good as Zoro or arguably better.</br></br></br></br>  <br> &gt;too strong! <br>scan?</br></br>  On a side note, there's a mistake in one of the panels.  Alright guys it's speculation time.<br><br>How is Sanji able to escape from a yonkou and Capone for half a day?<br><br>My guess is that Mom actually got Ceasar and Capone is trying to retrieve him.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  Kyros can grow legs! Starfish zoan!  <br>Law fixed him</br>  <br>Sanji already said he wasn't giving Caesar up. So if BM has him then Sanji and co. surely went after him<br><br>alternately, they could just have sailed out of range. No way in hell is Big Mom's ship any variant of speedy</br></br></br>  <br>But they showed Capone and his possy at least near Big Mom's ship. Saying alright guys lets get this Ceasar dude.<br>So I'm assuming Ceasar is at least close to Big Mom's ship as well.</br></br>  <br>perhaps they were pursuing from a distance</br>  <br>That would be super anticlimactic.<br><br>Like Oda shows Sanji the the rest in no danger whatsoever being all like "wew that was close, good thing we had cola"<br><br>Although it makes the most sense to how he managed to survive for so long.</br></br></br></br></br>  Has any devil fruit user hacked his powers to an extent comparable to Kuma?  794 Sabo's adventure<br>Doflamingo lends his sunglasses to a Flamingo<br>(but hiding his face from the readers)<br><br>FUCK YOU ODA</br></br></br></br>  <br>Those are Bellamys legs. Look at his arm. Most likely turned in his sleep.</br>  <br>Shanks so strong he can swim even with his devil fruit.</br>  <br>This is manga streams translation.<br>In another it says "too strong" and in all of them the point Brooke makes is that the torso is scary and incredibly strong.<br><br>Seeing as it was just a torso, and that this is post skip Brooke, it is only reasonable to consider Kinemon as <br>Very strong.<br>Oda intentionally keeps him out of serious fight scenes so far to hide this.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Belamy is obviously the guy in the middle..</br>  <br>Whoops wrong pic<br>To argue that Kinemon is "brooks tier" when he was owning him like guy um a did but without a fucking head and wit joint legs, and adding on that he engaged Doffy better than Sanji and zoro (rescued law), is fucking stupid.<br><br>He challenge Zoro and he is strong enough for it to be a real challenge.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obvious Kinemon is a beast.<br><br>I mean the fucker was able to overpower brook without even being able to see. He probably was just fighting on reflex or something.<br><br>Also he can speak with his farts.<br><br>As to how he could hear form his butt. That is still unclear to me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They're D's after all</br>  <br>He overpowered Brooke WITHOUT LEGS.<br>and only using one sword instead of his two.<br><br>He's going to be the hardest winnable fight zoro has had so far</br></br></br></br>  <br> his speed can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse <br>All that bumbling around he does is comic relief. His arrow-notch attack is too fast to be seen.</br></br>  <br> worst member <br> not Jora <br> not Diamante <br><br>Maybe if you're a fightfag he's the worst because I freely admit he's the weakest, but he's definitely not the worst character</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> As to how he could hear form his butt. That is still unclear to me. <br><br>Observation Haki is my only guess</br></br></br>  The best.  At Kyros' house in the flowerfield<br>Sabo tells Robin to not wake up Luffy, he just came to see him one last time before leaving<br>CP0 is returning to the island to capture Sabo and other revolutionaries. <br>In a day or two Dressrosa will be packed with people. He advises the Strawhats to leave as early as possible. <br>Zoro and Franky comments they had no idea Luffy had another brother besides Ace. <br>Sabo explains he was supposed to be dead all these years, and tells his story. <br><br>After the trio became brothers and that fateful day where he met Dragon and later gunned down by the Celestial dragon, as he sank in the sea Dragon came and rescued him before he sank. <br>When he regained consciousness, Sabo had no memory of who he was, or even his own name. <br>The revolutionary points out his belongings have the name Sabo, but he cannot recall. <br>Dragon says he's certain the child is a Goa nobility and another revolutionary offers to find his parents and return him to them, but Sabo yells in rejection. <br>He'd rather be taken away from here. <br><br>Sabo explains to Zoro that while he didn't have any memory, he felt strong desire to not return to his parents. <br>He explains it was Ace who brought his memory back... at the worst timing. <br><br>back to flashback<br><br>Revolutionaries were reading the news about Whitebeard, and how he and Fire Fist Ace died. <br>Upon hearing that name and seeing Ace's image, memory floods Sabo's head. <br>As he hears details of Ace's death and regains memory of their time together, tears flood Sabo's eyes. <br>Ace... is my brother!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So did Bellamy hurt the Skypeians or what?  <br>Are you stupid?<br><br>A zombie RYUUMA attacked Brooke and he didn't run away.<br>A severely gimped Kinemon made him run though.<br><br>That says everything.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All will be revealed in his eventual flashback.</br>  <br>why would Brook be scared of zombie Ryuma?<br><br>Ryuma had Brook's own personality but Brook has been scared of ghosts since his introduction</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck this hurts, every time Ace is brought up its like another wave of sad to me. Why did I think this was going to be any different.</br>  <br> why would he be scared of a zombie of a legendary swordsman using a legendary blade <br>You are grasping at straws. Brooke engaged Kinemon first, realized he was too strong, and ran away. He made a second exchange before running, once Kinemon used his left arm as a substitute for legs successfully, only then did Brooke run.</br></br>  <br>Welp. incoming wave of Ace x Sabo fanart</br>  <br>That explains everything.</br>  <br> CP0 is returning to the island to capture Sabo and other revolutionaries.  <br><br>This is such bad writing if it's true.<br><br>CP0 should have never left the island in the first place considering THEY knew Dofla wanted to lure in the Strawhats to Dressrosa and he even said it to them considering they faked the news so Dofla could lure Law and Luffy to the island and also that means Robin was coming and the entire Cipher Pol organization has been trying to capture Robin since forever that even someone with Robin's hairstyle will get immediately captured and taken away to a CIA style prison and interrogated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sabo never mentioned or hinted at until the flashback arc that introduces him after Ace's death <br> Amnesia that conveniently goes away after Ace dies and explains why he never showed up until now </br></br>  Sabo screams and passes out. <br>He sleeps for three days before regaining consciousness, and sees worried Hack and crying Koala. <br>Koala tearfully asks Sabo if he's going to quit the revolutionary now that his memory is regained. <br>Sabo puts her worries to rest telling her he has no intention of leaving them, and that he needs to speak with Dragon. <br><br>2 years later...<br>Sabo tells his comrades to let the entire revolutionary army know, he's going after a devil fruit. <br><br>Sabo's reunion with Luffy. The silent conversation we didn't hear is now revealed. <br>It's me, Luffy! Sabo greets his brother. Luffy doesn't recognize him and tells him whoever you are if you're after the Mera Mera fruit you're an opponent! And my name is Lucy, don't call me Luffy!<br><br>But Sabo replies, a disguise can't hide my brother from me. <br>Luffy replies brother? Only person who can call me brother is Ace who died, and.... Luffy realizes at this point. <br>Tears swell in his eyes as Luffy realizes it's Sabo. At first he refuses to believe him, but upon mentioning stealing Dadan's sake, Luffy hugs him in tears. <br>Luffy's screams are illegible as he can't even talk straight. Sabo thanks Luffy for staying alive. <br>Luffy cries he allowed Ace to die in front of his eyes, but Sabo tells him he's glad he didn't lose TWO brothers that day in his absence. <br>If I lost you, I would have been all alone. Thank you for surviving, Luffy.<br>He asks Luffy if he can have the Mera Mera fruit, and Luffy nods in tears in agreement. <br><br>flashback ends</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Brook ran because he was scared (of ghosts. Brook being scared of ghosts isnt a new thing)but also because suddenly going two-sword style was bullshit and he'd had enough</br>  <br> Fujitora really is a shitty Admiral. <br><br>Fujitora had his snail call with Akainu during the afternoon but it's already nighttime in Dressrosa and Fujitora still hasn't done shit.<br><br>Can there be any more of a lazy Admiral that is probably a Revolutionary Spy instead?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They didn't know why Dofly wanted a fake newspaper article. They just did it cause he's a fuckin noble.</br>  <br>he probably couldn't find them and is now playing dice with some randos</br>  <br><br>powerlevel fags please go</br></br>  <br>Dude is blind. He'll never find them!</br>  <br>im talking fear levels not power levels</br>  <br>Dressrosa is already in ruins as it is. I don't think he wanted to cause any more damage to it until luffy and law leave the island.</br>  Memory loss is so cheap.  Sabo gets ready to leave, and shows the straw hat crew Luffy's Vivre card he made. <br>He tears off a piece for himself, and gives the rest to Zoro. <br>He tells them Luffy may cause a lot of trouble, but please take care of him. <br>Robin waves farewell with a smile, while Franky tearfully tells him to leave him up to them.<br>Zoro laughs, says you sound just like Ace. <br><br>Sabo calls Hack, and tells him he's on his way. <br>Hack tries to ask him about how Luffy is doing, but Sabo cuts off the phone early again. <br>Apparently this is his quirky habit, as Hack yells and swings a punch<br><br>Sabo rides a pack of crows as he heads back to his men. <br>He asks the leading crow if they're ready to sail, and the crow answers "anytime". <br>Well then, let's hurry!<br><br>End of chapter, no chapter next issue.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I can see people complaining about this cliche but it works. Sabo needed a strong trigger to remember who he was. Sure is ironic that ace death is the trigger for him to regain his memories.</br>  <br>I'm not a power level fag I just know a strong swordsman when Oda introduces one into the manga.<br>Kinemon is a much stronger swordsman that Brooke, if it offends you that some are better with swords than others I apologize but Zoro's dream requiresit</br></br>  Akainu is likely preparing to kill or order Fujitora to be killed now.<br><br>The moon is out and it's been hours since his last call with Fujitora.<br><br>Akainu isn't dumb.<br><br>He now knows Fujitora can't be trusted from his phone call with him since Fujitora has admitted that he delays vital information to Akainu and even priortizes Akainu last.<br><br>I wouldn't be surprised if Akainu ordered Kizaru to go to Dressrosa as a Marine backup plan because Fujitora isn't willing to do everything he can to bring victory to the Marines.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pack of talking crows out of fucking nowhere!</br>  <br>How the fuck does Zoro know about Ace's personality when Zoro and Ace barely had an actual conversation together?</br>  <br>Sabo could have wait until luffy wakes up and say his goodbyes to him before leaving.

It's Yakuza-speak</br></br></br>  just me or is robin much hotter this chapter?  <br>I had no thought of that but yes, exactly</br>  <br>Dragon a logia confirmed?</br>  <br>Why is Doffy hiding his face?<br>My theory is he hides a SMiLE</br></br>  <br>you never see the puppeteer</br>   no chapter next week <br>everytime</br>  <br> implying where Garp goes, Bogart doesn't follow </br>  <br>Isn't he as old as Garp?</br>  <br>Bogard wasn't at Marineford.</br>  <br>Rule 34 shits are getting busy right now too</br>  <br>He's much younger looking than Garp but strong enough to hang out with Garp and earn Garp's confidence.</br>  Alright next chapter should finally be switching back to sanji.  <br>Good thing us normals can enjoy SaboxKoala OTP</br>  <br> doflamingo is PRETENDING to be the master of puppets, but he's not, that's what this cover shows. </br>  <br>Took a cannon ball to the face and he was just a kid at the time on a small ship, the damage could have been a lot worse.</br>  <br> Nope, Zoro will roller coaster all of his fights until Kaidou swordman <br><br> Zou <br> A country with swordsman so strong that the WG and Yonko avoid it. </br></br></br></br>  <br>nah next chapter is Cavendish et all sorting themselves out<br><br>THEN we'll get a glimpse of Sanji's singed eyebrow in the very last panel of the chapter<br><br>then it'll switch to Luffytachi leaving with whoever is taking them to Zou<br><br>Chapter after that will show the supernovas all doing whatever they're doing<br><br>THEN we get to Sanjitachi</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wano you mean, and guess where Kinemon came from</br>  <br>Nigga you even party?</br>  <br> A country with swordsman so strong that the WG and Yonko avoid it. <br><br>Not true at all.<br><br>Wano are all Kaidou's bitches and they even lost the corpse of their national hero.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shonen series tend to be cheap. Just get used to it already.</br>  <br> &gt;CP0 is returning to the island to capture Sabo and other revolutionaries. In a day or two Dressrosa will be packed with people. He advises the Strawhats to leave as early as possible.  <br>Confirmed no party.</br></br>   CP0 is after Sabo and the revs <br>Have they at least tried to contact the goddamn Admiral currently on the island?<br><br>Aren't these organizations on the same side?</br></br></br>  Well shit, when was the last time Zoro ever looked this happy?  If they needed totanna slave labor to make devil fruits, why didn't they turn them into toys?  <br>the same thing happened at PH though<br><br> people are coming after us so we have to leave quickly <br> so it's Party time! </br></br></br></br>  <br>would negate their insane power?</br>  <br> Aren't these organizations on the same side? <br>Not really. Cipher Pol is a totally different organization than the Marines.</br></br>  <br>There hasn't been a good party since Sky Island</br>  <br>You forgot about Fishman Island.</br>  <br> New formed pirate alliance between Kid, Apoo, and Hawkins. <br> Bonnie wanted by the government. <br> Those Wizard of Oz theories. <br> Doffy is controlling all of them. <br><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN? ITS STARTING TO COME TOGETHER.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Wano are all Kaidou's bitches and they even lost the corpse of their national hero <br>That just helps establish that they're a) a culture in decline and b) that Kaidou is a serious threat to hold such powerful warriors under his thumb.</br></br>  <br>The fact that Ace was created solely to die makes me almost as angry as the fact that Sabo was only made to just replace him after he died. Right down to the same fucking fruit powers</br>  <br> Doflamingo is awakened paramecia <br> has the power to pull metaphorical strings </br></br>  <br> he sank in the sea Dragon came and rescued him <br><br>Well fuck, the "wind" Dragon used to rescue the Goa hobos may just be monstrous CoC haki.</br></br></br>  <br>thing is, Ace is almost certainly going to be reborn into a new character. His 'will' has probably been passed on to Makino's child</br>  <br> He asks the leading crow if they're ready to sail, and the crow answers "NEVERMORE". </br>  <br>Nope, CP works under the Gorosei, CP0 goes even beyond and works directly under the Tenryuubito. One Piece government works just as Imperial japan in ww2, every branch of the militar forces is too proud to coordinate with another.</br>  <br>forget it, just saw the raw</br>  <br> crow <br>Literally the poem is called The Raven.</br></br>  <br>cp0 doesn't work for the gorosei, they serve only the tenryubito which is why akainu mentions how they let the dogs of the tenryubito go over their (gorosei's) heads</br>    so what bullshit is going to be luffy's awakening?  <br>at least we get 5 consecutive chapters now before the break instead of 4</br>  <br>I'd say what Gear 4th already is.<br><br>Retaining his elasticity seems to be the best option, just pulling something new outta Luffy's ass hopefully won't be the solution.<br><br>Unless its balla.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>making other thing elastic</br>  <br> at least we get 5 consecutive chapters now before the break instead of 4 <br><br> Oda is now smoking an extra pack. <br> He is getting even closer to the grave now. <br><br>ripip Oda, we will never see the end of One Piece now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>if he can turn things into rubber for a moment, then he can use haki to manipulate the environment <br>so he could actually have robin like powers, imagine a giant rubber/rock haki fist</br></br>  <br>Come on anon, it's not like Oda's been hiding it or anything.</br>  <br>Why is this a chapter when the new movie/special is going to be exactly that?</br>  <br>Because the special isn't canon and Oda isn't about to bring a character that's supposed to be dead for about 20 years and say nothing about it.</br>   "...Well, shit" <br>Fucking Niggastream</br>  <br>Best fight in the manga. Hands down.</br>  <br>They're fuckups but sometimes they fuck up so well.</br>  Does this mean we're getitng a chapter tonight? As in a day earlier?  <br>Where do you get your updates about Oda's smoking habits? People always quote how much they think he smokes without ever giving any reason. I'm inclined to believe you're bullshitting.</br>  <br>Crocodile, he can drain moisture from a MASSIVE area and create sandstorms that can travel across an entire country.<br>Luffy, I'm fairly certain that those gears are ridiculously hax.</br></br>  <br>Traditionally samurai carry 2 swords but only use 1, so I dont think he usually dual wields. He does against the birdcage because he needs more surface area to push.</br>  <br>Wano you mean.</br>  <br>It's kind of strange how I like the Heart Pirates although I don't know much about them. How much do people love Kid's crew? Like not just Killer. His crew.<br><br>And I also want to know why Kid's epithet is "Captain". Wait, does Bepo have an epithet? How much is his bounty even? Damn, now I'm curious about the wanted posters of the other crews.</br></br></br>  <br> Where do you get your updates about Oda's smoking habits? <br><br>Whenever Oda works hard he smokes hard. The man is a pack a day smoker.<br><br>He's working an extra week now before breaks, do the math.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Flawless logic is flawless.</br>  <br>Zou is part of Wano Kingdom, no?<br><br>same diff</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Oh my god a sleeping Law. OH MY GOD</br></br></br>  <br>Zou is Kaido's island</br>  <br>I dont know about anyone else but im kind of attached to Heat and Wire<br><br>they're cute</br></br></br>  <br>Kidd and Law are the only other Supernova captains with crews that seem like they actually have personality.</br>  <br> Kaido on Elephant island <br><br>Well i guess we know what kind of beast he is</br></br></br>  <br><br>Where the hell is Cavendish?</br></br>  <br>Bepo has a bounty of 500.</br>  PANDA OUT!  <br>Probably wrapped in chains, there's a fucking good reason people DON'T want to sleep near him.</br>  <br>I fucked up. Sorry, just reread the chapter and it looks like I'm a fuckin moron.</br>  <br> The man is a pack a day smoker. <br>That is pretty casual and people call him a chain smoker? pffff</br></br>  <br>kek'd<br> New captcha! Mountains! </br></br>  <br>wow you must smell like a trashcan<br><br> Smoker please go </br></br></br>  <br>That cover photo. I want to know what it's about. What does the Wizard of Oz have to do with Doffy?</br>  <br>No</br>  <br>And guarded by Kinemon and Kanjuro maybe. Because they're not in the picture too.</br>  <br>It's probably not even that anymore since his tonsillectomy.</br>  <br>What fucking fruit?</br>  <br>The same thing Pinocchio has to do with Usopp. Nothing.</br>  <br>This picture got me strangely hyped. Brook when?</br>  <br>Nah, they're different islands. The only connection they have for the reader is that they're nearby each other and/or Kinemon and the SHs are going there for a stopover on the way.</br>  <br> The same thing Pinocchio has to do with Usopp. Nothing. <br><br>are you dumb?</br></br></br>   Zoro just sitting there listening to sabo make up bullshit excuses for why he let ace die and luffy getting a hole in the chest <br><br>Lost my respect for zoro completely.<br><br>he could definitely cut down sabo, fruit or not, if he tried</br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br> I dont like Sabo <br> Zoro should kill Sabo </br></br>  <br>kill yourself</br>  <br>Are you?</br>  <br>Stop posting and better stop reading too</br>  <br>do you not know what Pinocchio's gimmick is?<br><br>Why the hell do you think USOpp's nose is so long?</br></br></br>  Escaping by birds seems really stupid and I highly doubt those birds are enough to carry all those revolutionaries off of Dressrosa.<br><br>Looks like you also have to sit and not move around while sitting on those birds.<br><br>Don't see any reason how revolutionaries won't be easy targets for the Marines or anybody with a gun.</br></br></br></br>  <br>perhaps flying off in the middle of the night on difficult to see birds aids their escape?<br><br>Maybe Sabo is sitting still to be polite but doesnt really need to</br></br></br>  <br>I meant something totally different. I don't feel like explaining, so let's just say I am an idiot.</br>  <br>I believe those are for personal use of Sabo and it's clear they will only transport him to the harbor.</br>  Fujitora is going to need a head before Akainu blows his top like krakatoa. Relentlessly pursues Luffy and the gang. It doesn't look good for Strawhat. Law comes up with a compromise using Shambles to separate his head and gives it to Fujitora, Law gives his body to Strawhats to return the other half to his crew in Wano.<br><br>Calling it.</br></br>  <br>Good pic of Ryokugyu you have in there.</br>  http://www.ishuhui.com/archives/374<wbr>261<br><br>new chapter 794</br></br></wbr>  <br>slowpoke.jpg</br>  Why do we get the chapter so early this week?  <br>makes the sunny go rubber on a pinch during a naval battle</br>  <br>Something about a early release.</br>  <br>Since we can already predict Green Bull's face from a mile away.<br><br>Which Mifune should Oda go with? Shaven Gangster Mifune or Gruff Samurai Mifune?</br></br></br>  Guess whose birthday it is today!   lel guyz I had amnesia haha XDD <br>This is the lamest fucking excuse he could have went for. Jesus christ this is fucking bad. Simply could have said that Sabo was on a mission and didnt know. Or that he had his own obligations and no time. But no. He didn kno.</br>  <br> Or that he had his own obligations and no time. But no. He didn kno. <br>amnesia is a better explanation than your alternative, luffy ditched his entire crew to try and save ace, sabo did nothing - if it weren't for amnesia that'd make sabo a really shitty brother, especially given the fact that if sabo had his memories, he'd have tons of years to hear of ace and seek him out</br></br>  <br> his is the lamest fucking excuse <br>why, explain</br></br>  <br> his speed can't even keep up with Kinemon's corpse <br>Do you happen to mean Ryuma's corpse?<br> Nigga should fight with music hax like Apoo <br>He does a fair bit.<br><br><br><br>Kinemon also regarded/complemented Brook's strength too iirc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Its not you fucking mongoloid. Amesia is the easy way out for the author. The way a fucking hack would choose. Putting other obligations first would show that he actually has a mission. That hes a character with purpose and has his own goals that need to be fulfilled. Especially since his goals are so different to the goals of pirates.<br><br> a really shitty brother <br>Yeah, or someone who simply respects these 'pirate rules' Ace spoke of and has a life of his own.</br></br></br></br>  Sadpanda thread.

It's not even shit, it's just nonexistent.</br></br></br>  <br>Then it's simple. This title is not for you.</br>  Leopard-Raws out, fuck I wait for this.<br>Ohys can't into encoding.</br>  <br><br> Just light novels with this premise. Most seem to be bad. I thought this would be something new and refreshing.</br></br>  <br><br>I'm getting bad harem vibes. I like spooky skeletons just not badly written ones. For what its worth the mc seems fine.</br></br>  <br>So Ainz doesn't like the anime?</br>  <br>How is it a harem with only two women?</br>  <br>Does it matter? It's not like the plotline is about lot's of girls fall for average high school guy.<br>Those bitches are practically created to suck to adore the ground he is walking on.</br></br>  <br>2 so far.

I want to hold Shalltear's hand and caress her softly and make sweet and gentle love to her and pamper her as she carries our undead child and gives me a beautiful true vampire daughter and we live in a 2spooky mansion and not care about what the world thinks of us  <br>Yep on both counts.

Oh right… Since you are making clothes for boys, I should inform you earlier. The Supreme Beings seem to prefer young boys wearing girls clothing's alright?” <br> “... Eh?” </br>  <br>Happy Mare is best Mare. Thanks Stalker.</br>  <br>Yeah they get worse</br>  You've forgotten chidori's notes, what do you do?  <br>Sniff her tomboy feet.</br>  <br>eww</br>  I try to remember the basics of CQC.  <br>What are those orange splotches?</br>  <br>This is what FMP fags actually believe. <br>LOL<br>O<br>L.</br></br></br></br>  Touma got a letter~<br>Touma got a letter~<br>Touma got a letter~<br>Wonder who it's from?<br><br>Chapter 1, 7/10 parts translated:<br>http://www.baka-tsuki.org/project/i<wbr>ndex.php?title=Toaru_Majutsu_no_Ind<wbr>ex:NT_Volume13_Chapter_1</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i swear toumas fucking retarded sometimes.</br>  <br> Chapter 1, 7/10 parts translated: <br>translated by js06*<br>Can't have you guys thinking I've become a translator just yet.</br></br></br>  Are Mikotofags BTFO yet?  <br>Is that Seria?<br>She looks mad as fuck.<br>Anyone could think that she knows the TouMAN has massive harem of girls craving his T, so why she looks so mad over a letter?</br></br></br>  <br>Touma got a love letter telling him to meet them up on the roof and Seria and Mikoto both didn't write it, Touma got psyched for it and ran off, so yeah somewhat</br>  <br>nice quads, also she was being retarded about that whole mess so it makes sense.</br>  <br> “B-but don’t you have someone you like, a girl you’re interested in, or an older girl you’re always thinking about? Like a nearby upperclassman?” <br><br> “Thaaaat is a completely different issue!! Getting a love letter and having a girl be the one who confesses her love to you is enough to earn one of life’s trophiiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeeeessssssssss<wbr>ssssssss!!”</wbr> <br><br> (I’m going to kill him and bury him! District 21’s mountains should work!!) <br><br> (I’m going to kill him and bury him! District 21’s mountains should work!!) <br><br>I don't fault Seria and Mikoto. I would've joined them.<br><br>There's one other undercurrent in his line:<br><br> having a girl be the one who confesses her love to you <br><br>Even after Index discovers his lost memory, he still considers the Touma Index confessed to in the OT1 Epilogue a separate person.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I just notice how psychotic Touma's harem is</br>   Kamijou just about leapt into that chest overflowing with motherhood, but this girl had seriously saved his life back there. Based on how the school was still shaking from further blasts, that was no joke. He did not want to bother her, so he gathered the strength of his heart to restrain himself. <br><br> However, Kumokawa Seria had secretly tensed her shoulders and elbows in preparation, so she pouted her lips when nothing happened. <br><br> “(Hm. Sometimes being a gentleman can come full circle and be cruel.)”  <br> “The orientation isn’t limited to our school, right? If you’re really worried for your life, it would probably be best to evacuate the school grounds until the heat dies down.” <br><br> “Y-you’re right. Okay! Thanks a bunch, senpai! I’ll be going now!!” <br><br> “Eh? No, wait. I was suggesting I could wander around with you!!” <br> “Huh? Senpai? Why are you here?” <br><br> He turned around by the shoe lockers and Kumokawa Seria cleared her throat. <br><br> “You can head outside if you want, but there will be ‘police officers’ out on the streets, too. Do you know how you’ll escape and what you’ll use for transportation?” <br><br> “Yeah, no worries there. There’s that new bicycle…um, the acrobike? Y’know, that electrically assisted monster. Komoe-sensei got a little carried away and ordered one for us, so I can borrow that.” <br><br> “(Now, I’m getting pissed off. He never thinks anything through, so why is he so prepared now of all times!?)”  <br><br>Seria a cute and Touma a dense motherfucker. It's kind of funny and adorable how she wants Touma to just jump on her and how she wants to get closer to him and tries to give him a fucking hint to go for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Seria's pissed off face <br>Why boner</br></br>  Man, Touma's a lucky fucker to get that letter. Who woulda thought such a hot girl wanted his T?<br>Shippers BTFO</br>  Observer girl when?  <br> Who woulda thought such a hot girl wanted his T? <br>That usually doesn't end well</br></br>  Last thread <br> GcUKb19e </br>  <br> dat buttdevastation <br> those threats <br>Touma is a human bean not a trophy for these cunts.</br></br></br>  <br> Even after Index discovers his lost memory, he still considers the Touma Index confessed to in the OT1 Epilogue a separate person. <br><br>This makes sense though. Just because it was physically him doesn't mean it was mentally him.</br></br></br>  <br> yfw Index confesses first AGAIN </br>   Headband girl was finally acknowledged <br>Fucking High Priest, and Kamachi</br>  <br> eventually all Raildex memes will be acknowledged <br> yfw Aleister is literally the memelord </br></br>  How does he keep dodging all the flags Seria keeps sending at him?<br><br>Christ, they were practically like rain drops!</br></br>  <br> yfw Aleister controlls all </br>  <br> SUFFERING </br>  <br>Poor headcrab.

I didn’t get my hopes at all. Not in the slightest!! You’re probably some magician after Index, so hurry up and attack so I can destroy your illusion alreadyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy<wbr>yyyyy!!”</wbr> <br><br><br>Jahahahhhahahh</br></br></br></br>  <br>So is Touma officially the dumbest person alive?</br>   Tsuchimikado was entirely focused on running down the hallway, but Kamjiou, man among men in white briefs, had a different idea. <br><br>-<br>“If we’re going to talk about some unbelievable hidden side of the world, can I take this off first?”<br><br> Yes. <br><br> As the target of the anti-crime orientation, Kamijou was wearing skin-colored tights, white briefs, and a trench coat. <br><br> The High Priest’s eyes opened wide (even if it was unclear whether he actually had eyeballs or not). <br><br> He then spoke in a tone that suggested he was about to be overwhelmed by the trembling of his heart. <br><br> “You only enter your serious mode when you remove your briefs!?” <br><br> “Don’t make things up, old man.” <br><br> dat entire Headband girl troll <br><br>Kamachi's going all out this volume, shit's as funny as the Touma Othinus banter back in NT10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Holy shit Mikoto just keeps getting shittier.  <br>Seria what the fuck, he just told you what you need to win the Toumabowl, just fucking DO IT.<br>YOU AREN'T STUPID FOR FUCKS SAKE, YOU ARE A FUCKING WALKING BRAIN, SO ADD 1 AND 1 AND FUCKING CONFESS<br><br>EVERYONE IN THIS FUCKING SERIES IS DENSER THAN A NEUTRON STAR!!</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why does Touma wearing Kagun's clothes?</br>  <br>CONFESS SERIA, JUST SWALLOW ALL YOUR INNER SPAGHETTI AND CONFESS<br><br>THE TOUMABOWL IS RIGHT AT YOUR FINGERTIPS</br></br></br>  <br>That would be Mikoto or Seria if they have ANY downtime with him this volume and don't use it to deliver their own confessions.<br><br>I mean goddamn, the guy is literally jumping in joy because of an anonymous letter he can barely read. They have the key to victory. No more excuses, its right fucking there.</br></br></br>  <br>Because  he has lost it </br>  <br>I don't think Kagun was wearing just briefs under his coat</br>  <br>ARE YOU ME BY ANY CHANCE, YOU CAPSLOCK USING, ANGERED BROTHER!?</br>  The headband girl is the observer?<br><br><br>What a twestttt</br></br></br>  Purple is my way of life.  <br>Her hair is black though</br>  <br>PERHAPS, MY AMIGO<br><br>GODDAMN THE TOUMABOWL IS SO FUCKING EASY TO WIN, JUST CONFESS AND YOU WIN<br><br>AND DON'T ACT LIKE A TOTAL SLUT PRIOR, LIKE LESSAR DID</br></br></br></br></br>  Why are all the girls in this series so beta?<br><br>Why are the few ones that aren't beta doomed to lose and watch from afar how the other girls keep fucking up their own chances of winning the Toumabowl?</br></br>  You know it's going to be an assassin or someone asking for help and not an actual person confessing love to him, he'll get all down, and end up dragged into a big fight for the rest of the volume, ending with an anticlimactic scene with Index or Mikoto (or both) at the end while he's all tired and fukouda  <br>Because Touma is unlucky.</br>  <br>Because in the end this is an action comedy, romance has no place unless you're a side chatacter</br>  <br>LESSAR NEVER HAD FEELINGS FOR TOUMA<br>JUST FOR THE T<br>AND HIS HAND<br>SO SHE WAS A SLUT<br>BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM<br>BESIDES SHE'S AN STUPID KID<br><br>SERIA ISN'T STUPID CAMARADA<br>SHE'S A FUCKING BRAIN<br>FROM THE HIGHER UPS OF AC<br>WHAT THE FUCK IS SHE THINKING</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It looks purple to me.</br>  Reminder that Maria &gt; Seria.  <br> Hamazura <br> Side character <br><br>Fuck you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because being Touma is suffering and he can't be allowed to find happiness with a girl.<br><br>I can't wait for the inevitable asspull where Touma will finally be able to remember Misaki though.</br></br></br>  <br>Maria=Seria<br>Both Kumokawas a best Science</br></br>  <br> Touma will finally be able to remember Misaki <br>He will.  In his deathbed. </br></br>  <br>To be fair it wouldn't really be that much of an asspull if one of the Magic Gods just said fuck it, and fixed all of his brain problems, and gave him back all of his memories</br>  <br>That hag was cute.<br>I hope she shows up again sometime soon.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Is that Fukiyose? I thought her name was Seiri or whatever why the change? Even the anime pronounces her name as Seiri.</br></br></br>  <br><br> One of the many worlds Othinus created to mindfuck Touma <br> Same world as original <br> But Touma without amnesia <br> And without the Misaki bullshit amnesia <br> He rejected that world <br> But still remembers it <br> He's been fooling everyone since NT9 <br> Just like after OT1 </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   the entire Sisters arc <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FGi<wbr>tBIedvbY</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>Somehow I can see this happening. The Christmas arc better deliver some TWEEST about this.</br>  <br>Seria never appeared in the anime.<br>Fukiyose did.<br>Seria is in OP's pic.<br>Not Fukiyose.<br> Seria would never stab Touma, unlike Fukiyose. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying othinus is beta <br>shes not even watching from afar, her problem is literally shes a 15 CM midget that as such would have one hell of a time trying to do anything in a relationship.<br>like god damn.</br></br></br>  <br>he needs to know his place.</br>  <br>She's Kumokawa Seria, Touma's senpai who hasn't appeared in the anime, her being very similar to Fukiyose is actually a rivalry point of theirs, though her main rival is Misaki</br>  <br>Well that was unintentionally lewd.</br>  You know, at first glance at the top-left panel, I mistook that silly bitch with the fan for a boy.  <br> if this scene was Mikoto and Touma in the exact same context she would be called a violent bitch </br>  <br> expecting confession by Misaka  <br> got confession by some old ass mummy <br>Fuck off kamachi<br><br><br>Her 15cm size is not a problem. They can still develop her relationship with Touma as show in NT12. Besides when she goes back to being human she attains the body she had before becoming a magic god. Which is most likely that of a 14 year old girl and being normal size.<br><br>I am still expecting a confession by Othinus at the end of NT. That is a must have.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what did he say to upset her anyway?</br>  <br><br>Oh wow... Raildex generals are still alive?<br><br> Oh the memories!<br><br>Tell me, are there still huge shitstorms if a certain character is implied to have intercourse with members of the suidae family?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>isn't that partly because of how often Mikoto does things like that?</br>  <br> suidae <br>is that a type of ice-cream or something?</br></br>  <br>Probably, also Saiai gets a pass because she's so lewd</br>  <br>No, instead the shitstorms are originated if said character is implied not to have chances in the Toumabowl or if another girl is closer than her to him.</br>  <br>What if they were to have intercourse with members of the Hominidae family?</br>  <br>yes anon yes.<br>also waifu wars, right now NT 13 came out recently so theres shit to talk about.<br>such as the anti-touma.</br></br></br>  <br>That certain character just can't catch a break in these threads. Though lately we've had shitstorms over other characters too, like notMarisa and gyara hanbun.</br>  <br> OTP <br><br>Silly anon, Takitsubou already won.</br></br></br>  <br>Takitsubo may be Hamazura's waifu but Psy Eye is his mistress</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Ok, then i wont shit on her. <br><br>So what has Accelerator been up to? Still having peaceful life with LO?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Saiai <br>I swear, that little bitch is turning me into a paedophile.</br></br>  <br>He's been lifting and now he can take a punch to the face from the T, and helps the guy out when he's off fighting the world, but besides that mostly just living peacefully with his family</br>  <br><br><br><br>What are these from Railgun Manga?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't resist it, anon. Embrace it.</br>  The Observer is really everywhere  <br>Saiai murders old men for men for money. She's a *professional* violent bitch that usually chills out off the clock, and IIRC this is the first and only time we've seen her try to whack Hamazura. Every other time she's taking him out to the movies.<br><br>Mikoto is just crazy. She constantly attacked a guy on sight because she constructed a rivalry in her head.</br></br></br>  <br>maybe ITEM should just give up the pretense and all just start sleeping with him together.</br>  <br><br>He could always take A punch from the T. <br><br>Anyway, so hes basically become Vegita.</br></br></br></br>  <br>yep, chapter 78</br>  <br> Mikoto is just crazy <br>That's a Level 5 for you<br><br><br> sleeping with half-cyborg <br>I'd pass</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He would lose his composure back in the old days, now the nigga doesn't even flinch<br><br>Touma had to smash his own hand with a rock to deliver enough force to knock him out with a punch to the heart</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks bro.</br></br>  <br>So is she Kamachi?</br>  <br>is this another living hair-band creature possessing a female host, ala Uiharu?</br>  <br> kamachi's self insert is literally a touma stalker <br>thats hilarious.</br></br>  This is a boy   男だわ   No it fucking isn't.

Her voice is amazing.</br></br></br>  <br>Azumanga Daioh, unless you're mainly watching NNB for the scenery porn.<br><br>That's the "foundational work." Then watch other slice of life / cute girls doing cute things at random until you kill yourself when you eventually realize you will never be a cute schoolgirl.</br></br></br>    <br>Absolutely not.</br>      Can you beat this nigga at the ruler game, /a/?    The intro to the EDs both soothes and fills me with despair.  <br>I don't think I could beat him at anything he put his mind to</br>  <br>I choked for a entire minute.</br>  Why are there two Poplars this season?  <br>based as always</br>   I'll never play knock-down-the-ruler with anyone <br>Why even live?</br>  <br>You must be at least this cute to win.</br>  Suguru was born into the wrong genre. He should've been in anything that wasn't a slice of life.  <br> those tits <br> 11 years old </br></br>  <br>look at that face<br>she's gonna kick your ass if you don't choose your next words very carefully</br></br>  Here's my theory: They are trapped in a time loop and experiencing this for the 8 millionth time now. Only Nii-chan knows about this but isn't able to communicate for some deeper reason.    <br>I figured out that the future would refuse to change, so he gave up.</br>  <br>just tell the loudest one to do her homework and be done with it</br>  <br>That's the face she makes if you take away her waifu.<br><br>She cries first, then she gets murderous.</br></br></br>  <br>Well shit I'm going to jail</br>  <br> Kids, there's nothing more cool than being hugged by someone you like, but if someone tries to touch you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's no good! It's your body! No one has the right to touch you if you don't want them to! So what do you do? First, you say no, then you get outta there! Most important, you gotta tell someone you trust, like your parents, your teacher or a police officer. </br>  I remember watching the first Non Non Biyori because I saw images of dressed up Hotaru with glasses around and I thought she was like, an anime college girl that hit all my kinks.<br><br>Oh boy, when I watched the series... I don't know man, I just don't know.</br></br>  <br>Definitely tell the teacher!<br><br>Parents might judge you for being unclean, cops won't believe you. Only the teacher to turn to. I'm sure she'll help!</br></br></br>  Does she still?  <br>Did you SEE that sweater-vest?<br><br>She's just begging for a 5th grader to molest her.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Deepest lore.</br></br>  <br><br>no anon, best girl loves me</br></br>  <br>She feels nothing but hatred.</br>  <br>Probably. She's like the only one who approaches him and starts a conversation. She wants his dick so bad you can smell it.</br>  <br>Yes</br>  <br>I guess, after all I'm a 30 year old geezer, I could probably tackle Koma or Natsume and demand his surrender.</br>  <br>But what if it's my parent who is also a teacher and a police officer on the side?!</br>  Moe never changes.  <br> Spontaneous Moontube survery of NNB watchers <br> Bunch of 30 year olds <br>Also comments about kidnapping with vans.</br></br></br>  <br>the first episode sucked because renge is a shit character</br>  <br>Look what you did, Anon.</br>     Meowning   <br>Are you me?</br>    <br>http://nyanpass.com/</br>  <br> Not using meowning to greet everyone you run into in the morning </br>  <br><br>Oh hey, they changed the interface.</br></br>  <br> spam the button <br> sounds like vuvuzelas </br></br>  <br>It sounds MUCH cuter than that.</br>  <br/>    <br> I have no voice, and I must scream </br>   second season does not take place after season 1  <br><br>I don't like this</br></br>  I don't understand.<br><br>For some reason i'm not really enjoying S2, even though it's not different from S1 at all. S1 was my AOTY back then. Why am i not enjoying this as much?</br></br>  <br>I really liked both episodes in this season. I feel like Komari's character is finally falling into place. In S1 she was often used for more standard jokes than the rest of the cast. Same thing with Hotaru's obsession with her. In S1 it was jarringly otaku-ish in an otherwise very grounded series, but this episode was sweet.</br>  <br>Well I was expecting a continuation. Renge's loli-buddy showing up, the girls going on a trip to Tokyo (though that would be great as a longer ova), stuff from S1 forming traditions for the next year.<br><br>It's not bad, but it's a bit disappointing knowing the basic idea of what happens over an entire season from ep 1.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I was expecting (and hoping) for a continuation too, though honestly I don't mind so far. Both episodes of Repeat so far have been fun and adorable</br>  Does me being mad over the fact that they used a fucking human to voice the dog in e2 instead of taking actual dog sounds make me retarded?<br><br>It's an anime about life in a rural area, with the sound of cicadas, other bugs, birds, cows etc. in the background, which makes it very immersive and then they let a human voice the dog?<br><br>I'm sorry this triggered me so much /a/. Maybe i'm truly autistic.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Same here, it knocked me out of the moe zone but I laughed at it nonetheless</br>  <br>Are all dogs actually cursed lolicons?</br>  <br> Non Non Biyori Repeat <br> it's literally S1 repeated <br>Can someone tell me what the actual fuck is going on?</br></br></br>  <br><br>The apologists will be along shortly.</br></br>  Vivid subs when?  <br> literally <br> so far all material was not in S1 <br><br>alrighty then</br></br></br></br>  <br>You call that a curse? I wish I could get away with licking little girls' faces and dry humping their leg.</br>  <br>It was shit compared to the Katou Emiri dog in Gakkou Gurashi.</br>  <br>What cartoon is this semen demon from? Google only gives me "anime cry gif" results.</br>  <br>She's from tumblr and should never have been used here.</br>  <br>Can Nii-chan beat servants at the ruler game</br>  I had forgotten how adorable everyone is.<br>And damn, the complete darkness in that scene made me miss a few things from the past. Sadly I didn't have a tiny Komari back then.</br>  <br> jpg </br>  <br><br>Sword Art Online. She's a terrible character.</br></br>  More like Non Non Boresme  Is this the first time Hotarun act like a real 5th grade?

It looks fun.  <br>Just make some friends anon!  ;~; </br>  <br>It wouldn't be that weird if I went to the store just to buy 4 different rulers for myself? r-right?</br>  <br>It's like Hidamari Sketch. You get new material that wasn't in the previous season.</br>  <br>Except there are things that have not been resolved.<br>One of them being one of the main reasons I fucking picked up the second season.</br></br>  <br>You shouldn't worry too much about it, maybe the sequel eps will be at the end or an OVA</br>  <br>I don't got another 2 years to wait for this shit.<br>This was the entire reason I was waiting 2 years for THIS season. <br>Fuck everything.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I feel your pain.</br></br>  <br>in the two years since then selfies became a thing and non non biyori can never show that photograph ever again</br>  <br>Having a season taking place a year later means that they will have to develop new character models and make them look older, and we know animes don't age.</br>  Candy Store when?  <br> things that have not been resolved. <br>Like what?</br></br>  <br>Now.</br>  <br> Anon finally gathers enough courage to go to the store and buy 4 different rulers (but not pink girly ones because that would be just too much) <br> Anon waits until everyone else in the household is either asleep or out working/living their lives <br> Anon cleans his table with great enthusiasm and sets up the rulers, smiling like a maniac, already looking forward to having a great time <br> Anon starts to play, shouting the names of the special attacks louder and louder every time <br> Anon's knees finally give in and he breaks down crying, collapsing onto the floor because he knows he'll never be 1/10th as happy as the Biyoris ever. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> selfies is a new thing <br><br>Underage detected.</br></br></br>  <br>Not him but it's almost like you don't even know what a joke is.</br>  <br> damage control </br>  <br>Nah, just come in and say, I need to measure a certain part of myself, I'm too embarrassed to tell you where. <br>Come in next day: yo that ruler wasn't big enough, got any bigger?<br>Repeat 2 more times. <br><br>End result: You on the left.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, literally not him, you're just stupid.</br>  <br>Ok, sameanon.</br>  <br> people backpedal this hard </br>  <br>It's not backpedaling if you're sticking to the same point.</br>  <br>Sure thing buddy maybe one day you will understand what a joke is and not make an ass of yourself.<br>I like that the guy who made the joke hasn't said jack shit. No, it's a bit annoying actually.</br></br>  <br> End result: My dreams come true <br>Is this really how it works?</br></br>  <br>Probably because he didn't say it as a joke and is too embarrassed to speak up or you're just pretending to be somebody else.</br>    <br>Well I did meet a 12 year old on here a few hours ago so you never know. </br>  <br>Or maybe it's because I said it as a joke I didn't want to argue just to receive "hurr damage control" in reply.</br>  I don't think we can go more lesbian than this scene  <br>The only thing more lesbian than that is 2 girls getting unashamedly married.</br>  <br>Liar!</br>  What happened to the vacation thing? You know, the OVA? Are they saving it for the final episodes?  <br>It's a shame such a body will be wasted on lesbian sex</br>  <br>It's been out.<br>I think I've watched it or I'm going crazy.</br></br>  <br>You know I can't prove it. Which is why I didn't want an argument. But I couldn't allow an innocent Anon to get insulted.<br><br>Of course, there's no way I can prove that it's two separate people and not a very elaborate ruse on my part. For all they know even you, the person I am replying to, is me. <br><br>Anyway, good night. Keep the Hotaruns warm.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look at the filenames, now neither of you know a joke. Literally every single image with an original screencap name since  was me.<br>Keep on your toes nigga.</br></br>  Why does Komari insist on being lewd constantly?  <br>The OVA ends with them taking off in the plane, we haven't seen the actual vacation.</br>  <br>nii-chan will bang that body</br>  <br>Its her subconscious attraction to Hotaru.</br>  What exactly does Hotaru's dad work with?

The vast majority of 10 years old have these tits.</br>  <br>They are quite common.

They can imitate humans quite well, plus the first t-1000 appeared in the second terminator movie and this is the second non-non biyori season. The line renge uses in that s2 announcement picture is also from the second terminator movie.</br></br></br></br>  Why is Natsumi so under-rated lads?<br><br>Is it because she knows how to ski?</br></br>  <br>Who is #5???</br>  <br>koshigaya yuuko</br>  After carrying the Koma one time she was driven to find a way to carry her all the time?  <br>how come it says "eraser" in english?</br>  <br>Its an eraser.<br>it erases things.</br></br>  <br><br>Because everyone in Japan is taught some English, so they sometimes use a little bit for everything.</br></br>  <br>she is my favourite.</br>  <br>Ah.

Most good SoLs have one, and I was sad we didn't get one last season.  <br>Nattsun is hella cute.</br>  <br>It's a tool for erasing!</br>  <br>is she underrated? she carries the show</br>  <br>And this is why the Koma plushies have big pink ovals on their cheeks.

Y'all cowards don't even sexualize renge-chon  This is one of the ugliest dogs I've ever seen.  <br>So's your mum.</br>  ep1 was not really up to par.<br>ep2 was much better, but still not as good as the first season used to be.<br><br>I'm glad we have more of this, but I also see why these stuff were left out in the first place.</br></br></br>  <br>Episode 1 was infinitely times better than 2 though.</br>  Sweet episode.  <br> renge being autistic <br> better than hotaruxkomari yuri action <br><br>nope, also better backgrounds this time</br></br></br></br>  Is the ruler game also common out of Japan?<br><br>I'm japanese and I also played ruler game when I was in elementally school.<br>Actually, "the eraser game" which is almost the same with ruler game was more popular in my school.</br></br></br>  <br>Hotaru's "Haaaaaaiii~" in response is arguably the single most wonderful sound ever produced by a human being.</br>  <br>Australian: I'd never heard of it before.<br>We played essentially a poor version of air hockey with stationary, though usually just played something sportier outside.</br></br>  <br>That's a strange thing to say when EP1 was better than the 2nd one.</br>  <br>I don't know. I'm from the UK and I'd never seen it before right now.</br>  <br>Hungarian here, never heard of it or played for that matter. In the 90's button football was the big fad amongst lower and middle class kids.</br>  <br>Reminds me of paper football.<br>But as an amerifat, I've never heard of it.</br></br>  <br>I've never played it before, but in school we played some similar, but more hardcore tabletop games like bloody knuckles. Goddamn, I don't miss that shit at all.</br>  <br>The other girls are fine but the comfiness goes off the scale in Renge centered episodes.</br>  <br>Wait, is the entirety of season 2 going to be set before the ending of s1?</br>    <br>Are you telling me everyone in Japan played the ruler game in school? I thought the joke was that it was a game for hicks out in the sticks.</br>  <br>It's like the endless eight of anime.</br>  Fucking captcha holy shit.    <br> bloody knuckles <br>I think I vaguely remember that. That's where you punch a desk until your knuckles turn red, right? How is that even a game again?</br></br>  <br> but not pink girly ones because that would be just too much <br><br>Nigga the people at the checkout counter don't give a shit what you're buying. For real. Standing for 8 hours a day wears them down enough.</br></br></br>  <br> How is that even a game again? <br>Kids are stupid.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it when you put your fist on the table and the other player flicks a coin across with his thumb and try to hit the knuckles? People tore their knuckles up playing that.</br>  Hotaru suddenly ask you for a **knock-down-the-ruler game**<br><br>What do you do?</br></br>  <br>No, it's when you and your buddy punch each others' fists until one of you gives up. Pretty stupid.</br>  http://strawpoll.me/4923618  <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood<wbr>y_knuckles</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>good times</br></br>  Reminder that NNB Repeat is a new continuity where Hotaru went back in time to try to stop them from taking the Okinawa trip, but she has temporary amnesia.  <br>because CR is secretly really good at typesetting but they don't want anyone to know.</br>   you will never be Hotaru so you can touch Koma-chan but also yourself   <br>Isn't Yuuko #12? It's the other high schooler, I think.</br>  <br>I'm mexican and I played it with erasers and coins in elementary school  also played it in high school when we were really bored </br>  <br>what!?</br>  <br>Play with her. What else?</br>    <br>I really wish they would just show renge parents since the sisters look nothing a like.</br>  <br>brown hair slut is who??</br>  <br>What do you mean? Renge and Hikanee have the same eyes.</br>  <br>Huh, I played a game called Bloody Knuckles at school, but it was different to this. You'd have to flick a coin from one side of the table to the other in 3 attempts or less so it was dangling over the edge. Then, you'd flick the coin up and if you caught it while it was in midair you'd get to shoot the coin into the other player's knuckles. <br><br>I had absolutely no skill but I played loads of times and never lost a game because I never quit, even if there was blood everywhere cause I was a fucking idiot when I was at school</br></br></br>  <br><br>The version we played was where you had three quarters, you would line them up in a triangle pattern and you had to shoot the closest one to you between the other two without knocking it off the table or hitting the other two, and the end goal was to get it into a "net" on the other side created by your opponent's index and pinky fingers. If you scored, you got to do  to your opponent. Fucking shit hurt like a bitch too.</br></br>  <br>I played this game at school as well, but we called it 'Coiny' and you won by shooting the closest one to you through the other coins 3 times in a row. Used to play it with these heptagonal fucks as well to make it harder to win and way more painful to lose</br>  <br> tfw you'll never be a little girl who loves other little girls </br>    <br>SHORYUKEN</br>  Repeat beach ep when  <br>Have they really shrunk her breasts for this season?</br>  <br>It seems like it but we can't be sure.</br>  <br><br><br>none of this is objective because she is not in a swimsuit<br><br>also you wouldn't an 11 year old.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Of course not, she's gay.</br>  <br>How do you get a watermelon inside a ball?</br>  post your face during the knock the ruler game /a/. pic related, that shit was intense    <br>I would of when I was 11.</br>  <br> Nattsun #5 <br>Why are nips allowed to vote on anything?</br></br>  Yeah this episode was fucking great, I thought the first was fine but that Ruler game is classic NNB which makes it so enjoyable and Komari trying to be the cutest senpai.<br><br><br>hnnnng, Truly is the best SoL.</br></br></br>  <br>There is no try.</br>  <br>im at this part right now!</br>  So, is the reason why the new season is backtracking on material it skipped in season one is because there's not enough material to continue where it left off?  <br>There's enough, even yesterday's episode takes place after what happened in the first season in the manga, it's not something they skipped.<br><br>They just don't want to make them look a year older, so they're just adapting it pretending it takes place in the same year.</br></br></br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>It's not a waste!

It's also possible they are adding content to the episode now that they have more time and it's still in an unfinished state.</br>    I wonder why I didn't fucking watch this last season. No fucking wonder so many goddamn people said it had the best OST of the season. <br><br>The show so far has been really good. I fear that this show gets way too popular (since it is getting dubbed and whatnot), and that /a/ will start hating it like KLK. And don't you fucking deny it. When the show aired the threads were full of fags extolling the show, and once it got ridiculously popular /a/ hated it because "muh newfags."</br></br>   this OST <br>It's tracks like "Call You Later" that make my day a little brighter.</br>  Hopefully the OST will keep me alive until ep 12 finally airs  Back to Back Raw<br><br>http://marumaru.in/b/origin/94140<br><br>Half Life 3 Confirmed To Be Skipped</br></br></br></br>   Call You Later    Sidewinder   <br> and that /a/ will start hating it like KLK. <br>Too late. /a/ is calling it fujoshit now.</br></br>  <br>What show doesn't /a/ call fujoshit?</br>  <br>Moeshit?</br>  <br>Whoa, thanks anon. Wasn't expecting it this early.</br>  Illustration from the new chapter. I won't have time to actually sit down and read it until later but just from skimming through the pictures, it looks like  Zapp throws a suitcase with the president's head into Leo's apartment?  It was also surprisingly short for a quarterly chapter. It's like half as long as his old quarterly chapters, not sure what's up with that.  It's already out? Damn, thanks for the reminder anon.<br><br>Too bad we lost all the hype on here. Can't reallt blame /a/ though, especially after this cock-tease ep 11 ending.<br>Oh well, at least the ost will help me suffer through those days/weeks/ m-months? ;_;  <br><br><br>"It's magic" is just too good. 2groovy4me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Potus   got decaptated, now it's up to  LEO  to put him back together </br>  So if I wanted to start reading Back 2 Back, could I just read volume 10 or are any of the episodic chapters in 2-9 important other than what the anime covered?  <br>Plotwise, no, not really.<br><br>You'd be missing a hell of character building though.</br></br></br>  <br> In The City <br> It's Magic <br> Hands On <br> Starbow <br> Early Train <br><br>I was sure as fuck waiting for this day to arrive.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well I'd definitely go back and read them, it's just way too text-heavy to get through all ten volumes when B2B raws are staring me in the face. Figured I'd just read 10 now so I don't need to worry about spoilers.</br>   Call you later <br> It's magic <br> Catch me if you can <br>Fuck, I actually feel bad for torrenting it right now, shit's just way too good.<br><br> S2 never </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please let this lead to a Futurama-like development with talking heads in fishtanks.</br>  <br>Amazing! Thanks so much for sharing!</br>  <br>There's a new character introduced in volume 8 and it also shows a little bit of what happened in New York from 3 years ago, and in volume 7 it brings up the fact that  Leo's eyes start to steam/burn when he over-uses them  although that's not super important so much as it probably looks confusing if you don't know about it. You won't miss anything really big, but bits and pieces of the world get filled out gradually, like showing you KK's family or Chain's werewolf gang. It's probably fine as long as you go back and read it later though. Volume 10 is probably the most important for having the biggest character-focused arc and filling in some of the details about the god eyes.</br>   10. Attack The System   07. Call You Later  <br> a new character introduced in volume 8 <br>Who? Doctor?</br></br>  Retard post here, where's the ED song?   On My Own <br><br><br><br>It's on Nyaa.</br></br></br></br>  Thank god the most came early.  <br> Why is this thread so empty. <br>It is a thread about poor quality anime.</br></br>  <br>It's a thread about a god tier soundtrack unlike hibishit.</br>  Final episode fucking when though  <br>Yes.<br><br>I was thinking that the whole time.  Sometimes I wonder if the author ever watched that show what with the alien New York setting and Zapp being almost exactly Bender. </br></br></br>  If the last episode sucks at least we have this good soundtrack. I might want to buy a physical copy.   ost sounds exactly like the stuff Sawano used to do back when Sawano was good    At The Gates <br><br>Oh wow I just got Heat Guy J flashbacks.</br></br>  LIFE IS WORTH LIVING AGAIN  This will be the perfect thing to listen to while I finish reading Trigun.  <br>Decide on one thing already, you bue faggot.</br>  <br><br>Can't read moon but it seems   Leo's task is to bring the president's head to the hospital to have it stitched back to his body while dodging crazy asshole trying to stop him  Looks bombastic but I agree with anon above it's quite short.</br></br>  Is Taisei Iwasaki the new Yoko Kanno?  <br>Nightow was having too much fun watching Matsumoto's anime to draw more.</br>  <br>He doesn't plagiarize his shit does he?</br>  <br>Depends on how many people he's sampling from.</br>  OST of the fucking year.<br>It would take something elder god tier to even go against this.</br>  <br>He sure is impressively diverse, and the special made it sound like he really thinks about the show when he's composing music for it. I'm eager to hunt down some of his other soundtracks now.</br>  What are the chances of anyone translating the first Back2Back chapter?   Starbow <br>Beautiful. I'd love to hear an extended version of this layered with field recordings of Manhattan at 4 in the morning.</br>   On my own <br><br>Yes, the feels are still overwhelming.</br></br>  <br>Too soon.</br>  To be honest, my hype for the eventual finale was waning, but now I'll never be not hype. I'm only on track 9, but everything is so fucking good.<br><br>Thank you based Iwaski. I knew you would deliver.</br></br>   tfw no sonic in the new chapter <br>I wonder if the anime designs influenced him at all or if it's just the quarterly schedule, but the characters look very slightly different somehow. Leo's hair looks a little fluffier for one thing, and did Zed get a new outfit?<br><br><br>I guess he was busy with the promotional stuff like the mini-chapters and the light novel illustrations and the blu-ray covers. Hopefully the next chapter is a little longer.<br><br>Likely, since multiple moon-readers post in the threads. I'm not good enough to translate the whole thing but I got the general gist and could maybe do a loose summary tomorrow if no one else has stepped up by then. But I would definitely appreciate dialogue translations.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Very good actually; I'm doing it right now. <br>Don't expect a full draft until I finish my volume 10 corrections, but I don't expect those will take more than another day or two.<br><br><br>This is a brilliant idea and if there are any soundmixer anons in this thread I will personally translate a doujinshi of your choice if you make a track like this and post it here.</br></br></br></br></br>  My guess for the short chapter is so it'll fit in the next volume. We've already got three extra chapters from WSJ and SJ, plus that short one from SQ.19 an anon translated. This plus the next chapter should just be enough to make volume 11 (or 1 if he restarts under the new name).    <br> did Zed get a new outfit? <br><br>He definitely did. He has sleeves now, and it looks like there's a cutout in the back of his shirt too.</br></br></br>   the entirety of Disc 2 <br><br>Holy FUCK.<br>This is so good, I love literally every track.<br><br>Also, there is some stuff that I have never heard before that sounds really great. Is it possible they just never included it or is the finale going to be extremely good?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So, next chapter in October and volume 11 by Christmas? Sounds like a plan.</br>  <br>I could do it myself but I have no field recordings of Manhattan at 4 in the morning and I'd only be able to loop parts of the song to extend it.</br>   footloose   <br>Zed's gone FULL NIGHTOW. <br><br> i'm going to lick that back cutout </br></br></br>  CRUIIISIIIING  <br>Zed O'Brien a slut now<br><br>A manslut<br><br>Huge manfishslut</br></br></br></br></br>   Call You Later <br>WHERE THE FUCK IS THAT AWESOME BASS INTRO</br>   A Way Out <br><br>GOTTA FIND A NEW ATTITUDE<br>IF YOU WANNA <br>GET OUT<br><br>This shit is funky as fuck.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Call You Later   <br>This song is fucking amazing but... what episode is it even in?</br>  Last Kekpisode when?  <br>May as well make it a fucking movie at this point.</br>   United   <br>Well I think they aren't airing it on TV because it is going to be much longer than a normal episode.<br><br>So, extended OVA type thing?</br></br></br>  <br>When the OST tops the Oricon Charts.</br>   amazing soundtrack <br> show barely uses it <br>Every fucking time.

These were memorable enough that I can tell you where nearly all of them came from without even putting the episodes on to check.<br><br>1．Catch Me If You Can<br>Episode 2, when Chain is following the blood fuse.<br><br>2．A Way Out<br>Unused, but there might have been an instrumental version played at some point; I seem to remember it during a battle scene.<br><br>3．World Goes Round<br>Episode 3, hospital scene near the end.<br><br>4．On My Own<br>Unforgettable.<br><br>5．In The City<br>Episode 6, very beginning.<br><br>6．The Land of Nod<br>Unused.<br><br>7．Dust<br>Episode 4, after the battle with the Blood Breeds.<br><br>8．Just A Game<br>Don't remember, but it's definitely been used.<br><br>9．BCCGS<br>Used all over the place, I think the first time is during the Libra member introductions during the episode 2 pre-credits.<br><br>10．It's Magic<br>Episode 5, in the scenes with White.<br><br>11．At The Gates<br>Episode 3 at the Don's place, and episode 4 when Abrams is talking about Blood Breeds.<br><br>12．Epi femen dife a<br>Episode 8. Master's battle music.<br><br>13．Epigraph<br>Unused. Sounds like the kind of thing we can expect to hear in episode 12, though.<br><br>14．World Goes Round(Reprise)<br>This has been used before, I just can't remember where.<br><br>15．White Gloves<br>Shows up in a lot of scenes with the twins. Vocal version was definitely used in episode 11 and possibly other places.<br><br>16．Hello,world! !(TV size version)<br>OP</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   on my own   <br>So, Zapp, huh. Didn't see that coming.<br><br><br>We discussed this just here </br></br></br></br>  So I definitely wasn't expecting the chapter to get leaked so soon but it's a little late for me to start a dump. I could either dump chapter 4 tomorrow, or I could dump it together with chapter 5 on Friday or Saturday like I originally intended.<br>I might also try to typeset the new chapter once I'm done with 4 and 5, assuming there is a translation by then. And I'll even break my no leveling rule since that scan quality looks like ass.<br><br>New suit.</br></br></br>   On My Own <br> World Goes Round <br><br>This soundtrack is pure bliss</br></br></br>  <br>The Land of Nod was used in Episode 6 when Gregor (the blond guy) was talking to Leo wasn't it?</br>  <br> It is a thread about poor quality anime. </br>  <br>Well slap my ass, you're right. And when Zapp is watching Klaus punch guys out.<br>Nicely done.</br></br>  <br>Remember "paging Dr. Bender" in episode 5? It's definitely possible.</br>  <br><br>Thanks anon! it's nice to see the manga worked on since the anime would be ending soon, whenever episode 12 airs.<br><br>On a side note, i'm so glad we have so much content today with the OST and the B2B chapter</br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like he's missing at least one. Unless that's just the OP</br>  Why does World Goes Round remind me so much of TWEWY  Epi femen dife a does things to my dick...      This entire OST, man.<br><br>I'd have trouble saying where most of this stuff was used because I'm usually focused more on the visuals, but goddamn.</br></br>  Does anyone know what song it was during Episode 5 while Aligura was flying through the air after getting punched? I can't seem to find it on the OST.  <br>The one in Jewish.</br>  They changed background composition on <br> 11．At The Gates <br>I'm so fucking sad, this OST may just burn now</br></br>  <br>full scan when</br>  <br>I want to see this too, but at least there are clearer pictures of it in the meantime.</br>  <br>Puppy got lucky.</br>  <br>I don't think it's on there. Neither is the one that plays during the preview for episode 9 or the one at the Libra office party in Blood Line Fever.</br>    <br>This is so much better than I thought it would be.</br>  <br> zed trying to get a good view of the action <br><br>I think I hear the sound of a thousand fan artists on twitter scrambling to draw that hat.<br><br> or the one at the Libra office party in Blood Line Fever. <br>The one that plays during the title or the one in the background when they're all drinking?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>corresponding Rockwell</br>  Is the track that plays when Brody and Doghammer destroy the giant mech thing in episode 5 not on this OST? I cant find it, and that was the track I was most looking forward to.  <br>Isn't it "Snap Out"?</br>  <br> pomf <br><br>What? How does this even work?</br></br></br>  <br>Awesome. What were the other two?</br>  <br>No, it's a slow song with a woman singing in English(?)</br>    <br>No, I think he means the song plays when the giant "car" of Aligura flying over the city.</br>  <br><br>Like a charm, that's how.</br></br>  <br>.</br>  <br>Song plays at :23 in this webm:<br><br>http://webm.host/27d03/</br></br></br>  <br><br>Thanks.

Looks like Beavis and Butthead.</br>  <br>Cheers, mate.</br>  <br>are the other characters ever shown in loli form?</br>  ...And we were all having a great time. Until these two faggots showed up.  <br>I hate people who like Keyshit manufactured drama. I couldn't stand Clannad. And people accuse Okada for being to melodramatic.</br>  <br>Well Zero is better than everything from that garbage franchise</br>  <br>What's the difference here? Retarded SoL-drama moeshit fags will start flooding this anime's threads come fall with their newfagginess. They will be watching solely because of Nagai-Okada and it will be their first Gundam. Those threads will be a fucking mess. Literally ToraHana fags all over the place. "Oh man when are they going to get to the romance drama?" "FUCK MAN, THESE FEELS ARE TOO MUCH FOR ME, I'M CRYING HERE"<br><br>It's going to be fucking hell</br></br></br>  <br> 00 had fantastic art, plot, character development and pacing, saying it was bad is just objectively wrong. You may not have enjoyed it personally, but it was well done. <br><br>You saying so doesn't make it so buddy.

The first word I added was 堂々 because I didn't know the kanji 堂. Now, 9 months later, I see *so few* new kanji that I am ended the plan and now adding pretty much any word that I struggled with reading. For instance I know the kanji in 昆虫 but I failed to sight-read it. So yeah. In my experiences, it took 15~ months before I didn't see any new kanji. In this time I read 5 VNs and a couple of manga series, which his not a lot, but I imagine anyone else  with a job  would also find themselves reading lethargically. Well that's all folks.<br><br>P.S. I recently saw 蟷螂の斧 which had 3 new kanji in a single phrase, however I opted not to learn it because the effort expenditure vs reward was far too low. There are exceptions like this everywhere.</br></br>  <br>From where is that image if i may ask.<br>It looks pretty useful.</br></br>  <br>http://www.mediafire.com/view/bizq3<wbr>79k4oeig2d/fora.pdf</wbr></br>  <br> 592 learn <br><br>is this normal? do I need to seriously step up my pace?</br></br></br>  <br>Thank you.</br>  What's his name again?  <br>Compared to other shows we've had it's really not that bad at all. Like the plot in E7:AO that failed to even have a conflict in it and was just random fucking occurrences for most of the show that was concluded with a literal plot reset cannon.</br>  Wako a shit.  <br>apple balls</br>  <br>Monochrome is the best miko song. The rest need not apply.</br>  kiss her through the glass</blockquote>]
