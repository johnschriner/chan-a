Anything else cute is good too, thank you.  I would like to request a drawing of Mai Natsume. Anything would be appreciated, though I'd be interested in a drawing of Mai carrying a box with her chest resting on it. Something similar to this for example:<br>https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/19<wbr>55852<br><br>Alternatively, I would like to see her in a bikini (preferably the one depicted in the top right of the reference image) at the beach, lying on her back on a towel and sunning herself. Something along the lines of this perhaps:<br>https://danbooru.donmai.us/posts/20<wbr>26126</wbr></br></br></br></wbr></br>  Requesting Rias dressed as a Lilim. Thanks and have a nice weekend.

Josuke would've been OP against him, Giovanna too.</br>  <br>holy fuck didn't see that one</br>  <br> you will never read BrBr's Booze Adventure </br>  I want Star Platinum to ora ora my ass. I want him to star finger inside me. I love Star Platinum so much. I want him to ram his gigantic fist up my ass. I want his gigantic arms around me. Star Platinum is the most amazing stand ever created. I wish to have sexual intercourse with him. Star Platinum is more beautiful that women to me, Star Platinum is more inspiring than men to me. Star Platinum is wonderful. My emotions toward Star Platinum are stronger than one thousand projectile-vomit powered boats. My love for Star Platinum is stronger than Pucci's gravitational force. Star Platinum should be the new mascot of the whole series. Star Platinum should be the new mascot for Shonen Jump. Star Platinum is the most beautiful stand and it should be law that every stand user has him, even Tsurugi Higashikata. <br><br>I want Star Platinum to METEOR FINGER my ass, I want him to Time Stop inside me, I want to feel his A rank precision, I want him to peruse my ass, I want him to mMeteor Finger Thorn my back, I want him to Ora Ora me. Hard. Harder than ever. I want it. I want Star Platinum. I want him in a Stand Disc. I want</br></br>  <br>I know Crazy Diamond is a generally strong stand with a useful ability but what makes you think he would have been OP specifically against Pucci?</br>  <br>He probably thinks that he can change his stand back into original form or separate pucci from the baby</br>  <br>Crazy Diamond would basically nullify C-Moon inside out ability but I don't know how he would be any useful against the other two Pucci stands</br>  <br>He can fix spaghetti, he can fix Pucci.</br>  <br>Gives Pucci his fucked up foot back, now he's slower</br>   Pucci underestimating Jolyne <br> even after DIO told him not to hold back against Joestars <br><br>fucking dumbass</br></br></br>    <br>Part 4 is the best. Nice warm feel.</br>  <br>Part 4 reminds me of life in my home town. Of my high school friends and youth.</br>  <br>When did he underestimate her? I honestly don't remember , I do remember when Donatello was underestimating her and Pucci told him it was a mistake. A lot if time Jolynes gang hand a advantage over Pucci but Fate was always on his side.</br>  <br> When did he underestimate her? <br>I dont remember which chapter but he berates himself for not killing Jolyne after getting Jotaro's memories</br></br>  <br> Crazy Dimond <br> Jonathan the esplorer <br> Polly and Kujo zefu </br></br></br>  <br>I think you know what you're talking about but I'd have to reread to be sure. Was pucci always planning on killing the kujos or did he just decide after they caused him so much trouble. He was using jolyne to get to Jotaro at first so he probably only saw her as a tool and he took out Jotaro. Other then that the only time I can say he fucked up is by deactivated MiH to finish off Emporio and reactivating it in ghost room with all the oxygen. He was so close to winning.</br>  <br>I don't think he ever planned on killing them until Kennedy space center, actually. Even that memory thing he left in Donatello just told her to go spend time with her family and not to follow him. He was always more focused on heaven than the Joestars.</br>  <br>Tomatoes were broken and pasta was boiled to make that spaghetti among other things. Pucci's foot was always like that from the beginning. There's nothing to restore.</br>   JoJo no Thread <br>I can't believe I started a new meme</br>  Is Giorno truly invincible? Can nothing touch him anymore post arrow?  <br>The arrow fell out, so no.</br>  <br> post arrow <br>K</br></br>  <br><br>I'm talking about GER Giorno. how does its ability exactly work?</br></br>  <br>Thanks boss.</br>  Your favorite Jojo uses your favorite Stand to fight your favorite villain. How much ass is kicked?  <br>Nobody said to post the bow.</br>  <br><br>You're gonna stay in this thread gay priest, you won't make it to the next one!</br></br>  <br>Good luck with that</br>  <br><br>Which time? He was stabbed/cut 7 times with the arrow.</br></br>  <br>You know there are new scans for Part 5 right?</br>  <br>You posted a kujo. Fate decided that they're useless against Pucci.</br>  <br>I meant GER</br>      <br>Why would Dio put a flesh bud into someone who is already loyal? He didn't do that with Vanilla Ice or Gay Priest.<br> 0/10 </br></br>      <br>is there one with Doppio and Abbacchio?</br>    <br><br>Just post the full photo, quality isn't lost on 4chan.<br><br><br>There might be one on doc's album.</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Thanks anon</br>  <br> Why would Dio put a flesh bud into someone who is already loyal? He didn't do that with Vanilla Ice or Gay Priest. <br> I have no idea who Enya is. </br></br>  Waiting everyday for part 4 anime  So one oy my firends finally finished Part 2, and got into part 3, and asked me if he stone on Joseph's collar in SC is supposed to be the stone of Aja.<br><br> I hadn't even noticed there was a gemstone on his color to begin with </br></br>  <br>Ice was gay for DIO and Pucci was his fuccboi. Enya was just some old hag you can't trust old people.</br>    <br>this is fucking hilarious i don't care if it's a shit meme</br>  <br> 4 hair swirlies <br>0/10 costume you suck kid</br></br>  <br>Is this from the new Prison School chapter?</br>  <br> is this from the new prison school chapter. </br>  <br>explain this meme please<br><br><br><br>it's been out for a while</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not a meme. I just didn't want to dip into my Pucci_.png folder.</br>  <br>ok i was thinking that it meant Dio had been shitting in the bathroom  metaphor for shitposting  or that he spend so much time in the bathroom or  closet  that he hadn't seen anything in a while like that anon not knowing the picture had been out for a while  unless he was shitposting </br>  <br>You can take it that way. It's not a meme yet but I you wanna start using it go ahead.</br>  <br> like that anon not knowing the picture had been out for a while   unless he was shitposting <br>I wasn't, i started reading Prison School today</br></br>  <br>yeah i dind't mean to falsley implicate you sorry<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=LI4<wbr>IxGK4vRI</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>honestly this combination is just bad, but i like it for some reason but it's very confusing to listen to, the songs just clash too much. this coming from someone who unironically likes all star</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Beautiful</br>  <br>That is pretty disappointing considering it was made by the guy who created things like https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jwh<wbr>jqdSPw5g</wbr>  [ ] and https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=rCS<wbr>ytPi8e5U</wbr>  [ ] (my favorite mash-up)</br>   tfw part 8 jojo could have been Josefumi <br> Kira could have been his brojo <br><br>Seriously who is Gappys brojo? Will it be Karera or does he just not have one <br><br>We're already on chapter 50 and he's usually just alone and hangs around with a different character for a few chapters <br><br> yfw Araki splits Gappy back into Kira and Josefumi halfway through part 8 <br><br>Kiras dead though so yeah that won't happen</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's obviously fucking Yasuho, and maybe Daiya and Tsurugi</br>  <br>It's Yasuho you dumb fuck. Just because she's the love interest as well doesn't disqualify her.</br>  <br>Yasuho seems more like a love interest, and if you think it could be Daiya that's like saying it could be Joshuu</br>  <br>They're so close as friends that she might as well be the Brojo and the main love interest, unlike girls like Erina and Suzie Q, who aren't as big of mutual friends with their JoJos as Yasuho is with hers.</br>  <br>It could be if that antisocial fuck lightens up.<br><br>I wonder what he and Jobin are up too</br></br></br>  <br>this'll be good because we've essentially gotten rid of a worthless character role by combining it with a useful character role</br>    Why does Daiya look like the Tree Girl?<br><br>Also am I the only one that likes her a lot?<br> I just now noticed this fucking panty shot, fucking Araki God damn </br></br></br>  <br>I don't think it's that they weren't friends with their guys, it's just that for the most part any love interest in the past didn't have powers or anything, so we don't really get to see them interact much because the plot usually revolved around fighting the bad guys. And hell, at least we got to see Erina and Jonathan having a montage of enjoying each other's company, even if that was pretty much part of the courting process.<br><br>Well, unless you count annasui, but why the hell would anyone ever count him?</br></br></br>  <br>it makes me wonder if the "2 navals thing" will ever come up as anything important  most likely not but it would be really cool if old man sbr norisuke was a combination of 2 people also but i don't think araki would ever plan that far ahead</br>  <br>because if you don't he'll fucking murderape you unless your name is jolyne</br>  <br>Norisuke having two navels sets off alarms for me as well. I have more faith in araki than you though, I don't think he'd throw that out there for no reason.</br>  <br>Anassui just had an obsession with her, that paid ff because he helped out a lot and really just wanted to make her happy.<br><br>I was really glad when she kept her promise of marrying him in the new universe, that was nice</br></br></br>  <br>Speaking of that, my favorite panels will always be the ones where Anassui and Weather meet those two girls and one of them asks "Are you two murderers or something?" And Weather answers with "I'm not, but he is!" It was hilarious.<br>[spoiler[Especially because at that point Weather was more scary and fucked up than Mr. Cut up his girlfriend and her lover would ever be.</br></br>  Am I the only one that actually liked the MiH chapters of part 6? I see a lot of other people put off 6 because everyone dies, but at the end of every part so far we get someone with a deadly, super strong god-like stand that's somehow defeated by their own stupidity and I liked that Araki finally followed through with it for once instead of just killing off a brojo and having then having the villain get defeated somehow.  When you think about it, Yasuho is a much better example of a relatively normal girl who learns to find her own power within herself and control it than Trish.  Jolyne isn't exactly normal with her criminal history and all. <br><br><br>No, you're most definitely not the only one.</br></br></br>  <br>I feel bad when people are put off with part 6 as their least favorite part and some even hate it. MiH was great for reasons just as you said. A lot people will say emporio killing pucci is an asspull but it was pucci fucking up that let that happen. He's the only villian to successfully kill two jojo's and their brojos. C-moon was a cool almost scary stand but MiH was a monster that none of then could beat unless Pucci himself messed up. People tend to hate on 6 cause they don't understand how MiH works and they think everything from parts 1-6 is meaningless and thats a shitty reason.</br>  <br>Kek I forgot about that. I assume that was after he  regained his memories? Or am I mistaken <br><br>Also, ctrl+s is your friend, just found out about it last week</br></br></br>  <br>Weather Report the stand killing pucci isn't an asspull because it had already been demonstrated that both pucci and weather had OP as fuck stands. If I had to pick a part i liked least it would be parts 5 or 6 but it's not a clear loss, I like all the parts a lot.</br>  <br>I thought it was kind of an asspull because WR was on star finger levels of 'can do whatever Araki needs at the moment'.</br>  <br> Yes it was after he got back his memories, Donatello was an idiot </br>  <br>Weather report made sense atleast with stuff that wasn't heavy weather. Anything else it did was weather related. Star finger made no fucking sense. In the anime I was expecting them to have SP get into a fingering contest with the world.</br>  <br>The fuck does weather have to do with pure oxygen?</br>  <br>Emporio explains it but I forgot.</br>  <br>Oxygen is in the air, he just filled ghost room up with oxygen when pucci was speeding up time and that's what fucked him up.</br>  So did Emporio keep Weather Report after killing Pucci? Hell will he ever use his original stand again, since he can only go into the room in the prison?  <br>Yes he should still have weather report and be able to use his ghost room. Whitesnake ignores the one stand per person rule since he was able to give FF another stand ability that fucked her up.</br>  <br>The bus was too late</br>  <br>huh<br>i wonder if that has any significance</br></br>  <br>anti-meme posting is still shitty memeposting<br><br>KEKEKEKEKEKEKEKE HAI spiggy give me your best image</br></br></br>  <br>Oh shit<br><br>Well if it was, he should've just used it to 1 shot bad guys , but i guess he's not the overly violent type.</br></br></br>  <br>Originally thought it was Joshuu but he seems to be a caesar-dio type rival, the brojo is yasuho</br>  <br>I wonder if that was his intention - either he felt like making a shitty meme video and did that for whatever reasons, or people kept requesting him to make said shitty meme video so he made it terrible out of spite</br>  <br>Gay Priest had left hours ago to other memes.You failed, shitty bus.</br>  <br>wow i never noticed that either<br>i know sugar mountain had a lot of panty shots too</br></br>  <br>Please learn what an asspull is, you sound like one of those people who says cuck constantly</br>  <br> cuck  <br>Don't go bringing /tv/, /pol/,/v/ buzzwords here.</br></br>  <br>I'll make more of these sooner or later</br>  <br>Why.</br>  <br>Don't. Keep the thread slow and steady.</br>  <br><br><br>Emphasis on later</br></br></br>  <br>i want sugar mountain to squat over my face<br>i'll bet her ass smells great</br></br>  <br>50 year old ass that she pulls random things out of.</br>  <br>only 50 in spirit<br>i want her to squish my face with her ass</br></br>    <br>Saved for shitposting purposes</br>  Since Valentine wanted offspring, do you think it's possible that the guy from the flashback in JoJolion really could be related to him?  <br>You can do better anon...</br>  <br>Nice theory</br>  HOTPANTS<br>O<br>T<br>P<br>A<br>N<br>T<br>S</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  If Stone Ocean doesn't have Styx's Renegade as the ED I will cry<br><br> Not like it matters since it won't be adapted to anime <br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/ZXhuso4OTG4  [ ]</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally engaging in sex only for the purpose of children <br>kek</br></br>  <br>But Kekloin was dead when Jolyene was born</br>  <br>Has slow points for the more emotional episodes<br>Has high speed high octane for mid fight to be continued's<br>I approve. Additionally, the lyrics fit, especially considering the running from the law.</br></br></br>  <br>But that won't work, because Come Sail Away will be used for Part 7's ED, and you can't do double Styx</br>  <br>Is there anything more nothing than her death in SBR? I had to go back after finishing to find out what happened to her since no one noticed her death and the action moved into high gear with the President fight.</br>  <br>I seriously thought she was fine up until the end, just too hurt to keep on fighting.<br><br>Whoops.</br></br></br>  <br>It's funny because some people didn't know that she died.</br>  <br>What. I do not remember her dying at all</br>  <br>What if this Renegade song is the EP?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=6tu<wbr>4wWSbnIs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> Gold Experience gets stabbed with an Arrow here <br> literally just damage <br> Giorno stabs GE with an Arrow later <br> becomes the most OP shit of all time <br><br>God dammit Araki</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not the band Renegade, the song by Styx. That song wouldn't fit the song's style at all.</br>  <br>*series style, I mean</br>  DEAD H・P<br>E<br>A<br>D<br><br>H<br>・<br>P</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>X Ambassadors is the name of the band, Renegade is the name of their shitty song.</br>  So this is only tangentially related but I feel like this would be a good place to ask.<br><br> Where the hell do I find a SOUL'd OUT download? </br></br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, after the President fight, they moved on to fighting Dio (which was confusing) with ZA WARUDO powers (which was doubly confusing), so I kept expecting Hotpants to show up, but she never did.</br></br></br>  <br>Well I had it figured out by the time Steven, Lucy, and Johnny were together and nobody seemed to care about Hot Pants. Which is kind of weird because I don't think any of those 3 were there for her death.</br>  <br>Actually, did Valentine list Hot Pants in his little speech about all the people he could bring back? I don't remember off the top of my head. If he didn't, well that explains why everyone was confused.</br>  <br>Only 2 SOUL'd OUT songs were used in the MADs the rest are Diggy Mo solo stuff. They can be a bit of a pain in the ass to find since his lable has gone on this massive crusade taking them down all over the place. Anyway pretty much all SO albums are on Nyaa. And everything for Diggy Mo except Diggyism 2 is at the same place.</br>  2 new Part 5 chapters went up<br> Vol.52 Ch.488: The Grateful Dead - Part 1 <br> Vol.52 Ch.487: The Firenze-Bound Super Express - Part 2 </br></br>  <br>I just read them, I loved seeing my favoritte part 5 in high quality.</br>  <br> favoritte part 5 fight*</br>  Who wants to bet that Karera is this universes Yukako?  <br> hair user <br> hair user <br><br>hmmmmmmmmm</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, she's Karera.</br>  <br>Who is the result of Yukako being carried over to the new universe by HEAVEN</br>  <br>Nah, it's not the same world. It's just referencing.<br><br>While we're on the subject she references Kars and Giorno a lot too.</br></br></br>  <br> carried over to the new universe by HEAVEN <br>The SBR universe is not linked to the old universe. ESPECIALLY not through Made in Heaven. Stop it.</br></br>  <br> Stop it. <br>Okay.</br></br>  <br>The villain doesn't even matter because just imagining Joseph with Osiris brought me to orgasm. Regardless though:<br><br> Joseph with Osiris vs. Kira <br>The most extreme match of poker in the entire world.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> brandy brendo <br> polly <br> power to control stand <br> aristacrat </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is she asking Rohan this?</br>  <br> getting out of my chair to make myself some dinner <br> Read the first sentence of this post <br> mfw </br></br></br>  hey can one of you kind anons seed part 1 &amp; 2 for me?  <br>She's Kars</br>  <br>What I find surprising is joining these threads and finding out people hated part 6 and loved part 5.<br>I'm of the complete opposite opinion.</br></br>  Just looked at the calendar and saw the release of SC Vol.4 Blurays was just a few days ago. How long do we have to wait until they're up for torrenting?  <br>I got my copy yesterday but I have no BD ripper. Somestuffs will get around to them eventually.</br>  <br>Fair enough, I can wait a while.</br>  <br> She's Kars <br>Literally how?</br></br>  MC confirmed for going edgelord?  Could he be the next  Dark Flame Masta?   <br>Why does Charlotte look so lewd there?</br>  He already was when he sent a car flying at a girl he loved.  <br>She wants his spaghetti sauce.</br>  <br><br>no, it's the next death note.<br><br>in that the MC starts out OK but will turn out to an autistic faggot, and the show starts out compelling but the rides all down hill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It wasn't very compelling to begin with. But I hope he doesn't get too edgy.</br>  <br>This is a chuuni show. It will get edgy.</br>  Are you sure that's not MC's lost brother who also Nao's benefactor?  <br>Bane?</br>  <br>Are you blind?</br>  When do they fuck?  <br>Maybe?<br><br>Stop. It's Nao. Otherwise, she clearly wants to  dominate  Yuu.<br><br>I'm not sure how to point out the differences, but that's not long lost bro.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> MC-kun reaching for dat ass. <br><br>Sooner than you'd think.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair he didn´t exactly "start out ok". He has no problems with endangering people or using them for his plans. If he can find a way to one-up Nao he probably will.</br>  Two chapters left until imouto dies.<br><br>Praise Maeda.</br></br>  <br>He's gotten a faceful of  probably A-cup  boobs already. He needs to chill.</br>  <br>He probably wants the whole deal asap. He´s greedy like that. I dunno if he even finds her attractive, though.</br>  <br>I can't wait to watch /a/ explode if there is imouto suffering. I don't even like imouto suffering, it's just hilarious how otaku pull out hairs over it.</br>  So at this point, we can confirm that the MC got his memories modified in some way.<br>He had a reaction when he heard Tomori's headphones. The episode is titled"The sound I once heard."<br>Maeda did say that the two pictures released a while back may not necessarily be chronologically left to right.</br></br>  <br> I dunno if he even finds her attractive, though <br>He found her cute in the 4-Koma.<br><br><br>You will never Charlotte's Charlottes</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>she'll get kidnapped and he'll look right into that pizza sauce and start crying. calling it.</br></br>  <br>Imouto's not going to die so early. If something is to happen to her, it would be in the last few episodes.</br>  <br>Yeah i heard some potential spoilers: <br>   He escaped from a research facility with his brother. <br>   The facility might be the same as the one where Nao was in. </br></br></br>  Confirmed for ending in a melodramatic tearjerker.<br>And people will defend it.</br>  <br>He's certainly softened around her quickly, that we can say.<br><br>Nao; we have no idea either.<br><br><br>Zhiend seems to be a really key element here. I wonder if they baited Nao's bro to come out into the open and get himself fucked over like so.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> we can confirm that the MC got his memories modified in some way. <br>How can you even confirmed something based on speculation?</br></br>  <br>We know what's probably coming, yet we're still watching it. Of course we're going to defend it.</br>  <br>There´s a 4koma? I didn´t know that.</br>  <br> I wonder if they baited Nao's bro to come out into the open <br>That makes no sense considering that many power users may not even listen to music at all.</br></br>  <br>There was a shitty scanlation for it. Go grab it.</br>  <br> Charlotte <br>/a/ can't be this retarded</br></br>  <br>Did you even watch the first episode?</br>  <br>You sure fun at parties. What next? You're going to call her Nao?</br>  <br>It's a maymay.</br>  <br>Bitch, what did you say about my boob size?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128792566 <br>Heard that a hundred times now. Anything other than that?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128792566 <br>Oh shiet, nice observation.</br>  <br>Yes. why don't you tell me which part that tells the MC memories being modified?<br>He just forgot about it, maybe amnesia? because fucking accident or something?<br><br>There's no confirmation that MC memories being 'MODIFIED'.<br><br>Did you even watch the first episode?

Retard?</br></br>  <br> Erased from their memories <br>That just them going amnesia from truck accident.

I don't need to be reminded that the show will become bad. I just want to enjoy the show while it still has momentum.</br>  <br><br>I came here expecting good discussion and hoping the BR google translate shitter would be asleep but looks like he's still awake and not banned yet.<br><br>Time to exit the thread and be sad about the state of these threads. Anime original series are supposed to have good discussion and speculation, not people taking random "spoilers" as facts and retards shitposting everywhere.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I need bleach.</br>  <br> Stop making analysis of things given to us by the creators on a board that discusses episodes and theories as they come out </br>  <br>He caught me off guard!</br>  <br>Why is Charlotte so soft?</br>   tfw we'll never see this in the show   slightly bigger  <br> another asshole commenting about side jokes and not contributing to the main topic at hand <br>/a/ isn't dead, just dying</br></br>  <br>Wait, who touched Nao? Is that you, Yuu?</br>  <br>Purple shirt alley dude did in episode 3</br>    <br>Dying?

Seriously, what was that even about, Nao? Did you just want a hug?</br>  <br>Getting decked in the face doesn't count.</br>  Your face when the pizza sauce is imouto's power.  <br>Is that the face that Nao makes when she's hungry? Did you guys forget to feed her in between episodes?</br>  <br>Just filter him out.</br>  So Tomori is confirmed to win the MCbowl?  <br> Power is that she can make Pizza sauce out of nowhere but it only works with Pizza sauce <br><br>Sounds perfect and defective as all the other powers</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly, I think it's better if we don't have a cheesy festival episode inn Charlotte and rather focus on the main plot for the second half.</br>  <br>No. I need my beach episode.</br>  <br>Ignoring the cancer wont make it go away, it only makes it worse.</br>  <br>True. After episode 5 there won't really be anymore time.<br><br> I honestly just like the getup. </br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128793304 <br>I think the guy in the lower right is either Yuu himself or his brother.</br>  <br><br>We don't need people pretending to be characters from the show yet. Please let the rest of us enjoy the show and characters before the role playing starts.</br></br>  Does anyone happen to have that edit of Nao lifting her leg up and it showing her panties? I believe it was an edit.  <br>Sure thing buddy. Just like that other albino "won" the MCbowl in Angel Beats.</br>  <br>Aww cmon it´s fun. Also we don´t really have a lot to discuss yet. Not enough info.</br>  <br>Save it for the ova. Nao better not try to skip out with a shorts and sweater get up  not that it would look bad </br>  <br>So it's like strong teasing but nothing concrete comes out of it?  I'm new to this formula. </br>  <br> Aww cmon <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>Ok... Just keep it to this thread for nao...</br>  <br> albino <br>Are you talking about Tenshi?<br>She did win. She was just too autistic to express her feelings.</br></br></br>  <br>I just wanted a sniff.</br>  <br>Only tears will come out of this series.</br>  <br><br>I hope it's not like that bullshit. My kokoro needs closure.</br></br>  <br>It's Maeda. He will pull a happy ending out of his ass if he has to.</br>  <br>She´s probably gonna die in his arms telling him she loves him or something. Prepare for suffering.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128793350 <br>Fuck man. Don't you ever go to sleep? Do you just get on /a/ catalog and control+f "Charlotte?"</br>  <br>I doubt Nao's gonna bite it, but broken? I'm sure that's fair game.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128793165 <br>What if MC and imouto aren't real siblings? Fake brother made MC believe imouto was his real sister to hide her from evil organization?</br>  <br><br>DON'T FUCK WITH MY HEART /A/. YOU TOLD ME PLASTIC MEMORIES WOULD HAVE AN ASSPULL. I'm not believing anything and staying simple minded.</br></br>  <br> implying its one person </br>  <br>That's actually plausible...</br>  <br>Maybe she´ll end up like her brother. Which i hope won´t happen. But there´s gonna be some sort of suffering.</br>  <br>Literally just thought of that. Fucking kill me.<br><br>Now that'd be touching, but basically that means that plan is going to go to hell.</br></br></br>  Please don't take Nao away from this world... We haven't even seen up her skirt yet  <br>Analysis is okay, you faggot. I never said it was bad, but that was only SPECULATION, you can't just spout IT WAS CONFIRMED like a faggot you are.<br><br>Just kill yourself already.</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe we should take her away faster then.</br>  <br>How autistic can you get?</br>  <br>Why /a/non, why ;_;</br>  <br> I'm an entitled piece of shit <br>Yes you are</br></br>  <br>To protect her dignity, you blubbering dog.</br>  <br>At least that guy knows he's wrong in this case. It was his added "faggot", "did you even watch..", "just kill yourself" that add my autism fuel.<br><br><br>Like that. What a mentality of a loser.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Her dignity didn't stop her from whoring herself to benefactor kun.</br>   The uploader has not made this video available in your country. <br>shiet.<br>HD preview where?

But now I regret it. Delete this immediately, anon.</br>  <br>Go be gay elsewhere.</br>  <br>If being gay will keep Nao the same food loving pure girl, then call me OP</br>  <br>Clearly she wears black.</br>  <br> doesn't want to deal with your autism <br> hurr durr I automatically won the argument <br><br>Notice how you're the only one sperging out over this?</br></br></br></br>  <br> someone would seriously cry about this series <br>This is only acceptable if you're crying about how bad it is.</br></br>  <br>Ignoring cancer doesn't make it go away in real life, but on /a/ it does. It's best not to communicate with his kind or they will think they win.

Need more Nao.</br>  <br>No, I mean in the photo notShiro took, can't find the pic right now.</br>  Somehow I don't think is some confession. Is he squeeing again over something?   you're coming with us if we win the baseball game busta. <br><br>Am I expecting too much from anime?<br>They talk about ebil experiments and the ebil goverment but then instead of just holding the fucker down and explaining him this shit they offer to play a game of baseball?<br><br>and he accepts????</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794109 <br>That's great. I think everyone understood this after the 10th time you posted it. We need something new.</br>  <br>No pan.</br>  <br>Yeah. Tell us more  about Sala , whatever..</br>  <br>I think MC would have noticed. And i don´t remember him passing out from all the blood rushing to a certain bodypart.</br>  <br>  <br>Who?</br></br>  <br>A. baseball dude<br>B.  Zhiend's supposed leader </br></br>  <br> implying anime makes sense </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794252 <br>Here we go with this shit again...</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794252 <br>Do you think if we start posting more pictures of Yuu, ESL will start copy pasta about him? Nvm, we already have eggman for that.</br>  <br>Speaking of making sense, you'd think that these guys would wear more comfortable clothes if they're camping out.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794308 <br> nut no moe <br>I've been on travles for a day, but did I miss something?</br></br>  <br>I'm sure the BBQ food they make won't magically orgasmic.</br>  <br>Just stop replying to that fucktard.</br>  <br>fuck. just ignore this. I hate trying to use my phone to brows /a/. I'll just go back to lurking</br>  Why is she so fat?  <br>I wish that they would just give one of the characters rabies or ebola or some shit and we would have a real story.<br><br> Oh you also have these powers? surely you are an ally <br><br>disgusting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794445 <br>I heard if you go into your bathroom, turn off the lights, and say Leluch 3 times looking into the mirror, Leluch V Britinia will command you to get the fuck off of this thread.</br>  <br>I think you mispelled healthy, anon. It´s ok it happens. And still flat as a board. </br>  <br>She's is trying to get rid of her cuteness but her metabolism is too high. We can help by feeding Nao.</br>  <br>Feed her semen, right?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794482 <br>That's a pretty cute name. Japan must really like her.</br>  <br>But them thighs and butt tho.</br>  <br>Did you just call me fat, asshole?</br>  <br>There is a special place in hell for people like you. Nao is too pure to be involved in your fantasies.</br>  <br>As an ass-man i´m perfectly ok with this.</br>  <br>Wasn't that scene when Nao wanted Yuu to get into the school tho?</br>  <br> loved <br><br>Yea, no. That wasn't love.</br></br></br>  <br>It's bullshit, yo.</br>  <br>Another man of reason on this board. I am pretty sure Key has a fetish for ass and thigh judging from their designs from the past anime and this.</br>  <br>A moe nut. That's cute</br>  <br> what is irony </br>  <br>Whenever i see a juicy ass it brings a tear to my eye. Key is truly leading people onto the right track.</br>  <br> Something /a/ rips apart </br>  <br>His google-translate-fu can't handle nip slang. Hell, it can't even handle english.<br><br>But I kind see where his retarded misunderstanding of "moe pig" came from.</br></br></br>  <br> moe pig <br>That's still pretty cute</br></br>  <br> Actual people that don't find those thighs gorgeous </br>  <br>"moe pig" as in "moeshitters".<br>It wasn't about Tomori.</br></br>  Who's that? Nao?  <br>I once used to enjoy only boobs and thought they were the shit. That was when I was a boy in elementary and middle school. Then high school came and that's where I became a man and learned the wonders of dat ass and company.</br>  <br>It's muh dick who's calling.</br>  What was the point of this experiment?  <br>Who was it about?</br>  <br>To test if people on imageboards will ask this question every single thread.<br><br>It was a success.</br></br></br>  <br>To see how much of a light weight Yuu is and how she will NTR him</br>  <br>About moeshitters. The line he pasted is about how Tomori doesn't appeal to moeshitters.</br>  <br>How come he couldn't control that guy but could take over photo guy?</br>  <br>Pay attention.</br>  <br>I imagine the last episode where someone fucks Nao and he takes over him while they are doing it.<br><br>Why can't we have nice things from this industry.</br></br></br>  <br>So we can determine that our favorite ESL isn't a cute Japanese girl jelous of Nao, but rather some sexually frustrated harry Brazilian man who wishes he had a Nao sex doll?</br>  RIP imouto, you and your pizza sauce will be missed  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Not really...</br>  <br>He's just parroting whatever bullshit he manages to google-translate from 2ch.</br>  <br>I'd like to say yes, but the pizza sauce changed my mind.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795216 <br>A man's gotta make a living</br>  <br>That's cool</br>  <br>Will there be a kissu or does Maeda not do that anymore?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795279 <br>Nao already has Yuu by the balls. Nao blue balled him in the manga.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795167 <br>Nice autist. The pic has zero spoilers about Charlotte's plot.</br>  <br>Why this show is so bad? i'm not even remember AB being this bad.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795767 <br>please no one reply</br>   TVアニメ「Charlotte（シャーロット）」 Original Soundtrackが11月4日発売！ <br><br>Fucking.</br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795767 <br>Yes. She is a mary sue, after all.</br>  The best.  We have a Charlotte thread on /pol/ right now  <br>More like MC confirmed for not MC at all. It's all about Nao being awesome and the only relevant character. MC is for funny pizza sauce scenes.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128796272 <br> le maymay froggie r9k  <br>kill self</br></br>  <br>I really don't know if /pol/ takes itself seriously anymore.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128795642 <br>So where I can listen to the radio?

The homolord actually thinks he's contributing by spamming the same desinformation over and over again in his broken english.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128794252 <br>The worst thing about ESL isn't that he's ESL oe even that he's a namefag. The worst part is that he's repetitive as fuck. You've beebn making the exact same post with the exact same images for the last 2 weeks ESL-kun. Get new fucking material or talk about something else.</br>  slightly bigger pics    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128798053 <br>I feel the MC's pain, man...</br>  Daym this is pathetic  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128798053 <br>We'll get some scene where imouto reveals that she also hates pizza sauce, but pretends for Yuu. Then imouto goes full coma or some shit.</br>  Can someone give me a plot summary? I heard there was mind control.  If you report him enough times he'll get banned eventually. The mods may even do us a favor and IP block his country or something.  <br> IP block his country or something. <br>Trust me, that's the worst. I never shitpost on /a/ but I got banned several times because some fucker from my country did.

With a Truck.<br><br>But the silly lass dumped him.</br></br></br>  <br> Because this isn't reddit and you don't get banned for being an annoying faggottron <br>So blatant shitposting is not against the rules, right?<br>Fuck off and kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Currently, on neo-/a/, shitposting means "things that hurt my feelings".<br><br>You are a big boy.

Nao doesn't know it yet, but benefactor-kun is actually evil. She will take Yuu and the other to him for help but everyone will end up getting captured.  this is just a theory and holds no merit   <br>I think everyone has guessed that</br>  <br>I don't mind Yuu going edgy as long as he and Nao don't get sperated by tragic-lovers-syndrome. Imagine in the last episode is everything was thrown out the window and Yuu became OP as hell, 20 minutes of him beating the crap out of bad guy and friends then blowing up their base, ending with him getting a bj from Nao. /a/ would forever hail him a hero or the biggest ass pull of the century  porbably both </br>  <br>Damn... I actually thought I was being original...  I'm serious </br>  <br><br>more if you look at the storyboards 5, it looks like she was beaten for not agreeing or not want obdecer the benefactor-kun orders</br></br>  <br> obdecer </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128805540 <br>Fuck off</br>  No new voices in the preview, right?  <br>Like, voice actors?</br>  <br>No, don't think so</br>  <br>Yeah, new VAs for new characters.<br><br>So I see. Thank you.</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128808295 <br>Please stop posting, you retarded spic. <br><br>The Nao shitposters are better than your indecipherable posts. <br><br> His mother not gave him education <br>What the fuck does this even mean. <br><br>Are you ban evading?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128808295 <br>How many people are you trying to drag down, asshole? And what does education have to with new voices?</br>   I`ll beat Shitobako <br> it`s the new Angel Beats <br> Maeda learned from mistakes! <br>they said</br></br></br>  <br>How about you finish the show before spewing shit</br>  <br>Least its better than Punchline and Classroom Crisis. Now thats was sitting in the mud.</br>  <br> finish the show <br>You think that`ll improve it? The opposite is true. It will go downhill rapidly past ep 6 and will end with rushed forced drama asspool magic ending.</br></br>  <br>How about you finish the show before spewing shit<br> though it's Key so I think you're right </br></br>  <br>Masks remind me of Zankyou no Terror.</br>  <br>Charlotte a cute.</br>  <br>would be the worst plot ever for 12 episodes</br>  <br><br>And then, what if, the facility was UNDERNEATH the school?</br></br>  <br>Is it the Majestic 12 base?</br>  <br>Nah. The facility has to be connected to the old boarding school.<br><br>Speaking of boarding school, how the hell did the government get to Mrs. Tomori to give her kids up? (you guys probably discussed this to death though)</br></br></br>  <br>Threats, most likely about the children's futures. They probably promised not harm the two.</br>  <br> how the hell did the government get to Mrs. Tomori to give her kids up? <br>Dunno breh, maybethey gave her something her family lacked?</br></br>  Episode 5 probably to take place in one afternoon/evening?  <br>And the morning after, I think. The shot of Yuu getting up with scratches on his face could be after he tried the song or something.</br>  So this week or next week it looks like we're entering the obligatory crying/serious portion of a Key work. Too bad I give far too little a shit about this cast for it to have any sort of impact.  I want to cum inside Nao-chan.  <br>Threads later, and MC still has dibs. Sorry anon.</br>  <br>She burns a lot of calories by getting beaten up all the time.</br>  <br>Jeez, that's cold.<br><br>Nice of everyone to stay for him.<br><br>I'm still bothered by a lack of loose clothes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually, I looked at the PV again, and it turns out I'm retarded</br>  <br>? What'd you spot?</br>  <br>I mean when he wakes up. It's daytime then, probably in the first day.</br>   Main girl has invisibility powers <br> doesn't use them to avoid getting beat up <br>Stupid bitch. I bet I could think of 100 things to do with invisibility and she would never have thought of them.</br></br>  <br>The first instance you could give a little leeway, since that was a nasty surprise.<br><br>The second? Could have tried to wriggle free from whoever that was in the PV.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Also she started fights with her invisibility or something.</br></br>  TWO DAYS  Is it possible that benefactor-kun is actually good? I know /a/ is at a consensus that he is bad, but what if he's not?  <br>Calm down, buddy. Wait for /a/non to start the 10 hour count down thread again</br>  <br> I know /a/ is at a consensus that he is bad <br>Really?</br></br>  <br>I haven't heard any other opinion and would like for /a/ to engage in critical thinking.</br>  <br> critical thinking <br>u mena random guesses, right?<br>Well, my critical thinking on the matter is that benefactor-kun-sama-sensei is MC's brother and is actually good.</br></br></br>  I have the feeling the little sister is evil.  <br>Well that's new.  Not sarcastic, no one ever speculated this. <br><br>This would feel terrible though.</br></br></br>  <br>No one yet, but he's softened around Nao quickly.<br><br>Protect the white-haired piggy.<br><br>Let's hope.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That would be the biggest plot twist. What if she was just there to stop Yuu from remembering brother-san? It would be like that one Arnold Schwarzenegger movie?</br>  <br>All I ever wanted to do was protect Nao's smile</br>  <br> spiking the pizza sauce <br>DIABOLICAL.</br></br>  <br><br>It would really bring the similarities between this and code geass full circle.<br>It would also explain why she's been torturing him with the pizza sauce</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't even genuinely smile out of happiness much. She's always just smug or emotionless. Unless you give her food.<br><br>I was thinking her love of food was tied to be starved. Perhaps when she was on the run before benefactor guy found her?</br></br></br>  <br> I'm going to steal your picture, it's too cute </br>  <br>I want to protect her</br>  <br>She's going to get hurt really badly anyway (as if getting punched in the face wasn't enough). Sorry anon, you will fail.<br><br>No  not the MPC-HC screencap I worked so hard on! </br></br></br>  <br>Oh God I hope so. Seeing him as the fuckpuppet of that bitch is painful as is.</br>  <br>Lewd comets.wavi</br>  <br>I want to see Nao suffering and your hairs being pulled out on it, normalfaggot.<br><br> Nao confirmed for taste of the normies </br></br></br>  <br> Dat Yuu <br><br>is this official art?</br></br></br>  <br>To see if people would make faggotic posts like these.<br><br>It was a success.</br></br></br>  <br>Yes. http://charlotte-anime.jp/news/?art<wbr>icle_id=35575</wbr></br>  <br>Deserving it objectively.</br>  <br><br>Literally the CD sleeve man.<br><br>Maybe more so by the people she's picked fights with than who she's been punched by so far.  I'd still protect her regardless. </br></br></br></br>  <br>The only thing Nao deserves is to be fed</br>  <br>There isn't enough meat in Japan to satisfy this girl's cravings.</br>  <br>She needs to be fed love. I have enough of that.</br>  <br> points at MC <br>I don't have to say it again, do I?</br></br>  <br>Yeah.... I guess... whatever.... I don't even want Nao</br>  <br>Have a Yusarin instead.</br>  <br>It's not the same. Naothing can compare to Nao's supple thighs.</br>  <br> Naothing <br>I would kill you for this pun anon. Luckily you are spared judgment because Nao's thighs are great.</br></br>  <br>I still don't fucking understand this.<br> I know I'm retarded. </br></br>  <br>No one really understands it. We are gonna have to wait for some big reveal.</br>  <br>Me neither. It could just be a joke, but who knows.<br><br>Two days to find out.</br></br></br>  <br> implying we won't be waiting another week before anything is explained  <br>If they stop with cliffhangers now, how will they drag on to 12 episodes</br></br>  This is still beautiful. I hope there's more "looking like a retard during teleportation" moments.  <br>This isn't the only loose thread they could leave dangling. Relax.</br>  I now remember what this anime reminds me of.  <br>no</br>    <br>This was my life 10 years ago</br>  Everything would be solved if they all had lots of sex.  <br>That's not how it works</br>  <br>Why does the MC look so cool?</br>  <br>I wish it was.</br>  <br>Because the black clothing looks normal and not laughable.</br>  So apparently Tomori's VA cried after finishing the anime.  <br>Because he took back his alpha status.</br>  <br>More crying? I heard that she cried when she got past ep 6 on the script, but ow.</br>  <br>I don't episode 6 is going to be sad. MC's VA confirmed that shit does go down there though.<br>The ending, however, left some VAs who knew the ending pretty depressed or something.</br></br>  <br>Because he's edgy self insert to all of us. Good looking, using power for own gain. Really, just like us, right?</br>  <br>Which radio programme was this?</br>  Would you Charlotte's Charlottes?  <br> Calling Nao Charlotte at this point <br>I need a drink.<br><br>That said, sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I would her thighs.</br>  <br>No because comets have high temperatures and I would be burned alive. However, I would cores Nao's thighs.</br>  <br><br>You guys are suicidal</br></br>  <br> not /fit/.jpg </br>  <br>Worth it.  The Ayane voice is like a light for flies. </br>  Did the shitposter get banned?  <br>Based Yu, can wait for more rectal wreckage from bet/a/ hipsters</br>  <br>He did, I believe.</br>  I bet the powers they got were originally to help them deal with a past trauma OR to help them fulfill a very important wish. There's probably a catch that has something to do with the protagonist's and his sister's dream sibling or whatever, like when the kids reach adulthood their powers don't only go away, but they are also forgotten.  <br>Nao waifu.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128832746 <br>Look at the goddamn thread title.</br>  <br>Almost time for the intro phase to end, the true Charlotte begins SOON</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128832746 <br>Charlotte</br>  <br>That would be pretty cool</br>  Would you?  <br>I would  feed  her.</br>  <br>I would  talk with  her.</br>    Seeing how its a 1-cour will it end up like AngelBeats?  <br>Way to jinx respecting MC respecting Yusarin for once.</br>  <br>This character got really annoying after Yusarin joined in</br>  Literally a true friend. Take notes, Sunohara.  I enjoy the art work and the pacing so far. Each episode seems to give off a little intense vibe, hinting at something big coming. I just hope the hype isn't over done and actually holds up. Also, Nao's thighs are sexy.  <br>I would puch her. Only because Key wants me to.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128835737 <br> wtf? <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>what were you expecting from the most cancer show of the season?</br>  <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128836089 <br> responding to obvious b8 <br>sure is summer here</br></br></br>  <br>I would let her  beat my ass  with a baseball bat.</br>  <br>Not that anon, but I just scrolled through this thread on the thought process of "Oh, I haven't been in a Charlotte thread yet." I wish I hadn't acted on that thought.<br>I think the thing that most surprised me was the people roleplaying as the show's characters in this thread, and even worse that it went on with only one objection to it. I'm borderline offended, I haven't seen trash this disgusting in threads since back when the SnK generals first started up. Whatever happened to post quality?</br></br>  <br> 4 episodes into an anime only to find out you haven't been watching it the whole time. </br>  <br>I didn't even notice the faggots roleplaying. I must have subconsciously realized their posts had zero substance so just skipped over them. I think this anime attracts a lot of shitposters and retards because it's more or less a spiritual successor to Angel Beats and Angel Beats has a lot of entry-level normalfag fans.</br>  <br>A character betraying the hopes of his comrades always turns me on, can't wait.<br><br>Just hope he goes full edgy overlord and not some master plan shit.</br></br></br>  <br>I would ravage her anus until she begs for mercy, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>I'm glad /a/ doesn't write anime scripts</br>  <br>I still don't understand what you are getting at. Could you clarify a bit more?</br>  <br> july not summer <br><br>are you dumb?</br></br></br>  Do you think Nao will keep recording while you make lewd love to her?  <br>What kind of shitty question is that?</br>  Does /a/ prefer their Nao smug, or slightly annoyed?  <br>I don't get it.</br>  <br>of course im gonna record!</br>  <br><br><br>Of course she would.</br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me, what'd she do with the archer captain's picture of her?  Keep it and go: "I may eat a lot, but damn do I look good"? <br><br>Annoyed.</br></br></br>  <br>I enjoy her teasing when she's smug. But I also think she's cute when she's annoyed. Sometimes I wish real girls were more like 2d girls, but then I realize if I ever think this too much I might end up buying a body pillow and my social life would be dead.</br>  <br>You mean something like this?</br>  <br>You are standing at the threshold, anon. Soon you will be one of us.</br>  <br>Fuck no. that looks shitty as fuck. I doubt Key would even authorize something that low in quality.</br>  My special ability is talking with chopsticks in my mouth.  <br> Air </br>  <br> Nao clearly isn't wearing any panties </br>  <br>Too annoying you know, it's like he did it on purpose just to be treated disgustingly. It's like he did that on purpose so the girls won't even try to make a move on him and makes the MC looks really cool guy in comparison.<br><br>Either he's just that bro to the MC, or he did it for another hidden reason.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Or you can be like me, and only fap to jap girls and 2d</br></br>  <br>no, she just made them invisible for you</br>  <br>Or he's simply just a crazy idolfag.<br><br>I wanna find out why he's squealing in front of Yusarin now this time in Ep 5.</br></br></br>  <br>Wouldn't your girlfriend get suspicious with the lack of  life liquid  during the deed?</br>  <br>No, man. I'm sure there something going on with him.</br>  <br>I thought her powers could only make herself fully invisible to one person, not specific parts.</br>  <br>You're giving speedbro more thought than the creators themselves did when they pulled him from their generic storage.</br>  <br> not specific parts. <br>only for you anon-kun</br></br>  <br>I doubt it. If we're talking wingman stuff, it's not working because Yuu still doesn't really take her seriously.</br>  <br>That's not how this works. That's not how any of this works.</br>  <br>What girlfriend?</br>  <br>fine, be a faggot.</br>  <br>Please /a/non... I know you can do it. I believe.</br>  Anyone we haven't identified in the OP yet?  <br>Nao sure does know how to take a hit. She'd make the perfect house wife.</br>  <br>I already plan on getting a jap wife and kids. Just not now</br>  <br>Good man. Japan's youth population is deteriorating and they need heroes like you to pump out geniuses. Just make sure to be a good husbando.</br>    <br>Speedbro is perfect for one off those wives that tries to murder their husband because they're sick of his obsession with idols.</br>  <br> Implying anyone would ever want to marry speedbro </br>  <br>Just look at how smug Nao is. I wonder how she still has friends sometimes.</br>  <br>dat ass tho</br>  <br>thanks anon. Being a good husbando and fatheru is my top priority.</br>  <br>Just barely. Speedbro feels more like a lackey than anything else.</br>  <br>I hypothesize that heaven is located in between Nao's thighs and supple ass. Of course, I need researchers to test this hypothesis.</br>  Nao's face when the mc possesses Nao, and starts masturbating.  <br> girlfriend </br>  <br>Nothing wrong with being a closeted anime watcher  Do you tell your friends that you watch anime? I sure as hell don't.  </br>  <br>yfw the anime ends with the idol and speedbro getting together.</br>  <br>This would make me so fucking happy. I don't think speedbro gets enough credit for the shit he does for the team.</br>  <br>Oh man, Misa's going to burst in out of anger for speedbro actually making the moves on Yusa. I don't want to be there.</br>  <br>Sounds good to me,  were gonna need a camera though for evidence </br>  <br>Honestly, for the romantic aspect of the show. I hope it's like "A Lull in the Sea" ending where each person finds their respectable fuck buddy for life.  Yuu with Nao. Speedbro with Idol. </br>  <br>Unless they intend to gut us, Yuu will probably end up with Nao somehow.</br>  <br>These two literary have the most generic characters. They could have been like Miria and Isaac of the series, but Key enjoys screwing over the bros.</br>  <br>Please excuse the blood on your sandwich</br>  <br>Speak of which.</br>  <br>But she clearly isn't recording in the picture.</br>  I just want a world where Nao can be happy.  <br>So a world of cocks?</br>  <br>Me too anon, but it's not happening.  Unless it does. Nao x Yuu ending when? </br>  But in all seriousness. I'm predicting that episode 10 will have no Nao and will focus on Yuu and his sister. It's far enough from the serious start but still gives enough space for more dramatic episodes.  <br> yfw Tomori eats him in the end because she loves him so much </br>  Episode 11 will focus on a hang out between Yuu and Idol-chan where Yuu thinks he's helping her out while Idol thinks she's actually on a date. Nao and Speedbro will be stalking them, speedbro dying from a broken heart while Nao is being jelous  Okay, so we know that they're both shit but who's the bigger offender?<br><br>Also, post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it.</br></br>   Hana kana  <br> shit  <br>Yeah, she's mainstream as fuck but damn she really got the talent. See her performance in The Garden of Words and you'll realize that she's not that really bad. <br><br>Amalia Sora on the other hand is a different story. Her performance in Aldnoah Zero and Akame Ga Kill is just inconsistent. I feel like her Hime voice fits her much better. It's like a lower pitched voice of Yui Horie's. She's just being pushed around for roles that doesn't really suit her voice (as of now). Give her some time to be more versatile and she'll turn out fine. It's just that her talent agency is pushing her around too much without giving her enough time to adjust.</br></br></br></br>  <br> we <br>Fuck off.<br><br> post seiyuus who are superior while you're at it <br>You first, let's see how great your taste is.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish she got more roles like this.</br>  HanaKana had to work hard to gain her popularity while Amamiya is just Sony's puppet.  <br>left &gt; right</br>  <br> hanakana <br> shit <br>Please don't bring your subjective opinion here, hanakana is famous for a reason</br></br></br>  <br> hanakana is famous for a reason <br>Yeah, because so many people like cutesy voice, which is fine in moderation but that's the only voice she ever use.</br></br>  <br> HanaKana had to work hard <br>And you think other seiyuu (not talking about Sora) don't work as hard as her? She got lucky she voiced popular/likable characters early in her career and when Osawa saw they can milk the fuck out of her they just kept the ball rolling.</br></br>  Hanakana just need more crazy roles, her usual "cute" castings are shit.  <br>I was just comparing the 2 of them and you suddenly feel the need to get all defensive? Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days.</br>  <br>KanaHana is actually talented and her voice is pleasant to listen to. Amamiya ranges from okay to makes me want to rip my fucking ears out.</br>  <br>Sawashiro is the best.</br>  <br>Mah nigga. She's always a treat to listen to.</br>  <br>You're praising HanaKana just because you think she worked hard when her workrate was average before she became popular.</br>  <br> that's the only voice she ever use <br>What about Rize?<br>What about Akane?<br>What about the love interest from Kotonoha no Niwa?</br></br></br></br>  <br> her workrate was average before she became popular <br>Stop lying and kindly fuck off. <br><br>Seiyuu with the most annoying fans on /a/:<br>1. Yuuki Aoi<br>2. Sakura Ayane</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Akane sounds the same as her usual roles though. Didn't watch the other 2 so I can't say anything about them.</br>  <br> Stop lying and kindly fuck off.  <br>Prove it asshole. Show me how she worked hard during her early career instead of talking out of your ass.</br></br>  Sawashiro and Chiwa Saito are my favorites in terms of talent, but I do love HanaKana the most.  <br>Can you prove otherwise? No. <br><br>One can only conclude that she worked hard because she had so many roles. Can't be lazy and still do that many work.</br></br></br>  <br>  HanaKana <br>  shit <br>Do you even Renai Circulation?</br></br></br>  any canadabros out there, see if you can meet up with tyrant-chan in 2 weeks if you want  <br>Gentlemen, I present to you: a deaf person</br>  <br>I do<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4l7<wbr>n71K0R7o</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Wow this thread really turns to shit fast.<br><br><br><br>I'll hopefully meet her, will be in Canada for a month or so.</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinks Akane sounds different from the usual HanaKana roles <br> call other people deaf <br><br>There's only one deaf faggot here and it's certainly you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, Kana Hana is so beautiful. She doesn't look like your average Japanese girl. She doesn't have that "round face" that makes so many Asian girls ugly.</br>  <br> Can you prove otherwise? <br>Yes.<br><br>https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%8<wbr>A%B1%E6%BE%A4%E9%A6%99%E8%8F%9C<br><br>See her roles for anime, game, and drama CD pre 2008 and count how many they were. Not so many, huh? Also count the number of radio shows pre 2008. One can only conclude that her workrate is the same as the average young seiyuu and she was lucky because she voiced likable and popular girls in her early career.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>   post superiors seiyuus <br><br>I happen to be an expert on this subject. A superior seiyuu all around.</br></br>  <br>Trips confirmed, miyukichi best seiyuu</br>  <br> she was only lucky <br>Is every Aoifag as bitter as this faggot?</br></br>  <br>Is every HanaKanafag as delusional as this faggot?</br>  <br>Taneda has a beautiful voice, but who is the absolute best of the best?</br>  <br><br>Yes to both questions.</br></br>  <br>you can tell it's her, yes.<br><br>But you also can tell Magneto is fuckin Ian McKellen, still it's different from his Gandalf.<br><br>So does she voice act in a different style in that role than in some below average harem shit? Yes she does and it's audible.<br>She has a range. Not a range as others might have, but also not as small as some might think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She was lucky because she has a voice like that. no matter what role she did in her early career sooner or later someone's gonna recognize her and put her in a good show/role.</br>  <br>My personal favorite is Ayaya and Yukina(I think this is her go to voice).<br><br>Rory sounds very sexy though.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only average, many of the insanely popular seiyuu started off with those one-off gigs and years of voicing "Girl C" and "Boy in convenience store"<br><br>Without luck, they won't get big. Without any talent whatsoever they won't stay big.</br></br></br>  <br>You just don't get it. She wouldn't be this popular if she voiced shit characters like Haruna, Kirino, Mikono, etc. When you're a young seiyuu you pray to the voice gods that you get roles that are likable or popular so you can ride on the popularity of the characters you voiced and when everyone notices you voice "best" girls then you can voice shit characters and no one would care, the fans will eat up your shit. Voicing popular and likable characters is the key to becoming popular.</br>  <br> lucky people can't be hardworking <br><br>Again, how can she be lazy and still do so many roles? Almost everyone needs a lucky break (i.e popular roles) to kickstart their career to a higher level but if she didn't work hard there's no way she can build on that initial popularity to be as popular as she is today. <br><br>You just sound like a bitter retard who can't accept Hanakana's popularity.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer to Mousou Express</br>  <br> how can she be lazy <br>She's not. Where in my post did I imply she was lazy? I said her workrate is average just like most seiyuu and it's nothing to brag about, retard.</br></br>  I want to hold hands with Aoi!  Post music.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=gmy<wbr>oRq-lYps</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ODe<wbr>NAOifss0</wbr>  [ ]<br>http://en.musicplayon.com/play?v=96<wbr>1626</wbr></br></br></br>  <br> workrate is average because she didn't get many roles early in her career <br>Seems like you're the one talking out of your ass. There's now way she can have many roles as some newbie. What matters is what she did once she got a lucky break and everything seems to indicate her as hardworking based on how many works she did every season.<br><br>Faggot like you can't even counter what I said in my post. You seems to be very angry about the fact that some people won the genetic lottery and they can build on that by working hard, yes, working hard.</br></br></br></br>  <br>All seiyuu who are serious about it work hard. She got a break because of talent and luck.</br>  Reminder among her major roles since 2014, Sora Amamiya only have 2 roles that did not involve Sony Music in the production committee of those anime.  <br> implying Amamiya Sora works hard </br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Jxy<wbr>IV9si5eg</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YGg<wbr>ZS_uP_0k</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zY_<wbr>Tp7QLHyg</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off, retard.</br>   there are people on /a/ right now who like this slut   <br>Those fucking  Sonyggers .</br>   Aoifags vs KanaHanafags <br>It will never end</br>  <br>I'm not even a KanaHanafag and I don't think she is as bad as what Aoifags want people to believe. Though her same voice syndrome can really get irritating sometimes. Same with Yuuki Aoi and her grating stock voice.</br>  Tanechan is 100x better than Amamiya Sora and 2x better than Hanazawa Kana.  <br> Seems like you're the one talking out of your ass <br>You're accusing me of talking out of my ass when you're the one who hasn't provided a lick of evidence as to why she's hard working. Tell me anon, what makes her hard working? Show me concrete examples and not some stupid logic you formulated in your head.</br></br>  <br>She looks dirty.<br><br>I like that.</br></br></br>  <br>According to this anon, yes. <br><br> everything seems to indicate her as hardworking based on how many works she did every season <br>So Sora worked harder than HanaKana because she had more roles in her starting career?</br></br></br></br>  Superior Seiyuu flying through  Can Hanazawa do this?<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=mMZ<wbr>AMJr_DSc</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>based as fuck</br>  <br> male <br>GTFO</br></br>  <br>Future Nakahara Mai 2.0</br>  Convulted logic - the thread<br><br>Make room for best dork</br></br>  <br>I refuse to believe there's a replacement for Nakahara.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=8R8<wbr>sSkDQSEM</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E9E<wbr>dBLzPqBY</wbr>  [ ]<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e6Q<wbr>RMqJreTE</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Amamiya Sora was being supported from the very beginning. How did her first audition happen? Oh, Sawashiro brought her there. Her first agency? Music Ray'n, a subsidiary of Sony Japan. Her first lead roles rained on her in the same year, only 2 years after her debut. Even Sugita doesn't have that kind of jumpstart and he's the best seiyuu in the entire industry. Hell even Kaji Yuki had to wait 4 years until he got a lead role.<br><br>Meanwhile HanaKana began acting when she was around 4- 5 years old. She basically went Toroko route to stardom. Auditioned and got every role she can get no matter how minor they were while also graduating from uni. Her agency? Office Osawa. A studio with no influence. Her first lead roles weren't exactly loveable either. Nadeko is a basebreaker, Mikan is Mikan and Suou is from that second season almost everyone wished to forget it exists.</br></br></br>  Was listening to old programs of プチミレディオ yesterday.<br>One of the listeners asked them about their main inspirations as a seiyuu, or something along those lines.<br>Being an Aoifag I knew about Aoi's relationship with Sawashiro from long ago, but I had no idea Taketatsu respected Hocchan so much.<br>Hearing her talk about it was a bit moving to be honest.</br></br></br>  I just want it on the record that you, OP, are shit.  <br> Her agency? Office Osawa. A studio with no influence. <br>Nah, Osawa has quite a few popular seiyuu as well. Before HanaKana their primary cashcow was Mamiko Noto.</br></br>  <br> No liking Sugita <br>JUST</br></br>  <br>Is Sugita the Brendan Fraser of seiyuu?</br>  <br>She's so skinny, she's probably one of the few seiyuu who look better with clothes ON than off.<br><br>Seiyuu-wise, she's okay when she's not playing Chu2 all the time.</br></br></br>  <br>Well many anons seems to hate sora a lot more lately. I just wish to rape the both of them.</br>  I love Kayanon.    I love Saorin  <br>It has no influence. If Sony is Barcelona then these guys are FC Porto.</br>  <br> implying Sora, Mikan, Kuu-chan, and Kobato aren't likable <br> implying Renai Circulation did not put HanaKana on the seiyuu map </br></br>  This isn't anime  <br>You're not anime</br>  Hayami Saori is the current 'it' girl on seiyuu business right now.  <br>Seiyuu is everything anime.</br>  <br><br>She's really damned good</br></br>  <br>You don't know that</br>  <br><br>Matsuoka pls</br></br>  <br>Perfect voice, acting, and singing. Should've dominated every season since a few years ago.<br>Too bad she rose to prominence right around Hanazawa's reign of terror.</br></br>  <br> now </br>  <br>How can you be anime if you're real?</br>  <br>Sketchbook is kinda obscure, Mikan is from To-Love-Ru, Kuu-chan and Kobato serve to a certain niche but they're not leads anyway. Renai Circulation helped her because she was so good at it. Her role didn't come with that guarantee. Even now people either hate Nadeko or love her. Do the calculation which one would net in more fans/popularity in a normal distribution? She was just that good to overcome that.<br><br>She had to be good to get where she is while Amamiya Sora got "blessed"-means "Sony called the studio" in Japanese- with certain hit roles. Akame, Elizabeth, Asshime. These are not usually roles you see a 2nd year seiyuu performing. One might be, but all three at the same year? It's not that Amamiya Sora is talentless-she's good- but she get's places she had no chance of getting without Sony pulling strings.</br></br></br>  <br>I wish I had gone to Otakon last year when she was a guest. Apparently, some random confag had the gall to ask if she was a fujoshi.</br>  <br>I like Sony Music's previous gorioshi, Tomatsu more than Amamiya.<br>She's actually a great seiyuu.</br></br>  <br> okay <br>I think she's great seiyuu.</br></br>  <br>Don't forget, she has Im@s Million Live in her pocket too. With the way Bamco is pushing ML and Cinderella Girls, it's guaranteed money for her, and inevitably another anime for ML will come.</br>  <br>During Otakon Hayamin also said she is friends with a seiyuu who is a fujoshi.<br>Gee, I wonder who that is.</br></br>  <br>She and her compatriots Asakura and Natsukawa already hijacked the imas movie.<br>Their character got featured prominently and the actual main trio of million live didn't appear at all.</br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that Sora Amamiya lead roles since 2014-2015 are 14 roles (sequel counted as one) with 10 main girl roles, two 2nd girls, and 2 important girls, also she will be in two new Sony/Aniplex movie too as one of main characters in both movie. Which seiyuu do you think ever jump that much and fast before?<br><br><br>All Trysail are in ML too, A-1 is working in all of the im@s so far so Sony is definitely part of production comittee</br></br></br></br></br>  http://www.liheliso.org/2014/09/01/<wbr>otakon-2014-hayami-saori-qa-panel/<br><br>Some lovelivefags ruin it though with love live question</br></br></wbr>  <br>If they were just idolshit wota, they could've at least asked her about Cinderella Girls. How do you ask someone a question about a franchise unrelated to them in any way?</br>  <br>Her talk with Ozawa Ari in Nozaki-kun radio is really fun. That radio also make me become an Ozawa fans.</br>  <br> Sketchbook is kinda obscure <br>That was a lead role no matter how obscure it is and Sora was likable.<br><br> Mikan is from To-Love-Ru <br>What does that even imply? Mikan is one of the most popular girls in TLR. She's in the top polls of favorite characters in the manga. She is one of the girls who get consistent merchandise.<br><br> Kuu-chan and Kobato serve to a certain niche but they're not leads anyway <br>Kuu-chan is still likable and Kobato not a lead in the anime called "Kobato," what?<br><br> Renai Circulation helped her because she was so good at it. <br>No, just no. Have you heard her character songs? They're not actually good. Renai Circulation is actually a good song and it helped boost her career.<br><br> Even now people either hate Nadeko or love her. <br>Having haters doesn't matter. Nadeko is still one of the most popular girls in Monogatari and she still consistently gets merchandise.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She worked several times in Sunrise anime</br>  <br> LLtards in charge of not being obnoxious <br>Props to Hayamin to give the best answer possible, though.</br></br>  <br><br>Holy shit, Not only her voice, her look also a bit similar with Nakahara Mai</br></br>  <br>Wrong quotes </br>  <br>Here is one.</br>  <br> lead roles <br>major roles</br></br>  <br><br> AniRevo <br><br>If it wasn't on the opposite side of the country.

Ami Koshimizu</br></br></br></br></br>   Youko, I sort-of understand the goth loli outfit, but why do I have to carry this heavy axe?   <br>well, Tomoyo is former child actress</br>  I love Saorin  What's your opinion on Ozawa Ari?<br><br>For a newbie, she's got quite a good range(almost as good as Taneda Risa, maybe) and is moderately cute.</br></br>  <br>Definitely my favorite young female seiyuu. Her personality is fun too.</br>  <br>She is really underated and /a/ don't know her</br>  <br>I really like her voice and she also looks really cute.<br>Kinda like Kayanon's younger sister.<br>Also I was curious of what how bad her remarks were that forced the radio producers to censor her quite a much.</br></br></br>  <br> censor her quite a much <br>Do you have any links for such radio shows?</br></br>    <br>Can't find it. Even the official twitter account of the show also doesn't have any link on it.<br>Maybe someone uploaded it on Nico/Bilibili, haven't really bothered to check there.</br></br>  <br>Do you at least know the name of the radio show?</br>  <br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm267<wbr>07903</wbr></br>  <br>https://twitter.com/ozanari1134</br>  <br> Fucking Aoifags are getting more ridiculous these days. <br> these days <br>They were always cancer, spamming their "3D LOLI" in every thread. The Prison Schoolfags of VA threads.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't what radio he mean. But if you like Ari, you should watch Ozanari, it was her radio show with Naganawa Maria. Both of them so cute together. <br>You can find it on youtube. it almost have all episode. I can't wait for new episode tonight.</br></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Seems like he meant Ozanari also.</br>  <br> Naganawa Maria <br>Why is her face looking fat there?</br></br>  Your thoughts on Takeuchi? P-kun really isn't enough to see if he has range to go with his timbre.  <br>Look fine to me, but maybe she's starting eating properly. She's not eating properly until Ari suggest her to.</br>  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh<wbr>WF9o4VLUSvP4UUtU2Owug<br>this channel has pretty good seiyuu radio collection, including Ozawa Ari's.</br></wbr>  Best young male seiyuu here  <br>Anyone who watched YuYuYu should know her. She did a great job as Fuu.</br>  <br>I know her since Kiniro Mosaic but there's simply nothing to talk about her.

Ayaneru is my seiyuufu.  <br>Because that gif is really small and therefore very misleading.</br>  <br>Listened to every episode of Haikyuu radio for him.</br>  I was listening to Gundam Seed Destiny's radio (which was aired in 2005 IIRC), hosted by based Suzumura Kenichi, and whenever Maaya Sakamoto was guest they would flirt shamelessly. It's hnngh-inducing to the listener and unsurprising in retrospect that they married.    <br>Late but here. Is she okay lately?</br>  Did Sugita banged her?  Every seiyuu whose name contains Rie is good  <br>I like him since Madan Radio with him and Iguchi Yuuka. That radio is awesome. I always laughing listening to it.<br>And it's a plus for me knowing that he's one of Matsuoka's best friend. And he also so friendly with other young male seiyuu like Ohsaka Ryouta and Natsuki</br></br>  <br>How the fuck Amamiya Sora instantly get all that main roles. is she pillow seiyuu?</br>  <br>Not him but I think she's doing fine. Though I wonder if she plans to keep up the goth loli act once she reaches 30.<br><br><br>Sony.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Every seiyuu whose name contains Kana is good</br>  <br>This season she have Working!!! and DRRR!.

Is there any other anime where he doesn't use his usual deep voice? Beside LH of course.</br>  <br><br>This is the problem. She gets either legacy roles or some minor support characters. I don't really know about her singing career but I have a feeling she's not favored anymore.<br> On another note, I just started to play Custom Maid 3D and the tsundere voice sounds a lot like her. </br></br></br>  <br><br> Amamiya Sora <br> Voices Asshime and Shiho (which somehow ruined A/Z and the IM@S movie) <br><br>She'll always be the worst until the end of time</br></br></br></br></br>    https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=zNd<wbr>pUShO4K4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Sawashiro's otouto seems like a pretty fun guy.</br></br>  <br>Shiho is a good girl.</br>  <br>Sugita is pure.</br>    <br>Hirano probably fucked Sugita in the ass with a strap-on.</br>  <br>He seems like the kind of guy who might be into that anyway.

Kaleido Star's web radio is pure gold with her and IRL Yamada. <br><br><br>They do that too, but their actual occupation is announcer (ie. reading news, acting as a neutral MC at events etc). 90% of popular anime events have one of the two as their MC thanks to their reputation as lovers of anime. <br>Washizaki Takeshi is a guy who wanted to be a musician (sings and playes guitar) and likes anime.

People like Marina and Chiwa are doing good however, sadly Kobayashi and Mamiko isn't getting as much roles as they used to. They are still active with Gangsta and MonMuse this season but they're not in as much shows as I would want them to be in.<br><br>And yeah, Ueda is struggling on by. With the end of UBW and her only role (I think) this season is Bikini Warriors, its worrying times for her. I guess she can branch out now, I believe she has done some movie dubbing before so she has that.</br></br></br>  <br> more idol-like talents <br>Being mad that your favourites can't even sing? My first preferred seiyuu was Hayashibara Megumi and she could sing as well as voicing.

If your favs are in business because their biggest selling point is being a 3DPD promotion tool, then you should leave.</br>  <br> I think that is the onlly thing keeping her relevant nowadays </br>  I'll just post this here.  <br>JUST</br>  <br> seiyuu threads complain about idol seiyuu and gorioshi bullshit invading the industry over actual talent <br> shit on someone with actual range and skill just because she's old and wrinkled <br><br>You guys really aren't so different than the koebuta, admit it.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I get what you mean with the market wanting the idol glamour with seiyuus but geez <br>I'm not saying that though. Actors generally should be able to sing, like stage actors learn to sing for a start. A VA that can sing well enough to live off of that is automatically better than one who can't use their voice well enough to sing a fucking song. It's also better for them, since they can release albums when they don't get much roles. If your precious VA disappeared than you can only blame her. <br><br>Also, Hayamin is one of my biggest favourites but she's doing well because she can act well, sing well, and generally marketable because she can stand on more than one leg.</br></br></br></br>  <br> actual range and skill <br><br>I love Kugyuu and all, but come on, she only has two voices: tsundere and her boy voice for Alphonse.</br></br></br>  <br>Amamiya gets a pass because she's cute. HanaKana has been around longer and she tends to voice shit girls. This isn't exactly rocket science.</br>  How do I meet in person my favorite voice actor and get an autograph?  <br> seiyuu threads complain about idol seiyuu <br>No they don't.<br> gorioshi bullshit <br>A lot of them are fine even if they're gorioshi.<br> Kugimiya <br> range <br>Get a grip.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> she tends to voice shit girls <br><br>Sure anon. Sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Go to a con they're going to.<br><br>Be warned, cons are just as horrible as everyone makes them out to be.</br></br></br>  <br>Onodera is a nice girl but,<br>unfortunately not the best in her show</br></br>  <br>...how do I know what con they're going to?</br>  <br>Guest list?</br>  <br>You follow them on Twitter or check their site (either their own blog or a fan site). Or .</br>  <br><br>But there's no guarantee they'll go to a con this way</br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're out of luck if they don't go to cons. If you're desperate you can try arranging a trip to Japan when they have live events for the show s/he's in. I remember there were people from Taiwan and Hong Kong at the VA event for Working S2.</br>  <br>That's how it works, unfortunately. Just hope for the best and if an opportunity comes up and they go to a specific one, fly out to it and attend. Chances of them coming to a big US con like AX increase if there's a fairly recent or recently licensed anime that studio is pushing a localized release for (Aniplex for Fate and KLK, PonyCanyon for Yuki Yuna).</br>  <br>too bad she is not in her prime anymore.</br>  <br><br>I'll keep an eye on that then</br></br>   Kugyu <br> no range <br> Aoi Yuuki <br> pillow seiyuu <br>Funny thread, but it reeks of ignorance.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Trips confirm.<br> https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oB<wbr>hlM0UpHLU</wbr>  [ ] </br></br>  <br>I wonder who's behind this post.</br>  <br>  Ayane Sakura has none of those.  <br>;_;</br></br>  <br>She's only 21 so her agency/family probably want to protect her from the industry's madness until she's a little older. She'll get a blog in a few years.</br>  <br>Hopefully. I'd die for an Ayane Sakura twitter. I bet she'd tweet about the most hilarious things.</br>  Oh my<br>I've actually found her address</br>  <br>What is so crazy about having a blog? Aoi Yuuki has been blogging and answering to fan-mail since she was 16.</br>  <br>I was watching the 2014 Animelo where she sang a few solo songs. She seemed really sad and withdrawn. She didn't look like she had an once of fun in her body during it. Unless that's just apart of her Gothic loli act.</br>  <br> What is so crazy about having a blog? <br>It's not so much having a blog as the fanbase swarming around it. Maybe she wants to keep her private life and work more separate than other people. Maybe something happened behind the scenes that made management cautious.<br><br>Or maybe she isn't too interested in the social media.<br><br><br>It depends on the event but she's usually energetic/fun-loving, so she was probably having a bad day/didn't want to be there.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  http://myanimelist.net/people/34/Yu<wbr>u_Kobayashi<br>thread</br></wbr>  <br> she was probably having a bad day/didn't want to be there. <br>From what I heard recently it seems to be constant. I feel so sad for her. What the fuck even happened? Apart from getting shit roles and being sidelined.</br></br>  <br>It could be any number of things. Death in her family, break-up with a boyfriend, argument with friends/colleagues, or just apathy/loss of interest. <br><br>But I have the feeling that some VAs sort of lose interest in their work as they reach their 30s and beyond, like it's not so enjoyable anymore. Fans gravitate towards the new faces because they're younger and fresher, and there's only so much attention left to spare for the old crowd. It's pitiful how hard Yukari Tamura tries to stay relevant (and she's depressed as fuck too if her tweets are any indication), no one remembers Yui Horie, and Fumiko Orikasa is waiting in vain for the Bleach anime to come back. They're not supposed to complain and they have to show that they care, but that's probably what's causing her the most stress, pretending to be enjoying herself when she isn't. Eventually they give up.</br></br></br>  <br> no one remembers Yui Horie, <br>I don't think this is true at all.</br></br>  <br>Not in Japan they don't. She still has a dedicated circle of followers, hell everyone does, but whenever she tries to reenter mainstream attention the reception is cruel.<br><br> recent PV for her song <br> she's dancing and singing in an idol costume (?) <br> most of the comments say she's old, used goods, trying too hard, make-up can't hide age, etc </br></br></br></br></br>  I wonder what's going on with KitaEri. Her role in SB69 was given to another seiyuu.  <br>From what I heard she didn't lose interest, but the industry doesn't care about her that much anymore, and it makes her deppressed. I wish a new Madoka would start already, no matter how shitty, at least she wiould get her role. <br>It feels so shit to fall in love with her voice when it's too late.</br></br>  There's literally nothing wrong with HanaKana.  <br> Her role <br>You mean her singing Plasmagica songs? The characters don't have voices in the game. And we don't know jack shit why they casted someone else in the anime. Maybe she didn't want to voice another stupid bitch.</br></br>  <br> I wish a new Madoka would start already <br>They ought to make a Blue Exorcist: Brotherhood because that show sold like hotcakes and Izumo's arc was great in the manga. Also Nobuhiko Okamoto's favorite character is Izumo. They could make it work.<br><br>It would also be worth watching Working 3's VA events, because she had a lot of fun in the events they held for previous seasons.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>KitaEri is a prime target for cyberbullying. Awful otaku spam "pillow" and "slut" and I don't think she ever recovered entirely from the Kokoro Connect incident either. IIRC she said she lost a great place for socializing when she had to close her Twitter account.</br></br></br>   you will never have a threesome with Nana, Yukarin and Hocchan   <br> Maybe she didn't want to voice another stupid bitch <br>But that is what KitaEri does best.</br></br>  <br>I don't want to be either of them. Maybe Nana.</br>  <br>I feel unnaturally attracted to Yukarin for whatever reason. Would fuck in a heartbeat.<br>Nana I respect too much for wanting anything lewd with her.</br></br>  <br>Well, the only reason I would be Nana is to fuck Yukarin until she's broken.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>brothers</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shiho isn't part of the main trio in ML; unless Sony forces the staff to give her a starring role.</br>  <br>Well, Ami Koshimizu was the lead in KLK but they used ancient seiyuu (plus TaMako) there.</br>  Any newer seiyuu that likely got to where she is through talent alone?  <br>Misaki Kuno.</br>  <br>Aya Suzaki</br>  Remember when she took over the industry for one season then got dropped for Hana boring Kana again?<br><br>Sad times.</br></br>  <br>This Aoi's season.<br>They alternate their reign, it's Aoi's turn now.</br></br>  Pretty good episode last night. Really like it when Ari always teasing Maria. Look like they will celebrating Maria's birthday in next episode.  Anyone like Mamiko Noto?  <br>TEH RIE was the same case when she was typecasted as that. Lacus and Chii both sounded annoying... But then Suigintou happened.</br>    <br>He's probably my favourite younger main male protagonist voice dude.<br><br><br>Hiromi Igarashi was Horie's fan club. She was a pretty big deal back in the day, although Yukinko is into a lot of the same kind of stuff as Ayachi (and more)<br><br><br>They're both old.<br><br><br>It's like you didn't watch the trainwreck that was the im@s movie at all<br><br><br>He's always going to be cast that way but he's a decent actor in the Nippon Roudoku Academy segments. I mean the highlights of those are always Reina Ueda though, and despite listening to Rie Takahashi in those for over a year I'm still surprised how good she is in Sore ga Seiyuu and Gakkou Gurashi.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's adorable. Truly an angel.<br><br> That terrible feeling she'll one day inevitably grow old and pass away. </br></br></br>  <br>The last new role I just saw KitaEri get is some random fuck Korean developed mobage with the usual mobage casting. (eg. obligatory Ai Kakuma)<br><br>Which is especially bizarre given <br>(just as a reminder, Sumipe stayed in the anime and they have regularly been put together from sharing the same label in shows like Papakiki and Cross Ange)<br><br>Also noteworthy is that Yurika Kubo is doing about the same voice as in Love Live in this game except it doesn't sound like total amateur shit anymore.<br><br><br>Aya Suzaki is only 10 months younger than Koshimizu actually, she just took a long time to break into the industry. (university+3 years as an OL before getting into an agency+2 years to her breakout roles)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://idolmaster-music.tumblr.com/<wbr>post/51164340715/song-venus-syndrom<wbr>e-artist-minami-nitta-cv<br>Suzaki a best; outsings Uesaka Sumire in the Love Laika song.</br></wbr></wbr></br>    <br>what is that?</br>  Comments about Amamiya's talent level aside, Try Sail sounds fucking terrible as a unit.  <br>I'd love to go to lunch with the two of them.<br>I wouldn't understand a word. I just want to hear the two of them talk.</br></br>    <br>But Trysail has the miracle of the world named Mocho.</br>  <br>Oh god, Saber's VA has strange bone structure. And that's not NotoMami's best side either. What was the photographer thinking?</br>  <br> being a retard who will believe every single rumor <br><br>Not saying she's a virgin but damn you're a giant faggot. Your "pure" seiyuufu probably sucked hundreds more dicks than her.</br></br></br>  I love this meme where people pretend shit seiyuus like Yuuki Aoi, Sawashiro Miyuki, Kobayashi Yuu, Hanazawa Kana and Sugita are actually good.    <br> people shit on VAs for having no range <br> love Sugita <br> "but Sugita has no range" <br> "yeah but he's funny" <br>There you are folks, skill level doesn't matter as long as you're a cool guy.<br><br>People need to fuck off with the Sawashiro circlejerking too. They argue she has range and submit Baby Beel from Beelzebub as one example. Great, so she can make squeaky baby noises. As if 90% of the other VAs couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hanazawa Kana  <br><br>She's actually really good though. The rest of your list isn't wrong.</br></br></br>   seiyuu thread <br> no one ever mentions kana asumi <br><br>Bit of samevoice going on sometimes but it does things to my heart  and dick </br></br></br>  <br> no one ever mentions kana asumi <br>Lurk more.</br></br>  <br>Asumi Kana is actually a good fit for seiyuu threads. She's not overrated or underrated around here.</br>    <br>Personally, I really hate this new trend of how people treat seiyuu. You have to look like a model, and fuck off with your range, we want you in all of the same cheap and easy to do roles. It's almost like people don't want voice actors anymore, they want idols who do voices. It doesn't seem like a world where someone like Akira Kamiya, Masako Nozawa, or Nobuyuki Hiyama would actually be picked for the role of main characters any more. They're all pretty talented, but they aren't exactly the most attractive people, they just look like regular guys.<br><br>It seems like being a voice actor in the 90s and going back was probably the best time to do it. You get your chance to stretch out your legs, show what actual telent you have and come back for a role every now and then.<br><br>But you know what, it's probably because I'm close to 30, and all of my favorite voice actors are of the older generation, and it kind of pains me to see the relatively younger 30-40 aged voice actors, especially women get shit upon for just being that age. I don't know what happened to Rie, but it makes me feel really bad if she doesn't look great, she's pretty much washed up.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sugita has plenty of range, what kind of rugs are you on?</br>  <br> skill level doesn't matter as long as you're a cool guy <br>That's not even it. There are plenty of seiyuu who are funny and interesting. It's just that majority of the anons here are ignorant and they rely on someone else spoon-feeding them (ie. translated shows of Tokyo Encounter, English seiyuu blogs).<br><br> People need to fuck off with the Sawashiro circlejerking too. <br>It's really annoying how hypocritical they are. Also, her voice isn't even unique. See: <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Tn1<wbr>Az4OdZ20</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br></br>  The saddest thing would be Nana losing relevance.<br><br>I mean, generally speaking the other seiyuus have stuff outside of their careers to look forward to. What does Nana have if she is no longer popular?</br></br>  <br><br>Nana's a very successful musician. I think she's further away from working retail once her popularity dips compared to your average voice actress.</br></br>  <br>Why are you so narrow minded? Do you know how much a seiyuu gets paid voicing in an anime? Not much. You want them to go back to flipping burgers on their free time because seiyuu pay can't let you live a normal life? You should be grateful the industry changed because now these seiyuu don't only voice act but they have different jobs to support them.</br>  <br>The only real difference is that voice actors need to clean themselves up and look presentable now instead of look like they were dragged in off the street because back then no attention was paid to it<br><br>And if you catch the odd making-of piece, you see everyone is still mostly just normal looking people</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about, Nana is very successful and popular singer, no seiyuu ever reached that kind of popularity as singer. She is more relevant singer than seiyuu not to mention King Records always create so many anime every year, her career is guaranteed by them.</br>  Post lewd seiyuu you fucks  <br>She will be fine.<br>His fans are very dedicated and she doesn't sells as an idol but as a musician, a job in which age is not very important.<br><br><br>You are thinking of idol seiyuu, they are the ones that have to have a perfect image.<br>Most old seiyuu are still relevant, but they are more expensive and have other jobs which makes them busy.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Yu Kobayashi 2.0   <br> Geek <br> those grody armpits <br> Pippi Longstockings <br>Her body and looks aren't bad but not sure if want</br></br></br></br>   Hanakana as first post for seiyuu thread <br>Gee, and I wonder why people always ask why these threads go to shit</br>  <br>Name me a seiyuu and I will make a seiyuu thread with the one you recommended next time.</br>  <br> dat wink <br><br><br>Should I post that Maaya pic?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuuki Aoi.</br>  <br>Kitamura Eri</br>  <br>Now that's an opinion I can get behind.</br>  <br> They're popular so they're shit <br> we <br><br>Choke on a dick and die you fucking faggot</br></br></br></br>  <br>Alright, I'll make a seiyuu thread with Ao-chan next time.<br><br><br>Sorry anon, maybe next time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sachika Misawa or Emi Nitta.</br>  <br>Please no. Aoifags are retarded and cancerous.</br>  <br><br>Oh fuck off, VA threads are made with Aoi in the OP all the fucking time. Even if they don't have her in the OP she gets spammed like no tomorrow anyways.<br><br>Give it to someone like SatoRina or OnoD for a change. Or Miyano.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay, then I'll change this to a vote instead of who recommended first. Who ever gets the most recommendations will be the next seiyuu featured in the OP.</br></br>  <br>Dude just go with a VA you like. If you ask for recommendations you're just going to get proxies and samefagging.</br>  <br>Or you can also not make any seiyuu thread. Leave it to someone else.</br>  <br><br>Okay, I'll think of something.</br></br>  <br>She has all it needs to look sexy, but somehow doesn't, it's actually amazing how she flaunts her boobs around without managing to look the least sexy.<br><br>Making it too easy for you to call me a faggot</br></br></br>    <br>I could listen to this man narrate 18th century Russian philosophy in whatever Russian Engrish is and still be entertained.</br>  <br>omoshiroi teeth there</br>  Taneda is gay though.  <br>This nigga right here</br>  <br>that's quite the gap there<br> asspics? </br></br>  <br>Super-lewd</br>  protect sumipe's sumipes  <br>excuse me for a moment</br>  sumipe  <br> gaijin at the back trying to get a solid look at those Sumipes </br>      <br> 'I'm gonna fuck all of these chicks later, I'm so happy!' </br>      <br>What a slut.</br>  <br>Can't wait for them to come out. They look really fun to watch.</br>  <br>Grating voice.</br>  <br> forgetting that Nana`s original goal in her life is to become an Enka singer <br>Once she is done being a seiyuu-artist, she's going to debut as an Enka singer because that's what her father really wanted her to do.</br></br>  <br>I was wondering when you would show up.</br>  Why doesn't Omigawa Chiaki get more main roles?  <br>She either doesn't audition much, or isn't good enough.</br>  <br>she doesnt has sony backing her ass up</br>  <br>Grating post.</br>  <br>Is that a cosplay of Hana from Prison School? That's freakishly accurate.</br>  Will seiyuu thread become general thread?<br> I'm okay with this because /a/ has so little knowledge about seiyuu. </br>  I want to hang out with Akira Ishida.

She might or might not going to get into a dangerous situation, and then when she's saved, her smile might or might not make you go "Huh? Is that okay? Huh?", or something like that. <br> Miku will definitely won't fall into darkness, she's just sincerely thinking about Hibiki. That said, she's gonna call out her hidden side and fool around a little bit. <br>Calling it now, Hibiki is going to die or go into magic coma and Miku is going to go to the dark side or do some other fucked up thing to get Hibiki back.</br></br></br>          <br><br>Why didn't they kiss</br></br>  Miku Miku Miku  <br><br> Low resolution piss poor quality facebook images <br>Stop that.</br></br></br>  <br>IS IT FRIDAY ALREADY?<br><br>HOLY SHIT.</br></br></br>  <br>I do not know me too I want</br>  <br>I wonder if her gear is actually just dormant inside her now.

I mean you are going to be in every Symphogear thread posting that same image until the end of time after all.</br>  <br>Best.</br>  <br>Season 3 is shit, right?<br> I never watch this season. </br></br>    <br><br>You will never sleep between them as they warm their ice-cold feet on your body</br></br>  <br><br>Why is Miku wearing Hibiki's undies?</br></br>  Chris a best, Tsubasa a shit, Hibiki a lame  <br>Maria's only useful for that.</br>  <br>That scene was so heart-boner warming, Maria has to be some amazing cuddle material.</br>  <br>I'd say it's first 4 episodes were the best of any season so far.</br>  <br>I want to see Miku kiss Hibiki's scare on her check.<br><br><br>I want this to stop being asked every thread.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The original author is in full control of the story again, take a guess.</br>  <br>They sleep in the same bed and bathe together, I don't think sharing underwear means anything with them.</br>  <br>True I had not noticed</br>  <br><br>What? I always thought anime turns shit after season 2. <br>Downloading this, thanks.</br></br></br>  <br><br> one toothbrush <br><br>what.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Guess where the other one is.</br>  <br>You posted the wrong one.</br>  <br><br>Dammit Hibiki put on a bra<br><br>Your back is going to ache</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Sonicare react with her gear?</br>  <br>But she's not Chris</br>  <br>I'm still mad the roaches don't crawl inside the eyes again from her mouth so it loops perfectly</br>  <br>It's a fucking crime that the artist went with Miku instead of the obvious choice.</br>  <br>Bikkiebutt belongs to Miku and Miku only so she had to contribute with hers.</br>  to say who wants look at this  <br>Is this a yuri anime like kancolle?</br>  <br><br>mah niggas</br></br>  What if Bikki's sudden bitching wasn't caused by her own insecurities but by Carol's attack in episode 2? <br><br>If Gungnir didn't respond to her because she forgot what she's fighting for, it could mean that Carol's attack kind of "removed" her memories in a certain way.</br></br>  <br>It's closer to Nanoha levels of gay. Missing a daughter though.</br>  <br>Can you stop dumping pics from fucking Facebook?</br>  <br>The loli can still be adopted</br>  <br> Missing a daughter though <br>They will adopt Carol and Eruefuru.</br></br>  <br>The loli is obviously for Chris since they decided to ship TsubaMari and Chris has always gotten around.<br><br><br>We can only hope it happens in S3 like it did in Nanoha.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We can only hope it happens in S3 <br> hope it happens in S3 <br> in S3 <br> S3 <br>Anon...</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> sexually fuck </br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> Chris has always gotten around. <br>Rude.</br></br>  Hibiki is the manliest  <br>I don't see how someone as adaptable as Chris wouldn't get around. She seems well liked by everyone and if you're surrounded by flowers you will want to sniff and/or pluck them all.</br>   Chris was fine with Kirika and Shirabe PDA <br> the moment Hibiki and Miku started she panicked and shut it down </br>  <br>Because no one cares about DMJii, duh</br>  <br> that banding </br>  <br>DMJii are cute little girls holding hands.<br><br>Miku and Hibiki exhibit degenerate lesbian behavior. Chris has spent enough time around them to know exactly how gay they can get.</br></br></br>     No one posting best girl Chris   <br>You aren't supposed to hold hands in public until you're married.</br>  Friendly reminder that Miku saw Chris naked first before anyone else  Besides dozen of older men and probably women too  when she nursed her back to health.  <br>Hibiki will fall into a magic coma and Miku will work for some white-haired evil shota to bring her back even if it means fighting her friends.<br><br> Rewatching Mai Otome felt good. It was actually better than I remembered. </br></br></br>    <br>Or she starts wearing Miko clothes and tries to summon a mecha from the moon named after a legendary japanese sword together with Ogawa who is actually an Orochi.</br>  <br>She's so crosseyed.</br>  <br>I want to fuck Chris silly</br>  <br>Why are you forgetting Fine?</br>    <br>Isn't it fine to forget about Finé, she was more of a pimp to Chris. Not a potential yuri mating partner.</br>  So non-meme subs never?  <br>An anon mentioned in the last thread that H&amp;D's main... translator? Something, someone important to H&amp;D subs at least, is on vacation atm<br><br>no idea if it's true, but it seems plausible</br></br></br>  <br><br>Which one is BB?</br></br>  <br>While I think that wanting to do that shows that you're still alive because every breathing male would do that I still have to tell you that she already is silly. And crazy.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, Zoid is at Wonfes, so ep 4 is delayed.</br></br>  <br>I want to shove my dick between Hibiki's thighs.</br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>12 hours and about 10 more minutes anon.</br>  <br>yes<br><br>now go back to sleep kirika, it's past your bedtime</br></br></br>  <br><br>I didn't care for Kiri last season but Damn has she gotten a lot better</br></br>  <br><br>Death</br></br>   Episode 5 <br>Is it going to happen again?</br>  <br>She was already a sexy little piece of work last season.</br>  Best pair:  Kirika's stripey socks     12 hours guys  No delay this week?    <br><br>Thumbnail looks like she had four arms.</br></br>  <br><br>She was pretty much Hibiki with different hair. I blame my recent attraction on the flood of good fan art and a delicious transformation sequence, things she lacked last season.</br></br>  <br>Garie and Micha have a lot of fan art together even though they were shown later than Phara and Lieur.</br>  <br>Because the latter are pretty lame.</br>  <br><br>They still have time to redeem themselves, but I doubt they can. Micha and Garie are Team Fun, Leiur and Phara are Team Serious, so it's obvious who's better.</br></br>  <br>Smug onee-chan and loli imouto make a great pair</br>  <br><br>Phara is fun in a way.</br></br>    <br>Why?</br>  So I just finished rewatching S1 for the first time since G aired. It literally brought me to tears three different times, and this moment caused me to "Fuck Yeah" hard enough to make my neighbors dog start barking.<br><br>We really don't deserve something this fantastic. How can one anime be so completely BASED?<br><br>Also, dat Aoi scream.</br></br></br></br>  <br>wont you drink Kirika's period blood every morning like Shirabe does? If you truly love her then you would do it too.</br>  That attack directly impacted Gungnir, shattering it and sending a shard into Hibiki's heart again. This time a shard of Micha's sword crystal thing also pierced her heart, so she's a Human/Relic/Alchemy hybrid.<br>Make it happen.</br>    <br>But Micha is my waifu</br>  <br> Less than 24 hours to go <br>My happiness is completely charged!</br></br>  Finally started season 3 i have 3 more episodes. Should i just marathon them before the new ep comes out?  <br>Hopefully they don't become too evil. I like them but I won't if they kill anyone other than nameless people.</br>  <br>Lieur has a megadeus that she can apparently materialize at will, she's anything but lame.</br>  <br>Hibiki will get up and go berserk, and rather than be concerned, Miku will smile and tell Hibiki to just murder the dolls.</br>  <br>Do it! Then you can livewatch with us tomorrow and join in on the discussion. Also, you'll love where this season is going. Definitely go for it!</br>  <br> Hopefully they don't become too evil. <br>Garie massacred a shit ton of people. She's beyond redeemable.</br></br>  <br>Leiur vs Chris<br>Phara vs Sword<br>Micha vs DMJii<br>Garie vs Maria<br>Bikki vs Carol<br><br>What would you do if it's Leiur's giant vs  motherfuckin' Genjurou  in a ship throwing contest  </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> i <br><br><br>Perfection doesn't need to be redeemed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>your S1 character song &gt; the later ones</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower &gt; all.</br>  <br>Rainbow Flower wasn't in season 1, doofus.</br>  <br> Zenbu &gt; Rainbow Flower &gt; * <br>FTFY</br></br>  <br>I'd be cute about it, catch it in a glass and drop in a celery stick. Because I don't need bloody Maria for that.</br>  i miss it when chris used to say "bang" in her transormation sequence<br><br><br> inb4 i was just <br> pretending to be retarded guise i swear!</br></br></br></br>  does anyone have a tampon tea fetish?<br> because I don't </br>  <br>Me too. Chris' G transformation is the best in the entire franchise.</br>  <br>I miss it when people used to use their shift key.</br>  What's this I've been hearing about swimming?<br>It won't affect Symphogear right?</br>  <br>Will streamer still have time to play symphogear song to increase hype?</br>  <br>  27:10 MBS 戦姫絶唱シンフォギアGX #01 <br>From Yucie's page, but may be not updated</br></br>  <br>But that's Mikugeah</br>  <br><br> There's no way she can lose! <br> Gets rekt <br> Comes back <br> It's impossible for her to lose! <br> Gets rekt again <br><br>deconstruction of the main character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   me started to watch first season a few months ago <br> was fun and all but it got too serious and gritty halfway and I ended up dropping after episode 9 <br> decided to check a bit the final fight  <br> FUCKING EXPLOSIONS, NAKAMA POWER AND ANGEL FORMS <br> mfw <br><br>I regret dropping it and I downloaded it again.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>that smug shark tooth grin, I love it so much</br>  hola quien habla español    Why does like everyone shit Hibiki just because she wants to help people? Also beef stroganoff song a best  <br>Fuck off Pablo</br>  <br>Its just a bunch of faggots that don't believe in Justice.</br>  <br>i meant like in the show</br>  <br> facebook shit </br>  Does Hibiki not care about men in their 20s? She hardly even reacts to their bodies.<br>Why doesn't she want to save them?<br>They're basically us. Wouldn't she want to save us?</br></br>  <br> Not being a little girl </br>  Why do you so love Synphogear?  <br>Because I love Nana, and I love the dumb fun and singing this show provides.</br>  <br>Beef Stroganoff and manly Bikki</br>  <br><br>Bras don't prevent back pain, they cause it.</br></br>  <br>There's no tag for heartpupils on the panda. C'mon, help me out.</br>  <br>Got hooked on S1, thought there was an interesting relationship developing between Mikku and Hibiki. Catchy songs, too. Kinda lagged for the first parts of S2, at least until Miku got into danger again.</br>  I know I'm late as fuck but<br> failing to get 128777777 <br>Shame on you all. Its like you aren't thankful for Symphogear.</br></br>  <br> best dancer <br> best poser <br> best girl is fate rival <br> fucking shit up with goddamn coins <br> summons a creepy ass giant stand that throws ships at you <br> lame <br>Seems like everyone's obsessed with Garie but I want to see more of Leiur instead.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>She's like what Michael Jackson would be if he was a woman, instead of a dead pedophile. They both deflected bullets with dance moves.</br>  <br>I would love her if she wasn't ugly as fuck. She's like a middle-aged chain-smoker wearing a chastity belt.<br><br>Also breakdancing is shit-tier.</br></br></br>  Carol's VA is so young.  <br>Dead ALLEGED pedophile. Also don't forget that they're both bad. Really, really bad.</br>  Zoid posted some Sympho photos from Thomas Romain's Artbook.    <br>No Gary?</br>    <br>Is this Kadingir?<br><br>Garie's VA is still new as fuck and no one knows when she was born yet.</br></br></br>  <br> there's an English translation <br>Damn man. I wish I had that.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Looks like Babylonia's Treasury from where the Noise came from.</br></br></br>  <br>Sometimes I forget how old Nana is. It's great that she's able to put so much energy into her roles and songs despite being an old hag.</br>          Just finished watching first season a few hours ago. It was pretty good. I expected something like vividred operation but I got moe Bruce Lee instead. Is it explained why this guy can do all that crazy shit? Is it just superior martial arts and I should turn my brain off?    <br> Is it explained why this guy can do all that crazy shit? <br>He eats, sleeps, and watches action movies.<br>What more is there to say?</br></br></br>  <br>He's a true man.</br>        <br><br><br>Well, how embarrasing.

I really can't see his stuff being liked outside hipsters there    <br><br>I've no idea.</br></br>            <br> upcoming Italian print <br>Just for reference, Star Comics is going to dump on us Wet Moon, Bambi and Deathco back to back.<br><br>Panini is also publishing Soil btw, but it's not going well apparently - considering it got moved to a 3-monthly release for a completed serie that's the only explanation.<br>Vol 5 coming this August.</br></br></br></br></br>                  <br>I stopped buying italian releases years ago so I'm not very updated, but last time I checked manga was a dying market. no surprise really that authorial stuff isn't successful</br>                                          <br>The market is still alive and big (although the economic issues shrunk it), the problem is that it's shifting more and more towards "casual" readers and less quality content, on top of having mostly shortsighted morons as publishers unable to make good decision, especially for the future.</br>                    <br>Starcomics's editorial looks like a clusterfuck. They have a bunch of works published under a "publishing branch", but I can hardly understand the why and where of their organization:<br><br><br> Action<br> Amici<br> Anime comics<br> Dragon<br> Dragon Quest<br> Express<br> Fan<br> Ghost<br> Greatest<br> Gundam universe<br> Hot<br> Kappa extra<br> Kappa magazine<br> Kappa magazine speciale<br> KM Presenta<br> Must<br> Mitico<br> Neverland<br> Point break<br> Shot<br> Starlight<br> Storie di kappa<br> Techno<br> Turn over<br> Up<br> Up Speciale<br> Young<br> Zero<br> Albi fuoriserie<br><br>On the good hand, the books are pretty dirt cheap (in comparisom with here in Germany)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>                  Thanks for the dump. I'm enjoying it.  <br>He seems pretty popular in France, it looks like he's gone to a couple conventions there and he tweets french people a lot on Twitter <br><br>I'm not sure about Japan but he used to illustrate cd covers and posters for some bands besides making manga.</br></br></br>  <br>They're just the names of their publishing "containers".<br>For example, say dragon has 4 release/month sheduled and 4 series in it, all of them will be bi-monthly. <br>Don't mind them, it's just for organization purposes, not really meant to strictly fit the genre of the serie in it.<br><br>StarComics have the best economic releases (especially under a price/quality ratio) but personally i don't like their catalogue  and font  as much as other publishers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 4 release/month sheduled and 8 series in it <br>Messed up.</br></br>  <br>He is popular enough as "alternative manga". It's not as main stream as those like Naruto or Attack on Titan, but there are always certain people who like minor artistic style. And he is definitely talented in that area. I know it because   I'm Japanese .</br>        <br>W T F?!</br>                                                so i am having a late night read and since nothing was updated i look for something new and came across this(ako in particular) which i find interesting and was wondering if anybody relates to this so much it hurts them  No.<br><br>Fuck off back to </br></br>  makes a thread for a manga base on a group of people who play games and on who cant tell the difference between games and reality <br>gets sent to /v/</br>  <br>Want me to send you to /adv/ instead?

Is there even any competition?  <br> Daimidaler is better than shimoneta <br> Daimidaler is better than literally anything else other than Daimidaler <br>Whoah buddy calm down I think you have a concussion from your facepalming.<br><br>I can understand not liking shimoneta but daimidaler has no redeeming features whatsoever<br>even the uncensored version has pretty shitty nipples.<br><br>The swearing is the least funny part of shimoneta but it is still better than anything daimidalier has to offer including but not limited to a freaking plot and characters that are not completely interchangeable.<br>Daimidalier made my front tail wicked soft, did not enjoy.<br><br><br> they cross the line between 2D and 3D in the worst possible way. <br>What does that mean?<br>I am genuinely interested in what you think jokes that stem from Japanese porn culture would look like if they excluded 3D over 2D or vice versa.<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128819225#p128838537">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People are forgetting this gem</br>  <br> gakkou gurashi is the only thing i'm really enjoying at all this season, and it has serious flaws. charlotte could end up being good, but it's unlikely. <br><br>Had no doubts.</br></br></br>  Daimidaler was fun for like one episode. It went quickly to shit after that.<br>Shimoneta is still pretty strong after 4 episodes.</br>  <br><br>Sauce for anime</br></br>  Who is the smartest character out there?    Next episode Murderfish incoming, some people is going to hate it and others gonna love it (specially TF).<br><br>The playlist with specials (actually 20, this guys throw one after another):<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?li<wbr>st=PLaWNUYckT3OPH6k_Ow2FB1CwijLzU3b<wbr>7p<br><br>And the character songs of every girl<br><br> Miia <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oeZ<wbr>A87zIICk</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Papi <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=e3R<wbr>xycLwmnQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> Cerea (I'm spiderfag but I love this one) <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=qJO<wbr>Q2siJ2j4</wbr>  [ ]<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128832704#p128832704">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br> I'm sorry, but I'm the best </br>  <br>Deceptive rapeslime, looking all pure 'n stuff.</br>    <br> Go ahead, call the cops <br> They can't un-rape you </br></br>  <br> Mero's Character Song </br>  So what exactly is a post-evangelion biter?

Pic related.  <br>All girls have their charm points. Mari really grew on me with her bitchy behavior, Ice Queen persona and vulcano hot body.</br>  <br><br>The only thing I don't like about her are her Tits. They don't look natural, or something any human would willingly have. They look like the worst plastic paps turned up to 11, like one of those reality porn stars would have them.</br></br>  <br>Kate has two belly buttons.</br>  <br>she's the only reason I picked up this manga back in 2011</br>  <br>I love her udders and how they keep getting bigger.</br></blockquote>]
