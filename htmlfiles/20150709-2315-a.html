[ It's up. Fujitora confirmed for best admiral.  <br>Fujitora is pretty much rebelling against the usual shilling of the WG</br>  oh, he's pissed  <br>I repeat.<br><br>"Nothing Happens" - The Chapter</br></br></br>  <br>Pretty damn sure that isn't what they actually said and pangamanda just fucked it up as usual.</br>  He isn't going to actually kill or even try to kill Ruffy and Raw.    Post battle is always my favorite part of an arc. We get the glimpse of whatever the hell happened on the other side of the world like other pirates, world goverment and such  Fujitora for the next SH<br><br> useful devil fruit, can make the thousand sunny float with his low gravity then coup de burst into space <br> his dream aligns with Luffy's morals <br><br>try to deny it</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not Rufi and Ravv <br><br>end yourself</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure the gravity is just a sword technique.</br>  <br>reverse troll detected<br><br>while in some chapters, literally nothing happens - this is not one of them, tons of things happened</br></br></br>   OP hiatus again next week. <br>Fuck you Oda</br>   Next cover story is about the Donquixote family   what was the deal with Kuzan and blackbeard??<br><br>Is Kuzan now affiliated with blackbeard?</br></br>  <br>Nope. It will be monet and vergo.</br>  I swear the mangapanda translation should become its own canon  <br> still posting this stale meme </br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br> while in some chapters, literally nothing happens <br>not even that is true you faggot</br></br>  daily reminder how germany raped OP names.<br>Affe D. Ruffy<br>Lysopp<br>Scharfschützen König = Sogeking<br>Fliegendes Lamm = Going Merry<br>Tausend Sonnen = Thousand Sunny<br>Tony Tony Zerhacker = Chopper<br>Raucher = Smoker</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's the point you dickhead, speedfags need the world to go down in OP for them to acknowledge "something happened".</br>  <br>He's capturing the Impel Down escapees who had a devil fruit and storing them in ice on Punk Hazard for their fruits to be taken later.</br>  This translation was even worse than usual. I have no fucking idea what was being discussed half the time.<br><br><br>That probably is what they said, but Fujitora's line is ambiguous. It can be interpreted as "yes, I wanted authority to bring in Law and Luffy", but it can also be interpreted as "yes, thank you for confirming for me that you're a a government shill".</br></br></br>  <br> Affe D. Drache = Dragon <br> Schwarzbart = blackbeard <br> Weißbart = Whitebeard <br> Lorenor Zorro  <br>Herr 0 aka Das Krokodil = Crocodile<br>Bon Curry<br>Trafalger D. Wasser Gesetz</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Good stuff  <br>About one break a month, so Oda doesn't die. This will likely be the standard for the rest of the series, so better get used to it.</br>  <br> Post battle is always my favorite part of an arc. We get the glimpse of whatever the hell happened on the other side of the world like other pirates, world goverment and such <br>And then we have to sit through 5 more years of pointless batlle arcs.</br></br>  <br>What the fuck is wrong with this translation? This is worse than last week's.</br>  <br>His output the last few months has been pretty fucking on though. Minimal breaks. Shorter chapters at times.</br>  <br>did they mention any of these things earlier ? where did i miss this.. or was this one of those cover page pictures</br>  <br>Be fair. It was nigh on unreadable last week. This is an improvement.</br>  <br>SANJI HAD TO BE SAVED<br>SANJI FAGS EPICLY BTFO HAHAHHAAHAJ</br></br>  I'M GOING TO MURDER SOMEBODY  <br><br><br>You gotta be kidding me. Are Germans retarded or something?</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck was up with today's mangapanda translation, I didn't even understand half of what they said. What did Fuji meant in the last page ? Shit, guess I'll wait for Niggastream.</br>  Holy fuck, the translation was pure and utter gibberish.  <br> Gorosei being a puppet of world nobles <br>Secret illuminati noble counsil when?</br></br>  imho BB will use Kid to weaken Shanks military power, being honest Kid can't go down seeing how he have an even bigger hype than Law, and Shanks is just Shanks, BB promised us a fight and there must be a fight.   mfw reading mangapanda <br><br>I literally couldn't understand half of the chapter<br><br>how are these people allowed to breathe?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Cover Story: Monet's Snowy Orphanage <br><br>I want to believe.</br></br></br>  <br> BB will use Kid <br>Since when was he Teach's bitch?</br></br>  a GOAT chapter completely raped by shitpanda. <br><br>I swear to god i am done with these chinks. Google translate would probably be more accurate.<br><br>niggerstream save me from my anger.</br></br></br></br>   this translation <br>when the fuck is somebody better than panda going to translate this shit quickly</br>  <br>They're shitting you.</br>  ALL HAIL LORD KAIDO!  <br>The translation was horrible, some parts were at Zero Wing level of bad.</br>  <br> I'm pretty sure the gravity is just a sword technique. <br> As feasible as that might sound in-universe, no </br></br>  <br>Weren't these guys going after Big Mom? Or is Kid really giving up his campaign of terror to go pick a fight he can't win?</br>  <br>there always is a break after 4 consecutive chapters, so there will be a chapter next week you fucking newfag</br>  <br><br>I missed that part</br></br>  Who else translating one piece besides mangapanda and mangastream?  I hate myself for being such an impatient faggot that I always read shitpanda when it comes out instead of waiting a few hours for niggerstream  <br>Just being chaotic in general probably he was rather notorious for it, and stealing some of her ships' cash perhaps.</br>  <br>Viz</br>  This shit is almost Duwang tier  <br> your mum, that who </br>  <br>powermanga<br>their quality is GOAT but they are slow as fuck</br></br>  <br>nigga its on break next week. deal with it. oda's wife needs the D bad.</br>  <br>Look at the Capone panels, hes on big moms ship and tlling someone that their buddies are busy.</br>  <br>he's just going to join sengoku and leave the marines, akainu is losing his men by being so zealous.<br><br>Fujitora will be the new jimbei.</br></br></br>  <br>based Stephen</br>  <br>man zoro isn't even tired, he can stop fujitora, or well, more like Big Mom will after all, if he really intends to grab luffi and law.</br>  <br>redon actually translated the chapter into a summary. It's legible, the transation is simple so it can be understood, but a bit long so in a few minutes I can post it</br>  <br>You'd think she's rich enough to get some quality D whenever she wanted without bothering him.</br>  <br>today was the final straw for me. such goodness completely smeasred with panda shit. i have leaned the pain of sabo's and issho's victory for the last time.</br>  Where the fuck is Kizaru?  <br>The sword ate the fruit.</br>  <br>Now I'm quite sure this is quite different from what he actually said</br>  <br>You say that now, but the week after the next you'll continue to spread chaos across the country.</br>  <br> campaign of terror <br>Kid is just hot headed, civilians are just an annoyance when fighting, he was picking a fight agains BM iirc.<br><br>Also I believe they have a fair chance against Shanks, but from a reader standpoint we know he will not be the one who defeat the yonkou.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Didn't they stop translating a while ago?</br>  I cannot deal with the shitty mangapanda translation anymore.<br><br>I'll just have to wait for mangastream.</br></br>  How can anyone shamelessly translate this shit so badly? You cant call this english  <br>No it didn't there was a panel with him eating ramen with both hands while floating his battle ship</br>  <br>japanese divorce law ain't as one-sided as america's. she can;t afford to risk this gravy train.</br>  <br>no</br>  <br> Be fair. It was nigh on unreadable last week. This is an improvement. <br>No. No it is not</br></br>  <br>Lay off the NTR mango anon, IRL a woman who jumped the fence in Nippon would be chased down with pitches and forks.</br>  <br> Being this much of an Ntr fag that you get off by ruining real families <br><br>Apply yourself</br></br></br>  <br>I know you have to buy them but do the Viz translations get posted here like the other ones?</br>  <br>Probably off enjoying life.</br>   yfw next chapter <br> cut to 'interim captain' sanji jobbing once again <br>Just</br></br>  <br><br><br>Well damn.</br></br></br>  <br>You can't even use meme properly</br>  <br>He has a fruit in the chopsticks as well.</br>  Wait so Smoker-san has been undercovered in Crocodile's territory for 2 years? Does this mean that Crocodile was reinstated as a warlord?  <br>She wouldn't know the american procedure on this matters.</br>  <br>Yes, and somehow nobody is able to recognize Smoker despite him being fucking famous and Crocodile knowing him personally.</br>  <br> Also I believe they have a fair chance against Shanks <br><br>I can't see Apoo or Hawkins even being able to fight Shanks' crew members, let stick around in a fight Shanks himself. <br><br>I see no way for these guys to beat Shanks unless Blackbeard steps in.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They mean he was in Alabasta 2 years ago<br><br>shitpanda is shit</br></br></br>  <br>Do not trust Mangapanda, like, ever.</br>  <br>Pretty sure he meant back before the straw hats showed up in alabasta.</br>  <br>The sword was out of its scabbard, and planted in the ship. That's how Fujitora made it fly.</br>  just read chink translations to confirm some points that got mistranslated..<br><br>1) sakauki said "dont you dare show up at any of the marine bases unless he "deals with" law and luffy<br><br>2) fujitora says something along the lines of fine by me in response but i feel like it implies he won't be returning for a while<br><br>3) Kuzan is indeed sided with blackbeard now.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Snails are moving <br><br>All in all a bretty gud translation. 8/10</br></br></br></br>  <br>You remember where that is vaguely?</br>  <br>sai &amp; baby 5's honeymoon</br>  <br>imma be strong for the sake of my sanity mate. i was literally yelling at my monitor by the end. too much pic related every week.</br>  <br> I see no way for these guys to beat Shanks unless Blackbeard steps in. <br>I think that's exactly what is about to happen.<br>Edge alliance is probably going to get blown off by Shanks while weakening them somehow and then Blackbeard steps in and pulling the Blackbeard.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I thought that inanimate objects could only be fused with Zoan type fruits.</br></br>  <br>He was talking about the Alabasta arc</br>  <br>This guys are the next gen, Kidd alone should be stronger than G5 Luffy, add the other 3 supernovas and they can at least pick a head on fight with the red haired pirates, but maybe they're just going to be trashed by Shanks, but that just sound like something Mashima would do with his Shanks clone.</br>  <br> You need me... to do what?! </br>  <br>Whatever Kuzan's doing, I'm pretty sure it's not going to end well for him.</br>  lol i went on youtube and look what i found, pic related.  <br>WHERE WHERE YOU WHEN BASED UROGUE WAS SHOWN AGAIN?</br>  <br>my standards are so low for panda. im just glad they used english words (even in a completely fucked order)</br>  <br>I don't get it.</br>  Wait did I understand the last page correctly?<br>Fuji is now gonna go after Luffy and Law? <br>How the fuck is Oda going to deal with that?</br></br>  <br>what makes you think it couldn't be a gravity zoan</br>   mfw luffy/law escape <br> mfw admiral showdown 2: electric boogaloo </br>  Pretty sure given the context of the Conversation fuji meant "thanks for telling me what I wanted to hear, confirming you're a cunt"<br><br>Also what's the point of introducing fuji if he's basically akoiji 2.0</br></br>  <br>..........</br>  Get a feeling so complicated.  <br>Wasn't that just some info given by a nobody ? I mean, Kuma got a Logia power and a Sword got a Zoan power so Vegapunk being him, I don't think giving a sword a Paramecia is unthinkable after two years of research.</br>  All these people not realising the most vital information we got<br><br>Kuzan is kicking it with KUROHIGEEEE<br><br>Fuck</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aokiji is lazy, Fujitora is active</br>  <br>They are gonna escape real quick</br>  <br>Never trust mangapanda for reliable translations. Wait for mangastream.</br>  <br>Don't take shitpanda's translations too seriously. Wait for a better translation, or just show me the raw and i'll tell ya.</br>  <br>It was given by one of cocrodile guys, i don't remember his number.</br>  <br>we already knew it from burgess and BBs earlier convo. not nearly as surprising as shanks being targetted by kid alliance especially since earler they had been attacking big mom</br>  <br>BASED FUJITORA</br>  <br>We've known that for ages.<br><br>Burgess and BB talked about it back in the tournament</br></br></br>  <br><br>she ded or not ?</br></br>  Jesus christ, this was the worst fucking translated chapter I've seen in ages. Tell me when better translations are out.  <br> Akainu having the balls to snap at the Elder Stars <br> Fuji having the integrity to point out shilling <br><br>They're both pretty based. I wonder if Green Bull will be a complete rookie or by-the-books veteran.</br></br></br></br>  <br>WATCH OUT TANJIHADO!</br>  <br>People have been pondering that since like 70-80 chapters ago</br>  <br>Fucking weeb.</br>  <br> mangastream <br> reliable </br></br>  <br> Raw <br> not Rō </br></br>  <br><br>Sabo</br></br>  <br>It helps to show that there are more people in the navy that don't agree with it's current state.</br>  <br><br>According to chink scans, which admittedly has way better translations than panda, what was actually said was<br><br> Akainu: Before you defeat "the Strawhat" and "Law", don't even think about coming back to any marine base !! <br> Fujitora: ....En, exactly how I wanted it!! <br> Akainu: !!? <br><br>It seems to imply that Fujitora might be leaving the marines too</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's a long time since we had a chapter with this bad translation.  Can someone just post the full raws?  <br>How incompetent must Akainu be, to recruit people straight into admiral rank just based on their power? Just a couple of years has passed and that shit backfired already.</br>  <br>It was given by one of cocrodile guys, i don't remember his number.<br>I thought it was more about logic, than inability. Like an object couldn't use a paramecia or a logia, but they could become animals.</br></br>  <br>ah fuck, what chapter is that?</br>  <br> insulting people who knows a language <br>Never change /a/.</br></br>  <br>They're at least accurate in meaning even if they take liberties with the phrasing.<br>Mangapanda is just nonsense</br></br>  <br>But how the fuck do you activate a Paramecia sword? By yelling at them? Doing a kata pose?  Haki? </br>   Kidd, Hawkins and Apoo VS Shanks <br>Who's ready for the desperate attempt to save him that will actually fail, but will result in the defeat of those 3?<br><br>also, Killer eating spaghetti through the mask made me chukle</br></br></br>  <br>Well yeah, but it's still better than this utter gibberish.</br>  <br>thanks for point 2 confirmation.</br>  <br>What good is a weak Admiral though? I'd imagine their strength is the #1 priority.</br>  <br> Depressing! <br><br>always gets me</br></br></br>  <br>Fuji going on to the Wano arc would be damn cool. Though he'd probably job to hype up Kaido's Crew.</br>  <br><br>Probably nepotism. He wanted people he could trust rather than just more dogs of the world nobles.</br></br>  <br>The fact is I don't understand it!</br>  <br>We already knew that since luffy first met burgess at the colusseum</br>  <br>They are also shit, but at least they use coherent sentences and appear to have at least read the work the are translating so they have some conext.</br>  <br>That's illegal.</br>  <br>they make it slang heavy but they at least get the message accross. panda cant even match google translates accuracy at this pointr</br>  <br>I believe it's supposed to be something like<br> Don't bother coming back here without Strawhat and Laws's heads. <br> That's fine by me <br>with Fujitora's response being intentionally ambiguous whether he's going to fight them or abandon the marines</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know really but I think it would be original to have a Paramecia in a sword wielded by an Admiral. <br><br> I saw someone saying that the scabbard might be in Kairouseki, and taking the sword out activated its power.  </br></br></br>  What the hell?!  <br>Saving who, Shanks? I think you should worry about those 3, not red-haired.</br>  <br><br>He should've just promoted the existing VAs, like it's been done before. You'd think that active marines are more trustworthy than just random fresh recruits.<br>Also, it's quite clear Fujitora doesn't trust Marines, or at the very least doesn't trust the Shichibukai program they're running.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh u</br>  <br> better translation <br> translator's notes <br> proper HD quality scans <br><br>fuck you</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd imagine he probably conscripted more than a few undercover revolutionaries. Fujitora might have been one of them.</br>  <br>Well now we know who the other three pirates are going after, Fuji is gonna quit, or fight Zoro. In any case we win.</br>  <br><br>This sounds plausible and believeable. Or maybe if fujitora indeed will go after luffy and law, he would probably let them escape and bullshit akainu a la garp</br></br>  <br><br>I don't think Fujitora was random. I think Sakazuki knows him.</br></br>  So, what the fuck are they doing right now?  <br>First and last time I'm spoonfeeding you</br>  <br>Well, it's a neat idea and a good simple engine. Would never think of it at least in some time.<br><br> Yes, I'm that dumb. </br></br></br>  <br>That would actually make more sense. If Fuji really wanted to capture Luffy/Law he would have done that a long time ago. Without the "gamble", and take care of Doffy himself to destroy the cage.</br>  can someone DDOS panda every wednesday/thursday till they improve this garbage effort. i might as well read raws at this point.  <br>The problem is, the VAs that are strong enough doesn't want the promotion (Garp) and the VAs that want the promotion aren't strong enough smoker and every other jobber Vice Admiral shown).</br>  <br>preparing to assassinate mingo</br>  <br>  desperate attempt to save him <br>Nah, it would probably go along something like shanks trashed those three but they managed to weakened him somehow and then blackbeard showed up, just like what he did on marineford war</br></br>  <br>Probably left Dressrosa a while ago.</br>  <br>I don't think Sakazuki would buy it.</br>  <br>Having a glass of moloko plus.</br>  <br>Fucking newfags taking mangapanda literally<br><br><br><br>Forgot the pic</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br> Trafalger D. Wasser Gesetz <br>Nice meme</br></br>   If I'm not mistaken, Doflamingo is controlling Kaido from the background <br><br>Oh come on<br>COME ON</br></br></br>  <br><br>It's true, look it up you idiot.</br></br>  <br> Affe D.

When I first read 'feel the pain of Sabo's and Issho's victory' I felt legitimately stupid, like I was missing something obvious.<br><br><br>Aokiji seems too smart for that. He sure as hell isn't by BB's side (I hope), but I doubt he would pull something like that off. Worst case scenario, he'll try to disrupt his gang by fucking his crewmates' shits up.

That is an adjustment layer</br>  <br>I remember seeing a scanlation general like 2 years ago and in the OP it had a guide on cleaning, translating etc got a link for it?</br>  <br>was it a link or an image?<br>There's this typesetting one that's kind of old:<br>There is this http://prettyanonymo.us/index.php/s<wbr>canlation-resources/anonblacks-type<wbr>setting-guide/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  What's the next most wanted job after translation?<br><br>I want to fill that demand. <br><br>Also, I want to be the guy that says 'stop putting fucking watermarks on the page it's not cool'.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think any respected group puts watermarks on pages still.</br>  <br>Cleaning and redrawing color pages</br>  <br>I'm not sure about it being the most saught after, but there's definitely a big shortage of  competent  cleaners. Depending on how good your raws are and how much care you want to take, it can range from being the least to the most time consuming task, so if you get good at making bad raws look good, you'll be a pretty big help.<br><br>Actually, thinking about it, most saught after may be redrawer in terms of recruitment demands that I see on scanlator websites and blogs, but not all groups care so much about their scans.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure but I ran into this group recently while browsing random manga. It's on every page in random places</br>  <br>that fucking bunny's face. like "what are you gonna do about it"</br>  <br><br>Ugh, doesn't that take artistic skill to erase and redraw a drawing? My hands are shaky enough as it is.</br></br>  <br>I remember that group. The bullshit they spout easily puts them among the worst drama faggots in scanlation.</br>  <br>Seems like a fairly clear indicator that their releases aren't worth reading.</br>  <br>I use the brush tool and it takes only a few seconds (shounen manga is awful since they have those huge SFXs)</br>  <br> color pages <br>Well, only if you do weekly shit with mag scans.<br><br> redrawer <br>Redrawing is the cleaner's job.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then just clean, or if you'd prefer, even just typeset to a passable standard.

Unless you seriously mess things up, any help is appreciated.</br>  <br> Redrawing is the cleaner's job. <br>If you have a small group. It's two different "jobs" but one person can do both. i prefer to do both</br></br>  <br> Redrawing is the cleaner's job. <br>It depends on the group. I think it's reasonable to expect the cleaner to handle simple stuff, but if they're to tackle big, complicated redraws, it isn't very efficient to allocate so much work to one person.</br></br>  <br>If anyone wants the Desert Punk translation I could help.

I think you should change the page scrolling a little though so that using the Up, Down, Page Up and Page Down keys have the same sort of function as they do for and offline reader like Honeyview or CDisplay.

However the only time I have seen actual errors in the image is when I save images with big white areas.<br>For instance Berserk_v34_p044-045, so I had to use pngquant instead to save the image with a limited palette.<br><br> Also, ps7 had selective. <br>Ah that explains it. Just now tested and got an identical output files as you with just changing that one setting as well as turning dither to zero (which also reduces the file size).<br><br> Sorry. <br>No problem, now I have a good reason to read up on 'selective' to find out the pros and cons</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Look on MangaHelpers.</br>  <br><br> Implying all those implications <br><br>m8 pls.</br></br></br></br>  <br> After trying both pngoutwin (xtreme setting) and pngpress it seems pngoutwin ouputs the smaller size, at least when I tried both your and my p16 images (1.83vs1.79 and 2.01vs1.96). <br>Yeah, pngout at extreme making it smaller. But it require much more time for it, and with smaller scans (i.e. x1200-x1800) difference will be no more than 1-5 kb at best while waiting time will be at least twice as more. With one file it might not be a big problem, but when you have to deal with 50-1000+...</br></br>  <br> 32-pallet index .png and save in 1200p - 1800p <br>1800 should work for most manga. But saving in 1200 pixels (unless magazine raw) in 2015 would seems kind of strange to me.</br></br>  <br> But it require much more time for it <br>Yea, its always a trade-off, and those few kb might not be worth it most of the time.</br></br>  <br>Thank you based anon. There are actually 2 chapters translated on there that aren't released.<br>I'll buy the raws now then</br></br>  <br>Cool. You might want to send the translator a PM to let him know you're doing it so he'll start to translate more, it got put on hold because no one cared enough to work on it.</br>  <br> it got put on hold because no one cared enough to work on it. <br>Really?<br>I'll definitely let him know then</br></br></br>  HoneyView has ugly fucking default filters/scaling options that can't be turned off, but CDisplay sucks at handling nested archives. Is there no middle ground?  <br>Even more if you just have to deal with png saved in RGB and just want to make them grayscale and maybe reduce size a little after that. I use crushpng for it and for example getting 62 files of Fujiyama-san wa Shishunki (chapters 45-47) from 61.8 to 23,7 in ~1 minute. They won't get much smaller (if at all) after that anyway, so there's no point in wasting time.</br>  <br>I use mangameeya7 I don't know if it will fix those problems that you said but it's been great for me</br>  <br>No problem.<br> If he says he's too busy with other stuff, blame me. I'm working on like three or four things with him. </br></br>  <br>Your efforts are greatly appreciated. Honto has a lot of ebooks campaigns.</br>  How do I get past broken adfly links? A self-important group has their releases behind them ("not allowed to rehost anywhere else, hurrr"). I put v2. in front of the link, still broken.  <br>Some guy cracked Honto on e-hentai. It outputs to a T-Time book apparently. At least when they did it. <br><br>https://forums.e-hentai.org/index.p<wbr>hp?showtopic=29160&amp;st=0<br><br>I saw some a thread just now about a guy looking about breaking Cypherguard PDF and just happened upon it. By doing so, he also broke tons of other people. Interesting, does warrant some investigation. Reverse engineering assembly is a bitch.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Honto uses both epub and T-Time books. It would be great if this guy found a solution for the epub files as well, if they use a different method from the TT files.</br>  <br>I'm guessing he just inputs in whatever encoded format it came in, and it just pops out regardless of the format. From reading the thread, the reason he doesn't want to share his method appears to be so he can get more credit off e-hentai galleries himself.</br>  <br>Also these un-screenshotable, un-VMable PDF sound really amusing, I really want to just crack one for the hell of it.</br>  <br>How much credit could you want? What do you even do with it?<br>I have a shitton of credits from uploading a couple galleries and it's just sitting there, growing every day.</br></br>  I already asked this in the Gangsta. thread, but that's pretty much devolved into a troll thread, so I'll just link it here.<br><br>  <br><br>Help a guy out, please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad. All I've managed to do are screenshots. I'd kill for a way to directly extract the files.</br>  <br>Who knows. E-peen, I guess. I got more than enough credit playing Hentaiverse when I was bored for a week.</br>  <br>It looks like people have been trying for years, and this guy looks like the only person to have ever publicly broken it.</br>  <br>It doesn't look like it. A guy would hope that the measly amount of licensed manga would get scanned, but nope. No one cares to even rip digital manga which eliminates the time to scan it, and some of the price. Seriously, I myself have ripped a few and there's only a few people who even bother altogether.</br>  <br><br>You can use credits/hath to pay for translations, editing, scanning, etc. and also buy features in the gallery. It's a fiat currency designed so that people actually contribute. If you think about it too hard, they really are worthless, but everyone has given them value (hence fiat currency), so it's understandable that some people might want to become billionaires if they have a method. Think of all the doujinshi scanlations you could "buy."</br></br>  <br>Also, complaints about shit digital offerings, or bad resolution, something is usually better than nothing.</br>  <br><br>I don't think many people know how to rip licensed scans. Iirc there was only one guy who was doing weekly jump rips, and I don't think he wanted to share his method.</br></br>  <br>Ripping weekly jump is easy, just look in the archive. For other stuff, just buy it on Kindle or some other store that's already got a ripper available.</br>  <br>People do the stupidest ways of doing it from what I know. Some people use fiddler and shit like that, when in fact they can DL the entire zip file of images if they knew how. I've tried explaining how to do it, but I guess it's too complicated for the normal person. I would've thought basic URL hacking wasn't beyond the normal guy, but apparently not.</br>  <br>Also note, this wasn't actually an option until last year. Before that, it actually was annoying to rip Viz manga from Viz (but it only really needed a cookie). <br><br><br>Unfortunately Kindle and Kobo rips aren't the same, and I don't mean in terms of resolution. Viz has better redraws of some of their series which it seems they keep to themselves. So one isn't necessarily better than the other. I know that /co/ guys ripping Bakuman opted for the Viz rips for this reason.</br></br></br></br>  <br> hen in fact they can DL the entire zip file of images if they knew how <br>All the methods I've seen have been one image at a time and I haven't really had the time to play round with it. Any chance you'd try to explain one more time, anon?</br></br>  <br><br>Then I guess it comes down to who has the money and is willing to buy the ebooks. I know that you can refund Kindle books, but I think they'll crack down on you if you try that shit too often.</br></br>  <br>I generally share any ebooks I rip when I want to use them myself in scanlation, but those are Japanese only by default.<br><br><br> Also note, this wasn't actually an option until last year. Before that, it actually was annoying to rip Viz manga from Viz (but it only really needed a cookie). <br>Well that explains why I didn't see anything about getting a zip file.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Google Play allows refunding. I was going to try doing that with Dementia 21 and found some other flaw in their system (which meant I only bought some, not all).<br><br><br>http://www.vizmanga.com/manga/get_m<wbr>anga_url?manga_id=1140&amp;device_id=1<br><br>Replace the manga_id and set the device_id=1 which will cause it to return the iOS zip. Other numbers do different things, device_id=3 is the default I think with the reader. You have to be logged in like usual.</br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I forgot all about Dementia 21. I wonder how many other series quietly get an ebook release. For example, Cobra.<br><br>www.amazon.com/COBRA-Blue-Rose-Buic<wbr>hi-Terasawa-ebook/dp/B0111G81AC/ref<wbr>=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=<wbr>1436223130&amp;sr=1-1</wbr></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>I should say that the method worked at least during the 3 or 4 weeks WSJ was free, so I don't see any reason it doesn't work in general. It also worked for the Viz manga I bought to test once.</br>  <br> Dementia 21 <br><br>Already ripped.</br></br></br>  <br>I saw that as well. Global Bookwalker just put up a bunch. Kaiji part 1, although done fairly badly. But fairly badly is better than nothing at all, I mean like how did we ever have DUWANG. <br><br>I was actually in the middle of ripping Cynical Hysterie Hour which is on Rakuten. Free 450 yen for each new account. There's also this F manga which I was considering ripping.<br><br><br>By me.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Usually once digishit riped no one cares to properly scan such series after that. Shitty digital raws regressing scanlation back to 00-x. Just look at this  guy.</br>  <br>Is there any digital color Toriko raws yet?</br>  <br> no one cares to properly scan <br>Thing is, it doesn't meant that someone was going to scan it in the first place.</br></br>  <br>Thank you, based anon. Going to have to remember that.</br>  <br>Possibility wasn't zero. But day one, or even week one rips making it into negative numbers territory.</br>  <br>That's a fair enough complaint. That's what happens when people aren't fussed over mediocrity (or well less than that). <br><br>For the most part, digital by the major publishers isn't much worse than scanlation, if at all. Translation isn't that bad these days and there's certainly no Tokyopop to complain about. Editing is probably worst still, as well as typesetting. At this point I could say, you can still use the scripts, but well, most people would just say, good enough.</br></br></br>  <br> and there's certainly no Tokyopop to complain about <br>I've got bad news for you anon.</br></br>  <br>Oh yes, I heard. For now, at least.</br>  <br>True, but let's be honest. It's either digital shit or shitty scan done on that cheap scanner situation, if we're talking about public. For actual, good scan you have to go to people who scan manga on general basis, not trying to net something in the public.<br><br>I don't think they'll stay alive for long.</br></br></br>  <br>All I hope is that Japan steps up on the resolution. Fucking hell, some of those images are still for ants.</br>  <br>For digital, that is.</br>  <br>They using jpgs with low quality, pdfs, low resolution scans (fuck you, alphapolis, fuuuuuuuk yoooooooouuuu!), and all other methods that making it harder to read or even just watch.<br>It's like they hate digital distribution and making sure that readers will get worst possible deal. Oh, wait...</br></br>  <br>Funnily enough, I bet you 90% of the time, they have the full size images on the same server. And they lose all benefits of smaller pages with all their DRM bullshit, base64 encoding and shitty readers which will literally download a file 3 times before it actually loads.</br>  <br>Japan is actually doing that, at least on ebj, but it doesn't mean that they're going to upgrade old stuff that's been released in lower res.<br><br>I'm not sure, that's quite retarded amount of data that has to be resized every single damn time for every user.</br></br></br>  <br>Eycuse the stupid questions, but since the scanning topic came up. How to I properly scan and save? I've done some scans, but reading this thread it seems I coulddo better in the future, especially the saving part.<br><br>I gather that I should always scan in grayscale and save as png, but the correct settings are not quite clear. I use windows7, cs4 and a canon lide 210 if that matters.</br></br></br>  <br>*Excuse</br>  <br>No, I mean they store it separately in compressed form, alongside. Although I'm aware of some that do it on the fly - this isn't as bad as it sounds with a good caching system I'm sure. Sometimes URL hacking gets you the files, but it's a complete shot in the dark most of the time.</br>  <br>I wouldn't put it past them. Nips can't into computers and coding. Just look at their sites and readers. Or look at amazon.jp<br>http://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00YQMBE<wbr>GC/<br>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images<wbr>/I/91ggujmuWPL._SL1500_.jpg<br>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images<wbr>/I/91ggujmuWPL.jpg</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  <br>Well, I sent him a message. I hope he's okay with it</br>  <br><br>Scan with IrfanView, make sure all of your scanner's adjustment settings are turned off/neutral, make sure the scanner glass bed is clean, make sure the paper is clean, save as .tif and let the editor handle the settings after.</br></br>  <br> can't into computers and coding <br>Mostly. But the niggas who did it well, know what the fuck they are doing.</br></br>  <br>I tell new typesetters to avoid text boxes as it keeps them from getting lazy and relying too much on the automatic lining of text boxes. In the end, if you're lining the text manually and it looks good, it doesn't matter what you're doing. Again, just to keep new people from getting bad habits.<br><br>Physically altering bubbles is totally fine; I've done it a few times, too. However, a lot of TSers don't know how to do that without fucking up the pixels or making it look natural, so I didn't cover image editing in the guide. Again, if it looks good, go for it, man.<br><br>I do know about layer masks, but it's quicker and easier for me personally to just use the erase tool (E -&gt; click -&gt; enter -&gt; erase -&gt; done) instead of having to do additional mousework. I almost never change text position or content after finishing a block, so I never see the need to go out of my way to put down a layer mask. But again, if it works for you and looks good, knock yourself out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He'll be fine with it, he just gets annoyed when people ignore the big red "please shoot me a note when you're using my translations" at the top of them.<br><br><br>Layer masking can be done by just clicking one of the little buttons in the Layers panel and then pretending your brush is an eraser.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes some sense as for backup. Still shitload of data though. Assuming that one tank in full res is, let's say 700MB for example, all manga on ebj is taking 51.7TB. Or is it not that much these days? I honestly don't know.</br>  <br><br>I'm just waiting for Google to invent some new ridiculous compression algorithm that revolutionizes the internet.</br></br>  <br>Thanks for the advice. I'll try that the next time.</br>  <br>I guess it's just as fast, then, since you're gonna be using your mouse to mask anyways, but for me personally, it's just quicker to erase, since my hands are on the keyboard already.<br><br>I'd be down for making a corollary to the guide with alternative techniques. If you guys have any TS advice you'd want to shove in the guide, I'd be totally down to making one more.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Make sure that Irfanview is selecting your scanner's default TWAIN, and not whatever bullshit software came with your scanner.</br></br>  <br>It's got to be stored somewhere. EBJ I can tell you is particularly retarded since it has like multiple delivery mechanisms and different DRM alternatives. They store at least 3 or 4 versions and the original probably doesn't make much of a difference. EBJ is one of the bigger vendors (which means they usually know their shit better, but experience has not always confirmed this), so perhaps less likely to have the original files there.</br>  <br> relying too much on the automatic lining of text boxes <br>I'm a little confused about this. When you say this, you mean people just paste the text into the box and leave it as is?</br></br>  <br> You set cropping and levels, scan this page, and then just change page and scan again without changing anything. Levels will be the same for every page, which is good. <br> For example (using epson software): you place page on scanner, outline that area with something, then preview page in scanner http://i.imgur.com/mHhA9CO.jpg set cropping and levels (and then save those parameters just in case), then scan that page http://i.imgur.com/nIuLrLO.jpg (same page without levels http://i.imgur.com/xahIlqy.jpg), and then without closing preview or changing anything, turn/place another page on scanner in that outlined area and press “scan” again http://i.imgur.com/EGK5MCG.jpg. For all intends and purposes, scanner will be thinking that you scan the same page again and again. <br><br>As for saving, it depends what you will be doing with it. Of course better save them as grayscale png/tiff, but it can take a lot of space and might be not reasonable to upload/download for you or for other peoples, so in that case use jpg.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They either copy and paste it from the script or type it in manually, but let the box/program do the lining.</br>  <br> (E -&gt; click -&gt; enter -&gt; erase -&gt; done) <br>I use M -&gt; click&amp;drag -&gt; F2.</br></br>  <br> type it in manually <br>I refuse to believe that there are people like that, unless they do translation and typesetting on the fly.</br></br>  <br>Noted, thanks.<br><br><br>That what I've been doing so far, but it seems that leveled scans and jpg files are not that popular with the people who have to edit the pages later.</br></br></br></br>  <br> unless they do translation and typesetting on the fly <br>I do that for a few series that are so easy to translate I can just look at the bubble and type what comes into my head.</br></br>  <br>Basically, yeah. Lining is how you separate a block of text line by line. There are tons of ways to do it so it looks nice, and a lot of ways you can fuck it up - for example, ending a sentence in the middle of a line. <br><br>The problem with text boxes (and the reason I tell new TS to stay away from them) is the algorithm for automatically breaking a block of text into lines is shitty as all hell, pic related.<br><br><br>I actually type everything in manually for a few reasons:<br>- editing my translation on the fly<br>- personally easier to hit return after typing versus adding returns after pasting<br>- used to doing it that way after 7 years<br><br>It's pretty pants-on-head retarded in terms of speed, but I type pretty fast (120wpm) so I haven't really had too much of an issue with it, besides one or two typos every once in a while.<br><br>I'd definitely recommend copy-pasting from the corrected script and adding carriage returns manually. Smarter, faster.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> but it seems that leveled scans and jpg files are not that popular with the people who have to edit the pages later <br>That depends on how much leveed, how big resolution, and how high jpg quality. If anything, jpg is a last resort even at 600+ dpi, so if you or people who will download it don't have any troubles with big files then there's no reason to not use png/tiff. Just pack chapters into archives and with maximum compression.<br>As for levels, you just have to find page with weak black/white screentones (preferable on one page and set levels so they don't remove most faint printed spots and then scan all pages with those levels.</br></br></br>  Can anyone please translate Umareru Kachi?

If that's the case, then just give him the unaltered raws (not leveled, not filtered, not cropped, not rotated).<br>If you do public scans, you can either level the pages or just not bother doing any work and upload the unaltered raws.</br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. I can get to almost all the tools I need with my left hand (B, E, D, X, S, T) and use my mouse with the right. Saves so much time.

I usually do public scans. I think I'll leave them unaltered just in case.</br>  <br>the only other thing i can think of possibly covering is defining patterns/using pattern overlays to add some style to your type, or using brushes to mask your type to add effect to them. plain type on a page is boring. you have to be creative. i felt plenty of times that i was ruining the aesthetics just by localizing an author's work.</br>  just a test scan. pic related is what I did before and this is the unaltered tiff version: http://i.imgur.com/0jSpkwv.jpg  <br><br> unaltered tiff <br> posts jpg </br></br></br>  <br>...

If you've got issues 4 and 5, I could use the Godspeed color pages in those. I've also been wanting to read the new series from the author of Instant Bullet, I think it started last month? That might be a bit much if you don't want to scan a full chapter though.<br>Anyway, if you want settings, for the color pages I usually go with 600dpi, all filters turned off, saved as jpg.

I can see the petition just fin.</br></br></br></br>  <br>How about we EH and YH fags compromise? Ymir could be a godmother to EH's baby and spend time with Historia when she's not busy having sex with Eren. Does that sound fair?</br>  <br>I approve this shit tbh.</br>  <br>How about Eren provides the seed for Ymir and Historia's child</br>  <br>No. We will compromise when one of the ships is canon. No hard feelings until or after then though.</br>  <br>Ymir could be a good aunt, since she and Historia are pratically sisters.</br>  The chapter at least confirmed that Grisha was from outside the walls. That was something everyone had assumed already but it's still important that it got confirmed. And there's that bit at the end with Keith telling them what Carla said about Eren, it will probably bring confident Eren back after his self-doubt streak ever since Rod told him all that stuff.  <br>I prefered the idea that Grisha was from within the walls and was just determined to find out the truth and change things.</br>  We just had an entire chapter dedicated to cucking and you guys cannot accept the fact that Ymir is going to get cucked by Eren.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127818874 <br>What? Is this a serious post? I can't tell.</br>  <br>Shouldn't you actually like someone to be cucked?</br>  <br>Google it, Tumblr turd.</br>  <br>There are so many idiots in this world, you can't possibly blame it on one person. You can always say "Oh there was that one time that that one person did this." and try to generalize the entire group but there's no way you can do that. Some doctor burned a guys penis off and turned him into a girl instead, upon waking the man became depressed and committed suicide. Does that make all doctors bad?</br>  <br>The YHfags stopped reading the manga after Ymir took off, that's why they don't realize how canon EH is.</br>  At lot of people seems to think that Grisha was a spy, but to me he looked like he flew away from titan village. His memory loss could be the result of the reiss coordinator, and it came back for some reason. He then decided to work on a way to save mindless titans, and he lost it the day Shiganshina was attacked. He went to the chapel to ask Frieda to use the coordinator, but she refused due to the will of the first king. Then he killed everyone and stole the coordinator. After learning Carla's death, he went full retard and decided to give Eren the coordinator.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127818874 <br> Implying Ymir isn't man enough to be a father </br>  <br>No we had a pity chapter for Keith, since he obviously will die soon and Isayama wants us to feel bad about it.</br>  <br><br>How did they managed to read all the chapters before Ymir was even a proper character?</br></br>  <br> After learning Carla's death, he went full retard and decided to give Eren the coordinator. <br>More seriously, why did he decide the give Eren the coordinator?</br></br>  <br>Grisha was a mindless titan who lost his memory after eating a shifter, just like Ymir and Eren did.</br>  <br>Anon, sjws are a organization of mad and delusional as fuck womyn where shit like this happen all the time. It's not a isolated case.</br>  <br>He was obviously lying about not remembering anything.</br>  <br><br><br>could grisha be the master trickster</br></br></br>  <br>But that's SJWs.<br>Not everyone that likes yuri is an SJW, I agree SJWs are practically all insane, but why should that make me feel bad about wanting my ship to happen?</br></br>  <br>No, it looked like he was escaping from somewhere.</br>  <br>It's okay unless you do shit like this.</br>  <br>Yeah and hiding what he really knew seemed believable since he didn't know about human customs, currency, the SL, etc so everyone assumed he had amnesia.</br>  <br>That's clearly a joke though.</br>  <br> ymir is a dyke/man <br>Is shitposting by now.</br></br>  Maybe Grisha actually lost most of his memory.<br><br>maybe he was supposed to ruin the walls and destroy humanity like BRA but bumped his head and just forgot.<br><br>It's possible.</br></br></br></br>  <br>No xhe isn't. Xhe is a weak beta male who decided to become a womyn.</br>  We still don't have a translated chapter? The fuck is going on here?  <br>His bruises imply he probably escaped from somewhere.</br>  <br>Grisha is the Iron Giant?</br>  <br><br>CR scans.</br></br>  <br>Alright Tumblr turdie.</br>  <br>yeah basically.<br><br><br>from fighting all the random non shifter titans that caused him to bump his head</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're making good points but I still don't think generalizing is the answer. If you're just going to throw insults at me for trying to be rational then that's your problem.

So amusing, thread had like 10 decent normal posts. and litteraly everything else was shitposting... god i miss when SnK had bareable threads  <br>How can you miss something that was never there?</br>  <br>They obviously fucked up cleaning that panel, retard.</br>  <br>How did this turn into this?</br>  So did Grisha accidently eat a shifter?  <br><br>My two favorite characters and still MIA ;_;</br></br>  What's interesting about Keith's flashback is that how Grisha seemingly never let on that he was anything more than a doctor. <br><br>He clearly regained some memories that led him to kill the Reiss family, or was lying the entire time.<br><br>And the sequencing of events we learned from this chapter... so did Grisha go to Reiss family church to interrupt their ritual (what were they doing in there anyway?) at the exact same time BRA decided to attack Wall Maria? That's hell of a coincidence. <br><br>I think basically everything hinges on where the fuck Monkey Trouble and BRA come from, it's likely that Grisha escaped from there, although the "he was a mindless titan that ate a shifter" theory is good too.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  When will annie become a nun?  <br> or was lying the entire time <br>Probably this. Didn't he say he forgot because he was drunk? That seems more like a shitty coverup excuse to me.<br><br>Grisha is probably related to MT and the BRA village somehow.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is it possible that the monkey is Annies father?</br>  <br>Doesn't look even close to what her father looked like.</br>  <br>He looks related to Grisha. Might be his father, Eren's grandfather.</br>  <br>What I don't understand is why didn't Grisha remain the coordinate? He obviously knows more information than Eren or the SL will never know. Why did he give that power to a little boy? Grisha's titan was just as powerful as Eren's, if not more, so with his power and knowledge combined he probably would've had a clear mission in mind and accomplished more at a faster rate.</br>  <br> so did Grisha go to Reiss family church to interrupt their ritual (what were they doing in there anyway?) at the exact same time BRA decided to attack Wall Maria? <br>The attack happened &gt; Grisha went to the church</br></br>  <br>The only thing I can think of is that people within the walls would think Grisha was the enemy and realise he came from outside the walls if he tried shit. Eren at least had a chance to earn their trust since he was in the military. Grisha could just pass on everything he knew in writing to Eren.<br><br> The basement <br><br>GET TO THE FUCKING BASEMENT ALREADY</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Grisha's titan was just as powerful as Eren's <br>Remember that Grisha gave Eren a serum which could be super unique somehow.</br></br>  God these threads are awful.  REMINDER! Grisha or Carla were confirmed to be a Reiss in chapter 71. That means Eren and Historia are related, which proves that the movie is canon (it says Eren and Historia's Japanese name have a brother-sister relationship ONLY).<br><br>Status of EH = BTFO.</br></br>  <br>True. He'd probably be suspicious. But if his mission was important enough to die over and to turn his son into a titan I don't know why he'd let a few suspicious humans get in his way. Whatever he's trying to accomplish was important enough to die over, so if I were him I don't think I'd entrust that responsibility over to my clueless son. However, Eren might learn everything he knows when he gets to the basement, so it probably doesn't make a huge difference in the end. Still, it's a risky gamble. <br><br><br>I actually don't remember that. I thought he just turned him into an ordinary mindless titan so he could eat him.</br></br></br></br>  isn't there some theory about cancer? maybe Grisha had his lifespan shortened drastically because of the coordinate?  <br>Coordinate owners age a lot faster and die sooner.</br>  <br>Are you sure it's not a thing for shifters in general?</br>  <br>There's some evidence that suggest titan shifters live shorter lifespans. Reiner said they live shorter lives iirc and Uri seemed to have aged quicker than Kenny (or maybe he just looked unhealthy because he was sick). There's some theories about the titan serums being cancerous.</br>  <br>But BRA said they're short lived too.</br>  <br>It could be also if they use their shifting ability too much and especially abilities like hardening.</br>  <br>Maybe, maybe the coordinate power requires way more energy from its user when used to their lifespan decreases faster.</br>  <br>Could explain why Rod couldn't become a titan. He was already too old and would've died pretty quickly.</br>  <br>Or he was too pussy and didn't want to die of shifter cancer and let his daughter do it instead</br>  <br>I was thinking the same at first, but i'm not so sure anymore after Historia saw his memories.</br>  <br>He changed. He became a pussy that would run away while his family was being slaughtered</br>  <br>Who knows. He might have done it himself if he could.</br>  <br>Rod an oozing, pile of shit.</br>   read last thread in archive  <br> mfw I have no face <br>So are the "EHfags" just people who really hate Ymir and Historia and want to further ruin any chance of discussion concerning either character or what?</br></br>  <br>Pretty much.<br>There might be a few who actually ship them and care but otherwise that's all they do.</br></br>  <br> Blaming only EHfags <br>YHfags derail the threads just as much, if not more, and are more obnoxious. If you honestly think EHfags were worse in that thread you need to go through it again more carefully. <br><br> are the "EHfags" just people who really hate Ymir and Historia <br>Not all.

A generalization of "even" I guess, but I don't think it's translatable.</br>  YUTORI EDUCATION SYSTEM IS COLLAPSE OF JAPAN  <br>It can, but honestly it's just a feeling you'll get with experience when it's that and when it isn't.<br><br>Example for the emphasis usage I guess is 考えもしなかった for "didn't even consider"</br></br></br>  <br>I'm more bothered by the fact that they can't recognize Toyosaki Aki.</br>  <br> but honestly it's just a feeling <br>Yea it does seem pretty difficult to put in words.<br><br>But is that the right way to think about it? Disregarding that it's "and" here, does it make sense to put も after 我が首領の面目 to imply that it's not just anything that will 潰れる but 我が首領の面目 (!!)?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Or well, something like that anyway.</br>  <br>Man, not everyone is interested in learning Japanese, and not even an especially significant amount of people are learning it. I don't know why you're being so... retarded about something so obvious.</br>  <br>Yeah it could be emphasis, but it woudn't be what you described. Depending on the situation it could be interpreted like "It will be so bad that my lords honor will be damaged"</br>  <br> Yeah it could be emphasis, but it woudn't be what you described <br>Actually nevermind, it is approximately what you said.</br></br>  <br><br>Thanks again then.</br></br>  <br>You're a god among men and I believe I have it all fixed up, thanks a bunch.</br>  <br>Alright, So I'm planning to do a 1 hour skype lesson with a japanese native who's willing to teach (italki) Is it worth the 6 bucks? Anyone else had any experience with it?</br>  <br>two more hours you faggot.</br>  <br>yeah man<br>Fucking burger flippers get more than that</br></br>  So I'm doing Genki II kanji in anki right now, and I like it because it has common words used with the kanji in each notecard, but after I'm done, what decks are good to use that are similar?  <br>Core2k6k tae kim genki jtmw read</br>  <br> If you can't recognize any chinese characters you are either illiterate or retarded </br>  <br>Grammar has been the bane of my existence. I tried using this chart as a cheat sheet.<br><br><br>Even if TK doesnt make sense at times, I'd still love the accomplishment of finishing the stupid thing and even barey grasping what he's trying to give vague examples of. Its better as a secondary reference i guess.<br><br><br>Even if it seems like gibberish keep reading; you'll understand alot more than you think. Its just daunting as fuck when adults start talking.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Too late now I'm sleeping soon.</br>  So, I decided not to waste money going to a japanese school anymore. It was full of shit.<br><br>Should I get RTK(I need to be able to write kanji for a test) or pay for online skype lessons with natives? I'd like your opinions please!</br></br>  I would appreciate any help people could give me.<br><br>I know my hiragana/katakana. I have not started Kanji.<br><br>I started Pimsleurs Japanese, and I recently finished part 1, I could probably type very basic Japanese with an automatic Kanji thing, but the Japanese II lessons are telling me to say some things i wasn't taught in Japanese I (ie How Long, Avenue, Hat).<br><br>Although a minor annoyance, I think I should get through it fine. The most complicated thing I've learned so far is this:<br>toukyou ni sannen mae kara sundeimasu.<br><br>Some phrases they throw in there mess me up, such as:<br>ainiku, shitsure shinakereba "naranai n"* desu<br><br>*this is all audio based, I could not hear what exactly was being said<br><br>Anyway, with all this information being said, is there something I could use to accompany this, purely to learn oral japanese?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pussy.</br>  <br>stop writing in romaji</br>  Where do I into drama CDs?<br><br>Where do I find what CDs there are?<br><br>Listening practice.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Youre one of my favorite avatar fags</br>  <br>I wonder how and why you've had a chance to know 紅茶キノコ.</br>  <br>I know all of those words already anon.<br>Read something harder</br></br>   作ってはみたのですが <br><br>So is てはみた just the same as -てみる then?</br></br>  <br>No, it's not just the same. は is probably contrastive here. Example:<br>電話はしたが、何も言えなかった<br>I did call, but I couldn't say anything.</br></br></br>  I plan on knowing Japanese when I'm 30 im 24 now. I started a year ago.<br><br>Will I be able to survive with this skill?</br></br>   相手は剣の達人だ。そう簡単には勝てまい <br>I'm doing the negative volitional on TK right now, and it says that まい is either stuck on the end of a verb or a verb stem. I don't understand why then first example uses 勝て.</br>  <br><br>Yeah context would imply that, but I thought the のですが does that well enough already. So it just reinforces then, okay.</br></br>  <br>It's the stem of 勝てる, isn't it?</br>  <br>Is that a casual version of 勝っている?</br>  You learn Japanese a lot faster if you're in Japan right?<br>How long would it take to learn Japanese if I lived in Japan for a while versus just studying it in the US with textbooks and stuff? I'm thinking about saving up some money and living in Japan for six months to learn Japanese, wouldn't that be faster than solely studying from textbooks for three years or however long it would take that way?</br>  <br>It's the potential form of 勝つ.</br>  <br>Oh yeah, thanks. Now I feel dumb as fuck.</br>  <br>That's stupid<br>Ive seen so many retards just go therec thinking they will learn it yet they have to work so they can't study. They don't even look into it and just go. Look at afroman.</br></br>  <br>You learn any language faster if you keep speaking it.<br><br>Living in said country might not do a damn thing if you end up not speaking a whole lot.</br></br></br>  <br><br>But who am I speaking Japanese with in America?</br></br>  <br>I remember not realizing that either. I think it's because つ to て and ち doesn't follow the phonological pattern as る to れ and り for example.</br>  how many anons know what this is  Do you think ー週間フレンス is a good manga for a beginner? I've seen the anime so u should enjoy it. Yotsuba wasn't doing it for me.  <br>I went to high school so I know what that is.</br>  <br>Read what you enjoy.

Hey /ai/,<br>Aside from Symphogeah  don't lie, we all did , what shows did you watch that began this week?<br>I'e been pretty favourably impressed by Shirayuki, but almost dropped chaos dragon after 10 minutes. Seems too edgy for me, and something in the artstyle doesn't cut it.</br></br>  <br>Sore Ga Seiyuu is pretty good.</br>  <br>I'm mostly watching sequels this season, so they don't really count. I picked up million doll though, seems kind of cool. Locodols are /ai/ right?</br>  ded  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vAI<wbr>zaLiBogc</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>why is this allowed</br></br>        <br>I want Aoi to forcibly restrain me.

Tis picked up, thanks Anon.</br>  Oh my  What the hell is going on?  <br>Don't mind, just think of Mizuki.</br>  <br>Mizuki?</br>  And finally, creditless Akari's Epic Yarn.  Thank you Janitor-san!<br><br>Love You~</br></br>  Bananas!  I'm glad the "wings" that appear so often in the game don't appear in the anime. They're just as bad as the real thing.    <br>Better than Akari and Sumire at least.</br>  <br>Oh god, Juri is hot.</br>  <br>Only with Sumire.</br>  <br>look at the post above yours dumbass you deserve to be fucking killed</br>  For some reason, I suddenly feel like posting some Akari and Sena.  Have Sakura or Otome appeared since Sakura took the title?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127785619 <br>Why is she so cute and adorable.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127785619 <br>Reading that with Kaname's voice it turns me on somehow.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127785619 <br>How could he even know who this is? I mean Callings had so much exposure by the time she appeared that I can't imagine he watched the whole thing.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127785767 <br>You're right I shouldn't ask why she's so cute and adorable just her presence in this thread. Look at her being so happy.</br>   mion   <br><br><br>shut up</br></br></br>  <br>She wants your bananas.</br>  <br>just shut up you are so annoying</br>  <br>do you want mion to pee on you.</br>  <br>Are you in your first period or something?</br>  Nice shitposting m8.  <br>I'd give her my banana.</br>  <br>Yes?</br>  <br>me too.</br>  This is what happen when the subs are ded.  <br> you just all keep saying dumb shit and its annoying so it would be better if somebody or something killed you</br>  <br>Robinho is a random event though. It has nothing to do with sub status.</br>  <br>Is he like a legendary Pokemon or something? Also, this isn't him.</br>  Mion is the best!  <br>Yeah he's always around but the chance of being in the same location of him is low like the Johto 3. Are you sure though? He sounds like him? We've got a new troll? Märchen~</br>  <br>She and Wakana are so great at making people love them.</br>  <br>Has Robinho even watched PR? It seems that this guy has.</br>  I wonder how many more times are they going to change this scene.    <br>Seira's flat as Chihaya.</br>  straight fucked off that robo    <br>I suddenly like her a lot more.</br>  Have y'all noticed this?<br><br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>708681</wbr> <br> Jewelpet Sunshine 18 </br></br></br>  <br> Kii with Rosetta <br> Not Otome <br>That's just wrong.</br></br></br>  <br> Shirt sizes are for men <br>They know their audience well.</br></br>  <br>How can I buy this?</br>  <br>At least is not a Batapon.</br>  iRis when?  <br>When Puretty revives.</br>      <br>Why does she look so sad?</br>  <br>Because she's unimportant.</br>  <br>Go to Prism Stone.</br>  <br>We're all unimportant.</br>    They're actually doing You May Dream, awesome.  <br>Who?</br>  I have no idea what the hell is going on anymore.  <br>Can I buy online?</br>  <br>No PR, no life!</br>  Pretty Rhythm is a sport anime.  <br> Yuki is shorter than Leona <br>It must suck being the smallest in an idol group.</br></br>  <br>But not on Tuesday because it's closed or something.</br>  Motunikomi's latest lophie is too lewd.  It just took them 99 episodes!  <br>Please spoiler images. Thank you.</br>  <br>Don't worry because subs never.</br>  <br>Many of us also watch no-subs shows raw.</br>  <br>God speed anon, god speed.</br>  <br> no </br>      This dude is so butthurt isn't even funny anymore.    <br> pouting Otome <br>Love you~</br></br>    <br><br>Do you think you could bundle these all up into an archive when everything is scanned?</br></br>  <br>I want Yurika to look at me with disdain.</br>  <br>I want Yurika to look at me</br>  <br><br>Too bad.</br></br>  <br>I want Yurika.</br>  <br>Yeah, I planned on it. It'll take a while to get through everything though. Maybe I'll release a couple smaller bundles as I get through chunks.</br>    <br>I want to make Kaede sad.</br>    Random question, does anyone happen to know where I can get creditless versions of the Pretty Rhythm openings?  <br>literally who?</br>  Alright /ai/ what's your favorite letter?  <br>K</br>  <br>M.</br>  <br>Maybe the All Star Selection? There's a bunch of songs on there without credits/interruptions, I think.</br>  <br>C</br>  <br>G</br>  <br>H and J OTP.</br>  <br><br>this anon gets it</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I actually am using that for footage of performances, but I think the openings still have credits IIRC. Thanks though, I'll check through it again and make sure</br>    <br>This looks terrible but I'll save it anyway.</br>  Well?  Last one for today.  <br>I didn't know Otome was supposed to be the shortest of all of them.<br><br>Nor did I know that Raichi and Noelle have massive heads.</br></br></br>  <br> Noelle's hand </br>  <br> ;_; <br><br>Nendoroid Co-de Falulu when?</br></br></br>  m  <br>What are you doing, get the batch.</br>  <br>That reminds me that I still need to buy Dream Parade. And that picture makes the anime characters look big.</br>  B A S E D<br>A<br>S<br>E<br>D</br></br></br></br>    <br>Why?</br>  <br><br>Oh boy.</br></br>  <br>Mikuru's destroyed face was wonderful.</br>  <br>So then what's Mirei's sexy pose based on?</br>    <br>If Aikatsu was a late night anime, Mizuki would have snapped and pushed Mikuru off the stage.</br>  <br>Or Prism Dive, but this isn't PR</br>  <br>The face of Mizuki sweating ice cubes while thinking how she's going to save face by pretending it was her plan all along.</br>  <br>Something tells me that's not how she felt.</br>  I downloaded the 1080p Aikatsu movie so I could watch it on my TV but my computer is too much of a toaster to play it.<br><br>Also I don't know why but I really like the whole addressing the audience thing kids movies do, it's really cute.</br></br>  <br>woah, more references please</br>    What a weird tree.  Not even the ice is safe from the flowers.     She'll be better mother than Sonata for sure.   <br>That's not saying much.<br>Even Kei was a better mom than Sonata.</br></br>  What a weird guy.  And that was it, I watched everything of PR, the RL preview is like a salt to the wound.  <br><br>Which season is this??</br></br>  <br>Sunshine of course.</br>    <br><br>Horey Sheet!</br></br>      <br>Aren't they too young for swimsuits like that?</br>  <br>Don't you dare to approach our innocent idles, /pc/scum!<br><br>Obviously, that's because she is /pc/scum.</br></br></br>  I hope somebody plans to scan animage.  I feel like a nigger for wanting this hat.  <br>Buy a new computer.

Void vs Femto who would win?  never forget  <br>i was in that thread. cool</br>  How many months before Guts actually gets off the boat?  <br> mfw my post is there <br>that was a fun thread</br></br>  <br> morons still make objectively shitty images like that one because they have nothing else to do and because morons want to say "I was in that thread" because they think anyone cares <br>What a surprise.</br></br>  <br> morons still make objectively shitty comments like that one because they have nothing else to do and because morons want to say "I was posted that comment" because they think anyone cares <br>What a surprise</br></br>  <br> morons still shitpost because they have nothing else to do  <br>also no surprise</br></br>  <br> posted from my iphone </br>  I finished lost children arc yesterday.<br>Loved it and this is one of my favourite pages ever now.</br>  <br>I'll stuff your mouth with my cock, slut</br>  <br>Jesus, the edgyness out of every pore yet I still like that shit.</br>  I knew morons would get butthurt because I put them in their place. Just look at the butthurt moron who parroted almost everything that I said and the butthurt moron who points out a shitpost while he shitposted because they're too butthurt and too retarded to make a decent response. And let's not forget about the butthurt moron who thinks that I have an iPhone.  <br>wait a minute, you're the guy who said that they were all morons for believe rumors, rumors were true and you shut the mouth of epic way?<br><br>Yes !!!! You're that moron i remember!!!</br></br></br>  <br>It's not like he's acting edgy, he's right, he has reasons to be so edgy.</br>  <br>Will Casca kiss and make love to Guts when she's cured?</br>  <br> I'm too cool to respond to the people who responded to my posts, so I'll just act like I'm talking to myself <br> that'll show them! <br>kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br> says the avatarfaggot <br>lel</br></br>  <br>Berserk edgyness is the best edgyness.</br>  <br>it's been a while since i've read berserk but i always visit google images of it. And GODDAMN the art is just orgasmic</br>  A lot of the Berserk girls are pretty cute.<br><br>I wish I was a male living in the world, could get a cute wife in a medeival dress.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I agree.</br>  <br>no<br><br>she won't be retarded anymore, but she'll forget everything about guts</br></br></br>  FUCK OFF FEEL SHIT!<br/>  <br>Fuck I wanted to post this one.</br>  <br>It's edgy, but it does edginess extremely well, and it makes it work.</br>  <br> I wish I was a male living in the world <br> wants to live in Berserk World </br></br>  <br>Absolutely not because Guts isn't allowed to be happy.</br>  <br> I wish I was a male living in the world <br> actual wants to live in the world of Berserk <br>no girl is cute enough to make me want to do that<br><br> maybe </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Must suck being a girl in the berserk world. Just trying to do your day to day work and then suddenly you're almost raped by a horse.</br>  <br> almost </br>  <br>You know that you're gonna get killed and your cute wife is going to be raped by goons/demons/trolls etc.</br>  <br> not training with sword and combat <br><br>Fucking pleb.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah... I mean, there's regular "waaa my parents are dead" or "you don't understand my burden!" type of edgy...<br><br>and then there is "my lover was raped by demons, my best friend did it, all my friends were killed, and I lost my arm and eye to demons that now seem to keep following me to finish the job" sort of edgy.<br><br>Guts turned out alright. Honestly, it takes a bit of thought to come up with people who had it worse off than him.</br></br></br></br></br>   morons are actually shocked because a moron wishes that he could be in the Berserk universe <br>Wow, it's fucking nothing.</br>  <br>kill yourself avatarfag</br>  <br>Guts trained from the moment he could hold a sword and Casca still got raped. What makes you think you'll do any better?</br>  <br>I don't have the Brand</br>  <br>You'd probably die of the plague before you get it.</br>  <br>I want to be like rickert and learn blacksmithing with a badass old man and then marry his QT adopted daughter.</br>  <br>Rip in pieces Godo, only good dad on the whole story</br>  <br><br><br><br>What would happen... if all of 4chan was transported to a world like Berserk.<br><br>A world where thoughts shape the astral plane... what would be our  idea of evil? </br></br></br></br></br></br>  Rate my sick tatt fags  <br>Seriously, Guts had a really hard life.<br><br> Born from a corpse <br> Gambino <br> Raped by a huge nigger, sold by Gambino <br> Escapes, fights against wolves <br> Gets a group in Golden Age <br> Everyone knows how this ended <br> The love of his life is retarded <br><br>Yet he doesn't give up, that's why Guts is so great, you can't just say that he's a bad character because of his edgyness, he actually has reasons to be like that.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondaries and normies. Every night we'd be haunted by them. <br> "The last good anime was cowboy bebooop" <br> "Do I watch fate/zero before watching UBW?" </br></br></br>  <br>You're fucking killing me, mate.</br>  <br>You can be in the Berserk universe in your dreams, you dumb boy.</br>  <br>Vargas was a good dad.</br>  <br>Nice cap.</br>  <br>It'd be better if it was much smaller and not colored. I like your hat though.</br>  <br>Would moot appear as our Skull Knight and save us from the reddit and tumblr eclipse?</br>  <br> Yet he doesn't give up, that's why Guts is so great, you can't just say that he's a bad character because of his edgyness, he actually has reasons to be like that. <br>Anon Guts has been into DeepShit no use giving up now. Too bad we'll never have a proper anime adaptation</br></br>  <br>Not the original guy, different guy.<br><br>Fuck actually being in the Berserk world. Just an interesting concept (where the minds of men shape the fabric underneath the world).<br><br>Berserk world just sucks because everyone seems to sub-consciously want to be punished. Makes sense though.<br><br>Only religion we really see is Catholicism.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon... moot died in the eclipse.</br>  <br>N-NEE-CHAN?</br>  <br>If you count ascending to demigod status as "dying" then sure. We're the ones who got the brand.</br>  <br> Too bad we'll never have a proper anime adaptation <br>I think the original, older adaptation was done really well. It was a fantastic dub for it's time.<br><br>It just wasn't a full adaptation, that's all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It captured the heart of the series even with the things it omitted. I just wish that it actually had Guts and Casca escape.</br>  <br>I've only read the manga. Spooky skellington wasn't there to save them?</br>  <br>Nope, Skill Knight was omitted. It fades to black when Guts loses his eye and then that's it.</br>  <br> Skill Knight <br>I like it.</br></br>  <br> I just wish that it actually had Guts and Casca escape <br>The ending is what made me read the manga. God was I fucking annoyed that it ended like that. Berserk is the only manga I've read aside from Vagabond, so I guess they accomplished the task of making watchers get hooked on the manga.</br></br>  <br/>  <br>Kill yourself.</br>  <br>no u</br>  Bumpu with waifu  Is the power of the Brand is just to draw demons towards you and pains you when they're close and by their powerlevel?  i hate isidro<br><br>what a pointless fucking character</br></br>  <br>I like him. You can also really tell how much he's grown and matured, which is cool.</br>  <br>You could say that about most of Guts' JRPG party</br>  <br>I like him because he along with Puck bring life to Guts' JRPG party.</br>  <br>It's just jarring that he makes it through everything unscathed after the countless deaths of trained and experienced soldiers we've seen.</br>  <br>You're fat but it's a good tattoo.</br>  Meanwhile at the Togashi household. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=l8N<wbr>2YSGjXXM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Guts is too hardcore for its own good  <br>magic, i aint gotta explain shit</br>  <br>that cgi is so SHIIIT</br>  <br>get rid of the red and ur good</br>  <br>so berserkfags are normalfags casuals</br>  <br>It's a gateway manga after all.</br>  <br>Having the brand essentially labels you as Griffith's bitch.</br>  <br><br>nice funposting</br></br>  <br>https://www.reddit.com/user/Armando<wbr>909396<br>Here's his reddit account if anyone's interested.</br></wbr></br>  <br>Reminder that Miss Luca is best girl</br>    <br>She is the best character in Berserk.

Go shitpost in /cm/ kaworufag</br>  <br>True enough anon, they do love drama, but now it's time to get back to rei.</br>  Rei's getting frisky.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127803151 <br>I don't go to /c/, but is that really a thing that happened? You Kaworufags got so desperate for attention you went to /c/ of all places and started shitposting in the Rei thread? I could completely believe that's a thing that happened, you Kaworufags are just fucking pathetic.</br>  <br>It's not my fault all the quality Reifag artists like to draw her with Kaworu.</br>  <br> it's not my fault I'm always shitposting <br>Oh please do go on</br></br>  <br>It turns out Kaworufags do have a sense of humour after all.</br>  Hap b. day  Could you guys, like, I dunno, just, not have this conversation. Thread's been awesome so far, take the pissing contest elsewhere.  <br>Sorry m8. You're right.</br>  <br>So you're even shitposting in /c/ threads? Really?<br><br>Fuck off.</br></br></br>  <br>Kaworu belongs in the garbage. Stop shitting up this and /c/ threads.</br>  <br><br>What's wrong with posting Rei with her husbando?</br></br>    <br><br>Shitposter pls.</br></br>  <br>Do everyone of us a favor. <br><br>Report this posters: <br><br>and maybe we can have our threads in peace.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You can't just report anons because they post things you don't like.</br>  <br>I can report them for shitposting, like this guy is doing.</br>  <br>Bullshit I can't.</br>  <br><br>  7. Submitting false or misclassified reports, or otherwise abusing the reporting system may result in a ban. Replying to a thread stating that you've reported or "saged" it, or another post, is also not allowed. </br></br>  <br>Directly admitting to shitposting and doing so violates a global rule.</br>  <br> You will not post any of the following outside of /b/: Trolls, flames, racism, off-topic replies, uncalled for catchphrases, macro image replies, indecipherable text (example: "lol u tk him 2da bar|?"), anthropomorphic ("furry") or grotesque ("guro") images, post number GETs ("dubs"), or loli/shota pornography. </br>  <br><br>The topic of this thread is Rei. I'm the only one here posting images with Rei in them. That's not shitposting. Meanwhile you complaining has ruined OP's birthday, thanks.</br></br>  <br>However, the topic of the thread is not trolling or shitposting, both of which you are constantly doing in every thread you appear in.</br>  In my honest opinion:<br>Overall character: Rei &gt; Asuka<br>As a romantic lead: Asuka &gt; Rei<br> I also feel a bit bad for Anno because of the fact no one fucking paid attention to the message he was trying to make about Rei in the show, and therefore had to resort to bashing the viewers of the Rebuild series over the head with it as hard as he could in order to get the message across </br></br></br>  <br> trolling or shitposting <br>I haven't done either of these things. At least, not any more than the others anons were doing earlier. You bitching is more off-topic than anything I'm doing and you shat on OP's birthday when all he wanted was a nice Rei thread. Thanks a lot.</br></br>  <br>  At least, not any more than the others anons were doing earlier. <br> Other people are doing it so it's okay! <br>Fuck off Kaworufag, you ruined the thread, no one else. Good job admitting to shitposting though.</br></br></br>  <br>Your spoilers are nonsense though. Want to know why?<br><br><br>Fuck off faggot.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sure, go ahead, odds are it wont change my opinion</br>  Is it fair to think of Rei as a huge pervert because of how weird the imagery gets around her specifically?  <br>I wasn't even shitposting, yet you complain about me and not the butthurt Asukafag who tried to jack the thread.</br>  Happy birthday OP  <br>Oh good, you're returning right back to "I was pretending to be retarded!" We've entered a loop, and you're still shitposting.</br>  <br>Then explain exactly what you think was misunderstood.<br><br><br>Yeah, because the character isn't one. If it's celebrating this:<br> Overall character: Rei &gt; Asuka <br><br>then something is amiss here.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>So I was right in your definition of shitposting being things you don't like. Grow up. Also, post Rei or get out.</br>  <br> I also feel a bit bad for Anno because of the fact no one fucking paid attention to the message he was trying to make about Rei in the show, and therefore had to resort to bashing the viewers of the Rebuild series over the head with it as hard as he could in order to get the message across <br>Yes, but the trouble is he made Rei's life so hilariously awful we all ended up feeling sorry for her rather than creeped out.</br></br>  <br> Wah, why are people complaining that I shitposted in multiple different thread and announced that I shitposted in the /c/ thread?! </br>  <br>Half the reason Anno made Rei was to criticize otaku for idolizing characters like Rei and show how a character like that would realistically be rather fucked up. Hell, that's half the reason he made every character in the show, especially Shinji and Asuka. Its just it backfired horribly for him and now Rei is considered to be one of the biggest characters in anime, if not animation in general<br><br>Im not saying Rei is a bad character. Far from it. She a qt. But equally so she was never supposed to be catapulted into God-Emperor waifu tier</br></br></br>  <br>You said you didn't go to /c/</br>  <br>And you said you shitposted all over it.<br> B-but I was just kidding <br>Kill yourself</br></br></br>  <br> Half the reason Anno made Rei was to criticize otaku for idolizing characters like Rei and show how a character like that would realistically be rather fucked up. <br><br>What makes you think that? Because that there is just a fan myth - there's nothing from the writers that say that's the purpose. Otaku idolize characters of all types, and Rei at the moment she's introduced is fairly original.<br><br>Otaku at the time idolize other types of characters, and Anno as an otaku even has his tastes.<br><br>Now let's pretend that was the intention for the sake of argument, isn't this:<br> Im not saying Rei is a bad character. Far from it. She a qt. But equally so she was never supposed to be catapulted into God-Emperor waifu tier <br><br>something more important? She was "never supposed to be popular" ? Who says that? It's not up for anyone to decide who gets popular, it gets shown to the masses and it either proves itself, or doesn't.<br><br>Rei got popular fair and square. The character is phenomenal. If anyone has issues with that, they're simply just jealous.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's not my fault all the quality Reifag artists like to draw her with Kaworu. <br>I suspect it's because you only save Kaworu pics, so the only pics of Rei you have also include the faggot.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't need to go there because you practically admitted to shitposting ITT.</br>  <br>Didn't Anno just use Rei as a bribe to get Ikuhara to work on the show with him? Once he refused he lost all interest in Rei.</br>  <br> replying to a post where pic related is Rei by herself <br>Are you retarded?<br><br><br><br>Post Rei or leave you spergs. The only ones shitposting here are you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I-I'm not shitposting, y-you're shitposting! <br>Keep trying Kaworufag, you're transparent as glass.</br></br>  <br>No, he chose the name.</br>  <br>No amount of Rei images you post can clear off your bullshit.</br>   All these people arguing when there's Rei to be posted.   <br>He wanted to make Rei a Rei Hino clone to lure Ikuhara in, but once he refused Anno was stuck with a character he didn't even want in the first place.</br>  <br>Can you stop shoveling your kaworu/homo-centric bullshit on everyone?</br>    <br> hating on Iku-chan <br>I don't understand how anyone could have taste this shit.</br></br>  <br>Anno was never trying that in the first place.<br><br>Butthurt Asukafags, Kaworufags and other scum spread that lie together because they couldn't handle Rei being the better character.</br></br></br>   all that meta bitchfighting between /c/ and /cm/ <br> Kaworufags and Reifags going nuts over eachother  <br> meanwhile Asukafags are laughing hysterically in the background </br></br>  <br>Was about to post something similar. What a thread.</br>    <br>This Rei looks soft.</br>   Kaworufags and Reifags going at it   <br>Looks like it's dying down for a bit. Maybe they'll go at it again and give us a good show.</br>  <br>Please don't sully Taro for this.</br>    <br>He would appreciate the chaos</br>    <br>I suppose this is the standard Taro needs to beat if he wants to spark some Waifu wars.
