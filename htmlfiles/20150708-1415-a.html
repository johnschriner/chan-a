Japanese starts at around the same time. They're both very different languages from back then, but English went through more change because of having later influence (being the vernacular during the rule of the Normans). The English of 650 is considered a completely different language, while the Japanese of that time is almost intelligible.</br>  <br>Alright, thank you.</br>   learning japanese just for chinese cartoons <br>Has got to be one of the most common kneejerk reactions by people on /a/ and alike. Let us say these people average an hour of /a/ related activities a day. In the decade, at least, spent with this it works out at least 3650 hours invested. Chances are they are going to double that time in the next twenty years. <br><br>Looking at it more objectively, that excuse seems inane.

It's pretty old, but has a good plot.</br></br>  Amazing beginning and middle, but like a lot of Urasawa works the ending can't do everything justice. The final interaction between johan and tenma doesn't really make any sense, even if you can believe in the ultra-super-moralfaggotry that Johan can be absolved of being evil, nothing in the story suggests he should be allowed to just freaking walk out of a hospital and face no justice for his crimes.  <br>I dread Roberto because of how incessant he was. All those time you think he's dead - think again! Gives me similar creepy vibes like that thing in 'It Follows' but to a much lesser yet more tangible extent. Chilling is the perfect description for Johan. And I loved that they used the same OP music for the entire show while switching the ED, which I felt suited the tone of each "phase" in the story.</br>  <br> Johan can be absolved of being evil <br><br>It might also be about people resisting his influence on their own morality despite all the horrible shit he's caused them.</br></br></br>  <br>spoilers man<br> use them </br></br>  The mangaka built up this incredible amazing villain that sounded like the very devil, but he just couldn't make that villain come to life when it was time to go face to face with the Monster itself.<br><br>You could also take the ending as meaning that even the worst monsters are still human and human weaknesses and all that, but even then it felt a little weak to me. The reaction just wasn't there.<br><br>I also really like that one panel that pops up throughout the story where the man is stretching his hand out while saying "Humans can become anything..." I personally think that the reveal was the best of the entire series.<br><br>Sorry for the tumblr gif, couldn't find a better one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   ITT we post wrong things     <br>Literally nothing wrong with this.</br>  <br> ashamed <br><br>Where do you think you are?</br></br></br>    <br>I've always wondered what this is from.</br>  Yeah, you just have to say "Yuzu" and the kid will do pretty much anything you want.  <br>For maximum Shun angst.

Shitpost based on spoilers first happened when they were kids started in the first episode week. Of course that was mainly done by a certain tsunhater, but Megumifags jumped onto that quickly. Even Utaha got in line of their cross-hair for the whole betraying thing to that was in-line with their shitposting about betray/abandoning the MC.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Raildex, jojofags, KLKfags, Madokafags and steins;gay fags are the worst.</br>  <br><br>First week shitposting was an exception.

You know shit, dude. <br>You're arguing semantics which is not the point. Either way, it's still cancerous shitposting.<br><br> Why don't you actually read the thread instead of trying so hard? <br>The Eriri &gt; Izumi is the only post regarding anything about the novel itself, but even Michirufags posted more things.<br><br> It's like you don't know what your main point is anymore. <br>Jesus Christ.
