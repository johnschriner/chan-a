[ Get in http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87   We're doing /a/ sings Sono chi, the full version. Recordings are due June 9th.   Email killahspectah@live.com.     What if parts 4 and 5 are part of the same season?    You mean July 9th, you nerd   fourth for wanting to eat hot pants' chunky peanut butter   Was part 4 hinted at?   I'm trying to find something about it but I can't yet.          https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=PoR<wbr>Iv1ZDnRI</wbr>  [ ]    b-but, we're already sing it  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=2wb<wbr>lN9-05AM</wbr>  [ ]     isn't part 5 kind of long?    SONO CHI NO KIOKU ORA ORA ORA ORA    It felt that way for me until the boss tried killing Trish, then it felt rushed as shit.  What confused me the most is that Giorno couldn't revive Narancia once his body was revived. I mean, Joseph came back to life and we saw his soul pass on for God's sake.     Did Araki every mention if it was Josuke who put his coat under the car and saved baby Josuke, and he just forgot to put it in?   Araki probably forgot Joseph was revived  Or maybe it was because he was revive from vampire blood and not stand magic?      It was just some guy.    Why did araki even revive joseph? I like him but it was so unnecessary.    I'd imagine he wanted to do something about that with Bites za dusto but ran out of time    it was josefumi of course    So we could have character development for Josuke, silly   Would you let rule 63 kira suck on your fingers?   Can Bites za dusto go back that far or am I just naive for not expecting an Araki brand ass pull.    n-no    Maybe he had already planned a bit of part 4's plot?  The only reason they found out about Josuke is because Joseph was planning his will, if he died in SC then DiU would never have happened      o rite  what if Josuke was Holly's second son?      Finding out your dad is dead isn't the type of news a person recovering from a nearly deathlike state needs to hear.    Would she kill me afterwards? I would let her suck my every inch for eternity.    nigger josuke didn't know who his father was until he was like 16  tfw no runaway girl doujinshi      no episode tomorrow    no chapter  I'm not feeling it anymore     Y'know, rule 63 every main villain except for DIO, and I'd be their fuckpuppet for all eternity  and DIO too      Hes talking about holly retard.    Why did that cat plant obey KQ and live in his stomach?    I was talking about Holly you double nigger.    Well this is embarrassing. Meant for<br/>    ZW will never do a porn with SP recording  Fuck DIO. If only he was good. ZW and SP could act all like bros and shit.    oh shieeeeet  fucking misleading faggot          I hate how in Jojo All Star Battle they gave pre Kosaku Kawajiri Kira the shity non killer queen tie.     What if there was a universe where stands were the people and humans were the stands?  What would this scene look like with the other jojo crews?  Continuing from the whole only stand user in the world thing, I think being a vampire would be fucking awesome as long as a random bit of UV light wouldn't kill you. Being able to slowly make my way to the top of the world under a lot of different identities over the years and having my own clan of vampires under me would be sweet.  I'm a VtMfag, shoot me   If you want your Runaway Girl doujin so badly, someone who can write in Japanese without sounding like and idiot please contact the mangaka.

It's weird to think about the fact that Josuke and Holly are siblings   Where was that complaint for the last 2 I made then?    Yeah sure why not Doesn't someone use it to undo the death of the universe in Jorge Joestar     If they fucked do you think they would make a stand like Stone Free?    I've been busy laying low waiting for the final episode hype to die down.       I guess I'll get that version for you soon then.    T-thank you Doc kun~   I can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not.             Can stands control their user like that?    Of course not.    That one clip of the two voice actors singing the theme. I want my cookie.      His laughing in this scene was hilarious.   <br/>  Just finished Battle Tendency's adaptation Pretty good, Caesar's  death  scene was done greatly Gonna start SDC adaptation now     no more jojo fridays   &gt;possibly forever     cool   Can anyone give me a better resolution of this? Or rather can anyone dank it up, making him say "I came here to laugh at you" or even "I came here to kek at you"   Why didn't F.F. let herself get revived? She'd probably still be a good guy even if she wasn't the same F.F. Jotaro wouldn't need to worry about Jolyne getting skewered, he could just toss her in the way of some knives, rek Pucci and F.F. could save her.     I already made something like that.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=__j<wbr>PkucX_CM</wbr>  [ ] I just noticed LunarSpiral uploaded this  The girl crying over kakyoins death        Why don't you just go take the screen shot yourself faggot. MPC even has a screenshot key.    this is cute wish i could read it     Thank you Doc kun~    i didn't have the episode anon. don't be an asshole.  thanks doc      Didn't Pucci still have her disc?   Can anyone post the edit of that scene where jotaro lets go of the receipt that says "ur a fag"    he doesn't archive shows until BDs come out       I know anon. I deleted it like a retard. I don't want to download it again though.   Help /a/, my 9 year old cousin wants to be a marine biologist when he grows up. He's already researching all the different types of sharks.   Thank you Doc. You are my favorite   After STALKER      Kakyoin is 178 cm Everyone else is is around 190cm This makes no sense       not starfish  He's okay.     that kid is autistic mane sorry     How are we doing the ora part? Are we doing it like the song or is it a ORA ORA MUDA MUDA scream off?    here's higher res you can repay me by not using the word dank     Dank as fuck, thanks anon.    dank you anon  :^)    BDs when?   Joseph looks like he isnt wearing pants in that scene. Seriously it looks like his hairy ass leg is free in the breeze.     look at how he stands anon he is conscious of his height     https://www.google.com/calendar/emb<wbr>ed?src=ciaual7l89unnh1h4410vmn4u8%4<wbr>0group.calendar.google.com</wbr></wbr>   <br/>   They all aren't wearing pants, anon  Avdol has that censored void and the school uniforms obscure the other two's dongers      Those are called clothes you nudist freak.   Think you can make a better edit than this faggot?     It never even occured to me to think about making Dio's World/Jurassic World edits.     no dick in DIO's mouth   tumblr  what?     Josefumi has a dumb, punchable face. Shit hair doesn't help.   fucking hell doc     kissanime         Pucci attracted 3 of Dio's children   but not Giorno   Imagine if Giorno had been there to fight Pucci with GER  I guess we wouldn't have SBR then though       With all the shit that animeonly fags are giving over the Jotaro Vs DIO fight, just imagine what will happen when King Crimson is introduced.   how many times do we have to go through this, SBR isnt the ireneverse!    sbr isn't the ireneverse or anything like that     Well shit  Sorry, I'm still reading through part 6       The fags were giving shit because they were comparing to the OVA and all that unmanageable hype.    Is this confirmed? I always assumed Araki never confirmed or denied it is the same universe.     Nah, Dio's World really does have a ridiculous amount of "Why doesn't X do Y?" and it's all the more noticable when you're watching it instead of reading it at your own pace.    that's where i watch jojo before i download it if you have a high quality ova download feel free to link it     That too. Lots of plot armor and stupid crap Araki wrote at the time.     animeonly fags   unmanageable hype  oh anon      Are you serious? Did nyaa and all the private trackers shutdown or something?     never confirmed or denied it is the same universe  this, but the joestars being nowhere near florida convinces most people that there is no way for irene to get the star birthmark.     hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm    I failed to understand how this proves anything.   Favorite non Main Villain Stand battle in each part? I'll start. Part 3: D'arby The Gamer Part 4: Highway Star Part 5: Metallica Part 6: Guard Westwood's Secret Part 7: Scary Monsters Part 8: Born This Way         It's not just that. The SBRverse is different in ways that would make no sense if it was because of MIH.   I want the next main Jojo villain to be a girl. Is that too much to ask for?   3. Vanilla Ice 4. Highway Star 5. Metallica 6. Bohemian Rhapsody 7. True Man's World 8. Beetlemania         I think it would be really nice to have a female antagonist for once. I would really like to see what Araki would do.     I'M SORRY?     i'm serious in that i've never bothered to download the ova, yeah   GET IN HERE NIGGA  http://yourafool.keyblade.jp       what the fuck is that   You know what jojo rule 63 art I hope/wish exists? Something that would show Dio and Johnathan's body types being different in some way (like one having bigger boobs than the other or something), making it obvious that DIO has johnathan's body      we posting anime fakes?    where are these from?          I grabbed them from a past thread, reverse search gave me nothing Yukako looks super legit, i would be pleased if that was her official design.     koichi looks like an actual shark     that forehead  HNNNNG      whyy   Nose ruins it. The rest is pretty good tho.      TELL ME ABOUT CRAZY DIAMOND! WHY DOES HE WEAR THE MASK?     They're from Pixiv.     Because his soul couldn't find a body to go into Joseph got lucky and got the joestar blood from dio/Jonathan's body     IF I LOOP TIME WILL YOU DIE?    /jojo/ can get pretty bad as well.    No but it would be very GUREETO    what's wrong with ringo    Shouldn't Killer Queen be skip back and Mandom be rewind?    he bows man    How do you think DIO got women to lust after his dick for children? It was Jonathan's d they were after  men go after just DIOs essence      http://picosong.com/gQ7s/   Practice run, I'm nowhere near manly for this track so I'm gonna take a couple tries over a couple days and see if I improve.     expand my folder please   It's like 2008 all over again.    I thought Narancia was a girl from the start, had me fucked up when I realized there was a dick in between those thighs. It had me  Jaded    What's the difference between infinite speed and time stop?   Please dump all these into an imgur album,oh god.    Dump that shit, fehget    DUDE LOOKS LIKE A LADY    Infinite speed also means infinite velocity, something you can't have in stopped time.          Narancia looks the same    He always does.    No she'd kill you before   just started vol 46 second to last of part 4. favorite fight so far is the superfly tower, but the time loop thing was pretty cool  Should I wait on the retranslation for part 5 to finish or should I just finish it with the(apparently) shit one?    narancia a cute     how far along is the retranslation?  maybe the retranslation will vastly improve the quality of the story and get rid of that sour taste in reader's mouths      yfw Part 4 really might never be animated by David    I just finished the last chapter that was done and Its 4 parts into the fight with pic related.    It's really your call,man.You'll get told otherwise,but part 5 is kind of meh.I can understand why people like it,but I hate it with a passion and wish it didn't exist and anyone who thinks otherwise is a fucking faggot that I don't even want to talk to,but whatever.I don't judge.    No idea what happened. Heres the picture for real.    It's going to happen and you fucking know it.Even if DP hated the series they wouldn't pass up the oprotunity to make some more money.     tfw there is no porn of Johnathan and erina having marital sex with the lights on in the missionary position looking each-other in the eyes for the purpose of having a child.   why live?      Are you talking about the 1st or 4th opening?    so around vol 51-52ish?  I would wait til the whole thing is out but it might take a while. I have no idea how long translations take, what with groups flaking/losing interest      I have some but it's only a few pages long and drawn kind of meh.I can upload it to imgur if anyone's interested.   Chapter When?     Why do people think David won't do it?      do it     eye contact  filthy scum     Can I skip to part 6 without worries then and come back to it? I'm enjoying it so far but fuck me I'm too impatient to wait without something else to read.      Today would be the day by which we usually get a chapter released, but since that’s not the case I feel I should at least post an update about it rather then leave everyone in the dark.     We are having some trouble getting scans from the magazine this month. Usually we have them by day 1 or 2 but when none of the members of the group live in Japan its really a month-to-month, seat of the pants thing, and we haven’t always had perfect luck and consistency with raw provision. This is just one of those months.    Hopefully we will have raws this week and can release the chapter by the weekend or like Monday. Rest assured once we have the raws, we will all work tirelessly to deliver the chapter as quickly as possible.    Thanks for the patience, and please look forward to future releases.           Kars vs DIO  Who would win and why?     All of that and that's what ticks you off?    I've seen like 1. But it sucked.    Dio because he would stop time and send Kars off into space.    dunno haven't read part 6 yet I read everything in this order 3&gt;1&gt;2&gt;4&gt;7&gt;5  was gonna start part 6 after I finish reading Robinson's Starman run at DC       Is it possible to kill Kars?    nice digits    How would he get Kars into space?     killing  who said anything about that? you don't need to kill Kars to win against him.     Kars DIO doesn't have asspulls powers and is literal fodder for pillermen     Found it.https://imgur.com/a/BRytB  It's worse than I remember so I added some good art I had of it at the end      Yeah but it's not like DIO can just throw Kars into space   So I started reading jojo after the show ended and I've gotten to this point.  I'm disconcerted and not really entertained so far. Diamond is unbreakable was great though.   Can I skip this shit ? Should I keep reading ? Is the next chapter better ?   Where the fuck is this story going?         Kars if only because I don't know that Dio could physically kill Kars even with timestop. Sending him to space isn't really gonna work either without a volcano or some other convenience.     skipping     DIO drops a road roller da  made of lava  on Kars   did the anime of part one and two make you go back and reread them with greater appreciation?   If you really have to I think you can skip it  It may be the most unimportant chapter in the entire series      You can skip it,and don't let anyone tell you different.     How would he get Kars into space?   TOKI WO TOMARE   carry Kars on your back   start spouting a generic evil monologue to activate "anime time"   stall long enough to fly all the way into orbit   ???   part 4 animated          araki really should've played up giorno being dio's son as a plot point more. like maybe have him viciously kill one of his opponents or use some of that dio charm some more   it's toki yo tomare you faggot    at least read the good translations anon geez ib4 you ask they're on batoto look harder     It's a meme you dip     Soshute toki wa imoki das      maybe have him viciously kill one of his opponents  you mean like he did to all of his opponents? not a single villain lived in part 5 and most are directly or indirectly killed by giorno       Where the fuck is this story going?  They're gonna take down the boss, duh. You realize there are color scans too right? With better translations to boot.       It's true  Diavolo had an even worse death than Kars       Nigger 4.5 PAGE MUDAMUDA Diavolo GIORNO IS NOT A JOJO. HE IS A FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.        4.5  7 pages anon, double pages count as 2. 7 and a panel counting the spike     He does use the Dio charm all of the crew are his fucking minions. He isn't really 'friendly' with them like any of the other jojos are with their crew     He's not a psychopath. He's something. I can't really tell at this moment since I'm at the beginning of the Pesci fight, but he's not a psycho.    Why does Giorno yell WRYYYYYYYYYYYYY again?  I thought that was a vampire thing?     ザ・ワールド！ 東京止まれ！ WRYYYYYYY       Ok, thank god. I can't take anything seriously.   Mista with his magic bullet dudes   Bruno has dimension zippers   Abachio might as well have nothing   who the fuck knows what narancia does   And I'd be more entertained peeling grapes than having to pay attention to Giorno.             well it is GE yelling it so maybe it is in the brando blood.    Fugo has the most interesting stand but it's only used once  Part 5 was a mess       hating sticky fingers    Does anyone have that webm of dark souls lagstab explaining King Crimson?     I am using batoto I guess I'm just retarded.      I was going to give you a catchup on the things you need to know about it before going to part 6,but then I remembered that literally nothing of lasting importance happens.Skip ahead,my friend.   Why didn't Jotaro just pay to get Jolyne a good lawyer?   no but i have this       implying that autist can think of something you need IQ above 80 to come up with     This made me belly laugh.   Thanks for the advice anon.       that disconnect/ragequit  Is this King Crimson Requiem? Punch so hard they are blown out of existance. Like GER.    what would the world's requiem power be?   permanent time stop    It'd probably be MiH. Requiem stands aren't related to the stand's original power - it's based off your heart's wish at the time. That's why Giorno didn't get GER during the first fight: he didn't have one singular wish that his entire being was focused on.    Made In Heaven     lava  Yeah that worked so well last time      who the fuck knows what narancia does  His is super simple. Its a mini fighter jet.   Can't take anything seriously  You did actually read part 4 right? The only things serious in that involve Kira. A lot of the rest is pretty silly.  Aliens   fighting over lottery money   Dice   Shrinkage    I mean I haven't finished part 5 yet but nothing about it seems to fall out of line after part 4. If anything the stands seem more creative and interesting.                 5000 hours in ms paint       Diego also said that... It's just a typical Dio thing.    I highly doubt even you'd be able to stop 13 million people old Dio buddy    Do it with Diego's The World. Fit's better.    So KC Requiem is skippig death?     The difference is part 4 was fun     SBR TW looks like it has downs    Fits perfectly with Made In Heaven then.    King Crimson Requiem would probably be "Skip GER's shit"    Who even knows what the fuck Diavolo's real goal was. Maybe it'd just be something that prevents anyone from knowing anything (meaningful, beyond enough to let them take orders) about Diavolo. Or something that lets him escape reality a-la Cream, only focused more heavily on its defensive capacities.     Maybe it'd just be something that prevents anyone from knowing anything   So..... KCR gets BtD?      KCR's ultimate power is  making people leave you alone        It had its moments    So what even are stands?Will Araki ever explore the alien parasite thing?Why did Jesus give people stands?Was Jesus an alien?Will we ever get a mini-manga about the adventures of Jo-sus with his stand 『KING OF CARROT FLOWERS』 and his brojo Peter?   post yfw the BDs have   Sono Chi no Sadame   Get Back   Part 4 Teaser         If they do Part 4, I hope Echoes ACT 3 keeps Koichi's voice actor.    KCR It nullifies someone's knowledge about Diavolo.     well stand arrows seem to not exist in SBR so I doubt the meteor stuff carried over.    If you believe Jorge Joestar it was actually  Dio     the world is a requiem, since that dio can freeze things in part 1 and then with the bow and arrow he can freeze time (dio was the first person who has the bow and arrow)    What if KCR nullified Diavolo?    It would be golden. Although the translation makes Act 3 sound like a thug. I'm really just anticipating sheer heart attack in general.    fuck off with your shitty theory faggot It was diavolo who sold the arrow to dio     I'm not sure how to respond to that.    How the fuck did you even get that.     you'll never get to use the stone mask     jail breaks are more fun    I feel like this was the exact thing I said last thread but made into something stupid     can't take anything seriously   read part 4   nigga what?       I don't want to say this because it's kind of become a meme,you are actually autistic.    you what         I'm totally expecting Bites the Dust to appear at some point in part 8, except it'll rewind time so fucking far that Gappy/Josefumi will do it.        colour ver     Jotaro just wanted to spend some quality time breaking out of jail with Jolyne but Pucci fucked it all up.    How could you word this nonstupidly?Freezing with ice and freezing time have absolutley nothing to do with each other,except for the english only word "Freezing".If you directly translated "Freezing Time" into almost any other language it would sound dumb    fuuuuck you are right but dio use the arrow to have his stand and he had already used the mask     What about MiH requiem?    Turn every living human to DIO-sama.     maximum humanity   a fucking EXTREME amount of souls  Dark Souls 1 and 2 were both SOOOOOO fucking easy to cheat with using cheatengine that at least 90% of the pvp community in those games probably deserved bans.      I said  Dio freezes stuff in part 1   freezes time in part 3  or something like that no requiem shit innit        Why do people assume that a Requiem stand is going to be the same abilities, but better?   stand about life ---&gt; returns everything back to zero   stand about swordfighting ---&gt; soul/body swapping        Well, GER still had the original abilities of GE, it just had an extra ability on top of that  I think it completely depends on what you want your stand to be the moment it gets pierced      killer queen technically it's a requiem when gets bite ze za duzo    its Friday   remember there will be no more jojo.     More importantly, its about what the User wants before he gets Requiem.  Polnareff didn't want to die so his requiem allowed him to switch bodies. Giorno wanted to beat/erase Diavolo and so Diavolo is dying (infinitely) .       Kars. People tend to forget that DIO is just a vampire and Pillar Men absorb anything that can't use Hamon as soon as it touches them. However this is only assuming The World has the same properties of its user too, and Kars can't really do much against a timestop other than just tank it.  tl;dr Ultimate kars would win      no it's not Kira got stabbed the arrow a second time, and gained a new ability on his existing stand Reqiuems are created when the stand itself is stabbed by the arrow     Dio could freeze his body to counter the hamon which would otherwise move into his body and affect him. Do you think that would work against whatever the Pillar Men secrete to absorb their food?  Either way, even DIO can't kill ultimate Kars, so I agree with you on that one.    <br/>    Assuming Part 3 DIO, he has Johnathan's body and a Stand at this point meaning he either can't or won't use his ice powers or eye lasers. If we're talking Part 1 Dio Brando he would lose easily to normal non-Ultimate Kars.     Pillarmen bodies are weird remember how that could faze into joseph's body and put the poison rings on him.    No, because the first time Polnareff got Silver Chariot Requiem was when he dropped it in his house and used his stand to pick it up.    araki wrote a villian so broken he drove himself to corner   GE wasn't that OP and araki couldn't think of a creative way to defeat KC   his editors were making him rush the ending   "What can I do know? Diavolo is way too strong for part 5 crew and half of them are already dead"   "Oh I know. I will have to use THAT"  Thus GER was born.         assuming The World has the same properties of its user  this always confused me, would hamon go through the stand because dio was definitely worried it would and refused to touch joseph even in stopped time. does it only work if it is a stand charged with hamon?     I find it unlikely that a normal vampire power would at all be effective against the pillermen who eat vampires all the time like it's nothing. At best DIO could escape out of Kars' range using timestops, but would still be unable to kill Kars, resulting in a stalemate/eternal conflict.    why didn't Jotaro wear his stand ever  who else here would want DIO to win? Fuck kars, faggot has no charisma or style. DIO has it all and bitches too  Will Araki ever return to the Ireneverse?   If DIO spams timestop at some point it would be days long. Put Kars in a space shuttle. "GOODBYE KAAASU"      Wouldn't a Pillar Man still be fucked if you turned their brain into mush?     Thread devolves into "Would X beat Kars" again  That new chapter can't come any faster    it's friday   there will be no new episode  Hold me.     Can the new chapter beat Kars?    We don't know with ultimate kars. wham took a shot to the head with the clackers and santana crushed his entire body to get into a vent. However the brain seemed pretty important since that was all acdc needed to live. Kars is a bit different with the part where he turns the scale feathers into piranha and his hand being a squirrel, seemingly every part of kars is alive and he could simply make another brain with his other body parts.  the script is out, it can't be much longer, but really the generals are clearly out of topics.       seemingly every part of kars is alive and he could simply make another brain with his other body parts   That's where the time stop comes into play  Completely destroy his brain in the time stop, and when time resumes he'll be too fucked up to make another brain        Damn, David Productions is really doing right by JoJo.    unlike part 3 dio, kars didn't need to feed to heal severe injuries and dio himself didn't die until the sun baked him in part 3. That being said The only way i can seem him getting by the world is by turning into a vampire killing virus. going at it with a normal body or range attacks won't work. he probably can't over power it but we never get any strength feats from the pillarmen.    Could Kars beat Giorno with GER?   Question: Why exactly is each Pillar Man's mode unique, if they were granted by the use of a Stone Mask? If they all have complete control and mastery of their bodies, why don't they just each imitate more Modes to increase their effectiveness in combat? Why couldn't Santana just make one up himself? Since vampires (Dio at least) also have complete control of their bodies, why didn't he do the same - and vice-versa why didn't any of the Pillar Men attempt to use Space Ripper Stingy Eyes and the like?   No.    Literally nothing in all of fiction can beat GER.    Because I guess 2 seasons/3 parts is already a pretty good number. And also because Japan hates Part 4, while they fucking love Part 5. Presumably this has led some to believe that they're more likely to skip to Part 5 or stop completely rather than do Part 4 first. They're probably also jumping the gun a bit since there wasn't a Part 4 teaser at the end of the last episode, but that was for obvious reasons.        Not even Madara Uchiha? I never saved that whole BS copypasta, so I'm just leaving it at that     Someone translated that a week ago.    Could GER kill Kars?  Like, stop his regeneration and just punch him until he's nothing?      When it comes to bullshit "No, I win!" reality warping powers, GER takes the cake. He could just set Madara's chakra or fighting power or whatever to zero and then put him in an infinite death loop with Diavolo.   Yeah, it could just set his regeneration and body manipulation to zero.       Demonbane    Reset EVERYTHING to 0. Most bullshit power in anything.   Why the fuck didn't they get Giorno to just fight Pucci   So does that mean he could survive the universal reset? Meaning Jorge Joestar is canon?    It's true, Demonbane is even stupider than GER, somehow  Whoever wrote Demonbane just slapped every fucking stupid ability he could think of on it  GER probably couldn't even reset Demonbane's will to zero, since it exists outside of existence, or something        So Araki could have an easy copout reason to throw away the old Jojoverse  If Giorno had fought Pucci, no ass pulls would allow Pucci to win that one.      GER is outside of existance too. Timeskip is outside of existance too.    Disneyland   Pucci is best villain.  That is all.     That's not Dio.    Nooooo noooo Nooo  Diavolo is better        Dio   Babby's first JoJo villain   Complete bitch when he's not 100% sure he's going to win       If it weren't for Dio, Pucci would have stayed a boring priest.    Best death, maybe.   mfw he's still dying to this day       So the one thing he did good on was that he helped make best villain    He's the entire reason why he's a villain in the first place. Pucci could have been another Hot Pants without him.      No, no, no.  Best villain is Kira.        Dunno about Jorge being canon, but in All Star Battle at least GER is not affected by MiH. Does that mean he survived to the next few universes?    That doesn't change the fact that Pucci&gt;Dio. Dio's probably at the bottom in terms of villains, unless you're an animefag    Then why don't people appreciate Pucci more? He's less popular than even Kira.   Just read jojolion 44,  I can't believe the other half is kinda-Josuke but with worse hair     Thinks Dio is better than Pucci   Thinks Dio is better than Kira      Why do people even talk about Jorge if they don't know anything about it? Even in the book itself the crazy parts take place in a different world.   ASB wasn't even made by Araki. Gio did indeed survive though, because the only ones who weren't carried over the way they were were the ones Pucci killed during accelerated time.       I never said Dio was better than Kira. I will say that Dio is the most popular villain even though he's just an asshole in Part 1 and was barely in Part 3.   I just want a plot synopsis of Jorge Joestar but nobody here has even read the book.       Popular=//=Best    Dem satan  Guys remember. It all started when Diavolo sold arrows to enya and others. Diavolo made DIO Kira and Pucci what they were. Without him we wouldn't have anything. Even part 7 is thanks to him.       Diavolo had nothing to do with Part 7. The Ireneverse is not the SBRverse.    Agreed.    No, he's right in a way. If it weren't for Diavolo, Pucci wouldn't have gotten his Stand, thus Pucci would never have reset the universe    What does Pucci have to do with Part 7 though?   So which composer do you think they'll get for part 4? I'm thinking maybe the guy who did the Eva/Bleach soundtracks. I could see them using a theme like this during a battle with Josuke. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Uiy<wbr>aqnj2FZ4</wbr>  [ ]    Pucci can't affect the SBR universe because he isn't part of it    Persona guy.     Pucci reseted entire multiverse thus resulting to sbr multiverse existing     Okay, whatever.    No, the Steel Ball Run universe is a parallel universe. Pucci reset the part 1-6 universe and it became a slightly modified version of itself, with Irene Joestar etc. There is no Irene Joestar in the Jojolion/SBR world.    probably late but  no runaway girl doujin  hehehe      Says you. And you don't know jack shit. Joesefumi managed to elude detection, I'm sure Araki plans to shove Irene in there too. Hell, maybe Irene is Josefumi's mom.   So Invincible Trio's Part 4 isn't actually a retranslation, just duwang proofread?  From their first post:   As I cannot speak Japanese, or any language other than English for that matter, the actual translations may be as off as ever, but hopefully this experience will at least be in coherent sentences.        Josefumi isn't a Joestar, he's a Kujo. Want me to post the interview where Araki says part 8's a parallel universe?     Please do, every time I see people denying that they're the same universe, they either don't have a source, or post an untranslated interview.      You are of course aware that Jolyne was a Kujo as well?    Maybe they never bothered figuring out how.    Honestly, you could skip to 6 if your really wanted to. Part 5 and 6 have no relation to each other, and part 6 leads into 7-8.    Go read the end of part 6 again. The world Irene is in is meant to be much closer to the 1-6 world, with the exact same people walking around.    Araki should really make altverse prequel about Joshua bar-Joseph and give him the joestar just for shits and giggles.     Freezing with ice and freezing time have absolutley nothing to do with each other,except for the english only word "Freezing"   menacing_esdeath.jpg   It just works.       Go and get some proof, because all those exact same people may have been exceptions, not the rule. Maybe they got a pass because they were directly intertwined with the reset, while people farther away chronologically/spatially got more heavily changed.  There are no plot holes in SBR/JoJolion that make it so that it is impossible this is the world Pucci created. You just lack imagination.  Basically, both of our opinions are worthless right now because we don't know for sure yet/we don't have facts, so I don't give a shit about what you say and you shouldn't give a shit about me either.         Star Platinum and The World being bros; DPing a chick  I need source of that pic     seconding this question    Of course, but she's a Kujo from the Joestar lineage. She'd be on the family tree  From the sound of things you've already seen it but can't read it. I don't know if there's a translated version flying around, but I can point out which part says it if that helps.       Let's put at it this way then: if there's nothing outright saying it's the same world and you have to make up your own rules to make it fit like you just did in this post, wouldn't it be more logical to assume it isn't?    Literally everything you said is wrong  Madhouse adapted HxH over 200 episodes non-stop. David can easily keep going, adapting one part per season. Part 4 is popular, not Part 3 and 5 popular but Kira is pretty high up there in Nipland. Fucking Part 1 got animated and that's the least popular part by far.  Lastly the Part 3 teaser was not anime-original. It was present in the manga as well. There was no Part 4 teaser in the manga       Is it just me or was the ending of this season kind of underwhelming?   There's a translation floating around. Here's what he says about part 4 and 8:   The town of Morio-cho appears in Parts 4 and 8, but they're in parallel worlds, so they aren't linked in time or space. The two Josukes would never meet each other normally. With this game, though, it becomes possible. At first I was bit taken aback. But then the bizarre nature to it all really got me interested. It's very entertaining. I would never allow something like this in the manga, but since this is a game, it's cool. Same thing with Jotaro fighting Dio Brando. The way the characters look is so different over the parts, though, that normally if you lined them all up they'd look very out of place with each other. But this game fixes all that, and I think that's one of its strengths.       It's called D4C.    if you look at the last post on their blog it mentions boco as the translator meaning at some time he stopped just fixing up duwang and got a real translator. I'm too lazy to check all those post but I assume he went back and fixed the ones simply fixed grammar on.    She might not be for all we know. I didn't hear mention of dear old dad in the epilogue. Could've been a whole other weird family line.  Josefumi was nowhere on the family tree, yet he seems to fully qualify as a "Joestar".   If a mangaka resets the universe of his setting in part 6, and then part 7 of the same story is part of a different but similar universe, wouldn't it be logical to assume it's the new universe? Especially considering there are no contradictions that say it can't be?         Steel Ball Run universe being Jojo parallel universe is an afterthought forced on Araki.   After reading part 5 ending I have to say that GER ability looked more like a time loop where GER chooses an action ( Diavolo's death) and right after that action happens the loop restarts and Diavolo is fated to do actions that will eventually lead to his death again. What if the "set to zero" is just a problem with the translation and it means "set as begining/end of the loop"? This is also seen when Diavolo is about to punch Giorno and with Epitaph he can see his future self repeating the same actions.     Did you read Jojolion? Josefumi IS NOT a Joestar. It would make no sense for him to be on the family tree.  Also Irene has the Joestar mark. She's a Joestar.      depending on how right or wrong this is, Diavolo never moved and everything was just epitaph seeing what should have happened. either way I think araki was going for a role reversal of what he did to bruno.    That makes significantly more sense than the other one. "Set to zero" is such a mind numbing thing to wrap your head around.  Could he reset a glass of water to zero, emptying it? Could he set my will to live to zero, eradicating me instantly? Could he set my bodies atomic magnetism to zero, also eradicating me instantly?  He can basically do whatever the fuck with such a broad ability.        It could even be a call back to the slowdown punch he pulled on bruno    Not that I disagree with you about the universes being different but Josefumi IS a Joestar. Look at his neck.    How do you think he would respond to some foreigner asking for a doujin he did 2 years ago?    Johnny's dad had a brother.  Solved.  I'm not saying that's a fact, or that I'm right, I'm just saying it's so easy to make either of us correct with a single sentence from Araki that talking about it right now is seriously retarded when we can't know for sure.       What are the chances josefumi is a bastard born of adultery like pt 4 josuke. Holly could be a harlot guys. She is the only living joestart nearby and old enough to be his parent. Maybe she has more in common with part 4 joseph than being crazy.    There will never be doujins of Irene and Jolyne fucking   There will never be   loli Jolyne doujins   why is liking jojo such suffering        &gt;There will never be   loli Jolyne doujins  Good  Lolyne is pure and only to be depicted having pure fun with Josuke.       Oh, reading it again, you're right. So he is. Doesn't really change the point though.      Joshua bar-Josef   from the house of David   David's father was Jesse/Ishai/Yishai of Judah   The Jojos just keep happening.        Confirmed.  Josefumi sorta shakes up everything we've come to know so far. The fact of the matter is, he and (possibly, who the fuck knows.) Irene are probably part of some offshoot branch of the Joestar family we don't know about yet.       parallel universes  i dont trust translations anon this could mean alternate or something else    They're going to continue animating Jojo, right?   I hope so, Anon.  I hope so.      But... That single sentence from Araki is pretty clear cut. They're separate worlds. There's not any way to rephrase it that would change the meaning of his words to support otherwise. You got me on the family tree thing though. Hadn't thought of that.      I'm pretty sure they mean OP 4     You mean Narancia isn't already a girl    It's actually パラレルワールド that he says, which is "parallel world" in English transliterated into Japanese.    Passionate lovemaking is one of the purest things imaginable.    People in these threads often forget about these guys.    i'd say it's a pretty safe bet     fuck the person who took this photograph let the man cry in private     I don't get it. What makes you say that?    agreed     Goerge Joestar   Anne      So GER's ability is basically Inazami from Naruto?  inb4 narutard      no that nigger is retarded you are retarded you are all retarded      all the teases, the clear love for jojo exuding from david make me feel safe in thinking that part 4 is coming it might be a year or so but i think it's coming     Inconsistent as fuck. I can't know whether Joseph is alive or not since they've dropped the fucking death dates from everyone but Kira.    which scans did you read? which group has the best scanlations?      implying you aren't  Well, it makes more sense than that "set to zero" bullshit     Nigger you are way too retarded. Explain me how did GER cancel time skips. Time loops? So you mean time is skipped every fucking 10 seconds? Also skipped time doesn't exist and you cannot loop it.  I said this already but Time Erasure &gt; Time Stop &gt; Time Rewind &gt; Time Acceleration       someone remade the Juves MAD with the anime   they used the pitched-down version  Fucking hell     How is erasing time better than accelerating it? Diavolo can skip time all he wants and the only thing he'll accomplish is Pucci accelerating even more.    Original timeline: ACDEFG (B got skipped, C is "Diavolo is about to punch Giorno and D is "Giorno gets punched") Then GER sets C to 0 and the timeline becomes:ACXYCXYCXYC where X and Y are "any actions that will eventually lead to C".      accelerating something that doesn't exist  Please don't be that guy. If anything Pucci is going to kill himself because MiH never accelerated in the first place and all the accumulated force will hit Pucci like a fucking truck.  Nigger, I said explain me how time skip before GER existed got nullified if it's power is a loop.       Yes, Diavolo can read the future and alter it to his liking and nobody remembers what happens during the time It Just Works activates. But as GER prevents harm from coming to Giorno it just leads to fucked up scenarios where Diavolo is stuck in a loop or whatever never able to touch Giorno.  GER doesn't create loops, that only occurs because of It Just Works tries to fuck with GER.      Because most diggy mo songs are copyright protected on YT now.     Nigger, I said explain me how time skip before GER existed got nullified if it's power is a loop.  What time skip?The only time skip that got nullified happened after GER was born    Riddle me this, /a/. Why people like uninteresting, dull characters like this? I get it, tsundere was a mistake and people hate noisy girls. But this can't be the answer.   In more and more shitty mangos can you find this archetype of the negative character building where you have the A supergirl, who can do shit and have a personality type, B supergirl who can do other shit and have another personality type and so on...  and then you have the contrast blob; a big pile of FUCKING NOTHING, they goo. And the MC likes her, because she has a cunny. I'm so mad about this. Why do authors do this? Why do they make 5 Mary Sues and a Shitty Susan?      Fuck you, m8. You're a fucking pedophile.  Onodera a best.     Kill yourself    Nice response, pedo.    Betas like boring-ass girls because they relate to them.     what I also don't get, how can people fawn over her, when the original didn't even had the character she was only introduced in the serialization.   And it's a huge mistake. Also they dumbed down the MC and left the heroine untouched. Harem settings corrupt everything. It'd have been a nice, straightforward story with only CHitoge but now it's all about shitty fanservice for Derafan otakushit,       Kosaki is shit. Chitoge is superior.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184051     retarded tripfag can't look at poster count and just assumes everyone on /a/ is the same person    Just end your life you fucking attention whore. Did the lack of love you received from your parents result into you becoming a trip fag or did you just want to show everyone that you're retarded?      I wanted to fuck that bitch pretty hard and mindbreak her into a cockslave    More like Shitoge, amirite?   Aw, poor baby. Look at how upset he is.       Plain and boring no personality deredere has always been the worst dere. Even hajidere is better and more interesting.    Everyone in Nisekoi is shit  Except Ruri       calls a tripfag out   l-look how mad he is!   You're not impressing anyone, just stop.       You Are (Not) Kevin-kun    Liking Kosaki Onodera    Even Lelouch has better taste than you.      Keep making your shit up, m8.    Then why are you replying, you clearly want attention. Just admit it already, it's kind of pathetic honestly.    He's a Sayakfag in the cancerous Madoka generals too    This. There is nothing worse than deredere girls.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184307  You're right, I should just let him continue being retarded.    How is it pathetic? I've been around here for over 4 years. Do you honestly think you're the first person to "crack the code".  It's more so pathetic that you truly think you're somehow better instead of loser who thinks he's smarter than everyone else.  Get wrecked, m8. Boring girls a best.        because beta nips can only handle bland doll charaters like onodera Rei     Bait  Chiwa isn't deredere like Onodera. She has a personality and bite to her. She's too spunky and competitive to be anything like Onodera.      I'm not even necessarily against deredere, but there's nothing to Dera's character, but that she can decorate food.    What a top quality thread, 10/10 Kill yourselves.     More like Shitoge, amirite?  its funny because you like the worst tsundere Louise      Why people like uninteresting, dull characters like this?    /a/ is mainly comprised of lonely spergs who are too ugly irl to get a gf, so instead of letting themselves get rejected by women over and over they just settle for cartoon girls since they cant reject them. it doesn't matter how poorly written the show or character is to these types of people, as long as the anime can provide them with cute grillz to ease their loneliness they will think it's a masterpiece. i call these types of people "shit eaters".       whole thread getting baited by a single tripfag   Stay mad his name isn't "anon"     Orange is genkidere. Get it right, shiteating Silverfag.   Normal girls are literally the best.   This is scarousing.    Chitoge is better, but Louise is good too, faggot. LN Louise is even great.    put your trip back on    Is she even relevant anymore? I stopped keeping up with the series.   Bset girl is Chiharu        Implying I only like Louise from ZnT.  And get the fuck off of it, m8. Louise a qt.    I'm too good to be here   or  Butthurt woman detected.   Not sure yet.            They're cute.   cunny  Kill yourself.        They sure are.     Maybe if you're a homosexual, faggot.    Ayumu had that one side plot with Hayate getting confessed to by a random minor character.   I'm gay tbh.   Literal perfection.   Because they represent that one girl they could never back when they used to be into 3D.   No one cares.    You do.   Here's the deal with liking so called "boring" girls and why people hate on them.  These girls are literally perfect. They don't have that stupid glaring character flaw that all other characters have nor are they perfect in every way like a Mary Sue. They are simply perfect for everything they do. They are what you expect the ideal girl to be like.  Pedophiles and women hate this. Pedophiles hate this because there's no such thing as a "boring" loli. They all fall into shitty character tropes and it offends them when they see a "boring" of age character. Women on the other hand are threatened because they know they'll never be as perfect as these 2D girls.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127185030  Still replied.       Megumi    normal   A girl that ditches her family vacation on the other side of the country and gets back home to help the loser of a MC with a heroine act, dragging the other two haremettes with her can hardly be called normal.       No, she's exactly what a woman should be. She is perfect, bro.     She's just a girl in love.      Megumi is awful. Almost as bad as Onodera.     I'm just saying that she's far from being a normal girl. She has her own quirks and does things that a truly average and normal girl wouldn't do.    fuck off you goddamn stupid retard     Eririfag get out.     Explain further.   The "pure Japanese waifu" is a popular archetype. That's literally all she is. The girls in Nisekoi are pretty flat in general, and Onodera is just the best waifu material out of the cast. Her sister is pretty cute though.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127185189  dont call me that    Megumi is a literal goddess. Kill yourself.      literally perfect   Onodera in the post:   borderline retarded   although the MC loves me and I (should) know that, I better cuck myself   I have no talents whatsoever   I have no personality whatsoever   doushio, Ruri-chan, please people let my cling to you since I can't do anything on my own               A personality is something that can be formed over time. Besides that, wouldn't you rather have a woman who is easy to read and please?     Yamato nadeshiko    Nisekoi is just a collection of lazy attempts to blindly follow archetypes, it shouldn't represent any of them in any significant way    I should have known that term. I never bothered to look it up.    There are people right now who likes dull deredere  Literally why. Might as well waifu a rock.    boring characters   in nisekoi  Wow who would've fucking guessed. Trash series trash characters.     It's not really that obvious he likes her due to the fact that he's still (fake) dating another girl. The simple fact is that he should notice that she likes him not the other way around.  Her talent is the ability to make sweets look good, not taste good. She also has a soothing voice and feeling.  She has a personality. She's kind of shy and she tries really hard, but she's also very easy to please. Giving her phone number to a guy is good enough for her and she's not rushing to get fucked in the backseat of a Buick like all the girls you like.   It's an amazing thing.           Kosaki isn't a vindictive bitch. She's better than Megumi.    Its cute. That's all it is but I love excessively dere characters. It would get boring after awhile though. Genki is best archetype.      I think Megumi being a little vindictive isn't so bad.    She bounces off the other characters in the cast and ends up having the most presence in the group, ironically going against the initial 'lack of presence' gags about her. She's just subtle. The other girls being extremely archetypical and cartoonish help in create a stark contrast as well.   There's nothing wrong with deredere girls. Onodera is a bad example though.   Eririfags are really bad at baiting.     cute   friendly demeanor   not a slut   shy but tries her hardest and things happen  I don't think you know what dull means.  You're the type to say Vanilla is plain when it's the best and most flavourful ice cream.            Only Eririfags can hate boring and dull dereshit  Megumifags are seriously bad.       Only an Eririfag could hate Megumi.     Only Eririfags hare enough shit taste to hate her, yes. The sun is hot too.     Megumifags think she loves Aki   Reminder that her feelings for him aren't romantic. Enjoy your friendship end.       there's literally nothing wrong with being an Eririfag   has a hobby   passionate   talented   kind   loyal   dedicated   warm-hearted  once again:  has a hobby   has something other than her love life to the character                 That's what Eririfags tell themselves to believe she has a chance in the bowl.     They're practically a married couple by Volume 8.      Proving my point. Awesome.      Don't forget   a traitor       lmao   Top fucking kek. It's sad to see your ahop sink, huh, Eririfag?     thinks Megumi is "boring and dull dereshit"   Right back at you.     Plain girls are the most loyal and make the best wives   Our point has been proven over the course of Saekano threads since it started airing. You're defending the indefensible.

Even then, she would revert back to her bitchy self at the drop of a hat.  has something other than her love life to the character  She's still behind the other two girls. Well, maybe she has surpassed Utaha by now.                   I don't even know what show you're talking about  I just saw all the retarded shit in this thread and wanted to comment on it      Yoshida   Himeji   Ichika   Arashiko   Kosaki   Megumi   Akane   All worst or shitty girls  There's no such thing as a good deredere.           Fuck off I said.    How cute, hiding behind "opinions" to save face.     Megumifags are this mad and paranoid      And yours is a shit opinion. Anyone who's read or watched Saekano knows that Megumi is anything but "boring dereshit."     You're stating the obvious.    Just take a moment to look at yourself and see how upset you're getting on the internet over something so inconsequential    Megumi isn't deredere and she's good, faggot.   OP BTFO.           These aren't Megumifags. These are reverse trolls trying to make Megumifags look bad.            Angry Eririfag detected.

I'm not masochistic enough to read the manga    OP is right though. Also, your taste is shit and you're a tripfag. Your posts itt are invalid.     Megumi does jack shit.    You haven't even seen the fucking show. Stop being a retard.      But OP isn't wrong.     See?     Kek. All this denial.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186311  Damn it, why didn't I drop this   How did a Nisekoi thread turn into a Saekano thread?   You give yourself away too easy, Eririfag.    Curious. Why haven't you killed yourself yet?   Normal girls are lovely  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186410  You're the autist fucking Eririfag.    Eririfags seeking for attention as usual.    Because I enjoy being superior to fags who insult my perfect taste.     Nah, they are Megumifags. The same shitposters who starts shit all the time in Saekano threads. They love blaming victim and shifting the blame to Eririfags. Megumifags are the worst isn't a saying for nothing.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186462  Nice try.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186410  You used Onodera as an example, you'd think it be more of a Nisekoi waifu war than a Saekano waifu war. Also, calm down, you flaming autist.      up to the manga chapter 175 nothing will happen  except for the usual  something almost happens         You've got it backwards, Eririfags usually start shit. There's a reason everyone hates them.     That bullshit is so funny. Sakeano threads for the last couple of weeks have been peaceful and civil, and coincidentally Eririfags weren't active. They turn to shit when Eririfags start shitposting.     Randomly raging and attacking anyone  Reverse troll. Don't fall for this, /a/     Saekano and Nisekoi thread   If ever there were a time to remove a collection of posters from /a/, now would be it      It's a lot easier to defend Megumi than Onodera. She's easily one of the best done "normal" girls in anime.     Liking Chitoge unironically  I don't understand her deal. Violent tsundere hitting MC for nothing. Nothing new.  "It's fine because she is a girl"   "it's fine because it's not real"  The thing is she is still tsuntsun and not dere. Only good part of tsundere is the gap moe when they turn totaly dere.  Tsugumi  Violent cuck.  imouto  Better tsundere than Chitoge.  Marika  Best girl. She would never do something that would upset MC. Truly a best waifu.  Onodera  Second best girl. But she needs to step up and be independet already.              Completely 100% on OPs side. I cannot think of a single bland character that I ever liked.  Worst is Hinata. She's literally shit, has nothing but big boobs. No personality. Her eyes are disgusting.  I hate you all you shit taste faggots.       But it's true, Eririfags are the ones trying to ruin this thread.    butthurt sakurafag detected    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186410  Seriously, are people retarded? People have only been discussing characters that are related to the topic. There is no Nisekoi or Saenai thread or anything. It's simply deredere thread.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186591  Then I'd have to go outside or watch anime    I hate Hinata too. Sakura is kinda bad, but she's tons better than her.    Her banter is really entertaining to watch. She is a good conversationalist.    Megumi a best.  Onodera a best.     Megumifags' butt are extra sensitive to asspain today. They think a handful of posts discussing Megumi suddenly makes it a Saekano thread. More retarded is how they think talking about her is ruining the thread.   I think I've entered a thread of irrationally angry people.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127184124  Avatar fagging is when you use a single character for all of your reaction images, including it in every post.  Newfags need to learn this.       discussing  Yeah, insulting and bashing her for no reason is "discussing".    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127186736  I told him in the other thread I'd BTFO because he's a pedophile with terrible taste.   Tsugumi &gt; Chitoge &gt; Yui &gt; Haru &gt; Marika &gt; Paula &gt; Kosaki &gt; Ruri Utaha &gt; Eriri &gt; Megumi &gt; Michiru     a tsundere faggot placing megumi and kosaki among the last   Color me surprised.      I'm sorry, Anon-chan.  That taste just proves it's terminal.      At this point I think it's just people being contrarians for the sake of getting replies. Megumi is one of the most well-received heroines I've ever seen, and that's a damn accomplishment in a harem series. The arguments made against her are easy to debunk. She's a good character that earns her respect and popularity from the scratch (unlike the already popular twintail childhood friend tsundere and kuudere girls that gain fans loyal to the archetype from the get-go) and is difficult to genuinely dislike. You can see how the author puts the most effort writing her.    turn on recursive hiding to filter kevin   half the thread disappears     Kosaki &gt; Chitoge &gt; Haru &gt; Yui &gt; Ruri &gt; Marika &gt; Paula &gt;Tsgumi  Eriri &gt; Utaha &gt; Megumi &gt; Michiru      Chitoge &gt; Marika &gt; Haru = Ruri = Paula &gt; Tsugumi &gt; Kosaki  Megumi &gt; Utaha &gt; Eriri &gt; Izumi &gt; Michiru      Replace Tsgumi with Chitoge and then Paula with Yui.   We only need the Inou Battle fanbase here.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187407   Yahari   They're well contained in their threads at least.      I hate how dumb downed the mc is. Atleast in danmachi which is also kinda harem shit, the mc wants a harem and the girls.     Inou Battle  Another dere girl who is best.     I do not like Tsgumi though    Jesus. She was pretty damn perfect. Best hair and eyebrows. If she only wore glasses.   Bland girls are the best.   Back to /pol/ or /v/, negro.    She doesn't look like she wins.   But she has those tits, man.         Speaking about Zero no Tsukaima, who /Henrietta-ohime/ here?      Tits are not everything  You must learn to not be ruled by tits      ma nigga    Holy shit, man. That almost NTR scene. Fuck. I still love it.   Of course I'm not rules by tits. There's more to her that I like. For example, her ED was tits.       NTR Princess was the best.   In the manga, does Haru ever figure out that Raku is her prince?   She was perfection.    Yes. She finds out the same time she finds out he's in a fake relationship.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187862  Heh.      Fuckoff  Onodera and Tadakoro is best girl of this season.why you cannot understand it?   when is kevin killing himself? i've been waiting for so long now do it just like the rest, you're already following their footsteps anyway    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187957  I'd rather have neither they're both long overdue for a bullet in the brain     Yeah.    Megu-chan makes magical things to my dick! Help, my hips are moving on the ir own!   Back to /v/.    talent   actually mattering when considering someone as a person   Back to /pol/, racist piece of shit.   Ok, you do place an interesting view here, like almost none of these other ret/a/rds. Please elabora un poco más weh. I mean to elaborate a bit more if you would.                 Follow the rest  wut   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127187957  Edgy as fuck.         Ayano isn't bland, she is a hero of justice.    should we tell him?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188108  I hate your post number.     aizwallensteinpastahere     So who exactly is your waifu Kevin-kun?    She didn't do anything though.    My nigger. Megumi a best.     Opened Megumi appreciation thread before   Implying Megumi is boring  Really?      She's not all that plain though. She's a closeted slut. If she wasn't in love with Raku, she'd be the town bicycle.    It's hard to explain, but I do not mean boring in the sense that she's unlikable. More in the sense that she doesn't have any over the top flare and that's what makes her so good. She isn't exaggerated.    I'm kidding, of course. Don't ask stupid questions.         I've been around here for over 4 years  Congratulations! You've become one of the most well documented losers of the board! What's the next step, Kevin? McDonalds?      I get it, tsundere was a mistake  I beg your pardon?      Implying I'm a loser NEET like you.      They are. They are almost always the worst girl.      Marika   best girl   All this patrician taste here.       I know this is bait but the only shit tsunderes that come to my mind are Eriri, Kirino, and Louise.    You post on /r9k/, I don't think you're in a position to talk down to anyone    She saved her siblings from being consumed by their power. And her self-sacrifice indirectly did end up saving everyone in the anime timeline, even if it did cause more suffering to every single person in the meanwhile and ended up helping the villain.

Sorry but I found Megumi more interesting, at least I wouldn't feel any sort of uneasiness in front of her    I still take issue with this chart.

I want to know what a psychologist would think about you  You may be interested to know that he's a law enforcement officer IRL. That's right, your traffic cop might be the most cancerous tripfag on /a/.     Considering I image dump a lot and I've posted more than 33 today alone then no, I don't think I do.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188671  Yeah, I changed Kevin to Mobile. Though I'm not sure why you haven't been banned.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188708   Troid's Madoka circlejerk shitholes  Those are approved by Troid? Holy shit, no wonder the blogging and imagespamming tripfags never get banned.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188708  And I lost it. Aren't you permabanned from /a/?  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188797  wut       liking violent tsundere  sasuga /a/ doesn't disappoint me ever  well i knew everyone here had shit taste though       Still missing Akiha      When will you faggots learn that Kurisu isn't a tsundere    Because they don't need character development, they can just remain dere and boring for the whole series.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127188883   Implying I destroyed a shitposting hugbox thread with my dissenting opinion.   Well frankly because you're an underage piece of cancer.       Dull(specifically deredere) person hate thread exactly  I thought of it as Nisekoi thread until some hardcore Saekanofag come out shitting each other's waifu     Longhairdera is cute! Cute!!!!    like Sayaka   go to Madoka thread to talk about her   Kevin is spamming her as usual   fuck    like Onodera   enter Nisekoi thread   Kevin being a shit again and spamming her   FUCK             I mean to elaborate a bit more if you would.  Well, there isn't much else to say. Just think about it, if she truly was an average and normal girl, she would have been overshadowed by the two queens of the school, Utaha and Eriri. But no, she does unexpected things, is pretty much in control of the situation and is the central figure everyone gravitates towards.     Maybe you (are) kevin-kun   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189008  He used Onodera as a pictorial example. I responded with Onodera and how she was a great character and I even expand on my feelings in other parts of the thread. So yep.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189076  That's because he posted it in a fucking Fate thread AND he used that pedophile word.      Most anime girls have fucking obnoxious quirks.  The "normal blob" is the closest thing to a reasonable person in their respective shows.     They always got their own thread, sometime even more than 2 That's too much space for waifu war though    Tsundere is fine but  I will hit you for no reason cuz i am a gurl  types are the worst  What type is Marika?  best girl type :^)        Marika is the manipulative cunt type.  Best girl.      Marika actually is the  death flag -type.    The thing about some shows with "violent" tsundere (and honestly a slap or two to a dense MC never hurt him) is that they end before reaching the crucial development in the source material where the girl transitions from tsun to dere. So when people scream about a tsundere being shit they are being animeonlyfags and filthy secondaries. They're probably Americans too, because  reading is for faggots!    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412  Anon fucking hell you murdered him.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412    Anon. Best tsundere is the one who switches back and forth and not violent one. Even her tsun is cute and it's not annoying. And her dere won't be boring too soon.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412  rekt                literally reddit the girl                We all know but will we care? We are not even the dense virgin faggot Raku      Eririfag coming back for more after getting BTFO earlier    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127189412  Ice burns.     Put Rin and Shana in the good side, move down Chidori and your chart will be fucking perfect.     Wrong girl. Utaha is reddit.   Megumi is MAL.     Kevin, you literally ruin threads by posting. Why won't you take off the trip?   Nope. Megumi is /a/.     Megumi is /a/.      Everyone who hates Megumi is the same Eririfag. I just know it!  Megumifag again showing how delusional and bad he can be. The only one who got BTFO was you by being retarded.     There he is again!   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190140  The thread's dead already. I could post whatever I wanted and it couldn't get any worse.     She is. Look at the Saekano threads lately, they are almost completely comprised of Megumifags.     She's the most popular Saekano girl here by a huge margin.     There he is again!  Literally irony. The other anon isn't even me. Stay butthurt and retarded, Megumifag.     You sure do love to respond whenever someone says something against Eririfags. You're too easy to spot out.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190212  My bump is also irrelevant, given the post rate on this thread.     Reddit lurks /a/ all the time. You guys should go back to Reddit.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190263    samefagging   too easy to spot out.  Keep being ironic.      <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190323   Michiru   the girl whose popularity dropped faster than Kotoura-san   You're even more delusional than the average Eririfag.        Utaha is reddit. I still remember those stupid weekly Utaha posts that were copypasted from there.    Megumi a shit. Worse than Kosaki.   This.   This show needs better porn.   Keep being retarded.    this whole thread    Megumi is shit, but she isn't that shitty. Megumi has worst fans compared to Kosaki though.      look at me guise, I can post with my phone!     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190422  <br/>    Eriri has the shittiest fans of all though. As expected of the worst girl.     Eririfag PLEASE.     Worst fans for worst girl. Makes perfect sense.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190501   Michirufags barely even exist. Her throwing out Tomoya's stuff hurt her popularity a lot.     Don't insult the people who browse 4chan on their phone. One of them might be moot.    If Megumi is anything like her fans ITT, then I'm sure she has to be THAT bad.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190501  Holy shit, your delusion is extreme. Eriri and Utaha were the main reasons people took a look at the show. Michiru was mildly popular during week 0. Things changed a lot and Michiru is the least popular girl of the bunch while Megumifags are practically all over /a/.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190408       Nice try. You won't change the fact Eririfags are the worst fans. Saekano threads lately are proof.    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190686   ripping limited edition posters   Still a shit.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190686   pretend Michiru isn't one of the most popular and best girls.   No one is pretending. Michiru barely has fans. You have to be fucking delusional to believe she has more fans than Megumi, Eriri or Utaha.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190676  Oh, I'm just not liking that poster anymore.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190686  I wouldn't know. I'm far from the cancerous blight on this board. I'm thinking that title falls squarely on your shoulders.       You won't fool anyone, Megumifag. No other side uses cancerous buzzwords and shitpost ad nauseam like you guys do. And always provoking and starting shit with other fans who don't praise your super popular girl as best.    Objectively correct   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190721  Get off, /a/ you fucking piece of shit.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127190819  So edgy. I can see you rage from behind the screen. Isn't it bed time for you, child?    How funny. You described Eririfags. Are you a comedian or something?    Her actions didn't save them, inevitability saved them.  Hebi-kun literally could not win, he could only loop until he eventually lost. Combining eyes is the power of God, and it decreed that all the snakes would unite in the real world.      Denial won't change history.    Quiet, shy, submissive girls who blush a lot are cute and desirable. They make the best waifus.    Megumifags get along with Utahafags very well. It's not a wonder because most have the two girls as first or second favorites. Threads consisting of those fanbases posting are nice and have good discussions. On the other hand, finding an Eririfag who isn't super defensive and provocative is rare. Finding a shitstorm not started by an Eririfag is rare. Eririfags are blemishes on what would be a better fanbase without them.      Please show. For science.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127191008  Delusional as fuck. Michiru fans don't make even more than 5% of the total general Saenai fanase on /a/. Eriri often has more fans than Utaha who's already pretty small.    Right back at you.    Eririfags get along with Utahafags very well. It's not a wonder because most have the two girls as first or second favorites. Threads consisting of those fanbases posting are nice and have good discussions. On the other hand, finding an Megumifag who isn't super defensive and provocative is rare. Finding a shitstorm not started by an Megumifag is rare. Megumifags are blemishes on what would be a better fanbase without them.    Wasn't this posted in that FSN thread about Rin's H scenes?    Parroting doesn't work when you're straight out spouting bullshit.    tsun entire series   1 episode of dere   she wins the MCb owl   meanwhile normal girl enjoys being cucked   only one who truly suffers is best girl who was showering MC with love from the first episode  The reason worst girls always win is this. Gap moe. Tsun-dere is too strong for retards like nips. Normal girls are just there for getting cucked. They most likely knew MC more than anyone. Like childhood friends. Best girls never win because they are too alpha for nips. Also if MC loved back the best girl shit would end.  THAT'S WHY HAREM IS SHIT           Saekano threads with Eririfags   nothing but shitposts   Saekano threads without Eririfags   chill thread   Guess which threads we've been having lately.          Just go to the archive and search for "weekly Utaha."      This      bullshit  Apply yourself.      Literally everyone hates Eririfags. I can't remember the last time an Utahafag supported an Eririfag but Utahafags generally don't mind Megumifags.     I can post threads to support my claim if you want. I know you won't because you know you're wrong anyway.    That's because Eririfags are exactly like the character they emulate. The same thing with Utahafags.   Thank you janitor-kun.  Go get a hot pocket mod, you've done well.    Nice phone.  Sprouting bullshit still won't change facts. There has always been fans who likes Eriri most and have Utaha as second. Same goes for Megumi first and Utaha second. But of late because of Eriri x Utaha, more Utahafags are okay with Eriri rather than Megumi.   The cause of any shitstorm that ruins threads are caused mainly by Megumifags who starts shit with Eririfags. Remove Megumifags and threads will be nice.          implying samefag   Why are you so delusional? Way to lose your credibility.       The cause of any shitstorm that ruins threads are caused mainly by Megumifags who starts shit with Eririfags. Remove Megumifags and threads will be nice.   Explain why Saekano threads lately have been so good. I'll tell you why, it's because Volume 8 nuked every other fan out of existence.       Start Megumi thread.   Eririfags come in and try and ruin it.   Buuuuuuuuuut guyyyyyyyyyys! It's the Megumifags that are doing it!        It's okay whenever I imply samefag, but it's not okay when people do it to me.    Being better than Yahari doesn't make it good.        What do you have against phones?  Also, the reason why any thread turns into a shitstorm of baiting, trolling, and pissing contests is because anons hate different.        The cause of any shitstorm that ruins threads are caused mainly by Megumifags who starts shit with Eririfags. Remove Megumifags and threads will be nice  True for the most part. Fucking THK is shitposting Eriri as a Megumifag, for fuck's sake.     It's funny because you can tell the time the Eriri shitposters come into a thread. First they try to be subtle posting an "eriri best" post, and then wait some minutes to start shitposting. Saekano threads can last a whole day free of trolling and by extension free of Eririfags.    Samefag device.   Responsible, mature, but shy girls are the best.    It's funny because you can tell the time the Megumi shitposters come into a thread. First they try to be subtle posting an "Megumi a best" post, and then wait some minutes to start shitposting on Eriri or start obnoxious circlejerking for Megumi to the point of bait. Saekano threads can last a whole day free of trolling and by extension free of Megumifags.      anyone who hates Eriri is THK   Exactly why everyone hates Eririfags.      Megumifags are an inherent part of Saekano threads. Eriri is far less popular and her fans are less involved with the threads. Just look at the thread when volume 8 came out. Not a single Eririfag was there.    Normal girls are a breath of fresh air after all those deres (and the occasional genki)     Implying I said or implied anyone  THK apologist pls go.     That's because Eriri is becoming more and more a villain in the novels. She's going to become the big bad boss in the end.     Not a single Eririfag was there.  Was your head so stuck up your ass that it made you blind to every single post for Eriri?      Saekano threads can last a whole day free of trolling and by extension free of Megumifags.   That's impossible and you know it. Megumifags are the vast majority of the fanbase, killing them would kill the threads.     Tell me what kind is this.   Normal is good. But Onodera is just dull. And hamster is nothing like her. Hamster fights for what she wants    Care to point them out? https://archive.moe/a/thread/126949<wbr>717  That's right, you can't. And the thread was up for a whole day.  </wbr>     Is it just me or Megumifag are usually being vocal? I mean she's already being considered as the "best girl" and the point shitting other fag is?    I'm just stating facts, and it is a fact that Eririfags are an underwhelming minority.     Start top   Scroll down slowly   Already see Eririfags calling her reddit girl  Ohkay.         anon is trying to contribute to the original discussion of the thread    other anons are just shitposting and baiting each other   You have my sympathies, anon         It would be really sad if he was actually an Eririfag and decided to shitpost instead of support his girl.  It speaks a lot about the quality of the Eriri fanbase.       This is obviously a parody character based off the Tu-Love-Ru character "Yui". They even have the same name, personality, and physical appearance.     You shouldn't give me your sympathies. I've argued with people in 90% of the threads I've entered. I'm no better than the shitposters.    I see three haters in there. They must be Eririfags because only Eririfags hate Megumi, right? I barely see Utahafags and Michirufags as well. Or what? Since it's volume spoiler stalk, everyone switched to talking about the volume instead of opting to spam a best and circlejerk?   Barely 250 posts for a thread that's up for a full day   Not even more than 50 posters  That reminds me, Saekano is nearing ded.         That reminds me, Saekano is nearing ded.   Check the volume 8 thread.      Onodera and megumi are goddess you faggot    There is a sizable amount of Utahafags in the thread. Even a Michirufag. Stop including shitposters because they don't count as fans.   Either way, it proves that Megumifags and Utahafags to a lesser extent are the ones in charge of novel discussion and talk and thus the people who make the important part of the fanbase. Eririfags could disappear and nobody would miss them.      I know. Ayumu is my waifu and Onodera is my least favourite Nisekoi.   Normal is usually great though, so I was defending normal in general.      That was the volume 8 thread. Only the summary thread for volume 8 yielded greater activity and had fans coming out of the woods. But that's typical due to hype for a new volume. When things go back to normal, it'll be back to being kinda ded-ish.    sizable  3, maybe four.  a  Just one.   shitposters  Any person who doesn't like your favorite girl?  You're grasping at straws. Like it or not, only Megumifags and Eririfags going at it birthed the most serious topics that is related to LN discussions and debates. Utahafags hardly ever get into that stuff.              We Saenai thread now  I remember we had an Eriri thread last Wednesday. It was fairly civil and nicedespite the few anti-posts made mainly by...Megumi fans. Luckily, Eriri fans mostly ignored them.    Eriri is a traitor!    I recall that thread. Remove Megumi.     Any person who doesn't like your favorite girl?  The "reddit girl" posts are literal shitposts you faggot.   only Megumifags and Eririfags going at it birthed the most serious topics that is related to LN discussions and debates  And that isn't even the point. Saekano threads can survive only with Megumifags. Eririfags aren't even all that active. Yesterday's thread is another example.  You can even spot the moment Eririfags tried to ruin it.         This Nigga get's it Onodera a best. She deserves better than that limp dicked faggot.     Amen.    Or, you know, his opinion. That guy is expressing his dislike in a more tasteful way than straight out making a shit posts like certain other haters do. It's the same as the DROPPED anon.  That's what you think. In any case, that isn't the point of the argument. Megumifags are the ones who tend to start shit because of Eriri.   another example  You're only showing Utahafags' retarded delusions from last night. Eririfags barely made a mess in there.         You mean this reposted thread? https://archive.moe/a/search/text/b<wbr>lond/image/GUpOOPIn-fy-w1PZkD-kWg/  People will react negatively to obnoxious behaviour. Bearing with that is part of being an Eririfag I guess.  </wbr>       last Wednesday <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;126818272     Picking at a fan who list traits and reasons why she's perfect and make a rhetoric question out of it  If you think that's obnoxious, you must really be negative to Megumifags at their worst when they jerk over each other about how much of a Goddess their girl is.        his opinion   When even mods delete his "opinions" every fucking time, you can't deny that it is worthless garbage.   Megumifags are the ones who tend to start shit because of Eriri.   No. It's the opposite more often than not.  And yeah, that Utahafag is cancerous as fuck, but people didn't feed him any further and kept on discussing. Eririfags tried to start shit again later on.           I think the obnoxious part is reposting the thread, or even making a thread with that OP.    Less than half, actually. It's still his opinion and more tasteful form of anti-posts than most other.   Eririfags stating Eriri is best means starting shit  With that logic, OP who is a Megumifag is already the first to start shit before anyone else. At least that's all Eririfags do. Megumifags are worse for replying back with shit this and that.   What are you talking about? Pretty sure that's the first time we had that kind of thread and topic.           /sp/ tier spam that gets removed by mods   more tasteful  You're delusional.   Megumifags  Pretty sure you don't have to be a Megumifag to hate her. Plus Eririfags hardly talk about her character. They mostly jerk over her design. That lowers the quality of posting a lot.   What are you talking about  The reposted thread. Reread your own post.             /sp/  How would you know that?   Pretty sure you don't have to be a Megumifag to hate her.  Yes, sure. Just like you don't have to be a Eririfag to hate Megumi, right?   hardly talk about her character   mostly jerk over her design.  You're confusing Utahafags for Eririfags there. Her design is praiseworthy, that's a given. But Eririfags like her as a cute tsundere and precious childhood friend most of the time too.    The reposted thread.  The link I gave isn't a reposted thread. You're drugs.                I can't remember the last time someone has praised Eririfag for her personality.     Megumi is less hated and most of the times it's an Eririfag baiting to shift the shitposting away from his girl.  Also, Utahafags are capable of discussing beyond muh pantyhouse. Fuck, I could write a better Eriri support post - without even being an Eririfag - than your average Eririfag.      I did just now. The guy getting nitpicked here  more or less does the same. Really, stop with the theatrics since it makes you look dumb.   You're helping my point. Of course Megumi is less hated for an obvious reason. Megumifags are the driving force behind Eriri's shitposts. They are the one who starts shit first. Any attempt to hate Megumi back will be seen as shifting shitpost in your eyes, but that's not the point here.  Most Utaha praise posts are really because of her design and body. Utahafags don't post that often, so it's not hard to see that when they do post. You can see Lelouch do that all the time.   I could write a better Eriri support post   You're a hater, there's no way you can ever say anything decent about Eriri's character. Do it then if you think you can.             Megumifags are the driving force behind Eriri's shitposts.   It's the rule of the dominant fanbase. Without going too far from this thread, it's exactly like how Chitogefags hate Kosaki and Kosakifags.      No it isn't. Plenty of fanbase go without shitposting or waifu wars. Besides, Megumifags are trying to profess for civil quality, but they''re the ones who make threads not civil vast majority of the time. Nisekoi is ridden with mutual waifu wars that don't care about the state of their threads, so it's not the same.    Yet Kosakifags tend to get the most shit from everyone else. It's similar to Eririfans. They're the dominated fanbases.     everyone  You mean mostly from Chitogefags and rationalizing doesn't make it a rule. Kosakifags and Chitogefags engage in shit-flings constantly, sometimes the former can be more loud than the latter at times.     I dunno. Harufags are also prime Kosaki haters. Marikafags and Tsugumifags to a lesser extent too.    No, Bell only wants one girl.    Harufags are a minority. Marikafags and Tsugumifags are less vocal than Kosakifags and Chitogefags and there are some who dislikes both or likes one over the other. It's really not one-sided for them.    Eriri is a polarizing character, her getting hate can't be helped. It's up to Eririfags to deal with it or start a waifuwar in retaliation. That's why threads that lack Eririfags are decent.  And contrary to what you believe, I like Eriri. I just hate her fans.   Do it then if you think you can.  It's not hard when 90% of pro-Eriri posts can be summed up as muh tsundere, twintails, ZR, DFC, childhood friend, etc.  For one thing, she's a sheltered, emotionally weak girl. She's selfish but deep down still has some consideration for others in her own way. She commits mistakes and makes poor choices that hurts others close to her, but she suffers for them too. She doesn't mean harm even if her tsundere pride and short fuse gets in the way most times. She's immature and easy to pick on, yet her passion and dedication for her dreams inspires a strong feeling of affection and respect towards her.   There.             Chitoge = Tsugumi = Ruri &gt; Haru &gt; Yui &gt; Marika &gt; Paula &gt; Kosaki    She would be fine in a different series, but she has zero chemistry with the MC and is really dull outside of that one scene. Red is better if only because her interactions with the MC are actually interesting.    She's genki, though.    All this fucking Haru advertising   Only shows up in two episodes   Fucking hell SHAFT      Megumi must be polarizing if Eriri is since she is at the end of the other side of the spectrum (can be perceived as boring, bland, dull, plain, normal, etc), being Eriri's opposite and all. So it can't be helped that she gets hate too then? A thread that lacks Megumifags will also be decent for the same reason in reversed.  You can't blame me for finding that difficult to believe right now.  So you can say something decent. But it's quite a mix match of some similar stuff Eririfags have said before when they argue against detractors who don't care about any of that.        She is definitely OP related. A deredere that cannot connect with the MC on an interesting, fun, or intimate level is terrible. It doesn't help that she isn't cute for creating awkwardness due to trying too hard.     the chihuahua is not deredere, that she's more bipolar thank pink,  black is deredere      Megumi is liked by the great majority. Her being perceived as boring, bland or dull was a prominent opinion when the show started, but it slowly became reversed as she was proving herself to be a compelling and interesting heroine. Fuck, the few detractors dropped those terms and tried to bash her for being sly and manipulative by the end of the season. She isn't really the opposite of Eriri.    But it's quite a mix match of some similar stuff Eririfags have said before  Do you really believe I just compiled old Eriri posts in mine? It's not like you can say much more about her, those are her defining traits.       But Red was terrible. She and the autismlord MC were the worst parts of the show.    Some detractors do think she is boring, bland, and all that though. Bitchy, manipulative, etc is something fairly recent and that's a tangent from main detractors.  I would correct you on the point of sheltered since she really isn't so, but she is an ojou. I would expand on how she is small but feisty, sharp and crude but not overbearing and without an endearment that lends from the fact she is emotionally weak and delicate despite the strong disposition she generally shows to people. Those who get close enough to her can see the sweetness lurking in her and also her true character that she normally suppress. Not least or last, the fact Eriri holds an interesting position in the series as the heroine who induces conflict the most among others who are more on the goody/neutral side of things. As one knows, conflict resolution is an essential recipe for good characters and interesting development.       Not watching a chuuni series for the interesting and cute interactions between the chuuni MC and closet chuuni tsundere with real chemistry   You might want to get your taste and brain looked at.      Honestly, I find hard to believe those who say she's boring. Different opinions and all, but it feels like they're justifying themselves with the title of the show and bait with it.   I haven't seen such a cancerous thread in a while. Good job.  Kosaki &gt; Haru &gt; Marika &gt;Tsugumi &gt; Chitoge &gt; Ruri = Paula    There's nothing dull or uninteresting about Onodera.     And there are almost 100 posts of pure cancer deleted.    HARU A SHIT Onodera masterrace reporting in.    Whose gonna win the Rakubowl you reckon?   Not Onoshitdera   Onodera obviously.  What kind of question is that?   Threads like these are why we need forced anon.  How disgusting      show is about chuunis   hating the main chuunis  You are literally retarded.      Chitoge. It's been set up that way ever since the oneshot came out. Even most onoderafags have accepted this.     A thread that lacks Megumifags will also be decent for the same reason in reversed.  A thread without Megumifags is a dead thread.    Normal girls are the best. Simply the best.    Minami Shimada  She will forever be underappreciated. I miss my waifu and it's a shame that season 3 won't ever happen  pic is not best girl but she's worth a mention        Like it or not, only Megumifags and Eririfags going at it birthed the most serious topics that is related to LN discussions and debates  I remember the Eriri defense force arguing against everyone else in the threads until they get the last word in. Eriri fans are by far the most reactive, vocal and autistic part of the fanbase, the topics have much better atmosphere and more productive discussion when Eriri fans aren't participating in them.     That girl, really? She's so plain, bland, and...normal, a bitchy girl like Sera is better.    It's because they think she's the extremely passive and nurturing type and easy to be with.    You would still fuck her given the chance, wouldn't you?.    For mind breaking purposes.    She backs off too much, even a loli can outdo her with that zombie    Not that guy, but that's biased crap and pretty BS. For one thing, Eririb haters are by far the most autistic and malicious bunch. I have seen recycled and debunked arguments from haters that still get thrown around. Her haters try extremely to force a taboo and a us vs them thing, and that is beyond obnoxious and instant hostile atmosphere that begets trolling and heated shitposting. Infamous THK also unfortunately frequents Saekano threads. That guy is leagues above any autistic shitposters.   Tsundere &gt; Boring    tsundere   good   Shit taste in women anon. At least go with Kuudere or genki       No man, they even react violently and aggressively for posts not liking something as inconsequential as dfc or twintails. With fans like them it's hard to have civil and chill threads.     Not wholeheartedly loving dfc and twintails  I think the problem is that you don't belong here.     WHAT TYPE IS MARIKA? OJOU? YANDERE?     THK  No, you are the autistic shitposter. Delusional and paranoid too.     Sounds like /a/ is doing its job by shitting on normalfags. That's a good thing.    Lurk moar and educate yourself.   Taiga is toradorable!   FUCKS LIKE A TAIGA    Taiga is torable    You can see your penis bulging in her stomuch      Perfection   taiga a cute   Yes. Yes.    Dies during childbirth and leaves Ryuji a single father.    That's Clannad, numbnuts    Who is to say that won't also be Ryuji's fate?    C-Sections are a thing    I want to fuck Taiga like a tiger.   More Taiga http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>38754</wbr>   Taiga thread?   Cunt.    Yes, you are.   In the end, does this count as yuri or not.    Anyone?  So, what if the chances of this being localized? Everyone seems to think there's no chance, and if this was even two years ago I'd agree. But with the recent western success of Senran Kagura and Hyperdimension neptunia on the lewd front, as well as zero escape and Dangan ronpa on the twist filled VN front, I'd say there's a pretty good chance.  Damn .. The feels   I'd say 78% We still don't know what 4inifity is. Maybe it's a localization.     If you ask me, since 5pb's behind it, it's probably going to be a mix of if the Punchline video game does well in Japan and Steins;Gate doing well in the west with the new PS3/Vita release.   I know this is just the neutral end but I'm pissed Pine/Yuuta died for no reason  Let's hope the next one actually has the brains to fucking stay alive when being handed the opportunity      Let's hope the next one actually has the brains to fucking stay alive  That's your job, anon.     Is living in a possibly immortal body alone (except a bunch of weak no-name fagets) such a good thing? I'd say sacrifice Chiyoko.     That's your job, anon.  haha touche    PL twitter page says there'll be more info about the game this week or the next.   No, tis not the body but the soul that counts.    Yes. Or if not, just play the game and get a yuri end.     Does he count as a transgender protagonist?   In the end, its still shit   Is 78% a meme that I've just never seen before or something? This was getting spammed in another thread I was in earlier.    Was just my guess   It doesn't count as yuri because it's not even explicitly romantic. There were hints but it didn't go anywhere. It was a friendship end.   Shit end fitting for a shit show. Deserves to be the new samurai flamenco aka flop of the season.    No anon, as long as you play the game all can be forgiven. The game is all that matters. The anime doesn't need to be able to stand on its own two legs even a little bit.    Teraoka didn't even end up getting punished.  Really it would've been better if Yuuta just let her sacrifice herself.     feels  did you do the dank r9k frog meme face irl?      tfw Punchline was a letdown   tfw HxH and Bagserk on infinite hiatus   tfw Totsuka didn't win      What was up with the scene with Chiyoko in her idol group near the end? Is she still alive or what?   play the game for the true ending  It doesn't matter, that's not OUR Yuuta. That's someone else. Our Pine is dead and he's not coming back. https://d.maxfile.ro/tyoxzuazyk.mp4<wbr></wbr>     It's still Pine   Is it just me or was the spirit yuta smarter than yuta?   I'm guessing she was wearing a wig.    This spirit Yuuta is more informed than our Yuuta because our Yuuta pretty much explained the entire plot to him.     She uses the face mask     How does that thing even work.    watch that certain episode   The ending made sense for me. We knew that Mikatan's body was going to die as far back as episode 6, so we all predicted some sort of body swap ending, where  They all get their original bodies back, meaning Guriko dies   She and Teraoka switch, making a weird body swap romance between her and Yuuta, meaning Guriko dies   She switches with Yuuta, meaning one Yuuta dies  We also knew that having two Yuutas at the end wouldn't work out, but it was under the assumption that he would give his body back (or his original body) to the current spirit Yuuta.  It's also alright for it to be bittersweet. An ending like this is more memorable to me than a super happy ending where everything turns out alright. Teraoka has to go on living forever and making up for his sins, and Chiyoko can continue living as Mikatan due to the Facemaker/Voicemaker.  It's really depressing that Yuuta no longer exists in this universe, and I would have liked some sort of romantic follow-up between Mikatan and Yuuta, but I can accept that the games will expand on these matters.          Who was the cat?   Reincarnated Yuuta. Notice that Chiranosuke is a kitten in the episode, and 49 days have passed since Yuuta died, with his picture falling over when they go see Chiranosuke.  The last time Yuuta and Chiranosuke talk, the latter tells him that he hopes they can meet again someday. He eventually becomes a spirit and helps out the current spirit Yuutas.      Thanks for clearing it up for me   what pushed you to finish this chinese cartoon?  I'm feeling a strong 6 to a light 7.   I originally decided to watch the first episode due to the character style alone, as it reminded me a lot of Sushio. I wasn't really impressed by the PVs, and the first 5 minutes of the first episode were the most interesting to me. However, there was that rumor going around that episode 6 was going to be some game-changer, as Marina Inoue had said it was her favorite episode.  I also heard that Uchikoshi, the guy behind the Zero Escape series, was the writer for Punch Line, so I decided that it was only fair to give it a chance and see if it evolves beyond just mindless pantsu fanservice. It really started picking up at the end of episode 4, got better in 5, and episode 6 was worth the wait. Every episode since then was consistently good, and I really grew to like the characters and wanted to see how their story would play out.  Now this isn't really a series with that much symbolism. Instead, the fun is trying to unravel the plot episode by episode based on the clues you get, and then wait to see how the ending is handled, especially since this was written by a guy who is used to writing things so that multiple endings work.        I liked it from start to finish.  I'm glad I got on the ride from the first episode and never got off.  I like how the show presented everyone with the possibility that the world and everyone could end, and the series showed exactly just how. To me, it makes the ending feel like an accomplishment and achievement to Pine. Out of the billions of Yuutas, he was finally able to save the world. But could he save himself?  What made the ending even better was how the "peaceful" future went; it wasn't the future Pine expected. Watching the final episode, I intuitively knew that not everyone could be saved; but as Chiyoko Überfied for the last time, I caught myself hoping that everyone could survive and live together the way they all wanted to.  The show betrayed my hope, but that's what I think made it so much more powerful. Pine did not want this future to happen, but he's glad it did.           FUCK YEAH, HUMANITY!   Picked it up because MAPPA did SnB and Garo. I enjoyed the fun, light-hearted moments in between the mysteries and plot twists and the characters were unique and likable. I was actually surprised how much I actually cared for the whole cast by the end of it. Had fun the whole time and have no complaints.     reminded me a lot of Sushio  The designer was a Gainax/Trigger employee.    All these nice response tho        Chiyoko makes me want to commit a crime.    Prepare to get your ass kicked   Haven't started with the series yet. Does it stay well on its own or is it a blue balling advert for the game?   It held up well, personally. Doesn't go into detail on a few things but MCs problems are all resolved in the end, and the main cast is lovable as fuck.    What kind of crime?    What  said The characters are adorable and interesting but their development weren't enough. Needs more episodes.     Unspeakable things.    play the fucking game: the animation  i feel tricked      I'm an ally of justice! Seigi no mikata! I will not allow this.      Anon, when you want to say  hold hands  here, you just spoiler it and hope that mods are asleep.   First time is scary, because the guy might feel rough, or he could be very soft. You might get sweaty, but the feeling of skin against skin is second to none.  I hear police sirens, sorry, I gotta g        Would you date Rabura?   In the end, does this count as yuri or not.    Only to get close to Meika-chan.    Yes and break up after bed.   Gliese pls go       I would date that qt3.14 with the kid    That's adultery!    Yeah, our videos would be adult videos    we'll never get to know the pulp fiction crew   who was this guy supposed to be, again?   Hitler    A US colonel being possessed by Tsubouchi Qmay, the same spirit that possessed Ito's crazy teacher Tomoda. He wants the bear cub because he believes it's the only way he can become a W, which will let him survive VR-1's impact.  Tsubouchi Qmay was the original leader of Qmay, but he died from Überfying too much and continued to live on as a spirit.      That kid wants to aggressively /ss/ badly.   I don't think I understood what happened.  Why did he go back in time to start the loop? what about the cat, who is he?  Also, I am probably forgetting about this but do we know who was the one possessing the army general?     Oh right, thanks. So Rabura and Ito knew who he was because Yuta told them about Qmay, then?     Why did he go back in time to start the loop?  Because someone had to go back in time to make sure all this works out right. The Yuuta at the end is probably the only Yuuta who will go back in time to do this, since that area is out of the loop. He's just making sure it happens correctly.  what about the cat, who is he?   Reincarnated Yuuta  Also, I am probably forgetting about this but do we know who was the one possessing the army general?     They overheard Yuuta's entire story when he was telling it to Meika.             who was the one possessing the army general  Qmay      &gt;what about the cat, who is he?    Reincarnated Yuuta  Wait what   Because someone had to go back in time to make sure all this works out right  Why? things already worked out right, why start again?         read  Enough time has passed since Yuuta died for Chiranosuke to be born and grow a bit.     This series is a clusterfuck, in a good way.    This series is a clusterfuck, in a good way  Not really. Excel Saga was.    Would someone mind telling me what a W is? Becoming one lets you survive the asteroid, but is it just a position in the Qmay group or something more?  when will MAPPA get their first big hit?   Oh yeah, and  Why? things already worked out right, why start again?  Someone possessed Rabura in the past and made the schematics for Meika and all the future information about Justice Punch that Professor Tenga needed. If no one goes to the past to fax this information to him, you'll end up with a paradox in which none of what just occurred can happen. Yuuta goes back to the past and fulfills his duty by making sure the future can happen. After all, trying to rewrite history would also create a paradox since it would remove the need to go back in time to rewrite history, meaning no one would go back in time to change things. He just has to enable the future to happen. But since it's before the loop and timeline split, he doesn't have to loop back every time, only this one time.  The loop itself actually begins on Monday, December 21st, 2015, and ends on Thursday, December 31st, 2015.         Thanks for the explanation     The loop itself actually begins on Monday, December 21st, 2015, and ends on Thursday, December 31st, 2015   I think the game gets released near these dates.     It's also a buy the game ending, because the supremely happy ending didn't happen yet. Muhi's power could create an ending where all three of them live.     If you don't beat it by then you have to buy the game again   This is how ZE3 is going to be funded     I'd still plough Narugino all the same.   I want to fuck Narugino  Why did Yuuta have to be such a fag and cover up his sexy body?      Why is she her skin so dark?    Time paradoxes is something fiction rarely does right. The Pine who died had a very unique set of experiences on him that the ghost Pine hadn't, which means that the time paradox already exist, as one Pine is fundamentally different from the other. In fact, it also means that he can change the future without triggering the same loop conditions (which were vastly different on the two loops we saw). In the end, it all points out to a setting where a time paradox isn't really possible, but you have alternate realities instead.   I know I'm overthinking this, but I can't help it with time travel shenanigans.          Because dark skin in best skin    When they start making shows otaku want instead of shows they want to do. Same reason most BONES production are bombing.   Meika shouldn't be existing, because there's nobody to actually create her original design.   It was me, Dio.    This is the bootstrap paradox. Uchikoshi wrote a wall of text in English about it in response to a query about Punch Line. https://twitter.com/Uchikoshi_Eng/w<wbr>ith_replies</wbr>     That's the punchline    Yes, there is. Herself   So who was the bear? Was he actually just a lie by Teraoka to trick the Qmay leader or is there another story behind it?   Panties.    He became the cat, you know that right?    There is no romance because Yuuta has been a girl too long and has identified himself as a girl. And girls cannot love other girls.    No I wouldn't date a fucking slut, what is she a stripper now?    What kind of mindfuck would you call when you're now in the body who also happen to be the body of the person you loved the most in this world?     Not "That's u-turn, anon."  Wasted opportunity.    I want to plough Narugino and Ito. Hard.   haha its funny because that's how japs would say "your turn" in english...    Q: I understand that the story’s pacing is the same as the anime’s, but are there original developments in the game?    Uchikoshi: For things that weren’t represented or remained mysterious in the anime, see the game. Playing the game will answer questions that you may have. One particularly important thing is that the ending is different.    Q: It’s different?    Uchikoshi: Yes. The content of the game is different from the tv anime. The frequency of time loops is also different – the game has more.    Q: So, about the ending . . .    Uchikoshi: What to say? The TV anime ends at episode 12, but the game adds in about 10 episodes’ worth of content.    Well I don't know about you guys but I think this is it for me.  I'm not going to depend desperately on fan translations or the thin hope at localization anymore. I'm sick of getting games years after they hit or never being able to read companion LNs.  I'm going to learn Japanese.   Punchline is worth it.                     What if  the final yuuta dont enter to guriko's body, he be a free spirit. Girls adopt chiranosuke, yuuta posses the cat and live as a cat. He leave cat's body and return the past, in a cat form. Like a first chapter yuuta who lives a big part of his live in the chiyoko's body, and its why his spirit looks like chiyoko     My english sucks, i know     You probably shouldn't. The narrative is essentially going to have the game mechanics built around doing several time loops in order to achieve the true end with each successive loop acting as a newgame+.  It's going to get super tedious.      Muhi is a W, like Teraoka and Qmay said, but he wasn't the only W, which is what Qmay was led to believe.    and has identified himself as a girl.  Let's not do this for the thousandth time.       8/10, solid finale for a solid series. I wish they hadn't gone for the "You're gonna carry that weight." cliche, and they had gone ahead with the full switch.  Hell, Guriko was ready to atone with her life and they went with the "lolno, too easy, I'm gonna die just so you can reflect on what you did and suffer a life of feeling guilty" It's as retarded as the guy that cut his own dick to displease his wife. Fuck, the more I think of it, the more it pisses me off.        Then I'll find out for myself!     tfw Yuuta will continue to leap forever   making right what once was wrong...     That's exactly what happens, except that Yuta doesn't possess the cat but actually takes its form.   I ended up enjoying this shit more than I thought I would  maybe you can archive perfect happy ending on the games     Yuuta is already Chiranosuke. He was reincarnated as him after he died. Think of it like Kagome and Kikyou. They seem like two very different people, but Kagome is still her reincarnation and has some similarities to her.     I'm going to learn Japanese.    Punchline is worth it.  I enjoyed Punchline, but it really isn't. And ZE3, which could be worth it, will totally be an English-first game given the lack of support Japan has for the franchise      That's just how Japanese culture work. Like if you murder one person they'd kill you, however if you're a war criminal they allow you to enjoy the remainder of your life where you will atone for the sins you committed. Its just Japan being retarded again...     I don't know, possessing the cat actually sounds more plausible to me.     Yuta is the cat  is there any proof or is this just speculation?    Well, it worked for Ghost Trick.    Its strongly implied.    Chiranosuke is different in personality to Yuuta, like watching cat porn on his laptop and drinking sake. He's not being possessed, and he's kind of his own character, but he's still in this because he's Yuuta.  <br/>      Excel Saga was great, and I admit I haven't read the manga, but from what I can recall things were forced together just for comedic effect, it wasn't really clusterfucky as this. It was just stuff almost randomly smashed together. Also, people knowing from the past had no real consequences, just "oh, my long lost friend" or "oh, my long lost enemy".      You are your own grandfather thing on time travel   So... does Chiyoko/Mikatan pretend to be Yuuta now whenever his sister comes to visit them? That's kinda fucked up isn't it?   That fucker is really pissed off to yell at us in english...    You'd become different too after six billion Yuutas.    or maybe she knew all about the (im boy trapped in a girls body)  so all you need to archive perfect happy ending is  Beat up Possessed Teacher    Stop Robot from hacking shit  The game is not gonna be fun         I'm not sure how to interpret the ending. Chiyoko and Ito are both leaving for school. Ito is in normal clothing, when before she was in a private school for girls where she wore a uniform. Chiyoko is in a sailor fuku. I don't know if they're going to the same school now or what. We never even knew what Yuuta did for school.     Punchline isn't the only thing I want to play or read, though. But Punchline is worth pushing myself over the starting line, I mean.      Ito says she goes to a technical school in the end, which is where she got the cat from. I can't remember what a technical school is though.     No you must live and atone.   Oh, fuck off. Lamest shit since communism.     I think it's just him promising C to save G.    I don't get why people are getting so pissed over this. If Yuuta hadn't done this, he would have to live in Pine's immortal body and he wouldn't get to be Chiranosuke and help all the other Yuutas.    So wait a minute. Isn't the original loop broken as shit?  Spirit Yuuta needs to go back and possess Rabura. But in the first loop we experience Spirit Yuuta never actually does that, which would violate the whole loop principle.     Yuuta is pretty smart and has planned out things far ahead into the future. Also Guriko made a mistake, it doesn't fucking nullify their friendship. Pine wanted to protect them and he did that.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocat<wbr>ional_school#Japan</wbr>    A Technical School is where, instead of being a full College/University with secondary classes and general learning, you attend specifically to learn how to do a certain job. A Technical School for Aeronautic Engineers would be hands-on working with parts and fixing example planes.     The reizokan fax machine or whatever is capable of sending stuff to the past, so physical Yuuta could have done it in the first loop, but since he was dead in loop 2, spirit Yuuta had to do it manually.  Or more likely when Yuuta died his spirit went free again and went back to the past to do it. That'd also fit in with the Yuuta-in-Chiranosuke theory.  I guess we gotta play the game.           So then Ito's going to a new school.       bad guy dies because he failed his goal.   instead he must live and be wake up to guilt and pain.   I actually like this.       Yeah, that's to be expected. Why would she go to her old school again?   Its not a bad thing, but its overused as fuck.        Its not a bad thing, but its overused as fuck.   so is the alternative "I pay it gladly" ending, there's nothing new under the sun      I think "villain makes a heroic sacrifice at the last moment to instantly atone for all the bad things they've done" has been done way more. That's the end I was expecting, but I'm happy they went with partial body swap instead.    Dropped it 2 episodes ago     ...      Case in point, Ito was killing American military forces left and right. Is she the cutest war criminal ever?     they attacked 1st     Nah, you can see people escaping.  S-sometimes.      Guriko got off way too easy.   They're the badguys of the world. Fuck them...     Yuta never got to fuck Narugino in his "own" body knowing all the sweet spots     For the soldiers, I thought it was funny how they got a few guys that could speak English quite well but then left it obvious they were Japanese due to a few bouts of Engrish.  And then suddenly we got soldiers who sounded to be native English speakers. What's up with that anyway? Why do they settle for Engrish instead of just finding a native speaker? There's got to be a decent demand for them.      The british guy sounded alright. Not sure why he was with the US army but hey.    Why didn't the Grail try to eat Shirou? He's a mage and could be the core.   Why did the Grail appear just to suck up Gil and then leave?  Wasn't it blown up by Saber right before?      The lesser grail was blown up, not the greater grail.    A shit servant attracted to another shit servant. Who wouldn't of guessed?    Just wait for the Heaven's Feel movie.    Wasn't the lesser grail the one Saber blew up 10 years ago?   Hey there. Dumping a dead scanlation. Chapters are usually 8 pages long. The raws look terrible, so I'd be willing to scan this, if anyone wants to work on it.  Previous works include Genocyber. Tony Takezaki's Evangelion parody anthology was recently published by Dark Horse. Aside from that, he also has a comedic Gundam anthology that's a few volumes long.   The hero is Dr. Kishiwada, a brilliant but demented scientist, who creates bizarre mechas, battles the forces of evil, or just mucks about. There are many parodies of B-grade sci-fi movies and of TV. Crazy, slick, and very funny.                                                                                           Jesus Christ, how terrifying.

I accept your concession then.    How isn't Hidamari comfy though?    K-On is comfy and fun up until episode 20 of season 2. After that the vibe turns melancholic. It's definitely one of the best SoLs ever but if you're going for comfy all around there are better like Hidamari, Yuru Yuri or Lucky Star    Motion sickness isn't comfy.    It wasn't that way originally. Fucking KyoAnus.   Non non biyori Soremachi Hidamari sketch     The manga was too simple since it's just a 4koma, KyoAni made it better by adding more complexity and emotions.     he doesn't like SHAFT, the objectively second best anime studio behind KyoAni     sure isn't  but I can't imagine how something like that could give you motion sickness       just a 4koma   the complexity and emotions were added by KyoAni  Admit it. You haven't read it.      Oh you're the same troll from yesterday's thread. Fuck off.      Just read shit, fam.     My nigga.  Maybe he's just a goddamn pussy.        No Usagi Drop? Why?     You know exactly why, there's a pretty huge reason WHY    You think a SoLfag knows what that is?    Nyan passu    I love daughteru shows. I steered clear of the manga though.     It's popular as fuck.   Yuyushiki   The series starts out with the kid's grandfather dying and she turning out to be an illegitimate child. How the fuck is that comfy?    Literally this.     It was pretty shitty and I don't understand why there's weekly threads or any hope of S2  There are way better shows out there, what makes Yuyushiki so special?       This    The throne of cute girls doing cute things with lesbian undertones belongs to Yuru Yuri though    Yuru Yuri is more cute girls doing funny things.      what makes Yuyushiki so special?   It's a well-balanced blend of iyashikei and comedy with a charmingly natural feeling depiction of friendship and endearing characters.        Just ignore the manga.      https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=jEG<wbr>TNBr7YD4</wbr>  [ ] the comfiest  Yuyus is the hip underground alternative that's secretly  better         The yuyus    any anime comfier than Winnie the Pooh   Most of it was animated by a Japanese studio... close enough?     There are a lot of brilliant scenes; the summer night one, the snowing one(s), the Yuzuko tripping one, the nantsutte tsuchatta, the new years ones, to name a few.     It somehow makes everything better, it's hard to explain but you end up loving both of them in just that first episode.     To be honest I was only able to fully appreciate Yuyushiki after my second rewatch. Then it just gets better and better.    That's true and I loved the show, but that doesn't make it comfy. Just the fact that their lives are already full of hardships isn't very comfy to begin with.    I rewatched it pretty much right after viewing it the first time and it only got better.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192253  Very nice meme, are you a "meme master"?     up until ep 20  Season 2 makes me sad as fuck from the near start on every rewatch, the "ending" gets a lot of its power from the build-up.   all those Azusa watching the rest of the club interact scenes         Well it's as comfy as it gets with a 30 y o MC.    The Comfiest slice of  death     Azusa      Sora no Woto was Haibane Renmei done right.     may be  who wants to know?     I consider myself a veteran meme connoisseur.

Fuck I need more.    All great choices, but let me fix this thread.   There's nothing natural feeling about their friendship, it feels forced and like they are all awkwardly too close to each other.    But girls actually act that way, anon.    Why so homophobe?    I disagree completely. It feels natural than any cartoon has any right to be.    The best.    Maybe people who had friends in high school can relate more to them.  I fucking love that scene, the music and all.        I'm not a homophobe, I just felt uncomfortable watching it is all.       lesbians make me uncomfortable but I'm not a homophobe <br/>    Boku no Pico.    It's my favourite scene.    This. Fuck the rest     implying you choose to be uncomfortable around lesbians  You're literally hating someone because of something they have no control over, lesbians can't possibly understand what that's like.     There's the scene where Yui wakes up in the nurse's office after passing out from exhaustion and looks over to see that the other two beds in the room are empty. School has ended and she could probably guess that her friends and pretty much everyone else in school has gone home already. There's a moment there where she probably feels really isolated from people and out of place at school after hours but then she's greeted by her friends who actually stayed after school until she woke up. It's a bit subtle but the 3 have a really heartwarming friendship.  Come on man he isnt a /pol/tard because he doesnt feel comfortable watching gay things. It does bring up the question of why he was watching SoL anime with an all female cast though.         Come on man he isnt a /pol/tard because he doesnt feel comfortable watching gay things.  People who don't feel comfortable watching gay things are faggots.     woah anon that's enough namecalling     Kimi to Boku.    Maybe people who had friends in high school can relate more to them.  People who had friends in high school do not post on 4chan.     everyone has some sort of friend or they would've killed themselves before they were old enough to post here    Honeycomb had hints of melancholy throughout as well, just not as pronounced. To say nothing of  Sae &amp; Hiro's Graduation Arc .    They actually have fun and tease each other, making them seem more three dimensional than girls that just act super nice and cutesy the entire time.   That's why it's good.     So comfy, it makes me want to own a kotatsu.    EVA    The one anime with the blue haired annoying girl who drew yaoi manga.    That Azusa break down during episode 24     Azumanga Daioh    10/10 manga. Comfy af.    the only time i cried watching anime    K-On    Delete this.   Azumanga   I still have to watch and finish a few on these list but I agree.      Too gay.      Non Non Biyori. I think K-ON and Yuru Yuri are better SoLs overall but nothing I've seen has ever topped NNB for pure comfy.     It's actually not needed just manga is enough.    Azusas are for happiness, not for crying.    That just makes that scene all the more upsetting    A KyoAnifag would defend that that is better than this.    Hello autism my old friend    Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened.   god I love K ON Ive listened to that one comp album with all their songs so many times   B-but they even said in the song "graduation isn't the end"    You know what, motherfucker, enough. I've already had to disconnect my headphones in panic because I couldn't skip Tenshi ni Fureta Yo fast enough, and now you are reminding me of this again.  I don't need this fucking negativity in my life.      Well of course it isn't the end. There are two more volumes.    So you enjoy bad music, basically. From shitty moeshit shows.    Sketchbook.   Patlabor   Crap sequel. Kakifly can't write for shit. If they ever decide to make a S3 I'm sure they'll fix it though.     Kakifly can't write for shit.  If he can't write for shit, how come literally every good scene from the anime is basically a 1:1 adaption of events in the manga?    I really enjoyed Barakamon   The original manga wasn't anything special either but KyoAni created a SoL masterpiece from it    There are several things wrong with your post. 1) you refer to a manga you haven't read as "nothing special" 2) you refer to K-ON! as a "SoL" 3) you describe KyoAni's adaption as a "masterpiece" 4) you describe KyoAni's process as "creation"         literally every good scene from the anime  No such thing. K-On! is extremely bad.     There are several things wrong with you 1)you end yourself      Your post quality is extremely bad.  You should work on that.         As expected of a KyoAnifag.     Is this some kind of false flag to make people who like the manga look like obnoxious cunts, because I honestly can't see how one can unknowingly and genuinely be this much of one    Why do you defend being a secondary this hard? Just read the thing.    Why do you assume so persistently that just because somebody doesn't find a manga to be some biblical masterpiece of epic proportions, they haven't read it    How does one "assume" "persistently"?     there we go     Whenever anybody posts anything even slightly critical of the K-ON manga you are there every time without fail to claim they haven't read it, are you being paid to do this or do you just have a severe case of autism?    It's clearly a high school comedy series. It's like people don't know what a slice of life is.    Well you haven't read it, have you?    I'm an idiot. My bad.    watamote is pretty relaxed and comfy.    Why do you presume that    Because I'm right.    You're actually not but please do answer my question properly    Actually I am.     Still replying to low tier baiter      if he challenges the point of view of the hive mind he is a low tier baiter     I don't know lad. I've seen plenty of people who can't formulate any kind of argument before, it's hard to tell sometimes    Spoken like a true secondary.     no youtsubato  Kill yourself.     Too bad the amazing visuals were wasted on suck a shitty show.   Why doesn't anyone remember this?  Who was the best girl?     it was all garbage     Because anyone in this series are cockteases.  I wouldn't live with house full of girls if my boner is always hard as diamonds.        It came out a long time ago. It helped set the standard for all the bullshit harems we have today. The only difference is that most of today's harems don't have half of the character development that Love Hina did. They just add a bunch of girls, fanservice, and lolmisunderstandings to attract the desperate and uninspired.      Pretty much, best girl with the greatest character development was drop for an abuser.    Best girl was Motoko. Still my waifu     Motoko Mondays.  MO-TO-KO MONDAYS.       Who was the best girl?  You posted her.    It was terrible. Fuck them for normalizing the abuse the MC's trend     We are two my old anon.      liking disgusting tsundere    best girl is still  the turtle     normalizing the abuse the MC's trend  Honestly, yeah. Love Hina has some good points, but it started some annoying trends.    I seriously wonder why people still are reading UQ Holder. I've even asked in threads and it's like they're ashamed to reply.    Shinomu the cutest!  I remember reading this back in 2001~ and it was great. Sure, nowadays we are used to better things, but overall it is still a good read.  I hate this. I feel like the haremshit boom would have been much, much smaller if this trash hadn't somehow gotten so popular. Still to this day you'll get at least 1 carbon copy of it every season, only condensed into 12 episodes.     love hina was shit. harem garbage.  turbonerd gets all the girls.     I reread it every year.  Naru           According to Ken Akamatsu's Mangaupdates page:   Draws hentai (perverted/pornographic) doujinshi as a hobby; his doujin circle is known as CULITTLE   Anyone read these doujins?        Motoko was best girl.  Though I felt for Mutsumi, she deserved a happy ending.        It was Mutsumi Otohime, but she was unable to win due to plot, even if, in-universe she had the best qualities to win.  Yet she won my heart.       I read those FF7 and Cowboy Bebop doujins a while back.      uninspired   God help me, I swore not to engage in meaningless debate with the retards that make 4chan, but I will and demand to ask, in context, what do you mean by "uninspired"? Please elaborate, sigh.       Either Motoko or Naru take the title of best girl.   However, I feel that if we had seen more of Shinobu in her true form, she could have taken the spot.       Except it was Tenchi which has done it.   I enjoyed the newgrounds dating Sim more.  Galaxy Angel was the better series     Holy shit, I don't remember this scene. Naru is quite the god damn molester.   My dick.         It's not Naru      Imo it went on for too long. Like nisekoi     That is from the OVA, when Nanako impersonates Naru.     It's not naru, its keitaros sister.     *Kanako.      sigh.  Kill yourself.      sigh  Fuck off back to reddit, idiot.     MC's sister was definitely best girl, I can't remember half their names anymore though. That said, Love Hina was pretty mediocre and went on way too long.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127168061  Fuck off back to reddit, idiot.     why doesn't anyone remember this?   Are you kidding? Who doesn't remember the greatest harem series of all time?       harem  way to set the bar low anon     Most of them were only cockteases because Naru kept cockblocking them. Kitsune would have fucked Keitaro by week two if she had her way.    Why was Naru such a bitch?     Kitsune would have fucked Keitaro by week two if she had her way.  [citation needed]    Best girl is mai waifu of course.    Possibly. Though she could've been the secretly insecure cocktease type.  We'll never know since Akamatsu neglected her character        SUperior wanted to ride him within 10 minutes of meeting him.    We can all agree Naru was shit, right? She made me drop the manga    Hey now, it gave him superhuman reflexes and endurance to become a master martial artist in the end. I'd say that was a fair trade.    She wasn't as bad as all that. Just the closest to a real human personality of all the girls.  Urashima was an annoying, beta sperglord for much of the story. Naru isn't without her faults, but realistically most people would find Urashima pretty annoying.        punching guys through walls and blaming them for accidents    not hating her guts  Sasuga, anon       equating this piece of garbage anything close to human     2) Love Hina: I'm not even going to mention the unspeakable, disgusting, pedophilic, pornograhpic events which transpire during this show, but suffice it to say, groups of young men on Love Hina-fueled rampages are raping children at a level unheard of since the 60s.   it was a standard harem imo     Akamatsu harems are the only ones I honestly enjoy     blaming them for accidents   routinely ends up in her tits/etc  At some point a line starts to get drawn. Hell even Rito's harem is starting to wise up that there might well be other forces at play.  And a lot of the time she's pissed at him because he's being such a disgusting beta with zero motivational drive.   She's without a doubt the most realistic of the girls.            following a harem series for "real human personalities"  There would be no harem.      wanting mango girls to be shallow, one dimensional characters relegating to being cute cardboard cutouts for the sperg MC to molest occasionally     Motoko no contest   Motoko &gt;&gt; Shinobu &gt;&gt; The Others. Came just to say this, now bye thread, ot was a terrible story anyway. Main character is such a looser like those girls with tsundere problems (for except Motoko and Shinobu).    Main character is such a looser   looser   oo   And yeah, Urashima was pretty fucking terrible but got better toward the end. Which is something most modern MCs fucking lack. He at least started to grow a spine.        I have all the volumes  in spanish cause I'm a spic    But wasn't videogirl Ai like the biggest cocktease? I have vague memories of super-detailed pantyshots   Ctrl + F: NEGIMA    0 results   the hate is real         implying that worst girl is best girl        Magic World arc   yeah fuck Negima  it could have just been harem magic shenanigans with occasional serious but noooooooooooooo           But wasn't videogirl Ai like the biggest cocktease?   you never finished it did you? motherfucker went through hell just to get dat ass  that he knew was going to disappear anyway   Video Girl AI was alright         Fuck you, I loved the Magic World Arc. The powerlevels may have gone through the roof and the ending might have been shit, but it was still a fun ride with a decent plot, great action and likable cast.    best LH girl   not the autistic semon demon   or Matoko everyone else is garbage       it went on too long, the rosters was mostly ignored, it turned into magic dragon ball z, the ending was horseshit, the spinoffs/alternate universes were horrible and Asuna was literally worst girl.     hahahah, that bait is too strong eh anon? Your words are what run through my head before almost every post on this site.      Asuna was literally worst girl.   Asuna   not one of the best girls  Shit taste.       Haruka &gt;= Mutsumi &gt; Shinobu (because Kei cant into loli) &gt;= Motoko &gt; Kitsune &gt;= Kaolla &gt; powergap &gt; Naru &gt; Sara  search inside your heart, you know this to be true       Wasn't Haruka his older cousin or something like that? Isn't that  w incest?    Love Hina introduced me to manga and anime after the usual dragon ball z, yuyu hakusho, inuyasha etc.  I remember when I was 12 I was playing the dating sim on newgrounds and I got curious and searched for more about it. And there I discovered the manga, and from that point on my life completely changed.  I won't ever forget about it.       every Akamatsu manga had bad scans (even those that Akamatsu released himself), mediocre to bad scanlate, and terrible licensing   no one will ever do justice to his series   A days of youth, after manga was fully scanlated and I read every chapter while next downloaded from IRC while using dial-up with bad line...     I just re-read my old copies. First manga I ever bought.  First half holds up. Comes across as cliche, but it's solid, and there's enough plot to make me actually care.  Second half is crap. Like,there was literally no plot, but he kept going. Bunch of one-shot chapters and increasingly stupid "Naru and Keitaro almost admit their feeling but she winds up punching him" plotlines. And some weirdo incest subplot with some shoehorned character.       Manga Naru was best girl.     dating sim on newgrounds   shit, are you me?     jesus   All the best girls had names that began with M.    Naru.    card captor sakura doujin was the best. i think it was called AM:4 or some other number    Wow, both of those points are such bullshit, that I shouldn't really be responding to them. But I got nothing better to do. Blaming someone for being a "disgusting beta with zero motivation" is no reason to sock him in the face every five seconds. She's a disgusting human being with an unlikable personality who deserve the same amount of physical abuse she dishes out, if not more.  Also, she's as realistic as a stick figure on a piece of paper. Plenty of girls, both in the 2D and 3D world, aren't complete bitches for no true reason other than "I DON'T KNOW HOW TO REACT, BETTER PUNCH HIM"  She needs to be dead and stay dead        We all remember it, but are too ashamed to admit it. That said, Mutsumi was best girl.   The guilty gear one with Bridget and Millia is fucking excellent.    My first manga... Naru is obviously best girl. Mutsumi or Kitsune second. I literally had nothing to compare it to... it was incredible. Absolutely buttfucking incredible.       This  sadly. None of the girls were really amazing in any regard. At least watermelon giel never hit Keitaro     Not this. Why anyone likes physically and verbally abusive, violent women is a mystery to me. Literally the worst girl.        Kanako and Motoko were the best grills.   oi you can't just say being unlikable is realistic   it devalues reality     Tenchi was better.   Watch anime  Mutsumi was the best girl   Watch the OVA  Kanako was the best girl   Read the manga   Motoko was the best girl          Love Hina? Oh you mean that Flash Dating Sim!   This is what I remember most about Love Hina   unpopular opinion (and probably for good reason), but I disagree  liked the character development of LH better, and I watched Tenchi before LH      I was supposed to be taking care of college work, but it looks like I'm taking a detour through nostalgia lane.    I CAME     Almost July   college work   Summer classes? Are you a glutton for punishment?       Certainly not Naru. She is a fucking psychotic hypocritical cunt.    Mutsumi was best girl, but i'll concede she was about as smart as a brick.    Is this the one starting the rise of harem ?    i feel like tenchi muyo deserves that title but love hina is a close second.    No, that would be pic related.  Love Hina definitely boosted the popularity and demand though.       smart as a brick   ended up with a degree in Medicine from Toudai   just because she's dense like lead and derps alot in favor of Naru, doesn't mean she's dumb  I love you Mu-chan but you were stupid to give Kei to Naru... TWICE        Shinobu     SUperior   ?      Agreed. She was the one who deserved to be loved the most. Motoko was a close second.    when she grows up Kaola joins the Rebellion just for shits and giggles    Negima! excelled when it was balancing action/plot with slice of life chapters. The Magic World went full fucking retard with the latter and turned the manga into power level bullshit for the last five years.  Also, Chisame a fucking shit but they kept shoehorning her into the story to the bitter end.      Naru was the best girl that won too.   I loved Love Hina. Sure is a harem full of cliches but it was fun, Keitaro was goofy and likable but not retarded like many harem MCs, Naru was a generic tsundere at first but changed early on and was also likable, Shinobu and Mokoto had a enormous development as characters, Mutsumi was a good counter balance for Naru, Su and Mitsune weren't too relevant but they were fun.  I just don't like Kanako, fuck that bitch     Love Hina was good until it went full shounen and dragged the plot into the ground.     went full shounen  are you thinking of negima? love hina never really fundamentally changed and its problem was that it did the same fucking shit for 3 or 4 volumes past when everyone was way too tired of it  introducing a new girl that fucking late in the story and expecting us to believe she meant anything  epilogue girl was qt though.       i just remembered how awful the whole kanako part was.  Shinobu was the best girl and from where Love Hina ended she should have been the winner.      Everyone hates Kanako. Her best moment was counter-punching Naru as she was about to punch Keitaro. Felt damn good.  Also, I agree that she's a terrible girl but she's still better than Naru.        Now that I think about it, Kanako was my introduction to wincest. That explains a lot...   I loved Kanako.      I loved her you faglord.     She was just a plot device so they could extend the life of the manga     Yeah. Sinobu and Ku were never really in the contest imo because it's borderline pedo at the time.  Older Shinobu is stacked.       She was just a plot device so they could extend the life of the manga  She was the first real challenge towards naru/keitarou, other than their own internal bickering. More than a plot device.      you two are literal cancer. she's the fucking scrappy doo of love hina only worse.     The only cancer here is you.     real challenge   kanako   REAL CHALLENGE   KANAKO   CHALLENGE   KANA-FUCKING-KO  KEITARO BARELY REMEMBERED HER FUCKING NAME YOU IGNORANT RETARD SHE MEANT NOTHING TO ANYONE          She wanst even the first. Mutsumi was a real challenge to Naru/Keitaro, hell, even Shinbu and Mokoto were a more big of a "threat". Keitaro never considered Kanako as a love interest, he only see her as a sister       I loved kanako   loved   past tense   It's time to move on, anons     implying it wouldn't be borderline pedo today   Japan, or more specifically, Anime and Manga are really open minded about pedophilia these days...                 KEITARO BARELY REMEMBERED HER FUCKING NAME YOU IGNORANT RETARD SHE MEANT NOTHING TO ANYONE   Well the last time he saw her was when she was a babby. The Hinata residents all came to care for her, and Keitarou always has.     She was a challenge for them in that she really took things to the extreme and went truly all-out, none of the other girls really did that, even if they had better odds (Keitarou wasn't into that wincest, so it was an uphill battle for Kanako)  Or do I have to remind you of that entire Kanako arc where she basically whipped everyone and made them all into her bitches, etc. etc. Not to mention she (accidentedly) ensnared keitarou with the curse of the abandoned hinata inn, etc. etc.   The other girls could have been a challenge to the relationship of naru/kei as well, but most of them didn't even speak up about it until the very end of the series, this is including shinobu ofc.                &gt;implying it wouldn't be borderline pedo today  I meant that in my eyes.   It's time to move on, anons  Me too though. Except it's not Kanako, but Motoko. I don't partake in waifu bs, but if I had a waifu it would probably be her.         She took things to the extreme because she was created to represent a big challenge to Keitaro and Naru, a sort of final boss so Keitaro and Naru's relationship could mature, different from thet other girls that represented some threat for the couple   Naru best girl  Shinobu close second      She was a challenge for them in that she really took things to the extreme and went truly all-out  and yet none of the readers felt any tension because it all felt like bullshit time-wasting OH BUT THERE'S A CURSE IN THE MANSION THAT WE NEEEVER KNEW ABOUT BEFORE MAYBE THIS WILL TRUMP KEITARO BREAKING HIS CHILDHOOD PROMISE (or not, no one can remember anymore) AND ALL THE OTHER SHIT THEY WENT THROUGH SO THAT HE COULD END UP WITH NARU BY THE WAY DID YOU REMEMBER THAT NARU IS LIKE THE AUNT AND KEITARO IS LIKE DR BIG DICK HERE'S HIM DRIVING BAD SO YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE SAME AND MAYBE THE DESIRES OF THIS EVIL BITCH MATTER AND WE WILL CARE ABOUT HER FEELINGS  NO AKAMATSU YOU FUCKING HACK END YOURSELF SO WE CAN BE DONE                how is she a threat if she could not have won? it was obvious there was no possible game plan where she would be with keitaro.   I was crazy over this shit in high school back in like 2002 along with other Harem shit like Ai Yori Aoshi (which made me hard as diamonds since it had nipples in it). Had all the volumes, lent them to my art teacher who I got into animu. Nostalgic, but not that great in retrospect. I still have all the Negima, but Ken turned those into shit.  By the way, wasn't Shinobu based off Ken's niece? Kietaro was a self insert of him and Naru was his soon to be fiance whom he made a literal promise with to part ways until they both succeed in their dreams (him a mangaka, her a model) and then marry only on condition that they fulfill their dreams on their own. Does this mean that if Shinobu won, he'd be banging his niece in real life?   Also Nodoka best girl, fucking fight me        Thats what I said, she didn't represent any kind of threat  Misquoted  ?     Akamatsu remade Love Hina anime/manga like AMAGAMI where every girl wins in separate routes?  I would pay for it. Especially Yandere Naru after she gets NTR'D by Kanako      how is she a threat if she could not have won?  Keitarou at one point almost gave in, even started having fantasies about Kanako and everything.  I'd say she actually didn't do too bad a job despite having had the odds stacked against her.  This is why I loved Kanako so much. She was every bit as beta/shy/secluded as the other girls were, but did that stop her even once from trying to win Keitarou over? No it didn't. It was so refreshing to see a girl that actually took action and tried to win her love, rather than just pacing back and forth in denial, breaking things occasionally, or just being uguu~ senpai pls notice me (shinobu) the entire series.  Kanako had the cards stacked against her from the start but she always went all in, she was always true to her feelings, none of this hesitation, rom-com, blue-balling bullshit.  She was also one of the more fleshed out characters, You clearly see her develop from this cold, Keitarou hunting machine into someone warmer, softer, someone who, in the end of her arc, even sacrificed herself in order to let Keitarou be with the girl he truly wanted to be with. It was probably one of the most touching moments in the series for me when Keitarou, despite knowing who Kanako truly was behind the disguise, chased after her first instead of Naru. Ofc he did that mostly out of platonic love, but it cemented Kanako's place and arc as one of the best in the series for me.             this whole fucking post holy shit what is wrong with you      I have taste, you don't.    She's a generic oni-con.  Pic related is a superior brocon       &gt;She's a generic oni-con.  You can add 'generic' to just about every character in anime/manga.  But I'd argue that kanako was not generic. She took onii-con to new levels of insanity, even for today's st andards.       Ou, I watched this like 20 years ago, I think I was 4, don't remember much of it, what happen at the end? Who win?    http://lovehina.wikia.com/wiki/Kana<wbr>ko_Urashima#Character_Design  Love Hina was supposed to finish after Keitaro got into Tokyo University, but it was more successful than he realized and his editors wanted the series to continue. When he found that he didn't have any way to create tension/conflict with the characters he had by now, he introduced Kanako Urashima in a way to "bring closure" to the story, just like he did with the character Yayoi Kobe in A.I. Love You.  she was ham-handed into the story due to the demands of editors she added nothing she was hastily created to serve a purpose and this was blindingly obvious to everyone else she's a fucking scrappy doo yet you think she's a good character. fucking epilogue girl is better than her.      </wbr>    Love Hina would have been pretty shit if they ended it @ turtle island arc.  Even if Kanako wasn't in the original palns that doesn't stop her from her arc being good and it certainly doesn't draw away from her character. In fact it makes one appreciate her even more. Most of the girls in love hina just plain out sucked. Kanako was a breath of fresh air.      naru narusegawa aka nerd-bitch tsundere i want to say his childhood promise was to her first, not musume, but i honestly am not sure anymore because even keitaro decided that some shit he said when he was 7 doesn't fucking matter.      doesn't stop her arc from being good  it isn't good you may like it but it's widely hated by readers.       you may like it but it's widely hated by readers.  Prove it.  Also, since when have the majority had good taste? It's pretty rare when they do.      Everyone knows Love Hina, and know it's to blame for every generic Harem Anime ever.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Zfc<wbr>5twxGjZQ</wbr>  [ ] You are now hearing the opening manually.     Why anyone likes physically and verbally abusive, violent women is a mystery to me.  Pretty sure the ones who like Naru just don't care about the slapstick humor enough to bitch about it at every opportunity.     Except Kei can't into Loli, and she would have have to waited (at least) 3-5 years for him to even allow himself to look at her the same way Kitsune made him look at her.    I don't even remember Kanako at all, or Keitaro being worse than an average harem protag (in fact he was better, since he actually actively pursued the girl he loved).    i guess there aren't any good surveys or critical analysis available on the series whatever, she's still shit and only served to drag out a story that was already way too long. telling readers to try and believe keitaro truly loved a girl he literally never mentioned or thought of over the course of the series, and then saying that a magic annex was going to make him, was downright insulting to the readers.      telling readers to try and believe keitaro truly loved a girl he literally never mentioned  What are you even talking about?  You don't even explain why you think she's shit. You're just saying   hurr durrdon't like the things I don't like    as far as I'm concerned.          Even her name isn't very good. If it was she would be called Hina.  Just the reveal of her name would have been hype as fuck.         Reminder that Naru is everything wrong with the tsundere genre. She was the vanguard of the "new" tsundere we have now that is hyper bipolar aggressive (sometimes unaggravated) violence followed by immediate "dere" moment that just caters to moefags because it makes money.  Motoko is the real tsundere and how traditional tsunderes were written. She's cold in the beginning and warms up to the MC because she gets to know him as a person.        for there to be tension we have to believe there is a possibility for her to succeed for her to succeed keitaro has to give up his love for naru and fall in love with her when 10 fucking volumes have been about him and naru and keitaro has not mentioned or even thought of her once over those 10 fucking volumes nor has any member of his family there's no fucking chance the readers are going to buy that so they introduce the cursed annex maaagic will even the playing field and now keitaro will have to break the curse and be with naru or stay with kanako even though there had been fantasy elements in the story, it is still fucking retarded for a curse to be a central plot point for the final arc of a fucking rom-com.           Pretty much this. Both for Naru and Motoko. They even state how Motoko was getting "less rough around the edges" and becoming "softer and rounder", her outfits and demeanor slowly becoming more feminine. Which was why Motoko was so popular, or at least why I liked her.       Reminder that Naru is everything wrong with the tsundere genre.  She at least gets some decent character development, unlike modern tsunderes.      for there to be tension we have to believe there is a possibility for her to succeed  We all knew from the start that naru was going to win 100%. Therefore none of the girls added any tension to the series, by your definition.   even though there had been fantasy elements in the story, it is still fucking retarded for a curse to be a central plot point for the final arc of a fucking rom-com.  I wouldn't go so far as to call it a central plot point, it gets introduced relatively late into her arc.  The real point of Kanako's arc, along with all the other arcs of the girls, was to flesh out Kanako's character in the story and to help solidify Naru's relationship with Keitaro.   It's just what you do. You employ some form of conflict/tension in order to develop/further sone facet of the story, in this case that being naru and Keitaro's relationship.   I don't think that makes it a bad arc though. It really pushed their limits as a potential couple and it's only after this arc that they become truly serious about each other.             I have a copy of Love Hina Infinity  Official pool for most popular girl   1st Narusegawa 4225 2nd Motoko 3276 3rd Shinobu 2703 4th Kanako 1430 5th Mutsumi 814 6th Su 613 6th Haruka 613 8th Mitsune 590 9th Ema 362 10th Tsuruko 160 11th Sarah 107 11th Nyamo 107                  In the manga, respectfully. SOME. Not a lot. In the anime, she is outright stagnant.     kanako herself is shit because she's hung up on something said to her when she was very young. keitaro was older than her yet he still has literally no recollection of it.  she didn't even try to contact him within the last decade even though her entire psyche is apparently built around her love for him  she's sexually aggressive with all the other characters which is totally jarring for a character so invested in the concept of true love  she's also a bigger bitch over the course of a few chapters than naru was across the whole series combined.           knew it was naru from day 1  arguably no. there were points where i thought it honestly could have been musume with his relationship with naru going down a different direction.  pushes their relationship to the limit  it was fucking NOTHING compared to how much they stressed over musume, her illness, and the childhood promise. that was also a better conflict because it was actually something affecting the thoughts and emotions of the main character while all of kanako's arc had a null effect on everyone but herself..        kanako herself is shit because she's hung up on something said to her when she was very young  It was because of their overall relationship/time together that Kanako went the route she did, not just a single phrase.   keitaro was older than her yet he still has literally no recollection of it.  You know what else he forgot? His fucking 'promise' girl, well that ended up being a far bigger plot point than Kanako ever was, so why not attack that first if you're hung up over it?   she's sexually aggressive with all the other characters which is totally jarring for a character so invested in the concept of true love  I'm not even sure what you're trying to say here. She does sexually molest some of the girls, but only as a form of psychological attack, not because she lusts after their bodies or w/e. This has no bearing on her love for keitaro other than that it illustrates how far she's willing to go to stomp out the competition.    she's also a bigger bitch over the course of a few chapters than naru was across the whole series combined.  Being a bitch doesn't make you a bad character. If you want something where everyone holds hands and gets along all the time no matter what, go watch sesame street.               arguably no. there were points where i thought it honestly could have been musume with his relationship with naru going down a different direction.   With how developed Keitaro/Naru were at that point, it was hardly likely that the main girl would shift to Musume.   it was fucking NOTHING compared to how much they stressed over musume, her illness, and the childhood promise.   I'd disagree. It forced Naru to once and for all confront her true feelings for Keitaro, and that's quite the feat considering how stubborn and tsundere Naru is.          This   Regardless of the reason, I am glad Kanako was introduced. Because of that we got to see good stuff like Molmol and Todai.  Overall I think it wouldn't have been as good without those chapters.      I'd disagree. It forced Naru to once and for all confront her true feelings for Keitaro, and that's quite the feat considering how stubborn and tsundere Naru is.  Other way around. Naru was supposed to have won and stopped that bipolar tsundere nonsense during the island trip (she was going to give him the P), but they reverted her back to a retarded bipolar tsundere just so they can extend the manga for $$$$.     Love Hina-hen?  Really,what I want most is for him to go back and color the damn manga already.Shonen jump does it with naurto,one piece and bleack.  How hard would it be to just go back and color it all in?  I want full color love hina,ai love you,and negima so fucking much.         10,000 continuation songs and alternate versions on 1,000 soundtracks....  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=F3t<wbr>vJPa3wIE</wbr>  [ ]    Motoko &gt; Mutsumi &gt; Kitsune = adult Shinobu = adult Su &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; rest Shinobu was cute, not waifu material, aunt was off-limits and Su was a kid, so the "rest" is mostly Naru, the sister I don't care about and Ema from the epilogue.  Was this manga a milestone in terms of shifting popularity into harems? It sure looks like a lot of archetypes came from there, but I know shit about anime history.      Definitely not in Japan, but very likely so in US.  Tenchi Muyo was out before if I recall.....     Love Hina was one the first animu I ever watched outside of shit like Sailor Moon and DBZ.  I had dial-up back then so I used to dedicate every sunday afternoon to downloading one episode off of KaZaA, since they were only like, 30 megabytes a pop.     people don't like Naru   Explain yourselves, homosexuals.     Unnecessarily violent bipolar shitty type of tsundere.  Everyone knows good tsunderes are the OG type that are naturally cold but warm up.  Like Nanasaki Ai.       The only thing I know about this manga is due to fact I played that game boy advance game.   Shinobu best girl       This. Exactly this. Also excellent taste.     I like my Tsunderes to be angry when the situation deserves it, and not comlete rageaholics 95% of the time   even less when the 5% that they're supposedly Dere, they're being more indecisive and wishy-washy than the piece of shit harem protagonist       sigh  Sigh    Love Hina will always hold a place for a lot of people, even if it was just to introduce you to a part of something bigger. Kitsune was always my favorite.       liking Kitsune    liking an alcoholic slut who fucks for money       Oh come on now, she was always the most fun and the most genuine    How about you explain yourself for liking this stupid, violent whore?     I liked Naru because she was the promise girl and won the Love Hina in the end.     This makes her more a plot device love interest than an actual character and your love for her is very shallow.     Am I the only one who really doesn't like Akamatsu's art style? It just feels so soulless. I think it started halfway through Love Hina, then just got worse and worse in Negima, in which he basically started mass production of "cute anime girl" characters that were of very little importance to the story. Even among the main class I only liked two or three of the girls.   Wait until you see his porn doujins, now THAT is soulless and unattractive.  I generally agree with you, though he manages to produce pretty girls from time to time.       Who still gives a fuck about this?     I do, because I find it funny.    I do, so?      it was annoying when i was a kid and funny as an adult      Does he just carry around little paper sacks in case he needs to rip someone's heart out?    I always assumed the clothe was part of the guy's shirt, it's the same color      I'm more bothered by the fact that we still don't have a proper, uncensored release of the Dragon Ball manga in English.         100 times better than black bar/fog censoring that is becoming popular.       I don't understand what is being censored     stop or i'll activate the spring to bonk him on the head    Where's the Zabuza on the floating handle. Come on guys.      at least it made sense. a chef shouldn't fucking smoke. Thats probably the least horrible censor that 4kids did.    Show me one canon scene in which Sanji has smoked while cooking.     Show me at least 20 scenes where he hasn't.     i mean in the sense that it ruins your taste buds.    Terraformars was shit, and that scene made me drop the manga completely because I realized what kind of series it was: lets job every fucking character to the nhojs to hype them up then run out of ideas.   that racist    The entirety of Tokyo Ghoul TV or Netflix.   kek    This can't be real...     It's funny because neither version is realistic.      I don't really mind her censorship. It only looks ridiculous in frames like this, and she's already an adorable busty fetish magnet even without the cleavage. I bet boys are discovering their weewees even with the edit.    Yeah, FT's manga is better, but I prefer other reasons...     It looked more violent when it was in the sac imo    Every Time There is always one who sees it and doesn't believe it.     why   I never understood why this happened, but Mammy is still on Tom and Jerry reruns.  People would be questioning a jelly donut that size, so they had to change it.     Aprons are racist because slavery.    This can be real    Is that QCDJ remix out yet?    I can believe it.     Believe it     Wasn't this during the 4kids run?   4kids ruined a lot of anime back when they were still around, it was almost impressive. What the fuck were they thinking?      BELIEVE IT    Considering she was actually redesigned in B2/W2, I wouldn't be surprised if the character designer didn't realize it was a racist caricature until the games released, and then voluntarily changed it.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K5U<wbr>fIRmkv28</wbr>  [ ]     I dont even understand why.    The heart is actually surrounded by a membrane which partitions it off from the rest of the human body. Most organs have it. I like to think Togashi knows a bit of anatomy and the bag is that membrane.    Him having the sac made no sense, the heart still beating in it and him putting it in the mans hands was fucking great    I remember the scene where he threatens some guy by pointing the sword at him, and in the German version he's just pointing the handle at him.  But how the hell did they deal with the sword being thrown into the tree in the first place?      Money.    Looks less like a cross i think. That's the best i can come up with.       Same reason they censored luffy's mouth     I get it, they went with the idea   we can censor it if we say its a see through water blade.          The idea's fine Though they completely screwed up the times         OH MY GOD I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT THEY FUCKING CENSORED LUFFY'S MOUTH BEING OPEN     When you start getting edits like this, it's proof that the censors have run out of actual things to censor and are just trying to fill up their 8-hour work day at this point.     I'm sorry, what?        The idea's fine  Explain it to me       Yes, now what did it look like then he threw the sword and it lodged itself in the tree?    why did they change it?      What the everlasting fuck?  WHY?      They changed Japan's 24-hour clock to the US 12-hour one. That honestly isn't so bad if you consider that American kids may not understand how Japanese clocks work.  But they screwed it up in that 19:00 should be around 8 pm.     Why? For what purpose?       French chefs smoke all the time. Sanji's supposed to be "french"      8   I meant 7, fuck     Oh god Yu-gi-oh replacing all the guns with pointing fingers was hilarious.     There are people here who don't realize that the sack came from the guy's shirt when Killua tore his arm through his chest        Japanese clocks  I live in Mexico and I always used a 24h format     My sides    That's just cruel. What if he needs to poop?  Also, speaking of cruel...       I wish someone would create a series of videos showing both the original version with subtitles but no sound and the censored localized version with audio at the same time for things like Yugi-Oh. It'd be great to compare episodes with everything side by side like that.     It's because 4kids also brings their shows to other countries. Rather than translate for every language, they just remove the text to make things easier.    Well, I just used 'japanese' because that's what the original's from. A lot of other countries use it too. But the US doesn't, so the change is necessary.        Huh, making the cigerrette look like a lollipop, thats kind of clever. Stupid and not necessary, but clever.    WHY    I thought everyone in Yu-Gi-Oh just had a spirit gun when they pointed their fingers    I... I don't get it. Why?     it's called military time or 24 hour clock   so the change is necessary   no it's not         what what why?    What was the point of that ?    why?    My god, that blue color is an eyesore.    Jews    Maybe not necessary, but it's helpful for young children. Which is the main audience.  And yes, I know what it's called.     I think most of the confusion comes from the size of the piece of cloth, given that it's big enough to hold his heart completely. Sure, some of the surrounding cloth was clearly pushed into the cavity, but it still seems a little small.   Left is original   It's not necessary, in school when they teach you how to read a clock they teach you both ways    Weren't they even called contests in that generation's games?     The fuck     I refuse to believe this is real.      They didn't teach it at my school. Then again I grew up in some country town in the middle of nowhere.     ellipses are ominous, I don't blame them    That's it...they got ran out of stuff to censor and got bored. It's the only explanation...    The former happened in the initial Japanese broadcast. The latter was changed by Japan for international and Japanese DVD releases.    Do pokeballs trigger people now? I don't get it.    The only thing I can think of with shit like this is that they weren't just censoring or localizing, they were making it full-on completely generic. Completely stripping the show of as much identity as possible so no one could possibly be offended by anything. No language, no logos, nothing.    I don't see any difference      Whats this from, some mudslime country?    Pokeball -&gt; clam -&gt; vagina -&gt; some devillish stuff. That's the way censors brains work    no wonder why i hesitated to pick up this series when it first aired    For what fucking purpose?    If I remember right, he jumps onto Pegasus' platform and demands that he give him the prize money right there.  Even as a kid, I remember thinking that scene was weird as shit. He didn't have anything to threaten him with.      My guess is that it have something to do with advertising laws. Yu-Gi-Oh can't have the back of the cards like real life because for some reason you can't advert real products in your japanese cartoons without paying royalties.     Honestly, I think the jelly donut thing was a genuine mistake. They really didn't have much to work with back then, so it was all translated up front. So they see what ends up being a rice ball, but it's filled with what looks like raspberry jelly or something, with what might be coconut shavings on the outside.   4kids comes up a lot in these threads but their edition of Zorc was on another level.  There are parts where the edit is so shitty his torso is just an indistinct dark haze with a dragon poking out     same here I was always thinking wtf was he going to do with that finger.    What, are there like licensing issues with pokeballs?  Were they worried that featuring their stylised likeness in anyway apart from actual pokeballs would contravene some condition about advertising in the show?  That I could kinda see, the networks not wanting to have the stigma of it being a full-on merchandise advertisement, so they have to cut out/edit stuff that could be construed as merchandise - change the logo and 'branded pen' becomes 'generic pen' and everything's fine.       to be honest that just looked like a huge dragon dick.    So far this is the only "done right", that is just a dragon strap on      That's pretty obviously why they did it.  It doesn't change how retarded it looks.      no he's from Boston   what about this?     This is about direct censorship, not people trying to cover their asses legally.    I'm amazed Konami even did that for Elemental Recharge.    Did they... remove her breasts?      I'll give you a hint: what's black and white and actually large enough to split between the four of them?    She wasn't supposed to look pretty in that.   In any case anime fucked up      My dick?      Wasn't this because his smaller self drank beer, but they made it orange along with him so it'd be like his thing?    Hher name in my country means "Blowjob"    No, but it is jelly-filled.    Arc-V is going to looks like shit if this happens.     And then run out of ideas   The anime was shit. However, if you're not at least keeping up with it, you're missing out.      For fucks sake Did display;none drop it or what?     Nah, Next volume release from them soon. Should catch up to just around that image before we have to wait on 14 to release in Japan.     Roaches in nice suits  Player Haters. Middle roach is Silky Johnson, Buck Nasty in the back.       DON'T CHEW WITH YOUR MOUTH OPEN KIDS      Are laser guns somehow less offensive than actual guns? Unless they're all playing a rousing game of laser tag it would kill all the same.     No bullets, no blood.     I'm thinking that's the only logical reason, but they got the rights to dub the show and there are TONS of Pokeballs in it.     To be fair, a single saltine is a lot more pathetic to be down to than a whole onigiri ball.      and that name is?    in america every family has loaded handguns in every draw. if you show characters shooting each other kids will imitate with the handgun their mother got them for christmas     The fuck am I looking at?    95% of chefs smoke like chimneys. The other 5% do coke off the prep tables where they make your food.     real footage of Robert Johnson and Son House        Tearju molestation sequence in TLR Darkness     What is this even supposed to be?    It's not.   https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=kDy<wbr>B91YRRCQ</wbr>  [ ] 15:10       Honestly it was just a localization. In the US we count times 1-12, am or pm. We don't usually do 13:00 or higher to denote time.      WOW IT'S FUCKING NOTHING   LASER  CHAINSAW      Five Nights at Freddy's     HOW CAN I HELP YOU KING DEDEDE? I NEED A LASER CHAINSAW TO ????? THAT THERE KIRBY.     Americans are retarded  More news at 11     We had one gun in my house and my dad was pretty serious about it. I never actually saw him use it even once, he kept the gun and ammo in separate locations, and I didn't even know where the shit was. So no, all american parents aren't retarded white trash who take pictures of their babies holding guns and put them on facebook.    Man, it was awkward as fuck when suddenly all the laser guns turned into real guns and there was blood everywhere.  Those last ~5 episodes of the run were a trip and a half.      Picking this back up now    Who knows. There were a ton of action cartoons in the 90s where everyone had lasers and blasters. It blew my mind when I learned that ki effects in the Ocean dub of DBZ had laser sound effects.    your house still had a gun in it and i bet if you cared enough you could have found and loaded it how many pakistani houses have police grade batons in them do you think     I guess it was  too edgy for them     go home carlos you're drunk    Wow... they really had to get creative.    Yeah. They were doing that in the 90s, early 2000s.  Now consider that they're still incapable of doing typesetting in 2015.      Urmum        ... for nothing why     What's that blue bar?    I remember when the show debuted on toonami and in the ED which was random screenshots next to the credits, there was a shot of her with her uncensored tits. And then in the next episode her rack got cut off. Made me realized censors existed.    Covering the tip of tue penis    Toonami   not exactly a censor, but...  When Pikachu is repeatedly shocking Ash to try to bring him back to life, Misty says "Pikachu…" in the Japanese version, and "Please, no…" in the English version. A commentary revealed that the dubbers had many alternatives for this piece of dialogue, one of them being "My bike…"     The only time Gundam Seed was entertaining.      a spring loaded hammer with force behind it to fire a bullet isn't more dangerous than a Pirate era gun  the Hammer will probably crack open their head       "My bike..."  Holy shit if they used that instead I would have still cried during that scene  from laughing of course  yes I cried a bit during that scene I'll admit it        art    has art gone too far?    Why?    Some dubs like to change the name of the characters    That's because Togashi can't draw for shit.    the single saltine cracker is so much better for the comedy      They improved her.     Five Nights at freddy's   Initial release date: August 8, 2014   Death-Toy's appear in the Arc-V Anime   May 11, 2014        Everyone did. No need to be ashamed.    He just made a comparison to the recent teasers, jeez     Latest Five Nights at Freddys teaser   June 25, 2015   Death-Toy's appear in the Arc-V Anime   May 11, 2014        I didn't. Not even trying to sound edgy, I was just really fucking confused. Why did Ash think it was a good idea to run inbetween the beams?   Why did he turn to stone?      Again, just a comparison. Nobody said they were connected.   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  This isn't real right?   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  where do i find the uncensored version   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  dick, but no nipple     I still think it's a good idea   He make his lollipops every day.       Hey fuck you, buddy. That theme song was amazing.    What are you a puff?    Fucking dying    Fucking this, man Delicious flatchest &gt; Disgusting cowtits      Why has no one answered  Why was luffys mouth editededed       That doesn't make any sense considering they'd have to pay an homeless guy from the street to photoshop all the shit away.    putting the heart on that nigga´s hand is fucking brutal     4kids turns cigarettes into lollipops and other faggotry    "100 times better than 'please buy the BD's' broadcast censorship"  Dumbest thing I've read all week.      Naruto actually got cut so it'll run on german TV - but they didn't just cut out like alot, the dub is horrible. For example no character will use the word "kill" - they use "I want/need to beat him" instead. Bad words like "dumbass" or "son of a bitch" got replaced with "bad person" or something like that.  It's for the kids man.        That's not even the worse thing that happened. In an episode, she turned into the girl in the pink dress and had giant tits, this was NOT censored in the dub, so I have no idea what the hell was going on.       http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2<wbr>6r3p4_yugioh-every-pegasus-desu_tec<wbr>h Japanese Pegasus is the gayest thing ever </wbr></wbr>       It's a mystery to everyone.     You know, this change would have at least made sense if they played up Devil Fruit user's weakness to water.  Which would have been the least problematic plot hole they'd dig.       This is why you should just wait for the Blu-Ray release   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  I think for elevens seeing a little boy dick isn't a big deal, it's like seeing a naked baby.    Oh God, I remember when the episode aired, and everyone was just lost.   We're taking away this little girls tits   But it's totally fine if she transforms into the other little girl, and has gigantic tits.        At least the BDs actually are uncensored. 4kids only released cut versions.    That did seem off to me at the time. I never knew. Same thing when Gin cut Hiyori in half.     Are there even rips of the 4kids censored versions?     Post the Erza torture scene comparison.     <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  Baleeted lol   <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127192293  Help!

I like those thread: they always show clearly that localizations, especially murrican and german ones, are from the mind of the devil. People who make these will go to hell. People who say that localized versions are better will go to the extra-agonizing hell.       hello where are the burgers :DDD     So im actually better than some mangaka, impressive    id rather link it  https://www.sankakucomplex.com/2015<wbr>/06/22/fairy-tail-manga-vs-anime-di<wbr>sgracefully-undisgraceful/</wbr></wbr>       Jetix  Oh man that was my shit back in the day     It's because they're paid per edit, so if it's remotely possible to provide any justification whatsoever, no matter how ass backwards it may be, then they do it.   not really censorship just fucking comedy gold.  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8x<wbr>oTBZrzko</wbr>  [ ]   Sausookay he's really cool.        Wait a min, the 1999 ver I watched clearly had him holding the ripped out heart Did they censor it outside of japan or something?     The anime gives me a boner The manga doesn't So the anime is clearly superior      Why is a West African singing the German OP?    Even the original anime was toned down compared to the manga.    and why is more than half it in english? Nobody knows the german will always be a hilarious mystery.      HunterxHunter got remade.     You will never finish your backlog    tfw used to watch every anime each season now i only watch around 4 and probably drop 2 half way   What is the point of this statement. You can't finish your backlog because you keep adding to it. Why does that make you sad?  Are you sad that you will never run out of dreams and hopes?      even Teekyuu and Danna gets backlogged   bokurano, teekyu, strawberry lolis, Eyeshield 21, Last season of Slayers, Cutey Honey F, Star Driver, Locodols, Gatchaman Crowds, Denkigai, IkaMusu S2, Chobits, Pripara, precure movies, Baccano Pick one    That's objectively false. I watch 20-30 episodes per week, half of those are airing, half - backlog. At this rate I will run out of worthwile anime in a few years.    Gatchaman. New Season in a week.    Why would you want to finish your backlog in the first place? It feels pretty great to know that you have anime you can watch whenever you want and that you'll never run out of it. Why do people complain about this? It makes no sense.  You're supposed to watch anime because you enjoy watching anime. Not watching it so you can finish it and be able to say you watched it. The journey, not the destination.         only because I can't download/find them.    I FINISHED YESTERDAY.  UNLESS THEY COME UP WITH A SECOND SEASON OF KKK, KILL ME BABY OR PANTY AND STOCKING, I'M NOT INTERESTED.      I actually enjoy watching anime. I get worried when my backlog starts shrinking, then i quickly go and torrent some anime from my download list.     jesus christ, go breathe outside, fucking get a social life.

So let's get this straight: Yui and Yukino both know the other one is in love with 8man. 8man told them not to be superficial and both want to give him something genuine. What does this mean?

He wants something real, if they fake their feelings just so no one gets hurt they would be going against what they're trying to find.       you will never be Laura's wife    Not with that attitude you won't.
