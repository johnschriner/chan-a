[ One Piece 792 discussion.<br>So, next chapter we finally have some international reactions again?</br>  I was expecting doffi to either escape safely or be mercilessly murdered by kaido's henchmen right there or something. I wonder if he'll ever reach impel down<br><br><br>I hope to see a little shot of Akainu breaking his teeth from anger</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>No probably not, I wouldn't expect him to do it either but if he wouldn't then why would Sabo? That'd be even more out of character.</br></br></br>   Man, this is getting really tough, I hope they're not going to take too long to join us over there   <br>I hate off-model fanart so much</br>  <br>it's unlikely Sabo was going to kill Burgess in the first place, and he most likely didn't. He probably just fucked Burgess' shit up by breaking his face.</br>  So Riku returns to his throne just as Gan Fall did, who were the fucks that said someone else would take it?  Fujitora for next Straw Hat  <br>It's all this "Sabo is crazy" bullshit that keep coming up. If you say it enough, some of the faggots in here will start believing it. And then get disappointed when it doesn't happen.<br><br>Burgess isn't dead. Sabo didn't kill him. He's heard screaming off in the background the page after. He might have some burns or scars but he isn't dead.</br></br></br>  <br> Sabo <br> not crazy </br></br>  where were his eyes. how many more chapters  <br> Works under Akainu aka "Hitler Two" in service of the World Government, which is led by pretty much literally Nazis; slavers, murderers, people who think they are masterrace. <br>Yeah. Pretty much confirmed.</br></br>    <br>he may be emotionally scarred for one reason or another, but I highly doubt he's crazy.</br>  <br>Is there a continuation to this image?</br>  <br><br>Post more Robin.</br></br>      You really have to be autistic and not feel with Sabo in that scene, and call him "crazy" for "overreacting" or something  <br>Screw that! It's Sabo time</br>    <br>there's a full comic somewhere but I can't find link at present</br>  <br>That's fine. And thank you. The panels have been posted.</br>  <br>i know, I posted them. There's one.. maybe two panels before the first one though. It's just a segue into the conversation though</br>  <br>usopp has the best faces</br>  How mad is Sakazuki right now, /a/?  <br>Barking mad.</br>  <br>Let just say they need to rebuild the Navy HQ</br>  <br>Ah, thank you for posting them, then!</br>  <br> no pirates died <br> people praising luffy <br> revolutionary second in command and most of the higher ranks were in fujitora's grasp and he let them get away because of some hissy fit over the shichibukai <br><br><br>probably a 9.7/10<br><br>The only time he was was madder was when Shanks showed up and made him look like a pussy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Where can I read the chapter that doesnt have fucking awful servers?<br><br>Mangapanda literally takes 3 minutes to load each page when they're under heavy load.</br></br>    <br><br>Mangapanda is awful in general. Shit quality, still plastering their fucking watermarks everywhere and amateur translations. Who's doing this?</br></br>  <br>His Anger emotion is shooting out lava he is so mad</br>   Kouichi Yamadera <br><br>Is Toei planning to get every Eva cast member on the show before it ends? I think they only need Shinji and Asuka now</br></br>  <br><br>Who are the four characters on Luffy's right side?</br></br>  <br><br>Who could Megumi voice? any dyke-like characters?</br></br>  <br>I just realized if we had to choose a side to sail with luffy the left side beats out the right side every day of the week in terms of everything.</br>  Fujitora is so based.<br><br>Its nice to know that the marines are still an morally ambiguous organisation, rather than just being evil now that Akainu's in charge.</br></br>  <br>I thought she would've made a good Dellinger but they went with Nitori.</br>  Finally fucking mangastream is out  Oda has a talent for doing chapters where nothing happened.<br><br>Honestly, this arc had great parts in it. Really great. But there were so many fucking chapters where literally nothing happened, not to mention Oda's insane number of  hiatuses  that reading the entirety of Dressrosa weekly made it a real chore.</br></br>  <br>I miss Sanji.<br>He's had a hard life.</br></br>  <br>It's like this with every major arc. At least this one was bearable. I quit reading weekly halfway through FMI because it was such a fucking bore and didn't start up again until halfway into Punk Hazard.</br>   Trying to pass over the position to someone who can protect the people. <br> People say they don't care and would rather go under and die before using violence. <br> This country is full of goddamn retards. </br></br>  <br>That feel when Sanji has had about two panels worth of worthwhile pages devoted to him since before the time skip.</br>  <br>That feel when Brooke has had less than Sanji since they found him in Thriller Bark</br>  What the fuck has Dragon been doing all this time? what is he preparing for?  <br>Someone needs to do the supernova edit of this.</br>  <br>Tea party. With all his best buds. They've took five on the whole 'oppressive and evil World Government' thing and have decided to take it seriously easy.</br>  It's been a while since I'm hyped for world building chapters in One Piece.<br><br>Based Issho made it impossible for World Government to cover this shit up unlike Arabasta. Smoker should've done this very same thing back then.</br></br>  <br> Nami <br> Rebecca <br> Koala <br><br>Why are all the girls Robin's bitches?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope he think it was worth taking a magma fist through the chest for</br>  <br>He's only doing it so he can get his way and get the Shichibukai disbanded. This whole arc was probably his keikaku.</br>  <br>I just want a few lore chapters</br>  <br>Well, its not meant to be read weekly, you know.</br>  <br>Cause she can give them fingering no problem</br>  Mangapanda translation was almost incomprehensible.<br><br>So the world government were behind the overthrow of dressrosa?</br></br>  <br> Well, its not meant to be read weekly, you know. </br>  <br>that feel when brook hasn't done anything notable or funny recently for me to even like him</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Its a manga, Jump releases weekly chapter for people like a teaser.</br>  <br>name all chapters were "nothing happened" please</br>  <br>No they're covering it up to show the corruption behind the Shickibukai and to take credit for taking down one of the most notorious pirates out there. Same shit that happened to Crocodile. Dressrosa is literally Alabasta 2.0</br>  <br>you stupid? He said that the world government is aloud doflamingo to do what he wanted with desrosa and to be the biggest broker in the world without actually stopping him. For this he apolagised because the wg is sopposed to stop shit like this.</br>  <br>Exactly. Brook was forgotten as soon as he joined just making a skeleton pun every once and a while.</br>  Remember ponyglyphs? You know, the things that made Robin somewhat valuable and relevant in the series. When are we going to see another one?   this day started on chapter 653 <br> if oda wrote a chapter a week, it would have taken him 140 chapters to tell the story of a single day <br> he doesn't <br> Chapter 653 cas released in january 23th of 2012 <br> this day has been going on for 3 1/2 years. <br>T H E L O N G E S T D A Y<br>H<br>E<br><br>L<br>O<br>N<br>G<br>E<br>S<br>T<br><br>D<br>A<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>After Oda stops circlejerking Luffy for the umpteenth time.</br></br>  <br>We saw one like 10 chapters ago...</br>  <br>What even is your defintion of something happening?

One Piece has always handled major arcs this way.<br><br> nothing happened  <br>You want a plot twist every chapter?</br></br></br></br>  Be honest /a/, would you fuck a fujitora?    <br>soo.... Dragon is not dumb like Luffy?</br>  Any chinks itt? Does Jesus say ``brother'' or ``brothers''?  <br>Mangastream is one of the best scanlations.</br>  <br>They aren't claiming to have taken him out and they aren't covering anything up; they're doing the opposite.</br>  <br>he doesn't seem to be. He is a monkey D. though so he probably has some quirks</br>  <br>Can't wait for the PC release of Pirate Warriors and the glorious nude mods</br>  <br><br>Niggastream is even worse.</br></br>  <br> niggerstream <br> good <br>Embarrassing.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I reckon it's all a persona/front to lead the revs, whereas deep down he's a goofball like his father and his son. <br><br>But he's clearly intelligent though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>not really, they are a million times better than shitpanda but thats not hard but they still have many translation erros and their fucking nigger language makes me want to tear off my scrotum. Powermanga is the best by far, but sadly slow as fuck and since we are all impatient faggots we could never wait for them to catch up.</br>  <br>He and Kuzan are are on the side of honorable justice. They do what's right, not just follow orders blindly (pardon the pun).</br>  <br>Just wait for Viz translations</br>  <br> Akainu confronts Fujitora <br> Fujitora tells him he did what was right and that he knows Akainu will punish him <br> Akainu says was it worth dying for <br> Fujitora explains he knows what happened between him and Aokiji and that he doesn't kill fellow admirals <br> Akainu magma fists him and tells him he doesn't know shit </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cover story has his eyes be super duper kawaii eyes </br>  <br> doflamingo is secretly a bishie <br> Covers his eyes to keep bitches off him similar to senor pink </br></br>  <br>Wasn't Sabo the eldest to begin with?<br><br>Pretty sure Sabo was older than Ace. Wiki tells me so too. That's why he set sail first.</br></br></br>  <br>Nah, Kuzan is more ambiguous. I don't think he would bow or apologize. <br><br>He still destroyed Ohara, killed his friend Saul, gave Spandam the golden Den Den Mushi, joined the Blackbeard Pirates, etc.</br></br></br>  <br> implying based Fujitora won't just block magma fist with his sword/haki just like Shanks did. </br>  <br>So Akainu is Lawful Evil, Kizaru is Chaotic Neutral, Fujitora is Lawful Good and Kuzan is Lawful Neutral.</br>  <br>Weren't all of the executives captured? Who would the cover story even be about?</br>  <br>Lawful Good? Woah now. Let's not go crazy. Blind dude has only done the things he did this arc for his own personal vendetta against the shichibukai.</br>  <br> joined the Blackbeard Pirates <br>Wait, what? When was this?</br></br>  <br>He epicly trolled you, man.</br>  So what now? Luffy has become the precise thing he did not want to become. A hero, with full media coverage and international notoriety to boot.<br>Are Fujitora and his crew a separatist faction within the world government, or are they moles aiming to change it from within? Are they possibly at odds with the Tenryubito? Goddammit you can't call Luffy a pirate any more, just have Sabo draft him and Fuji into the revolutionary army already.</br>  <br>Except until this chapter where he showed he didn't give a fuck if his boss sees him being humble and prostrating himself to the former king. He knew that this stuff going on was wrong, and the World Govt new the whole time. He's basically admitting the World Govt is fucked up.</br>  <br>People think he joined them but all we know is that him and blackbeard have some sort of relationship because Burgess told blackbeard not to trust Aokiji</br>  <br><br><br> forgot the picture</br></br></br>  <br> revolutionary second in command <br> a man who declared war on the government, punched a Tenryuubito, broke into and out of prison, and invaded Marineford twice <br> a traitorous Shichibukai who betrayed the WG and had temporarily lost his title <br> ex-government scientist arms dealer <br> other pirates and criminals with a total bounty in the billions <br> all allowed to run free to prove a point to the Gorosei <br><br>Akainu is mad as fuck. Plus bowing is humiliating. <br><br>Maybe we'll see Green Bull</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Crocodile tears, mang. By admitting blame for this he casts more doubt on the shichibukai. That's what he's after. Undeniably ulterior motives for his actions. He's not a good guy.</br>  <br>Bad, bad typesetting.</br>  <br>I hope we cut to him the very next chapter<br><br><br>I don't think any artist is capable of demonstrating how mad he would actually be<br><br>It would be like that hitler video where gets dubbed except magma and corpses are everywhere</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127482064 <br>Fucking go die on a ditch stupid frogposter</br>  <br>All of Arlong's crew were captured too <br>  its about Monet and Vergo </br></br>  <br> "Weren't Baroque Works captured? Who would the cover story even be about?" <br><br>I need to stop visiting these threads. The number of people who have either read One Piece once or not at all is getting overwhelming</br></br></br>  <br><br>Here's what I never understood - why the fuck didn't Arlong go to ID?</br></br>  <br><br>are there any fishman in ID?<br><br>They probably segregate by species</br></br></br></br>  <br>Jimmy-B went to Impel Down.</br>  <br><br>Ah maybe - Jinbe was, but that would be because of Shichibukai.</br></br>  <br>Except the BW cover story followed Goldenweek, Valentine, and 5. None of which were captured at Little Garden.<br><br>Although  Is probably right.</br></br></br>  Holy shit that ending was amazing<br>How many big shots will be tracking down Luffy and Law now that it's public they took down Doffy?<br>Will Yonkous go after them to talk and form alliances now?</br></br>  <br>Probably send them to the desert hell level. Worst fate for a fish.</br>  <br>Read the fucking manga holy shit. Arlong was imprisoned in ID already and was released when Jinbei became a warlord<br><br>He was probably considered to be of greater importance the first time he was sent there since the Sun Pirates were such a big deal (that and being caught by Borsalino). He's more of a shitter now and his defeat and capture wasn't as significant</br></br></br>  I'm excited for what'll happen to Usopps name. If this is a Alabasta mirror, key individuals will get recognized like Zoro and Luffy were. God Usopp can't just disappear, right? <br><br> Good arc to be an Ussopfag </br></br>  <br><br>He was still a Level 1 or even Level 2 level prisoner though with his bounty and history, just surprising.</br></br>  <br>There has to be more fishman than arlong or jinbe<br><br>I cant remember a single one other than those two in impel down and those were super special circumstances.<br><br> All those prisoners we got to see seems like there would have been a bunch of namless fishman in there<br><br>They didnt seem to have any other races in their either.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Probably just plot. Arlong would not have played along with Luffy's escape game. He only had a 20 million bounty, so he'd be on the first floor with Buggy. Maybe he just slipped out and dove into the ocean during the chaos<br><br>In Jinbe's cover story when he finds the upside down towns, for a second I thought it was Arlong flipping over towns again<br><br><br>Thats true, you'd need an HQ escort to get him from East Blue to ID, and thats probably more trouble than its worth. They didn't even hunt down Morgan when he escaped</br></br></br></br></br></br>  It feels like assistants are drawing the majority of these chapters with all the filler stock reaction faces and purposely slow pacing everywhere.  <br>Usopp can't be recognised or it'll break the liar story dealie he's got going on. His hometown can't ever know that he's a famous pirate and has gone on crazy adventures when he returns.</br>  <br>Yes, and Mr. 2 broke out himself, every agent reunited, and most escaped. Considering this is Doflamingo, something similar could easily happen with one breaking out or Doffy having more men behind the scenes.</br>  <br> implying most fishmen wouldn't simply be executed <br> implying most fishmen aren't shitters that arent worth Impel Down <br> implying Arlong wasn't just barely worth Impel Down even during a time when Fishmen were at their peak of piracy <br> implying several giants weren't imprisoned (and said to be in consideration Dorry and Broggy) in Impel Down <br><br>Jinbei and Fisher were special cases, even Hody only managed to be almost New World level, and it took him overdosing to the point that his life was shortened to a few hours at most.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, God Ussop is a thing that would spread, it would be funny to see if it gets twisted somehow. It would be enough if Kaya and the Usopp pirates became aware of it. That being said another "World Reaction" would be great. Cameos from characters we haven't seen in a while.</br>  <br> filler reaction faces <br> purposely slow pacing <br> "these chapters" <br><br>So is this your first or second arc? Or maybe you read the first couple a few years ago and all at once instead of weekly?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>didnt jimbe ask the wg to release arlong</br>  Since Trebol survived the suicide explosion is it possible that Monet and Vergo also survived?  <br>Well the "From the Decks of the World" cover arc 4 years ago covered most of the old friends, and we saw Crocodile and Bonney after Punk Hazard. We still need to check up on<br> Buggy <br> Akainu in full <br> Kizaru <br> Dragon <br> Moriah <br> Marco and co (?) <br>I feel like this one wil be more about the power players than East Blue people again</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> possible <br><br>It's more than likely. Not sure why everyone is surprised about villains living in one piece.</br></br></br>  <br>Because ID isn't the only jail.</br>  <br>If that's really all he cared about he wouldn't have told the marine soldiers to get over there and broadcast it.</br>  <br>It mostly comes with the territory of how complex One Piece has gotten since the New World and possibly down to Oda not having the sufficient time to plan far ahead. As much as I will miss the old formula of isolated arcs like Thriller Bark and Skypiea where he could be as creative as possible, he has an ambitious story to wrap up and wont be doing this forever. <br><br>Grand plot advancement has been the driving force of this arc though and the emotional strength we are used to has been put secondary. He is skilled enough to weave the two together but just hasn't managed it this time. In the past he would have fitted the contents of this chapter into half the pages so it feels deliberate.</br></br></br>   Kouichi Yamadera <br>Holy cashew nut, praise Toei, this is perfect.</br>  <br>He set sail first because he was tired of his living situation. Remember he was still a kid when he attempted to set sail.</br>  <br>I think this chapter was fine. An enormous improvement over the cheering and countdown chapters we got for the past month. The Sabo stuff went too long, but it could be that I just don't like Sabo.<br><br>I disagree with you saying Oda doesn't plan far enough ahead. I think he has too many ideas and his story keeps gettign bigger and bigger, and he's in a position where he can tell every detail the way he wants to. Each element of Dressrosa was good-to-great individually, and there's nothing I think you could convince him to cut, but together the arc gets pretty cluttered and very long. Its worrying to think how long it took to take out a relatively minor villain like Doflamingo when theres still so much established story to get too, plus new stuff and returning characters. These arcs will just get bigger and bigger</br></br></br>  <br>Kaidou will kill them for sure, ending One Piece next year.</br>  <br>really? No one commenting on how that's a new bounty poster?</br>  <br>Yeah, we'll definitely get some reactions from the WG, Revolutionaries (through Sabo I assume), and Kaido (and the underworld?).

What the fuck is this?</br>  <br><br>Lel.</br></br>  <br>Toei should be ashamed of how bad this shit is.</br>  So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now?<br><br>If the Gorosei go over Akainu and ask Luffy to become a Shichibukai to replace Doflamingo's seat, he'll be even more livid, but he won't be able to do shit about it<br><br>And it would be a smart political move if the Gorosei figure out that Luffy is not in collusion with his father to overthrow the World Governement, they could get Monkey D. to join the navy, similar to when Hitler joined the US Navy, and get him back together with his grandfather so they can use him to their advantage and in their eyes hopefully try and bring him over to their side<br><br> but anon, Luffy would never accept being Shichibukai <br><br>He may not have a choice if Fujitora won't let him off Dressrosa without accepting the position first, and Luffy will be in no condition to fight it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  First time until the haki countdown that I've actually fully enjoyed a chapter again  <br> Luffy <br> Schichibukai <br><br>If Fuji doesn't disband it, fuck no. It goes against Luffy's entire philosophy.</br></br></br></br>    <br> So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now? <br><br>hopefully not, it's retarded even for these threads' standards</br></br></br>  <br> if Fujitora won't let him off Dressrosa without accepting the position first <br><br>uuuh... did you forget that fujitora fucking hates the shichibukai title and wants to abolish it? What are you smoking?</br></br></br>   Yes. His father Barrels was a marine officer, and Drake dreamt to become a marine while he was admitting his father. But something happened and his father became a pirate, and used violence even on his own son, he really became a cruel man. Drake believed in his Dad and followed him, he was 19 years old at that time. Yet he, who feared his own father, looked much younger. And then Drake was protected by the marine and became one himself. Despite him being able to make it up to a marine officer, he dropped his career and became a pirate. What did happen to him!? I'm curious what will happen soon!! <br><br>Get hype for X Drake arc.</br></br>  <br>I'll miss him. Hopefully the Dofly crew will get a mini story. Just like the Baroque works and CP9</br>  <br>You mispelled Kaidou arce with X Drake being Law 2.0</br>   The groups the strawhats split up in during punk hazzard was the same as dressrosa. <br>just realized this</br>  <br> So does anyone else think Luffy will be become a Shichibukai now? <br>Nobody with a brain no<br> Implying Akainu wouldn't shit fire over this decision <br> Implying the WG would just overlook Luffy's heinous acts against them up till this point <br> Implying Luffy would accept </br></br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep saying that Scopper Gaban is Kaido?  <br>Probably ZoSan, yeah. <br><br>I need him to fuck me in the ass, right now.<br> I'm going to miss him so much. </br></br></br></br>  <br> +100 chapters of Drake-wanking </br>  <br><br>I didn't know anyone still was.<br><br>It's supposed to all be in the smile Scopper had matching Kaido's original silhoutte's smile isn't it?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Praise Toei <br>Not even once.</br></br>  <br>Because everyone wants Kaido and other characters like the unknown 7th Shichibukai to be characters we met before, as stupid as that sounds</br>  <br><br>Or 100 chapters of mecha Franky fighting Indominus.</br></br>  <br><br> mfw the ship group are the shit members and brook </br></br>  <br> Because everyone wants Kaido and other characters like the unknown 7th Shichibukai to be characters we met before, as stupid as that sounds <br>That does sound stupid, and considering the hype being built around him, who would even qualify to secretly be Kaido without being a huge letdown?</br></br>  <br>and after that<br> 100 chapters of Urouge wanking <br> 100 chapters of Capone Bege wanking </br></br></br>  http://strawpoll.me/4806850  <br>We've seen part of Kaidous face. He looks nothing like him. Is this the latest retard idea floating throughout the general?</br>  <br> capone bege <br> urouge <br>I can't shake off the feeling that they're side characters at best and will never be directly involved with the SH.<br>And maybe we'll get KidHawPoo in the Kaidou arc too.</br></br></br></br>  <br> We've seen part of Kaidous face. <br>You're not talking about that silhouette thing Oda does are you? Because in case you forgot, he did the same thing with Jinbei and they looked *nothing* alike.<br> Not that I' m saying I agree with the Gaban theory, because that's just retarded </br></br></br>  <br> Jinbei  <br><br>I don't remember him doing that with Jinbei. And I was thinking of that, but also of one of the color spreads that featured him. But either way, Big Mom's silhouette looks like her, I have no reason to believe Kaido's wont. looks like her.</br></br></br>  <br>Urouge is directly tied to Enel, and KidHawkPoo are after Big Mom. <br><br>Capone is shit though.</br></br></br>  <br> KidHawkPoo are after Big Mom <br>Wait, was this confirmed?</br></br>  <br>yes it's pretty much confirmed when they started sinking yonkou ships</br>  <br> Whatever happened to that? <br>It's in your link.</br></br>  <br> Not knowing that kid is a psychopath that fucks shit up for no reason <br>Sinking ships means nothing m8</br></br>  <br> Sinking ships means nothing <br><br>Apoo kid and Hawkins didn't start an alliance for shits and giggles.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant they are definitely going to be involved because no yonkou let's that slide.<br><br>it's an open declaration of war and if you dont take care of it every snotnosed pirate will think you are weak<br><br>it's like letting someone have your fruitcup in prison</br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Cuz they're going after Shanks. I'm only partially joking about this</br>    What will Saka kuns reaction to the release of this information to the public be?  8 people voted for Rebecca joining the SH crew, it seems she is more popular than some people believe. (by the way, the "no" votes are rigged)<br>http://strawpoll.me/4806850/</br>    Post yfw the firebird suite is used in the anime when Luffy is doing the king kong gun.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=DD2<wbr>G8d3l2Zw</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> 8 people out of 100 <br> more popular than some people believe </br></br>  <br> 811 people voted Rebecca joining strawhats <br><br>This is a joke, right?</br></br></br>  We all know Doffy's getting locked up and covered up.<br><br>All word about a disruption in Dressrosa was simply unrest caused by the crew/s of Monkey D. Luffy and/or Trafalgar [D] Law when they stopped by the island. The WG apologizes as it was not able to intercept them in time.<br><br>Also anyone on any islands around Dressrosa is not permitted to discuss Dressrosa. Failure to comply will result in severe punishment.<br><br>Admiral Fujitora has been placed on administrative leave with pay pending investigations of corruption.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm probably the only one, but I would really love for them to take out Blackbeard offscreen.<br><br>Every appearance he has made since Jaya has made him less and less interesting. He's dropped from one of the most interesting characters to somewhere below Caesar in interest level for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Sorry I read too quickly, there are actually more than 800 people for Rebecca.</br>  <br>Oh I see<br>strawpoll was rigged by bots, and nobody likes Rebecca<br>my bad</br></br></br>  <br>Except the world knows. And Fuji just apologized.</br>  <br>Did you miss the part were an admiral and all the marines with him bowed down and asked forgiveness to everyone in Dressrosa, blaming the WG for all these years of suffering and that all that is already going around the world? There is no way this can be silenced at this point.</br>  Will Fujitora be fired from the government?  <br>I would honestly be surprised if Luffy even offered. The chances are literally zero that she would take it after finding out about the family she didn't know she had.</br>  <br>Good luck with that.</br>  <br>No, but maybe there will be some more tension between the govt and marines from now on.</br>  <br><br><br>And you two missed the part where as of right now that is only broadcasted to the three closest islands. If the WG moves quickly that can be easily contained.</br></br></br>  <br>And the paper that everyone gets.</br>  <br> implying Absa's journalistic integrity can be contained </br>  <br> mfw I read a doujin I thought was DoflaCroc but it ended up being Croc being raped by BB while hallucinating he was being fucked by Doffy <br>Forever scarred. I never want to see his ugly mug again.</br></br>  <br> nearest three islands + dressrosa get buster called <br> islands close to those islands notice that their neighbours got buster called <br> those islands get buster called too to prevent anything from leaking, people might start thinking something happened on Dressrosa <br> buster call spread over the entire new world <br> paradise gets buster called  <br> all four blues get buster called <br> marie joa gets buster called <br> the moon gets buster called <br> everyone gets buster called <br> no more information leaks </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>http://captiongenerator.com/48436/A<wbr>kainu-reacts-to-Fujitoras-Broadcast<wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>No, he's at least due for partial credit on the Doffy issue.</br>  <br>There's no way that he actually likes the WG though, right?</br>  <br>Maybe he'll tie them up and tell them he'll let them be his fuckboys. <br>The part with Bonney was just foreshadowing.</br></br>  <br>The WG decides the laws, what is right and wrong, he lives for the WG.</br>  <br>It's not about the world government. It's about making the Marines look incompetent. We know he explicitly wanted to toughen them up. He went so far as to make a conscription to do so. And here are one of his conscripted admirals bowing and apologizing instead of killing off a bunch of weakened pirates.<br><br>Congrats you got rid of doflamingo..but now Luffy and Law are heroes, Sabo got away, Burgess got away, Hundreds of other pirates are on luffy's sides, millions more of people will be willing to help him now making it harder to capture him.<br><br>Fujitora completely fucked over akainu with his even if Akainu agrees the shichibukai system is as fucked as Fujitora says. There were a billion different ways to get rid of it that didnt make it seem like the pirates are good guys and the marines are evil doofuses.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Three closest islands <br> Some faggot journalist already sent out the news canaries to the rest of the world </br></br>  <br> he lives for the WG. <br> We need a Sakazuki edit of this gif </br></br>  So I think we can all agree that this guy has an ant zoan devil fruit. Ants are after all the strongest organism. Also it would make a lot of sense and tie into drake. When drake was a kid he followed a weakling captain. Dinosaurs are usually stronger than ants. This is probably a mental thing drake has and supports kaido being an ant zoan. Also In Hunter x Hunter the strongest character was an ant.  So, fuckhuge new bounties time?  <br> Ants are after all the strongest organism.  <br><br> not the waterbear fruit </br></br></br>  <br>Will sanji and the others get bounties too?</br>  <br><br> Not the pistol shrimp zoan </br></br>  <br> not knowing the difference between strength and durability </br>  "Stop resisting Issho, do not think your gravity works with me.<br>Who would be push a Magma man to the center of the Earth only to come back stronger?<br>You let the devil and terrorist escape and shamed all who defend the righteous<br>Now face absolute justice"</br></br></br>  <br>If you meant strength as literal strength then it would be the dung beetle</br>  <br><br><br><br>We Terra Formars now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off terra formar fag</br>  <br> Ants are after all the strongest organism. <br>icameheretolaughatyou.jpg<br>Do you even dung beetle</br></br></br>  <br><br> I've never seen nor read Terra Formars <br> Hell this is pretty much the only exposure I've had to it </br></br></br>  <br>But someone already ate that fruit</br>  <br>Nice quads but I thought it was not specified what beetle is he,and dung beetles are black</br>  <br>I assume oda gave all the insects to the dwarves so humans wouldn't be too overpowered.</br>  <br>he has the rhinoceros beetle which is pretty strong<br><br><br>Not dung beetle strong<br><br>but one of the strongest</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Tales of their fishman island &amp; punk hazard exploits might have spread by now.<br>They won't be due for as large an increase though.</br></br>  <br>Although it seems dwarves are naturally stronger than humans?<br>Also if Oda really wants too I'm sure we are going to see more insect Zoans, especially thanks to all the Smile users we are going to encounter.</br></br>  <br>The most likely outcome of all of this.</br>  <br> Although it seems dwarves are naturally stronger than humans? <br><br><br>They are but they can easily be written out of the story after this arc.<br><br>I just think he doesn't want to deal with the logistics of someone having an ant fruit or such<br><br>can you imagine zoro 100x stronger than he is now?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Sai a nigger in the Anime?</br>  Lucci is a very good boy.  <br><br>Just cause their 100x stronger doesn't make them 100x smarter</br></br>  What made him such a big dick G?

I think sanji is stronger and achieved that strength around enies lobby.  <br>It's not exactly easy to tell when we only barely saw Zeff fight, and even that was with a peg leg.</br>  <br>no. I dont think he is.

I think two.</br></br></br>  <br>Why doesn't Buggy split atoms and blows up the Grand Line?</br>  <br>Its obviously Burgess, his primary hunting weapon seems to be a knife</br>  <br>you guys are the masters of bad theories</br>  <br>Obviously Marco that dog to save his people from Akainu the fist of justice</br>  <br>You mean two parts or movie two?</br>  <br>I meant I think only the movie about shiki and the one with zephyr have canonical parts.</br>  Is the general opinion that the voice actors are the only things Toei gets right or they even slipping in that regard nowadays?  <br>sanji has the best va . Makes oda laugh and influences how sanjis character should be.</br>  <br>Bellamy won't join<br><br>Violet could join but in all likelihood won't, she has no reason to leave now that she can be together with King Riku, Kyros, and Rebecca<br><br>For the same reason it's unlikely Rebecca will join <br><br>Barto won't join<br><br>Law won't join<br><br>No one is joining from this arc. If anything, all we'll get is that Law will be a permanent ally or the equivalent of a division commander for Luffy.<br><br>I doubt we'll get a new member until we reach the next major arc which in all likelihood is Wano.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because buggy is a weak faggot <br><br>I think akainu is going to draft in a new admiral to replace Fujitora, he pretty much accomplished his goal anyway. We may see him in wano as the kings guard or something <br><br>Looks like he woke up as soon as they chained him up and started crying <br>Why didn't law just throw a rock into the ocean and switch it with doffy <br>Reminder that she will have gone off in the sunset to suck off random fodder the next arc we see sai in</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post a better One Piece ass  So how is the hole in the Shichibukai gonna be filled this time?  <br>They'll give it to Kidd</br>  Say hello to the new Straw Hat  <br> literally no ass can be seen <br>wow thanks anon</br></br>  <br>Luffy will never accept him, he did too much fucked up shit.</br>  <br>new law pirate*</br>  <br> shounen <br><br>he teamed up with buggy who was just as bad</br></br></br>    <br>why does he always remind me of Orochimaru</br>  I'm rereading this for fun...<br><br>I wonder what's going through Luffy's head as he bows? I mean, I know he's lighthearted and wants to have fun, and I know he does have a serious side, but he's not retarded.</br></br>  <br>You seem to forget that Robin helped Crocodile to put a bomb that would have killed 2 million people.<br><br>She's not a saint by any means.</br></br></br>  <br>because he is a orochimaru rip off</br>  <br>Beat me to it.</br>  <br>Orochimaru<br>Caesar<br>Mayuri<br><br>There has to be at least one in each manga.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was going to make a joke about Usopp's ass, but even his is obscured. All asses are obscured.</br>  So just a though -<br><br>At the beginning of the day in Chapter 700, we can see Jinbe reading the paper with the news about Luffy and Law and see it again from a different angle in 760.<br><br>Because of what happens later in Jinbe's cover story, does that mean that most of it happened in the future? IE, the night of that same day (which we aren't at yet on Dressrosa) and tomorrow?</br></br></br></br>  <br> hxh <br><br>uh...Pariston?</br></br></br>  <br>Luffy learned from Shanks that personal pride doesn't mean anything, so he'll take a ton of abuse if it means his crew or friend gets help. It's one of his major differences from Roger, who was all temper.</br>  <br>Yeah, but he just sacrificed his crew for these three members.</br>  <br>ohana means family</br>  <br>Long black hair<br>Ghostly pale skin<br>Yellow eyes<br>Eyeliner<br>High pitch voice<br>Bad scientists <br>World Known mentor<br>Experiments specifically on children<br><br> let's give him horns to differentiate him from that other mango </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What is this inception?</br>  <br>Stitch, pls.</br>  <br>Yeah he teamed up with Buggy, he wouldn't let him join his crew</br>  <br>It's particularly the final 3 instalments.<br><br>760 - Reading the paper with the news about Luffy, Law and Doflamingo<br>-----------------------------------<wbr>------<br>782 - A party that night<br>783 - Teaming up with Wadatsumi<br>785 - Leaving the next day<br><br>I guess this means that he isn't turning up to help out Sanji's crew. He doesn't even leave the island he's on until tomorrow.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br> Sai constantly getting pregnant </br>  <br> Buggy <br> Spat on/ripped his strawhat and shit-talked about Shanks <br><br> Robin <br> Helped Crocodile nearly destroy an entire country <br><br> Bellamy <br> Embarrased Nami and robbed some nice monkeys <br><br> Luffy <br> Not accepting people <br><br>This is just what happens when you're a simple,  underwritten  Shounen MC</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I always assumed that that article was about Doflamingo leaving the Shichibukai and the article about the Heart/Strawhat alliance. If you go back you can see that you have Doffy on the cover and an article on the alliance somewhere in the middle.</br></br></br>  <br>So, the day he left with wadatsumi is the day Luffy won?</br>  <br> Sai </br>  <br> Sai </br>  <br>who cares about embarrassed nami it wasnt about that at all.</br>  <br>George Lopez: Japanese edition</br>   just realized baby 5 was a drill hair.  <br><br><br>oda must have made me look at something else with his art style</br></br></br>  <br>No, it's tomorrow<br><br><br>That is what the article is about. Well, it's two separate articles.<br><br>The paper came out in chapter 699, this morning in the Dressrosa arc. The day that were still in. Jinbe is seen reading that same paper in 700 and 760. It is today's paper.<br><br>Jinbe reading the article in 760 means that the cover story must be set today or later. It can't possible be any earlier because the call they made to Doflamingo, forcing him to quite the Shichibukai only happened yesterday after Punk Hazard.<br><br>In 782, at the end of the cover story - they have a party in the night and in 783 and 785 it's day again when he leaves with Wadatsumi.<br><br>782 is set on the night that we haven't actually got to yet in the main story and 783 and 785 are set tomorrow or later.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>......I fucked up</br></br>  <br>No, Kaido's second in command will have it though. The guy who does the enforcing.</br>  <br>A big part of why Impel Down is so useful and impenetrable is its location. You can't just make another one. And you forget that it's much easier for Marines to travel than pirates. They don't have to go through Fishman Island, they can travel the Calm Belt, they are able to get through all the Gates of Justice and ride those currents, etc. All New World criminals have always gone to Impel Down throughout its history, no reason it would suddenly be harder to do now.</br>  <br>Well I agree with that<br>But considering what I found in 2nd movie, whenever there's a mizu mizu fruit user in the future it's gonna give me a thought that "she's dead" regardless of how irrelevant the movie is</br></br>    <br>yeah if the fillers used it will never be a real fruit. They have to ask oda if he has plans for one before they use it.<br><br>The problem with Mizu mizu is it makes no sense for a logia since that's every fruit user's weakness. <br><br>Either that user becomes immune to that weakness or is utterly powerless.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> whenever there's a mizu mizu fruit user in the future it's gonna give me a thought that <br>That wasn't the mizu mizu fruit. It was the toro toro fruit. Well all intents and purpose it functioned like a water power would but officially speaking her fruit allowed her to transform into a vague, unnamed liquid.</br></br>  <br>More like he has a lot of allies, who arent his crew, yet in the end they will show yourself i guess so. He saved like 2 countries already and shitloads of ppl.</br>  <br>*for all intents and purposes</br>  <br> 2 countries <br>You mean like 5.</br></br>  <br>Doffy will be spared by the Gorosei or the Celestial Dragons for use as a super secret spy henchmen maybe even CP0.</br>    <br>Might not be used to prevent irony, just like revealing Doffy without his glasses<br><br>Oops didn't realizes that, thanks for reminding</br></br></br>  <br> Either one of them letting him live while he's not in a position to try to blather whatever important secret he knows </br>  <br> it will be 10 years before we learn that secret <br><br>Hope you guys packed well</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, there's a swim swim fruit, so miracles can happen</br>  <br>It cant swim in water though</br>  <br>Why would that matter when EVERYTHING is water?</br>  <br>Since he can clearly swim in some kind of weird pocket dimension, I wonder if he can swim on the surface of water.</br>   "No dad, I am no longer a pilot...

All the outfits are equally slutty.</br>  <br>I have always wondered, but I don't remember Sento being in a bunny suit before.</br>  <br>She's probably just mad that she doesn't have the chest to make use of it properly.</br>   Sento reignited my love for healthy bodies.   <br>Meanwhile Salama is excited at the prospect of being in her waifu's clothes and mixing their bodily fluids together</br>  <br>Am I the only one disappointed that they all just tried on Muse's outfit instead of swapping them all around?</br>  <br>I know google searches differ by region.

I thought it is like calling a female a virgin; it is unfair, but it seems the insult doesn't work unless it is a guy.</br></br>  <br>They're both terrible with expressing their true feelings</br>  <br>Are you autist or just catholic?</br>  <br>Just fuck already</br>  <br>But sento was clearly embarrassed and jealous over not having as much sexual experience as AV girl.</br>  <br> Are you autist or just catholic? <br>Calling a female submissive and timid just doesn't work as an insult. I am not saying this is right, but I don't make the cultural rules. Insults only work if it implied social expectations. It's like complaining that a housewife doesn't have a paying job.</br></br>  <br>Why don't they just fuck already?<br>Do their relationship get better in the novel?</br></br>  <br>See </br>  <br>Nope.<br>Kanye was aware of her feeling, but decided to play dense.</br></br>  <br>Oops that was meant to reply to<br/></br>  <br> Why don't they just fuck already? <br> Do their relationship get better in the novel? <br>Sento got her feeling across and Kayne acknowledged it. But it is done via subtext because both are not ready to go any further for now.<br>Sento called him Seiya instead of Kanie-kun, and "fixed his tie" when there was nothing wrong with it. He gets the hint.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Virgin" doesn't mean "submissive and timid"</br>  <br> "Virgin" doesn't mean "submissive and timid" <br>I am just listing a variety of examples which doesn't work as insults on females, I am not implying they are the same things.</br></br>  latifa is better  <br>Maybe not in your /pol/ and /r9k/ infested mind but not everyone is still obsessed over rigidly conforming to one set of gender roles from the 50s.</br>  <br> Maybe not in your /pol/ and /r9k/ infested mind but not everyone is still obsessed over rigidly conforming to one set of gender roles from the 50s. <br>I am not from pol, but insults are meant to be outdated and politically incorrect, that is what makes them insults.</br></br>  <br> gender roles from the 50s. <br>But it was ideal gender roles</br></br>  <br>Considering that all the alpha/beta stuff for wolves has been long found out to be incorrect, yes, it's a made up fucking classification so you can call anyone that.</br>  <br> Considering that all the alpha/beta stuff for wolves has been long found out to be incorrect, yes, it's a made up fucking classification so you can call anyone that. <br>his has nothing to do with biology.

And hurry up and croak so the younger generations can fix your fucking mistakes.</br>  <br><br>SENTO PLEASE</br></br>  <br>More like Kadokawa is jews.</br>  <br/>  <br>There is a difference between being submissive and timid and literally running away from uncomfortable situations.<br><br>Also, housewives that don't work are called leechers.</br></br></br>  <br>Has to make up somehow for being a shut-in always ill hime-sama</br>  <br>Fire.</br>  <br> hurr I hate when anime girls do anything but sit around being blobs </br>  <br>A small price to pay for an eternal loli.</br>  <br> ?</br>  I like how this OVA actually looks worse than the TV show they did that just wrapped up. I'm no big Kyoani fan but even I can that Ishihara is pretty much their only good director and pretty much the only reason they get the level of acclaim they do for visual styles. He's seriously better off leaving the company and going freelance, he could probably accomplish a lot more without having to be tied down doing only shows about moe girls.  <br>/r9k/?</br>  <br>Earth and Air.</br>  <br>Does /r9k/ hate moeblobs? I haven't been there since the robot was turned off and it became even more of a meme board.</br>  <br><br>Sento has such a fat pussy.</br></br>  <br>To be fair she got help from Ashe</br>  <br>Running away after giving a gift is a very beta thing in any culture regardless of gender.</br>  <br>Before the novel ends, they better at least  hold hands. </br>  <br><br>Am I the only one who almost came when she was about to snap from the work overload and with desperation in her voice, called out to Ashe?</br></br>  <br>Never, because it's shit. Just like Hyouka.</br>  <br>KyoAni once again proves to be the saviour of anime.</br>  <br>Man, I want to see that animated.</br>  <br> She flipped her antenna back to match Salama's <br>Cute.</br></br>  <br>They just need a translator.</br>  <br>Chuujou would be legal in a few years.

Any help?</br></br>  <br>調子に乗る</br>  <br> 調子に乗る <br><br>Agh, thank you! So then the な makes it a negative command? Something like "don't get carried away"/"don't get cocky"?</br></br></br>  <br>調子に乗る = to be elated; to be excited; to be caught up in the moment; to be carried away; to get cocky<br>調子乗んなよ basically means "Don't fucking get excited". The whole sentence would mean something like:<br> Don't fucking get excited because I'm also going with you. </br></br></br>  <br>Well, don't get carried away works better on second thought.</br>  As a newcomer who has lurked in /djt/ threads for a while: would you recommend doing RTK first and then grammar + a core deck, or just disregard RTK entirely and learn kanji from vocabulary?      <br><br>Thank you! But I'm still a little confused as to how this grammar is formed. Does this "んな" contraction happen regularly with negative commands in casual speech?</br></br>  <br>ん is a (failed) contraction of る and な. You can use it with verbs that end with る (ichidan or godan)<br><br>こっち来んな！<br>さっきから蹴んな！<br><br>it does this because る tends to disappear when you say things quickly</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>In certain levels, he's not a normal part of the cast.</br>  なせば大抵なんとかなる！<br><br>As long as you never give up and you keep pushing to better yourself, you'll make it no matter what.

Shouldn't it be "it has rained"? Isn't 降る one of those verbs?  <br>Because it implies he's above the beginner level that's he's set with this audio, and not on mount stupid, while simultaneously putting others down for not having practiced listening.

Or I mean, it obviously is not. But it seems like it should. Being similar to 降りる, 上る et.c. How do you tell?</br>  <br>Because he listened and realized that he can't even understand a children's story.<br>so he's trying to tell other people that they're in the same boat as him.<br>it's a fact that what he's saying is true.<br>but he's dumb as shit for giving this much of a fuck about it. find the transcript, anon, learn what they're saying, listen again, and move on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> 9 out of 10 retarded japanese learners <br>what an official sounding statistic</br></br>  <br>B called C and A was negatively affected by it?</br>  <br>I think he means intransitive. Where 木の枝が折れている isn't "trees branch is breaking", but "tree branch is broken, and remains in that state." <br><br>I don't know all the rules to that, or if there are any rules. Just keep in mind that ている has a few functions. <br> ing 食べている "eating" <br> continued state　結婚している "married, and still am" <br> sequence of actions for movement verbs 行っている "went, and is there now" <br><br>At least that's how I understand it. I could be wrong.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know of a particular rule or a resource that lists them. I think you just need to read a lot and figure out which is meaning is more commonly meant.<br><br>降っている leans towards "raining" to me, but I'm not a native.</br></br></br>  <br>This is another case of people wasting their time in this thread trying to be superior to others for no good reason.<br><br>It's two things in action: The "suffering" passive, and the common construction of に電話する "To call on the telephone"<br><br> AはBにCに電話された。 <br> Cに電話された <br>C was called<br> AはBに <br>By B, to A's displeasure.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Passive, causative, etc. you fucking drone.</br>  <br>This sentence really does throw me off though. A being the subject　he's the one calling C right. And B is the one making him do it?</br>  <br>That's easier.</br>  <br>ている can mean that in verbs that involve a change, and if the object is still in the final state of the change. Like 降りる means to go from somewhere high to somewhere low, in other words a change. So if the person is still in the low place after having descended, you can use ている. But the change in ふる is not when it stops raining. It is when it begins raining. The change is going from no rain to rain. Therefore, to use ている one must be in the final state of the change, which is raining. Therefore "it is raining". If it had stopped raining, we would no longer be in the resultant state and ている can not be used. Only た.<br><br>If you want to say "It has stopped raining" using ている you must find a verb in which the change is going from rain to no rain. For example 雨が止んでいる</br></br></br>  <br>So pretty much the same as everyone else here who spend their time looking for ways to project and put other people down, exactly as you have just done?</br>  <br>No it's not. <br>Even less so for an English speaker. It is objectively more complex. <br><br>I wish Tae Kim never shut down his forum. You sycophants really need to fuck off.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just say that there are too types of verbs: action verbs and state verbs.</br>  <br>two*</br>  <br>You objectively have to learn more to know how to conjugate all the different verbs into past tense. I wish people would stop nit-picking Tae Kim as if that somehow made them better.</br>  <br>Watch out. C was indeed called. But not by B. He was called by A and the one who made him do it was B.</br>  <br>Conjugation is not the hard part at all. It's the mindset for a way saying things that just doesn't exist in the English language that's hard and that's exactly what the causative form is.</br>  Do many of you have speaking partners? I'm looking at the only link for it in the guide but I really haven't tried speaking japanese yet and don't feel like fucking up royally to someone I can barely understand.  <br>How many times are people going to fall for this one? It's unnatural Japanese, no one is going to speak like this because even natives think it's confusing.</br>  <br>Not true. No one is making anyone call anyone. Maybe you are confusing passive with causative form.</br>  New to the thread. Why is Rosetta Stone not listed as a learning resource? Just curious so don't sperg out.  <br>I fully agree with you, also the mix of 使役受身形 is really annoying as well. Conjugating verbs is just, well, conjugating verbs.</br>  <br>If you translate it literally it means Rain is falling. In english, the verb is "to rain" itself, but in Japanese 降る is the "falling" verb, which the rain is doing.</br>  <br>whats a roseta stone?</br>  <br>It's shit.</br>  <br>Tae Kim makes some pretty huge mistakes in his guide though, at best misleading and at worst completely wrong.<br><br>For example something as simple and essential as the は particle. In his guide he states:<br><br> The 「が」 particle identifies a specific property of something while the 「は」 particle is used only to bring up a new topic of conversation. <br><br>This is horseshit and it made me misunderstand the は particle for like a whole year into my study, until I happened to come across this video and saw how much it conflicts with the info I got from Tae Kim: http://www.gwu.edu/~eall/vjg/08part<wbr>iclewa/08particlewa.html</wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There are far better resources that are recommended over it, for one.</br>  <br>Japanese isn't Spanish.</br>   tfw can't learn Japanese anymore <br><br>I kept starting and stopping and now <br><br>I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter.<br><br>College is over and so is high school so there are no girls or bros to use it on.<br><br>It'd take me three fucking years to get decent at it. By then I'd be 25, which is essentially an old man</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Here's your reply.</br>  <br>If you spent the time you wasted on that post learning instead, yes you could learn Japanese.<br><br>"You miss 500% of the slam dunks you never take" - Albert Einstein</br></br></br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oNf<wbr>2BbLj5W0</wbr>  [ ]  <br><br>This is mostly wrong.<br>Some verbs can go either way like 落ちている 飲んでいる and it has nothing to do with when the state changes. It depends entirely on context.</br></br></br>  <br>it depends what you want to learn Japanese for.. like if you languages then why not keep at and have fun. If you want to know Japanese to one day live in japan then you should for sure keep trucking</br>  <br>Yes, exactly, conjugation isn't difficult. That was Tae Kim's point. That the rules you have to learn to conjugate to past tense are the most complex in the whole language, and they're not complex at all. It was an implicit comparison with other languages.<br><br>Nevermind, actually. This is a stupid discussion.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off with your blog.</br>  <br>I want to learn if so I'm not a monolingual degenerate and it seems easy enough to learn, but I can't stay motivated.

You're all wrong because it doesn't even make sense in Japanese. The two に particles are awkward as fuck. Apart from my good friends mom here who is still thinking about the sentence. However, she can stop doing that because its just bullshit. It's just made to trick people. Now if it were ～させた we would be talking. As  touched upon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I guess it gets harder then, but that doesn't deter me tbh.</br>  http://homepage3.nifty.com/park/asp<wbr>ect.htm<br>Here is a very interesting discussion about the various interpretations of ている.</br></wbr>  <br><br>Whats makes it bad, exactly?</br></br>  <br> I'm 22 and it's too late to learn a language and have it matter. <br>Isn't this a myth? I'm a business major and from what I've seen people will learn languages at any point if it means making more money via international partnerships. I'm talking people in their 30s and 40s.</br></br>  <br>So, it's like the complete opposite of what TK says?</br>  Aiming for N1 in December, but I feel like I have to improve my grammar quite a bit to make that happen. I've tried making grammar decks in Anki before but never managed to make one that works for me.<br><br>How does DJT use Anki to study grammar?</br></br>  <br>No it's absolutely 100% true, how could you think otherwise? Everyone knows that after you hit your mid 20s your brain turns into stone and is totally unable to learn new things. That's why everyone is totally justified in blaming their lack of learning on being "too old", it's clearly not an excuse in any way.</br>  <br>I don't.</br>  <br>Are you trolling, or?</br>  <br>well once you hit your mid twenties most people dont care about you anymore so it really does suck honestly</br>  <br>I'd post my autismbux.png if i was at home.<br>Where OP admits that he dreamed the sentence up and it didn't come from native media.<br>I fucking told him it's confusing as fuck even to a native.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I prefer to read native material while slowly go through grammar resources (JLPT textbooks, DOJG, Imabi, among others). If I need a grammar point clarified while I'm reading, I just refer to the DOJG or Google or this thread.</br>  <br>That's clearly sarcasm.</br>  <br>I wouldn't say he's right, but he's not entierly wrong either. This is always brought up in lingustic courses together with "language acquisition" and yada yada yada.</br>  <br>I grabbed the DOJG deck from the COR and went through it slowly, while still reading stuff in Japanese. That way I made sure I went through all the essentials, while still looking stuff up as needed when encountering them in "the wild"</br>  <br>It definitely is true to a certain extent.<br>Native Japanese speakers who wait until they're older to pick up English will almost always be unable to distinguish between Ls and Rs no matter how much they try.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that, and my friend told me she thought her Japanese was embarassingly bad for not understanding it at all. Heck even I didn't think about it being off and thought I could translate it.</br>  <br>Stop that shit, you want to turn this into DJT: Misinformation General</br>  <br> Yeah, the mom went on to say that no way in hell did a Japanese person write that <br>The authors of DOBJG sure did.</br></br>  <br>I got a copy of Rosetta stone for free so I started there for about three or so days. During those three, days I learned nothing about the fact that there are three different alphabets, nor did I learn about the many particles and grammar rules that make sentence structure so different from English. What I did learn, is how to say and read (but not right) Boy, plane, and "The dog is under the table" all of which btw only takes 3 mins to learn with anki flashcards.<br><br>So while there are many ways to go about learning Japanese, Rosetta Stone is not really an option unless you never want to reach fluency</br></br></br>  <br>Post the entire page.</br>  do not attempt to speak/write in kansai ben <br>You end up sounding like a stereotypical Chinese man speaking semi-broken English trying really hard to sound Southern</br>  <br>せやろか？</br>  <br>The whole L and R problem for Japanese speakers is true, and I've been Googling to see how age affects language learning ability, and as far as I can tell, it does get more difficult to become bilingual the older you get.</br>  <br>I'm practising for N1 aswell, I'm only studying with the Kanzen Master N1 grammar book right now.<br>1 lesson per day and there's 20 of them.<br><br>Nihongonomori is a good ressource too, it's somewhat easier when a person is explaining a grammar point sometimes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Someone correct me if I'm wrong<br><br>But I'm under the impression that that style of learning is only effective if you don't want to read/write japanese, only hear/speak it.<br><br>In other languages the two might be very closely correlated since you don't have thousands of characters to learn,<br>but it's completely ineffective if you ever plan on reading/writing it.<br><br>and most people in these threads care about reading japanese above all the other skills, so rosetta stone isn't a good option</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Please don't do this to me.

However if you're trying to build something on top of nothing it is going to be confusing at best and grossly inefficient at worse. We're not babies - we don't NEED to learn like them. Adults have the ability to think abstractly which is a powerful tool in helping to remember things (see mnemonics + comparisons), whereas babies / children pretty much HAVE to brute force memorize things via hearing them repeatedly.<br><br>I haven't used the program properly myself, so I can't comment on any specifics, so maybe look up some reviews yourself if you're interested for some reason.

Ungrammatical.</br></br>  <br>I've studied 1½ years at ECC language school in Osaka. Basically go out and drink with the teachers from time to time, I have them on Facebook. I've also worked in Japan for 5 months (which meant more drinking with old teachers), then I've also written my bachelors thesis, so I can always ask my old professors as well, however its a little bit late for that in Sweden right now.<br><br><br><br>9 yes, but not the (9), it's retared, even for Japanese people.</br></br></br></br></br>  In addition to studying kanji independently of vocab, should you also try to learn the kanji of the vocabulary words you learn, or should you just learn the words themselves and learn the kanji later?

Furthermore, in , (8) is completely different from (9) grammatically because in the former, 横に denotes a location, not another passive; thus, (8) makes sense whereas (9) does not.</br>  <br>For 2-3 days set your new cards to 0 and just review.</br>  <br>That one is a especially bad case because Aに電話する is a set expression that means "To call A on the telephone". That's why I said that  has two different uses of に in the same sentence. The first に is to mark the agent and the second に is part of the set expression. It's a bad choice of example sentence and just causes needless confusion.</br>  <br>彼は彼女に彼女の浮気相手に電話された<br>make sense.</br></br>  <br>It works for me.</br>  <br>Seems fine to me.</br>  <br>But I don't understand what purpose 彼女に serves in that sentence.</br>  <br>I think I'll do that actually. I'll have to look over more grammar as well.<br>Also, one thing I was wondering about;<br>Is there any resource that features an in-depth study of the various dialects? Or archaic Japanese.</br></br></br>  <br>Girlfriend as the "villain" like the image in  describes.</br>  <br>You're Japanese?</br>  <br> Is there any resource that features an in-depth study of the various dialects? Or archaic Japanese. <br>let's not get ahead of ourselves tiger</br></br>  <br>Okay. So your girlfriend is performing the action. The action being "you getting called by your girlfriend's lover"? What?</br>  <br>I'm just curious, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong by looking over the differences/evolution in time of the language.</br>  Sense scans out:<br>http://reader.sensescans.com/reader<wbr>/read/magi__labyrinth_of_magic/en/2<wbr>0/272/page/1<br><br>Is it over for Hakuryuu?</br></br></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>More than that, i think its more pointing out the flaws on the "good guys" idealistic reasoning. Hakuryuu telling Alibaba that perpetual fighting is useless, telling Aladdin to stop telling everyone how to live, the Kou´s who used the death of Hakutoku to gain power now getting into troubles, or people getting mad at Solomon for forgetting about all the souls trapped inside the black rukh. I dont think this manga will give a better answer than "do your best" about any of the subjects it talks about.</br>  <br>Nana-chan wouldn't have mocked him so much if there would have been such simple solution. But, even in that unlikely case, he clearly can't win this war alone. <br>It's time to make a bargain. <br>  Can you hear it? The sound of thousands magi jap readers screaming "Nihon! Banzai!" </br></br></br>  <br> I dont think this manga will give a better answer than "do your best" about any of the subjects it talks about. <br><br>So your saying that Magi will have a Naruto like ending?</br></br></br>  <br>It's actually the most typical shonen manga theme and "answer".</br>  <br>Yes, like it or not.</br>  Well then.  Ok.  This is nice<br> thanks</br>  When the Rin episode happens this board will implode.  This is arousing.  <br>8 minutes of ecchi power<br><br>Besides that i think i can really dig this show</br></br></br>  subs when  <br>That's all they need to promote the manga.<br><br>This is obviously designed to sell you on the manga.

They'll get rug burn on their dick if they keep going</br>  this is already happening in the first episode?<br><br>picked up</br></br>  <br>It is basically the same as the original manga.</br>  <br>Since the whole marriage thing seems a bit ridiculous from the start I can also have ridiculous hope that Rin will win right? Or at least a 3-way end? <br><br>r-right?</br></br></br>  <br>Which studio is this ?</br>  <br>Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced. At least in the newer chapters Hayato is aware of how cute, sexy, nice, and kind she is. She also has a good friendship and rivalry going on with Ui, where they help each other while trying to one up each other.<br><br>With that said, the manga is called "My Wife is Student Council President" not my "My Wife is the head of the Discipline Committee." So unless Nakata Yumi throws a huge ass curveball and Rin gets elected Student Council president, Rin will not win.</br></br></br>  <br> So unless Nakata Yumi throws a huge ass curveball and Rin gets elected Student Council president <br>Oh fuck that's hilarious. I could see an election arc as the finale  with the MC winning at the very end as tweest. </br></br>   The manga is over 1000 pages of cute high school wife shenanigans  <br>God bless Japan and how hard they cater to my dick.</br>  <br>What's he doing?</br>  <br><br>She got bit by a snake and he's sucking out the poison</br></br>  <br>Checking for lumps. Breast cancer isn't a fucking joke man.</br>  <br>Well, if they did that, it would be open ending where no one wins. It would actually be kind of funny because Hayato does the cooking, cleaning, and general housework, so he is actually kind of the wife in the relationship with Ui.<br><br> Though it wouldn't work with Rin since she is the one cooking and cleaning after her sister. Though she admits that Hayato is better than her in some ways <br><br><br>Sorry to disappoint you, but Rin becomes a main character and cockblocks Ui with a ton of her own fanservice.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> it would be open ending where no one wins <br>It could go both ways. Where he actually chooses one after he wins.</br></br>  <br>that looks way the fuck cuter than OP. Need to read this now for sure.</br>  <br>After being around Rin a lot he starts developing a huge attraction to big boobs. He also starts noticing her other qualities and that she isn't just a walking pair of big tits.<br><br>Which makes Rin like him more since behind his ogling, he actually cares about her.</br></br></br>  god if rin doesn't win i will kill myself<br>either that or her older sister</br>  <br>You know what? Good for this guy. It's rare we get a protag willing to suck on some available tits right out the gate.</br>  Picked up.  nigger the fuck aren't there subs yet<br>what is this shit</br>  <br>I was going to pick this up just based on the premise and initial synopsis, but this is a whole new level of adorable lewdness. Forget just picking this up, I might fucking BUY it.<br><br> captcha asks to select all images with cakes <br> itt </br></br></br></br>  <br>Wait for DDY if you don't want the streamrips that'll inevitably go up, though of course DDY doesn't have a translator assigned to this, it'll be a stream script edit with typesetting. RAWs are already up, so give it a day or two for them to work shit out and put their release out.</br>   all these people who aren't reading the manga <br>source material is usually always best so don't ignore it</br>  <br>Anon, I can't bury you over the internet.</br>  It's so sad that the one anime I've actually read the manga for before it's aired is a fucking ecchi.  <br>I can't wait for minamoto-kun monogatari good god that will be glorious</br>  <br>Looks like Rin has more fans than I thought. Here I expected to be the outlier. Like many, I started because of the antics of Ui and Hayato. When Rin appeared, I didn't like her, but after 40 chapters she is the only reason I still read the manga.</br>  <br> It's so sad <br><br>It's a nice thing to me.</br></br></br>  <br>That's getting an anime? Fuck me it's gonna need like a dozen seasons to cover that shit. Shit moves so fucking slowly.</br>  <br>Nigger, they've TL'd it already. <br><br><br><br>I've got one hand refreshing their website and the other lightly stroking my dick to keep it at half mast, waiting for the subs to come out.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>it doesn't have one yet. But I don't think it will be too long before it gets one</br>  <br> streamrips <br>It's one step short of uncensored hentai, neither CR nor Funi will have the balls to touch it. Only fansubs can save this show.</br></br>  <br>What is sad is that the crappy anime art doesn't touch the awesome manga art. Also, it is a 10 minute anime so it is clearly aimed to sell more manga, which is good side the manga sells poorly for such a good manga (in Japan)<br><br>The manga was close to getting cancelled, so this is nice.</br></br></br>  <br> 10 minute anime <br>fuck this shit<br>im out</br></br></br>  <br><br>newshit central</br></br>  <br>The manga is just so much better anyways.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this is not allowed on this board...</br>  <br>no nipples are visible faggot<br>areola don't count</br></br>  <br><br>It's 8 minutes.</br></br>  <br>the hype is dead</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127469355 <br>Okay, but one of their TLCs could have just agreed to TL it.<br>Fansubbing isn't some sort of professional job -- things can and do change at a whim all the time.<br><br>This is how the conversation likely went:<br>"Okay so a simulcast still isn't up.

Pretty standard yet bonerific romcom. Ui (I swear looks like Shinobu from Love Hina) and Misato are cute.<br><br><br><br>I did see nakata yumi's works on sadpanda. was this (http://exhentai.org/g/20217/94a4e5<wbr>fc16/) one an alternative version of the manga before the supposed revamp, a mistagged work, or something else I'm not catching</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not enough of them are translated.</br>  I feel like this sums up most reactions to this episode.  <br>Hah.<br>No.</br></br>  <br> Would you have kids with me, then </br>  <br> Hah. <br> No. </br></br>  <br> ;_; </br>  <br>Mori, how could you break an anon's heart like that.</br>  <br>Just scroll up, you'll see exactly how I did it.</br>  <br>Oh, I see. Thanks for explaining.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why is this so goddamn funny. Holy shit I can't stop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sorry Tyrone we will never see a proper Okusan series animated</br>  I can't believe people honestly prefer Rin to Ui. I'm not saying Rin is all that bad, but Ui is far cuter. Ui also feels like an actual character and not just generic tsundere #7586  <br>What I can't believe is people thinking Rin has any chance of winning only because she's the heroine rival.<br><br> Rin has more of a chance in Chapter 40 than she did when she was introduced <br><br>Of course, it's a fucking love triangle but in the end she'll lose. Hilarious.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ui also feels like an actual character <br>Like an early middleschooler maybe.</br></br>  <br>No wonder she;s into anal</br>  Reminder they will never ever fuck in the manga  <br>Do Japanese women like having fat asses?<br> slim figure <br> cute hair <br> cute face with/without make up <br> THICK FUCKING ASS  <br>I'm already dripping, too bad this doesn't exist unless she has a black parent or something</br></br></br></br></br></br>   subs never   <br>Please, we already know DameDesuYo is pretty bad but translating an 8 minutes show is still a challenge for any subber.</br>    <br>So, you're not going to watch it then?</br>  <br>Will DameDesuYo is actually going to do a timely release for this? <br><br>They still haven't released Anime de Wakaru Shinryounaika above episode 6 despite it's a 5 minutes show. Thankfully CR/HS exists for that show.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, they are pretty unreliable in terms of quality so I tend to avoid them but Anime de Wakaru was an editing/typesetting nightmare, which may be the reason why they ended up dropping it.<br><br>In any case, the anime will cover everything that's been scanlated so I guess you could read the manga and watch the raws.</br></br></br>  Where's the lactation  <br>This was actually the first show I watched raw. Felt weird and I barely caught half of what was said but it felt nice to see the start of the new season with everyone else.</br>  <br> dropping it. <br>They've always announced when they've dropped something.

If Rin wasn't around the series would have ended already. But yeah, it suck that Rin will lose and she will lose rather spectacularly after chapter 39's plot point about dead mom and secret childhood friends.<br><br><br>Yeah, I actually subscribe to Comic Rex, so I am pretty much caught up and I see nothing of the sort. Except the tons of Rin fanservice they had in Chapter 40.<br><br><br>If they do the one chapter an episode thing, she should appear in Episode 4</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  It's shit.  <br>2 days, anon.</br>  <br>Good lord</br>  <br><br>That anon is most likely mixing it up with the hand job.<br><br><br>Though I am surprised there is furigana in this series, I thought that was only used for non adult works.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>One day for me.

So the final manga will be raunchier than what I am seeing right now in Comic Rex.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What about Philippines?</br>  <br><br>Did you guys mix this up with his other work? Oku-sama wa Seito Kaichou?<br><br>Note: Not be confused with the later work with a slightly similar name.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Chapter?</br>  <br>Her, the author is female.

The context of the photo was from Chapter 40 of Okusama<br><br>Summary<br> <br>-It is Hayato's birthday, and Rin is at a loss of what to buy him<br>-She goes to her sister for advice, and her sister goes into a rant about how sex works, freaking out Rin.<br>-Rin sees Ui in the hallway, and Ui decides to help her buy Hayato's present<br>-Ui points out that Rin's greatest asset are her huge boobs<br>-So Ui forces Rin to the lingerie section and tries on Babydoll underwear<br>-Ui gets irritated that it looks so good on Rin and she tries some on too. It ends up being a disaster<br>-They both end up buying Hayato a shirt for his birthday<br>-He thanks Rin and Ui together, and Ui gets uncomfortable that Rin is getting closer to Hayato.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br> </br></br></br></br>  <br> Beautiful people can't be perverts <br>That's bullshit<br><br>Proof:  myself </br></br></br></br>  <br>Yup, Ui has big boobs (around E-Cup-ish), Rin has bigger boobs (G Cup)<br><br>The only reason why Ui looks small(er) is because she has Rin as her rival, when she really has big boobs herself.</br></br></br>  <br>Damn, I so want to feel my fingers sinking in them Rins</br>  <br>Oops, forgot to post pic.<br><br>Ui has big boobs too, Rin's just outclass her by 2 cup sizes.</br></br></br>  <br>was this on found on sukebe.nyaa?</br>  <br>Hayato did, and because of it he started getting obsessed with big boobs. To the disappointment of Ui who feels so inadequate next to Rin.<br><br> In volume 7 Rin and Ui find Hayato's porn collection on his computer, and to Ui's dismay, and to Rin's pleasure, they find that he has a big collection of porn featuring big breasted women. Since then Rin has been less shy and more aggressive in going after Hayato.<br><br>Which is why if you like Rin, the newer volumes is awesome because she gets a lot more fanservice.</br></br> </br></br></br>  how do we get this animation studio on a full episode ecchi?  <br>Call Xebec</br>  <br>Absolutely fantastic</br>  <br>Xebec are too damn scared to show nipple sucking as TLR proves. Call up Production IMS.</br>  <br>Yeah, so that's why even if Rin loses (almost certain), it is a great ride because Rin becomes a lot more aggressive and the series gets raunchier than the first couple of volumes.<br><br>Rin realizes that Hayato has feelings for her too, and so she uses her assets (big boobs) to her advantage when she can.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm not sure this is a series where they'll go for a single winner (if any)</br>  <br> Production IMS <br>Only if you want to wait months for the BDs to make anything visable.</br></br>  <br> wanting QUALITY <br>I haven't even watched Shinmai BDs yet, just don't think it's worth it.<br> That said I still like IMS because they did Twintails. </br></br></br>  <br>Someone should call PoRO to make animate and ecchi anime series.</br>  <br> TV anime with PoRoface <br><br>No thank you.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, Hayato is definitely has a thing for both Ui and Rin now. Ui notices that Rin is starting to get more attention from Hayato. Rin realizes that she has a lot of advantages with Hayato that Ui doesn't have. Rin is also a lot more aggressive in trying to go after Hayato.<br><br>So either having either a Ui or Rin end would be hard, since Rin has developed a huge following (pun intended) in Japan for the manga readers. There are also those who like Ui's personality more. <br><br>I see either a stalemate where no one wins. There is also the possibility where there could be two winners, since Rin and Ui have developed a good friendship, so "sharing" Hayato could be a possibility.</br></br></br></br></br>   Chapter 23 <br>Muh dick</br>  <br>Come on, the winner is basically spelled in the title.</br>  Cool Kids IV: Summer Adventures  <br>i can't stand sora, so the more wins shun chalks up against him the happier i'll be<br>i think i'm at the part where yuzu gets  taken , i hope my heart can handle yuya's reaction</br></br>   still not considered a cool kid   Sora will get carded by Ninjabro and Shun  post best soundtracks<br>https://<span>youtu.be/nkNEcTt5gMI?t=1m50<wbr>s</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br>I doubt Serena would want to be in a club without her boyfriend</br>  <br>Ruri~</br>  <br>WAVING THE FLAG OF REBELLION!<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=a0f<wbr>PvVyxWGs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Which one is better in bed, Serena or Yuzu?  <br>He spent all his coolness points for this season with that frying pan stunt.</br>  <br>Ruri~</br>  <br>Serena is shameless, she'd be up for doing whatever you ask. Yuzu would need more coaxing, cuddle her while she plushes and slowly spreads her legs, that kind of thing. Take your pick</br>  Could Yuya defeat our cosplaying overlords?  <br>Serena, mostly because if you fug her it stays a H-scene the whole way instead of turning into Attack of the Killer Tomato halfway through.</br>  <br>Shit now I really can't.</br>  <br>Is Yuzu in trouble?<br>If so , yes.<br>If no, maybe.</br></br></br>    <br><br>where are those fats came from?</br></br>  By some inconceivable means you have been transported into the Arc V world. You can only bring a deck you own in real life (if you are a poorfag then the deck you last played with online). This deck decides your alignment and obviously how strong you are.

If not Yuri, then maybe Dennis will do it. Shun carding Sora would seem too predictable and considering Shun didn't card the Obelisk Force back in episode 49, I doubt he'd card Sora if he wouldn't card them. Not even Serena carded the Obelisk Force.<br><br>Yuri carding Sora, who is a fellow Academia member, gives Yuya an even bigger reason to hate Yuri. After all, what kind of Fusion scum would card their Academia comrades without remorse? In Yuya's eyes, Yuri backstabbed his friends and as you know, betrayal is one of the most scumbag moves you can pull in YGO.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vylon Element Omega Turbo.<br>Mother of god, I'll brick every Duel, but then one day, Even god will shit himself at what will occur.<br>Long live Synchro, I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>I was playing trains.<br>And I still don't know if you can play fields in action duels.

Yuya never even gave a single shit about any dimension shenanigans. <br><br>Yuya may be the best or the worst mc in Yugioh existence.</br></br></br>  Teaching Yuzu how to drive episode when?  <br>I think he's the cutest, lovable tomato that you could ever have.</br>  <br>The last time he shed tears was when he thought Yuzu was DEAD. But I wouldn't be surprised if he's distracted during the exhibition duel because Reiji made him duel Jack instead of letting him run off into the slums.</br>    <br>It's going to be during the same episode where Crow or someone else teaches Yuya to drive.</br>   Yuya crying because of the thought of Yuzu being carded <br>Ow, my heart</br>  What's the name of the attack Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon uses?  <br>Nah, Yuya's going to instantly know how to Motorcycle because of his mom/because of the magical pendant.</br>  <br>Hangyaku no Lightning Disobey<br>I feel Chuuni for knowing this.</br></br>  <br>TREASON DISCHARGE</br>  <br>They have that autopilot shit so they probably don't need to teach much.</br>  <br>Trust me, You haven't felt true chunni til you've played duel network and had losers trying to act like anime characters. I've never learned to hate the phrase "THE FUN HAS JUST BEGUN!" as much as I did then. Oh, and let's not forget the dangerously chunnis who like to do summon chants.</br>  <br> THE FUN HAS JUST BEGUN <br> Bottomless <br> disconnect </br></br></br>  Anyone got good webms other than bruno/yusei fighting?<br><br>Those are the only YGO ones I have apart from shun wrecking those knight guys, I'd appreciate if anyone has other memorable scenes they could share</br></br>    <br> They try to be Reiji and activate two Covenants with the Infernal Gates first turn <br> They dont realize the IRL card is hard OPT </br></br>  Sawatari is so fucking cool  <br>We know Serena</br>  <br>I have a few</br>    D  <br> THE FUN HAS JUST BEGUN <br>The worst thing is when you then actually lose. It feels like one of those scenes where Yuuya beats some shitter and then does his entertainment gloating shit.</br></br>       Serena/Sawatari is getting pushed now <br><br>I'm so proud of some of you.</br></br>    <br><br><br>thanks, I was actually hoping for Halberd Cannon webms too. You wouldn't happen to have the first time Halberd Cannon negates SSD's eff would you?<br><br><br>poor hokuto</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool Kids are the NEET Cave Crew, so Reiji, Shun, Serena, Reira, and Sawatari.</br>  <br>Got to keep pushing til we get more cute art. Have the translated version</br>  <br>You got the translated version of the hair rustling one, I think it's the only one I don't have translated.</br>  <br>This one?</br>  <br><br>Sawatari we know it's you. Nobody actually finds you cool.</br></br>  <br>Yep that's the one, danke Anon.</br>  BERSERKER SOUL?  <br>No problem<br><br><br> Implying the undefeated duelist of Miami has time to post on /a/ </br></br></br></br>  <br>when he's not in entertainment mode he legitimately has the most "cool" personality</br>  <br>When I first tried DDD deck, that was such a huge disappointment. <br>It would make the pendulum focused build much better.<br>Still, recycling grave is more consistent and slime helps a fuck ton so I am satisfied.<br>And Kali Yuga is amazing to pull off every now and then</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Just not as good as me, you're still naive.</br></br>  How would the people of Arc V react to Kaiba showing up and normal summoning something like Blue Eyes?  Currently in the first three minutes of the Reiji vs Yuya duel, and all I can think of right now is  DDDDDDDDDDDDDD   <br>Hype, especially once he got Pendulum Summoning and started doing the most asinine shit in the world with his Blue Eyes. <br><br>Enjoy the duel.</br></br></br>  <br>good new support</br>  <br><br>ENJOY</br></br>  <br>Pissed. I already told you guys that the past protagonists should stay the fuck out of Arc-V. They had their light and Kaiba is going spotlight in a fucking MOVIE next year.</br>  What went wrong?  <br>Well Kaiba isn't the main protaginist.. He's the main rival like Jack and since we have Jack back it's possible. That said i agree, he has a movie. I doubt any DM characters will show up.</br>  <br>You do realize Kaiba showing up wasn't a suggestion, right?<br><br>Good characters showed up so we unfortunately had to spend more time with them</br></br></br>  <br>You mean that shit tier CGI? It was Konami continuing their attempts to cash in on common modern anime tropes in order to make Zexal more popular even though it was shit.</br>  <br>If any DM characters were going to show up it'd have happened during Academia's invasion of Standard and it'd likely have been Jonouchi so he can EGAO with Yuya. <br><br>At this point if we get any other characters it'll be Kaiser, Manjourne, or Edo for Fusion and that's it, and I don't see that happening honestly. But it may considering there is an uneven amount of duelists between the Lancers/Fusion.</br></br></br>  <br>Zexal had more budget due to the fact that there wasn't a movie eating into the budget like there is for Arc V. It sucks since Arc V is the better series and only the Ebina episodes and a few others have high quality animation.</br>  <br> No Chronos na no ne <br>Fuck you dude</br></br>  <br>Well I'm sure we might get Professor cameos with Chronos and Asuka. But I don't see them dueling.</br>  <br>DM characters will show up when they go to fight Ritual Yuya</br>  How many duels have you rost, /arc-v/?  <br>Like 2, but I haven't played in years and years. I'd definitely lose a lot more nowadays. <br><br>I've lost like 50 if we count video games, fucking Forbidden Memories and Tag Force trolling.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I think Arc-V spends its budget better</br></br>  <br><br>If there is a GX character showing up it's someone that has something to do with dimension fusion and shit, so maybe Yubel or Johann. But I don't think GX characters will show up at all.<br>If Arc-V runs parallel to 5D's the timeline should also be parallel so if a GX character would show up it would be an aged version of that character depending on how much time passed between GX and 5D's.</br></br></br>  <br>It'd be about 15-20 years after GX, since we have Ushio in 5Ds who was in DM in High School and had his name on GX as one of the citizens who got fucked in Domino City with Nightshroud. <br><br>Besides I think the only characters that remained at Academia were Asuka and the Professors. Everyone else fucked off I'm pretty sure, unless this is Supreme King territory and everyone else is dead and Judai/Yubel have fucked the Dimension over in this alternate timeline.<br><br>But I agree, I don't think GX characters are gonna show up, but I didn't think Jack/Crow would show up either, so who knows.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>With Jack and Crow works, because Synchro people really haven't been introduced until the story reached Synchro dimension and Synchro dimension might've purposely be kept outside of the story in the beginning because of that.<br><br>But Fusion Dimension and Xyz dimension have been introduced properly yet, we know their motives the big players of their dimensions are already introduced and we have no sign of characters of other series so I think it would be extremely weird if GX or ZeXal characters showed up.</br></br></br></br>  So new episodes when? I need to know who duels in the Fortune Cup  Is it wrong to ship Serena and Shun because she's technically like his sister? <br> Because if so I don't want to be right </br>  <br><br>Every Sunday</br></br>  <br>Yes it's wrong, you should be shipping the scary girl and the pompous guy, they're good foils.</br>  I really wanna know what Reiji is doing at this point, does he have a NEET cave to watch people in Synchro too already, and what the fuck are his Ninja doing outside of rescuing Reira?  <br>Summaries are next week, I guess. Most of the early tournament will probably be random filler duelists Jean sends to try and arrest Yugo and Yuzu.</br>  <br>I just want to see if Damon will use Kagetokage</br>  <br>I'll laugh if Jean just straight up arrests them. They enter the area and Secruity show up. Then again he's been too competent so far. He'll obviously mess up somewhere.</br>  DDDDDDDD  <br>this will be reji's archtype when the series ends.</br>  <br>Definitely Deadly Death Different Dimension Demon Dire Destructors?</br>  <br>No, Damn Demons Dying Differently During Dimension Danger</br>  <br>Spurdo shogan :DDDDDD</br>  <br> Those little santas on the table <br>I know they're Timegazer and Stargazer, but I can't not see Jack and Yusei</br></br>  <br>I see Judai and Jack more.</br>  <br>I wonder who's behind this post?</br>  <br>Benis :DDD</br>  I miss Yuto's first outfit.

The fuck.</br>    <br>I'm pretty sure the dude took it down and I dont know if anyone saved it<br> Its fine, it wasnt even shit in a cool, funny way; Clear Mind was way better </br></br>  <br>So is that screenshot at the bottom new? <br><br>It's weird, they usually don't use new screenshots in these magazine summaries.</br></br></br>  <br>Action Field: Really Comfy Bed?</br>  <br> I actually never knew that it was supposed to be a japanese culture pun and read up on Hanafuda after the Tokumatsu duel and the wiki trivia mentioned exactly this so I kind of felt the need to let other people knöw that I know this </br>  <br>Huh, we're really just skipping to the Friendship Cup.<br><br>Well, that's good. Maybe the plot's speed will actually pick up now.</br></br></br>  There is a part of me that keeps doubting Yuri is even a Yu, but I cannot think of a single reason that they would pull that twist. <br>His design just doesnt share a lot of the small quirks that the others have. (He's a more direct counterpart to Yuya though, while Yugo and Yuto have a lot of close-but-flipped design elements. I need to stop looking at pictures of Yuyas I'm losing my fucking mind.)</br>  <br> Huh, we're really just skipping to the Friendship Cup. <br>Well that's exactly what happened in 5D's. As soon as the prison arc was over we went to the Fortune Cup</br></br>  <br>It was more like it went down because of COPYRIGHT.<br>I just suddenly remembered about it. Thanks anyway.</br></br>  <br>But he is Joeri.</br>  <br> I need to stop looking at Yuyas </br>  <br>I can't handle all this symmetry.</br>  <br>Does that mean Yuya vs Yuzu, complete with BONDAGE?</br>  <br> looking at Yuyas <br> gay </br></br>  <br>Yuzu's getting thrown in jail. Jean Michel even said that he planned to do it. <br><br>Yuya will think Yugo is responsible, and thus, DRAGONS</br></br></br>  Is it just me or does Yuzu remind anyone else of a mouse? No idea why,  except for the cute factor I guess   <br>That would be hilarious but some bullshit will happen so she and Yugo can compete.</br>  <br><br><br> "Gentlemen, I inquire you all! Tonight, how many turns shall I spend in defeating him!?" <br><br> The King of all Duelists in the City. He declares that he would defeat Yuya in 3 turns...!? <br><br> "I... would be defeated in 3 turns!? <br> While he fails in escaping from the prison, he reunites with Reiji and co. As according to Reiji's plans, Yuya would participate in the Friendship Cup! <br><br>Everything was planned from the beginning</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So the cliche here is that Yuya lasts 4 turns, right?</br>  <br>I hope this doesn't mean Yuya is the only one competing<br><br>Besides Shun and Dennis, I REALLY want to see Gongenzaka even attempt to ride a D-Wheel<br><br>And Serena for a qt biking outfit</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That Red Wyvern has me scared that Jack won't even summon Red Dragon Archfiend Scar-right unless Yuya does in fact last 4 turns</br>  <br>Nah it's everyone. The whole point of this cup is more cards being shown.</br>  I'm getting pretty gay for Shun.   Tournament Arc <br> In Arc-V <br>RUH ROH</br></br>  <br>I think he'd accept anything if he gets his Ruri back</br>  <br>Seems like all Arc-V tournaments are destined to end in calamity<br><br>Fuck even that "Entertainment Duel Tournament" ended with a riot</br></br></br>  <br><br>FUSION SOON</br></br>  <br> Comparing CGI ED song to single appearance of a monster <br><br>Nigga you dumb?</br></br></br>  <br> There is a part of me that keeps doubting Yuri is even a Yu, <br>The writers don't need to TWEEST you like that</br></br>  Has there ever been a tournament arc in YGO that doesn't go horribly horribly wrong before it ends?  <br>Duel Monsters went smoothly</br>  <br>Well Mai and Jou almost died but yeah sure</br>  <br>Fortune Cup was pretty smooth as long as you werent unlucky enough to be matched against Aki</br>  <br>The World Championship from Zexal?<br>Technically things only went titsup AFTER Yuma won</br></br>  <br>It would be a shame if a certain someone showed up</br>  <br>Or dueled in the finale when a fucking dragon appeared and tore up the stadium</br>   Yuya is going to stall for 3 turns against Jack before Jack EGAOs at him lasting that long and then just destroys him on the 4th turn <br><br>There ya go, I spoiled the duel for you.</br></br>    <br> Duelist Kingdom and Battle City had shadow games and all sorts of shit left and right <br> Gran Prix even have Siegfried or whatever doing shit <br><br>Tournaments always either have bad shit going on or shit goes to hell at/towards the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Jack EGAOing at someone stalling <br>Nah if he's lasting three turns it's gonna be because he fights back with a burning soul</br></br>  <br>No, pls show up, I want to see Yuri's deck.</br>  <br>Arc-V tournaments are different, because for some reason in old Yu-Gi-Oh series the villains abide by tournament rules.<br><br>In Arc-V tournaments, shit just gets FUCKED UP</br></br></br>  <br>It's a disapproving smile, but Yuya will assume he smiled because he was having fun and start hassling Jack about it and they'll have a dynamic like Yuya/Crow over smiles/food.</br>  Everybody forgot the GenX tournament because it was so boring  <br><br>I don't think the Chojiro duel before was a coincidence. There Yuya also did the impossible and survived more than three turns against Chojiro.<br><br>So my guesses is Yuya pulls an infinite combo and it looks like Yuya is escaping the prognosis with everyone extremely shocked just like against Chojiro and it looks like he's gaining the upper hand but Jack activates a trap or a hand trap and wins anyway in three turns just as he said</br></br></br></br>  <br>Can't even count that as a tournament. Just a battle royale with a scavenger hunt theme to it. Literally no rules applied. The winner actually lost already and nobody knew.</br>  Lets assume Jack does end up losing a duel and it's not to Yuya or Reiji, who could possibly beat him based on their decks/cards from what we've seen?  <br>Gongenzaka<br> I maek Suasnoo discard Buster Gauntlet GG not even moved </br></br>  <br>I'm inspecting design elements though.<br><br>In fact doing the detailed analysis in a painting program is quickly becoming an illegible clusterfuck.<br><br>The thing that throws me off the most is that Yuri's hair is so damn symmetrical. <br><br><br>I think it's stupid too.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Gon's deck was basically made to job to Red Demon Dragon</br></br>  <br>Gon, Serena, and Shun. Serena is iffy just because we haven't really seen her deck though. <br><br>Gon and Shun could probably beat Jack though. Shun might have a hard time of it depending on what card he drew. Gon would be fine though.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yugo</br></br>  <br>Yugo<br><br>Clear Wing will make RDDSR his bitch</br></br></br>  <br> Gon <br>Yeah, uh, do you remember what Archfiend Dragon does, Anon?</br></br>  <br>And it super jobs to Scar-right.</br>  <br>Yugo, Clear Wing could push Jack, but pretty much nobody is beating Jack with his new Archfiend Calamity, Reiji might be the only one that could possibly do it and even then that is iffy.</br>  <br>But he doesn't have Red Dragon Archfied anymore, he has Scar-right, who's effect is entirely different</br>  <br><br>Yeah Scarright beats Gon even easier</br></br>  <br> Gon <br>Gon hasnt beat anyone important. He got wrecked by Yuya who'll be getting wrecked by Jack. Serena hasnt done shit either<br><br><br>Jack will be using Scarright, not vanilla RDDs. <br><br><br> Clear Wing could push Jack <br>But Red demons can just punch over it</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yugo is the only person that can do it. He's basically dense Yusei with a similar enough deck.</br>  Possibility for a Yuzu vs Dennis rematch here.<br><br>Though Dennis has yet to LIFT THE FACADE, so that could be trouble.</br></br>  In the SBR universe Joseph sent a T-rex Kars into space and we'll never see it.  why live? <br><br>http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87</br></br>    Post yfw David animates the Rohan Spin-offs as Part 4 specials.  You'll cowards are doing your part, right?  <br>That would be really nice but idk if they'd do it. I feel like it would be something they'd do during/after part 7 since the style isn't the same as part 4 and is way more serious.</br>  <br>I'm waiting for part 5 and 7.

You can find Killy's face on a page in NOISE as one of the children who had gone missing, but with Nihei's sameface you can't really tell.</br>  <br>Am I cyber, uguu?</br>  This isn't the accurate thread for this, but does anyone have the webm of this?  <br>I have to be honest for the first time , i didnt understood the end.<br>Call me a casual.</br></br>  <br>The sphere/net gene thing activated and started growing when they left the megastructure, because the outside world is uncorrupted.<br>No idea what "outside" is though, since the megastructure easily encompasses our solar system.</br></br>  <br>And after all these years I still don't understand why people don 't understand the ending.</br>  <br>Killy is nothing like that faggote</br>  <br>no, and you should consider kill yourself for liking it<br>the adaptation was dog shit</br></br>  <br><br>I like it that way. <br>It's fun reading Biomega after Blame and pretending the protagonists are the same person.</br></br></br>  <br>From my understanding the outside is space. Killy walked through the entire solar system until the megastructure ends. In the final chapter he ends up in a sort of swamp, the sphere activates and there are tiny lights above him. The lights above him are stars. He finally escaped.</br>  <br>stay mad. Nihei reuse concept and name all the time. Nagate is just Gakuen Killy, live in Biomega setting, but with more mecha</br>  <br>Oh my fucking god<br><br><br>Those fucking details. It's like there's such thing as 1080p HD manga.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too bad he dropped it for Sidonia.<br>Is the ink super expensive in japland or what.</br></br>  <br>From what I remember, he studied achitecture or worked as an architect and it shows.<br><br><br>He probably needed to make some money since Blame/Biomega are obscure compared to moeshit no.21513534</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying printing mango cost nothing <br>so this what Sidonia hater believe</br></br>  <br/>  <br>BLAME! finished well before Sidonia.<br>Unless you mean Biomega, that really was a mess in the end.</br></br>  <br> 1080p <br>Step-up anon. And brace for reprints.</br></br>  <br>He's talking about the art style anon, not the manga.</br>  <br> Blame! <br> reprints <br>WAT</br></br></br>  <br>How's life under the rock?</br>  <br>More like rock hard<br>Thanks for the info!</br></br>  <br>his style don't change much<br>still heavily on structure and static scene, but charater fuck less messup<br>Abara style was truely the best<br><br>you should lurk Sidonia thread sometime, the thread is shit, but they got lot of good information</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, I'm behind on both the manga and current events. Watching Gintama from the beginning is taking ages.</br>  Killy is a special agent sent by the Net. He is the same kind of creature as the Safeguard. He is not a human and he is not a cyborg either. Cyborgs are a specific type of living entities in the Blame! universe which are not the same as Safeguards. Cyborgs are bound by physical laws while the enigmatic Safeguards can be summoned out of thin air and have infinite energy. They are more like "programs". I say program because the world of Blame is a "cyberdungeon" where the internet is treated as a sort of magical dimension of infinite energy which has things like administrators. When the protagonists do meet an administrator in the story, albeit briefly, it explains that Killy is a pre-Safeguard model. Hence, the Safeguards became glitched and they fell on the pre-Safeguard backup.  <br> Abara style was truely the best <br>Fucking this. It was perfect.</br></br>  <br>But that's Digimortal.</br>  <br>What did Killy and Cibo do in the thousands of hours in the elevator?</br>  Thank god Nihei didn't become architect.  <br>You know exactly what they did.<br> card games </br></br>  <br>Yeah but he drew it around the same time.</br>  <br>Why is Sanakan best girl?</br>  <br>I don't they spent 250 years in that elevator. I think that was the amount of time between that Dhomo flashback and Killy and Cibo finishing their 800-hour elevator ride.</br>  <br>They  plugged  their  cables  together and  became one .</br>  <br>They had  a nap. </br>  <br> freaky meta-post-human sex </br>  <br>They spent only 800 hours in elevator, you idiot.</br>    <br>That's about 257 years.</br>  <br>what would he do if he was a architect?<br>drawn some bullshit concept, gone broke cause nobody want to hire him, and start drawing mango</br></br>  <br>i just always assumed he was synthetic parts but in a squishy meat like form. a fleshy like android with the personalty of someone long dead digitally stapled on to it.</br>  Tsutomu "fuck handrails" Nihei  <br>Handrails stand in the way of natural selection.</br>  <br>It's called silicon m8.</br>  Obligatory.  <br>he isn't Shaft</br>  <br>his next work confirned to be SOL gore fest</br>  <br> Nihei manga by Shaft </br>  <br>Worse than Kojima's child</br>  <br> what would he do if he was a architect? <br>He wanted to do manga around the age of 20 already, pretty sure that's way before he finished the university.</br></br>  <br>imagine Shaft adapt Blame Gakuen</br>  Can I abandon reality and wander the megastructure forever with the Oculus yet?  <br>You can pirate Naissancee, it straight up rips off some of the Blame! environments. Prepare for heavy breathing noises though.</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Soon<br><br>http://bac9.tumblr.com/<br><br> Just kidding, never. </br></br></br></br></br>  Did Killy even seek adventure?  He reminds me of Ichise.  So, what was Cibo?  <br>Only if it involves permadeath from creepy Safeguards lurking around the corners. No gravitational beam emitter.</br>  <br>Which Cibo? Corpse Cibo, Gravity Furnace Cibo, Motorcycle Cibo, or Bear Cibo?</br>  So, when does the Blame! animated special come out? I know its supposed to be included with the BDs, but I don't know which volume.  <br>A human engineer, then a rogue human engineer, then a human mind downloaded into a safeguard killing machine, then a human mind downloaded into her own body from an alternate timeline and then infected again by a high level safeguard downloaded by Davinulnevasffasdasdbluhblah which caused her to lose her mind and regress to infantillism and then she  became one  with  a girl  to donate her genes to create a sphere with the necessary components to give birth a human carrier with net terminal gene harvested from Seu's genetic information.</br>  <br>Are you too stupid to do simple math?</br>  <br>What does simple math have to do with divining knowledge I don't have?</br>  <br>Killy walking simulator-kun are you here?</br>  Killy was an extremely heavily modified human police authority who was issued the GBE with the intent that he would be able to succeed where all other possible legal authoritative actions had failed.<br>After wandering for thousands of years, his memories have greatly deteriorated, and he no longer remembers what Earth was. He does, however, still remember his mission in the vaguest terms. The Governing Agency appears and re-briefs him on his objectives every now and then, so as to ensure he does not completely lose track of his goals. He did not even recall that he was a modified human until the Safeguards injected him; thereby reactivating the mechanical functions that were dormant inside of him. <br>He has lost most semblances of human emotion due to the extensive absence of other humans and the sheer extent of time that he has been alive; but he does retain primal human emotional responses. He flies into a rage, smiling vindictively when he massacres the dock workers who were harvesting the organs of the native peoples. He expresses an unclear, but certainly present sentiment before killing Schiff. He flies into another rage after reviving from 14 years in a comatose state, encased in rock; shooting wildly with his extremely powerful gun in a display of dominance, survival and inadvertently his remaining humanity. He sheds a tear when Cibo and Sanakan die, in the most poignant and perhaps most obvious of his emotional signals. The last real human emotional response we see from Killy is the look of absolute exhaustion when he climbs into the level that was currently being built at the end of Volume 10. He claws his way up through a hole he blasted in the megastructure, and just lies down face-up in the pouring rain, unmoving for a time. <br>So yes, Killy was and is a human.</br></br></br>   It's time.   for what?  <br>Time to turn down for what.</br>    <br>Takumi is an angel.</br>  Suddenly Blue sky complex got updated. <br>Still cock-blocked.</br>  <br>Skrillex is a shit.

Should I start from the beginning or I can read from the chapters they covered in adaptation?</br>  <br>From the begin.</br>  <br>Beginning. The anime is way rushed.</br>  It's not even a .gif.  <br><br>Okay, thank you, homodachis.</br></br>  <br><br>I don't know why, I don't mind tits characters in Shokugeki.</br></br>  <br> dat Souma's soma </br>  Battle Lover Cerulean's birthday today(July 2)  Funny. I'm listening to the opening of Champloo right now.  <br>Blue was the best boy,</br>  <br>S2 never  ;_; </br>  <br>I dropped this long ago, but their designs are so much better than Starish/Quartet. I almost want to pick it back up.</br>  <br>Happy birthday best boy.</br>  <br>Just watch the last episode. It redeemed the whole season for me. And I agree, their designs are great.</br>  <br>For  peepees <br><br><br>Goddamn I love cute sleepy boys so much</br></br></br></br>  <br>He looks very fine.</br>  <br> Dat doujin </br>  <br>He looks like uglier makoto.</br>  <br>The time is always on time.</br>  <br>I wish there was more shota-on-big guy porn. It's so damn hot.</br>  <br>He looks nothing like Makoto. Get your eyes checked.</br>  <br>Dat cocks on the background.</br>  I thought fujo birthday parties were creepier, this seems really tame compared to those satanic cult gatherings.  <br>The decoration of the birthday parties depends on the hasbando's personality. Akashi deserves his red creepy cult. Haru needs something calmer.</br>  If you could make one hentai artist draw BL doujin who would it be?  <br>Tosh</br>  <br>TOSH.</br>   Episode 3 out <br>Akito is cute. It was also nice to see Lelouch suffering again.</br>  <br>I still think they didn't include Isshiki because Sakurai Takahiro cannot sing for some reason. It's a rumor though, but I heard this rumor that his agency doesn't let him do it.</br>    <br>Tone deaf Takahiro? That is interesting.</br>  <br> Rumor twice <br>I need to sleep better.<br><br>I think these are character CDs aren't they?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Why is Lelouch so thirsty? Will Suzaku ever give him his water?</br>  <br>I'm still in July 1st, celebrating my husbando's birthday. I'll congratulate Blue tomorrow.<br><br><br>That's really tame, most of the shrines I see around are an entire room filled with repeated merch. But the worst ones are those with 3DPD wearing the characters' masks.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Reminder that there's a juicy Tosh dick lurking in every SnS guy's pants.</br></br>  <br>I've heard about it around when Otome Youkai Zakuro was airing and every single pairing had them singing one ending but Sakurai was the only one who didn't do it.</br>  <br> his agency doesn't let him do it. <br>Sakurai Takahiro's agency is INTENTION, the agency created by his best friend Suzumura Kenichi. If he doesn't sing, it must be by choice.</br></br>  <br>I missed his voice.</br>  <br>Last time I heard Takahiro actually sing was for Shirokuma Cafe.</br>  <br>Didn't know about that. If that's true it's nice that he has this option since most seiyuus probably don't.</br>  <br>He sang a couple of covers in the Disney songs CDs<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d2R<wbr>3gXEVcks</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I remember those CDs. I also remember how everyone butchered all of the songs.</br>  <br>The agency is relatively recent, started a couple of years. The only members are Suzumura, Sakurai and Toyama Nao<br>http://intention-k.com/blog/2015/06<wbr>/</wbr></br></br>  <br><br>Aw shiet, so he can actually sing. I totally forgot about these Disney songs. <br><br>I don't remember much about Shirokuma, and I watched about 20 episodes of it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I had forgotten how shit Suzaku was.</br>  Let's discuss Jun  <br>But at least we got Spinzaku.</br>  <br>Prison School's mangaka, sweat is my fetish.</br>  Reminder that Makotofag and freefags are the cancer of these threads.  <br> You'll never suck Ishiki's cock </br>  <br>At least we can sweat together.</br>  <br>Even though s3 was horrible that was easily the best final episode moment of the season.</br>  <br><br><br><br>This, how is it even a question?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck  Souma <br>Marry  Takumi <br>Kill  myself when I can't have both. </br></br></br>  <br>I'd discuss him in my bed.

Add a large cast regardless of age and gender would be nice too, it just need actual individualism to make these characters separately quirky with multidimensional facets, but then that's just asking too much right now.</br></br>  <br> S5 never ;_; </br>  <br>I want to cuddle Killua.</br>  <br>Killuafags should be quarantined in /ghost/ with the Freefags.</br>  <br>What is best killua doujinshi?</br>  <br>Why anon?<br><br><br>Killua is so cuddly and adorable.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Because you insist on shitposting in every thread, and the others follow you instead of telling you to fuck off.</br>  Niuya draws the best Killuas.  <br>You ruin the HxH threads.</br>  <br>Pitoufags ruin HxH threads.

Tried google image search and iqdb but it didn't work.</br>  <br>Try the pixiv filename.</br>  <br><br>Sexual thoughts about pure, innocent Natsume are horrible.<br><br>I would never suggest removing his clothes and licking his tiny body all over, nibbling his neck and kissing her adorable little nipples. Only a heartless monster would think about his cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with his saliva, pumping in and out of his mouth until it erupts, the cum more than his little throat can swallow.<br><br>The idea of thick viscous semen overflowing, dribbling down his chin over his flat chest, his tiny hands scooping it all up and watching him absorb it off his fingertips is just horrible. You're all a bunch of sick perverts, thinking of spreading his smooth slender thighs, cock poised at the entrance to his pure, tight, virginal asshole, and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes his lips which are slippery with cum, while his small body shudders from having his anal virginity taken in one quick stroke.<br><br>I am even more disgusted at how you'd get even more excited as you lean over him, listening to his quickening breath, his girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes, his sweet pants warm and moist on your face and his flat chest, shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat, rising and falling to meet yours</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm using Safari right now, mind telling the title he comes from please?</br>  <br><br>It is truly nasty how you'd run your hands all over his tiny body while you violate him, feeling his nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick his chest, his neck and his armpits, savoring the scent of his skin and swear while he trembles from the stimulation and as he reaches his climax, hearing him cry out softly as he has his first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside him, pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through his freshly-deflowered ass for the first time, filling his ass only to spill out of him with a sickening squelch. And as you lie atop his flushed body, he murmurs breathlessly, "Y-You came so much inside of me, anon", then his fingers dig into your back as he feels your cock hardening inside him again.<br><br>You're all freaks. Natsume's too pure for anyone to imagine him in such a terrible situation, and anyone who does is evil, evil, evil.</br></br></br></br>  <br> her  <br>You messed it up, anon.</br></br>  http://makuranodanshi.com/#characte<wbr>r<br>Which pillow boy you would</br></wbr>  <br>  her <br><br>Next time, copy this horrible pasta better at least.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck there's saucenao for that.<br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=47347154</wbr></br></br>  <br>Violinfag</br>  <br>Violin or manlet.</br>  <br>Maybe eyepatch edge will be fun.</br>  <br>Feeling a bit sketchy about those character designs. 0/0 wudnt</br>    <br>I want to marry Killua!</br>  <br><br>She has some god-tier tastes</br></br>  <br>None of them, maybe chuuni for the lulz</br>  <br><br>I wish I could into twitter to check her artworks for good.</br></br>   genki Osaka boy doing bad attempt at being fashionable <br>10/10</br>  <br>Chuuni or twins</br>  <br>The five year old shota.</br>  <br>best boy</br>  <br><br>Yuuki Terumi / Hazama from blazblue.</br></br>  <br>I like how the Tanaka and Asahi crowballs have joined him in the bath.</br>  <br>Did she work on HQ?</br>  <br> http://makuranodanshi.com/#charact<wbr>er</wbr> <br> 41 year old mystery man. <br>Oh god, YES!</br></br></br>  <br>Megane or secret ojisan.</br>  <br><br>Thanks</br></br>    <br>Get this bizarre nippleless alien away from me.</br>  <br> not loving the Rimfire </br>  <br>My husbando wouldn't do that unless some sort of game is involved. <br>Maybe I can convince him that pounding his majestic cock into me is a really fun and engaging game.</br></br>  <br>Gladly.</br>  Why are thighs so tragically underrated?      <br>Thighs are wonderful and can't wait for HQ2 this fall.<br><br> obligatory Kuroo </br></br></br>  <br> boueibu s <br>I miss them so much.</br></br>  <br><br>The megane librarian giraffe.

Not sure about K Season 2 though,</br>  <br>Hoping either Commie or Asenshi will pick up K again.</br>  <br>Right here you can see the "su" in "Suwabe."</br>  <br>I really do hope so anon.</br>  <br/>  <br>There was no visible QUALITY in this episode. And even if there was, it didn't stand out.</br>  Anyone staying on the ride?  <br>I most likely am</br>  <br>Shit, its out already?</br>  <br> tfw no deaf manlet bf <br> tfw you will never be one of Worick's clients <br><br>Why live, they're both so great</br></br></br></br>  <br>How is it now?</br>  <br>As much as I'm still not feeling the overall look of it, that is still a marked improvement.</br>  <br>Give him hair mandibles like those that erina has.</br>  <br> Who is he? </br>  <br>Good amount of homolust in this one.<br>Or as the original author called it, "homosocial".</br></br>  <br>Reminds me of that faggy kid from Free</br>  <br>Bowlcut still looks awful.</br>  <br>Now fix his ears.</br>  <br>Better anon.<br>But not much you can do anon, thanks for the effort.</br></br>  <br>Thank you anon who gave me the news.<br>I really appreciate it.</br></br>  I thought this was a girl until I saw the pants.<br>Then I remembered this is the anime with the mostly may cast.</br>  <br>Bowlcut is god's gift. Those characters are just ugly anyway.</br>  <br> Implying that fag wasn't ugly as well </br>  <br>Sazaki a shit. A SHIT.</br>    all still creaming yourselves over Harada <br><br>(The one where Hijikata gets fucked in a wall is okay. Still makes me want to remove Gintoki from my brain though)</br></br>    <br>Ugliness can be cute</br>  So today we've had a kinda homo gangster show and a homo trainwreck by Seiji Kishi.<br>Noice.</br>  <br>Mienai Kusari is a masterpiece. Even it's kinda hard to see my husbando so psychotic.</br>  <br> But does he know the taste of love? <br>now he's perfect for Aquarion.</br></br>  <br>From the thumbnail I thought those were manly Nagai style sideburns</br>  <br>Add this kind of thing too.</br>  <br>It was really hard man. And not a single hand went near my dick after that doujin.</br>  That kind of haircut fits Midousuji, it makes him cuter.  <br> Scans are dead because the tumblrcunt doing them won't translate a licensed series <br> even though Yen press has 29 fucking volumes (aka about 8 years of releases) to catch up <br>Kill me</br></br></br>    <br>We must wait for season 3.</br>  <br>This was shit until Kisumi</br>    <br>The same can be said of many things.</br>  <br> being this gay </br>  <br>I only read that one Kissme doujin.</br>  <br> Funi <br>Guess I have to wait then.</br></br>  <br>Do you think we'll get a season 3?</br>  <br>To be honest, yes eventually. There definitely is enough material. And the anime has a slow as fuck pace anyway, so they could stretch it out if they must.</br>  <br>Depends on JUMP, maybe if they feel the sales have gone down to the point a boost by anime is worth it or if they have stuff to sell.</br>  <br> makofags </br>  <br> Yowamushi <br> Jump <br>Fuck off retard</br></br></br>  <br>I do, considering what a massive hit it is in Japan, well first we need to wait for the movie.<br><br><br>Yowapeda isn't JUMP series, not even Shueisha</br></br></br></br>  <br>The recap movie made a lot of money too, so yes.</br>  07d, 03h, 46m until Lerche disappoints us.  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br><br>Stop instigating fanbase wars you shitter.</br></br>  <br>I don't know, I'm almost sure those gradient silhouettes made for some issues in production.   That said I want all three shows to look good but if I had to pick one to have budget issues it'd be Laplace. </br>  <br>Yeah. Laplace is a three episode rule pick up at the start of the season kind of anime, not an anticipated while reading the manga for years kind of anime, for me at least. It's unfortunate, but both GG and MMniN fall under that latter one. Really, I'd rather give Gakkou Gurashi the most budget, even if it means shittily animated monstergirls, just because GG has so many emotionally charged scenes that would be extremely easy to fuck up.</br>  <br> The Kancolle anime still sold a lot. <br>This is why Touhou is in a state of recline.</br></br>  Bleach 633  <br>Well fuck me sideways<br><br>Also I feel you B. When Jesus tells you you were shit all along that's gotta hurt. Especially when your BFF joins and loyally follows the guy you vowed to kill.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Anyone who was here before nurutu-posting was allowed knows what happened.</br></br>  <br>When did they turn gay?</br>  <br>They were born gay. Molded by it. They didn't see the straight until they were already women, and by then it was nothing to them but BLINDING!<br><br> What should I have changed "blinding" too? </br></br></br>  <br>Probably.<br>He just didn't give a shit.</br></br>  so, is it shit?  I bet the MCs wouldn't tap the whore even after she joined them on condition as their personal cumdump.  <br>Nah, basically a less inventive Black Lagoon.</br>  why so short  <br> Not dripping cum <br>I'm hoping the BDs fix that.</br></br>    ITT: Worst girls in their respective series  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Suicide immediately.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Of course there isn't.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Really?<br>I found Rin worse</br></br>  spats &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pantsu  Nigga, u gay.  <br>Depends, but overall I like panties much more</br>  <br>Inb4 diaperfags</br>  spats &gt; bloomers &gt; nopan &gt; pantsu</blockquote>]
