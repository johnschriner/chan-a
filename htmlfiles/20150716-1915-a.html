[ Only one day left now and remember Hibiki is not a hero.  <br>the gx character albums released so far</br>  <br><br>Not as good as season 2's "bang!"</br></br>  <br><br>Cheers guys.</br></br>  <br>Its going to take me years but some day I will get those high notes.</br>  <br>I'll admit it makes no difference with my computer speakers, but on occasion I use the nice sound system in the living room and the FLAC versions are noticeably better-sounding than high-bitrate MP3.<br><br> I also have really nice headphones </br></br></br>  This is Akane's ass.  <br>Akane isn't even 25 yet.</br>  Why are there no good doujins of Psycho Pass?<br><br>It's torture.</br></br>  <br><br> akane <br> it's not from ranma <br><br>fucking underagefags all of ye</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Long Akane is long</br>  <br>good file name</br>  Ask a guy who just watched all of Oreimo with his sister anything.    <br>honestly she would just laugh her ass off</br>  <br> I've been on /ag for 2-3 years </br>  <br>I've never been on /ag, anon</br>  <br> IDK what that is <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=9nc<wbr>HcD8fI98</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Who the fuck uses a flip phone to record a video?  <br>She is just practicing flirting for Hayama's sake. I wish people would stop misconstruing her intentions.</br>  <br><br>Hayato shit</br></br>  <br>I imagine that the baby making and kissing would also be for Hayama's sake. 8man is such a bro.</br>  <br> he realizes what Yui and Yukino already know, <br>Both of them know that shit?</br></br>  <br> he still doesn't know Yukino likes him. <br>I'm pretty sure he knew in volume 11.<br>He is just in denial about it, like he did with Yui.</br></br></br>  1.Charlotte<br>2.WORKING!!!<br>3.GATE 自衛隊 彼の地にて、斯く戦えり<br>4.ClassroomCrisis<br>5.下ネタという概念が存在しない退屈な世界<br>6.がっこうぐらし<br>7.のんのんびより りぴーと<br>8.城下町のダンデライオン<br>9.六花の勇者<br>10.それが声優！<br>11.干物妹！うまるちゃん<br>12.乱歩奇譚 Game of Laplace<br>13.赤髪の白雪姫<br>14.うしおととら(TVシリーズ)<br>15.モンスター娘のいる日常<br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128152836#p128152836">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Yuki-chan doing really well in rankings <br>What?</br></br>  <br>Shut up, nigger. <br><br>Thought Tora would be higher, thought it had a pretty significant cult following in Japan. And GATE is fucking terrible.</br></br></br>  <br>It's on the rank 33.</br>  <br> And GATE is fucking terrible. <br>As an adaptation, or on its own terms? I'm mixed on how slowly it's developing, in the sense that it's filling in parts from before the manga. Having Tuka and Rory will help a lot next episode.</br></br>  <br> cult following <br>That's just one way of saying unpopular.</br></br>   ZANKOOOKU NA TENSHI NO THESE <br>This week we got Rumba, what song do you think they'll cover the next episode?<br> Who will be the next famous seiyuu to appear? <br>https://d.maxfile.ro/zzlgwdfjym.web<wbr>m<br> REMIX OST WHEN? </br></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>Agreed. Otherwise, we're no better than those normalfags and their celebrity worship.</br>  <br>Pretty much. <br><br>In my opinion if you want to follow her or whatever you can do so but there's no need to make posts about it on /a/. It'll eventually draw unwanted attention.</br></br></br>  <br>Starting a thread with that is a retarded idea, this board of full of immature idiots. <br>Recently someone posted a link to Tsugumomo's mangaka streaming and and everybody started spamming his chat with stupid shit, it was embarrassing.</br></br>  <br>This. Even if your intentions are good, you have to remember that a third of the board also browses /v/.</br>  <br>I'm the one that originally posted her and I kinda agree with this but at the same time, am saddened because she lacks any exposure and is a genuinely nice person who should be recognized for her efforts. 4chan probably wasn't the best place to post her twitter but I don't browse any other social sites. <br><br>Seems one of her friends is convincing Ichigo to set up an oversea shop, so I'll support her by paying for her music instead of pirating it.</br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking questions<br><br>buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br><br>What's with all those shitty grainy pictures? Are there no good ones?</br></br>  <br>I like me some boats<br> Re is cutest </br></br>    <br><br><br><br>they're GKs so don't even bother getting your hopes up</br></br></br></br>  <br>Dammit</br>  Why was the last thread deleted?<br><br>Anyways<br><br>Whose next nakama and why is it pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>That's the Reddit idea of community. Keep it 4chan ON 4chan.</br>  <br>If you cant see through these fake ass sob stories then you probably dont belong here. Go to Reddit and be around other fake people.</br>  <br><br>Wow, being hostile and edgy makes you look *sooooo* mature /s</br></br>  <br>How is "but kings face is not shown" = Garp fucked his mother/sister/him-before-ivankov?</br>  Are you excited for season 2 /a/?<br>I hope best girl wins.</br>  <br>Yeah. Pretty much every LN girl with a manga spin-off loses in the main series.<br><br> Biribiri <br> Kuroneko <br> Eriri <br> Utaha <br> Charlotte <br> Sena <br> Ai (Oreshura) <br><br>Off the top of my head.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> I hope best girl wins <br>There's no other way.</br></br>  A shitty harem show gets a second season, ain that swell.  <br>They did try to a lot of time and get back to old style due to "m-muh embarrassment"<br>Only read the spoilers so I wouldn't conclude for this one 1st <br>But wait, will they keep this up for real?</br></br></br>  <br>What's Charlotte from?</br>  Just finished Lain. Pic related.<br><br>Also Lain general I guess</br></br>  I still don't seem to understand  <br>a shame you seemed an honest man</br>  I just finished rewatching it a second time, and the one thing I still don't understand is what the fuck happened to the onee-chan.  <br>I was under the impression she was 'hacked' to get to Lain (all that FULFILL THE PROPHECY stuff being forced into her reality) but it ended up breaking her rather than influencing her behavior as intended<br><br>but I marathoned Lain in one night for the first time a week ago so I'm far from an informed expert</br></br></br>  <br>How many ''just finished lain'' threads you gonna make?</br>  Not only is the the most overhyped Anime of the 2010s, it's probably the most overhyped Anime of all time.<br><br>Who the fuck likes this garbage? /a/,MAL,and Crunchyroll that's who.<br><br>Watch more Anime kids.</br></br></br></br>  <br>There are very specific times when the anime doesn't compare to the source material.<br><br>Steins;Gate and Chaos;Head are two prime examples.<br><br>Granted, the S;G show is not bad. The VN just goes much more in depth, characterization and art styles are greatly improved. Things are also explained better and plot holes that appear in the show do not show up in the VN, or are resolved.<br><br>I'm not going to bother explaining why the C;H show is awful. <br><br>So the S;G anime was good, I liked it, nothing special, my roommate made me watch it after I found out my GF cheated on me, made me feel better, good show.<br><br>Played the VN, and the series immediately jumped to my top 5 list. <br><br>So in this particular instance, the people who have only seen the show aren't terribly wrong, they're just missing out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Steins;Gate is a prime example of the fedora-core reddit-tier harem sensibilities. It's nothing but meme trash.  <br> Fedora-core, Reddit-tier, harem, sensibilities, meme <br><br>Pack in more buzzwords, people will surely fall for it then.</br></br></br>   &gt;TFW I'm just arguing with shitposters as an excuse to image dump, and there's nothing you can do about it.   <br>Buzzword is my favorite buzzword.</br>  I really don't get /a/'s hatred towards Crunchy Roll. I'm able to get 1080p newly aired shows with SUBS the day after they came out. Why is CrunchyRoll frowned upon here when /tv/ actively advocates use of Netflix? I just don't get it. <br><br>Where else am I able to get quality anime streams on my Wii U? And most importantly its not like they overcharge for the product. <br><br>And the subs on CrunchRoll are almost always better than fantranslated. Sorry but it's just the truth so that alone makes it a superior product than torrents.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br>Desperate for? I'm not the one on a hate filled vendetta agaisnt a service and antagonize its users.</br></br>   mfw all those retards who shit on CR/Funi 1080p <br>Do you even know that 14 of 33 shows this season have a resolution higher than 1280x720?<br>Do you know that Funi's 1080p is okay-tier but Funi's 720p is shit-tier (when they don't shit the IVTC)?<br>Also if you don't setup your video player, you're the same trash than the ones who stream their anime.</br></br></br>  <br>There are no legitimate objections being raised here.<br>CR and Funi are terrible. End of discussion.</br></br>    http://pastebin.com/qzDMjL87  <br>Depends on what you're cropping.<br>Generally speaking, put a transparency layer under the image, try a magic wand and if that works, great, if not, zoom in and use the eraser.<br><br>You can do that kind of shit with any skill level. There are other ways of doing it too.</br></br></br></br>  <br>WHAT</br>  <br>can't crash me holeboy</br>  <br>How does a 3 mb image crash anyone, are you on a 15 year old PC</br>  <br>The only penetration Kekyoin ever experienced was The World's fist.</br>  http://yaraon-blog.com/archives/661<wbr>91#more<br><br>http://www.production-ace.co.jp/kid<wbr>s/<br><br> Kadokawa joined with Amusement Media Academy (Production Ace) to open a voice acting school for elementary &amp; junior high school student.

If so, I fucking love her even more.</br>    <br>That glasses fetish though.</br>  <br>Please god tell me that shirt doesn't say "HAMBURGER"</br>    Previous thread: <br><br>ISHUHUI'S OUT EARLY.
