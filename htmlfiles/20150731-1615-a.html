[ So what exactly is a post-evangelion biter?  you're favorite anime  <br>Forced pandering.</br>  People who only watch mature anime for mature anime viewers such as themselves.  No idea but Kirino best girl.  <br>Kirino best girl when paired with Kyousuke. <br> I guess she's insulting them because they didn't like anime before eva? Like people who shit on old anime. </br></br>  <br>That sounds more descriptive of Kirino than Kusoneko, though.</br>  <br>But why is she so perfect, /a/?</br>  <br>Why? Kirino likes anime with cute girls so probably mahou shoujo and SoL. She's more into VNs anyway. Maybe she said that because Kuroneko is into overly deep anime and people consider Eva really deep.</br>  <br><br>2nd best girl mentioned Evangelion and I missed it, damn.</br></br>   little kids calling each other out for being newfags and casuals <br>she would fit right in on /a/</br>  <br><br> implying she isn't already shitposting anonymously </br></br>  <br> uses buzzwords  <br> comes over as pretentious <br> other person calls her out for liking moeshit, while also coming over as pretentious  <br>Wow it's like I'm on /a/</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is Kirino the type of girl to shitpost?</br>  <br>Weird, I know. It's almost like it was intentionally designed to mimic the typical anime fans' "discussion" or something.</br>  <br><br>imagine her going rampant in a Maschera thread or if someone insults Meruru</br></br>  <br>I think Neko's taste in anime is shit.</br>  <br><br>she's a teenage girl, what do you expect? magical girls are even worse</br></br>  <br>Idunno; from what we see of it her favorite show looks like it has some nice atmosphere.</br>   biter <br><br>Context check.</br></br>   Mods keep deleting imouto threads <br>Hell, the last one only had a little blogshit, so what the fuck</br>  <br>The one yesterday was really blog heavy.</br>  <br>There was only one blogshitter by the time i left, and people were yelling at him. I assume it got worse?</br>  <br>Kinda, 2 anons were greentexting stories and the blogging was really dominating the thread. The ironic thing is that it got deleted when the blogging ceased.</br>  reminder that incest is wrong and you're all sick fucks  <br>Kozue, pls go and stay go</br>  <br>Nah, incest is aight. 8/10 would recommend.</br>  <br><br>"Post Evangelion (Ankle)biter"<br><br>She's insulting her opponent's maturity/age.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Archive links?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would it even be in the archives if it was pruned?</br>  <br>It was named something like "nothing wrong with washing your sisters back".<br><br><br>Yes, even the deleted posts in a normal thread are in the archieve.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seems like it defeats the purpose of deleting it, but whatever. Sorabutt</br>  <br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128777<wbr>116/#q128777116</wbr></br>  <br> All that blogshit <br>Jesus christ, i'm glad I went to bed. It got worse</br></br>  <br>Eh, I like blogshit. I miss Imouto threads that were nothing but blogshit.</br>  <br>Maybe, but blogshit these days just gets the thread deleted.</br>  <br>The way they were speaking gave the impression there was more than one thread.</br>  <br> biter <br>Term that people born in 70's/80's use as a derogatory term for copycat.</br></br>  Kirino = poor man's Asuka  <br>Last time I checked, Kirino wasn't mentally unstable. <br> Unless you count that ONE time </br></br>  <br>When she fell in love with her brother?</br>  <br>That doesn't count. Kyousuke is based as fuck, who wouldn't fall for him? no homo</br>  <br>That's not mentally unstable, that her lacking the notion that falling in love with your siblings is wrong.</br>  <br>Not that wrong. Just, y'know, wear a condom.</br>  <br>And refuse her the wonders of motherhood? Balls on that idea</br>  <br>What, no<br> vlcsnap <br>?<br><br>/a/ I am disappoint.</br></br></br></br></br>  It's amazing how pure a love can be, even when he is twice her height and almost twice her age. <br> hamster-eating-banana.png </br>  <br>That never happened.</br>  <br>Says you, shitskin</br>  <br>They pussied out, though. "We'll have a fake wedding and then never speak of this again".</br>  <br>0/10</br>  <br>But I've always found it interesting how for a straight haired character the number one thing they go for to show her age is that they make her hair slightly wavier.</br>  <br> Not reading the LN <br> Not realizing that they more than likely continued their relationship <br>You stupid or something, son?</br></br></br>  <br>"I guess so. I wrote so that it would have scenes that felt like those in volume 1. With Dengeki Bunko [Fushimi's publisher], it was very difficult to write a thrilling story in which they settle everything and head down a forbidden path. I was sure I would give Kirino a happy ending, so I did my best to set up as good a situation for her as possible, for the sake of her future. I found it very difficult to do so. It ended up the way you read it [in volume 12], but if I were to add a few unnecessary comments for those readers who are reading it for a second time, I would say:<br><br>"A Completely Kirino Ending"<br><br>"The story ends with the two siblings sharing a secret, the same way their first life-advice-talk [jinsei soudan] began."<br><br>That's basically what volume 12 was about."<br><br><br>"In the main story [as contrasted with the PSP game], I couldn't write an ending where Kirino's affection is truly and entirely rewarded. Various circumstances prevented me from plainly writing that sort of ending. Nonetheless, I realized that she cared deeply for [Kyousuke], and so I felt I had to do something for her." <br><br>I am here to ruin your dreams.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  You need to uphold your moral values, sick bunch of degenerates.   New Kirino doujinshi when?   Kirino is a super cutie.<br><br>This is my contribution to the thread.</br></br>  <br>All this shows is that he couldn't go whole hog on a kirino ending, but it is still shown quite clearly that they still love each other, and it is more than likely that they continued with "Life Counseling", but in a different way.<br>0/10<br><br>You lost, you fucking lunatic, go home</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eh, "I'm going to fuck my sister every once in a while" doesn't sound like a way to live your life.</br>  <br>Manami pls</br>  <br>But there is nothing purer than the love between an imouto and her protective onii-chan, dummy</br>  <br>Agreed. It just feels like a bit of a hollow non-victory.</br>  <br> imouto wins the onii-chan <br> non victory <br>U wot</br></br></br>  <br>The lack of new Kirino doujins is the biggest loss of Oreimo ending</br>  <br>Ok. Half victory, then.</br>    <br> half victory <br> they still love each other <br> no other girls in the way <br>Kirino won, without question. And there is no way they didn't continue their relationship, if the ending is anything to go by</br></br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, m8. I want to believe that... I just sort of don't.</br>  <br>You're just subtly baiting, aren't you? Just read the After Story and the interview that has been posted in this thread.</br>  <br>Personally, i like the Way Hoshikuzu Namida is portraying what happens after the ending. They keep fugging, but get busted and seperated, and probably elope later in life</br>  <br>Huh. I didn't know about the after story. How sweet, that makes me feel better.</br>  <br>I think they'd just elope immediately if pushed. Their parents would probably cool off in a couple years of not having any contact with them.</br>  <br>The hentai guy?</br>  <br>Yes, the Hoshikuzu Namida hentai. Its realistic, its cute, and waiting for chapter 5 is fucking killing me</br>  <br>Praise Jesus.</br>  <br>I have those in my collection, but I don't actually read most hentais so I dunno what the fuck happens in 'em. Might read 'em later today. Like, actually read them.</br>  <br>I think they would wait for Kirino to graduate high school first. By then, her nest egg would be big enough to support them both for a while, while they look for jobs</br>  <br>Greatest victory.</br>  <br>Apparently 4 ends on a huge cliffhanger, that's why I haven't read it, I'll wait until the final chapter is out. Just read the first 2, they are by far the best Oreimo doujins.</br>  <br>Well, Kirino already has a job. A fairly well paid one at that.</br>  <br>Well if they were able to coordinate that they'd never really be separated</br>  <br>... Don't. I read it and it just broke my fucking heart. Wait for five.</br>  <br>Obviously they wouldnt be living in the same house, and Kirino would be restricted in her activities, out of fear of them gettibg back together. But she would probably get him a computer or something so they can talk</br>  <br>Restricting their activities in any meaningful way would be pretty much impossible without pushing it to the point where they just decide to leave. Kirino and Kyousuke are very stubborn.</br>  <br>Kirino breaks under her father's pressure very easily, though.</br>    <br>Just that one time because she felt alone. I don't think she'd back down knowing Kyousuke was with her.</br>  <br>I dont think Kyousuke would want to be dependant on her, so he would probably work anyway. <br>and buy her ring with his own money</br></br>  <br><br> Low powerlevelfags mad that little girls know more about anime and have better taste than them <br>Yeah, I guess she really is /a/. You guys should go back to /v/.</br></br></br>  <br>Not at all. At first he didn't allow her to model and then he didn't allow her to wear trendy clothes in public but she argued and made a deal that she's allowed to if she keeps up her good grades. She didn't even give in after he found her otaku stash, though she couldn't handle it on her own. I think without Kyousuke there would have been no way for her to actually keep her collection.</br>  <br>There's a mod who thinks they know how /a/ works and thinks they're helping by deleting everything from imouto/neesan threads to fucking animation discussion threads.</br>  <br>le epic meme subs</br>  <br>Idiot.</br>  <br>Overall doujins were so fun.</br>  <br>checked</br>  <br>Trips speak the truth.</br>  Best harem in anime.  <br>Not really a harem, yes there were 5 love interests but 3 didn't really stand a chance at all and the story itself had very few harem elements.</br>  <br>Kuro, Aya and Kiri?</br>  <br>Manami was family-zoned since the very beginning, Ayase "hated" him for the first 8 or so volumes and then Kyousuke was already completely in love with Kirino and Kanako was silly anyway, her confession didn't make much sense.</br>  <br>Kuroneko and Kirino were the only ones with a legitamate chance</br>  <br>It was like EMS. Only the imouto had a chance. As it should be.</br>  <br>Yeah, I didn't get Kanako's seemed like it only came at the end to put more rejections in.</br>  <br>She had more scenes with him in the novels but it was mostly him doing something for her as her manager which doesn't really count as romantic development. In volume 10, the harem volume, she got a bit more focus but it was strange too, she went from bratty/arrogant with a kind side to completely dere in almost no time and then randomly confessed to him in I think it was volume 12. It was speculated that Fushimi did it to advertise the psp games but we'll never know for sure.</br>  <br>Kirino is old and busted. This qt is the new hotness.</br>  <br> old and busted <br>Kirino had the body of a goddess at 14. Imagine her at 21</br></br>  i want to bury my face in kirino's ass and make her feel good  <br>No kidding. If my sister looked like Kirino I'd be on her all the time.</br>  <br>Too old. So old it's like it doesn't even matter that she's an imouto. She may as well be a filthy onee-san at that point.</br>  <br> filthy onee-san <br>I will fucking cut you, nigger</br></br>  How to get a wife sister like Kirino?  <br>The appeal is the juxtaposition of a beautiful maturing women still behaving like your precious imouto</br>  <br> implying age matters in a loving relationship <br> hating on onee-sans <br> being a nigger </br></br></br>  <br> older Kirino <br>Fucking glorious</br></br>  <br>It's a Karen Araragi recolour, mate.</br>  <br> ruining my dreams <br>Cunt, now i can only see Karen, and not glorious older Kirino</br></br>  <br>There's more changed than just the color, but it doesn't really matter anyway. If the intention it to portray Kirino and it looks like Kirino then it's Kirino.</br>  <br> Imouto threads that are nothing but image dumps are shit as it is little better than a general, the true spirit of those threads is in essence that blogshit that you hate. Talking about wanting to fuck your sister is the exception but I guess things have changed. </br>  <br>What if I don't want to fuck my sister, but I like talking about fucking my sister?</br>  <br>You broke my brain for a second.</br>  <br>I was afraid of somehow losing my love for Kirino after Oreimo ended. I'm glad I didn't. I love Kirino.</br>  <br>It does happen regularly, here was another recent one: https://archive.moe/a/thread/128570<wbr>088/<br><br>Mods are complete turds nowadays</br></br></wbr></br>  <br> https://archive.moe/a/thread/12857<wbr>0088/</wbr> <br>Sure, y'know, venting. "This happened and I cannot ever tell anyone" kinda thing.</br></br>  <br>Fucking what? Why did that get greentexted.</br>  <br>What if like talking about fucking your sister, anon?</br>  <br>Yeah, even the Imouto threads with minimal blogshit get deleted these days.</br>  Kirino is love.<br>Kirino is life.</br>  <br>Kirino is sex</br>  <br>Fuck you, Kirino is pure.</br>  <br>Tell that to Kyousuke's dick.</br>  <br>this. i read that after finishing the anime and i really didnt need to be upset all over again<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>MY PENIS</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Kirino a cute. A CUTE.</br></br>  <br>Here's the deal: If you're Kirino and Kyousuke how do you even go about raising your children? Like, they now some shit may go down inside their own house.</br>  <br>Kirino is a known Lolicon, i would not trust her around her daughter</br>  <br>Going to end up like Imouto Controller.</br>  <br>But they would probably include the son, too. So, imouto controller+1<br>As long as the son doesnt NTR Kyousuke. I will be fine</br></br>  <br>I don't think they'd do anything with their children. Yuno may fall for Kyosuke but never be reciprocated. And later for her brother. But I don't think Kirini and Kyosuke would just turn their house into incest haven.</br>  <br>They knew the risks of first gen incest, i dont think they would take any chances with the kids</br>  <br>At worst she'll be a little excessively cuddly, she's got Kyousuke to satiate her sexual desires.</br>  <br>He knows.<br><br>Yeah, but if the kid turns out anything like Kyosuke I can totally see him shouting to his face "You made a family with your sister, why can't we." and Kyosuke may be a lot of things, but he's not a hypocrite. I don't know how that would turn out.</br></br></br>    <br>Why else did you think oreimo threads ended up such a mess?</br>  <br>good god<br>how would i find oreimo doujins? just look up "oreimo doujins" on the googles?</br></br>  <br>If nothing else, Kirino and Kyousuke are intelligent and sensible. The understood the risks of what they did, and took steps to prevent a similar incident as the one that brought them together. They probably got their tubes tied after the first few kids too, so they weren't playing genetic roulette everytime they had fun.</br>  <br>Please give the siblings privacy.</br>    <br>Kirino wouldn't stir shit, she'd be in the loli threads.</br>  <br>Go to a hentai site, dude.</br>  <br>But fucking be careful. Stay away from the NTR section</br>  <br>NTR sucks, but Oreimo NTR is even more painful for some reason</br>  <br> moefag, incestfag, normal/fa/g, all-around bitch <br> delusional edgy chunishit, and a femlet <br> arguing over which shit tastes less like shit <br><br>Meanwhile a smoking hot princess in disguise is eyeballing MC behind those glasses.</br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128821806 <br>What kinda person makes an image like this?</br>  <br>A terrible human being.

He accepts eroge so that's one down. Now how do we tell him we're boning?"<br><br>Also, god bless you for that link.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna steal her from him and take her somewhere so far away that he'll never be able to find us.</br>  <br>I'm surprised they don't have more kids, if I had a hot wife like Daisuke I'd like more.</br>  <br>Wow, you are a total cunt</br>  <br>Kirino stoled him from a bunch of other women.</br>  <br>He doesn't deserve her so it's ok.</br>    Does Kirino blaze it?  <br>Aren't Japanese drug laws pretty strict?</br>    <br>And morally forbidden for what I have read on  /jp/ </br>  <br>Incest is not exactly celebrated.</br>  <br>He didn't steal her from anyone, they fucked themselves over by not being an imouto<br><br>No, but Kozue did</br></br></br>  <br>A cute girl shouldn't doing drugs.</br>   Her face when you tell her "I love you".  <br>Hnggg</br>  <br>Cute girls doing drugs is my fetish.</br>  <br> Her face when the guy she likes is actually boning his sister </br>    <br>I can't find good pictures of cutie3.14 girls doing drugs. Looks like for MALfags this is just a meme.<br><br> Weed in captha. <br> Fucking google's spy service. I just browsed two images. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Weddings are so wonderful</br>    How do you measure in Kozue's?    <br>The same way you measure in Manami's. Just shit in a bucket</br>    Does anyone happen to have smug kirino with hipster glasses?  <br>Why so pale?</br>  <br>Because Kirino is not meant to be dark, fool. And Sora is supposed to be pale as dicks</br>  <br>My dick ain't pale, pal.</br>  <br>You ruined them.</br>  <br>Not all dicks, of course. <br>Look at this white skin. Why would you want to sully it in the sun?</br></br>  <br>That's not how you say "you improve them".</br>    <br>Non-dyed Kirino is the best</br>  <br>That's better but I little of Australian beaches should make her skin healthier.<br><br> Unless cum can do that job. It can't right? </br></br></br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Look pretty good. But the big colour change does make a bit elements of design clash a bit more. Eyes should be a bit -just a bit- smaller. The whites clash too much with the darker skin tone and they're huge.<br><br>But still pretty good.</br></br></br>  <br>She's a natural brunette. Dyejobs are ugly</br>  <br>Haruhi doing drugs? well meme'd... but<br><br> less bitchy <br> friendly <br> talkative <br><br>Why didn't the SOS fire a joint for Haruhi?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I wish the anime didn't make Kyousuke such a doormat.<br><br>In the LN he is much more alpha. He actually stands up for himself against Kirino and even calls her out for being tsundere. I just read a part where he straight up tells her she wants a kiss and then dodges her attacks like a pro.<br><br>With the exception of the S2 OVAs he is pretty much volume 1 Kyousuke throughout the whole anime. They included very little character development.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hey Kirino, wanna try something new? <br> What? <br> Here, smell this first. Does it smell like chloroform to you? </br></br></br>  <br>I don't like the colouring on these "natural" edits. There's something off about them, like they don't belong in Oreimo.</br>  <br>That's because most of the development was in his head. Haruhi got around that by having Kyon monologue all the time and Oreimo doesn't really do that</br>    <br>It's because you're so used to seeing Kirino with the orange, that when you see her with brown it just looks off.</br>  <br>Sometimes I guess</br>  <br>I wonder if she is actually into femdom. I get the feeling that she wants Kyousuke to dominate her</br>  <br>They don't. That's why they aren't.</br>  <br> I'm a good girl, aren't I? <br> Then where's my reward? <br><br>Still my beating heart</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sora really shines when the camera is on her, especially when they get caught, and she just doesn't give two fucks.<br> Look at me, Haru <br> Look only at me <br> And then she kisses him on the cheek. Jesus christ </br></br></br></br>  <br>The world's best imouto, and a miracle of the universe.<br><br>Shame Haru is such a terrible onii-chan.</br></br></br>  <br>So how did that go down? They go to Europe or something and live together, right? But do they live together together?</br>  <br> The world's best imouto, and a miracle of the universe. </br>  <br>That slap hurt to watch. It wasn't just the fact that it sent poor Sora to the ground, but it was so out of character for Haru, and he didn't even try to apologize.<br>Haru doesn't deserve her, but for some reason, she loves her onii-chan. Even if he is an oblivious, abusive asshole who literally tried to drown her.</br></br>  <br>They went to Scandanavia together for a while. I don't know the exact circumstances, because I haven't played Haruka Na Sora, but eventually, they end up married and Sora is pregnant</br>  <br>Wow, pregnant twins. Wonder what they baby's going to look like.</br>  <br>Probably almost exactly like their parents.</br>  <br>add one leg and three eyes tho.</br>  <br>Who knows, maybe they'll beat the odds in the third VN.<br> Realistically, though, could Sora even survive childbirth? She's a very small girl, and she's delicate as well </br></br>  <br>Well I dunno, there's a lot of small delicate girls out there and they're all alive.</br>  <br>Yeah, it was a rethorical question. Probably the same, and probably twins as well.<br><br>Actually first generation incest is really safe. Or as safe (as far as healthy baby) as a pregnancy by a woman over forty, it's an increment of 3% risk. It increases exponentially with every passing generation, though.</br></br></br>  <br>But they are twins, so the odds are not in their favor</br>  Anyone have a link were i can watch the animated comentary from season 2??  <br>He tried to save her. He actually probably did end up saving her life, because she'd been planning on killing herself, and only regained the will to live when Haru threw himself into the lake with her.<br><br>I don't think he's actually a bad brother, but that slap and the scenes after left a bad taste in my mouth.<br><br>I've always wondered, though. The very last scene with Haru and Sora in the train kissing. She has her bunny, but it's shown that she tore it up before going to drown herself. ?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, you're right. I don't know how that would work.</br>  <br> vlcsnap </br>  <br>If I had to guess, I would say Nao helped to fix it if Haru couldnt on his own. We dont know how much time passed between them leaving and when they almost drowned. Long enough for Kozue to adopt a completely different hairstyle, at least</br>  <br>Fraternal twins don't have any special genetic connection, they share 50% of their DNA just like ordinary siblings. They're basically normal siblings that happened to be born at the same time.<br><br>Haru and Sora have the same risk of producing a retard mutant child as Kyousuke and Kirino do</br></br></br>  <br>I guess it would be too much to ask for a sounded version of that webm?</br>  <br>Twins have waaaay more DNA in common than just ordinary siblings though. That's why they look alike and all.</br>  <br>They're fraternal twins, so there's no difference between any other brother and sister. Identical twins could spell trouble, except they can't have babby.</br>  <br>Just go watch the episode at chia anime or something</br>  <br>Actually it's more like Sora's ill health in general suggests some genetic weaknesses (as opposed to congenital, since Haru is fine), which would be more likely to pass to kids since Haru has a good change of being a carrier too. Nothing to do with them being twins.</br>  I love when an imouto thread starts getting into genetics. It makes me feel better about having this fetish.  <br>Imouto threads conflict me. Cutesy wutsy love stories that are kinda taboo are really nice.<br>It just makes me really sad that I could never bring myself to do this kinda stuff with my sister even though she's always wanted something like that.<br><br>But to avoid death by blog: Can we all agree this was a terrible imouto anime?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Personally, I have a hardon for any incest story that has a happy ending.<br> YNS <br> OreImo <br> AkaneIro <br> Koi Kaze <br>It just feels good to know that love can bloom anywhere.<br> I would have included Kana Imouto, but i know better.

All he's ever done is nosebleed all over mermaids in fishman Island and fail to kick down a door in Punk Hazard. He's really lucky that big mom didn't do him in. He's absolutely garbage and would gladly betray Luffy and the Other Strawhats for a pair of giant tits</br></br>  <br>No. Sanji s the new leader.<br><br>Mr. Prince is back.<br><br>Get hype.</br></br></br></br></br>   MFW next chapter is back in Dressrosa again   Delly is cute!  Sanji is the only good character. Please end your existence.  Kaido takes the expression "Whatever doesnt kill you makes you stronger" to a Whole new level.  Who is this guy and what does he have to do with One Piece?  Is there actually any evidence of someone eating 2 or more devil fruit and dying? I'm wondering if it's just a rumor, and you can actually eat more than 1, but people are too afraid to try it.  Kaido is Oz II<br>he was made immortal by the previous Ope Ope no Mi user<br>he eats SMILEs all the time in attempt to kill himself and that's how he ended up as 100-beasts Kaido</br></br>  Sanji thread?  <br>World government is pretty tyranical. They probably said that so people wouldnt become too powerful</br>  <br> 6 months of Sanji hats now <br><br>Fuck I wouldnt mind.</br></br></br>  <br> he was made immortal by the previous Ope Ope no Mi user <br><br>that's not Shakky</br></br></br>  I wonder if Sanji will ever become a decent character again. <br><br>Right now, he only does two things: get crazy for girls and kick people. He has become as one-dimensional as Franky. Didn't he have some kind of dream and motivations and unique characteristics that go beyond "I LIKE GURRLS"?</br></br>  <br>A friend linked a video, so I watched it and a few more after<br>It's a bit like watching gore, it's nasty but you're still a bit morbidly curious sometimes</br></br>  What if Brook had eaten a second devil fruit before he died. Would he die, get rezzed by the yomi yomi no mi, and then have the powers of the second fruit?  <br>A manlet Oars maybe.</br>  <br>I really wanted him to pull a Mr Prince at the end of Dressrosa.<br><br> tfw he probably didnt solo Big Mam ship. </br></br></br>  <br>nope, he would have exploded and lost both abilities, killing him for real</br>  <br>Sanjifags epic btfo</br>  <br>Shakky is friend of Kureha or Bonney.</br>  So are they on Zou?  <br>He could only conserve the yomi yomi no mi. The other would respawn.</br>  Why doesn't Kaido eat 2 devil fruits to kill himself?  Are they related?  <br>Probably.</br>  <br>He already ate 100.<br><br><br>Yes, Kaido is actually Oars III the Manlet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kaido turns out to be green <br><br>yuck</br></br></br>  <br>Why can't One Piece just stretch to the end of the grand line?</br>  <br>Most likely, since the Pirates there were expecting Kinemon.<br>For some reason I thought Zou as a plain island like Long Ring Long Island.</br></br>  <br> he eats SMILEs all the time in attempt to kill himself and that's how he ended up as 100-beasts Kaido <br><br>I like that theory.</br></br></br>  <br>hes eatin 100 devil fruits<br>why do you think hes called "hundred beast kaido"?</br></br>  <br>I want Kaido to be blue.</br>  <br>I think the samurai they were looking for is the third one that came with Kinemon and Kanjuro</br>  <br> not expecting Zoo to be a jungle <br>Really?</br></br>  <br><br><br>If this is true, then Blackbeard would be pretty unimpressive in comparison. Most of us believe that his big thing will be three DF powers at once. If Kaido has 100 DF powers, then BB would be nothing special.</br></br></br>  <br> why do you think hes called "hundred beast kaido"? <br><br>Because he has a crew of 100 Zoans?</br></br></br>   the only reason Kaidou is so "strong" is because of his stupid personality gag <br><br> Kaidou in reality is weaker than Doflamingo </br></br>  I love this early introductions of crews, these two Kaidou crewmates along with the Doffy lookalike and Scotch are definitely becoming important in Kaidou's arc. Like Buffalo and Baby 5 in Punk Hazard.  <br> Unimpressive in comparison <br><br>BB has two of the strongest offensive devil fruits. As far as we're aware/speculating, Kaido has been eating SMILE which could have incredibly different effects.</br></br></br>  <br>100 Zoans don't really compare to a triumvirate of the most broken fruits.</br>  <br>Maybe you can eat more than one smile and not die.<br><br><br>In any case, it points out that its indeed Zou.<br>Law´s crew appearing when?<br><br><br>I didnt thought much about it.<br>Is there a reference im missing?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> being 1/50 inmortal is unimpressive <br> being the second man alive to eat 2 devil fruits is unimpressive <br>Also fuck you and your cerberus cancer theories.</br></br></br>  <br> Like Buffalo and Baby 5 in Punk Hazard. <br><br>These two were important? Buffalo did nothing and then was one shotted by Gyros. Baby 5 got a nice backstory and resolution, but that all happened in one chapter and had zero impact on the rest of the arc.</br></br></br>  <br> Is there a reference im missing? <br> Zou <br> Zoo <br>You know zoos? That things full of animals.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also Zou means elephant.</br></br>  <br><br>Zou = elephant</br></br>  After all the hype, I expected Oda to turn Kaidou into a small, physically unimpressive dwarf. Or an old man. Or a little kid. Or an anorexic weed. Actually turning him into a big muscly guy didn't really shock anybody and there was no reason to hide his appearence. Too bad.  <br>Isn't that the official explication ?<br><br>I don't even know where this ''he ate a 100 fruits'' theory is coming from ?<br>Can someone tell me.</br></br></br></br>  Would've been more epic if we didn't know it was him until the end of the chapter where he'd be like:Btw my name is Kaidou, sorry for your base.  Remember when the Seven Warlords were all fencers?<br><br>Remember when Boa Hancock was sketched very early on? That dude with the stick legs and barbarian may appear in Wano and Elbaf, respectively. I think the gunner is Mr. 5, or possibly Scotch. <br><br>We're finally in Zou. Can't wait to see the Minkmen and Snakenecks. We already saw Bepo and Pekoms, so now all that's left are the Snakes.<br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>And no chapter the week after that.</br>    <br>He is, don't worry.<br>I really doubt Oda would forgot sanji or make him a third class character.<br>He's a part of the monster trio, faithfull to the captain, intelligent.<br><br>Mr Prince will be back.<br><br>  I love his sunglasses and new clothes tough </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Isn't that the official explication ? <br><br>I don't remember that being said in the manga.<br><br> I don't even know where this ''he ate a 100 fruits'' theory is coming from ? <br><br>He wants to kill himself and eating more than one DF apparently kills you. Aside from his nickname, I think that's the only basis for this theory so far.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Given how imposing his appearance is one would already assume it just ofr seeing him.<br>I think his introduction was done good enough.</br></br>  <br>I doubt it would've been that obvious if you didn't see the spoilers.</br>  So is Law confirmed to be the one to kill Kaidou? This might be why he wanted to go for him instead of another Yonkou, and since he was being provided by Joker it it was his golden choice to kill two birds on one shot.  Does Sanji have autism?  <br><br> Luffy trained by Reileigh, the right hand man of Roger and a person on par with admirals and yonkou <br><br> Zoro trained with Mihawke, the current world's greatest swordsman, who's strength is on par with yonkous and admirals <br><br> Sanji trained with a transvestite that could even destroy Pacifistas <br><br>Sanji fags, when will they learn?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone else think Kaido is kind of innocent in a way? Like sort of in the way Luffy is?  <br><br>Well in Moriah's flashback, we can clearly see his crew being made only of Zoan users.<br><br>Pic related</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sanji trained by a high ranking member of the Revolutionary Army </br>  Everyone remember to do your best to appreciate Penguin today!  <br><br>Fuck that's not Moriah's flashback but Law's...</br></br>  <br>I thought he choose Kaido just to fuck Doffy while at it.<br><br> yfw Kaido ends up with a Fate worse than death. </br></br></br>  <br>Nah, it seems more like he's old and jaded.</br>  <br><br>Sanji trained with one of the most trusted man by the most dangerous criminal on the planet.</br></br>  <br> This might be why he wanted to go for him instead of another Yonkou <br><br>He never wanted to go for him. He just told this to Luffy so that he would come along and help him against Doffy. His initial plan was to destroy the SMILE factory so that Kaido would kill Doffy.</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;Sanji trained with a transvestite that could even destroy Pacifistas <br>Nigga, don't disparage Ivankov.<br><br> is able to hold off Magellan with a crippled transexual in his afro and escape without any lasting injuries <br> it takes Blackbeard, his entire crew, the previous warden, and several level 6 prisoners to beat Magellan <br>Not to mention Ivankov is probably the strongest revolutionary (though I imagine Dragon has that crazy kung fu like Sabo).</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kaido is the only character who could make Shanks waste all his Haki.<br>So if Kaido does attack Shanks, I don't think BB would get a better chance than that.</br></br>  <br> Mihawke, the current world's greatest swordsman, who's strength is on par with yonkous and admirals <br>wha?</br></br>  <br>When the hell are the Heart pirates going to meet up with the Strawhats? I need this development.</br>  Was there any actually satisfying fight in Dressrosa?<br><br>The Doffy family either got one shotted only to putz around later on or they got a fight with one of the gladiators that ended in half a chapter defeat. <br>You had shit like Lao G beating the fuck out of the dwarves but then he ended up being relegated to "funny old men fight".<br><br>The only fight with any weight behind it was Franky VS Senor Pink and that was broken up into HARD BOILED gags throughout 40 chapters worth of padding.<br><br>All the Elite Officers had really lackluster fights with Trebol and Diamante doing dumb prop fights that belonged back in East Blue (the iron rain was some fucking Krieg tier garbage). Pica was the only one (besides Pink) who put up a fight and that was really just him swatting at shit until Zoro almost on shot him.<br><br>The gladiator fights had more impact to them.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Reileigh can fight equally with Kizaru <br><br> Mihawk can fight equally with Shanks <br><br> Ivankov gets one-shotted by Akainu </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope soon.</br>  <br>Ivankov fought Bartholomew evenly.</br>  <br>Rayleigh cut Kizaru's face.

Can't think of any combo which could beat that.</br></br></br>  <br>Are the Strawhats on Zou yet? Because Zou is supposedly the next island, right? <br><br>Someone asked yesterday if the people Chopper were trying to cure or treat were the Heart Pirates. I wasn't able to see the responses to that, though.</br></br></br>  <br>The third samurai they were looking for</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Sanji and co. are on Zou, waiting to meet up with Luffy and the rest of the crew.</br>  <br>Bomu Bomu + Hana Hana<br><br>Honestly like 90% of all paramecia are fucking broken with robin</br></br></br>  <br><br>Read the chapter. Your guess is as good as mine.</br></br>  <br>If we're counting only fruits than any Logia could beat that</br>  <br>Invisible and Silent can when you walk up behind and slit the throat</br>  <br>sanji and company are intruders on the island. Kaidou's lackey is looking for that furry girl</br>  <br>They are probably stationed in that island, and since they are not affiliated with Kaido they are considered invaders.<br>That her, was probably the third samurai that was with Kinemon and Kanjuro</br></br>  <br>observation haki</br>  <br><br>Robin's fruit would be pretty broken on its own if she used it effecitvely.</br></br>  <br>Now that you mention it, I haven't read the Mangastream version yet. Thanks, anon!</br>  <br>Oh its you again<br><br>go away spammer</br></br></br>  <br>I hope that Sanji's new bounty will be the second lowest because the marines didn't see him do anything.<br>And the picture should be okama Sanji of course</br></br>  <br>what are you talking about anon</br>  <br>Female samurai?<br>But there's a girl in the chapter hiding, it is not related to her?<br>This is the third samurai in kinemon group, a male named Kanjuro.<br>So I'm still confused.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm glad he got replaced by Spiral and his gang.</br>  <br> Second lowest <br> Nami, Brook, Chopper are all with him <br><br>Why would he have the second lowest?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, a guy with that fruit would've been a great non-powerlevel villain, maybe if the strawhats are suddenly stuck on a small island due to super shitty weather with a bunch of other pirates and suddenly people get offed one by one by a silent killer. Would have been a pretty good little arc.</br>  <br>Its pretty broken as it is.<br>Hence why Oda doesnt bother with making her fight.</br></br>  <br>Chopper would obviously be lowest<br>The Marines actually saw Nami and Brook do stuff, and they'd probably overreact to a talking skeleton</br></br>  <br>I wish the samurai would just say they have devil fruit.<br><br>The way they pussy foot around makes me think it could legit just be magic like how we've had a fucking ramen golem without needing a DF.</br></br></br>  <br>Being immortal means you live forever. Forever is a long time. Long enough that you could live to see somebody else master and use the OP no mi several times over. Meaning that yes, all of your fan theories of who is immortal can coexist at the same time.</br>  <br>I wonder if Jinbei is going to get 'de-powered' like Robin and turn into a jobber/non-fighter<br><br> provided he doesn't get killed before joining </br></br></br>  <br><br>Sanji is famous, even Doflamingo called him Black Leg so I doubt that Sanji will get lower that third in terms of bounty.<br><br>But yeah since he hasn't done anything on Dressrossa, Luffy and Zoro's bounties are going to raise while his is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kanjuro is a magic user with a paintbrush.<br>It says and shows it on that page.</br></br>  <br>God Usopp's bounty will probably be higher than Sanji's</br>  <br> muh serious fights with no joeks <br><br>Narutards should go back to writing narutard fanfiction.</br></br></br>  <br>Imagine if Usopp and Sogeking have their own bounties</br>  <br>Jinbe doesn't really need to get depowered at this point. He's strong but not anything amazing and all he does is punch.<br><br>People really think the fact he was a warlord is some kind of unbelievable power gap that makes him stronger than Luffy when we have Law who is an ally right now and would have gotten nowhere with Luffy despite having one of the most OP fruits in the story.<br><br>Now that the big suicide man has been properly introduced it's not like having Jinbe would increase their chances two fold. You could throw in all of Luffy's warlord friends (Buggy, Hancock, Law, Crocodile, and Jinbe) and then maybe we're looking at some serious power balance issues in the story but Jinbe alone is fine.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Cavendish/Hakuba vs Dellinger<br>Robin vs Hakuba<br>Robin vs Tontatta (Zoro took way longer).<br>Franky<br>Kyros<br>Usopp<br>Fuji and Doffy vs Zoro and Kinemon<br>Fuji vs Doffy vs Law<br>All gladiator rounds<br>Sabo vs Burgess<br>The VA who got wrecked by Bartolomeo</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Franky VS Senor was my favorite fight and that was the joke fight of joke fights.</br>  <br><br>After all he's done, it might be higher than Zoro's too.<br><br>But remember, Ussop has no bounty yet.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying ope ope respawns before the immortal dies </br>  <br> Hence why Oda doesnt bother with making her fight. <br>That's just because she's a woman</br></br>  <br>Imagine the reaction of the people in his village</br>  <br><br>Noro Noro no Mi and Pika Pika no Mi<br><br>You make your opponent slow while you lightkick the shit out of him.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Colosseum fights <br>Good except for the Rebecca and Sabo ones <br> Law, Doffy, and Fuji <br>Good<br> Machive vs. Harujin <br>Bad<br> Sai, Baby 5, and Lao G <br>Good, but only because of the backstory and Lao G being funny<br> Hakuba vs. Dellinger <br>Literally one-shotted<br> Barto vs. Gladius <br>Great<br> Leo vs. Jora <br>Bad<br> Franky vs. Pink <br>Great<br> Kyros vs. Diamante <br>Bad<br> Zoro vs. Pica <br>Good<br> Luffy and Law vs. Doffy <br>Good until Luffy had to recover.<br> Sabo vs. Burgess <br>Eh</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd like to think Usoland would get the bounty</br>  <br>I think their schtick is that since Wano is pretty much Japan, they're a hyper isolated society who aren't too familiar with the outside world. So they don't actually know what devil fruits are even after gaining powers from them.</br>  So who do you think gave him the scar? I bet it was probably Roger.  <br><br>What bothered me the most was that all the fights were constantly interrupted and the majority of the fight happened off-screen. When you cannot focus on one thing because you only see snippets of it, you lose interest. I couldn't care less about the Zoro vs Pika fight after several months of only seeing tiny segments of it. The fights felt like a bunch of teasers and not like actual fights.</br></br>  <br>I'm guessing Akainu since it looks so much like the one he gave Luffy.</br>  <br>Who do you think gave him the tatoo?</br>  <br><br>He did it to himself.</br></br>  <br>gomu gomu and bara bara. <br><br>majin buu, niggas</br></br></br>  <br> gungir the spear of fucking elbaf <br> bad  <br>literally 10 thousand + tons worth of a punch</br></br></br>  <br>Either him or Whitebeard<br><br><br>Maybe it's a temporary tatoo?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think it was Whitebeard after Roger´s death</br>  <br>That little furry girl</br>  <br>Gekko Moria</br>  <br>No one thinks Jinbe is stronger than Luffy.<br><br>But at the very least he is fucking strong and at that kind of level. More than Sanji for sure. <br><br>But when Robin was first introduced, she looked strong as fuck and probably could take Sanji too.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Makino's baby daddy</br>  <br>If we go 50-50 literally 50% of the population can take on Sanji.</br>  Kaido's design is boring. Big muscly dude with horns, a rope belt and spiked bracelets.  <br>This shit is a lot better read consecutively man. Take a bit of time to read the arc through in one go and it gets better. Not the best OP arc but it's alright.</br>  <br>I only remember Kinemon, Kanjuro, and Momomonosuke being in the trio.</br>  <br>crocodile isnt exactly a friend. plus all of those people + strawhats + heart pirates vs kaido is still a lose</br>  <br><br>Best One Piece image.<br><br>I wish there were more like it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>  Jinbei stronger than Sanji <br><br>The ''Sanji is weak'' meme is getting out of hand</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ope Ope no mi surgery </br>  <br> immortal <br> dies </br></br>  <br> Momomonosuke <br>He was part of the trio? I figured he was just a tag-a-long.</br></br>  <br>Every time he tried getting a tatoo the needle broke, so he just spray paints it on every week</br>  <br><br><br>I hope Jinbe never joins and only stays an honorary member. There are already enough SHs and if there has to be another one, don't let it be a boring guy like Jinbe. What is he supposed to do during their adventures besides fighting? Standing in the background looking annoyed or disinterested when the other SHs get into silly fights due to their character quirks?</br></br></br>  <br>I kinda like it, he reminds me of white beard but a Mongolian</br>  <br>Not that anon, but there's no way Sanji is stronger than Jinbei. Shit, he might be stronger than Zoro.</br>  <br>sanji has literally no feats that put him even close to jimbei's level. he will be considered weak until he can show that he isnt. having him oneshot some random nobody that even brook could hold off means nothing. so far from feats alone hes far below zoro/luffy</br>  <br>I'm not talking about Jinbe being stronger than Sanji  which he is <br>Sanji has one big weakpoint. It is half the population of the planet. Fucker can get killed by half the population of the planet.</br></br>  <br>Dude Sanji isn't more powerful than a Warlord<br><br>Never said he was weak but come on. Do you remember when Jinbe and Luffy had a mini fight on Fishman Island? That's how you know.</br></br></br>  <br><br>useless as fuck with Observation Haki users.</br></br>  <br>jesus is one piece still going on last I remember they left the mermaid city</br>  <br>Sanji isn´t exactly weak, but he isn´t a warlord like Jimbe used to be</br>  <br>Absalom seems to do well in the new world</br>  Luffy will not beat Kaido but just convince him somehow to become an ally. <br><br>Remember that I called it when this happens in 100 weeks.</br></br>  <br>Agreed, Sanji is a fucking faggot. Kalifa had one of the keys which may have saved Robin's life but he pussied out of hurting her anyway. <br><br>This bitch nigga literally does put any fucking stranger woman in front of his crew. I want the series to end with him braking his chivalry at least once though, for the sake of the crew. Maybe then I can respect him.</br></br></br>  <br><br>So you're saying Croc &gt; current Sanji because Croc was a warlord? <br><br>Is Buggy also stronger than Sanji?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Kuma kuma + Goro Goro no mi <br><br>I wanna be a fucking lightning bear.</br></br></br>  if sanji doesn't get a badass moment this arc he will forever be the worst strawhat<br><br><br>he needs to beat somebody that would at least give zoro a hard time or have an honorable defeat and like lose a leg fighting kaido</br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes. What was it like living under a rock? Did you eat grubs?</br></br>  I was wondering if I should watch the anime or not. Now I know not to. What the fuck Toei. What the fuck.  <br>Fishman Island was like 3-4 years ago anon, we've just finished up an arc and the SH are going to go the 4th island and there's still a shit ton left to resolve and do.</br>  <br><br>We are only 70% done. Still a few years to go before we finally learn what that fucking treasure is unless Oda decides to just reveal it nonchalantly (similar to how the colossal titan was revealed).</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>While I do agree that Sanji did nothing since the time skip (well nearly nothing), I'm pretty sure that Jibei isn't stronger than him, Zoro or Luffy.<br><br>Zoro and Sanji still didn't fight seriously despite Sanji jobbing to Doffy but it was logic.<br><br>And being a Warlord doesn't mean anything anymore. <br><br>And unless Oda has been cuckold by a Sanji look-a-like, I really don't see him putting him so low for no reason when he was strong as fuck since the beginning.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, I really want to see oda draw a fight with a guy who can turn into any animal, would be fun to see him mix and match some ridiculous bodyparts. Especially if we have some interesting animals instead of just mammals, like mantis shrimp, slugs, jellyfish, insects, spiders, and things like that.</br>  <br>forgot pic</br>  <br><br>I wonder if they will censor Doffy hacking Law's arm</br></br>  <br><br>A guy who can turn into any animal vs animal straw hats.</br></br>   Luffy is John Cena <br>Oda makes Luffy get his ass kicked until the final moments where Luffy turns it around and wins. <br> Zoro is Roman Reigns <br>Oda won't even let Zoro look weak. Zoro has yet to really try in the New World beating everything with ease<br> Sanji is Dolph Ziggler <br>Oda writes Sanjis into big fights like vs Vergo, vs Doffy only for him to job out. Sanji is a jobber to the stars exactly like Ziggler<br> Law is Dean Ambrose <br>Oda wrote them in as an edgy alternative to the main hero. They seem OP as fuck but at the end they always either barely win (vs Vergo) or lose after giving it his all (vs Doffy)<br> Whitebeard is Brock Lesnar <br>Took literally everyone and everything to bring him down and he still went down swinging<br> Akainu is the Undertaker <br>An untouchable monster that only one person has really made look weak<br> Smoker is Wade Barret <br>Just a fucking jobber after so much promise</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To be fair, how can you show a man getting half of his head melted off on TV?</br>  So /a/ will that happen ?<br><br>I don't believe in<br><br>  Nami vs Lafitte <br>  Sanji vs Burgess <br>  Franky vs Pizzaro <br>  Brook vs Vasco Shot </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Croc is strong as fuck, not the strongest warlord but he isn´t weak I actually think they are on the same level. But if they were to fight I said that boy Croc could clean the floor with Sanji.<br><br>Buggy is weak tho. But his fruit is dope as fuck</br></br></br>  <br><br>go back to /woo/</br></br>  <br><br>This. I love hybrid animals.</br></br>  <br>Nikyu Nikyu + Hana Hana</br>  <br>So Pekoms is your favorite character?</br>  <br><br>piss off, fatty</br></br>  <br>I think Sanji v. Burgess is happening but I honestly don't see the rest</br>  <br>It's not only that anon.<br>Him not getting half of his head destroyed is a sin in and of itself but<br> no swords sticking out <br> 2 made up wounds <br>It's like the fight in the anime was completely different to the manga.<br>Why the fuck would you butcher a very important scene in the story? It's not like the manga is 18+. Why would you even censor it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't know why you think the word Zou is pronounced the same as Zoo</br>  <br><br>Wolf will fight against General Franky<br><br>Switch Robin with Nami because Nami mostly fights women. <br><br>No idea who will fight Pizarro. It will probably the member who actually joins, rather than Jinbe who will never join.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Okay. We're all entitled to our headcanon anon, feel free to enjoy it  until Oda tears it apart. </br>  <br> implying nami and robin will ever get real fights again </br>  <br> I'm pretty sure that Jibei isn't stronger than him, Zoro or Luffy. <br><br>Well Jimbe fight Ace for three days and leave Ace weak. Jimbe is the only know fisherman to be a warlord also he beat Moria easily on Marineford<br><br> Zoro and Sanji still didn't fight seriously <br>Halfway I'm pretty sure started to fight seriously by the end of the fight with Pika<br><br> And being a Warlord doesn't mean anything anymore.  <br>Yeah of course, this is b8</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I would say Whitebeard</br>  <br>Joking aside, the sanji like girls joke got annoying rather fast, and that subplot during that mermaid arc for him was fucking retarded. A rare blood transplant from a nosebleed?</br>  I really hope Sanji catches up to zoro soon, if they're not on roughly the same level it ruins the rivalry, and those are some of the best jokes in the series.  <br> implying they wont <br>Look, I can do it too!</br></br>  <br><br>Pekoms was interesting but I liked the design of these guys even more.</br></br>  <br>is sanji based of steve?</br>  <br>Based on Steve as he was in reservoir dogs, yeah.</br>  <br><br>Well that was young Ace. You're right tough and I'm not saying that Jinbei is weak, far from it. Just that you're understimating Luffy, Zoro and especially Sanji.<br><br>  Halfway I'm pretty sure started to fight seriously by the end of the fight with Pika <br><br>Nah man. Not a single sweat drop, not a single scratch. His suit is clean as fuck. Zoro is not being challenged at all for the moment. Only Fujitora surprised him.<br><br>  Yeah of course, this is b8 <br>I'm not baiting. Luffy kicked 3 Shishibukai's asses. Looks like the other are Warlords only because they have nothing else to do.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Ahm gonna be a Stwawhat! Youww seee~  <br>when was the last time sanji was even close to zoro?</br>  reminder that Viola is 100% guaranteed of joining the SH's unless she's into incest and marries her dad Riku.  <br>Apparently, according to some image I didn't save posted in one of these threads a day ago.</br>  <br>Unless Oda really drops the ball, I doubt the final arc won't be full of at least one 1v1 for each strawhat.</br>  <br>But anon, how could she join the Strawhat crew considering she's dead?  Rightfully so at that, bitch had it coming. </br>  <br>uh<br>jyabura had like 95% of kakus powerlevel at least</br></br>  <br>No you just get a cover story.</br>  <br> Welcome to the Salty Spitoon, how tough are ya?! </br>  <br><br>well that's surprising, since mr.pink is better character than sanji</br></br>  <br>Maybe by then, Nami will have a fight where her opponent doesn't let her set up her attacks beforehand.</br>  <br>Meant to quote <br/></br>  <br>the worst part of these threads is the retarded crew member theories<br><br>like sure there's a chance oda will do some kubo tier trolling and just have some random fuck join the crew but chances are it's going to be a central character of an arc and it will be super obvious they're the next member like ussop, sanji,nami etc</br></br></br>  <br> Brook </br>  <br><br>+ He was the only CP9 member to be able to move while use the Tekkai.<br><br>The true last moment Sanji was equal to Zoro was right before Zoro tok Muffy's pain by Kuma. From that moment Sanji never catched up.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Retarded crew member theories have been going on since at least Marineford. Remember when Whitebeard died and people were saying Luffy would inherit Whitebeard's crew?</br>  <br>This, personality wise Jinbe is too laid back</br>  <br>Brook ate a fruit that gave him a second life. Did monet? Nope.</br>  <br> Just that you're understimating Luffy, Zoro and especially Sanji. <br>They are the monster trio, they are strong but I think you are the one underestimating Jimbe. I think Jimbe is superior to Sanji not by brute force but because he has more experience fighting.<br> <br> Zoro is not being challenged at all for the moment <br>I'll give you that<br><br> Luffy kicked 3 Shishibukai's asses. Looks like the other are Warlords only because they have nothing else to do. <br>Well he is the strongest of the monster trio. But you are right most of them have owned that titled because they have nothing better to do, but also because they are well know pirates, for instace, the current better swordsman is one of them</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Literally looks like Pika</br>  <br> the ending to marineford was originally very different. Luffy would go onto whitebeards ship and wear his moustache, and say "I am whitebeard now" </br>  <br>Negro , i understand the sanji hate , but don´t shit on Ivankov</br>  <br> the swan has a bon clay appearance </br>  <br>ludicrously strong old men is my favorite thing in anime</br>  <br>I hope we don't see Ivankov for long, long time.<br><br> Because scanlators are going to give him that retarded German accent again. </br></br></br>  <br> Fujitora starting shit with world government <br> Kaidou appearance <br> Still not chapter 800 yet <br><br>What happens at 800 guys?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We get to see Nami's tits</br>  <br><br>Oda already stated it's going to be a huge war.<br><br>At most you'll see 1v1's similar to the ones during Marineford, a few exchanges and a comment or two regarding the strength of each opponent.<br><br>In the end, one or two important people will die, a few flashbacks will explain Roger/Will of the D, and Luffy will become pirate king.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you retarded?</br>  <br>Nothing special. Why do you think every 100 chapters has to be special?</br>  <br> implying marineford is going to even compare to the finale </br>  <br><br>You'll see. Kaido will become an ally. Luffy will not defeat him but impress him enough with his conviction and abilities for him to change his mind.</br></br>  <br>they've always been about equal. Sanji just never gets Zoro-tier fights. He's either fighting jokes(Wanze) or battles that would take even Zoro out(Doffy) or anyone female of course</br>  <br> luffy vs BB <br> I honestly don't see happening </br></br>  <br><br>I know Jinbei is strong as fuck. After all, he took one of Akainu's full hit. Like you said, he fought Ace and was a Shishibukai.<br>But I don't know. It's true that I have no proof but I have the impression that the monster Trio became stronger than him after the time skip. After all they all trained with some of the best fighters in the One Piece universe. But I really don't have any proof other than that. We'll just have to wait and see.<br><br>And yeah Mihawk is a Shishibukai but he could do waaaaaaay better than that. The guy is on his own. Just imagine him making a crew of swordsmen. Damn. Kuma is a revolutinary more than a warlord. <br><br><br>*And Luffy actually beat 4 of them if you count Buggy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> At most you'll see 1v1's similar to the ones during Marineford, a few exchanges and a comment or two regarding the strength of each opponent. <br><br>So the final arc will suck too? If the next arc is as shitty as Dressrosa, Punk Hazard and Fishman Island, I'll drop this manga. New world is a big disappointment so far. Many good ideas but bad execution.</br></br></br>  <br>Sabo deserves the honor of fighting BB. To avenge his brother!</br>  <br>Anon I was talking about the ones  was talking about, not the rest on the list</br>  <br><br>I gotta say, at this point it does seem like Luffy will be the one to fight Kaidou - Common shounen trope is for the protag to defeat the "invincible/indestructible" foe. Only other thing I can imagine is BB defeating Kaidou as a sheer display of power, but Kaidou has had 400+ chapters of buildup, I don't see him going down as fodder. <br><br>Luffy's also likely to fight BB/Big Mom considering their respective crews all want to kill each other. <br><br>And Shanks is likely to die saving Luffy, because no way in hell is Luffy giving the hat back - what would they even call themselves anymore?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Judging by how tedious and drawn out Dressrosa was, I sure as fuck hope he reconsiders.</br></br>  <br>nah Shanks and luffy will double-team Blackbeard<br><br>Sabo will stick his Dragon Claw up Akainu's ass</br></br></br>  So I guess every SH except Luffy who participated during Dressrosa will get a timeout during this arc? It wouldn't be fair if Nami, Brook, Chopper and that other guy had to share their screentime with all the others while being absent for so long.  <br><br>After investing like 10+ years into this series, I'll stick it out till they at least find One Piece.</br></br>  <br>luffys waifu will make him a new strawhat</br>  <br><br>Best waifu.</br></br>  <br> Shanks is likely to die saving Luffy <br><br>I dont see it happening. Shanks would simply refuse to take the hat back with some flippant excuse</br></br></br>  <br> I am still reading a manga I do not enjoy anymore <br>You people are retards</br></br>  <br>  <br><br>it'll never happen</br></br></br>  <br>I think Blackbeard is going to kill Shanks before Luffy even gets to see him again, let alone return the straw hat<br><br>It makes sense for him to be the next major adversary for BB (motivated by events at marineford) and would continue to set BB up as Luffy's final villain.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It will be like DBZ, the first girl to show genuine affection for oblivious MC will end up marrying MC 10+ years later.<br><br>I mean who else is there?</br></br></br></br>  <br> Best waifu <br><br>Correct.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I invested so much time into it and am so familiar with its characters that I won't drop it just because an arc is bad. Three in a row though is getting ridiculous.</br></br>  <br> implying Luffy will not sacrifice his life at the end of the manga </br>  <br>Nope. Kuja only give birth to females<br><br>Oda wouldnt continue the adventure with a female lead therefore it isnt happening</br></br></br>  <br>Just accept that you have grown out of One Piece and drop it already. I for one enjoyed every single arc so far.</br>  <br> implying Luffy will ever get married <br> implying Luffy will not be executed at the end of the manga and tell the crowd about One Piece shortly before he dies </br></br>  <br><br>Isn't it only children born ON Kuja island?<br><br>also<br> Implying any other woman would be able to handle Luffy's rubber dick <br><br>Nami would get shredded by G2 Luffy.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> We'll just have to wait and see <br>Completely agree</br></br>  <br>only Bellamy and his Spring Sphincter can take the hot monkey dick</br>  <br><br>It has nothing to do with "growing out". I can still re-read old chapters and enjoy them. I also read other shonen. It's just that the pacing in the last three arcs was so bad that it was impossible for me to read it weekly. I waited several months and then read several chapters at once and STILL felt like there was almost no progression.</br></br>  <br> Oda wouldnt continue the adventure <br> implying there will be any continuation after Luffy becomes the King of Pirates </br></br>  <br> Isn't it only children born ON Kuja island? <br>Nope. Kuja women who have left the island come back with female children. ONLY female children<br><br> implying Luffy would ever use his dick without prompting <br><br>he'll be a happy ace until he dies</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Make it about Usopp's child then.</br>  UROUGE<br><br>GAIDEN<br><br>WHEN</br></br></br></br>  <br>Sanji saw a woman in this chapter....meaning he HAD to do his white knight faggot shtick. Really wish that woman from Kaido's crew would bite his dick &amp; balls and rip them off. Let's see Sanji white knight fag when his junk is not there anymore. Women would be worthless to him at that point.</br>  <br>There's not really much more to see there. Luffy doesn't want to be praised as a hero so he'll try to leave without seeing everyone. It's already the next day so I wouldn't be surprised if we see them next hitching a ride to Zou.</br>  <br><br>But that was Nami during Skypiea<br><br>It wasn't played up for comedy either</br></br></br></br>  <br> thinking there wont be a One Piece Z <br>Oda will keep on writing this story until he dies<br><br><br>nah Usopp's kid(if he even has one) will be the sniper on Makino's child's crew. Sabo/Koala's kid will be their 'brother'</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anon dont give me ideas</br>  <br> One Piece ends with Luffy being executed in the same place as Roger <br> Luffy gives the Straw Hat to some kid in the audience while walking to his execuution <br> Before getting killed, he proceed to same the same as Roger <br><br>The ride never ends</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The only we can confirm besides the obvious is that women get pregnant overseas, then RETURN and the child is female. <br><br>There is no mention of what happens to children born off the island.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> thinking there wont be a One Piece Z <br> implying Oda wont die before he even finishes the main plot-line </br></br></br>  <br> Elephant Gun! </br>  <br> he proceed to same the same as Roger <br>Went retarded there, I mean he proceeds to do the same*</br></br>  <br>I can't think of a worse ending.</br>  <br>I dont think Oda will live that long.</br>  <br> Those who venture out to sea sometimes return bearing children <br> Strangely all the children born are female </br></br>  Fuck Mr.Prince.<br>There's this cancerous idea that the moment is all Sanji is or that he hasn't done much post timeskip when he's done literally as much if not more than Zoro.</br>  <br><br> One Piece ends with Luffy finding out that there's a Space Pirate King </br></br>  <br>Sanji needs to grow as a character and by that he needs to DROP chivalry. Same to Zoro. Why? Because no modern day boy, much less young man believes in that horse shit anymore. It's a sign of a weak male specimen to be a Save the Girls assclown.<br><br>When is Japan going to make protagonists who FIGHT back against pussy? And by fight back I mean against FEMALE "friends" who are rude and abusive like Nami's unfunny shtick of beating up the guys ONLY. Would be delightful to see her punched to see if she likes a dose of her own medicine.</br></br></br>  <br> when he's done literally as much if not more than Zoro <br>I guffawed heartily.

Huh?", or something like that. <br> Miku will definitely won't fall into darkness, she's just sincerely thinking about Hibiki.

USA! <br><br><br>damn really? that's pretty sad, loved 02 almost as much as 01.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> loved 02 almost as much as 01. <br>I thought it was universally hated.<br>remind me why that's the overwhelming sentiment?</br></br></br>  <br>i literally had no idea. then again i'm a pleb when it comes to /a/ standards, as a lot of my anime knowledge comes from when it aired on tv networks in the US after school as a kid / teen.<br><br>for reference, im 25</br></br></br>  <br> I thought it was universally hated. <br>It was? Not the anon you're replying to but I loved it too.</br></br>  Ill get around to finishing and printing it someday  <br><br><br>I recently rewatched both 01 and 02 after having watched them on TV when I was younger. I enjoyed 02 almost as much, but the ending and epilogue were shit, 01 on the other hand had a really good stand alone ending.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br> but the ending and epilogue were shit, <br>From what I understand on the western front there is alot of hate because people are butthurt their ships got sunk. I don't know if there is any reason outside that.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 01 on the other hand had a really good stand alone ending. <br> not the saddest thing you've ever fucking seen as a kid <br>no, the epilogue for 02 was cheesy but i wouldn't be able to sleep as a kid if the canon didn't include all of them being best friends forever</br></br></br></br>  <br>Despite what other people think, I still think Masaru is one of the best.<br><br>Hell, the fact that he got one of the cooler sequences in Young Hunters made me pretty happy. It's too bad that the other show that got good treatment was...02.</br></br></br>  <br> izzy was more of a sidekick <br>Please, he's always been the brains, that's his role<br>I can see Tai wanting to hang out with Koushiro any day any time because he would want to<br>As with Yamato/Matt it wouldn't feel as natural. There is usually a reason for them hanging out.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Izzy musta felt left out and jelly <br>Wasn't he the one who hacked the hell out of everything and used the emails to slow down Diaboromon?</br></br>  <br>of course he was the brains. meaning he was support. making him SORT OF a sidekick. of course the sidekick idea doesn't work because it wasn't just the two of them, it was a group of equals.</br>  <br>He was the reason they even knew about Diaboromon, the reason they could go into the internet, and the reason they won the fight at the end.<br><br>The only major fuck up in this film was Takeru, and Patamon.</br></br></br>  <br>redirected floods of kids emails to slow down the villain, yea<br><br>but if you were in his shoes wouldn't you wish tentomon could have joined in on the omnimon fusion?</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Evolutions were gimmicky as fuck. It was so obvious how Armor Evolution got dropped. Imperialdramon Dragon Mode was designed to be dropped for Fighter Mode, and it still got its ass kicked. Black Wargreymon sucked ass and too goddamn for ever. Why did they spend 8 episodes on him and rocks? Why did they travel around the world? Why is Miyako so annoying? Why is Iori boring as fuck until the last 5 episodes? Why did it take 30 episodes to explain why the older Digimon could't evolve to Perfect even though Kaiser evolved Greymon like nothing? Dagomon who? Demon who? Dark Seeds what? Vamdemon why?</br></br></br>  <br>It didn't help that the strongest Armor Evolution is only used once.</br>  <br>fair enough. good points</br>  <br>No way, Izzy did more than enough in the fight.<br>What this guy said<br><br>There is no reason for him to be jelous</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's varying opinions. When I first watched the ending of 02 as a kid, I thought it was fine. I liked how they managed to tie 01 characters with it. I fucking hated Cody though.</br>  <br> wouldn't you wish tentomon could have joined in on the omnimon fusion? <br>Nah, I rather get a HeraklesKabuterimon X</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>02 was shit: <br><br>Shit new characters, ken was the only decent of the new main cast, all the others are forgettable.<br><br>Shit old characters, Hikari and Takeru didn's have the same personality that they have in adventure and all the others adventure digidestined was relegated a support and extremely useless characters, for example Sora and Yamato onlyserved for the NTR scenes, this is the only thing people remember of them in 02<br><br>Shit villains, again, Ken was the only decent but his arc was poorly executed, a digidestined becoming the bad guy was original but whole arc was very boring and the evangelization of Ken too abrupt. The arc of the spider and the mummy is better no to talk, was a fucking piece of shit, the real bad guy of this arc, Daemon, disappeared before we knew why he wanted the fucking seed. In the end they resurrect Vamdemon, the best villain of Adventure for no reason.<br><br>The epiloge was shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't forget, if the Digital Gods could reshape Takeru and Hikari's Digivices into D3s, why didn't they do it for the older kids, or even the International Chosen? Maybe then Ken could have been defeated faster than 5 agonizing months.<br><br>Also killing evil Digimon is wrong. Until it isn't.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't see Chibimon and Nat-chan.</br>   Check info on Cyber Sleuth <br> Chimeramon, and Millennimon are not in it <br><br>Well that sucks.</br></br></br>  <br> Sora and Yamato onlyserved for the NTR scenes <br>objectively wrong. Yamato hanging out with Taichi and Koushiro, covering for Daisuke was some of the most hilarious digimon happenings ever. Though yea, aside from the the top 3 the rest of the original cast was background tier</br></br>  <br>Because they were trying to write Taichi and the others out to make way for the new kids. Hell Takeru and Hikari were ignored in favor of Daisuke, Miyako, and Iori.</br>  <br>wait why why was it removed?</br>  I just want the Digimon to finally be written as characters instead of over glorified pets of the chosen children.  <br>Well, I thought Zero from V-Tamer had enough of a personality to count.<br><br>And Tail/Gatomon as well.</br></br></br>  <br>And I want the spirit evolution digimon to be in games.</br>  <br>And the International Chosen were supposed to be more important than how they were depicted. Funny how both groups were shafted for three terribly underwritten characters.<br><br><br>We got Xros Wars, where the Digimon were the characters and the humans were their helpers.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's being moved to Crunchyroll, I believe.</br>  <br>Once Tailmon joined up with Hikari, she became the girl's talking cat that can occasionally turn into a sexy woman.<br><br><br>Just the hurt in Tailmon's eyes. She waited her whole life to meet Hikari and now she's treated as a house cat by her partner.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Tamers tried.<br><br>With Adventure it was almost impossible, they already had to deal with the children, if you add 8 more characters you'd need like 30 episodes more.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've seen Xros and loved it for the depiction of Digimon as people. Blastmon was great a shane he never got a DVD cover.</br>  <br> talking cat that can occasionally turn into a sexy woman <br>I see nothing wrong with this</br></br>  <br>But Crunchy only has dubs and not subs. I want fucking subs.</br>  <br>And they're not that hard to use either:<br><br> Have the Human, and Beast spirits at Adult level, fuse them to reach Perfect, then evolve them to their Ancient form, or Emperorgreymon, and Magnagarurumon, then fuse EG, and MG to form Susanomon. </br></br></br>   your tailmon would never evolve into it's perfect form to taunt you about your flat chest.   <br> temporary evolutions </br>  <br><br>In Tamers as a complete character you have Impmon who is basically a main character with the same level of development as the children.<br><br>Then there's Renamon who always struck me as the most mature and independent of the main Digimon who has quite a personality but nowhere at the same level as Impmon.<br><br>The other two though remain mostly as satellites to Takato and Henry, while Callumon is a plot device.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Crunchy only has dubs and not subs <br>What</br></br>  <br>Guilmon had some development, the one who barely got anything was Terriermon.</br>  <br>Licensed expired and Netflix didn't renew it. I guess it wasn't worth the price.<br><br><br>Crunchyroll and Netflix do not share a parent company, so the series is not being "moved."<br><br><br>CR has the entirety of Xros Wars subbed but the first four seasons are Saban-English dubbed only with no news of the sub versions coming.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's cause Terriermon's personality was fucking momentai, he don't give a fuck</br>  NTR'd, eh?  <br>Poor Joe.<br>He may have shit taste in women but that must have stung.</br></br>  <br>Let's enlarge that so we can see Koushiro getting wet by Taichi with clarity.</br>  <br>Well Netflix subs sucked anyway. Now if they could get the BD version that would be great.</br>  <br>I can't wait for Digimon Tri<br> tfw should Alphamon start killing off the kids, this could very likely happen </br></br>  <br>I really doubt they'll do that.<br><br>And now that you remind me of Alphamon, when the hell will they acknowledge that the Ouryuken is a digimon? <br><br>Every game and shit has Alphamon with that, but they never add Ouryumon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe mystery girl is alphamon and her digimon is a new rookie form for ouryumon.</br>  My favorites were always Izzy and Jou.<br><br>Izzy cause he's who I'd want to be like in their situation, and Jou cause he's who I'd actually be like in their situation.</br></br>   yfw they retcon not 02, but everything involving Ryo <br> OWG, 02 <br> all rendered not canon </br></br>  <br>I hope so, because if the kids were killed off in any way that'd be sad as fuck<br><br> tfw Digimon acknowledging Digimon </br></br></br>  <br><br>Izzy is the one /a/ should self-insert as.<br><br>Definitely not Tai.</br></br></br></br>  <br> I'm NOT your pet. I'm your partner.  <br><br>Ha! My wife says that to me all the time.</br></br></br>  <br> promoting self-insertion </br>  <br>I'd like to insert myself into Mimi if you know what I mean</br>  Spoiler anticipation thread. We're next in line for Chinkscans, they'll probably be out   in 5 minutes    <br>So Stain BTFO's Icyhot?

Thats not shingo.</br>  <br> probably <br>You know he didn't, but I'm sure you noticed Chiyo stalking Kiyoshi to find a way to make sure he isn't a bad guy</br></br>   Before, when Chiyo thought she was fucking the guys  <br>Because in her fucked up world he cant be a bad guy for her assumption of him actually liking sumo.
