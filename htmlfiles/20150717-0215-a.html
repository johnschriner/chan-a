But that MS version does not have that line.</br>  <br>http://www.mangareader.net/bleach/6<wbr>35/3</wbr></br>  <br>What about it?<br><br>I will wait until I see the raw to make judgement.</br></br></br>  <br> Will Hisagi ever begin useful? I don't understand why Kubo still keep him alive. <br>He's most likely dead and or crippled now...It's not his fault Kubo has made his antagonists op as shit</br></br>  Only ichigo even stands a chance against these guys. And their powers are so indirect that he could easily lose.  <br> It's not his fault Kubo has made his antagonists op as shit <br><br>The problem is that he didn't EVEN get to fight them. He always immediately start eating dirt in the initial moment.<br> Superstar <br> Pepe <br> And now, X-axis </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he's a lieutenant, thus is shit-tier in power level<br><br>also superstar wrecked two captains with little effort and pepe was beating byakuya's ass</br></br></br>  <br>That's why I said I don't understand why Kubo still keep him around. Just to be a fodder against new enemies? He didn't even get to reveal his Bankai yet.</br>  <br>I like how the shinigami group is all running together, except they don't seem to care at all that some are outpacing the others, while the stragglers get shot down. This chapter was unusually stupid.</br>  Speaking on legit powerlevels i find it hard Kenpachi and Mayuri can beat the hooded guy (but of course they will). Gremmy almost wrecked Kenpachi and this guy is part of the elite squad has shared power of all the other sternritter in him.  <br><br>Zaraki almost killed pernida in one move.</br></br>  <br> almost killed pernida <br>Not really.</br></br>  <br><br>Cutting the head in half usually does that. <br>The blacksmith killed her with less.</br></br></br>  <br>Gremmy terrified daily dose, he's hardly a push over.<br><br>And Kenny did that with his eye patch on.<br><br>Unfortunately, the idiot has it on again</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Daily dose is terrified by everything</br></br>  <br>I wanted to wipe that smug look off her face. With my wanker.</br>   Set up fight <br> Show some other scene while fight occurs off screen <br> Comes back to the fight <br> One side curbstomped <br><br>This isn't exciting or entertaining in any way, not to mention Kubo's done it so many fucking times already.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Now you know how Bach feels.</br>  <br>It would honestly be a waste of a chapter watching them fight. We can only theorize at this point how ridiculously strong that stupid fucker is.</br>  <br>Sure, but it's also really dumb that they just stormed that place mad, seriously outgunned in every way, just to die after barely surviving Auschwalen.<br>Maybe their plan was to pretend to be dead or something but it seems like a huge waste of time with a stupid plan so far.</br></br>  <br>Fixed</br>   tfw it's impossible to find Yoruichi-related merch in Japan <br>Japan, I am disappoint.</br>  <br>Gremmy scared Daily dose because gremmy was a loose canon psychopath who didn't give a fuck about collateral.</br>  <br>I thought Geremy was the Elite that Daily Dose replaced?</br>  <br>I love how short Liltotto's dress is now. In the beginning, it was much longer.</br>  <br>Ywach fucked her and ruptured her womb<br><br>GiGi couldn't even get past the throat fucking</br></br></br>  <br>What is dead may never die, she's a zombie.</br>  <br>Didn't you know? All of FemRitters are actually dudes.</br>  <br>Uncomfirmed.</br>  It's a jobber's paradise.   Unohana sacrifices herself so Kenpachi can stop jobbing <br> He keeps jobbing anyway <br><br>They would have been better off keeping her as a healer.</br></br></br>  <br> broken arm <br> still standing and can fight <br>That's not jobbing. Kenny is doing much better than Yoruichi.</br></br></br>  I'm pretty sure Orihime will actually have a somewhat important role in the upcoming fight with Askin.  <br> Orihime will actually have a somewhat important role </br>  <br>Have faith in Kubo, anon-kun.<br><br>I know it makes you feel good inside hating Orihime, but it's a legitimate possibility.</br></br></br>  <br><br> I doubt, even Aizen laughed and said upfront he never had any use for her power, and juha bach could just use his allmighty to fuck her.<br><br> Orihime stopped being useful the instant she could not heal ichigo in the ulquiorra fight.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>"What are you gonna do Yhwach- take away my schrift, huh?"<br><br>"I would never do that. Let me ask you, child....which of your digestive organs do you enjoy using the most"?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There's a bunch of things that you have wrong, but I'll ignore that for now.<br><br>I'm not talking about Orihime and her fight against the strongest characters of Bleach, I'm talking about her (potential) fight with Askin.</br></br></br>  What exactly is cruel about seeing the future if bach can change it anyway  <br>As I walk through the streets of the Court of Pure Souls<br>I take a look at my body and realize its full of holes<br>'Cause I've been lyin' and jobbin' so long that<br>Even my captain commander thinks that my mind is gone<br><br>But I ain't never crossed a hollow that didn't deserve it<br>Me be treated like a flunky, you know that's unheard of<br>You better watch how ya talking and where ya walking<br>Or you and your quincies might be lined in chalk<br><br>I really hate to trip but I gotta croak<br>As they draw, I see myself in the reishi smoke, fool<br>I'm the kind of G that little shinigami wanna be like<br>On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the soul king's light<br><br>Been spending most our lives<br>Living in a jobber's paradise</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Remember how it was foreshadowed that his bankai was going to be important?<br><br>Apparently Kubo doesn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Oh I've seen you before. Ranting and raving about her potential to have "potential". You're obviously extremely biased when talking about Orihime. Every character has a theoretical potential, buddy. Just because what she does seems good on paper doesn't mean much after she's been useless for so ridiculously long.</br>  Why do you people complain that kubo is taking care of side characters, nobody fucking wants to read 7 v 100  What was even the fucking point of sparing the sternritter if they were just going to job off screen anyway and accomplish nothing? Yhwach could have just killed all of them whether they hid from the light or not, and nothing would have changed.   <br>We got Jugrams flashback thanks to it</br>  <br> ignore everything i say and shit post instead <br>Nice one, anon.<br><br>While it's true that she does have unlimited potential due to her powers, it's unrealistic to think that she'll be able to utilize her powers to the fullest extent.<br><br>However, it is completely reasonable to expect that Orihime will be relevant in the upcoming fight, especially against Askin.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why would he even introduce them to the story then? <br><br>It'd be better to let them remain useless, not reintroduce them and have them immediately one shot.</br></br></br>  <br>I wasn't the anon you were talking to before. I just said that out of the blue because you have these delusions of how strong Orihime could be. Also calling a post you don't like a shitpost doesn't make it so. If anything you would be the one shitposting since you bring up this topic time and time again. Everyone's telling you you're silly/wrong but for some reason you can't take the evidence piled against you for an answer. Yeah man, Orihime can totally probably just reverse time entirely, or maybe even travel through it right? It's not absurd for her powers to branch out into something like that right?<br>I get what you're thinking, mainly because you've explained it before, but it really is stupid why you're so insistent on thinking Orihime will do something. She doesn't really train and unless she has some kind of typical magical shonen near death flashback and comes to as a time wizard, then i'm pretty sure nothing will. <br><br>I swear, you're going to be here until the series ends going on about how Orihime is the best.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, I haven't been here for months, but okay.<br><br>I've never implied that she could do anything like that. All I said was that she could become useful in the upcoming fight against not Yhwach, but Askin.<br><br>Her powers will be useful in this specific matchup.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was hoping she'd be smart enough to re-pledge herself to Yhwach and see if he could share some of his crazy powers. She'd still probably die, but she had to have known that wouldn't work.</br>  <br>tfw no dialogue</br>  It's out by the way  This Hashbrown x Combustion Renji storyline is way more interesting than anything Kubo's written in years.<br><br> Burner boy feels sorry for Hasbrown being weak and all <br> Hashbrown doesn't like that burner pities him <br> Hashbrown was the true OG all along <br> Burner doesn't like that the guy he pitied as worthless is now dominating him <br> Feels less like two childhood friends battling it out and more like two men who've seen some shit and acknowledged they were pretty shitty people when they were younger but deep down neither bears the other any ill will because of all the shit they went through together <br> But after decades of buildup you can't just let that shit slide, so you duke it out to see who really is the better quincy </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A healer cleansing poison sounds completely reasonable.<br>It's how he lost the first time, though that's not how his powers are supposed to work.</br></br>   Gigi is dead <br>Fuck Everything...</br>  <br>RIP my cute loli nazi ;_;</br>  <br>someone spam Kubo with this panel and hopefully he will retcon some bullshit to revive him</br>  <br> Gigi heals himself with his own blood <br> tongue is in a pool of blood <br><br>Maybe not, but yeah, why did Kubo even bother bringing those two up to the palace? Did he think people were expecting THEM to hurt Yhwach and that him one shotting them was surprising?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Kubo is a hack and needed to get rid of characters fast so he can focus on the mains</br>  <br>Didn't he just get shot in the arm though?</br>  <br>the X-axis power shoots through anything in it's line of fire, blowing a clean hole. He did not just get shot in the arm, it went right through his vital organs and out the other side with a perfectly round flesh wound</br>  <br> yfw she's actually alive or revives herself with her blood <br> she kills Jewha while he's asleep </br></br>  BAZZ<br>GIGI<br>LILTOTTO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</br></br>  I've avoided Game of Thrones cause characters you've learned to like (more or less) keep dying, only for something like that to happen to Bleach. Great choice in series I have.  i was hoping the quincy survivors would stay till the very end and live normal lives after all this bullshit finally comes to an end. I wanted to see Liltotto live happily with an elder man that would provide for her.  <br>Yeah it's pretty dreary how the background keeps dying all the time.</br>  <br>I was expecting them being the token faction survivors so Ichigo can do his "i don't care who you are, let's all live in peace" thing<br><br> I still have some little hope ;_; </br></br></br>  <br> Gigi heals herself <br> zombifies Lil <br> she bites a chunk out of Yhwach <br> soul king juice revives her <br> they run like hell before he can finish waking up </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My question is how did they arrive at Bach / Hashbrown's place so much faster than the shinigami. Didn't they like arrive at the royal palace at the same time through the door they made?</br>  <br>Daily reminder that Mashiro disappeared after this "training" and was never seen or mentioned again.</br>  <br>I thought of this for a while and this is my guess for what they were planning:<br>Bach needs to sleep every once in a while, and during that time his powers transfer to Haschwalth. But if they kill Haschwalth, his powers don't have anywhere to go, and he'll either be vulnerable or otherwise fucked over. So Liltotto and Giselle went to fuck up Bach while Bazz B took down Haschwalth, except he got his ass handed to him and they got wrecked.</br></br>  <br>Her bankai makes her invisible :^)</br>   Bring back the Bleach anime.     <br>I think a lot of people were deterred because of the fullbring arc.<br> I really fucking hate that arc it sucked so bad holy shit </br></br>  <br>You're a dense one, huh. It clearly shows in the chapter that they split up. The elite sternritter are very limited in number, and they've all got their own objectives.<br><br>Additionally, the elite sternritter are unaware that the lower group has been betrayed and abandoned, they don't see any reason to hinder their movements.<br><br>Now, you tell me why should they have any trouble at all getting to Bach long before everyone else?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Must have learned that from her captain Kensei. He disappeared completely right after unveiling his bankai against Wonderweiss too.</br>  <br> Lil <br> stomach wound <br>I think Ywatch has taken their letter powers.. forcefully.<br>In a similar way than what he did against Monkbro<br><br><br>They were shown a few chapters before going through a sekkrit Sun Gate to the Palace</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jugo had the Almighty Eyes right now, so looks like they got wrecked by base level Ywatch.<br><br>They probably didn't account for him eating the goddamn Spirit King</br></br></br>  <br>.....Bazz and Lilitto fought and jobbed before the Gotei groups were waylaid by the Elite Sternritters, which only happened this chapter (with the exception of Grimjaw, and they weren't with Grimjaws group, they were with the Gotei)</br>  <br>I have a problem with shounen shows. Call it an addiction. I have basically transcended past hating the flawed parts of an anime adaption and through drinking I ravel in them. Hell no matter how bad it gets I still keep up with  naruto . <br><br>It fascinates me to see how far the rabbit hole goes with these series, One Piece included. I especially love when its "so bad its good". <br><br>Getting back to Bleach I liked the Fullbring arc I thought the series was trying to get back to something a bit more simple and all the while being still enjoyably convoluted. At the end of the day if you sit through 200 or 300 episodes of a series might as well watch the next 200 or 300 episodes. Especially if you manage to catch up to the current episodes.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Not that it makes any difference.</br>  <br>Ah this make sense, just found the chapter</br>  <br>Last we saw him he was a zombie.</br>  <br>I was talking about the Fake Karakura arc. He was up against Wonderweiss the arrancar, unveiled his bankai on the last page of a chapter, then completely disappeared for 2 arcs. No fight, defeated scene or anything, just poof.<br><br>And oh his opponent Wonderweiss appeared not long after to fight Yama, so you can imagine what happened to him.</br></br></br>  <br>RIP<br><br>  Id still tap dat boipucci  </br></br></br>  <br>Could the X axis beat accelerator? His ability literally puts holes in whatever he points his gun at.</br>  <br>Accel can beat teleport. Take that as you will.</br>  <br>But could either of them defeat Madara Uchiha?</br>    <br>Even in (un)death, (s)he is still sexual</br>  I'm looking forward to some Kenpachi-Mayuri comedic relief  How is it that Isane is NOT a zombie?   this chapter <br>goddamn it</br>  <br><br>The Fullbring arc was really fucking good. Shut your whore mouth, fag. <br><br>It's because of people with shit taste like yours that it was cut short. It would have been a lot better if it were allowed to fully develop its plot points, characters, and fights. But instead Kubo was forced to rush through everything because of ADHD adolescent boys and manchildren throwing a collective tantrum over Ichigo no longer being a demigod that could curbstomp other demigods. <br><br>I guess that really ruined the self-insert power fantasy for the betamale fanbase that is the scourge of shonen manga for the rest of us. <br><br>Fuck you. I'm not even mad. In fact, I'm still laughing really fucking hard because of <br>this picture.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't care about Ichigo's powerlessness. The full bringers were fags. <br> You should apologise to me </br></br>  <br><br>O-Okay. <br><br>S-sorry man. <br><br> Really I liked the Fullbringers for the most part, but Jackie Tristan was utter garbage. Yukio was also pretty bad. Riruka and Giriko were so-so. I loved Tuskishima and Ginjo; and Shishigawara was fucking based as fuck. Don't tell me you didn't like Lucky Punch. <br><br>Also I've always wanted Chad to get more character development. He's a pretty cool guy. He's like a more realistic approach to what would happen if a highschooler got ghost powers and tried to keep up with guys who've had ghost powers for centuries. It only makes sense for him to get his ass kicked, and he actually does really well in his fights considering his age.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Also you being that poster is too fucking rich. I think I just died.</br></br>  <br>You're easy to please.</br>  <br><br>Your picture reminds me too much of my dad which made me laugh uncontrollably for several minutes.</br></br>  <br>Your dad is on fire and angry? That doesn't sound fun.</br>  <br>Bleach would have been infinitely better as a seinan focused on half the total number of characters. <br><br>Debate.</br></br></br>   Gigi, Liltotto, Bazz and Hisagi are all dead <br>T-thanks Kubo.</br>  <br>God Tier:<br>-Facebook<br>-Rabbit Lolita<br><br>High Tier:<br>-Bon Jovi<br>-777<br><br>OK but Forgetable Tier:<br>-Jackie<br>-Yukio<br><br>Literally Meme Tier:<br>-TIME TELLS NO LIES / A BUNCH OF BRUTAL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hashbrown never wanted to fight.

Too bad he had to kick Black's ass to get it.</br>  <br>So that Ryuken can revive them with heretical Quincy techniques</br>   lil and gigi jobbed offscreen and died <br> grimjob ran straight into askin's attack <br> no one even noticed that hisagi was shot and killed <br>that's hilarious</br></br></br>  <br> Combustion Renji <br>my sides are on fire</br></br>  <br>I bet we're getting the classic sniper scene of Hisagi wounded on the ground, asking for help, then the medic (Isane) going to help him but being stopped by someone  or killed  because Lille is using Hisagi as bait to kill those who go help him</br>  <br> Daily Dose </br>    <br>Daily dose is extremely careful with everything, Gremmy still jobbed to him.</br>   tfw your waifu dies <br>I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.</br>  <br>Count me in.</br>  <br>Gremmy, not Grimmjow<br><br>Gremmy didn't even interact with Askin<br>And Askin hasn't even fought Kenpachi so no jobbing</br></br></br></br>  <br>She lives in our Heart anon<br> Gigi w-will get up and save them, r-right? ;_; <br><br>Saw it coming a mile away, though, fuck you Kubo</br></br></br></br>  Hisagi's becoming the reverse Byakuya.Black guys hate him.  <br>I wish we could get some background info on her and Gigi, we know nothing about them<br><br>Hell we don't even know how Gigi works and what their vollstandig did</br></br></br>  Kubo pls  <br>Funny thing, Vollstandig suddenly stopped absorbing reishi from the surroundings to powerup themselves once the SS invasion started.</br>  <br> gigi dies <br> everyone who was zombified returns to normal as a result <br>Huzzah, we got losers like Rose and Hitsugaya back. But at what cost?</br></br></br>  <br>Rose and Kensei are probably still dead, maybe even Mashiro. Hitsugaya should be alive though, so japan might be rejoicing.</br>  <br>From the looks of it Giselle was trying to feed when dying.<br>As it didn't work I assume power was taken back, which begs the question - if it's with Yhwach are the effects still there, or not?</br></br>  Did Kubo just offscreen-job Hisagi onscreen???  <br>Kubo is trying to pioneer as many new off-screen techniques as possible before his manga ends.</br>  <br>He's just severely wounded. Just like Kira.</br>  <br>kira was confirmed dead, bruh</br>  <br> Just like Kira. </br>  Why isn't Ichigo on the  Quincy side and have Quincy powers like his mum?   <br>By who? If you meant the "reatsu lost" thing, alot of people was said to be "cannot sense his/her reatsu" in the manga but turn out to be alive later, like Rukia and Mashiro</br>  <br>  character doesn't die when killed several times <br>  ends up dying after getting killed offscreen <br><br>It's Nurarihyon from Gantz all over again.</br></br></br></br>  <br>"Daggers" published during hiatus.<br><br><br>I can't even begin.</br></br></br></br>    <br><br><br>Did you all somehow miss the fact that it was Yhwach that off'd her? Even if he didn't just take her powers away first, his Almighty would nullify them anyway.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh ok thanks. Is this like a canon recap sheet?</br></br>  <br><br>I was being sarcastic.</br></br>  <br>Yes, it was printed in WSJ.</br>  <br>they were published during the 5week hiatus in place of bleach chapters. There are 5 sets, the first 4 have 3 pages each, the final one had 4 pages.</br>  <br>Can he even do that ? The almighty cancelling power isn't really clear. If it really fully worked on Ichibe the guy couldn't have used his power to come back to life.</br>  <br>Almighty does not nullify powers, it shows you the perfect way to counteract them. The effects of the blood won't work on living Quincies after all, so it's useless against Yhwach. Gigi should've brought more zombies.</br>  <br>to be fair i don't think there's really any consistent or coherent method to it at the moment other than it doing whatever the hell kubo wants it to do encounter by encounter. But the one thing it does consistently is make Yhwach op.</br>  Maybe Ywatch took back what he gave to them when they got recruited<br><br>Lil has a stomach wound<br>Gigi looks bleed out and empty</br></br></br>  <br>Yhwach just handwaved and shrugged off all of Ichibei's strongest attacks. He didn't dodge, work around or through a loop hole, or counter them with other powers, he just got hit and then they did nothing. The voice trick was the one thing he had a legit work around for.</br>  <br> gluttony <br> huge stomach wound <br>It all points to her death, but I don't want to believe it.</br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't what he give them the vollstandig ? I'm pretty sure their powers are personal, just like a zanpakuto. Jugo awakened Bazz B's powers, but the fire finger shit is his own. Let's add their powers fit their personalities.</br>  <br>To be fair, Ichibei also broke his Blut Vene defense and countered Ywatch trying to absorb him<br><br>Ywatch having to shot himself to go back to the fight was also a workaround</br></br></br>  <br>That's not true, Yhwach charged him, guarded, counterattacked and even tried to steal his powers. Ichibei's strongest attack did not connect because Yhwach blasted him to bits before it came to that. The overcame the rename by overpowering it with his released power.</br>  <br>I guess she bit off more than she could chew :^)<br><br> kill me </br></br></br>  <br>Its too bad Kubo hasn't told us shit about ANY of the sternritter. Its almost like he made more characters than he could actually manage</br>  <br>We've just left a flashback of Bazz-B and Hashwalth. We've seen Yhwach coming to dying As Nodt.</br>  <br>Is her powers really that shit? Like really "Make my mouth really big" level of shit? How does quincy powers even do that anyway, I thought they manipulated reishi outside the body.</br>  <br>HE WAS NEVER GOING TO HAVE BANKAi when wil you people get that through your god damn heads<br><br>In a war where the average captain WITH BANKAI was made worthless in the face of the average stern ritter what do you think some random vice captain could do with a newly acquired bankai</br></br></br>  <br>It's probably the shittiest power, I'm surprised she has survived this far.<br><br>Maybe she gets a powerup from eating people, who knows, that would balance it</br></br></br>  <br> yfw next chapter starts with Kenpachi getting rekt <br> at some point we see a close-up of hisagi's dead face <br> flashback <br> Hisagi explains Mr.69 that he has no bankai, but swears that he'll be useful <br> 69 smiles and assures him that both of them will take the enemy's down <br> back in the present time <br> a single tear drop runs down his check <br> Editor's note: Even dreams crush in front of the mighty quincy!!

Why was he in the hospital? Why did Yhwach give enough of a shit to come see him and give him a power? Kubo still didn't tell us shit<br><br>Bazz-B and Haschwalt is the exception to the rule, and that only just happened, what, 150 chapters into the arc? And we only got the backstory of two people? What about the other 24?</br></br></br>  <br>As nodt does this and youre concerned about hwo liltotto makes her mouth big?</br>  <br> Editor's note: Even dreams crush in front of the mighty quincy!! Hisagi falls!! <br>Editor's notes are always so silly that it's actually possible.</br></br>  <br><br>Buzz buzz bee, lil' loli, and Jizz found out that the gate of the sun had still existed in Wahrwelt and used it to portal straight near (or in) the castle.</br></br>  <br><br> Voice based telekinesis.</br></br>  <br> you will never see The Fear animated </br>  <br>To start there's the Schrift itself. "Compulsory" in English is fairly self explanatory, but as we all know Kubo has his weird writing system for things like this. While the katakana reads phonetically as<br> Za Ko n' Pa Ru So Rii <br>the Kanji is written out as<br> 強制執行 <br>a combination of the two compound words 強制(Compulsion) and 執行(Execute). Execute as in "to carry out" not as in "to kill."</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>But that doesn't seem to be related to her eating powers. She was very clever and thoughtful, too. And she saved Gigi (for nothing)<br><br>And then Kubo sends them to die against the final boss, like they were soldiers in Age of Empires or other RTS game.<br>fucking Kubo<br><br>Also Hisagi, holy fuck Kubo really uses any opportunity to shit on him<br> Mashiro shitting on him <br> Superstar <br> Pepe <br> Lile <br>dude can't catch a break</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ebola.<br><br>But seriously, I don't feel we need much of the backstories.<br>Jew Hitler came and conscripted whoever he wanted, often with "do or die" scenarios.<br><br>I just need confirmation that he chose Sternritter based on "deficiencies", or whatever other word in English means they lacked or longed for something more than anyone else. And he could fill that void.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>oh woops forgot my image</br>  <br>At least Kubo is realistic Vice captains like hisagi have no place in this war and they will fall at the hands of those who do<br><br>Unlike in fucking Naruto where a fly can survive against god</br></br></br>  <br>Pernida is probably some kind of telekinetic fuckup that can command things to execute actions, like commanding an arm to "break"<br><br>Something in the lines of Ransoutengai and Sklaverei. Also Pepe and Tsukishima.</br></br></br>  <br><br>then lets look at some instances of Pernida using her/his powers. The first time it's to crumple Shutara's giant cloth ninja thing. She mumbles in elipises exhales with a "fushyaaaaaa~" sound effect, and then the enemy contorts with a series of sharp BAKU BAKU popping sounds.</br></br>  <br>But that's not really his body is it? I can see his body hanging out of his mouth. Still Quincy powers sure took a huge upgrade this arc after being irrelevant after the Espada came around</br>  <br>go read one piece if you want everyone to survive</br>  Ginjo will never be relevant again, huh  <br>Liltotto's stomach wound and Gigi ending up bloodless keeps foreshadowing it</br>  <br> Kubo is realistic  <br> trained soldiers have no place in war </br></br>  <br> Sees his body hanging out of his mouth <br><br>Asks is it his body</br></br></br>  <br>This has the fairly straight forward implication of just spoken commands and the ability to enforce them. Although there's the odd issue of her only using her powers to crumple enemies thus far. The second time using it to clean up what appeared to be Shutara's body. There are a mix of sound effects but mostly popping and squishing sounds.</br>  <br> trained soldiers have no place in war <br>Sending a man armed with a sword to fight a nuclear warhead is stupid.<br><br>But I guess that is still war.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She says stuff then that stuff happens.

Rather than only choosing to become Sakura's hero or fulfill his ideals as an Ally of Justice on the ninth day of Heaven's Feel, Shirou would have also had an option to become Ilya's hero instead. However due to the length, they thought to release Saber and Rin as Fate/stay night and Sakura and Ilya in a separate release titled "Fate/other night", but they thought it would have been too expensive. Ilya's route was instead combined with Heaven's Feel because they decided to include Sakura's route in Fate/stay night.<br><br>Nasu is a faggot who choose Sakura over Illya.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Actually be relevant.
