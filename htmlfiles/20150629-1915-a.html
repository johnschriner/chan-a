[ This is from the 7th episode of Nisemonogatari<br><br>Why the fuck did he come home to his sisters naked sleeping together? <br><br>Am I missing something I dont understand<br><br>Or is this fan service</br></br></br></br></br></br>  at their age, the girls want to experiment with their bodies  The sisters are lovers and their boyfriends are made up  <br>Pointless fanservice. Autistic nisio buttbuddies will try to tell you that there's a deep symbolism in it. Ignore them.</br>  <br>Can there be pointless fanservice? <br>I can't imagine any heterosexual male disliking nude women in their animes.</br></br>  Something similar to this happened https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=ZlD<wbr>A2LCsBYo,</wbr>  [ ] things just went a little farther and they ended up naked and sleepy.<br><br>But it was obviously a product of lusting after their brother's c*ck.</br></br>  <br>It's almost as if Monogatari is a shitty anime that panders to perverts</br>  <br>Go back to /r/anime</br>  <br>I do when it's only there to make 13 year old boys feel a tingle in their pants. It detracts from the story.</br>  Is there a summer 2015 chart floating around?<br>Either way, what are you going to spend your summer watching?</br>  <br>No, the people who make the charts all opted not to make them anymore.</br>  There is literally a relevant website for the information you seek written in English on the image you posted.  Is it so hard to just screencap some anime chart?  That orbital strike was a thing of beauty.<br><br>Yuhata's the bomb.</br></br>  <br>I might have been a mostly anime-original content episode, but man was it done right.<br><br>Didn't really fuck with the story at all, expanded a bit on the characters and their motivations, added some cool scenes in, and left ample material for a season 3.<br><br>Great way to finish up the season.</br></br></br></br></br>  Season 3 pls Polygon.   UCHIKUDAKEEEEEE comes back for the credits roll   <br>SEASON THREE FUCKING WHEN?<br><br>I SWEAR I NEED MORE, DON'T YOU FUCKING DARE TELL ME THAT RECAP AT THE END WITH OP1 MEANT CLOSURE FOR THE SERIES</br></br></br>  No Yuhata being stoked for you.<br><br>I never asked for this.</br></br>  <br>Anime Lem IX isn't filled with creepy gauna bugs and creatures but instead a lot of gauna hairy balls. But if Polygon only has this much money to animate balls and comes up with a cool way to exterminate them all in one swoop then I'm fine with that.</br>  <br>Happy Izana is the best Izana, after all those sufferings.</br>  <br>There was that one creepy as fuck motherfucker that chased Izana and the other dude though.</br>  Too bad tsunbot didn't make it this season.<br><br>Although, that might have been a good thing. S3, if there ever was going to be a S3, would be harem shit.</br></br>  Is Season 2 going to be on Netflix? dubbed too?  <br>This fourth of July, yes. You can't have enough of JYB and Sheh.</br>  <br>I don't think there is enough content</br>  <br>Content is not an issue, I can certainly wait a couple of years before a new season, but it's the fact of not knowing if there'll be another season plus the uncertainty that's left by that recap of both seasons at the very end that make me want to kill myself.</br>  <br> I don't think there is enough content <br>Really? If you are being sarcastic to the kid, it's difficult to tell.<br><br>I mean, fuckin' really? Not enough content?</br></br></br></br>  <br>There is, but the current arc in the manga needs to be finished first.</br>  <br>It's more of Polygon wants to end its 2-years planned anime properly first, then considers future projects later.</br>  <br>They're peeing in this scene right?</br>  <br>Which episode was that scene in?</br>  <br>Pretty sure this is just the catheters going in.<br><br>It's probably not a super comfortable experience.</br></br></br>   Nagate got some of that nice Gauna mouth in him. <br>I'm jealous.</br>  <br>Man, the ass design of the female models is so fucking perfect, literally the best ass ever</br>  <br>Not really true. They got a lot of the harem shit out of the way this season.</br>  <br>Post piss drinking</br>  It's such a good time to be a Captainfag.  <br>Ep 1 or 2 of season 1</br>  I don't fucking care if Izana and Tsugumi fags are dominating these threads, but I FUCKING MISS HOSHIJIRO. All those flashes of her at the final ED continues to remind me how much I like her. She is such sincere person and actually had skills too. I wish Nihei brings her PERSONALITY back as I don't believe she can be alive in anyway. I don't even care if she doesn't win the Tanikazebowl, I just want to see her smile again.<br><br>Goddamn it.</br></br>  <br>Have you not noticed how goddamn loud the animeonly Hoshijirofags have been lately? They're almost drowning out the Tsumugifags.</br>  <br>Lately is not when I've been around. Almost means they're not the loudest either.</br>  <br> they're not the loudest <br>So? I'm just pointing out that they have a presence like everybody else. They're not some poor oppressed group.</br></br>  don't mind me, just being best girl  So how well does Sidonia do in Japan?  <br>So the battle will still go on. How can the rest of assault fleets achieve anything with all casualties at this point?<br><br>Death to Smoogy would be entertain to watch though.</br></br></br>  <br>Which unfortunately was completely forgotten minutes later. Everyone seems to now assume the planet secured.</br>  Why?  <br>I'm curious about this myself.</br>  <br>We're probably going to see Izana and the rest of the recon fleet show up soon, so they should at least have the numbers to retreat without getting completely BTFO. I'm also betting on Tsumugi dying either protecting Izana or as she and Nagate watch helplessly.</br>  <br>She'll come back.</br>  <br>How many times is she gonna die?</br>  The end is near.  What does this mean?  <br><br><br><br>I guess that kinda answers it.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>The second Chimera</br></br>  <br><br>Have you read the manga? <br><br>Did you watch the finale in its entirety? It was quite literally staring you in the face.</br></br></br></br>  <br> implying the ride will end </br>  <br>It's going to have a direct continuation sequel with the more accurate title 'Moe Alien Penis Monster of Sidonia'.</br>  <br> not Toxine's Tiny Sewer Adventure <br><br>0/10 wouldn't read</br></br></br>  <br>Personally I'd prefer 'Tit-Growing Suffering Cyborg Tales' but we can't always have what we want. Nihei is making fucking sure of that.</br>  All smiles here. <br><br><br><br>Oh, right. My bad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>What's the maximum possible suffering at this point that ensures all waifufags pull their hair out?</br>  <br>Watching her heart shatter into tiny pieces after she sees Tsumugi, Yuhata and the Captain fucking Nagate at the same time.</br>  <br>Probably homo end with Kunato, but that's letting fujoshis have a completely random win so it's not a good idea.</br>  <br>This. The reaction was bad enough when Tsumugi had a poorly foreshadowed pull ahead.</br>  <br>Funded.</br>  <br>So if izana detatched the head from the body, what was tanikaze sitting in?</br>  What chapter would you guys guess the manga will end on? I think around 90.  <br>All the waifus die. Nagate marries a genderbent clone of himself.</br>  <br>Toxine wins the Nagatebowl.<br><br>She isn't even interested in him so that would piss off EVERYONE.</br></br></br>  <br>100 views of Sidonia.</br>  <br>wait has the manga ended already? shouldn't there be a huge overhead for this?</br>  <br>Completely forgot about.How many sights have we seen so far?</br>  <br>I bet Nihei is dragging this shit just so he can have those 100 sights to compile as a special color booklet later on.</br>  <br>no it hasnt</br>  <br><br>Season 3's an eternal curse.<br><br>From Haruhi to Spice and Wolf then to Horizon etc. etc. all never get season 3. It's like an unwritten rule somewhere to never do season 3.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he get gauna aids?</br>  Polygon you better have enough sales so you give us a season 3.  Did I remember correctly but is that smiling Hoshijiro in the MAD/ED actually Tsumugi? I don't think that has been shown in the anime yet? Flag for season 3?  Yep, sexually frustrated.<br><br><br>His cockpit you stupid fucking communist. <br><br><br>Placenta is uninhabitable to STIs. All good.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She planted an egg.</br>  <br>He simply came.</br>  <br>No, but he did get a ahegao.</br>  <br> Meanwhile at High School DxD. </br>  <br> his cockpit <br><br>then how was he flying the ship if the cockpit was detached?</br></br></br>  <br>Were they going for a corrupted version of the standard shoujo manga flowers-blooming-lace-frame-sparkly<wbr>-romance-scene thing here?</wbr></br>  <br>And it was mediocre at best. You want to sully the greatness of those series with a mediocre 3rd season?</br>  <br>I like the space flower ebolaids vagina flowers</br>  <br>Would you stop being a retard already?</br>  <br>This fucking moron</br>  <br>Why wont Kouichi submit his male urges on her?</br>  <br>I blame pilot episode special numbers<br><br>usually when a TV show, particularly cartoons gets its air, they get 26 pilot episodes or some where around 26. Spice and wolf had 25 I believe, 12 in S1, 13 in S2</br></br></br>  <br>Outlaw Star had 26 episodes aswell, and never saw a season 2. The 26th episode ends with "Tune in next time...!" but there never was one</br>  <br>Tsuruuchi aside, females are the only ones to have a strong libido in sidonia.</br>  <br>It's not being called a cockpit for no reason.</br>  <br> Oh fuck my robot is infected! <br> quick detach the cockpit! <br> detach the cockpit <br> how do I fly ship if cockpit is not attached? </br></br></br></br>  <br> High School DxD <br> Greatness <br><br>When did this happen?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll spell it out for you. The cockpit isn't in the head.<br><br><br>I was jesting, f-for real!</br></br></br></br>  <br>It didnt unless you have shit standards.</br>  <br> tune in next time! <br> there never was a next time <br>;_;<br><br> 1999 was 15 years ago </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I mean, if you are spending all of your time fighting placenta, you might not want to make very meaningful relationships.<br><br>Look what happened to Akai</br></br></br>  <br> The cockpit was detached <br>Come on, guardians are the same basic shape as every giant robot ever.</br></br>  <br>Then if tanikaze is sitting in the cockpit<br><br>and they told him to detach the cockpit to stop the guana from infectin him further<br><br>and he detached the cockpit<br><br>and the head flies off the body<br><br>but the head is not the cockpit<br><br>how does detaching the head stop the guana from infecting the body?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What Izana detached was the head, not the cockpit. The gauna was finding its way in via the damaged head.</br>  <br>then why even have a head on the body?</br>  <br> detach the cockpit <br><br>Pretty sure they didn't say that.</br></br></br>  <br>The head is the hyggs cannon.</br>  <br><br>jesus christ how retarded can you be</br></br>  <br>Cause it looks cool and you can't see out of your chest.</br>  <br><br>They never say detach the cockpit. They say to close the head airlock or something. The Gauna tentacles are getting in through the head/neck area. The cockpit is in the chest region, (which you would know if you had been paying any attention to the show and/or manga). Jettisoning the head and sealing the airlock in the neck area severed the tentacles connecting the placenta in the cockpit from the body of Benisuzume, <br><br>Fuck anon you are retarded.</br></br></br></br>  <br>when was the last time that nigga used that higgs cannon before he got the gun?</br>  <br>Don't even think of it as a head. Think of it as a cannon. It serves practical mechanical functions for the gardes. It's not a piece of eye candy.</br>  <br>They use it constantly. It helps eat through placenta, as well as being easier to keep on target than the railgun.</br>  <br>Do you even watch the show? Stop acting retarded.</br>  <br><br><br>why is the cockpit in the body and not the head? put the cockpit in the head then the cannon in the body and it'd be better and like stuff</br></br></br>  <br>the bleach is above the dryer</br>  I actually think this show is kind of decent for what it is. It takes the basic girl meets supernatural boy self-insert plot and freshens it up a little with some reasonably good characters and a good storyline. It's kinda anime for 16 year old girls, but it's pretty quality as far as anime for teen girls goes. It's certainly better than Inuyasha, which the biggest member of this genre.  Nice blog, subscribed.  <br>Good for you, but your blogpost is on the wrong, wrong website.</br>  Woah are we about to see a proper anime discussion thread?<br> If so, I'm reporting this in order to protect the shitpost. </br>   posts discussion thread without blatantly wording it such that the inbred weebs can tell that it's a discussion thread <br><br>Enjoy the retards spewing "nice blog".</br></br>  <br><br>Wow, you're right. People actually can't tell that this is a discussion thread. That's...fascinating.<br>This is a discussion thread, guys.</br></br></br>  <br> backpedaling this hard </br>  <br>Just wait for season 2. It only gets better.</br>  <br>Is there any romantic development ?</br>  <br>No, it's clearly a discussion thread, and I'm legitimately interested in why you can't tell.</br>  Why people like to use "self-insert" here to describe anime? Honestly, it's one of the /a/'s buzzwords that I hate the most besides "edgy" and "gary stu".  <br>Well, this anime IS a self-insert, and to be honest I don't even mean that as a bad thing. I like self-insert anime.</br>  <br>It's weird, when this show was airing I wasn't really that big of a fan. I watched it, and it was entertaining enough, but I felt like Bones just had a lot more in them. I think it spun its wheels too much with the whole sword boy angsty teen arc without much payout.<br><br>Now I'm sitting here thinking, "you know, more of that sounds pretty nice". The world was pretty interesting and is well animated, so I'd definitely watch more when S2 airs.</br></br></br>  <br>That's definitely how I feel. To be honest, I feel like this is kind of the epitome of teenager shows. It's quality teenager entertainment, which is something that's only seen once in a blue moon. I wish this show was around when I was younger so I could be nostalgic about it. Even as an adult, watching it makes me faintly nostalgic for nothing.<br>I enjoy the feeling and I am looking forward to S2.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, I don't really have strong feelings about the show in general, so there isn't really much for me to say except what I said before; it was pretty breezy fun in a season that was weak. If it had aired during a stronger season I probably would have dropped it and not really thought about it much again. I've listened to the OP a few times though, it was pretty catchy!<br><br>I think Witch Craft Works did what it was trying to do better for me that season. I felt like it cared more about its characters and didn't ever fall flat of what it was aiming for. It was a silly, but had more style than Noragami. I was pleasantly surprised by it.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate forced animation and niwaka the most.</br>  <br>I agree. WCW was pretty good. Not great, but did it a lot better. Maybe it's just because I like GFD more than everygirl.</br>  <br>I don't remember any</br>  <br>Tanpopo is happiness.<br><br><br>forced drama and boring are my least favorite. Look at the Euphonium thread now, it's just silly at this point</br></br></br></br>   whiny kid for almost the entire season <br> enjoyable  <br> not even a kissu at the end <br>shit taste confirmed</br></br></br>  Reminder that the anime only covered 12 chapter of the manga since it focused on the whiny fucking brat for no reason. Just finished it because of the delicious cat girl.  <br>Is the manga complete? It looks like something that could be entertaining to read.</br>  beating your kids is OK: the anime.<br><br>Also, he got beat when he was alive and constantly lived under the control his douchebag father, only to die and live under the control of some other douchebag and get beaten. Kinda tragic.</br></br>  <br>Its still ongoing</br>  <br>Because amerifats are used to watching garbage with complete non-characters who can't be related to whatsoever<br><br>Any character with notably relatable human traits is clearly meant to be a self-insert for SOMEONE</br></br></br>  <br>Not complete, but still pretty entertaining. Monthly releases are a bitch though.</br>   5x chapters <br> no relationship <br><br>don't get your hopes up with the 2nd season</br></br></br>  inb4 anonwhyareyousuckaloser.jpg  <br> anime for 16 year old girls <br>I doubt that, unless it aired in an odd timeslot I'm not aware of.</br></br>  How can they make a second season? They fucked up with that anime original end.  Hiyori is a miracle of the universe.  <br>It's written by a pair of women. It is indeed one of those "shounen but for girls" shows like Inuyasha.</br>  <br>The show's just an advertisement for the manga, I think the manga's targeted at the girl's shounen audience but I doubt the anime's targeted at anyone in particular, since 16 year old girls won't stay up that late to watch it.</br>  <br>I just said "show" as a generic interchangable word for the series as a whole.</br>   this show for girls <br>topkek, the shit tastes of some people. probably those are the fags that post in naruto and one piece threads</br>  I thought it was pretty funny at times. Some people complain about the drama being stupid but I kinda liked it. It wasn't as obnoxious or hammy as other shows, and realistically a young kid probably would act up like that while trying to come to terms with dying and never being able to have what he's always wanted.

Just give the victory to Vegeta and the movie is 8/10 instead of 4/10.  <br>Probably, or maybe some bs event might happen where goku and vegeta's God power will decrease and hence, going back to the strength they are at the uub fight</br>  I didn't like this movie but I'm still really excited for Super  What's the justification for Freeza not being at full power during the first fight?  <br>He was at full power.</br>  <br>Explain further.</br>  <br><br>He trained for 6 months and managed to "evolve" by turning into Golden Freezer.</br></br>  I'm about to watch GT for the first time.

The middle third of every episode is pointless filler and animation is repeated constantly.</br>  <br>Well for one, making buu was sealed so there was no worry there, and beerus was too powerful to catch up to, so being third most powerful and while one was sleeping and didn't care what frieza did and the other was sealed, there was no one to stand against you. So what was the point.</br>  <br>Well I think the reason you harken back to the adventure was because of frieza returning. During the namek saga, it was an adventure, you had gohan and krillian running from Frieza's henchmen while still collecting dragonballs and vegeta killing off henchmen while still looking for dragonballs. Pretty much that was the only time you see Vegeta actually have an adventure even though he jumped from boss to boss.</br>  <br>Frieza went through all of the trouble inventing his lower forms because he couldn't control his full power for long periods of time. If he could have so easily mastered his full power by training then why did he need to create his three suppressed forms?</br>  <br> All the barafags that are going to latch onto him </br>  why is cap autistic?  Wasn't the entire movie just a cash grab after Toei saw how much nostalgia money could still be milked out of the series after Xenoverse?  <br>Unless the whole movie was scripted, written, voice acted and animated in two months, no.</br>  <br>My bad, written, voice acted and animated.</br>  <br><br>What isnt a cashgrab these days? Do you think people make new movies, tv series, toys, etc. out of the goodness of their hearts?</br></br>    Who is best and why?  Preview soon.  <br><br> so much salt <br><br>The episode haven't even aired yet, calm your tits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Man, when I was in symphony, if you wrote anything except necessary corrections/notations or wrote them in anything but light pencil, the conductor would strangle you.</br>  <br>everyone is wearing special ribbons, Midori has one too</br>  <br>S2 or movie about Oboe lipstick-chan confirmed.</br>  <br>Taki-sensei is very particular about how you play. And don't touch his blankets.</br>  Weekend waifu/husbando drawthread #7<br><br>Remember to take it easy. <br><br>Thread #6:</br></br></br></br>  Requesting *Hyun-ae in a one piece zipper swimusuit. Of course anything else cute is fine too.  I'm not requesting anything but I was wondering what useful things should be in a reference sheet?

If you put lots of time into something, figure new things out (bestwith reference) and really trying to improve then you really will learn something. Otherwise you just get faster at drawing things you already can do.<br><br>You're waifu is a cute though.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Who cares about mistakes, just don't post it until you get somewhat confident about your drawings if you are so afraid, get a friend or two to show your shit if you REALLY feel necessary to show them to somebody and keep powering yourself up, stop being such pansy ass.</br>    Requesting my lovely wife, Yuzuko, getting a brain freeze from eating shaved ice.

I bet you are a Diego Umeharez fanboy.</br></br></br>  <br>Wait, you got one before, shithead. In the last thread.</br>  I would appreciate anything of Kurumi.

It has NOT been 4 years. You are not going to tell me that 4 years have gone by. You fucking stop that.</br>  <br>Dat butt.</br>  What happened to palette anons  <br>Positive reinforcement works a lot better than negative. They can always improve.  And a lot of what people think is shit really isn't that bad, I've seen far worse. </br>  <br> that spoiler <br>Do you honestly believe that you're so bad? That delivery i really cute and funny.<br>Believe in yourself!</br></br></br>  Well, I had a good run. 3 weeks in a row's not too bad. I salute those of you who persist until the very end, and will see you in the next week  <br>Cute idea. Reminded me of  Washizucopter .</br>   past 11 <br>I- I still have time to draw something, right?</br>  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>being worse != not being bad. and positive reinforcement != baseless praise. I get what you're saying, but encouraging and praising are 2 different things, and as a drawfag I personally would prefer a critique over calling something cute.<br>likewise I've also seen plenty of people -see deviantart- who think they're at a perfectly acceptable level because other people praise it. this shouldn't be allowed especially on 4chan of all places.<br><br>what you should do is something similar to just telling them to keep drawing and point at things they're doing right while giving them advice on what they're doing wrong, but telling clearly bad artists they're doing great will probably do more harm than good.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You should finish that. OR will love it.</br>  <br>You probably have another 12 hours or so at the least. WWD doesn't end until the last thread does.</br>  Requesting Vert wearing a suit and tie, please!  Hope is dead and nobody likes her  <br>Cute style. Have you drawn here before?</br>  <br><br><br>I like to have dynasties in sports, so Diego or one of the previous winners. Momochi would also be acceptable.</br></br></br>  希望はありますか？  絶望!    <br>Oh man, didn't think I would get a delivery this late.<br>Thanks for creating hope from where there was none, and have a pleasant week!</br></br>  <br>I can wait until next week.</br>  <br>Next week will be the week of weeks.</br>  <br>request her as a loli next week and I'll do it.</br>  <br>I've been meaning to do that so I just might.</br>  Any streams?  <br>Always.</br>  <br>Galilfag here, I actually want this girl<br>http://monstergirlencyclopedia.wiki<wbr>a.com/wiki/Girtablilu<br><br> If that is ok with you, if not any other desert monsters would be fine. </br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br><br> Boo~ </br></br>  <br>ダメ？</br>  Don't worry, anon!

I still kinda wanna see short-haired Reisen in a drawfriend's artstyle, though, maybe I'm a tad selfish  </br>    Just wondering, do you guys care if the drawfag relies heavily on reference for a piece? As in, almost tracing the base sketch, although from different images.      <br>snazzy</br>    <br>such an earnest expression! i love it<br><br><br>most people are just happy to get anything of quality whether its traced or not<br>course then theres people essentially asking for the use of the template<br> <br><br>he looks amazing drawfreind!<br> glad i didnt take it <br><br><br><br>are we just in for a volley of deliveries then?<br>that crona is cuuuuute</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Volley of deliveries <br>I hope so</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>Why are you posting all of these now all of the sudden?</br></br></br></br>  <br>hes saving this thread</br>  <br>It's the light at the end of the tunnel.</br>  <br><br>Hey, this is the OR again.<br>No idea if you would see this being as it's two threads later, but I managed to make your drawing resemble Yuuko a lot more.<br>I moved the nose up and to the left and the mouth some, and it made a world of difference.<br>I'd like to thank you again for the wonderful artwork and wanted to let you know that you drew a fantastic booty on Yuuko. Keep on drawing nice waifu butts.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because 34 is the hero we need.</br>  <br>What a lovely smile.

Nice timing, I was about to head off to bed  good morning to you though, I guess . Oh 34, what did I even do to deserve so many deliveries from you? I think you already know well how much I love the way my husbando looks in your style, but I’ll say it again. I love it. I’ve been waiting for right time to make this request to fit the season and really hoped to get something, so you’ve just made my day once again. That little blush does things to my heart, it’s perfect. Also the way you draw Crona is very cute. Thank you so much once again, I hope you have a great week!</br>  <br>yesterday you said tomorrow</br>  <br>cute~</br>  <br> why are you saving the thread and giving hope to people <br><br>You for real?</br></br></br>  <br><br> doitmind </br></br>  There is no hope  <br>ojii save me</br>    <br>i already drew oora like 4 times today</br>  <br>draw justdoit-kun</br>  <br>He's dead jim, let it go.</br>  <br>But there were 2 of them!</br>  <br>They made a lover's suicide pact. I'm sorry for you're loss.</br>  Can someone do Ika please?  <br>I already said that in the previous two threads.</br>  Only 4 and a half more days!  I don't know if he's here (Hell, it's been one week), but I'll say it again.<br><br>Thank you again for delivering, Anon.</br></br>  <br>no it's  chronoire </br>  <br>I never saw your delivery, but if it's Celes it's relevant to my interests, could you repost it for me, or give me a link?</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>You're welcome, have a good week~</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127328021 <br>Sorry but I'm kind of new, and what the fuck is this circle everyone keeps talking about?

I do really appreciate effort though: your lines betray an unsteady hand or a lack of muscle memory but that will come with time. Thanks for taking the time to draw her anon-kun and good luck on your drawfag journey!</br>  I don't hate it as much as usual.  <br>I'm mildly irritated and sleepy</br>  <br>You are indeed my hero, thank you so much! I love that expression and I don't think I've seen many profile drawings from you but it's great and very fluffy.<br>Thanks and have a great week!</br></br>  <br>HE DOESN'T HATE IT AS MUCH AS USUAL</br>  <br> is it too late? <br> Monday <br><br>Anon.</br></br></br></br>  <br>naw nanami yasuri from Katanagatari<br><br>Yeah I wanted to try drawing some waifu first and practice hair so I wouldn't get discouraged. Im gonna start doing line exercised before I attempt anything from now on. I chose yukkuri's as a way to practice hair without producing something too abysmal, im definitely gonna make you something better once i git gud</br></br></br>  <br>I guess someone else can color this.</br>  <br>It's still Sunday here.</br>  <br>Cleanest lines I've ever seen. Really well done.</br>  <br>Same, but I don't hate it that much.</br>  Requesting Tsubaki dressed as Tsubaki, please. Fox ears and tail are not needed.    <br>That's really nice.</br>  <br>Naz</br>  Goodnight everybody! Have a great week and I'll see you all again next weekend!    <br>goodnight kobenibro</br>  Guess I'll have to deliver next week          HERE IT COMES  <br>We've got over 150 posts left and you're saying this?</br>      <br>On second, thought, time to give up</br>  <br>BUT THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE</br>  Promises were meant to be broken, huh?  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ONNNNNNNN</br></br></br></br>   it will never happen to you're waifu <br><br>Kill me now.</br></br>  <br>choco please go home</br>  <br>Why don't you follow your own construction lines? Why don't you limit yourself to a few layers?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127329126 <br/>  <br>Of course not, girls are just meant to be booth babes. They don't know how to play video games.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127329216 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127329126 <br>[Message was removed.]</br></br>  <br>Great work as always orz!</br>  <br>Damn those lines are amazing</br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Such nice lines.<br><br> Please, draw more cute but lewd waifu-tan like the good o'l days. ;_; </br></br></br>  <br>Oysm kobenifag. <br><br><br>In my very limited experience I've found that hair super hard to draw freehand. If you're gonna use photoshop with your new tablet learn to use the pen tool - it's really handy for making perfect hairlines.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope you draw my waifu some day.</br>  <br>wait did you draw that tamabro?</br>  I wonder if I should post my drawing as is now or finish it and post it in the general later.  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127329452 <br>its only going to get worse<br><br>why not both?</br></br></br>  <br>"Draw" isn't really the right word, the base lines were traced because I can't into anatomy but the clothes, hairlines, and accessories were done freehandish and then refined with pen tool.</br>  <br><br>Thank you so much.</br></br>  <br>Well it looks good either way. Thanks for the tips.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Why you doin this?</br></br></br></br>  <br>I think you could've pulled that off without tracing. You also would've gotten more out of it.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br>Very nice.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm more awaken now so I wanted to thank you again! It's nice to wake up to delivery in monday.</br>  Good for Yuianon, but I can't help but feel empty.  <br>But hair is the most fun part!</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127329707 <br>What are you trying to prove kid?</br>  <br>nanaminyan~<br> i tried </br></br>  <br>Is only game, you don't heff to be mad</br>  <br>You didn't answer my question.</br>  <br>I'll finish this later. I swear I will!</br>  <br>thanks~ hopefully her hat doesnt give me too much trouble. Ill have to get to it later im all worn out currently.</br>  <br>Sweet, even more</br>  <br>here you go nanamibro, sorry it's so crappy i'm really tired and wanted to wait until you posted yours but i'm gonna pass out, she a cute</br>  <br>Thanks m8. Hopefully she will be complete enough to  request   someday. <br><br><br>Eh, I don't think you appreciate just how bad my freehand drawing is. Imagine Michael J Fox trying to draw a stick figure after he's had 2 shots of espresso and a red bull and you may just start to appreciate how shaky my hands are.</br></br></br></br>  <br>that one wasn't me but it was super cute as well, you can leave off her hat if you'd like or just draw the tiny one!</br>  <br>Thats the point. They get to feel good about delivering for one person while simultaneously pissing off everyone else. Maximum payout.</br>  <br>tiny hats are great ill try that. Will try to do it early tommorow, look for it in the general</br>  <br>What is that suppose to mean?</br>  <br>RIP CB, wish we could have had some fun in FD before you passed away.</br>  <br>Fuck off circlejerker.</br>  <br>Bullies please go.</br>  <br>thanks for noticing</br>  <br>then don't rerequest after you've already gotten a fill, fucker</br>  <br>Maybe if you weren't so bitter you'd have friends too anon.</br>  <br>nah dude im the drawfag</br>  <br>Ah, the lowercase on your post kinda gave off a "sarcastic" tone, my bad.</br>  <br>sometimes I ask myself why I do the things I do and then I end up doing something even stranger</br>  <br>Just a messy sketch, but I guess it's better than nothing!</br>  <br>I give up.</br>  <br> Mishafag gets one <br><br>I'm with you</br></br></br>  Requesting a drawing of Cave at the beach in her swimsuit.  <br> draw for shit head haremfag <br>You couldn't pick another waifu?</br></br>  <br>she looks beautiful ojii never stop <br><br>zzzz I'm sorry  tomorrow!  I won't be as dead after more sleep</br></br></br>    <br><br><br><br>so here it is again, this time im at home, and not struggling to draw entirely on a chair</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br>You're welcome! Have a good week.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Thanks! Lines are a lot cleaner now!

Or is that only a few special ones? How would I go about creating one for myself, if'd decide I should?  <br>Do it once you're good</br>  <br>In 20 years then</br>  <br><br>You're probably long asleep, but that's okay because you got the real delivery already.</br></br>  <br>not or but thats cute as hell<br>pointing arm doest appear weird either pretty good anon!</br></br>  <br>If you want to use a name, use a name.</br>  <br>Go to the booru and see for yourself...?<br>Most people don't even check the booru, which is sad</br></br>  <br>its odd because trips are looked down upon so its discouraged in the first place, so the best thing is just to draw and sign your art with the name<br>or just use a name i suppose</br></br>  <br> trips </br>  <br><br>Fine work there,  other  Yuukobro.</br></br>  <br> not filtering trips </br>  <br> 888  <br> trips <br>Oh shit.</br></br></br>  <br>check um</br>  <br>dens-kun ohaio!</br>  <br><br> <br><br> <br><br><br> <br> <br> <br><br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br> pt1 <br><br>Oh shit.</br></br></br>  <br>Good sketch.

Hush Anon, don't say like it doesn't matter if I saw this or not, as the other anon already said, it really is cute as hell! I love how you included the ring, a little detail, but it was enough to make my heart melt. Not to mention his smile, which always makes me happy.

I love you anon-chan!</br>  <br>I love you too</br>  <br>Hurrah!  I was so lonely. But I was too shy to make my own thread. ;_; </br>  <br>Why would you be too shy for a thread?</br>  <br>I have weird  stupid  internet anxiety issues.</br>   mfw there was no yryr thread   <br>more pictures of chinatsu crying</br>  <br>But noone here knows who you are, you can just change your writing style a bit and you will literally vanish in a sea of anonymous</br>  I was going to start one, but too took long being indecisive, trying to think of a good OP.<br><br>I should learn to be more like Saku-sama.</br></br>      Please post Akari laughing at donuts  Chinasue is just another victim of the patriarchy, but this still doesn't justify her behavior. She needs to understand that she let too many bad influences get to her.  <br>China is a rapist</br>  Is Chinasue a bigger lesbian than Ayano?  <br>Just for you.</br>  <br>This scene was weird, You don't usually see Yui happy or blushing when Kyoko is invading her personal space.</br>  <br>Kyouko always knows what to say or do to make Yui go full girly and blushing and shit<br>That scene was just one of those moments</br></br>  <br>why is she bullying the donuts</br>      <br>Pictured: unstoppable rape rampage</br>  What is she saying?  <br> TOUSHINO KYOUKO </br>      <br> ehehe </br>  <br>fucked up transparency in the previous one</br>  So we can all agree that the OTPs are as follows:<br>Kyouko x Ayano<br>Sakurako x Himawari<br>Akari x Chitose<br>Yui x Chinatsu</br></br></br></br>  <br> Akari x Chitose <br> Yui x Chinatsu </br></br>  <br> Akari x Chitose <br> Yui x Chinatsu <br>But that's wrong anon.</br></br></br>    <br> Akari x Chitose <br>Seems legit.</br></br>  <br>Kyouko x Ayano<br>Sakurako x Himawari<br>Akari x Chinatsu<br>Chitose x Chizuru<br> Yui x Me </br></br></br></br></br>    Even though Chinatsu's feelings for Yui are canon and it's obvious that Namori is pushing ChinaxAkari aswell but do you ever think we'll get a scene that indicates that she has actual romantic feelings for Akari?  <br>You got them all correct!<br><br>No one ever agrees with me on two of those.</br></br></br>    <br>I think a better question is will Akari ever understand what love is?</br>  <br>Yui x Ayano*</br>  <br>why is she tiny?</br>  <br>approved</br>  <br>Wew</br>  Posting more Akari x China until Namori makes them official.  <br>It was a dream. It even says so on the page posted.</br>    Am I the only one who thought the second season was much worse than the first season?

That's why they're practically already living with each other.<br><br>Oh wait.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Saku is a miracle.</br>  <br>We've already got a few scenes that can be read that way, what we need is the inverse - scenes that indicate Akari has feelings for Chinatsu.</br>  More gifs pls  <br>I fear mini Akari wouldn't survive long under that onslaught.  doujins when? </br>        IBO IBO SEVEEEEN!  <br>Seems like it yeah.

They have a higher % of having their children be born with some type of disability too.  <br>You are supposed to read "pro-abortion" and "pro-gay marriage" as simply "pro-degeneracy." Incest is just another form of degeneracy, so if you support those other things (and let's face it, you probably smoke weed too), then you don't have your own beliefs in order if you don't also support incest, pedophilia, bestiality, transgenderism, welfare, sexual promiscuity, scat porn, and other forms of degeneracy.</br>  <br><br> using degeneracy unironically </br></br>   I fucking love this show.   <br>What if I hate gays and like incest and lolis?</br>  <br>I'm in the same camp as </br>  <br><br> abortion is degeneracy <br>The whole point of abortion is so that you don't bring any more fucked up, degenerate children into the world.</br></br></br>  <br>*unsheathe katana*<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=RYj<wbr>t1-TEQk4</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> murdering the peasant class at birth instead of giving them an equal chance at life <br>Yeah, OK.

You won't be seeing any more Moonlights, unless the cards are coming out.</br>    <br>Yuzu is going to be leg locking and telling Yuya to come inside so much when they reunite that their kid will probably be able to take over by Arc V 2</br>  <br> The more Moonlight cards the better chance we have of actually seeing the cards come out <br>Cookmates say otherwise</br></br>  <br> Cookmates have enough cards to fill out a deck. <br> Print Aqua Actress' instead. <br><br>Ironically this is what gives me hope that anything can be printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Arc V writers are a bunch of waifufags, which means Serenas cards will probably be printed</br>  <br>Your Tomato knows how to ride a motorcycle, why can't you?</br>  <br>Free token cards from the official Konami girls-only Yugioh meetup they have every month or so</br>  <br>Not how that works, they rarely push cards that come out before they do in the anime. It's why I'm baffled seeing people assume Ryo or Jonouchi are coming back solely because they're pushing Cyber Dragons and Red Eyes cards.<br><br>A few archetypes say otherwise, like the Dinosaurs from GX. Either way he is right, the more cards you see in the anime the better chance they have of coming out at least a little bit. <br><br>I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly, especially when we have so many other more deserving cards that need to be printed, and not just in Arc-V, we still have tons of cards from the other series that need to be printed, let alone about half of the archetypes in Arc-V. Konami really needs to try and start producing more cards instead of focusing on the Entermates, there are a ridiculous number of them already, or trying to push older cards that half of them don't even fit into any decks people even use anymore, even with some of the new supports.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What?</br></br>  <br> I really don't understand why they bothered with that card honestly <br>Because they had to print SOMETHING for Arc-V.</br></br>  Yuya may be the cutest and most perfect looking and sounding and acting and everyt- <br>Just answer the question<br>http://strawpoll.me/4770619</br></br>  <br> there are a ridiculous number of them already <br>Is the number of Entermates Blackwing level yet?</br></br>  <br> No Yusei <br> Dub Judai name </br></br>  <br>Could have printed a lot of different shit instead.<br><br>It's getting there. I feel with how much Shun gets pushed in the anime, BUY RAID RAPTORS is gonna be the new one along with BUY ENTERMATES and BUY ODD-EYES.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuya and Yuzu fuck the multiverse up bad  <br> both go their own separate ways <br> miraculously save child individuals that reminds them of their former selves and raise them. <br> 10 year timeskip Yuya becomes an Archer-tier EdgeLord and Yuzu becomes morally grey. <br> Try to travel back in time to change what they did wrong but multi-verse theory happens meaning no matter how hard they try it won't affect their recent world. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>you forgot that blonde girl with glasses on the first Yugioh, you know the one who actually kissed Yugi.</br>  <br>If you count anime only, there totals around 40 Entermate monsters.</br>  <br>Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? Most of his cards stick to an archetype (hence, Entermates and Magicians) since in the past the MC's deck would be more mish mash.</br>  <br>Yuzu confirmed MC for Part 2.<br><br> Gongenzaka  confirmed MC for Part 3.</br></br></br>  <br> no yusei <br>i know he would get all the votes, but come on.</br></br>  <br> Does Yuya really get more cards printed than other protags did? <br>I cant imagine he comes anywhere close to all the garbage Hero cards Judai had printed</br></br>  <br> 40 Entermate monsters already and we're not even halfway through the show <br><br>For what purpose</br></br></br>  <br> Meanwhile Reiji is time traveling with Yliaster and Paradox trying to save the worlds from utter destruction <br> yfw the Domino City Paradox comes from is Synchro Dimension after Fusion is done with it <br><br>Elemental Heroes got a lot, but for the most part, yeah Yuya is getting tons of cards printed.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's his time to shine</br>  <br><br>Judai probably will forever hold that record.<br>Yusei and Yugi probably have similar amount of cards printed, but it's harder to keep track of the number of their released cards because they don't stick to a specific archetype that much</br></br></br>  <br>Arc-V 2? Incoming Yuzu taking the spotlight. Which makes me ponder just what exactly they are gonna do to Yuya to take him out of action for a good chunk of the season. I mean, it's not like Judai got a replacement during his time as the supreme king</br>  <br><br>No</br></br>  <br> there are people here RIGHT NOW dumb enough to take that post seriously <br>You guys are not often the brightest, even for 4chan</br></br>  <br><br>More like 30</br></br>  <br>Yusei had nearly all of his cards printed didn't he?<br>All the Synchrons, Warriors, Effect Veiler, Ghost Gardna, the Stardusts, Armory Arm, Quillbolt, Level Eater<br>Fuck, what didn't get printed?</br></br></br>  <br>Yugi at first didn't have many at all, by now he probably does yeah. But solely because they re-release cards, they've added tons of supports for older cards the past year or two with DM cards, they've been trying to give them Synchro/Xyz shit and everything. <br><br>From a straight show base I believe it goes.<br><br> Judai <br> Crow <br> Yuya <br> Yugi <br> Yusei/Yuma <br><br>I'm not even sure if we can count Yugi as the OCG/TCG was just coming out so of course they'd get cards printed. <br><br>Chances are it'll have something to do with Yugo getting nom'd.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying Eita won't be the new protag </br>  <br>I know right<br> There are people who dont know Arc V 2 will follow Neo New Sawataris revolution </br></br>  <br><br>Yusei was pretty prone to using the same cards over and over again though</br></br>  <br> Implying Nega Neo New Sawatari won't be the final villain </br>  I'll be the new protag, I've already stolen Yuzu, and I'm going to steal the spotlight when I beat Jack instead of Yuya. <br><br>What would you guys think if Yugo was the one that ate Yuya instead? Just hypothetical because it's obviously not happening.</br></br>  <br> Speed Warrior wa shokan! <br><br><br>Later on they start missing a few cards, I was watching the ZONE duel the other day and they never printed some of the cards he used there, like Clear Effector. All his Syncro monsters did get printed though</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm not sure if I would like Yugo as the main, even if I like him as he is right now. Baka hotheaded shounen MC is less cute when it's the main thing.</br>  <br>Hey man, I like BAD ENDS. I really, really like BAD ENDS</br>  <br> Baka hotheaded shounen MC is less cute when it's the main thing. <br>This. exactly hotheaded idiots are good if they're just a secondary character they're tolerable that way. Them being in the lead makes it cringe worthy</br></br>  <br>Why? Every character I like just dies or get replaced. Now with the MC too?

Yugo is fucking retarded. He knows he's a wanted criminal amd still wants to enter the friendship cup.

The same as her entire life in Academia.</br>  <br>Say goodbye to Yuyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</br>  <br>She missed the manzai with Sawatari-san this week</br>  How relevant is Yuzu to the plot?  <br> my body is ready to take down xyz scum </br>  <br>Yuzu IS the plot.<br><br>Look at all that plot.</br></br></br>  <br>she's a great  self insert </br>  <br>She was a window through which we saw most of the plot at the start of the show, now she's Yuyas main motivation.

Kaiba or Jack?  <br>Reiji.</br>    <br>Kaiba is easily smarter than Jack.</br>  <br> Jack <br>Fuck no<br> Kaiba  <br>FUCK NO<br><br>Honestly, it's Reiji, since he understands Card Advantage.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well Kaiba cheated half the time, especially early on. <br><br>Honestly for as dumb as Judai is and forgetting the rules half the time, he's one of the few that actually tries to set up strategy and shit. <br><br>If we're talking straight up just how good they are at dueling, then it'd be Yusei, Shun, Serena, Jack, or Judai, likely Yusei.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Anon please leave. Nobody will post monster if they are not Ruri herself.</br>  <br>Reiji, he's pretty much Pegasus, Kaiba, Atem, Jack, and Yusei all put into one. Dude understands shit way too easily. <br><br>If there was a meta in the anime, he'd be Super Nekroz.</br></br></br>  <br> Yuzu <br> Sawatari <br> Shun <br> That fucking hippo <br>Ebina confirmed for Arc-V poster</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A shame Reiji isn't as popular as Kaito, Kaiba, Jack, et al. Crazy Imouto Man and Crab Girl stealing his thunder.</br>  <br>Shun go away.</br>  <br>Shun sees visions of Yuto.<br><br>It's Yuya who hallucinates Yuzu.</br></br></br>  I hope we get a Yugo teaching Yuzu how to Motorcycle episode.<br><br>Kinda bored with everyone just knowing how to Motorcycle.</br></br>  <br>Maybe if Reiji did more than sit in his NEET cave and spy on people and figure out prep time like Batman. <br><br>The animators seem to love him though considering how broken he is and how many themes he has though.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh. After seeing this I guess Yuzu's hair isn't as unnatural as it seems to be.</br>  <br>They have an auto-pilot mode for that very reason. Kaiba wasn't about to have card games on motorcycles without a backup plan, he doesn't want to get sued.</br>  <br>I love how animators on this show are<br> the script writers <br> monster and card designers <br> AND music composers <br>Amazing that they have all these anime Da Vincis on board.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> principal pissing yuya off directly after a tiring battle <br>not fair</br></br>  <br> butthurt failed AOTS non-virgin detected </br>  <br>Hey, Shuzo died to teach Yuya an important lesson. Have some respect.</br>  <br>It's a joke on how it's only in the Arc-V threads that people seem to think animators have anything to do with all major parts of a series' production other than drawing frames for the show.</br>  Yuya a thirsty mofo. Beginning to show signs of scurvy. Someone throw him a bottle of orange juice.  <br>Sora had the inside track, but Yuya has longer and presumably stronger arms. He could've grabbed it too and probably would've won a tug-of-war.</br>  <br> the principal is pendulum summoning <br>holy shit yuya's going to be so butthurt<br>if i wasn't in love with him i'd be laughing my ass off</br></br></br>  <br>Shuzo cemented himself as best dad simply by being there as a father figure and reaching out. Yusho will probably end up being nothing but trouble when he finally shows up.</br>  <br><br>Oh you know what he meant. <br><br>If that happened Yuya would probably just let him have it so the duel would continue, chances are all it would have done was destroy Odd-Eyes Rebellion, Yuya still wouldn't have lost.</br></br></br></br>  Yugo confusing Yuzu for Rin after her shower gets me every time. What an adorable dumbass.  <br>The harisen seems like a powerful tool for keeping Yuyas in line.  Why didn't she just use it on Yuri when he was chasing her? </br>  <br> I hope we get a Yugo teaching Yuzu how to Motorcycle episode. <br>That would actually feel pretty pointless after showing that first timers have no trouble picking it up because of auto pilot.</br></br>  <br>Makes me wonder how close and intimate Yugo is with Rin.</br>  <br>Yusei and Jack were incredibly intelligent duelists who had seriously fucking next-level ability to read their opponents and predict their moves. Jack's flaw was that he let his emotions get the better of him, which is why Yusei beat him the second time. <br><br>Shun's good at this too, but he's a cocky little shit, which is why Sora outlasted and eventually trashed him the second time. It seems like he's really good at preparing for bad scenarios, but not necessarily adapting to them as they come. <br><br>Yugi was an incredibly smart duelist too, but his strength was less in strategy and more in being able to come up with ridiculous combos in the moment and being able to play all sorts of bullshit mindgames with his opponent (see: the time he eyefucked Mai into not attacking him). <br><br>I'd say Yusei, then Reiji, then Yugi, Kaiba and Jack probably.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, unless she reacts the same way whenever he does stuff like that (which he obviously is used to doing, otherwise he wouldn't have reacted that way) I'd say they can almost be considered couple-close  though, for the sake of argument and purity, stick with as close as siblings. </br>  <br> Yuzu hits Yuri with a harisen <br> Yuri rubs his head  <br> "W-what is this feeling...I-I remember this...? Huh?" <br> "What did you do to me, Hiiragi Yuz-ouch" </br></br></br></br>  Will Jack summon all 3 Red Demons in one turn??  <br>Shun's deal is his deck is made specifically to counter the special summons of Fusion Duelists, which in turn just sort of fucks everything up as far as the current game goes since everything important is a special summon. <br><br>And Reiji doesn't even need to read his opponents he's just overwhelming and has the same Atem mindfuck speeches going on with him too. He did make a point to Yuya that emotions will cause you to lose. <br><br>Reiji and Yusei are pretty much on the same level, maybe Reiji is even beyond just because of his ability to fuck with people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If Odd-Eyes Rebelliion went down, Yuya was pretty screwed since he didn't summon any wall monsters with his last Pendulum Summon (seriously, he could've at last summoned Stargazer in DEF so he could revive OERD if it WAS destroyed)<br><br>Sabre Tiger would've attacked him directly and that would've been it. Although Sora probably would've just gone "lol, 1-1 now faggot" and left anyway when the cavalry arrived instead of carding him.</br></br></br>  <br> Crow and Jack appear in Arc-V <br> Arc-V has the best side cast <br> New Protagonist    Even Though It's 99% BULLSHIT  <br><br>Being Yuya is Suffering, they don't even give him a chance to show off like other MC's did.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd imagine Yuya had a card in his hand to set or would have looked for an Action Card in that scenario. Standard would get absolutely fucked in Synchro and Fusion if it wasn't for Reiji's Action Magic, they rely too much on them. <br><br>But yeah you are right, Sora wouldn't have cared, just bit his lollipop and walked off while Yuya screamed about having fun. Shame we wont get to see him ever smile or duel Yuya again since Shun is probably going to fucking kill him the next time they meet.</br></br></br>  <br>If there was no action cards Yuya could've won because Sora used them to reduce the amount of life points he'll lose whereas Yuya used them just to gain his attacks</br>  <br>Pretty much. Shun's deck is made with the expectation that you'll keep throwing big SSes at him and he'll just turn it against you over and over. <br><br>Problem with that is that, apparently Sora just rope-a-doped him and outlasted his OTK. When a card came up that could just wipe Shun's field instantly, he had NO answer for it. <br><br>Although he seems to have wised up a bit, since he used Raptor's Ultimate Mace to counter the potential of his monster getting rekt against Dennis.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Even worse when you realize that Yuya's overall dueling record is barely above Yuma's who has the worst record as far as the MC goes. Though if we aren't counting the duels before the show began where he was under 60% then he's a pretty good duelist.</br>  <br> Standard would get absolutely fucked in Synchro and Fusion if it wasn't for Reiji's Action Magic, they rely too much on them. <br>It's hilarious that this is true for the most part, but in the specific case of Sora, he'd be such a fucking joke without Action Cards. Shun would've embarrassed him even harder than he did and Yuya would've destroyed him.</br></br>  <br>Damn Yuya is likeable So I feel sympathy for him losing a lot of screenime as a MC, However if Yuma was in his position I'd choose the side cast characters anyday</br>  <br>Yep, he's good at adapting. I'd imagine someone like Kaiba though whose deck mostly relies on tribute summoning barring the couple of fusions he has would be able to overwhelm Shun, since Kaiba was able to get three Blue Eyes out all the damn time like it was nothing. Makes me excited to see what cards he has in the new movie. Imagine Kaiba with Azure Eyes and Pendulum Summoning and shit.</br>  <br>True SYNCHRO doesn't use auto-pilot, though.</br>  <br><br>Yeah Sora is weird considering he's supposed to be the best duelist from Fusion as far as the Slifer, Ra, and Obelisks go. But so far all we've really seen him do is beat scrubs and Shun once. Especially considering Serena and Yuri both (though I don't know if Yuri counts) have so far been the better duelists by far, hell Dennis too. Not sure if he counts either. I'd imagine Yuri and Dennis were Obelisks as well though.</br></br>  <br>Off-screen duels don't count, Sora.<br><br>And Yuya is good because of the sidecast.</br></br></br>  <br>Use it as an excuse to teach Yuzu Synchro or something, I dunno. <br><br>Yugo and Yuzu need more screentime. Definitely the best part of this arc, along with ENJOY man.</br></br></br>  <br> Yeah Sora is weird considering he's supposed to be the best duelist from Fusion <br>Neh. Yuri's obviously stronger than him for one, as Yuri shitcanned Yuzu and Yuzu's one of the stronger duelists in the series. Serena's probably stronger than him too. <br><br>He might be one of the strongest STUDENTS at Academia, but there's probably all sorts of absurdly powerful adults there.</br></br></br></br>  <br> And Yuya is good because of the sidecast <br><br>Not really even if the sidecast weren't good, he's like Judai 2.0, although the relationship between him and Yuzu makes him more likeable</br></br></br>  <br>He might just be the strongest Obelisk then at least from what we've seen. But yeah it's clear that Yuri, Serena, and Dennis are better duelists than him, at least so far.</br>  <br> Dennis <br>Pshhh, what are you talking about, he's just some LDS scrub.</br></br>  <br>Oh yeah right. I'm really hoping he is some sort of Triple Agent or some shit, the Ocelot of the series.<br><br>I'm curious though, I'd assume that his Xyz summons don't give off the readings like Yuto/Shun's did, which is why he's able to infiltrate Standard so well and doesn't bother using Fusion, but I wonder why the other dimensions only have aptitude for certain ones. Like is Shun and Dennis' pendulum summoning also babby tier energy wise compared to Yuya, Reiji, Sawatari, etc.?</br></br></br>  Dennis the __________  <br>Bennis</br>  <br/>  <br>Are Serena's Serenas big enough for Bennis' Bennis?</br>  <br> since Kaiba was able to get three Blue Eyes out all the damn time like it was nothing <br><br>No kidding, you ever play against him in Tag force special? You'll always hear "Ore no prido, Sosti ore no tamashi, Ideyo, Blue Eyzu Whito Drogon!!" by the second turn. The only way to truly get rid of those fuckers is to banish them. Kaiba has no answer for that in his deck</br></br></br>  <br> KOURIN SEYO, WAGA TAMASHII </br>   That Laugh   <br>And now we'll likely get Blue Eyes Pendulum Dragons that go to the Extra Deck and can just be summoned every turn and Overlayed and Tuned and all sorts of shit. At least I'm hoping. <br><br>Also unfortunately no I haven't go to play TFS, I don't understand enough to get what's going on and I can't read Japanese worth a shit, mostly because I'm lazy and wont bother practicing and the translation for it are good, but the story translations are just Abridged Tier, some of it is straight ripped off. <br><br>We get a trailer for that movie come the 9-12 at San Diego Comic Con don't we?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He probably got Yuki Usagi didn't he alongside the Yang Zing. At least his deck got a boost.</br>  <br> Yuya loses to Jack <br> Disappears for half the arc <br> Yugo takes over as MC for awhile  <br> Yuya comes back this time he ditches the entermates and uses DRAGONS and Magicians </br></br></br></br>  1st Panel<br> Serena: Hey Sawatari! <br> It seems like I am a 'les' and I seem to be doing 'yuri' with Yuzu... <br> What does that mean? <br><br> Sawatari: Eh? Well―, <br> It means that it's girls that are really getting along and are really best friends. <br><br> Serena: Hmmm... <br> Below first panel: Wonder what's that box in front of her? <br><br>2nd Panel<br> Serena: I want to play with Yuzu... <br> Ah! Yuzu! <br><br> Yuzu: Serena? What's up? <br><br> Serena: You see! The truth is I am a 'les'! <br><br> Yuzu: HUH? <br><br> Serena: I wanna hurry up and do 'yuri yuri' with Yuzu! <br> Do you have time!? <br><br> bgsfx: intense breathing <br><br>3rd Panel<br> Yuzu: Serena, <br> Let go of me. <br><br> Serena: What!? Why!? <br><br> Yuzu: You're pretty close, <br> a bit. <br><br>4th Panel<br> Serena: Yuya! What should I do!? <br> I said something to Yuzu that Sawatari told me and she hated it! <br><br> Yuya: Well, you see! <br> Just by all means, stop believing whatever Sawatari says, got it!? <br><br>5th Panel<br> Masumi: What!? <br> Yuzu isn't a Lesbian!? <br><br> Yaiba: You're too noisy, Masumi! <br> You're saying such a thing with a loud voice! <br><br> Box: The person who received the most damage. <br><br>Man, this 5D's artist's favorite in Arc-V really is Serena. His latest comics are all about her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They don't need pendulums, they need an xyz.</br>  <br>Best part is that if they want, Serena can be a main stay in the cast due to her being voiced by Yuzu's actor as well. Now wouldn't that be strange if they got into a tag duel together?</br>  <br>He does now.</br>  <br>Whose isn't besides Ebina? <br><br>Well Dark Magician does have one, it's banned though. I'd imagine Yugi gets Xyz and Kaiba gets Synchro and they both get Pendulum.</br></br></br>  <br> Well Dark Magician does have one, it's banned though. <br>No it isn't.</br></br>  <br>Legendary Magician of Dark can't be used in duels.</br>  <br> Hippo Taking Yuyas Place <br><br>Ebina is not fond of Yuya is he?</br></br></br>  <br>That's not the Xyz Dark Magician. That's a Match Winner.<br><br>And it's technically not banned, it's illegal. There's a difference.</br></br></br>  <br>Ebon Illusion Magician.</br>  <br>A good number of his Arc-V sketches on twipple are of Yuya</br>  <br><br>I completely forgot about that card, my bad then.</br></br>  Can we discuss why this guy is the best secondary character ever introduced in the entire YGO franchise?  <br>He's really not. I don't think a lot of the staff likes Yuya very much at all considering there was an interview about why Yuya is no where near as balsy or hardcore as previous protagonist. The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional.</br>  <br>Ebina is a fan of Serena too. He changed his profile pic, when the high res of her default manzai face was released on the anime's official twitter.<br><br>He changed it back to Hippo again though.</br></br></br>  <br>He's a total bro to Yuya, he's like Synchro Gongenzaka</br>  <br>He also changed it to Kurosaki once his icon was released on the anime twitter. No surprise that the best regular animation director on the team also has impeccable taste.</br>  <br>I read that producer interview and all they said is that they wanted to try something different with Yuya. Is saying that<br> our new MC is not a total badass gary stu <br>now equivalent to hating your own creation?</br></br></br>  <br> The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional. <br><br>I want him to finally snap and make him be a baddass character for an entire arc</br></br></br>  <br>Ebina just loves all Ruris.</br>  <br>Why do you wanna bully the tomato?</br>  <br>Really? A shame since he's pretty much a good character that actually develops and is down-to-earth compared to previous protagonists.<br><br>He's my favorite compared to previous protagonists.</br></br></br>  <br> boyshorts confirmed </br>  <br>This makes me feel sorry for him his Soo much potiential but fortunately arc-v was blessed with a good side cast</br>  <br>So he likes Yuya?</br>  <br>It's quite obvious that his favorites are Shun and Ruris.</br>  <br>Yuya could've been serious but his family and friends stop him it's like there sealing away his real personality (not including edgemode)</br>  <br>Judai was pretty down to earth and not badass until Season 3 at least. In fact didn't Judai forget the fucking rules to duel monsters sometimes?</br>  <br>Enough to spend money he makes working for Yugioh to on Yugioh merch</br>  <br>Isn't that just most of Japan?</br>  <br> No where near as ballsy <br><br>Dude he was about fucking leave his friends in order to save Yuzu even Crow had to call him out, Fucking Crow. If that's not called determination I don't know what is</br></br></br>  <br>Sad too considering Reiji called him out on that shit too.</br>  <br> The guy is a soft little dude with issues and gets very emotional. <br><br>Ha top kek, still the straightest protag</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, yeah, he did say Yuya was being awfully focused on Yuzu despite claming he was avenging the fallen. God, Yuya would be been an annoying edgelord if he had come to Synchro without Yoko doing some parenting. especially after what those little bastard kids said.</br>  <br>Ruris &gt; friends</br>  <br>Yep, just rewatched the episode actually, he says something along the lines of "You only care about Hiragi Yuzu, but what of the other people who were turned into cards."</br>  <br>Nothing wrong to save your most loved one by sacrificing other lives</br>  <br>If Yoko hadn't dueled Yuya, he would have become an edgelord.<br><br>During Security's duel, he would have been put in isolation.<br><br>ENJOY Duel wouldn't have happened, and everyone would be out of half their decks.<br><br>Serena would have been "interrogated" by Jean-Michel.<br><br>So the Yoko duel WAS actually relevant.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Inb4 Ebina is a Yuzufag and payed Ono Kensho to say this</br></br></br>  <br>I dunno, he lost his shit over a bunch of knight nerds he didn't even know</br>  <br>Yuto's PTSD was fucking his mind though</br>  <br>More like Yuya would of edgelord'd out and beat them all using Odd Rebellion, scaring the fuck out of Serena,Sawatari and Reira in the process, Then, in his edgy state he ranks up Odd Rebellion into a destructive monster that creates such a problem that Jean sends in Jack Atlus after him.</br>  <br><br><br><br>It's like Yuya's almost close to Season 3 Judai when all he thought about was Johan, granted his friends pretty much wanted to help Judai.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame Yuto more for that. Yuya cares, just not when his Citrus is with another Fruit.</br>  <br> all he thought about was Johan </br>  <br> granted his friends pretty much wanted to help Judai. <br><br>Then he told them to fuck off and not to come because it too dangerous, then they wind up cursing his existance when it turns out to be too dangerous and flat out distancing themselves from him in season 4 because they were by their own admittance scared of Judai now. I still remember them instantly mad at him for dueling Fubuki in the abandoned dorm to draw out Darkness again even through it was Fubuki's idea.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, at the end of the day, when he heard news of Yuzu missing, he just forgot about those people and kept doing Yuzu.flac.<br><br>He mentions about those fallen ones a bit, but eventually, everything just went "MUH YUZU".</br></br></br>  <br>I wonder if he'll ever drop the entertainment stuff</br>  <br>As expected for someone who cherishes their key person</br>  <br>Yeah, but it's not like you can do anything more for Michio or Teppei, while Yuzu's still out there somewhere.</br>  <br>That's a given</br>  <br>It's like you didn't watch the first part of Reiji vs Yuya's 2nd duel.<br><br>Everyone thought Yuzu was carded until at the end of that episode, where Reiji says that Yuya can still save Yuzu.</br></br></br>  <br>Juudai's normie friends were all kinda assholes in the end. He was better off journeying the world with Yubel, the cat and Daitokuji's ghost.</br>  <br>He's AU Himuro.</br>  <br>Yuya sometimes gets tunnel visioned like Judai did with Johan, but the difference is that he has friends and others around him who are actually effective in reminding him or keeping him in check.</br>  <br>So will he be irrelevant after episode 64?</br>  <br>Where else were they supposed to fit in a Yuzu.wav monologue?</br>  <br>To this day I still wonder what people's thoughts were when they first saw this.</br>  <br> Holy Shit a first every Straight Yugioh a Protagonist! </br>  <br>Wonder how the dub's gonna fuck this one up.</br>  <br>When you need to ally with someone, it's probably better to let them keep thinking they have the upper hand, rather than making them worry about how you're a potential threat.<br><br><br>People say that they were surprised, and I guess I was a little by how much of it there was. But at the same time, Yuya had literally only 2 friends his own age when the show first began.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Really? I first knew he was straight when this happened</br>  <br> Mieru's face as she realizes she never had a chance.  <br> Sticks by Yuya anyway and even almost jumps into the duel against Reiji. </br></br>  <br>Are you talking about this? The one where one of the producers call him one of their favorites?<br>http://ygorganization.com/arcvprodu<wbr>cerinterview/<br><br>Uchida： Eh!? Please tell us more!<br><br>Sanematsu： He’s a gentle child who is usually very quiet, unlike most heroes. He doesn’t use ‘だぜ！’ (a very brazen young male way of speaking) when he speaks. Instead of providing leadership for those around him, or reading the atmosphere, he’s a boy who gets involved with others. Those watching will be able to say to themselves “He’s just like me”, that he’s a boy without a lot of confidence, just like them, wondering how he will grow and change. I want those watching to see how he grows, and cheer him on as he does.<br><br>Hirayama： I myself am very sympathetic with Yuya’s weaker side and his sense of humanity, both good and bad. I love the entire cast as far as favorite characters go, but I really want to cheer Yuya on.<br><br>Kasai： I see. After asking you both, the show’s strong points seem even clearer! I’ll be able to enjoy watching the series even more now!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> You'll never have a loli with accurate fortunetelling powers who's extremely devoted to you. </br>  <br>Kasai： Could you tell us if there’s any characters you like best among the cast?<br>Sanematsu： I’d say mine is the hero of the story, Yuya. Usually, the hero is someone everyone loves the best, but Yuya is different form those sort of heroes, as you’re not expected to like him the same way as the normal run-of-the-mill hero.<br><br>They like him ;)</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there a reason why she didn't become a Lancer? Like, how is it not a good idea to have a person with occult powers like fortune telling and people sensing around on a mission where you're going to be, primarily, searching for people that can help you? HURR HURR RITUAL SCUM but Sibyllas are still good as fuck and Reiji could've given her Pendulums and Pot of Taboos.</br>  I can't wait for yuri to come back a take Yuzu away  <br> Protagonist hair style was based by a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. </br>  <br>Voiced by Aoi Yuki, leaving her being too expensive and apparently people aren't much fans of rituals. Regardless her deck as a ton of potential.</br>  Makes me wonder if they realized how much people fucking hated Yuma and the endless dick sucking he got for his stupid ass catchphrase/ life mantra. He's also likely to destroy the other protagonists in a duel now thanks to all the Utopia upgrades he's got.  <br>She doesn't really add anything to the group that's not already there. Sawatari has comic relief covered.</br>  <br>Well, at least she got her cards printed.</br>  <br>Pretty surprised that it is an outright confirmation of Citrus thirst.<br><br>That wasn't really enough though.<br><br>With his comment of not wanting to have a strong crude girl as a girlfriend, and how they're separate most of the time in Part 1, and how he doesn't think much of her during that time, it's not hard to think that Yuya thinks of Yuzu as just a friend.<br><br>But thanks to that episode, it's revealed that Yuya did took Yuzu for granted. Now that he lost her, he's pretty much desperate to go looking for her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, the children of Nippon loved Zexal and Yuma.<br><br>Regardless, I appreciate that in Arc-V that not everyone else in the cast relies on the MC (it's often the other way around), and that he's not always in the right or successful 100% of the time.</br></br></br>  <br>her VA costs a shit ton of money probably, also we already have Pink Ruri and Blue Ruri to fill the female roles.</br>  <br>Hopefully not. I liked Himuro, Yabagi, and Saiga. They were fucking great. I want to see Himuro perhaps go back to pro dueling, Yabagi continuing his traveling the world for rare artifacts, and Saiga reconciling with his former tag partner.</br>  <br>Yuri won't do it. They'll be separated again through some other, more tragic means.</br>  I need Raid Ruris. After Shun's antics I need a decklist. <br><br> tfw not /fit/ enough to be as badass as Shun </br></br>  <br>I'll never watch this. Anything after GX was pure utter Garbage. I thought 5D's would have been the nail in the coffin for watchers of the animes.<br><br>I guess "Heart of the Cards" is meaningless now, Yu-Gi-Oh was never about fan service, and we only had a handful of females in each fucking edition. <br><br>But now that they see that the cards ain't beating Pokemon anytime soon they're giving us Service, Moeshit and MUH EXTREMELY COLORED HAIR.<br><br>Fuck this shit, anyone with a brain wouldn't dare watch this if they had respect for the game. Literally I bet half of us in this thread don't even play anymore.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We really don't care.</br>  <br>It's sad Yuto had to get eaten during his first meeting with Yuya. I kinda hoped they would have had more interactions</br>  <br>Not even worthy of the baitfish.</br>  <br>ok.</br>    Y'know what I think is a nice touch. When Sora and Yuzu Fusion Summon, they do the "clap your hands together" shit. <br><br>Reiji, Yuya and Masumi, who didn't learn to Fusion Summon from Academia, don't do the clapping thing and all have their own unique poses. Ryozanpaku does the clap, suggesting they have some connection to Academia.</br></br>  <br>Stay shit kiddo.</br>  <br>Why were Yugi's clothes during the dungeon dice monsters arc so much better than his other sets?</br>  <br>How do plan on fighting for the Resistance if you can't even make your own RR deck?</br>  <br> Ryozanpaku does the clap <br>They do? I remember Kachidoki doing kung fu poses.</br></br>    <br> tfw she uses Nekroz in Tag Force Special <br><br>The absolute horror.<br><br>DM had plenty of fanservice and Heart of the Cards is just Destiny Drawing which still exists. Also YGO is beating Pokemon in the TCG by miles. YGO and MTG are still kings.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But now that they see that the cards ain't beating Pokemon anytime soon <br>Yu-Gi-Oh kicks the shit out of Pokemon and MtG. It's been the best selling card game for a while now. <br><br>The rest of your post is just nonsense that doesn't even deserve to be dignified with a response but I felt that part needed to be actually corrected.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuzu does it too, granted she learned from Sora, but it's interesting to note that she doesn't have to do it and she knows it.</br>  <br>Because back then, he didn't dress like a metrosexual and an outlet for the author's weird fashion sense. I still want to know what the fuck was he thinking about when he made the final boss of the series a monster with a demon dragon dick. At least Tragodeia, wasn't as offensive even he flushed 5 thousand years down the toilet against two teenagers.</br>  <br>Cause this keeps getting in the way of my deckbuilding.</br>  <br>It's not beating MtG, except in Japan.<br><br>And Pokemon is coming back somewhat, but it's definitely behind Magic and Yugioh.</br></br></br>  <br>He does this, but I don't think its really a clap?<br>He just does kung fu poses.</br></br>  <br> what the fuck was he thinking about when he made the final boss of the series a monster with a demon dragon dick <br>He said that he was ill and under a lot of stress at the time, and regrets that design choice. It was changed for the tankobon.</br></br>  <br>Yuma of all people has the strongest deck of the protagonists, his monsters shit on everything all 4 of them can bring out and then some.<br><br>Where's the justice?</br></br></br>  <br>Embrace the degeneracy, anon. You know you want to.</br>  <br>Have you completely forgotten what Yugi wore in Duelist Kingdom? He's always been metrosexual.</br>  <br>I just went back and checked and you're right, Kachidoki doesn't do it. He pounds his fist together, but ends on another pose.<br><br>The other guys both do the clap at the end of their poses, though, I'm PRETTY sure.</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't Yu-Gi-Oh have the world record for best selling card game? How would it have that if it's not beating Magic?</br>  Is there any canon het couple on the YGO franchise?<br>I think the only one is YugixAnzu and only for an interview where Takahashi mentioned Anzu eventually settle down with Yugi after the manga end</br>  <br>I wouldn't go that far, his Xyz are certainly something, but half of the protagonists don't even have updated decks.</br>  <br>YGO had it at one point but Magic overtook it.</br>  <br>Tea looks like she's gonna commit a homicide.</br>  <br> Is there any canon het couple on the YGO franchise? <br>Parents of characters? Yuma and Kotori is probably the 2nd closest you can get.</br></br>  <br>YGO has best selling while MTG has most played. YGO sells way more cards than MTG by quite a lot, but more people do not play it. <br><br>Either way they're still #1 and #2. Hell I think even Hearthstone has passed the Pokemon TCG now.</br></br></br>  <br>Yugioh zexal there was a heteral couple at episode 93 I think,   Also Hopefully Yuya and Yuzu get married  </br>  <br>Yugi doesn't. Judai has Elemental Masked as his deck, Neos will forever be shit, Yusei will have a shit load of stardust stuff and synchron warrior stuff from last year and Yuma is Utopia cancer and gagaga's. He's fine, Yugi fucking needs something, maybe retrained Silent Magician and Swordsman will be enough.</br>  <br>Hetero*</br>  <br>I'm most offended by Yugi being attached to your shitpost</br>  <br>Pokemon is still healthy as a TCG, but it's definitely never going to get to the level of popularity that it had during Gen 1 again.</br>  <br>Do Yusei and his bike and Kaiba and his Blue Eyes count? Because vehicles are usually given female names and Blue Eyes was a girl at one point.</br>  <br> Had a Base 1 Charizard <br> It got stolen </br></br>  <br>Oh yeah, it's healthy, but it's certainly not more popular than YGO like that Anon shitposted about.<br><br>Just wait for the movie, he'll get more.</br></br></br>  <br>It was probably worthless because you were a kid and didn't take care of it anyway.</br>   No hair down Yuzu with Yuya scene <br><br>Why Arc-V?</br></br>  <br>Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL, but worst girl won</br>  <br>Yugi will probably get the new BLS and Gaia stuff</br>  <br>Well Yugo needs to have one last good memory before he gets eaten right? I mean it'll contrast with Yuto whose entire last memories were nothing but suffering and misery.</br>  <br> Just wait for the movie, he'll get more. <br>I wonder if Ritual summoning will be a think in the movie. They've gotta restrict themselves back to fusion, that and advance summoning and they've gotta make the cards good to support Dark Magician and Blue eyes white dragon in this extra deck dominated format or at least decent enough to have Tanoshii and Eagos with.</br></br>  Please don't bully Leo Akaba.<br><br>He's just trying to save the world from two dickass Gods.</br></br>  <br>If only Kaiba found the way to bring his waifu back to the real world on the upcoming movie. Japan is the land of asspulls so it isn't THAT farfetched</br>  <br> Ritual <br> Relevant in the anime <br><br>Oh you. Also I fully expect them to give Kaiba and Yugi Synchros, Xyz, Pendulums and all sorts of other shit. I mean it doesn't really have to follow any amount of logic to be honest, what with the constant time travel, dimensions, etc.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just throw all the RaidRaptors in there, with Singing and Impale at 2 and everything else at 3, summoner monk, Noden, 2 Revolution Forces and an Astral Force, fuckloads of Rank 4s and standard traps and spells</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Ironically no one even denied what I said to be false. More likely anger over the truth hurts. I respect your decision to watch what is basically a fan service anime to fish in more lonely weeaboo men like myself but at some point. I'm sure you all recognize the bullshit in front of you.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The holographic level 76 base-set Charizard that could OTK even Rain Dance Blastoise with 4 double-colorless in the deck?<br><br>I stole that from a kid. I also stole a Five-God Dragon Japanese print from another kid.</br></br></br>  <br>Why does he look like a bald Yliaster reject?</br>  <br>It's not a fanservice anime. One scene showing a character after taking a bath after being stuck in the same clothes for four days isn't the norm.</br>  <br>Here's your reply, thanks for bumping our thread.</br>  <br>I thought YGO was only followed by fujoshis. I mean the actual cartoon because the DM game is for neckbeards only</br>  <br>But anon.</br>  <br> Rituals <br> not going to be relevant in the movie <br>;)<br> we've been getting lots of nostalgia support lately </br></br></br></br>  <br>You do realize that the anime is followed almost entirely by fujoshi in Japan, right?</br>  <br>I can never not think of Lex when I see Leo. And Shinji reminds me of disco Nightwing.</br>  <br>Remember when Pegasus tried bringing his waifu back too?<br><br>It's possible, but I doubt it. I mean think of it this way. BBT is canon, Yusei brought back bikes and synchro with him. <br><br> yfw Yugi or Judai brought both ideas to Kaiba and he started work on bikes and Synchros along with Pegasus <br><br>Xyz is a different story however, but I'm sure they'd just pull some bullshit anyways like getting sent to another dimension or the future.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Pegasus is a faggot while Kaiba is Japan's favorite by far.</br>  <br>Pegasus, not everyone else with a waifu is as extreme as you are</br>  <br> tfw Pegasus is Yuya grown up and hurled through time <br> tfw Cecillia is actually Yuzu who dyed her hair blonde so Ruri could escape </br></br>  <br> not everyone else with a waifu is as extreme as you are </br>  Gentlemen please, your emotions are getting the best of you.  <br>I would suck this man's penis.</br>    <br>Your plan is going to fail horribly and the multi-verse is going to collapse, all because you couldn't let two fourteen year olds be lewd.</br>  <br>Nakajima pls.</br>  <br>Who said that wasn't my plan in the first place?</br>  <br>I wonder exactly how far Yuya would go to keep Yuzu from serious harm or death. Would he damn a whole world?</br>  <br>Probably, remember what Atem did when Hugo taunted him over Yugi's soul. Remember what Judai did when Johan went missing. etc.</br>  I bet no one even knew Kiba had Green hair originally.  <br>Is there anyone here who hasn't seen green hair kaiba at least once on some shitty youtube upload of season 0 or from the opening?<br>http://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=P5AR<wbr>lPIgKRI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Pretty obvious the cycle is as follows<br><br>Yuya and his Yuzu appear in Dimension X.<br><br>Fun times with Yuya and Yuzu<br><br>TRAGEDY, ded Yuzu<br><br>Yuya goes berserk and destroys everything<br><br>Dimension Y is created, Yuya and Yuzu grow close<br><br>TRAGEDY<br><br>Yuzu dies, Yuya goes berserk<br><br>To break the cycle, we're going to need a change of formula.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Judai killed all of his friends and became edge king of the Dark World and he wasn't even fucking Johan<br>The multiverse is fucked if something happens to Yuzu</br></br>  <br>Yes and we all didn't know that Atem used to kill people in a variety of games, or that Kaiba tried killing people by using a serial killer, right?</br>  <br>It'd kind of be pretty cool if there was endless cycles and shit, maybe not to that extent, but it'd be cool regardless. <br><br>I'm curious how the worlds or this timeline and shit got all fucked to begin with.</br></br></br>  <br>So DUEA to CROS is DT Storyline<br><br>CORE and DOCS are Red-Eyes/Summoned Skull and Black Luster Soldier/Gaia respectively.<br><br>What do you think the next two sets will be about?<br><br>Toons, Harpies, Blue-Eyes, HEROs, Cyber Dragons, Synchron, Blackwings (Especially Blackwings) and Pendulum Magicians got recent support.<br><br>I say Guardians, Amazoness and maybe Gagaga's (It should have been the next Structure instead if Master of Pendulum) should get more support</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ojamandala or we riot</br>  <br>But Leo's messing with the natural order by invading and collecting the bracelet girls. If every dimension was kept walled off from each other, all the dimensional kids would've been fine.<br><br>Remove Akaba</br></br></br>  YAMEROOOOO  <br>Dragon Rulers #17 and Blackwings #47. <br><br>But really, I'd imagine.<br><br>Cardians, Underworld Troupe, Blue Eyes, Pendulum Magicians, Moonlight, Synchrons, More D/D/D and RR support, HEROs, Speedroids. <br><br>Blue-Eyes, Toon, and Cyber Dragons recently got some. Toon and Cyber Dragons are in CORE I believe.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  These newer characters have nearly zero actual personality to them. It's not even worth the effort. I could watch Lucky Star and have the same feeling this show gives. <br><br> Black Cards?, It was only a matter of time. I remember threads in 09 about that and no one thought they'd be stupid enough to do it. Guess /a/ was wrong. <br><br> More math is involved cause why not. Let's learn while we play a fucking anime card game. <br><br> White fucking Synchro...that's not even worth mentioning. Better off with Special Summonings and Fusions. These cards are for the younger generation. Not the 17-20+ who grew up on it. <br><br>Hey how about we get some pink cards into the mix, you know? To satisfy the female audience and players?<br><br>Oh wait we're all men aren't we.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Insects and Dinosaurs</br>  <br>The natural order is that those extras don't exist in the first place. Standard, Fusion, and Synchro should all be the same place. I don't know if Zexal was ever apart of the DM/GX/5Ds world, but I'd imagine it was just farther in the future. <br><br>Akaba is trying to fix shit and likely Yusho is helping him. Yuya/Reiji vs. Yusho/Leo. It just depends on which dimension is the prime one in the first place, I'd imagine Standard and Leo is just using Fusion to 'fuse' the dimensions, but who knows.</br></br></br>  <br>You're trying to hard. You tried shitposting in the threads a few days ago and got shit on, and now you're changing you're tactic. <br><br>I wonder what must go through your mind to spend your time doing this. Do you need someone to talk to Anon? <br><br>Phantom Knights will get cards before those do.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yuya's already prepared to abandon everyone else to go with Crow so he can find Yuzu. So yeah he would.</br>  <br> Hey how about we get some pink cards into the mix, you know? To satisfy the female audience and players? <br>Shitposters not knowing what the fuck they're talking about, as usual.</br></br>  <br>HANASE MONSTA KADO</br>  <br>Oh, so you don't like to learn math?</br>  <br>Dammit, Yugo you lucky bastard!</br>  How fucked would Shun have been had the rest of the group not decided to independently instigate their jailbreak at the same time he broke out of solitary confinement?<br><br>What was he planning on doing? Punching his way through the rest of the guards and probably the prisoners too?</br></br>  read the guide for questions: buyfag.moe  <br>Karen the british slut when?</br>  FUCK  Never  It really doesn't look right, but I still want her. I might as well just get it  Cute as fuck  Anyone know of a decent display unit that would fit into a 24cm wide space?  <br>Her dress is too big she looks like an orphan child dressed in hand me downs</br>  <br>ikea</br>  <br>Horse pussy</br>  <br>It's the least awful Flonne that there ever will be so you might as well.</br>  <br>Ikea isn't a display unit.</br>  <br>I'm really mad about how much the price of figures have gone up in the past couple of years.</br>  <br><br>The price is different bu you're paying almost the same with how weak the yen is now.</br></br>  <br>It still seems like more, but outside of importers, how about domestic buyers?<br>Their main market is getting screwed with having to pay a lot more, although, i'd say the quality of figures have gone up as well as the prices at least.</br></br>  I have a question for you guys on something I'm conflicted about.<br><br>I want to buy the manga of Mikakunin de Shinkoukei, but can't read nip for shit, and doubt I ever will.<br><br>So why do you guys buy manga that you can't read? I'm conflicted about buying it because I wouldn't be able to read it, but having it would be nice. Even if it would just sit on my shelf.<br><br>Is buying it worth the fact that I can't use it?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> It's the least awful Flonne that there ever will be so you might as well. <br>Don't be so honest with me it hurts, the nendo was alright</br></br>  The following release dates have been confirmed:<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 7st July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Nendoroid Plus Trading Rubber Straps: The Rolling Girls<br>FREEing - Sayaka Miki: Yukata Ver.<br>FREEing - Miki Hoshii: Yukata Ver.<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 13th July 2015:<br>FREEing - Kagamine Rin (Senbonzakura)<br>FREEing - Kagamine Len (Senbonzakura)<br>FREEing - Kagamine Rin &amp; Kagamine Len (Senbonzakura)<br>FREEing - Dynamic Change Shin Getter Robo<br><br>Arrival at wholesale stores on the 13th July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Nendoroid Plus: KanColle Straps - 5th Fleet<br><br>Shipping out from GSC on the 16th July 2015:<br>Good Smile Company - Nendoroid Umi Sonoda</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Karen nendo would make my heart explode.</br>  <br>The main purpose of a raincoat can't be utilized when there's no rain, but that doesn't make it useless to own on clear days.</br>  <br> I'm conflicted about buying it because I wouldn't be able to read it <br>This is something that you can do something about, you know.</br></br>  <br>Learn moon, faggot.</br>  What is the quality on WING figures normally like? Closer to main GSC or FREEing?  <br>Buy it if you can appreciate it sitting on a bookshelf. I see it as buying official merchandise. Go for it if you like the series and it's at a fair price.</br>  It begins. Hopefully.  <br><br>You want to read it?<br><br>Get in in english.<br><br>You want it just to have it in your collection?<br><br>Get the Original Japanese version.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>A good Karen scale would make my dick explode.</br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with Racing?</br></br>  <br>Horse racing Miku?</br>  anyone get a payment e-mail for her yet? i'm not dying to have her, but she's holding my june order back  <br>When it comes to that era of figures, you gotta take what you can get. I have Daiki's Mint, and her face never stops looking a bit wrong...</br>  <br>...but it's nothing compared to Koto's version.</br>  <br>I will never own that whole set.</br>  <br><br>how awful</br></br>  <br>Pic related is the designer</br>  <br>I laughed more than I should have.</br>  <br>She looks like that character from Onechanbara</br>  <br>Maybe GSC is gonna sponsor a NASCAR team.</br>    <br>What retard drew this. The race queens wear the design. Why would you cover their entire ass and back and make them wear that heavy shit and awkward half dress.</br>  <br>She's a wholesome Christian racing queen.</br>  <br>sauce of that bike?</br>  <br>It came with a Silver Surfer toy ages ago. It looks pretty rad.</br>  Even if she's at Wonfes, I guess she won't actually release till next year at the earliest.  <br><br>I'd buy a Texan stereotype Miku statue.</br></br>  <br>That movie was retarded</br>  <br>Yeah, that why I asked, thanks for the info anon<br>It will looks much better if you painted black or silver</br></br>  <br>I haven't watched it yet, don't plan to. I just happen to own many dinosaurs.</br>  http://myfigurecollection.net/list/<wbr>35369<br><br>Is this seriously every single male nendo? Most of it is western, vidya, or fujoshit.</br></br></wbr>  <br>Just like most of female nendos are moe shit.</br>  <br>Define moeshit.</br>  <br>Well yeah maleshit is for scum.</br>  <br>true, but dinosaurs.</br>  <br>Who were you expecting?</br>  <br>something you look at and think "shit, that's moe"</br>  <br>I didn't say it was bad</br>  <br>So it's a good thing?</br>  <br>I don't know what you want and I don't even think you know what you want <br><br>What are the male characters that you want nendos of?</br></br></br>  hiscore girl nendo announced, yet next to no capcom or snk nendos to be found  <br>I have a combination of the 3. It's cool I guess, but if I had more space I'd dedicate my display to more helves with spotlights shining down on them. I have the spotlights, but I just haven't gotten around to installing them.</br>  <br>This likely sounds pretty fucking stupid but I think it'd be nice to see some of the Jojos in nendo form.</br>  <br>Impossible, Bandai owns the JoJo rights.</br>  <br>  jojo <br>  not fujio bait <br>But yes I want some too. Sadly we will never get any.</br></br></br>  How did you all like the gender bender arc?  <br>so what's the goal for these mysterious weeaboo alien jews?</br>  <br>I think they want earth resource or land.<br>Source episode 209.<br> That's right its the fake trailer. <br><br>Will we get another movie ?</br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they release new Gintama figs for the new season or at least re-releases<br><br>bonus points if they're genderbent figs</br></br>  Is Gintama ever going to go back to being good? I feel like the new anime has been hit and miss compared to the last two and the manga has been horrible since they started carrying these serious arcs on way too long.<br><br>I've been reading almost since it started and it's one of my favorite series, I can tell it still has the potential to be good because the new anime has been fairly decent so far, its just like.. come on.<br><br>Why won't Sorachi just end it all already? We know the manga's never going to be able to go back to the status quo and be as funny as it was before not to mention we hardly see any of the things that previously made Gintama great anymore.<br><br>Gintama is just another Naruto or Bleach to me now unfortunately.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> bonus points if they're genderbent figs <br>Amen brother</br></br>  New CC thread after the last was destroyed by shitposting.          I love this Dance.</blockquote>]
