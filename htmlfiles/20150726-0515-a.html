I'm finally more than halfway done.

I'll remember your tripcode.</br>  <br><br>And I thought /a/ was dead.</br></br>  <br>I really hate namedropping in shows like these.

For some reason I felt a lot less phazed by all of urobutcher's "suffering for the sake of suffering" shit in this season compared to just about anything else he's done. (Was he even still in charge of it?) Could he be losing his edge?</br></br>  <br>Never mind, I should have read the thread before posting. Uroboshi not being behind it explains a lot of shit.<br><br>He's at least behind the movie though, right?</br></br></br>  <br>https://<span>youtu.be/20PwaJYcnuk  [ ]</br>  <br><br><br>Pretty much the majority either disliked or thought S2 was a downgrade.<br>Yes, Movie is Butcher and Fukami, just like S1.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Urobuchi is writing the movie with Makoto Fukami (They co-wrote season 1). Also as someone said earlier in this thread season 2 never happened.</br></br>  <br>Okay, this is disturbing.</br>  This reminds me of Dark Souls.<br>People shit on the second installment, because the lead writer changed and somehow retroactivly praise the first installment despite turning to shit halfway through.<br>Third installment will apparently save us all.<br>The fuck.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off /v/</br>  <br> You are the /v/ </br>  <br>Why does everything have to be compared to Dark Souls? It's like DS is the measure of everything. Yes anon, Psy Cop Ass is basically Dark Souls with future cops.</br>  <br>Not him but you missed the point. <br>He used Dark souls as an example how totally fucked up 2nd game made people praising the 1st one too much. <br>That said I don't agree with him. PP S1 was ok on it's own without needing shitty S2 so it shines compared to a truckload of manure.</br></br></br>  <br>I know, I was just making a hyperbole there.</br>  <br><br>we won't get the subs until the BD release.</br></br>  <br><br>Greatest ally</br></br>  <br>Fuck off Flipfag.</br>  Sorry, OOT question &amp; i don't want to make a new thread<br><br>Is Mushishi Zoku Shou: Suzu no Shizuku BD have been out yet?<br> https://www.livechart.me/summer-20<wbr>15/movies</wbr> <br>because that site say so,  but there is still no RAW around </br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm only a few episodes into this series but why the fuck are humans even alive in this series?<br><br>The technology they have can materialize anything instantly and there's clearly some kind of all powerful god computer somewhere doing all of this.<br><br>I get why you would need scientists and maintenance crews but why would you need anyone else? Surely robots could do 99% of the things that most of the population are doing.<br><br>Anything a human could do the computers can simply do better.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Buy it and upload it then anon</br>  <br> I'm only a few episodes into this series <br> The technology they have can materialize anything instantly <br>Are you confusing holograms with actual stuff?<br>They don't have Star Trek replicators in PP verse.</br></br></br></br>  <br/>  <br> The technology they have can materialize anything instantly <br>That's wrong<br> clearly some kind of all powerful god computer somewhere doing all of this <br>And it's doing it for humanity. What's the point in doing things for humanity if you killed them all?<br> why would you need anyone else? <br>Why would a scientist need a lawyer to help with his divorce settlement? Why would a maintenance worker need a chef to get good food? Tell me when you get robots that can cook /good/ food.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There's no way in fucking hell that technology would get as advanced as in that series and still be so behind on so many fields unless someone was deliberately sabotaging research that would lead to more efficient means of production.</br>  <br> Anything a human could do the computers can simply do better. <br><br>Not to Urobuchi, Kikokugai had androids that can imitate emotions, but even the most sophisticated script or programming can't reach up to human level.<br>Same for P-P, robots aren't sophisticated enough to be capable of judgement so that part is still left to the humans. <br><br><br>I think that's released with the show's 6th BD. It doesn't have a standalone release as far as I can tell.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy, you have no idea...</br>  <br>Wait, the Mushishi movie is out? And it's direct to BD? Fuck me, is anyone gonna sub it?</br>  https://twitter.com/DIV8_ASDF/statu<wbr>s/624859322145570817<br><br> English ver. of "PSYCHO-PASS MANDATORY HAPPINESS" <br><br> on Xbox One </br></br></br></br></wbr>  <br> There's no way in fucking hell that technology would get as advanced as in that series and still be so behind on so many fields <br>They can't go full Utopia yet since Japan and the rest of the world are still recovering from some global catastrophe / war.</br></br>  <br> Xbone <br>Into the trash it goes...</br></br>  <br>Seriously? Never expected it to be localized. <br>I'll never understand why 5pb is so loyal to the xbone.</br></br>  <br>Dirt cheap console licensing fees, I'd imagine.</br>  WARMLY WAITING FOR SUBS  <br>I don't get why you'd release a VN on a console exclusively to begin with, but whatever, that's kinda neat.</br>  I miss moe Akane.  <br>It uses kinect and smartglass capabilities.<br><br><br>It's probably the last time they bother with the xbone, now that Chaos;Child flopped.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Not saying S1 was bad, but S2 wasn't bad either.<br>The blind idolizing of one person needs to stop.</br></br>  Just asking, did they have announced the 3rd season or the 2nd movie for Psycho-pass series? I mean the movie was great, but thar wasn't climax about sybil that we want to know  <br>S2 was great, even if only for the memes.<br><br> Godrobe Kirito is holding 2, 4, 5, 8 Dominators. </br></br></br>  <br>S1 was good though. DS1 was also good.</br>  <br>S2 was good though. DS2 was also good.<br>Funny how opinions work.</br></br>  <br>Psycho-Pass 2 was an abomination, and this has nothing to do with blindly idolizing Gen Urobuchi. If it hadn't been a complete piece of shit, you wouldn't see so many people calling it so regardless of who wrote it.</br>  <br>No announcement yet but they want to make more. The movie was successful too, so it's only a matter of time.</br>  <br>You seem insecure.<br> Season 1 sucked, too. </br></br>  <br>Tfw Moe and Smug Akane are gone for good</br>  <br>There is definitely another season or movie for this franchise. I mean, look at that after credit scene. It is open access for another story, and yes the movie wasn't climax that we want</br>  <br>Akane and Kogami haven't killed each other yet, of course there's going to be more</br>  <br>Akane ftw</br>  Fuck me this is good  <br>Any update on this anons progress?</br>  <br> Psycho-Pass 2 was an abomination, and this has nothing to do with blindly idolizing Gen Urobuchi <br>Actually it does. It suffered the exact same problems as the first season.</br></br>  <br>He's about halfway through, but the man needs sleep. Please be paitent and wait warmly for him to finish</br>  <br> It suffered the exact same problems as the first season. <br>Elaborate.</br></br>  <br> Bad animation <br>This is a given <br> Character being entirely irrelevant and not doing shit  <br>Once again the cast is underutilized. The movie seems to suffer from this as well where nobody but Akane can do anything<br> Piss poor characterization  <br>In season one the only good character was Ginoza, in season two the only good character is Ginoza. Mika seems like too much of a joke to take seriously, Akane is still dull as shit and apparently they didn't have time to do much with the second division which is why they all get killed off like nothing. <br> Terrible villain <br>Both Shogo and Momma's boy are shit. Kamui is surprisingly not as much as a pretentious twat as Shogo<br> Retarded plot twist <br>In season one it was brain in the jar in season two it was Kamui having 8 brains<br><br>Both are shit of different color, Ubakata didn't make Psycho Pass worser than it already have though I'll rate S2 lower just for being a waste of time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> worser <br>Opinion disregarded</br></br>  SUBS SOON<br><br>ANGUIS DID NOTHING WRONG</br></br>  <br> Bad animation <br>Besides quality control issues and disaster that was ep.18 it was ok.<br> Once again the cast is underutilized. <br> nobody but Akane can do anything <br>You mean like Kogami who basically dragged Akane around for larger part of S1?<br>Everyone was doing something in S1 even if lesbian cutie was basically a secretary and Kagari a bro used for target practice.<br>Anyway S1 felt like they actually worked as a team most of the time even when Gino was being a dick about enforcers being dogs and all that shit.<br> in season two the only good character is Ginoza. <br>You must be fucking joking. Besides the 2 minutes 'romance' with Inspector deadmeat hastily tacked on for some cheap sympathy points Gino might as well be non existent in S2.<br> Retarded plot twist <br>Retarded opinions.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> In season one the only good character was Ginoza, in season two the only good character is Ginoza.  <br>Sure, ginoza was the one and only "straight" character, but his character doesn't make any development in every season or movie.</br></br>  Shy, girly imouto Tsubasa is a miracle of the universe and the cutest gear.  Nana is going to will over 20k BD sales  I want my alpha Tsubasa back  <br> implying <br>This is still symphogeah and not Nanoha</br></br>  However, avant-garde airhead Sakimori is also great.   that Micha sex voice <br> mfw someone replicated Yukarin's voice so we'll have a backup if she ends up retiring or killing herself </br>  Tsubasa and Maria are the worst characters.  <br>I agree. Tsubasa is alright though.</br>  <br>It's okay, Hibiki. You'll be useful again soon. There's no need to be bitter.</br>  <br>No</br>  Hibiki is a huge pussy. I hope she loses some body part again.  What are the chances that Tsubasa will get a loli Kanade back through some alchemy means and she will have to take care of her as mama along either Maria or Chris?  <br>Stop it.</br>  <br>I'd rather have everyone being turned into little girls via a magic relic and Maria taking care of all of them.</br>  <br>Whats next people making a Busou Renkin thread and shitposting about Touka?</br>  Someone know when GLORIOUS BREAK will be released?  Genjuro or Maria: who is the better parent?  <br>Probably Maria.</br>  Is this a moe Tsubasa thread? I can get behind this.  <br> Maria. Genjuro is great, but I have a soft spot for the FIS girls and their chemistry and feel that Maria would be a seriously good mother. </br>  <br>Genjuuro. How is this even a question? Maria isn't even in parent mode yet, only onee-chan mode.</br>  <br>Genjuuro doesn't have any kids either, does he?</br>  <br>Genjuro duh.<br><br><br>Chris.<br>Bikki soon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Nana and Iguchi talking about how Tsubasa got more SAKIMORI in GX but then occasionally turns moe around Maria in the radio show all the time. </br>  <br>Neither. Genjuuro is the cool uncle, and Maria is the doting Onee-chan.<br><br> Best living Geahs. </br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for not watching GX.</br>    TAKANARE<br>JII BEAT</br>  <br>Soon<br> mfw we get JII JII JII </br></br>  <br>I want cute SoL with these three.</br>  <br> Loli Kanade still manages to be alpha as fuck and gets her Gungnir back </br>  <br>You're supposed to be calling Hibiki out, Shirabe, not imitating her.</br>  <br>Your wish shall be granted. She'll lose her buttcheeks.</br>  <br>I want Biki to save me while her gear whistles her heart out.</br>  <br>Good. Maybe now she can fucking stand up for herself.</br>  <br>Horrendous taste.</br>  <br>They are obviously getting set up to have their own spinoff.</br>  <br>The man has a legitimate relative that is Tsubasa which he constantly neglects. He may be cool and strong but in parenting terms fuck that guy.</br>    Who here /waiting for commie/?  <br>Micha's voice isn't exactly as arousing as Yukarin's though. There's a different feeling.</br>   1/3 of Kiri song is filled with DESS <br> mfw Shirabe might get the song with so many JII the preorder topped 1-6 place on amazon </br>  <br>Seeing manly Bikki turns me into a shy beta housewife.</br>  <br>Miku please.</br>  Fresh of the presses <br><br> Pls dont judge, I don't usually make these types of thing </br></br>  <br>How gay is Kirika's song anyways? Wonder if Shirabe can top it.</br>  <br>How will Maria deal with Chris rape PTSD?</br>  <br> which he constantly neglects. <br>Well, she's like 17, has her own career and is fully capable of defending herself. She's happy with her life, she's just a little socially awkward.<br>If anything, he's just following through with what he said in G.</br></br></br>  Please stay in your own threads and stop shitting up other threads. Thank you.  <br>This isn't the YuYuYu thread though.</br>  <br>She's 19</br>  <br>And that's why he isn't showing much concern, she can take care of herself(Just can't keep her room tidy).</br>  HIBKI CANNOT LOSE.  <br> no border stroke <br>That's not how it works you little  not-shit. </br></br>  <br>Lots of love and hugs and Apple lullabies  and food. </br>  Pour one out for mommu  <br>I bet Genjuuro gives the kind of hugs that crack your back</br>  <br><br>What was with that line about kirika being more sensible? Was that a HS screwup?</br></br>  <br>I want to  be forced to cuddle  with her in a big bed.</br>  <br>What are you implying?</br>  <br>That's japanese gold, over 300 years of experience, all the best to Mama.</br>  NEW CHAPTER OUT<br><br>http://www.mangareader.net/boku-no-<wbr>hero-academia/52</wbr></br></br>   this entire chapter    MAJI DE!?   zateto  "Baka!"<br><br>(It means stupid)</br></br>  we live  boku no pico   HAIAI !

It's not GSC store exclusive I hope.  All these great figures and new nendos, but no decent new animu related figmas. Come on wonfest, you're killing me here!  What's everyones preorders?  <br>go fuck yourself with this bullshit again</br>  <br>Same as last thread.</br>  <br>Wait for it to really start.</br>  In this time before wonfes, i'd like to make a question for all buyfags.<br><br>What is your dream figure that will NEVER get made? And i'm not talking "anything my waifu", i'm talking about a very specific figure based on a illustration or moment from a show that you are 100% sure will never be made, but you'd buy it instantly if it was. As an example, for me it would be a figure based on this illustration.</br></br>  <br>Go fuck yourself.</br>  Hopefully we'll get a painted huke Saber Alter.  <br>I'd be surprised if we didn't to be honest</br>  I Hope there's MonMusu stuff  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> print this out on all the computers in a computer lab back in high school  <br> somehow don't get in trouble </br></br>  <br>This</br>  <br>This.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br> get a boner watching rape and torture shit <br> this made me flaccid <br>thats so fucking disgusting pls kys</br></br></br>  <br>Help me in starting to dislike the mouth too, I don't want to splurge 200 bucks on her but I'm still fine with the crazy face.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128566046 <br> not wanting to watch tama's cute belly get drenched in cum <br>Fag.</br></br>  <br>The only explanation is that one of your school's higher-ups was into scat</br>  <br>Why does this even exist? It looks like shit and it's not relevant to Miku at all, I'm guessing it's based on some dumb illustration.<br><br>Why would you do that when there are tons of worthy Miku modules from the various Project Diva games?<br><br>Retards</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Your new is showing.</br>  <br>This is actually pretty creative bait, i commend you for the effort</br>  <br> it's not relevant to Miku at all <br><br>You're right.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't get it if you don't want to splurge.<br><br> shitposting this early </br></br></br>  <br>Miku is worst girl anyway. More Luka and Rin figures please.</br>  <br>Is this bait? It has to be, I refuse to believe that someone in here could be this retarded.</br>  <br>Newshit please go</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>This brings back memories.</br>    <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128565958 <br>holy shit I forgot all about this<br><br>man the early 2000s internet was the best. what ever happened to that spirit of fun and laughing at other peoples misfortune?<br><br>I miss the prank pulling 4chan</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Honestly, i want a Figma Black Hanekawa, in the cat PJ's. I REALLY want her in the bra and panties, but that seems too lewd for GSC, even though they've released lewd figma's before.</br></br>  <br> GK <br>Fuck I may as well.</br></br>  <br>That's the problem, I still want to and not even the mouth is making me want her less. The exclusive thing stings but on the other hand it means flat shipping, she's also not going to come out before April and I could safe up the money if I wanted to.<br>I'll have to wait for tomorrow for a few more pictures and if there are more potential pre-orders for next year that would fuck me over money wise.</br></br>  <br>What? I don't watch shit anime like Wixoss and it looks exactly like Miku.</br>  <br>Looks really good from behind but this face is a bit creepy. Hopefully he'll look better painted.</br>  <br>Then I would advice to just get it. Not all figs are perfect. May as well get it, especially if you're a wixoss fan. Unless they announce new figs its pretty much your only choice aside from nendroids and </br>  <br> shit anime like Wixoss <br>Don't be so salty Borutos only getting prize figs.</br></br>  Hey guys; just a quick question from a non-buyfag.<br>You guys do group orders for blind box type things? I really want to order picture related but I only want Kaede and not the others.<br>(source: amiami; around $30 for the set)</br></br>  <br>I'd treat them like TCG sets and just buy the bulk to guarantee kaede, unless otherwise stated or sold individually.</br>  <br>Check mfc.</br>  <br>check the myfigurecollection forum, they have a group buys section.<br><br>alternatively just sell the ones you don't want on ebay, it might take a while to get rid of them but you'll probably end up making a couple bucks in the end.</br></br></br>  Not really my thing but that's a good figure.  Nice.  <br>Is that some sort of harpie? Kinda sexy.</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I've done that before but for a set that I could at least give some of the others away to good homes. I just legitimately only care for her in this set and don't know anyone else that would want the rest (other then /jp but I stray from that place). Maybe the eBay route is the way to go.<br><br>Thanks guys. Have a free Kaede.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sirene from Devilman, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>235960</wbr></br>  <br>It's my kinda thing but that price tag.<br><br>I just want a harpy to hold me in her talons.</br></br></br>  <br>When and where? Don't even care how much.</br>  <br>You gotta pay for what you like. Mostly looking out for http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287569, http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>287874 and other monster girl figures (just don't really like Sirene enough to buy that)</wbr></wbr></br>  <br><br>Its Alter, so whenever it will be it'll be late.</br></br>  <br>I like harpies but I prefer slime girls.</br>  <br>A dragongirl or loli lamia would be my favorite to get a figure of.</br>  <br> underwear <br><br>It's shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>If you like Slimes, congrads, there's at least 5 Melona figures and a revoltech.</br></br>  <br>A figure of a girl with huge tits with a gaping asshole with cum or other accessories that can be put inside it.<br><br>OR<br><br>A figure of a girl getting impaled on a dick so big that it deforms her belly.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I already have Megahouse's Melona which is the only good looking one.</br>  <br>Please don't use a picture of Chris while shitposting.</br>  <br>These delicious slender bodies have been made for licking</br>  <br><br>The picture doesn't do it justice, but i have the pucchito and it's adorable. http://myfigurecollection.net/item/<wbr>35695</wbr></br></br>  <br>Sorry next time I'll use Kirika</br>  <br>Alternatively a PVC of one of the Milk Pot GKs.</br>  <br>same answer as last wonfes</br>  <br>That's better.</br>  canadafag wet dream  Enjoy the twenty-fifth of July.  <br>Goddamn those vagina bones look gross</br>    <br>Looks cute but I'm more into larger figures.</br>  Finally got this in the mail today. Hair and face could be better, but it's no big deal.  <br>Thanks doc</br>  <br>Thanks doc</br>   was meant for     How long til wonfes guys?  <br> kalaid </br>  <br>5 minutes.</br>  <br> implying this is pornography </br>  <br>Wouldn't they need to ram a metal pole into Sayaka's butt for them to float like that?</br>  <br><br>The Skytube and Griffin are easily as good looking as the Megahouse IMHO. I'm afraid to buy the Skytube figure, i'd be platinum mad if it arrived broken.</br></br>  <br>10 hours or so</br>  <br>Almost fell for your bait. Good work anon.</br>  <br>her back would work too</br>  <br>Berserk nendos.</br>  <br>Scales of the final fight of Jojo part 3. Specifically the scene where Jotaro and Dio both go in to punch with their stands at the same time.</br>  Just putting this here. Hope they put out a prototype soon.   waifu collection projected to grow too big by the end of the year <br> buy another one of these just for figures <br><br>Am I the only one that stores waifus in closed cabinets and only bring them out when its time to flex my powerlevel?<br><br>http://www.amazon.com/Sterilite-014<wbr>28501-4-Shelf-Utility-Platinum/dp/B<wbr>000063SLI/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Something has always been really off about those to me.</br>  <br>I have them and only Dio has a weird sculpt and paintjob.</br>  <br>Might as well put them back in their boxes if you are hiding them in a closed cabinet</br>  <br>What does this say?</br>  <br>Do you have a room with no window? How do you protect them from sunlight?</br>  <br> waifus <br> plural </br></br>  <br>Also, weren't Dio and The World sold seperately? That's a pain in the ass, too.</br>  <br> not having multiple figures of your waifu </br>  what do you do with your lewd figures?  <br>Pretty sure I preordered them together as a set from BiJ.</br>  <br><br>Unfortunately and surprisingly, nothing. <br><br>Give me suggestions of how to pose my Queen's Blade Revoltechs guys.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That Tama face doesn't go with that lewd body</br>  <br>Pose them  on top of a hot plate. </br>  <br>I can always build the cabinet without the doors, or keep the doors open for display. Closed cabinets make it easy to keep my figures safe and relatively free from dust and sunlight while still being easily accessible when its time to  fap vigorously .</br>  <br>Get a detolf dumbass.</br>  <br>This figure. Except good and without the stupid actual-feather wings. It's a garage kit that only one was made of. Even the kit never got released as far as I know.</br>  <br><br>I live in a first world country, we don't own hot plates here</br></br>  <br>I'm still waiting for the Max Factory one.<br>The face of the FuRyu looks weird</br></br>  <br>Somewhat. My displays have curtains, but nothing is stopping people from moving those.</br>  <br>Easier to draw and people don't mind it.</br>  <br>figures won't fade with as long as their not directly positioned in sunlight, you fucking retard. and regular cabinets don't do anything against dust either, as it would need to airtight. but as someone that faps to figures and then hides them away in a closed cabinet, it's no surprise you're so stupid.</br>  <br>he's talking about multiple cabinets. unless it's saber or miku I find that quite unlikely.</br>  <br>Then put it on the induction plate you elitist cunt.</br>      <br> Get a detolf <br><br> Detolf <br> Width: 16 3/4 " <br> Depth: 14 3/8 " <br> Height: 64 1/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 13 lb <br> $70 <br> have to drive to Ikea to pick up <br><br> Sterilite <br> Width: 25 5/8 " <br> Depth: 18 7/8 " <br> Height: 69 3/8 " <br> Max load/shelf: 40 lb <br> $77 <br> free Amazon shipping <br><br>Yeah, I'll take the one with more space/$.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>because noses are ugly. and sometimes they have no nose at all in the frontal perspective. praise non-euclidean geometry.</br>    Don't forget to preorder the 2015 figure of the year™!  <br> cabinets don't do anything against dust either <br>That's patently bullshit.<br> how circulation work <br>There is hardly any in a cabinet so little dust is deposited.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The reason for a detolf is that it's a display case. To display them from all sides. With that fancy "glass" stuff instead of dead tree dust.</br>    <br>Why is the word year trademarked?</br>  <br>Truly sufferring</br>    <br> those bellies <br>Jesus fuck</br></br>  <br>Vivid Red<br><br>At this point, there is no hope.</br></br></br>  <br> no miyu </br>  <br>I was it lucky to get it used, but in excellent condition for pretty cheap, so I can't complain. But yeah, the Max Factory one does have a better face and better hair, I'd say.</br>  ARIA finally get a new season, please give me a good quality fig of Akari WF!<br>Or better a good quality of her adult self, PLEASE!</br>  <br>Not him but I cut apart a large box, put foil on the side facing out and put it in the window directly across from my figures. It works well and keeps the heat out. The other window I just put a throw blanket over since it doesn't get direct sunlight and you can't see it from the outside.</br>  So what will you ask for uncle WonFes this year? <br>Personally I hope that figure of Millia from Guilty Gear Xrd by Wing shows up.</br>  <br><br><br>who is this fine and classy lady?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger detected</br></br>  <br>I second this.<br><br>I believe they made Vivid blue and Vivid yellow, so why they didn't made the best one ?</br></br></br>  <br> Akatsuki  <br>YESSS</br></br>  <br>They're just building suspense...</br>  <br>Where is she from? Stockings with those shorts + boots + comfy hoodie makes her adorable</br>  <br>She is from Tokyo Ravens.</br>  Any news or hope of the ooyodo nendo this wonder guys?  <br>I didn't see any teasers of her on the gsc twitter, but there was a taihou nendo teased</br>  <br>I hope it's her, all this lack of info is making me nervous she's not being made.</br>    <br>Hate to reply to a frogposter but I'd die for a good Judeau. Even the GK appears on YA approximately once every ten years.</br>  <br>I want the dragon form of nowi way more than a normal scale of her.</br>  <br>Any Momoiro.</br>  <br>Were you unable to read the English on the cover and google it yourself?<br><br>Are you even able to read my reply? Because it's also in English.</br></br></br>  <br> NEVER <br><br>So, any Square Enix properties that aren't Play Arts Kai shit?<br> Final Fantasy <br> Parasite Eve <br> Drakengard <br> pic </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I got a spooky girl yesterday. I think she's my favorite Alter witch. I was silly for not pre-ordering her.  What's the word on this Mio?  <br>The English on the cover doesn't say the name of the LN, and your reply didn't say it either.<br>  東京レイブンズ </br></br>  <br>Can't say that makes me sad.<br>Their character designs are fairly bland most of the time.</br></br>  <br><br>The Volks witches are really good. I own all of them. If you're trying to decide between that or the Alter one pick the pose you like the most. They're both great.</br></br>  <br>They make scale figures as well as PAK but the quality is normally mediocre to really bad.</br>  Would anything happen to a figure if it was in a car for a few hours and it's like 80 degrees out? It's in a parking garage though so it's in the shade.  When the fuck does Wonfes begin?  <br>Tomorrow at 6pm.</br>  <br>In 30mins time.</br>  <br>It's 1am in Japan, Jesus anon let them sleep.</br>  I need this  <br>You missed it, it was yesterday.</br>  <br>We are two anon, I want her to join my Sol and my futur Ky</br>  <br>Her face feels off to me</br>  <br>A year from now</br>  <br>Depends on the type of figure anon</br>  <br>She physically suffers from her body.</br>  <br>I'm not a fan of titty monsters but she looks amazing.</br>  <br>She's not a whore though.</br>  <br>I agree with the other anon. I'm really happy with mine.</br>  <br>who knows?</br>  <br>I hate boatshit but I like this titty monster<br><br> Garage Kit <br><br>fuck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I love her but it took me forever to get the strap on her shoulder</br>  <br>1/2</br>  <br>If they can work 16h a day I'm sure they can hurry up a bit, as well.</br>  <br>2/2</br>  <br><br>May the Lord have mercy upon your soul.</br></br>  <br><br>fuck off to mfc if you people want attention already</br></br>  <br><br> those potatoes <br><br> s2 never </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm glad I wasn't the only one. You really had to force it.</br></br>  <br>I mean proportion wise</br>  <br>Her massive tits are nice too.</br>  <br><br><br>there are so many awesome GK from abbyssal girls but they never pick them up, its as if they hated money</br></br></br>  <br>The name of the arc is clearly written in English.</br>  <br>But she could be easily bullied into the situation.</br>  would you an obaasan?  Anira will be expensive as hell  <br>I'll pay as long as she's under 26k</br>  <br><br>at least she'll be getting a mf scale soon.</br></br>  <br>you can't even fucking read katakana you blithering idiot<br>ヴ not ブ</br></br>  <br>Yeah she wasn't as bad as Lucchini but still so many of the witches have parts that are tough to put into place</br>  <br>I hope they dont actually go with that design, its the worst I've seen so far, not that its ugly, but lame as fuck</br>  <br> girls in armor  <br>That's my fetish</br></br>  <br>Any Vinland Saga, but especially the Thorkell vs. Thorfinn fight on the London Bridge.</br>  <br>Is the game really that popular? I tried it and it was pretty bland.<br>Or do people just like it for the art?</br></br>  <br>That is a lot of little toys.</br>  <br>It's one of the most popular mobage in Japan. Probably everyone have their reasons to play it</br>  <br>I like you.<br> also ridiculous tits </br></br>  <br>true and I need more scales of embarrassed girls</br>  <br> those thighs  <br> that armpit <br>Oh holy shit Tama</br></br></br>  <br> Lame as fuck <br> Giant girl with a fucking naval base around her <br> all the other Kancolle figs are the girl just standing there. That's it.  <br><br>You opinion is fucking shit and I don't even like Kancolle.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Max Factory Figma.</br>  <br> 1/8 <br>Isn't she fucking gigantic 1/1?</br></br>  <br>Why does everyone ignore the completely fucked up leg?</br>  <br>Only if you have a micropenis. :^)</br>  <br><br>but the pose itself is lame, the props are okay, but they could do better, just look at this other pics  </br></br>  <br>So  FOR YOU </br>  <br>Because thighs and armpit</br>  <br>I'd long since dismissed her for her face since the prototype, but holy shit.</br>  <br>She will be fine</br>  <br>armpits are disgusting, why do people like them? is it just the fetish people?</br>  <br>Not even once.</br>  <br>I want her to join my Dizzy and hopefully a different Ramlethal than the super expensive current one.<br>I'd totes get a Jack-O one too for the ass. Can't ever have too much PVC ass.</br></br>  <br>why doesn't he wear his mask?</br>  Too soon for prototype right guys?  <br>Nah its a pretry common feature people like, just like boobs armpits give off pheromones</br>  Would you?  Well that took an unexpected turn.   It made me feel so empty inside    <br>RAWS WHEN</br>  <br>So it's not gartes it's just part of the tool strap or whatever.</br>  <br>It is a garter belt but in that picture at least it looks like it's just connected to a garter and not stockings which is stupid as fuck</br>  Why Yuki wear blue uniform ?<br>Other girl wear green. But from Megu-nee perspective, Yuki's classmate also wear blue.<br>Am I missing something ?</br></br>  <br>Not just the garters themselves, but the garterbelt is covering her panties. How inconvenient is it for her to use the toilet?</br>  Since I fell asleep last time and it crashed, I'm just going to re-dump Patlabor, a dead scanlation.<br><br> In the near future, large mechs called Labors are made to assist in various reconstruction projects in major countries around the world that are being threatened by global warming. In Japan, the government has enacted Project Babylon in order to conduct land reclamation. Labors are also being pressed into police and military service, aside from civilian use. <br><br> However, terrorists are now attempting to use Labors to make themselves heard, as well as common criminals, thugs and guerrillas. The National Police Agency established the Special Vehicles Division, an all-Labor task force to combat the potential use of Labors for criminal/terrorist activities. <br><br> This title received the 36th Shogakukan Manga Award for shounen manga in 1991. </br></br></br></br></br></br>              Nice.       left to right <br>Whoa.

They said episode 3 will be done by this weekend.</br>  Why is Anna so  lewd?   <br>With her lewd side being held back for so long it's not wonder she'd be most lewd when she finnaly finds her "indecent" side.</br>  <br>I want to fuck her so bad.</br>  <br>you mean get fucked</br>  <br>I'm fine with either.</br>  <br>someone post the webm please</br>  How the hell do they expect the world to function in that world. I mean future adults would probably be completely ignorant of how to make children, or at least if they do find out life would be nothing but a boring ordeal all the way to your deathbed.<br><br>I'm kinda wondering if the story leads into some sort of comspirancy where it was actually someone hoping for exactly that, or was it just a "because i want a world without filth" thinking it wouldn't have consequences?</br></br>  <br>A lot of people who go on some moral crusade against this or that often fail to see the negative consequences their action will bring. A good example of this is of course Prohibition in the good ole US of A, where outlawing alcohol not only had the effect of INCREASING alcohol consumption, but also creating a massive criminal underground, and an entire counterculture that brought about a lot of social change.<br><br>Japan's method's in Shimoneta are more draconian, and therefor somewhat more effective, but they're having roughly the same effect, creating a criminal underground and counterculture that thrive on the illegal pornography. Of course the ban on lewdness in any form has another effect. Due the apparent lack of comprehensive sex ed, the Japan in Shimoneta is essentially raising an entire generation of adults that will have no clue what they're doing when it comes to procreation. This will have a few probable effects: Couples will have no idea how sex control works, so rampant pregnancies and confusion will follow. Couples will have no idea sex is even a thing, and will go their entire lives with out doing the act, and/or they will go about doing it wrong and never have kids. Lastly, you'll have couples going to underground or criminal sources for information on sex, both breaking down the very public moral that Japan is trying to enforce, and increasing crime where none existed before.<br><br>I don't know why I put so much though into the setting and repercussions of a what is essentially a gag show, but it sure it fun.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We wish we knew. The LN hasn't been translated while the manga only has 2 chapters translated. The only part of the LN that was translated was the love honey cookies scene. Hopefully some kind anon will work on it.  ;_; </br>  <br>Well it is a gag show, but it kinda takes itself seriously when explaining the repercussions it would have. Until Kajou throws in a random dirty joke out of nowhere that is.</br>  <br>I have no real basis for this but I don't think the pregnancy is going to be an issue.<br>Menstruation would cause way too many questions can't be answered without setting off the chokers so I think they probably give the females hormones/ birth control to prevent it. Granted I'm not a girl but it's really not hard to believe that suddenly bleeding from your crotch for days when you have no idea wtf is going on will cause freakouts.<br>There's just no plausible way i can think of for it to be explained to teenage girls without getting carted off to jail.<br>In essence we now have a generation that's essentially going to be sterile.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>There are similar problems to countries today which don't have comprehensive sex education. Basically people getting married or into relationships and having no idea what to do next.<br><br>Unwanted pregnancies, STDs spreading rampantly, general ignorance and superstition, or even insane cases like that one woman who used the wrong hole for 40 years.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting for Hiryuu subs.</br>  <br><br> "Tonight's special: A thick, steamy wiener. Enjoy, sir." </br></br>  <br> I think they probably give the females hormones/ birth control to prevent it <br>I highly doubt it given Japans population issues, also this wouldn't be the first time women would be in an environment where menstruation couldn't be adequately explained. When there's a lack of actual knowledge on something, people tend to just make shit up. I wouldn't be overly surprised to find that parents or educators, lacking the ability to properly explain the process, use overly vague terms, or stupid shit like "it's the lewdness/bad thoughts/devil, draining out" or "it's just something that happens to everyone, don't worry about it".</br></br>  <br> I don't know why I put so much though into the setting and repercussions of a what is essentially a gag show, but it sure it fun. <br>That's the thing, many shows that seem to be just gag shows with a ridiculous premise are actually engaging in some social commentary. This has plenty of it, Humanity Has Declined had plenty of it, Excel Saga had a shitload of it...</br></br>  <br><br><br>Your dicks, sir.</br></br></br>  <br><br> so rampant pregnancies and confusion will follow. <br> rampant pregnancies <br><br>This is Japan, after all. Perhaps this is the actual goal, to increase the number of pregnancies for the sake of Japan's future.</br></br></br></br></br>  So who's getting rape?  <br>The problem with that is that, when people don't know how pregnancies work, it can lead to a lot of problems. Bad care of the fetus, improper timing that makes life loads more difficult, plus on top of that with out knowing about birth control, after you've figured out the whole baby making bit, your either going to be pumping out so many kids it's going to affect your economic standing, leading to an overall increase in poverty, or you'll have people just abstaining from sex, putting a strain on marriages and potentially leading to an increase in divorces or spousal abuse/infidelity, thus creating a breakdown in public morals. <br><br>The system is almost designed to rip itself apart given enough time, and cause some serious damage to Japanese society.</br></br></br>  <br>Why is the black one the biggest? There is some mistake here waiter.</br>  <br>Everyone.</br>  <br>MC is getting raped</br>   yfw Clawhammer gets episode 4 out before Hiryuu gets episode 3 out     I detect a very high lewdness from the girl with the permablush that sits next to MC.  <br><br> hiryuu </br></br>  <br>You're not the only one.</br>  <br><br> Anna's ass <br> Kajo's ass <br><br>Which one first?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You don't need to teach anyone how to procreate. Animals get by just fine without a class and so can humans. Literal retards understand how to put penis in vagina and cumming is natural so a baby eventually happens.</br>  <br> implying Kajo won't do your ass first </br>  <br>Animals have better instincts than humans. Literal retards are at least exposed to the concepts involved, rather than being entirely shielded from them. Someone who's never even heard about what's involved could feasibly not work out for themselves that this goes in that until this happens. Sure, many will get there via trial and error, but not 100% of people.</br>  <br>Considering Kajo's libertine mindset she probably makes an effort to never wipe her ass leaving an old and crusty layer of shit surrounding her anus. <br><br>Just like that judge in the nights of sodom.</br></br></br>  <br>Anna has the bigger ass.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128551375 <br><span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128551581 <br><br>Get this normal shit out of here</br></br></br>  <br>Wut</br>    <br>yeah same</br>    <br>What manga</br>    <br>Well that couple pissed away their chance of having kids.</br>  <br>The design looks like MATRA Milan but idk which of his work.</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=VGg<wbr>_HTls8ME</wbr>  [ ]</br>  New episode when?

So yeah, it might have something to do with it.<br><br>I'm actually surprised that they aren't just storing sperms and eggs, and then sterilize citizens after procuring their potential offspring. They went through all that trouble but still not doing it. Afterwards the sperms and eggs will be analyzed if there are some decent possible DNAs in it. If so, it will be fertilized in futuristic tubes and the person will be taken care by the All-loving Mother State.</br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck.</br>  <br>so is she actually having sex here or is this some delusion?<br>I also don't get why we have male nipplies and no female nipples.</br></br>  <br>Yeah in the end everything comes to 1984 or brave new world territory.</br>  <br><br>checked archives<br><br>It's allegedly Annie Brown, not Smith</br></br></br></br>  <br>WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY CENSORING</br>    Funi is going to have a field day with censoring this ep.  <br>But that's your nose.</br>    Subs by HS should be out in 3 hours.   just watched the ep <br>BETTER THAN ADVERTISED FUCKDAMN</br>  <br>No she just got on top.</br>  <br>Holy shit.

But Anna still isn't a slut since she only after one guy.</br></br>    <br>I would let Anna rape me</br>    <br>I like Yuzuki N' but in this instance I much prefer the anime designs.</br>  <br>an example where censoring makes the scene even more erotic, thanks to our dirty imaginations</br>  <br>It has surpassed KissxSis level lewd</br>  <br>based JC Staff. Finally they can deliver something wonderful like this.</br>  <br>IT WAS A COCKBLOCK</br>  <br>JC Staff was just like Anna. They haven't animated anything this lewd in ages.</br>  <br>why is she crying on his feet?</br>  <br><br>We all know that the reason why author doesn't make her a slut who fucks random chads, is becauseof his reader's demographic.</br></br>  <br>Cant rape the willing</br>  <br>The last one I remember was Zero no Tsukaima, but it wasn't this lewd.</br>  <br>That's cookie juice.</br>  <br>Novel for comparison.</br>  <br><br>Yuzuki's art isn't great, techincially speaking and I think it varies in quality from work to work. But there's something I love about it anyway. <br><br>Overall the anime looks more polished and a bit better, but those designs are pretty much a direct copy of hers. Manga Kajo looks the best, I like her slightly smaller chest.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd never wash my feet anymore</br>  I have to wonder what the big bad politian's goal with all this is. I wonder if the author is just gonna pull something silly like he's just a gigantic pervert who wants to make everyone deprived of sex and then go full force and make everyone fuck each in the middle of the street, kinda like what just happened to Anna when she discovered lewd. <br><br>I mean, how else are you gonna explain this bullshit, the series is kinda of a gag series in a way too. Pretty sure he's not trying to make better birthrates wit the current laws.</br></br>  Adult Mirai rape never.  <br>Listen anon, when a woman loves a man very much, she secretes cookie juice from her mixing bowl. And it is absolutely normal. Anon, there will come a time where a woman who loves you very much will tie your hands behind your back and put her panties on your head. Don't be scared when that happens, it will be absolutely fine. Now, what you do with that cookie juice, you'll find out then.</br>  <br>m-maybe kyoani will find a way?</br>  <br>Just how would you know?

In this series the biggest prudes are the most sexually repressed and frustrated, while the perverts are contrarian neo-reactionaries and actually quite conservative.</br>  Apparently she's named Binkan-chan which translates to Sensible-Chan how cleverly remarkable from the authors.  <br>Remember what? I haven't been following these threads so I'm not 100% up to date on spoilers</br>  So many dicks around me...<br><br>I WANT THEM ALL</br></br>  This is more lew than i expected. I want more anna!    <br>I think that's kinda the joke, or how the characters work. Kajou comes off as a giant perv with all the sex jokes and such, but she's quite innocent overeall, while the giant sex offenders are the ones having their sexuality repressed. <br><br>Kinda like knowing a lot about sex, but when something lewd happens around you, you just turn bright red, at least for Kajou.</br></br></br>  <br> binkan <br>That word reminds me of a certain bludgeoning angel</br></br>  <br>You know there's a problem when the "sex terrorist" finds what the other is doing too be too lewd and blushes.</br>  <br>Thats the girl in the background. <br><br>Kek</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>Hotter than anything this season</br>  <br>so THAT's this girl?</br>  <br>She only wants one dick, all other dicks are irrelevant.

Kill yourself</br></br></br>    <br>who is this semen demon</br>     The main reason I dislike the Rebuilds is because they skipped this episode completely   <br>Perfect Blue</br>  The most well animated 6 seconds in all of ZZ Gundam    <br>Should have start with "Hard mode : no movies"</br>  ↑←↑      This<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=Ril<wbr>k4RvyIOk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  Oddly one of the most well animated bits in the show  <br>No you're wrong. Those were from the 2014 anime for Break Blade. They re-did a bunch of animation and added a bunch of new scenes in the TV show compared to the movies and fully animating Girge's last stand was one of the best additions. It was epic, still had that really bum ending though which was disappointing.</br>    Too many of my webms of good scenes have sound  Over 50% of the animated scenes in this thread are shitty mecha scenes, why is this allowed?  <br>Sorry man, that's what I've got in my folder<br>Be my guest if you want to dump other stuff</br></br>  <br>Did Umetsu animate this?</br>  <br>Because mecha and sci-fi anime not only looks better when animated well, but has a more exotic appeal over a simple well done SOL scene. I mean if I wanna go see a good image of some girl standing under a tree with flowers I can just go into a city park and sit around for a bit.</br>  <br>this is the cutest fucking thing holy shit.</br>    <br> He doesn't suck old men dicks </br>  <br>out of all the budget scenes in Naruto this is probably one of the worst. It's so choppy.</br>    <br>yeah it is</br>  Japan did a poll of their most popular web novels. <br><br>#1 - Mushoku Tensei<br>#2 - Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu<br>#3 - Sword Arts Online<br>#4 - Log Horizon<br><br>I don't recognize what #5 to #9 are. Anyone read moon?<br><br>#10 is Kenkyo, Kenjitsu o Motto ni Ikite Orimasu!.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I don't want Mushoku Tensei anime.  <br> #1 - Mushoku Tensei <br><br> A 34-year-old NEET gets killed in a traffic accident and finds himself in a world of magic. Rather than waking up as a full-grown mage, he gets reincarnated as a newborn baby, retaining the memories of his past life. Before he can even properly move his body, he resolves to never make the same mistakes he made in his first life ever again and instead live a life with no regrets with the new one that was given to him. Because he has the knowledge of a middle-aged man, by the age of two, he has already become a magical prodigy and possesses power unthinkable for anyone his age and even older. Thus begins the chronicles of Rudeus Greyrat, son of swordsman Paul and healer Zenith, as he enters a new world to become the strongest mage known to man, with powers rivaling even the gods themselves. </br></br></br>  Here's the rest of the list. Titles that I recognize include:<br><br>#14 - GATE<br>#18 - Danmachi<br>#19 - Overlord<br>#24 - Tensei Shitara Slime <br>#26 - Hero Union BBS<br>#28 - Yoko Senki, that story about loli nazis or something that no one ever translated into English.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Isn't Re:Zero that super nihilistic one that's getting an anime here the circulation dropped off by like 300% just from volume 1 to 5</br></br>  <br><br>That's my fan fiction I wrote that.</br></br>  <br>I thought danmachi was LN, fuck my ignorance then.</br>  <br><br>Re:Zero is the one about the Japanese boy transported into the fantasy world but instead of getting super OP abilities, the only special power he has is respawning from a checkpoint every time he dies. He proceeds then to die repeatedly trying to save this one girl.</br></br>  <br>Jesus Christ how self insert can you get.</br>  <br>As shit as the description makes it sound, it's actually pretty good.</br>  <br>It starts off as WN then getting LN like most things.</br>  <br>i've seen /a/ come up with better plots.</br>  <br>Honestly the description may sound shit, but the actual series is pretty good. I was turned off by the description but when I actually read the series it was actually not bad.</br>  <br>Many LN start as WN but then get republished. Every series there is more popular as an LN than a WN, the exceptions being maybe SAO and probably Mushoku Tensei.<br><br>Usually the LN is better than the WN because the writer can refine both the story and the writing itself, and because editors can help remove things that likely won't be popular. This helps trim excess that usually drags down most WNs and makes them boring and way too long. Shieldbro and Mushoku Tensei are both improved in LN over WN. I haven't read the WN of the others so I can't really compare them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Is shieldbro on the list at all?</br></br>  <br>the plot is shit, the execution isn't.<br>those are two different things</br></br>  <br>5. ARYUUJONISUTO?<br>6. Before infinity?<br>7. Babel?<br>8. Isaki's magic-something?<br>9. Unnamed Memory?<br>10. Something about living more?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope</br>  <br><br>Why does that sound familiar. Wasn't there a music video series that got turned into an anime that was about that</br></br>  <br> that 100 point difference between 1st and 2nd place <br>Jesus</br></br>  <br>5. Gensou Saiki no Illusionist<br>6. Sono Mugen no Saki e<br>8. Yuusha Isagi no Maoutan</br></br></br>  <br>Please don't try to translate ever again.</br>  <br>This was made for me</br>  <br> #1 - Mushoku Tensei <br><br><br>So A1 pictures, summer 2016?</br></br></br></br>  <br> 10. Something about living more? <br><br>It's Kenkyo, Kenjitsu o Motto ni Ikite Orimasu!. This one is pandering to girls. A japanese girl is reborn into a shoujo manga fantasy setting, and she recognizes the setting as that of a popular shoujo manga in her past life. She also realised she was reborn specifically as the rich girl antagonist character who meets a nasty end, and sets out to change the ending.</br></br></br>  Will a Mushoku Tensei anime ever likely to happen?  <br>After Re:Zero</br>  <br>http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/new<wbr>s/2015-07-19/re-life-in-a-different<wbr>-world-from-zero-light-novels-get-t<wbr>v-anime-adaptation/.90629<br>Mushoku greenlit any season now</br></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Keit-ai?</br>  Honestly I want a Shieldbro and Mushoku Tensei anime adaption.

Can you upload english story to syosetu ? Imagine if /a/ write something, then it get popular enough and get adaptation to other format.  <br>baka gaijin have their own place to upload, like fanfiction.net</br>  <br>Slime reincarnation and Knights Magic are on it, hopefully they get the anime treatment. Not sure if I want a Mushoku Tensei anime though.</br>  <br>Whats the deal with reincarnation?</br>  <br> 30. Isekai Rakugo <br><br>Is that just about a group of girls transported into a fantasy setting, and then performing rakugo?</br></br></br>  <br>But you can't get LN / manga / anime deal from those.</br>  <br>Fictionpress, ff is obviously for ff.</br>  <br>It's the current fad, previous decade was battle academy.</br>  <br>Mushoku Tensei apparently set the trend, and I guess Kenkyo set the subset of Otoge reincarnation..</br>  <br>Looks like MC is a boy</br>  <br>Oh hey freeloader is 35.</br>  <br><br>You know, I was so happy when I first heard about otoge reincarnation in Destruction Flag Otome. I was like: "Wow, what a fresh and interesting idea."<br><br>Then I found out that Kenkyo did it first, and there's like a half dozen otoge reincarnations stories now. Japan just rips off itself so much.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>What is this about? Is this about a guy transported into a fantasy world, gets a delicious brown waifu and then just mooches off her money?</br></br>  <br>It's not just Japan really, follow the leader is common everywhere.</br>  we need more isekai reincarnation anime  <br>Pretty much. He starts getting involved in politics later on since he's tasked to repopulate the royal line.</br>  Is Wordmaster on the list?  <br><br>Damn. He gets a harem of brown girls? I need to read this. Manga where?</br></br>  <br><br>Looks like it is. #43.</br></br>  <br><br>That girl better not be his childhood friend.</br></br>  <br>It's no, 43 I think.<br><br><br>No, he doesn't believe in polygamy.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>So he stays faithful to his waifu? Respect.</br></br>  How about Otoburi or Jashin Average? Either of them on the list?<br><br>I know Otoburi managed to get a LN.</br></br>  Anyone can translate / summarize that new yaraon article ? It's saying Overlord and Gate LN selling nicely after the anime ?  <br>Took 1 volume for him to get his wife pregnant too,  and MC wasn't a virgin before the events of the LN. </br>  <br><br>Nope. Sorry, what is this crazy, I can't self-insert into that.</br></br>  <br><br>Nope. It's an elf girl he meets on the streets. She saves him from some muggers, they go on a sort of date, and every time she and him both die at the end of the day. He basically groundhog days it trying to figure out a way to not die and save the girl.</br></br>  <br><br>Homura?</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>There's a manga. http://bato.to/comic/_/comics/rezer<wbr>o-kara-hajimeru-isekai-seikatsu-dai<wbr>sshou-outo-no-ichinichi-hen-r13364</wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Jashin Average is getting a LN too.</br>  <br>Well 1st chapter was funny, lets see how long till I drop this, thanks for the link.</br>  <br>That's SAO 3</br>  <br><br>What's that one about?</br></br>  <br> Many LN start as WN but then get republished <br><br>Not true at all. This is only a recent occurrence.<br><br>Most LNs start out as LNs and not web novels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>More accurately, many WN get republished as LN.</br></br>  <br><br><br>Can anyone tell me which of the novels on this list has english translations?</br></br></br>  <br>Girl gets transported to fantasy world after gaining the attention of a god for having evil looking eyes. Gets blessed to have the powers of an average evil god. Accidentally becomes a dungeon master, and accidentally inspires an evil cult.</br>  Would be nice to see scheming 10 year old animated. Or Grimgal:the trashmob hunters.  <br> Mushoku Tensei <br><br>So why MF still not announce anime of this yet, wait for 2016?</br></br></br>   Re:Monster nowhere in the list <br>Boy that shit sure got forgotten fairly quickly.</br>  <br>Re Monster was never really that popular in Japan in the first place.<br><br>Re Monster fags just have shit taste and think their shitty web novel is popular.</br></br></br>  <br>why even bother?</br>  <br>When is Anri-sama going to learn about the dick?</br>  <br>#1 - NEET sent into a fantasy world<br>#2 - student sent into a fantasy world<br>#3 - gamer sent into a MMO fantasy world<br>#4 - gamer sent into a MMO fantasy world</br></br></br></br>  <br>Is there any fucking LN which is not about a boy getting transported to some shitty other world, be it fantasy or game fantasy?</br>  <br>There are thousands of LNs out there that you will never know about, because the ESLs who circlejerk over them only care about getting sent to another world shit.</br>  <br>Fuck me, webnovels are still a thing ? Damn Japan get with the times.</br>  <br>Web is the future.</br>  <br>There's one where a girl reincarnated into a spider in a fantasy world.</br>  <br>There's dragon life where a girl got reincarnated as a maneating dragon, sadly it seems that the translation got dropped.</br>  <br>What? MT is the most popular right now? That's weird.</br>  <br> MT is popular now <br><br>Hey man, we were into MT before it was cool.</br></br></br>  <br>Japan has good taste, for this once though.</br>  <br>And all those Cthulu Average sidestories as well.</br>  <br><br>Fuck you, it isn't. When I fucking read it, it was retarded as fuck.The MC is the most annoying piece of shit ever. Fuck you /a/. I'm never going to read anything you recommend ever again.</br></br>  <br>Come back when you finish reading it and you have an actual opinion.</br>  <br>No fuck you. I still remember the summary of the WN that some anon post. It went to be even more shit with him somehow marrying be a piece of shit and somehow have a harem.</br>  <br> I still remember the summary of the WN that some anon post <br>In other words, you let others form opinions for you. What a tool.</br></br>  <br>It was a summary on what happen, not his thoughts about it. I still remember that he actually like that shit.</br>  <br>oh, so you just decided to not like something before you gave it a shot?</br>  <br>I already gave it a shot. It's shit. Based on the things I read he was already a piece of shit because he has his intelligence.</br>  <br>how far did you get anon</br>  <br><br>this.<br>in the beginning i was very annoyed at the setting as well, but they didn't really dwell on that. <br>it was very enjoyable in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Until he finish learning magic with the girl magician.</br>  <br>that's like judging a movie by it's preview man. Do me a favor and go read a couple of volumes.</br>  Is there an equivalent to web novels like these on the English web? I want to post mine where people can read it, but I'm not looking for money so I'm not interested in self publishing. Shit like FictionPress feels really amateurish.  <br>Nope. I didn't enjoy that and you think I'm going to enjoy it even after I hate it when reading the fucking summary.</br>  <br>I don't think there's a market for it here. So nobody has actually tried. Unless you want to count the HFY sites. <br><br><br>don't you know the phrase "don't judge a book by it's cover"? Plus this guy too </br></br></br></br>  <br>I hope LH will get a better studio after this.</br>  <br><br>holy shit I forgot about this, thanks for reminding me</br></br>  <br>I didn't judge a book by its cover. I judge it based on the summary of its contents. Unless the writing suddenly became spectacular after that and the MC suddenly change people, I know I'm not going to like it.</br>  <br>Read it you fuck</br>  <br>Is this the ultimate self insert story? This sounds even more laughable than SAO. No wonder Japan likes this schlock so much. Christ..</br>  POST BEST TENSEI FAGGOTS  <br> discriminating between the Goddesses <br><br>That's how wars start.</br></br></br>  <br>It is. MC is a NEET that dies after saving his family that discriminated him. He then got reincarnated to a good family with a knight dad and a magician mom. He learns magic easily alone. He calls his dad by his name because he likes his mom sexually. Genius at magic and almost everything. He then lived a happy life for some of his life. He dies but then got resserructed again.</br>  <br> Kenkyo <br>Author should stop finding real job and focus on trying to get her work printed.<br><br>Updates never ;_;</br></br></br></br>   No Tilea's worries on the list <br><br>O-oh ;_;<br><br>The jokes are getting tiresome at later chapters but Timu is still cute</br></br></br></br>  <br>I always wondered what happens to otaku NEETs when they grow up. Now I know that nothing does and they just keep making fanfiction with themslves as self inserts.</br>  <br><br>Don't believe these lies. It is not good. At all. It's not as fucking awful as the description might make it seem, but it's barely better. There are much better trash web novels to read that at least do something interesting with their self-insert power fantasies.</br></br>  in terms of self inserts or mary sues, mahouka is by far the worst i've ever read. absolutely nothing else comes even close.<br>most other LN/WN i read also had a little of that, or at the very least a sense of self righteousness. either that or the MC was seriously overpowered. that tended to grant them the initiative at all times.<br><br>but mushoku tensei balanced very pretty well, even within the story. he was a "genius" but that's only because of his head start as a reincarnated person. he was also diligent which made it more believable. also despite being a genius, there were always much stronger people around him. <br><br>i think it deserves the #1 spot. not because it's perfect or especially well written, but just because it avoided all of the stupid mistakes it could've made and stayed enjoyable until the end. <br><br>shieldbro on the other hand was a disappointment after reading MT.<br><br><br> There are much better trash web novels to read that at least do something interesting with their self-insert power fantasies. <br>there actually aren't. in terms of self insert aspect, most novels handle it worse compared to this one.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Royalroad, if I remember corectly.</br>  <br>Rudi was a good protagonist.<br> He actually was. </br></br>  <br>No, he isn't. Being a creepy NEET in a child body doesn't suddenly make him a good protagonist. It actually makes him more creepy as hell when he wants to fuck his mom.</br>  <br> implying you read the novel </br>  <br> implying it is a novel <br> implying it isn't shit <br> implying </br></br></br>  Is it true Norn got married to that green haired guy? If it is, I'm not going to continue reading this anymore. Fuck that shit. <br><br>I've read up until the part where he discovered the monkey guy is the apostle.</br></br>  <br>Yes, she craves the spear.</br>    <br>I had no idea Mushoku Tensei was this popular. I'm glad that it's getting recognized, I just wish haters read past the first two volumes.</br>  <br><br> Heroes union BBS  <br><br>The fucking greatest.<br><br>Eternal loli I want to be you</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> implying you've read a single one of those books. <br> muh murakami <br>it is a light novel. it's called light novel for a reason.<br><br>and yes, he is creepier in the beginning than in the end. <br> It actually makes him more creepy as hell when he wants to fuck his mom. <br>i don't remember that. at most there was some sexual harassment. and it's not like he could really recognize them as his parents until much later anyway.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yea yea but does he seriously just sit around telling lame jokes to ogres?</br></br>  <br>Fuck, I'm still vol 2 but I couldn't bear if the newborn imouto craves anyone else's dick.<br>Thanks for saving me the time.</br></br>  <br>the only reason i'm not reading this is because the heroine's tits are too big.</br>  <br>They exist, but rarely get popular. Aside from Worm, I can't think of a big name in the market.<br> really amateurish <br>Most of the ones on their own wordpress sites aren't AS bad, if you actually hear of them ever, but it's not like the Japanese ones are super professional either.</br></br></br>  <br>A light novel. Not a novel. You should kill yourself for even putting a LN in the same category as a Novel.<br><br>He is creepy. Fucking creepy. He is also badly written. If you need two volumes but no, it's not even just two volumes. You need to try to read the whole thing to actually care for him. No, a harem isn't going to make me like him. Not even being an influential person and strong alpha dog can save him. The WN is shit and people shouldn't even bother with the LN.</br></br></br>  <br>You sound really salty for some reason. Does he trigger you or something?</br>  <br>2 cour anime adaptation of the Juvenile Period by Silver Link, financed by NHK when?<br><br>2 cour Second Season of the Youth Period, Third Season of the Young Man Period when?</br></br></br>  <br>i'm not the guy who called it that though. but it should be obvious he was talking about the light novel. the difference is obvious. you are the only one having an autistic fit about this as if it wasn't obvious. again, it's called light for a reason,<br><br> The WN is shit and people shouldn't even bother with the LN. <br>that's backwards logic.<br><br> he is shit because i said so! <br> he is shit because he is a pervert! <br>just kill yourself already, normalfag</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   MT has been on /a/ for ages <br> "Hey guys, it's officially popular now!" <br> "Jesus, this shit is a horrible self-insert fic, it's really bad." <br><br>Sasuga /a/.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He is creepy. Like, really creepy. And that's why he's a bad character. That and the fact that I can't care about him.  <br><br>Maybe you should read the actual novel instead of lurking in the threads.</br></br></br>  <br> for ages <br> 2014 <br> it wasn't popular outside its thread at all <br> implying </br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't try and act as if that's new. It's been called that for a very long time.</br>  <br> Yeah, ever since. Too bad it's LN numbers are just decent. </br>  <br>I'm an idiot.</br>  <br>Still better than nisekoi.</br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Ayyy lmao<br><br>Why are you replying to this shitter? He's obviously baiting, and if not, he's probably jerking off to his twilight fanfics inside his filthy room.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He isn't just creepy. He is good at everything. And people seem to be okay with him being a total shit. Fuck that.</br>  <br>Don't bother with the guy. He's an idiot.</br>  <br>So, not liking your shitty self-insert LN makes them a shitposter. You sound like those SAOfags. Always with the it's going to get better bullshit.</br>  <br>Not that guy but if you post shit like "superior Japanese literature" and keep saying how he's creepy you're kind of a shitposter already.</br>  <br>With the current trend, we'll get 6 volumes adapted into 13 episodes. Kill me.</br>  honest question, how is the SAO LN?  <br>Those aren't all the same person, I am one of those posts. Mushoku Tensei is not very good, sorry people are shitting on your boring self-insert fantasy.</br>  <br>Good, definitely one of the most excellent writing of world building in the last 10 years.</br>  <br>Most people here don't lurk in your shitty threads.</br>  <br>thread going downhill already?</br>  <br>anon pls.</br>  <br>No, fuck you!<br><br>I'm always right and I will only listen to what I want.<br><br>Your opinions&lt;Mine<br><br>BTFO REKT TROLOLOL</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mushoku Tensei is not very good, sorry people are shitting on your boring self-insert fantasy. <br>you keep saying that. but people already pointed out that your reasons for believing that are retarded.<br>in short: you are retarded, anon.</br></br></br>  ITT: An anon who is in denial because he is too lazy and self-entitled to read  <br> most excellent writing of world building <br>compare SAO to One Piece in terms of world building, SAO is laughable.</br></br>  <br>The progressive was decent, well, SAO is always decent to begin with, it's ALO and GGO that's ultra shit.</br>  <br>Remember SAO. LNfags say that it's going to be good. Remember when it isn't. People already learned their lesson. Never trust you guys.</br>  So, is Mushoku Tensei good or shit?<br>What's the good part of it?<br>Because reincarnating stories is like everywhere nowadays, most of it were bad.</br></br>  <br>WOW</br>  <br>Maybe an adaptation of West Wind Brigade until we get more source material</br>  <br>Threads about LN often going downhill, because there are people that shitposting "All LNs ARE SHIT" just because LNs that they've ever know is just shitty harem or shitty self-insert fantasy eventhough there are lots of LNs that ever produced and lots of them are still untranslated or even on the web.<br> I'm not a LN reader, btw. Just a lurker. <br><br><br>Relax, idiot. It's a medium that is primarily aimed at young people, it's regrettable that it's not as great as these GREAT literatures<br><br><br>Goddamn, why in this thread there are smart people that like to show their superior taste in literature? It's fucking light novel, it's aimed at young people, like middle or high school students. It's not even comparable from the beginning to GREAT literatures like this</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No you fucking idiot. Not all LN are shit. Log Horizon for example is the only LN that's actually worth reading that's in the Top 5. Why can't jap have better taste.</br>  <br>So the key to be popular is to have ____ sent into a ____ fantasy world.</br>  <br>is log horizon written like Maoyuu? because that one was fairly dry.</br>  <br>For me LH was even better than Maoyuu. Don't know why but maybe because LH is set in a game gone real which gives it and even more interesting premise.</br>  <br>I said many, not most. There are lots of popular LNs that were WNs.<br><br>Reading comprehension, I am not stupid enough to think the majority of LNs were WNs.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't Japanese literature in general fairly dry?</br>  <br>quick come up with a LN plot to top these charts.</br>  <br>You also have to have a shitload of cute girls.</br>  <br>Just read it Anon. It's 24 volumes.</br>  <br> Not all LN are shit. <br>No shit, that's the point of my post, you idiot.<br>"Not [insert medium here] are shit" is valid for all things, anon.</br></br></br>  <br>Neet is sent into a video game fantasy world full of cute girls, he gets a harem.</br>  Daily reminder how germany raped OP names.<br><br> Affe D.

She is just too cute.</br>  Never change /a/.<br>Please.</br>  <br>http://myanimelist.net/character/70<wbr>715/Anzu_Futaba/</wbr></br>    So why hasn't this been applied to /a/ yet?  <br>We really need the mods to ban Madoka threads. I don't have anything against Madoka, and I posted in the threads for a while, but they're just a cesspool of tripfag circlejerking, rehashing the same stupid arguments, and posting of the same images every fucking thread.</br>  <br>Too bad they killed the text boards, that would have prevented much of the generals from forming.</br>  <br> People can talk about whatever anime/manga they like, and everyone else can decide if they want to read them or not. <br>Not Naruto though, that one is bad because of defunct websites like Gaia.</br></br>  <br>/a/ is much worse than /co/.</br>  <br>It has to Naruto, you fucking newfag.
