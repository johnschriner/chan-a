Or maybe she wouldn't have minded, too <br><br>Too bad 8man still had to step in.</br></br></br>  <br> wasn't even at genuine pt. 2 <br>She didn't need to be there because she is already genuine enough. 8man doesn't need to call her out like he did double YY.</br></br>  <br>Yui didn't pull anything but the last drop that made 8man say "fuck it".

Saki is pretty great  <br> Choosing the easy way out with a shallow relationship out of convinience <br>Literally the one thing he doesn't want.</br></br>  <br> iroha end <br> easy way out <br> friendship <br> shallow <br><br>You must be one of those fags that believe that double YY won't be hurt by not winning the 8bowl.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He likes Iroha romantically. Friendship with double YY can be genuine after he rejects them. Yukino goes off to college abroad and Yui goes somewhere else.</br>  <br> He likes Iroha romantically. <br>Woah there, enough with the falseflagging.</br></br>  <br>I have this weird feeling that either Yui or Yukino will get tremendously hurt if 8man doesn't choose them. Even if he rejects both I think he still might really hurt their feelings. Both Yui and Yukino are dependent on him to various degrees. A lot of what they think and their emotions are tied to him. <br><br>Yukino has a ton of issues and helping him find his genuine thing plus "saving" him is very important to her. Yukino doesn't really get close to people so since she managed to fall in love with someone it would really hurt her to have that relationship go up in smoke if he doesn't reciprocate her feelings. Also she wouldn't be chosen again, that won't feel good for her is all the relationships with guys in her life end up with the guy going with a different girl.<br><br>Yui has really poor self esteem and she is madly in love with him. She is so emotionally invested in her relationship with him, due to length and intensity, that it would be hard for her to recover from it. 8man rejecting her in favor of someone else would only exacerbate her issues and it would slowly kill her to see him with someone else. Even for someone who is well adjusted with no issues would be hurt in her situation.<br><br>Based off of that reasoning I have concluded that both girls would be really hurt if they got rejected or if they weren't chosen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You believe acting considerate towards them again when they aren't asking him to won't hurt them even more.<br><br>He already learned his lesson.</br></br></br>  <br>So what? He should go for the triangle route with YY2, when it's already been pointed a thousand times that their relationships have been superficial.<br>And the only thing he likes about them is Yukino's face and Yui's Yuis.</br></br>  <br> He likes Iroha romantically. <br>That might matter if the same couldn't be said for YY. Meanwhile he's actively pursuing a deeper relationship with them, but not with Iroha.</br></br>  <br>He doesn't have to pursue one because his relationship with Iroha is already deeper that with double YY</br>  <br>Right because treating her the same way he treats Komachi and her shoving a spoon in his mouth is so deep.</br>  <br>Or you could say his relationship with Iroha grows more naturally and doesn't have to be forced as fuck.</br>  <br>Let's say he picks Iroha.<br>Double YY is hurt and he knows it, he doesn't lie about it and that's it.<br>If they can't handle that then that's the end of the club, simple.<br>He won't act considerate regardless of his choice. There is no easy way out of his situation.<br><br> These fish captchas don't have Yukino's pic in them. Better call google requesting a fix. </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>8/8 you should take your comedy act on the road.</br>  <br> Right because treating her the same way he treats Komachi <br>EOP please.<br> spoon in his mouth is so deep. <br>Summerfag please.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Finally somebody with a brain.</br>  <br> There is no easy way out of his situation. <br>Not to chose one and ignore that they are in love with him after him telling them not to be disingenuous with them.</br></br>  These threads keep getting worse. I want to die.  <br> Le EOP meme <br> Doesn't post anything else </br></br>  <br>Check yourself, we already killed you and turned you into one of us.<br><br><br>Nigga that's fake as fuck, ignoring the issue is everything but genuine.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nigga that's fake as fuck, ignoring the issue is everything but genuine. <br>I was being cheeky because that is exactly what he is doing. Nothing happens until he acknowledges their feelings and actively think s about them consciously.</br></br>  <br> Next time Yukino teases 8man too much he should pin her down and platonically fuck her until she cums. That'll show her. <br> platonically fuck her until she cums <br> platonically <br>I don't think you know what that word means.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Well fuck me then.</br>  <br>He acknowledges Yui's feelings but after the "thank you" gift he's doubting himself wondering if those feelings are anything more.<br><br>He has no idea what Yukino feels for him.</br></br></br>  <br>You somehow reminded me of when the 2nd season started and we were all talking about superficiality.<br>I called out the service club for being superficial and everyone called me a faggot even the LN "primaries".</br></br>  <br> that's the meme, anon </br>  <br>Is it so wrong to love someone so platonically that you want to fuck them platonically?</br>  <br>Buy it, fagget!<br><br>Then you can punch it whenever you like.</br></br></br>  <br>They were reactionary idiots then. The whole point of the plot is that the service club is working to discard their superficial behavior. They aren't genuine yet but they will be by the end, basically.</br>  <br> fuck them platonically <br>How the hell would that even work?<br>Sex is inherently sexual.</br></br></br>  <br>Not if you do it platonically, while showing no emotion as you look platonically into her eyes and climax together in platonic bliss,  platonically. </br>  <br>people fuck prostitutes platonically all the time, when jacking it can't get them off.<br>Some people just can't get off because of something mentally that's not necesarrily sexual in nature.</br></br>  <br>Under normal circumstances she doesn't. But in narration media. Author/editor pulling an ass and says "fuck you! No one gets in muh OTP" Happens a lot.</br>  <br>So let me get this straight, he wants them to be genuine with their feelings while he doesn't know what is really bothering them? He doesn't see himself as the root cause of it? If he made a choice or stopped leading them on this wouldn't even be and issue.</br>  <br> He likes Iroha romantically <br>[citation needed]<br><br>Vol 11 ch 1 8man outright stated that Iroha flew under his radar.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He doesn't know what the cause of the problem is, he thought they were talking about Yukino's family problem, Yui was being extremely vague about the problem she would be solving.<br><br>He seems somewhat hopeful that Yui's feelings are real while he views Yukino as someone above him thinking someone like her wouldn't even be interested in him.</br></br></br>  <br>Is this just a reworded version of that 'missionary position for the soul purpose of procreation' meme?</br>  <br> He has no idea what Yukino feels for him. <br><br>He knows. Haruno knows.<br><br> “That’s right. That isn’t anything remotely like trust… It’s something much more horrible.” She smiled, only her lips appearing tender. But the quality of her cold voice made her appear as someone else entirely from earlier. “Nothing’s changed and that child thinks that’s fine. I mean, sure, that part is also what makes her adorable, but… I really don’t like that.” <br><br>Except you believed that Yukino was incestuous bi-sexual to Haruno and/or Hayama.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yukino's issues and whatever pursue of romance she's going for are two different things.<br>Hachiman already took one step towards ending her dependency of him by refusing to help her.<br><br>The problem with Haruno's vision is she's only seeing that one side of Yukino, for one she misunderstood the reason why she asked about Hayama's future and didn't let her get another word in.</br></br></br></br>  <br> He doesn't know what the cause of the problem is <br>It is going to fuck with him hard once he realizes and fully acknowledges he is at the center of a love triangle. It will kill him to think he will have to choose one over the other. 8man can't reject anyone at this point, his last hurdle will be to have the balls to reject one of them directly.</br></br>  <br> He seems somewhat hopeful that Yui's feelings are real while he views Yukino as someone above him thinking someone like her wouldn't even be interested in him. <br><br>I'd say he's aware of Yukino's feelings at this point too, it's just that thanks to Haruno he's worried about where they might be coming from. Most of his "she's probably not interested in me" is still directed at Yui I think, even though he is making major progress on that front.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Sensei's talk about how it's okay to hurt someone that's close to you and him witnessing Hayato rejecting Iroha first hand served to prepare Hachiman to reject at least one girl by the end of the show.</br>  <br>Posting best doujin</br>  <br> by refusing to help her <br>When did that happen? Volume 11 ended with her request. We won't get 8man's response until vol12.</br></br>  <br>Why is this guy NTRing Zaimokuza?</br>  <br>everytime</br>  <br>Now that's alpha.</br>  <br>Whynotboth.jpeg<br><br>Hayama was wrong about YY2 being better than Orimoto.<br>Orimoto should take the transfer exam to Soubu and show them why 8man fell in love with her.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Big breasts on Iroha <br>Compensating much?</br></br>  <br>I don't know man, Zai deserves better than to be the victim in some faggot's NTR doujin.</br>  <br>He doesn't have to reject anyone though. All he has to do is accept Iroha. There will be on one rejected that way and the girls won't be hurt as a result.</br>  <br>Just like Iroha herself, that artist knows deep down who best girl really is.</br>  <br>That's because it's actually Yui without her hair dye and color contacts.</br>  <br> There will be on one rejected that way. <br>Not chosen=Rejected.<br><br>It doesn't matter who he picks, these things aren't painless, he could choose Saki or Orimoto and it would still be painful albeit a lot more since it just shows to them that what they thought was wrong from the beginning.</br></br></br></br>  <br> want a Yahallo/Senpai~ end <br> Yukinofags hate me for leaving her out  <br> Yuifags only want 3P with Yukino <br> Irohafags don't want to share <br>Am I the only one of this Island?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I agree and so does the mangaka.</br>  <br>You are not alone. Just imagine the sex, Iroha helping Yui to do paizuris</br>  <br>No, rejected is a straight up rejection. Neither Yui or Yukino will be rejected if he goes with another girl. They would be fine with it because it won't blow up their friendship so it wouldn't hurt to see him with another girl that makes him happy and became his genuine thing.</br>  <br><br>here's how this scenario plays out. pic related</br></br>    <br>I want Yaharifags to leave</br>  <br>Then what makes Iroha so special? According to your logic he can choose either YY and the other YY wouldn't be hurt.</br>  <br>Why is she mad? He had no control over that whatsoever. If anything she should be incredibly embarrassed and apologizing to 8man for her sister's actions.</br>  <br>Stop biting.</br>  <br>She's mad at Kaika for stealing her man</br>  <br>I'll bite anything m8, at this point there's no discussion. We're stuck in an eternal limbo of shitposting until Spyro translates, then a slightly shittier storm of shitposting will arrive.</br>  How can he unlock the Miura end?  <br>He has stronger feelings for Iroha than Saki, Orimoto etc.<br><br> According to your logic he can choose either YY and the other YY wouldn't be hurt. <br>No, it would hurt their friendship and make one of them feel like an outsider. I actually don't think loser YY would be all that bothered by not being chosen. Yukino is a strong girl and Yui is a nice girl./ <br><br><br>He is angry at him for not being able to handle that and ended up kissing her little sister. She doesn't want guys kissing Keika and she doesn't want 8man kissing other girls/</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is she raping him?</br>  <br>Using voodoo magic to pop up into her thoughts when she schlicks.<br>Or he can compliment her on her legs.</br></br>  <br>Hey wait a minute, you're not me. </br>  <br>Who said you were the only Miurafag?<br> Huh, didn't know archives lasted that long. </br></br>  <br><br>Fapman becomes the MC of yahari. there</br></br>  <br>Is it weird that I want to see Hayama imagine break 8man's shit to finally get his head out of his ass about the girls?</br>    <br> How dare you get attacked and not instantly think to protect yourself from being kissed! <br> Yes, that would imply you would have had to think about kissing her to prevent it. <br> If in such a case you did predict it, then I would still be angry at you for thinking about such a thing. <br> But wait a minute, that would mean that I would have been angry regardless of what you would have done. <br> If I'm angry regardless of what you did then that means my anger must be misplaced. <br> Perhaps I'm not actually angry at you, but at Keika. <br> Sorry for the misunderstanding Hachiman, please forgive my sister's actions and my unwarranted aggression. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No. I will remind you.</br>  <br><br>didn't mean to quote, just wanted to show what OTP was</br></br>  <br>Try prove it anon</br>  Why was she so flustered in this scene? She was acting like a schoolgirl in front of her crush  Mods please set me free.  If 8man didn't want a romcom to appear then why didn't he prevent Yukino from falling in love with him and have Yui fall out of love with him?  <br>Wait a minute, you're not me. <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127875414 </br>  I love Oregairu, 8man is so cool. He's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. 8man is a true hero, who sees through society's lies. I love watching Oregairu because I find 8man relatable. I also hate nice girls, and I hate all these superficial teenagers who surround me. Who /8maninhighschool/ here?  I've only watched the S1. Does the cake have any possibilities or should I drop this instead?  <br>It's canon that if 8man fails to date any of the girls, sensei will marry him.</br>  <br>You were MIA for too long</br>  <br>2nd to last episode of season 2 she says she can't watch over him forever.<br>I teared up a little.<br>But she still has a small chance, she can still watch over him if they get married.</br></br></br>  <br>Enough the show is over, move on already</br>  Why did it bother Yukino so much when Yui gave 8man her cookies? They were thank you cookies.  <br>I've been in every thread though.<br><br>Also here, have a gif of Hayama and Yumiko without their hair dye making out behind a witch hat.<br> I might as well embrace this meme at this point. <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=CQ8<wbr>HNDM-jsI</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br></br></br>  There are retards in this thread who actually thought Iroha brought 8man on the date in 10.5 specifically to have a date with him, and not to help get ideas for her newspaper, save money, and have a partner in crime she could blackmail later.  <br>I wish sensei would marry me instead.</br>  <br> Yumiko <br> implying it's not Iroha disguised as Yumiko disguised as Yukino </br></br>  <br>foreshadowing</br>    Whose grave are they standing over?  <br>Haruno, she shot herself after  failing to lead the superior Aryan race to victory </br>  <br>At least it won't be a loveless marriage anymore.</br>  <br> Their own, because they could only be together as ghosts after Yui killed them. </br>  <br>That makes no sense. Why would her parents put her grave next to a poor persons grave?</br>  <br> when she goes into yandere mode she still loses to Yukino <br>even in fanfiction Yui can't win</br></br>  I love Oregairu, Haruno is so cool. She's the hero we deserve, but not the one we need right now. Haruno is literally Hitler, and did nothing wrong. I love watching Oregairu because I find Haruno relatable. I also failed to get into art school, and I hate all these inferior non-Aryan pigs surrounding me. Who /literallyhitler/ here?  <br>Yui buried them alive</br>  <br> Together forever. </br>  What would 8man look like with normal eyes?  <br>Yui vision: Activated</br>  <br>The closest we got to something like that was when 8man tried out the glasses but they cut that from the anime.<br><br>Apparently he's actually attractive once the dead fish eyes are gone.</br></br></br>  <br>8.8/10 turns into 10/10<br>then all the assertive girls will get 8man and his old harem will be forgotten</br></br>  <br>Nah, she sees his bad eyes, but he probably looks more like this to her.</br>  Not a ship, but that's okay. I just want more Meguri-senpai.  <br> once the dead fish eyes are gone. <br>Then what is Yukino supposed to schlick to?<br><br><br>I wonder if Yui really has Yui vision, like him being attractive and him being a super good person no matter what he does.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's how I figure Yukino sees him.</br>  <br>The fish eyes are her biggest attraction to him.</br>  <br>Shit nigga, reason she fell for him was how nice he actually is underneath the unsociable loner image.<br><br>Dog incident was just the spark. Remember "Hikki did his best!"</br></br></br>  <br>FUCK YUI!</br>  <br>That, and Yui nearly wetted herself when Hikki tried [and failed] to stop the "bullying" Yumiko was doing to her.</br>  When will 8man kill Yukino's cunt?  How different would things be if Saki overheard genuine?<br><br>You think she'd be more proactive in the race for the 8?</br></br>  <br> Cake winning <br> Ever </br></br>  <br>If only he were born ten years earlier.<br><br>Hiratsuka's life is so unfair.</br></br></br>  <br>I meant could 8man do something awful (I don't mean social suicide) to achieve something and she would still see it as him being a good person.<br><br><br>I don't think it would wreck her panties like it did Yukino. It didn't even wreck Yui's and Iroha's.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When she lets him. She should have let him in this scene.</br>  <br> a super good person no matter what he does. <br><br>She definitely doesn't see that. Maybe a good person overall, in spite of what he does. "that guilt won't go away" is a perfect example of it; she recognizes when he's done wrong</br></br></br>  <br> How different would things be if Saki overheard genuine? <br> You think she'd be more proactive in the race for the 8? <br>She'd probably think or say something like "That's stupid, what could be more genuine than your family?"</br></br></br>  <br>Fair question.<br><br>I figure she'll try to understand why or desperately keep the image she has of him.</br></br></br>  <br>Jelly Yui and Yukino</br>  Ok, I've been out from yahari threads for a while.<br><br>Has Iroha already won?</br></br>  <br>I thought she only said that because she knows what he did would hurt him in the end, not because she thought what he did was a bad thing.</br>  <br>Need more filters</br>  <br><br>Yup  Tobe has been really kind to her. </br></br>  When will it happen?<br>What will be going on her mind?<br>What will be going on his mind?</br></br>  <br>This isn't tagged with Kawasaki on Pixiv.</br>  <br>she'd have to have a piss-poor understanding of what guilt is, and "dumb genki" tropes aside, I doubt that's the case. She knew it was wrong, but she also knew that was probably the only thing they could do.</br>  <br>You just reminded me of Goth.<br><br> Yui: Hikki-kun, if you promise to reject Yukino and marry me I'll let you out. <br> 8man: Please let me go, I'll reject her. <br> Yui: I'm sorry, but I can't trust you so easily. I'm going to have to bring Yukino here so that you can break up with her and I'll make sure she'll accept it. <br>next day<br> Yui: Hikki~ I brought Yukinon. She's buried right next to you. I think she can you from there. We'll just have to wait for her to wake up first. <br> Yui: C'mon say something. Hikki why so mad? :( <br> Yukino:Yui is that you? What's going on? <br> Yui: Yahallo, Yukinon. I brought you here because Hikki-kun has something important to say to you, but he's not being very talkative right now. I left you some snacks. I'll see you tommorow. <br>next day.<br> Yui: Yahallo. <br> Yukino: Please let me out! <br> Yui: Did you guys have a nice chat while I was gone? <br> Yukino: Is Hikigaya here too? HIKIGAYA HELP ME! GET ME OUT OF HERE! <br> Yui: Tsk! Hikki-kun you need to take responsibility soon. I can't keep buying all of this for you guys. (drops snacks down the large bamboo chutes) <br>next day<br> Yui: Oh man you're really starting to smell bad Hikki. I guess I should have brought you guys some toilet paper and ziploc bags. <br> Yukino: HIKIGAYA PLEASE SAY SOMETHING! <br>next week<br> Yui: I'm all out of my allowance and money from my part-time job. So you better say something now Hikki. <br> Yukino:He told me what he needed to say already. So please let me out. <br> Yui: So did you accept it? <br> Yukino:YES! <br> Yui: Do you promise we'll always be friends? <br> Yukino: Yes. I promise you, hikigaya and I will always be friends. <br> Yui: What...? You liar. Hikki didn't talk to you. He was suppose to tell you that we were going out. Since you accept that you'll never be with him I'll only leave you buried. <br>Yui opens the box and finds bags and bags of unopened snacks. 8man had stabbed himself in the jugular over week ago.<br> Yui Sobbing: You baka. I spent the last of my money to buy you a can of Max Coffee™ </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She probably wouldn't understand why 8man was holding back from being genuine in the first place and make him realize he's being rather selfish and stupid.</br>  <br>I thought she was referring to her own guilt that isn't going away. She is still hung up on the dog thing.</br>  <br>Isn't that only if he doesn't change?</br>  <br><br>Then why did she comfort him then? If he did wrong she should reject him, not affectionately fondle his hair and tell him sweet words.</br></br>  <br>Yui places the can into his open grave and walks away.<br> Yukino: PLEASE DON'T GO. DON'T LEAVE ME LIKE THIS. Give me his pen so I can atleast end my life like he did his. <br>Yui gathered up all the kindness in her heart to turn around, pull the pen out of his neck and drop it into Yukino's box. A moment later she hears gasp and gurgle from Yukino's box.<br>She looks back at Hikki's grave one last time, but it's empty except for an open can of Max Coffee™. <br>Thwack! Her body falls into his grave. The lid is slammed shut and dirt gets slowly piled on.<br> 8man: Max Coffee™ really makes you feel alive. <br> This has been a paid commerical by Georgia Coffee. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Whenever Yukino is afraid she instinctively clings to Hachiman like in the trolley, when walking through the dogs, Sable running towards them, the drop in Destinyland.<br><br>What if the next time she gets scared she  holds his hand. </br></br>  <br>Expect 2 paragraph of adjectives</br>  <br> They walk after laying flowers on Yui's grave. <br> Sable gets hit by a car while searching for his master. <br>THE END.<br><br> Tobe gets hit by a truck and no one notices. <br><br>This time, it's really the end!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why didn't 8man just tell Yui straight up that he wasn't that into her instead of leading her on for months on end? If he told her that much earlier he wouldn't have broken her heart.  <br> Tobe gets hit by a truck and no one notices. <br>I've read this before, where did you steal this?</br></br>  Is the novel still sad?  <br>both YYs afraid of Meguri. Good thing she's too busy studying for exams than playing with 8man.</br>  <br> She wanted to keep visiting them as an alumni <br>She wants the 8inch.</br></br>  <br>The logical conclusion of anime's slow progression towards pure advertisement</br>  <br>"Yukinoshita, let's go that way"<br>"Yukinos--??"

Just like the Sun in Spring that melts the snow that Winter left.<br> There's one thing troubling my mind however, why was she watching me? I've always known that she was unique in her own way  <br><br>but I didn't expect her to say something as bizarre as this.<br> "T-that so..." <br> I blurted out a poorly contrived retort to hide my bewilderment. <br> "Hikigaya-kun, I know that most people would think that you're not capable of being loved and even you might know that  <br><br>yourself"<br> With a sharp tone, Yukinoshita had lambasted me the way she used to the first time we met, with an insult that digressed  <br><br>further than my current thoughts. Then she paused and showed the smile that she had worn before.<br> "...but I'm here to change that" <br> So that's what she meant. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Hikki loves Yui  <br>Are you implying you don't like Pizzabutt?<br><br>I'd love to see a list of all the product placements in Anime especially the big brand names.<br><br>I just need to find inspiration to write an Ilohas/Irohas one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui is going to win.

No girl loves Hikki more than her, she would accept him no matter what.</br>  <br>Is someone other than Spyro translated this now?</br>  <br>Outside of Yui no girl (besides Komachi-chan) loves Hikki.

Well its more likely Yukino rejects him or falls out of the 8manbowl or something</br>  <br>Yui is a good girl. I am glad it wouldn't hurt her to see Hikki with a girl who isn't her making him happy.</br>  <br>Now I feel like rereading the LN's so I can pinpoint all the times people have helped 8man and had considerations about his feelings whereas Yui was selfish and jealous.<br><br>IE Haruno teasing 8man with her tits and he's enjoying it and she's enjoying his reaction/pretending not to like it. Yui butts in and tells her to stop.</br></br></br>  After the camping trip why did Komachi invite Yukino to go shopping with her and 8man but not Yui?  <br>Date, third time's the charm</br>  8man should just take Yui and Yukino on seperate dates, tests the waters, and decide which girl he harbors stronger feelings for. <br><br>Which girl can make his heart doki doki the most? Or make him feel jealous at the thought of other guys making a move on Yukino/Yui</br></br>  <br> Or make him feel jealous at the thought of other guys making a move on Yukino/Yui <br>This only works with Yui because she turns them down in an extremely roundabout way, Yukino shuts down anyone in a very coldly and straightforward.</br></br>  <br>He should bang them too. You can't tell how you really feel about a girl until you have sex with her.<br><br>Also her should keep this a secret between them.</br></br></br>  <br>I think in the LN they mention Yukino will be going in the same direction as them and Yui will be going in the opposite direction.<br>Also Yukino has money to help pay for groceries.</br></br>  <br>Go ahead and try.<br>I'd like to see whatever bullshit you can come up with.<br><br>BTW that's a really stupid example.<br> Other girl was sexual assaulting 8man <br> Yui told her to stop <br> Somehow it means that she doesn't care about 8man. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What else could it mean? Why would it bother Yui if other women are being flirty with 8man?</br>  <br>Here you go.</br>  <br>It bothers both her and Yukino, go back and read or see Megurin's debut.</br>  <br>She'd get the Yui treatment.</br>  <br>Yukino is selfish and uncaring about 8man too.</br>  <br> Is this Hayato's fetish? </br>  <br> Yukino is selfish and uncaring about 8man too. <br> What is volume 10.5 </br></br>  <br>Selfish and uncaring about 8man.</br>  <br>Thank you</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure Hayato was there</br>  <br>She did it all for him.<br><br>Yui:"I don't like seeing you in pain, but what can I do?"<br>Yukino:"Stop hurting yourself or gtfo"</br></br></br></br>  <br> I stared at the ceiling peacefully and Yukinoshita entered my field of vision. As she looked down at me, her face looked somehow anxious. <br> “…Here, take this.” <br> As Yukinoshita spoke, she quietly set something wrapped in a handkerchief near my chest. <br> I lifted my face and took the wrapped object from her; it was slightly warm. The handkerchief was decorated with an adorable design of cat paws. After unwrapping it, what came out was a can of MAX COFFEE. It looked like she tried her best at keeping it warm. <br> Seeing that brought a smile to my face. <br> “Take a breather. You’re not going to get anything done if you’re staring at the screen the entire time. It’d be better if you take a short break,” Yukinoshita said, abruptly looking away. She went back to her seat and resumed her work. <br><br> Selfish and uncaring about 8man. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You seriously need to reread the LN if you really believe that Yui doesn't have any considerations about 8man feeling.<br><br>She is the most considerate girl in the whole cast, <br>to the point that she forgives anything that 8man did to her despite herself getting hurt by it.

I was thinking how I’d like to poke those cheeks of hers, but there was no way I could do that and I shrugged my shoulders instead.  <br><br>How do you think she would have reacted if 8man had poked her cheeks? <br>Would 8man still be a virgin?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope, she would have raped him then and there in front of Orimoto and Chika.</br>  <br> How do you think she would have reacted <br><br>she would fk him up</br></br></br>  <br><br>this would be her vn route but sadly keika isn't included somehow. the romcom would be taishi and keika asked 8man stuffs.8man could easily handle keika fine due to having little sister while having no clue how to appease taishi's curiosity</br></br>  <br> Poking her cheek <br>She'll force him to take responsibility for his actions.</br></br>  <br>In a good or bad way?</br>  <br><br>she would hold onto him and snap a picture of them close together. use it to work Yukino up next time they meet.<br><br>can you say 8man in deep shit?</br></br></br></br>  What would Yui do if 8man genuinely confessed to her and she believed he truly loved her?<br><br><br> can you say 8man in deep shit? <br>Yukino isn't the jealous type, not would it bother her if she saw her love with her sister being friendly. God help us all if Yui sees it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Mouth kiss him in front of Hayama, earning his eternal rage, and entertaining Orimoto to no end. If it got out that 8man kissed Haruno you best believe double YY wouldn't let him be by himself with her. <br><br>You think double YY are hands off because they are afraid of being hands on or do they just think there is no way a girl will fall for him?</br></br></br>  <br> Yukino isn't the jealous type <br>Yukino is a pretty jealous girl and she knows what to do when she is, Yui has no idea how to react to such a thing.</br></br>  <br>wow, so platonic.</br>  <br><br><br> The gardens were green and full of flowers. There were stone steps and bamboo walls that resembled the gardens in the old capital like some forgotten temple for blown off course onto Chiba. <br><br> Yukinoshita Haruno led the way. <br><br> It was only now, following her brisk short steps, that I noticed what she was wearing. Elegant and colorful, with a cool blue kimono that appeared a softer shade in the moonlight. Her hair was bound up, and being behind her I was given an exquisite view of her pale nape. <br><br> For a while, we said nothing. Then we turned a corner. <br><br> In an instant, she pulled me close, the distance between our lips were nearly zero. <br><br> I'll admit, for a moment my heart fluttered. <br><br> "You know Hikigaya-kun… when a girl asks a man to be alone with him… there are always other motives." Her breath was sweet. Her skin was smooth, and without pores. It looked ethereal in the pale moonlight. <br><br> I gulped. <br><br> Her hand was pressed against my chest. The scent of her air was causing my mind to wander. <br><br> Flash. <br><br> Huh? What? <br><br> "Oh wow! This is a great picture!" Haruno-san giggled to herself. In her free hand, she held her phone that now possessed a picture of myself and her. If anyone else saw it without the proper context they'd definitely get the wrong idea. <br><br> "H-hey now…" <br><br> "Wow! This is going to go on my Twitter…" <br><br> "That's a bit much… no…" I tried reaching for her phone. I just wanted to hold onto it long enough to delete it. <br><br> "There, there, don't be such a prude," Haruno-san smiled. "Aren't men supposed to be happy they are taking pictures with lovely women? Or perhaps you aren't into women…? Or maybe you think I'm an old onee-chan that's too withered for you, eh? Eh?" <br><br>Continued.......</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That was a throw away, Yukino hasn't been known to be jealous otherwise. I am sure she would be fine with 8man fawning all over Haruno or any other girl.</br>  <br><br> The self-deprecating humor suited her as the flower patterns on her bosom blossomed with each jest. It appeared that Haruno-san was a master of masks, able to take any form she so desired or needed. The garden was her natural habitat, full of tall grass and plants, that hides the viper that is her beneath. <br><br> "I just think people might get the wrong idea here…" I said looking around, worried I was getting caught up in her rhythm. If things continued at this pace, I think the situation could become irreversible. <br><br> The woman didn't pay attention to me as she fiddled with her phone. <br><br> "Voila! Uploaded! I'm going to be Twitter famous," Haruno-san giggled to herself. "Aren't you excited Hikigaya-kun? You'll be known as the latest and only in my list of lovers…" <br><br> "Latest… wait, only? Does that mean you've never-?" <br><br> A finger silenced my lips. <br><br> "Feel special now, don't you?" She tucked the phone away into her carry-on bag and walked away to the beat of her own drum. She was happy. <br><br>Something like this could happen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay then.</br></br>  <br>This is the only answer.</br>  <br>If Haruno and 8man hooked up Yukino will be finally pleased with Haruno having something better to do and Haruno having something nice. If it happens that way Yukino doesn't even have answer 8man's request or be his genuine, Yukino doesn't have to be part of 8man's genuine at all. Yukino would like that.</br>  Can't wait for volume 12 when  Yumiko  got rejected.<br><br>I wonder how  8man and Iroha would act, seeing they were watching over her through the course of volume 10 and 11.  </br></br>  <br>She won't get rejected because she won't confess, she knows that it's out of the question, that's why she decided to follow him instead.</br>  <br> they both decide to comfort her <br> this and that <br> XXX <br> My 3P ending is wrong as expected </br></br></br></br>  <br>That would make me actually want to kill the fucking cunt.</br>  <br>As comparison<br><br> “Say you, if you’re going out with Yui, then you should understand what the deal is with Ebina, right?” <br><br> “T-T-There’s no way we’re going out or anything…” <br><br> Being suddenly told information about my own well-being that I didn’t know, I hurriedly retorted in response. Oh gosh, what’s with this girl? What’s she saying out of the blue? I-It’s not l-like I’m going out with that girl or anything at all! <br><br> As the gross feeling of droplets of sweat trickled down my body, Miura looked at me and mocked me from the depths of her heart with a laugh. <br><br> “What exactly are you misunderstanding here? Gross. Like Yui and Hikio could be going out. That’s not the issue, you know? I’m talking about Yui once you actually talk to her. Gross.” </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So this is the big question, between Yui and Yukino who would take the rejection and not being the chosen one the worse? I think it would be Yui, she is heavily invested in her relationship with Hikki. Yukino would be fine.  <br>But she will confess. But I guess you are an EOP and didn't read volume 11 (at least up to Iroha giving 8man giri-choco scene). It was made obvious that Miura is going to confess sooner or later.</br>  <br>The cunt is the king of suffering, haven't you already known it already?<br><br> The only way to resolve his (and Haruno too) issues is to fix Yukino's dependency issue. Only after he get rejected by Yukino (after cured) this time he can finally accept love. </br></br></br>  <br>Kirito</br>  What happened here, /a/ ?  <br>I'm not EOP  I just can't read moon. </br>  Dumping manga irohasu  <br><br><br>I like how you think anon.</br></br></br>  <br>I am ESL and I can still read moon. What's your excuse now?</br>      today i come to sadly accept that i am an Yui fag<br>she is not the best girl, but i desperately need 8man to love her, to hug her and tell her everything is gonna be alright.</br>     Yukinoshita Yukino <br><br> Likes: Pan-san, cats <br><br> Turnoffs: Boys with dead fish eyes, boys who like sweet things, boys that want something genuine </br></br></br></br>  <br> What would Yui do if 8man genuinely confessed to her and she believed he truly loved her? <br><br>Obvious outcome would be a happy development if they both accept each other's feelings. Yukino's matter would heavily sway this, depending on whether the confession happens before or after her request is solved. <br><br> Yukino isn't the jealous type <br><br>she is, if not unconsciously so. Meguri being friendly in the club, isshiki's birthday etc.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She'd playfully bite his finger.<br>"You need to be gentle with girls. Like this."<br>She'd grab his hold his hand in place and caress it with her face.<br>"But I'm a big girl, so I don't mind if you get a little rough with me."<br><br>Haruno decides to stay and eat there with 8man. He tells her he only came to study and have some Max Coffee™. They decide to share a sammie and cake. <br><br>Then the rest of the night would be 8man being deredere with Haruno. Holding hands and playing footsies under the table while Haruno talks to Orimoto's friend about Hayama.<br><br>Orimoto bursts into laughter "Hey Hikigaya you're having dinner with three cute girls. If people from junior high heard about this, they'd freak out. Dayone~."<br><br>"Heh, I bet."<br><br>"Dahling, Ahh~&lt;3." Haruno cuts off a piece of cake and presents it to 8man, but he's a bit embarrassed. <br>She ends up getting frosting on his cheeks and he doesn't hesitate to stick a finger into the cake and dab her on the nose.<br><br>Orimoto gets his attention and leans in real close to whisper to him, "Y'know, I'd never really think I'd see you having so much fun. When you smile like, you don't look half-bad, almost boyfriend material. It's hard to believe she's not your girlfriend. Too bad, dayone.<br><br>8man pulls away and tries to hide his smile.<br><br>Haruno grabs his head and licks off the frosting. "What were you talking about?"<br><br>"Nothing really, you still have some frosting on your nose." With Haruno still holding his face lose to hers he barely mangaes to reach the tip of her nose with his tongue.<br>"We were just talking about how you're not my girlfriend. Because you're my Fiancée." <br><br>Orimoto can't help but blush at all the lewdness that had unfolded in front of her"D-Dayone~"</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>"Hmm you say that but you still haven't gotten me a ring yet. See." She playfully shoves her hand into his face, emphasizing her ring finger.<br><br>8man bit down on it hard enough to leave some marks "There you go, now I just need to meet your parents and wait until I turn 18."<br><br>"I don't like boys who don't keep their word." She goes in for a kiss. He doesn't resist, in fact he doesn't let her go."I think we should go somewhere else now."<br><br>"T-T-Time out. I know you two are still in love, but Hikigaya is still underage and I don't think he has enough experience. So you should really think about safety first. DAYONE!"<br><br>"Then you can come along with us to make sure we're being safe. Dayone~&lt;3. You don't mind since you used to like her. Ne~.<br><br>"I guess I don't."<br><br>"Orimoto's friend, you can come too to make sure Orimoto is being safe."<br><br>"What about Hayama-kun..." Her friend tags along sulkily.<br><br>After paying for their bills, they make their way to a love hotel. 8man stops at the vending machines in the lobby while Haruno fills out the paperwork. They get to the room.<br><br>"Did you get enough condoms? What's that in the other bag."<br><br>"We're going to need this, if we're planning to spend the whole night. Max Coffee™ it gives you the energy you need. And these are new Georgia brand condoms in various flavors."<br><br> Share a Max Coffee™, it really brings people closer together.<br>This has been a paid lblaiaoihabn;awe.</br> <br>Goddamn I type too slow. Someone else beat me to the punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>so isshiki is a weasel, certainly resembles that in the art of the girls with kemonomimi.</br>  <br>The time when Iroha was still a cute little kouhai.<br><br> Yet 8man at a first glance instantly knew that she was dangerous. Guess this is another series of "How I met your mother" </br></br></br>  <br>What are her turnons?</br>  <br>1/2</br>  <br>But that means she'll never get to see her kids graduate highschool/college and get married.  ;_; </br>  <br>2/2<br><br>"That's the way, son, How I Met Your Mother."</br></br></br>  <br>She doesn't have an on switch.</br>  <br>She was pretty damn scary.</br>  <br>son: What, so cliched like that? And you dare say your romcom was wrong as you expected?<br><br>father:  But son, she is not really your mother. </br></br></br>  <br>Yes,  Haruno's shadow copy  was pretty scary. I have to agree on that.</br>  <br>Besides the simple grammar mistakes, this is pretty good.<br><br>This one too lewd for me.</br></br></br>  <br>Same guy.<br>I really like this scene.<br>"She'll still be reading her books in this room, even if the world ends."<br>That's why I think both are perfect for each other.<br>They connect in a way that no one else can.<br>They get along even if they fight superficially.<br><br> But that's my own opinion which may vary from others </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It just occurred to me that both Yukino and 8man at the start of the series essentially had the same solution to different problems. It seems however that Yukino's barriers were stronger than his.</br>  <br>Because that was not the real Yukino you dumb fuck.<br><br>That's just a shell, a mere shallow copy of her sister.<br><br>So you are saying 8man and Haruno should be a couple, right?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with 8man? Those aren't dead fish eyes.</br>  <br>Pretty sure damn Haruno has never acted like that at all.<br><br>Yukino being a loner, reading on her own all day and insulting 8man is something she did on her own without any influence.</br></br></br>  <br>ayyy</br>  <br>Shut up Yui, you don't even like his eyes.</br>  Why does a girl who has been confessed to countless times by better looking guys than 8man get embarrassed by a comment of her being cute by some creep with dead fish eyes?  <br>Dead fish eyes are okay if it's Hikki's.</br>  <br>because that manga tried to copy Bakemonogatari.</br>  <br>Yui doesn't like everything Hikki. I bet she hates his posture, his eyes, his awful attitude etc.<br><br>In fact why does she even like him? I bet she just has a simple crush on him.</br></br></br>  <br>Because he makes her heart go doki doki</br>  <br> Yukino's matter would heavily sway this <br>Would she be happy above all else?<br><br>What if they solve Yukino's problem and 8man was left with A) Yukino and B) Yui to end the series and he chose B?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Learned who he really was and fell for that. Doesn't want to see him hurt himself. Worries for him.</br>  <br/>  <br>So how is it different than a crush? All she is is infatuated with him and finds him interesting. She doesn't really want to be by his side to support him, she doesn't want to be with him just to be with him. If he got a GF that wasn't her she wouldn't be that bothered by it.</br>  <br>Didn't you see when she thought Yukino was going out with him? She didn't even want to hear about it. She clearly does want to be with him. But now she also sees that her friend is having issues that need to be resolved. There are also moments where she thinks she's not progressing because she sees her friend/rival get some alone time with him.</br>  <br>That's just crush alright. But it's hard to get over your first crush unless you tasted some rejection or depression.<br><br>So I bet even when Yui and 8man became a couple, they will break up soon after.</br></br></br>  <br>She would be happy, if she's sure Yukino isn't looking to Hikki for anything else than friendship. By which Yukino and Yui has to make it clear their feelings for each other and towards Hikki.</br>  <br>Hikki holding off on her advances after so many times already already counts as rejections. And she's not asking anything more other than wanting him to take her up on her offers.</br>  <br> if she's sure Yukino isn't looking to Hikki for anything else than friendship. <br>Even if 8man loved Yui but if Yukino still loved 8man she wouldn't accept? I think she would accept 8man and try to smooth things over with Yukino rather than reject 8man just because Yukino exists.<br><br><br> She didn't even want to hear about it <br>She was being considerate. It didn't eat her up inside to see him with another woman. <br><br>Am I The only one who thinks that there won't be any hard feelings or hurt feelings?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>i would love a Miura end. Iroha fag from the bottom of my heart, but i like to watch a girl love a freak cos she hust love him. No motives, no reasons, no mind. Just and pure wild feel of love.</br>  <br>There will be hurt feelings no matter what but they won't be as harsh as they would've been before.</br>    <br> End of vol 10 <br>8man chooses one over the other<br><br> End of vol 11 <br>8man chooses one over the other. <br><br>How would things change?<br><br><br>She was being nice and didn't think she should intrude on their nice little romance as a third wheel. She was bothered by that, she wasn't bothered that 8man was with another girl.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a good take on that situation. Climax for Yui's development as well since the whole reason she couldn't speak her mind at the start was because she was too mindful of how other people are instead of being herself. <br><br>Which does mirror abit of Hikki's loner excuse of not wanting to bother other people by making himself noticed. Huh. perhaps Yui and Hikki's development is really subtle and linked if that's true.</br></br></br>  <br> It's a good take on that situation <br>How would that take be good? It would be frustrating and awful. <br><br>I thought she couldn't speak her mind was because of how little she thought of herself.</br></br></br></br>  <br> She was being considerate. It didn't eat her up inside to see him with another woman. <br>It didn't eat her up inside at that time because she didn't even know them for that long but it still hurt her.<br><br>In the LN the misunderstanding looked pretty bigger with the way Yukino was clinging to 8man's back then going on about wanting to tell her to come to the club to talk about "us".</br></br></br></br>  <br> It didn't eat her up inside at that time because she didn't even know them for that long but it still hurt her. <br>So are you implying it would eat her up on the inside now that she knows them so well?<br><br>Just because it was a huge misunderstanding that doesn't mean her actions weren't based off of consideration rather than hurt.</br></br></br></br>  <br>  she would accept 8man and try to smooth things over with Yukino rather than reject 8man just because Yukino exists. <br><br>Her talk with Miura the next episode showed it more clearly she holds herself back because of other people. If it's about her self-esteem issue, her giving cookies to Hikki shows she's already doing something about it. <br><br>vol 11's last scenes can be read a one giant roundabout way of her holding herself back again. <br><br>Saving grace was she had a motive to achieve behind it, whether the motive was good or bad is up to your take.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> one giant roundabout way of her holding herself back again. <br>And Hikki told her that it was not kosher to do that sort of thing anymore out of not it being genuine.<br><br>Her giving him those cookies out of "thanks" will be a huge mistep even if Yukino, me, you, Yui, and everyone else but Hikki knew damn well they were not "thanks" cookies.<br><br>  whether the motive was good or bad is up to your take. <br>I imagine if this were an eroge that would the choice that gave a normal end if Hikki didn't say anything.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>First season was so much fun</br>  <br>Her finally saying "I want this, whatever happens happens" would be great even if she failed because at least she tried.</br>  Iroha is so fucking lewd.<br><br> I love it </br></br>  <br>Is Iroha going to do things to his 8? Why? I thought she liked Hayama, unless this is practice.</br>  <br>Why Yui called herself unfair? Why 8man said he won't let her call herself unfair? Did he know what is this "unfair" is all about?</br>  <br>she went in knowing it wouldn't be genuine. My point is she made a stand about what she wanted instead of what other people wanted to hear.<br><br>if the anime wasn't clear, the TL of chapter 9 showed Hikki knew better it wasn't just thanks cookies.</br></br></br>  <br>Might as well TL it too since I have nothing else to do.<br><br> I've been interested since some time ago.. <br> Doesn't it become haard? <br><br> Senpai's t.h.i.n.g. / This part of senpai. <br><br> Haah?! Wait a moment, yoou! </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Confirmed for practice.<br><br><br>I get your point. I want Yui to develop a more assertive streak for better or worse. I have no clue she wants but it will be nice once she's out with it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yui was always been assertive. It just that it wasn't in your face and the competition was non-exist. She asked for a date and reminded 8man of it.<br><br>It just that she tends to avoid conflict. So, once she felt that she was having a conflict of interest, she was willing to kill any chances she had.</br></br></br>  <br>This is just my assumption from Vol 11 chapter 9 TL.<br><br> Why Yui called herself unfair?  <br><br>Because Yui forcing them making decision that will affect their relationship without 8man and Yukino are preparing theirself for it.<br><br> Why 8man said he won't let her call herself unfair?  <br><br>Because 8man have faith on Yui already thinking through her action is the best way to solve their problem.<br><br> Did he know what this unfair is all about? <br><br>Yes. I think he did.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  8man, if there are two flowers you must pluck them both, Nothing is stopping you.  <br> flowers <br> not plastic replicas </br></br>  <br>8man only interested to go on "someday" with Yui only.</br>  <br>Is that, according to you, genuine?</br>  <br>If he wants it and they want it. It doesn't have to fit society to be genuine, it is their feelings that matter.</br>  <br>He has a favorite though, and neither of them are interested in being a 2nd wife.</br>  <br> He has a favorite though, <br>Hasn't been established<br><br> neither of them are interested in being a 2nd wife. <br>We don't know that. It hasn't been shown that the girls think about having him to themselves with no other girl. They are friends so it would work out somehow and neither has a jealous streak.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you think there would be no hard feelings for another girl?<br>Look at reality. Reality is not a fairy tale where amazing things happen just for the sake of convenience.</br></br>  <br>It has nothing to do with hard feelings, it has everything to do with what is right. This isn't a convenient ending, it is the correct one.</br>  <br>Claiming he didn't have a favorite would be a lie.<br><br>Let me paint a picture, they all go skydiving and the girls' parachute don't open.<br><br>8man has enough time to make his way to one of them and save them. In that instance he would be forced to make a decision and there's no way in hell his decision would be "Sorry but I like you both equally so I have no choice but to let you both die because I can't pick a favorite."</br></br></br></br></br>  What does this mean?<br> Is this subtle foreshadowing? </br>  <br>It has nothing to do with what is right either. It's about something they want. Yui already told what she wanted, Yukino about to say what she wants and the finale, we'll have what 8man desired.</br>  <br>You know it's really not that difficult to take snapshots in mpc or vlc.</br>  <br> Let me paint a picture, they all go skydiving and the girls' parachute don't open. <br>Let them both die then sue the company for everything they got.</br></br>  <br> It's about something they want. <br>And this could be the ending if they want it.

It felt like it fit in to the atmosphere at the time, and it didn't feel like it was merely forced into the anime. It's as if there's more to look forward to after this episode, as if   it's teasing for Haruhi S3 </br></br></br></br>  HARUHI S3 ANNOUNCED AT END OF EPISODE?!  No subs yet?  <br>Watch it raw like you're going in dry</br>   To be continued... <br><br>HARUHI S3 CONFIRMED</br></br>  <br>I can't wait for season   2 of Yuki-chan </br>  <br>Sorry, I'm busy watching the  dub. </br>  <br> dub <br>anon pls</br></br>  <br>I'm sorry, but I just can't say no to Crispin Freeman.</br>  <br> I've only watched Haruhi with dub until this.   Crispin Freeman is a great Kyon. </br>  <br>If I'll ever watch the spinoff dub I guess it'll be for Freeman.</br>   Itsumo no Fuukei Kara Hajimaru Monogarari starts to play after the festival <br> endless eight kyon-denwa in the beginning and end of the episode <br> that melancholic Haruhi at the festival <br> the series is not over <br> mfw <br>FUCK THEY'RE PLAYING WITH MY HEART.<br>This last episode really made me want S3 now.

Hurry up HS.</br></br>  What will be OVA about?  <br>TAAAAAAAAAAAKIIIIIIIIIIIIII</br>  That's a very quiet end... will Haruhi disappear forever now?  S3 for the 10th anniversary of the anime<br><br>If it still doesn't happen then, I'll finally give up hope for good</br></br>  This shit's been reduced to a meme for me. I won't ever look at Yuki Nagato again without thinking of TAAHKEY  <br>If we get some new pachinko, you can be sure things won't be quiet around here.</br>  What the fuck is Funi doing  This is the last chance I have to post a reminder in a Yuki-chan thread that this exists.<br><br>http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=6<wbr>43687</wbr></br></br>  <br>neat</br>  This show was fucking awful.<br>I only suffered through it to tell people how bad it was.<br>Also what the fuck is Funi doing, I want to end this torment as soon as possible.<br>Oh, and never download [qsub].<br>Thank you.</br></br></br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>643687</wbr> <br>What kind of mega autism is this?</br></br>  The new dub episode is up at least.  WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, WHERE IS THE EPISODE?!  <br>I got to the beginning of episode 14 and just stopped. I couldn't handle it anymore. It wasn't worth it</br>  <br><br>What an absolute joke.</br></br>  <br> Sasaki is going to be animated <br>Yes, please.</br></br>  <br>Hell, I stopped at the first two episodes of the amnesia arc, but I'm willing to get back on that horse just for her.</br>   the fan service episode finally gets dubbed   Kyon-kun, denwa~  <br>they even got the same voices for the butler and the maid from the original series,</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128234339 <br>It's not on nyaa either. Hell, it's not even on Funimation yet. What the hell is going on? I don't pay for their streaming service just so I can watch it at the same time poorfags do.</br>  <br>It's a spin off, not a fanfiction.</br>  <br> But theres only 1 season and a movie <br>The fuck you smoking?</br></br>  <br><br> 2 broadcast seasons <br><br> 1 chronological season </br></br></br></br>  Just two more weeks and we get to hear Ruff's robot-Nagato voice again. I can't wait!  I ended up watching this series without seeing the original Haruhi version or the movie until 2 weeks ago.<br><br>I have to say I ended up hating Haruhi in her own series. Spoiled cunt.</br></br>  i thought they ended this after season 1. The endless eight sucked. Thats what made the show shit. Haurhi should have remembered she was god and ruined everything.  Where the fuck are muh subs?!  <br>subs  never </br>  <br>How could we allow Horrible Subs to do this to us?</br>  <br><br> I have to say I ended up hating Haruhi in her own series. Spoiled cunt. <br><br>A lot of people did, myself included. I never felt she was MC though, she's like a prop.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's not Horrible Subs (at least I don't think it is) it's Funimation. They haven't posted the new episode yet either. <br><br>If there's a problem, then that's okay as long as they say that they're working on it, but so far I don't know anything.</br></br></br>  Just watched raw. I liked this episode, and my favorite moment was when Itsumo no Fuukei started playing.<br>Still waiting subs, still waiting S3, but it was a fun ride.</br>  <br> she's like a prop <br>That's more generous than me. I considered her the villain.</br></br>  <br>Definitely not HorribleSubs' fault, they just yank whatever is on crunchyroll, so it's whoever makes those subs who is to blame for this delay.<br><br>And last week's delay</br></br></br>  <br> It's one of my favorites from spring. </br>  <br><br><br>I  like  Haruhi</br></br></br>  SUBS WHEREEEEE  <br><br>Yeah, the episode wasn't even up on Funimation's site the last I checked, so HS can't deliver because they don't have it.</br></br>  <br>yeah, but they're getting this show from Funi.<br>Funi hasn't posted it yet, therefore HS doesn't have it yet.</br></br>  <br>T H I S<br>H I S <br>I S<br>S</br></br></br></br>  <br>The worst part is that even if funimation releases the episode, it will take some time for horriblesubs to rip it because it has to be done manually.</br>  Well I guess I'll check back tomorrow then.  <br>I  love  Haruhi.</br>  <br>Asakura might not be best girl (pic related) but surely she is best waifu</br>  <br><br><br>ITT people who haven't read the LNs and likely watched the original in broadcast order.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's me alright. I don't hate Haruhi, but she's not my favorite character in the original series (that I watched in broadcast order).</br>  What's with no sub this late?  <br>a lot of Asakura and Tsuruya appearance that make me keep watching this show</br>  <br>I know of someone that has read them and dislikes her quite a bit. <br>That doesn't stop me from gushing over her whenever we talk about the series.</br></br>  <br><br>Sir I may not agree with your choice but I sure as hell respect it.</br></br>  Fuck this, I wanted to finish this shit today and pretend it never existed.   1080p out <br>It's time.</br>  ITS OUT  <br>KITAAAAAAAAA<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=K6y<wbr>4EPDtuRc</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  That firework scene had me really confused in the RAW. Glad subs finally showed up though. I really enjoyed how this ended.  KYON-KUN DENWA  <br>Why does she sit like that?</br>  <br>May as well wait for Lemon. They normally finish in like an hour or two anyways.</br>  <br>maybe her butt hurts</br>  <br>FROM WHAT?!</br>    nyoron~  webm requests?  EH, NANDATTE?  <br>The first scene with the fireworks if you wouldn't mind. I've been too lazy to make them myself.</br>  So the other Yuki comes back for just a moment just to hear his confession, it's alittle weird but I'm okay with this.  <br>It's a bit more like she was still there, in some aspect, and he was talking though yuki-chan to the other yuki for just a moment.</br>  So what's the OVA gunna be? Place your bets.  mfw  Haruhi lost   SOON  had no idea was last episode; watch l8r  <br>DENWA</br>  <br>rendering now</br>  NANIKA OKASHII  <br>KYON-KUN DENWA</br>   Bouken desho desho   Shit show. Glad it's over.  <br>Thanks for letting us know :^)</br>    <br>Thanks.</br>     Alien yuki won <br>That was a good final episode.</br>  <br> watching a show you hate until the very end <br>Wow, how much free time do you have, anon?</br></br>  Finally. We can end this shit now. Together. All of us. Love and unity, we will rid ourselves at last of this horrendous monster.  <br><br><br>It was a good show. I wish it were longer.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br><br>You are all aware there's an OVA coming in October, right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>FUCK</br>  <br>Nice.</br>  <br>Can I get a source?</br>  <br>https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/da<wbr>ily-briefs/2015-03-27/the-disappear<wbr>ance-of-nagato-yuki-chan-original-v<wbr>ideo-anime-bundled-with-manga/.8643<wbr>6</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></br>  <br>Thanks.</br>  <br>Alien yuki still best</br>  <br>Holy shit this episode was amazing, that ending! wow.<br><br>MORE!</br></br></br>  What did they do to Asakura?  <br> 704x421 <br>Why?</br></br>  <br>Made her Yuki's mother.</br>  oh damn   not one, but two denwas <br> open for S2 <br><br>Good series, S3fag tears were delicious to the end.</br></br></br>  Episode opens with "Kyon-kun denwa."<br><br>Ends with Endless 8 denwa. This episode made the show worth watch.<br><br> I still hated it though, this Yuki is trash. </br></br></br></br>  <br>Kyon likes alien yuki more anyways</br>  <br>Nah, he just said that he could learn to love her.</br>  <br>Looks like Kyon-kun's gonna be eating Takii on Sunday.</br>   Suddenly Itsumo no Fuukei starts playing <br>Damn, that took me back. I teared up a little.</br>  I wanted to feel the pain of endless 8 again, and only today do i learn this is the last episode. Never before have i been so disappointed.   that Itsumo no fuukei all of sudden <br>My heart wasn't ready.</br>  So now that it's over, how do you rate it?  <br> these last couple chapters <br><br>Oh my sweet jesus, my heart can't take this before bed.</br></br></br>  <br>8/10</br>  <br>7/10.</br>  <br>9/10</br>  <br>8/0</br>  <br>7/10</br>  <br>3.5/10</br>  <br>The adaption was absolutely fantastic.<br>I'm still unsure if I'm sold on the story itself, however.</br></br>  <br>7/10</br>  <br>5/10<br>It had it's ups and downs. Sometimes it annoyed me, sometimes I got a good laugh and the Disappearance arc was great. But the annoyances really just weighed it down on me as a not bad but not good show either. I'll watch the OVA but I doubt I'll rewatch the series again.</br></br>  <br>6/10</br>  <br> Disappearance arc was great. <br>That's not how you spell confusing nonsense.</br></br>  <br>How was it confusing?</br>  Man, watching this made me really nostalgic.  <br>All I know is that I probably wouldn't recommend it.</br>  <br>She becomes a Nagato that is not really Nagato but is still Nagato just because a car brushed past her.</br>  <br>You don't sound confused at all, I'm pretty sure that's exactly what happened.<br>It may be bullshit but it's not confusing.</br></br>  <br>7/10<br><br>I want my emotional, moeblobby, funnyface making meganekko Yuki. I wish she had her actual own show with cool alien Yuki as the inner monlog.</br></br></br>  <br>+More Asakura<br>+More Tsuruya<br>-TAHKI</br></br></br>  So just getting this straight, kyon confessed to other Yuki and not TAAKI, right?<br>Also did other Yuki take control during that scene or did normal yuki just pull a "Eh, nandatte?"?</br>  <br>Fireworks too loud. <br>Can't hear Kyon.<br>Other Yuki is dead.</br></br></br>  <br> October <br><br>Fuck you, I'll be dead by then.</br></br></br>  <br>6/10<br>and I'm a yukifag<br>and haruhi is one of my favorite anime ever</br></br></br>  <br>Why does she sit like that?</br>   sasaki and kuyou voiced in the OVA <br>I WANT TO BELIEVE.</br>  <br>2/10 Boring and shameless using Haruhi to attract some readers.</br>  <br><br>3/10 only redeemable scenes were with Haruhi around</br></br>  <br>MUCH FUCKING IMMINENT</br>  To the dubfags, what's the best place to watch it? Funi is blocked outside of the US  <br>Serves you right.  1/10. Your bait is not good enough. </br>  <br>It's not fan fiction because the author of Haruhi literally worked with the mangaka to write the content in the manga, you fucking retards. <br><br>His name is on the goddamn cover. A work of fan fiction wouldn't be officially affiliated with and created with the help of the writer of the light novel series the manga is based off. <br><br>I swear /a/ is nothing but braindead EOP teenagers.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> [citation needed] </br>  I WANT HARUHI S3 NOW  <br>there is a very very slim chance for an s3 if a new novel appears<br><br>even then it will probably be the last novel in the series and there are still 7 novels that the anime did not cover, not including the unreleased one</br></br></br>  so how bad/good was this exactly?  <br>Read the thread.</br>  <br>Tanigawa ran out of ideas, i don' think there will be a new novel.<br>I'm surprised that in all these years no one has tried to kickstart and S3.</br></br>  He could've kept going<br><br>he just didn't want to upset the delicate balance between yuki and haruhi<br><br>mikuru could graduate and nobody would really care that they lost the pet moeblob.</br></br></br></br>  <br> ran out of ideas <br>How? Just look at all the shit he did in the end of vol 11, he can't run out of ideas after that.</br></br>  <br>It really fits the "One chapter ends and another one will begin" Theme.<br><br>Allowing you to reminisce on what happened and look forward to what will happen next.<br><br>This theme embodies it so much.  I miss Haruhi. I miss Yuki. I miss Asahina and even Koizomi too!   Season 3 when?! </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why doesn't he releases a new novel?</br>  <br>Kadokawa would be a fool not to animate them all.<br><br>If Tanigawa someohow creates the perfect Last novel to close the Haruhi Suzumiya Universe then we can be sure that Kadokawa will hire Kyo Ani again to create the last and final season along with a movie that will create a surge of collectible mania and memorabilia buying from all the fans to round up the story that was and is one of the greatest coming of age story about a young girl and her thirst for adventure/mystery and the supernatural.</br></br></br>  Did Yuki just get NTR'd by herself?<br>And you really got me there, Satellight. I fell hard for that Endless 8.</br>  <br>Because he's a lazy ass who killed his own franchise.</br>  <br>Really funny how Ms. Asahina slapped aside Tsuruya.<br>Quite a nice bit of comedy going in here.</br></br>  <br>So what happened here was "Stoic" Nagato "possessed" Tahkkey for the few seconds that Kyon confessed right?<br><br>It felt like a nice touch. Was it similar to the manga? If not, I approve of the anime version much more.</br></br></br>  <br>No fucking. Only cuddling under sheets while hand holding right?</br>  <br>6/10 for the first few "SOL" episodes with Tahkii.<br>8/10 for the final few episodes.<br><br>Averaging out to 7/10.<br><br>The mixing of the mundane and the mysterious returns on that last half and made it worthwhile similar to the original. Makes you think what you would do if you had a relative that had a personality shift as well. Good stuff.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I really wish they kept the Nagato that wasn't retarded, it was more fun watching bookworm Nagato and Kyon interact.

And Nagato gives that in spades.<br><br>Kyon should've grown out of his wanting of the supernatural wafter he graduated from Junior High. And there are no confirmation of those supernatural things in high school for him in this universe.</br></br></br></br></br>  So S3 announcement mid-August?<br><br>I'm gonna miss Yuki-chan's Asakura, only thing the show did right</br></br>  <br> Normally Kyon is a quiet nice guy that wants to live a peaceful life. <br>Kyon absolutely doesn't want that. Oh sure, that's what he'll end up doing if nobody forces him to do anything else, but he will always enjoy an exciting and stressful life more than he will a relaxed and peaceful one. That's how he's wired.</br></br>  anyone have that picture of Kyon giving Nagato back her I Choo Choo Choose You card?  Didn't the director say there would be a surprise? Better deliver with the OVA.  The next two dub episodes are going to be fantastic.  Hearing Ruff's Robot-Nagato voice again will make life worth living until then.

I think I'll keep watching it.<br><br>Shit moves so fast though.</br></br>  What do you manga nerds think of the adaptation so far?  <br>Think it was pretty obvious she isnt commando.</br>  <br>It's too rushed but other than that it's fine.</br>  <br><br>Mixed feelings. Voice acting is good, unenecessary censorship is bad, the animation is passable.<br><br>Some people take issue with the pacing.

Also, Kiyoshi comments on how can't see them underneath.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I think I'm gonna need a webm of the not having permission to sumo stomp bit.  <br>He said that for comedic effect as he continued to stare at her ass and think of possibilities as she left. She brought out the point that they both didnt even realize they were wearing each others underwear so they should both be used to it and go like this.</br>  Censorship killing it  Fuck all you faggots. This manga is amazing. Funny and Lewd as hell, yet /a/ hardly ever sees it. Fuck It all  <br><br>I don't know man.

I feel jealous of secondaries. They get to discover how great Karen and Nao are for the first time.  <br>Does Nao get bullied a lot?</br>  <br>She gets love just as much so it cancels out.</br>  <br>That's really cute.</br>  <br>Sure, she is in highschool and still watches kiddy cartoons<br>Her hair looks like shit<br>Not very good personality too<br>I bet people beat shit from her to reveal stress and rape her in free time</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes they enjoy watching her cry. They take a perverse joy in watching her suffer.</br>  <br><br>That's, uh, not as cute. At all.</br></br>  <br> and then there's this faggot <br>There always has to be that one guy who just pushes it a little too far.</br></br>  <br>She would look so much better if she didn't wear straight bangs, had less bushy eyebrows and didn't scowl like a bitch all the time.</br>  <br> wanting Nao to be a generic anime waifu <br><br>You do not know that her brows are love. I bet you want her to shave down there too.</br></br></br>  <br>For all we know she's conscious of it and already does.<br><br>And she's already a generic anime waifu, I would just prefer if she was an attractive generic anime waifu</br></br></br>  <br>She's already attractive.</br>  <br> this is considered generic <br>we must have differing interpretations of generic then. I personally love her eyebrows and fluffy features added into her already trigger sensitive personality. She is like a little fluffy bundle of joy that needs a good dose of vitamin love.</br></br>  <br>This would be amazing. So of course it won't happen.</br>  <br>Not Nao.</br>    Pink Check School when?  I missed this so much.<br><br>And I missed Miria so much. Hopefully I'll be able to resist the urge to commit crimes for another season.</br></br>  <br>I mean Nao, not Nao. Post Nao, Nao.</br>  <br> Hopefully I'll be able to resist the urge to commit crimes for another season. <br>Some crimes are good crimes.</br></br>  Looks like fanbase is dead, compared to the first season one     reshuffling idols begins <br> Mayu episode <br> incoming TP and Rock The Beat  <br><br>This episode really gives me hopes for plenty of cameos. In this episode alone we had like 6, not counting the poster ones.<br><br>At the same time it makes me kinda sad to see what this anime could have been - wacky adventures of NG, featuring all sorts of CG cameos in every episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hopefully I'll be able to resist the urge to commit crimes for another season <br>Well for your own sake I hope you do, can't have anons getting locked away during the second cour. You would never be able to forgive yourself if you did.</br></br>  <br>This is like third or fourth thread, not to mention /@/ is full of CG which doesn't happen ever. Gotta sleep sometime, anon</br>  <br> wacky adventures of NG, featuring all sorts of CG cameos in every episode <br> Implying that's a good thing <br>They started off good, then fucked it up by episode 2</br></br></br>  <br> not to mention /@/ is full of CG which doesn't happen ever. <br>It's like a 40/35/25 split with ML/765/CG</br></br>  <br>Now THIS is a mystery that needs to be solved!</br>   Want to be rock idol <br> doesn't know rock idols <br> doesn't even know rock <br>A shit</br></br></br>   Literally only 1 line of dialogue the entire episode <br>15 Weeks.<br>15 Fucking weeks.</br></br>  <br>Why did they fuck up though? First half of Episode 2 was good. Usamin being Usamin, Sae/Miho cameos, delicious KWSM and plenty of unvoiced cameos like New Wave and Natsuki. Then they decided to introduce entire Project in few minutes which is what in my opinion ruined it. <br><br>Now don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the Project girls, in fact I like them much more than NG and I'm loving the anime original units such as LL and Asterisk, but I'm just saying that it might've been better idea not to put focus on 14 girls, because unlike 765, 346 has almost two hundred idols.</br></br></br>  <br>I hate tiny hats</br>  <br>No you don't.<br><br><br>I'm sure we will get a whole episode about the hooker and Minami. I'm sure.</br></br></br></br>  <br>They fucked up by keeping the others as "cameos" and using NG in their stead because "Muh vehicle characters", they could have easily given the others more prominent roles early on by simply replacing NG with those Non-CP idols, guiding them instead of causing trouble.<br><br>The 3 episode introduction arc was even more of a fuck up for the same reason.</br></br></br>  <br>Rin's got more than enough moments already, I'm talking about an episode with Anya and Minami.</br>  I'm scared of Mayu.  <br>I hate you<br><br><br>Right now we have the half-assed mixture of both. Whether it's wacky adventures of NG or anime that decides to focus on entire Project and REALLY means it, either way the outcome would've been better than what A-1 has actually done.<br><br><br>Mayu is a good girl</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>When I said "started off good", I meant they had the right idea to make the anime "focus"  HAH  on 14 girls, the fucked up bit was like  said, make NG vehicle characters, now I'm not saying it because it's NG, I'm saying it because they're vehicle characters, and with a cast line as big as CG, that is the worst possible thing to do as it leaves unfair attention distribution and hints of favoritism.</br>  <br>Ultimate cool team</br>  <br>Literally worse than Hitler.</br>  <br> hints of favoritism. <br> In CG <br>Surely you jest.</br></br></br>  Meanwhile, at the 10th live..  <br>Is that the venue?</br>  <br> you will never be there </br>  I have a new favorite.  New units will be exciting and all but I can't help but think about dookie's smile being shattered.<br><br>She will put on a strong front and encourage everybody about being excited for a new direction but deep inside...</br></br>  <br>Jesus, is that bigger?</br>  <br>I've waited so long to hear her voice. So fucking long. I really think that if A-1 is gonna give out free voices to idols, they should focus on somewhat popular ones like Karin instead of literally whos like Aki.</br>  <br>Yeah you would, you fucking slut.</br>  <br> Im@s confirmed for PS4 at 10th <br>My dick.</br></br>  <br>No way is that real, I know Japan loves Idol but that shit is out of control Jesus.<br><br><br>How many is in that, 150k?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Seibu Dome.<br><br>Capacity: 34,000-37,000 people. And obviously, tickets sold out.</br></br></br>  <br>They even rented out the lawn.</br>  <br> 34-37k <br>Huh, that's not really THAT big. Didn't they have bigger live before or am I mistaking it for other nip franchise?</br></br>  <br>I imagine they're pushing the limit.<br><br>With the extra seats rolled out, they probably broke 40,000+ attendees here.</br></br></br>  <br>Stadium events always look a lot bigger than they actually are.</br>  <br><br>40,000 or so is already plenty big.<br><br>For reference, the average SuperBowl reels in 60,000+ capacity.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Also Taiko Vita game and Idolmaster-Tekken collab. Harada, you fuck.</br>  <br> Idolmaster-Tekken collab <br>Wait, really?</br></br>  <br>Yes really. Apparently it looks laughably weird.</br>  <br>Is it DOA-collad level where the Tekken girls gets iM@S costumes?</br>  <br>It sounds pretty fucking weird. How the fuck is that even supposed to work? The games are entirely different.<br>No, wait, the important question is if we'll be able to make Kazuya sing songs.</br></br>  <br>It's Tekken 7 DLC so probably costumes.</br>  <br><br>Is that guy the final boss?</br></br>  <br> they should focus on somewhat popular ones  <br><br><br> like Karin </br></br></br></br>  <br>So, Tekken now returns the favor, huh.</br>  <br> Tekken OFA DLC </br>  <br>We can all learn from Harada.</br>  <br>Don't you remember that one poll when anime started airing? She had plenty of stickers, I think she even made top 30. Meanwhile Aki didn't even make the top 100</br>  <br>Rigged Akiba sticker polls mean nothing.</br>  <br> sticker poll <br> rigged <br>As opposed to what, the cinderella election?</br></br></br>  Where do producers come from /a/?  <br>If Mayu carves one open we can find out.</br>  <br> rigged <br>And even then it would still be more fair than the CG Election</br></br>  <br>Yes, actually.</br>  <br><br>Did Harada ever wear one of those all-print shirts?</br></br>  <br>Probably. There are some interviews where he's in Iori everything.</br>  <br> Harada has a prime view of Iori's ass and cunny. </br>  <br> 10th <br>S A C H I K O<br>T<br>R<br>O<br>N<br>G</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Average MikiP<br>https://twitter.com/Kurotsuki</br></br>  <br>CG Election has nothing to do with popularity in the first place.

Is it an original story or something?</br>  <br>Keep in mind that every battle was in Cairo according too ASB</br>  <br>Yeah, and every battle in Part 1 was in Dio's castle. ASB fucked itself a bit with the lack of stages.</br>  He makes me feel confused and funny about myself. Is this a bad thing?  <br>My point is that it could just be a scene where they're just talking to each other but they don't want to bother making a background for the scene so they just use the Cairo stage</br>  <br>Oh, it's Cairo? It looks like a big shopping mall or something to me.</br>  <br>If it were an original story, it'd be cool if it was about all the JoJo's finding themselves in some weird universe and they have to fight ton survive</br>  <br>With a name like eyes of heaven. You'd think the story mode would be the JoJo time crossover we've always wanted to see. I mean it's already set up in the post battle quotes, might as well just go all the way.</br>  <br><br><br><br>fuck i'm hype<br>i'm getting actually giddy about the idea of an original story mode<br>just actual character models speaking instead of text scrolls like ASB is enough for me</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hot Pants is cute!! cute</br>  <br> You will be able to walk around Morioh in your lifetime <br>How is EoH not the best JoJo game?</br></br>  <br> Swastikas <br>Stroheim would be proud</br></br>  <br>Funny in what way, anon?</br>  <br>The ending is definitely underwhelming, but it helps to consider GER not as the climax, but part of the resolution.

He doesn't have a real name because he's the fusion of Yoshikage Kira and Josefumi Kujo </br>    <br>my friend's oc</br>   old translations of part 5 <br>I'm reading part 6 now.</br>  <br>Hopefully SHA will work better here than it did in ASB.</br>  <br>He's David Bowie. It's only natural</br>      why the fuck does ZA WARUDO Diego Wryyy?  <br>Because /a/ is wrong about Wryyy being a vampire thing, it's just a psychopath thing</br>  Daily remainder that glorious Englishman Vampire Overlord Dio Brando is better than Greasy NEET DIO    <br> Josefumi somehow went to original universe <br> Saved Josuke in the snow <br> Pucci split him in half at one point, sending him back to JJLverse </br></br></br>  <br> somehow josuke's hair got worse </br>  <br>Anon, let it go, it's like expecting to get a flashback to Dio having a second coffin</br>  <br><br>Think Jo2uke will have the pompadour under his hat?</br></br>   Araki couldn't continue the trend of previous jojos showing up and helping out that part 3 started <br><br> We'll never get Josuke getting roped into a bunch of mobster nonsense   and saving everyone's lives with crazy diamond <br> We'll never get Giorno getting dragged to the prison along with every other one of Dio's children <br> We'll never get alternate Jolyne showing up at the SBR race somehow </br></br></br></br>  Tfw wanted someone like Midorikawa as Diego but they're forcing Koyasu onto him even though they Diego isn't the same person as Dio.<br><br>I mean I love Koyasu and he's one of my favourite castings but I don't see why they're using him as Diego.</br></br>  <br>SHA in ASB had unblockable setups though, it wasn't bad.</br>   in the end the part 7 protagonists kill more innocent people and for a much more selfish goal than the villain   <br>he sounds like he's doing a higher voice but i guess i understand</br>  <br>Best I have.</br>  <br>Bruno's fights were way more interesting than Giorno's. My favorite was the one on the train.<br><br>Also remember how GE could give someone so much life energy that they experience everything in slow motion? <br>Why the hell did Araki just drop that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>He also dropped reflecting damage</br>  <br>By the way why did Josuke apply for being a doctor? Imagine how many lives he could save with his stand. Of course he can't cure diseases but still.</br>    <br>How is 2 times a "trend"?</br>  Did Araki forgit Dio's scar in part 6 ?  Don't delude yourself. You know she is the best.  I LOVE UMI!  Why is her solo song so shit though?  Don't delude yourself. You know she is the worst.

If she was part flip I'd understand.</br>  <br> only girl with an actual personality <br> worst </br></br>  Nozomi &gt; Eli &gt; nobody else even comes close so why bother ranking any further  <br>Well Sora went to Mexico and Rippi's going to Brazil. It's not like Pile going to Flipland will be different.<br><br>Also, she's half-Korean so it kind of makes sense.</br></br></br>  Maki, Honoka, and Nico are the worst girls. All have shit personalities and are annoying. Oh yeah, and Rin.  <br> Pile is coming. <br>This pleases me.</br></br>  <br>But the masses hate Honoka, she's the least popular one.</br>  <br>The littler the honk, the better the bonk.</br>  <br>I love youuu.</br>  I love Rin.  Who's ready for lewd love live doujin from C88?  Mami is teh best gurl.<br>Anyone who doesn't agree hasn't read "The Different Story" or "Oriko Magica"<br><br><br>ITT: discuss who is the best girl<br>hint: It's Mami</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I say Different Story is cannon.

They are both great additions to the Puella Magi franchise.</br>  <br>She has the same va as my waifu, so I guess she's cool.</br>  Do you like dual-wielding?  Only for fists or fist weapons, otherwise a polearm.  <br>Nah, it's pretty stupid and never really happened with two swords like that.</br>  <br> dual wielding fists </br>  <br>I love this guy's videos so much, he tends to make good points on what he says.</br>  <br>Which weapons? A sword &amp; buckler? A sword &amp; something for parrying?</br>  Cornucopia of Resources / Guide (read Guide before asking questions):<br>http://bitlasers.com/djt<br><br>Previous Thread:<br>https://archive.moe/a/thread/128185<wbr>027/</wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Radical search is like a needle in a haystack but thanks nonetheless, it'll be useful when you aren't on PC to be able to use KanjiTomo<br><br><br><br>Thanks this does the trick nice and easy, much appreciated.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Radical search is like a needle in a haystack <br><br>Do you have bad eyesight or something?</br></br></br>  <br><br>/djt/'s community is mostly comprised of people learning for the anime subculture family: anime, manga, VNs, LNs, Japanese videogames.<br><br>This is like going into a /co/ thread and saying that western cartoons are for children, and the people on that board need to grow up, or going to a /tv/ thread and saying that all live action western television and movies are garbage, and the fact that they watch them is proof that they're not very intelligent. Regardless of the thread, it's not going to be received warmly.<br><br>If you don't like anime, this really isn't the place to share that opinion.<br><br>I'll also say that in regards to regurgitating shit, western is just as bad, if not worse. How many movies have you seen with the exact same action hero and love interest, or cop dramas with the exact same characters reoccurring, practically word for word at times? For whatever reason, people like you seem to want to think that the quirkier, over-the-top nature of anime casts makes them inherently more regurgitated and shallow than lazy archetypes in media that's less cartoony, when that's not really true.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No, but it is a lot to look through. I suppose if you know how many lines are in a radical it makes it a lot easier but I don't so I am have to search every row carefully so I don't miss it.<br>KanjiTomo is clearly faster in this regard.</br></br>  <br> anime subculture <br><br>Isn't that insulting to people that enjoy Japanese media that isn't complete shit?</br></br></br></blockquote>]
