[ So I watched Battle in Egypt's last episodes, thinking it would be good since they saved like 90% of their budget for the finale.<br><br>Looks like I was wrong. Why does the anime have to suck so much?</br></br>  <br>The last battle wasn't good at all there wasn't any good music</br>  <br>Not to mention that art was horrible, the faggot narrator wasn't even there.</br>   Animation looks like shit? Relax guys, we can always fix it in the BDs   <br> Final blow on Dio <br> Expection Stand Proud or SONO CHI NO SADAMEEEE <br> Instead got generic Jotaro track <br><br>I mean it's not a bad song in itself but...Fuck it's DIO. Not your flavor of the week bad guy.</br></br></br></br></br>  So Im halfway through part 3 and why is jotaro so fucking boring.<br>The difference between him and joseph is killing me.<br>Its like its actually polnareff whos the main character instead of him. Is it different in the new anime ?<br>Or is part 3 just shit and I have to read/suffer through. Just past anubis now btw</br></br></br>  <br>Just watch the OVA.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=r1x<wbr>q6xg8khs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br>inb4 they don't redo this and add the faggot narrator, and put a fucking theme song in it</br>  <br> dat terrible art <br><br>No thanks</br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. What the fuck was up with the sound director?<br>They played it way too fucking safe.</br></br>  <br> OVA <br> terrible art <br>Meanwhile, in TV land....<br><br><br/></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> not knowing part 3 is actually Polnareff's Bizarre Adventure <br>Part 3 is indeed shit. Vanilla Ice and Dio are the only good parts.</br></br>  <br>Would be unfitting as fuck</br>  <br><br>Still hilarious to think OVAfags exist when its largely irrelevant now.</br></br>  <br>Exactly how I felt. The song itself isn't bad, but playing it at that moment when DIO finally lost made him feel like one of the villains-of-the-week, not DIO.</br>  <br>The OVA fight was fucking great but fuck.<br><br>What's up whit DIO's voice actor ? He doesn't give a single fuck. There is no presence or anything in his voice.<br><br>Credit is where its due ,the anime had a fantastic VA casting.<br><br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=H2s<wbr>pe_PjEVU</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Does that sound fitting for a fight with the archnemesys of your whole bloodline that just killed your Gramp ? DIO's fight was supposed to be dramatic and everything</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> The OVA fight was fucking great <br>Opinion discarded</br></br>  <br>No SONO CHI NO SADAMEEE was seriously the most disappointing thing of the year. That's literally what JoJo is about, the 3rd part in particular, everything coming back to that first night at the mansion. And they ballsed it up.</br>  <br>I know there is the usual "fidelity vs artistic liberty" when you do an adaptation but Araki's style is not really fit for animation imo.<br><br>Too much monologues and blah blah, fights are rather short to animate but everything around it takes fucking ages. Part 3 was a chore to watch. You gotta admit it.<br><br>I mean in the manga it works ,it's fucking great. But the animation was too faithful (which kinda makes sense since it will be the reference in the future).<br><br>The OVA was great because it cut the chit chat and had very good fighting scenes (the Kakyoin-DIO fight was fucking great). The animation is vasty superior (not really unexpected it's an OVA) and Dio's faces still looks Dio like. In a way I'm kinda happy they made it. It has its place.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I thought DIO's voice actor was good. Koyasu's better, I'll admit, but it's not 'bad'.</br>   yfw they cut the car scene   <br>That track is really unfitting, friend.</br>  https://<span>youtu.be/r1xq6xg8khs?t=18m1<wbr>9s</wbr>  [ ] <br><br> Jibber jabber  <br> Wallah habeebe <br>Surely this is all a meme.</br></br></br></br>  Are you faggots ready for Papi's delicious butt?<br><br>Manga:<br>-Chapter 35 coming this month, probably close to 19th with the start of Mero arc.<br>-Murderfish with problems, Darling must act.<br>-Live translation? or just a final edition coming?<br><br>Hitomi sensei:<br>-New chapter when?<br><br><br>Also:<br> Shitposters and secondaries GTFO <br> Report and ignore </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  First for free Papi  Miia ahegao with snake tongue when  <br> Murrican Papi <br><br>Disgusting.</br></br></br>  <br>Cerea NTR doujins when</br>  <br> Murdermaid <br> calling anyone else disgusting </br></br>  I wish paip has more personality or background or something worth having a couple of chapters dedicated to an arc about her, mainly to have lots of dat ass, and I want Darling to sleep over dat bare ass too.  <br>Get this merishit out of here.</br>  <br>Cant stop my freedom, nigger</br>  You wouldn't have sex with a snake   Reminder Ms. Smith is Best Girl.

Gate is a Japanese power fantasy and Jitsu is a shitty youkai high school harem I've seen thousands of when I was 12.</br></br></br>  <br>thank you.</br>  <br> Fapping to nothing but foreplay </br>  Papifags&gt;Rachnerafags=Snekfags=Slim<wbr>fags&gt;Horsefuckers = Smithfags &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; NTR defenders</wbr>  <br>Oh ok.<br><br>Thanks I guess.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude at least make him bait the hook. You shame us all with your antics, benji</br>  <br>You have to admit though MonMusu isnt all that original either if you're gonna shit on Jitsu its better to be honest on both fronts. Aside from the monstergirl aspect and the above average humorous moments its nothing too special</br>   that shot with Miia's snek fangs and lips while drooling  <br>I want to make love to Miia</br>  <br> Gate is a Japanese power fantasy <br>Gate is a fucking nationalist shit, but is fun, at least the novel. <br><br> Jitsu is a shitty youkai high school harem <br>Ok now you confirmed you're one of those secondaries, it is a fucking comedy and nothing more than that, the manga designs and reaction faces are the strong point of that but the adaptation go full moeshit and ruined everything.</br></br></br></br></br>  So, how can a small tail even grip the Button and Zipper to even undo them?  <br><br>What about  Lalafags? </br></br>  <br>Would you fuck Miia anon?</br>  <br>I'm surprised anyone even remembers Lala considering how unused she is...</br>  <br>2 can play at this game</br>  <br>That's like trying to make a population survey with a sample size of 3 people<br>Its too fucking small to make a distinction on</br></br>  <br>Shh, we already know she won, let the younglings have their fun.</br>  <br>You never see a snake in action anon? snakes usually use their tails to grab shit or helping themselves to move around things, is like the tail of a monkey just even more stronger.</br>  My penis hurts.  <br>I wonder how many people obsessed with this have even touched a snake in real life.</br>  <br>But can they pull down zippers?</br>  <br>They're not dextrous enough to undo a button and zipper</br>  <br>Never claimed it was.<br><br>Won't argue with you on Gate. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed it, it's fun ride, it just lost me when the JSDF took down all those foreign special ops teams. As for Jitsu, you're full of shit if you think its main appeal isn't the harem of cute girls. Most harems rely on comedy as a backup like Jitsu does.</br></br></br>  <br>  tumblr <br>this reminds me of that SJW that drew the Love Live cast as how would look if they were real girls as in "disgusting" and affraif it will happen the same with monmusu</br></br>  <br>It didn't grip the button.<br><br>It just popped the button out of the buttonsleevethingamajigger.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm a Miiafag and have kept snakes since I was a little kid.<br><br> No, I haven't fucked them. </br></br></br>  <br>I have, they're colder then you think, not exactly a turn on.<br><br>If they were naturally warm that's a different matter.</br></br></br>  <br>PapixFuta Suu doujins when</br>  <br>A fucking anaconda can even get you naked if you don't know how to deal with them, but instead of grab your dick they must kill you in a painfully way.</br>  <br>And the Zipper?</br>  <br>Basically, it means "go read the fucking manga first and then come talk to us afterwards". Also for all those secondaries lurking, its for your own good since most of the discussions here contain spoilers.  We're doing these for your sake </br>  <br>Nigger the girls on Jitsu aren't enjoyable, actually they sucks. Only akane is the only important girl there, dumpire and robot are fucking shit.</br>  <br>But it'd be like the cold side of a pillow on a lamia<br>And the feel of the muscle underneath is relaxing and mesmerising as fuck</br></br>  <br>You realised you don't need to grip the tag to pull down a zipper, right? It's just easier on the hands than pushing the zipper down manually. Scaly tail has no worries like that.</br>  <br>Tumblr has it's uses when if comes to images.<br><br>At least for me.</br></br></br>  <br> special ops <br>That's where you're wrong. US sent in CIA, China sent in MSS and Russia sent in a team I forgot about.<br><br>If the US sent in DEVGRU nippon would've been absolutely shat on.</br></br></br></br>  <br> "go read the fucking manga first and then come talk to us afterwards". <br><br>This only apply to the retards who only comes here to shitpost and nothing more, out there exist secondaries who actually have manners and ask things without going full retarded. Those exceptions are welcome here.</br></br></br>  <br>Chunii don't get much love</br>    <br>Anon you don't understand. I'll make enough babies with her to start a new village and then some. Until I need to hire a personal X-Ray and MRI technician for all of my broken ribs and stretched muscles.</br>  <br>Yeah</br>  <br>Ah, thanks for correcting me anon.</br>  <br>I swear it's so hard for me to find a good gif of that Mio picture.</br>  <br>do you actually own a pair of pants with a zipper on it?</br>  <br>He can't have sex with the girls. Why watch a show about a man with blue balls?</br>  <br> Mio </br>  <br>Yeah I do, and it's a bitch for me to pull down without using my thumb.<br><br>So how the fuck did she do it that quick?</br></br></br>  <br><br>Still have<br><br> Shiho <br> Akari <br> Karen </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mio <br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair though, posters like autism-san will start crying about "m-muh secondaries" even to those that politely ask questions. But still  Just read the fucking manga </br>  <br>Yeah, that's her name.</br>  So why does the government hate them having sex but Lamias can abduct men?  I dont understand people that refuse to read the manga of an anime. I mean if you enjoy the anime and want more, read the manga, it takes way less time than watching an anime. <br><br><br>If you're talking about Miia then im sorry youre retarded. If you're talking about someone else then specify.</br></br></br>  <br> Reading anything with current crabman proportions in it </br>  <br>actually when I tell them to go read them manga I'm recomending it, as a good thing to read, not telling them to fuck off, is not just easy to read and follow, it's fun</br>  <br>I think they said Lamias are not allowed to do that at one point.</br>  <br><br>See my post at . Using your thumb is actually counter-productive, it'd be like yanking both sides 90 degrees to the vertical and trying to unzip. You want the zipper to be taught and as parallel as possible. She's just that good at unzipping pants.<br><br>Also it could just be that Darling's pants have easier zippers because they're old.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Secondary is the worst meme tbh</br>  <br><br>They can't.</br></br>  <br>The reason Miia is out in the human world in the first place is so that she can seduce a man to bring back to their harem. The government said they can't abduct men for their sex prisons anymore so they need willing volunteers.</br>  <br> That law only lasts a few chapters </br>  <br><br>The blue haired girl in yellow background in the image in the post he is referencing is called Mio you fucks.</br></br>  <br> tbh <br><br/></br></br>  <br> not "cuck" or pepe <br>mememaster here, those two are as of 2015 the worst.</br></br>  <br>Mio, the name of the girl in the picture.<br><br>God, go watch some fucking Nichijou.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I said if he's talking about someone else he should specify.<br><br> Watch Nichijou  <br><br>how about you fuck off.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I shouldn't like this as much as I do. I really shouldn't. But I do.</br>  <br>It's a pretty good show and an underrated KyoAni gem</br>  <br>How about you watch a good anime fag?</br>  <br>How about the idea that I dont watch anime fag?<br><br> Except Monmusu cause I like the manga quite a bit. </br></br></br>  <br> secondaries <br>Don't be like FSN fags.</br></br>  I can wait until the MON squad chapter is adapted. And then all the animeonlyfags that think Miia is best girl will realize the true best Monster girl that is Zombina. They will she how fucking amazing she is.<br><br>Though I feel bad for all the Miiafags because she really turns into a irrelevant shitty character as the series progresses.</br></br>  <br>14 yr olds pls.</br>  <br>Well assuming you watched Monster Musume's anime that's a start I guess...</br>  <br><br> The wrapped tail looks like the end of a maggot </br></br>  So can we all agree that Team Mon deserves their own spinoff?    Threadly reminder to take a moment to imagine what paizuri with Cathyl would be like.  <br>Paizuri is shit. It's almost less enjoyable than a handjob.</br>  <br>This</br>    Why is Papi already in the short videos?  <br>Because she's best girl.</br>  <br>Is that a new one? Mind posting a webm please?</br>  <br>What short videos? Where'd you find them?</br>  <br>To cute</br>    <br>It must feel amazing.<br><br><br><br>Clearly you've never had a proper one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Paizuri is shit <br><br>Confirmed for not having it done in real life.

Does Papi have a normal human type vagina or does she have a cochlea?</br>  <br>Oh of fucking course anon.<br><br>When the pv came out i thought it was quite good, when the first episode came out i had that song in my dreams, so catchy.</br></br></br>  <br> "ANON I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DON'T GIVE ME MY TIT BACK YOU'LL REGRET IT! NOT ONLY AM I EXTENSIVELY TRAINED IN ARMED COMBAT, BUT I HAVE ACCESS TO THE ENTIRE ARSENAL OF MON AND I WILL USE IT TO ITS FULL EXTENT TO WIPE YOUR MISERABLE ASS OFF THE FACE OF THE CONTINENT, YOU LITTLE SHIT!" </br>  How can people like cuckfish?<br><br>Bondagespider and rapeslime best girls</br></br>  <br><br>HEY DARLING Is the best part of that op.<br><br>I also like the ED too.

Same with Miia since her snake parts start right after her hips</br>  <br>Why not just get new ones?</br>  <br>Nothing wrong with pepe but cuck is fucking cancer</br>  <br> Not ALL OKAY </br>  <br>Didnt cuck become a thing last year when those pics of moot came out?</br>  Which raw was the uncensored version again? It was tokyo-mx, right? All the raws I can find on Nyaa or TT are AT-X only though.  <br>tell that to the guystickinghindickinasnake.webM</br>  <br>Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a pair of tits for sale in this economy, much less a single left tit? And since it's illegal to kidnap random women and slice their boobs off, Zombina must have one hell of a time finding new ones. She has to save the pair she's stuck with.</br>  <br> tbh <br><br>Get out normie</br></br></br>  <br>Everyone always talking about Cathyl like her breasts are the only good part about her.<br><br>Personally I really like her buff bod.</br></br></br>  <br>Seems that today is the birthday of the VA of the best grill</br>  <br>I think it started slightly before that, the moot thing only added fuel to the fire</br>  <br>It was already a thing at the time.</br>  <br>I like both.</br>  <br> that tiny head </br>  Just for clarifications to the people who doesn't know.<br><br>Girls with normal vag:<br> miia <br> Papi <br> Rachnee <br> Polt <br> Mero <br> Lala <br> All the MON members <br><br>Girls without normal vag<br> HORSEPUSSY <br><br>Put your dick in a jelly pot<br> Suu </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So does she have different size tits? Are they both hers? Or someone else's?</br>  <br>Don't get me wrong, I love me some abs, too. But those tits are always nice.<br>Also as a person with a weakness for tall girls, the fact that an anon did the pixels-to-centimeters converter and found out that Cathyl is 8'6" including her horns pleases me greatly.</br></br>  <br>The Ending is far superior. Smith and Zombina's voice are sex<br><br>http://<span>youtu.be/amXiceqtTto  [ ]</br></br></br>   yes to Centorea-loyal, huge rack, devoted to you, horse pussy <br> yes to Papi - ass for days, easy to get along with, free eggs, not much for a talking, kinda dumb and forgetful <br> yes to Mero- a princess, moey and stuff, very gentle, I hope you like water in your life <br> yes to Rachne- DTF 24/7, free clothing, she'll be in charge, she won't do shit around the house, no faith in anyone, not even in you <br> yess to Miia- cute, loves to cuddle, will jump your bones for hours, probably break a couple, can take you to her village where you will drown in a dorito sea <br> yes to Suu- is like living with a trash compactor, floor cleaning, water purifier that can go from loli to Milf at will, not much of an eventful life here, more water in your life than with Mero <br> yes to Lala- Never die, can get fellatio under the table, detachable head for countless uses, probably will take part in her Chunii fantasies. <br>This is hard, but Miaa has the village thing, but then again Mero could have her servants fuck you and cuck herself or something. So Im divided between fish and snake pussy</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Too bad she's an UNFAITHFUL WHORE</br></br>  <br> yfw no matter how many kids you have with Miia or Rachnee the pussy will still be tight as fuck because they lay eggs from their monster half <br><br> yfw Papi's probably already stretched out as all fuck and has a roastie from laying all those unfertilised eggs </br></br></br>  Papi is best musume  Why does Suu look like a fucking serial killer in this?<br><br> Suu sounds exactly like I imagined her too, spooky </br></br>  <br> We most likely will but Bedford isn't going to be the one in charge. </br>  <br>Whenever it gets to Tio, I find myself imagining her trying to hold a tiny microphone daintily in her giant hands and spitting her verse while everybody else looks on in awe because let's face it- she slays on her verse.</br>  <br>Papi's rape face is best face.</br>  <br>Suu*<br> I should get more sleep </br></br>  <br>Papi has a bit of a rape face too, hers is more determined while Suu's is more unhinged.</br>  <br>Suu seems to be a complete psychopath though.<br><br>Maybe it's just Suu is kind of retarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Cow/ Horse doujin when?</br>  You know what the series needs? A crocodile girl. <br>That pussy be Interior Crocodile Alligator</br>  <br>How the fuck does Darling know about the sexual habits of garter snakes?</br>  <br>Suu is just insane, but papi is really determined.</br>  <br>I have and it was far from enjoyable, just awkward.</br>  <br> Only for a few chapters. After which he is now tasked with choosing one, marrying, and fuggin her so interracial relations can take another step. </br>  <br><br>Cheating slut</br></br>  Would you rather be raped by lolichickun or rapeslime?  <br>Rachnera mindbreaking Lilith doujin when?</br>  <br><br>rapeslime, chicken is too innocent</br></br>  <br>for hours on end</br>  <br> mama Miia forces you to go back to the village  <br> literally under a pile of snakes your whole life eating horrible food until you die  <br>Doesn't sound as fun as having just Miia as your waifu. I understand completely. <br>Doesn't change the fact that I want to have endless sex with her and just her though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Just as  said. Papi is fuggable imouto-tier.</br>  <br>She tried to rape Darling twice.</br>  <br>Nature documentaries? Maybe he actually opened a book in his entire life?</br>  <br>i learned about it in school so its not surprising<br><br><br>slime everyday</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>She's just vying for Darlings love, nothing carnal involved.</br></br>  <br>Papi is bestest.<br><br>Also Papi's mom is best mom.</br></br></br>  Reminder: You cant hate Suu  I want to take a bath with Suu. Or IN Suu.  <br> spend literally an hour trying to find the webm of a guy having sex with a snake <br> it's been taken off the archive </br></br>  <br>How does it feel to like dicks anon?</br>  <br>Yeah right</br>  How come harem protagonists never have any sex?  <br>It feels wonderful, you should know fag.</br>  How does one acquire an attraction to half-snake women?  <br> spending an hour looking for a /pol/ webm <br> expecting something like that posted over 12 hours ago to still be up </br></br>  Protip: If a snake constricts around you, what you need to do is grab the end of the tail and gently start unraveling it from there until the top. What Darling did was retarded and only caused Miia to constrict harder.  Ever wonder what Rachnee's mother is like?.....  <br>I dont see how one doesn't. Its all the cuddle potential of a snake combined with the will to cuddle of a human female, it is the ultimate creature.</br>  <br>I have the feeling  shes dead </br>  <br>How doesn't one?</br>  <br><br> ..... <br><br>anon, please</br></br></br></br>  <br>I imagine her as this kind and aloof oba san... My dick must impregnate.</br>  <br>How does one not? You may not be turned on by the swaying of a tail, but it certainly doesn't ruin the rest of her and adds an exotic feel. Only leg and ass men are left out.</br>  I have to say, when you're going through the show frame by frame, it really shows that it's a low budget production. I'm not sure the BDs will be worth the money even by typical animu BD standards. But anyway, here's a stitch. I'll probably do some more from the episode and then finish with the MON pans from the ED.<br><br><br>Darling wasn't an expert on snakes when Miia first came.

If you spend a lifetime with her, and then break her heart.</br></br>  best gir;  <br><br> tumblr </br></br>  <br>I guess the maid is cute. Not really best girl material though.</br>  With all the anime new people, can't wait until they see how spiteful and mean Miia can get.    <br> First you find a way to contain her, preferably a glass chamber or something. Next you capture Darling and Papi and proceed to create a torture chamber right in front of Suu so she has to watch everything. You start out slow, slight cuts at first on both, nothing too complex, remember to heal everything after a few days. Keep suu well hydrated and fed while starving Papi/Darling. Now after a few days is when things get spicy, You bring out bigger things, and you put the choice on Suu, she gets to chose which one you hurt keep it slow and gradually increase it things like chopping of the fingers wont work cause there'd be no pain left, but if you peel the skin off it has a better effect and it can be retried later, she'll want to chose Darling at first since he'd obviously be stronger. The first few times agree with her and keep it all on Darling, but you dont want to beat him up too hard. After that She'll be forced to do it to Papi too, breaking her psyche since she obviously cant be hurt physically. Keep this more and more (remember to take days off let them heal feed them well so that they start hoping that maybe maybe you'll stop so that when you start again itll be more intense)<br>Finally you reach the point where you make her have the final decision whom do you kill?After she made her choice you can feel free to let both of them go or kill the other one as well. </br> </br>  Is it wrong that I want the four MON grills to win the  Smith_  bowl?

Is like hentai but with worse plot and worse sex scenes.    Yeah this is pretty much just hentai version of dungeon keeper. The whole shit about kobold arriving and keeping elves and dwarves separated or they might both leave is so keeper it hurts.<br><br>Seriously the author could have just avoided making porn such integral part of this shit.</br></br>  <br>I'm just here for the dungeoneering and hero corruption.<br><br/></br></br>    <br>fin</br>  <br>He looks tired as fuck of that shit.</br>  <br>I found Adam and Himekishi far hotter, i wonder why.</br>  <br>Kek.

No rips yet.</br></br>  <br>But this shit doesn't exactly benefit at all from sexy times.<br><br><br>Well this is bloody dull so far porn or no porn. I couldn't care less about the porn. Dungeon keeper stuff is too shallow. Probably because the guy just shoves in porn all over.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Did he have some reason for making a dungeon? I forgot already.<br>Is he just a dungeon nerd?</br></br>  <br>To collect mana, and for protection.</br>  <br>I thought he wanted revenge or something.</br>  <br>I am looking forward to elf princess corruption. It was one of the best ones.</br>  <br><br>He wants to be the maou, maou's gotta have a dungeon, duh.</br></br>  This dude had sex with 17 named characters so far in the novels.<br><br>Nice to see his groin getting much exercice and all that but the story lacks tension, no worthy conflict whatsoever so far.</br></br>  <br>He wants that, he believes humanity is rotten to the core, the Dungeon is to exploit people's greed while he empowers himself, adventurers and the like will keep invading his territory, they will either die or become his servants.<br><br>It's a pragmatic revenge, till he plans something greater.</br></br></br>  <br>If i remember well the only time shit really got serious was against pic related</br>  <br> "bows? Don't feel like it." <br> "You get ten barrels of beer" <br> "Deal" </br></br></br>  <br>That's exactly what I would expect of the NotDwarves</br>  <br><br>What, does she betray him later on?</br></br>  <br> Yandere + slime body. But worry not cause there is a solution to every woman's tantrum <br> A magical dick </br></br>  <br><br>She's yandere?

Oh well guess if the admins are mad won't get banned now.  <br>Ramadan mubarak everyone</br>  <br><br>According to Salafists/Wahhabis (Fundamentalists), any representation of a living being is idolatry and sin. No one really knows that because Muslims are the biggest hypocrites on the planet. They have no understanding of how little of their faith is based in doctrine or how selective they are with interpretation. Really most just follow whatever Saudi Arabia or Iran tells them to believe. <br><br>When it comes to practicing it can get very odd because like Jews, Muslims often treat Islam as a part of their ethnicity. So everyone says they are as devout and strict in their interpretation as the Prophet's contemporaries while doing whatever the fuck they want at home. Very two-faced people.<br><br> Have to go to two aftars (breaking fast in the month of Ramadan) today. One is at an Interfaith meeting in a dining hall owned by an Indian, the other is in a shitty Paki restaurant. I'm helping organize a parade for Pakistani Independence Day this month. We built a mosque last year that cost over $3 million in the neighborhood, and I need to go their once a week for Friday service. Somehow I'm an atheist and hate people who want to censor criticism/mockery of the religion, but apparently a pillar of the community.  <br><br>I wish I didn't have to pretend I was a Muslim to be accepted.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the only time shit really got serious <br>Also doesn't Yunis  die  for a while in the WN? Not sure about the LN haven't checked it though but assume it's similar.</br></br>  <br> have to pretend I was a Muslim to be accepted. <br> living in a shithole where you need to act Muslim to get by <br>Move to a real country m8.</br></br></br>  <br> Real country <br> Amerigay <br> Defaulteurope </br></br></br>  <br><br>All better than Muslim shitholes, except Sweden because it is one.</br></br>  <br>You could try Canada.</br>  <br>He'd have to have some serious talents to be able to legally immigrate to west. Should just move to India and magically he'd have the same shit but with religious freedom.</br>  <br> Implying <br>Hop on a boat from Syria and say you're a refugee, they let fucking anyone in.</br></br>  <br>Salafists are only 5 to 10% of the Muslim population, why would the rest of the Muslims care what they claim is sin?</br>  <br> implying <br><br>We have fucking dialect experts to make sure niggers from wrong part of Somalia aren't able to get refuge here. It ain't that easy.</br></br></br>  <br>Because they fund like 90% of the mosques and durka schools around.</br>  How did you guys feel about naruto gaiden?  It was entertaining  fuck off  gateway manga of the worst kind  it was a fun ride  looks like Naruto is a damsel in distress this time<br>also Momo a trap</br>  <br>It made shipperfags upset and destroyed their fantasies.<br>It also made me like Sarada a fair bit.<br>Shame about the shitty villain and the story not actually being abot connections regardless blood like it was set up nor being a proper setup to the Bolt film.</br></br></br>  So sakura was the mother right?  <br>Yep.</br>  <br>unfortunately, it was pretty expected, but still</br>  <br>Nice, I've been calling it since the beginning but I was just replied with shitposting and with "sakura fag in denial" or something.</br>    <br>b-but we have new news, anon-kun, look here </br>  <br>Someone has to do it</br>  <br>But we can have threads about "armpit pussy" and countless of fate threads. If people want to discuss one of the most popular manga/anime ever created then just let them be. And there was new material to talk about which was gaiden. Even moot himself said naruto is fine.</br>  Hinata hasn't appeared, it's shit  <br>I was calling red herring at the beginning, though with the DNA evidence a combination of Occam's Razor and whishful thinking had me legit think Karin was the mother, especially with the connection/inheritance thing.<br> Still doesn't change the fact that Sasuke didn't give enough of a shit to be there at the birth, see them even once in 12 years or even kiss his wife. </br></br>  Why does naruto trigger /a/?<br><br>Its harmless</br></br>  <br>Because it's popular, but having hundreds of fate threads are fine.</br>  <br>They believe Naruto brings normies to /a/</br>  <br>She never concerned herself with Uhiha fucking shits. Why would she be involved at all?<br>Sending a bento via Bolt to Naruto was itself a bit of a bonus cameo.</br></br>  <br>She knew not to mess with Uchiha shits, Tobirama is proud of her.</br>  <br> Its <br><br>It clearly isn't.</br></br></br>  <br>Think about it. Just how? How?</br>  <br>shit</br>  <br>Actually, cancel that.<br><br>Normies find here anyway through just about any place on the interwebs. FROM ANYWHERE. They're bound to find here anyway and these people think one series makes any difference? Either major case autism or total bullshit on their part.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm not them so I have no clue.</br>  <br>It's funny because you find the same normies in Bleach and One Piece threads.</br>  <br>Bleach still gets threads?</br>  <br><br>was worth it for Dadruto and Sarada and I would read more of that if it didn't come with the stupid villains and the queen of cuck</br></br>  <br>Sakura being the mother wasn't even the issue.<br>The issue was how Sasuke, an asexual who always treated Sakura like a piece of shit on the bottom of his shoe, was able to procreate. Turkey baster is still the only thing that comes to mind.<br>Also Sakura still acts like a dog who hasn't been given it's treat yet.</br></br></br>  Who is hyped here?  <br>Was completely pointless with an asspull villain and overall went nowhere. The only major revelation was Kabuto still being alive, but even that felt like dues ex machina shit.</br>  <br><br><br>She's just not relevant, like in the other 700 chapters of the manga</br></br></br>  <br>The problem was had Kishimoto actually made Sakura not the mother, she would have been a better character, since for once she would have something selfless.</br>  <br>Not with that shitty animation. Seriously fuck the anime. My only hope lies in the Storm4 animation of that fight.</br>  <br>She's not involved in the Gaiden's story. If you seriously think she was irrelevant for the main manga, well you are plain wrong.</br>  <br>Hinata hasn't appeared most of the time in Naruto.</br>  <br>Based on what we've seen from each its gonna be ridiculous how far the game will outclass the anime, never mind the fact that we might get Kaguya in it before in the anime.</br>  <br>Besides doing her damn job as a medic the only good/selfless thing she did was push Hinata and Naruto in the Last, when she was written far more competently by someone else.</br>  <br> He fell for the ruse cruise. </br>  It was pretty horrible. <br>Also, what was the deal with Salad's paternity test showing that Karin was the mother but then Sakura was apparently the mother all along?</br>  <br>Anime brings normies to /a/</br>  <br>It's objectively bad.<br>It's like Twilight being discussed on /lit/ or Sucker Punch being discussed on /tv/.</br></br>  The fact that Oorochimaru is just allowed to open up a fucking orphanage that Naruto is cool with and even supports absolutely baffles me.<br>It was a clusterfuck of terrible writing, but that just topped the cake for me.</br>  <br>Even her becoming a medic was to fulfill her own desire to be not be useless. That is not an example of her being selfless.</br>  <br>Sakura either went after Sasuke while preggers or chased him down earlier, got pregnant, then the two split, but in either case she was wandering around 9 months pregnant in the middle of the wilderness.<br>Karin, who has moved on from the Sauce by the look of things/ust wants him to be happy found Sakura and helped her deliver her baby. As thanks Sakura gave the umbilicar cord to her. Suigetsu, presuming it was from Karin, tested it against Sarada.<br><br>Then once home Sakura made sure to make the whole thing hush-hush, and proceeded to keep silent about the woman who likely saved her own and her baby's life and plastered her face over hers to manufacture a family photo with Sausage.</br></br></br></br>  <br> the manga has been over for almost a year and the anime is still moving at a snails pace and churning out filler </br>  <br> becomes a medic <br> all she does is bitch and moan about not being a frontline fighter but support who has to hand back and heal people <br>Fucking cunt dig her own damn hole.</br></br></br>  <br>Orochimaru is running a science lab with Konoha keeping an eye on him. Given how he's too difficult to properly kill or contain, I can see some mutually beneficial arrangement coming in place.<br>Kabuto was the one who opened an orphanage, and he had his mind raped straight by Itachi, which seems to be good enough for Naruto. Yeah, that's pretty damn retarded.</br></br>  <br/>  <br> Momoshiki: <br><br> 透明な羽衣をかぶっているモモシキ。手のうらには輪廻眼らしきものあるよ<wbr>うだ。</wbr> <br><br> Momoshiki wears a transparent robe of feathers**. In the palms of the hands, there seems to be something like a Rinnegan.  <br><br> **Important note: 羽衣 (angel's raiment, robe of feathers) is given as a 'Hagoromo' in furigana. The same as in the The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter that Kaguya was inspired from (the Hagoromo she was given that wiped away her memories of the Earth when she was taken by the celestial moon people), and the derived name of Ootsutsuki Hagoromo. <br><br> Kinshiki: <br><br> 体格が大きいキンシキ。フード隠された顔には、巨大な角のようなものが生<wbr>えている。</wbr> <br><br> Kinshiki has a large physique. Under the hood that conceals his face, there seems to be something like a huge horn that's growing. <br><br> Boruto: モモシキとキンシキ？負ける気がしねェ！！ <br><br> Momoshiki and Kinshiki? I don't feel like I'll lose!! <br><br> 新たな敵…モモシキとキンシキ登場！！ <br><br> The new enemies...Momoshiki and Kinshiki have appeared!! <br><br> ボルトの前に立ちはだかる新たな敵の名は、モモシキとキンシキ！原作者・<wbr>岸本斉史先生のラス画を特別公開。 果たして、どんな敵なのか…！？</wbr> <br><br> The names of the enemies who are blocking the way in front of Boruto are Momoshiki and Kinshiki! It's a special release of the sketch from the author: Masashi Kishimoto. What kind of enemy did you expect...!? <br><br><br> Boruto: Momoshiki and Kinshiki? I don't feel like I'll lose!! <br><br>Even Bort knows these two are complete and utter jobbers. Can't even intimidate a fucking 12 year-old.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was fun. Terrible, but fun. It was nice to see that the two worst characters made best girl.</br>  <br>Bad memories. Most of the old Narutards have moved onto shit like SnK.</br>  <br>It was fun until the ending, it felt like it just shat on everything by giving half-assed responses with things like Sakura being the mother and all the clones.</br>  <br> dat chibi Bort and Sunflower <br>Looks like someone finally remembered she exists.</br></br>  <br>And shit like Raildex. But no one will here will admit that that is just as bad as Naruto.</br>  <br>Anime's shit. SP devoted their budget to animating the Bort movie. Storm 4 is our only hope now.</br>  This would be the best story behind Sarada  <br>shit shit SHIT</br>  <br>Karin would have certainly made a better mother. That's for damn sure.</br>   Naruto:"He is different from my old self...." <br> Sasuke:"Ok...you'll be my student." <br> Boruto:"It's different from my father's lame era" <br> Sarada:"I'll become Hokage!" <br> Mitsuki:"But I appreciate that you respect my parent/s too".(I'm not really sure about this one). <br><br>Who wants to bet it's either Sister Snake or Netori?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Obito und Madara look like fookin retards  <br>Toneri doomed himself to solitude, the portal between Earth and the moon was destroyed.</br>  <br>Karin had a lot of potential before forgiving Sauce and cementing herself as an obsessive joke character.</br>  <br>Sasuke has issues, but he was never been an asexual and he has never treated Sakura like that. He treated Karin like that.</br>  <br> implying he didn't TnJ him into coming back and then act as his wingman until he got hitched <br><br><br>One of the things I liked about the Gaiden is how she actually matured. She's infinitely better than Pink Shit now. At least Karin grew up.<br><br><br> Their faces remind me of that one retarded kid from South Park. The evil one with the speech impediment. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sasuke's average conversation to Sakura.<br><br> You're annoying <br> You're weak <br> Why do you even like me? <br> Yeah...Sorry <br><br>He treats her like a dog, tries to kill her, and worst of all he even questions why she keeps coming back for more.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Still doesn't change the fact that Sasuke didn't give enough of a shit to be there at the birth <br><br>He was. Read the Viz translation. Sasuke was with Sakura when Sarada was born.</br></br></br>  <br>Assblastedly hilarious. The reactions were gold.</br>  <br>He's a sadist and she's a masochist. It's a match made in heaven.</br>  <br>I'm not even sure you can call him a sadist when he makes it clear that he doesn't want to be around her.</br>  <br>There were some fun times.</br>  <br> Implying Sarada would be better with to moms </br>  <br>Sasuke consistently acts in a way that broadcasts the fact that he has essentially no sex drive, and is annoyed by the advances of all his fangirls.<br>He ridiculed Kakashi by likening him to Sakura, and told her that her feelings for him are a baseless love fantasy.<br>He acted disturbed when Karin kept coming onto him, but did hand-pick her for her skills and mastered his black flame thingie to save her ass. He pretty much tolerates her so long as she could pull her weight, see him getting rid of her when she got taken hostage.</br></br></br>  <br>Sakura will always be Sasuke's abused, but loyal pet dog that he never plays with.</br>  <br> Salad gets two tacos <br> Burrito gets two wieners <br>pottery</br></br></br>  <br>At least one of them would be a sane women who doesn't destroy their house when she's upset.</br>  <br>She was silent because she sneaked in Sasuke's dangerous secret mission that Sarada couldn't know. At least from what I understood it, she was stressed over this.</br>  <br>Didn't she once took a knife to the gut for an old lady she had just met?</br>  <br> implying the best outcome wouldn't be pic related </br>  <br>Regardless of how it ended, the threads were absolutely hilarious.</br>  <br>?</br>  <br> but in either case she was wandering around 9 months pregnant in the middle of the wilderness <br> gee I miss Sasuke <br> which is why I better leave the village and go out into the wilderness with no escort or means of calling for help if something should happen risking the life of my unborn child who could literally fall out of my cooch at any moment <br> what a responsible mother I am <br>I'd call this impossibly retarded, but no, it's actually perfectly in-character for Pink to act this way.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Wasn't Chiyo also a foreign dignitary and the only one who could defeat that akatsuki member (his name escapes me). Besides that's a mild inconvenience, considering that she could easily heal herself from it.</br>  <br>I like Madara, but Obito does look retarded. In that particular picture his head is all lop-sided.</br>  <br>The one with the glasses. <br><br><br>Honestly, the movie seems pretty straightforward and probably won't have any fun twists or turns like the Gaiden. This may have been our last chance to laugh with/at Nurudu. <br><br>And that kinda makes me sad.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> the movie seems pretty straightforward and probably won't have any fun twists or turns like the Gaiden <br> doesn't know about Cakegate </br></br>  <br>I barely recall anything about the show. Aren't the only retarded kids in it Timmy and Jimmy?</br>  <br>Don't forget<br> look this woman helped me to deliver my baby and saved my life which I endangered due to my own stupidity <br> I'm going to not tell my daughter anything about her and I'm going to tape my face over her's in the only photo I have of Sasuke. </br></br></br>  <br>Chiyo wasn't just some old lady, was Sasori's grandma and also the only reason Sakura survived against most of his tricks.</br>  <br>It was meh at best and shit at worst, but what really made it fun for me was how /a/ reacted to it</br>  <br>I only remember him because he'd always have this gag with a big fat one named Mimsy.</br>  <br>And join the family that produced this asshole?</br>  <br>Is Kishi trying to make Sakura the most hated woman in manga?</br>  <br>sarada's gonna fight the girl.</br>  <br>see<br><br> doesn't even share his fries with his dad <br>Worse than Hitler.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Aside from all arguements about him having no sex drive, lets stick to the only way he does show affection, which is apparently that forehead poke thing. <br><br>In the last chapter of Gaiden, he showed that he apparently felt something for Salad by giving her the poke, and Sakura just stood there like a dog that was begging for affection. Sasuke looks her dead in the face and turns away without even saying anything. If that doesn't prove he doesn't give a shit about Sakura, I don't know what does</br></br></br>  <br>Boruto is in his tryhard phase where he thinks that being edgy is cool.</br>  <br>That's not really a twist, just a low point to show off the big problem that will get resolved. Straightforward.<br>Shame the fist-bump scene got spoiled.</br></br>  <br> sarada's gonna fight the girl. <br>Sarada is not going to be part of the rescue mission. Its just the Five Kages+Sasuke+Bort</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sure and Boruto is really Sakura's and Naruto's son.<br><br>Please fuck off with your shipping.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do most kids even know the identity of the person who delivered them?</br>  <br> baby's first tsundere </br>  <br> girl </br>  <br>I dunno, Sarada seems so far to be the best behaved next gen kid and her only problem with Pink is that she hugs too hard</br>  <br>Kishi said he was surprised by Sakura's unpopularity and that a little girl once told him she hated Sakura. His response was to try and draw Sakura prettier. <br>Kishi view of females is shallow and it shows through Sakura.</br></br>  <br> Shame the fist-bump scene got spoiled <br> implying he's not a ghost </br></br>  <br> Implying women aren't shallow 99% of the time </br>  <br>Holy shit karin was kinda mature and cool in gaiden</br>  <br>I know the name of the nurse who delivered me since they also named me.<br><br>And besides that Karin essentially saved Sakura and Sarada's life.</br></br></br>  I just remembered that Karen was an Uzumaki. What the hell was the point of that? She wasn't connected to Naruto in any significant way.<br><br> Salad was an Uchiha/Haruno that looked like an Uzumaki </br></br>  <br>Tsundere would actually have to imply that Sasuke gives a shit about her. He doesn't. He's just disinterested.</br>  <br> being this defensive <br>SShit pls</br></br>  <br>We know Sasuke can smile and yet I don't remember him smiling during that family dinner or portrait. It felt like he was only there for Sarada's sake.</br>  <br>I'm still a little sore about that to be honest. Kishi's trying to build them up as rivals but Salad's gonna get shafted in the movie and her dream of being Hokage will never be taken seriously.<br><br>That and I'd like to see some teamwork between these two. Who knows - maybe Kishi will surprise us by bringing his full suite of SN POTTERY instead of just Bort and his two daddies?</br></br></br>  <br>He wasn't surprised by her unpopluarity (he's known about it for a while). He was just surprised by the level of dislike that she got.<br><br>He's been aware of the fact that she's shit for a while.</br></br></br>  <br> Naruto <br> Dying </br></br>  <br>He does, though. You're just so salty to acknowledge it.</br>  <br>I don't deny the tsun, but when has Sasuke ever acted dere towards Sakura?</br>  <br> and her only problem with Pink is that she hugs too hard <br> implying she's not trying to kill her </br></br>  <br>I can't wait for edgy Himawari when hormones kick in. Hinata obviously sucks as a mother.</br>  <br> Guy attempts to kill girl multiple times. <br> tells her to fuck off multiple times <br> h-he's just a tsundere <br><br>This is how SxSfags think a relationship should be.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> and that a little girl once told him she hated Sakura </br>  <br>Sakurahaters ruined the threads, don't bother to reason with them. They are still mad Naruto got cucked.</br>  <br> Salad was an Uchiha/Haruno that looked like an Uzumaki <br><br>She looks like an Uchiha.</br></br></br>  <br> holy shit you actually don't remember that time when i mistook you for naruto and shit talked orphans evne tho you're one and then you call me annoying <br> i was just pretending to be retarded, you're REALLY annoying <br> sakura then creamed herself and sasuke gave her the P </br></br></br>  <br> he dies <br> Bort begins his quest to find the 7 Ninja Balls to bring him back <br> it never ends </br></br></br>  <br>The real reason she looks like Karin is that Kishi just made a female Sauce without remembering that that's exactly the same thing he did with Karin.<br>Then when people asked about it, he welcomed the new plot idea to his bosom.</br></br>  <br>Actually all they seem to care about is sex. You should have seen how quickly they disowned Salad as soon as the DNA test showed up.</br>   if Shizune actually bothered to say "Oh, your mother just gave birth outside of the village and was helped by a common friend of her and Sasuke", none of this shit would have happened <br><br>Konoha ninjas are kinda stupid.</br></br>  <br> Bort didn't get a Byakugan because now only the villains get Byakugans </br>  <br>Sakurafags still mad that their self-insert is a pathetic excuse for a person.<br><br>Tell me does the fact that Naruto married a girl who is more attractive than Sakura and porked her before Sakura got together with Sasuke still rile you up? Or the fact that Sakura is homeless and forever alone, with Sasuke not giving a shit about her?</br></br></br>  <br>Other than glasses Sarada looks like Sasuke+Sakura.</br>  <br>Everyone in the Gaiden had a go with the Idiot Ball.</br>  <br>Does Sakura even have fans that aren't just using Sakura as a self-insert?</br>  <br> I'm still a little sore about that to be honest. <br>I'm not. We already got the Gaiden full of Sarada's shit<br> Kishi's trying to build them up as rivals but Salad's gonna get shafted in the movie <br>Because Kishi is either:<br>a) a hack<br>b) cant break his own formula<br>The Gaiden and the movie should've been about the new gen kids doing shit, with the adults making a cameo or two, not the shit we got in the gaiden, with "muh team 7" taking the lead and Sarada (and chocho) tagging along<br> her dream of being Hokage will never be taken seriously. <br>We will never see anyone else as Hokage, Naruto will be the last one. Sarada "I want to be hokage" shit is just something to contrast Bort edgy character</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Momo is a faggot but I kinda like Kin.<br> inb4 barafag </br></br>  <br>calm the fuck down, silly shipper, you have mistaken /a/ for tumblr</br>  <br> They are still mad Naruto got cucked <br> this is what SSfags actually believe </br></br>  <br>Hamura was a good man.</br>  <br> this projecting </br>  <br>SScunts still buttmad that Hinata was the heroine of the movie and got a passionate kissing scene whereas their self-insert couldn't even get so much as a poke after decades.</br>  <br>At least they're not trying to marry her this time. <br><br>Her husband, on the other hand...</br></br></br>  <br>Hate? <br><br>More like feel incredibly bad for.</br></br></br>  <br>And until he shows up to be Bort's spirit animal like Hagoromo did with Naruto, only the villains will get Byakugans. Hell, even if he does show up, he'll just show up with a Tenseigan.</br>  <br>Don't be blaming muh waifu! <br><br>This is all on the girl who could even remember if Sauce wore glasses or not. Also, it would have been rude for Shizune to talk about it behind pink's back...muh waifu has class and doesn't do stuff like that.</br></br></br>  <br> We will never see anyone else as Hokage, Naruto will be the last one. <br>So much this. I can't see a legit part III happening.</br></br>  <br>Sasuke is too much of an asshole to openly show affection to anyone, even everything he said about Naruto in 698 &amp; 699 was an internal monologue.<br><br>For fucks sake it took the most adorable character in the Naruto universe to get him to hug.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want you and your kind to get the fuck out from here. Shippers are the cancer of this fanbase.</br>  <br>exactly, we don't get normies because people who give a shit about bleach are so scarce<br>It's nice</br></br>  <br>Actually, they're pretty butthurt they can't use Nurudu as the useless third wheel pathetically pining for Sakura anymore.<br><br>They are truly pathetic people. Which is why you should stop arguing with them.</br></br></br>  <br> I can't see a legit part III happening <br> he doesn't know that Nurudu prints money <br>It'll be the next DBZ. Just watch.</br></br></br>  <br> claims that someone else is a shipper <br> is the only one trying to argue for his ship <br><br>SxSfag who do you think you're fooling?</br></br></br></br>  <br>No, he didn't get it because neither Naruto nor Sasuke have it.</br>  <br>OP is next DB<br>Naruto will be the next Saint Seiya with multiple spin-off by different authors.</br></br>  <br>I could see SP doing some form of continuation or Last-era story but not Kishi himself.</br>  <br> Naruto Super </br>  <br> Not even a word about ships <br> Y-you're just like me! I can't be the only one this pathetic <br>Whatever makes you happy.</br></br></br>  <br>Honestly I wouldn't mind a little filler if they decide to animate the Gaiden. Just so we can see what everyone else is doing amidst the Uchiha Maury-tier drama.</br>  <br>Kishi pls.</br>  <br> Naruto will be the next Saint Seiya with multiple spin-off by different authors. <br>Also Kurumada (Saint Seiya author) and Kishimoto seem to have a hard-on for "muh paralulz!!"<br>I actually would like that, anyone that could write better than Kishi (which is not hard) should be in charge of this series, so much wasted potential.</br></br></br>  <br> this level of projection <br>The only person whose been talking about ships is you picking out one post of many while trying to defend SxSfaggotry.<br><br>I'm legitimately laughing at you.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Naruto isn't as popular as it used to be. Sure they're going to make tons of films but my point is that we ain't gonna see Sarada's Susanoo etc.</br>  <br>Sure, calling you and your kind out for being cancerous is defending that ship. Makes sense.</br>  <br><br><br>Even if there is a part III, it still would not end with anyone other than Naruto in the Hokage seat.</br></br></br>  <br> this projecting <br><br>Anon you're just embarrassing yourself now.</br></br></br>  <br>Gotta hand it to Kishi unlike Toriyama he really knows how to kill his own series.<br><br>That war arc tired the fuck out of everyone.</br></br></br>  <br> ain't gonna see Sarada's Susanoo <br>Good, she really should not get beyond the eventual three tomoe sharingan and instead get something of her own (please no medic jobbing).</br></br>  <br> (please no medic jobbing) <br> implying Pink Shit 2.0 will be anything other than a healslut </br></br>  <br>Anyone defending Sakura is shipping cancer because no one likes Sakura except shipperfags. <br>Everyone else doesn't give a fuck if people shit on characters.</br></br>  <br> Miko Susanoo. <br>UCHIHAS UP IN FLAMES<br>GOD BLESS TOBIRAMA.</br></br></br>  <br>You know, as a kid I always wanted to see a character who could into Chidori and Rasengan. <br><br>I just never thought that it'd be Nurudu's fucking son who does it.</br></br></br>  <br>What are you talking about I never defended that shit? You're the one who tried to defend it.</br>  <br>Yeah, the War Arc caused a huge drop in popularity for Naruto, and rightfully so, it was incredibly bad.</br>  <br> I always wanted to see a character who could into Chidori and Rasengan <br> what is Kakashi </br></br>  <br>It's much to late for that, it was over the minute she went hulk smash.</br>  <br>At least it was as bad Bleach.<br>Naruto never really dropped from the top tier in the ranking</br></br>  <br>I really don't know what he was thinking with the whole war thing.<br>It didn't address anything that's wrong with war besides 'people on our side (good guys) died'. He could feasibly have pulled something interesting, with the war being waged between nations with actual people on both sides, with small fights fit for ninjas, with a series of timeskips to show off the attrition of it all. <br>Or something other than three years of killing plant people clones and zombies of previously interesting characters brought back from the dead, all of which happened over the course of like two days in-manga.</br></br></br>  <br>Madara was our beacon in the storm but even he couldn't hold back the tide of sewage that was about to be dumped on everyone and everything.</br>  <br>Are you mentally handicapped? I didn't even mention Sakura. I just want you to find a better place for discussing ships (tumblr).</br>  <br>She doesn't look like Karin. She looks like her dad with glasses because Kishi faps to sasuce.</br>  <br>No thanks. I'm having too much fun trashing Sakura and her shitty ships right here.</br>  <br>Then your reading comprehension is shit. The only one defending the SxS shit was you.</br>  <br>It depends on how long this shit runs and if Bort is going to stay as the official SasuNaru kid.</br>  <br>I think he meant at the same time. As in combined.</br>  <br> Kishi faps to sasuce. <br><br> Boruto is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke <br> Sarada is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura <br><br>Kishi really loves that edgy bastard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>true cancer of naruto threads.</br></br>  <br>The war arc was just pointless and unnecessary. The War arc and Uchiha shit killed the manga, and I find that shit funny.</br>  <br>Before we found out her hair was red, everyone thought Karin was a female version of Sasuke.</br>  <br> Boruto is a combination of Naruto and Sasuke <br>He isn't, he's just a copy of Naruto, he has nothing of Sasuke in him</br></br>  <br>Ignore them. It's impossible to argue with that kind of people.</br>  <br> Himawari isn't a combination of Sauce so she's forever fodder </br>   focuses on kids <br> Chuunin Exams <br> fewer characters to give screentime <br> no Uchiha DARKNESS <br> Salad <br> Dadruto <br> Metal fucking Lee <br> a new technique and a chance for Sauce to not be a complete piece of shit <br> theme by KANA BOON <br> good director <br> co-written by Gaara Hiden author <br><br> retarded ayylien bullshit <br> Rinnegan <br> somewhat unlikable protagonist  <br> high chance of everyone but Bort and his two daddies getting shafted <br> Kishi's most heavily involved project <br> including head writer <br><br>Is there hope, /a/?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It stinks</br>  <br>Yes, because the Naruto series is such a masterpiece it deserves only the most refined and in depth discussion.</br>  <br>Is this baby's first time on a Naruto thread on /a/? Is baby unhappy that no one likes their shitty ship and characters?</br>  Who on gods green earth decided it was a good idea to trust Kabuto with children?<br><br>There wasn't even sorry no jutsu involved</br></br>  <br>Wel, Hinata is proto-female sasuke.</br>  <br>Kishi doesn't fap to Sasuke, he faps to his doujins of him and Sasuke.</br>  <br><br><br><br>Holy fucking shit,it sure is summer.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If Sakura represents the view kishi has of women, he must think they are shallow bitches.<br><br>I wonder if kishi actually likes Sakura himself.</br></br></br>  <br>He has chidori and Sasuke's headband.</br>  <br> She doesn't look like Karin <br><br><br> drawing up Salad <br> design gets approved <br> start drawing panels for the manga <br> wait a second <br> this kid looks just like Karin <br> fuck <br> o-oh well m-maybe nobody will notice <br> chapter 700 comes out <br> holy shit this kid looks just like Karin <br> maybe Karin's the real mom <br> Sauce isn't even around <br> fuck <br> wait a second <br> this gives me an idea for a spinoff <br> Naruto Gaiden happens <br>Pretty much.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Is there hope, /a/? <br>No<br><br> He has chidori <br>He isnt, he has a lightning based rasengan<br> Sasuke's headband <br>Only at the end of the movie, during the final confrontation.<br>Personality wise he is nothing like Sasuke, he has nothing of him</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He has admitted that she was a terrible human being, and she also is worst girl.</br>  <br> I wonder if kishi actually likes Sakura himself. <br><br>If he didn't he wouldn't have had one of the two relevant next gen kids be a combination of her and sauce.</br></br></br>  <br> Sarada is a combination of Sasuke and Sakura <br>The shame will never wash off.</br></br>  <br>It's okay, he's been brainwashed.</br>  <br>He said he liked her a number of times. Because he's his most realistic character.<br><br>You're taking out of context what he said about the fail confession.</br></br></br>  <br> He isnt <br> learns a Chidori thing from Sauce <br> later on combines it with Rasengan to kill fusion Momo and Kin </br></br></br>  <br>He's said that he's liked her a number of times, but he has also admitted that she was shit a number of times too.</br>  <br>Blue kid keeps confusing me because he looks increadibly Gaara. Is he the child of an existing couple like everyone else or is he new?</br>  I miss best character. thankfully Kishi didnt revive him as to rape his character into oblivion.<br><br> Dont give me that bullshit like Kabuto couldnt reach Jirayia for Edo Tensei. Hiruzen seald Hashirama and Tobirama in the Reaper Death Seal, which was supposed to make sure they never appeared again. Hell Hiruzen and Minato also got absorbed by the Reaper Death Seal.....yet ALL FOUR OF THEM came back. </br></br>  For fucks sake i really wanted ninja storm 4 to be the last, definitve game, but now you just know they'll make more using material from the gaiden manga and movies. FFFFFF.  <br> but now you just know they'll make more using material from the gaiden manga and movies <br> what is DLC </br></br>  <br>where in the fuck do you see a chidori in that gif? do you remember what a chidori looks like?</br>  <br>It would be nice to think they'd just add shit with DLC, but they won't.</br>  <br>Is Ninja Storm more popular than the series itself?</br>  <br>Kishimoto actually made both a good character and a riveting plot, but jobbed both of them as he's wont to do.<br><br>Any news on Sarada's moveset?</br></br></br>  <br>We don't know who his parents are. Considering it's a Kishi-tier mystery, it'll be something retardedly obvious like Kabuto/Orochimaru/Toneri. <br><br>I mean, for fuck sakes the kid has pale skin, white hair, yellow eyes and can stretch his body. He's also the perfect Orochimaru pottery to neo Team 7, who are basically the next generation of Sannin.</br></br></br>  <br>No, but it's better. The best thing about Naruto is the characterts,the plot is shit, but the characters and jutsus make for a fun fitan game.</br>  <br>Obito didn't want Kabuto to become that powerful, so he probably retrieved Jiraiya and Konan's corpses for... medical curiosity.</br>  <br> I wonder if kishi actually likes Sakura himself. <br>He left her hanging and made her daughter look more like Karin then her. He always trashes her after giving her a moment to shine.<br>If anything, he loves to use her as a punching bag and the butt of the joke.</br></br></br>  <br>Kishi really missed his calling just being a character designer.</br>  <br> what are Chidori variants <br>Bort probably doesn't learn the vanilla version because no Sharingan. <br><br>Think, stupid. It's not his special move because the sky's blue and he's wearing his black/magenta outfit and not his POTTERY one. Obviously he'll use the combined version against the big bad for the finale.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked cho cho.</br>  <br>Remember when he took all of Naruto's hard earned money and spent it all on ninja prostitutes?<br> <br>Or when he only started giving a shit about his "godson" when he seduced him with his female form?<br><br>Or how he spent 3 years with him and never told him shit about the parents who loved him and died to save him?<br><br>Or how he threw him into a ravine and hoped he didn't die?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Because she's acting "real", he likes her character.</br>  <br> Any news on Sarada's moveset? <br>Nigga, she punches things. Probably a clone of Sakura with some minor Sharingan tech and maybe a Katon or two. <br><br><br>Actually, characters from both The Last and Boruto are pre-order incentives so there's a good chance the movies will be released as DLC packs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> inb4 doujins of trap momoxmitsukixbolt </br>  <br>To be fair the actual universe is pretty nice too<br><br>I mean you give me an mmo<br>Where I can make my own ninja<br>Where I can pick his clan and his fighting style and his jutsu<br>Where I burn through the ranks from a child soldier to a legitimate spy/sassin in the middle of a centuries long blood feud between all the villages<br><br>I will eat that shit up<br>Of course I guess it would be a bit stale having my powers be fairly generic and similar to everyone else s instead of being able to gradually turn my body into a string puppet or vomit paper tags</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Obito didn't want Kabuto to become that powerful <br>But he let him revive fucking Madara, thus ruining the whole ruse they'd created for some retarded reason?</br></br>  <br> what are Chidori variants <br>Something we never saw? Its easier to suppose that he's using a new technique.<br>In any case, a technique doesnt mean anything. He still doesnt have anything of Sasuke in him, he is 100% a Naruto clone</br></br></br>  <br>Well shit, better make sure I pre order on steam when this goes up.</br>  <br> He always trashes her after giving her a moment to shine. <br>To be fair he does tend to do that with a lot of characters. Hinata always has something uplifting/good about her character shining through, then it gets fucked lest it become inevitable that she makes some progress with Naruto in the main manga.<br>Supporting cast tend to get introduced with a bit of fanfare and something that might even be interesting, then they get starved for development as Kishi makes a new supporting character to get to the next plot point.</br></br></br>  <br>He called her character the epitome of human weakness. He is well aware of the fact that she's shit, in fact she was mean to be that way.<br><br>Hence why none of the other female characters are as shit as she is.</br></br></br>  <br>That is a cool idea but the problem is, everyone just ends up using the same OP moveset just like they do in DB Xenoverse.</br>  <br> Or how he spent 3 years with him and never told him shit about the parents who loved him and died to save him? <br>Well he couldn't even remember Kushina's name in shippuden. <br><br>Also I believe jiraiya was looking into orochimaru and the akatsuki while nardo was being bullied by the village so kishi will probably try to spin that as jiraiya trying to protect naruto by keeping an eye on orochimaru and his cronies. In the end it was just dumb to make him naruto's godfather, kishi should have just left that out.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If not even the girls who read his manga liked Sakura, then his 'real' portrayal was shit.</br>  <br>I hope we get to see the skinnier version. I like me some slim chocolate.</br>  <br>I agree, when do you go back to school?</br>  <br>That's different other characters get pushed to the sidelines because they're irrelevant side characters. Sakura gets pushed the sidelines violently because she's shit.</br>  <br>Friendly reminder that Sauce is going to be the most successful teacher in Nurudu.</br>  <br> so there's a good chance the movies will be released as DLC packs <br>Revolution didn't come out that much before The Last yet there was no such tie-in. To my knowledge the studio hasn't done an expansion like that before, they tend to just make up new costumes, sell it for £10 and call it a day.</br></br>  <br>So he pulled a Sasuke before that was even a thing?<br><br>At least Sarada didn't have to seduce Sasuke to get him to pay attention to her.</br></br></br>  <br>I hope we get both. I like chubby characters but I have a feeling cho cho'd be pretty hot slim.</br>   post yfw Kishimoto starts a new manga like Mario   hello there. this breads seems good enough to ask...<br>one of the guys, i know, is insisting that i should watch shippuuden but i hate waiting one week for each episode. since manga is finished i'd like to ask how far is the anime compared to manga and what's the estimated number of episodes left<br>i googled a bit but all such questions are few months old so yeah</br></br>  <br> Something we never saw? <br> what is literally everything Sasuke was doing up until MS </br></br>  <br> Naruto, the mmo <br>It's a cool idea but imagine the community.</br></br>  <br>Not really, Boruto was already a genius and had the access to the knowledge of high level jutsu. He's not teaching him from scratch.</br>  <br>Narutards really are cancer.<br><br>Just checking the filenames and you can see that it is the same samefags spamming their shit threads,</br></br></br>  <br> Gets his hand on a kid that's a fucking prodigy <br> Kid turns out to be pretty badass <br> "Yep, I am the best teacher, me the sauce" <br> "D-dad is that you?" <br> *Teleports* </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Have some more Boruto x Mitsuki instead</br>  <br> implying <br>He probably wanted Sakura to be likable and then made up some bullshit about weakness when people started hating her guts.<br><br><br>Fatty's on the box so you're getting both. She'll probably slim up in her battle against Mitsuki.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Sakura is supposed to be the female protagonist, not just a side-character. Yet, she is never given the same importance that Naruto and Sasuke have. Kishi had her constantly wanting to be on their level, but it never happened. She also never had her own character arc.</br>  <br>It couldnt be any worse than DBXenoverse with all the edgy Saiyians and Namekians</br>  <br> Salad doing the Obito laugh </br>  <br>He said that she was the epitome of human weakness before her popularity took a nose dive. Face it she was meant to be shit, he just wanted her to be liked regardless of that shit. In a way it worked but not in the way he hoped.</br>  <br> At least Sarada didn't have to seduce Sasuke to get him to pay attention to her. <br>Don't be an idiot, Jiraiya gave way more attention to naruto than sauce ever did and will do to Salad.</br></br>    <br>I hear he finished that. Was it any good?</br>  <br>So based.</br>  <br>And the Gohans.<br><br>All the fucking GOHANs</br></br></br>  <br>Oh, so he made a throwing chidori?<br>My second point still stands, 100% Naruto clone</br></br>  <br>It's over.</br>  <br> Probably a clone of Sakura with some minor Sharingan tech and maybe a Katon or two. <br>Anon pls. This is the last step to confirm how much of a jobber she is.</br></br>  <br> 100% Naruto clone <br> doesn't act anything like his father </br></br>  <br><br>Didn't they announce Naruto Online last year?</br></br>  <br>Depends on what you prefer I guess, edgy saiyans or edgy uchihas. I was mostly thinking the game would have a community of people that actually think the manga is good.</br>  <br>why not both?</br>  <br>I'd prefer a single-play RPG, something in the style of Jade Empire, just with more customisation and a more refined system.</br>  <br> What is chidori nagashi? </br>  <br> or edgy uchihas <br> all the countless Mary Sue nothin personnel kid Uchiha OCs it would no doubt create </br></br>  <br>bump for spoonfeeding</br>  <br>Sakura could have been redeemed if she had her own character arc and goals and motivations outside m-muh Team 7. Also could have shown her family and relationships with other characters like Ino or Lee to make her more likable.</br>  <br>Its a one shot.</br>  No coolest guy, no Madara, no Ninja Hitler, barely any homolust.<br>3/10, because shipping wars</br>  <br>He neither acts like Sasuke</br>  <br> I just realized there are people who love the sharingan and think its awesome <br> Oh it's got even more powers that's so cool! <br><br> I actually liked it back when it just copied powers and enhanced reaction speed. Mega man uchiha would be the coolest guy </br></br></br></br>  <br>Nobody ever said he did. If anything he's more reminiscent of Neji with a duller edge.</br>  <br>Kamui was cool. Imbalanced as all hell, but cool</br>  <br>I can see it<br> Himawari: SHE WAS THE COOLEST GAL. </br></br>  <br> I actually liked it back when it just copied powers and enhanced reaction speed <br>I liked it up to MS because every one was unique with its own design. But then shit got stupid with Susanoo and Rinnegan and everyone just sorta lost sight (unintentional) of the plot.</br></br>  <br><br>The anime is fucking trash and absolutely unwatchable. Read the manga or wait a few years for a reboot without fillers.<br><br>Right now the Anime really has turned into a clusterfuck of fillers.<br><br>A few years ago there was a ballance in it at least. Two cannon arcs, one filler arc, two cannon arcs and so on. But now it is literally random pre time skip filler episodes inbetween fights EVERY FUCKING MONTH so there is absolutely no way to watch the anime without this stupid interruptions. <br><br>Manga ended on volume 72, the anime is in the end of volume 69 right now.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Why is /a/ so obsessed with Sakura? She's almost all that's talked about in these threads. Are you guys really this mad about a single character?     Burrito movie filler 1 hour special <br> The Thing That Was Inherited  <br> it's about Nurudu teaching Konohamaru the Rasengan <br> who then most likely teaches it to Boruto </br></br></br>  <br>  If they hate her enough no one will know of the huge boner they had for her in middle school. </br>  <br>For a lot of us she was our first experience of how shit women are.</br>  <br>i was expecting some fillers but not this many...<br>anyway: thx for the info</br></br>  <br>This sounds about right.<br><br>So she actually caused you pain in your life? Some people act like she killed their puppy or something.</br></br></br>  <br> changing stages is a game mechanic <br>mite b cool <br><br>So that's why they've incorporated the new elemental system.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's fun to talk about characters you hate and despise, it's just venting.</br>  <br> barely any homolust <br>That was weird, you'd expect a roadtrip between Naruto and Sasuke to have more of it. Instead Naruto is too concerned about Sarada not thinking her dad is the coolest guy and Sasuke is too concerned about killing Shin and saving his kid's babysitter to give a shit about each other.<br><br>Let's just hope it stays that way for "Bort has two dads, The Movie"</br></br></br></br>  <br>I've said this before, I'll say it again: she is like Wesley Crusher/Neelix or Jar Jar Binks, but with malicious selfish bitchiness instead of retarded self-important antics or being a bland wonderchild.</br>  <br> 1 hour of Rasengan <br>Jesus, at least give the supporting cast a chance.<br><br>I want to see Sarada trying to find modest clothing in her house<br>Shikadai getting his shit pushed in at Shogi<br>Inojin being confused about the mind control stuff<br>Chou trying to jew food and snacks from her mom</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> So she actually caused you pain in your life? <br>No, but for me it just kinda clicked one day that she was a terrible human being.</br></br>  I think the mods are pretty cool for allowing Nuruto generals and banning loli threads at the same time.  Why didn't Kishi take the whole "Karin is Salads mom" shit all the way? Salad could have easily been an experiment made by Oro and it would have made more sense why everyone was staying hush hush about it. Now everyone just looks like a fucking retard over "hur misunderstandings" bullshit.  <br>But Sakura isn't malicious at all. And Naruto is no better, but you don't see people hating on him constantly. <br><br>In what way is she a terrible human being?</br></br></br>  <br>Didn't you get it?<br>Only Indra is the homosexual.</br></br>  <br>It's not set in the movie's time period, anon. It's a flashback episode. <br><br>Still, after Hyuuga Loli Power Hour for The Last I'm willing to give it a chance.</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure its the same one, but I play a Naruto MMO by the name of Unlimited Ninja. Its absolute shit and pay to win as hell. I mean, you can get ahead by not paying money, but you get ahead by paying, and if someone gets ahead by those means, then you basically just lose to everyone forever. <br><br> I only play it because shitty anime MMOs are one of my guilty pleasures </br></br></br>   [HorribleSubs] Gakkou Gurashi! - 01 [720p].mkv <br><br>Let me tell you about shovels</br></br>  They would make her take off the hat at school yet she keeps it on. <br><br>Immersion lost, I can't continue this anime knowing such inconsistencies exist in a world I'm supposed to take seriously.</br></br>  <br> ´The dog became a zombie before the series started and was killed by Megu-nee. </br>  <br>Blogging is when you talk about your personal life.<br>Even if you consider that blogging, talking about your reaction to an episodein a few words isn't wrong (or "blogging") at all.<br>Because of people acting like this "blogging" has become an epic meme</br></br></br>  <br>I'm pretty sure this dog is real since everybody is interacting with him.</br>  <br> even if it looked like moeshit <br> implying I didn't read the description in the season chart <br>Just because I knew something was going to happen doesn't make the reveal any less surprising.</br></br></br>  Hey /a/, can you watch my Ryuuko for me?

That goddamn last scene when she sees the kid with the sailor suit. ;_;  <br>you'reself*<br><br>fucking retard...</br></br></br>  <br>Now watch the OVA for that fuzzy feeling inside, it takes place after the final episode's ending credits and explains Satsuki's haircut.</br>  <br>Saving the best for last eh?

It's usually one ugly woman and one ugly mandyke and the mandyke typically physically abuses the other woman (lesbian relationships have the highest spousal abuse rate of them all, like literally off the fucking charts).<br><br>But you don't read about that in the news or hear about it in the Televitz because muh LGBT and because they don't want to ruin the fetish for impotent cuckolds like you.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Real men walk them home gently first.</br>  <br>Ryuko loves wearing Senketsu more than anything in the world.</br>  Where did you all get those pictures of Ryuuko and Satsuki acting like sisters?

It's like giving Setsuna a Feldt pillow. Who does that?</br></br></br></br>  <br>sure</br>  <br>There we go, much better.</br>  Alternatively using Senketsu as a body pillow. <br><br> There are so many of these. </br></br>  baby ryuuko  <br> So many of these too. </br>  <br>Can I put her in the same room with Monkey?<br>Don't worry, it's blind.</br></br>      <br> fix nothing with socialism <br><br>or<br><br> fix most things with capitalism <br><br>gee whiz i wonder</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Monkey's a decent guy now, I don't think he'd do that.</br>  <br> those eyes </br>  <br>Do you think Monkey is making that face because his dick just went into NEET boypussy?</br>  <br>EYES UNCLOUDED BY HATE</br>  <br>That's much better.</br>  <br>Why?

But I think it was established that fabric softener is like hard alcohol to life fibers, so it might have some funky effects.</br>  <br>we will never get an ova of eyebrows trying to figure out how Ryuko can just walk off for 3 seconds before coming back drunk out of nowhere only to figure it out after coming across a spill near the laundry/washer under a tall shelf.</br>  <br> No OVA of Ryuko and Senketsu drinking fabric softener and acting drunk while Satsuki and Inumuta systematically prove that it must be a placebo effect, all softener does is make them smooth, but Mako convinces Satsuki not to break the illusion for them, so they continue to believe fabric softener is super alcoholic. In order to make it fair Satsuki breaks out the real sake. <br> Gamagoori gives everyone detention for underage drinking including Lady Satsuki and himself. No one's above the law, underage drinking is a serious problem! </br></br>  <br>Kek. I'd watch it.</br>  <br> Ryuuko's hair reaches peak fluffy from the fabric softener <br> Satsuki can't stop drunkenly pulling on it. </br></br>  <br>But I thought only when she gets mad she gets fluffy.

You can play that up, or, again, declare it a front and she really just wants to be on equal terms or whatever. She's a rape victim, target of abuse, fascist dictator, lady and saviour, older sister, bad mother fucker, rich girl, and so on.<br><br>She could even be a stoner in her spare time, given all the shit she's been through.<br><br>Ragyo's death leaves her on an ambiguous note with her life's work completed, so people take her in whatever direction they like.<br><br>At least, that's what scraping the /a/ archive shows. The board took her all around the rainbow as the series went on and her character came through.<br><br> And all the other characters besides Ryuko and maybe Senketsu are flat, so who else are you going to pick. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>can't believe the hawks won.

It's working for every other show, what's wrong with this one?<br>Same thing happened every season for one or two shows.<br>What am i doing wrong? Is the parenthesis messing with it?</br></br>  They removed the nip touching from the first scene and it's full on QUALITY. Can't get hype when the manga is so much better.  8 minutes long ecchi anime with the added gimmick of real nipples. Brilliant.  So I guess the interest in this died after mods started deleting threads about it. Oh well.  Gotta try a bit harder if you want to get people's attention OP.  <br><br>40+ shows, some of which have just aired.

I thought something intense was going to happen, but then she just goes "ah" and it's over.</br>    so obviously the original work is more lewd than this.

I want him to get stronger, myself.<br><br>Q: Will a new Shenlong appear?<br>A: Things called “Super Dragon Balls” will appear!<br><br>Q: Where will the fights in “DB Super” take place?<br>A: This time Lord Beerus is appearing too, so the battles will expand out into the universe.<br><br>Q: Will Jaco from Revival of “F” appear?<br>A: Of course he will. All sorts of characters will play a part in “DB Super”.<br><br>Q: Will enemies Goku defeated in the past reappear?<br>A: I wonder. Personally, I hope they will (laughs).<br><br>Q: Will a new rival for Goku and the gang appear?<br>A: Yes. And there won’t just be one!<br><br>Q: About how strong will these new rivals be?<br>A: Roughly strong enough to be on par with Goku.<br><br>Q: Will the battle scenes power up too?<br>A: That’s right. Watch out for Goku’s fighting style as he grows stronger by training!<br><br>Q: Will there be scenes of Freeza training, which weren’t depicted in Revival of “F”?<br>A: No comment. Personally, I’m conflicted over whether or not I want to see that (laughs).</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  And this is where Bulma's birthday party takes place.

But now it's confirmed he will never do anything again he is less then an ant at this point.</br></br>  <br>Just wait until Goku goes to some unknown planet and learns a powerup that is useless for him but humans can learn it and it makes them equal to SSGSS.</br>  <br>My last hope is that at the end of super they say something like.<br> Goku you have attained true power but can you match against our creator the first god?  <br> First god how can I fight him?  <br> He has been with you this whole time watching over you. <br> Krillins foreheads dots start to glow as he becomes a gold Buddha <br> Krillin is revealed as the final boss.  <br>A man can dream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> krillin  <br> not yamcha hiding his true power all long </br></br>  dimension fights, las boss is literally evil gok, krillin, piccolo and such, and they get help from Cell and freeza.   possibility of a slice of life freezer episode where he trains and does cute everday universe tyrant things <br><br>sign me in</br></br>  <br> Krillin and Yamcha fuses <br> Krillcha is stronger than Whis+SSG3 Goku </br></br>  What if the Saiyan race survived in the 6th universe, Vegeta saves them from impending doom, and finally becomes the King of all Saiyans as he was always ment to be?  <br>Dragon Ball Z is shit<br>DB is perfect.</br></br>  <br> Not liking both </br>  <br>I liked dbz untill the cell saga then it went full retard.</br>  We'll have reality benders and meta stuff by the end of this series.  <br>Autist, buu saga looks like DB the most in DBZ.</br>  <br> cell saga <br> full retard <br><br>Choose both.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't serve as a good rival universe then. Earth would most likely have been conquered much sooner, Red Ribbon not having the time to expand to make the Androids and Cell and the Buu arc also might not exist for a similar reason.<br>A good rival would be Gohan kept training after Cell, leading to him dealing with Buu before anything escalates and canonically is the strongest in his universe. <br>An alternate universe without parallel-Z Fighters isn't even worth telling.</br></br></br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=0aD<wbr>cWucKFjA</wbr>  [ ]<br>This shit still made me feel something tho to see Picclo just holding back as long as he can seeing Gohan get hurt while his father just stood there smiling.</br></br>  <br>The ending of BoG clearly indicated there were more peaks for Goku to strive for</br>  <br>Boo saga was better than Cell<br><br>Cell saga us only good at the beginning with Trunks and the end with Gohan. The rest is one big hunk of nothing</br></br></br>  <br>They're being expanded and changed around into arcs, then a 3rd new arc with multiversal shenanigans closes out the series.</br>  <br>Q: Will Gohan do cool stuff?<br>A: He'll read books. Difficult books.</br></br>  <br>Fighting over the water seems easier to animate.<br>And they can use the 3d models from the movies!</br></br>  <br> &gt;Krillins foreheads dots start to glow as he becomes a gold Buddha <br> &gt;Krillin is revealed as the final boss. <br>That would actually be pretty cool.</br></br></br>  <br> That book grants him a SSG power level </br>  <br>Q: Will Jaco from Revival of “F” appear?<br>A: Of course he will. All sorts of characters will play a part in “DB Super”.<br><br>Q: Will enemies Goku defeated in the past reappear?<br>A: I wonder. Personally, I hope they will (laughs).<br><br>Q: Will a new rival for Goku and the gang appear?<br>A: Yes. And there won’t just be one!<br><br>God damn it, everyone not Goku and Vegeta will be pushed right out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   beerus already awake and destroying planets much earlier than in the movie <br> bulma's birthday party takes place in a cruise ship instead of capsule corp <br><br>these changes give me hope, it means that they can change a lot of stuff from the movie, hopefully the fight between the Z fighters and beerus will be longer than in the movie. I really want to see buu trying to turn beerus into chocolate (although gods are immune to magic) and gohan being badass</br></br></br>  But will there be MULTIVERSE?  Why did SSGSS go from red aura to blue?  <br>The one thing I want is for goku to fuck off eventually and his kids to finally take over for real.</br>  <br>Its like how a flame changes to blue at its hottest.<br>yellow-&gt;red-&gt;blue</br></br>  SSGSS is weaker than SSG though. If anything, the new saiyan forms would be him slowly regaining his SSG strength, if they go that route.  <br>Source?</br>  <br>These answers sound like fanfic level developments</br>  The end of RoF was a big middle finger in the face towards Goku haters.  <br>Most of DBZ sounds like fanfiction.</br>  <br> wanting a person who doesn't like fighting and just wants to read, and a little shithead to take over the show </br>  <br>I didn't mean him obviously its goten who will grow up and finally take over the show since the nerd failed.</br>  <br>Literally Kotaku. They misinterpreted Toriyama's message</br>  <br>But that's wrong.<br>Red &gt; orange &gt; yellow &gt; white &gt; blue</br></br>  <br>Yeah I'm dumb.</br>  <br> white haired ssj confirmed. </br>  I find funny how sometimes some anons says that Dragon ball's theme is about passing the torch to the new generation despite at the end of the days it's always up to Goku to clean the shit his sons failed to clean. Shit like this is the reason why Gohan will never be in the spotlight again and why goten will always be a little piece of shit as even at his best he failed and got absorbed     super dragon balls   <br>I feel like at some point passing the torch was the theme but then they needed more chapters so it just became goku forever getting stronger despite killing someone refered to as the strongest in the galaxy like 150 episodes before the end of Z.</br>  <br>Despite the shitty clothing designs, AF had a decent idea of what the future of DB would be like.</br>  <br>Please, that's nothing<br><br>https://<span>youtu.be/ll_XPenKkqA  [ ]</br></br></br>  <br><br> Will things in DBS happen that happened in DBZ? <br><br>What an insightful interview</br></br></br></br>  <br>Don't worry, I hear episode 20 has 18 speak a whole TWO WORDS!<br><br>Get hyped motherfuckers!</br></br></br>  <br>Kek<br><br>They guessed SSGSSJ before Toriyama did</br></br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127828621 <br>What's the point of such a long handle?</br>  <br>Why wouldn't be called a deep throat then?</br>  <br>She's not deepthroating the handle though.</br>  <br>Ofc ss shenron is gonna turn bad and become the overlord of the universe<br> FUCK YEAH</br></br>  <br>But Jaco wasn't in Z</br>  There goes the slice of life, but with fighting bit.  <br>There was no way anybody believed that would be the whole series</br>  The episodes between the BoG and RoF arcs are just gonna be Vegeta whining until everyone lets him become a SSG.  <br>It already looked pretty shitty in the movie. There's no chance that the TV version will look better.</br>  <br>DBZ is legitimately pretty terrible, though. It was godawful pacing and shit animation. There's no reason to watch it instead of just reading DB.</br>  <br> DBZ is legitimately pretty terrible, though. It was godawful pacing and shit animation. <br>Are you implying DB (anime) didn't have those problems?<br> There's no reason to watch it instead of just reading DB. <br>Yeah, I was talking about the Z portion of the manga.</br></br></br></br>  I wan't the Jaco manga to get animated as well. short OVA series  <br>He was in the latest DBZ movie.</br>  <br>Watch them animate it as a multi-episode flashback<br> Bulma: "Oh hey Jaco, I haven't seen you since I was a little girl!" <br> *Another character*: "How do you know this guy?" <br> Bulma: "Well, my sister told it like this..." <br> *Insert Jaco adaptation* </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>color has nothing to do with the flame's heat</br></br>  <br> Jaco is it's own arc <br><br>Yes please</br></br></br>  <br>You shoyld have said the same thing when:<br> androids out of nowhere, stronger than Super Saiyans <br> random ssj forms, stronger than ssj <br> ssj2, stronger than super saiyan <br> namek balls, out in space <br>Dragon Ball scaling up is nothing new.<br><br> rip dbz <br>That'd right, because this is dbs, not dbz.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  I hope they give hyper modes to the humans and namekians as well. It is pure bullshit how only saiyans can go hyper mode and have many levels of them even  <br> he should know when to cap the strength <br>Why? Dragon Ball has been about getting stronger in literally every arc.</br></br>  <br><br>THIS. Dragon ball's powerlevels knows no limits and they will keep asspulling more and more powerups so long the series continues.<br><br>Besides, they've been doing this shit since the Saiyan saga. At first it was just good enough to train to get stronger, but then they added power multiplier with the Kaioken AKA the prototype of super saiyan damage multipliers, and then introduced the huge multipler that was super saiyan, later we got the revelation that the legendary power of super saiyan can be improved as seen with the SSJ variations used against Cell, and then we find that not only has variations but also have levels, introducing super saiyan 2, which was followed by super saiyan 3 (which made the variations obsolete and they lack variations themselves, probably because Toriyama forgot about them). So adding a new brand of powerlevel multiplier isn't weird</br></br></br></br>  Kuririn confirmed for B story in episode 3  <br>I think they are going the way of all the side characters taking on lesser threats while Goku and Vegeta go on the great space adventure.<br><br>IIRC wasn't there something about Videl getting kidnapped when Super was first announced?</br></br></br>   There's actually a chance Vegito might show up in Super in one of the other Universes   <br>No</br>  <br>I hope it's slice of life of him as a cop.</br>  <br>Well they would need some new Potara earrings for that. Hope those other universes have Kaioshins.<br><br>I think it would make more sense to have Gogeta be canon. Toriyama always wanted to do it, but Movie 12 came out before he could put it in the manga</br></br></br>  <br> A: Things called “Super Dragon Balls” will appear! <br>Literally why</br></br>  <br>Because it is called dragon ball super, so it should have super dragon balls, makes sense. Now where are my Z dragon balls, Toei?</br>  <br>As long as they don't explode the planet for some godforsaken reason, why not?</br>  <br>I meant that perhaps there is a Universe where that Vegeta and Goku stayed fused as Vegito or something. But I wouldn't be against Gogeta showing up either.</br>  <br>Why would they even need them</br>  <br>for a super wish</br>  <br>Alternate Universe.</br>   Super dragon ball <br><br>Literally ripping off GT</br></br>  <br>Because, well you know<br><br>Shampa is going to destroy their universe and they need SUPER dragon balls to revice it?<br><br>Also the balls are scattered through each universe, luckily for them Whis just happened to have their universes ball.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It was confirmed they're going to use the super dragon balls to bring a whole planet back, which is either planet Vegeta or earth. Maybe Namek but I doubt it, the Namekians already have New Namek.</br>  <br>The regular Dragon Balls were created by Namekians. So are the Super Dragon Balls created by a Super Namekian God or something?</br>  <br> super namekian god fuses with piccolo <br> piccolo's power increases a thousandfold <br> he's still a jobber </br></br></br>  <br> planet Vegeta <br>lol you really think reviving them and the whole saiyan race is a good idea?<br><br>Do you want them to think of Goku as a legenday super god super saiyan?<br><br>Come on.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> only holds his own against the big bad for like two episodes before big bad goes into 54th form and requires the assistance of LSSJGASSJ2 Goku </br>  <br> Saiyans <br> implying <br>It'll be guilt-tripping Vegeta into apologizing to all the little space hobbits that his dad slaughtered.</br></br></br>  <br>I just want to see this qt again.</br>  What's the best fansub group for Super?  <br> red skin </br>  <br>Still better than the Mary Sue that Multiverse put for Goku's mom.</br>  <br>I'd probably rather have this. Call me a pleb. I don't care.</br>  <br>This wasn't confirmed anywhere.</br>  <br> It was confirmed they're going to use the super dragon balls to bring a whole planet back <br>No it wasn't</br></br>  <br>Dragon Team.</br>  <br>Some guy in a previous thread said it without providing a source. If that isn't 100% confirmation I don't know what is.</br>  <br> LSSJGASSJ2 <br><br>I'll bet that'll be some term, too. Every time I see SSJGSSJ I have to fucking laugh.</br></br></br>  <br> "Look out, an even stronger opponent!" <br> Goku goes Super Saiyan God ascended to level 4 using Kaioken times 1 million while using a senzu bean IV drip so he doesn't die from overexertion </br></br>  <br>You are a Broly-loving pleb and you are not mah nigga.<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=d8x<wbr>uvDz3k2o</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4KC<wbr>3tSKv7ko</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=FnS<wbr>0818yHwQ</wbr>  [ ]<br><br>Absalon is everything wrong with the Dragon Ball fandom in the west.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone got a link to the english sub that one anon was doing for the spanish dub of F? Or any sub would be fine  <br>Who doesn't love Broly?</br>  <br>You could tell they grew up with the american dub of Z and GT with the faulconer and menza music and probably never even watched dragonball.</br>  Would have been a WAY better movie. DBZ is dead.  <br>Him just hanging around with dere 18 please.</br>  <br>Go to the /a/ archives, and it'll be in the latest super thread.</br>  <br>As far as movie villains go I always preferred Cooler and Janemba. I never got the love for Broly back then.</br>  <br>Thanks a lot, I didn't even think to check the archives</br>  who /goten/ here?  <br>Goten is.</br>  <br><br>Goten a shit. A SHIT<br><br>He can't do anything by himself and must go the gay route of touching balls with Trunks to be useful at all.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Clearly.</br>  <br>I really think/hope Goten becomes Goku's successor. I agree when people (and Piccolo) say Gohan was never a fighter. But Goten definitely sees sport in fighting, and he looks like Goku too. And he has Trunks for a friendlier rivalry.</br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br> Goku and the others still act impressed when the bad guy can blow up the planet </br>  <br>Goten is stupid and completely sucks when he isn't doing comedy scenes with Trunks.</br>  <br>Removing the long sleeves was a mistake.</br>   SSJ10 will never be canon <br>why live</br>  is there any other anime that promotes family values better than dragon ball  <br> Frieza is a purple cooler <br>Taking the already fan-made fifth form frieza and making it real would have been unoriginal and just bad for the series. Ssj3 Gogeta is cool, but ssgss is cooler.</br></br>  This is going to be a fucking trainwreck.  <br>Wouldn't have been any worse then Piss-Frieza and Super Cyan.</br>  <br> Goku constantly abandons his wife <br> Vegeta knocked Bulma up years before they got married <br> Krillin married a cyborg <br> family values </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Yes it has. When a flame has a lot of Oxygen it turns more blueix and it burns more.</br></br>  <br><br>What family values? The only meaningful contact family members have between them is when they train. The moments when people acts like an actual family are brief and scarce, which is probably why people are so shocked and amazed when Goku shows any emotion other than battlelust</br></br>  <br>I wish I could remember the name of this RPG Maker game I played in the late-90's, where everyone (even Krillin) was a SSJ and kept getting "SSJ transformations" up to SSJ15.<br>I think the game ends with "Gogetunks" fighting Majin FreeCell or some shit.</br></br>  <br> goku constantly abandons his wife <br>To get strong to protect her. Except for the 7 years he went away because he felt as if he attracted trouble, which is kinda true as, the first day he came back, Majin Buu appeared. But yeah, still sucks.<br> vegeta. <br>Yeah. Can't refute it. At least they got married. <br> krillin <br>Still human</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>"Human enough to have babies" does not mean she's entirely human. If the wife isn't 100% of one species, it's degeneracy.</br>  <br>hells yeah</br>  <br>Anon, Robot isn't a species.</br>  <br>Hold on... If that's the case, and they're gonna bring back a planet...<br><br> It will be them trying to bring back Earth because at the end of RoF, Freeza blows up the planets killing everybody except for goku, krillin, tien, roshi, piccolo, bulma, beerus and whis </br></br></br>  <br> posts DA tier fanfic bullshit <br> no one calls him out on said faggotry <br>DB threads are dead</br></br></br>  <br>And if they decide to  keep Earth destroyed for the plot, then would they keep Freeza alive? They mention that he was probably still alive after he blew up earth... <br><br>That could have potential</br></br></br>  <br>more like dbshit, amirite?</br>  <br> Goku leaves to get strong enough to protect her. <br><br>Nope, he leaves because he is addicted to training, he never once tried to deny it, fans love to think that the characters are always anticipating when the next overpowered alien will arrive and try to kill everyone, when in reality they just go on with their lives.<br><br>Its not like Goku trains to become the ohhh so great defender of the Earth, he does it because he has fun doing it and because he is good at it, I don't think this is something that hard to get from his character, specially when the writer himself said this over and over again during interviews.<br><br>Goku has almost zero interest in hanging out with his family, if he could he would sleep, eat, and train, every single day, even through he is omnipresent due to his instant transmission and could teleport back home during every break to kiss his wife or something, but he doesn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I blame the US dub that pictures Goku as a huge defender of earth who likes to protect the weak when he's just really in for the kicks.</br>  <br>the funi dubs gave too much shit on dragon ball</br>  Why do I still think the best dragon ball episode is when Goku and Piccolo try to get Driving Licenses?  <br> I really think/hope Goten becomes Goku's successor <br>Nah.<br><br>First of all, it would have to be Goten and Trunks. GoTrunks have become inseparable in DB fandom in Japan, second, Goten may like fighting but he unlike Goku, doesn't have the battle lust. He likes to play and be a kid than become a hero.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Goku didn't have any battlelust as kid, he just went into unlimited enemies because the dragon balls,</br>  <br>So who should succeed Goku then?<br><br>If you say "Gohan" your opinion is discarded.</br></br></br>  <br>Gabo fuck off</br>  Dragon ball should've taken place in space decades ago, the fact that they came back to earth after introducing several different worlds in the freeza saga was dissapointing on many levels.  <br>Go fuckyourself </br>  <br>It's the best filler episode yes, but not the best episode ever.</br>  <br>Pan and Uub. Like Toriyama intended.</br>  <br>18 is a cyborg, not a robot.</br>  <br> Hold on... If that's the case, and they're gonna bring back a planet <br>No, it's fake. That was never said</br></br>  <br> It turns out she's a trap and Whis had been a Dodoria all along. </br>  <br> Goku has almost zero interest in hanging out with his family <br>That's not really that true or else he would have zero signs of believing in or caring about his sons at all which is not the case. It's just that he is always thinking about training first.<br><br>And even with that being the case, his family loves him just the way he is. Look at Goten's smile after Goku says he's off to Kaio's</br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah but Goku had no time to battle lust as he had new objectives in every arc as opposed to note when he gets down time a lot.<br><br><br> So who should succeed Goku then? <br>You want me to be perfectly honest, nobody as long as Goku is still alive and a prominent figure in Dragon Ball. It would be like replacing Kenshiro or Lupin. Nobody's clamoring for a Lupin the Fourth are they?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Chi-Chi hates Goku. She only married him because of some dumb childhood promise and now she's stuck being married to a literal retard.</br>  <br>Man Toriyama's grown up Pan is so much more of a qt</br>  <br>She's also less of a brat than GT Pan. Not difficult, I know, but it stands repeating.<br><br> Also less LEWD than Xenoverse GT Pan. Goddamn she is so lewd. </br></br></br>  <br>   Also less LEWD than Xenoverse GT Pan. Goddamn she is so lewd.<br/> <br>Proof?</br></br>  <br> Krillins foreheads dots start to glow as he becomes a gold Buddha <br> Krillin is revealed as the final boss.  <br> "Have you never wondered why I don't have a nose, Goku? Humans have noses. I have been hiding my true identity all along." <br> what about those times when you got murdered? shouldnt you have defended yourself? <br> "don't be ridiculous, we all know death has no consequences. we keep living in other world" </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>DB threads were never good<br>Like ever</br></br>    All these idiots wanting slice of life shit.<br><br>STOP WATCHING SHOUNEN YOU BAND OF DUMBASS</br></br>  <br>But standard anime SoL is moeshit garbage about cute highschool girls in clubs. There is no actual good SoL outside of a rare few shows, and whenever Dragon Ball dips its feet in the genre. Dragon Ball SoL is god tier.</br>  <br>That would fit Tien a lot more since he can literally grow arms from his back.</br>  <br>Nobody is saying permanent slice of life is where they want the show to go. They just want to see the characters interact in non-fight settings and the few times DB does that, it is very very good.</br>  <br><br> Dragon Ball SoL is god tier <br> he few times DB does that, it is very very good <br>Confirmed for not watching the right show. I bet you only know DBZ, Evangelion, Cowboy Bebop and Haruhi.</br></br></br></br>  <br> muh moeshit </br>  Is the music in the dub being composed by Bruce Faulconer?<br><br>The music in kai was extremely shitty and doesn't fit DBZ at all lol</br></br>  <br>here's your reply</br>  <br>She is quite bluntly flirtatious with you, the player character, asking if you think she is cute, talking about getting married, pondering on ordering you to do things because "she's your new mentor," LITERALLY throwing her pants at you, etc. etc.<br><br> Even if you're a girl. Even if you're a Majin. Even if you're a Majin girl. Even if you're a Namek. Even if you're part of Frieza's race. </br></br></br>  <br> vegeta <br>Was it even confirmed that they got married at all though?</br></br>  FUCK im so hyped for DBS, my only hope in life  So wait : If UuB trained would he be even stronger than Gold Frieza?  <br>Yes.</br>  <br>In Yo! Son Goku and His Friends Return, after Gure is introduced as Tarble's wife, Roshi mentions how Saiyans always choose strange wives at which point Bulma smacks him so I think that counts as proof that she and Vegeta got married at some point.</br>  <br>For how many months?</br>  <br>too bad it will probably take like 24 episodes of remakeshit before we get to the new arc</br>  <br>I've seen a few episodes in the original english dub and find it unbelievable that americans defend that shit. It's so generic, repetitive and "edgy".</br>  <br> Freeza will be another one of Goku's friends by the end. </br>  <br> Gogetunks" fighting Majin FreeCell </br>  <br> Using "edgy" unironically. <br><br>Anon, please.</br></br></br>  <br> Even if you're a girl.

And I don't mean obvious ones like "The Hand" or "Harvest", I mean shit like "Sticky Fingers", "Whitesnake", "Moody Blues", etc.<br><br>Do they just go "whatever" and pick shit that sounds cool?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Post best MADs. https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=YTo<wbr>74CA8yPo</wbr>  [ ]  <br>They're based on Bands, Artists or Songs.</br>  <br>They name themselves.</br>  <br>Songs</br>  <br>Yes, I get that, but I don't mean Araki's thought process, I mean the characters.<br><br>Like what,</br></br></br>  <br><br>Spice Girl did for sure, at least.</br></br>  <br>So one afternoon, Bruno was listening to the Rolling Stones and suddenly thought "shit, I'm naming my stand Sticky Fingers!"</br>  <br>The same reason characters like to shout the name of their stands when they activate them. Rule of cool.</br>    <br>Stop posting these jewess</br>  Which would win in a fight Horus or White Album?  <br/>  <br>Any more of her?</br>  <br>I fucking hope not, these threads don't need more shitty tumblr cosplay or genderbent characters.</br>    <br>Sticky Fingers makes sense. It's named after an album that came with a zipper on it. Makes sense.</br>  <br>His spirit was the fucking strong<br><br>They're all weebs, tell me you don't want to yell some random combination of words that sounds cool together and have a punchghost appear</br></br></br>  <br>Do you know where you are? I think you got the url confused for www.tumblr.com or possibly even www.reddit.com</br>  How do you guys feel about the Part 5 name changes that were in All-Star Battle?<br><br>Gold Experience =&gt; Golden Wind<br>Sticky Fingers =&gt; Zipper Man<br>Sex Pistols =&gt; Six Bullets<br>Aerosmith =&gt; Li'l Bomber<br>King Crimson =&gt; Emperor Crimson<br>Moody Blues =&gt; Moody Jazz<br>Grateful Dead =&gt; Thankful Dead<br>Spice Girl =&gt; Spicy Lady<br>Beach Boy =&gt; Fisher Man<br>White Album =&gt; White Ice<br>Kraftwork =&gt; Arts &amp; Crafts<br>Oasis =&gt; Sanctuary<br>Green Day =&gt; Green Tea<br>Little Feet =&gt; Tiny Feet<br>Baby Face =&gt; Babyhead</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>All these cosplays are shit though and made even worse because it's shitty DIO but with a twist where he now has implants.</br>  <br> its not a beautiful duwang </br>  <br>You're literally getting upset because people are posting cosplay. Go outside or something.</br>  <br> posted the wrong picture <br>epic not nice</br></br>  <br>Get out.</br>  <br>It's ok considering that they had to do it for legal reasons. If it was for the hell of it then I would be pretty angry.</br>   This thread   <br>Again, do you know where you are?</br>  <br>"/v/ is the only place to use the ? block spoilers"</br>  <br>Terrible. At least they could have tried to be funny like they did with some of the other ones.</br>  <br>I think Zipper man is too on the nose and sounds really stupid "Fear my stand ZIPPER MAN" <br><br>Six Bullets is just terrible...<br><br>Spicy Lady would sound better if it was Spice Lady or Spice Chick<br><br>Green Tea...why<br><br>The rest are fine for me.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Obligatory   <br>Why did they even change Kraftwork when the band is Kraftwerk?</br>  These are my favorite pages in part 7 because I have no fucking clue what Gyro or Johnny are even doing.  <br> that DIO butt <br><br>Pls OP no</br></br></br>  <br> shitty DIO <br><br><br>King Crimson should have been renamed Babyface.<br><br><br>It's still dangerously close to a copyright infringement, better safe than sorry I guess.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Emperor Crimson <br>I  actually kinda like that one. <br>Thankful dead and moody jazz are pretty good, too.</br></br></br>  <br>Around 4 chapters usually. The wiki shows how many chapters are covered per episode.</br>  <br>But not the one from the "original" universe. So...</br>  So why can't they use names? Like, for most of them it's just fucking words like "Little Feet" how is that fucking trademarked? Like I understand unique names Like Metallica and shit but most of the names are just words they shouldn't have to change them to avoid copyright, it's bullshit imo.  <br>The name changes were retarded. The insertion of memes and Commie tier joke subs for everything else just made it one of the worst game localizations I'd see in years. I don't recall it selling much in the US so maybe I won't have to see that trash with EOH.</br>  <br>So you're saying it's not related at all that a DIO from a world where Jonathan Joestar never became his body still has The World, and not Hermit Purple.</br>  <br> I don't recall it selling much in the US so maybe I won't have to see that trash with EOH. <br>This isn't how copyrights work.</br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br/></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's saying hopefully it won't get localized.</br>  <br><br>Did anyone expect a series that JUST gained popularity in the west, not huge, but small to sell?</br></br>  <br>Bandai-Namco did apparently.</br>  <br>The said that?</br>  <br>Why else would they bother localizing it? For charity work?</br>  <br> Lets release a game in the west that's a celebration of all 8 parts while westerners have only seen the first 3 <br>Bamco never made intelligent localisation decisions.</br></br>  Is amazon the best place to buy Jojonium?  <br>So what? Doesn't change the fact that there is a Diego with The World.</br>  <br>So it has no bearing on the argument about DIO or Jonathan having the World. Diego is a separate character from DIO, AU Diego is even further separated.</br>  Doesn't TPP fuck over all band stands?  <br>The Phantom Pain?</br>  <br>He's an alternate version of Dio, and btw it is written in Jojo a gogo that the world is Dio's stand and hermit 2 is the stand of Jonathan, so stop with this bullshit please</br>  <br>The pirate party?<br>Trans Pacific Partnership?</br></br>  <br>Except for the fact that, every universe but the Prime one isn't canon.</br>  <br>No, he's not. He's an alternate version of Diego. Who is not Dio.</br>  <br> every universe but the Prime one isn't canon <br>Are you retarded?</br></br>  <br>Diego is an alternate version of Diego, and still, the World isn't Dio's stand, you ignored my second sentence to protect your silly headcanon</br>  <br>What does that have to do with The Pink Panther?</br>  <br>Are you even asking? He said that Diego isn't an alternate version of Dio. In fact Diego got a total different back story, attitude, stand and name.</br>  <br>Consistency</br>  <br>I felt like it wasn't even worth addressing. JoJo a GoGo is secondary material which has dubious usage since Araki changes his mind. Plus it still doesn't contradict the idea that The World is Jonathan's stand which might also have all the Joestar stand powers.</br>  After 100 years, there would have been two things in that coffin, the Joestar's greatest enemy, and the remains of their forefather. So, the question remains: What did Dio do with Jonathan's skull?  <br>Things that would make Pucci and Vanilla Ice jealous.</br>  <br> I didn't address it because it's secondary material <br>Nigga you're literally just making all this shit up without any proof at all and you dismiss secondary sources?</br></br>  <br> secondary material <br>What. He was written after part 5, why the fuck should he needed to change his mind 2 parts after sdc? Are you even trying or just shooting random bullshit?</br></br>  <br> The words from the creator himself don't count <br>You have to be baiting</br></br>  <br><br><br><br>I haven't gone outside of the manga itself to find anything. Araki contradicts himself and changes his mind frequently, you should know that. How many dropped subplots do you need to get that? For that very reason anything outside of the manga itself doesn't have much use. He makes up whatever he feels like at the time.<br><br>Do you also want to say that Pucci never beat Jotaro, because Araki said in an interview that only Jotaro's kid with that idol would be able to beat him?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Muh headcanon counts more than an official book written by the mangaka </br>  <br>If Araki wishes for something to be true then it's fucking true you dumbass, he is the god of his fucking work he can do whatever he wants.<br><br>Also source on that idol thing because if it's before the end of Stone Ocean then your point is invalid there</br></br></br>  <br>OK, now show us the proof that Araki changes his mind 2 parts after sdc only because one morning he said "ehy, I now decided that the world is Jonathan's stand, I will never put this on the plot, I will even make another version of Dio Brando with the same stand so fans won't know that I made this new decision, I'm such a genius!"</br>  Is the Part 7 translation Vento Aureo-ish or am i just stupid? I just read the first few chapters of D4C (Right now i'm at the part where Gyro finds Johnny after being shot) and i really did not understand most of what was going on (With the multiple Diegos and Wekapipos, and the reason why the later died).<br><br>Does Valentine's ability get explained in better detail later or should i just re-read those chapters?</br></br>  <br>Stands protect their users, why the fuck should The World protect the one who killed his user?</br>  This is a really unimportant question that no-one should give a shit about, but what color should Gyro's teeth be in the possible Part 7 anime adaptation?<br><br>http://strawpoll.me/4871484</br></br>  <br>There can't be two same people in the same universe, so they just fuse and die</br>  <br>I don't like the goldish color, I would rather prefer silver</br>  <br>Nah, it's just bizarre</br>  <br>Imagine that it's like matter and anti-matter, but exclusive to people. When a person goes to an alternate world and comes into contact with his alternate self, they both fuse and die. It's exclusive only to each specific person, contact with anything else when visiting an alternate world has no repercussions, only contact with your alternate self. You could potentially live your own life normally in this alternate world, so long as your alternate self is avoided, whether he is dead or alive does not matter.</br>  <br>So Basically. "I'm going to keep adding bait to this meme so I can bust a nut off of all the spergs getting upset by it."<br> I like you.</br></br>  <br>Not him, but I remember in the same interview they showed Wekapipo. It's on youtube somewhere.</br>  <br>That depends what you're talking about. Actual Jojoniums or the Viz English release is isn't called Jojonium but uses the assets? For the viz release you'd be better off buying from Book Depository, cheaper and free shipping. As for the actual Jojoniums, Amazon.jp or CDJapan.</br>  <br>Wait, is he seriously talking about the Shoko interview? Now I know he is fucking baiting, Araki was obviously fucking joking when he said that to her. Araki isn't joking in his artbooks.</br>  I can kind of understand how King Crimson works but how does Gold Experience work? It brings things to life so how does it turn a broach into a ladybug which is actually a tracking device which is actually the stand using turtle?  <br>Gold Experience works in any way Araki wants it to work. It's the asspull stand to end all asspull stands.<br>And you just wait till you get to the end...</br></br>  <br>is there something wrong with the way he's loading the gun? because I just took it at Sex Pistols rerouting all the bullets so they don't hit him.</br>  Why has nobody who had possession of the Stand arrows tried stabbing themselves with it multiple times? DIO could have had The World Requiem x 100000.  <br>The bullet is the dark grey part at the front the rest is the casing when you fire a bullet the hammer hits the casing which ignites the propellenet within pushing the bullet forwards. The fired bullets Mista is picking up still have their casings attached. You could pretend it was sex pistols kicking the bullets out of the gun but the casings still shouldn't be there.</br>  <br>Meant for<br/></br>  Your reply to this is going to be "Why does this exist Anon!"<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=aD-<wbr>ZWzssjBQ</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> Pronouncing Kakyoin as Kyokin <br>What the fuck</br></br>  When the fuck did dio use hermit purple?im only on part 2 in the manage but I watched the anime to the end and didn't see it used once.  <br>The guy isn't a Jojofag, plus the Story was prolly written horribly (It's about Jotaro sensually making Ravioli for his boyfriend, go figure.)

Its still there and very much alive and indestructible and capable of expanding, growing, and eventually getting back to land to reek havoc.<br><br>Hell it survived HEAVEN. Just making it go away isn't the same as defeating it. Kars technically wasn't defeated, only the D4C, Cream, and Killer Queen could possibly kill him.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Are you twelve or something? Spice Girls was a pop group.<br>It's a joke, though a bad one.</br></br>  <br> Bohemian rhapsody defeated itself. <br>that means shit stand<br><br>Notorious BIG was defeated by Made in Heaven, but even then it wasn't growing, canonically it never did anything but destroy some ships.<br><br> Hell it survived HEAVEN. <br><br>wait what? Please tell me you're not getting this from Jorge Joestar, it's not canon.<br><br><br>I know who the Spice Girls are, I'm saying that specific joke, just terrible then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dude, anyone who didn't get killed in the previous universe by pucci gets transfered to the next one. And pucci can't possibly kill Notorious BIG because its a stand so you can't turn it back into a disc via whitesnake, Gravity don't mean shit to it no inverting is, and touching it with Made in heaven even with super speed is just gonna get Pucci infected and die. Or worse Pucci becomes possessed by it and it uses HEAVEN itself.</br>  <br>you said anyone, stands aren't people, since the user for notorious big gets irenized, the stand ceases to exist</br>  what if Ungalo vs Rohan?  Could D4C walk into Cream's dimension or would he be atomised?  <br>Well seeing how Vanillia seems fine in his dimension, its safe to assume anyone who can cross dimensions wouldn't be vaporized in the transition. Remember, the president was perfectly find from having pieces of him pushes to another dimension from water falling on his face. <br><br>Also I now want a drawfag to draw Valentine and Vanilla ice laughing at people from inside of cream.</br></br></br>  <br>filename time?</br>  <br> weather report in the same tier as yellow temperance and echoes </br>  <br> capable of writing any possible effect on anything <br> capable of massive gravity and Stand Rush punch strength. <br><br>Like I'll agree that Echo would be on the lower end of that tier and weather higher, but by both are very capable stands. Echos is massively versatile, while Weather is versatile and powerful.<br><br>But neither of them would be in the same tier as the stands in the tier above, and they can handle a lot more shit than the one in the tier below.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Elder god tier - No chance to defeat it <br> Notorious BIG <br> Mid Tier <br> the hand <br>You realise the hand can erase BIG very easily right?</br></br></br></br></br>  Why is Catch the Rainbow so cute?  <br>Who won the race? Pretty sure that was Pocoloco.</br>  <br>It was, Pocoloco always wins thanks to Hey Ya, he can just lose temporarily when someone does something completely unexpected</br>  Some-Stuffs website is dead.  Why did Diavolo tell Passione to bring his daughter to him instead of telling them to kill her? Isn't their job assassination you'd think they'd be pretty good at it.<br>When Bruno took her to the tower why did Diavolo abduct her why didn't he just leave a wad of cash and a note telling him to leave her there for the next group of agents to pick her up.<br>Why was he so worried about being seen when he could just assume the Doppio persona in case Bruno caught any quick glances and if Bruno took a deliberate look just king crimson that away.<br>If he absolutely had to attack her then and there why didn't he just slam his hand through her skull instead of cutting her hand off and running off with her.<br>Where was he planning to go with her that would make any difference? Surely king crimson could deal with any onlookers if she died in the tower instead of the secret morgue.<br>I don't understand.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>what happened?</br>  <br>Domain seems to elapsed.<br>Hopefully it's not the end of the BD subs, but they've never had much means of communication available.</br></br>  <br>The true, real, 100% cannon answer is that Araki makes shit up as he goes and it causes plot holes.<br><br>But you can explain some of it away as Diavolo being clinically paranoid. He really had no reason to have Trish put down because she barely had any idea who her dad was and people were gonna get no clues out her. But Diavolo is clinically paranoid and acts irrationally like 90% of the time. "OH NO my daughter that's never met me is gonna reveal my identity!" And then he retrieves her in a jazzed up and crazy way.</br></br></br>  <br>The real answer is: Araki doesn't give a fuck and does whatever is cool.</br>  <br>Yellow Temperance  HAS NO WEAKNESS </br>  <br>Isn't a Stand an extension of the soul, though? Jonathan's soul isn't in his body, Dio's is. Thinking The World is Jonathan's Stand is cool, but probably incorrect.</br>  <br> Love Train above CHUMIIIIIIN </br>  So I began watching the 2012 anime. Is that true that the first 9 episodes are like the prequel to the Jojo that appeared in the manga/games? I'm a little confused. Great series by the way.  <br>Where did you hear that false information?</br>  <br>Except for being incredibly slow and close range only and Rubber Soul can only control what's touching him the goo that gets attached to Jotaro can only mindlessly chew his hand.<br>Also it can be easily pinned down by a stand like Echoes act 3 and Rubber Soul isn't protected against any non-physical or internal stand attack like grateful dead or Lovers. Crazy Diamond could probably revert Yellow Temperence back into all the random creatures and objects it assimilated.<br>Yellow Temperence is fucking trash.</br></br></br>  <br>100<br>Implying Star Platinum isn't at least high teir.</br></br>  <br>Dude from work who recommended me the anime.</br>  <br><br>Why is she sitting like that?</br></br>  How did Cairne get anywhere in the gang when Notorious Big only activates when he's dead? Did he just tell them his stand was really really amazing and Diavolo said welcome to the inner circle?  <br>People that stupid can get jobs? All of the parts are their own thing. There isn't a main JoJo. The first 9 episodes are Part 1 and the rest are Part 2. Part 3 is in anime form too. The manga is better at showing the parts as seperate. All of the parts have something to do with each other plot wise, though.</br>    <br>He was kept as the gang clown.</br>  <br>she probably thinks my face is there</br>  <br>I see. Thanks for explaining it to me. And yeah, he's a bit of a moron. He watched it for the memes.</br>    <br>This is how you get a 9</br>  <br>lt's over, Dio!

KC shits on Green Baby. KC fucking murders MiH and hard counters Cream.<br><br>MiH is not god tier. Killer Queen can kill it KC and Tusk Act 4 can kill it. SP/ZW can kill it. Most likely Heaven's Door can kill it too. Cream is a shit stand. Anyone in the High Tier can defeat it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Do you agree?<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=oFs<wbr>Qi1FTaRk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>Finally</br>  <br>B-BAKANA</br>  <br>Wouldn't Heaven's Door be the strongest stand if Rohan actually used it to it's full potential? You could just write "I am invincible and completely unaffected by the effects of every stand" and win every fight.</br>  <br>Sovereign Salmon</br>  <br>forgot to add The Hand can delete Love Train's dimensional barrier. Cream would get erased too.</br>  <br> you will never be a Japanese man in 1989 seeing Jotaro stop time for the first time </br>  <br>Can Rohan even write commands on himself? I think someone mentioned that he could in that louvre special but that is not cannon right? Rohan can win agains anyone without GER levels of hax or timestop/skip.<br><br>It can defeat MiH and Tusk Act 4 easily.</br></br></br>  <br>Not how it works. You write on a person and they follow that rule you can't just write on yourself and expect everyone ever to follow that rule since Heaven's Door needs a target and doesn't have infinite range.</br>    <br>stop</br>  <br><br>He can't read his own history using Heaven's Door, and I don't think he can write on himself either. Only a copycat stand like Boy II Man could affect Rohan using Heaven's Door.</br></br>  <br> Tusk <br> only HIGH </br></br>  <br>Then he could just write on someone else that they had the ability to read and write on Rohan's pages.</br>  <br><br>No idea if Rohan at the Louvre is canon but he could write on himself there.

So it was fanservice yes, but not really a bad kind.</br>  I'm halfway through part 3 and can someone tell me why polnareff is more of a protag than Jotaro ?    <br> &gt; flying like Jotaro and DIO <br>yeah was that ever explained?</br></br>  <br>That filename really has no relevancy to the actual pic, you dolt. "Filename time" means post normal pictures/gifs/webms that relate to jojo once you read the filename.</br>  <br>I always thought it was something like DIO just being able to jump really, really high and far because vampire and Jotaro doing the same using Star Platinum.<br><br>The anime kinda destroyed that idea though.</br></br></br>    <br><br> From what I've seen, the game itself is too meme-y and shit </br></br>  <br> I've heard it's actually the best telltale game they've done compared to Walking Dead and Wolf Among us.

I.E. There might be an instance where someone shoots him, without Hey Ya! he would die but with Hey Ya! the guy would miss the kill shot but still severely wound him.</br>  <br>I just watched Bloody Stream OP and it convinced me it was worth watching/reading</br>  <br>I think the Telltale game has better humour than the ACTUAL Borderlands games. Those, well at least 2 and the pre-sequel, are full blown "meme-y" and really unfunny most of the time, though they do have their moments</br>  <br>Heard the name, thought that it sounded fun.<br>And it was.</br></br>  <br>Didn't Kira say he named his Stand Killer Queen? I think they choose the names themselves.<br><br>I mean, be honest. If you had a Stand, would you come up woth an original name, or nickname it a reference to something?</br></br></br>  <br>first two parts are short enough, read them, SC anime is a faithful adaptation so you can watch it instead, Kakyoin dies</br>  <br>Every main villain stand is terrifying either in appearance, in ability or both, even to a stand user.</br>  Can one actually attack Gionro/GER if there is something that doesn't target Giorno specifically? Like The Sun or something. Giorno would be affected, but it's not a specific, targetted attack. Or could GER negate that too?  <br>I'm guessing that you can negate GER if you don't try to attack it but do it accidentally.</br>  <br>Weather Report might be able to to with oxygen but that would really only work in an inclosed area.</br>  Not 100% Jojo related, but...<br><br> Standing in line  <br> People behind me talking about there could be a head transplant by 2017 <br> I look it up <br> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/He<wbr>ad_transplant</wbr> <br> We can have DIO in 2017 </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>anything that is suppose to harm giorno is set to 0</br>  <br><br>It is.

It has infinite range and the fictional characters have all their abilities from their stories and even when something impedes them, they use cartoon logic to circumvent it. There is no way to overcome this stand without the prior two above<br><br>- Notorious BIG is completely indestructible and immortal. No action except for Zeroing it, D4C clone cancelation, or Killer Queen Bomb 1 can possibly defeat the stand once and for all. <br><br>- D4C Love Train is here because outside of Tusk, ball breaker, and potentially Cream, nothing can possibly do any harm to Valentine. All actions will be redirected.<br><br> God tier <br>Made in heaven is here because all stand below it on the list can just be overpowered by its super speed, time manipulation, and the affects of time speed up on the user. Universe ending is something that can overcome just about anything<br><br>- Cream is capable of dispatching anything into its dark dimension to erase them. The user technically never has to leave the dark dimension to see or could just fly upwards out of any possible enemy range before reassessing the next trajectory of the dark dimension. <br><br> High Tier <br>- Bite the dust is an instawin on anyone who learns about kiras boner, sheer heart attack is almost unstoppable, and bomb 1 dispatches and implodes anything that touches it. <br><br>- King Crimson can see 10 seconds into the future, skip 5, letting it always know whats coming and able to skip anything it doesn't want. Only against forces of nature beyond it like the higher tiers can possible stand against this.<br><br>(will continue)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>To reverse the infinite rotation that Diego gave him.</br>  <br>Could be worse. The only person I know who reads Jojo didn't get what Killer Queen referenced. I mentioned the band Queen and he just thought Killer was slapped on to the front of the stand's name.<br><br> captcha wants me to select clam chowder and ramen as "soup" </br></br></br>  <br>To me the idea never held water in the manga since Jotaro and Dio were just levitating without even moving their legs during their Stand rush.</br>  Why does nobody bring up how fucking out of character it was for araki to go full smut with the Scarlet/Lucy facesitting, like hot dang.  <br>Fanservice and to have Scarlet fall asleep without falling over all of a sudden or saying that she needs to sleep.</br>  I'm on the bait fight in Part 7 and everything just seems to be getting gayer and gayer as time goes on.  I don't mind, it's hilarious. <br><br> Johnny screaming Gyro's name constantly <br> "I can't trust anyone but Gyro!" <br> All the penetration and ball-touching <br> Johnny starts to enter Gyro's body forcibly </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Keep reading. There's lesbian gay.</br>  Why do animefags get mad when you spoil shit in the manga?  <br> High Tier continued <br><br>- Chariot requiem can turn stands against their users, put people to sleep, swap their souls, regenerate, and can only be defeated if the user attacks their own shadow. If this was used offensively by polneraff and not be a rouge stand, it would be nearly impossible to counter without being in the higher tiers.<br><br>- Tusk is only in the high tier because its Elder God ability, Act 4, can only be used when on a horse and the range of the infinite speed bullets and the stand is only 10 meters. So while it is capable of going toe to toe with things on the higher tiers, it has too many requirements that could easily be dispatched and force johnny back to act 3. <br><br>- World / SP's time stop ability makes their offense undefendable against. Without being one of the higher tier stands, Timestop can't be countered. <br><br>- Heavens door has amazing potential, but very limited range. Either by looking at it or being touched can it activate, and even with its near infinite capabilities, that range keeps it from being any higher. <br><br> OTHER SHIT PEOPLE KEEP ASKING ABOUT <br><br>- Hand is only mid tier because while it does have the same capabilities as cream, its very limited. Only 2 meter range, and its surface area for erasing is much smaller being only its hand. Also unlike cream it can not fly or protect its user completely with its deleting. <br><br>- I agree, Weather Report should have been put in High Tier, because Heavy Weather alone is a broken power that trumps all other stands. And then after that there is its massive pool of "weather" related abilities. my bad. Weather Report is High Tier.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Stop making tier lists when you don't even know powers of stands. KC can skip 10 seconds.<br>You are fucking stupid.</br></br>    are there jonathan and gappy versions of this?  <br>Lucy's husband came to help him with a horse. That didn't happen. He used that on the gyro's corpse's crate though.</br>      <br>Hmm, I can't really remember but I do remember that the spin was affecting him to the point where he couldn't ride a horse properly.</br>  <br>I don't know, but if you give me the original I could make a version for every JoJo</br>  <br>I never saved the original, sorry<br><br>there are versions of each except for jonathan and gappy.</br></br></br>  It is Joestar or Joester?  <br>The moments where DIO stops time only to get BTFO are hilarious. There should definitely be a version of this in the BD's though.</br>  <br>Toaster</br>  <br><br>Holy fucking shit your tier list is fucking retarded. Green Baby is not even broken. Anything with hax can kill it. Bohemian Rhapsody is a shit stand and cannot 1v1 any stand that has a gimmick.<br>Cream and The Hand can erase B.I.G.<br>Cream CANNOT eat Love Train. The Hand can.<br>Made in Heaven shits on Bohemian Rhapsody. But it is not even that good compared to others in "high" tier.<br>Cream is a shit stand. I don't know why you even put him in "God" tier. <br>BtD should be higher.<br>KC is superior to Bohemian Rhapsody, D4C Love Train, MiH, Cream, BtD and Green Baby. It's the second most broken stand after GER.<br>Tusk Act 4 is used with a steel ball here<br>ZW/SP is also superior to any stand in the upper tiers. I don't know why would you even consider MiH is better than ZW/SP<br>Heaven's Door also shits on upper tiers.<br>The Hand can teleport itself by erasing the space between. Cream sends something to a different dimension. The Hand erases it completly. Which means Tusk Act 4 or D4C Love Train would get erased.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   another shit tier general filled with anime babies <br><br>Please cucking die</br></br>   Dio moves to a setting as unlike the ocean as possible after spending a hundred years trapped there (the desert is hot, dry and bright) <br> Jotaro becomes a marine biologist and spends a lot of his time (presumably) in places like seaside Japanese towns and Florida, near the ocean, after defeating Dio <br><br>discuss</br></br></br>  <br>What's there to discuss?</br>  <br>So Dio don't like to get wet?<br><br>Like a cat? And egyptians love cats!</br></br></br>  <br>indeed<br><br><br>How does that make you feel?</br></br></br></br>  <br>If he didn't like water so much then why the fuck was he in Florida</br>  <br>Hunting cute young priests.</br>  <br>That DIO doesn't like water since he was locked in a coffin in the sea for 100 years</br>  <br>Because he wanted to get back to where he once belonged.</br>  <br>- Baby zeroing cancels out anything trying to harm it save for cream and GER<br>- Bohemian Rhapsody can be activated on the other side of the world and still work. It can make superman real and is devoid of logic. its fucking way more potential than any other stand.<br>- Outside of them, D4C, and Bust the dust nothing can really kill BIG. Thats why its so high<br>- Why would the hand be able to and cream not? Same stand same ability. Both cross dimensions and remove space.<br>- Made in heaven does, but the sheer potential of Rhapsody makes it higher. being able to summon Superman and other cartoon illogical bullshit can circumvent Heaven.<br>- Cream literally never has to live his dark dimension. Only reason he did against Pol is because he didn't want to destroy the whole mansion so he had to efficiently eliminate him. Without that limitation, he could just erase all other the place for a while, then fly up high out of any stands range and then survey the area to see if he got his target, rinse repeat. <br>- BTD has to be activated via boner telling. higher tiers can circumvent this and long range stands can shit on it. <br>- Please tell me with reason how it could circumvent those without just "it works"<br>- wasn't infinite spin. His stand was just there. Gyro literally says you require a horse to super spin. And in every fight and even when saving his son from face cancer johnny has to get a horse and a running start. No horse, no super spin. <br>- Made in heaven can speed up even the time lapse of Time stop to a degree and move faster than either of them. Also its universal effects up it higher. <br>- Heavens door shit range can't do anything any of those higher tier ones. <br>- People keep acting like Hand can move around like Cream, but not, its got a 2 meter range and is limited in its deleting surface area. And even Okuyasu says "i don't know where the hand sends things it erases." same shit as Cream.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Other than fucking a twink. And how did he get stuck in a church? Surely he would have known to go back to his hotel or whatever before the sun came up.</br>  <br>DIO works in mysterious ways.</br>  <br>I tried making Jonathan with Giorno's edit<br>What do you think? Should I do Gappy?</br></br>  <br>nice pun</br>  <br>That works</br>  <br>I do not understand why this is a thing.</br>  <br> To be honest I don't either, but it's nice to have a set, isnt it? </br>  <br>He just wanted to watch boipucci read dirty books in the basement.</br>   SPIKE DIES!   <br>Everyone dies, anon.</br>  <br>Well, except for Kars.</br>  <br>Why wouldn't Cream THE STAND get affected by baby? The stand is there user is not. <br>ZW/SP and KC can kill baby in the stopped/skipped time. MiH can outrun it. Tusk Act 4 can snipe it. And no you cannot zero it or halve it. BtD can bomb it. B.I.G can kill it to before getting zeroed.<br>Tusk Act 4 can kill B.I.G. The Hand and Cream can erase it too. <br>The Hand and Cream doesn't cross dimensions. Don't spout nonsense from your ass. The Hand removes space. Okuyasu saying he doesn't know wherever they go doesn't change anything. Cream doesn't remove space. If it did things would teleport like okuyasu's. Cream eats/sends things to void dimension. Love Train is bound to dimensions and Cream cannot send it to another. The Hand can delete space which effectively deletes the barrier. Also Cream is just in an alternative dimension which means Act 4 fucks him up.<br>For bohemian rhapsody if we are not talking about 1v1 matches I don't care about it. It can summon marvel/dc gods and shit on even GER but in a 1v1 match good luck moving an inch.<br>Heck you are even saying Cream exist in "Dark Dimension" how can it delete Love Train? Cream flying around doesn't make it a god tier. ZW/SP BtD or KC simply kill the user the moment he pops his head out.<br>Tell me how can MiH or Baby avoid BtD. <br>It was super spin. No other power Johnny has can do what it did on that crate. Maybe he didn't have a damn steel ball near him when he was saving his son? Like he could leave it in the grave.<br>YOU CANNOT SPEED UP STOPPED TIME.<br>YOU CANNOT SPEED UP IN THE SKIPPED TIME<br>Time stop effectively stops any movement in time. Only reason Jotaro's timestop was shortened was his stamina. Not the MiH.<br>Baby can see Heaven's door. Gay priest can see it. Many other user can see it too.<br><br>Honestly I explained KC's stuff many many times here. In your previous post you said it skips 5 seconds. It skips 10 seconds. Learn the powers before making a stupid tier list.<br>Post limit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  araki a vampire confirmed<br><br> .@shonenjump at #sdcc2015 - "Have you seen Araki in the daytime?"

KC operates outside of time space and is unaffected by anything that happens in that 10 seconds that is not outside of time space too. It can enter Love Train in the skipped time.<br>You cannot accelerate what doesn't exist. MiH cannot speed up in the skipped time.<br>Epitaph can check whenever Cream is going to pop his head and use time erasure according to that. It can also avoid any incoming damage by simply deleting time for 1 second. BtD cannot affect KC in the skipped time. Gut punch. Green Baby cannot halve him in the skipped time.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Literally a picture of Araki outside at daytime posted every thread </br>  <br> ZW/SP is also superior to any stand in the upper tiers. <br>Star Platinum can't even beat Sheer heart attack</br></br>  <br>ZA WARUDO<br><br>a picture of him eating donut outside and "less sense" picture</br></br></br>  <br>It's heat seeking.

I didn't mean actual coins. I mean the ones drawn by Araki that appeared on the cover of the manga. I think it was just Gyro at first, but then there was one with all the Jojos.</br>  <br>I never realized that, you're not alone.<br><br><br>who is this? Shia LeBeouf? <br><br><br>Doc, are Wham!

Polnareff has triple the screentime of the main character.</br>  <br>what would it do? I always pictures Kars' stand to be some continuation of his Light Mode (it would be able to produce solar flares like tienshinhan in db, I'm not sure if I would make it a full fledged punchghost though). Some other anon said ultimate being kars would have the power to copy any stand, (I guess like Ditto?) what do you think of that?</br>  <br> remake <br>What</br></br>  Im probably slowpoke, but who has the best subs for the BDs for jojo? I have [JOJO] and [dmonhiro] or something like that and the some words in jojo's version just kind of irk me<br><br> skedaddle <br> loony <br> character clearly says a one syllable word in japanese translated as a sentence. <br>example: smokey-"no" they translate it as don't be a dope" why?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'd only seen the ovas before that.</br>  <br>Maybe a bit of both, the cover for Dark Side of The Moon is Light being Diffracted by a prism. right? So maybe DSoTM Diffracts the abilities of a Stand or Stands and picks the ones that are the most useful to Kars at the time.</br>  <br>dmonhiro for part 1-2<br>some-stuffs for part 3 but it looks like they just lost their domain on their website.</br></br>  <br>Oh. The anime isn't a remake, though.</br>  <br>The only other ability it has is being a Ramiel ripoff.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=vSO<wbr>4lUpCtzs</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>I thought SomeStuffs at first, but they use stupid words too. Like Joseph talking about the Dio picture. "From this asshole's neck down". Would Joseph seriously say "asshole" isn't he supposed to be saying "bastard"? They also translate Yare Yare Daze as "Jesus Christ". Somestuffs have shit font too.

A man strives to get direct mastery over things either by understanding them or by compulsion. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to indirect mastery, namely through a man; all her direct mastery being limited to him alone. Therefore it lies in woman’s nature to look upon everything only as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything else is always a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends, consisting of coquetry and pretence. <br><br>Every one who can see through a sham must have found this to be the case.

Grave of the Fireflies was really disappointing and I regret I didn't watch it years ago, watching Only Yesterday now. Pretty good, but the past scenes aren't really up to par with the rest, and the heavily romanticized agricultural propaganda aspect bothers me a bit, sometimes I wish I was more ignorant of the cultural context of some anime I watch. <br><br> without any yuri undertones <br>Is this bait?</br></br></br>  <br>give totoro a roll it was pretty dark</br>  <br>Watched it already, but just recently too.

That's awesome.</br></br>  <br><br>Bonney is BB's rape slave now.</br></br>  <br>With this it means drake is Kaido's ally or member of his crew now?</br>  <br>The only (ex)-marine I can see joining them is Kuzan.</br>  <br>well, he's with Blackbeard now.</br>  <br>training with Rayleigh was the safer way. It doesn't negate the gains that can be made by just going off into the new world and doing it the dangerous way battle after battle<br><br>Again. Look to Law for proof. And he got to sit in an ice castle as a shichibukai instead attacking yonkou ships like Kidd did.<br><br>He lost an arm for it and probably some crew members but you are crazy if you don't think Kidd is at /least/ as strong as luffy is right now.<br><br>That's 2 years of new world battles.<br><br>think about the progress the strawhats made with 6 months - 1 year of grand line battles.<br><br>Zoro had some of his best improvements made when his ass got kicked and he was dying<br><br>Luffy as well. The reason Luffy opted for the training wasn't because you can't learn in the new world.<br><br>it was because he realized how foolish it is to go there when he isn't ready and potentially lose crew mates. he had finally grew up a little bit after ace death.<br><br>If he saved Ace he most likely would have met up with everyone in those 2 days or so and they would have did it the same way Kidd did it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>For now, but do you really think he'll stay with them for the rest of the series?</br>  <br> safer way <br> battling ginormous animals that take kong dongers to defeat day in and day out with changing environemental conditions </br></br>  <br>Finally something happens.<br><br>This arc was terrible.</br></br></br>  <br> battling ginormous animals that take kong dongers to defeat day in and day out with changing environemental conditions <br> Bluffy still hasn't mastered his Gear form </br></br>  <br>fuck off with your stale meme</br>  <br>Rayleigh laughed but I am sure he had the island coated in his CoO waiting to save luffy if need be. <br><br>It was the safest harshest training ever.<br><br>It's akin to military training.

However I believe he will join the revolutionaries. They seem a better fit for his goal of paying back Akainu.</br>  <br>bet you will say the same after the next arc<br>just drop this manga already</br></br>  <br>didnt he leave like 3/4 of the way through the training? meaning luffy was able to manage on his own without protection</br>  <br>These chapters are always good because they tell us about the whereabouts of people everywhere. What is there not to like ?</br>  <br>I hope there is going to be a Revolutionary arc at some point.<br><br>Luffy needs to meet his dad already and go on adventures with Sabo.</br></br></br>  <br>Akainu will be the biggest fuckup fleet admiral in history if Fujitora joins the Revolutionaries<br><br><br> run off one of your best assets in aokiji <br> fujitora makes you look like a fool on DDMNN <br> back talks you in front of a bunch of marines and the only thing you can say is "y-you better fix this fujitora <br> joins the revolutionaries and tells them all of the navy secrets <br><br><br>No luffy mastered the basics in 1.5 years. He was done.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So is Sabo going to become a recurring character now? It seems like he's more than willing to go out of his to help Luuffy even if he doesn't like it. I wouldn't be surprised if he starts secretly trailing the Strawhats, or gets some other revolutionary to keep him updated just to make sure they don't get into too deep shit  <br>I thought it was pretty good for the majority of it, though resetting everyones positions once bird cage started and the dwarves were fucking pointless and tacked another 10-15 chapters we didn't need onto it.<br><br>The Doflamingo fight was really poorly handled though. I've preferred practically every other sagas final battle to Doflamingo's thanks to all the distractions, "I'm not really done yet" attacks from Law, Doffy's refusal to use his signature techniques on Luffy because Oda wrote himself into a corner, and that weird shit with Trebol that didn't really pay off.<br><br>As a whole this Pirate Alliance saga has been decent but I wouldn't rank it above Baroque Works, Impel Down, Skypeia, Water 7 or even Thriller Bark. It's sort of a low-middle tier.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> mastered the basics <br> done </br></br>  <br>Yes that's what Rayleigh was there to teach him. Once he knew Luffy could handle himself without the training wheels he finally left.<br><br>We know he was there when luffy was using hardening and gear fourth. The basics are pretty in depth</br></br></br>  <br>Eh, I still preferred this fight to the Enel one.</br>   Kid <br> Croc mention <br>Good. Now I just want to see Law's reaction, the Heart pirates' reaction, and Luffy and Sabo having a good talk. And Doffy's eyes but that isn't going to happen.</br></br>  I liekd the arc, but the last third or so just felt horribly drawn out<br><br>Also what the fuck happened to Bellamy</br></br>  <br>Sabo left already, or is close to leaving.</br>  <br>Bellamy is kill</br>  <br>but he still needed gear 4th to take down those animals, he was sufficiently trained in it to the point he could survive day and night without rayleigh, those monsters werent a walk in the park even at the end of his training</br>  <br>no, she's the revolutionary armys relief station</br>  What was that about Kuzan joining forces with Blackbeard or did I just read a shit translation?  <br> And Doffy's eyes but that isn't going to happen </br>  <br>The fucking pacing was horrid.<br>Reading the arc through again now that it's almost ended makes it a lot better read and I'm actually liking it now.</br></br>  <br>Guys Akainu and Aokiji are battling it out for Fleet admiral!</br>  <br>he apparently helping them out, not confirmed for crewmember just yet but definitely doing some shit with them</br>  <br>Fuck that, he has never once contacted Luffy in all these years and now this? If I were Luffy I wouldn't be really pissed if he were to take off again without taking at least a couple minutes to catch up with his lil bro first.</br>  <br><br>Luffy, Law and the others straw-hat will probably leave with them.</br></br>  <br>*would be</br>  <br>Apparently the best way to say good bye to family in the one piece world is not to say anything at all<br><br>They all seem to randomly appear and not say anything<br><br>look at dragon.

This chapter was full of dialogue from the Gorousei, Akainu, and Fujitora, all of whom speak with either rather difficult-to-understand dialects or complicated vocabulary. This is the reason some other translations out there are confusing. If any of you have any questions about the content of this translation, please don't hesitate to ask me. I'll do my best to answer. <br><br> PS: Yes, it really does say that Kuzan joined Blackbeard. At least, it says that that Gorousei dude thinks that Kuzan joined Blackbeard. His true intentions have obviously not been revealed yet. <br><br>He could just be using them.</br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br>  I remember there were talks about Kuzan joining either the revolutionaries or Black Beard a long time ago.<br><br>What chapter was that speculation based on?</br></br>  <br>I would certainly hope so, I can't really see Kuzan joining them for any reason.</br>   tfw we won't see doffy for a good 100 chapters or so   <br>It wasn't drawn out at all you fucking fag<br><br>If you are having issues with the pacing, wait until you have a volume's worth of chapters to read, then go read. You'll find that there are ZERO pacing issues, it's just that the bridge chapters make it seem that way when reading weekly. Oda generally doesn't give a fuck about having a twist every single week</br></br></br>  <br><br>Back during Dressrossa where Luffy meets Burgess and talks to Blackbeard over the Dendenmushi, Blackbeard mentions not trusting Aokiji which led people to believe Kuzan/Aokiji had joined him.</br></br>  <br>the whole arc was underwhelming piece of shit with boring fights but maybe this will redeem it</br>  <br>Well then, next time you're in for a treat!<br><br>Fujitora runs around for Law/Luffy, finds Sabo and revs instead!<br><br>A bunch of combatants and civvies lay about in a castle, hang up pieces of rubble for decorations and scrounge the dust for food and drink at the party!<br><br>Zoro gets lost trying to find the booze, finds half the crew and Caesar fucking dead off the coast of the iron bridge!<br><br>Will Asakura Hao become the Shaman KIng? Tune in next week for Flint the Time Detective!</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The arc had tons of useless detours and padding.<br>Dressrosa alone is 1/8th of One Piece's run. That's fucking massive for a single arc not much bigger in scope than the Alabasta arc.</br></br>  <br>I don't wanna see them get someone super overpowered like that personally. I want to see them get someone strong, but not godlike that will train along side them and power up to become unstoppable like the rest of them did.</br>  Yeah, fuck Rikku.  So is Fujitora fucking going to pursue the LawHats or will he ask Akainu to suck his cock?<br><br>That last comment isn't quite clear.</br></br>  What would the reaction be if we catch up with the rest of the crew and find out Sanji was beaten by Big Mom off-screen  <br>so guys now that the 2 year grind is over, what did you think of it? who was your Favrorite officer agent? for me it was Diamante, those steel spiked balls reminded me of don krieg but even cooler</br>  <br>Sorry, meant for <br>I'm tired.</br></br>  <br>I'd kill myself</br>  HOW THE FUCK DID AKAINU GO FROM MARINE HQ TO MARIJOIS IN LESS THAN A DAY?  <br><br>Beta as fuck.</br></br>  <br>Isn't it ? There's no doubt in my mind he's leaving the Marine.</br>  <br>I don't think there'll ever be a SH as strong as Zoro and Sanji (and Luffy ofc)</br>  <br>He is a man of honor. No way he will kill off the guys he just admitted saved Dressrosa.</br>  <br>Jinbe</br>  <br><br>yea but then it would look like shit for the marines. Lose 2 admirals in 2 years.<br><br>Powerful people don't grow on trees.<br><br>If we just wanted to denounce the Shichibukai system we could've had absalom broadcast shit to other islands. It didn't need to be the admiral.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>elite officers were shit imo, except vergo. <br><br>favorite officer easily senor pink</br></br></br>  Kaido incoming!  <br> not much bigger in scope than the Alabasta arc. <br>You're fucking stupid. A crimelord taking over a country is soundly beaten by a crimelord who already runs a country and a huge worldwide crime syndicate working with smuggling, gunrunning, devil fruit creation &amp; that serves TWO emperors<br><br>And in terms of shit that happened, we had Sabo come back from the dead, Luffy become an absolutely insane power both combat and politically, arguably the strongest warlord goes down, a whole country has to team up to help beat Doffy<br><br>The scope is fucking HUGE compared to Alabasta. Alabasta was dragged out, not this. As much as I liked portions about the animals of Alabasta and the comedy, it was such a slow fucking arc</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>he will either die before he can join or zoro and sanji will have surpassed him by then.</br>  <br>Marine HQ is right by the Red line.
