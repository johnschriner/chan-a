I think of them as different.  <br><br>No.</br></br>  <br>?</br>  <br><br>The Imperial Guard was there from the beginning.</br></br>   “It was because Misaka was with me that I made it this far. She kept my trembling legs moving, supported my heart as the pressure bore down on it, and kept me in a position to make jokes. With Index, things may have been too focused on magic. With Othinus, it would have been exclusively about Magic Gods and having a clear understanding of their strength might have crushed me with despair. It was because it was Misaka. I survived this long because she was the one by my side. She saved my life and you want me to tell her to back off because she’s in the way? Who the hell do you think you are!? You don’t understand the first thing about the human emotion of this human world, but you’re trying to act like some all-knowing god!!!!!!”  <br><br> “So take it back, you piece of shit Magic God!! If you badmouth the person who saved my life any more, I’ll go punch you just like you want!!”  <br><br> “I don’t care if you’re covered in magma or if you’re over one thousand degrees! Imagine Breaker? I don’t need that for you and I don’t care if it doesn’t work on you! I don’t care if my fist melts away or if my entire body bursts into flames. Yeah, if you don’t shut that filthy mouth of yours right this instant, I’ll keep punching you until you finally do!!!!!!”  <br><br>Based Touma.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>At 50 kph no less.</br>  <br>Normal, Mikoto has a big fan base but people who hate her are even more numerous.</br>  <br>And wasn't he right about that?</br>  <br>No, because Touma planned on doing that running shit regardless. Misaka just made it better on the mind</br>  <br>Watch them give us two seasons of an Accelerator anime.</br>  Was this the shitiest writing in the entire One Piece bibliography?  <br>That's not Tsukki.</br>  <br>Kagura, tsukki, Tama, Sa-chan even Otae is loved in Japan... So every female character in Gintama is best girl</br>  <br> Otae <br>That last chapter tho</br></br>  <br> Otae  <br>I can do without her. Kagura and Tama for me.</br></br>  <br>See Sorachi writes the best female characters... I personally think that Nami is a great character and Oda writes her and every female characters very well but people expected to see more of Nami in this arc and were disappointed that she didn´t do much. <br>But they are forgetting how well Oda wrotte Nami in Skypea arc.</br></br>  Killed in production.<br>We can all relax.<br><br>http://screenrant.com/scarlett-joha<wbr>nsson-ghost-in-shell-financing-atte<wbr>mpts-falter/</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  <br>she looks a little more muscular here</br>  <br>That's just the most practical way to store your loli. Where do you keep yours?</br>  <br>I doubt anyone remembers firefly/serenity , and wouldn't GitS get compared to blade runner as well. You know, why don't they just remake blade runner?

About the "being ready" part is what we call "tenpai".<br>2 - The hand must accomplish at least one yaku.<br>The easier way to explain what a yaku is, is comparing it with "poker hands", as even those are called yaku in japanese. For now, just keep in mind that yaku is some kind of a special pattern that gives points (multiplier) to your hand.<br><br>You may call "ron" or "tsumo" when the first rule is accomplished. "ron" is what you call when you win your hand through the discard of an opponent. "tsumo" is what you call when you win your hand by self draw.<br>But, you can't win if the second rule is not.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is it time for more mahjong lessons?  How do you feel about this now being a thing?  <br>Heroes is its own canon. Based off of each of the PVs, the Heroes world is set within a game world that the characters get sucked into and become the avatars.<br><br>Of course, I may be alone here, but I think a Heroes anime would be kinda cool since it'd be a justifiable way to ignore power levels.</br></br></br>    <br> 10 hours <br>This thing would end before he even transformed</br></br>  <br> Toriyama said people should consider the mmo canon. <br>He never said that. People consider the MMO canon because Toriyama created its backstory setting and some of the present stories, but there has never been any statement about its status being on par with the manga's.</br></br>  <br>oh u</br>  What if she is secretly the lewdest one of them all?  <br><br>http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=51563549</wbr></br></br>  I wish Anna had gotten pregnant.

Airing in about 3 hours.  <br>You are my friend whether you like it or not.</br>  <br>That's bullshit, he shitposts against girls that aren't tsundere too</br>  <br>Kirino wanted his brother D, I dont like that louise girl</br>  <br><br>So your precious "tsundere" hater isn't even a true tsundere hater after all, just a random hater. That makes you even less believable.</br></br>  JESUS CHRIST MODS, DELETE THIS META SHITPOSTING  This watered down, censored butchering, is why the anime industry sucks so bad now days.<br><br>I can deal with 95% of the new animes every season consisting of moe/ecci/shounen/mild shounen-ai pandering for female otakus, usually devoid of any depth whatsoever. That is, if they didn't fucking tone down and censor the rest of the 5% that actually has some sort of interesting premise. Hell, why not turn the MC and his soldiers into fucking high-schoolers while you're at it... If you moeify, censor and remove any adult &amp; mature themes, you might as well adapt another fucking Light/Visual novel aimed at beta faggots. There are thousands of those out there, go make animes out of those instead of showing us this butchered crap.<br><br>Remove the gore, violence any sort, nudity or any sort of mature themes, and the series suddenly looses any appeal it had from the start. What's Berserk, Gungrave or say Black Lagoon without it's graphic violence and devoid of any mature and explicit content whatsoever? Fucking boring and pointless! Might as well watch swordshit moe online instead, because the difference is suddenly minimal.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It isn't just about the blood. It is the cut scenes that help with things like expanding characters.</br>  <br>Omedetou anon-kun! You are one of us now!</br>  <br>Ebin, simply ebin newfag-kun.<br>Repeating memes is all you can do.</br></br>  <br> It's not as if it was ever implied the numbers were small or insignificant <br>It sort of is. The anime makes it seem like maybe a hundred or so soldiers came through the gate, when it was actually many tens of thousands. Simply put, they destroyed any sense of scale regarding the attack, and it's only ever made clear after one week.<br><br>It's not a good idea to over censor something to the point that it's unclear what happened, and then pretend it's alright because you explained the events once the mood is already gone.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Look mangafag, the series doesn't need excessive gore in the first place. The minimum amount of blood would silence most critics, doesn't have to be HOTD style.</br>  So who's your hentaifu?<br><br>I can't decide between these two beautiful ladies.</br></br>  <br>where's this from?</br>  <br>Japan</br>  <br>It's true though, a better story, better scenes, better endings overall.<br>There were of course some scenes in TA2 that are fucking great but as a whole TA3 is better.</br></br>  <br>yw</br>  <br>fair enough, what had happened to that demon form that was at the end of 2 was it ever explained what happened to it or was it just reworked into that purple for?</br>  ITT: Characters who improved their respective series tenfold once they were introduced  <br>Yes, not enough material from the manga, which has ended.</br>  <br>It's the VA. She plays the role brilliantly. I don't know if I would love Yamada as much with a different voice.</br>  <br>I agree. Sometimes the seiyu just hits the character spot on. I feel the same way with Dekomori.</br>  <br> ;-; </br>  At least tenfold.  Best manga you've ever read?  Yotsuba and Vinland Saga  <br>Best character design and based TOSH</br>  Heroes are Extinct  <br>OW! <br><br>Be careful with that, its sharp.</br></br></br>    Prisma Illya.<br><br>How did this shit QUALITY happen? I'm really nervous for the series now.</br></br>  <br>this is my fetish</br>  <br>The negro loli has a pretty good looking neck</br>  <br>She is blandly designed and doesn't stand out. She is indecisive and boring. Miyu and kuro both have actual personality and have unique appearances.</br>  <br>She has the most delicate skin with fluffy hair and the softest facial expressions. She is the most innocent, childish, pure and "pink".<br>For a lolicon, she is the ultimate choice.</br></br>  <br>Fair enough. I guess I'm just not into loli enough.</br></blockquote>]
