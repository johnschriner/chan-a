He hates them, but he needs friends. He also doesn't like his sister/cousin that much <br> Then with his "friends" they go around raping girls near school. He just watches and masturbates while smelling some stolen panties. <br>That's all that I remember, some might be even wrong, but this story is kinda particular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  maybe i should learn chinese  http://exhentai.org/g/788325/2ba395<wbr>5daa/<br>Joe...

Only in 2D, and only when the character has a very feminine appearance, either as a futa or as a trap(usually shota) I do find the penises on these characters attractive, but more in a cute kind of way.<br><br>These are some of my favorite hentai:<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/766328/6bfdbb<wbr>8834/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/821274/fc4138<wbr>9fe7/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/405171/39c957<wbr>cdf5/<br><br>I don't think that liking 2D males counts as being gay?</br></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br></br>  <br>Traps (except Bridget) are gay. FutaxFemale isn't though, FutaxMale is</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>Soon you wont even care</br>  <br><br><br>Futa is fine for me but for some reason I can't get into shemales.</br></br></br>    <br> bridget isn't gay <br>That's like saying Poison isn't a tranny.<br><br>Soon enough you'll be upset there isn't enough gay porn. If you are upset by this, leave now.</br></br></br></br>  <br> shemales <br>What even is the difference? If you mean in like 3D porn, that shit is disgusting and you should be burned at the stake for watching it.</br></br>  <br>Everyone is gay for Bridget, ergo it's not gay, you fucking faggot.</br>  <br> That's like saying Poison isn't a tranny. <br><br>That's 100% confirmed since the recent character bikini contest though. There was no dick in sight.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Futas still have the vagina, and more than likely the ability to get pregnant.</br></br>  <br>Looks like he's streaming now.</br>  A most interesting research reports guys. <br>I was checking sadpanda and tried to find the oldest doujin ever uploaded there. <br>It's a C28 (1985) doujin, pic related, featuring Urusei Yatsura and Creamy Mami.<br>So I kept seaching and a found a few interesting things. Most of the uploaded doujin from 85 to 90 featured... Dirty Pair. Apparently at some time japs HAD good taste.<br>Then Ranma happened and dominated the scene until C43, when there's the first major boom due to Sailor Moon. Notable mentions to Ah megami sama, Tenchi Muyo and Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water (proving Gainax was meant for this for a long time) <br>The big surpirse is that it was expected to see a lot of Evangelion stuff from C47 onwards, but Sailor Moon kept the lead for almost two editions. Only after C50 Evangelion really bloomed and we got all teh Rei.<br><br>So yeah. Of course it doesn't show all the stuff that was made back then, but it's rather interesting.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who cares, all of the art from back then was terrible.</br>  http://live.fc2.com/62975839<br>dat manly voice.</br>  <br><br>There's a few that are good, but the issue isn't the art being terrible, it's it being completely underwhelming and unarousing. Pretty much everything had to be done by hand in those days, so the works lack any kind of complexity, right down to typesetting.</br></br>  <br> that chat <br>Yeah, linking this here is a great idea. Leave the poor guy alone.</br></br>  <br>You're entitled to your opinion, but I must disagree. <br>Especially considering we had people like Satoshi Urushihara there around that time</br></br>  <br>He needs to know his followers.</br>  <br>Bikini contest? No dick? <br>Never before have two sentences so quickly raised my hopes and dreams then shattered them completely and utterly.</br></br>    <br> "do you like kangoku gakuen?" <br> haven't seen it <br> "it has big tits and big asses" <br> yeah </br></br></br></br>  <br>aunt</br>  <br>Older Sister or Aunt and young boy. <br><br>And sister and brother when they are both kids is good too.</br></br></br>  <br>Poor Minazuki getting assaulted by english.  Now I wish I knew Japanese so I could ask him which Squid Sister from Splatoon is better. <br><br>Although that sort of question would probably get a better answer from Ryou. I think that guy was literally streaming splatoon on the same site the other day.</br></br></br>  <br>souce? the artist looks like bubuzuke but i couldn't find any with the incest tag</br>  Maybe one of you guys can help me. A year or two ago I found this fetish manga that I really liked, akin to My Balls!, but at the time it was incomplete or I simply couldn't find a translation group that had finished it. I remember very few things about it but want to stick my nose in it again. Let's see what I can remember and see if any of you can recognize it.<br><br> rather standard appearances, not cartoony like My Balls! and the MC wasn't grungy like that BDSM manga who's name also escapes me <br> rather frequent sex but there was actual plot moving between the smut. Though I think it may have been classified as actual porn <br> not a single fucking scanlation group did the whole thing. It kept getting picked up where someone else left off, carried for like five chapters, and then bounced to the next group. I think Batoto had like the first few chapters, aggregator sites had the next few, then I had to start bouncing around different scanlator sites to try and get more <br><br>All I remember about it was enjoying both the characters and the porn. Nothing else because it as a pain to check up on since nothing else updated there.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  does anyone split comics into each chapter?  <br>My fucking dick</br>  <br>Out of pity for your incompetence at searching, here you go:<br>http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;t<wbr>id=793014<br><br>or http://sukebei.nyaa.se/?page=search<wbr>&amp;cats=7_28&amp;sort=5</wbr></br></br></wbr></br></br>  <br> open link <br> suddenly DRAGONFORCE <br>well, if that's what he wants to play.</br></br></br>  <br>Father and son<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/756147/ca602b<wbr>9123/<br>http://exhentai.org/g/471709/5bd91b<wbr>4828/<br>http://exhentai.org/s/058b870782/41<wbr>6215-14</wbr></br></wbr></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Other active:<br>http://live.fc2.com/44894410/<br>http://live.fc2.com/39763436/</br></br>  <br>I honestly felt like asking if he might like dragonforce at some point then the guy just starts playing their stuff.

Shouldn't be an issue.</br>  <br>everyone's got problems. better he obsess over hentai then shoot up a school or something.</br>  <br>I agree.<br>Your problem is making terrible false dichotomies.</br></br>  <br> Just the person I was wondering to question about. Seeing that Lilith had never had any concerns with you sharing a patch for one of their titles. Seems they might truly have no legal bone to pick with anyone as long as people don't share files containing their original work. Which your patch is stated clearly does not. With regards to not only what you're sharing but also to that one guy making translations for Murasaki and the IZms. So it might possibly confirm that Lilith won't get pissy at people translating their games as long as you don't go around sharing cracked versions of their stuff.   Though I wonder if ShindoL himself knows of such a translation existing, and if he minds. Would be nice if Monster Survive was translated someday. </br>  <br> brown <br><br>Nice.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask ShindoL on his patreon or twitter. <br>He's American so he knows English perfectly well.</br></br>  <br>Like this?<br>http://exhentai.org/g/826907/3426b5<wbr>b133/</wbr></br></br>  Is there a way to find the metadata for an expugned gallery ?

I only remember parts of the story. It's about a couple 16-18 years old that's into anal. The guy used to play that japanese anus poking prank on girls in his elementary school years and that's how he met his gf and they developed their anal fetish. iirc it was part of a anal doujin collection, not sure if all stories were by the same artist.<br>Been searching for almost 2 hours now I'm afraid it might have been purged from the surface of sadpanda.</br>   finished fapping <br> saw this http://exhentai.org/g/837233/b9554e<wbr>acf6/</wbr> <br> had to fap again <br>Fuck my dick hurts now, but it was worth it.</br></br></br>  <br>Share it anon, if you found it.</br>  <br><br>I think its in analism</br></br>  How do you guys finish?  any one remembers that one h-manga with an exhibitionist trap doing cam shows online, all is going well, until his classmate came to his dorm and recognized the room.  <br> makes it convenient to get all the chapters in one place till someone does a re-edit. <br> makes it convenient to get all the chapters in one place <br> all the chapters in one place <br>that kills my drive to reedit shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In you're mom.</br>  Oh boy<br><br>http://exhentai.org/g/837180/d2fe97<wbr>6d48/</wbr></br></br>  <br>It keeps saying login failed<br><br>Oh well this could cure my shitty porn addiction</br></br></br>  <br>Stop using plugins.</br>  I just recently got into panda.

Otherwise paypal is just essentially a credit card company/bank by itself. No reason it shouldn't work with amazon.</br>  <br>I'm pretty sure it would be amazon saying no to paypal considering how much product they move. Paypal takes a cut from every purchase they process. Why would amazon ever give that cut to paypal when they already process payments themselves?</br>  <br>Because paypal could attract people who would have otherwise chosen not to purchase anything I guess.</br>  <br>Doubtful.

"The gender of the one being unfaithful" has literally nothing to do with whether something is netorare or netori.<br>And even if, for some reason, they decided that male:netorare would be the de facto netori tag, completely ignoring the actual tag definition, God knows it doesn't work in practice: http://exhentai.org/g/828637/ff6cc3<wbr>a536/<br> male:cheating <br>And on further research, apparently cheating = netori according to the wiki: http://ehwiki.org/wiki/cheating<br>But yet netori is listed as a synonym of netorare on the netorare page: http://ehwiki.org/wiki/netorare<br>Both of those pages, by the way, say in bold to not confuse them with each other, while both actually having the same fucking word as a synonym.<br>The more I look, the worse this gets.

Censoring assholes is the least of their concerns.</br></br>  Give me 3 reasons why Akane isn't best girl.  1) Ukyou<br>2) Ranma-chan<br>3) Kodachi</br></br>  <br>Ranma is best girl.<br>Ukyou is best boy.<br>Fuck this story for not going best route.</br></br></br>  <br>onnateki Ranma<br>Yoiko<br>Pigtailed girl</br></br></br>  <br>There was only one best route, and what you named wasn't it.</br>  Doesn't get along well with Ranma, so their interactions are just the stock "I hate you but secretly I love you" with no decent progress over the manga's long lifespan.<br>Not a good fighter compared to others.<br>Can't accept criticism well, like how she's always pushing her terrible cooking, meaning she won't change at all.</br></br>  <br>Ranma x Ryoga is best, everyone agreees</br>  Her personallity is literally worse than shit.   shitty cook <br> short hair <br> worst figure </br></br>  1. Shampoo <br>2. Ukyo<br>3. The fact that she can be a royal pain in the ass.</br></br>  <br>1) Unreliable tsundere that prefer the "punch first, ask question later" approach even if she's the weakest of the cast<br><br>2) Her sisters are way hotter and better in their own fields<br><br>3) When your so-called fiancee is (litteraly) a better woman than you, you know you suck</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Okay. <br><br>1. built like a stick<br>2. dumb as a brick<br>3. talks like a hick</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked her better in Inuyasha</br>  <br><br>I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings and also did a good job at showing how the characters had leveled up in their skills. I think the series would have ended better if the manga had them get married instead of LOL so random, wedding ruined.</br></br>  <br><br>So right.</br></br>  <br> I thought the final arc actually did cut to the heart of Ranma's feelings <br>The final arc of a series that ran for almost 10 years and 38 volumes. Too little, too late.</br></br>  <br>The fishing rod of love chapter was great</br>  <br><br>Yeah, but it's not like Takahashi was writing berserk or something. Ranma 1/2 was build around a status quo that was interrupted for comedic effect. In the intervening the characters grew stronger and more unique skills, which was good for a payoff when the time came but the majority of the series isn't about building the arc it was about situational comedy.</br></br>  <br> In the intervening the characters grew stronger and more unique skills <br>What did Akane, the heroine and main love interest, get?</br></br>  <br>Even Kodachi is better than Akane</br>  <br>she got more useless</br>  <br><br>Sad and true. She never had to fight anyone and really her whole kempo schtick died off along with Dr. Tofu so there really was no purpose in making her a martial artist. Actually, since some arcs depend on her getting kidnapped it would be counter productive.</br></br>  <br>Plus, with Shampoo, she can be really cute.</br>  <br>there was an even better route than that it's ranma x  ranma </br>  <br><br>She's insultingly dense.</br></br>  <br>You are aware she's more intelligent than she acts sometimes, right? If you want to talk insultingly dense, Azusa Shiratori.</br>  <br>!!!! Ranma no BAKAAAAAAAAAAAAA</br>  <br>I think she acts like a dumb ditz around Ranma cause she wants to be all perfect wife and stuff, when combat happens she suddenly gets serious</br>  <br>Because nips actually preferred a chinese amazon over her.</br>    <br>damnit why does the best girl have to be a boy?</br>  <br>Hard to argue against that.</br>  <br>Sssssh, it's a girl right now</br>  <br>it's unspoken rule of genderbent MC being the best girl</br>  <br>1.)Because Shampoo is love<br>2.)Shampoo is life<br>3.)Any girl named Akane in any series is always shit</br></br></br>  fapping to Ranma never gets old, a true semen demon  <br>Indeed, she is.</br>  <br>Best part is, no risk of pregnancy. Throw some hot water, all the female internals disappear. Throw some cold water, bam, fresh female at the start of her cycle.</br>  <br>She's lucky that she can boil water right.</br>  <br>1.<br>Its impossible to sleep in the same bed with her</br></br>  Ranma is already best girl.  <br>2.<br>She has a bad temper</br></br>  <br>She looks cute with her hair down</br>  <br>Damn straight</br>  <br>And she can kill a man with her cooking</br>    You can only pick one, short hair is delicious.  Always in style  <br>Long hair easily.</br>  <br>Not a bad choice though I think short hair looks good on ranma.</br>  <br>Oh lord, house wife Ranma Chan...</br>  <br>She's mean and is dishonest about her feelings.</br>  <br>Yeah, not nearly enough for my heart or my dick</br>  Would you a magically amorous ranma  My favorite.  up  <br>tomboy<br>short hair<br>tsundere</br></br></br>    <br>Yes</br>  <br>The idea of a house wife Ranma Chan seems oddly adorable.</br>    <br><br>One of the few pairings that can please fujoshi and otaku at the same time.</br></br>  <br>That, and she would look even more adorable with a Kasumi-like ponytail.</br>   One of the few pairings that can please fujoshi and otaku at the same time <br><br>Nope, just fujoshi, its a terrible pairing that never made any sense.</br></br>  <br>Meant to quote <br/></br>  <br><br>I like her fashion sense, at least. Cute 80s outfits.</br></br>  <br>It's the universally agreed best pairing</br>  <br>It is?</br>  Where can I download the english manga in a high resolution format?  <br> Give me 3 reasons why Akane isn't best girl. <br>She can't swim.<br>She's a violent maniac.<br>She's cute only when she smiles.</br></br></br></br>  <br> You can pick ONLY one, <br>Fixed.</br></br>  <br>1. Violent<br>2. Not cute<br>3. Brute tomboy</br></br></br>  Akane gives a bad name to tomboys everywhere.  <br><br>Eh, I'dunno, I liked her  in Street Fighter. </br></br>  <br><br>Stubborn as a mule<br>A little delusional</br></br></br>  People who like Akane have no imagination and only concern themselves with the most vanilla pairing.  <br>They're just slaves to the author's ghastly self-insertion.</br>  <br>I always laughed when he'd abuse P-chan</br>  <br>I thought Kagome from Inuyasha was the self insert?</br>  If you mean the best Akane then sure.  <br>Kagome, Akane, Shinobu. all her self inserts. I think the grandma from Rin-ne is also one.</br>  <br>Shes not<br><br>-Female Ranma <br>-Shampoo</br></br></br></br>  <br>I can think of worse.</br>  <br>At least Lum is actually likable and attractive. That, and she has the excuse of her cooking being alien in origin.</br>  <br>maybe i like being a slave</br>  <br>To be honest, she has all of the traits that people don't like in Akane. Mainly being violent and short-tempered.<br><br>I don't think her cooking being for aliens is much of an excuse either. There's a point where she tries cooking for Ran but Ran ends up having to correct her on even the simplest of tasks.</br></br></br>  <br>trips confirm.</br>  <br>I want to taste Takahashi's cooking to see what it's like.</br>  <br>Not all of Akane's traits. She never accused anyone of rape for starters, plus that ep regarding Ran was more of a goofball scenario/one off rather being a recurring theme run into the ground. Plus, Lum is actually very sweet in general, and the main reason why she gets mad is because of Ataru's assholish behavior. Akane, and to a much bigger extent Naru Narusegawa, can be rude to people that are nice to them on a regular basis and have few likable character traits.</br>  <br>  She never accused anyone of rape for starters <br><br> Fair enough on that. She has more grounds to do so since there are stories in which she nearly is raped.<br><br>  Ran was more of a goofball scenario/one off rather being a recurring theme run into the ground <br><br>It's more illustrating why she's not a very good cook instead of playing it entirely for laughs.<br><br>  Plus, Lum is actually very sweet in general, and the main reason why she gets mad is because of Ataru's assholish behavior. <br><br>Fair enough on this as well, although I suspect she's probably killed people caught in the crossfire.<br><br>On the topic of Ataru though, she seems to have a thing for making him cry.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Came in here to post this</br>  <br>Honestly, I doubt it's terrible just because she's used it as a gag a few times.<br><br>Although given that she's made enough money off her work to last her until death, I wonder if she even has to cook for herself these days.</br></br></br>  <br>Tamako is too based to be a self-insert.</br>   people talking shit about Lum <br><br>Lum is an angel, Ataru deserves every shock he gets.</br></br>  <br>Lum's awesome!</br>  <br> few times <br>It was every time, anon. Maybe except for few.</br></br>  Ranma really is one of those cases where the worst girl won.<br><br>I wouldn't even say it's her fault entirely. Her and Ranma are like oil and water. There's no chemistry there, and they never really develop.</br></br>  <br>She cut her hair.</br>  <br>Lum a shit</br>  <br>Fav episode</br>  <br>1.) tsundere done wrong<br>2.) ugly hairstyle<br>3.) shampoo best girl</br></br></br>  I fapped so much to this anime, specially Shampoo.  <br>I don't think I've seen any terrible cooking gags in Rinne yet.</br>      <br>An angel wouldn't try to manipulate someone's feelings.<br><br>But anyway, regardless of the negative things I say, I don't hate Lum. She does really love her darling and he loves her.</br></br></br>    <br>Why is Ranma such a bad influence?</br>  <br>Shampoo's shower scene in Desperately Seeking Shampoo...</br>  <br>Those breasts and the well done animation...</br>  <br>Oh page, we come to meet again<br>And now I'll fap</br></br>  <br>Ryoko a s exy. Would add her into my harem. </br>  <br>Of course you would say that, Ataru.</br>  <br>Indeed</br>  <br>She's cute even when she's mad</br>  <br>- She's a annoying tsundere cunt<br>- Shampoo and Ukyo are even better<br>- She's practically a gorilla, ugly, rude and violent.</br></br></br>    <br>Fuck off Ryoko, you're just a jew bitch.</br>  <br>Ryoko =  Shampoo <br>Ayeka =  Kodachi <br>Sasami =  Ukyo <br>Washu =  No smart girls in Ranma 0.5 </br></br></br></br>  <br>But a female gorilla would have no problem with letting the male dominate.</br>  <br>replace Kodachi for Shampoo and we have a deal</br>   would you make your rival cry?   <br>mah nigga, that's a great douijn</br>  <br>Makes me feel shitty whenever I jack off to it...</br>  <br>I feel that way for just about every Ranma doujin.</br>  <br>Nabiki would probably be the closest to smart but she's more about business than SCIENCE.</br>  <br>And would charge you extra for everything you do.</br>  <br>Mostly because Ataru makes her cry often</br>    <br>Of course, this IS Nabiki we're talking about.<br><br>This has me wondering though.

Pedophilia is attraction to prepubescents. <br>Puberty is about physical develpment and not tied to age (though in 3D is correlated with it).<br><br>Therefore if you want to fuck an 18 year old who looks 8 you are just as much of a pedo as someone who wants to fuck an actual 8 year old.<br><br> And before some retard starts screaming "MUH 2D!" the other anon implied it is, I just don't care enough to fight his assertion. <br><br><br>And Heterosexuality leads to raping women.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People who actually rape and molest children aren't actually pedophiles.<br>They're not attracted to sexy lolis, they're attracted to the power they can exert over them. <br>They say they're not bisexual/homosexual, but don't even care if it's a sexy shota.<br>They're really fucked in the head mostly from some childhood trauma.<br><br>Real pedophiles are attracted to attractive lolis and have enough sense and shame to not act upon it or at least try to get off to it in way that doesn't hurt the child.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>were they gay</br>  <br> People who actually rape and molest children aren't actually pedophiles. <br>Rape, no.

Did it sell badly?  <br><br> no slice of life blue rose and tiger  <br><br>fuck it hurts</br></br></br></br>  <br>They made a movie instead</br>  <br>No, it sold 27k and then 2 movies came after it, the most recent one airing a little over a year ago. There's a concert coming up to celebrate the 4th anniversary of T&amp;B and Sunrise made a short new anime to commemorate the event. It's also possible they may announce a new season there just like they did with Bahamut s2 announcement at its orchestral concert.</br>  <br>Nope, did very well. Merch was also very good because of fujoshits.</br>  <br> thread </br>  <br>I imagine tokufags contributed a lot too.</br>  <br>  Bahamut s2 announcement  <br><br>WAIT WHAT<br>How did I miss that!?<br><br><br><br>I figured if they made 2 movies and did a concert it must be selling alright. I'm not surprised fujos are really into the merch; I just hope that doesn't spill over.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>When's the concert?</br></br>  <br> WAIT WHAT <br> How did I miss that!? <br><br>Dude, that was almost 3 months ago.<br><br><br>Sept 19-20</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>3 months ago? Shit, time really flies when you're working. <br><br>The last I remember of Bahamut news was that the director was saying a second season would probably have new characters or something like that.</br></br></br>  <br><br> neglecting the hottest piece of ass on the show <br><br>another reminder Kotetsu is loosing brain cells as well as his NEXT in old age</br></br></br></br>  <br> Hottest piece of ass <br>But that's not  Fire Emblem. <br><br>Really though, I thought Agnes and Kotetsu had some nice rapport. I would've liked to see more of that, a lot more of that. And more of Dragon Kid and Ivan Ninja growing up and learning to balance being young and being heroes, with advice from the older heroes.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br> Dragon Kid growing busty breasts and being pressured into whoring herself out like Blue Rose <br><br>That would make for a godtier episode.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Not really, it was pretty much entirely fujos.</br>    <br>  He can only last 30 seconds </br>    <br>The series sold over 29k per disc on average. The second movie sold over 40k overall. Around the time of the movie's release bandai was strongly maintaining that everything from that point onward depends on disc sells. Just a look at the numbers would have you assume they got what they wanted on that point. After a year of silence it's been announced that Bandai established another animation division separate from Sunrise studio called Bandai Namco Pictures. This got the fans of the series carefully optimistic that it might mean that the new studio might want to do something more with the franchise than Sunrise who in the end only ever cared about gundams (which it kept the right to), only to have all their hopes shot down at the recent AX where Ozaki, the new director for BNP stated that "nothing is in the works pr plans at the moment" and that at the earliest anything could come out is between 5 and 10 years into the future.<br><br>tl:dr S2 officially never</br></br></br>      <br><br><br><br><br><br>the fuck u fags doin?<br><br>this is a tiger and bunny thread.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> 30 seconds of super powered dicking <br><br>That's more than enough</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's posting evidence that Sunrise/Bandai do do series that aren't just Gundam. <br><br>Tiger &amp; Bunny 2016, after Gundam Orphans goes on mid-series hiatus.</br></br></br>  <br> hoping for Tiger and BR <br> shipping Tiger with women in general <br>does it hurt to be this retarded too?</br></br></br>  <br> Dragon Kid developing feelings for Wild Tiger as she enters puberty because he's the manliest man around her and gives good advice to her life problems <br>Just like my doujins!</br></br>  <br> Tiger <br> Not being shipped with women <br>He even got turned on by teenage runaway supervillains waving their legs at him.</br></br></br>  <br>GO NEXT</br>  You know what would've been cool? <br><br>Get some of the villainous NEXT that were in jail to become second-league heroes, or going through some kind of rehab program episode where we see them adjusting to normal civilian life. The girl who can smell money could undergo an internship as an investment counselor, the digging guy could join the Second League, etc.</br></br>  <br>They are also going to do a live viewing of the concert in over fifty cinemas around the country because of the humongous interest. In Japan T&amp;B is as huge as ever, the merch is still selling, doujins are still printing, T&amp;B brand restaurant is still running, events still fill stadiums. The only problem is that bandai doesn't give a fuck, and it's been pretty much reassigned from one licence hoarder to another like  says.</br>  <br>It's not like they're ever going to make any pairing canon anyway</br>  <br>Saria is lower than prostitute.</br>  <br>Fuck you.</br>  <br> Restaurant <br>Is it just another generic Japanese family restaurant, or does it try to at least serve real American food?<br><br><br>But Fire Emblem/Iron Bull is canon.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> But Fire Emblem/Iron Bull is canon. <br> Iron Bull <br>What? You mean Rock Bison?</br></br></br>  <br>I keep forgetting his name. The only thing I remember about him is that he's known as the "Bull Tank of the West Coast" and that he owes Kotetsu $20.</br>  <br>Tiger is a sexually inept manchild with a 0.00000000001% sexual drive and little to no demonstrated interest in women. Even his own fucking VA wondered how did this man managed to procreate, I suspect rape. The situation you're bringing up is the one and only moment in the entire series + movies where it's hinted that he is not entirely neuter. Although the context of the situation was less about his interest in a woman per se, and more about the fact that he is a timid bitch and the girl could in fact dominate him or distract him with the leg trick and get away.</br>  <br>Maybe he's just an M and his wife was an S?</br>  <br>a virgin won't know the difference</br>  <br> Tiger is a sexually inept manchild with a 0.00000000001% sexual drive and little to no demonstrated interest in women <br>sounds like 99% of japan</br></br>  <br> Is it just another generic Japanese family restaurant, or does it try to at least serve real American food? <br>It's a Tiger &amp; Bunny-brand restaurant which was first launched to promote the movie. Interior and all the food they serve is in various ways T&amp;B themed. It was supposed to be replaced by another series after 6 months of its run yet here it is, still running after three years. The interest was so big that after a while it was re-opened in a semi-permanent location.<br> real american food <br>no, it serves magic japanese food like this golden ryan sundae</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's because he's meant to faithfully reflect their society.</br>  <br>as expected of a man from oriental town</br>  <br> The last I remember of Bahamut news was that the director was saying a second season would probably have new characters or something like that. <br>It will still have Favaro and Kaisar actually.Their new designs were showed at the same concert as the announcement. It were still sketches though so they might still change.</br></br>  <br><br> Blue Rose <br> virgin <br><br>fuckin kek</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, that might be true of it now, but at the point where I went into 4chan hibernation that was some comment the director had made at some panel. I'm glad to see Favaro and Kaisar's adventures will continue, I just hope Kaisar hasn't lost everything by turning his back on Jeanne.</br>  <br><br>Tomboys like Dragon Kid always grow into fine titty monsters.<br><br>Blue Rose is going to show her the ropes on how to make the best of her new figure.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying Dragon Kid won't get a sex change operation once she reaches the age of majority and become a boy </br>  <br>What the fuck, that's fucked up. Sometimes it sucks to have an original property.</br>  <br> nothing is in the works pr plans at the moment" <br><br>That's just formality bullshit right? Just to save face and not hint at anything and whatnot right?</br></br></br>  <br> its been 4 years since tiger and bunny <br><br>Goddamn</br></br></br>  <br>In a way it's better that you missed out on that period of time because the announcement came out some time after an exec interview in which an idea of a S2 has been shot to the ground and buried. Oh man, the mood at the time was gravely.<br>Honestly my last shred of hope pertaining to T&amp;B is Ozaki acting likewise and giving some troll reply to throw people off but I dunno, it sounded like he was trying to be professional and earnest about it.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much. The Japanese are a little stupid when it comes to advertising, and until everything is finalized they won't announce a thing. Otherwise, one or the other parties involved will take offense and go "Why you reveal this!? How dare you!? Deal's off!"</br>  <br><br> still in the same apartment browsing tiger and bunny threads on the same computer from 4 years ago <br><br>fuck my life</br></br></br></br>  <br>Cool, I honestly can't imagine them just throwing this franchise away. It literally prints money like no other, and 4 years later is still a big thing especially for something that doesn't really pander to otaku in the usual sense. It's unorthodox as hell and I want them to keep it. I'll keep hoping.</br>  Was Lunatic/ the Honorable Judge Yuri  a chuuni, or was he just playing theatrics to strike fear into villains?  <br>Why not both.</br>  <br>The guy was hallucinating his dead dad, he definitely wasn't fully together. However, he is stable enough to hold a government job.</br>  <br>It usually takes an unstable man to perform government job.</br>  <br> just hope Kaisar hasn't lost everything by turning his back on Jeanne. <br>At least he has his true love</br></br>  <br><br>This is different than usual. For the first time in literally years he hasn't been vague about it but gave a concrete answer. I think maybe he got fed up with tantalizing the fanbase and just came out straight that no, they're not doing it. This has happened on the largest US anime convention where he was the executive representative of a business company who's also said BNP's primarily focus will be producing mainly new anime. Although the talk about new anime stands in a bit of contradiction with the fact that they also acquired Sunrise's other properties and that T&amp;B has been made their "flagship property".<br>I don't know about you guys, but all the charade around an S2 has worn me out, it's best to just accept it and move on. As long as they keep producing some quality side content like the MJ manga, I'm good. I didn't like Rising very much anyway, it didn't convince me that T&amp;B's creators can come up with interesting stories anymore.</br></br></br>  HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ <br>HEIL AINZ</br></br></br>  <br>Is this like the 6th thread tonight already?</br>  Needs more LN translations  <br> AINZ <br> NAZI <br>Fuck off, i bet that bony guy has a nazi minions.</br></br></br>  <br>I fucking wish /a/ was back to 15 threads a minute speed.</br>    I finally figured out what I don't like about Albedos armor. It makes her look like a heartless.  Someone post the gif in which he is laughing.  <br>That looks like a space marine for some reason to me. Must be the beer.</br>  Excuse me,<br><br>Best girl coming through</br></br>  tfw you will never pledge your loyalty to papa bones  I originally hated that the first 2 episodes were just explanations of everything, but now that we're 2 more in I'm actually glad I got a lot of the background info out of the way. Now I can just enjoy the show as they continue with a little new info each episode.<br><br>Also<br> Heil Ainz </br></br></br>  <br>But that's just a chair. Real best girl here.</br>  <br> Retards <br> Best anything </br></br>  <br>The literallywhofags have arrived</br>  <br>Even though I read the LN I only just realized why people keep calling her Chair.</br>  Originally wasn't even going to give this show a try due to the CGI in the trailer. Glad I did though because I am loving this fucking show.  Looking forward to Albedo getting Boned in doujins   <br> that <br> best </br></br>  <br>Not sure if this had already been made but I had a mighty need to make a stitch from the ending for a possible vertical dual monitor setup</br>  It's pretty ironic how most of the complaints about this episode is how Ainz being so OP means there's no tension in the series but I've yet to come across anyone calling him a Gary Stu. Apparently people DO know the difference between being OP and being a Gary Stu. Who knew?  If you think the best character is anyone other than PA or Albedo, you're solely mistaken. All others would probably turn on Ainz the minute their creators show up.<br>Automatic disqualification from the Best Character contest.</br>  <br>like 90% of the complaints about this series are people throwing cheap bait against the wall to see what sticks. the other 10% generally being op haters or lnfags (myself included) that feel a lot of the skipped dialogue is losing out on world and character building.</br>  <br>What if my favourite character is   Brain  </br>  <br>Good choice. He's going to outGazef Gazef himself pretty soon.</br>  <br>Only thing I dislike is the CGI angles looking like robots and the lack of intense sound. I expected the black hole to make noise, though I can accept that.<br>The manga reaction faces got my hopes up in certain regards</br></br>  <br>Thanks</br>  <br>The series is surprisingly easy to depend, especially considering the OPness of Ainz. I guess making the title OVERLORD guaranteed you'd know what the hell you were getting yourself into.</br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>The intimidation of the quiet black hole was pretty great though.</br></br>  <br> I expected the black hole to make noise <br>clearly you don't understand how black holes work.</br></br>  I'm glad the next two episodes will give us a break from action on the scale of this and episode 3. The next time something on that scale happens will be the end of volume 2 and 3 right? So, say, episodes 7 and 13?  <br>I think things like this are so rare that I'm just savoring getting to see an intelligent evil lich in action. If the whole show was about him just floating around murdering weak assholes it would be a problem but they're obviously not going for that.</br>    <br>Looks nice, especially with him sitting in the abyss just waiting like he's the last boss of Nazarick.</br>  <br>The way I see it is 5 is adventurer meet up, 6 Battle with the forest king, 7 set up for zombie apocalypse, and 8 Devil May Cry: skeleton edition.</br>  <br>HEIL AINZ<br><br> I expected the black hole to make noise </br></br></br>  <br>Be happy that we are getting full chapters instead of individual parts like usal</br>  <br>I lost my shit</br>  <br>That was quick.</br>  <br>Shut it chair</br>  <br>She's gonna be a main character in the next few episode anon</br>  <br>Need a complete webm of him summoning the angel of bait holding a fish hook scepter. Then Ainz deleting it with a sage.</br>  <br> Talkin shit about Ainz's chair. <br>You'd best take that back about Nazarick's top Overlord approved seat.</br></br>  <br>but the best way to defeat bait is by ignoring it, not saging.</br>  <br> tfw my webm is getting popular in this thread <br><br>I wish Papa Bone would be proud of me</br></br></br>  <br>Good job, anon. Just wanted to spread your ingenuity.</br>  <br>Main character who fucks shit up because she can't follow simple instructions <br><br> implying saying Shalltear is best girl is bait </br></br></br>  <br><br>at least its better than defeating bait with "OP is a fag"</br></br>  So let me get this straight, other players landed in the past, and they were the ones that taught high level magic, well, "high", to people like the Theocracy? Does this imply the magic is inherently the same mechanic, just fully customizable here? Will Ainz start making his own spells?  <br> OP <br>that's like saying "omg he killed that rat! so OP!"</br></br>  <br>How much dialogue has been skipped? I've been following these threads on and off and kept reading that it has been adapted pretty well so far.</br>  <br>It has, but you have purists who feel like skipping anything at all is an unforgivable insult. Then they get all huffy and think you're shitting on the source material by saying it's fine to skip stuff, because they take it so personally. <br><br>They're already going really slow by taking 4 eps per volume, any slower and they'd barely get through volume 2 by the end of the cour.</br></br></br>  <br>Tons, the author is really generous with inner dialog.</br>  <br>Maybe magic is like engineering; all the parts have always been there, you just need to know how to put it all together.</br>  <br>Well, it's certainly possible that no magic existed before Yggdrasil players showed up and taught them long ago. What do you mean customizable though? As far as I can tell these guys are apparently casting the exact same spells Ainz is familiar with. And while they might be "inventing" spells it may just be them learning to duplicate untaught Yggdrasil spells that the original teachers didn't know.</br>  <br>There's magic Ainz doesn't know of. The contingency magic that murdered the one dude they were torturing.</br>  <br><br>Thanks, maybe I'll actually read the LN then, I think I have the mega link saved somewhere.</br></br>  People are saying that Demiurge misunderstood Momonga when he was talking about the treasures. What exactly did he misunderstand  <br>Even though that this is a faithful adaptation, I find it hard to not be disappointed when some core dialogue is left out.<br><br>For example, even an extra three minutes would have laid the background for what happens in Volumes 2 and 3. All Madhouse had to do was, say, have only one song play during episode 1, and remove the ED during episode 4.</br></br></br>  <br>Ainz said the world conquest would be enjoyable as a joke but Demiurge took it literally</br>  <br>True, but don't forget that while Ainz has an absurdly high capacity at 700 spells known, Yggdrasil has 6000+ spells in all so he might not be familiar with them all. Hard to say one way or another though the contingency magic and magic chanters inventing spells seems to prove what you say.</br>  <br><br>Should I just start Vol 1 or was it covered pretty well?</br></br>  <br>Start Vol 1.</br>  <br>Is that why he was also shocked when Ainz said it while they were flying?</br>  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=4Xu<wbr>kocjXhSs</wbr>  [ ]<br> "Don't you gimme your love and passion" <br> not "Won't*" <br>I can't help but be triggered by engrish in songs that have potential.</br></br></br></br>  So, is Stronoph, or whatever his name is, a reincarnated player?  <br>Yes</br>  Why do you guys like this show so much?<br><br>Seems kind of plain to me.</br></br>  <br><br><br>This was some bad translation. How the fuck does 'Banzai' translate to 'Heil'?<br><br>Would have been better translated as 'Long live Lord Ainz'. Jesus these subs are bad and my Japanese skills consists of a few years of school.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN<br>ALL HEIL AINZ OOAL GOWN</br></br></br>  <br><br>What if she actually does not want you to give her your love and passion?</br></br>  <br>I'll bite. No I think its literally don't, she doesn't want it. (She has ainz you insect)</br>  <br> that pic <br><br>I kek'd.</br></br></br>  <br> fucks shit up <br>Coming from a chairfag I don't think that means too much anon</br></br>  <br><br> inflexible <br><br>shit maid, can't even bend her over your desk<br>0/10 can not bang</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Now that I read that a third time, that actually makes sense. I still prefer "won't" through.</br></br>  <br>Standing up sex is best sex.</br>  <br>Albedo.<br>Shalltear.<br>Cocytus.<br>Papa Bones. <br>That's why.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Ainz has a throne not a desk.</br>  <br>Personally, it's the character interactions. The Guardians are so loyal to Ainz that it's just terrific. Equally entertaining are the Guardian's relationship with each other. Episode 2 of the anime as well as Volume 3, the drama CD, and the last half of Volume 4 all display (to me) fantastic interactions. Fight scenes are pretty chill too.</br>  <br>Science is the study of our universes magic<br>Pretty cool when you think about it that way</br></br>  <br>I totally support Ainz taking Naberal as his wife after Albedo forces him to marry put a real ring on that finger. I mean heck, people already think they're doing the buisness behind the scenes.</br>  <br> Interesting Characters <br> Theme (MC is the OP evil overlord but evil neutral) <br> Skellington protagonist <br>   He chooses to use minimum force in order to carefully explore the world until the situation calls for it <br>Other than that, its Log Horizon except less about being a tactician mayor and more about being a conqueror.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> its Log Horizon <br>Wow it's like I'm really on Reddit......</br></br>  <br>I wasn't aware Overlord was about a socially retarded outcast, glitching raidbosses</br>  <br>Are you new?</br>  <br>It's pretty much the same wish fulfillment bullshit as Danmachi. Nice Skeleton aesthetic, though.</br>  <br>Ainz has already daughter-zomed the entirety of Nazarick. Only CD, and Chair Jr. have any hope now.</br>  <br> Danmachi <br>Oh okay, you're just spouting random shows that fall into a similar category.</br></br>   Heil <br>Does he have a nazi minion? If no then nope I ain't calling mr Bones that.</br>    <br>He created a a level 100 Nazi uniform doppelganger, does that count?</br>  <br>You know he does anon</br>  Will this show get an s2?  <br>Hopefully not, because its gonna be almost all lizardmen and then uncle insect rekting them.</br>  <br>If it sells well enough</br>  <br>He has a desk too.<br>Bitches love desks.</br></br>  <br>Considering he cares enough for the game and not being a normalfag like his other guild members are, not really far from the truth.</br>  <br>Well, it is in the OP</br>  <br>But anon chairs aren't supposed to be bent over desks</br>  <br>And he will do the Gendo pose on the desk in volume 9</br>  <br>He has a job, why would he make a rule for his guildies to follow, that he wouldn't? They all just left the game after being burned out from getting everything required to make the guild staff. Just because he kept logging into the game, doesn't mean he's socially inept.</br>  <br>Of course not, silly.<br>Chairs go under desks.</br></br>  <br>I would still like to see that.</br>  <br>It's fine, you can admit the real reason you want vol 4 animated.</br>  <br>It's Funi, right? What can you expect from a bunch of retards wearing traffic cones on their heads?</br>  <br>Why hasn't he bothered thinking about going back to his world if he had friends and family to go back to? He seems to care about the game than his real life which started the whole story to begin with, being fussy that people in his guild left him only realizing that they didn't leave without giving a damn about the times they shared. A normal faggot wouldn't have sperged and slam the table dramatically and would've just logged off. Arguably, he could still be socially inept when he has godlike abilities that earns the respect and fear of everyone around him.</br>  <br> Ains <br> Ainz <br> Nazi </br></br></br>  <br>MIND BLOWN. AINZ IS ACTUALLY GOING TO SET UP THE 4TH REICH.</br>  <br>Because he isn't in the game, he's in a different world.<br>And that world happens to be far better than the 22nd-century hellscape he came from.</br></br>  <br>His job is a soulless office worker job in a future world that seems pretty shit, he gets along fine in life but he cherished his guild and could never let go of that.<br><br>He's interested in going home, but there is absolutely no hint at all how to do that.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Doesn't he specifically say that he has nobody to go back to?</br></br>  <br>Yes, in the intro in fact.</br>  <br>This was explained in, like, the second episode, maybe first. He said that he doesn't have family or friends outside of the game. All he does is wake up, work all day, then go home and plays the game until he sleeps.<br><br>He said that was a really shitty life.</br></br></br>  <br>He's never expressed interest in going home. He says in the first volume that he has no friends or family to go back to in the real world.</br>  <br>Yep, his family's dead and his only freinds were his guildmates</br>  <br>Then get his ass kicked by Zaryushu or Hamsuke.</br>  <br>He's a magic caster, he has to sage.</br>  I want to do illegal things to Narberal!  <br>It could be worse.<br>He could go down to an autoattack from Victim.</br></br>  Discuss.  <br>Check the archive, there's nothing left to talk about.</br>  Its a boring 3 min clip that has no meaning. <br><br>/thread</br></br>  Blu-rays when?  <br>  Dat moment when you realize the internet has ruined your life... </br>  <br> Lol tits wtf Japan so random!! <br>Casuals  like OP  flocked to this and ruined it.

That arc was still actually funny.  <br>At least the toilet thing was somewhat reasonable, this is some next level shit.<br><br>Well fuck. I can kind of see why there were only five OVAs .</br></br></br>  <br><br>I remember someone posting the procedure images on how to hide the dick and emulate the appearance of a pussy actually works.</br></br>  <br>Holy fuck is this real?</br>  <br><br>I need to know how to do this</br></br>  <br>i have been in 4chan and desuchan  for a long time and i dint know this</br>  <br><br>Just google penis tucking. All I remember is that it involves super glue if not tape.</br></br>  <br>I remember seeing this  on /b/ years ago </br>  Just some of the author's "memorable" quotes<br><br>"Ryoutarou Shiba (one of the greatest novel writers in Japanese history)'s Above the Clouds is boring.

The fuck is his damage?<br> Could he be a bitter asshole that just does whatever out of hatred for life?<br><br><br> He's not wrong about all of those <br> Oh boy. That's up for debate, to be kind.<br> he taught college math before he started drawing <br>For 5 months, and that's hardly an achievement to that gives you the right to boast how smart you are.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Interesting.. to be honest I didn't know this guy, I'll check how's glden boy</br>    <br> "We have one thing in common, we both hate schools.

The twist makes Shyamalan movies seem like masterpieces.</br>  <br>Of all the things I thought would happen today, I didn't think the overwhelming desire to beat the shit out of the author of Goldenboy was one of them.</br>  <br>Tokyo Daigaku Monogatari is a lot like Golden Boy, started out ok but then Egawa stopped giving shit and went full retard with his sex fetish.</br>  <br><br> "I walk around showing my penis without shame" <br><br>Seem's like he just like to fuck with people</br></br></br></br>  <br>So the guy knew that anime/manga was a mistake much before Miyasaki</br>  <br> "Doraemon ruins children" <br><br>This guy can see the future</br></br></br>  <br>And this is coming from a guy obsessed with fetish fucking schoolgirls.</br>  <br>Oh there's no doubt the guy's a full fledged troll, you can't possibly be this delusional without being on purpose. <br><br>But at least he should take his manga profession seriously. The guy never finishes anything, does shit job, and calls quits once bored. <br>If he was actually a good manga artist, being a troll on TV wouldn't be an issue. <br><br>He's hated by other mangaka because he doesn't put his money where his mouth is.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  He draws himself as this tall handsome hunk in his own essay manga too.<br><br>Despite the fact he's fat as a pig.</br></br>  <br>He wasn't always fat<br><br>http://homepage3.nifty.com/egawa-ta<wbr>tuya/photo.htm</wbr></br></br></br>  <br>I hope my calculus teachers look like this</br>  <br>These essays were drawn after he became a pig. <br>The one I read was entirely about him showing off his expensive as fuck SLR McLaren and people saying how awesome he is. <br>Not sure how you can draw that and not be sick of yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>Yep, it became Egawa's own little condescending blog. I should've known better than to expect a sort of resolution to that trainwreck that was the last arc. It was evident that he was more interested in talking about how shit he thinks people are.</br>  <br>I need to ask, how does he even get on TV in the first place</br>  <br>Wait did this continue after the 100 chapter cuck arc?<br><br>Does it get fun again?</br></br></br>  Real Duelists respect their cards AND their opponents.  <br> that dramatic exit <br>he let Crow win right?</br></br>    <br>AWAKENMYMASTERS.jpg</br>   Arc-V has made me realize that I will never truly be happy <br><br>It hurts to not have my own crude and strong girl.</br></br>  <br>Do not despair, anon. I'm confident there is a Ruri out there for all of us, you just need to search for her.<br><br>Unless you're fusion scum.

He doesn't have any weird quirks to his sociopathy aside from Doppio but every action he does just reeks of some sort of complexity addiction that he just comes off as a hard to like villain for the wrong reasons. He seems moronic outside of combat but he's not supposed to be.</br>  Miss me yet?  <br>This. That last episode made up for some of the shortcomings found in the series. Shame she had to die there and then because she really warmed up at that point.</br>  <br>Yeah, but that this was a way of conveying the message that the writers were trying to show.
