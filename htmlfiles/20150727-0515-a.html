[ Have you ever been to one? Would you ever go to one?<br><br>I've never been to one, but I've thought about it since I do like anime and it'd be fun to be around people with similar interests. But then I see things like these live streams where there's a bunch of teens acting awkward as fuck that puts me off.<br><br>What do you think?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The only reason to go to any convention is to steal things.</br>  Fuck you OP. Now back to the yakuza.<br><br>They are the ones that finance most of japans entertainment industry. Sex sales, and is a cornerstone of yakuza buissness since the mieji era. No way in hell is some whiney college kid in america going to change the industry.</br></br>  <br>I've been to Anime Expo like 4 or 5 times and it's pretty cool.</br>  It's ok if you're just interested in the industry panels and dealer room.<br><br>All the community stuff is really hit or miss, (mostly miss) and there are an inordinate number of deviants of all types in the fanbase.</br></br>  <br>How do I do it</br>  <br>git gud</br>  <br>Twice to local conventions when I was a teen. Never again.</br>  not anime   Have you ever been to one? <br>No<br><br> Would you ever go to one? <br>No. It seems like everyone there is autistic and there are zero things to do aside from talking to these people.</br></br></br></br>  This is based off going to AX.I wouldn't go alone. If it was a convention in any big metropolitan area, I would try my best to carpool. Parking costs a lot. There will be a lot of waiting in line. It's more tiring than you'd think it'd be. <br><br>I really didn't see that many cringey teenagers. The biggest cringe I guess was the incessant Just Do It meme I heard from them throughout the entire con. And yea it was pretty cool being able to strike a conversation about anime with whoever you were standing in line with.</br></br>  <br>I mean the closest thing to a con I've been to was anime club at my university, and the people there acted like they were anime characters. I cringed so hard I left after 15 mins.<br><br><br>Would you prefer another waifu thread to add to the other 10 on this board?</br></br></br></br>  <br>The bad stuff outweighs the good stuff by a landslide. You have to cringe for a whole day to enjoy five minutes of smiling.</br>  <br>It's pretty much like this. I went with a friend to Anime Midwest this year and it was just bad, man. There were half as many vendors at AMW than Acen, the food was all shitty and overpriced, and the people were autistic as fuck. A good majority of the people there don't even watch anime or read manga all that much, and I could tell by their reactions to certain things and the variety of cosplay. I remember that we went into the "Why you shouldn't watch Hentai" panel and being asked what the worst anime of all time was. I replied with Glasslip and no one person in the entire room (around 100-150 people at that point, they kept leaving) had even heard of it. When I mentioned that it aired a couple seasons ago, people there were surprised that anime even aired in seasons. <br><br>As for the cosplay, more than half of all of it was either from Marvel or Homestuck, with the small percentage remaining being shitty shounen-tier cosplays, like one piece, naruto, and attack on titan. Any non-shounenshit cosplay was done by slutty girls for the sake of being slutty, and not the good slutty. Like the overweight, deformed, butterface, uggo slutty that just craves attention. <br><br>And then there was the smell.</br></br></br></br></br>  I'm going to  SMASH!  in  Sydney  this coming weekend with my  friends.   No I'm not dressing up. Cosplay outfits are too expensive.   <br><br>America</br></br>  <br>I like conventions. Me and my friends spend all weekend drunk while we laugh at shitty weeaboos and sometimes they bring over interesting Japanese guests. Like Maruyama's panels generally tend to be pretty cool, or I've gotten the chance to talk to Nagahama at a con.</br>  <br> mieji  <br>NIPPON EXPERTO</br></br>  Well if you are going to big events like AX, it's mainly buy things, attend some events that look appealing and take picture with cosplayers, without hover hands please I saw a giant Mexican dude who went through a huge crowd to take picture with these two girls and he had sweat on his face and hands that hovered so much  Anime dogs.  Arf  <br>Damn I loved this show so much.</br>  <br>/ck/ thread?</br>  <br>Woof</br>  Can Biscotti join too?  <br>Bitches are dogs too, why not</br>  <br>BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK BARK</br>  <br>I was waiting for this.</br>  <br>Gutts wouldn't eat a Menchi would he?</br>   Woof <br> Bark </br>  <br>If I ever get a dog Emergency Rations is the only name to use.<br><br>But Araki hates dogs.<br><br>Would adopt pink, waifu green, threesomes with white.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the dubbing of Excel would kill Gutts first.</br>  <br>I think the annoying nails-on-chalkboard voice of dub Excel matches her personality quite well.</br>  yourewaifu.jpg  <br>I don't disagree.

It isn't a crime for the lion to pray with the gazelle. She isn't human.

And remeber she literally has the mind of a child.</br>  <br>Who is to say the genocide of small villages isn't the natural ecological niche of Shikis? An anteater devours an entire anthill for his needs. <br><br>Shikis are not human. They are not capable of being judged by human ethics. They stand outside of that. It would be unnatural for the gazelle to judge the lion which toys with it to train its cub.</br></br></br>  <br>Lolicon</br>  <br>Implying she isn't the best</br>  <br><br> Who is to say the genocide of small villages isn't the natural ecological niche of Shikis? <br><br>then the human population would be smaller in the anime if one shiki, let alone a child shiki can bring a village to it's knee's<br><br> An anteater devours an entire anthill for his needs.  <br>exactly, for his needs to survive, not to be a giant asshole and serve some evil purpose<br><br> Shikis are not human. They are not capable of being judged by human ethics. <br>they were once human, not anymore sure but still mingle and masquerade as humans, loli bitch know what shes doing is wrong by murdering humans by the hundreds, not to survive but to have a "family"<br><br> It would be unnatural for the gazelle to judge the lion which toys with it to train its cub. <br>it would also be unnatural for a lion to murder a gazelle because it wanted something more than just food.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Either vampires are human, as their mind is human, and that's the only thing that matters, in which case she definitely overstepped the boundary of harm done that's necessary for survival, and she's not in the league of random cutthroats but in the league of nazis. Or vampires aren't human in which case they are a subject to extermination like any other kind of human-eating creature. The story perfectly shows why choosing the second option is not a good idea for either party.</br>  The town would have been fine and they would have all lived happily ever after if they just all turned into shiki.  <br>Except for those 6/7 of the population that would die, since turning into Shiki isn't a guaranteed thing and most people just die when they're killed.</br>  <br>more humans would have died even if the town was turned into all shiki since they were transporting humans from the city into the town for food.<br><br>happily for the shiki? sure<br>happily for the humans? not one bit</br></br></br></br>  <br> and is getting that emo monk dick. <br>Living the dream?</br></br>  <br>Heres an idea...one typical feeding can take around half a liter of blood. <br><br><br>Why didnt the town just donate blood in exchange for supernatural buddies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>people start talking and then everyone and their mothers know about these blood thirsty monster that want your head.</br>  <br>Herd behavior is not unique to humans. Moreover, animals kill things all the time that they have no intention of eating. Housecats regularly kill birds they have no intention of devouring. <br><br><br>Of course humans can defend themselves. That doesn't mean its unjust for shiki to murder the town though.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Europe will be fine and everyone will live happily ever after if they just convert to Islam  <br>Same thing</br></br>  <br>I disagree. The whole fucking talk by beard of rage before be tried to kill shiki loli basically was about how a village works. <br><br>I think he was telling her if they wouldve come to the towns people and explained the situation then some sort of deal couldve been arranged.</br></br></br>  <br>is there another vampire anime or manga as good as shiki?</br>  <br>Wouldn't have been more easy to just make a system to eat humans? if you give an human enough time to recover from the Shiki you can eat him again without killing him, just grab 7 humans per Shiki and eat them one per day.</br>  <br>The concept of "justice" applies to humans and humans only, by the very definition. So of course it's not unjust. My point is, if you choose that path you get mutual extermination. It's kinda like why humanism was introduced in the first place: because humans can kill each other with ease so there should be a thing to stop them, and everyone benefits from such a thing. So saying that shiki aren't human is not a good way.</br>  <br>The humans would have to be willing participants because of the way the Shikis hunted. They asked to be let into the house of their relatives and glamored them into not telling anyone. When the glamor/blood drain wears off, the humans remember exactly what happened and can go around telling people. Additionally, the next day's anemia is an inevitable byproduct of being drank from, so people would have to be willing to give up at least one day a week.<br><br><br>Human altruism is a result of empathy which is has a direct neural effector in the form of mirror neurons. It wasn't a decision; it naturally arose. Its like herd behavior. You're giving humanity too much credit.</br></br></br></br>  <br> When the glamor/blood drain wears off, the humans remember exactly what happened and can go around telling people. <br>I don't remember it ever being stated that humans remember what happened to them once it wears off, only that they're no longer under the effect of it.</br></br>  <br>I reread it recently. The first woman the doctor isolates and prevents from being drank from the next day begins to acutely remember her terrifying dreams about her dead family member asking to be let into her house. She assumes its a dream, but she has no problem discussing it and is actually terrified by it. They definitely remember.</br>  <br>Well, yes, human empathy is old. What's new is the idea that all humans are subject to empathy. Initially it was your tribe (state, religion, nation, whatever) that are human and others who are not quite human for the purpose of empathy. Humanism, however, says that everyone are human and deserve basic rights and such. When you proclaim yourself not to be human, you lose that benefit of empathy and altruism. That's why in the end of the series there were humans killing shiki casually. They didn't magically turn into psychopaths, they just didn't percieve shiki as humans. Because shiki acted as if they aren't.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128625950 <br>If it would save their lives, yes. Well most at least. But that was before half the village was killed, there was no way to salvage that relationship anymore and that's why it dissolved into a bloodbath.<br><br>Really, the Kirishiki's are cunts and destroyed any hope of peace between humans and Shiki.</br></br></br>  <br><br> Got away with what? <br>Destroying an entire village. We can at least view her as a monster that must be exterminated.</br></br></br>  <br> vampires <br><br>Vampire Anime thread?!</br></br></br>  Fuck shiki  <br>The monk sure does</br>  <br>AMEN?<br>AMEN.</br></br>  <br>I wish I was an emo faggot monk.</br>  <br>Humans didn't treat Shiki the way they did because Shiki were technically inhuman, humans treated them that way as a reaction of the way Shiki treated them.<br><br>The village has gone through so much shit and everyone's mental state deteriorated to such a degree that they had no problems doing what they did.

The stories I heard from people who actively fought in the war and all the terrible things they've seen and experienced were no different than the last few ending episodes of the show.
