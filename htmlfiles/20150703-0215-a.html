[ This is a thread for anything Sailor Moon related.    <br>Is it wrong I like OG Anime Usagi over Manga/Crystal Usagi cause she was a pig and I dig chub?</br>  <br>Its not wrong, but it is wierd.<br><br>Is it wrong if I self insert as Yuuichirou?</br></br></br>      Revolution soon, fellow xyz  <br> mfw I'm a random student who doesn't use archtype <br> Ghostrick Dullahan <br> pendulum <br> What is your purpose anyways- <br>Shut up, spring</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So that was you running for the hills like a little pussy?</br>  Born for breeding.<br><br><br>It was a tactical retreat.</br></br></br>  <br>Born for cuddling more like.</br>  <br>The hell it was.</br>  Spoiler week continues here<br><br>Eren's height is actually canon Edition</br></br>  <br> lips open <br> eyes closed <br> doesn't show surprise. </br></br></br>  <br>LM is fucking retarded. It is the definition of forced pairing just because they stand in the same panel together and on top of that they have zero chemistry aside from fighting together as clones. I don't even like Mikasa or the other two involved but EM makes more sense.</br>  <br>No one here is saying anything about comfirmation, only a few fags who says the kiss was forced and fingerpoint.</br>  <br> tumblr <br>Of course, LMfags are tumblrwhales.</br></br>  <br>So why so much insecurity that you feel the need to keep saying it was forced, when it makes much more sense and he's not Levi?<br><br><br>Nice comeback retard.</br></br></br></br>  A demon holds a book, in which are written the sins of a particular man; an Angel drops on it from a phial, a tear which the sinner had shed in doing a good action, and his  /ai/ - Idle Activities  are washed out.  <br>Fuck off pls.</br>  <br>I'm not sure how much else there actually is. I have the other one I typeset plus an extra page, but that's it.</br>    This was a nice episode that threw the girls into an interesting situation where we could see some unique interactions. I don't think people worrying about how Juri and Madoka were going to work together need to be concerned anymore. It was great how they basically kept their personalities while still playing the role in the play too. And of course, throwing Suzukawa into the Johnny/Orihime mix really spices up the side comments.<br><br>And then the next episode preview happened and I got super excited to see Sumire.</br></br>   hetfags ruling over /ai/ <br><br> Thank God we have Hibike where you hetfags were BTFO. </br></br>  What are you reading, /a/? now that shieldbro has been fully translated, minus the Do Over of Spearhero, i've been having fun tracking down unusual stuff and reading it even if I have to do it through google.<br><br>Following through awesome people that is translating them:<br>* RE:Monster<br>* Risou No Himo Seikatsu (which btw I am also checking through G. Translate, and the fact the title loosely means "My Life as a sponger in a fantasy world" amuses me a lot)<br>* Mushoku Tensei. Its technically over, but I'm still enjoying the "Icing on the cake" chapters.<br>* Overlord (also reading through G Translate, and damn the differences are huge)<br><br>Through G. Translate<br>* Gate: Thus the JSDF Fought there (did the manga stop after they get to the asylum where the MC's mom is at? the novel continues quite a bit. Is it on pause to let the incoming anime catch up?)<br>* Exploring Dungeons with my Fantasy Harem. Guy goes to a fantasy world, decides "fuck it, may as well" and starts adventuring into dungeons to get money and buy slavegirls. Some anons will enjoy the absolute lack of whiteknighting as he isnt shy about using the girls sexually, but at least in so far as I am reading, he still hasn't done the dwarf girl. I guess she would be a legal loli?)<br><br><br>* The Mao is a reincarnated Slime! - Guy reincarnates as a slime and works his way up. Im only on chapter 8 or so but it seems promising so far. Also, morbid curiosity since the author added "sex" to the codes on it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    Looks like ace combat  <br> you will never birth a whole clan of genetical modified chuuni arch_wizards <br>Why even live</br></br>  <br>That's literally Razgriz up there.</br>  So far reading<br>Tensei Shitara Slime Datta ken<br>Word master<br>Arifuerta<br>Magic Craft Master and Isekai mahou<br><br>Sadly Tls are slow so I am suffering.<br>I need more stuff to read.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   yeah we had oral when you were backstage, I asked him for anal too but Ash said there was no more time   <br>This isn't real... right?</br>  <br>The sub is fake, Ash compliments how it looks good on Serena</br>    <br>No, She's just commenting on the Ribbon</br>  <br>I mean Ash was glad Serena wore the gift he gave to her which is the ribbon</br>  After seeing so many people wank this shit off on here, I decided to give it a try.<br><br>What the fuck? I couldn't make it past episode 36. It's legitimately horrible, I don't even know how I made it this far. Does it get any better? Good enough to even actually watch?</br></br>  <br>I liked brotherhood better just because it had more Hohenheim. I can barely even remember the 03 anime.</br>  <br>Both have their high and low points. I personally enjoyed the changes in 03 anime, the big bad and the homunculi were fun with believable motivations, despite being A LOT different to the manga and brotherhood anime. Some characters are flanderized, like Kimbley, but you have a whole other series where they're awesome so who cares. While the original material has a different overall message and take on the themes explored, both can become edgy or surprisingly deep at times. I see them as completely different series, enjoyable in their own way and worth a shot.</br>  <br><br/></br>  How did it take you 36 episodes to decide you didn't like it?  <br>First, which version are you watching?</br>  Just watched kuromonogatari<br><br>This is the ultimate goodness an animus story can ever reach. <br> All stories are inferior to this kinds of self-loving story. It's the most purest form of humanism theme I have ever encountered<br><br> inb4 shinboshit go back to reddit <br><br>Anyways nicetits/10</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   1 day <br> 1 volume <br><br>Tonight, the journey ends.</br></br></br>            Have you prayed to your lord today /a/?  <br>Lina is a jobber. This guy has more sense.</br>  <br> This guy has more sense. <br><br>Yea by sucker punching someone with magic. It worked but not berry honorable is it</br></br></br>  <br>But she was a jobber because of her shitty attitude. I'll be pissed if she still acts like a wimp next volume.</br>  <br>Yotsuba don't give a fuck about honor, Tatsuya first. Tatsuya can sense any magic activation anyway so he knew but his magic was too fast.</br>  <br><br> F-Freeze or I'll maybe fire my brionac at you.. </br></br>  New Side Story?  <br>Shirou has Saber's sword while Gilgamesh is parrying him. For reasons unknown he chose not to use the Gate of Babylon or a mighty powerful shield.</br>  <br>I think so actually. It disappeared in the Ufotable version too. It was to show he was out of mana.</br>  <br>The DEEN version of that fight is just ridiculous compared to Ufotable's. Shirou summons UBW, and proceeds to use it for jackshit.</br>  <br> Gilgamesh: "Impossible!" <br><br>It really is impossible, Shirou shouldn't have this weapon in stock.</br></br></br>  <br>Isn't that a catalyst of Heaven's Feel?</br>  Drawfag Thread 1528<br><br>second rarfag's files until thread 1509:<br>https://www.mediafire.com/folder/m5<wbr>rhvc5a9bfku<br><br>Draw Friends Booru!<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/<br><br>Please help a little by tagging and uploading pics!<br>Tag list of artists and colorists: http://pastebin.com/J0dJ6gtn<br><br>Missed a delivery or sudden 404? http://archive.moe/a/<br>Drawfaggin' references and tablet guide: https://docs.google.com/document/d/<wbr>1r76FugZ2pZIE74LdSEBMwGJ7HxweawNdoG<wbr>rNT6hrOfs/edit<br><br>Thread 1527 </br></br></wbr></wbr></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></wbr></br></br></br>  Requesting colors for these pictures of Sailor Venus and Mars, please.<br><br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48328<br>http://drawfriends.booru.org/index.<wbr>php?page=post&amp;s=view&amp;id=48329</wbr></br></wbr></br></br>  So is Kusuriruriruriri actually a grill<br><br>I ask because I've never seen a female artist go ham on tits like that.</br></br>  Simple request:<br><br>Can a drawfriend please draw Fujiko (from Lupin III) doing something super domestic - like making a sandwich while wearing a tiny apron, or maybe carrying a laundry basket?<br><br>Thanks</br></br></br></br>  Requesting Sandalphon (left) playing with plushies of the Gunbuster bugs (right)  Requesting cute girls with cute huge penises  This will be a short thread.    <br>never forget. fuckers stole Christmas</br>  <br>Kaminomi<br>Seto no Hanayome<br>Chobits<br>Clannad + AS<br>FMA/B<br>Toradora<br>NHK</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nah, that's photoshopped, it never happened.</br></br>  <br>I'll fucking fight you.

It's literally his whole backstory and motivation. <br> <br>but isn't it Dissociative identity disorder he suffers from? since DID results in personality splits<br><br>the reason i think that diavolo would have ASPD is that he lacks any emotional ties whatsoever (dio and pucci have eachother, kars has the pillar men, kira has shinobu and his dad that and valentine loved his father)<br><br>he's easily the most unstable and apathetic villain, he has no restraints at all, his goal are purely selfish and he only cares about himself, nothing or no one else (actually kind of sad since he must have lived a pretty lonely life)</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They still need to add the remaining HttF characters.<br><br>Midler and Alessi next.</br></br></br>  <br> Man, imagine if they bust out the minor villains for every part like they are for part 3. <br>It's bullshit, is what it is. We'll get 80% of the Stardust villains then one or two from every other part</br></br>  <br>Lack of emotional ties is also a big part of SPD. Diavolo would fit ICD-10 criteria for diagnosing it. I don't think he fits the impulsive nature of Cluster B PDs, And I don't think he outright disregards the rights of others and the law, he does it because it risks his solitary lifestyle which is a big part of SPD. Also, you know, 21st Century Schizoid Man and all that.<br><br>I'm not really sure what the whole deal with Doppio is exactly since he is somehow able to communicate with him and shit.</br></br></br>  Since no one's posting in the other thread.<br><br>1. /a/'s #1 most hated anime<br><br>2.
