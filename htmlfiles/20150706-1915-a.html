[  wanted sci-fi or /m/ <br> knights of sidonia season 1 was okay <br> mfw this shit <br>Convince me not to drop season 2 right now</br></br></br>  CG shit, drop it like it's hot.  Because that's cute as fuck dude.   tfw no alien dick monster to cuddle   I can give you two reasons  <br> Izanafags <br>Fuck off.</br></br>  there's a beam emitter in the same episode that makes up for it  <br>If you can't handle a bit of SoL then maybe you should stop watching anime altogether</br>  <br> Convince me not to drop season 2 right now <br>There are actually episodes with some pretty damn awesome fights and action scenes coming up at the end of S2.</br></br>  <br>Because Benisuzume's there  to fuck that stupid tentacle monster shit up later on. </br>  <br>Not liking sidonia no nichijou<br>also rubber tentacle chan best girl</br></br>  <br>It became haremshit</br>  <br>Just read the manga, you Tumblrite, Redditor piece of shit.</br>  <br>The manga is in many ways actually fucking worse.<br><br>Especially about the harem bullshit.<br>Fucking Nihei.</br></br></br></br>  i find amusing that despite living for at least 5 years on sidonia's "surface",Nagte only had females friends..... fucking faggot, that's why he loves that penis monster so much  <br>Does BeniJiro count as a Milf?</br>  <br>why would you consider her as a milf?</br>  <br>Best girl came back and won.</br>  <br>just fucking drop it already and go read muv luv alternative<br>its tentimes more fun than KoS</br></br>  <br>Smoogy.<br>I'm just not sure if the clones are hivemind or not.</br></br>  <br>There's no reason to believe they are.</br>  What I expected: /m/<br>What I got: /d/</br>  <br>Harem shit is worse but the pacing, tech, style, art and so on are far better.</br>    <br> Harem shit is worse <br> <br>It is not. Why are claiming this?</br></br></br>  so should we start sidonia threads on weekends?<br><br>or should we wait until next chapter of manga?</br></br>  <br>Because Teruru.</br>  <br>Whenever you think about Yuhata.</br>  <br>Are you kidding m8. The party house keeps on expanding. They get the tsunbot, best girl polls and the like. The manga is way better but come the fuck on.</br>  <br>i bet Yuhata have mustache but she shave it</br>  <br>I can give you two reasons as well:<br> C <br> G </br></br></br>  <br> Yuhata <br>So close anon.</br></br>  <br>Needs a sombrero.</br>  <br>It's a bit odd to say the manga is worse and then use scenes that haven't even happened in the anime because it didn't get that far into the story.<br><br>So far the anime hasn't really made an effort to avoid or to push the haremshit that was in the currently covered manga chapters into the background.</br></br></br>    I like the setting and general technology (It's basically R-Type The Anime) but it's bogged down by a bunch of harem bullshit with the most generic protag thrown in there.  <br>No. It has exacerbated them. Like as not if they ever got that far (while still sticking to the story, which they don't look like they will be as much now) there would be worse harem shit as OC filler type nonsense as we saw with the date. <br>As the two stand as separate objective works the Manga is better in general but worse for harem shit.</br></br>  <br>The final ep is garbage. It also sold just half of S1. Penis worm has killed Nihei.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out, fag.</br>  <br> Penis worm has killed Nihei <br>Popularity killed Nihei.</br></br>  <br> not liking best girl <br>she's too good for you</br></br>  <br>that shit ain't even human</br>  <br>She's half human.</br>  <br>That's the point.</br>   ever watching this garbage in the first place <br>The only reason I even support the mediocre manga is the hope that Nihei will get enough shekels to go back to working on something that isn't moefag pandering swill.</br>  <br>Cuter than human.</br>  <br>Mushrooms.</br>  <br>The only sexual relationship he'll have will be with the captain. He fugs best girl.</br>  Cute stuff was easily the best part of S2. <br><br>Muh dark and edgy serious fightan fags need to quit anime.</br></br>  <br> Cute stuff was easily the best part of S2 <br>This.</br></br>  <br> 15 meters tall <br> can change form at will <br> no need for such things as breathe, sleep or even eat <br>  having tail, horreondous spikes as shit everywhere, a weird as fuck hole in the chest to hold a person and worst of all a penis <br><br>but she still is a half "human"....</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Implying he won't fuck the Gauna into submission </br>  <br>Penis.</br>  <br>She gets more of her mom's gauna genes while her mind is all human.</br>  <br>Drop it.<br>Last thing /a/ needs is another '/a/ you failed me' thread if someone manages to persuade you to continue and it still won't be to your liking.</br></br>  <br>Kinda interesting that she's more alien than her mum.</br>  I suck at drawing.<br>This looks like a rabbit on steroids. How do I draw better, /a/ ?</br>  <br> Kinda interesting that she's more alien than her mum. <br>Only in looks. Enajiro 1 can't really communicate or behave like normal human being.</br></br>  <br> How do I draw better, /a/ ? <br>Actually learn how anatomy works.</br></br>  <br> The final ep is garbage. <br>Is this opposite day or something?</br></br>  <br> having sex with an extra terrestrial parasitoid <br>pass</br></br>  <br>Didn't what's her face say that her biology aside from the tentacles was completely identical to a human's?</br>  Hey /a/, I tried watching the first series last year, but the CG choppines was unbearable. <br>Does it get better with SVP?</br>  <br>Pretty nice Cherubimon fanart.</br>  It gets worse OP, there's a whole episode dedicated to harem antics.  In case the anon who wanted more pics of my Lego garde is here: Here you are. Made a few small changes and, aside from the stand, it can all be made with set 31034.  <br>Nicely done /a/non.</br>  <br> Implying this isn't cute as fuck <br> Implying alien tentacle monster isn't best girl </br></br>  <br>Forgot to add: It's not a very sturdy build, so making a stand for it is a good idea. But with a bit of patience, it can stand up on its own.<br><br><br><br>Thanks.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, just noticed that there is a single part in there, the one the stand connects to, which isn't in the set. Isn't necessary for the figure itself, though.</br>  <br>You should fuck off forever with you cg crap</br>  <br>No, you're just from reddit</br>  <br>It's so bad, it's good in its own way.</br>  <br> fights <br>They were turned into shit with anime original resolves</br></br>  <br> Implying you ain't part of the cancer that is violently killing Sidonia. </br>  <br> but worse for harem shit. <br>Ah, so you mean that in the sense that it's worse if that's what you're looking for, true. I thought you meant that harem is more distracting in the manga than in the anime.</br></br>  <br> those manly arms and shoulders <br><br>it looks like a trannie</br></br></br>  <br>Nothing important actually changed in the end fight, they just added more flash to it for the finale. Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai the story could move back to the manga line quite easily.</br>  <br> Other than giving BeniJiro to Kunatochiai <br>Did that happen? It got packed into Toha crate and taken away. <br>Nagate probably asked Kunato about the first one during the party.</br></br></br>  <br>Well memed anonymous. Your taste is shit though.</br>  Does anyone have the webm of the bombardment?  <br>Kunato said like he had Benijiro when the crate is clearly THI's.</br>  <br>The crate was just made by THI.</br>  <br>In the manga,  Kunatochiai is denied access to it soon after. </br>  <br> Is the captain going to give it to Tanikaze for their anniversary? </br>  HOLDING YOU TOO IT ANON  <br>Nagate asked him what was going to happen to "Hoshijiro" IIRC, Kunatochiai said something along the lines of always needing a spare. That means he got BeniJiro as well.</br>  <br><br>I didn't look through the thread before I posted that, thanks anon</br></br>  <br>At least until the Capitan revokes his mad science privileges.</br>  They clearly fucked.  <br>we know anon</br>  <br> implying </br>  <br>No problem.</br>  <br>Yes, and?</br>  <br>He could mean  Kanata  as well.</br>  I felt the same OP, But the last 3-4 episodes were fucking great.<br><br>That's what Sidonia should be about Gauze fighting/Benesuzume type shit not the romance garbage, What annoys me more is the amazing setting it is in and hurr we'll just turn it into some sort of space shitty love story.</br></br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/ywmvxoujac.web<wbr>m</wbr>  <br>RIP pomf</br>  <br>But the romance garbage is the integral part of Sidonia story.</br>  is there enough content for a season 3 ?  <br>yes there is anon</br>  <br>EP 5 was the best episode</br>  <br>Agreed.<br><br>I was hooked to this show because of this episode.</br></br></br>  <br>Great taste. For me it's tied with S2 episode 11, though.</br>  <br><br>Although I liked Hoshijiro, it was just about the sustainability of the Tsugumori, and that's not something we see in many other mecha shows</br></br>  <br>It also served to develop their relationship, so her death would affect Nagate more.</br>  <br>Thats also another reason I like that episode, relationship development. Its also why I liked Hoshijiro x Nagate more then Nagate x Izana, more development</br>  <br> 2-3 episodes long relationship <br> still better than all series long one <br>Not funny at all.</br></br></br>  <br>don't get me wrong, I like them both</br>  <br>Their relationship (not in the romantic sense) started in the first episode, so it's 6 episodes.</br>  <br>Honestly, I like them both too.<br>But really, I'm for whatever results in more SPESS battles.</br></br>  <br>This is all I could think of when I hear her.<br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=x47<wbr>NYUbtYb0</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br>That was romance done well for Sidonia IMHO. The pure harem SoL shit not so much.</br>  <br>they essentially just mimicked Rick and Minmei being stuck outside the ship</br>  <br>Be that as it may, it fits the themes and motifs of Sidonia very well while the excessive SoL sticks out and dilutes the story and to make it worse all the haremshit doesn't even develop relationships all that much.</br>  <br>i agree and maybe if i hadn't watched Macross when i was a kid it would have been more special, the harem stuff is getting old but really this show is just a mishmash of Macross/Tenchi etc. still really enjoying it.<br>Second season was more filler sadly.<br>what does Sol mean?</br></br></br>  <br> what does Sol mean? <br>Slice of life</br></br>  <br>It's not even about being special, it's just that it fits very well with the themes and doesn't feel tacked on or excessive. The 908497862 scenes of moe Tsumugi making squeaky balloon sounds don't really bring anything.</br>  <br>  3D <br>  Anime <br>Choose one</br></br></br>  <br>it was awful at first but you get used to it pretty quickly and tbh space scenes are gr8</br>  <br>Nah, I don't think so. Why would he answer Nagate's question with something completely unrelated, especially since Nagate has no idea Kanata even exists in the first place at this point?</br>  what is the significance of the the Captains Mask?   not recognizing that smoogi is the best girl on sidonia <br><br>captain is runner-up</br></br>  <br>because she has cleft lip</br>  <br>She's immortal and has been Captain for a fuck-long time, it's so people don't see her face and notice.</br>   yfw you realise the Placenta   hardens in response to physical trauma   <br>She was cuter without the tits tbh</br>  Okay I just marathoned this and I'm a little disappointed. I actually didn't mind when it turned into a full on SoL/romance in S2. But they didn't even fucking deliver on that? He gets the perfect setup by wing-grandma and he fucking jobs hard. The most we get is him telling best girl that she's important to him. Why can't he pilot his goddamned dick as well as he pilots the Tsugumori?<br><br>The ending was pretty meh and gave off a "yeah there's no S3" kind of vibe. God damnit.</br></br>  <br>Does it really matter as long as the face remains?</br>  <br>Because he was raised underground by a single old dude who only taught him how to kill Gauna and in Izana's case it's compounded by other things:<br> she wasn't a she at all when they met <br> she puts up an image of being tough and not needing help </br></br></br>  <br>How is it even possible to deny that pic related is best Izana?</br>  <br> Used original OP in final episode battle <br>11/10 just for that choice alone.</br></br>  <br><br>this is best Izana</br></br>  <br>That was cool, but it also reminded me how absolutely garbage the 2nd ED was compared to the first.</br>  <br>There are several others that are close, but not that one.</br>  Anyone know where I can download the 100 sites of sidonia that they used in the anime? I can only find the manga versions. Am I gonna have to screencap them myself?    <br>I'm rather partial to this one.</br>  <br>It's more interesting now that  she has thrown the mask away helping injured staffs herself after an MUS ate 1/8 of the ship .</br>  <br>I wonder if Nagate and Izana ended up skinny dipping together.</br>  why hasn't she kissed Tanikaze yet?  <br>I wouldn't be surprised either way.</br>  <br>because she's not dead, immortal or had a penis</br>  <br>Do the BeniJiro count as both dead and immortal?</br>  <br>Nagate is dense and she seems to be either unable or unwilling to act drastically enough.</br>  <br>yes, and she's not human, she's an aberration to nature and should be killed with fire alongside with Tsumugi</br>  <br>Izana, pls.</br>  <br> Izana <br> wishing to harm Tsumugi <br>When she got BTFO by Tsumugi all she could say was that she's happy for her</br></br></br>  <br>Maybe she doesn't consider the balloon sausage actual competition?</br>  <br>it's kinda weird the relationship between Izana, Nagate and Tsumugi, for moments they look like a family with Tsumugi as a child and there are some parts in the manga were it seems that there is something about to happen between Izana and Nagate but it just stays there</br>  <br>Pretty sure that's not true.<br> we were rejected </br></br>  <br>I saw that too, the curse of haremshit.<br><br>Well, they still have the "not an alien tentacle that's technically the daughter of his first love interest" thing going for them.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw nothing to cuddle at all </br>  this scene remind me this <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=45b<wbr>UOIK2cAo</wbr>  [ ]</br>  Is there any ep12 director's cut not on Netflix out there?  <br>what would be different?</br>  So, what's the consensus on the fates of the other seed ships?  <br><br>we all know who really wins</br></br>  <br>The aliums?</br>  <br>She never really wins since the Bowl she was in had been done and she wasn't the winner and never will be.</br>  so what attacked norio and his assistant in the first episode of season 2?  <br>Borg implants made of aliens.</br>  <br>Best girl</br>  <br>Toxine was cactus?</br>  <br>i swear i saw a 6" person with a sword</br>  <br>She cut off Mozuku's fingers because Mozuku was trying to touch Ochiai's cactus.<br><br>She's very fast.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, I thought the cacti just had hyperdimensional razor spines or something.</br>  <br>little dude</br>  <br> rubber tentacle chan best girl <br><br>I know, right?</br></br></br>  <br>Um, where is Tsumugi's base attached there?</br>  Where the fuck can I download 12 ep director's cut?  <br>Most became gauna food, very few might be successful like Sidonia. Depends on whether they found their own space cheese or other ways to deal with gauna.</br>  Monstergirl fag here. You faggots are all weird.  Picked up btw   <br> You faggots are all weird <br>Thanks.</br></br>  <br> cancer <br>It's not cancer, it's just placenta.</br></br>  <br> placenta <br>It's not placenta, it's your waifu.</br></br>  <br> MANY DAYS <br> A <br> N <br> Y <br> . <br> D <br> A <br> Y <br> S </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Who's to say that gauna were even present in any direction other than the one Sidonia was/is travelling? <br><br>It's entirely possible that all of the other ships landed somewhere a long time ago and have established massive civilizations.</br></br></br>  <br> retarded accelerator <br> a bunch of Hayakaze saving the day out of ass <br>Yeah, right.</br></br></br>  <br>Your guess is as good as any but it's unlikely gauna didn't expand. They found Earh after all and they are attracted to hyggs which is primary power source of human civilization.</br>  <br>Shit eater</br>  <br> Convince me not to drop season 2 right now <br><br>season 2, and the rest of the manga, is better than the first season's material becuase it's more focused on the characters and less focused on space explosions<br><br>...but that's a pattern that's present in even the most hard core /m/ shit. 08th MS team, the single best gundam show with the LEAST romantic subplot, STILL HAS ONE. Every macross show is 80% romantic subplot, 10% space lasers, and 10% nyan. <br><br>the entire mecha genre is an excuse to give faggots who like mushy subplots an excuse to watch them. and there's nothing wrong with that. as a self proclaimed giant faggot, I watch mecha shows for that exact reason. hell i watch mushy shit like yahari as well. also pic related. eva is like 80% mushy subplot and whining, 10% mecha battles, and 10% blatant fanservice.<br><br>stop lying to yourself, anon.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> season 2, and the rest of the manga, is better than the first season's material becuase it's more focused on the characters <br>But what if the characters are shit?</br></br>  <br> worse. <br> harem bullshit <br><br>surely you meant, "way better thanks to the harem bullshit", right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>But S1 was your generic /m/ anime.<br> Boy gets immediately thrown into mecha <br> Rival who hates MC for extremely petty reasons <br> Someone important to him dies <br><br>Meanwhile in S2:<br> New bad guy is a pretty decent guy overall <br> Fun with tsumugi </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You either get better taste or find something you like instead of whining about something you don't like.</br>  <br> Boy gets immediately thrown into mecha <br> clone of BEST PILOT EVER trained from birth to pilot said mecha by BEST PILOT EVER <br>Guess that doesn't sound as negative as you'd hope for without leaving the important stuff out.<br><br> New bad guy is a pretty decent guy overall <br> generic mad scientist hell bent on screwing over everyone and becoming godlike being <br><br>I still don't understand how the whole fucking crew, everyone that new Kunato just accepted that he became BEST SCIENTIST EVER overnight and got results even Ochiai couldn't.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> 08th MS team, the single best gundam show with the LEAST romantic subplot <br><br>opinion discarded</br></br></br>  <br>Yahari is not mushy.</br>  <br>But Nihei sucks at characterization. He is only good at creating an atmosphere, the settings and the battles. So saying that S2 is focused on the characters is not a good thing in this case.</br>  <br>Same as usual.</br>  <br> 08th MS team <br> the single best gundam show with the LEAST romantic subplot </br></br>  <br>Izana was pretty great in that arc.</br>  <br>Don't tell the Tsumugifags, they start shitposting when confronted.</br>  <br>When will manlets learn</br>  what was he looking at?  <br>What breakdown would you give Patlabor?</br>  <br>Somewhat covered plumbing.</br>  <br>not that guy, but patlabor is a story about how in the future,  even autistic people can become law enforcement </br>  <br>Punchline.</br>  <br>Come on, Ota isn't that bad. I assume you are meaning Ota.</br>  <br>Izana is always great, but Tsumugifags and Hoshifags at the same time is a formidable foe</br>  <br>I wonder if she was disappointed he didn't move on that. He's literally the son goku of macross gundam, completely oblivious to his dick.</br>  <br>izumi.<br><br><br>also</br></br></br></br>  <br> literally </br>  <br>I do not see the relevance of Noa's surname in this discussion about autism.</br>  <br> I still don't understand how the whole fucking crew, everyone that new Kunato just accepted that he became BEST SCIENTIST EVER overnight and got results even Ochiai couldn't. <br>Top achiever from a wealthy family which runs research and manufacturing of high tech goods. Captain probably didn't give a fuck as long as she got results because she needed power against LMUS.<br>Anime also made it easier to swallow because they changed events like Numi keeping pet gauna secret just because.</br></br></br>  <br> I still don't understand how the whole fucking crew, everyone that new Kunato just accepted that he became BEST SCIENTIST EVER overnight and got results even Ochiai couldn't <br>A caveman became their savior out of nowhere. They stopped asking questions at this point as long as shit was getting done.</br></br>  <br>did izana even have genitals at that point?</br>   i suddenly feel like synthesizing <br> he falls asleep <br><br>THAT'S TWO GOLDEN OPPORTUNITIES MISSED, THIS FUCKING GUY.</br></br></br>  Animeonlyfags are truly the worst cancer.  <br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=TBf<wbr>WKmRFTjM</wbr>  [ ]</br>  <br> synthesizing <br>Heh.<br>Also it's Nagate we're talking about. Even if Samari managed to drag him into photosynthesis chamber you can be sure as hell he'd get bruised and kicked K.O. by no less than 3 various Honokas.</br></br></br>    Did the Nihei mention anything about how long this manga is going to be?  <br>While it's popular. Now it's not, so he is finishing it.</br>  <br><br> blamefags defends this bullshit </br></br>  <br/>  <br>Mangafags has their fair amount of retards as well, the ones that doesn't even read and comes up with their own shitty headcanon with pictures they take out of context.</br>  <br> the ones that doesn't even read <br> Mangafags <br>That's some funny definition.</br></br></br>  <br><br>It was her sister placenta clone thing that had the kid. She's a christmas cake.</br></br>  <br>I guess that explains why the endings to his mangas are completely wtf.</br>  <br>Those were just flash for the season (or anime for that matter) finale. They don't actually change anything. Nagate and Tsumugi still get back to Sidonia just fine in the manga without the flashy end battle.</br>  <br> the ones that doesn't even read <br> and comes up with their own shitty headcanon with pictures they take out of context <br>That's a tetriary, dumbass.</br></br></br>  <br>Depends on if the other ships use Higgs bosons and the magic cheese rice probably.<br>The Sidonia might be baiting them away from the others for all we know.</br></br>  <br> Higgs bosons <br>It's Heigus particles</br></br>  <br>Everything is possible since we have no idea in the end, but I doubt they'd be very different. Kobayashi (?) I believe mentions that even a stationary colony would have trouble surviving long-term without Higgs-powered things. There's also the fact that Gauna started attacking when humanity started using Higgs and at that time fucking nobody knew that it was actually drawing them in, there would be little reason to not equip seed ships with the top-tier tech at the time.</br>  <br>That works on the assumption all the nations had the same tech level, I wouldn't be surprised if just about every theoretical sub light speed interstellar travel technology was used.</br>  Is it strange that I can totally get off to just this one image?  <br>Not really.</br>  <br>Izana has been great since she took the pilot role; fighting 1-on-1 with Benisuzume only with a shield and survive in manga, and carrying unconscious Nagate's Tsugumori and herself out of a certain fatal crash in anime.</br>  <br>I find it somewhat implausible that at least the major nations/powers didn't cooperate and share tech when the very survival of the human race was at stake. There are quite a few examples in history of various civilizations that were more or less divided internally band together to fight large external threats, this should have applied to giant space tentacle monsters coming to consume humanity itself.<br><br>I'm not saying everyone turned into altruists to help the poorest of African states build seed ships, but it would have been stupid as fuck not to cooperate with other nations building their own seedships.</br></br></br>  <br>I kind of forgot, were they near a star or something when this happened? If not where was enough light for photosynthesis coming from?<br> Or did she "photosynthesize" to give Nagate a hint before what seemed like certain death? </br></br>  <br>Just saying, the Norks' strategically painted trashcan ship powered by nuclear explosions may get farther than the others. If it can leave the atmosphere.</br>  <br>When the Captain orgasmed (SUBARASHII) after watching the Graviton Beam Emitter blow a hole through a planet, it became obvious she was no longer (and perhaps never was) thinking rationally.<br>Examples:<br> we gun kill gauna hive MANY DA... i mean many times the size of sidonia <br> make me another electro-rave-laser-penis, but don't fuck it up like last time <br> bridge bunny: "captain, we should save izana, nagate and smoogy's best friend." <br> captain: "fuck that gender-bending bitch." </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Whatever, the particle is called, its made up. They're not higgs bossons. Whether they should translate it as Hyggs or Heigus is semantics.</br></br>  <br> captain: "fuck that gender-bending bitch." <br>That's pretty rational thought.<br><br>Jokes aside, what's the deal with the captain? Especially in the mango where he rapes dense pilots. Is she projecting Nagate's grandfather onto him or what?</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean there are people who don't think the Capitan is an Ork Warboss trapped in a practically immortal Nip body?</br>  <br> Ork Warboss <br> Electro-ray of doom <br> gauna-killer rifle spawn <br> ALL THE DAKKA <br>...it somehow makes sense.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I love me some Stoner-chan.</br></br>  <br>I'd put some gravity vectoring in her, if you know what I mean.</br>  <br>Not to mention how she wants to get da Boys in a good tussle with the Gauna cluster.</br>  <br>The Immortal Council mentioned something about "gravity dementia". They probably weren't just making things up.</br>  <br> rapes <br>Yeah, Nagate was totally traumatized after using the captain's entrance for MANY DAYS.<br><br>On a more serious note, I think she legit wants what's best for Sidonia, namely to be able to live in peace without constant Gauna threat. Since so far the only contact with Gauna has been conflict, the only logical way to pursue this is to:<br> 1. Eliminate the current, immediate threat <br> 2. Have the capability to adequately defend Sidonia and any colonies against future LMUS attack </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Chill man, it was consensual rape.</br></br>  <br>Holy fucking shit, this is why no aliens has come to this fucking earth</br>  <br>The Immortal Council also mentioned that it would have been easy to avoid Gauna space, but the Captain went there on purpose.</br>  <br>What are you implying, that they are shy and have height issues?<br><br> Because that's my fetish. </br></br></br>  <br>Yeah, fuck the metric system.</br>  slutty kobayashi is best kobayashi  <br>Foxy grandma best girl.</br>   dad walks in <br> looks at the big pink penis on the screen <br> looks at me <br> -I-it's ok anon, I respect gays.  <br> -It's not like that, dad... it actually is a cute girl.... </br></br></br></br>  <br>aliens are just too proud of thier size, and probably thinks human race cant satisfy them</br>  Everyone has the same face in the manga.  <br>That's what you get for being a Tsumugifag.</br>  <br>If your dad still has any faith in you, you're doing something wrong.</br>  <br>is this a new facepalm</br>  <br>why are the last 2 letters backwards?</br>  <br>Yure is a good but Izana is the best</br>  <br>mean to</br>  <br>Running forever without a weapon that can dispatch Gauna while keeping Sidonia and its inhabitants safe isn't really the best long-term option. What Kobayashi did is risky as fuck for sure, but if it works it will mean that for the first time in over 1000 years (?) humanity, as far as we know, humanity will have less to fear from the Gauna and may have a chance to establish a proper presence on a nice world.</br>  I fucking hate the manga for this. It was really good for the first half, but now it's just turned into haremshit.<br><br>FUCK YOU NIHEI</br></br>  <br>Because an alien clone with only a basic understanding of Japanese is trying to write in English?<br><br>Speak for yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>yea, S2 sucked compared to S1.</br>  How do sweaty Izana's armpits smell like?  <br>Like sweaty Izana.</br>    <br> and probably thinks human race cant satisfy them <br>They are wrong.</br></br>   yfw Sidonia S3 in 2018   <br>Well, I want to watch The Fifth Element now.</br>  <br> I think she legit wants what's best for Sidonia <br>No one is questioning that, even Ochiai wanted that before he clashed with the captain.<br>However it's the ways and paths they want to take that is the problem. They are both doing horrible stuff and refuses to give up control because of the risk of them not ending out on top.<br><br>So far I have seen four camps.<br><br>Ochiai wants to evolve humanity, with him in lead.<br>Kobayashi wants to humans to be safe and keep tradition, with her in the lead.<br>Saitou wanted to trust the next generation.<br>Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager. <br>She's dead/an alien now.</br></br>  <br>Well yes, she got her wish.</br>  <br>I read the manga for a long time but eventually it just got too out there, like there was no actual goal in mind for the plot and they were just winging it.<br><br>If you don't like at this point you aren't going to like it going further in.</br></br></br>  <br>So what? She's trying to take Tanikaze with her?</br>  <br>At the time the Captain made the decision to cruise through Gauna space instead of going around, she had untested combatants and the only effective weapons were spears.<br>Perhaps she anticipated the development of the artificial Kabi-core bullets, but they were force to fight several Gauna before that, one of which was so close to catching them that she had to fuck up the ship in a high-g turn.</br></br>  <br>More of: She wanted understanding so much she ended up getting eaten.</br>  <br>It's getting really hard not to think of this show as AoT in space.</br>  <br>I never read the manga before watching the first season. My heart was genuinely shattered when they killed her.</br>  <br>There may be less opportunity for haremshit with the recent developments in the manga.<br><br><br>I don't think comparing any of the other 3 to Ochiai is fair. Ochiai started out by wanting to evolve humanity, but in the end his goal changed to simply evolving by himself by any means necessary and now is looking to actively destroy Sidonia. From what was a questionable course of action in the first place he went only downhill.<br><br>Kobayashi takes risks but the fundamental fact that she cares about Sidonia and its people doesn't change. She is very well aware she did some fucked up shit and her recent character development suggests she's trying to change and improve (coming clean to Nagate about who/what he is, ditching the mask, hands-on helping people and Lala's statement about her being gentler).<br><br>Hiroki and Hoshijiro don't even belong in the same category with Kobayashi in terms of what they're willing to do, much less so with Ochiai.<br><br><br>She's definitely willing to take risks and is well aware that people will die, but there's no way it wouldn't have happened eventually, what with Gauna being more powerful and faster anyway.<br><br>Escaping may have been potentially viable if they found another power source and ditched everything Kabi, but nobody knew that back then.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hasn't Sidonia been a thing before AoT though?</br>  <br>Fuck if I remember, it all sort of blurs together.</br>  <br>Please don't associate AoT with Sidonia. It's sickening enough to hear this all the time in youtube comments or other places.<br><br><br>Same year, I believe.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't want to associate the two, but it's hard not to.</br>  <br><br>Well I looked it up, Sidonia started in April and AoT in September 2009. So I guess AoT is Sidonia in the middle-ish ages  and worse. </br></br>  <br><br><br><br><br><br>Isayama Hajime stated that he was inspired by Knights of Sidonia to make Attack on Titan. That's why this tweet is so funny.</br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>AoT really took off after the anime adaption. I guess Nihei's art is just far more unappealing, even if compared to Isayama's earliest stuff. <br><br>I guess AoT is just more engaging to read, but I appreciate Nihei's art more.</br></br></br>  <br> Hoshijiro wants understanding because she is a naive teenager <br>I wouldn't call her naive for that. Not like she strongly believed or convinced that the gauna wanted to be friends. If anything, I'd call it a sign that she was more of a free thinker than most residents of Sidonia, as she wasn't as held back by the dogmatic hatred for Gauna that most have. Gauna don't seem to have any inherent intelligence, so hating them is like hating nature for natural disasters: Pointless.<br><br><br>Same here. Probably the main reason I immediately read through the manga was because I wanted to know what would happen with the placenta clones. The topic being untouched for over 30 chapters made me very sad.  ;_; </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Responding to an admitted Yukinoshitter </br>  <br>It is fair.<br><br>Both Kobayashi and Ochia wanted was was best for humanity, they didn't see eye to eye on how they would achieve it and this is what made them clash.<br><br>Kobayashi wants to be in charge of Sidonia, she does not want anyone else to take over because she doesn't trust the next generation. Saitou wants to put faith in next generation, Kobayashi doesn't. This is where her and Saitou clashed.<br><br> coming clean to Nagate about who/what he is <br>She never told him everything, she is still wanting to be in control of the situation. She is feeding him bits of the whole truth.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off gauna apologist, they hunt and hurt humans for centuries even destroyed their home planet and expect them to not hate you?</br>  <br>I dunno, they seemed to figure out psyops pretty fast. None of the people who got eaten really screamed "I am a master of psychology"</br>  I'm having trouble convincing myself to finish S1. The characters are all bad, the action and mecha aren't very impressive, and the storytelling is kinda weird. <br><br>Kunato fucks up the mission for the dumbest fucking reason and MC just drops it and lets him get away with it. <br><br>Ochiai and info about his secret research is just hanging around Kunato's house for no reason for him to find.<br><br>Kabi bullets are invented out of nowhere with no buildup. <br><br>A planet busting missile combined with the planet itself blowing up can't scratch a gauna, but a spear can. <br><br>MC is surrounded by females who are desperate for his attention and there are no male characters to be found anywhere. <br><br>Izana being a hermaphrodite (at least so far) has no impact either on her character or on her romantic relationship with MC.<br><br>The demilitarization faction goes so far as to leave Sidonia guided by a retarded belief that we're given no evidence for. <br><br>There are other things that bothered me too that I can't recall off the top of my head. I guess none of them are completely story breaking, but overall the plot feels somewhat sloppily constructed and without the support of any interesting characters or relationships I feel like there's not much point in continuing. The best parts are the OP, Sidonia's design, and the cool portraits/sketches that are shown halfway through each episode.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Many people have had their homes destroyed by tsunamis, but there's still no point in "hating nature". I don't sympathize with the gauna, but I see no reason to hate them, either.<br><br><br>That's likely just them using the brain they've absorbed. That's why I said "inherent intelligence". They probably just use what works, supported by information gained from things they've absorbed.<br><br>Of course, when it comes to Benisuzume, for instance, we can begin to talk about intent, at least to some degree.<br><br>But who knows, they're still mostly a mystery, after all.<br/></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What a shitty excuse, Nature is nature. Gauna is extraterrestrial life.</br>  <br>Brings up the question why they keep using BeniJiros when it's clear they've lost a lot of their impact.</br>  <br>at least there is a chance for S3 anon... we can only wait</br>  <br>Life is a part of nature. I wouldn't hate a lion for eating a person. Sure, it sucks, but it's not like the lion did it out of malevolent intent.<br><br><br>Why the gauna still use BeniJiro? Probably because she seems to be an efficient fighter. Sure, the scare-tactic doesn't work anymore (whether it was intentional or not), but she's still far more effective than the average gauna. I imagine it's a lot like natural selection. What works is used and what doesn't work is not.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You're leaving out the little part where Ochiai is attacking Sidonia and/or its fleet with a GBE and him leaving that objective behind a long time ago and instead adopting the goal for himself alone.<br><br> She never told him everything, she is still wanting to be in control of the situation. She is feeding him bits of the whole truth. <br>Maybe, but that's pure speculation at this point as there isn't anything in those few pages to actually suggest it. I'd go as far as to say that lying at that point doesn't fit with her behavior afterwards or with Lala's perception of her in the latest chapter. She could have lied, of course, but the fact is that we don't know at this point.<br><br>I don't see why she would though. Nagate wasn't rebelling before, he's loyal to her and to Sidonia. What's the purpose of going through the whole thing and lying?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's new?</br>  <br> keep using <br>They don't really. There were 3 of them, right? 2 got killed off quickly while Benisuzume survived. Then Benisuzume got nearly killed, regenerated and then attacked again and got killed for good.<br><br>The Gauna only made Hoshijiro clones at one point, one of them was just hard to kill.</br></br></br></br>  <br>if we get a third season i'd like to see the part when gaunas replicate one of the Honokas</br>  <br>Yeah that would definitely be interesting</br>  <br> Kunato fucks up the mission for the dumbest fucking reason and MC just drops it and lets him get away with it. <br>Their part in that mission was secondary. Kunato believed he could make Tanikaze look bad while not severely endangering the primary mission, which he was correct. Tanikaze drops it because he's an altruist, which he demonstrates time and time again.<br><br> Ochiai and info about his secret research is just hanging around Kunato's house for no reason for him to find. <br>The Kunato family is in charge of keeping Ochiai's sealed lab and his secondary brain. Being a rich family, they have an extensive library with historical information, including that of Ochiai and his research.<br><br> Kabi bullets are invented out of nowhere with no buildup. <br>When Tanikaze is allowed to view the dead chimera with Yure and the Captain, they explain the body produces an artificial Kabi. When they later introduce the man-made Kabi-core bullets, it's obvious to the viewer where they obtained the material.<br><br> A planet busting missile combined with the planet itself blowing up can't scratch a gauna, but a spear can. <br>Repeatedly explained that the Gauna core is impervious to all damage, except for the Kabi. There's not scientific reasoning to it, but it's established as being part of the physics of this universe.<br><br> MC is surrounded by females who are desperate for his attention and there are no male characters to be found anywhere. <br>There are a few more males, but this is a typical harem setup. It's not as bad as some other anime.<br><br> Izana being a hermaphrodite (at least so far) has no impact either on her character or on her romantic relationship with MC. <br>My wife thinks this is a legitimate complaint. Izana, though technically genderless at the beginning of the story, acts in most every way like a female. Her attraction to Nagate is immediate and apparent. Her transition to female later in the story is mostly to create tension between her and Nagate.<br><br> pic <br>What the fuck. Seriously.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> The demilitarization faction goes so far as to leave Sidonia guided by a retarded belief that we're given no evidence for.  <br>People believe stupid shit for no reason, or for very arbitrary reasons not backed up by evidence.<br><br>My suggestion: if you think the characters are bad, the action and mecha aren't impressive, and the storytelling is weird then you should stop watching it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh it's you again.<br><br>First off I'm not leaving out anything their first clash started way earlier than him attacking them with a GBE, read the bonus manga that came with the BD.<br><br>Also, do you really not understand the concept of not telling everything means? It's not a lie, you are just withholding information in your favor, which she is clearly doing.<br><br>It's more in favor that she never told him about why Saitou got fed up in the first place and just simply left that out.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You try to spout the rule of nature and you do not understand them either.</br>  <br> you again. <br>What?<br><br> Also, do you really not understand the concept of not telling everything means? <br>Where exactly are you getting this from? Please, tell me the chapter and the page where I can see Kobayashi omit essential details. All we got were like 3 pages, it basically skipped over all the discussion that happened.<br><br>You can interpret it however you wish, but there's still 0 actual evidence either one way or the other in the manga.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I didn't mean the guard copies, the Clones.</br>  <br> Rules of nature ?</br>  Yes hello does the girl have sex with the penis monster?<br><br>Is it shown in the anime?<br><br>If both answers are yes, I am picking this up.<br>Thank you very much /a/.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Maybe they're useful for their brain or some shit, or the Gauna is simply regenerating everything that was part of its original placenta as a matter of course.</br>  <br>That game actually explained the rules of nature.</br>  <br>Could be, just a sort of large flight risk when they don't disintegrate with the cores. Smoogy's mom really boosted Sidonia's ability to effectively counter attack.</br>  <br>I'm simply pointing out that it's pointless to hate something that doesn't act with any intent, or at least any malevolent intent, which seems to be the case with the gauna until they actually begin using the brains of absorbed people. Until then, they simply followed the kabi or hyggs particles.<br><br><br><br> Maybe they're useful for their brain or some shit <br>I thought this was obvious. They get the ability of tactical thinking. The gauna itself probably don't use it with that intent, but it's effective, and thus it keeps getting used.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Where exactly are you getting this from?  <br>From the whole part where Lala committed "treason" Saitou stole a clonebaby and cut down some guards<br><br>Even Lala have not told Nagate about this. No one has.</br></br></br></br>  <br> when they don't disintegrate with the cores <br>They do though, it's just that placenta doesn't foam if it's been physically cut from the true body.</br></br>  <br>It does act with intent if it's way of "communicating" with you is harming you Captain Hindsight.</br>  <br>Wasn't the BeniJiro that was invading Tanikaze's cockpit still attached to the core though?</br>  <br>That not enough? How about the part where she weaseled out of giving him information about Saitou.</br>  <br>Again, there is no point in the manga where we can actually see if Kobayashi told him about that or kept it hidden. We know they had a conversation where Kobayashi told him some shit about the past, but we don't know what she told him exactly. Maybe she lied, maybe she kept things hidden, maybe she told the truth, but we don't KNOW and those 3 pages don't really suggest anything one way or the other.<br><br><br>No, Izana separated it just before Nagate foamed Benisuzume.</br></br></br></br>  <br>2/2<br><br>Oh look at that, she is lying to him.</br></br></br>  <br>Huh, don't remember that bit.<br>Wonder if they'll invent a weapon that's essentially a Gauna peeler.</br></br>  <br>Please respond.</br>  <br><br>How exactly is shit from chapter 8 relevant to a discussion that happens in 60-something? Yeah no fucking shit she didn't tell him anything at the beginning of the manga.<br><br><br>They can peel placenta off just fine with Higgs cannons in general.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Yes, because vaporized Placenta is so useful for weapons development and easy to collect.</br>  <br> moving goalposts this hard. <br>It matters a lot because it shows us how she has been manipulating him into working from him from the start. What the fuck did you think the "I need to treat this situation different" meant? Did you start reading after 63 thinking that was a good place to start?</br></br>  <br>You clearly have no idea what I'm talking about or you forgot how our discussion started, so I'm going to bow out now.</br>   [CBM] Knights of Sidonia 1-12 (Dual Audio) [BDRip 720p 8bit] <br><br>is this the one to get?</br></br>  <br>And you have no idea how much established character backgrounds does for situations. Are you really so naive that a 700 year old woman magically changes because of Nagate? No she is playing him like a fool as she has been since the start and does everything she can to avoid doing the same mistakes she made with Saitou.<br><br>She never told him about Saitou because Nagate trusts him more than her. She denies him information because she wants to be in control of the situation.</br></br></br>  <br>Well, to be fair, she doesn't exactly seem like the most mentally stable person.</br>  <br>Get the fuck out, normie. Rrreeeeerrre</br>  <br>Most of us ITT probably watched it as it was airing.</br>  <br>Absolute power corrupts, this is the same person that ordered the previous immortal council to be assassinated so she could keep staying in power.</br>  <br>Dem gitz was threatenin' the Waarg!<br>Seriously though, the council was just as if not more questionable in their actions.</br></br>  <br>They all are, the idea of an immortal council only works on short terms due to the need of preserving knowledge, problem is it should just be that and you could do that in other ways then to resort to immortality. Long terms it's leads to stagnation and only ends up in a power struggle in who should be in charge.<br><br>Great men knows when to step down.</br></br></br>  <br>Indeed, makes me wonder in the Capitan will ignite her own mutiny before the wild ride ends.</br>  <br>A virus doesn't act with intent. It just does was it does, which might result in the death of other organisms. There's no point in hating the virus for that, at least in my view. It's just acting out its biological programming.</br>  <br> implying you can't be long-lived while doing what's best in the very long-term </br>  <br>How is that gay? Are you in elementary school?</br>  <br> There's no point in hating the virus for that, at least in my view. <br><br>Then give up your life whenever you happened to come across hardship. <br>Rules of nature does not mean that you should bend over to the aggressor because it is stronger or in it's nature. It means anything goes, even defending yourself, grit your teeth. There is a reason why lions attack the weak.</br></br></br></br>  <br>If the Gauna are actually attempting to communicate then you can't compare them to a virus. You can't even apply the concept of communication to a virus.</br>  <br>It will probably be Tsumugi that does it just because.<br><br>Thing is, Kobayashi is currently a great wartime leader. She is making good calls actually leading Sidonia.</br></br></br>  <br><br> implying virus-chan doesn't try to communicate by hugging </br></br>  <br>my URL</br>  Blame! needs an anime  <br>Well, Smoogy did go full RIP AND TEAR before.</br>  <br><br>It needs a dungeon crawler game.</br></br>  <br>Only against Gauna though</br>    <br>NaissanceE's environments looked very similar to Blame!</br>  <br>Just wait, they'll try some kind of combat drug on her to increase performance. Or something equally stupid.</br>  <br>That would be retarded as fuck, but then again nobody noticed Ochiai being up and about and making himself a chimera body to rek Sidonia with, so who fucking knows.</br>  <br>All it would take is Smoogy needing to fight injured or something.</br>  <br>Yeah but that this point with all the new Guardian models and ships and GBEs and shit Smoogy isn't even that big of a deal anymore, would still be plenty retarded. Not to say that it's impossible, Kobayashi like to roll the dice every once in a while and hope she comes out on top.</br>  <br>So, her eventually rolling a one is basically a certainty.</br>  <br>Getting Gauna to suck on Sidonia has to count as that happening</br>  <br>You mean the giant laser penis?<br>That was definitely a two, could have easily completely destroyed Sidonia.</br></br>  <br>I am not saying not to resist. I don't mind the gauna being killed. Nothing wrong with killing a lion in self-defense or trying to get rid of a virus entirely. But I'd say it's better to look objectively at what they are and considering different possibilities instead of dogmatically hating them.<br><br><br>Yeah, but they probably aren't trying to communicate, which is why I'm comparing them to a virus.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You mean from the anime? No, I mean pic related.</br>  <br>the part when Gaunas replicate what earth would look like and parts of sidonia using Shou's memories and even replicating Shou itself , shows some interest of interest of understand humanity.<br>i don't think that gaunas copy everything without a reason, that would be pointless.</br></br>  <br>forgot the pic</br>  <br> that would be pointless <br>In the end, life is pointless. Cells self-replicate, but there is no inherent reason to this. It's just it's inherent programming. If that programming helps them survive, they'll keep it. But who knows, the gauna might have evolved some form of intelligence.</br></br>  <br> You mean the giant laser penis? <br>you anime only?</br></br>  <br>Whether it show interest in understanding humanity or not I don't know, but what's very interesting about that scene is that the Gauna have replicated something that they didn't physically consume. Replicate Guardians, replicate humans, sure. But they actually consumed those. This time though they replicated memories of a place that no longer exists, so it means at the very least that they were able to interpret human memories to a degree. That's pretty damn fascinating and not something we've seen Gauna do before IIRC.</br>  <br>Ah.<br><br>Yeah, the style of the space stuff reminded me of R-Type. The manga is much less pleasing to my eyeballs.</br></br></br>  How much do I need to pay Nihei for him to revive Hoshijiro?  <br>I'd wait and see what happens to all the BeniJiros before I started throwing money.</br>  <br>But you are giving them an excuse to continue trample over you, and that frankly is a sign of weakness. They are the aggressors and still are to this day, it's not a complicated philosophical thing. It's kill or literary cease to exist.<br><br>Also you are hind sighting a lot witch serves to muddle your perception of the whole ordeal.</br></br></br>  <br>What exactly was she trying to do? Does she get killed off later or turned into some kind of weapon?</br>  <br>I would use the Captain's entrance.</br>  <br> What exactly was she trying to do? <br>Strangle Nagate while connected to Benisuzume, after that it fell unconscious. BeniJiro is then put in a box at Toha (in the manga) and absolutely nothing else happens.</br></br>  <br>I've got no fucking clue, I think someone said strangle him? But that was a very disappointed look she gave when she got cut off. I'd guess she was trying to eat him.</br>  <br>Sexual assimilation.</br>  <br>Hot mecha on alien action.</br>  <br>My main complaints with the show are the comedy and harem elements. The comedy usually has bad timing and is often too over the top for a show with such a solemn atmosphere. The harem aspects are also awkward and clumsy in the way they are implemented. Instead of trying to create organic moments born from the setting and the unfolding events too many scenes use pre-established anime cliches without much effort put in to disguise them.</br>  <br>I am also pissed at how much this season fucked up Kunato. First season had a great arc for his character and I was eagerly anticipating this season to be his redemption arc and Tanikaze to finally gain a male friend (or at least a friendly rival). Instead his character is assassinated for a mind control plot that seems to stall out half way through.</br>  <br>read the manga</br>  <br>Yeah I think maybe she was trying to turn him into a guardian</br>  <br> Instead of trying to create organic moments born from the setting and the unfolding events too many scenes use pre-established anime cliches without much effort put in to disguise them. <br>This is the main problem I think as well. Nihei just rams the haremshit in there and it doesn't really fit most of the time. For instance I think  was very much in tone and if the romance were always done like that it wouldn't bother me.</br></br>  <br>the manga has some moments when harem shit and comedy could be natural and spontaneous but when those times comes, nothing happens</br>  <br>I could see that, it would be beneficial to the Gauna and the Hoshijiro part of BeniJiro I guess.</br>  <br>Beneficial? He could probably solo sidonia entire forces if he got transformed into a guardian.</br>  <br>Chance? The director fucking said it himself that they were going to be animating more Sidonia.</br>  <br>You realize this shit is absolutely impossible to make right?</br>  <br> mfw </br>  <br>Source?</br>  <br>Twitter post. Check the archives for pic, I don't have it on me.</br>  Ok, I've seen these threads going around for a while but all the screenshots I've seen of the show look like fucking shit. Is it actually worth it? I mean, should I watch this garbage looking piece of shit?  <br>The space shit is fucking top tier.<br>Closest we'll ever get to an R-Type animu.<br>The rest is meh, and I only say that because I've seen worse.</br></br></br>  <br>I'll try nevertheless. :^)</br>  <br>I'm not saying anything about resisting less. The only point I'm making is that it's better to be critical of dogma than to just say "gauna are evil".</br>  <br>KoS mod for Homeworld 2 when?</br>  <br>Huh. I take that back, there might be a way to make a Killy walking simulator. Would need some sort of randomness integrated into the game so buildings would be generated naturally. There is a game called No Man's Sky coming out soon that implements this function in its game. Maybe you should check it out.</br>  <br>That's actually a neat idea, shame the modding scene for it is so dead despite neat tools and samples provided by Gearbox.<br><br><br>I have procedural elements in it, yes. Going fully procedural is hard and usually ends up ugly, so I'm going for a mix where handcrafted pieces are assembled into infinite structures.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you have a developer blog so I can follow your progress?</br>    <br> 08th MS team <br> LEAST romantic subplot </br></br>  <br>Damn.<br> You will never bring Sidonia to bear </br></br>  <br>bac9.tumblr.com<br><br>Mostly it's posts from 2014, I just got back to working on it recently (haven't touched that stuff for half a year, lots of crunch time at my main job left no free time). Right now the work is mostly about creating systems that will help me work on the world, figuring out the fastest workflows possible, writing shaders and editor tools and so on, not about gameplay or fancy visual polish, though, - so there are very few fancy gifs or presentable screenshots.<br><br>One with the towers is a quick test of the modular system I've described in the last post on that blog, not an environment I really labored on for more than few minutes or actually want to keep, for example. I'm capable of creating a very nice and detailed environments with traditional environment art techniques, but that would be wasted work. Specifically, I don't want to create one nice room per month, - I want to create a system that will generate thousands of nice rooms out of thousands of nice pieces which can still be authored within a month.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'll need some of that immortality committee juice to manage both that and a Blame! game in my lifetime :^)</br>  <br>think for yourself</br>  Anyway, gotta go. Please ping me on tumblr if a Blame thread pops up again and someone will want to ask something - I try to keep up, but I usually see them two days late and archived.  <br>You're a motherfucking genius.</br>  <br>But that dogma didn't magically come from nothing. It came from Gauna killing and pursuing humans through space and literary destroying earth. The gauna established themselves as being evil by being the aggressors.<br><br>You can be critical all want to make yourself feel smart for "daring" to questioning the dogma, but you are a dumb-ass if you can't take the step forward and put 1+1 together to figure out gaunas are no good with the overwhelming evidence that supports it.<br><br>The road o hell is paved with good intentions.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>We clearly think very differently about this topic, so I'll just leave it here.</br>  <br>Let me put it as simple as possible so you can understand me more.<br><br>Sidonia is presumably the last bastion of humanity. Gauna want you and not only your family but even the whole human race dead for reasons you don't know.<br>Questioning if they happen to be evil at this point is the same as not doing anything at all which essentially is the same as not defending yourself.<br><br>When two forces fight all concepts of "everything is a shade of gray" vanishes. It's kill or be kill.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>If that's the mindset you want to adopt, fine with me. I just find the dogmatic hatred of an organism that does not seem to have any inherent intelligence pointless. I can understand why most people would still hate them, and I can understand why Kobayashi makes use of it. <br><br>I originally really only wanted to say that I wouldn't call Hoshijiro naive for entertaining the idea that the gauna might be trying to communicate.</br></br></br>  <br>It's naive because she is seeing upfront how the gaunas form of communication is viciously murdering your comrades.<br><br> I just find the dogmatic hatred of an organism that does not seem to have any inherent intelligence pointless. <br>How many times do I have to say this, It's not the perceived intelligence that made Gauna evil. It was their actions against humanity that earned them right of being called evil.<br><br>Actions anon, the very thing that sets everything in motions. Not ideas or thoughts.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The scale of the Gauna's destruction is beyond biblical. They have literally destroyed humanity's homeworld, cast them amongst the stars, and continue to relentlessly pursue them. After thousands of years, they pretty much are a sort of hellish religious entity to the people of Sidonia. Of course, we have seen that not everyone on Sidonia sees this way as there were quite a few chapters dedicated to the pacifists.</br>  <br>And they got BTFO</br>  <br>If you want to call it evil, fine. It's a matter of perspective and opinion, I suppose. Besides I'm too tired to keep this discussion going, so I'm going to excuse myself.</br>  When did we go from arguing who's best space tentacle to philosophy and shit?  <br>Fuck off newfag, this is how the threads where before chapter 63.</br>  <br>Arguments over subjective topics that won't go anywhere? Oh right, 4chan. /co/ has really brought my tolerance for this shit way down.</br>  <br>Slow manga with weird "recent" developments that incite waifufag bickering. Second seasons ended with no confirmation of a third. There really isn't all that much to talk about.</br>  <br>From humanity's perspective they are "evil". But in the sense that fish would consider sharks and other predators to be "evil"</br>  <br>On /co/ that means waves of waifuposts that are quickly and efficiently distilled into /d/ tier fapfics. How does /a/ deal with it nowadays?</br>  <br>I tried I couldn't find anything.<br><br>Anyone got this twitter post?</br></br></br>  <br>Someone post the formation argument.</br>  <br>We made /d/.</br>  <br> /d/ tier fapfics <br><br>If this isn't happening already, Sidonia isn't far off.</br></br></br>  <br>Start an Izana thread and you will see.</br>  <br>Right, dick unity and such.<br><br>I won't lie, wouldn't mind.<br>Need some hot space tentacle on robot action.</br></br></br></br>  <br>You can say Tsumugi, and Smoogyfags, have ruined everything nice about Sidonia.<br><br>Or Nihei is trying to bring it back to normal recently.</br></br></br>  <br> tfw don't care about Smoogy <br>Her mom is infinitely more interesting.</br></br>  <br> Or Nihei is trying to bring it back to normal recently. <br><br>I have no fucking clue what he's trying to do.</br></br></br>  <br>Kill the Smoogy</br>  <br>I followed, please don't give up this looks amazing.</br>  <br>How many times has Smoogy almost died, though?</br>  <br>Twice, including the latest one.</br>  <br><br>Nah, he will pull a Biomega ending, that's sure.</br></br>  <br>Please no, she is too pure.</br>  <br>Nobody with a grandma as foxy as Izana's is pure.</br>  <br>But she clearly is.</br>  I WANT TO MARRY IZANA!<br>I WANT TAICHOU TO WIN!<br>I WANT TSUMIGI TO GO AND STAY GO!</br></br>  <br>You're back! I thought the project was dead when you didn't update the blog for like a year.</br>  <br>Nah.</br>  <br>Please, point to the impurity.</br>  We have multiple sub options this time and the determination to fist is stronger than ever.  <br>How delayed is the CR simulcast?</br>   Episode 7   What is going to happen to Hibiki? From my rough trace, it looks like Hibiki's roight leg transfroms into a 3rd scarf.  <br>So delayed you probably can't call it a simulcast, since they say it's going to happen "after summer".</br>  <br>But summer ends on september 21st.</br>  <br><br>She's toast</br></br>  <br>Has to be her leg right?</br>  So close  <br>You guys should calm down 20+ hours with constant symphogear threads one after another is just asking for trouble.</br>  <br>It was the same past season, I dont see the problem</br>  <br>*30</br>  <br>I don't want her to die. She's just starting to have fun in her life again.<br> ;_; </br></br>  Who do you want to see die the most in episode 7? I hope it's Chris again.  <br>But I don't want to see anyone die.  Genjuro </br>  <br>It was also terrible last season when people kept pushing threads for no real reason, just because they were waiting on subs. No one is immune to eternally propagated threads going to shit when there's no new material.</br>  <br>It will be Miyu, then Biki will fuse with and become gungnir.</br>  <br>At least we keep it one thread unlike Fatefags.</br>  <br>Ogawa</br>  <br>Dont go killing off characters that arent in this series</br>  <br> Miyu <br>The plot thickens.</br></br>  <br>Not as bad as Yaharifags who switch threads immediately after hitting the bump limit.</br>  <br><br><br>Dont even respond to it. Its just shit posting at this point. He went on and on about it. He just doesnt want us to talk about anime airing this season.</br></br></br>  <br>In all seriousness daddy issues kind of seem like they're going to be a thing this season and Genjuro is everyone's dad so</br>  <br>The only threads that weren't just mindless posting were the stream one and the single one <br>At this point we are just Nanafags vs Aoifags comiie vs zoid and calling names each other</br></br>  <br>Another little girl daughtered.<br>How can one man be so based?</br></br>  <br>Almost like some kind of miracle</br>  <br><br>Hibiki will be forced into berserk mode by Carol and end up killing Genjuro and becoming an antagonist for the second half of the show until the finale.</br></br>  <br>That would be impossibly sad.</br>  <br>But imagine how hype the finale would be.</br>  <br>So which side would Miku be on?</br>  <br>Miku will kill anyone to protect her waifu</br>  <br><br>is wanting to talk about something you like so unreasonable? <br>We keep to one thread and stay on-topic. Who is it bothering?</br></br></br>  <br>Even  Hibiki? </br>  Is this show worth watching? Can anyone give me the lowdown?  <br>Did you not watch S2?<br><br><br>No. Waste of time.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Lesbians with Super Robot Wars tier of hotblood.</br>  <br>It's like Madoka with singing.</br>  <br>Magical girls use science armor and the power of song to fight evil aliens. It's dumb and fun and exciting. Are you down with exciting dumb fun? It's that. <br><br>Start with the first season obviously, this is the third.</br></br></br>  <br>It's like Love Live with Gundams.</br>  <br>He's upset cause he has one less thread he can shitpost in<br><br><br>It isn't, it's just SAO with singing</br></br></br></br>  I just want to let you guys know that I want to  see Miku  lick Biki's belly.<br> some Maria/Tsubasa mutual navel worship's fine, too. </br>  <br><br>May contain fisting.</br></br>  <br>It's like if you had a Madoka who watched all of G Gundam 11 times and learned everything from it, then put her in a situation where she has to sing and punch the shit out of everything while being mentored by a MAN who just so happens to be an expert in being a MAN</br>  <br>Except the songs are actually good.</br>  <br>It's macross with punching</br>  <br>I wouldn't speculate someone dying just because that producer guy said they made higher ups angry. I mean, look at Punchline, Amamiya Sora said episode 6 was her favorite or something and everyone took it as HUEG PLOT TWEEEST and everyone who hyped themselves got disappointed for no fucking reason.</br>  <br>Nanafags and Aoifags are friends with each other, there are faggots who go too far but they don't really fight against each other.</br>  what's this business about someone dying in episode 7?  <br>Hibiki is going to commit suicide in episode 7</br>  <br>Kaneko said he went over the line in episode 7.<br>Nana said she did a lot of screaming in episode 7.<br>And we all know that 7 is a very important number for Symphogear.</br></br></br>  <br>Rumors, we do know Episode 7 made some higher ups angry.</br>  <br>Theres a ninja secretary pop idol manager who can run on water.<br><br>Theres a guy with superhuman strength whos almost as strong as the main characters if not stronger,hes not a mutant or anything he just like kongfu movies.</br></br></br>  <br>To be fair the last time he hyped up an episode it was the one where Hibiki got her arm ripped off.</br>  <br>PLEASE NO<br><br>NOT AGAIN</br></br></br>  <br> Christian religions consider 7 to be a Holy Number because in Genesis the first book of the Bible it says that God rested on the 7th day and man was created on the 6th day, therefore 777 is thought to be the antithesis of 666. <br> The numbers 3 and 7 are considered both "perfect numbers" under Hebrew tradition. </br></br>  <br>Loli spreading anus confirmed?</br>  So commie or H&amp;D?<br><br>I have no idea now</br></br>  <br>Commie</br>  <br>That on top of all the talk about how suffering this season is going to be and how depressed it made Nana.</br>  <br>raw</br>  <br>H&amp;D.

Blow a hole in it! </br></br></br>  <br>Looking at Glorious Break's lyrics, it sounded like it described getting power out of desperation and embracing the consequences that come along with it. A long shot interpretation, though.<br><br>Kaneko did say that the ending credits song was going to give us an understanding for the tone of GX.</br></br></br>  <br> my fucking face when they just fucking blow like 1/3 of a mountain away </br>  <br> Kanade got replaced by Maria </br>  <br><br>Needs to be updated, S2 had some good eps (1-2, 10) and some really shitty ones (Maria being useless).</br></br>  <br>That chart is so old it's not even updated for when S2 was shit from episode 7-9 and then the ensuing QUALITY.</br>  I went into this show expecting non-lethal combat and battles ending in people being KOed, imagine my surprise to get this .  <br>Proper symphogear rhythm game for vita when</br>  <br>It was for the best. Maria is much cuter than, her voice is better, and cat hair &gt; bed hair</br>  <br>Plausible. If the dolls are so strong that their current gears aren't enough they might be forced into using Dainsleif even though it's probably cursed.</br>  <br>In a previous thread (that might have been on /m/ I forget) the chart went 3D.</br>  <br><br><br>Where have you people been?</br></br></br>  <br>You need to die. Kanade is twice the idol Maria could ever be  and the same goes for the VAs .</br>  <br>When will Chris finally meet her other half?</br>  <br>But Kanade is currently 18.5% of the idol Maria is.</br>  <br>She's going to save Elf9 from coins doll next time</br>  <br>Not sure how this works, but S2 was great except some of the middle. <br><br>And don't tell me people didn't like the last few eps after the moment Chris goes full pic related. Those eps were the hypest shit ever.<br><br>S3 ep1 was great but not as amazing as S2 ep1.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>This fucking chart<br><br>impressive<br><br>How is the anon with the reaction guys chart doing?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No one could decide what single image best represented all of the batshit lunacy in the episode.</br>  <br>I suggested Hibiki supplexing the couch.</br>  <br>Why not a transparent .gif of the galaxy's crossing while the reaction guys are being sucked into a blackhole?</br>  <br>are you fucking kidding me? s3 ep1 was fucking balls to the wall amazing.<br><br>SHE SUPLEXED A FUCKING SPACESHUTTEL<br>THEY WERE SURFING ON ROCKETS<br>SHE PUNCHED THROUGH K2</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  SHE PUNCHED THROUGH K2  <br><br>Pretty sure Chris blew it away with missiles actually.</br></br></br>  <br>Chris's missiles only did like this. Hibiki had to go the rest of the way.</br>  <br><br>Chris smashed the middle section of the mountain into debris, and then Hibiki punched those rocks out of the way.</br></br>  People seem surprisingly calm about the fact the girls have been publicly revealed as basically superheros. I'd expect a crowd of people following Hibiki asking her for autographs and if they can see her punch something.  <br>Well yeah, but then you had the rest of the episode not being as fucking amazing. <br><br>I mean, S2 ep1 started amazing, and when you thought it would slow down for a bit it only continued, S3 ep1 instead actually slowed down, and while I do enjoy yuribait handholding, it's not exactly as good as punching and exploding shit.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Need to re watch the episode at some point I guess.</br></br>  <br>I'm wondering how they swept Hibiki's ass under the rug with the Frontier incident. She yelled her name to the world so that's not something she can just hide.</br>  <br>You think Miku would let that shit fly?<br><br><br>You can't have only action for 23 minutes x 12 episodes, you need time for characterization and set up for following scenes.<br><br>Episode 1 was perfect in that regard.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I was under the impression that's still classified to normal people though. Just that they now work under the name S.O.N.G.</br>  <br>I'm actually hoping it slows down even more in s2 because I want to know more about what's going on. Of course there will still be action since Chris has to have her fight and Hibiki has to deal with Carol trying to danmaku her.</br>  <br>Maria and Hibiki were both on the live worldwide broadcast that Maria used to ask for more phonic gain.  Then Hibiki stripped them both butt naked. <br><br>I don't think people will forget that anytime soon.</br></br></br>  <br>At the end of s2 I think Maria was still broadcasting when Hibiki took Gungnir from her.</br>  <br><br>Just saying, the hype factor in S2 and S3 ep1 is different, and I think S2 ep1 was better. That's all.<br><br>I enjoyed the ep a lot and I'm glad Symphogay is back.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Not to mention stopping the shuttle crash was pretty high profile and a fair deal of people saw them do it. And they're running around rescuing people from burning buildings without any attempt at being covert.</br></br></br>  <br>Inb4 Maria was the one broadcasting so whatever Hibiki, or Ver said weren't recorded.</br>  <br>Well the shuttle was the incident that made them go public. Before that it was still secret.</br>  <br>It is a private school, and it's been a few months since the shuttle incident. And it's not like the school didn't previously have a super popular idol attending it. There's probably plenty of security to keep randoms out at least.</br>  <br> 2 pilots <br> SONG, Maria's group <br> a bunch of people in a middle of nowhere <br>I don't think they have internet in that village so they don't need to worry much about hiding identities.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Carol makes Hibiki go berserk <br> Genjuro is forced to try and stop her because reasons and fails <br> Hibiki barely manages to gain control and holds Genjuro in her arms as he dies <br> LOOK, THE EAST IS BURNING RED! </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>that scene gave me a WHY boner</br></br>  Is it Friday yet?  <br>I'm a sufferingfag but that's almost too much even for me. Like, Hibiki's real dad was an abusive drunk who abandoned her, then she gets a really supportive surrogate dad who genuinely cares about her, but she loses control (largely due to her aforementioned troubled past) and kills him? That's really fucking dark.</br>  <br>Satan wills it.</br>  <br> Episode 7 </br>  <br>  Genjuro gets decapitated, his head rolls to a stop on the ground. <br>  "Don't just stand there! Pick up my body and take me to the hospital!" <br>  Cut to Genjuro in the hospital with his head bandaged back on </br></br></br>  <br>Seriously. I'm not sure I want this either.</br>  <br>Satelight marketer, please go.</br>  <br>It gets worse when you factor Tsubasa into the equation.</br>  <br> Why does it curve and also go straight? </br>  <br> needing to go to the hospital <br><br> "Hibiki-kun! Toss me to my body!" <br> Genjuro's headless body picks his head up and just throws it back on <br> cracks his neck and assumes a fighting stance </br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Mountain </br>  <br>I got the impression the scattershot missiles penetrated the mountain and reduced it to some kind of rubble (apparently in a a very linear fashion) and then Hibiki smashed through the boulders and rocks to clear the path. That's my headcanon at least.</br>  <br>She's ending up as the audience's waifu stand-in, and I don't like it.</br>  <br>This is the original version I made,  but somebody added the straight line and everyone seemed to like it and I still don't get it. I want to be included. </br>  <br>I agree, people will argue that Symphogear has always had dark and edgy parts but they've all either been in the characters backstories or been immediately fixed. Nothing permanently edgy has really happened.</br>  <br>The action looked better in this episode because it wasn't all dark and muddled by that filter. I like the characters in Symphogear too, so I appreciated the setup more here too. S2 concert and Hibiki's song was better though, though Radiant Force ends up equalizing that aspect.</br>  <br><br>Oh shit, never mind.

Probably moreso than Tsubasa got over Kanade.</br>  <br>Until she has to fight zombie Serena.</br>  <br>She tries and she's still shit. She had like one real fight so far, and that was at the beginning of G where she still got her ass handed to her by Tsubasa and needed help from Dess and Jii</br>    <br>It was never fair, Tsubasa is super overpowered and Maria had to pump herself full of linker to use a gear at all.</br>  <br>This is the face she makes when I suck her off is what I imagine.</br>  <br>Except she didn't even use her armed gear in that fight and almost held her own without it.

I got "up" too.</br>  <br><br>I don't understand all the Maria hate.<br>She just wanted to protect her lolis.</br></br></br>  <br>I don't think wearing old glasses is enough to prove that was centuries ago. That burning could have taken place on another planet for all we know.</br>  <br>And they ended up nearly killing eachother while Maria got bitchslapped twice by the person she entrusted their lives to.</br>  <br>Ah. Maybe.<br><br>Well she's all about alchemy right? It wouldn't be surprising if she were immortal. People have also been suggesting that she makes new bodies for herself, and that Elfnein is a defective one, hence "Scrap Material #11".</br></br></br>  <br>it could simply be in some weird eastern European country.<br>Some of those still live in the middle ages.</br></br>  <br>No one hates her, people just likes to bully her.</br>  <br>Now that's a literal shit taste.</br>  <br>Why would I go sleep at 7:44?</br>    <br>I don't think Carol is an eastern European name.</br>  <br> Answer me, Hibiki!

Fine wanted to talk to god again and Ver wanted to be an action hero.

They have much lower quality.</br></br>  <br><br>I was honestly thinking of Chris &amp; Shirabe/Kirika pre-befriending</br></br>  <br>Because it's just concentrated hype. I'm using H&amp;D release so I can just keep watching in between scenes.</br>  <br>They didn't want revenge either.

I'll scan whatever hasn't been scanned yet.<br><br>If you mean that particular image, I'll scan it once it shows up, if nobody else has.<br><br><br>GX already feels like a culmination of everything that happened in the first 2 seasons. It's going to be amazing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's more, they now have enough people to go full Symphogear Rangers.</br>   You're so greedy wherever you go translated as you never do things halfway, do you? <br><br>What?</br></br>  <br>You're my hero</br>  <br>http://a.pomf.cat/skuhuw.webm</br>  <br>I like providing for my Symphobros.<br><br> I lurk /a/ and /m/ threads, so if there's anything that comes out and doesn't scanned right away, I can try tracking things down.  </br></br></br>  <br>Well this is pretty alright...<br> the anti seizure filter <br>My fucking sides.</br></br></br>  <br>Never leave us anon. We need you.</br>  <br><br><br>Upload it to the boorus, too. (danbooru, gelbooru, yande.re, chan.sankakucomplex, etc.)</br></br></br>  anyone here tried the [H&amp;D] release? I'm downloading that right now, they're a new group but there's already quite a bit of seeds.  <br>I wasn't entirely planning on scanning everything from the magazine, So I was going to setup an account for that anyway.<br><br><br>Not sure if I prefer them over Commie or not, but they have chapters for each main scene, so it's nice for rewatching parts.<br><br><br>I just really like Symphogear is all.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Anyone here knows what the heck Hibiki's ranting about in this CM.<br>http://www.nicovideo.jp/watch/sm266<wbr>35280</wbr></br>  <br>summary: OH NO ALIENS INVADING KILLING PEOPLE BUT WAIT SCHOOL GIRLS AND IDOLS BEAT THE SHIT OUT OF THEM WHILE SINGING AND SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR LUNGS JUSTICE AND FRIENDSHIP AND LESBIANISM PREVAIL THE END <br>Isn't it wonderful? I actually can't stop watching it.</br></br>  <br><br>Am I remembering wrong? I thought the last thing that happened with her in G was her wheelchair turning into a mech and saving her?</br></br>  <br>She was still stuck up in space and was dying from cancer or whatever anyway.</br>  <br>And she subsequently puked up some more blood, and collapsed.<br>Off screen though, so room for changes.</br></br>  <br>Thanks anon<br><br><br>I'm seeding the OSTs and Character CDs right now.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I prefer H&amp;D over Commie, even with them still needing some more experience. They are doing a fairly direct translation, without the heavy localization that Commie is known for.</br>  <br>I'm going to be so upset if she never shoots that thing this season.</br>  <br>She died in the Lunar Ruins after being ejected by Ver from the Frontier.</br>  <br><br>S2 version has been around since it finished airing.</br></br>  Anyone start tearing up a bit when Hibiki told those dude not to give up living?<br><br>I'm not even suicidal but having Y Aoi cheer me on made me a little emotional.</br></br>  <br> Tearing up a bit <br>My hype just started building up there and it never stopped so no<br><br>I need to listen to rising force again</br></br></br></br>  <br>I liked the one with them all cheering with noodles in their mouth like noodle jiichan</br>  <br> rising force <br>is that the first song? is there a rip for it?</br></br>  Has anime finally hit ideas rock bottom?  <br>No, the fire rises.</br>  <br>You say it like other medium spawn original ideas.</br>  <br>Actually this may be one of the more creative social commentaries that anime has done toward the recent 'public morals' push that the Japanese government has been making. <br><br>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo<wbr>_Metropolitan_Ordinance_Regarding_t<wbr>he_Healthy_Development_of_Youths</wbr></wbr></br></br></br>  There's a show this season called Bikini Warriors, about...female warriors in bikini armor.<br><br>And a show called Pillow Boys about...cute boys who fall asleep.<br><br>So yeah.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I heard that this is 1984: the anime. How true is this?</br></br>  Yes  <br>There's a fantasy show which has setting inspired by Ancient Mayan/Aztec civilization.<br>And a show in OP pic which  says is creative.<br>So, what's your point?</br></br></br>  <br>This is more of a Fahrenheit 451</br>  <br>more like Fahrenheit 451: Ecchi edition</br>  <br>That looks extremely painful.</br>  <br>But is Japan not running out of young people?

It would normally be a 7 at most.</br>  <br>Stop replying to him you're only making him stronger!</br>  <br>You forgot the fantastic Cowboy Bebop and Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso.</br>  <br> Legend of Gaylactating Homos </br>  What should I pick back up bros or all these shit?  The only people who rate shokugeki low are uppity mangafags. Don't even bother trying to argue it.  <br>Just pick up Tesagure and be free.</br>  <br>I haven't read the manga, but Shoukugeki is a 3/10 at best.</br>  <br>Sure you haven't ;)</br>  <br>Ninja Slayer without a doubt.</br>  Shokugeki is shit but it's the only one I get excited to watch every week.  <br> ;) <br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>I haven't read the manga.<br><br>I rate SnS as 4/10. Most overrated show of last season.</br></br></br>  <br> Grisaia 3rd <br> Ore Monogatari and Arslan at the bottom <br> No Gintama whatsoever <br> Triage X not dead last <br><br>Wow that's a bait if I ever saw one.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What the fuck is this trash?<br>Leave /a/ immediately.</br></br>  <br> Didn't even watch Euphonium but thinks he can decide for all of /a/ <br>Please kill yourself and take your shit taste with you.</br></br>  <br>Clearly you haven't seen Vampire Holmes,  but neither have I.  I think it's safe to say Gunslinger, Denpa Kyoushi, Vampire Holmes, and Triage X are all objectively shit.</br>  <br>this<br>Eupho is probably one of the funnest series this season.</br></br>  <br>Yuri trash goes on /u/, buddy.</br>  My cookies are finally done. Who wants one?  <br> hating a show because homosex/u/als killed it </br>  <br>Did you even watch the show?</br>  <br><br>The irony.</br></br>  <br><br>I've seen about 3/4 of the blue ones and they're all shit. Ive heard the occasional good word about kekkai sensen and punchline on /a/ though. For whatever that's worth.</br></br>  <br>Why would I watch yurishit? I don't even play the trumpet.</br>  <br> you have to play an instrument to understand a show <br>You're really good at pretending to be a retard.</br></br>  <br>They're overhyped shit don't do it. Both of the 1st episodes made NO SENSE WHATSOEVER so I dropped them.</br>  <br>You remind me of a guy who said Danganronpa was shit because it was moe.</br>  <br> dropping shows you rate as 5/10 (average) and higher <br><br>u wot m8</br></br></br>  <br>Why would I continue to watch an anime I think is just average or just fine?</br>  <br>Yeah...... pretending...........<br><br>(I hope they don't realize that I'm actually a big fat baka.....)</br></br></br>  <br>The show wasn't even yuri, you fucking retard.<br> Main character isn't interested in childhood friend <br> MUST BE A DYKE <br>Maybe if you'd stop self inserting into all the worst beta faggots in every show you'd like Hibike.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I really, really like this copypasta</br>  <br>My nigga. SnS is most overrated next to Euphonium. <br><br> funnest series <br>That's all fine and dandy anon but how far does "fun" cute girls doing cute things ger you in terms of ratings and aots status? Honestly, this shit is a 6 at best and that's only because I was somewhat of a bandfag. <br><br>I also dropped kekkai after an episode. I don't share my personal opinion with a bro unless I've seen the whole thing though.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Euph <br> cute girls doing cute things </br></br>  <br>But Erina is good too, you just need to try getting past her arrogant personality to appreciate her (which sadly many don't), does anyone else praticise the same thing?</br>  <br>I physically cringed.<br><br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br>  <br>g-gomen......</br>  <br>Would you have watched it if they weren't KyoAni blobs, anon? Tell the truth. <br><br>It wasn't strictly cgdct but goddamn. You need more than moeblobs, decent band drama, and yuri bait to be deserving of aots.</br></br></br>  <br> ITS THE ARTSTYLE, ANON, THATS WHY ITS BAD <br><br>This thread is complete trash.</br></br></br>   Fateshit <br><br>It's just a meme that people like it right? <br>You'd have to be a chuuni edgelord to think that it's anything but a plotridden mess.</br></br></br>  Clearly you plebs no know nothing about good taste in manga, I bet you prefer reading manhua and love to self insert yourself in anime. Truly pathetic, but it's fine, being the japanese born gentlem/a/n that I am, I truly know what is best for you all.

In episode 3 they get this thing that's powered by unit 1</br>  <br><br><br>I swear to god if you don't say is from Eva 3.0 I would have never guessed, and I watched the movie. That thing doesn't look like anything I remember from it.</br></br></br>  <br>It's that giant ship at the start that Asuka and Misato etc are in. I'm pretty conflicted that it's a thing to begin with</br>  <br>Pochaco erryday</br>  <br>I'm glad I've never watched any Eva shit except the original series when it was first on TV in english.</br>  <br><br>I remember the giant ship, just not that it looked like a digimon/zoid.</br></br>  <br>Yeah I don't blame you. The rebuild so far has kinda slaughtered everything<br>Asuka is a bitch with no explanation. Misato is just a slut, nothing on her daddy issues and Shinji  causes the third impact and is in a coma for 14 years and comes back and is sorta okay with the fact he killed nearly everyone and is eager as fuck to get back in unit 1 but everyone hates him and Misato threatens to kill him if she catches him piloting an eva <br><br>That may be from how they didn't show the whole thing very often. But I might be remembering it too vaguely</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I liked Rebuild 1&amp;2. But 3.0 just butchered everything about the series.</br></br>  <br>Agreed<br>But I would have like some back story to Mari</br></br>  <br>I got pissed at 3.0.</br>  <br>By the sounds of it a lot of people did</br>  <br><br>Because first 2 are basically what you already know but with more action and a few different things here and there, which is nice. 3.0 is just, quite literally, what the flying fuck am I watching? Nothing makes fucking sense, at all.</br></br>  No new Haruhi figures for the spinoff, yet?<br>Odd.</br>  <br>Don't forget about the fact that nothing that they showed on the preview actually happened.</br>  <br>Don't forget the gigantic budget and the addition of Mari  Sue </br>  <br>We've been over this anon, he didn't cause the impact.</br>  <br>According to the rebuild he did</br>  <br><br><br>Yeah, I forgot about this too.</br></br></br>  <br>No, it was stopped before the impact took place.<br>Come on anon we figured this out ages ago.</br></br>  You're still getting this, right?  <br>Only if I have enough money to.</br>  <br>Depends who makes it</br>   I know nobody cares about this but I won't be here for 30 days since I have three finals pending and the Cisco 200-120 test   <br> liking the shitty Illya spin-off <br><br>It ruined best girl.</br></br></br>  <br>Nobody cares indeed.</br>  <br><br>If Amakuni is the one doing it, yeah. Alter would also be a good option, but I consider Amakuni way ahead of them when it comes down to nude/semi-nude figures.</br></br>  <br>It made her into*</br>  <br>I don't even know who you are and who on /a/ would even care?</br>  Still in stock at Amiami, I don't get it, this saddens me, does that means that she's going to bin?.<br><br><br><br>guess what buddy?, you're going to fail on all of those three, now get lost.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I saw that. It is 100% for sure a bootleg. It wasn't even the same material as the official, for starters.</br>  How's Manda for doujins? Like, how is the the quality usually?  <br> I don't get it <br>Snake type monster girls are only popular when they are Lamias.</br></br>  <br>Perfectly fine.</br>  <br>She already binned to 12k on Amazon.</br>  <br>But didn't they say straight up in 3.0 that he caused the third impact at the end of 2.0?<br>In 3.0 the 4th impact nearly happens, if that's what you're thinking</br></br>    <br>I really want to but I might get v&amp;</br>  Which do you prefer for your waifu, daki or artbook?  <br>Daki so I can hug her</br>  Would you buy a H-manga from your favourite artist for 5k yen?  <br>That's not really binning considering her price is 12.5k at AmiAmi with their usual discount.</br>  <br>Are you serious? Daki.</br>  Did the Mage for Bikini Warriors get shown yet?  So how do you guys clean the semen off your figs after you're done? I usually just use hot water, but I'm wondering there's a better way.  <br>No.</br>  What's the most recent order you placed? I just put a bid down on a Greek island.  <br>Can never have enough daki covers, but her appearance in artbooks is slim, and I have a handful of covers. I'd take an artbook at this point, honestly.</br>  <br>Well if you consider that Alter's Selvaria was at 18k at some point, and since the face of the Vertex's one is more faithful to Raita's style, I would have expected to see her soul out faster.<br><br>Yeah but she's at 12,5K (with the discount of course)at amiami (brand new), so it's basically the same.<br><br><br>Wasn't that Non-virgin artbook around 4,5K?</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nop, that's the price with Japanese txa removed and Amiami's discount. You have tot take in to consideration the Japanese market.</br>  <br>What was the open bid?</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127665190 <br>Steal her collection?

Oddly enough she's 12.5k on their international site and 14.5k on their Japanese site.<br><br>But Amazon tends to have bigger discounts faster anyway.</br></br></br>  <br> conservative muslim nation <br>Sweden?</br></br>  Since I friend gave me a rinko figurine as a present, I got curious about love plus so I played it, in the end it was pretty monotonous and boring, I can't really understand the all hype about it back then, it doesn't seem that different in comparison to true love to me.  <br>I think he's talking about "Great" Britain</br>  <br>Checked<br> Brits have a muslim problem </br></br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;127665190 <br>when did he start posting pics of himself<br><br>where can I find these!?</br></br></br>  <br>So it is a boy?

If you watched the anime and actually paid attention is not going to be hard to get what you're watching. <br><br>3.0 is nothing like it since it not even introduces you anything, it just launches you into whatever the fuck that world is and expect you to get the shit that's happening, with characters being completely different from what you knew from the previous Rebuild movies. At almost no point they try to explain you anything, once the movie finish you're left feeling like you just skipped a movie or got into an anime mid way. <br><br>If you like that, good for you.

I know it's positive for the most part, but hearing the fuck ups is amusing anyways.  <br>sometimes that happens, it's better to order sealed/unopened for that reason.</br>  <br><br>Yeah, those are good. They are basically a retell from NGE with more action and a less personal problems of each character.</br></br>  <br>No Mandarake hasn't done me wrong yet</br>  <br>I got an unopened samurai months ago and found slight brown discoloration on her torso area. At first I thought it was just japanese semen folded X-times but I realized only recently that it was probably exposed to a shit light bulb with high wattage.<br><br>I also found 'dirt' on alter senhime's breasts which I was able to wash off with water only months later.</br></br></br>  Anyone support the anime by STUDIO 4C?  <br>Once. I got FREEing's 2012 Racing Miku and she was missing the little wedge that attaches her to the base. Manda, in true Japanese fashion, said it wasn't their fault and it must have happened in transit. Six months later I got a full refund from Japan Post.</br>  <br>Whenever I order something opened, I ask them for pics and most of the time they'll get back to me before it getting sold. Nice folks. Haven't done me wrong yet. Only bought 14 figures from them though.</br>  <br>I'm scared to ask but what would the price be on Ganondorf?</br>  <br>Ignore me, just read you said to ask on MFC. I feel dumb.</br>  <br>Do that. He said $450 a while back though.</br>  <br>Hmmm that's a week's pay. I do like my ganondorf though, even though its /v/ related and wouldn't fit in too well with my /a/ stuff. Maybe a separate display for him. Thanks for the info though, I'll see what he says on MFC.</br>  Is no one subbing Chaos Dragon or Joukamachi no Dandelion? Both first episodes have been out for days. It's not that I was particularly looking forward to either one, it just tickles my autism if I can't at least check out every new show of the season.<br><br>I suppose I could watch the raws, but my nip isn't quite good enough to really get everything.</br></br>  fansubbing is fucking dead son.<br>Personally I blame the jews.<br>My nihongo isnt 100% either but we might aswell start now considering its not gonna get any better.</br></br>  <br>Not even CR? Damn that's sad.</br>  <br>CR is falling apart lately. They've been losing ground to competitors.<br>Daiz warned them, but the CEO didn't listen.</br></br>  If it doesn't get HorribleSubs then nobody subs it.  Both shows have been picked by Funi, who's late with a shitload of shows this season. CD has some subgroup working on.  <br> fansubbing is fucking dead son. <br><br>Sad but true.<br><br><br><br>Yeah I figured at least CR or Funi would do them. They still might I guess, they often delay new stuff at the beginning of the season. Maybe they are still figuring out who is going to get what for the less hyped shows.<br><br>Don't even get me started on the more obscure stuff I was hoping to check out, like Kurayami Santa, or the Salaryman short. I doubt we'll even get raws for some of those types of things. <br><br>Hopefully some heroic fansubber like Mori might at least do Wakkako Zake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's usually like this at the beginning of a season. Both are picked up by Funi and Chaos Dragon also has DDY (01 @ Edit/TS).</br>  <br>Your best hopes are probably with commie.</br>  <br> Both shows have been picked by Funi <br><br>I can't decide if this is good news or bad. At least we'll get subs, but they will be abysmally bad ones, and no one else will do them.<br><br>Why is Funi getting everything this season? It's a shame. If they're going to go big and grab up so many shows they should at least make some effort to up their quality levels.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> they should at least make some effort to up their quality levels. <br>When has that ever happened?<br>If anything they'll get worse as their awful translators get overworked because fuck if they're going to hire more.</br></br></br>  <br> they should at least make some effort to up their quality levels. <br> streamfags <br> caring about quality </br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd be fine with that. I get why Commie gets a lot of hate, but I don't care about some slightly overdone localization or a meme here or there if I'm at least getting some fucking subs for the less popular shows. My nipponese is good enough that Idon't need to have honorifics and shit in the subs, I can hear them. Sometimes Commie is great when they actually do something seriously. When they are just fucking around and memeing they are bad, but better than nothing.<br><br><br><br>Again, sad but true.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  Thank god  spanish  speedsubs still exists  http://fansubdb.com/wiki/Summer_201<wbr>5<br><br>Funi is always late for the first episode.</br></br></wbr>  <br> Hopefully some heroic fansubber like Mori might at least do Wakkako Zake. <br>He picked that one up and released the first episode already, but he also mentioned delays for the next few episodes since he'll be in moonland for a while.</br></br>  <br>They don't have to bother because they don't have any competition.<br>I'm still hoping some group will pick up some of their shows like Ranpo Kitan or Prison School.</br></br>  <br> Hopefully some heroic fansubber like Mori might at least do Wakkako Zake. <br><br>Good news. A heroic fansubber (Mori) has done Wakako-zake.</br></br></br>  <br> Funi <br> 15 results <br> Crunchyroll <br> 24 results <br><br>Funi's creeping up. This does not bode well.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   simulcasting gobbles up everything <br> fansubbing dies apart from CR rebrands and BD groups <br> everyone gets complacent as the years go by with their lightning fast releases of shit <br> eventually the gravy train slows down <br> it keeps slowing </br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'm an uncultured burgerclap, but I've considered trying to watch spicsubs. I picked up a little Spanish here and there, and it's an easy language. Took Latin in highschool so that helps.<br><br>Really my time would be better served improving my already semi-conversational moonspeak though.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>Thank you based Mori</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;eventually the gravy train slows down <br>Why would it?<br>Their business model is cheap (all the work they need to put in is write up a few subtitle scripts) and has a huge audience (1% of the English-speaking world?).<br>It's not something that will slow down ever, now that it exists.</br></br></br></br>  I'd rather watch raws than Funi.  <br>I wish ISIS would bomb Funi's offices.</br>  <br> If it doesn't get HorribleSubs then nobody subs it. <br>Welcome to /a/. I would say "enjoy your stay", but really you need to fuck off and die.</br></br>  <br><br>I greatly enjoy memesubbing too, Mori and that Anon who banesubbed Gatchaman might be the saviors of fansubbing. I wish they worked on more memeshows.</br></br>    <br>What did Daiz say to them? Who is competing with CR? Only one I can think of is Netflix but they get old shit</br>  <br>Tried what? I'm being honest here.</br>  <br> What did Daiz say to them? <br>He told them they can't get control of the market if they went with the exclusive rights business model.<br>They said they were going to do it, and now they are losing more and more titles to funimation.</br></br></br>  <br>Anon tried to provoke a hostile reaction from people who are happy that Wakako got subs.</br>  When will Funi die? They're pure cancer.  I want to watch this qt already.  <br>Why are they cancer</br>  What I don't understand is how people still pay for Funi when CR exists. Not to say that CR is good at all but Funi is so dogshit that CR is better just by not being complete incompetent shitheads.  <br>My only complaint is that they darken the colors on all their shows, sometimes to the point where you can't tell what's going on (Bahamut). I can't fault them for hard-subbing their streams, though. Anons who take issue with the mere existence of English anime dubs might also count producing those as a sin on Funi's part, as if English dubbed anime wasn't what got them into Japanese cartoons.</br>  <br>They charged money for their Nourin sub.</br>  <br> darken the colors on all their shows <br>Why do they even do this?</br></br>  <br>They're both bad anyway</br>  <br> darken the colors <br><br>Why even fucking bother with this? Whats the point?</br></br></br>  Fansubbing has been dead since CR became popular. We're living in a time where no one except CR subbed a Tomino Gundam show. How in the fuck does that even happen?  <br><br>It's not deliberate. Their colour range gets fucked up by default, so you just have to manually fix it. Takes two seconds with MadVR.</br></br>  <br>Pic related is my best guess. Perhaps someone has an answer in the archives.</br>  Are Underwater and DDY the only ones subbing summer shows so far?  <br> How in the fuck does that even happen? <br><br>When the show wound up being shit.</br></br></br>  <br>How do I do that in MPV? Or, rather, what exactly should I be trying to do to fix the color range?</br>  <br>Because the R1 subs are good?</br>  <br>The problem wasn't CR. It was G-reco.</br>  <br> commie did a thing. </br>  <br>Also Glitch and Mori. FFF got Classroom Crisis subbed today as well.</br>  <br>The answer's pretty obvious</br>  <br>Changing the output level does not fix the awful colors. It makes it a little better but it's still complete garbage.</br>  <br>FFF and Commie also released stuff.</br>  <br>You can't really trust FFF. They either release shows quickly or end up several weeks behind (Nisekoi, Hibike etc.). I'd rather just stick with HS. <br><br><br>Vivid is doing Durarara right?</br></br></br></br>  <br>why would you go with FFF for Nisekoi</br>  It's been 10 years since this ended and nobody subbed this series besides the first two episodes  <br>Durarara, NNB and Gakkou Gurashi apparently.</br>  <br> mfw those Psycho Pass releases </br>  <br>why don't you sub it</br>  <br> You can't really trust FFF. <br>As true as that is, it doesn't really follow as a response to "FFF has released subs for a summer show."<br><br>I'd hope Vivid is on DRRRRRR, but it's hard to tell with their standard radio silence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't. I'm just telling you about some shows FFF has subbed.</br>  Somebody please pick-up Dandelion.  <br>CR didn't sub it iirc tho<br><br>HS had to rip from some Aussie anime streaming service that got official subs</br></br></br>    <br>But I'm THAT Anon and I didn't try to provoke any hostile reaction. With being honest I meant I like their memesubs.</br>  <br><br>Every group is really slow at the weekend, has been like that for a few seasons now. It used to be the other way around.</br></br>  <br> Is Underwater the only one subbing summer shows so far? <br><br>Looks like it. I know Commie released Symphogear but I'm not watching it so I don't care.</br></br></br>  DameDesuYo just released Working!!! 10 seconds ago.  <br>Funi needs more "-Couldn't read this part, but she's saying something about food-" and obvious translation errors.</br>  <br> mfw when gg used to release CG subs in like 4-5 hours on Sundays <br><br>rip in peace gg</br></br></br>  <br> http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>708393</wbr> <br>kek</br></br>  <br> The torrent you are looking for has been deleted for the following reason(s): <br> Web source video is limited to 1280x720p or source resolution, whichever is lower. <br>SASUGA CARTEL<br>Seriously, fuck Daiz and his fuckbuddies.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I miss those times</br>  <br> literally wanting to download eye cancer <br><br>Are you retarded?</br></br></br>  <br>Do Funi not get scripts for the simulcasts?<br>CR are confirmed to.</br></br>  <br>It's simulcast, who gives a shit?</br>  <br>touche</br>  <br> eye cancer <br>Where?</br></br>  <br>I hope they don't, otherwise that would make them even more incompetent.<br>the only reason I can come up with for their subs in shows like Norin is that they weren't able to get a script or see the episode before making the subs.</br></br>  <br> Note about the script. We’ve included four versions in the order below: <br><br> Honorifics + Popura <br> Honorifics + Poplar <br> Localized (more than just removing honorifics) + Popura <br> Localized (more than just removing honorifics) + Poplar <br><br>This is worse than Daiz's subs for Saki.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> cartel <br>what</br></br>  <br>This is actually pretty neat.</br>  Attack No 1 will never be subbed<br>Wandering Sun will never be subbed<br>Oishinbo will never be subbed<br>Sunset on Third Street will never be subbed<br><br>Why bother getting out of bed?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's shit.<br>Why bother subbing it.</br></br>  <br>Fuck off, newfag.</br>  <br><br>I prefer literal, but I don't understand why people care so much about this.

Should have waited for BS11.</br>  <br>You have to understand that every fansubber since the beginning of time has been the most attention whoring pieces of shit. Herkz and his group of loonies are the worst of the bunch.</br>  <br>Yes, why not? They're huge enough faggots.</br>  <br>Nice /pol/.</br>  <br> why not <br>Probably because they're not as dumb as you</br></br>  <br>Nice /v/.</br>  I don't know why groups like FFF even bother picking up like 8 shows when they can never finish them. Did they finish a single show that they picked up in the Spring? <br><br>What tremendous fuckups.</br></br>  <br>Pretty much describes /a/ in a nutshell.</br>  <br>I'd and most of the other staff would quit if that happened.</br>  <br>stop trying to shift the subject commie dev, i know your trying to make people ignore your shit fuck off</br>  <br>You just wait.</br>  <br>I fucking hate commie and never use their releases in the first place. I'm just getting tired of FFF's bullshit.</br>  You will never watch more than 26 episodes of Bobobo-Bo Bo-Bobo with subs  <br> commie devs trying to shift the blame to FFF so people ignore their shits </br>  <br><br>Commie is an amazing subgroup, look at how they finished Yahari while FFF hasn't even gotten halfway.</br></br>  <br> literally a commie dev <br>And I wondered why this thread is so shit. Pls go and stay go.</br></br>  <br> mom look I posted it again! </br>  <br>They finished Danmachi</br>  <br>Herkz is drowning in his own unwarranted self importance. It doesn't help that almost everyone on NT trips over themselves to suck his cock and worship him like a deity.</br>  <br><br/></br>  How do I encode like Commie?  Watch Herkz whine about this thread on twitter and how everyone's picking on his shit infested group.  <br>does that include you</br>  <br>I stopped downloading FFF for danmachi after they fell 2 weeks behind. I didn't care enough about the show to get quality subs for it anyway. <br><br>Still waiting for them to finish DxD Born and catch up on Rinne.</br></br></br>  <br> Watch Herkz whine about this thread on twitter <br><br>Why would I do that?</br></br></br>  <br>Still waiting for Cthune to finish Rolling Girls because I refuse to watch anything funi makes.</br>  <br>Well, they seem to have realized that picking up that many shows is dumb and only added three shows to their schedule this season, so maybe they're getting a better grip on how much their group can handle.</br>  <br>They dropped Rinne</br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Keep trying Commie dev. FFF is bad but not as shit as your</br>  <br><br>Name one thing bad about commie. <br><br>Protip:  you can't. </br></br></br></br>  <br> and catch up on Rinne. <br>They officially dropped it because it's translator is still missing or something like that.</br></br>  <br>They are Commie.</br>  <br>Fuck. I stopped checking their blog and IRC for updates because they never tell people anything anyway. Last time I went there they were throwing a hissy fit over people bugging them about DxD so I just said fuck it and put the show on hold for now. <br><br>Now I have to settle for whoever HS ripped Rinne from.</br></br></br>  <br> catch up on Rinne. <br>I have bad news, anon.<br><br> Due to members of our staff leaving or going missing, along with other staffing issues, the following shows are hereby dropped and will not be completed: <br><br> Kyoukai no Rinne </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Communism must be eradicated.</br>  <br>Surely being in such an important position of running a major torrent site means he's getting paid handsomely right? <br><br>No way he does it for free like 4chan janitors right?</br></br></br>  <br>I got one<br> &gt;commie </br></br>  <br>herkz is one bad thing about Commie, as demonstrated in this thread.</br>  If nothing else this thread is convincing me to go do my Anki reps.  <br>Memes, overlocalization, unnecessary le epic typesetting jojokes.</br>  <br>More like Eien's dead and he typesetted almost every show FFF did</br>   still waiting for Daiz to finish Rinne no Lagrange   <br>At least they're not scanlators.</br>  Thank god we still have HorribleSubs  <br>You nigger, I fucking hate commie. I even bothered to download non-free uncommied subs from AB to avoid their cancerous meme subs. <br><br>I swore off Commie years ago, unlike you dumb pieces of shit who still insist on using them and lying about how "no they're actually good for ______", because of shits like you they've managed to continue on for years where other groups have withered and died. <br><br>FFF was, for a long time, my favorite group since UTW went tits up. They had good quality encodes and typesetting and did a lot of shows. But they've become too unreliable, and they are increasingly bitchy toward people.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>They officially dropped that a long time ago.</br>  <br><br>Nothing wrong with memes. Take Yahari, it's full of memes and is better for it or else we'd be stuck with a bunch of shitty TL notes.</br></br>  <br> I swore off Commie years ago, unlike you dumb pieces of shit who still insist on using them and lying about how "no they're actually good for ______", because of shits like you they've managed to continue on for years where other groups have withered and died. <br><br>Are you talking about me? Also nice autism commie dev, go back to Rizon already</br></br></br>  <br>I too enjoy my dank and epic maymays in my chinese cartoons!</br>  <br> Cthune <br> not Commie </br></br>  <br>You people call any localization attempt a fucking meme.</br>  <br> Nothing wrong with memes <br><br><br/></br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with scanlators?</br>  <br>FFF became Commie tier with muh epic maymays since the 1st season of Yahari.</br>  <br><br>Well shit. Looks like FFF is going the way of UTW. <br><br>Vivid still only doing like 2 shows a season and I haven't seen anything from Asenshi or Anime-koi in months. Did Caffeine pick up anything?<br><br>And what about that new group? Chyuu? Seems like they sputtered out during spring too.<br><br>More "missing staff"? Is somebody abducting fansubbers?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> redirecting <br>Nice meme</br></br>  If FFF is the face of fansubbing then it should die because of how unreliable and awful their translations are. CR is fast and usually the best translation out there. Only times I will opt for fan subs if it's vivid doing it  <br><br>What was the Japanese line? Chances are it was a perfectly fine localization.</br></br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br><br>Nice meme.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hope you guys are happy, this shit was tedious to write, especially since they wrote a whole goddamn scene around the senpai-kouhai thing.</br>  <br>Fuck off cunt. Go suck Herkz cock.</br>  <br> Is somebody abducting fansubbers? <br>Yes, CR.</br></br>  <br> what's wrong with a group of idiots who actually think they own any part of what they translate and have the gall to put watermarks on scanlations so people come to their site to read it so they can make revenue off someone else's work <br><br>Gee I wonder what's wrong with them.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Commie devs kill yourselves.</br></br>  <br>No, fuck off I haven't download commie in five years, you go suck his cock memelord.</br>  <br>They don't know Japanese or English</br>  <br>They're the most territorial asswipes on the face of the earth</br>  <br>Commie is almost as bad as Funi in my eyes, stopped downloading them long time ago.</br>  <br> mfw gullible idiots actually paid UTW over $5k in donations </br>  <br>People have lives, you know</br>  <br><br>I bet you downloaded HS for Yahari you faggot.</br></br>  <br>Massive drama queens.</br>  <br>Nothing.</br>  Commie devs I know you're in here please sub Joukamachi no Dandelion.  <br>Nice try, Commie dev</br>  <br> watching harems <br><br>No, thanks, I have standards but I can't expect that from a cummie dev<br><br><br>NO FUCK OFF, this has potential tob e AOTS I don't want them to ruin it</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>more than j-drama subbers?</br>  <br> Commie <br> subbing anything that's no already released by HS </br></br>  <br>I wouldn't know, anon. How bad are those?</br>  <br> Is somebody abducting fansubbers? </br>  <br> in my eyes <br>Are you blind or something?</br></br>  <br>How did they sub Symphogear yesterday?</br>  <br> moving the goalposts <br><br>Fact of the matter is that Commie had the best subs for Yahari.</br></br></br>  <br>Or GoPrincess Precure for about 20 odd episodes so far.</br>  <br>Symphogear GX</br>  <br>fuck off they at least released a lot of AOTSs unlike other faggots who steal your money like FFF and Commie.</br>  <br>They still were shit.</br>  <br> Did Caffeine pick up anything? <br>No and I wouldn't expect much from them. They have been slow for months and dropped half of their spring projects.</br></br>  <br><br>No they weren't. Name one way they were wrong.</br></br>  <br>The salt is real</br>  has there been any recent reliable and consistent fansubbing group other than commie?  <br>Don't join a group if you can't commit. Don't make people depend on you and then leave them high and dry with no recourse if you suddenly bail on them. <br><br>Main reason I only do rogue translations here and there wherever I feel like it is because I hate being nailed down long term, hate depending on shitty people who can't work to a time table and slack off on the job. <br><br>I've been around the subbing community long enough to know it's mostly arrogant twats whose main response to pressure is to shirk their job entirely until they feel like coming back to it. I've seen people beg off their end claiming family problems then I see them playing TF2 on steam when they haven't been on IRC for 72 hours. <br><br>FUCK fansubbers and their "lives".</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   this much commieshilling itt <br>Utterly deplorable.</br>  <br>HorribleSubs.</br>  <br>They're gonna die after this season anyway</br>  <br>Retarded shit like this, for instance.</br>  <br>No why would I be salty? I donated them about U$S 200 (because I can do it) and they subbed my favorite shows, I have no <br><br><br>didn't they die already?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Giving fansubbers money, giving anyone money when they normally provide for free, is a surefire way to make sure they stop working.<br><br>It's one thing to pay them on commission, another to just give them free money for existing. It's like with patreon. Pay the artist money to exist, suddenly their output stalls. Wow what a coincidence.<br><br>That said at least UTW's skeleton crew managed to do F/SN this year.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Vivid, which is basically another Commie</br>  <br> steal your money <br><br>How can someone steal my money when I never donated anything to any subgroup? Next time, don't be stupid enough to give money to retarded subgroups.</br></br></br>  <br>More like Funi just put in more money and made better deals with the japanese companies than CR. Though it doesn't matter when CR has been grabbing the better shows so far, plus they grabbed NNB Repeat and Monster Musume at AX two days ago.</br>  <br><br>Not a subbing error.</br></br>  At this point now I ask nothing more than CR subs slapped on CR video debanded or BS11, with typesetting and song translated.<br> CR FR is so much better than CR EN.<br>Also can someone rip Gangsta video from CR FR and upload it?</br> </br>  <br>Good thing they're not all like that</br>  <br> That said at least UTW's skeleton crew managed to do F/SN this year. <br><br>They still haven't released the last episode though.</br></br></br>  <br>yea but they hardly do any shows</br>   tfw too stupid to learn nip  <br><br><br>rip</br></br></br>  <br>DDY, which is saying something cause I can remember when people sneered at their releases.<br><br>Also Vivid is pretty reliable. Their Amaburi subs were kinda shit and too Commie-esque for my taste, but normally they are a very good group that actually releases pretty quickly.</br></br></br>  <br>It's gag anime that only panders to homos. <br>No one's going to fansub it and HS won't do it because there's no official english subs to rip off.</br></br>  <br>That's true, DDY is consistently bad.</br>  <br> I donated them about U$S 200 <br>I didn't think retards like you regularly posted here</br></br>  Well at least Funi have Dandelion cause that looks pretty fun, God knows why they wait a fucking week to release it though.<br><br>Funi are actually the worst company.</br></br>  <br>sup Herkz<br><br>what le epic memes will we get next?</br></br></br>  <br>Herkz pls go.</br>  <br>Maybe. The people I worked with were mostly free agents like me so maybe that's why they were free, cause they're all lazy shits.<br><br>I'm telling you though, I almost want to just apply for a job TLing for CR or Funi or whoever will have me at this point. I'm tired of working with lazy shitheels.</br></br></br>  <br>FUcking newfag you weren't you here when the donation drive happened, a lot of us gave them money, there were capped threads and all</br>  <br>There was another season?<br>I used to love the original back when it aired here on TV.<br>Damn it, why did you have to build me up and immediately put me down?</br></br></br>  <br> a lot of us <br> us <br><br>Nah nigga that was just you and your group of idiots.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Commie devs <br> not shilling themselves <br>They are amon us anon</br></br></br>  <br>rekt</br>  <br>DDY is bad compared to who? Who is left that is better than them? That's what I mean. Years ago there would have been lots of options to put DDY way down the tier list, but now their only competition are groups that drop everything or fucking Commie, so DDY somehow ended up being a top tier group in 2015.`</br>  <br><br>Are you niggas serious? The only "good" release I've seen from them was Noragami (and even then it was simulcasted, the OAD they subbed was horrible).</br></br>  <br><br> guy who knows Japanese vs random anon off the internet <br><br>Gee I wonder whose opinion I should trust.</br></br></br></br>  <br> giving fansubbers money <br>That's like willingly paying for a CR or Funi membership.</br></br>  Commie devs are just butthurt the Yahari gravy train has ended and they are back to being irrelevant. CR really threw them a bone last season releasing that a day late.  <br>Herkz, plz stop your working butthurt</br>  <br> dicksucking herkz vs anon <br><br>Gee I wonder who I should trust</br></br></br>  <br><br>I would pay for CR if it meant killing Funi.</br></br>  <br>Don't worry, nobody believes DDY is any good, but the memecartel is here so we have to attack them.</br>  <br> top tier <br> DDY <br>This thread just gets better and better</br></br></br>  <br> highhorse attentionwhore faggot vs based anon <br>Solved this for you.</br></br>  <br><br>No one gives a shit about Yahari beyond the people in their general. Commie was always irrelevant.</br></br>  <br>No giving fansubbers money is even worse than that. At least CR or Funi are "official" in the sense they actually pay the nip companies some sort of fee. Paying a fansubber is like paying some retarded tranny on tumblr because muh oppression.</br>  <br> my uncle works at gg and they are coming back in the fall <br>I sense epic bait here.</br></br>  <br><br>What does that have to do with knowing Japanese?</br></br>  <br>He doesn't.</br>  <br>They can't improve a simulcast release, that's just how bad they are and whenever they are in trouble (they need to put a lot of effort into a show) they end up falling behind or dropping it, just like every other fansubbing group, the difference is that they suffer from ESL editors and an annoying lack of QC.</br>  <br>I watched the raw and I'm not gonna lie when I say the frame rate and terrible 3D in Chaos Dragon hurt my eyes.</br>  <br>Again: name a group better than them that's still active.<br><br>The only ones that aren't total shit are slow as fuck and whatever they don't drop they are weeks behind on. <br><br>DDY releases consistently and has watchable subs, I put their TL quality at about equal to CRs. And considering they are releasing some uncensored stuff that's censored by CR and Funi, that makes them the best option.</br></br></br></br></br>  Thank god i speak spanish  <br><br>He's an editor, obviously he knows Japanese.</br></br>  <br> I don't know why groups like FFF even bother picking up like 8 shows when they can never finish them. Did they finish a single show that they picked up in the Spring? <br>nope</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what he wants you to think.</br>  <br> the difference is that they suffer from ESL editors <br><br>This, Maria was practically unwatchable (and they even fell behind there).</br></br></br>   mfw people actively wait for commie subs over CR    being EOP   <br><br>Does that make it better? They were still the ones who did that retarded thing.<br>Commieapologists should seriously be rounded up and shot.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah their QC is bad their TL becomes shit if they don't have a better script to copy off of, but what other options exist if you want subs in a timely manner? <br><br>I'm actually asking for options here, cause all the groups I used to depend on are gone.</br></br></br>  <br>Don't you have some touhou to play?</br>  <br>Vivid. Also, I highly doubt you know Japanese. Even if you did, why bother talking about fansun groups?</br>  <br><br>How the hell are you supposed to edit subs without knowing Japanese? All of commmie's subs have lyrics translated, even the ones with CR as TL and herkz for the rest, so of course he has to know some Japanese.</br></br>  <br> he actually believes this <br><br>His job is to take a decently translated script and then add some dank memes for "localization". That's literally all the faggot does. <br><br>If you don't believe me, compare releases from other groups with the same translators but different editors. You will see none of the cancer memes that's prevalent in Comeme subs.</br></br></br></br></br>  not watching dubbed<br>whats wrong with you</br>  <br><br>Just turn off the subs or go to the alternate sub track that they probably provided.</br></br>  <br><br> "B-b-but they did that one anime without any fooling around so that makes them good" <br><br>Absolute trash.</br></br></br></br>  <br> FFF said they are going to do Noragami OADs <br> Noragami S2 is going to air next season <br>FFF still hasn't released the OADs.</br></br></br>  <br> in a timely manner? <br><br>That's the problem here, with shows where you would really need a fansubber they tend to drop the ball.</br></br></br>  <br> vivid <br>Two shows a season, usually popular stuff with lots of alternatives. And when they proved to be the only real choice for a show (like Amaburi) they fucked up majorly.<br><br>I generally like Vivid but they don't sub enough to be relevant to the scene at large.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Is somebody abducting fansubbers? <br>They went and joined ISIS</br></br>  <br><br>It still says a lot about their mentality and what kind of people they are that they would think that it would be a funny thing to include.</br></br>  <br>I just want a subgroup that takes HS subs and puts it with a decent video encode. Commie used to be good at that before they went full meme</br>   yfw herkz is in this thread RIGHT NOW   <br>Also, my Japanese is so-so, I normally only do doujin/manga translation. I don't dabble in fansubbing because I'm not very good at translating by ear.</br>  <br>Gasp.</br>  <br>You don't need to need japanese to edit an english script, what the fuck are you talking about?<br><br>Just try to compare a song translated by commie with a litteral translation, you'll a lot of thing unrelated to the song in it just for the sake of the flow  or the memes .</br></br></br>  <br>why hasn't someone done an automated rip of the subs from HS and mux it onto a raw</br>  <br>Do you even know what an editor does? Hint: They don't translate.</br>  <br>I don't see why they wouldn't be relevant when they've almost always provided the best release for the shows they do.<br><br> they fucked up majorly <br>I'm gonna regret asking, but how so?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Eat shit, this is the best comedy anime<br>Certainly better than that Gintama trash<br> No one's going to fansub it <br>But subs for the first two episodes have been released</br></br></br></br>  <br> OCR for funi's subs is not 100% accurate <br> HS' rips still manage to look better than every public raw <br> need to find .ts <br><br>Why or how would you plan to do that?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Then why make claims of TL accuracy?</br>  <br> Both shows have been picked up by Funi <br>Looks like I'm going to be watching Dandelion raw.</br></br>  <br><br>I've seen shows where CR was the TL and herkz did the rest. Sure the lyrics had liberalizations, but they were way too close to the original meanings to be made-up bullshit. Commie has always sucked for song lyrics, Yahari's OP was especially bad and had nothing to do with herkz.</br></br>  <br><br> Implying attention and donations are not the currency of fansub drama queens </br></br>  <br>Obviously he's not gonna do it because he's lazy scum.</br>  <br>You're free to not donate them and ignore them.</br>  <br><br>Do you really think all they do is sit back and insert memes? They still need to know Japanese to make sure the English meme is an appropriate fit for the Japanese meme.</br></br>  <br>Because I'm not deaf and I can tell when something is mistranslated in the subs. My ability is such that I would have to listen carefully to translate the whole thing without mistakes, I can't just listen casually and then translate instantly, I would have to listen, consider, and then carefully phrase my translation. I would be slow as shit at translating anime. But I could do it.</br>  So, question, why are we talking about fansubbers again? If you hate them so much why do you guys keep giving them attention? They all are lurking in this thread and laughing at us on IRC. Is this really what you guys want?  <br> Nirvana and Geico "references" <br><br>This shit is worse than memes, actually.</br></br></br>  If CR did something Steam-like and let you download anime from their system and watch without the filtering of their web player, would you get a CR membership?  <br>I'm not seeing any discussion of this thread in any of the staff chans I'm in.</br>  <br>Because it's easier to bitch about subs than learn moon.</br>  <br>It's what I want. These threads are gold.</br>  <br> HS' rips still manage to look better than every public raw <br> need to find .ts <br>That's why you spliced in a public raw and put onto the FUNi subs, deband it, inverse upscale it and then encode.<br><br> Also can one register a new account paypal with 0 cash in it, just for the sake of CR free trial? I wanna rip some show and CR give one month of trial because of Japan Expo. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Nigger this happens every couple of months. Just roll with it.</br></br>  <br><br>It's what you get for watching Yahari, the definition of a meme anime.</br></br>  <br>Because they only do 2 shows. Out of like 50 shows going on at any given time. And those shows often have other subs available. So they don't provide a large amount of translation, they don't provide speedy translation, and they don't provide exclusive translation, the only thing they have to offer is superior quality.<br><br> I'm gonna regret asking, but how so? <br>They started fucking up in the episode where they wore the Kanye suit. They wrote themselves into a corner regarding honorifics and verbal tics and went fulll Commie defending their choices.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm gonna be honest here, I was always interested in fansubbing but I don't have the time nor the attention span necessary so I can't help but being interested in the guys who sub my shows.<br><br>The problem is that I ended up hating them after a while and they all are big jerks, or should I say big herkz? Hehe.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>But by doing this you keep feeding Daiz, herkz, Xythar and whoever ego. Why do you like giving attention whores attention?</br></br></br>  <br> It's not that I was particularly looking forward to either one <br>Your action state the opposite anon<br>Quite desperate</br></br></br>  <br><br>Daiz, at the very least, has done a good job so far and deserves the praise.</br></br>  <br> laughing at us on IRC <br><br>Yeah I'm really hurt that people who do something for free (i.e. no monetary compensation) are laughing at me for shitting on their meme cartel</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off Daiz.</br>  <br>Daiz has gone on record saying he doesn't care about fansubbing and only does it because legal options are inferior to the service he can provide for free. <br><br>That's why he takes any legit job he can get in the industry, even if it's working for Fakku.</br></br></br>  <br>What's wrong with xythar? He seems pretty chill.</br>  <br>Then why are you giving them a good time?</br>  <br>Memesubber from the memecartel.</br>  <br>Because I'm having a good time shitting on them.</br>  <br>Because the resulting drama is tanoshii. You know how some people like watching soap operas? This is my equivalent of that.</br>  <br>But they are like little kids, the more you shit on them the more they'll memesub, you're not helping any cause and keep giving them the attention they are craving for. It's like responding to a tripfag.</br>  <br>You're an idiot. You need to grab shows like Gangsta and Arslan to keep the normalfags subscribed.<br><br>Your AOT pleb won't see NNB repeat or Monster Musume and go "I WANNA SEE THAT". They see those and go "creepy japanese bullshit xD"<br><br>From a business model they fucked up. The audience that brings in the money won't want those shows and the audience who would be watching them are downloading HS and Commie rips.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>My point still stands. Stay mad herkz</br>  <br>What?</br>  <br> I happen to be an expert in the dankest of maymays </br>  who else uses kissanime subs here?  <br>I do, they are usually fast to put their shit up and I'm free of memesubbers.</br>  <br><br>That's right, I know Japanese and have studied Japanese memes. My power over memes is twice the power of yours.</br></br>  <br>SJW</br>  When you say Fansubing is dead, do you take into account memesubs such as Commie? because those are alive and well.  <br>Feels good to live for memes.</br>  <br> kissanime subs <br> kissanime <br> subs <br>Kill yourself.</br></br></br></br>  I'm tempted to try and do Joukamachi, but I'm going to wait until episode 2 to see if Funi do actually do it.  <br>Is he a real SJW or "he has a reasonable opinion on a spectrum of issues and I'm mad because he said something opposite to my opinion" SJW?</br>  <br>Are you going to Bane sub it?</br>  Who is the head honcho of commie?  <br>The latter</br>  <br> because those are alive and well <br><br>I'm glad.</br></br></br>  <br>herkz</br>  What would you say is the download split between CR/Funi rips and fansubs is these days? 80/20?  <br>SJWs aren't known for reasonable opinions, anon.<br>That being said xythar is a lot of things but unlike the other anon I doubt he's an SJW.</br></br>  <br>No but I type in a very English way so it might set some people off. <br><br>If I do end up giving it an attempt I'll just post the sub file on /a/ and just time it to ohys raws.</br></br></br>  <br>95/5</br>  Is Doremi the best fansub group now? Timely releases, decent translations, no overly fancy bullshit, still alive, etc.  <br>Give me Bane memes bruv.</br>  <br>I'm poking fun because anons especially on /v/ and /pol/(and hell, people on /a/ do it too) like to call everyone that disagrees with them an SJW.</br>  <br>If you're an idiot, yes</br>  <br> and just time it to ohys raws <br><br>Cool, the video quality I needed.</br></br></br>  <br> ohys raw <br>I don't like this meme</br></br>  OP here. I didn't realize this would turn into one of these UN Summit on the State of Fansubbing and the Meme Cartel threads that we seem to have to collectively shit out every month or so. I just wanted to know if some shows would get subs or not. I suppose the drama is rather entertaining though. <br><br>For the people ITT who actually work for a subgroup, do you guys actually see companys like CR and Funi attempting to recruit fansub group members for paying gigs with them? Do you know people who have taken jobs with one of those companies, or with some other one like maybe Netflix, or a manga localization operation like Fakku or Viz Media or whatever?<br><br>Do they get paid well? Do they telecommute or actually have to move somewhere? Just curious really.</br></br></br></br>  <br>So... You have no idea what it is, then?</br>  I'm surprised CR didn't get anything this season<br>http://www.crunchyroll.com/lineup</br>  <br><br>Or leopard raws, I haven't downloaded that one to check. It's not going to look decent anyway.</br></br>  <br>90/10.</br>  <br>CR is filled with ex fansubbers.</br>  <br><br>It's well-known that CR and Funi hire fansubbers. Obvious choice really, between doing it for money and doing it for free anyone would do it for money.</br></br>  <br>Yes I do, it seems like you're getting overly defensive now though.<br><br>To explain again, there are two types of "SJW" in this world. The crazy fucks that are actually SJW or the "They have a reasonable opinion but I'm calling them SJW because they disagree with me and I'm mad" SJW.<br><br>But anyway, it's a useless buzzword now so what the fuck ever.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>no wonder they are the best subs</br></br>  <br><br><br>Sure, I mean fansubbing is the obvious talent pool from which they would want to hire, I'm more curious how much they get paid and whether they work from home or have to move and go in to an office or whatever. Like do they make a decent living?<br><br>My moon isn't quite good enough to translate anime by ear yet, but I've done a little work on manga scanlations here and there. It's fun, and I would be at least somewhat interested in doing it for money some day given the opportunity, if it were actually worthwhile.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I doubt they make much money, but anything is better than being a NEET. Working for them also kills your passion, imagine being forced to translate Glasslip.</br></br>  <br>I care about fansubbing as long as it gives me something that legal options don't. It's never been deeper than that, though - I don't believe in bullshit like "fansub magic" which makes fansub releases always better than legit ones no matter what.<br><br>And I wouldn't take any legit job in the industry, it'd have to be a position where I can actually do something that matters in terms of digital distribution. FAKKU provides that.</br></br></br>  <br>The master memesubber is here.</br>  <br> bringing up FAKKU when it isn't even part of the discussion <br>The jew strikes again.</br></br>  <br> imagine being forced to translate Glasslip. <br><br>THE HORROR<br><br>Yeah, probably better to just keep improving my nip abilities for my own pleasure on my own time and maybe working on a manga here and there as a hobby. I guess there's probably no way a CR translator makes as much money as most average normal professional type (college required) jobs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>CR pays peanuts for their translators (who are basically all remote contractors) - you can actually make a better hourly wage as a timer there (provided you're fast enough). Other companies may pay more, but I can't say for sure for most of them. Generally speaking you can expect the pay to be pretty low though, AV translators tend to have it pretty rough from what I've gathered in general.</br>  <br> If it doesn't get HorriblySubbed then nobody subs it. <br>Tragic</br></br>  <br>Read the post I was replying to, genius.</br>  <br><br>To be fair, he's done a great job.</br></br>  -1  <br>Here comes the bald faggot.<br>Kill yourself.</br></br>  <br>hi daiz</br>  <br>Nobody summoned you. Leave.</br>  Man, everyone hates on Daiz so hard. He's kind of a faggot but he's not so bad. Underwater were the only ones to sub Sidonia. Even if there was a meme here and there, I'm thankful for that.  Why doesn't /a/ just make their own group?  <br> What do you think most of the fansub groups are? </br>  <br>Because it'd be filled with memes.</br>  <br> implying /a/ has the knowledge or motivation to fansub <br>It's way easier to just bitch about existing sub groups than to try making a new one</br></br>  <br> implying /a/ has the knowledge or motivation to fansub <br>But it seems that, out of every board, /a/ is the one that produces the most content, I'm sure a few people here could get together and make a group that only subs shows that aren't getting subbed.</br></br>  <br>Again, </br>  <br/>  <br> Why doesn't /a/ just make their own group? <br> Imagines the thousands of people bitching about how shitty their subs will be. </br></br>  <br> times badly <br> get paid more than translators </br></br>  <br>People from many sub groups are from here.<br><br>Making an "official" /a/ sub-group isn't a good idea. It would either propably die fairly quickly like most of /g/'s projects or result in useless drama before dying.</br></br></br>  <br> I don't believe in bullshit like "fansub magic" which makes fansub releases always better than legit ones no matter what. <br>It's not really magic. If you can get something of roughly the same quality for free for very little effort, why wouldn't you take the free option? Until legit subs provide a substantive advantage over fansubs, fansubs won't go away, and I don't that will happen as free is hard to beat.</br></br>  <br>That's why CR also has AOT and Funimation has HyperNep and Shinometa. Because they only cater to normies. Good job.</br>  where's my karaoke  <br>This is all I want from my subs.<br>And nice typesetting. Not that barebones white block arial shit CR puts out.</br></br>  <br>Could be worse, could be yellow subs.</br>  <br>True. Those are much worse.</br>  <br>You still get them sometimes.</br>  <br>I still don't understand why it's "a rule" that Funimation and CR have to use either white, yellow or green subs. Everyone, even the late Geneon, had to follow this rule.</br>  <br>The first aqua lion episode hasn't been subbed either</br>  <br> 2015 <br> still relying on subs and not learning japanese </br></br>  Just do it yourselves you lazy fucks.  <br>Nah, SJWs stick out like a sore thumb because they are offended by everything, especially disagreement.</br>   commie is fine   <br>I watched my first raw yesterday (DB Super). Sure it's about as simple as it gets, but it feels good to have made some tangible progress.</br>  <br>What a hellish world we live in</br>  <br>Never forget Jinsei.</br>  My mother language is Brazilian Portuguese. The most famous site to watch anime around here sometimes get a weird translate (they just upload from some brazilian portuguese fansub) . I kind of know Japanese and I see how I could translate it better. But I'm sure the translate is not from japanese. Maybe they translate from a bad fansub. Yahari was kind of confuse because of this, I think i will just buy the LNs. At least we get subs for amost all season animes, so its fine.  Har har har, Chaos Dragon got subbed.<br><br>Eat shit, EOP-kun</br></br>  <br>Monosubs are the best.</br>  <br>They gotta spend extra time deciding what retarded way they'll translate honorifics.<br><br>I tried watching their stream for A Certain Scientific Railgun when I was bored and they decided "onee-san" was "sissy" and "ojou-sama" was "darling". How the fuck does that make sense?</br></br></br>  So many people are complaining about Nyaa and their shit. But why are you guys not moving to another   privat   Tracker?  le bump  <br>Who is complaining about Nyaa?<br><br>And people aren't moving to private trackers because private trackers are fucking shit.</br></br></br>  <br> privat Trackers are shit <br>Well... There're good ones.</br></br>  Half the shit I wanna watch this season is dead unless I go to Funimation.  Any fansub group planing on doing prison school? I can't handle FUNishit.  -1  <br>I don't think anyone's announced anything.</br>  <br>This and Overlord.</br>  <br> Quels sub fr sont bon ? </br>  <br> us </br>  <br> Why doesn't /a/ just make their own group? <br>I did.</br></br>  <br>You're from Reddit though.</br>  <br>I just need to get off my ass and start learning vocab.<br><br>I know once I start I'll be fine, but kanji as a whole is just downright daunting in the "I need to know several thousand of these" to be semi-fluent.<br>Also I always hear that anime uses some less typical vocabulary, but that could also just be referring to shows that obviously would use different vocabulary (fantasy, battle shonen, etc).</br></br></br></br>  <br> You can't visit 2 sites! </br>  <br>Fuck off.</br>  <br>I'm glad you understand.</br>  <br> Pour Gangsta? J'ai traduit moi-même le premier épisode (http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&amp;tid=<wbr>707341).<br>Je ne peux pas te conseiller sur les autres groupes car je ne regarde jamais de VOSTFR mais tout ce que je sais c'est que je suis le seul à avoir remuxé les sous-titres au lieu de les hardsubber.</br></wbr> </br>  <br> casual animefags bitching about animemes being subbed by shit groups <br> when mangafags have had to deal with this and worse shit for decades <br>fuck off you damn casual.</br></br></br>  <br> LOOK AT ME I READ MANGA I'M SO MUCH BETTER THAN EVERYONE ELSE </br>  <br>yes -1</br>  <br> not spending a few months learning japanese to the point of being able to at least read shounen/SoL stuff if not more than that <br>I can understand anime shit since that takes quite a while to watch raws without subs and overall isn't worth it if anime is all you're ever going to be interested in, but getting to the point of being able to read manga with the assistance of a dictionary is only a fraction of the time invested and you won't have to rely on shitty fanfic-tier guesslations anymore.</br></br>  so, Last-Subs or TAC for chaos dragon? they both seem pretty terrible  <br>I always appreciate the options. That's something CR or Funi would never give us  other than the choice between dub and sub .  I'm still at the shitty localization job CR did with Tesagure </br>  <br>We got spoiled by the cartel. Now that it's mostly dead it's hard to get used to the situation.<br><br>I just hope some of the beginning "white" groups on nyaa won't get shat on too much, for being beginners and making mistakes and don't get discouraged after a few weeks.</br></br></br>  <br>The 'cartel' seems to be pretty supportive of newbies that want to learn. H&amp;D's channel, for example, has been full of other fansubbers giving them tips for the last couple days now. I worry more that this place will shit on them than any cartel members.</br>  <br>real</br>   tfw you realize UTW won't sub UBW BD or Prisma Illya <br>What a terrible time to be alive.</br>  <br><br>OP here.<br>This:<br><br><br>I don't have that problem with manga because I can read it in Japanese. Doing so, especially with the assistance of OCR and dictionary programs, doesn't take much effort. You really just need to get a good grasp of grammar and syntax, and a basic vocabulary.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Based Mori.</br></br>  <br>It's literally just a hardsubbed version of Mori's release and yet has more than double the downloads.<br>Being white is suffering.</br></br>  <br>That has less to do with the white label but more to do with the fact that there are people with toasters from the 90s.</br>  <br> orange in general <br> deadfish <br>the yify of nyaa, idiots download it en mass</br></br></br>  <br> &gt;tfw you realize UTW won't sub UBW BD <br>That's wrong though, read the goodbye post again. They even released subs for 24 yesterday</br></br>  <br> toasters from the 90s <br>It's more of the shit connection they have.</br></br>  <br> larger filesize <br>??????????????</br></br>  <br>But Mori's filesize is (albeit marginally) still smaller.</br>  <br><br>I thought you meant both of them as opposed to better releases. Gomen.</br></br>  <br>Mori is the only release out  for now </br>  <br><br>Since you-know-who is taking its sweet time doing simulcast. I thought to start subbing the first episode myself with tremendous assistance from AMCGrady.<br><br>First time doing it, spent hours learning how to use the tools. Now I realise how difficult it is to do subtitling. Hats off to those people who pumps them out within a couple of hours.<br><br>I also have no idea what I'm doing. Most of the time is used to research on specific terminologies to make sure I capture the tone correctly.<br><br>Contract?<br><br>I-I'm scared.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Better than Last-Subs. Do you remember those Vampire Holmes "joke" subs? Guess who was releasing them?

Good catch.<br><br>In relevant news, new Hitomi/CW sometime this week, and new MM coming up in a few weeks. Should hopefully have it pretty quick, plus we've got the new scanlating team working on it, so it shouldn't take much time at all to get done.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Hahaha. Not nearly as retarded as I predicted, but still glad to know I was right in thinking she'd mention video games(anyone have Note 1?)</br>  <br>You're a horrible person anon. getting our hopes up like that. I still don't understand why people totally ignore it. It's EDMG with actual plot. Someone should save it from seven seas</br>  <br><br>No, TF had it right.<br><br>Papi wrote ごしゅじん(ご主人), goshujin, which is what you usually hear at maid cafes and what not when they greet the returning "master of the house".</br></br></br></br>  <br>Isn't she like 2.7m? you'd have to be huge to reach her legs and chest</br>  <br>She's 7 foot 5 inches</br>  <br>Really? Kobayashi is doing Ms Smith? I thought they basically hired unknowns for all of the roles. That makes me love Ms Smith so much more.</br>  <br>Imagine her using that rough/deeper/commanding voice for Smith. And the weedling/teasing voice when she is flirty with Darling.<br><br>God its going to be good.</br></br></br>  <br>Actually, I've been translating it in the manga as "hubby", which I've really been doubting lately.<br><br>I initially translated it as "hubby" as I'd heard a lot of my married Japanese friends refer to their husbands in that way, but without the humble "go". I thought about going with Master, but with how loving Papi seemed, it was a weird choice. I eventually went with "hubby" and I've had to stick with it.<br><br>I kind of like Seven Seas' "boss", actually. Wish I'd thought of it myself. If I could, I'd change the translation, but I'm too stubborn about keeping things consistent.<br><br>Lately, though, I've actually changed my mistranslation in Hitomi, referring to Hitomi as "Nurse Hitomi" instead of "Dr. Hitomi", since she's technically not a doctor. Well, technically, she's a nurse-teacher, in Japanese terms, but it's more common to us as Nurse. I'd love to change the name of the series as it appears in our releases (to Nurse Hitomi's Infirmary), but again, hard to change that kind of thing for consistency's sake.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Correctness &gt; consistency<br><br>You can always go back and do a find&gt;replace and rerelease v2s of all those chapters.</br></br></br>  <br>This would have to be printed onto some sort of transparent, comfy-feeling plastic daki and filled with a bag of water rather than a pillow, maybe even use some sort of blue jelly to fill it for a proper consistency.<br>Only problem with it being transparent would obviously be the two sides each showing through.<br><br> Too bad shit like that would be way too hard to properly make ;_; </br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh baby!</br>  <br>boss is dumb</br>  <br>Every time I see this, I get rock hard. Why does Cerea have such a LOUD body?</br>  is there going to be a live watch for tuesday morning?    <br><br>What did papi do to piss off darling? Must have been pretty major for her to actually apologize</br></br>  <br>Is that even possible in Photoshop? If it is, then it's tempting, but I'm not sure if I have all the originals.<br><br>I don't think it's that egregious a mistranslation to really warrant going through and fixing old chapters manually myself; I'd much rather spend my scanlating time working on something new, sorry to say.</br></br></br>  post cute stuff    <br>no u</br>    <br>Its the only chibi I have of Cerea.</br>  <br>There are these as well.</br>        <br>It's a monkey</br>  <br> 6 legs <br> one garter belt per leg <br> no mandibles <br> anti-grav boobs <br>2/10</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> no mandibles <br>Pedipalps, you want mandibles talk to Thomas</br></br>  <br>You mean pedipalps, those are probably under the skirt.</br>  <br>what chapter?</br>  <br>Reread the entire manga to find it.</br>  <br>I actually did that this morning.<br>pls?</br></br>  <br>Sorry, I don't know.</br>  <br>Postin'</br>      <br>I stopped reading that comic after it got weird.</br>  <br> Centaur stockings  <br>HHHNNNNNGGGGGGG</br></br>  <br> Need snake people <br> Attach unaltered human limbs to snakes like a child gluing on barbie arms <br><br>Not even once</br></br></br></br>    <br>So Chapter 1, then?<br><br>I'll admit, there are a lot of chapters I can't fucking stand, but the other half of them are pretty kawaii.</br></br></br>    <br>dropped it when the angel got her halo cut off... just seems way to slow paced to be interesting, even for a SoL</br>    <br>this the latest chapter?</br>  <br>I meant when the political shit started popping up<br>you know <br>angel hitler and such</br></br></br>  <br>Really?

She's easily one of my favorite voice actresses. She has pretty much played everything and has been amazing at it. I really see Ms Smith being close to her role as Maria. Teasing and very sadistic at times. <br><br>Are any other notable VAs in it? as I mentioned earlier I thought that after the main 3 girls were announced as pretty much rookies they wouldn't bother to hire any big names.</br></br></br>     http://www.pixiv.net/member_illust.<wbr>php?mode=medium&amp;illust_id=50512379</wbr> <br><br>Lewd Manako.

Now consider the length of her equine section. It is at or close in length to the washing machine in the background, and possibly as long as the wash-basin itself. Given that she probably has a "wingspan" of six-seven(183-213cm) feet from fingertip to fingertip, it is not unreasonable to assume the basin(and thus her equine body) is about five feet(153cm) in length.</br></br>  When you only want sleep and a monster want sex :3  <br>Remember, the house got upgraded several times in the manga the bath was first after mia.</br>  <br>What daily extras?</br>  <br>Lurk moar.</br>  <br> Those snake people <br><br>Jesus Christ, that's some next-level nightmare fuel.</br></br></br>  <br>I really love this.
