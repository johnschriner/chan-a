It would be too easy  I'm not trying shitpost or anything, this is a genuine question. I've seen so many people praise KyoAni as the pinnacle of anime. Though content wise these have been adapting series with mediocre writing. Animation wise they look appealing but it isn't considered good animation because it mostly backgrounds, shot with massive amounts of light everywhere. And it's known that KyoAni have below average production values. Now they do have a few gems such as Haruhi, Disappearance Movie, Full Metal Panic especially Fumoffu, and Hyouka which can be subjective because the story is really boring depending on the person. However they do adapt a lot of mediocre series that have terrible writing in it.<br><br>Now I'm not saying KyoAni is a bad Studio because they are far from it, but why do some people think they are the best Studio? If you look at their content it says otherwise.</br></br>  <br> Are you saying that because of Kekkai Sensen? Because honestly working on a single good show doesn't make a person a good director. <br> Other than that show she only did unremarkable episodes. <br><br>Her Heartcatch Precure movie was really rock solid and a fresh of breath air from most Precure movies</br></br></br></br>  <br> Nintendo <br>No. They are more like Valve since they can't release season 3 of anything.</br></br>   &gt;Are you saying that because of Kekkai Sensen?

Princess of gunnery. Blind.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Why should I care about balances in casual game?</br>  <br>Italia was on the Axis side for a short time while she had that name. The better indication of being characterized as an Allied ship is the fact that she and Roma both reference the Fritz X attack, and not battles with the Royal Navy.</br>  <br>I wonder how the Italian soldiers and sailors felt when one day they're on one side and the next they're on the other during both world wars.</br>  <br> Poi, kaga, Jintsuu, torpedo sluts <br>Yeah, they dont really care about it, the faster we assimilate it, the better for the players.</br></br>  Shinohayu scans are out.<br><br>Man this girl is such a dumbass, funny though. The girls on this match are all fun, hope we'll be seeing them again.</br></br>  <br>It's Kasumis, they're so big they need two threads to support them.</br>  <br>Saki is laying low, collecting info, and waiting to make her strike.</br>  mako a shit  <br>get out, Aislinn.</br>  Ten.

He didn't sacrifice Yuto either. In fact, he was willing to help him but Reiji was keeping a tight leash on him.<br><br>But he did sacrifice what he thinks were 'bad' people.</br></br></br>  <br>No matter how much you love Yuya, it is impossible to not see the kid has some major issues.</br>  Anyone else like how when Yuya came out of his edge mode the first thing he asked is if he beat the Obelisk Force rather than if anyone got the Knight of Duels cards away from them or if he hurt them? If Yuya could of I think he would of killed them with no remorse.  <br>Yes<br><br>There's no room for change or development in a character that's perfect from start to end.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Yuto's personality is coming out sometimes too. He starts freaking his shit a lot when Heartland is brought up, and during his duel with Reiji when Reiji knocks his ass down the stairs and starts taunting him.</br></blockquote>]
