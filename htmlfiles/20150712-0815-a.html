He thought he was preserving his humanity but humans maintain their human bodies and accept their limited lifespans, like integra and abraham.</br>  There are a lot of questions that this series didn't answer. Like: in the dracula novel mina was cured of the curse and lived happily ever after, but is the implication in the anime that some parts of the curse remained even after her death so the nazis dug up her body? or was the implication that she had to be killed and she didn't die naturally and the nazis dug up her body after? <br><br>Also integra said that alucard was the culmination of years of the hellsing family's occult knowledge, but what does that mean? Did she just mean the knowledge to enslave him and command him or did they somehow give him more powers? Even if he was under their control that seems incredibly stupid.<br><br>And what the fuck is going to happen when integra dies? I thought alucard only obeyed people with hellsing blood, so won't he just kill everyone once she's dead? Why would he listen to some government jobber?</br></br></br></br>  <br> even if he was a sick fuck <br><br>That's the point, he wasn't a "human" at all, that was just bullshit he made up. He was a war-hungry psychopath who didn't hesitate to kill millions in the most horrific way just so he could kill a being he considered his "archnemesis", but had no humanity himself at all. Someone like Anderson was much closer to a human than him, and thus worthy of taking Alucard's life.</br></br></br>  <br>by using his release level 0, alucard released all the souls he had in a torrent of blood and ghouls. this is why both anderson AND Walter thought alucard was at his most vulnerable. Alucard still had his vamp powers, but he wasn't as immortal as he was in the rest of the series. when schrodinger killed himself, he was doing so as alucard was gathering his souls back into his body, which is how he lost control.<br><br>when he fought walter, he wasn't immortal anymore.</br></br></br>  How exactly was Anderson supposed to kill Alucard? Would Alucard have gone a little easier on him if he stayed human?  [HorribleSubs] Aquarion Logos - 02 [720p].mkv  <br>Sougon takes care of that. Though, he fulfills big bad role, at least for now.<br>Oh, wait, Fudo united wth Mykage in the end of Evol, Sougon may be the result.</br></br>  <br><br>That makes her even more like Zessica actually, since she's this girl they picked up off the street with element power who became Nesta's golden girl, while Sougon's actual child is wimpy and relatively useless, which is pretty much the dynamic Zessica and Mikono had starting out.</br></br>  M.J.B.K.? What a retarded name  <br>Just in case that people take this as indication Sousei and EVOL didn't happen, remember that in EVOL Sousei was a movie</br>  <br>Zessica can never win</br>  Thoughts on Little Witch Academia and its sequel, The Enchanted Parade, /a/?  <br>I got HS 720p version, watched it today, why does the audio volume come and go? Is it only me?</br>  <br>Sucy is best witch.<br>No pantsu is a miracle of the universe.<br>Movie length OVA when?</br></br></br>  Thought it was pretty good. Great animation, side characters are the best, Diana is a tsundere bitch, and it's basically anime harry potter, witches doing witch shenanigans. Better than some of the shit sweeping the anime market now.  <br>I enjoyed it more than I enjoyed the original strangely.</br>  I want to rape Constanze. Am I a bad person, /a/?  So what did you animeonlyfags think about the reveal of the first episode of Gakkou Gurashi?  i want to fuck shovel-chan  <br>See, if I wanted that kind of story I would watch World War Z again. I'd rather keep on seeing how the girls cope with their personal struggles. I consider the backstory a distraction.</br>  <br>No, it was shit, the dog part was just annoying.</br>  <br>Don't you think that its a little harsh? Telling him to go away because of the way he t-t-t-t-talks?</br>  <br>The end of the episode was good, yes. What I take issue with is the tedious part before it, and all the changes they made compared to the manga.</br>  Is there any anime that rivals Evangelion in overall artistic quality? Fun anime don't count, unless they're more than just fun.   can't be enjoyable    Fun anime don't count <br><br>2/10</br></br>  <br>I'm a theater kid. I know that lighthearted doesn't mean bereft of quality. I don't want to rank stuff by fun here, though, because Evangelion actually isn't very fun to watch, amazing as it is.</br>  Evangelion was fun. For the middle third.  <br>Well if your looking for something serious that also raises some questions try Ghost in the Shell.</br>  Can we expect any character development or are we just gonna see them between MC's interactions with the three fantasy girls?  <br> Mage is a bro who is too young for him anyway. <br>Shooks, I wanted to root for her, but whatever. She's still cute as hell.</br></br>  <br><br>NOW I'VE LOST IT<br><br>I KNOW I CAN KILL<br><br>THE TRUTH IS JUST BEYOND THE GATE</br></br></br></br></br></br>  I just want to say that singing cartoon theme songs on the comm is a time honored tradition.<br>Unless you're in the armored corps, and then you just jury-rig your mp3 player to the intercom.</br>  <br>I realized that depending what parts of manga you accent. Feminist can latch to it as dream pro women story or jump on it as spawn of patriarchal devil. <br><br>/pol/ should stop shitposting about it and do some work to see if you can make feminist fanatically like and hate same story.</br></br></br>  <br>Yeah they would be boned.</br>  KYUPIK-  /ai/ - idle activities    Lala fuck.
