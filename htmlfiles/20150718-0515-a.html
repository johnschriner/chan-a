My first delivery from Boa. Thanks for drawing my pizza butt. I love it. Thanks so much!<br><br>Cheers!</br></br></br>  Because I know not everyone checks the general drawthread, I'm reposting this here.<br>I wanted to thank Orz and Sharkbro for drawing those wonderful images for me.<br>Also I won't be requesting this weekend, since I've gotten way too many wonderful deliveries the past weeks and this past weekend alone.<br>Have a nice weekend everyone.</br></br></br>  <br>Crap, I was too late  ;_; </br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>Shhh, don't let the Boa fanboys hear you say that.</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>oh, guess it wasn't the body</br>  <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209221 <br>What's your problem?</br>  Boa is very decent but after that episode of "as good as doom!" yesterday the urge to shitpost is -intense-.<br><br>This is why ranking your drawfus is bad.</br></br>  Requesting Stocking drinking cocktails with chubby anon, please.  <br>It's all relative, body being too small or head being too large.</br>  /r/ing Aika in a full body shot with her eye-to-eye length duct tape over her mouth, please. If the artist wants something specific they can have her legs on a desk while she's sitting or have her tied up in a glass cylinder like in Batman Forever.  Requesting Sailor Jupiter cosplaying as Mai Shiranui, preferably in her jiggle-crouch pose on the bottom right.  <br/>  <br>Jupiter's from an anime<br>Are you saying I can't request my waifu cosplaying as Chun Li or something?

Weren't they just some fixes to the pic?</br></br>  <br>Keyboard is broken so you get a pencil sketch sir</br>  <br>Are you looking forward to Odin Sphere HD?</br>  <br>Not him but who isn't?</br>  <br> keyboard is broken so I can't use a tablet or mouse <br>wot?</br></br>  Requesting more Oora in her oversized pink T-Shirt~  Unfortunately what is in the reference is all I can get   <br>hotkeys</br>  <br> but she's my waifu!  <br><br>Also I wasn't implying Mai was your waifu, seeing as you requested Jupiter. But wanting her drawn in a skimpy outfit with her tits bursting out and jiggling doesn't seem what a "normal" waifufag would request.</br></br></br>  <br> But wanting her drawn in a skimpy outfit with her tits bursting out and jiggling doesn't seem what a "normal" waifufag would request. <br>You must be new here.</br></br>  <br>You know I am, I wanna buy this game for the third time. I love the game that much.<br><br> If only I could play it on my vita... </br></br></br>  requesting this qt3.14  <br>Outsdide Mishafag and the other lewd requesters that request here and in the general who else does it?</br>  <br>Whoa that was fast! A pencil sketch is fine too, gives it a different kind of a feeling than a digital drawing. Thanks so much, it's really cute and a great way to start the weekend!</br>  <br>We do request less lewds in the WWD than in the regular drawthread, but nothing on the post itself hints to it being a haremfag, some sort of shitposter or anything but a person requesting his waifu. I mean, we do humor that fatchouli fag every weekend.</br>  <br> someone finally requested the best side-character ever created </br>  <br> Aside from the people who do it, who does it? </br>  Requesting Minatsu wearing a nontraditional miko outfit. Visible midriff and outfit matching ribbons is a plus.<br>Anything else is fine too, thanks!</br>  <br>I dunno. I haven't even the chance to save whatever <span class="deadlink">&gt;&gt;128209612  posted.</br>  How's the coloring on all those Sharkbro drawings?  <br>Slow and painful. I won't be done with mine for a few weeks.</br>  <br>4/14<br>though those 4 are still not complete</br></br>  <br> Mishafag <br> a person <br> not human excrement given life <br><br>Well that's a bit of a stretch.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>WIPS?</br></br>  <br>Still stuck in husbando coloring duty. Next week I'll see what  and  have and pick some that haven't been colored or aren't in progress yet.</br>  <br>I am done with 3 which I'll post this weekend. Working on a 4th one.</br>  <br>It wasn't a fix, it was just a rough edit.</br>  <br>Was something wrong with it? Or I guess the one who drew it deleted it.</br>  <br>I love your work, by the way, even if my husbando is  a waifu .</br>  <br>It fixed the proportions but all he did is select and re-size the head and arm. The lines don't match up and he probably can't recreate Boa's linework.</br>  <br>So I don't get why it was deleted...</br>  <br><br>Here are the 8 I'm working on. I haven't had much time to work on them since Monday but they are all still in progress.</br></br>  <br><br>It's not much different than a simple semi-lewd request; if an artist who wants to pick mine up and draw her with her boobs busting out, that'd be fine, too. If push comes to shove, I'll just ask for a commission.</br></br>  <br>You're doing God's work Tamabro</br>  <br>Man, I love the thread police tho</br>  <br>I dont think people would take issue with this if you werent spamming the request in the general during the week and just so happened to appear here now. It looks like you are requesting here simply because it is more active as opposed to that actually being you're waifu.</br>  <br> Here are the 8 I'm working on. <br> 8 <br>Holy shit, dude.</br></br></br>  <br>zzz</br>  <br> __? </br>  <br>kek, nice stuff boa</br>  <br>no wip because don't want to open photoshop</br>  <br>Really cute. I like it a lot. Not OR.</br>  <br>Well, that is party true, as I thought it'd make sense to post in two threads at the same time for that reason, I admit it. I only requested this in the regular drawthread once yesterday, and I'll probably post in there once more before I give it a break. I have no intention of spamming it in both threads; once again, I'll go ahead and commission it somewhere else if nobody's picking it up, I have absolutely no problem with that. I'm just like most of the requesters here and don't want to start any drama regarding what makes "lewd" art.</br>  <br>Not sure if cute or scary, but good job</br>  <br>That's kawaii shit</br>  <br>No, you thought it would make sense to request it here because people actually draw in these threads.</br>  <br> this ain't candy </br>  <br>Again, partly true, but with threads like these, it comes down to trial and error and dumb luck depending on the request. I don't want to start any more beef, alright? If it's not done here, I'll fuck off myself without devolving this into a flame war. Simple as that.</br>  <br> 8 <br> a lot </br></br>  <br>How many are you working on</br>  Requesting riko taking a bubble bath  <br>When did she dress like Powergirl?</br>  <br>Roughly 40 in a queue.<br>3 are complete.</br></br>  <br>Just needs a black bar.</br>  <br>Why would anyone assume I'm anywhere near doom?</br>  <br>I see you've been the the /i/ thread too.</br>  <br>It's a new project. Not an HD remake.</br>  <br><br>Really? I usually work on one until I finish it.</br></br>  <br>Because they like you. Don't take it too personally.</br>  Requesting sleepy Tamaki wearing an oversized dress shirt as pajamas and yawning cutely please! As always anything else cute is appreciated as long as it's not too lewd  even cute lewd  . <br><br>Thanks for reading and have a comfy weekend!</br></br>  <br>Hey that was amusing, nice work Boa!</br>  <br>You made me do this</br>  <br>it seemed that you've got quite the fanclub, congrats</br>  <br>You made a real worm turn into a colorful dildo?</br>  Homura eating a big cookie  Requesting my dear sweet Lancer in Doutanuki Masakuni's battle clothing. Any level of the clothing is fine. I'm not picky however and will accept him having summer fun in any possible way, from fishing to beach time and anything in between. Tight swimsuits preferred, but draw what you are comfortable with.<br>Lancer Refs: http://imgur.com/a/Axfod/all<br>Doutanuki Refs: http://imgur.com/a/HsPXS/all</br></br>  Boa, may I ask when we'll see the completed collage?

Otherwise something like a halter top and short-shorts!  <br>Inanimate objects in mouths are better than than that, anon</br>  All I would like is a happy Ryoubi wielding powertools  she can be flat as well but has to be wearing naked overalls or something suitable.   Millia Rage please, anything would be fine.  Requesting my king Revo.<br>Him with a Léon plush would be amazing, anything cute or cool is appreciated though.<br><br>If anyone want to arttrade I'll be up for it.</br></br></br>  <br>And with cookie you mean...</br>  <br>I tried. Sorry.</br>  <br>Every time I open it I think "ehhh" and then go do something else.</br>  <br/>  <br>Chocolate chip</br>  Can somebody draw Gakupo? Or maybe Gackt  <br>Huge throbbing dick?</br>  <br>Okay, meant to quote </br>  <br> wanting to violate waifus </br>  Requesting Tsukihi dressed like a chef  <br>Hot damn, that is awesome!</br>  <br>No</br>  <br> Haremfags <br>They would enjoy it anyway</br></br>  <br>Then you must be one because even they probably won't.</br>    Requesting long haired Hitagi drinking a Ramune or any summer related drink.  <br> yes <br>Alright, I'm on it. With cum or without?</br></br>  <br>Cute!</br>  <br>Have you ever went and seen their requests on /d/?</br>  <br>Aikafag here, Boa thanks again for doing this! Looking forward to the end!</br>  Requesting Aichi lazily playing a 3DS on a couch in casual clothing. If you have any ideas of your own that is fine too.

May God bless you.</br>  Good evening~<br>I missed the end of last weekend, but thank you so much Sharkbro for drawing my dear Hanako, I really love the line art, her pose, her smile, and shark outfit. It all looks wonderful.  You didn't draw her scars though.  I ended up coloring it myself.  And added little sharks on the sheets and if you ever want to color it yourself I'd like to see how it ends up. <br>Also thank you orz for adding my Hanako to that collage, all the waifus looks so cute in it and  especially Hanako  and the heart shape is a great touch.<br><br>As for this weekend, I would like to request my dear Hanako as Cure Scarlet doing mahou shoujo things, but anything else would be lovely as well.

I feel a bit for the Millennium Earl. He just wanted his qt 3.14 Noah back</br>  What's wrong with a normal telephone, or even those golem thingys they use for communication.  <br>It's amazing how Hoshino draw expressions. We can immediately tell that's not Allen from that alone.</br>  <br>That looks convenient as fuck for me.</br>  Why is Kubo sabotating every other manga?  YES!<br><br>I thought it was dead, I was so upset. Is it officially off of it's Hiatus?</br></br>  <br>That's because that's actually what she tried to focus on. If i remember there was an an interview where she said the hardest part of drawing Allen was with his facial expressions. To differentiate between his emotions. In that aspect she really earned my respect as a mangaka</br>  <br>Yes, but you only get a chapter every 3 months because I imagine it's hard to fully recover from arthritis</br>  <br> Kubo <br> sabotaging DGM <br>It's impossible</br></br></br>  <br>You're right, that's not enough ink for Kubo</br>  I don't remember a shit about this manga.<br><br> &gt;Alzheimer </br></br>  <br>Hoshino actually pours a lot of black though</br>  <br>It's almost impossible. No matter what he does, Crown Clown will just patch him up.<br><br>It's not like Allen never plans on suicide before. He used to try to slit his throat.</br></br></br>  <br> oh god now I have to take care of these two babies <br> my life is ruined </br></br>  <br>She's not Kubo's level yet.</br>  <br> My husbando turns into babies <br> I never has chance to fuck him </br></br>  OH FUCK WHAT.<br><br>Someone help me here? Last I remember, Apocryphos or whatever the fuck was trying to kill Allen because he has/is the Heart, and Kanda was trying to save Allen for him allowing Kanda and Alma their final moments together.<br><br>Allen is slowly being taken over by Nea, so the Order has officially said 'WELP, guess you aint an Exorcist no more, bye.' And that leads to where we are now where Allen is running from Apoccy and the Earl, right?<br><br>So, yeah, Nea and Mana. What the shit?<br><br>Mana is the Earl? That's where I'm lost, because Mana raised Allen.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I remember absolutely loving the first few arcs then it gradually getting worse until it was completely uninteresting and I stopped reading. How bad is it now?</br>  <br>You missed an entire arc</br>  <br>I don't blame you, it's been almost 2 years and a half years. We might need to write up a main point synopsisfor those who doesn't want to reread. <br><br>Although a reread is a guranteed enjoyable experience..</br></br></br>  <br>Well the current chapter was absolutely amazing and it didn't even have a fight, so that's pretty impressive.</br>  <br> not posting grimmjow's cero </br>  <br>Did I? There's probably something I'm skimming over but not missing, I'd think.</br>  <br>The spreads were fucking amazing, honestly so much of it looked so good.</br>  I cannot put into words how I feel about this chapter.  <br><br>Is that really ink or inverse coloring; white on black paper?</br></br>  <br>That new chapter was interesting and very well drawn. A huge revelation after 2 years of hiatus is always welcome. And now we have to wait 3 months.</br>  <br>Not having a fight is what makes it good, since Hoshino's action scene is terrible</br>  I thought they were gonna snog.  Why was it on hiatus again?  <br>Shonuen Jump are arsenuggets.</br>  <br>arthrisis or something similar. She kept drawing but couldn't keep publishing DGM.</br>  <br>Health issues. She has some kind of chronic. She is doing better now</br>  <br>You misses Searching for A.W arc.<br><br>About Mana is the Earl, it was forshadowed the whole time, like, everytime, since the very begining</br></br></br>  <br>  And now we have to wait 3 months. <br>Fuck, can I do this again? Why did I choose to read this now?</br></br>  <br>Noticed that the big "Earl" part of Mana sunk into his shadow. I guess that explains one mystery, of where the big fat jolly Earl goes off to.<br><br>What a messed up family tree they have. The Earl's lover (presumably) became his mother and his brother became his surrogate son. On top of all that, Mana seems pretty senile. Feel sorry for the guy.</br></br></br>  <br>Ask MS to release 20 pages per month.</br>  <br>Like Volume 1 cover beginning right?</br>  <br>At least it's ongoing now, not in hiatus. If she keeps delivering 60 pages of this quality every Trimester that's good enough for me.</br>  <br>Hoshino's instagram will always be there for you. Just don't shitposting</br>  <br>Ah, no, I skimmed. Searching for AW was what I meant by Kanda going to save him.<br><br>To be honest, and it might of just been the slow updates, but that arc was slow and tedious as fuck. But I did love me some Yuu.<br><br>But also I hope this Mana is the Earl thing gets cleared up soon, I want to know just how the fuck Mana would raise Allen only to want to murder him later.<br><br>Or maybe that's just it. Maybe the Earl raised Allen as Mana, as he forgot about Nea but felt automatically drawn to Nea with Allen. But then again, the Earl was around as Allen went to be an Exorcist, so... I don't know.<br><br>I'm confused as shit.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> one chapter every 3 months <br> but its a 60 page chapter <br>i'm entirely alright with this.</br></br></br>  <br>Not only that</br>  We seriously need that light novel OVA adaption for this  <br>Mana is batshit insane all the time. Allen knows but never says anything</br>  <br>nah the next chapters will be shorter iirc</br>  <br>I like how Allen has grown.<br><br>I forget why his hand is all nasty, even though he lost it and then it came back as a sword-hand deal.</br></br></br>  <br>HOSHINOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.</br>  <br>The chapter Lavi returns has fairly the same amount of pages to chapter 219</br>  <br>So is the Earl just staying and raising Allen as Mana, and then fucking off to go be a Noah as Earl constantly, do you think?</br>  <br>that's probably true, but someone explained that the regular chapter size equals that of a mothly serialised chapter, so in the long term the chapters will be shorter than wwhat we got now</br>  <br>Mana didn't even think he was raising Allen. He mistood Allen with his dog.</br>  <br>Oh shit. So aye, pretty much senile.<br><br>How the fuck did he manage to handle being the Earl?</br></br></br>  <br>basically the earl is insane and clearly has some weird issues between being human/noah, so i think he sort of flip flops and is thus insane.<br>this is how allen grew up.<br>also the earl isn't even the full version of him,self, hes like half a millenium earl.<br>its kind of goofy shit.</br></br></br></br>  Are there any Viz/CR rips or something of this?  Still Gay as fuck.  So the earl is nea?  <br> But also I hope this Mana is the Earl thing gets cleared up soon, I want to know just how the fuck Mana would raise Allen only to want to murder him later. <br>The Earl seems unaware that he IS Mana. So maybe the time when the "Earl" we knew showed up to killed Nea, Mana hadn't yet properly awakened. When Mana finally "died" and Allen was grieving for him, that was when Mana truly awakened as the Earl and lost the memories of who he was.</br></br>  <br>earl got split between nea and mana<br>mana was already awoken by the time allen was growing up<br>mana as the earl is an unstable batshit insane fuck<br>so both of them have the same damn powers, in addition nea now has ahold of allens hand.<br>so theres that.</br></br></br></br></br>  Remember when akuma were relevant? Well...  <br>This reminds me, allen made mana an akuma. That makes no sense if the earl was mana.</br>  <br>Maybe... still confused to shit.<br><br>Here's hoping Kanda comes in soon to stab the Earl and kiss his Allen-waifu.<br><br><br>Also this is what I recall, as well...</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I hate what this did with akuma. The level 4 leveled the main base, and then after that it seems like level 4's were just normal shits to be delt with. Wasnt that level 4 the first thy ever saw too?</br>  Honestly, the Earl being Mana makes a lot of things click together nicely. Which freaks me out.<br><br><br> Here's hoping Kanda comes in soon to stab the Earl and kiss his Allen-waifu. <br><br>Stop posting.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Level 4's were shit anyway.<br><br>Level 1's are retarded balloon-guns.<br><br>Level 2's are based as they take on different looks that actually look good or interesting.<br><br>Level 3's were alright with their Knight appearance but still bland and samey.<br><br>Level 4's are creepy fucking baby-looking cherub fucks.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Honestly, the Earl being Mana makes a lot of things click together nicely. Which freaks me out. <br><br>What clicks? There are some things I can think of, but nothing that startles.</br></br></br>  <br>Yah I'll agree how level 4's lost their originality. I never noticed level 3's had a knight theme though.</br>  <br>I would explain if it wasn't 4:04 in the morning and my brain hadn't entirely checked out by now. But it made a lot of fucking sense when I first read it.<br><br>Though I'm still wondering about the first akuma that Allen killed that was supposed to be Mana.</br></br></br>  <br>What I can think of is why the earl didnt kill allen when he made "mana" an akuma, something the earl noted himself. Also why they have the same sword.</br>  Looking pretty good. Let's hope the quality doesn't drop. I'm already looking forward to the next one.<br>3 months between chapters is pretty long, though.</br>  <br>Oh! The sword, right.<br><br>I don't think the Buster suits the Earl. Never did.<br><br>I just see it more at home on Allen, but that's likely because I'm used to my skinny anime pretty boys that wield the massive sword.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Think of it as something to look forward to during midterms.</br>  <br> Let's hope the quality doesn't drop <br>You mean it hasn't already</br></br>  I don't even remember what the fuck is happening anymore.  Damn, D.Gray-man?<br><br>I remember discovering this when my Weeabo of a mate was watching the episode where Krony becomes a bloody mess in the Iron Maiden, and that got me interested as to what was happening.<br><br>And then I saw Allen dancing about with his one arm and a sword, and I was interested in thinking that there was a soldier that fought with a handicap.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Considering that the Earl and Mana were able to act as separate entities, maybe the Earl represents the Noah part of him and, even after Mana died and had his soul stuck in an Akuma doll, was able to continue acting on his own? Then, after Allen destroyed the doll, Mana's soul was reunited with the Earl?<br><br>I mean, the Noah with the 3rd eye seems to consider "Wisely" as a separate person. He mentions something about not letting Wisely take him over, which seems similar to the time when Tyki went into a berserk state when Joido took over his body.<br><br>The Noah memory reawakens in a new person whenever the last person who carried and awakened to the memory died. Their souls transmigrate between bodies, but they don't kick out the original soul that inhabited the body. At least, that's what I think.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Well, it's pretty good now.<br><br>On a side note, does anyone think we'll see a new adaptation in the future?</br></br></br>  <br> I never noticed level 3's had a knight theme though. <br>Huh, really? That seemed pretty self-evident, though.<br><br>Anyway, yeah. Level 4's have nothing unique about them at all. At least with the level 3's, they had their unique techniques, but the level 4's just seem like typical brutes/next-level mooks.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I doubt they're going to have another TV adaption if that's what you mean.<br><br><br>If there's ever to be a Level 5, I hope they go like the 2's when they go fairly humanoid, but become almost Noah like in their abilities.</br></br></br></br>  Nothing explained yet as to why Cross and Hitler support Nea though. Also any hints on why the akuma are being made yet?  <br> If there's ever to be a Level 5, I hope they go like the 2's when they go fairly humanoid, but become almost Noah like in their abilities. <br>Eh, I think as long as the story is focusing on Allen, the Akuma won't be that relevant anymore except as mooks for background battles.<br><br>We may see more of the Church's people, like Apocryphos, for variety in the enemies, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Too be fair it still took 2 general level exorcist to kill one.</br>  <br>I don't see what streat fighter has to do with d.gray man tbh.</br>  <br>yes it took two to kill the first one, after that you can see them in the background being fought.</br>  <br>Litterally suffering. She came to have a date with her husbando at the meeting spot, not to discover two shitty brats.</br>  DGM threadly reminder that Past!Allen is responsible for:<br><br>[x]Musician code along with the song<br>[x]Almost destroying Noah Clan via using 14th<br>[x]Turning Cross's life into shit<br>[x]Turning Allen's life into extreme deep shit<br>[x]Cross's death<br>[x]Lavi turns into wormslut<br>[x]Road made a contract with QB and become magical girl, only for getting Madoka's bless and gone for good<br>[x]Timcanpy's death<br>[x]Not!Shou Tucker raping everyone<br>[x]Turning everyone into gay<br>[x]Link's unrequited gay love <br>[x]Turning Kanda and Alma from straight to gay<br>[x]The manga switches to quarterly<br>[x]Nea and Mana being the Earl<br><br><br>[for later update]</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Mana never thinks he is the Earl after he went insane.

We might see it being revived in one way or another, but for now it's dead.</br>  <br>3.<br><br><br><br>Oh shit... I re-read and yeah... ;~;7</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>2 years 6 months and 19 days actually, not that I was counting.</br>  What if the whole "mana got turn into akuma" was just an illusion?  <br>I'm with what the other guy said. Maybe the Earl sort of split himself and when Mana died and was killed as an Akuma, the spirit returned to Earl.</br>  <br>Things are leaning towards "fake memories" atm.</br>  <br>Allen has pretty good memories, so no</br>  This whole thing has a 'just as planned' vibe to it but I'm not sure who is benefitting from all this.<br><br>Wait, I know! Past!Allen.</br></br>  <br> The MC was the mastermind behind the plot's events all along <br>Oh my.</br></br>  I used to love Allen, but it was during the fight with the Noah's where Lavi almost got killed and entrapped within a box o' doom that I just thought 'Oh for fucks sake, you useless shit.'<br><br>Always whining and moaning and bitching, oh so bad guys are being bad guys, jesus, just man up and fucking kill them already. Your friends are dying while you're slitting your wrists.<br><br>But Allen is starting to come back to me, but I think that's Nea's influence.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Upgraded version</br>  What the fuck is going on? D.Gray-Man is as confusing as ever. The Earl is Mana? I'm confused as fuck.  <br>Link is gay for Lvellie (Hitler guy), not Allen</br>  I liked d gray man until it became yaoi fanservice. I bet all the posters in here are women.  <br>We already have a threadly remainder? Wow</br>  <br>Read the manga again. It's been 2 years, so I don't blame you for being confused (most of us were), but things would be clearer once you reread from the top.</br>  Limited edition of Jump Crown comes with this.<br><br>I don't know why no matter how Hoshino's art changes, her Road still makes my dick diamond</br></br>  <br>That anon has been doing that since last year</br>  <br>Noahs seem like such a fun bunch to destroy humanity with</br>  <br>Noahs are bros, they are terrifying, but are great bros</br>  <br>Well except for Neah who killed like all of them. <br><br>I was wondering how the fuck a single Noah killed all but Road and the Earl 35 years ago but this explains everything.</br></br></br>  nea = alexiel<br>mana = rosiel</br>  <br>Nea is another Earl of Millenium, giving him the same power level to Mana.<br><br>He wasn't unable to kill Road and the Earl back then because Road is extremely tricky to kill and the Earl is Mana</br></br></br>  Nea is probably the half of millennium earl who loves humans while Mana hates them. He seemed in a relationship with a human woman before the split, so he couldn't 100% hate them.  <br>literally who</br>  <br> tfw only 35 posters <br>I had more faith in /a/ than this. Well, time to re read the manga again.</br></br>  the new serialization is weekly or monthly?  <br>The last one had like 80 though.</br>  <br>We had 100+ when the chapter raws leaked a couple days back. Probably the time.</br>  <br>Ha ha. Quarterly.</br>  <br>I doubt that Neah 'loves' human. He's more tolerable to them for sure compared to the other Noahs but I wouldn't go so far as to say he loves them.</br>  <br>F U J O S H I T<br>U<br>J<br>O<br>S<br>H<br>I<br>T</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So /a/, who do you think is the Heart?  Wait, so the akuma Allen summoned at the start of whole thing was the Earl? <br><br>But how can it be the Earl? The akuma also gave Allen his all seeing eye.</br></br>  <br>Past!Allen</br>  <br>If you had fujo goggles on yeah it's fujoshit.<br>It's just a shonen manga with a 10:1 male to female ratio.</br></br>  <br>I prefer it this way. Less shitposters.</br>  <br>Maybe it wasn't an akuma per se? Maybe Allen just thought that it was.</br>  <br>He probably had a thing for Road too.</br>  <br> shonen <br>Haha good one. Next you'll tell its an action shonen too. Take off your nostalgia goggles, the series is dead. I was its biggest fan following from day one, but now its dead.</br></br>  <br>But hasn't he seen akuma before they enter a human? Wouldn't that tip him off that his akuma wasn't an akuma? <br><br>Or did he summon Nea by accident?</br></br></br>  <br>Care to explain your wrong opinion?</br>  <br>Oh shit, what are you doing</br>  <br>see </br>  <br>taking the b8<br><br>petitio principii</br></br></br>  I wanna protect this smile.  <br>I don't understand why that smile makes me feel depressed as fuck</br>  <br>It's the smile you'd give to someone you know is beyond saving</br>  <br>Earl had a human lover. So he might be just tsundere now.</br>  <br>d-don't say that</br>  <br>Angel Sanctuary twins split from a greater being.<br><br>One twin (male one) obsessed with another half (female one) and has messed up memories about their past and is going insane, pinning after oneesan.</br></br></br>  <br><br>it has no vassal. It's the collective will of humans to survive.<br><br>That's why they really can't win without killing every single human. They just don't know it yet. Or don't accept it.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Except Nea is extremely sane and Mana only went insane after their mother's death</br>  So if i am right about this, Allen already both mana and nea in his body? I read from the first chapter and looks like mana's memory is also being transfered along with the curse in his right eye? This might explain why the earl of millenium doesn't remember about nea and his self anymore.  Katerina is a damn good name.  <br> Allen already both mana and nea in his body? <br>No, he only has Mana's curse</br></br>  why did the earl slip in two? <br><br>what is he anyway</br></br>  Quick /a/ where can I reread the series? Kissmanga has subhuman scans.  <br>He lived in a world that full of faggots for 7000 years.</br>  It was just under our nose  <br>Rosiel was sane but he got a tragic curse that was eating his sanity away. He forgot why Alexiel tried to kill him (he asked her to kill him before he lost his mind) and spends the remain of the manga insane and looking after his twin (whose reincarnated and 'sealed' in a human boy), thinking she hated him, wishing to kill the boy so his sister would awake again.<br><br>Rosiel also mindcontrols humans and turns them into monsters. And both twins can destroy the world.<br><br>There are a lot of AS-inspired things in D-Gray Man. Hoshino probably read it.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Bear with it or buy it</br>  <br>nyaa</br>  <br>Then this is supposed to be nea? But it came from his cursed eye?</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=XJY<wbr>B7j4TBs8</wbr>  [ ]<br><br> One cradle has become a twin now <br><br>BRAVO<br>R<br>A<br>V<br>O</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That's what the curse looks like. It's not really Mana</br>  After the taking of the Bastille in the French Revolution in 1789, the Comtesse d'Adhémar said she had a lengthy conversation with Count de Saint-Germain. He allegedly told her of France's immediate future, as if he knew what was to come. In 1821, she wrote: "I have seen Saint-Germain again, each time to my amazement. I saw him when the queen [Antoinette] was murdered, on the 18th of Brumaire, on the day following the death of the Duke d'Enghien, in January, 1815, and on the eve of the murder of the Duke de Berry." The last time she saw him was in 1820 - and each time he looked to be a man no older than his mid-40s.<br>After 1821, Saint-Germain may have taken on another identity. In his memoirs, Albert Vandam wrote of meeting a man who bore a striking resemblance to Count de Saint-Germain, but who went by the name of Major Fraser. Vandam wrote:<br><br>"He called himself Major Fraser, lived alone and never alluded to his family. Moreover he was lavish with money, though the source of his fortune remained a mystery to everyone. He possessed a marvelous knowledge of all the countries in Europe at all periods. His memory was absolutely incredible and, curiously enough, he often gave his hearers to understand that he had acquired his learning elsewhere than from books. Many is the time he has told me, with a strange smile, that he was certain he had known Nero, had spoken with Dante, and so on."<br>Major Fraser disappeared without a trace.<br><br>Between 1880 and 1900, Saint-Germain's name once again became prominent when members of the Theosophical Society, including famed mystic Helena Blavatsky, claimed that he was still alive and working toward the "spiritual development of the West." There is even an allegedly genuine photo taken of Blavatsky and Saint-Germain together. And in 1897, the famous French singer Emma Calve dedicated an autographed portrait of herself to Saint-Germain.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  the earl's first appereance was pretty cute  <br>Alexiel was sane. She was kind of manipulative and secretive (hot) bitch who seemly hated her brother but was the opposite. That was just Rosiel's wrong impression/messed up memories. <br><br>She's also a doomsday being sealed in the mc's soul/body who powers him up.</br></br></br>  <br>The musician song has closer foreshadowing <br> At first there was only one, but then two </br></br>  this manga is very ffesque or is just me?  <br>I don't remember this.</br>  <br>Krory arc</br>  the final enemy will look like this I assure you  reading the chapter while listening to que sera sera is a unique experience that I'd recommend  <br>The part where his eye turns into the gear version.</br>  <br> The final enemy <br>That's not Past!Allen</br></br>  <br> implying the story isn't about the traitor winning </br>  holy shit I swear Hoshino is a fucking female Miura, jesus  <br>He is not evil. He kills humans, which is good.</br>  <br>This is why her hand developed problems.</br>  FUAAAARK YIIIIIIS<br>Today is a good day.</br>  <br>I thought she had aids in her hand because genetics?</br>  <br>She is actually part of a hardcore raiding guild with Togashi and Miura</br>  <br> female Miura <br>Is this why male characters keep getting raped?</br></br>  Am I understanding this correctly or am I confused: in the past there was another Millenium Earl who was split into two people Mana and Nea. Nea became the current Millenium Earl and Mana was the 14th Noah who betrayed the current Millenium Earl before he went away and raised Allen.However Mana has returned as a new version of the Millenium Earl and Nea is someone/something else?  So what devil fruit will Nea D. Campbell get?  So that way I think it works is: Mana went crazy, killed Nae, blames himself, puts Nae's soul inside of Allen's body, goes super crazy, died trying to become the EoM with only half his real body. Forgets everything. Now we are are here.  <br>Pretty much.</br>  <br>Holy shit, really interesting. <br><br>Is this somewhat related to Count of Monte Cristo?</br></br></br>  <br>Nea betrayed the Noahs.<br>Nea died.<br>Nea enters Allen.<br><br>Mana is the Earl.<br>The Earl killed Nea.<br><br>Based on this thread, the Earl was the Mana who raised Allen and is insane, so he doesn't remember his Earl time. Or something.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> d gray man explained in one fucking line </br>  I love the Earl. I also absolutely love the whole new <br>'battleform' of his costume. That demonic smiling man disguise he wears, with that grown huge like that it looks awesome with him looking out of the teeth like it was some giant armor.<br><br>I really wonder about the Earl and his origins. Considering his name is Adam... I have always had a theory.<br><br>The theory that he is Adam from the Garden. Angry at God for casting them out. Angry at God for letting one son kill the other. Having somehow found immortality and denying both God and the Devil, and founding his own third side to end them all.<br><br>Humans are his descendents and he uses them as the weapons against his enemy, God. Turning souls into horrifying weapons that are transforming closer and closer to a corrupted Angel form through the Akuma process.<br><br>Perhaps when he gets the ultimate Akuma, he will finally be able to enter Heaven with his Noah and end God himself.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You are correct until this part <br><br>  Nea became the current Millenium Earl and Mana was the 14th Noah who betrayed the current Millenium Earl before he went away and raised Allen.However Mana has returned as a new version of the Millenium Earl and Nea is someone/something else? <br><br>Mana is the current Millenium Earl, while Nea is the 14th Noah who betrayed the Noah clan.<br><br>After Nea killed almost entire Noah clan but failed to kill the Earl, he ran away and lived hiding with Mana. However, since Mana is the Earl, there was no escape for them. Nea got killed by the Earl and Allen became the host for his returning.<br><br>Mana, after Nea's death, became completely insane and forgot everything, changed his name and began his hobo life while trying to run away from the Earl. <br><br>30 years later, Mana met Allen. Allen unknowingly used his Innocence arm on his head, broke Mana even more. Allen decided to be with Mana to atone for this.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The Earl is confirmed to be inspired by Saint-Germain long ago. Hoshino adds the insanity element</br>  Poppies, poppies everywhere  <br> The Earl is confirmed to be inspired by Saint-Germain long ago <br>I know.</br></br>  <br>wh-w-what happens to Allen now ;_;<br><br>I don't like the sound of this <br><br>Actually, I hate</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's done for. There is no way to save him now.<br>The only thing we could do is this </br></br>  <br>Give himself to the Heart.</br>  <br>What if he is the Heart</br>  <br>Why would he ded? Then Nea would just appear in another body.</br>  <br>Then who the fuck knows anymore.</br>  <br>Yeah, that's the saddest thing of all, been in the middle of this shitty feud between Nea and Mana, poor boy, I just wanted him to be with that girl with the sexy legs which I don't remeber her name :(</br>  <br>He won't be dead, but would wish to</br>  what  <br> In b4 Lenalee is the reincarnation of Katerina </br>  I felt a bit uncomfortable with the amount of yaoi bait in this chapter    <br>Lenalee Lee</br>  <br>The guy willingly offered himself to Neah, remember? Allen has only himself to blame for getting himself involved in this shit.</br>  <br>That won't happen</br>  <br>Please not treat Allen and Past!Allen the same.</br>  <br>Indeed, Lena and Allen are just meant for each other  ;_;  which makes me think this guy could be right <br><br>Also, what is Allen opinion in all of this? He may regain control of his body again, ri-right? What does he want to do?</br></br></br>  <br>Just accept it, Lenalee is irrelevant now.</br>  <br> Lena and Allen are just meant for each other <br>Legfags are delusional</br></br>  Road is Bestgirl  <br>In just yesterday's thread there was someone trying to tell us we were blind for liking her art.</br>  <br><br><br>I'd like to say that this is all me lads</br></br></br>  <br>Yes, just some epik troll trying too hard, like any other thread. That's why people should report and reply.</br>  There are no break on Ms. Hoshino's Wild Ride  <br> Caring about one anonymous voice in a crowd <br><br>Anonymous' opinions don't matter.</br></br></br>  Cannot unsee  <br>Fuck off. I posted the middle one.<br><br>Stop being so defensive Lenaleefag.</br></br></br>  <br>Is not. That last one is clearly me... wait... are you me? Am I myself? WHO AM I?! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!</br>  So Lavi and his mentor are captive because they know where the Heart or parts of the Heart are?  <br>No. They were held captive because Sheryl needed information of Nea</br>  Well damn  <br>I thought the Noah knew all along Allen was Neah and they were just waiting for him to wake up</br>  <br>unsee what?</br>  <br>It's not yaoi.<br><br>It's masturbation.</br></br></br>  this guy is literally sasuke  <br>I don't know, anon...</br>    <br>  muh poor boy Allen <br><br>Tell me more about how he did nothing wrong. The guy forced himself into this personal feud.</br></br></br>  <br>No, he's just tsundere and he's retrieving Allen not the other way around.</br>  <br>It was the same when Mana insisted he was 17...</br>  <br>Are you enjoying rereading it? <br><br>Also &gt;too many to list <br>My sides.</br></br></br></br>  <br>But he actually loved his waifu  ;_; </br>  What the fuck is happening help  <br>His love is one of the most loyal love I've ever seen</br>  <br> Are you enjoying rereading it? <br>yeah, everyone should do it, the beginning is pretty based</br></br>  <br>It's just as he said: Mana is the Earl</br>  <br>No, Sheryl is Tykki's brother and the one who is obsessed with Road. All the Noahs that were killed by Neah dont remember anything besides that he was the traitor who fucked them all up. Sheryl wants answers and who else but the Bookman would know?</br>  <br>Sheryl is an obsessive Roadfag.</br>  Can't it just be October already?  <br>Wait really? I remember that at most the akuma that appeared was level 3 after lvl 4 arc, not 4.</br>  <br>Yes, thanks for clarifying things up, my kind anon. <br><br><br>A legit Roadfag I'd say.</br></br></br></br>  <br>The Earl leaded an army of Lv4 to retrive Nea in Alma arc.<br>All of them were destroyed by Alma.</br></br>  <br>I don't even, for this reveal. It's something we all should've known since Earl's first human appearance but to say it so blatantly after a few years of hiatus feels like I'm suppose to be surprised but not really. Was expecting a big battle or something else entirely?</br>  With her disease, do you think she is going to try and rush to the ending? So she can finish telling the story and skipping over alot of unresolved plotholes?  <br>Most people are not surprised about Mana being the Earl. <br><br>If there are rages about this, they are for Allen</br></br></br>  <br>Disease, anon? She has been working all this time.</br>  <br>And even the Earl's memory is fucked up so the only one who knows is Road and the Bookman who at that time was allied with the Noahs. Sheryl is not just jealous about Road, he's also jealous that the Earl still wants to be by Neah's side despite the fact he betrayed them.<br><br>Tykki is also interested but Sheryl is piss mad right now after hearing about Road shielding Allen from Apocryphos. Thats why Lavi is such a wormslut.<br><br>Poor guy is going to lose his shit when he hears the truth.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nanomachines, BROTHER!</br>  <br>The disease is chronic. It can't be cured. She has been enduring it</br>  So, Apocryphos was captured? He seems a bit too strong and too relevant to be dealt with so soon.  <br>Arthritis is chronic, can flare up, and is crippling. She has no idea how long she is going to have use of her hands. I'm kindof worried she'll rush the ending.</br>  <br> Thats why Lavi is such a wormslut. <br><br>Get out, Fatefag</br></br></br>  <br>Jasdevi are fucking beasts though. And he might be allowing it.</br>  I don't even  <br>And not just by a strong Noah, captured by the fucking jobber twins Jasdevi.</br>  <br>She is trying to extended her time as much as possible, practicing yoga and such</br>  <br>Jasdevi has the most broken power in the Noah clan, aside from the Earl.<br><br>And they have the help of two other Noahs<br> Creating things from imagination </br></br></br></br>  Is this manga good?  <br>VERY<br><br>It just got fucked over by the mangakas arthritis</br></br></br>  <br>That reminds me that interview where Hoshino said at that point, she was planning to let "that person" is none other than Kanda's lover but got turn into akuma and Kanda destroyed her</br>  Great chapter but this thread reeks of tumblr  <br>Yes I know, but that wasn't the sole reason d gray man was delayed since you talked about rushing things. Also Jump/she can always pay another artist to draw for her.</br>  <br>best shounen out there</br>  <br>If you didn't tell us we wouldn't know.</br>  <br>So you're okay with that?</br>  <br>Do you think MAL, veddit and tumblr aren't in others threads as well? Specially the generals you post in? Are you this naive?</br>  <br>But thats not Magi.</br>    <br> Magi <br> best shounen <br>DGM is not either, but this steps over the line</br></br></br>  I need more Lavi fuck your hand Hoshino  <br>Hoshino strongly stated that there was no way she would only handle the script along as she had no ability to express the plot just with just words.</br>  <br>[citation needed]<br><br>How will she draw then? With her butt?</br></br></br>  <br>What's with people getting so autistic with the mere mention of Lenalee? Fujo can't stand the mention of females?</br>  <br>What are you talking about, Lavi was in the chapter</br>  <br>It seems to be more Roadfags than fujo to me</br>  <br> inb4 that's how the gey man will look once Hoshinos arm gives in </br>  <br>Roadfags are nasty because she doesn't actually likes Allen but only the 14th.</br>    <br>She commented that in the lightnovel.<br><br>A chapter of lightnovel was extremely deep connected with the manga's actual plot so she had to make the script herself. She had a hard struggle with it</br></br></br>  <br> Not this is what Lavi looks like now </br>  <br>I see, I kind of remember the novel. Then she will start writing instead keep on with the manga? Well at least it's a solution to end this.</br>  <br>They are Roadfags</br>  re-reading the manga is fun  <br>jesus</br>  <br>What the fuck am I reading.</br>  <br>Western Fujos at their natural habit</br>  <br> filename <br>Stop reading right there</br></br>  <br> I shouldn't be surprised landwhales are mentally unstable</br>  <br>That's why they are fujos after all.</br>  he knew subconciously that he was Nea probably  <br>he doesnt even remember that he was friends with Nea and that he isnt some fucking kid but 35 years old +</br>  <br>T-That doesn't count!</br>  -Allen can never meet Lenalee again <br>-Allen can never laugh,joke or fight with Lavi,Kanda,Kory or Maranda again <br><br>Because if he get's too close it's very clear now that if he does he will kill them.</br></br></br>  <br> - </br>  <br> Because if he get's too close it's very clear now that if he does he will kill them. <br><br>Allen would try to kill himself first</br></br></br>  <br>Jesus christ, this is still alive? <br>I might just have to catch up and see what's been going on.</br></br>  what is the reason she changed her art style ?<br>from her twitter I can see that she has goddamn good skills, she can draw /co/ tier near realistic drawing, but goddamn why she must choose the 'bishonen' style?</br>  <br>instagram, my bad</br>  <br>He can't, his innocence will overpower him just like it did against Suman Dark. Remember him?</br>  <br>Because it makes it easier to draw action scenes and loads of recurring characters in a short amount of time? Common sense, anon.</br>  <br>At first, it was because her art is too Obata-ish and she decided to find a way out.<br>As for the present, switching to her realistic drawing would cause another shock to readers. That's why she just spams it in background.<br><br>She prepares the background herself without help from assistants</br></br></br></br>  <br>At least that would slow Nea down and create a chance for his friends to kill him</br>  <br>Rough sex?</br>  <br>And then all of them break down. Especially Lenalee and Kanda.</br>  <br>They prepare. It was their non-time limited mission</br>  You start to realize D-Gray Man will never get a anime continuation.  <br>I just need an OVA of Lost Fragments of Snow</br>  <br>Maybe it is the reason they exist after all.<br><br>Why would Neah kill them in the first place?</br></br></br>  How can someone be this moe?  <br> that evening, Red lies in the snow to soothe his injuries. Another boy comes up to him and, realizing that Red is from the circus, asks him what his act is. Red shows the boy his arm and the boy runs away in fear </br>  <br>Christ,is that the author or Maranda?</br>  <br>The parasite innocence he has.</br>  <br>Miranda is Hoshino's self insert, so it's the same thing</br>  <br>You really think they can mentally prepare to kill Allen when the time comes? I mean, I'm sure that Choji asshole can, he already tried to kill him once but everyone has been with Allen for a lot longer.</br>   Serafall <br><br>So this is what having a waifu feels like?</br></br>  No, that's what having an erection feels like.  <br>Anon, I think I'm in love with a Botswanian claymation character</br>  Volume 20 spoilers soon.  <br>Season 4 when?

He's just a fucking self-insert, voting for him is like voting for yourself. Holy shit Japan, stop being so faggot.<br><br>Having Kirito in #3 is bad enough.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's a faithful retelling of the True End path to the game with some additional scenes and an expanded epilogue.</br>  Kirito's popularity genuinely annoys me.<br><br>How can anyone like such a horrendous character?

Guy was full of personality, even if if his personality wasn't out spoken as a point.<br><br>Fans who watches the series early on were mostly watching it for him, before the girls started to stand out in their units.<br><br>Guy was awkward as fuck in that way that really gets your attention and makes him likable at times. He can fuck up realistically, but you get the feeling he's trying his hardest, but just can't communicate properly. They especially went out of the way with the non verbal or physical communication with him, kind of like with Chihaya. 765 Producer was a self insert do gooder guy who's popular with everyone and just gives friendship speech while knowing what to say. CG Producer is a guy who can't relate to anyone or say anything right, just holds out his card and gets arrested by the cops each time, follows girls each day with the same approach, hard working tank with a smile fetish like man who Japan can only assume is some sort of pedo, but he has a dream.<br><br>I'll just go with you having not watched it. I mean clearly you didn't.<br><br>They made it fucking clear he wasn't just a stand in for the audience by giving him an outlandish and clear personality.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That I question. I also question the fight against GIl later, because Gil kills him twelve times, then says Berserker is on his last life. But Saber killed him already, so Berserker should be on his -1 life.<br><br>Granted he was pretty much on his -10 life and still broke Enkidu. I think the writers lost track of Berserker's lives.</br></br></br>  She'll never be as popular as Rin and saber, anyone who thinks she will surpass any of them in popularity is delusional.  <br>Sorry man, but IdolM@ster isn't exactly quality story material.</br>  <br> &gt;Saber kills Berserker once, she just beat him up a bit in the VN <br><br>She was able to evade him in the VN but it was clear she was fucked, then he took an A rank NP to the face and they went "Is this guy impossible?"<br><br>At no point did she really beat him up, he was the clear tank advantage even in that route. Although she did better than the other routes.<br><br><br><br>Nasu confirmed that Heracles deflected Caladbolg in the VN so he lost no lives, but he lost two lives in that moment in the anime since he wasn't in a position to block it since he was still healing.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  remove worms  <br>So you didn't watch it<br><br>Gotcha then</br></br></br>  <br> Although she did better than the other routes. <br>Eh, HF is a copy pasta from Fate.</br></br>  <br>She's surpassed Rin very briefly twice so far, but if its not a very big and clear victory like that tenth anniversary poll, then Rin fans will just go "That doesn't count" to bypass it.<br><br>It wasn't a very long lived victory, but they both happened.<br><br>No one will ever surpass Saber though, its just not happening.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>In an interview for the first BD Nasu said he definitely confirmed he lost two lives.<br><br>The problem is that it was animated in a way that made it seem the exact opposite, with no signs of him being hurt, and Rin outright saying Archer's attack didn't do anything.</br></br></br></br>  <br>IIRC they specifically say Saber's winning the fight once they reach the graveyard and she has cover. Granted that's before you find out about his NP/takes a Kaladbolg to the face. That's when they realize he's impossiburu.</br>  <br> Eh, HF is a copy pasta from Fate. <br><br>No shit, because the individual elements that led up to that fight in both those cases did not change drastically, so butterfly effect did not come into play.<br><br>Meanwhile the fight in one route took place in a very different location. It wasn't a complete copy pasta, but the individual pieces were too similar for it to happen differently. Fight still took place close to Shirou's house there.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a girly man with a face so delicate that he's often mistaken for a girl. He's a trap anon.</br>  <br>People say the phone one doesn't count because it literally has an OC made for a website ranking in the top 10.</br>  <br>Good luck convincing faggots that don't think they're the Producer that your series is anything more than pandering for otakus.</br>  <br>Isn't that like complaining about Hakuno being popular in an Extra poll?<br><br>Of course new character will be popular in their own story thing.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Wait, that Kaladbolg killed Berserker? You're right, that's not at all what it looked like. It looked like he tanked it and shrugged. There's zero indication that it even scratched him.<br><br>Guess they fucked that up.</br></br></br></br>  <br> No one will ever surpass Saber though, its just not happening. <br><br>Rin did.</br></br></br>  <br>I haven't read the RN version of FSN, but isn't she a virgin in that version?</br>  <br>Hakuno is a protagonist in two video games. No one fucking knows who the chick from the mobile website is.<br><br>Like here she is. Do you know this character?</br></br></br>  <br>Nasu gave them the scripts, they had to figure out how it should look in motion. So yea<br><br>Q: For Berserker's Noble Phantasm "God Hand," it says that he'll gain resistance to any attack he's been dealt, but does it require for him to "die" for this to happen? Would the same attack work multiple times so long as he doesn't die from it?<br><br>Nasu: There's no need for him to die. It's something like...for example, if he is damaged by flames, after his wounds heal he'd gain +100 fire resistance or so.<br>Takeuchi: Hey, seems like it's been toned-down. Wouldn't it have rendered flames completely ineffective before?<br>Nasu: I said it wouldn't work, not that it would become completely ineffective.<br>BB: "I nullify all attacks, and Mr. Macho there triples his defense! How are these two any different?!"<br>Herakles: "(I'm not hacking the system like you are!)"<br>Takeuchi: Either way, it's a pretty broken skill.<br><br>  It's like this. In the original work it was like "up until now it were just attacks that don't even need to be evaded, but since this alone will cause a fatal wound Berserker intercepted it → great disaster due to Noble Phantasm detonation". On the other hand, in the anime was more like "Berserker couldn't react due to Saber's fatal wound → took it wide open and recovered after another One Life Lost" - please think along these lines. Given the circumstances, two of his remaining lives were expended. <br>  I see, so that's is why God Hand in the anime is , restored after 3 days... </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> Ufotable Cafe polls <br><br>You should know those are never to be trusted as they are not a fair demographic representation.</br></br></br>  <br><br><br>I wish Shirou was more poplar.</br></br></br>  <br>I know she's appeared in several spin offs briefly<br><br>Take Moon, Carnival Phantasm, that other comedy manga.<br><br>Apparently she's gay for that other one.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Do you actually think Sakura will be as popular as rin, considering Rin got her route (Yes, UBW is considered as Rin's route) got a full 25 episode adaptation? Rin was already way popular than sakura prior to that, this just bumps her even higher. Hell, I won't even be surprised if Rin got even more popular in the HF movies.<br><br>Rin beat sakura by almost 2x in the tenth anniversary poll (which is the main poll considering it has the most votes and characters out of all the polls). I'm not saying sakura won't be more popular, but being more popular than Rin will never happen.</br></br></br>  <br>Why do people hate Shirou so much?</br>  <br>Everyone has shit taste</br>  <br>did she always have massive breast</br>  <br> You should know those are never to be trusted as they are not a fair demographic representation. <br><br>I thought we were counting all polls? That anon is talking about the poll were Sakura beats Rin after all.</br></br></br>  <br>But Archer is Shirou.</br>  <br>They can't self insert as him.<br><br>Even still, he's not exactly unpopular, he's just not number 1.</br></br></br>  The Twitter April Fools really showed how much she has grown as she was in 2nd place in terms of followers right behind Saber.  <br>bellyful of halfbreeds</br>  <br>Ufotable Cafe polls are shit for everyone as the Cafes consists of the same customers going in and voting for the same person each week.<br><br>Lancer is #1 in one of them right now and Kirei has been #1 almost the whole time at another.</br></br></br>    <br><br>Shirou is popular.<br><br>He is not Fujoshi popular like Archer, Lancer, Gil, and Kirei but he is still popular.</br></br></br></br>  <br>He's a strongly established character, which means he loses the appeal Kirito and Producer have. And he doesn't have as much snark/humor as Archer yet, so he doesn't have the "smug badass" appeal down either.<br><br>Shirou is like a baby badass.</br></br></br>  <br>Give her time on the big screen. Quite literally all that has to be done.</br>  <br>Depends on if Sakura ever gets a proper adaption, before I can make that call. So far she's the only heroine to not get any kind of showing to date or adaption. At best she's just kind of been on the coat tails or unplayed.<br><br>The recent HF manga was her first official adaption of any kind, where she's actually in this as a main.<br><br>We're holding out hopes for the HF movies to be good.<br><br>We might start to see some changes because of this. Its like if you say "Well heroine isn't popular" compared to two other heroines that are advertised more than anything, have been on all the promo art since 06 DEEN, have adaptions, and show up in most things when comparing them to one that has never been advertised or really adapted/shown. For both anime that have come out, Prism, and the offshoots Rin has been always a starring role that's been in almost every episode. That seems a bit one sided as well. So this is something new to explore here.<br><br>Even Nasu calls Rin something like that narrator or Usher of Fate. She literally has more of a showing than any other character in the original story. So she's been advertised always as much as Saber.<br><br>I can say that when the adaption was announced a year back, it did get some major applause and trending, as though people were waiting for this one for awhile. It feels like a new chance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Shirou, Rin, Saber and maybe illya will get more screen time than sakura. <br><br>Things aren't looking good for Sakura.</br></br></br>  I wonder when Takeuchi will finally force Nasu to get that proper Fate Adaptation.  <br>The one thing that the HF preview said after UBW ended was that HF was the "Last Episode".<br><br>So never?</br></br></br>  <br>He is busy drawing Saber for F/GO and working on Hisui and Kohaku for Tsukihime to fuel his maid fetish.</br>  <br>Seems to me that they have the best taste. But honestly what makes this poll less accurate than a poll that a very small amount of people voted? You seem pretty biased now.</br>  <br>Maybe CCC was the first of this trend actually, but people do still draw the line that's a different character.<br><br>She is still quite loved there, there's not much to say wrong about her character that you could say about the original.</br></br></br>  <br>Have you played heaven's feel?</br>  <br>You do realize Sakura barely has more screentime than Saber and Kotomine, right?</br>  Clearly robot waifus are the future  <br>Now what exactly is that?</br>    <br> Forcing Sakura onto our self-insert <br><br>Sasuga Nasu</br></br></br>  <br> But honestly what makes this poll less accurate than a poll that a very small amount of people voted? <br><br> Votes based on people that visit the cafe regularly only <br> All the Cafe votes tend to produce the same results each time in each location <br>How is that accurate/fairly represented?<br><br>The TM poll itself at least gives everyone and anyone the chance to vote versus those who go to the cafes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Even during the Heaven's Fall  <br>As you said, Rin (and saber) have appeared in a lot of stuff since 06 DEEN. Hell, Rin is a major contender to win Shirou in the so called "Illya route." Even in the HF movie, Rin plays a huge part, and I'm pretty sure receives even more screen time than Sakura. With all the fans prior to the announcement of the HF movies plus all the secondaries UBW anime brought in who circlejerk Rin like crazy, I don't see a chance of sakura surpassing Rin.</br>   HF will make Sakura surpass Rin <br>That never happens. THAT NEVER HAPPENS. <br>Also, Saber is fucking hopeless. The king of cucks will always sit on first place.</br></br>  <br>She has much more screen time than both of them,</br>  <br> implying they aren't going to shoehorn Saber and illya like crazy in the movies like they did for UBW </br>  <br>Illya a best.</br>  <br>Because if 500 people vote for the same characters over and over it will end with the same shit only inflated numbers.</br>  Hey guys<br>filthy secondary here<br>I want to get more into this series but the more I dig the more I realize this universe is fucking vast and I'm not sure if I have the time/dedication for it<br>So I'd really appreciate it if someone could at least fill me in on these topical memes I see often<br><br>why is sakura a "wormslut"<br>why does rin "pleasure old men for money"<br>thanks</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Fuck off and read the VN</br>  <br>Is it wrong for me to want to wait until I have enough time to give it justice, rather than to have to rush through it to grasp a few jokes?</br>  <br> why is sakura a "wormslut" <br><br>Because worms fucked her.Seriously. I really don't know how to explain this without you reading the VN or waiting to watch the movies.<br><br> why does rin "pleasure old men for money" <br><br>It's a meme from a non canon doujin, I'm serious.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's Blossom Sensei<br><br>She's a nurse, she's chaste, she's a certified teacher in charge of that facility, and she has a lab coat.<br><br>She's a potentially immortal AI possibly as old as the Earth itself, rather than being Sakura. She even comments that her name was chosen from random among the contestants this contest. An AI that runs the god machine, but has developed a soul. She must wonder what is more important, her duty as an Administrator, her own heart, and what these new feelings mean. Also pretty dense at times, self sacrificing, and robotic in nature. <br><br>Its like complaining "Oh fuck, here comes Arthuria again in Extra, except now she's wearing Red. That fucking cash cow". Really its someone entirely different who just looks the sameular.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>So she discards her own heart as her first action, and gets back to being an admin as is her programming since she must fulfill her duty.<br><br>Except something you cast away isn't so quickly lost as that. Even if the mind forgets, the heart won't ever forget.<br><br>You can't get rid of a soul that easily.</br></br></br></br></br>   BB: To think that I would only last a few seconds. Now, Gilgamesh-san, hurry and take this happy person away. <br><br> BB: …Far away, far, far away. Far enough away that my hands can’t reach them. Far enough away that they won’t be able to see either regrets or dreams. <br><br> Gilgamesh: …That wish has certainly reached me. In your final moments, emerge from your cocoon and disappear, butterfly of the moon. Exhaust everything and disappear without regrets. </br></br></br></br>  Remove Sakura and no one would care. Saber and Rin are too important.  After CCC I'm not sure there is a better bro than Gilgamesh out there.<br><br>Its not even the big things with him, rather the small personal conversations you share with him are just great.</br></br>  <br> why is sakura a "wormslut" <br><br>Because she literally fucks worms.</br></br></br>  Why do you people care about polls so much? What mostly influence them are exposure and timing. Sakura is already like well enough among type-moon fans, once she gets an adaption she's going to see a rise in popularity, and the HF manga is probably doing something for her right now. It's quite simple as more people see her more people are going to like her. Do you people think Arc managed to get over double the votes of the next Tsukihime character or Alice made top ten because there was something about them that made them so much more popular than the others? Arc just happened to get two adaptations of her route and Alice's game was just released so she was fotm. Though Arc probably still would've bee more popular than the other heroines you've go to be insane to think such disparities are because something about her character is more likable rather than her being the heroine in more adaptations, as opposed to just being remebered by some people as Koha Ace/The maid that lets Akiha drink blood from her tittties. Or in Sakura's case Sad Loli/Bondage girl.  <br>Her adopted grandfather straps her in a basement where worms eat her for days and days as a form of torture that he calls training.<br><br>This started when she was eight years old, sold by her real father to some creepy vampire from across the street.<br><br>She was abused, but she never broke, she endured much to his own surprise as he was frankly trying to break her or destroy her at times for fun. She became a mopey sort of girl and wasn't unaffected by this at all, but she refused to break at least and let that be all her life meant. Rather she just developed more resistance and a desire that she had to live. People like to sell it their own way, but it was rape as a fact said in the game, it wasn't normal, it wasn't something she ever wanted or needed or even sought out, and it did suck. Even ten years later she says it still sucks, it didn't become pleasurable like a mind break doujinshi. It was just a living hell for her all those years where even two hours there was complete shit.<br><br>Can't go to the cops, they don't get how this magic thing works and any magus worth anything could deal with the police with their eyes closed. The Magus Association would as well help them do it if it meant magic stays secret.<br><br>She always felt trapped, but as she met and lived with MC for awhile, she started to realize she wasn't as trapped as she thought. She started to become more outgoing and stronger in the last year. While she still has to endure that hell, she's starting to change and realize she might not have to put up with it. There's two world lines now where they're able to put a stop to it.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>People want their own views validated in terms of numbers, so they can shit on everyone else who's a lesser number<br><br>So they can feel good about themselves.<br><br>Typically<br><br>That type of thing is seen a lot in life actually</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I'm sure Ufo will throw in some extra scenes that either lift her up or absolutely shit on her</br>  <br>Remember her final scene in Zero?</br>  <br>And then she used her problems as an excuse to be a fucking monster.<br><br>Sakura a shit. Don't give a fuck how hard her life was, that's not an excuse to be as bad as the people who hurt you.</br></br></br>  <br>Dark Sakura never killed anyone besides for Shinji, Gil, or Zouken.</br>  <br><br>We can stop this now I know both of you won't convince the other that you are right.</br></br>  <br>We've got 350 posts left till the bump limit, plenty of time for a senseless argument.<br><br><br>Reminder that sakura is being told that she is evil by a man who is a canon evil dick and has everything to gain from sakura convincing herself that she's evil.<br><br>Additional reminder that the narrator in this scene is also Kirei.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I have no idea how the nips actually like Sakura more than Ilya; or Saber more than Rin for that matter.</br>  <br>When has Kirei ever once outright told a lie?</br>  <br>Saber is an ideal foreign beauty. Tiny, submissive, but willing to protect you, while also being exotic looking.</br>  <br>Yes, a canon evil dick. An incredibly smart canon evil dick that's literally never been wrong about a single character in the series up to this point when he tries to psychoanalyze them or fuck with them.<br><br>"This is the only time Kotomine was wrong" is a pretty poor argument. Also, no, he was not the narrator. If he was, it would read "I'm absolutely right" and "glares back at me".<br><br>Sakurafags just hate the fact that she became a monster and genuinely wants to make others suffer. She went out of her way to try to kill Shirou and Rider, the two people who were unshakably on her side, while in full control of herself. She also tried to kill Rin. And you can argue that's less bad because Rin wasn't exactly being friendly in that scene, but up to that point she'd only been trying to help Sakura, and was totally full of shit threatening to kill her.<br><br>Sakura tried to kill everyone that loved her and cared about her while they were trying to help her while she was in complete control of her actions. Fact. And it's fucking irredeemable.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Just because Kirei is correct, doesn't mean he's right.</br>  <br>You say that like Kirei has ever been wrong, or lied about how someone's fucked up.<br><br>He analyzes people and shoves their genuine faults that they hate right in their faces then laughs about it.</br></br></br>  <br>She wasn't thinking clearly. It is impossible to think clearly when you're that blackened unless you are a mesopotamian douchebag. It is absolutely redeemable, just ask the sword-man.<br><br>Remember, Sakura was trying to get back at the world that had done nothing but shit on her for 10 years. She felt betrayed. <br><br>Also, she did not go out of her way to try and kill Shirou and Rider, she explicitly went out of her way to avoid it. Saber was a guard. She was guarding the cave. If she wanted Shirou and Rider dead, she would have killed them. <br><br>Sakura felt betrayed. The world had done nothing but shit on her for a very long time, and when she learned that the only thing she truly had in common with Shirou, the bar jump, was witnessed also by Rin, she starts to see her apparently uncaring sister as an enemy. When you couple feelings of betrayal and an in the midst of an anthrosemitic fit, yes, you might try to kill someone who you might not.<br><br>If you can call "Telling the watchdog to let Rin walk by" trying to kill her.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  Is there a bigger meme character than Matou Sakura?  <br> Also, she did not go out of her way to try and kill Shirou and Rider <br>You're right. She only attacked them at the house and only tried to kill them a little bit. That's fine, right? No big deal. Other than that, she never tried to kill them. She just put murder machines in between her and those she knew were coming after her.<br><br>And she was genuinely trying to murder Tohsaka when the two fought. Keep telling yourself she didn't try to kill everyone around her, because that is factually incorrect if you were paying any attention.<br> Sakura felt betrayed <br>Boo fucking hoo. Not an excuse for anything she did.<br><br>And that's the Sakurafag argument for everything: she's a suffering rape victim, so suffering she instills or tries to instill is totally fine. I notice that all Sakurafags are also massive whiteknightfags.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>  I notice that all Sakurafags are also massive whiteknightfags. <br>Welcome to the point of Fate/Stay Night.<br><br>What's wrong with her being emotional? She has every right to be emotional after what she's been through. She didn't force anyone to come after her. Shirou and Rider wanted to stop her, so Sakura had Saber intercept them. Rin showed up, and Sakura wasn't making Rin come to her, but Sakura just wanted to make the world burn for the suffering it piled on her, and when your sister, your main rival for the possession of the only ray of light in the miserable existence of your life, comes to stop you, I don't think she's that bad when she tried to kill her. <br><br>Also, notice how her desire to murder everyone disappears after Shirou fakes his way out of the situation?<br><br>Everything about her is totally fucking fine once Shirou uses rule breaker. She's not evil before mad sheeny dude, and she's not evil after the furious hebrew is dispelled. <br>I don't think you can hate an emotional person in an emotional situation for acting emotionally.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>You write like a massive prick, Not even a Sakurafag, you're just annoying.</br>  <br>Welcome to 4chan?</br>  <br>I didn't realize being really emotional and acting really emotional was a legal defense for any crimes.<br><br>So really, it's 100% Sakurafags whiteknighting because she had a hard time. She was emotional, had a hard life, etc, so she's excused from her actions.</br></br></br>  <br>Why don't you read the other parts of my post?</br>  <br>I did. You just pointed out how she was reacting emotionally to everything. And no shit everything's fine after RB, everyone totally brushed off everything she did and accepted her back into the "family". Why they did that I have no idea. Shirou says something about how she has to live to atone, but that's it.</br>  <br> Why they did that I have no idea. <br>Because Shirou chose to prioritize her over everyone else, regardless of whatever.</br></br>  <br>Seriously, why ufotable. That's a little young to start identifying with her captors</br>  <br>I said "they", not "Shirou". Didn't miss Shirou's entire character arc.</br>    <br>Rin did because Sakura's her imouto. She too couldn't do what needed to be done.</br>  <br>Where did the meme of "Kirei never lies, just twists the truth" come from?</br>  <br><br>remove worms</br></br>  She's not pure so she'll never be popular with Otaku.  <br>BABY</br>  I am the bone of my missile<br>Steel my body and jet fuel my blood<br>I have created over a thousand JETS<br>Have fired over a thousand missiles<br>yet jet fuel will never melt steel beams<br>So as I pray, UNLIMITED JET WORKS.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>No matter what, will be ALWAYS better than Rin</br>  <br>What will always be better than Rin?

And ending would have been much more dramatic as Matou Rin would be more psychotic and unstable than Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br> Matou Rin would be more psychotic and unstable than Sakura <br><br>Any particular reason why?</br></br></br>  <br>If she's gonna be more assertive than Shinji, she'll be the one reigning in Rider.<br><br>Well she gets splatted by Berserker in Fate<br>Gets a heart transplant with Dr.Gil in UBW<br>HF really damn questionable though</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Holy fuck that's a Bollywood actor everyone here in curryland make fun of.</br>    <br>Rin has a stronger character than Sakura, but on the other hand she is surprisingly emotionally more fragile than Sakura. You can see that many times in Game. Now just imagine what could happen with her character if it was she who was wormraped from childhood.</br>  <br> If she's gonna be more assertive than Shinji, she'll be the one reigning in Rider. <br>This is very possible.</br></br>  Since there's a Sakura-Rin switch, why not make the war more confusing<br><br>Sakura Tohsaka<br>Rin Matou<br>Kotomine Shirou (not Marik)<br>Illya Emiya, <br>Issei is the one who saved Caster's ass<br>Bazette didn't died that day,rather Kirei got fisted</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br>If you want see glimpse of "Matou Rin" personality then you read Rin's eclipse in Hollow Ataraxia. Here at nearly end Rin for a moment becomes completely mindbroken from all pleasure and even develop Sakura-like dull eyes. This is how "Matou Rin" would be if you get on her Dere side.</br></br></br>  <br/>  <br>Underrated post.</br>  <br>this whole scene is so much better than her usual self.</br>  <br><br>Well, they are sisters by blood.<br>Ironically, the Rin mistakenly thought the future dere Rin was Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br> Kotomine Shirou <br>In this situation is he adopted by Kirei or is he Kirei's son? Either way the heir to the Tohsaka family, in this case I guess it'd be Sakura, growing up with Shiroutomine would be fun.</br></br>  <br>Here it's nice to see a difference. Normal Rin at beginning of Eclipse directly prohibits Shirou from coming inside her. Mindbroken Rin on the contrary legslock him with the intention of forcing him to impregnate her.</br>  More &gt;everyday until you like it.<br><br>More redirecting anons to the VN, and not the anime.<br>The more anons that actually finish the VN, the more popular she will become.</br></br></br>  <br>Is Sakura the most aesthetic fate character?</br>  <br>It's quite ironic that Hollow Ataraxia moreless confirms that both sisters will switch their personalities in future. <br>Even Shirou notices during story that Sakura is slowly turning into "second Tohsaka". And we all know what Rin's future is.</br></br>  <br><br>Sakura tends to be more understanding and patient than Rin, so without the breaking, I would think HF would actually end much sooner and happier. Sakura was the one out of the two that tried the hardest to bury the hatchet before shit went down. They would have a seriously heated talk yes, and maybe a spell or two would fly, but it would end after that. <br><br>Maybe even sooner. Since Sakura is the type that would probably disobey Tokiomi's orders to be with Rin. Not stalking, but actually hanging out with. Rin would stubbornly deny and evade, but contrary to what is normally thought about Sakura, she is good at cutting through bullshit in a diplomatic, non-confrontational way.</br></br></br></br>  <br>nah</br>  <br>Pleasing old men and filled with worms. And its her endgame, so no one will save her then.</br>  <br><br> I would think HF would actually end much sooner and happier. <br> but it would end after that. <br>No, I can imagine how Rin will rejecting any help from Sakura.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>It'd less a personality switch and more a shift. Sakura becomes more forceful as she matures (dealing with Shinji in boot camp fashion, captaining the archery club well, and generally demanding more), while keeping her empathetic patient nature, which unabashedly loves.<br><br>Rin generally becomes less (LESS) confrontational and more accepting(understands that a firm hand isn't what will fix Shirou, but patience, understanding, and active love). But still keeps her mischeviousness.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I like BB better not because of the chaste virgin shit, she could be a slut and I wouldn't give a fuck (everyone in Extra is slutty). It's the long hair, pupil eyes, fun personality and the outfit. <br><br>Sakura has a nice design but her personality and clothes are kind of boring. Dark Sakura aspect is better.</br></br></br>  <br><br> The cafe polls is based on what things are sold. Rin got more new merch that week, so her stuff sold more...<br><br>When it was Kotomine birthday and he got special bullshit merch, he ranked number one.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would Shirou still be the love interest in this scenario? I'm imagining a gloomy shota Shirou after being adopted by Kirei that doesn't talk or leave the church much and is mildly sadistic. Sakura would probably be more or less the same worrying for the depress looking kid that Kirei brought back, and be the only person Shirou interacts with other than Kirei. Matou Rin would be a really scary looking girl that people at school avoid, but is actually really sweet. She sometimes visits the church and that's how she meets Shirou.</br>  <br>So basically, Sakura is mature and Rin is childish?</br>  <br>"Sakura" has more in common with Saber and Arc, as per main heroine of Fate/Extra franchise. It's the whole "I'm an emotionless superpowerful being who must fulfill a duty but what is this thing called love?" that Nasu uses yet again.</br>  <br>We could keep doing this and have even more Cross-household characters.</br>      <br>Kotomine Sakura would be fantastic.</br>  <br><br>A bit of irony is that Nasu says in Shinji's bio that if Sakura didn't care and treated him like garbage, he would level out.<br><br>That is kind of terrible that you would need to treat someone like trash for them to improve. Or rather, pathetic.</br></br></br></br>    <br>Kotomine Sakura gives me Kiara vibes.</br>  <br>Shinji is fine the way he is.</br>  <br><br>How much better would Sakura's life have been if Kiritsugu adopted both her and Shirou?</br></br>  <br>If Kiritsugu did that I feel like it would have been aweful for Shirou. He wouldn't have learned how to cook because Sakura would do all the cooking.<br>A Shirou that can't cook? Please no.</br></br>  <br>Anything would've been better than being adopted by the Matou.</br>  <br><br>No matter what, the Japanese want the sisters to fuck.<br><br>They even had to loli shimai make out for a gum ad.</br></br></br></br>  <br>In the case that they would both be save from The Fire, Sakura would've already been at the Matou house for a year but It would be before the crest worm was implanted in her so the only real problem she would have is her smile and optimism being gone. <br>Shirou would basically go around protecting Sakura because of his desire to be a hero, and She'd probably follow him around closely all of the time then grow-up to be extremely attached to her new brother. Or maybe Shriou gets a side kick?<br><br>Short answer, cute.</br></br></br></br>  <br> make out for a gum ad <br>wait, what?</br></br>  <br> He wouldn't have learned how to cook because Sakura would do all the cooking. <br> implying it wouldn't be filled with them trying to do work together around the house with childish shenanigans <br>Using each other to reach high places, carrying heavy pots together, being used by Taiga onee-san as personal snack bearers.</br></br></br>  <br><br>I don't have the pic with me, but for a parody of a gum ad, loli Sakura and Rin locked lips. It was done with Zero characters.</br></br>  <br>Nevermind, I found it.</br>  <br>Is that tongue or are they sharing gum?</br>  I'll never get why Saber is so overwhelmingly popular.  <br> first heroine <br> fate anime <br> manga <br> F/Z <br> in a shit ton of spin-offs <br> blonde foreigner </br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Looks like a gum to me.</br>  <br>Makes me wonder if her popularity will ever really go down. She wasn't particularly given muc special treatment in UBW (they dodged all her flag scenes), and Prisma doesn't really give her any love. Next up is HF, and she out for like, half the story.</br>    <br><br> No grail installed inside her <br> Blackened <br><br>She would still have excellent anti-spirit stuff, especially since Imaginary Element won't be reduced by Matou experiments, but being blackened without the grail shards is impossible.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Retcon the fact that she's a slut fueled by sex in her route.<br><br>While you're at it, retcon the fact that she regularly bathes in a pool of dick-shaped worms every day of her life.</br></br></br>  <br>Kid Sakura and Shirou adventures are a-ok with me.</br>  <br><br>She doesn't need any of that.<br><br>She's the best looking heroine (I don't care about her but her design is better than generic twin tails which is know pretty common and Sakura's design which is bland outside of her edgy phase) and her popularity doesn't rely on Shirou romance. Lancer and Gilgamesh are more popular pairings for Saber, actually. <br><br>She's the main Servant, the poster child, the face of Fate franchise in general. She transcends her heroine role as the actual center of the franchise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>I'd pay to see Kotomine Sakura taking on huge village of vampires, or DAAs</br></br>  <br>Yeah, but all the things coming out lately have her not exactly being the poster child. UBW gave her a slice of the pie, but Rin, Shirou, and Archer ended up being shown off more, at least on official stuff.<br><br>Prisma doesn't do anything for her, and outside of Alter, which comes pretty late in ther route, there's not much to push with her in HF.</br></br></br>  <br><br>And blonde, green eyes swordswomen with top buns is somehow uncommon? There are literal thousands of the same character design that Saber has, her armor is the thing that stands out.<br><br>All three heroine's are iconic due to the sheer popularity of the franchise. Sakura's regular form gets as much fanart as her darkened form for instance (regardless of how silly people are saying she is unpopular). Really, she gets tons of additional designs in canon.<br><br>Pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br>   Kotomine Shirou <br> Kotomine Sakura <br> Karen Ortensia <br>Why isn't there a spin off with these as a group of church executioners?</br></br></br>  <br> her armor is the thing that stands out. <br><br>And her suit, you forget that Zero was far more popular than UBW in Japan. Suit Saber has a more distinctive look and charisma than Rin or Sakura could never meet or dream about.<br><br>She's more fashioned to be liked by mostly everyone. While Rin and Sakura are more niche.<br><br><br>She's still the poster child in UBW. Rin's just a love interest. Shirou and Archer are the mc/main antagonist, but Saber is as usual the star. Nasu asked ufotable to make her the most stunning character visually.<br><br> Prisma <br> relevant <br><br>It's just an unpopular spinoff for lolicons without any relevance.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I think the thing is Saber just feels like Fate stay night, if that makes any sense. She's a servant, heroine, unique amour design, and the "are you my master?" contract scene is probably the most iconic moment in the series (It's also apart of every route). Sakura is definitely my favorite heroine, but everything about Saber's image fits F/SN.</br>  <br> She's still the poster child in UBW. <br> Saber is as usual the star. <br>Literally what</br></br></br>  <br>Huh?<br><br>Nasu went and said he couldn't conceive the existence of Fate without Saber. Rin, Sakura and Illya are extra load which have some screentime but Saber is and always was the point of the franchise. This began with Saiba as male and continues as female, that's why every single spin off has either a cameo or a fucking clone. Did you even miss the Alt ServantxMaster pairs which features Arturia twice, Mordred (her actual clone) and Arthur? Half of the roster.</br></br></br>  <br>Dude, most of the literal posters for UBW either had Shirou and Archer up front, Rin, or Rin and Saber. Especially in the second season.<br><br>Like, they did stuff for Saber, but she was not the poster child for UBW.</br></br></br>  <br>Check out Newtype polls. Rin never beats Saber. She's got far more development than Rin did too whose development was "I thirst for Shirou's Dick more" and she's completely irrelevant. UBW Anime Rin is pretty shitty. While Saber got expanded, fuck she even got Garden of Avalon in BD 1.</br>  <br> Check out Newtype polls. <br>Irrelevant to the point you're trying to make.<br><br> She's got far more development than Rin did  <br>How? She barely had any screentime.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Oh boy, we doing the meme now where Rin didn't get development in UBW?<br><br>Rin's development revolved around her interactions with Shirou and Archer. Through watching them, and getting to know them, she sees there are different, but equally acceptable paths to being a magus. It's much the same arc she got in HF, but revolving around Shirou rather than Sakura.</br></br></br>  <br>to not be shirou's bitch and be a strong independent WOman</br>  <br> Irrelevant to the point you're trying to make. <br><br>It is. She's the star. The Minmay.<br><br> How? She barely had any screentime. <br><br>You should actually re-watch, last episode kind of rooted your brain. Anime Saber development started in Zero, which UBW anime is a sequel of. She got a complete arc.<br><br>Rin got zero besides becoming weak love interest. You pretend to split the characters, but anime watchers think Zero and then UBW. Saber is the star while Emiya bullshit are the protagonists.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>   Saberfags   <br> Lancerfags </br>  <br> Rin's development revolved around her interactions with Shirou and Archer. <br><br> Rin did too whose development was "I thirst for Shirou's Dick more" <br><br>My point exactly, she existed only to be dicked by Shirou (in a metaphorical way), and nothing else. While Saber was a king grieving and destroying herself, who after her breakdown in Zero, finally got to fulfill her promise to do a honorable duel with a pretty Servant, protect her Masters and destroy the Grail in a way she has no regrets. Anime Saber has a storyarc that revolves around her issues, even if Shirou and Archer help her by projection, it's always about herself. <br><br>Rin is an accessory who doesn't exist beside her role as love Interest.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Can anyone tell me the name of the "CG" Idelm@ster? I wanted to get into it for a while and that sounds promising.</br>  <br>Jesus, you're talking out of your ass, buddy. All of Saber's development was already in the UBW route in the VN itself. There was no grand connection made between Zero and UBW in the anime. Do you think Saber watched Shirou's fight with Archer for shits and giggles? It was an important moment because she saw parallels between Shirou and herself.<br><br>Rin does get development as well.. She has multiple scenes where she takes issue with her Shirou learned to be a magi, and with Kerry's teachings, but as she gets to know Shirou, find out more about his character, she grows more empathetic to other types of mindsets.</br></br></br>  <br>You're a raging Saberfag, but you're totally ignorant to the fact that all this shit was already in the VN. </br>  <br>rin is a girl!,people die when they are kills !</br>  <br> Rin is an accessory who doesn't exist beside her role as love Interest. <br>You're trying too hard.</br></br>   thinking about Saber's popularity ever waning <br><br>Rin's time is nearly up, though. Even as the main heroine of UBW and her role in Prisma, she didn't get any real strong reaction from the nips. She fell behind Sakura and Nero in Type Moon twitter, with all her exposure, kind of pathetic.<br><br>She also was always behind Saber one, two or more places in Newtype and other magazine polls.<br><br>Japan is a little tired of tsundere characters. It's Sakura whose popularity is increasing (Saber's always been popular) over the years. Not even Zero adaptation which made her a cunt damaged her rise.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What's funny is that Shirou never actually talks shit about Rin. Like, he questions King Arthur, but the high school girl has totally got this in the bag.</br>  <br>Because Shirou loves Saber and wants to protect her (he'll do the same for Sakura and Taiga). He doesn't care if Rin dies.</br>  <br> Saber ranks number 2 consistently in Newtype <br> Her popularity is waning <br><br>She's the fourth most popular character in Prisma, too. In a show about lolis, she beats out a couple of lolis.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Prisma poll <br> she ranks after fucking MIYU AND KURO <br><br>I bet if Saber Alter were there, she would be more popular than Rin. Rin's kind of obnoxious right now. 2ch called her the red cockroach through UBW airing.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Uro: It isn't a relationship fueled by instinct like the relationship between a man and a woman, but a romance of logic between two people who need each other from the heart. I think the Saber route could have been told as a story through the ancient Greek views on love. That's what makes Saber's story so refreshing, and why she's become such a popular character. On the other hand, I think the true heroine of Fate/stay night is Rin. In the Rin route, an equal relationship with a woman who's become stronger than men is depicted. Rin and Shirou mend each other's weaknesses with their own unique strengths, and I think it makes for a very nice relationship. <br><br>Nah, there's actually a point made about how Shirou and Rin have this balanced sort of relationship going on.</br></br></br>   no caster route <br>largest crime of Fate</br>  <br> Ranks after the main characters <br><br>Yeah?

She's fucking Rin. If she falls behind pathetic loli ocs is because she's eclipsed.

She lost to Archer too when she used to rank before him in the general type moon poll of 2012. Her vote count dropped considerably while Saber's maintained hers and Sakura's increased.<br><br>Sakura's the heroine in the rise, while Rin's declining even with all her exposure. They are still popular, but Rin used to be way more popular and she needs a lot of exposure to actually keep people interested. Saber doesn't need that.

She does her job well as Supervisor, got a bishop of the church as her mentor, and did well to make the archery club prosper. None of that had anything to do with Shirou.<br><br>Too bad Nasu never saw fit to give that old bishop a character model or lines, or even a name until Hollow.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Sakura would probably be more or less the same <br>There was many times implied that if Sakura wasn't influenced by Matous, then her personality would be basically milder version of Luvia.</br></br>  <br>What would their combination attacks be?</br>  wormslut will always remain the least popular.  She's popular.<br><br> In my heart. </br></br>  Sakura does do bad things, and I can see why people would dislike or perhaps even hate her for them. I suppose the more appropriate word would be "excessive" or "continuous" or the like.<br><br>Sakura having a terrible life does not give her the right to be terrible to others, that is for certain. However, when one considers just how broken Sakura is based on her upbringing, I can understand why she'd come to the point where she'd be capable of doing bad things to others. I mean, I won't go too deep into spoilers, but man, her life was shit. You don't come out of that upbringing as a cool and level-headed individual. Shinji was broken by his upbringing under Zouken Matou as well, and Shinji didn't go through what Sakura went through. Zouken, as it turns out, is a bad parental figure.<br><br>In any case, what comes to mind is that line from Oregairu - the one that I think Hayama says to Hachiman. "You help others because you want someone else to help you" or something like that. I don't remember the words, but that's the sentiment. I do find myself sympathizing with certain characters who do bad things, like Sakura, perhaps because I know that I've hardly been a perfect individual throughout my life. I mean, I'm not saying that I've done things to the same degree of what Sakura is capable of doing (some of those HF bad endings are properly scary), but you get the point. Sakura isn't perfect. She isn't rational. But I still find myself liking her in the end.</br></br></br></br>  <br>It's ok, senpai.</br>  <br>I think I'm going to be sick.  Gross </br>  <br> 4. Sakura Matou <br> 7.

Best cover story aside from From the Decks of the World.  Do you guys think bellamy will actually become a crew member? he seems like the most likely out of dressrosa at the least.  <br>at this point yes he is the strongest candidate<br><br>but<br> redundant power set <br> may wind up with Law because tattoo <br> Viola still a strong contender <br> he's kind of a fucking loser </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>More likely to join Laws crew because<br><br>1. His chest tattoo can easily be changed to Laws.<br><br>2. He originally joined Doffy for being the pride of the North Blue, Law is also from the North Blue.<br><br>3. He wants to survive the great wave mentioned in pic related.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>There will be no-one from Dressrosa.</br>  <br><br>That and I can't imagine Nami being comfortable with it. Though Luffy wouldn't listen to protests anyway.</br></br>  <br>Second best you mean.</br>  <br><br><br>He's going to go an adventure alone to find his true self.</br></br></br>  <br>I think Oda paired Jinbei and Sanji up in FMI to convey them as equals. While I feel like Jinbei is stronger, I pair them together still because they're similar and close in general.<br> <br>Jinbei's body is naturally better at handling something like that. He's much larger and possibly has organs spaced out more/differently. Like with Ace, Sakazuki's magmafist is large in comparison to the torso and therefore is much more likely to kill Zoro/Ace.</br></br></br>  <br> Viola still a strong contender <br>Anon you could have made sense if you just didn't add this.</br></br>  <br> was a consenting member of the pirate crew the marines are arresting <br> first girl to actually like sanji back <br> unique and practical powerset <br> unique group dynamic (isn't a slut) <br> Rebecca can be princess in her stead </br></br></br></br></br>  so is sabo strong, or is burger weak?<br><br>is sabo possibly as strong as doffy? stronger?<br><br>do you think sabo is stronger than g4 luffy? (obviously he would win a 1v1 either way, he'd outlast like doffy did most likely)</br></br></br></br>  <br>He'd be better off with Law.</br>  <br>All of that is irrelevant. And Rebecca can't become the queen, legally she isn't allowed to. Honestly, Rebecca has a more likely chance of joining than Viola.</br>  <br> legally <br><br>they JUST overthrew the government...</br></br></br>  <br>If he's the second strongest member of the revolutionaries it would make sense that he can beat somebody who's only like the 5th or 6th strongest member of a yonkou crew. <br><br>Sabo is probably around Marcos lever.</br></br></br>  <br> Has a fruit that ruins every part of adventure and exploration. <br><br>You can't honestly think Sanji will finally get what he wants right?</br></br></br>  <br>Doesn't matter. She may be blood to Riku, but her mother abandoned the throne. She wasn't born into royalty. She's just a regular woman. And I really don't see her becoming the princess. Viola's powers are more suited for keeping the kingdom under a watchful eye, which would fit with One Piece's way of doing things after an arc or with cover stories. Plus, why do you want someone who can see what's coming ahead before it happens? That's not what Luffy would want.</br>  <br>Viola is so similar to Robin though. Monet/Perona would have been a nice change-up.</br>  <br> lever </br>  <br>They're pulling each others levers all day anon. You can't deny it.</br>  <br>Agreed, not saying she's the best most interesting possible new female nakama, just that she has a good chance.</br>   people still think Straw Hats are getting a new crewmember out of this <br>nobody in Dressrosa stood out except Law and he's not joining</br>  <br>Brook was the first one to sacrifice himself.</br>  <br>Honestly, after the Paulie feint, I don't even pretend to know who Oda's going to have join or not.</br>  <br>You mean after Robin, right?</br>  <br>Actually, regardless of who did what and when, in the end the order of royalty will go by bloodline. I don't remember who was older, Viola or Rebecca's mom, but whoever was older would rule next. I believe Viola. If Rebecca's mom was older then at the moment next in line is Rebecca (followed by Viola of Rebecca dies before birthing kids).</br>  <br>it was rebeccas mom, she's next in line.<br><br>I wish that kyros became king though, hes able to protect his country with strengh if he has to, and hes nice like king riku. just seems ideal</br></br></br>  <br>He can't. Not a drop of royal blood. But, he can rule by proxie, more or less, as an advisor to his daughter.<br><br>I agree he is strong, but is he wise enough yet? It's true that we see a transition of him going from hooligan to an actual asset to the crown. And while that does take scruples to be picked up or developed, I doubt he's fully there yet.</br></br></br>  <br>Jango's Dance Paradise a  underrated but still not better than Miss Goldenweek's </br>  <br>Ha! That was one of those Oda stunts that left a deep impression on me. I felt so confused when it first happened.</br>  <br>I like how those two overlapped through coverstories. The bromance formed between Jango and Fullbody and the fun of it makes it my favourite. Baroque Works one was also enjoyable though.</br>  <br>I want him to join up with Barto and Cavendish as a Strawhat fanboy</br>  what will be sanjis new secret technique that puts him back in the top 3 strongest strawhat? <br><br>Honestly though the monster trio has become very broken, zorro is miles ahead of sanji and luffy is on a whole level entirely compared to the rest of crew ( just like every other captain)<br><br>I think the new monster trio is going to be ussop zorro sanji once ussop and sanji get their shit together</br></br></br></br>  <br>Hmm, I can't really pick a favourite.</br>  <br> not Zoro, Franky and Sanji <br>they're the heavy hitters that aren't Luffy. Chopper could also be up there if he was better at actually fighting.</br></br>  <br> x=26+x <br><br>Iva taught him how to wink REALLY hard<br><br>or him being able to fly is really handy for Godzilla sized bosses</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Daz is the most underrated cutie<br><br>Does ANYONE have a more adorable dream?</br></br></br>  <br>Shanks, Law and Kuzan suddenly got really hot<br><br>Honorable mention to Helmeppo</br></br></br>  <br>Sarkies was the one that Doflamingo controlled to cut down (and presumably kill at that time) Bellamy.</br>  <br> 1. The first timeskip that occurred was when luffy was 10 and higuma was the first named character to be killed and the next named character was Lacuba at the slave house who bit his tongue. <br>Pretty sure it was Roshio actually.</br></br>  Aokiji isn't actually allied with Blackbeard is he? He must have some sort of scheme.  <br>probably</br>  <br>There must be something else, however I don't see Kuzan betraying BB, because BB is not the kind of guy one would be truly be surprised to see outsmarted, imho Kuzan will try to use BB to destroy the WG.</br>  <br>He is, but not for the purpose of supporting him.</br>  <br>I know Luffy is stronger than the others but I can't see Zoro being too entirely far behind. He's scary when he wants to be.</br>  I'm looking for a new anime but I'm hesitant to watch one piece as I watched it as a child and I didn't like it.<br><br>I've only just got into anime and my favourite so far is fairy tail. I like childish humor and strong emotion, fairy tail made me cry and cheer and I'm hoping one piece will do the same what do you guys think are they similar?</br></br>  <br>I think you're a faggot for liking Fairy Tail.</br>    <br>I'm a girl.</br>  <br>I'm a prettier girl.</br>  <br>If you really are an animeonlyfag then watch the first 310 episodes but then switch to the manga. But beware that you will quickly come to realize that Fairy Tail is utter shit compared to One Piece.</br>  <br>Why didn't you like it?</br>  <br>Doubtful. Since you're so boastful I'll let you post a timestamped picture of yourself first.<br><br>9/10 average on /soc/ let's see you.</br></br></br>  <br>After watching and reading One Piece for years I started watching Fairy Tail and it really is inferior to One Piece in pretty much every category.</br>  <br>It creeped me out, the main character how he stretched his body, I was 10 or 11.</br>  <br>So you didn't like One Piece because of a rubber boy's ability to stretch? I mean if you're half mature now, then that wont even matter. Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece.</br>  <br>And you've probably seen the dub right?</br>  <br> Fairy Tail Shanks is pre-timeskip Shanks <br>Deep.</br></br>  <br>4kids dub undoubtedly.</br>  <br>Yes, it left a sour taste. That picture is interesting. I'll take your advice than and give it a chance.<br><br><br>Yes, does that matter? I can't really watch subs unless I mute it which makes it unwatchable the language puts me off.</br></br></br></br>  Why do people keep thinking there's gonna be another crew member? Luffy said he only wanted 10 people in his crew at the start:<br><br>1. Luffy<br>2. Zoro<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Sanji<br>6. Chopper<br>7. Robin<br>8. Franky<br>9. Brook<br>10.  Thousand Sunny </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>dub is the reason you didnt liked it in the first place, that wasnt one piece, go and watch the sub now and see you in 2 or 3 weeks after finished, go and search some page who show you what chapters are fillers and what you can see so yo can watch like 100 less chapters</br>  <br>luffy doesnt count</br>  <br>As much as I really like the idea of Bellamy joining after all these years and becoming a good guy, he's going to end going with Law. The whole 'dark past with Doflamingo' and the tattoo just kind of seal the deal.<br><br>Either that, or he's going to go off on his own and make his own crew.</br></br></br>  <br>Burgess is strong as shit. Sabo is just stronger, and that whole scene was just Burgess being a jobber to hype up Sabo.</br>  <br>Luffy said that he wanted 10 nakama/crewmates. That doesn't include himself.<br>1. Zoro<br>2. Sanji<br>3. Nami<br>4. Usopp<br>5. Chopper<br>6. Robin<br>7. Franky<br>8. Brook<br><br>That leaves two spots.<br>Jinbei is pretty much confirmed, leaving just one more opening. Oda also said some time post timeskip that there would be more members joining the crew (so likely the two final ones), and he said they'd show up successively.<br><br>Jinbei is highly likely to actually connect and properly join at Zou (next arc), and it'd be likely that we get someone from the following arc based on what Oda said, meaning Wano. I personally think it'll either be Kinemon, some samurai or  Monet if she's somehow alive </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Pretty sure Jimbei all but confirmed joining the crew, he only had "something to do" which prevented him from joining at that point.<br><br>Now that he has the Poneglyph he'll probably join up the next time they meet.</br></br></br></br>  Oda said there would be more crewmates coming.<br><br>I think that there will be 12 of them at the very, very max at the end of OP.</br></br>  <br>Yeah, that's what I was saying.<br><br>Luffy asked him to join and he accepted, and especially now with the poneglyph, I don't know how anyone could deny it.</br></br></br>  <br>Jimbe refused to go simply because his presence in the crew would make future fights extremely trvial for quite some time. Oda obviously wants Jimbe to be in the crew but cannot allow it until the Strawhats and their enemies reach Jimbe's level. That way, his sudden power introduction wouldn't be so jarring.</br>  <br>Good thing we're about to reach the Yonkous now isn't it.</br>  <br>The stalling was pretty smart. Jinbei's current bounty exceeds Luffy's, so atleast post-Dressrosa will raise Luffy's to 550 million or so, giving Jinbei's some room without encroaching Luffy's too much.</br>  <br>Luffy and zoro are already shown to be stronger than jimbei already. He is stronger than sanji but weaker than zoro.</br>  <br>No, they aren't. Jimbe is still in a league of his own and is a former Shichibukai. I doubt that Zoro can bat Doflamingo on his own, and Luffy was barely able to do it.</br>  <br>And I don't see jinbei beating doffy either.</br>  <br>Xusasu Basasu got his ass kicked by Ace earlier, and then got his ass kicked by Sabo. He's supposed to be strong, but definitely isn't as strong as the number 2 of the Revolutionaries. <br><br>Sabo is likely around Admiral tier, and Xusasu is likely somewhere below that, though probably a bit higher than Luffy.</br></br></br>  Jimbei did mention "things", so maybe there's something other than the Poneglyph.  <br>Robin used to be so hot.</br>  I understand some hype around Monet given personal preferences and taste. Im not particularly fond of her character in any way but hey. <br><br>However, I fail to understand how, not being driven by one's own doujin wishes, would somebody think she is anywhere near being a new crewmember.</br></br>  <br>Had to go help that kitten.</br>  <br> not living a life being driven by one's own doujin wishes </br>  <br><br>In/near water Jinbei is more than likely to win.</br></br>  <br>Ace was a deadly logia who was the second division commander of a yonkou, while Blackbeard's crewmates were just newish recruits of Blackbeard who were probably strong back in the blues/early GL. Of course they'd have nothing on Ace back then, same goes for the SHs including Luffy. <br><br>Sabo is under admiral level; around Doflamingo I'd say. Jesus is strong, yes, but I'd put him equal to or a bit below Luffy now that he has G4.<br><br>Still though; Burgess isn't weak. Losing to a very strong character =/= weak, despite what many people seem to think.<br><br><br>That's the ties to Big Mom he's got to cut, but where is Big Mom right now? Dressrosa/Zou.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> used to be <br>she is even hotter now</br></br>  <br>Robin's in her hotness prime currently.</br>  <br>She used to be the prettiest and most unique-looking woman in all anime and manga. Now she's just a generic hottie. I miss those bangs.</br>  How strong was Roger really?<br><br>He could hear sea kings, rivaled WB without any known devil fruit and commanded a legend like Rayleigh.<br><br>Still, I'd find it hilarious if it all turned out to be some red herring and Roger was extremely weak winning all his fights by pure luck.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br><br> Roger recruited Buggy because he reminded him of himself. Buggy will be the next Pirate King </br></br></br>  <br><br>We can only hope.</br></br>  <br>What's up with Luffy's left arm? (His left, our right)</br>  <br>Buggy vs God Usopp<br><br>Who wins?</br></br></br>  <br>It's just shrouded by the stream produced by Gear Second.</br>  <br><br>Usopp and all the dolls he rescued in Dressrosa<br><br>Vs.<br><br>Buggy and all the criminals from Impel down</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>The one true god.</br>  <br>I miss her too. She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br><br>Big boobs don't always make things better.</br></br></br>  <br> She was hot as fuck in her first appearance. <br>eeeeeh, sorry but when she first appeared she looked awkward as fuck</br></br>  <br>You like a little Miss All-Sunday hey?</br>  <br>Yeah but how is he holding it? Is it bent or is cut off from our view? There's also a weird bulge near the armpit.</br>  <br>On paper Buggy seems like an incredibly powerful pirate.<br> is a Shichibukai <br> was on Gol Rodgers crew <br> long time childhood friends with a Yonkou <br> part of one of the only successful escapes from Impel Down <br> leads tons of powerful pirates <br> was part of the Whitebeard War of the Greatest <br>The man's resume packs a punch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  So Chopper and Robin are the only Straw Hats left that don't have a Number chapter. Chopper's The Sixth seems to be related to some sort of Vegapunk arc, but Robin's The Seventh is ambiguous. You'd think her chapter would have been during Enies Lobby, but it wasn't. So what's left for her? Her guilt about Vivi? Something about the Poneglyphs regarding the Will of D.?  <br>And then you realize he's just like Zonge.</br>  <br> Fairy Tail is a poor man's One Piece. <br>That's a severe overstatement<br>Fairy tail is repetitive titty bait and a poor man's dbz (muh courage, muh resolution, muh friends, muh powerlevels)<br>One piece has actually got plot and interesting characters with reasons behind their actions</br></br></br></br>  <br>I started reading before Water Seven, stopped due to circumstances, and then came back after Enies Lobby. I honestly don't understand how people thought Paulie would join, I never got that vibe from him at all.</br>  <br>This cover always reminded me of a cover from death note where this leather wearing chick had her fiance killed by Yagami<br>Anyway, yes, I do miss that Robin<br><br>Kek</br></br></br></br>  <br>Paulie was cool and all, but Franky was so obvious and much more prominent. I wonder if Oda made this coverpage as a joke about all the Pauliefags.</br>  <br>Didn't this fat fuck Zombe get fucked by a monkey?</br>  <br>poor guy</br>  <br>Sure did.</br>  <br>Numerous times, he literally passed out from all the hot monkey king sex</br>  <br><br><br>I feel sick.</br></br></br>  Daily reminder that Law a slut.  <br>I'm sure he enjoyed every second of it<br><br>Oh fuck off already</br></br></br>  <br><br/></br>  <br>Need the good doctor to make you feel better?</br>  So Law's sacrificial immortality power confirms his death before the end of the series right? Or will he 'die' and come back?  <br>Likely die and come back. People always dying and coming back. Still half expecting Ace to come back.</br>  <br> 550 million <br><br>that's waaaay too high. Like holy shit, compare the shit he did at Impel Down and the Tenryuubito Punch and think about the fact that it's supposedly very hard to raise your bounty once you get over 300m, there's no way his bounty is going to be raised like that right after Dressrosa  assuming that's what you were saying </br></br></br>  <br>If they're going to even raise it, it's going to be 450.</br>  <br>Probably do one more arc wrapping up the other crew members then raise it.</br>  <br>i think you can argue that Luffy's bounty was low if you consider the shit he has done. Pre-timeskip luffy was dangerous due to his recklessness but still wasn't seen as that much of threat because he was kinda weak (compared to strongest wg forces). Now though, he's also really strong, so i think a really high bounty would be acceptable.</br>   Monet will never poop on your car   <br>I do think a very high bounty would fit him, I'm arguing whether or not raising it suddenly like that would make sense, and in my opinion it will take AT LEAST one other arc to get close to 550 mln</br>  <br><br>Also the WG covered up the Alabasta/Enies Lobby incidents pretty well.</br></br>  <br>And this time they can't cover it up really cause of ole crazy eyes.</br>  <br>She will be someone to Sanji like Kaya is to Usopp. She will stay.</br>  <br>Why? He's more of a threat as of now to the WG than Ace ever was. <br> Come back two years later and is a fuckton stronger (acknowledged by Sentoumaru) <br> Now has another two kingdoms allied to him <br> Entered a highly restricted WG island and kidnapped a wanted man who is only second to Vegapunk <br> Allied with a Shichibukai and now he's gone rogue also <br> Has the whole of Dressrosa (and likely people of neighbouring countries) admiring and praising him as a saviour <br> Has got an underling who could somewhat stand against an admiral <br> Has shown his true strength in front of an admiral <br> Fought and defeated one of the stronger Shichibukais, and has thus thrown out the world's balance yet again <br>Etc, he's worthy of 550 million, especially when you stack everything he's also done before the timeskip on top of that.<br><br>He's got to trump Kid's again.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br>Oh right, how could I forget. Luffy's threat posed and defeating of Doflamingo is known to the world and unable to be covered up. Moriah, Crocodile and Enies Lobby were all covered up to an extent which would have played a role.</br></br>  <br> Find at least 10 <br> Oda confirmed there'll be more Nakama showing up successively. </br></br>  <br><br>I completely forgot about Moriah, wasn't Doffy supposed to kill him and he escaped?<br><br>Has there been anything else mentioned about him?</br></br></br></br>  <br>Doflamingo thought that Moriah had escaped from his execution using his shadow powers, but it was in fact Absalom who turned him invisible and rescued him. Since then, there have been reports of Moriah being sighted in the New World, and we know for a fact that Absalom is still sailing around on the Mini-Thriller Bark.<br><br>Since Absalom and Hogback remained loyal to Moriah and took him from Thriller Bark in the same ship, it could be assumed that Moriah is still travelling on it. He'll likely have a comeback in the Kaido arc and ally with Luffy to take him down.<br><br>Pic related. It's the Mini Thriller Bark and if you look extremely closely at it, the two large figures standing on the deck somewhat resemble Moriah and his shadow clone.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br> He'll likely have a comeback in the Kaido arc and ally with Luffy <br>If Moria comes back and allies with Luffy with him, Crocodile, Law, Hancock, Buggy and Jinbe, that'll make 6 at some point Shichibukai that are Luffy allies to various degrees. 7 if you count Mihawk and his being a mentor to Zoro.</br></br>  <br>what about Kuma?</br>  tfw they animate this scene   Final chapter of One Piece. <br> Chapter 2000: To the Next Generation  <br> Group of people whispering near the port of some island. <br> "You know what today is, right?

And we thought we would be rid of that terror forever but... he had to say that thing and... start a whole new age of pirates!" <br> "And I heard that his crew members are still lurking about somewhere!" <br> Man in a cloak comes out of the shadows. <br> "Don't spread rumors like that. You're gonna scare the kids." says the cloaked man, covering his face with a turned-down straw hat. <br> "Oh! You're back from your journey! Did you find anything interesting?" <br> "Yeah. I found an old momento from a dear, departed friend." the cloaked man says, as he holds up a devil fruit. <br> "Woah! That fruit looks super yummy! Gimme a bite!" says a snot-nosed kid running by, who snatches the fruit from the cloaked man and digs in, only to spit it out right after. <br> "Ew! That fruit tastes like garbage! Where did you get that junk!?" shouts the kid. <br> At first, the cloaked man has a slightly shocked face, only to turn it into a knowing grin. <br> "Hey kid. What do you wanna be when you grow up?" <br> "Me? I'm gonna be the pirate king! Just like Straw Hat Lucy was!" <br> All the townsfolk nearby look on in shock at him uttering the name of that man. <br> The cloaked man bends down in front of the kid and reaches into his pocket. <br> Pulls out a pair of goggles. <br> "Do me a favor. When you become the pirate king, return these to me, and not a second sooner, got it?" <br> The kid smiles and his cheeks somehow expand to twice their normal size, as if he were made of rubber. "Got it, Captain Usopp!" <br> "Well, I've gotta go on another journey. I have a lot of islands I need to protect, you know." the man named Usopp says, as he walks up onto his ship. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> "Are you ready, sir?" asks one of his crewmates. <br> "Yeah. I just had to ensure that my friend's dream reached the next generation." <br> The ship begins to pull out of the docks. <br> "You know, captain. We got another declaration of war." <br>"Ha!" says Usopp "Let them declare all they want. I promised my friend that I'd keep this area of the sea safe, and that's what I'll do. Nobody messes with the Emperor of the Sea, Captain Usopp!"<br> The ship moves further out to sea, and everyone in town waves goodbye to their trusted protector, including one little boy with a pair of goggles once worn by a close friend of the pirate king himself, as he struggles to figure out why his arm is so wiggly all of the sudden. <br> END OF ONE PIECE </br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>too clichè but I like it because of Usopp.<br><br>For a second there I thought you were about to throw out a 'it was buggy who was executed' plot twist</br></br></br>  <br> He's got to trump Kid's again <br>He never trumped it to begin with though. I can see him getting 455 or something, between Law and Kidd.</br></br>  <br>Aw I forgot about him. Although he's kind of no longer himself or in a state to be an ally. All the others could potentially show up to help.</br>  <br>Chapter 439 is named The 3rd and 7th Person, referring to Usopp and Robin.</br>  <br>Kid was 315 at sabaody, after marine ford luffy was 400.</br>  <br> implying kuma didn't use his repel shenanigans to move his consciousness into another body before getting vegapunk'd <br><br>step it up</br></br></br>  <br> Straw Hat Lucy <br>Why. Just why. It was all nice and heartwarming and all and then this. Just fucking why.</br></br>  <br> Implying that name won't stick just like Gold Roger did. </br>  <br>Well damn. Now I want an arc where the straw hats take on someone with 8 current and former Shichibukai backing them up.</br>  <br>Please Lord, why. Why can't be just known as Straw hat Luffy ?</br>  <br>This might actually happen.<br><br>I mean Oda did set up Kuma and made his backstory pretty ominous, he wouldn't just get rid of a major story element character like that.</br></br></br>  <br> asks one of his crewmates <br> It's actually Zoro <br> ''You ready Usopp ?'' </br></br></br>  <br> Screenshot from the Toriko anime </br>  <br>720p bruh</br>  <br>Its still the Toriko anime, which is shit compared to the manga</br>  <br>Same could be said about One Piece.</br>  <br>Yeah, but OP's anime hasnt always been shit</br>  Reminder of best song sung by one Sieyuu<br><br>https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=E-8<wbr>mFnN2pWk</wbr>  [ ]</br></br>  <br> implying Zoro won't be doing an Afro Samurai Number 1 on a mountain training his successors. </br>  I really love Akainu's justice. It's tall, hard and linear as fuck.  <br>You do know its pretty much exactly the same as Lucci's "Dark Justice"? and Aokiji and Fujitora's types of Justice are way better</br>  <br>He's talking about the bonsai smartass.</br>  <br>I know, just felt like being a smartass</br>  I think Akainu get's more hate than he deserves tbh.  <br>What hate ?</br>  <br>Why is he likely? He spent the entire arc jobbing. He wasn't even relevant in any way, as opposed to every single Straw Hat in their respective arc.</br>  <br> Traitors justice are the best </br>  <br> akainu has a tiny sword tat on his right arm  <br><br>What does it mean</br></br></br>  <br>that you need to stop being such a faggot</br>  <br>How can a no name loser be calling me a faggot</br>  <br>He's gay for Mihawk.</br>  <br>It means he likes to rape good boys every night. In order to be a good cipherpol agent, you have to sleep with admirals. Lucci was like a cheetah in Akainu's love shack (both literally and figuratively).</br>  <br>He was obviously sending a secret message to Mihawk<br> ''lel Shanks lost an arm, you fancy fuck'' </br></br>  <br>Because, not only are you a dirty namefag but also you seem to support the shit posting</br>  <br>You're the one shit posting tho</br>  <br>Says the one namefagging with "Lucci a gud boy"</br>  <br>Sanji is in love with adventure, not women</br>  <br>That's debatable.</br>  <br>He's in love with women related adventures</br>  <br>since Oda is stalling this whole thing out like shit it's save to say we'll see a chapter all about Bellamy, maybe even already the next one. He's sleeping in that comfy house with all the other guys and I always saw him as the only logical option of a new crew member this arc and also his powers would kind of fit in really well in my opinion, in the powerscale he'd be somewhere between Robin and Franky. But yeah as many have stated he might join Law instead. <br><br><br> Viola still a strong contender <br>she really isn't.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>He also looks nothing like the other Strawhats, which is a plus. Viola kinda resembles Robin.</br>  THERE WILL BE NO FUCKING NEW CREWMEMBER AFTER THIS ARC YOU FUCKING RETARDS   Bellamy joins <br> They fight Kaido <br> Luffy use Gear 4th: Bound Man <br> Bellamy awakens the Bane Bane No Mi <br> Turns room into springs <br>  Increases Gear 4th's constant bouncing <br> Luffy travels at 5 times the speed he was in Gear 4th <br> Gomu Gomu No Bane Leo Bazooka <br> Kaidou gets knocked into the springs and bounces about the room <br> Luffy has eaten meat right before the fight <br> Intense amounts of stamina means 2nd Leo Bazooka <br> Kaidou bounces in to Luffy's boosted Leo Bazooka and it does even more damage because Kaidou is bouncing towards it <br> Kaidou BTFO <br> Bellamy replaces Sanji as blonde member of the monster trio </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I don't think g4 will do that much against kaido, he needs g5 at the very least and it will still be like when he fought lucci</br>  <br>The room probably has to be made out of Seastone or Wapometal to withstand that shit. Unless Law shows up and figures out how to make Solid Rooms.</br>  <br>It could be made of Wapometal, given it has no negative effects on DF and it looks like Kaidou has one</br>  <br>How is Viola a contender? She disappeared from the story for a huge amount of time and only served to give exposition to the audience and tell other characters about Dressrosa<br>What motivation does she have to join?</br></br>  One Piece official arc ranking straight from Oda:<br><br>Water 7/Enies Lobby &gt; Impel Down/Marineford &gt; Alabasta &gt; Punk Hazard/Dressrosa &gt; East Blue &gt; Skypiea &gt; Thriller Park &gt; Fishman Island</br></br>  <br> but muh Robin lookalike </br>  <br>Wouldn't that be another reason against her joining ? None of the Strawhats look alike at all.</br>  <br>'Twas ironic</br>  <br>My bad.</br>  <br>np</br>  <br>What about Gatz ?</br>  <br> only wanted 10 people <br>Inaccurate, he went out and said "let's see if I can atleast get 10 people to join my crew."<br>We might get well over 10.</br></br></br>  <br>That's what I've seen as well. The words ''at least''.</br>  would you accept one piece going on hiatus for a year so Oda can rest?  <br>Absolutely. I'd be restless for about 2 weeks but the time will pass quickly.</br>  <br><br>Rebecca wasn't born into royalty, once again. She cannot be the princess. Just like with Vegeta being the Saiyan Prince, he cannot be the king, just like Trunks can't be the successor when his father dies. I know she IS technically viable for that role, but I don't see her suddenly becoming a princess out of the blue.</br></br>  <br>A year is a little too long, something like six months for rest and then getting SJ to allow him to release chapters every two weeks, something similar to the schedule of One Punch Man.<br><br>This would allow him to improve his art and keep the art at a high quality and maybe even have longer chapters, keeping everyone happy.<br><br> This would probably screw over the anime even more, but nobody watches the anime anymore. </br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Definetely, Oda works non-stop so we can enjoy One Piece, also it would benefit TOEI because they'd have to take a break and hopefully when OP returns, it starts looking good</br>  <br>Nah, the anime should take a break too. They didn't have to wait 4 bloody weeks for the timeskip. It's unfair.</br>  Can someone explain why bellamy joining is bad? I'm just curious why so many people think so. And please don't say it's because his power isn't strong enough to be in the crew. I understand that the crewmen have to be strong but I want to know if his personality can fit well with the crew.  <br>The anime should just make a filler arc or two, cover stories are a great material for that.</br>  <br>Yea, but, the last filler was absolute shit too but at least it's for a good cause. <br><br><br>It's nothing like that. People just think Bellamy is a bitch because of how he cried and kissed Doffy's ass. I personally don't mind at all since it was just as pathetic as Usopp coming back to the crew. And I fucking love Usopp. I don't think Bellamy is weak either. I think he's as strong, maybe a little weaker than Franky. I think having Bellamy would be cool as fuck because he can be blown away by all the crazy shit the Strawhats get to see. Mainly, I just want him to get to Emerald City with the others. Could be a Skypiea 2.0.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Would be better if both Monet and Bellamy joined. Why not two at once?</br>  <br>Absolutely.<br>He's killing himself with that work schedule of his. Guy needs to rest and clear his mind.</br></br>  One Strawhat can unlock either Observation or Armament Haki, which Straw Hat is it and which Haki do they learn?  <br>Now that he has grown as a person, Bellamy could potentially have great dynamic with SHs, but there are a few reasons why he isn't SH material. The most prominent one is, he wasn't important in this arc. Compare him to anyone else: Zoro's intro arc was centered around him, Arlong Park was mostly about Nami, same goes for Sanji and Usopp in their intro arcs. Chopper was relevant in Drum Island as a doctor and Hiluluk's apprentice, Robin was Croc's right hand woman and the one who introduced to the readers the True History, Franky was targeted by CP9 and built Sunny, Brook was the reason SHs went to Thriller Bark. Jinbe played a key role in Fishman Island. What can we say about Bellamy in Dressrosa? He defeated some fodders and then jobbed. Remove him from the arc, and it actually improves. That's why he is a bad option: irrelevant characters shouldn't suddenly be given a huge role of Luffy's nakama.<br>The best candidate is Kyros (the one who led a rebellion against Doffy), but he wants to be with his daughter, so it's not happening.</br></br>  <br>Well luffy might not fight kaido alone he will probably have help like doffy. Also if moriah helps the strawhats take on kaido then we might see nightmare luffy or maybe a stronger version.</br>  <br>I get the feeling that for a lot of people it's<br> Bawww it's not Law! <br>or<br> Bawww it's not a girl! <br><br>Or, more legitimately, they plain don't like the character.<br><br>Me, I like the idea of his joining. After 'mingo, Luffy is probably the man he respects the most right now, and I can see that leading to him joining the crew since he has nowhere to belong to anymore. I think his powers also fit well with the rest. Not OP bullshit, but still pretty strong.<br><br>What I wonder is what would be his occupation within the crew. Lookout?</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br> showed Luffy how to exit the arena so Sabo could switch places with him and win mera mera vs Burgess <br>I think Luffy would have beat Burgess but he'd be exhausted and unable to fight Doffy afterward.<br>Remove him from the arc and Luffy loses to Doffy.</br></br></br>  <br>I think the fight against him helped strengthen Luffy's resolve too. He was super fucking pissed at Doffy after that fight and that shit made me so hyped.</br>  <br>But why would Monet even join???????<br>Her lil sister hates the strawhats (mainly ussop), zoro made her look like a bitch and she's hella loyal to doffy. Bellamy might not like doffy anymore because doffy was a dick to him but doffy was never a dick to Monet. Plus she has to be able to find the stawhats. And she's not even alive.</br></br>  <br>The only reason I want her to join is to get more doujins. Is that so much to ask for ?!</br>  <br>Luffy could've climbed the Colosseum's seating and jumped down.</br>  <br>Nami was first introduced in buggys arc and her importance wasn't that high. Until arlong park did she have an important role that was higher than the other strawhats at the time. Same with robin. She just joined out of nowhere in alabasta and until enies lobby did she have have an important part in an arc. So if bellamy joins he might receive his important arc later</br>  I still haven't heard a compelling argument against Barto, if Dressrosa gets a nakama at all.  <br>E M E R A L D C I T Y<br>M<br>E<br>R<br>A<br>L<br>D<br><br>C<br>I<br>T<br>Y</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>And I want more doujins of Nathan the navigator and Robert the archaeologist but not a single one is out</br>  <br><br> Fighting for dat ass</br></br>  <br>Nami was still pretty important as the only navigator that was available. Robin saved Luffy from dying and foreshadowed things left and right. What does Bellamy have?</br>  <br>His gag is already annoying, the only reason people want him to join is because he is a fan favorite.</br>  Why doesn't oda just hire a studio of 10 assistants who do all the drawing for him and allow him to only do the writing and rough sketches?<br>He must be a millionaire by now anyways.<br>That way he could crank up the material and still spend more time with his family.</br></br>  <br>Why do people keep posting emerald city in One Piece threads? havent been on for a few days</br>  <br>Because Bellamy is a fucking asshole, the SH crew don't give a fuck about him and he's probably still loyal to Doflamingo because every time Doffy steps on his balls he seems to get more loyal.<br>He also didn't have a real character arc like all the other SH members have had before properly "joining". Even Robin was quite prominent during Alabasta despite having her character arc alot later. <br><br>As far as new characters go, the only character who would fit is Law and Law has his own crew. Probably gonna be no new crewmates till Wano.<br><br>However, Moocy would be the best SH.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>I am sure he does not want that, it would feel less like his own work if most of the stuff is done by other people, I for one would hate that as an artist.</br>  <br>Because the Wizard of Oz cover and Bellamy previously mentioned it as a "stupid legend" like Skypeia.</br>  <br>ok</br>  <br>He has a crew and stated that in chapter 773 he's not strong enough to be useful to luffy</br>  <br>Already has a crew. Might be joined by Bellamy as a grumpy foil to his excitement and SH lust.</br>  <br>How is bellamy an asshole he changed during this arc. Also do you not remember what robin did to cobra and tashigi?</br>  <br>Even worse, he would've turned into a toy. People tend to forget that was the whole point of the colosseum from Doffy's perspective.</br>  <br>Zoro was known to be an asshole too. Usopp was a dick to most of the Village. Nami is an absolute cunt. Sanji was a total dick. Chopper was 'good'. Robin was mainly a cunt. Franky was a total dick. And Brook was nice too. So the majority of the fucking Strawhats are assholes. <br><br>You clearly hated Bellamy before Dressrosa and that's why you're so against him, even though he, in my opinion, is being redeemed. Robin and Nami had just about as screen time as Bellamy in Dressrosa.</br></br></br>  Did anyone actually think that robin was going to join when she was first introduced? While reading alabasta it seemed so obvious vivi was gonna join but then she doesn't and out of the blue nico robins on the ship. The only time it seemed like she would join was when she attacked crocodile and when she gave the antidote to luffy and when luffy saved her. But the arc was practically over when that happened though.  Since Arabasta and Dressrosa are so similar, Bellamy fits the 'Robin' role the most. He pissed othe MC upon introduction. He used to work for the Villain and was fairly loyal. He clearly wasn't that against the MC. He did what he did because of what he believed in. He was spared by the MC. <br><br>He even has a ready made Animal theme.</br></br>  <br>I can already see Zoro being kinda cautious of him and Usopp losing his shit when Bellamy says his profession is ''Executioner''.</br>  I'm gonna laugh so fucking hard when no one joins.  I hope you guys know that ussops name won't change to God ussop and his picture won't change either. All the marines on dressrosa can't go back and tell their reports because of fujitora. His bounty will probably just raise normally. Also the WG might raise the bounties of the sanjihats since they probably think their on the island  <br>and this is exactly what will happen</br>  <br>The word of God Usopp would be passed around either way, if not by marines by pirates and others.<br><br><br>Is Leo not on the sights for anyone, I mean are we really going to pass this opportunity to have a Dwarf in the crew? I am sure he will forget that -land stuff eventually.</br></br></br></br>  Kyros could join as a contribution from Riku to the SH's cause. A thank you gift.  <br>Why ? Do you think everyone having their fav character not joining is funny? Oh wait you probably do since your 12</br>  <br>Expect that Bellamy was no where as important to Doffy as Robin was to Croc. <br><br>Bellamy was lower than trash in Doflamingo eyes. He wasn't even part of the family. Doflamingo kept him around pretty much just because he enjoys bullying him.</br></br></br>  <br>Are you Hawk!?<br>You remind me of Hawk!</br></br>  <br>And Crocodile never trusted Robin from the first place. She was his right hand, sure, but Crocodile didn't give two shits about her.</br>  <br>Not fast enough. And if the WG do listen to pirate rumors are they going to be able to connect ussop to sogeking if they don't know ussops face?</br>  <br>I know Riku is all for peace and shit but giving away the Country's strongest warrior is just retarded.</br>  <br>They already know Usopp is Sogeking though. Shit, the Pacafista's knew even before the Timeskip. He'll get a bigger bounty, new picture but the poster name would still be Sogeking, maybe. And Luffy and Chopper would buy it because they'll think people just mistook Usopp's nose.</br>  <br>same could be said about Bellamy. Doffy didnt give two shits about him and probably wouldnt've cared if he failed, succeeded, betrayed him, or sucked his dick.</br>  <br>That's my point ? I was looking at the similarities, if you couldn't figure it out.</br>  <br>I wouldn't mind having a Dwarf in the crew but Leo is shit. Wicca would be a better choice.</br>  <br>Her becoming Zoro's GPS would melt my heart. She and Chopper can argue about being the Mascot.</br>  <br>Expect that Robin was clearly very important to Croc. Without her he would never get his hands on Pluton.<br><br>Bellamy on other hand was not important to Doffy at all.</br></br></br>  <br>Well Robin got to be the first day of the week and Croco only seems to give a shit about Daz.<br><br>Bellamy sort of got kicked in Diamante's direction after he fucked up. Doffy wants EVERYONE else. Even randos on Wanted posters, just not Bellamy</br></br></br>  <br>Kyro's isnt even Riku's to give away anymore. After staging Scarlet's death, he was pretty much free to do whatever the hell</br>  <br>Crocodile was finished in the sky<br>Doffy was finished in the ground<br>There was a weight woman in baroque works<br>There was a weight man in the donquixote family<br>Crocodile was trying to take over a country <br>Doffy had his already taken over<br>Croc was a logia which is a top notch devil fruit<br>Doffy had a paramecia which was the lowest category of devil fruits<br>Ace helped in alabasta<br>Sabo helped in dressrosa<br>Ace fought smoker<br>Sabo fought fujitora<br>Alabasta was covered up<br>Dressrosa wasn't<br>Nico robin the right hand of the organizations leader joins the crew<br>Bellamy who was trash in doffys eyes will join the crew.<br><br>This arc was a parallel to alabasta so since bellamy was the lowest member and robin was the highest (excluding crocodile) gallant will join.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Luffy is Post Admiral level, fast approaching Yonko. Damn you stupid nigga, this manga's going into the home stretch, there isn't much time left for him to get any stronger.</br>  <br><br>Hey, hey, I never said they were the same. I said they were similar. There's a clear difference. Just like Arabasta and Dressrosa. They're not the same, just similar.</br></br>  <br> Luffy is Post Admiral level <br><br>not this shit again. Jesus fucking Christ.<br><br>Oda stated that Sakazuki is so strong that if he were to become the protagonist of OP he would end it all in one year. Do you seriously think Luffy is even comparable to him right now?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>That makes an odd amount of sense</br>  <br>Why can't there be another Timeskip when Teach solo's the entire crew ?</br>  <br>It won't be going into the home stretch anytime soon though, there's so many plot points that need to be resolved. They haven't even gotten to fucking Elbaf yet let alone final arc.</br>  I want powerlevelfags to leave  So...he left?  <br>Not yet.</br>  <br>they never will. They feel the urge to shit up every single one piece thread for some strange reason</br>  Were off the see The wizard!  <br>No the WG don't. They never met ussop or even have his picture. Also the only way they could get a picture of ussop is if they have a marine on dressrosa do it. But all the marines on deessrosa can't come back unless Fuji captures strawhat. So they will probably still use the sogeking pic since a mask doesn't change.</br>  <br>as long as One Piece is ongoing, we're doomed to deal with these faggots</br>  <br>CONFIRMED</br>  Bellamy is used goods.  Why don't any of the admirals/vice admirals/marines wear their fucking coats? It's always around their shoulders, Nigga if you're not ever gonna wear it don't bring it and drape it over your shoulders like you're some kind of badass.  <br>the discussions about Doflamingo being Admiral Level and Luffy being above him with both at 100% were seriously one of the most retarded things to ever be born into OP threads. Fucking hell.</br>  <br>The coats are stitched to their shoulders so they can look like cool yakuza guys without the coat falling off.</br>  <br>Oh gee, I guess this is another fucking Sogeking then, huh ? I'm not talking about Dressrosa at all. I'm talking about Usopp in general.<br><br><br>So were Nami and Robin.</br></br></br></br>  <br> Why don't any of the admirals/vice admirals/marines wear their fucking coats? <br> like you're some kind of badass. <br><br>Nigga you ain't cool.<br>Let the marines do fly shit.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Nope in an SBS, Oda said they're held on by justice</br>  <br>I fucking hate it when Usoppfag speedreaders don't realist the marines know Usopp IS Sogeking and have for ages.<br>Someone always has to post this picture to shut em down.</br></br>  so, what was your favorite Admiral actual reveal?<br><br>Mine has to be Kizaru's. It was just so stylish. Aokiji's a close second.</br></br>  <br>Look at luffy from east blue and look how much luffy leveled up when he made it to shabondy. Then there was a timeeskip. Now imagine how strong luffy will get once he reaches marine HQ. a time skip isn't needed.</br>  Is George R.R Martin the best thing to happen to Anime since the invention of the third wheel?<br> Suggestions appreciated, feel free to discuss </br>  ITT: Poorly executed anime censorships.

I thought hand holding being worthy of censorship was all just a big /a/ in-joke.</br>  <br><br><br>american law</br></br></br>  <br>I guess the first one due to "cruelty to animals".</br>  <br>the loli pop looks cooler smoking isnt cool</br>  <br>Meant for </br>  <br>I'll at least give them props for changing the gun to something funny.</br>  <br>mad with power.</br>    <br>Law that prevents you from have a product in a kids cartoon thats an actual 1:1 piece of merchandise for sale. That and they went censor happy since they were paid by the amount of animation to change.</br>    <br>Everytime, here in fucking germany if there's a trap, the gender gets switched.<br>Just saw that last night with Akame ga Kill.Dub censored out all references to Nyau being male.<br>(Was also the same with Sailor Moon, with Fisheye and Zoisite.)<br>Anyway, Nyau was kept on being referred to as "she" even in his buff form and a clear male voice.</br></br></br></br>  <br>When you edit it, you have to have animators and artists to redraw or reanimate the scene. The more that needs to be done the more it costs. So they tend to get censor happy so that they can justify charging more.</br>    <br>Don't they even call them contests in the dub? I remember there being episodes about pokemon contests during the Hoenn series where they called them that.</br>  Just remember guys, 4kids fucked itself in the ass and got sued into bankruptcy. Its dead and the ashes are a crappy sporting and entertainment licensing company that will never touch anime again. It can't hurt you ever again.  <br>they literally sexualised it by giving it clothes.</br>  https://www.<span>youtube.com/watch?v=xfJ<wbr>uJrqFhXM</wbr>  [ ]  <br> not completely censored <br>THEY HAD ONE JOB</br></br>  laser chainsaw  Terraformars and Prison School  <br>What did they do again?</br>      <br>I think the reason they do this is to make it easier to internationalize the 4kids dub, so they don't have to change the writing for every language. Not that having words in English in a non-English dub hurts anyone, but see  I remember them removing all text from the Kirby anime, also.</br>  <br>Wouldn't this be more effective than guns if it had sea water? Why don't guards just run around with squirt guns against devil fruit users.</br>    <br>They aren't weak against water itself, silly. It's that they lose all strength and sink if the water is deep enough.<br>If they wanted to exploit that weakness they'd have to outfit the average marine with a goddamn swimming pool (bathtubs have been shown not to be enough).</br></br>  <br>All my wat</br>  <br>But it would be affective against logia type users. Didn't Luffy coat him self in water when fighting Croc so he could hit Croc/not be dried out.</br>  <br>They don't fucking die from touching the water, they just can't swim.</br>  <br>His wording is pretty bad but in essence, he's right : they don't have the right to show the actual merchandise in a show. Like, if you make a toy of a tank that's in the show it's fine, but having the toy of the tank show up is not. It's why, for instance, YuGiOh dub edited the cards from a direct copy of the TCG cards into those dumb ones with just the image and atk/def (no one reads the damn effects in these shows anyway).<br>So with Pokémon being a giant cash cow, anything like pens or cases with a pokéball on it is potential merchandise and they got too censor-happy as a result.<br><br>I think that legislation's gone now, though.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That's a special case because Crocodile had an explict water weakness, since he's made of sand and all. If you threw water at most Logias it wouldn't do jack (except maybe Ace?)</br>      <br><br><br><br><br><br>I can understand why One Piece never got quite as popular with the general western public as Naruto.</br></br></br></br></br></br>        <br>What the hell is that supposed to be?

In that scene, everyone had assumed that those monsters could only run a certain speed.<br><br>So that human, who was supposedly incredibly fucking strong, got completely fucking wrecked when the monster made some lightning fast movement and was decapitated.</br></br></br></br>  <br>I got that too as a kid and never thought it was censored because even then Misty was giving me boners.</br>  <br>Right edit looks like it was done in ms paint.</br>  <br>Nevermind,  explained it.</br>  <br>They did this because of 2 reasons. Whaling and shit, and they had to speed it up to Drum island.</br>  <br>there isn't even any goddamn anti-aliasing, like they just put in a bucket fill<br><br>and why is the saturation so damn high on the right one, it's so bad it's impressive</br></br></br>  <br>Pizza heals all wounds.</br>  <br><br><br><br> 5 on the shirt <br> 5 at the end of the post number <br> K.O.G. anime <br><br>It's like you fags weren't here for epik gets.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br><br> look at the post number </br></br>  <br> the shadow on the edited gun <br>Bravo, 4Kids edit dude.</br></br>  <br> those voices <br>Why did every 4kids dub insist on giving half the characters of any given show ridiculous over-the-top accents?</br></br>  <br>I was too busy looking at the soda that I never noticed the burger and fries.</br>  <br><br>I noticed that, I was referring to how they removed the 5 off of Joey's shirt</br></br>  <br> Why did every 4kids dub insist on giving half the characters of any given show ridiculous over-the-top accents? <br><br>On the plus side, Zolo's dub voice nails it</br></br></br>  <br>I actually like the lolipop more because it makes more sense.<br><br>Smoking dulls your sense of taste so I think it isn't something Sanji would do.</br></br></br>  <br>Chefs on the line are infamous smokers, as it can be an extremely stressful job.</br>  Hating on 4kids has been done to death  <br>That doesn't make the censoring any less stupid.</br>  <br> That doesn't make the censoring any less stupid. <br><br>Well we got the upcoming Yokai Watch coming soon so get ready!</br></br></br>    Are murrica kids that sensitive? And why even buy the rights and air an anime if you know it can be offensive or harmful without censoring? Thats really fucking dumb<br><br>I'm glad we got uncensored anime in my country</br></br>  <br>Murrica parents and college kids</br>  <br>You don't have to worry about exploiting Ace's weakness anymore.</br>  <br>It's mostly prudes in the late 70's though the very early 90's that FELT that children were that sensitive. They took positions in television or called to complain about things they didn't want their kids to see on TV. Rules were written, shows got censored, etc.<br><br>Eventually, all this got relaxed a bit and now there's not much censorship for cartoons. There's no where near as much that gets picked up for kids compared to the late 90's early 2000's anime craze though.</br></br></br>  Now imagine a country got something that isn't exactly for kids, to air in a kid's block.<br>And threw out the entire script and replaced it with thousands and thousands of puns.<br><br> It was fucking hilarious. </br></br></br>  <br>Is 4kids localizing it?</br>  <br>I know, right?</br>  <br>Enjoy your nothing!</br>  <br>Fuck, they did this to Renamon and in One Piece with Hachi and Satori, too. NONE of those were traps in any sense of the word. NONE.<br>At least they were appearently forced to change Hachi back, or so it seemed when I last watched a dub two years ago while visiting my Dad.<br>Fuck that shit, fuck that so badly. And fuck everyone who laughs about subs and prefers dubs with a rusty chainsaw. This is once again proof that those people don't deserve life.</br></br></br>  <br>No. But that show has a load of weird and occasionally lewd shit in it, so it'd be shocking if it went unscathed.</br>  <br>oh man what?<br><br> thousands of puns <br><br>I want to watch this. where/what was it?</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>It's guiness now.<br><br> remember kids, smoking a gigantic cigar is better than drinking some alcohol! <br> ALL HAIL THE PROHIBITION PARTY AND JESUS!! </br></br></br></br>    <br>French translation of Okuto No Ken<br><br>It's indeed pretty famous for its totally out of context voices, huge censorship and puns everywhere.

The 90s had censorshit on animu, but it also had Animaniacs, Gargoyles and Batman.<br>It's so much better now (most of the time).<br>Sometimes it's still dodgy (it was never literally stated that Korra killed Unalaq, but it was fucking obvious; at least we can now imply homosexuality without moralfags starting to whine down everyone). And in Thundercats 2011 they at least made the genocide VERY clear, and the cat realm was not portrayed as a gentle paradise (they had it coming).<br>But we still have barely anyone shooting at others with real guns, amusingly.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  In german naruto no one died, people just suddenly vanished.<br>Appearently Ninjaland was ruled by Stalin.</br>  <br>Lit end = candy end<br>"filter" end = non-candy end<br><br>How did they flip it so he didn't put the non-candy end in his mouth?</br></br></br></br>  <br>They just edited it so the candy end flipped around and went in his mouth, then colored what would have been the lit end, to just be the white end of the stick. I remember catching an episode way back in the day and thought it was funny to see it just flip around like that.</br>  <br>Thank god the latin dub for this series was great and made me afraid to go to sleep at night.<br>10/10 would torrent if found</br></br>  <br>Sounds like 4kids YuGiOh.</br>  <br>Why even bother translating it at that point? Its a show about ninjas.</br>    <br><br><br>To give you an idea, remember that in Hokuto no Ken ("Ken the Survivor" in French), you have two rival schools, Hokuto and Nanto. Hokuto, when pronounced Hokooto, sounds like "couteau", the word for knife. nanto sounds like manteau, the word for coat. <br><br>hence, the French dub abounds with sentences like : <br><br> "He was a great master of the fur Nanto."  <br><br> "This is a secret technique of the meat Hokuto." <br><br>Also, in the scene where Yuria commits suicide in front of Shin by jumping from one of his palace's balconies, the French dub has Shin getting mad at the architect for not installing a proper balcony. <br><br>It also has nonsensical dialogues. To quote :<br><br> *Kenshiro strikes Shin with a powerful attack* <br> Shin : How did you do that ?  <br> Kenshiro : I can't tell you. <br><br>or <br><br> *Ken talks to a widow about her dead husband* <br> "Before dying, he told me he loved you. He told me other things too, but I forgot them."  <br><br>This dub is a work of art in itself. It's become a cult classic among French anime enthusiasts. <br><br>However, even in all this shit, it managed to make what is, in my opinion, an improvement on the base material. Kenshiro's most famous line is "You're already dead." The French dub turns it into :<br><br> "You don't know it yet, but you're already dead." <br><br>Which is a lot cooler.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>    <br>Honestly, the one on the right looks better</br>  Explain.  <br>Laziness. Actually giving effort would result in them having to make a specific version for each dub.<br><br>Much easier to remove everything and never care.</br></br></br>  <br>Fuck, it almost sounds like an abridged series.</br>  <br>clapistani's don't like reading.</br>  <br>Now that you mention it, yeah, it's kinda like that.</br>  <br>Since fucking when.

Dramas are the easiest way to generate those from people. A highly traumatic event, couple to root for and to get sad for when they have troubles or die. Cliffhangers to force you to tune in next week because implied sudden death. Dramas are actually easy mode in comparison in terms of ease in getting emotional connections from the audience.<br><br>As an example in shitgatsu wa kimoi no kuso, you have Arima as your weaked will traumatized protagonist, 2 cute girls to act as the love interest for your shipping need and another dude as the rival for the main heroine affection. So you thought he overcame the trauma after his successful cameback recital with the violin slut? Think again, he reverted back to his old shell once the slut faint and all his flashback to his dead mom came back faster than you can say WOW. Is this what the baka waito gaijins think of good anime with a good drama?<br><br>For a genuine SoL (moeshit as you normalfag like to call it) to draw genuine laughs, tears, nostalgia and familial-bonding type feelings without needing any drama or plot at all, is an achievement not at all to be fucking written off.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>She is just too innocent and didn't have friends (I suppose) before.<br><br><br>Only that Mao bitch is the one after Wakaba's money.<br><br> Plans to get ice cream <br> Doesn't have money <br> Gets invited anyways <br> Start eating it <br> Suddenly she doesn't want it anymore <br><br>What a bitch.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  bump because i just got here and wakaba a cute    Mao a shit.

It's obvious why Alice can't see anything wrong with her.</br></br></br>  <br> Alice and Shino's daughter isn't blonde <br> she most likely dyed her hair <br><br>Shino must have been a real cunt of a parent for this to happen</br></br></br></br>  <br>If that were true, either WOW THEY LOST A LOT OF ENTHUSIASM AND CHANGED THEIR HAIR COLOR or Wakaba was given up to her now brunette mom and black haired sister.</br>  <br>Or Alice actually dyes her hair</br>  <br>Main couple is bleh.

It's way too cute.  <br>Our Kinmoza girls are good people, adopting those girls like that.</br>  Err... why is the Blu-Ray/DVD all the way in January?  <br>Bundling all the short episodes together and releasing them post-season?</br>  <br>http://wakabagirl.com/news/index001<wbr>10000.html Maybe I misinterpreted.

If we had such advanced VR by that time, why wouldn't AI become just as advanced?</br>  <br>Yeah it's a live event with the VAs for the people who brought the series, so the disc is probably going to come with one of those lottery ticket things.</br>  <br>What'd be hilarious is if the mangaka showed up there.<br><br>She never showed up at any Kinmoza live events did she?</br></br></br>  How much for Mao?  <br>A shit.</br>  <br>You a shit.</br>  <br><br>You can't just buy the Chairman.</br></br>  So is Wakaba going to get a miniskirt or just keep her long skirt the whole time?  <br>I'm going with this for now.</br>  HOLY SHIT  <br>Somehow I think she'll keep her long skirt for the duration of the show.</br>  <br>I want to see her with Honoka's braid.</br>  <br>TWO SHITS FUSED.</br>  <br>Why are you such a bully /a/non.</br>    I want to stick my dick in Mao's butthole.  <br>no</br>  <br>I'm guessing you're a non-native English speaker.</br>  <br>No, I literally just woke up.<br>To answer the question, it's because they are two completely different technologies that just barely have a relation to each other.</br></br>  <br>So you're saying only one technology can advance over so many years and somehow other technologies can't just because they're different technologies? That shouldn't, but it sounds like that's what you're saying.</br>  <br>I'm saying it makes no sense to hold them to the same rate of advancement. They don't necessarily develop at the same pace as each other.<br>Just like how just because we have computers we can hold in our hands, doesn't mean we're capable of interstellar travel.<br><br>That's not to say it isn't possible though. There could be some breakthrough in AI overnight that leaves VR in the dust, or vice versa. But it isn't likely.</br></br></br></br>  <br><br>My god. I never thought I'd ever witness perfection of such a high degree.<br>It's beautiful, no, it's beyond beautiful, it's what god created when he deflowered his wife.<br>It's like heaven had a child with itself.</br></br></br></br>  Today's the day, I'm ready for the vibrant colours  <br>Wait three weeks and watch 3 episodes back to back to back.</br>  <br> Can read it backwards <br>Holy shit.</br></br>  30 minutes.<br>Are you hype?</br>  No Mori  ;_;   <br>Hyped as shit. I need more Mao in my life.</br>  <br>Cute.</br>  <br>HS are decent?</br>  <br>Why is Karen so pink? She ruined the whole blonde fetish.</br>  <br>Kiniro Mosaic have shitty parts? I haven't noticed any. Guess I was too distracted by Karen being perfect.</br>  <br>There were a few parts without any Karen at all.</br>  <br>I don't understand, Aya and Yoko are perfect.</br>  <br>You mean Kallen, right?</br>  Is the manga just one volume long?  <br>Afraid to read two volumes?</br>  <br> S3 never <br> No more Ayaya perfection </br></br>  I'm okay with that.  <br>I'm just asking because manga-updates say it's already completed with one volume out, and that there would only be one season.</br>  <br> Watching HS when there are alternatives. <br>Please love yourself.</br></br>  <br>Anon, I think you just pinpointed why K-on!! of all things made me cry like a little bitch. After lots of fun and sillyness they slowly realizing the end of their highschool days and the weight making them suddenly to tear up torn me apart. I guess it shouldn't compare with the death of a relative or facing the horrors of war and stuff but its touching in its own way.</br>  <br>k I will.</br>  <br>HS is actually not so bad for this.</br>  <br>if you say so</br>  <br>Still better than Commie, not that that is saying much.</br>  <br><br>HS are the only ones that provide 1080p.</br></br>  <br><br>Who cares, watch Mori</br></br>  <br>I like Ayaya but I don't understand why is she so popular. Aren't confident girls better by default? Why insecure girls get so much attention? Guess its kind of a soft abusive relationship, people like her because she's easy to pick on.</br>  <br>Yeah, it's done.</br>  <br>How do you know it isn't upscaled 1080p which it likely is?</br>  <br>Commie provides karaoke. You're wrong by default.</br>  <br>They also barely are able to correctly translate anything.</br>   [HorribleSubs] Wakaba Girl - 03 [720p].mkv   <br>Commie can win you with so little?</br>  <br>[Citation needed]<br><br><br> karaoke <br> little <br>You must not like being able to sing along. Please learn to love yourself.</br></br></br></br></br></br>  For fuck's sake, CR.    <br>I can sing along with singers.</br>  <br>I wanted one of them to play it and become a fan. I love it when that happens</br>  <br>Commie only uses the translated song, you can't even sing along.</br>  I want to marry Moe-tan.  <br>hahaha owned</br>  <br> [Citation needed] <br>Have you even seen their pathetic GuP OVAs translation attempt?</br></br>  <br>she's the best</br>  <br>You can't.</br>  https://d.maxfile.ro/waxilflhcw.web<wbr>m <br> audio version </br></wbr>  <br> commie only uses the translated song <br>Confirmed for not watching their Log Horizon subs. They do both the translated version and the romaji.<br><br><br>Nope but I've seen their other subs.</br></br></br></br></br>  <br>Kill yourself any time.<br>Watch LH raw before doing that though.</br></br>  <br>I want to marry Wakaba</br>  <br>no subs</br>  <br>Wut? There are subs.</br>  <br>Just try and stop me.</br>  <br>I don't see them.</br>  <br>I want to marry her sister and her mother.</br>  <br>She's a good girl.</br>  <br>lol no she isn't</br>  <br>They have become tainted.</br>  <br>Their what?</br>  <br>That was seriously inconsiderate giving her a gay game just like that.</br>  Whatever.  <br>Minds.<br><br>and panties.</br></br></br>  <br>Just minds.</br>  <br>For now.</br>  <br>?abakawakaB</br>  <br>Leave the adults alone.</br>  Why is she silly  <br><br>It's easy to discern an upscale from an anime that was produced at higher resolution by simply using your eyes and your brain. Look e.g. at the small letters in this shot, they're not completely sharp, so it's probably not a native 1080p. On the other hand it might have been produced at a higher resolution than 720p. Hard to say, not going to download the 720p version to compare.<br><br>On a completely different note it doesn't matter as I'm watching my anime fullscreen on a 1080p monitor, so between watching an upscale on the fly or downloading a video that has at least a realistic chance to be not an upscale the latter wins. Unless you have problems with drive space or download limits.</br></br></br></br>  <br>That is not silly. It prevents the spread of germs.</br>  <br>But the shades, though?</br>  <br>Do you see how bright it is in there?</br>  <br>The question is who is more autistic Wakaba or Hajime?</br>  <br>Is that Aozora Stripe?</br>  <br>No.</br>  <br>Nobody will see through that disguise.</br>  <br>It could be many different people.</br>  <br>Wakaba ain't autistic so the answer is pretty obvious.</br>  <br> Wakaba ain't autistic <br>Sure about that?</br></br>  <br> wakaba isn't autistic <br><br>what?</br></br></br>  Reminder that Mao is best girl.  Moe the moest.  Green &gt; Spiky Hair &gt;&gt; shit &gt; Red &gt; Silver  <br><br>Mao moe?</br></br>  <br>Shit, this was too cute.</br>  <br>Because she use vlc.</br>  <br>She's a watered down Karen but yes she is.</br>  <br>No, are you?<br>The fact that she is over-reacting to every day situations is not a symbol of autism, just a lack of experience. You could call her a late-bloomer though.<br>Then again, I'm not a doctor and I'm probably autistic too.</br></br></br>  <br><br>Don't say nice things about yourself.</br></br>  <br> 2 glasses boys <br>This should be illegal.</br></br>  <br>Mao posts on /a/?</br>  <br>It is.</br>  <br> Mao <br> Literally a demon king. <br> Literally a Marxist dictator <br>She's shit.</br></br></br></br>  <br>Marxists ruin everything.</br>  So, how many times did you you receive a BL game from your highschool girl friends and play it in front of mother and sisters?  <br>Mah nigga</br>  <br>Fuck communism.</br>  <br>Thank you!</br>  <br> DeadFish <br>Look at him; look at him and laugh.</br></br>  <br>I cannot laugh.</br>  <br>No, Bakaba is best girl.</br>  Are you an otaku?    <br>Just a fan.</br>  I want to whack a Wakaba.  <br>Cruel.</br>  <br>how many seconds for each section?</br>  Is Moeko poor?  <br>60.</br>  Moe is as tech incompetent as her parents.  <br>Very.</br>  Symphogear GX thread<br> Symphogear GX thread </br>  TAKANARE  G BEAT  What is Shirabe saying?  <br>S1 is better on rewatch there is so much time spent on crying Maria and DMJii doing anything that it sucks to watch again.</br>  <br>Honestly I can't decide.<br>They're both different and awesome in their own way.<br>It's like asking me if I prefer eating or sleeping.</br></br></br>  Read the guide before asking anything<br><br>buyfag.moe</br></br>  <br>I've only ever had things go through NY customs but I've never had a problem. On the other hand, I never order anything lewd or even loli, so there's no reason for them to stop anything. I haven't really heard of anything getting stopped at US customs though in recent memory.</br>  <br>finally a good fig of mai waifu. They ever list a price or we still in the dark?</br>  <br>Nothing yet.</br>  <br><br>That post makes me curious now, also none of my parcels haven't been open over the years as well</br></br>  <br>That body is too delicious. It should be a crime to be this delicious.</br>  Solid show or shonen shit?  <br><br> Shonen </br></br>  <br>Somewhere in the middle</br>  Solid for the first 50 or so episodes, and trash for pretty much the remainder of the series, bar some of the Band of Seven arc and the 2-part backstory.  <br>What genre was it, really? It's like it tried too hard to be everything and instead became none.</br>  <br>Understatement. There were definitely problems with the manga: it was too long, had a rotating door for villains, had a couple things which had to be removed because Takahashi thought they'd work but they didn't (she thought people would like Koga the way they liked Ryoga, and she also quickly realized that trips to modern Japan should be few and far between), and... well, other than that it was good. The setting was unique and coherent without being cheesy at all. Like most Takahashi stories, the characters and premise were very solid. Unlike most Takahashi stories, it felt like the story was going somewhere (even if it took over 500 fucking chapters to do so) and even has a decent ending.<br><br>I'll occasionally re-read the first ~100 chapters of Inuyasha, which are some of the best. It does start to get repetitive so I've only read past that point the first time I read it.</br></br></br>  Movie spoilers from yesterday.<br><br>In a post-apocalyptic future where only a fraction of humanity has survived to live humbly amongst the rubble, Eren Jaeger dreams of more. His brainy friend Armin tells tall tales about deserts and oceans beyond the massive walls that guard their civilization, and his girlfriend Mikasa is equally entranced by the birds that soar over those untouchable barricades. Unfortunately, Eren's wish to see the walls opened to the outside world comes at a devastating cost. Enormous humanoid monsters called "Titans" come stampeding through the walls and immediately start eating every man, woman, and child they can find.<br><br>In the aftermath of the tragedy, Eren joins the newly minted "Titan Survey Corps" alongside hundreds of other young adults. Some of these new soldiers are hungry for revenge, but most are just plain hungry due to the ensuing famine. While facing down his demons and fighting through past trauma, Eren will have to rediscover what "freedom" means to him in a new world ruled by fear.<br> Eren and Mikasa were dating before the first attack <br> Mikasa gets separated from Eren and Armin and is presumed dead <br> It's implied that Shikishima saved Mikasa's life <br> During Eren and Mikasa's reunion Mikasa is butthurt towards Eren since she thinks that he abandoned her after the first attack <br> It becomes evident that Shikishima holds romantic feelings for Mikasa <br> Armin and Sasha seem to have a thing going on <br> Eren and Mikasa's relationship starts out as cold after their reunion but Mikasa slowly starts warming up to him <br> At the end of the movie Eren gets eaten and he shifts, Mikasa is the one who pulls him out of his titan form and she hugs him tightly <br><br><br><br><span class="abbr">Comment too long. <a href="thread/128163299#p128163299">Click here</a> to view the full text. </br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>  <br>What are they doing?
